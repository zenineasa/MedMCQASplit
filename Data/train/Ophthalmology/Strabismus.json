        "question": "What is the most common cause of amblyopia?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Squint AMBLYOPIAo Amblyopia refers to a reversible decrease of vision, either unilateral or bilateral, for which no cause can be found by physical examination of the eye, i. e., there is absence of any organic disease of ocular media, retina and visual pathway. o Amblyopia is produced by certain amblyogenic factors operating during the critical period of visual development i. e., first 6-7 years of life. Newborn babies can see. However, as they grow, visual pathways continue to develop from the eye to brain and within the brain. The brain learns how to interpret the signals that come from eye. This visual development continues until about 6-7 years of age. If, for any reason, a young child cannot use one or both eyes normally, then the vision is not learnt properly. This results in impaired vision (poor visual acuity) called amblyopiao A squint is the most common cause of amblyopia. One eye remains the dominant focusing eye (normal eye). The other (squinting) eye is suppressed as it is not used to focusing and the brain ignores the signals from this eye. Therefore, the squinting eye fails to develop the normal visual pathwayso Amblyopia also occurs when the refractive error in one eye is significantly more from the other (Anisometric amblyopia), for instance, when one eye is very hypermetropic and the other eye is normal or myopic. Anything that prevents the light from getting into the eye, such as scars on the corneal surface or cataract, will cause amblyopia (stimulus deprivation amblyopia or amblyopia ex anopsia).",

Option b - most neonates are not accommodating, so the esotropia is acquired when the infant starts to accommodate to bring near objects to focus. As a result of Hypermetropia (2-3 D at birth) in the child, additional accommodative effort is required to bring the images into focus, and thus over convergence response is seen (Near reflex has 3 parts: Accommodation, convergence and miosis). Option c - accommodative esotropia(s) are usually hypermetropic, but rarely more than 7. 00 D. If more than that, both eyes become amblyopic without correction.
