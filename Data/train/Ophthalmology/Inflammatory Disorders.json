In fact it's the most common ocular infection in AIDS patients.It must be clarified here that one should not get confused between the terms retinitis, chorioretinitis and retinochoroiditis. Though pathologically they have some differences but clinically they mean one and the same thing. Retina and choroids are in close a proximity to each other and infection of one is bound to infect other.CM V retinitis (or chorioretinitis) is seen in about 30-40% of the pts with AIDS, where as toxoplasma retinochoroiditis is seen in about 1-2% and Histoplasma and cryptococcus are even much rarer.More about occular manifestation in AIDSMost common occular lesion in AIDS -- HIV Micro vasculopathy involving conjunctiva and retinaMost common ocular neoplasm in AIDS -- Kaposi's sarcomaEarliest and most consistant finding in HIV Retinopathy -- cotton wool spots*The risk for CMV Retinitis increases as the no. of circulating CD4 Lymphocytes declines.
