        "exp": "Ans. is b' i. e., 60 D Reduced eve (Reduced schematic eye) In schematic model, the optical system of eye behaves like a combination of lenses. The reduced schematic eye treats the eye as if it were a single refracting element consisting of an ideal spherical surface separating two media of refractive indices of 1. 00 (air in external environment) and 1. 33 (eye as a whole). So, in reduced eye, the entire system (of eye) can be regarded as one lens with one optical centre which lies in the posterior pa of crystalline lens. The diopteric power of reduced eye is + 60D, of which + 44D is contributed by cornea and + 16D by the crystalline lens. Reduced eye concept was introduced by Listing, therefore, it is also referred to as Listing's reduced eye.",
