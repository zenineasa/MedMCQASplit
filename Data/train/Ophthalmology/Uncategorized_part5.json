It is more common in rural /agricultural areas of developing tropical countries. Keratomycosis/ Fungal (Mycotic) Corneal Ulcer Etiology Filamentous septate hyphae (tubular projections) producing multicellular fungi, most notably, Fusarium and Aspergillus (fumigatus) are the most common causative organism in tropics (or hot climate) and around the word - Unicellular budding yeast eg Candida is most common cause of fungal keratitis in temprate (cold) regions. Predisposing Factors - Injury by vegetative materials or animal tail are common modes of infectionQ. - Antibiotics disturb the symbiosis between bacteria & fungi; and the steroids make fungi facultative pathogens by decreasing local immunity. Therefore excessive use of these drugs result in fungal infections. Corneal trauma often tril, involving plant matter or gardening / agricultural tool (in tropics); corneal disease, local immunosuppression, long term use of topical steroid, prior corneal transplantation, contact lens wear, systemic immune suppression and diabetes (in temperate zones). Clinical Features - Symptoms are much tnilder than the clinical signs would suggestQ -. There is marked ciliary, & conjunctival congestion but symptoms of pain, watering and photophobia are dispropoionately less (as compared to those with bacterial corneal ulcer) - Presents with a gradual onset of pain, grittiness, photo phobia, blurred vision and watery or mucopurulent discharge. - The ulcer is dry-lookingQ, grayish white with elevated rolled out margins and feathery finger like extensionsQ into surrounding stroma under intact epithelium. - A sterile immune ring (yellow line of Wesseley)Q present where fungal antigen and host antibody meet. - Multiple small satellite lesions Q may be present around ulcer (feathery /fluffy margins with satellite lesions) - A big hypopyon is present even if the ulcer is very small. Unlike bacterial ulcer the hypopym may not be sterile (pseudohypopyon) Q as fungi can penetrate into anterior chamber without perforation. Hypopyon is thick and immobile d/t direct invasion and enmeshing of fungal hyphae. Perforation is rare & corneal vascularization is conspicuously absent.

Ceain other types of ophthalmoplegia are:- Nuclear ophthalmoplegia:- It is paralysis of extraocular muscles due to lesion of the third cranial nerve nuclei. They are more often bilateral. Ophthalmoplegic migraine or Episodic ophthalmoplegia:- It is characterized by recurrent attacks of headaches associated with paralysis of third, fouh and sixth cranial nerves. The incidence of involvement of the third cranial nerve is the most common and it persists for days or weeks after the attack. It is often unilateral and tends to become permanent. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) CPEO is the most common feature of mitochondrial myopathy. It occurs in > 50% cases of all mitochondrial myopathies. Typical presentation is B/L ptosis without diplopia in early adulthood. Ophthalmoplegia is usually symmetrical & slowly progressive so diplopia is not often a complaint because all eye movements are reduced equally. The progressive ophtha lmoplegia is unnoticed till decreased ocular motility limits peripheral vision. Ciliary muscles & iris muscles are often unaffected by CPEO. Other variable symptoms are: Exercise intolerance Hearing loss Ataxia Hypogonadism Cataract Sensory axonal neuropathy Clinical depression Parkinsonism",

Examples include levobunolol, timolol, betaxolol and metipranolol. Possible side effects include difficulty breathing, slowed pulse, hair loss, lower blood pressure, impotence, fatigue, weakness, depression and memory loss. Alpha-agonists. These reduce the production of aqueous humor and increase drainage. Examples include apraclonidine and brimonidine. Possible side effects include fatigue; dizziness; red, itchy or swollen eyes; dry mouth; and allergic reactions. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. These also reduce the production of aqueous humor. Examples include dorzolamide and brinzolamide. Frequent urination and a tingling sensation in the fingers and toes are possible side effects, occurring more often with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors than with anhydrase inhibitor eyedrops. Prostaglandin-like compounds. These eyedrops increase the outflow of aqueous humor. Examples include latanoprost, bimatoprost and travoprost. Possible side effects include mild reddening and stinging of the eyes and darkening of the iris, changes in the pigment of the eyelid skin, and blurred vision from swelling of the retina. Miotic or cholinergic agents. These also increase the outflow of aqueous humor. Examples include pilocarpine and carbachol. Possible side effects are pain around or inside the eyes, brow ache, blurred or dim vision, nearsightedness, allergic reactions, a stuffy nose, sweating, increased salivation, and occasional digestive problems. Epinephrine compounds. These compounds, such as dipivefrin, also increase the outflow of aqueous humor. Possible side effects include red eyes, allergic reactions, palpitations, increased blood pressure, headache and anxiety Prednisone is very effective for treating inflammations and immune-related ocular diseases.

B: Superior palpebral conjunctiva In trachoma, a characteristic white conjunctival scar (Arlt line) is usually formed at the junction between the lower third and upper two-third of the superior tarsus Trachoma/ Granular conjunctivitis/ Egyptian ophthalmia It is an infectious disease causing a characteristic roughening of the inner surface of the eyelids. It is the leading cause of infectious blindness in the world. Trachoma is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis It is spread by direct contact with eye, nose, and throat secretions from affected individuals, or contact with fomites (inanimate objects that carry infectious agents, such as blankets and pillowcases), such as towels and/or washcloths, that have had similar contact with these secretions. Untreated, repeated trachoma infections result in entropion -- a painful form of permanent blindness when the eyelids turn inward, causing the eyelashes to scratch the cornea. Children are the most susceptible to infection due to their tendency to easily get diy The bacterium has an incubation period of 5 to 12 days, after which the affected individual experiences symptoms of conjunctivitis, or irritation similar to \"pink eye. \" Blinding endemic trachoma results from multiple episodes of reinfection that maintains the intense inflammation in the conjunctiva. The conjunctival inflammation is called \"active trachoma\" and usually is seen in children, especially pre-school children. It is characterized by white lumps in the undersurface of the upper eyelid (conjunctival follicles or lymphoid germinal centres) and by non-specific inflammation and thickening often associated with papillae. Follicles may also appear at the junction of the cornea and the sclera (limbal follicles). Active trachoma will often be irritating and have a watery discharge. Bacterial secondary infection may occur and cause a purulent discharge. The later structural changes of trachoma are referred to as \"cicatricial trachoma\". These include scarring in the eyelid (tarsal conjunctiva) that leads to distoion of the eyelid with buckling of the lid (tarsus) so the lashes rub on the eye (trichiasis). These lashes will lead to corneal opacities and scarring and then to blindness. Linear scar present in the Sulcus subtarsalis is called Ar. It's line (named after Carl Ferdinand von Arlt). In addition, blood vessels and scar tissue can invade the upper cornea (pannus). Resolved limbal follicles may leave small gaps in pannus (Herbe's Pits). The major complication or the most impoant one is corneal ulcer occurring due to rubbing by concentrations, or trichiasis with superimposed bacterial infection Grading of trachoma Mc. Callan's classification-Mc. Callan in 1908 divided the clinical course of trachoma into 4 stages WHO classification-The World Health Organization recommends a simplified grading system for trachoma. The Simplified WHO Grading System is summarized below (FISTO): Trachomatous inflammation, follicular (TF) - Five or more follicles of >0. 5 mm on the upper tarsal conjunctiva Trachomatous inflammation, intense (TI) - Papillary hyperophy and inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva obscuring more than half the deep tarsal vessels Trachomatous scarring (TS) - Presence of scarring in tarsal conjunctiva. Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) - At least one ingrown eyelash touching the globe, or evidence of epilation (eyelash removal) Corneal opacity (CO) - Corneal opacity blurring pa of the pupil margin SAFE strategy National governments in collaboration with numerous non-profit organizations implement trachoma control programs using the WHO-recommended SAFE strategy, which includes: Surgery to correct advanced stages of the disease; Antibiotics to treat active infection, using Zithromax (azithromycin) donated by Pfizer Inc through the International Trachoma Initiative; Facial cleanliness to reduce disease transmission; Environmental change to increase access to clean water and improved sanitation. Surgery For individuals with trichiasis, a bilamellar tarsal rotation procedure is warranted to direct the lashes away from the globe. Early intervention is beneficial as the rate of recurrence is higher in more advanced disease. Antibiotic therapy WHO Guidelines recommend that a region should receive community-based, mass antibiotic treatment when the prevalence of active trachoma among one to nine year-old children is greater than 10 percent. Subsequent annual treatment should be administered for three years, at which time the prevalence should be reassessed. Annual treatment should continue until the prevalence drops below five percent At lower prevalences, antibiotic treatment should be family-based. Antibiotic selection: Azithromycin (single oral dose of 20 mg/kg) or topical tetracycline (one percent eye ointment twice a day for six weeks). Azithromycin is preferred because it is used as a single oral dose. Although it is expensive, it is generally used as pa of the international donation program organized by Pfizer through the International Trachoma Initiative. Azithromycin can be used in children from the age of six months and in pregnancy. Facial cleanliness Children with grossly visible nasal discharge, ocular discharge, or flies on their faces are at least twice as likely to have active trachoma as children with clean faces. Intensive community-based health education programs to promote face-washing can significantly reduce the prevalence of active trachoma, especially intense trachoma (TI). If somebody is already infected washing one's face is strongly encouraged, especially a child, in order to prevent reinfection Environmental improvement Modifications in water use, fly control, latrine use, health education and proximity to domesticated animals have all been proposed to reduce transmission of C. trachomatis.",

Some axons from optic tract pass to the pretectal region in the midbrain, from there impulses are sent to Edinger Westphal nucleus of both eyes. Impulses from these nuclei travel in the oculomotor nerve to reach the ciliary ganglia. From the ciliary ganglia impulses travel to the eye where they cause the pupils to constrict by activation of the constrictor pupillae muscle. Pupillary light reflex refers to constriction of pupils of both eye when light is shone into the pupil of an eye. Constriction of the pupil in the eye into which light is shining is called direct response and constriction of the opposite pupil is called consensual response.

C: Pseudomyopia Pseudomyopia It refers to an intermittent and temporary shift in refraction of the eye towards myopia, in which the focusing of light in front of the retina is due to a transient spasm of the ciliary muscle causing an increase in the refractive power of the eye. It may be either organic, through stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, or functional in origin, through eye strain or fatigue of ocular systems. It is common in young adults who have active accommodation, and classically occurs after a change in visual requirements, such as students preparing for an exam, or a change in occupation. The major symptom is intermittent blurring of distance vision paicularly noticeable after prolonged periods of near work, and symptoms of asthenopia. The vision may clear temporarily using concave (minus) lenses. The diagnosis is done by cycloplegic refraction using a strong cycloplegic like atropine or homatropine eye drops. Accommodative amplitude and facility may be reduced as a result of the ciliary muscle spasm. Treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology. Organic causes may include systemic or ocular medications, brain stem injury, or active ocular inflammation such as uveitis. Functional pseudomyopia is managed though modification of working conditions, an updated refraction, or through appropriate ocular exercises",

In most cases, some poion of the uvea of the injured eye has been exposed to the atmosphere for at least 1 hour.

As a result of ciliary body inflammation, floating spots and loss of the power of accommodation are among the earliest symptoms. The disease may progress to severe iridocyclitis. Usually, the eye remains relatively painless. The retina usually remains uninvolved except for perivascular cuffing of the retinal vessels with inflammatory cells.

Symptoms usually begins as blurred vision with shadowing around images. Vision becomes progressively more blurred and distoed with associated glare, halos around lights, light sensitivity and ocular irritation. Visual loss occurs primarily from irregular astigmatism and myopia. and secondarily from corneal scarring The hallmark of keratoconus is central or paracentral stromal thinning, apical protrusion of anterior corneaand irregular astigmatism. The cornea thins near the centre and progressively bulges forwards, with the apex of cone always being slightly below the centre of the cornea.

D: High myopia Degenerative high axial myopia is the most common cause of posterior staphyloma Staphyloma It is an abnormal protrusion of the uveal tissue through a weak point in the eyeball. The protrusion is generally black in colour, due to the inner layers of the eye. It occurs due to weakening of outer layer of eye (cornea or sclera) by an inflammatory or degenerative condition. It may be of 5 types, depending on the location on the eye ball (bulbus oculi). Anterior (corneal) staphyloma In the anterior segment of the eye, involving the cornea and the nearby sclera. Intercalary staphyloma It is the name given to the localised bulge in limbal area, lined by the root of the iris. It results due to ectasia of weak scar tissue formed at the limbus, following healing of a perforating injury or a peripheral corneal ulcer. There may be associated secondary angle closure glaucoma, may cause progression of the bulge if not treated. Defective vision occurs due to marked corneal astigmatism. Treatment consists of localised staphylectomy under heavy doses of oral steroids. Ciliary staphyloma It is the bulge of weak sclera lined by ciliary body, which occurs about 2-3 mm away from the limbus. Its common causes are thinning of sclera following perforating injury, scleritis and absolute glaucoma. Equatorial staphyloma Seen on the equator of the eye (region circumferencing the largest diameter ohogonal to the visual axis). Its causes are scleritis and degeneration of sclera in pathological myopia. It occurs more commonly in the regions of sclera which are perforated by voex veins. Posterior staphyloma It is seen in the posterior segment of the eye, typically diagnosed at the region of the macula, deforming the eye in a way that the eye-length is extended associated with myopia (nearsightedness). It is diagnosed by ophthalmoscopy, which shows an area of retinal excavation in the region of the staphvloma",

This traction is due to formation of vitreal, epiretinal, or subretinal membranes consisting of fibroblasts and glial and retinal pigment epithelial cells.

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is the most common type of retinal detachment.

The dilator pupillae muscle (smooth muscle of the iris that dilates the pupil) is sympathetically innervated; paralysis of this muscle due to interruption of its innervation results in constriction of the pupil (miosis). Good to know: Dilation of the pupil would result from paralysis of the sphincter pupillae muscle (smooth muscle of the iris that constricts the pupil). This muscle is parasympathetically innervated and would not be affected by this injury. An inability to abduct the eye would result from paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle, an extraocular muscle that is innervated by the abducens nerve. It would not be affected by this injury.

        "question": "True regarding accommodative esotropia is",
        "exp": "D i. e. Miotics are used in high AC/ A ratio Accomodative Esotropia Near vision involves both accommodation and convergence. Accomodation is the process by which the eye focuses on a near target, by altering the curvature of the crystalline lens. Simultaneously, the eyes converge, in order to fixate bifoveally on the target. Typical history is of intermittent esotropia that appears between 6 months and 7 years of age (average 30 months) toward the end of the day or when the child is very tired, ill or day dreaming (especially at near fixation distances, such as across the dinner table). At onset, the child may experience asthenopia (as fusional divergence amplitudes are stressed) and may rub the eyes or squint), an older children may complain of headaches or diplopia. As the esotropia becomes more frequent, abnormal retinal correspondence & suppression, when available, relieve asthenopic suymptoms at the possible expense of fusional divergence amplitude. Classification & Manifestations Refractive accommodative esotropia Accomodative convergence/ Accomodation (AC/A) ratio is normal and esotropia is a physiolocal response to excessive hypermetropia, usually between +4. 0 and +7. 0D. Patients with high hyperopia must generate large accommodative input to see clearly at near fixation and thus stress fusional divergence amplitudes. They may choose blurred vision and maintain comfoable single binocular vision, or they may choose clear vision and risk asthenopia or esotropia. The patient with high hypermetropia (hyperopia) who do not develop esotropia, yet who maintain excellent visual acuity, often have low AC/A ratio. The magnitude of the detion varies little (usually < 10 A) between distance and near vision. The ocular detion is usually greater for near than for distance fixation. (wrong in Parson) Fully accommodative type is completely eliminated by optical correction of hypermetropia; where as paially accommodative is reduced, but not eliminated. Non-refractive accommodative esotropia It is associated with high AC/A ratio in which a unit increase of accommodation is accompanied by a dispropoionately large increase of convergence in the absence of significant hypermetropia. The two types are: - Convergence excess, is characterized by high AC/A ratio d/t increased AC (Convergence is exaggerated but accommodation is normal), normal near point of accommodation and straight eyes for distance, but esotropia for near. - Hypoaccomodation esotropia, is characterized by high AC/A ratio d/t decreased A (accommodation is weak, necessitating increased effo, which is accompanied by a strong convergence response), remote near point of accommodation, and small refractive error. Mixed Accomodative esotropia Hypermtropia and high AC/A coexist, resulting in esptropia for distance, which increases markedly (> 104) on near fixation. Treatment plan Refractive correction Record the distant vision & angle of detion of each eye. Then estimate error of refraction by retinoscopy after prescribing atropine ointment 1% tds for 3 days. The angle of detion is likely to be less under atropine in case of hypermetropes with convergent squint or more in myopes with divergent squint. In hypermetropes no deduction for effect of atropine should be made. - In a children under the age of 6 years, the full cycloplegic refraction revealed on retinoscopy should be prescribed (with a deduction only for working distance). And the child is reavaluated after a month's full time wear of the prescription. If the distance & near esodetions are reduced to with in the monofixational range ( 8 Aof estropia) and the child has a comfoably controlled phoria & no aesthenopia signs & symptoms, the treatment is considered successful & the patient is re-evaluated 3-6 months later. Now if the distance tropic is greater than the above limit, the cycloplegic refraction is repeated; if it is still so with the new refraction the patients becomes a candidate for surgery. If the distance detion is controlled but an esotropia greater than the above limit is present at near fixation or if symptomatic phoria at near fixation persists, the patient is given bifocal glasses. - After the age of 8 years, retinoscopy should be performed without cycloplegia & the maximum amount of plus that can be tolerated prescribed. - Bifocals act by relaxing the accommodation & thereby decreasing the accommodative convergence. It may be prescribed if there is accommodative esotropia for near. (high AC/A ratio). The minimum lens power that conves esotropia to an esophoria is prescribed to prevent excessive relaxation of accommodation. They should initially be prescribed in executive type, in which the intersection crosses the lower border of pupil. - Children with non refractive accommodative esotropia are prescribed bifocals with near addition of +3. 0 D to eliminate accommodative convergence by removing the need to accommodate for viewing near objects. - The patients is asked to wear the bifocals for 1 month and then return for reevaluation; rarely except for V-pattern esotropia, does the near detion not respond to bifocal prescription if the distance detion is controlled using full cycloplegic refraction. Patients with V-pattern accommodative esotropia may require miotics alone or in addition to single vision glasses, as bifocal require downgaze fixation & detion is largest in downgaze in such patients. - The strength of lower segment should be gradually reduced at about 6 years of age, roughly 0. 5-0. 75 D every 6 months, beginning with bifocals. It is often possible to rid children of their bifocals by 8-9 years of age and of their mild to moderate hyperopic correction by the early teens. Patients who have high hyperopia, astigmatism or anisometropia may require optical correction for acuity purposes after their accommodative esotropia has resolved. Contraindications for treatment with bifocals are the presence of amblyopia and the reduction but not complete elimination of esotropia at near fixation. - Miotic therapy can be used sho term in younger children (< 1 year) with accommodative esotropia d/t high AC/A ratio who will not wear spectacles. Ecothiopate iodine 0. 125% once daily or 4% pilocarpine q. i. d. are used. The formation of iris cyst induced by ecothiopate can be prevented by simultaneous administration of 2. 5% phenylephrine dropsQ twice daily. It works by inducing peripheral accommodationQ (i. e. direct stimulation of ciliary muscle rather than that mediated by 3\"1 cranial nerve.) Less accommodative effo is therefore required by patient for near vision & thereby less accommodative convergence is induced. It however results in blurred distant vision. As a rule glasses and miotics are equally effective treatments and it is rare for a patient to respond to one but not the, otherQ, conversely use of both together rarely 104) on near fixation. \" v: shapes=\"_x0000_s1026\">salvages a patient who does not respond to one or otherQ. An intellectual preference exists for refractive treatment for the highly hyperoic refractive accommodative esotropia and miotic treatment for the patient who has a high AC/A ratioQ. Treatment of amblyopia & ohoptic training - Ohoptic training by synaptophore cultivate binocular vision & stereoscopic fusion. It is of great value but rarely cures a squint of over 10 degrees detion or one of the long standing. It is rarely wohwhile to persist with it as a sole method of treatment if the detion is not corrected within 3 months. Surgery is classically done for nonaccomodative component of distance esodetionQ, with an arbitrary addition (1mm additional recession per medial rectus) for a high AC/A ratio. - Surgery is indicated when angle of squint is 10deg or more with correcting lenses and in children when ohoptic training has failed to correct the detion with in a reasonable time. As a general rule if it has to be done it should be undeaken early & ceainly as soon as child is old enough to co-operate in post operative ohoptic treatment, usually between 4 & 5 years of age but preferably as early as 18 months if required (gives better results). Postponment until the child is 10 years old or more usually results in permanent amblyopia & failure to establish binocular vision. The operation is then purely cosmetic.",

B: Rhabdomyosarcoma Malignant tumours of the orbit are usually sarcomata Rhabdomyosarcomata are extremely malignant tumours Rhabdomyosarcoma It is a cancer, specifically a sarcoma (cancer of connective tissues), in which the cancer cells are thought to arise from skeletal muscle progenitors. It can olso be found attached to muscle tissue, wrapped around intestines, or in any anatomic location. Most ouyir in areas naturally lacking in skeletal muscle, such as the head, neck, and genitourinary tract. Presentation Its two most common forms are embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. In the former, which is more common in younger children, the cancer cells resemble those of a typical 6-to-8-week embryo. In the latter, which is more common in older children and teenagers, they resemble those of a typical 10-to-12-week embryo. Epidemiology It is most common in children ages one to five, and is also found in teens aged 15 to 19, although this is more rare. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children. Soft tissue sarcomas make up about 3% of childhood cancers. Diagnosis Diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma depends on recognition of differentiation toward skeletal muscle cells. The proteins myo. D1 and myogenin are transcription factor proteins normally found in developing skeletal muscle cells which disappears after the muscle matures and becomes innervated by a nerve. Thus, myo. D1 and myogenin are not usually found in normal skeletal muscle and serve as a useful immunohistochemical marker of rhabdomyosarcoma. Treatment Treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma consists of chemotherapy, radiation therapy and sometimes surgery. Surgery to remove the tumor may be difficult or impossible depending on the location of the tumor.",

Thus, for veical gaze, the superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles are synergists in moving the eye upward. Muscles synergistic for one function may be antagonistic for another. For example, the superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles are antagonists for torsion, the superior rectus causing intorsion and the inferior oblique extorsion. The extraocular muscles, like skeletal muscles, show reciprocal innervation of antagonistic muscles (Sherrington's law). Thus, in dextroversion (right gaze), the right medial and left lateral rectus muscles are inhibited while the right lateral and left medial rectus muscles are stimulated. What is reciprocal innervation? When a stretch reflex occurs, the muscles that antagonize the action of the muscle involved (antagonists) relax. This phenomenon is said to be due to reciprocal innervation. Impulses in the Ia fibers from the muscle spindles of the protagonist muscle cause postsynaptic inhibition of the motor neurons to the antagonists. The pathway mediating this effect is bisynaptic. A collateral from each Ia fiber passes in the spinal cord to an inhibitory interneuron that synapses on a motor neuron supplying the antagonist muscles. Ref: Motley W., Asbury T. (2011). Chapter 12.

Involvement of fovea by edema & hard exudates or ischemia (diabetic maculopathy) is the most common cause of visual impairment in diabetic patients paicularly those with type 2 diabetes (NIDDM) Type I diabetics (IDDM) are at paicular risk of developing PDR. And vitreous haemorrhage is most common cause of visual loss in patients with PDRQ. Almost all type I diabetic patients develop retionapathy in about 15 years. In those with type II diabetes, the risk of diabetic retinopathy increases with the duration of diabetes (most impoant-risk factor), accompanying hypertension & smoking. Diabetic retinopathy is more common in type I diabetes than in type 2. Non proliferative DR is more common than proliferative DR; type 1 diabetics are at paicular risk of developing PDR. It appears that duration is stronger predictor for proliferative disease than for maculopathy. In NP DR, macular edema (most common)Q, exudates and capillary occlusions often cause blindness but affected patients usually maintain at least ambulatory vision. On the other hand, PDR may result in severe vitreous haemorrhage or retinal detachment, with hand movement vision or worst. Macular edema or retinal thickening (d/t fluid coming from leaking microaneurysm or diffuse capillary incompetence) Is an impoant manifestation of NPDR (early) and represents the leading cause of legal blindness in diabetics. Proliferative new leaking vessels usually arise from retinal veins and grow along the route of least resistance (eg disc b/o absence of true internal limiting membrane or shallowly detached posterior vitreous). It has long been assumed that sudden vitreous contractions tear the fragile new vessels, causing vitreous haemorrhage. However, most diabetic vitreous haemorrhages occur during sleep, probably b/o an increase in blood pressur secondary to early morning hypoglycemia or to REM sleepQ. Because so few haemorrhags occur during exercise, it is not necessary to restrict the activity of patients, with proliferative DR. Haemorrhage (RBC) behind posterior vitreous face settle quickly to the bottom of eye & are absorbed. Whereas when RBCs break into vitreous body, they adhere to get & clearing may take months or years.",

        "exp": "Ans. C: Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation Phacoemulsification is today the most popular method worldwide and has now viually replaced all other techniques in most countries Phacoemulsification It refers to modern cataract surgery in which the eye's internal lens is emulsified with an ultrasonic handpiece and aspirated from the eye. Phacoemulsification surgery involves the use of a machine with microprocessor-controlled fluid dynamics. The phaco probe is an ultrasonic handpiece with a titanium or steel needle. The tip of the needle vibrates at ultrasonic frequency to sculpt and emulsify the cataract while the pump aspirates paicles through the tip. In some techniques, a second fine steel instrument called a \"chopper\" is used from a side po to help with chopping the nucleus into smaller pieces. The cataract is usually broken into two or four pieces and each piece is emulsified and aspirated out with suction. The nucleus emulsification makes it easier to aspirate the paicles. After removing all hard central lens nucleus with phacoemulsification, the softer outer lens coex is removed with suction only. An irrigation-aspiration probe or a bimanual system is used to aspirate out the remaining peripheral coical matter, while leaving the posterior capsule intact. As with other cataract extraction procedures, an intraocular lens implant (IOL), is placed into the remaining lens capsule. For implanting a PMMA IOL, the incision has to be enlarged. For implanting a foldable IOL, the incision does not have to be enlarged. The foldable IOL, made of silicone or acrylic of appropriate power is folded either using a holder/folder, or a proprietary inseion device provided along with the IOL. It is then inseed and placed in the posterior chamber in the capsular bag (in-the-bag implantation). Sometimes, a sulcus implantation may be required because of posterior capsular tears or because of zonular dialysis. Because a smaller incision is required, few or no stitches are needed and the patient's recovery time is usually shoer when using a foldable IOL",

        "exp": "Blindness that is the result of destruction of both visual and adjacent regions of the occipital lobes is termed coical or cerebral blindness. Normally the pupil constricts under a bright light (direct reflex), and the other unexposed pupil also constricts (consensual reflex). With complete or nearly complete interruption of the optic nerve, the pupil will fail to react to direct light stimulation; however, the pupil of the blind eye will still show a consensual reflex. Contrariwise, lack of direct and consensual light reflex with retention of the consensual reflex in the opposite eye places the lesion in the efferent limb of the reflex arc. A lesion of the afferent limb of the light reflex pathway will not affect the near responses of the pupil, and lesions of the visual pathway caudal to the point where the light reflex fibers leave the optic tract will not alter the pupillary light reflex.

Causes Hyphemas are frequently caused by injury (blunt trauma) and may paially or completely block vision. Presentation and prognosis Hyphemas may resolve by themselves, they may require medical treatment, or they may result in permanent visual impairment. A long-standing hyphema may result in hemosiderosis and heterochromia. Blood accumulation may also cause an elevation of the intraocular pressure. Treatment The vast majority of hyphemas resolve on their own without complication. Treatment of hyphema consists of 4 major tenets: Light activity or even bedrest (to prevent a rebleed into the anterior chamber, which may cause obstruction of vision, or a painful rise in pressure) Elevation of the head of the bed by approximately 45 degrees (so that the hyphema can settle out inferiorly and avoid obstruction of vision, as well as to facilitate resolution) Wearing of an eye shield at night time (to prevent accidental rubbing of the eyes during sleep, which can precipitate a rebleed) Avoidance of pain medications such as aspirin or ibuprofen (which thin the blood and increase the risk of a rebleed -instead, acetaminophen can be used for pain control).",

Symptom: An attack of amaurosis fugax is typically described by the patients as a cuain that descends from above or ascends from below to occupy the upper or lower halves of their visual fields. Clinical Signs: The attack lasts for two to five minutes and resolves in the reverse pattern of progression, leaving no residual deficit. Due to brief duration of the attack, it is rarely possible to observe the fundus.

B: Strabismus surgery The oculocardiac reflex/ Aschner phenomenon, / Aschner reflex/ Aschner-Dagnini reflex, is a decrease in pulse rate associated with traction applied to extraocular muscles and/or compression of the eyeball. The reflex is mediated by nerve connections between the trigeminal cranial nerve and the vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system. The afferent tracts derive mainly from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. These afferents synapse with the visceral motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, located in the reticular formation of the brain stem. The efferent poion is carried by the vagus nerve from the cardiovascular center of the medulla to the hea, of which increased stimulation leads to decreased output of the sinoatrial node. This reflex is especially sensitive in neonates and children, and must be monitored, usually by an anaesthesiologist, during paediatric ophthalmological surgery, paicularly during strabismus correction surgery. However, this reflex may also occur with adults. Bradycardia, junctional rhythm, asystole, and very rarely death, can be induced through this reflex.",

A: Penetrating Injury of Ciliary Body Sympathetic ophthalmitis or ophthalmia almost always results from a penetrating wound. others Incarceration of the iris or lens capsule is more likely to set up sympathetic ophthalmitis than oers Sympathetic ophthalmia/ SO It is a granulomatous uveitis of both eyes following trauma to one eye. It can leave the patient completely blind. Symptoms may develop from days to several years after a penetrating eye injury. Floating spots and loss of accommodation are among the earliest symptoms. The disease may progress to severe iridocyclitis with pain and photophobia. Commonly the eye remains relatively painless while the inflammatory may occur. disease spreads through the uvea, where characteristic focal infiltrates in the choroid named Dalen-Fuchs nodules can be seen. Papilledema, secondary glaucoma, vitiligo, and poliosis of the eyelashes may accompany SO. In approximately 80% of cases, the uveitis appears within 2-12 weeks after injury, and 90% occur within 1 year from the time of injury. Sympathetic ophthalmia is currently thought to be an autoimmune inflammatory response toward ocular antigens, specifically a delayed hypersensitivity to melanin-containing structures from the outer segments of the photoreceptor layer of the retina. The immune system, which normally is not exposed to ocular antigens, is introduced to the contents of the eye following traumatic injury. Once exposed, it senses these antigens as foreign, and begins attacking them. The onset of this process can be from days to years after the inciting traumatic event. Diagnosis Diagnosis is clinical, seeking a history of eye injury. An impoant differential diagnosis is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH), which is thought to have the same pathogenesis, without a history of surgery or penetrating eye injury. Prevention and treatment Definitive prevention of SO requires prompt (within the first 7 to 10 days following injury) enucleation of the injured eye. Evisceration--the removal of the contents of the globe while leaving the sclera and extraocular muscles intact--is easier to perform, offers long-term orbital stability, and is more aesthetically pleasing. There is concern, however, that evisceration may lead to a higher incidence of SO compared to enucleation The first choice of treatment may not be enucleation or evisceration, especially if there is a chance that the injured eye may regain some function Immunosuppressive therapy is the mainstay of treatment for SO. Mild cases may be treated with local application of coicosteroids and pupillary dilators. More severe or progressive cases require high-dose systemic coicosteroids for months to years. Patients who become resistant to coicosteroids or develop side effects of long-term coicosteroid therapy (osteoporosis and pathologic fractures, mental status changes, etc.), may be candidates for therapy with chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, or ciclosporin.",

        "question": "Not a risk factor of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Diabetes Secondatv retinal detachment may be due to the retina being mechanically pulled away from its bed by the contraction of fibrous tissue in the vitreous, tractional detachment, such as occurs in plastic cyclitis, proliferative retinopathy (diabetes) or the retinopathy of the prematurity Predisposing factors for rhegmatogenous detachment (commonest type) of the retina are myopia, previous intraocular surgery such as aphakia or pseudophakia, a family history of retinal detachment, trauma and inflammation Retinal detachment It is a disorder of the eye in which the retina peels away from its underlying layer of suppo tissue. Initial detachment may be localized, but without rapid treatment the entire retina may detach, leading to vision loss and blindness. It is a medical emergency. Types 1. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment A rhegmatogenous retinal detachment occurs due to a break in the retina that allows fluid to pass from the vitreous space into the subretinal space between the sensory retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. Retinal breaks are divided into three types - holes, tears and dialyses. Holes form due to retinal atrophy especially within an area of lattice degeneration. Tears are due to vitreoretinal traction. Dialyses which are very peripheral and circumferential may be either tractional or atrophic, the atrophic form most often occurring as idiopathic dialysis of the young. 2. Exudative, serous, or secondary retinal detachment An exudative retinal detachment occurs due to inflammation, injury or vascular abnormalities that results in fluid accumulating underneath the retina without the presence of a hole, tear, or break. In evaluation of retinal detachment it is critical to exclude exudative detachment as surgery will make the situation worse, not better. Although rare, exudative retinal detachment can be caused by the growth of a tumor on the layers of tissue beneath the retina, namely the choroid. This cancer is called a choroidal melanoma. 3. Tractional retinal detachment A tractional retinal detachment occurs when fibrous or fibrovascular tissue, caused by an injury, inflammation or neovascularization, pulls the sensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium. Tractional retinal detachments can also occur in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy or those with proliferative retinopathy of sickle cell disease. In proliferative retinopathy, abnormal blood vessels (neovascularization) grow within the retina and extend into the vitreous. In advanced disease, the vessels can pull the retina away from the back wall of the eye, leading to tractional retinal detachment. A minority of retinal detachments result from trauma, including blunt blows to the orbit, penetrating trauma, and concussions to the head. Frequency The incidence of retinal detachment in otherwise normal eyes is around 5 new cases in 100, 000 persons per year. Retinal detachment is more common in people with severe myopia (above 5-6 diopters), in whom the retina is more thinly stretched. About two-thirds of cases of retinal detachment occur in myopics. Retinal detachment is more frequent after surgery for cataracts. Although retinal detachment usually occurs in just one eye, there is a 15% chance of it developing in the other eye, and this risk increases to 30-35% in patients who have had cataracts extracted from both eyes",

Although normally retinal tears are usually peripheral and typically occur in equatorial and ora serrata regions of retina.

The tears are oval and result from tangential traction from proliferative tissue and vitreous. In diabetics, retinal detachment (RD) may be rhegmatogenous (d/t retinal break formation) and nonrhegmatogenos (caused by traction alone). When RD is rhegmatogenous, the borders of elevated retina usually extend to the ora serrata. The retinal surface is dull & grayish and undulates b/o retinal mobility d/t shifting of subretinal fluid. Oval breaks are usually present in the posterior pole. Whereas in non rhegmatogenous (traction) RD, the detached retina is concave toward the pupil with taut and shiny surface. It is usually confined to the posterior fundus and infrequently extends more than 2/3rd of the distance to the equator. No shifting of subretinal fluid occurs. Diabetic retinopathy is usually and hypeensive retinopathy is invariably bilateral. (Kanski-567). So asymmetric involvement (normal fellow eye) almost rules out both.

Diplopia is maximum in the direction of action of paralysed muscle. The patient shifts the head in such direction so that the eye lies in the direction of action of paralysed muscle. Now see the action of various extraocular musles Iam taking example of two muscles, one which acts only in horizontal direction(left lateral rectus) and one which acts in 3 different planes (left superior oblique): Left lateral rectus causes abduction of left eye so, in left lateral rectus palsy, the left eye will be deviated towards the right, diplopia will be maximum on looking horizontally left side (left lateral), and the head will be turned towards the left. In left superior oblique palsy:- i) The left eye will be deviated superiorly and medially (heterotropia, i. e. superior deviation); ii) Diplopia will be maximum while looking right side (left nasal) and inferiorly, i. e. in the direction of left superior oblique action; and iii) The head will be tilted to the left and turned to the right. Point (iii) requires some explanation. In paralysis of horizontaly acting muscles (medial or lateral rectus) the head is only turned. However, in muscles which acts in multiple planes, the head is turned and tilted. For example, take the example of left superior oblique in above figure. Left superior oblique causes depression and inward movement of left eye. So, in its paralysis the patient will require position of head which will compensate for this movement. For depression of left eye, the patient will bend (tilt) the head on left side so that left eye will be in lower (depressed) position. For inward movement, the patient will turn the head to the right side. Now, you can easily understand that in superior oblique palsy, the head will be bend (tilted) on left side and turned towards the right side.",

It is thicker over the anterior surface than the posterior surface. It is thickest at pre- equator region and thinnest at the posterior pole. When an aificial lens replaces the natural lens in cataract surgery (IOL implantation), it is placed in this same capsule. 2) Lens epithelium It is a single layer on the anterior (front) surface of the lens. There is no epithelium on posterior surface. The epithelial cells distribute fluid, ion and glucose through the entire lens. They also create new fibers throughout a person's life. 3) Lens fibres These are long protein fibers that are closely packed and parallel. They make up most of the lens volume and are laid horizontally, front to back, and concentrically like layers of an onion. As the lens fibres are formed throughout the life, these are arranged compactly as nucleus and coex of the lens. a) Nucleus: - It is the central pa containing the oldest fibres. it consists of different zones:- Embryonic nucleus:- Formed at 1-3 months of gestation, therefore consists the oldest primary fibres. Fetal nucleus:- Lies around the embryonic nucleus and is formed from 3 months of gestation till bih. Infantile nucleus:- Corresponding the lens from bih to pubey and surrounds the fetal nucleus. Adults:- Corresponds to the lens fibres formed after pubey to rest of the life. b) Coex:- It is the peripheral pa containg the youngest fibres. The ciliary zonules (Zonules of zinn or suspensory ligaments of lens) hold the lens in position and enable the ciliary muscle to act on it. These consist essentially of a series of fibres which run from the ciliary body and fuse into the outer layer of the lens capsule around the equatorial zone.",

        "exp": "B i. e. Occlusion of one eye Occlusion of the normal eye, to encourage use of the amblyopic eye, is the most effective treatment of amblyopia. Q Occlusion Therapy The sensitive period during which amblyopia can be reserved is upto 7-8 years in strabismic amblyopia & longer (upto 11-12 years) for anisometropic amblyopiaQ. The amblyopia must be detected & treated by 3 or 4 years of age for best results. Q The younger the patient, the more rapid the improvement, although the greater the risk of inducing amblyopia in the normal eye. It is therefore impoant to monitor visual acuity in both eyes during treatment. The better the visual acuity at the sta of occlusion, the shoer the duration required. If there is no improvement after 6 months of occlusion, fuher treatment is unlikely to be fruitful. Duration of occlusion - 1 week for 1 year old child - 2 weeks in 2 year old child - 3 weeks in 3 year old child and so on.",

        "exp": "Patient in the question is showing features of Marcus gunn jaw winking syndrome. It is seen in 5% cases of congenital ptosis. It is characterized by the presence of abnormal synkinetic movement of the upper eyelid with contraction of muscles of mastication, most commonly external pterygoids. The condition is typically unilateral and the lid fold is generally better maintained than in other types of congenital ptosis. It is believed to be due to a congenital error of neuronal wiring in the brainstem. It sometimes occur as an autosomal dominant familial trait. The risk is increased in infants after a pregnant woman uses misoprostol as an aboifacient. Ref: Merritt's Neurology By Lewis P. Rowland, Page 695; Pg Ophthalmology: V.
