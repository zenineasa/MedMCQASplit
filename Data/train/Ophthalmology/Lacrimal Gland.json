Fuch's heterochromic iridocyclitis (Fush's uveitis syndrome)o It is a form of anterior and intermediate uveitis. o The condition is usually unilateral and chronic in nature and is characterized by a chronic non-granulomatous uveitis and eventually results in iris heterochromia (a change in the colour of iris), o The disease has following characteristic features: Heterochromia of iris. Diffuse stromal iris atrophy. Fine KPs at back of cornea. Faint aqueous flare. Absence of posterior synechiaeA fairly common rubeosis iridis, sometimes associated with neovascularisation of the angle of anterior chamber. Comparatively early development of complicated cataract and secondary glaucoma (usually open angle type). Glaucoma has been reported in 10-59% of cases. Treatmento Fuch's heterchromic uveitis responds variable to steroids and cycloplegics. The complications of long term use of these drugs may at times outweigh their potential benefits. Therefore, treatment with topical steroids is given to iritis which is sufficiently active to require the treatment, otherwise the patient is routinely followed without giving any treatment. o Cataract responds well to mostforms of intraocular surgeries, including the standard IOL implantation. Hyphemia may occur because of rubeosis iridis (neovascularization of iris). o Glaucoma control may be somewhat more problematic, with surgical options indicated for later forms of disease.",

(Rest two can only diagnose obstructive cause). Out of these two Dacryoscintigraphy is more specific and further Jones' dye test is useless in cases of complete obstruction. Jones dye test is performed only when partial obstruction is suspected. Let's see the cause of excessive watering. These are only 3 basic causes of excessive watering. Over production of tears. Mechanical obstruction of tear drainage Lacrimal pump failure due to lower lid laxity or weakness of the orbicularis muscle. Lacrimal pump. Eye lids and the orbicularis muscle create a physiological pump which pumps the tears into the two puncta and then finally drain it into the inferior meatus through nasolacrimal duct. Eye lids are opposed against the globe, this creates a capillary action for the tears. Orbicularis muscle's contraction and relaxation creates a negative pressure in the lacrimal sac which sucks in the tears. Dacryoscintigraphy (or radio nucleotide Dacryo cystography). In this test a radioactive tracer (technitium99 or sulphur colloid) is instilled in to the conjunctival sac and its passage through the lacrimal drainage system is visualized with a gamma camera. It can very effectively diagnose lacrimal pump failure.",

        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Massage. REF: Khurana 4th Ed Pg 369. TREATMENT OF CONGENITAL DACROCYSTITIS: It depends upon the age at which the child is brought. The treatment modalities employed are as follows: Massage over the lacrimal sac area and topical antibiotics constitute the treatment of congenital NLD block, up to 6-8 weeks of age. Massage increases the hydrostatic pressure in the sac and helps to open up the membranous occlusions. It should be carried out at least 4 times a day to be followed by instillation of antibiotic drops. This conservative treatment cures obstruction in about 90 percent of the infants. Lacrimal syringing (irrigation) with normal saline and antibiotic solution. It should be added to the conservative treatment if the condition is not cured up to the age of 2 months. Lacrimal irrigation helps to open the membranous occlusion by exerting hydraulic pressure. Syringing may be carried out once or twice a week. Probing of NLD with Bowman's probe. It should be performed, in case the condition is not cured by the age of 3-4 months. Some surgeons prefer to wait till the age of 6 months. It is usually performed under general anaesthesia. While performing probing, care must be taken not to injure the canaliculus. In most instances a single probing will relieve the obstruction. In case of failure, it may be repeated after an interval of 3- 4 weeks. Intubations with silicone tube may be performed if repeated probings are failure. The silicone tube should be kept in the NLD for about six months. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) operations: When the child is brought very late or repeated probing is a failure, then conservative treatment by massaging, topical antibiotics and intermittent lacrimal syringing should be continued till the age of 4 years. After this, DCR operation should be performed.",
