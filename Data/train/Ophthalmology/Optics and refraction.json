        "question": "Emmetropia is associated with",
        "exp": "Emmetropia (optically normal eye) is a state of refraction when the parallel rays of light coming from infinity are focused at the sensitive layer of the retina with accommodation at rest. At bih, the eyeball is relatively sho and thus most infants are born with +2 to +3 D hypermetropia. This is gradually reduced and by the age of 5 to 7 years usually, the eye becomes emmetropic in a person with absent refractive error. Ametropia (a condition of refractive error), is defined as a state of refraction when the parallel rays of light coming from infinity (with accommodation at rest), are focused either in front or behind the sensitive layer of the retina, in one or both the meridians. The ametropia includes myopia, hypermetropia, and astigmatism. Emmetropia is the state of vision in which a faraway object at infinity is in sharp focus with the eye lens in a neutral or relaxed state. That condition of the normal eye is achieved when the refractive power of the cornea and the axial length of the eye balance out, which focuses rays exactly on the retina, resulting in perfect vision. A human eye in a state of emmetropia requires no corrective lenses; the vision scores well on a visual acuity test (such as an eye cha test). For example, on a Snellen cha test, emmetropic eyes score at \"6/6\"(m) or \"20/20\"(ft) vision, meaning that at a distance of 20 ft (the first number) they see as well as a normal eye at a distance of 20 ft (the second number). Either myopic (near-sighted) eyes or hyperopic (far-sighted) eyes would score worse, e. g. 20/40 (visual acuity roughly half normal). Exceptionally acute vision (excellent cornea and lens and better than standard retina) might be 20/15 Emmetropia is the state of the eye in which no refractive error is present, there is no need for glasses or contact lenses. In emmetropia, the curvature of the cornea, the shape of the lens and their distances from each other all work together to focus the rays of light to create a sharp image on the retina Reference: Khurana comprehensive ophthalmology; 4th edition; P: 28, 29",

It should always be carried out after getting a rough estimate of the refractive error by the objective refraction as described above. The proper subjective refraction includes three steps: I. Subjective verification of refraction II. Subjective refinement of refraction, and III. Subjective binocular balancing Subjective binocular balancing: The final step in the subjective refraction is binocular balancing--a process sometimes known as 'equalizing the accommodative effo' or 'equalization of vision'.

These can be grouped as under: 1. Asymptomatic 2. Asthenopic symptoms: These include tiredness of eyes, frontal or a frontotemporal headache, watering and mild photophobia. These asthenopic symptoms are especially associated with near work and increase towards evening. 3. Defective vision with asthenopic symptoms: The patients complain of defective vision which is more for near than distance and is associated with asthenopic symptoms due to sustained accommodative effos. 4. Defective vision only: When the amount of hypermetropia is very high, the patients usually do not accommodate (especially adults) and there occurs marked defective vision for near and distance. Signs 1. Size of the eyeball may appear small as a whole. 2. The cornea may be slightly smaller than the normal. 3. The anterior chamber is comparatively shallow. 4. Fundus examination reveals a small optic disc which may look more vascular with ill-defined margins and even may simulate papillitis (though there is no swelling of the disc, and so it is called pseudopapillitis). The retina as a whole may shine due to the greater brilliance of light reflections (shot silk appearance). 5. A-scan ultrasonography (biometry) may reveal a sho anteroposterior length of the eyeball. Disease Pseudopapilledema is defined as anomalous elevation of one or both optic discs without edema of the retinal nerve fiber layer Papilledema, on the other hand, is a swelling of the optic disc due to increased intracranial pressure. It is impoant to distinguish pseudopapilledema from true papilledema, which can be the first sign of disease process with the potential for vision loss, neurological impairment, or death. Patients thought to have papilledema are often subjected to lumbar puncture, MRI, and extensive laboratory studies to find the underlying cause. In this aicle, we will cover multiple causes of pseudopapilledema and how to differentiate them from true papilledema. Reference: Khurana comprehensive ophthalmology; 4th edition; Page: 29, 30",

Etiological types: 1. Optical aniseikonia: may occur due to either inherent or acquired anisometropia of high degree. 2. Retinal aniseikonia: may develop due to displacement of retinal elements towards the nodal point in one eye due to stretching or oedema of the retina. 3. Coical aniseikonia: implies asymmetrical simultaneous perception inspite of equal size of images formed on the two retinae. Symptoms: 1. Asthenopia, i. e., eyeache, browache and tiredness of eyes. 2. Diplopia due to difficult binocular vision when the difference in images of two eyes is more than 5 percent. 3. Difficulty in depth perception. Figure: Schematic presentation of the ocular sources determining aniseikonia and the visualization of a visual field angle a (for simplicity the optical and visual axis are assumed equal here).
