When a light is shined in her right eye, there is no pupillary response in either eye. However, upon shining a light in her left eye, both ipsilateral and contralateral pupillary responses are apparent. Her extraocular movements are intact. What is the MOST likely location of her lesion?",
        "exp": "This woman has a \"Marcus-Gunn pupil,\" with a defect in the afferent pathway of the optic nerve (in this case on the right side). Recall that the afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is the optic nerve (CN II); the efferent limb is the oculomotor nerve (CN III; parasympathetic fibers). When light is shined into her right eye, because her right optic nerve is not functioning properly, the light signal is not transmitted to the CNS, resulting in no pupillary response. As light is shined into her left eye, the left optic nerve transmits the signal to the CNS, which then sends an outbound signal through both the right and left oculomotor nerves to cause pupillary constriction in both eyes. Must know: The occulomotor nerve innervates all extraocular muscles except the lateral rectus (innervated by the abducens nerve), and the superior oblique (innervated by the trochlear nerve). The oculomotor nerve also mediates pupillary constriction (parasympathetic fibers), eyelid opening (levator palpebrae), and innervates the ciliary muscle (allowing accommodation). A patient with a lesion of the left optic nerve would have no pupillary responses in either eye when shining a light in the left eye; pupillary responses would be present in both eyes when shining a light in the right eye.

Etiology The lens is composed largely of crystallins which aggregate in cataract formation. There are many associations with posterior subcapsular cataracts including chronic vitreal inflammation, ionizing radiation, trauma and prolonged use of coicosteroids. Clinical Findings Younger individuals may be affected and the symptoms include complaints of glare at night with bright headlights or poor vision with accommodation. Near vision may often be more affected than distance vision. Usually the earliest sign is a focal dot-like area on the posterior capsule or a reflective sheen. With progression, translucent opacities appear (the swollen Wedl cells) on the posterior capsule that have been likened to a \"cloth of gold\" or \"fish eggs\". Posterior capsular cataract is associated with coical degeneration and nuclear sclerosis.

Thus, eyeball is depressed and elevation is not possible. Thyroid ophthalmopathy Thyroid ophthalmopathy, also called thyroid orbitopathy, is a disease of the orbit seen in Graves disease (thyrotoxicosis), therefore also called Graves ophthalmopathy. However it may also occur rarely in Euthyroid person, primary hypehyroidism and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thyroid ophthalmopathy is characterized by enlargement of ocular fat and enlargement of extraocular muscles(PG'\") due to deposition of mucopolysaccharides. Clinical features are :- The most common and earliest symptom is upper eyelid retraction. Exophthalmos (Proptosis) Proptosis is the second most common symptom.Thyroid ophthalmopathy is the most common cause of proptosis, whether unilateral or bilateral in adults. Proptosis may be :- i) Mild exophthalmos :- In hypehyroidis (thyrotoxicosis, Graves disease) Extreme exophthalmos :- In hypothyroidism' Restrictive extraocular myopathy :- Enlargement of extraocular muscle without enlargement of tendon is the hallmark of thyroid ophthalmopathy. This distribution of extraocular muscle swelling is typical of thyroid ophthalmopathy. The extraocular muscles involvement in order of decreasing frequency is : Inferior rectus (most commonly involved)> Medial rectus > Superior rectus< Lateral rectus< obliques. It is woh noting that this is restrictive myopathy and the muscle becomes thickened & scarred with detion of eye towards the direction of action of muscle and there is restriction of movement in the direction opposite to the action of the involved muscle, though the opposite muscle is normal. For example in medial rectus involvement eye may be deted medial and abduction will be restricted though the lateral rectus is normal External ophthalmoplegia :- Thyroid ophthalmopathy can cause veical diplopia due to paralysis of veical acting muscles like inferior oblique.",

Morax (1896) published a sho paper in which he recorded all the essential points of a disease which he named \"conjunctivite aigue\". The following month in the same year Axenfeld presented his independent investigations at the International Congress of Heidelberg 1896 calling the condition 'chronic diplobacillary conjunctivitis'. The organism soon became known as Morax Axenfeld diplobacillus. Eyre (1900) applied the name lacunatus because of its tendency to form lacunae or pits in Loeffler's solid medium. Persons of every age and race may be affected but the adults especially the aged and debilitated are attacked most commonly.

The most common source of embolus is an atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid aery or aoa.

Patients describe a rapid fading of vision like a cuain descending, sometimes affecting only a poion of the visual field. If the embolus breaks up or passes, flow is restored and vision returns quickly to normal without permanent damage. With prolonged interruption of blood flow, the inner retina suffers infarction.

Therefore the two main predisposing factors for bacterial corneal ulcer are : - Damage to corneal epithelium Infection of the eroded area However, there are a few species that are capable of penetrating an intact epithelium : - Neisseria gonorrhoea Neisseria meningitidis Corynebacterium diphtheriae Listeria species Haemophilus agyptus Bacteria which cause corneal ulcer (Purulent keratitis) after epithelial injuries are : - Pseudomonas Pneumococcus Streptococcus epidermidis Staphylococcus aureus Morexella Enterobacterias Proteus, Klebsiella) Although there are specific presentations depending on the bacteria involved, there exists a series of symptoms and signs common to all that allow for a rapid diagnosis, and therefore early treatment of corneal ulcers.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Miosis is commonly seen Angle-recession glaucoma is classified as a type of traumatic secondary open-angle glaucoma. This condition may be underdiagnosed because onset is often delayed and because a history of eye injury may be distant or forgotten. Unilateral elevation of IOP is a hallmark finding in angle-recession glaucoma, but it may not be noted in early stages of the disorder. High IOPs noted early after injury (within the first few months of injury) may indicate extensive trabecular damage and a poor prognosis. Angle recession is typically diagnosed by means of gonioscopy. Angle recession is more than 180 degrees The clinical appearance of the affected angle varies with the depth of the tear in the ciliary body and with the amount of time passed after the injury. Typically, an irregularly wide ciliary body band is visible with retroplacement of the iris root. The angle appears abnormally deep in the involved areas. This characteristic appearance is due to a cleavage between the longitudinal and circular muscles of the ciliary body. After years of healing, the fissure may no longer be visible. In fact, when many years have passed after the contusional injury, angle recession may be difficult to recognize. A large series of blunt injuries among soccer players found that angle recession is more likely to occur in the superotemporal quadrant. Ipsilateral anterior chamber depth may be increased following a contusion injury even if other signs of angle recession are absent. Angle recession should be differentiated from cyclodialysis, which is the disinseion of the ciliary body from its attachment to the scleral spur. A number of anterior segment abnormalities often accompany angle recession: Cyclodialysis Iridodialysis Iridoschisis Anterior synechia Iris sphincter tears Mydriasis Iris atrophy Transillumination defects Iritis Zonular breaks Phacodonesis Subluxated lens Cataract",

        "exp": "Ans. c. Glaucomatocyclitic crisis The most likely diagnosis in a 25-year-old young adult with painless red eye with 10P of 60 mmHg is glaucomatocyclitic crisis. `Unilateral attacks of mild non-granulomatous anterior uveitis with elevations in 10P are the hallmark of Posner Schlossman syndrome (PSS). Acute attacks of glaucomatocyclitic crisis last from a few hours to several weeks and may be recurrent. Between episodes, lOP and aqueous outflow facility return to normal.' Posner Schlossman syndrome Unilateral attacks of mild non-granulomatous anterior uveitis with elevations in lOP are the hallmark of Posner Schlossman syndrome (PSS). It is also called as glaucomatocyclitic crisis. Acute attacks of glaucomatocyclitic crisis last from a few hours to several weeks and may be recurrent Between episodes, lop and aqueous outflow facility return to normal. Clinical Features: Episodic unilateral mild anterior uveitis, photophobia, reduced vision and colored rings around lights (from secondary corneal edema)Q. Symptoms of an acute attack of PSS may include unilateral blurred vision and pain. Clinical exam reveals mild anterior chamber reaction and small to medium sized non- granulomatous keratic precipitatesQ There may also be associated corneal edema, which resolves with lowering of the 10P. Intraocular pressure elevation is usually as high as 40-60 mmHg, which is due to blockage of the trabecular meshwork with mononuclear cellsQ Treatment: The aim of treatment is to address the anterior segment inflammation and lower 10PQ. Topical steroids and ocular hypotensive medications are sufficient to control these attacks but not to prevent Without intervention, these attacks usually resolve.",

Panuveitis is commonly caused by VKH syndrome, sympathetic ophthalmia, sarcoidosis, syphilis, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, toxocariasisQ and endophthalmitis. Ocular Toxoplasmosis Ocular toxoplasmosis presents with necrotizing chorio-retinitis (destroying choroid & retina producing punched out heavily pigmented macular scar), satellite lesion (solitary inflammatory focus near old pigmented scar), spill over anterior uveitis (may be granular resembling Fuchs syndrome) and severe vitritis (so dense as to prohibit an adequate view of posterior segment i.e. head light in fog appearance). It usually presents in infants or adults between ages of 10-and 35 years. Bilateral macular involvement is common (in immune compromised). - Diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis is often made by clinical features alone. Active toxoplasmosis typically manifests localized necrotizing retinitis. The classical lesion is a grey white focus of retinal necrosis at the edge of pre existing pigmented chorioretinal scar. The entire thickness of choroid and retina is destroyed in a necrotizing inflammation so that a punched out heavily pigmented scar remains (often misdiagnosed White dot syndromes are caused by inflammation at the level of choriocapillaries resulting in non perfusion as congenital coloboma). In infants it is frequently a/w acute illness, convulsions, meningeal changes, hydrocephalus, calcification in brain and mental retardation. Diagnostic tests include demonstration of parasite, Sabin-Feldman dye test (serological test require live T. gondii organism with a titer >1:16), complement fixation test, indirect hemagglutination test and ELISA for IgG & IgM. - and secondary changes of choroid & outer retina. It includes multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS), acute idiopathic blind spot enlargement syndrome, acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis, punctuate inner choroidopathy, serpiginous choroidopathy, progressive subretinal fibrosis and uveitis syndrome, acute macular neuroretinopathy, and acute zonal occult outer retinopathy. - MEWDS is usually unilateral, self limiting disease predominantly involving females in 3,1-4th decade with sudden onset of decreased central vision & photopsia. It presents with mild vitritis, numerous tiny deep ill defined grey white dots at posterior pole and mid periphery. The blind spot is enlarged. The macula is spared but has a characteristic granular orange appearance which renders the foveal reflex abnormal or absent( 2. Over several weeks central vision recovers, dots fade. Fovea granularity may remain and enlarged blind spot may take much longer to diminish in size. Multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis is usually bilateral, recurrent / chronic, frequently asymmetrical disease that predominantly affects myopic females in their 3rd -4th decade with blurring of central vision, floater and photopsia. It presents with vitritis (universal), anterior uveitis (50%), and active lesions (bilateral, multiple, discrete, ovoid, yellowish grey) involving the posterior pole & periphery and arranged in clumps or linear streaks (Schlagel lines). Inactive lesions have sharp punched out margins and pigmented borders. Mild disc edema, disc enlargement and peripapillary fibrosis simulating napkin holder may develop.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Tissue adhesive glue Bacterial corneal ulcer requires intensive foified antibiotic therapy to treat the infection. Fungal corneal ulcers require intensive application of topical anti-fungal agents. Viral corneal ulceration caused by herpes virus may respond to antivirals like topical acyclovir ointment instilled at least five times a day. Alongside, suppoive therapy like pain medications are given, including topical cycloplegics like atropine or homatropine to dilate the pupil and thereby stop spasms of the ciliary muscle. All forced expiration like blowing the nose, coughing etc. must be avoided. Proper nutrition, including protein intake and Vitamin C are usually advised. In cases of Keratomalacia, where the corneal ulceration is due to a deficiency of Vitamin A, supplementation of the Vitamin A by oral or intramuscular route is given. Drugs that are usually contraindicated in corneal ulcer are topical coicosteroids and anesthetics - these should not be used on any type of corneal ulcer because they prevent healing, may lead to superinfection with fungi and other bacteria Fuher option is the use of a tissue adhesive such as N-butyl 2-ethyl cyanoacrylate monomer which is applied to the area of perforation after careful debridement. Drying of the adhesive may take few minutes after which anterior chamber may reform. Following this, a continuous-wear soft contact lens can be applied or a definite surgical procedure such as therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty or conjunctival flap undeaken. Superficial ulcers may heal in less than a week.",

Rod cone type : - It is the usual pattern. Rods are degenerated early and cones are involved late. Degeneration stas in a zone near the equator and gradually spreading anteriorly and posteriorly. The macular region is not affected until a late stage. The rods are responsible for the vision in dim light, dark adaptation, and peripheral vision, therefore, symptoms due to their degeneration are : - Nightblindness (or nyctalopia), i.e., defective vision in dim light, is the earliest feature. Defective dark adaptation (later) Loss of peripheral vision with preservation of central vision till late- Tubular (tunnel) vision. Mid-peripheral ring scotoma(annular scotoma) because the maximum density of rods occurs in mid-periphery. Ultimately central vision is also lost after many years. Cone-rod type : - Cones are degenerated early. As cones are responsible for vision in bright light, colour vision and central vision, the symptoms of this type of retinitis pigmentosa are reduction in central acuity, colour vision defect and defective vision in bright light. At least some peripheral vision is retained till very late",

Patients present with some degree of unilateral visual dysfunction, visual field loss, afferent pupillary defect, decreased ocular motility, optic atrophy, pain headache and nystagmus. Proptosis is often the chief complaint of an orbital glioma. Nystagmus may also occur. Other late features of optic nerve glioma are neovascular glaucoma, anterior segment ischemia and hemorrhagic glaucoma from retinal vascular occlusion.

B: Uncrossed diplopia The abducens nerve/ abducent nerve/sixth cranial nerve/sixth nerve /VI is a \"somatic efferent\" nerve that controls the movement of a single muscle, the lateral rectus muscle of the eye. Complete interruption of the peripheral sixth nerve causes diplopia (double vision), due to the unopposed action of the medial rectus muscle. The affected eye is pulled medially. In order to see without double vision, patients will rotate their heads so that both eyes are looking sideways. On formal testing, the affected eye cannot abduct past the midline - it cannot look sideways, toward the temple. Paial damage to the sixth nerve causes weak or incomplete abduction of the affected eye. The diplopia is worse on attempted lateral gaze, as would be expected (since the lateral gaze muscle is impaired). Isolated sixth nerve palsies in children are assumed to be due to brain tumors until proven otherwise. The most common overall cause of sixth nerve impairment is diabetic neuropathy. The long course of the abducens nerve between the brainstem and the eye makes it vulnerable to injury at many levels:",

It shows focal leakage of fluorescein in following two patterns : ? Ink-blot pattern or enlarging dot sign :- A small hyperfluorescent spot which gradually increases in size. Smoke-stack pattern :- Small hyperfluorescent spot which ascends veically like a smoke stack and gradually spreads laterally to take a mushroom or umbrella configration",

        "question": "Which of the following does not handle free radicals in the lens of the eye?",
        "exp": "Proteins in the lens are unusually long lived and are thus subject to extensive and accumulated oxidative damage. The damaged proteins accumulate, aggregate, and precipitate; causing the lens to loose its transparency. Of critical impoance is the decrease in the Na+/K+ ATPase, resulting in the inability to maintain steady concentrations of Na+, K+, and Ca++within the lens. The decreased activity of this enzyme is thought to be associated with oxidative damage to the sulfhydryl poions of the molecule, usually protected by the interaction of several antioxidants, especially glutathione (GSH), ascorbate, superoxide, dismutase (SOD), and catalase. Like the processes leading to ARMD, senile cataracts are the result of years of damage and accumulated oxidation. Several reviews are available that discuss the relationship between cataracts and oxidative damage. Antioxidants in the eye Ascorbate (Vitamin C) Catalase Superoxide dysmutase (SOD) Glutathione (GSH) d-alpha-tocoferol (Vit E) Lipoic acid Microelements required : Zn, Cu and Mn Carotene Ubiquinone Ginko biloba extract is known to be anti-oxidant. Free radicals are highly reactive molecular species with an unpaired electron. They can react with, and modify, proteins, nucleic acids and fatty acids in cell membranes and plasma lipoproteins. Radical damage to lipids and proteins in plasma lipoproteins is a factor in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary aery disease; radical damage to nucleic acids may induce heritable mutations and cancer; radical damage to proteins may lead to the development of autoimmune diseases.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Subjective refining Subjective refraction Subjective refraction is meant for finding out the most suitable lenses to be prescribed. The proper subjective refraction includes three steps. 1)Subjective verification of refraction It is done by `trial and-error 'methods. In this one eye is occluded and the appropriate lens combination (as indicated by retinoscopy or refractometry) is placed in front of the other eye. By increasing or decreasing the power of lens, the most suitable spherical lens is chosen. The strongest convex lens and the weakest concave lens providing best vision should be chosen in patients with hypermetropia and myopia respectively. 2)Subjective refining of refraction The most suitable combination of lenses chosen after the subjective verification of refraction is refined before final prescription is made. It is always better to first refine the cylinder and then sphere. A) Refining the cylinder : - Cylinder can be refined by either crosscylinder or by astigmatic fan test. Jackson's crosscylinder test (more commonly used) Crosscylinder is used to verify the strength and axis of the cylinder prescribed. The cross cylinder is a mixed combination of various strengths in which spherical component is one half the power of the cylindrical and of opposite sign to with the axis at right angles. The most convenient form is a combination of a -0.5 D sphere with a +1.0 D cylinder which has an effective strength of + 0.5 D cylinder in one meridian and - 0.5 D cylinder in the meridian perpendicular to the first. The cross-cylinder is identified by the strength of its cylinderical component. So, above described cross cylinder is referred as + 0.5 crosscylinder. Thus, cross cylinder has following feature : - It has one spherical and one cylinderical lens. This combination creates two cylinders of equal strength but with opposite sign placed with their axes at right angle to each other. Astigmatic fan test : - It is used to confirm the cylindrical correction. B) Refining the sphere : - After refining the cylindrical power and axis, the spherical correction is refined by : - The fogging technique, Duochrome test, Pin-hole test. 3)Subjective binocular balancing The final step in the subjective refraction is binocular balancing, i.e., 'equalization of vision ' or 'equalizing the accommodative effo'.

Mostly d/t trauma, TB, syphilis or extension of inflammation from neightbouring tissue. Deep orbit involvement causes less definite signs. There may be pain of deep seated nature, proptosis with detion of direction of eye If apex of orbit is involved (orbital apex syndrome) various ocular motor palsies may develop with trigeminal anaesthesia & neuralgia and occasionly amaurosis d/t involvement of optic nerveQ. Orbital Cellulitis (OC) It is a purulent inflammation of cellular tissue of orbit. It is most common d/t extension of inflammation from neighbouring tissue esp nasal sinuses (mc. ethmoid). Other less common causes are penetrating injuries (esp with retained foreign body with in 72 hours), septic operations, posterior extension of suppurative infections of eyelids or eyeball eg panopthalmitis, facial erysipelas, or dacrocystitis, metastases in pyaemia Preseptal orbital cellulites involves structures anterior to orbital septum i.e. largely lids and presents as a swelling of lids, with erythema, chemosis and conjunctival discharge. But there is no proptosis, or restriction of ocular movements or visual function. However, orbital cellulites term is reserved for infections behind the orbital septum which may or may not spill over to lids. Bacterial OC is more common in children and fulminant infection (& ischemic infarction) with Mucor or Aspergillus typically affects patients with diabetes (esp ketoacidosis) and immunosuppression. Presentation is Extensive swelling of lids with chemosis often obscure proptosis (i.e. most commonly lateral & downwards). Proptosis with impaired mobility resulting in diplopia Pain is severe, increased by movement of eye or pressure Unilateral, tender, warm & red periorbital edema. Painful opthalmoplegia Rapid onset of severe malaise, fever, pain Vision may be impaired owing to retrobulbar optic neuritis or compression of otic nerve or its blood supply at the apex of orbit Fundus is difficult to examine; it may be normal or show engorgement of veins and optic neuritis developing later into optic atrophy. Orbit abscess usually pointing, towards skin of lid near orbital margin or conjunctival fornix is rare in sinus related but common in post traumatic or post operative cases. Panopthalmitis may supervene & there is grave danger of Meningitis, cerebral symptoms and cavernous sinus thrombosis, (CST). CST should be suspected when there is evidence of bilateral involvement, rapidly progressive proptosis, and congestion of facial, conjunctival and retinal veins. Additional features include abrupt progression of clinical signs a/w prostration, severe headache, nausea and vomittingQ. Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis Infection may occur obital veins, as in septic lesions of face, orbital cellulites, erysipelas, and infective conditions of mouth, pharynx, ear, nose and accessory sinuses, or as a metastasis in infectious diseases or septic condition. The patient presents with almost same features as in orbital cellulites, but with systemic symptoms such as fever, rigors, vomiting, headache, altered sensorium and severe cerebral symptomsQ. Another impoant diagnostic feature is transference of symptoms to the fellow eye 0, which occurs in 50% of cases where as bilateral orbital cellulitis is very rare. The first sign of other eye involvement is often paralysis of the opposite lateral rectus Q & this should be carefully watched for in any suspicious case of inflammatory unilateral proptosis. These is severe supra orbital pain d/t involvement of ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve, and paresis of ocular motor nerves. In later stages pupil is dilated, eye immobilized and cornea anesthetic. Proptosis occurs in almost all cases, but is of late onset in cases of otic origin. Retinal veins may be greathy engorged and when this occurs it is usually accompanied by pronounced disc swelling (both indicating extensive implication of orbital veins) Bilateral (but more pronounced on the side of aural lesion), typical papilledema is most common in otitic cases & indicate meningitis or cerebral abscess Simultaneous bilateral CST, with proptosis and disc swelling, occurs in disease of sphenoid sinuses. Edema in the mastoid region behind the ear (d/t thrombosis of emissary vein) confirms the diagnosis.

Many pyogenic organisms (Staphylococcus, streptococci, gonococci, Moraxella) and fungi may produce hypopyon but by far the most dangerous are pseudomonas pyogenea and pneumococcus. Thus, any corneal ulcer may be associated with hypopyon, however, it is customary to reserve the term 'hypopyon corneal ulcer' for the characteristic ulcer caused by pneumococcus and the term 'corneal ulcer with hypopyon' for the ulcers associated with hypopyon due to other causes. The characteristic hypopyon corneal ulcer caused by pneumococcus is called \"ulcus serpens\" . It is woh noting that the hypopyon in bacterial causes is sterile since the outpouring of polymorphonuclear cells is due to toxin and not due to actual invasion by bacteria. On the other hand, hypopyon in fungal (mycotic) corneal ulcer is non-sterile as there is direct invasion by fungi.",

        "question": "Which is the most common early feature of diabetic retinopathy: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Dot and blot hemorrhages Ophthalmoscopically, the earliest change of background diabetic retinopathy characteristically affects the smaller blood vessels. Small dot and blot haemorrhages are common Diabetic retinopathy It is retinopathy (damage to the retina) caused by complications of diabetes mellitus, which can eventually lead to blindness. It is an ocular manifestation of systemic disease which affects up to 80% of all patients who have had diabetes for 10 years or more. Signs and symptoms Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. As new blood vessels form at the back of the eye as a pa of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), they can bleed (ocular hemorrhage) and blur vision. In most cases, it will leave just a few specks of blood, or spots, floating in a person's visual field, though the spots often go away after a few hours. On funduscopic exam, one see cotton wool spots, flame hemorrhages (similar lesions are also caused by the alpha-toxin of Clostridium novyi), and dot-blot hemorrhages. Elevation of blood-glucose levels can also cause edema (swelling) of the crystalline lens (hyperphacosorbitomyopicosis) as a result of sorbitol (sugar alcohol) accumulating in the lens. This edema often causes temporary myopia (nearsightedness). A common sign of hyperphacosorbitomyopicosis is blurring of distance vision while near vision remains adequate. Pathogenesis Diabetic retinopathy is the result of microvascular retinal changes. Hyperglycemia-induced intramural pericyte death and thickening of the basement membrane lead to incompetence of the vascular walls. These damages change the formation of the blood-retinal barrier and also make the retinal blood vessels become more permeable. During the initial stage, called nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), most people do not notice any change in their vision. Early changes that are reversible and do not threaten central vision are sometimes termed simplex retinopathy or background retinopathy. Some people develop macular edema. It occurs when the damaged blood vessels leak fluid and lipids onto the macula. The fluid makes the macula swell, which blurs vision. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) (or PDRP) As the disease progresses, severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy enters an advanced, or proliferative, stage when blood vessels proliferate (i.e. grow). The lack of oxygen in the retina causes fragile, new, blood vessels to grow along the retina and in the clear, gel-like vitreous humour that fills the inside of the eye. Without timely treatment, these new blood vessels can bleed, cloud vision, and destroy the retina. Fibrovascular proliferation can also cause tractional retinal detachment. The new blood vessels can also grow into the angle of the anterior chamber of the eye and cause neovascular glaucoma. Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy shows up as cotton wool spots, or microvascular abnormalities or as superficial retinal hemorrhages. Risk factors All people with diabetes mellitus are at risk - those with Type I diabetes (juvenile onset) and those with Type II diabetes (adult onset). The longer a person has diabetes, the higher the risk of developing some ocular problem. People with Down's syndrome, who have three copies of chromosome 21, almost never acquire diabetic retinopathy. This protection appears to be due to the elevated levels of endostatin, an anti-angiogenic protein, derived from collagen XVIII. The collagen XVIII gene is located on chromosome 21. Management There are three major treatments for diabetic retinopathy, which are very effective in reducing vision loss from this disease. These three treatments are laser surgery, injection of triamcinolone into the eye, and vitrectomy. Although these treatments are very successful (in slowing or stopping fuher vision loss), they do not cure diabetic retinopathy. Laser photocoagulation It is widely used for early stages of proliferative retinopathy. Panretinal photocoagulation Panretinal photocoagulation, or PRP (also called scatter laser treatment), is used to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The goal is to create 1,600 - 2,000 burns in the retina with the hope of reducing the retina's oxygen demand, and hence the possibility of ischemia. Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide Triamcinolone is a long acting steroid preparation. When injected in the vitreous cavity, it decreases the macular edema (thickening of the retina at the macula) caused due to diabetic maculopathy, and results in an increase in visual acuity. The effect of triamcinolone is transient, lasting up to three months, which necessitates repeated injections for maintaining the beneficial effect. Complications of intravitreal injection of triamcinolone include cataract, steroid-induced glaucoma and endophthalmitis. Vitrectomy Instead of laser surgery, some people require a vitrectomy to restore vision. A vitrectomy is performed when there is a lot of blood in the vitreous. It involves removing the cloudy vitreous and replacing it with a saline solution.",

In hypermetropia, there is an axial shoening of eyeball. So, image is formed behind the retina. In myopia, there is an axial lengthening of eyeball. So, image is formed in front of the retina. 1 mm change in axial length leads to ametropia of 3D. For example 1 mm shoening in axial length causes hypermetropia of 3D. 2) Curvature Change in the curvature of cornea or lens will cause ametropia. In hypermetropia, the curvature of cornea or lens is lesser than normal. In myopia, there is increase in curvature of cornea or lens./ mm change in corneal curvature leads to 6-7 D ametropia. 3) Index If refractive index of optical system is low, it will result in hypermetropia and high refractive index will result in myopia. 4) Positional (Due to relative position of the lens), A forward shift of lens causes myopia, backward shift result in hypermetropia. Absence of lens (aphakia) causes hypermetropia. 5) Excessive accommodation Excessive accommodation due to spasm of accommodation causes myopia.",

Cataracts may occur as a consequence of diabetes mellitus, long-term steroids, or congenital infections. They are successfully treated at present with lens extractions and implantation of prosthetic lenses. Note: Aqueous humor is continually replaced due to active secretion by the ciliary body. As such, it does not undergo opacification; it is in constant flux. Corneal opacification is generally a consequence of squamous metaplasia, in which the transparent, non-keratinized, squamous cells are replaced by opaque, keratinized, squamous cells. Squamous metaplasia is a reparative process, usually due to friction injury to the cornea or vitamin A deficiency. The optic nerve is not transparent, and it does not undergo opacification injury. It may, however, atrophy due to ischemic, traumatic, infective, or metabolic insults. Ref: Harper R.A., Shock J.P. (2011). Chapter 8. Lens. In P. Riordan-Eva, E.T.

Vision is rarely diminished by these deposits, and if it is, discontinuation of the drug therapy will cause regression of the deposits with eventual return to normal beginning. The deposits look similar to those seen in chloroquine toxicity and Fabry's glycolipidosis. Other adverse effects repoed in the include thyroidopathy, cutaneous pigmentation, and neuromyopathy. Antimalarial drugs including Chloroquine, quinacrine, and hydroxychloroquine can cause changes in the cornea. Symptoms such as halos around lights, glare and light sensitivity may occur.

People with coical cataracts experience glare from oncoming car headlights which can incapacitate them leading on to what is known as \"nonocular diplopia\" - seeing a single object double with the affected eye, the other eye being closed. As the lens continues to take up water it may swell and become an intumescent cataract, still later it forms a total white opacity called mature cataract and finally become Hypermature cataract. The proteins leak out leaving behind a shrunken -Posterior subcapsular cataract - Patients develop a greater decrease in near vision than distant vision. Phacolytic glaucoma is associated with a damaged lens/if lens protein from a hypermature cataract escape into the aqueous. Phacomorphinc glaucoma occurs when the swollen lens (intumescent stage) obliterates the drainage angle by forcing the root of the iris against the cornea.
