        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e. Excimer laser Photocoagulation in diabetic retinopathyo It remains the mainstay of treatment of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic maculopathy. o Photocoagulation is done by using laser with long wavelength, such as krypton or diode argon (81 Onm): -a) Focal laser photocoagulation and Grid pattern photocoagulation - For clinically significant macular edema. b) Panretinal photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathyo Recently double frequency Nd: YAG is being preferred for both.

Non-surgical: - Most commonly used method for treatment of myopia is correction by concave (divergent or minus) lens. These may be spectacles (most commonly used method for low myopia i. e., < -3D) or contact lens. Keep in mind that though most commonly used method is spectacles, the preferred treatment is contact lens. Refractive surgery: - The most common procedures are performed with an excimer laser. LASIK is the most commonly used procedure. Orthokeratology: - is a non-surgical procedure where special contact lenses are worn that slowly reshape the cornea over time to correct myopia. o High myopia is defined as myopia > -6 D. Treatment of choice for high myopia is contact lens. LASIK is an alternative.",
