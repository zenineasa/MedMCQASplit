Signs of acute inflammation are not present. o Swelling is slightly away from lid margin. o Occasionally, it may present on the intermarginal strip, i. e. marginal chalazion. o Often chalazion slowly increases in size to become very large and causes blurred vision from induced astigmatism (due to compression on cornea) or eversion of the punctum. Rarely, complete resolution may occur. o Recurrence may occur in seborrhoeic dermatitis, acne rosacea and malignant change. o Secondary malignancy caused by chalagion is Meibomian gland adenocarcinoma (sebaceous cell carcinoma).

        "exp": "Ans. b (Glands of Zeis or Moll) (Ref. Parson's diseases of Eye 22nd/p 467).# An infection of a Zeis gland is known as a \"hordeolum\" or \"stye. \"# A chalazion is the result of obstruction of the duct of a meibomian gland, which is usually idiopathic, with secondary lipogranulomatous inflammation.# A stye (external hordeolum) is acute inflammation of the Zeis or Moll glands with pain and swelling.# Similarly painful inflammation of the meibomian glands is called an internal hordeolum. TEAR FILM# The lipid component of the tear film is produced by sebaceous glands known as \"Meibomian\" glands (located in the tarsal plates along the eyelid margins) and the glands of \"Zeis\" (which open into the hair follicles of the eyelashes).# Below the lipid layer is located the lacrimal or aqueous layer of the tear film.# This middle layer is the thickest of the three tear layers, and it is formed primarily by the glands of \"Krause\" and \"Wolfring\" and secondarily by the \"lacrimal\" gland, all of which are located in the eyelids. HORDEOLUM# Definition: Hordeolum is an acute bacterial infection of one or more eyelid glands.# Epidemiology and etiology: Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of hordeolum. Hordeolum is often associated with diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, or acne.# Symptoms and diagnostic considerations:- Hordeolum presents as painful nodules with a central core of pus.- External hordeolum appears on the margin of the eyelid where the sweat glands are located.- Internal hordeolum of a sebaceous gland is usually only revealed by everting the eyelid and usually accompanied by a more severe reaction such as conjunctivitis or chemosis of the bulbar conjunctiva.- Pseudoptosis and swelling of the preauricular lymph nodes may also occur.# Rx:- Antibiotic ointments and application of dry heat (red heat lamp) will rapidly heal the lesion. CHALAZIONDefinition: Is a chronic granulomatous inflammation of the meibomian gland. Clinical features# There is no age or sex predisposition.# There is a higher incidence of chalazion in seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea, and diabetes mellitus.# The appearance is of a pale, round, firm lesion of the lid.# Astigmatism with a reduction in vision can be induced by pressure on the eyeball. Treatment# An intralesional injection of triamcinolone acetonide may help in the resolution of smaller chalazia. If the chalazion does not resolve, or there is a large chalazion, it should be incised and curetted.# Very hard chalazia are occasionally met with, particularly near the canthi, which may be adenomata of the glands and require excision. Malignant changes occur but are rare. However, in all cases with recurrences or those occurring in elderly individuals, the lesion should be biopsied to rule out a meibomian cell carcinoma. Q",
