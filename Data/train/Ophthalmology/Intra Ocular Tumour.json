        "exp": "Ans. is 'a1 i. e., Children RETINOBLASTOMAo Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular tumor in children. The tumor is confined to infancy and very young children (1-2 years). There is no sex predisposition. Retinoblastoma is unilateral in 70-75% of cases and bilateral in 25-30% of cases. Etiologyo Retinoblastoma gene (RB gene) is located on 14 band on the long arm of chromosome 12 (13ql4). RB gene is a tumor supressor gene. Retinoblastoma develops when both the normal alleles of the RB genes are inactived or altered. Ai is typical example of Knudson's two hit hypothesis. In Hereditary retinoblastoma first genetic change (first hit) in RB gene is inherited from an affected parent, where as second mutation (second hit) occurs in postnatal life and both alleles are lost. In non- hereditary retinoblastoma, both mutations (first and second hits) occur postnataly. Pathologyo The tumor arises from smalt round cells with large nuclei, i. e., it is a tumor of a group called small round blue cell tumors. Microscopic features of a well differentiated tumor include Flexner- wintersteiner rosettes (specific for retinoblastoma), Homer- wright rosettes, pseudorosettes and fleurettes formation. There are areas of necrosis and calcification. Clinical featureso Retinoblastoma can present with following features. Leukocoria or amauratic cat's eye reflex this is the most common manifestation. The leukocoria or the white glow' in the pupil is caused by reflection of light from the white intraocular tumor. Strabismus - second most common manifestation. Secondary' glaucoma. Redeye.

Painful red eye usually associated with pseudohypopyon and or hyphaemia (picture simulating iridocyclitis), o Spread of retinoblastoma to distant structures occurs. Direct extension by continuity to the optic nerve and brain is common. Therefore, after enucleation optic nerve is always examined to see invasion of optic nerve, which helps to decide about postoperative chemoradiation. Lymphatic spread to preauricular lymph nodes.

The most common mode of spread of retinoblastoma is by optic nerve invasion. Direct extension by continuity to the optic nerve and brain is common. \"Retinoblastoma is a primary malignant intraocular neoplasm that arises from immature retmoblasts within the developing retina. It is the most common primary intraocular malignancy of childhood in all-racial groups. The neoplasm has strong tendencies to invade the brain via the optic nerve and metastasize widely. \"--Yanoff and Duker 4/e p793. Retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is common congenital malignant tumor arising from the Neurosensory retina. QMC congenital intraocular tumor of childhood. QOccurring 1 in 15, 000-20, 000 live births. Though congenital, usually seen between 1-2 years of age. QBilateral in 25-30% cases90% are sporadic; 10% are familial. Genetics: Rb gene is located on chromosome 13q14. QRb gene is a tumor suppressor gene, deletion or inactivation of this protective gene by two mutations (Knudson's two hit hypothesis) results in retinoblastoma. QPathology: Origin: Arises as malignant proliferation of the immature retinal neural cells called retinoblasts. Characterized by Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes (highly specific for retinoblastoma). Homer-Wright rosettes, pseudo rosettes and fleurettes formation. QPresence of areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. Clinical Features: Quiescent stage. Glaucomatous/ Inflammatory stage.
