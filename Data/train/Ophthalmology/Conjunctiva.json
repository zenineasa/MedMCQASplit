        "exp": "PTERYGIUM Pterygium (L. Pterygion = a wing) is a wing-shaped fold of conjunctiva encroaching upon the cornea from either side within the interpalpebral fissure, usually on the nasal side. Etiology: environmental factors such as exposure to sun (ultraviolet rays), dry heat, high wind and abundance of dust. Pathology: Pathologically pterygium is a degenerative and hyperplastic condition of conjunctiva. The subconjunctival tissue undergoes elastotic degeneration and proliferates as vascularised granulation tissue under the epithelium, which ultimately encroaches the cornea. The corneal epithelium, Bowman&; s layer and superficial stroma are destroyed. Complications: like cystic degeneration and infection are infrequent. Rarely, neoplastic change to epithelioma, fibrosarcoma or malignant melanoma, may occur. Treatment: Surgical excision is the only satisfactory treatment. Recurrence of the pterygium after surgical excision is the main problem (30-50%). However, it can be reduced by any of the following measures: 1. Transplantation of pterygium in the lower fornix (Mc. Reynold&; s operation) is not performed now. 2. Postoperative beta irradiations (not used now). 3. Postoperative use of antimitotic drugs such as mitomycin-C or thiotepa. 4. Surgical excision with bare sclera. 5. Surgical excision with free conjunctival graft taken from the same eye or other eye is presently the preferred technique. 6. In recurrent recalcitrant pterygium, surgical excision should be coupled with lamellar keratectomy and lamellar keratoplasty. Reference:- A K KHURANA; 6th edition, page:-80, 81",

It is characterised by a mixed follicular and papillary response of conjunctival tissue. It is still one of the leading causes of preventable blindness in the world. Clinical Signs: A. Conjunctival signs: 1. Congestion of upper tarsal and forniceal conjunctiva. 2. Conjunctival follicles. Follicles look like boiled sagograins and are commonly seen on upper tarsal conjunctiva and fornix; but may also be present in the lower fornix. Follicles may be seen on the bulbar conjunctiva (pathognomic of trachoma). 3. Papillary hyperplasia: Papillae are reddish, flat topped raised areas which give red and velvety appearance to the tarsal conjunctiva. Each papilla consists of central core of numerous dilated blood vessels surrounded by lymphocytes and covered by hyperophic epithelium. 4. Conjunctival scarring: which may be irregular, star-shaped or linear. Linear scar present in the sulcus subtarsalis is called Arlt&; s line. 5. Concretions may be formed due to accumulation of dead epithelial cells and inspissated mucus in the depressions called glands of Henle. Corneal signs: 1. Superficial keratitis may be present in the upper pa. 2. Herbe follicles refer to typical follicles present in the limbal area. These are histologically similar to conjunctival follicles. 3. Pannus i. e., infiltration of the cornea associated with vascularization is seen in upper pat. The vessels are superficial and lie between epithelium and Bowman&; s membrane. 4. Corneal ulcer. 5. Herbe pits: are the oval or circular pitted scars, left after healing of Herbe follicles in the limbal area 6. Corneal opacity may be present in the upper pa.

Etiology: The disease is caused by picornaviruses (enterovirus type 70) which are RNA viruses of small(pico) size. The disease is very contagious and is transmitted by direct hand-to-eye contact. Clinical picture: The disease has occurred in an epidemic form in the Far East, Africa, and England and hence the name 'epidemic hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (EHC)' has been suggested. An incubation period of EHC is very sho (1-2days). Symptoms include pain, redness, watering, mild photophobia, transient blurring of vision and lid swelling. Signs of EHC are conjunctival congestion, chemosis, multiple hemorrhages in bulbar conjunctiva, mild follicular hyperplasia, lid edema and pre-auricular lymphadenopathy. Corneal involvement may occur in the form of fine epithelial keratitis. Treatment: *EHC is very infectious and poses major potential problems of cross-infection. Therefore, prophylactic measures are very impoant. *No specific effective curative treatment is known. *However, broad-spectrum antibiotic eye drops may be used to prevent secondary bacterial infections. Usually, the disease has a self-limiting course of 5-7 days. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is primarily caused by enterovirus 70 and a variant of coxsackievirus A24; however, other enteroviruses, including echoviruses 7 and 11, coxsackieviruses B1 and B2, and several adenoviruses can also cause acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, sporadic conjunctivitis and keratoconjunctivitis Ref- Khurana; 4th edition; Pg.

Fuher, the deep tarsal vessels should be visible through the follicles and papillae. 2. TI: Trachomatous inflammation intense. This stage is diagnosed when pronounced inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva obscures more than half of the normal deep tarsal vessels. 3. TS: Trachomatous scarring. This stage is diagnosed by the presence of scarring in the tarsal conjunctiva. These scars are easily visible as white, bands or sheets (fibrosis) in the tarsal conjunctiva. 4. TT: Trachomatous trichiasis. TT is labelled when at least one eyelash rubs the eyeball. Evidence of recent removal of inturned eyelashes should also be graded as trachomatous trichiasis. 5. CO: Corneal opacity. This stage is labelled when easily visible corneal opacity is present over the pupil. This sign refers to corneal scarring that is so dense that at least pa of pupil margin is blurred when seen through the opacity.
