        "exp": "Ans: C (Optic neuritis) Ref: Kanski's Clinical Ophthalmology. Internet Sources and Parson's Opthalmology and A Textbook of Ophthalmology By Ahmed, pg 364. Explanation: Diclofenac can rarely cause optic neuritis (in 0. 12% patients). Colour vision is the function of optic nerve. So in any optic nerve pathology, colour vision is the earliest top get affected. In glaucomas and cataract, colour vision is usually unaffected or affected very late. Causes of Colour Blindness.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Papilloedema * Vision is normal initially. In 25% of patients visual symptoms occur only in advanced severe papilloedema, when optic atrophy sets in. Typically, there is recurring brief episodes (transient) of visual obscurations (Amaurosis fugax) lasting less then 30 seconds, in which vision turns grey or blacks, sometimes decribed as if a veil has fallen over the eyes. The symptoms usually affect both eyes at once as papilloedema is bilateral. Central vision is affected late in the disease. Initially there is enlargement of blind spot and progressive contraction of the visual field (visual field becomes smaller). Complete blindness sets in eventually. Thus, characteristically there is gradually progressive painless loss of vision.",
