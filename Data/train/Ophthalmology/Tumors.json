This is seen most often in young children in the familial form of retinoblastoma, which is due to a deletion involving chromosome 13. These familial cases of retinoblastoma are frequently multiple and bilateral, although like all the sporadic, nonheritable tumors they can also be unifocal and unilateral. Histologically, rosettes of various types are frequent (similar to neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma). There is a good prognosis with early detection and treatment; spontaneous regression can occur but is rare. Retinoblastoma belongs to a group of cancers (osteosarcoma, Wilms tumor, meningioma, rhabdomyosarcoma, uveal melanoma) in which the normal cancer suppressor gene (antioncogene) is inactivated or lost, with resultant malignant change. Retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma arise after the loss of the same genetic locus--hereditary mutation in the q14 band of chromosome 13. In contrast, a blue sclera can be seen with osteogenesis imperfect, while a yellow sclera is seen with jaundice.

(a) Primary intraorbital meningiomas: These are also known as 'optic nerve sheath meningiomas'. These produce early visual loss associated with limitation of ocular movements, optic disc oedema or atrophy, and a slowly progressive unilateral proptosis. During the intradural stage, it is clinically indistinguishable from optic nerve glioma. However, the presence of opticociliary shunt is pathognomonic of an optic nerve sheath meningioma. (b) Secondary orbital meningiomas: Those intracranial meningiomas which secondarily invade the orbit either arise from the sphenoid bone or involve it en route to the orbit. Orbital invasion may occur through: floor of anterior cranial fossa, superior orbital fissure and optic canal. Meningioma enplaque, affecting the greater and lesser wings of sphenoid and taking origin in the region of pterion, is the most common variety affecting the orbit secondarily. These tumours typically occur in middle- aged women. Ref:- A K KHURANA; pg num:-395, 396",
