A: Bitemporal hemianopia Bitemporal hemianopia is usually caused by tumours in the region of the sella turcica, pressure by suprasellar aneurysm or by chronic arachnoiditis; these press upon the chiasma, so that the fibres from the nasal halves of each retina are destroyed Bitemporal hemianopsia/ Bitemporal hemianopia It is a type of paial blindness where vision is missing in the outer half of both the right and left visual field. It is usually associated with lesions of the optic chiasm, the area where the optic nerves from the right and left eyes cross near the pituitary gland Causes In bitemporal hemianopsia vision is missing in the outer (temporal or lateral) half of both the right and left visual fields. Information from the temporal visual field falls on the nasal (medial) retina. The nasal retina is responsible for carrying the information along the optic nerve, and crosses to the other side at the optic chiasm. When there is compression at optic chiasm the visual impulse from both nasal retina are affected, leading to inability to view the temporal, or peripheral, vision. This phenomenon is known as bitemporal hemianopsia. Bitemporal hemianopsia most commonly occurs as a result of tumors located at the mid-optic chiasm. Since the adjacent structure is the pituitary gland, some common tumors causing compression are pituitary adenomas, and craniopharyngiomas. Also another relatively common neoplastic etiology is meningiomas. An etiology of vascular origin is an aneurysm of the anterior communicating aery which arise superior to the chiasm, enlarge, and compress it from above.",

Ciliochoroidaliffusion (tachment) = CCE It is collection of fluid in the potential space between the sclera externally and the choroids and ciliary body internally. The fluid is usually located with in the expansion zone of choroids & ciliary body and is therefore within the uvea. Features The anatomic arrangement of fibers. anteriorly that attach the ciliary body and anterior chorioid to the sclera, is analogous to that of long and tangential fibers in outer plexiform layer in the macular area (another location where fluid selectively accumulates). - The physiological pressure in suprachoroidal space is - 2 mm. Hg less than IOP in anterior & vitreous chamber. A precipitous (sudden) decline in LOP d/t surgery or trauma may promote vascular engorgement and suprachoroidal edema. With CCE, the lens -iris diaphragm may shift anteriorly and cause acute angle closure glaucoma. Structurally abnormal Sclera (Thick Sclera): Sclera contains high levels of abnormal proteoglycans which bind and trap large volumes of water. Thus the sclera thickens and may secondarily obstruct the choroidal venous drainage and escape of aqueous that leave the anterior chamber uveoscleral route. Fibronectin is increased in sclera in nanopthalmos. Forms (Types) Voex vein compression by thickened sclera has been implicated in the production of uveal effusion in uveal effusion syndrome and nanopthalmic eyesQ. Abnormal accumulation of serous fluid lit exudative deep ciliochoroidal detachment of ciliary body, choroids and retina. In chronic CCE, break down of blood ocular barrier at the level of RPE occurs and 1/t non rhegmatogenous RD. - Linear areas of RPE hyperophy and hyperplasia (Verhoeff's streak) are sign of resolving (subsidiary) cilochorodal effusion (detachment). Motling of RPE (Leopard sign) may be seen. Eyes may be nanopthalmic (small) or hvpermetropic Phthysis and hypotonia is usually due to ciliary body shutdown from chronic detachment which compromises the blood supply to the ciliary processes Ureal effusion syndrome is frequently confused clinically with ring melanoma of the ciliary body/choroids and metastatic tumors which form impoant differential diagnosis of this condition. Transillumination and USG are helpful in distinguishing a serous from solid detachment. CCE light up, and transillumination can be observed anteriorly next to limbus. Increased transillumination by CCE is k/a Hagen's sign. However, in some cases of melanoma (non pigmented type) transillumination may not be defective.",

So, prophylactic antibiotic should adequately cover these organisms. The pre- operative topical antibiotic should be staed 3 days prior to surgery. Preferred antibiotics are fouh generation fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin). Other antibiotics are aminoglycosides, traditional fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) and gramicidin- neomycin - polymyxin B combination. Never the less, complete conjunctival sterility is not usually possible with the use of preoperative antibiotics alone. The topical antiseptic povidone iodine 5% instilled as a single drop 10- 30 minutes before surgery is one of the most effective measure to decrease this bacterial flora. Intraoperatively, a large poion of surgeons (66. 4%) also use subconjunctival antibiotic. Intracameral antibiotic at the end of surgery showed significant benefit in reducing the rate of bacterial endophthalmitis. Post- operatively topical antibiotics (eye drops) are given along with steroids for 10 -14 days.",

There may be diplopia while looking in the direction of action of paralysed muscle. For example in right lateral rectus palsy, diplopia will occur in right gaze as in this position right lateral rectus and left medial rectus act in conjugation. So, left medial rectus will act normally which will cause normal adduction (right sided) movement of left eye, while right lateral rectus (paralysed) will not cause abduction (right sided) movement of right eye.

Drug of choice for raised IOT in acute anterior uveitis -Timolol. Management of uveitic glaucoma In general, the treatment of patients with uveitic glaucoma begins with the control of intraocular inflammation by topical steroids. If successful, in rare cases this treatment may normalize the 10P. Early anti- inflammatory therapy combined with mydriatics and cyloplegic drugs is used to prevent irreversible consequences of uveitis, such as posterior synechiae, peripheral and anterior synechiae However, medical and surgical antiglaucomatous therapy may be needed when the IOP does not respond to anti- inflammatory drugs. Topical 13- blockers are the drugs of choice for the treatment of raised 10P in patients with uveitic glaucoma. Adrenergic agonists like epinephrine or dipivefrin are also widely used. Other adrenergic drug, apraclonidine (a, - agonist) can also be used in acute LOP elevation. Topical or systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be used when 13 - blockers and adrenergic stimulators do not control the IOP or when they are contraindicated. Hyperosmotic agents are rarely used but may be of paicular value when TOP has to be lowered rapidly. When medical therapy fails, surgical treatment (laser iridotomy) should be considered. Among antiglaucoma medications, prostaglandin analogues (eg Latanoprost) should not be used as they breakdown the blood aqueous barrier and may exacerbate cystoid macular edema",

        "question": "All of the following are features of Homer's syndrome except: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Proptosis When all the sympathetic function on one side is lost, resulting in miosis, a narrowed palpebral fissure and slight enophthalmos (due to loss of tone of Muller muscle), sometimes associated with unilateral absence of sweating, the condition is called the Homer syndrome Homer's syndrome/ Bernard-Homer syndrome/ Claude Bernard-Homer syndrome/ Oculosympathetic palsy It is the combination of drooping of the eyelid (ptosis) and constriction of the pupil (miosis), sometimes accompanied by decreased sweating of the face on the same side. It indicates a problem with the sympathetic nervous system. Signs and symptoms Signs that are found in all patients on the affected side of the face include paial ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid from loss of sympathetic innervation to the superior tarsal muscle, also known as Muller's muscle); upside-down ptosis (slight elevation of the lower lid); anhidrosis (decreased sweating on the affected side of the face); miosis (small pupils); enophthalmos (the impression that the eye is sunk in); loss of ciliospinal reflex; and bloodshot conjunctiva, depending on the site of lesion. Sometimes there is flushing on the affected side of the face due to dilation of blood vessels under the skin. The pupil's light reflex is maintained as this is controlled the parasympathetic nervous system. In children, Homer's syndrome sometimes leads to heterochromia: a difference in eye color between the two eyes. This happens because a lack of sympathetic stimulation in childhood interferes with melanin pigmentation of the melanocytes in the superficial stroma of the iris. Causes Homer syndrome is acquired as a result of disease but may also be congenital (inborn) or iatrogenic. Although most causes are relatively benign, Homer syndrome may reflect serious disease in the neck or chest (such as a Pancoast tumor (tumor in the apex of the lung) or thyrocervical venous dilatation). Due to lesion or compression of one side of the cervical or thoracic sympathetic chain, which generates symptoms on the ipsilateral side of the body. Lateral medullary syndrome Cluster headache - combination termed Hoon's headache Trauma- base of neck, usually blunt trauma, sometimes surgery. Tumours - often bronchogenic carcinoma of the superior fissure (Pancoast tumor) on apex of lung Aoic aneurysm, thoracic Cervical rib traction on stellate ganglion Cavernous sinus thrombosis Sympathectomy Nerve blocks, such as cervical plexus block, stellate ganglion or interscalene block Pathophysio logy Homer syndrome is due to a deficiency of sympathetic activity. The site of lesion to the sympathetic outflow is on the ipsilateral side of the symptoms. The following are examples of conditions that cause the clinical appearance of Homer's syndrome: First-order neuron disorder: Central lesions that involve the hypothalamospinal tract (e. g. transection of the cervical spinal cord). Second-order neuron disorder: Preganglionic lesions (e. g. compression of the sympathetic chain by a lung tumor). Third-order neuron disorder: Postganglionic lesions at the level of the internal carotid aery (e. g. a tumor in the cavernous sinus or a carotid aery dissection). Paial Homer's syndrome In case of a third-neuron disorder, anhidrosis is limited to the middle pa of the forehead or can be absent, resulting in a paial Homer's syndrome. If someone has impaired sweating above the waist affecting only one side of the body, yet they do not have a clinically apparent Homer's syndrome, then the lesion is just below the stellate ganglion in the sympathetic chain. Diagnosis Three tests are useful in confirming the presence and severity of Homer syndrome: 1. Cocaine drop test: Cocaine eyedrops block the reuptake of norepinephrine resulting in the dilation of a normal pupil. However, in Homer's syndrome the lack of norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft causes mydriatic failure. A more recently introduced approach that is more dependable and obtes the difficulties in obtaining cocaine is to apply the alpha-agonist apraclonidine to both eyes and observe the reversal of miosis on the affected side of Homer syndrome (the opposite effect to what the cocaine test would produce in the presence of Horner's). 2. Paredrine test: This test helps to localize the cause of the miosis. If the third order neuron (the last of three neurons in the pathway which ultimately discharges norepinephrine into the synaptic cleft) is intact, then the amphetamine causes neurotransmitter vesicle release, thus releasing norepinephrine into the synaptic cleft and resulting in robust mydriasis of the affected pupil. If the lesion itself is of the third order neuron, then the amphetamine will have no effect and the pupil remains constricted. There is no pharmacological test to differentiate between a first and second order neuron lesion. 3. Dilation lag test It is impoant to distinguish the ptosis caused by Homer's syndrome from the ptosis caused by a lesion to the oculomotor nerve. In the former, the ptosis occurs with a constricted pupil (due to a loss of sympathetics to the eye), whereas in the latter, the ptosis occurs with a dilated pupil (due to a loss of innervation to the sphincter pupillae). In a clinical setting, these two ptoses are fairly easy to distinguish. In addition to the blown pupil in a CNIII (oculomotor nerve) lesion, this ptosis is much more severe, occasionally occluding the whole eye. The ptosis of Homer syndrome can be quite mild or barely noticeable (paial ptosis). When anisocoria occurs and the examiner is unsure whether the abnormal pupil is the constricted or dilated one, if a one-sided ptosis is present then the abnormally sized pupil can be presumed to be on the side of the ptosis.",

B) Recurrent ocular herpes: - After primary infection, recurrent disease may involve any or all layers of the cornea. Recurrent herpatic keratitis is divided into:? 1) Epithelial keratitis: - Manifestations of epithelial keratitis include: - Corneal vesicles: - Vesicles coalesce and erupt to form dendritic or geographic ulcer. Superficial punctate keratitis Dendritic ulcer: - It is the most common presentation and is a typical lesion of herpes keratitis. There is an associated marked diminution of sensation. Geographic ulcer (amoeboid ulcer) 2) Stromal keratitis: - Stromal keratitis may be of two types: - Disciform keratitis: - This is due to damage to endothelial cells as a result of hypersensitivity reaction to the HSV antigen.

Essential pathological changes are thinning and ectasia which occur as a result of defective synthesis of mucopolysaccharide and collagen tissue. It usually stas at pubey and progresses slowly. Symptoms usually begins as blurred vision with shadowing around images. Vision becomes progressively more blurred and distoed with associated glare, halos around lights, light sensitivity and ocular irritation. Visual loss occurs primarily from irregular astigmatism and myopia, and secondarily from corneal scarring. o The hallmark of keratoconus is central or paracentral stromal thinning, apical protrusion of anterior corneaand irregular astigmatism. The cornea thins near the centre and progressively bulges forwards, with the apex of cone always being slightly below the centre of the cornea. Impoant findings an examination are - i) Distaed window reflex (Corneal reflex)e. ii) Fleisher's rine. iii) Yawning reflex (Scissor reflex). iv) Oil drop reflex. v) Munson's signs Treatment includes:? 1) Spectacles for regular or mild irregular astigmatism. 2) Rigid gas permeable contact lens for higher astigmatism. 3) Epikeratoplasty in patients intolerant to lens and without significant corneal scarring. 4) Keratoplasty penetrating or deep lamellar if there is significant corneal scarring.",

It occurs commonly when a piece of plaque (embolus) in the carotid aery breaks off and travels to the retinal aery in the eye. Plaque is a hard substance that forms when fat, cholesterol and other substances build up in the walls of aeries. Pieces of plaque can travel through the bloodstream. Vision loss occurs as long as the blood supply to the aery is blocked. Atherosclerosis of the aeries in the neck is the main risk factor for this condition. Risk factors for atherosclerosis include heart disease, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Clinical features Monocular transient and recurrent episodes of visual loss characterize this syndrome. Visual loss last for seconds to minutes and then return back to normal. Ophthalmoscopy may reveal an embolus visible within a retinal aeriole or ocular examination may be normal.",

The patient may describe a shade dropping in front of the eye or describe vision like looking through ground glass. If a thrombus propagates up the carotid to the middle cerebral aery, then symptoms seen in middle cerebral aery occlusion or embolization (hemiparesis with sensory symptoms, aphasia depending on hemispheric dominance) will also occur. Midbasilar aery disease produces weakness and sensory loss with diplopia, loss of facial sensation or movement, and ataxia. Branches of the basilar aery supply the base of the pons and superior cerebellum. The symptoms described suggest disease in the posterior circulation, whichincludes paired veebral aeries, the basilar aery, and the paired posterior cerebral aeries. The basilar aery divides into two posterior cerebral aeries that provide branches to the cerebellum, medulla, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and temporal and occipital lobes. A midbasilar aery occlusion could cause ataxia of limbs by involving pontine nuclei; paralysis of the face, arm, and leg by involving coicospinal tracts; and impairment of facial sensation by involvement of fifth nerve nucleus. Occlusion of the entire middle cerebral aery results in contralateral hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, and homonymous hemianopsia. When the dominant hemisphere is involved, aphasia is present. When the nondominant hemisphere is involved, apraxia and neglect are produced. When only a penetrating branch of the middle cerebral aery is affected, the syndrome of pure motor hemiplegia is produced, as the infarct involves only the posterior limb of the internal capsule, involving only motor fibers to the face, arm, and leg (lacunar infarct).",

        "question": "Following is a feature of concomitant squint?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Constant amount of detion in all directions of gaze MANFEST SQUINT (HETEROTROPIA) In manifest squint the detion of eye is present as such and cannot be compensated by fusion. Two main types of manifest squint are concomitant squint and paralytic squint. A) Concomitant squint In concomitant squint the eyes are not in alignment and the degree of malalignment remains constant in all the directions of gaze and there is no limitation of ocular movements. Concomitant squint may be of following types: 1) Esotropia (Convergent squint):- It denotes inward detion of eye. It can be unilateral or uniocular (the same eye always detes inwards) or alternating (either of the eyes detes inwards and the other eye takes up fixation, alternately). Concomitant esotropia is the most common type of squint in children. Following types of esotropia are there:- i) Congenital esotropia (infantile esotropia) True congenital (infantile) esotropia usually appears between the age of 2 and 4 months. However, rarely it may be present from bih. The inward turn of the eye is constant of large amount, i. e., detion is > 35 prism diopters (17-5'). Binocular vision (both eyes fixing simultaneously) does not develop. There is alternate fixation in primary gaze, i. e, when the infant looks straight, he fixes the gaze with one eye at a time alternately. On lateral gaze there is cross fixation, i. e, use right eye to fix across the nose to view the objects to the left and vice versa. Amblyopia develops in 25- 40% of cases. Latent horizontal nystagmus (common) and many rotatory nystagmus may occur. Inferior oblique overaction may be present initially or develop later and dissociated veical detion develop in 80% by age of 3 years. It is more difficult to help this type of strabismus with nonsurgical methods, thus, surgery is the treatment of choice. Surgical procedure to make both medial recti weak by recession. Surgery should be done as early as possible to avoid development of amblyopia and for the development of proper binocular vision. The usually recommended time is between 6 month - 2 years of age (and preferably before 1 year of age). It is impoant to treat the amblyopia before performing surgery by patching of normal eye. ii) Accommodative esotropia Accommodative esotropia occurs due to overaction of convergence associated with accommodation reflex. Accommodative esotropia is the most common type of squint in children (Previously it was believed that congenital esotropia is the most common type squint in children. However now it is very much clear that accommodative esotropia is the most common one). It esotropia is noted around 2-3 years of age, it is most likely accommodative esotropia. On the bases of AC/A (accommodative convergence/accomodation) ratio, accommodative esotropia is divided into two types: (a) Refractive (Normal AC/A ratio); (b) Non - refractive (abnormal AC/A ratio). AC/A ratio gives the relationship between the amount of convergence that is goverened by a given amount of accommodation. Normal AC/A ratio accommodative esotropia:- This occurs in children with hypermetropia. Esotropia is a physiological response to excessive hypermetropia. Patients with high hypermetropia generate large amount of accommodation to see clearly at near fixation. This excessive accommodation may cause esotropia as accommodation is associated with convergence. AC/A ratio is normal. Large AC/A ratio accommodative esotropia:- Children have large amounts of focusing power and sometimes the increase of accommodation is accompanied by a dispropoionately large increase of convergence. This occurs in patient with hypermetropia but may occur in myopia and without any refractive error. AC/A ratio is high. Usually, there are no symptoms except for cosmetic embarrassment to the patient. There is no diplopia as the image in the squinting eye is automatically suppressed, i. e., amblyopia develops in squinting eye. The main feature is the failure of binocular vision. 2) Exotropia (divergent squint):- It is characterized by outward detion of eye. This is very less common than esotropia. 3) Hyperopia (Veical squint):- It is characterized by veical detion of eye. It is also rare. B) Incomitant squint Incomitant squint is a squint in which the angle of detion differs depending upon the direction of gaze i. e, amount of detion varies in different directions of gaze. There are many type of incomitant squints (paralytic, restrictive, 'A' & 'V' pattern), however the most common type is Paralytic squint and the word incomitant squint is usually used for paralytic squint. Therefore, I will explain paralytic squint here Paralytic squint is the most common type of squint in adults. Paralytic squint is the strabismus resulting from complete or incomplete paralysis of one or more extraocular muscles. There are many causes like neurogenic (e. g. meningitis, cranial nerve palsy etc.), myogenic (myopathies), or neuromuscular junction lesions. o Symptoms of paralytic squint are:- i) Diplopia: It is the main symptom. It is most marked in the direction of action of paralysed muscle. For example in left rectus palsy, the maximum diplopia occurs when patient tries to see horizontally on left side and in left superior oblique palsy (causes Dextrodepression) diplopia is maximum when patient tries to look downward and right. It is woh noting here that in diplopia, if the images are separated horizontally it is probable that either a lateral or a medial recuts is affected; when the images are separated veically or the image is tilted (torsion) it is likely that one or more of the veical recti or the obliques are affected. ii) Other symptoms: Confusion, nausea & veigo, ocular detion, loss of stereopsis. Signs of paralytic squint are:- i) Secondary detion is more than primary detion:- Primary detion is the detion in the affected eye and is away from the action of paralysed muscle. Secondary detion is the detion of normal eye seen under cover, when the patient is made to fix with the squinting eye. ii) Restriction of ocular movements iii) Compensatory head posture:- Patients with a paralytic squint move their head such that the eyes occupy a position in the orbit where the angle of squint is minimal and this can avoid confusion and diplopia. Head is turned towards the action of paralysed muscle. When the horizontal recti (medial or lateral) are affected, the characteristic posture is a turn of the face to right or left, e. g. in left lateral rectus palsy the head is turned to the left and in left medial recuts palsy the head is turned to the right. When a veical rectus (superior or inferior) or an oblique muscle is affected, a tilt of the head to the right or left with depression or elevation of the chin is adopted to reduce both the veical detion and rotation, e. g in superior oblique palsy (dextrodepression of left eye is affected) the head is tilted to left so that the left eye can see down and medially. iv) There is false projection or orientation v) There is no amblyopia and visual acuity is normal as paralytic squint develops in adults when visual acuity has already developed.",

Ultrasound and CT scan are able to detect an intraocular mass with calcification which is pathognomonic of retinoblastoma. The prognosis for preservation of the eye with at least some useful vision can be assessed with some degrees of success using classification such as Reese-Ellsworth system and the Esson prognosis classification. Option a is controversial Different textbook have mentioned different percentage for sporadic and hereditary retinoblastoma - \"95% of these retinoblastomas has no family history\". -Neonatal emergencies \"The majority of retinoblastoma cases (90%) arise sporadically in the tissues of the affected proband or the parental germ line\". ___ Carlos \"The great majority of retinoblastoma (85%) are sporadic tumors\". - Eye pathalogy \"The majority of retinoblastoma is sporadic (60%)\". - Blue prints pediatrics \"Nonheritable retinoblastoma accounts for about 60% of cases\". - Tumors of the eye by H. cher \"Non- hereditary or sporadic cases account for 60% of all cases\". ___Khurana \"60% of all retinoblastoma are sporadic\". - Human heredity So, some books have mentioned that 90-95% cases of retinoblastoma are sporadic. While others have mentioned that 60-65% cases of retinoblastoma are sporadic. Therefore, I had to do extensive work on this and found something to clear your doubts. Most of the books have considered sporadic cases and non- heritable cases as the same. Which is not the cases. I have read many books on genetics of retinoblastoma. First read the following statement \"About 40% of all retinoblastoma patients have a germ line mutation in the Rb gene, although 7% have a positive family history. Therefore, most patients with heritable retinoblastoma are sporadic cases with new germ line mutation\". - Human heredity with Info. Tech. Therefore, though the chances of gene transmission is more in hereditary retinoblastoma, most of the heritable retinoblastoma are sporadic (and this is the answer of our question). After reading this statement you can easily get the following facts- Sporadic retinoblastoma are those in which there is no family history of retinoblastoma Non - hereditary cases are those in which the RB gene mutation is not acquired from parents Hereditary cases are those in which the RB gene mutation is acquired from parents (this also includes heritable sporadic cases). Thus, sporadic retinoblastoma and non - hereditary retinoblastoma are not synonymous:- Sporadic cases = Nonhereditary cases + Hereditary cases with no positive family history of retinoblastoma. After reading all these you can easily understand that the percentage of sporadic retinoblastoma will always be more than non- hereditary retinoblastoma. Now you read the frequencies:- Hereditary cases -> 40% of all retinoblastomas Non-hereditary cases -> 60% of all retinoblastomas Sporadic cases -> 90-95% of all retinoblastomas",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Astigmatism Ptervgium Pterygium is a non-cancerous (non-neoplastic) growth of conjunctiva, characterized by a wing-shaped fold of conjunctiva encroaching upon the cornea from either side within the interpalpebral fissure. Pterygium is always situated in the palpebral apeure. Pathologically Pterygium is a degenerative and hyperplastic condition of conjunctiva. The subconjunctival tissue undergoes elastotic degeneration and proliferates as vascularized granulation tissue under the epithelium, which ultimately encroaches the cornea. The corneal epithelium, Bowman's layer and stroma are destroyed. Etiology & Clinical features Pterygium is more common in people with excess outdoor exposure to sunlight (UV rays), dry heat, high wind and abundance of dust. Therefore it is more common in those who work outdoors. Clinically it presents as a triangular fold of conjunctiva encroaching the cornea in the area of palpebral apeure, usually on the nasal side. Other findings are stocker's line (deposition of iron) Ptergyium is an asymptomatic condition in the early stages, except for cosmetic intolerance. Visual disturbance or corneal astigmatism may occur. Visual disturbances are due to encroachment of pterygium on pupillary area or corneal astigmatism. Occasionally diplopia may occur due to limitation of ocular movements. Treatment Asymptomatic pterygium which is not progressive is best left alone. Surgical excision is the only satisfactory treatment and is indicated for: - (1) Cosmetic reasons, (2) Continued progression threatening to encroach onto the pupillary area (once the pterygium has encroached pupillary area, wait till it crosses on the other side), (3) Diplopia due to interference in ocular movement.",

First you see the topical adverse effects of parasympathomimetic antiglaucoma drugs (from yanoff & Duker):- Directly acting (cholinergic agonists like pilocarpine, carbachol) -> Miosis, uveitis, browache, cataracts, myopia, retinal detachment, colour vision changes, angle closure, ocular cicatracial pemphigoid. Indirectly acting (anticholineesterases like demecarium):- Intense miosis, iris pigment cysts, punctal stenosis, myopia, cataract, retinal detachment, angle closure. Now see each option sequentially:- Option '1' Pilocarpine can cause shallow anterior chamber:- \"The use of pilocarpine is somewhat paradoxical since it is known to cause further shallowing of anterior chamber\". - Evidence - based ophthalmology. Now you must be thinking then why pilocarpine is the drug of choice for angle closure glaucoma. Pilocarpine works by helping to open the angle by tensing the iris-diaphragm and pulling on the scleral spur. It may also help to resolve relative pupil block. Option '2' Punctal stenosis is caused by indirect cholinomimetic (cholinesterase) not by direct cholinomimetic (pilocarpine). Option '3' Rarely, pilocarpine can cause follicular conjunctivitis:- \"Pilocarpine and carbachol may both cause conjunctival follicle\". - Clinical ophthalmology. Option '4' Miotics (pilocarpine) makes the iris thin and pulls it away from lens removing the pupillary block, increasing the chances of posterior synechiae (due to stretching & increased surface of iris) and restoring aqueous flow by opening irido-corneal angle.",

In chipping stone with an iron chisel, it is commonly a chip of the chisel and not of the stone which enters the eye. Chalcosis is perforating injury to eye with metal containing copper (Cu). Copper deposition can lead to:? Grayish-green/golden brown discoloration of peripheral cornea called Kayser-Fleisher ring. Sunflower (Petal of flower) cataract due to deposition of copper under the posterior capsule of the lens. Golden plaque at posterior pole of the retina. Siderosis is caused by an iron foreign body.

The absence of posterior synechiae. A fairly common rubeosis iridis, sometimes associated with neovascularisation of the angle of the anterior chamber. Comparatively early development of complicated cataract and secondary glaucoma (usually open-angle type). Glaucoma has been reported in 10-59% of cases. Treatment Fuch's heterchromic uveitis responds variably to steroids and cycloplegics. The complications of long-term use of these drugs may at times outweigh their potential benefits. Therefore, treatment with topical steroids is given to iritis which is sufficiently active to require the treatment, otherwise, the patient is routinely followed without giving any treatment. Cataract responds well to most forms of intraocular surgeries, including the standard IOL implantation. Hyphentia may occur because of rubeosis iridis (neovascularization of iris).

The brain fills in with surrounding detail and with information from the other eye, so the blind spot is not normally perceived.

If the child will be examined for refraction under cycloplegia (relaxing the ciliary muscles) this compensation will not be there and the refractory error can be measured. So, the boy is having hypermetropia but at the time of presentation, he is presenting with pseudomyopia due to excessive accommodation, i. e. compensatory correction of hypermetropia by excessive spasm of ciliary muscles. In hypemetropia (when an error is not compensated) Refractive testing with or without cyclopegia will show hypermetropic type of refractive error. In Pseudomypia (hypermetropia is compensated) Refractive testing without cyclopegia -> No refractive error (because of compensation) Refractive testing with cycloplegia -> Hypermetropia is manifested. It is worth noting here that the above description was for spasm of accommodation which occurs in response to compensate the refractive error (hypermetropia). In other situation where the spasm of accommodation is due to other causes (e. g. drugs causing ciliary spasm), the eye will become myopic (Pseudomyopia).

Adults commonly affected include those individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), oncology patients, and patients on immunosuppresive therapy. There is characteristic hemorrhagic, full thickness retinitis. In early stage there are yellow-white exudates (areas of retinal necrosis) associated with areas of vasculitis and retinal hemorrhage. There may be exudative retinal detachment and ultimately, there occurs total retinal atrophy. There are three distinct variants of CMV retinitis:? 1. Classical (fulminant) retinitis It is necrotic retinitis Large areas of retinal hemorrhage along a whitened, edematous or necrotic retina, usually in posterior pole in the distribution of nerve fiber layer along the vascular arcades. It is also known as \"Pizza-Pic retinopathy\" or \"cottage cheese with catchup\". 2. Granular (indolent) retinitis Without edema, hemorrhage or vascular sheathing, progressing along active border of retinal periphery. 3. Perivascular retinitis Frosted branch angitis with retinal perivasculitis. Another finding in CMV retinitis is a white granular geographic lesion that clears centrally as it enlarges, leaving a quiet central area of retinal atrophy and mottled pigment epithelium. This has also been described as \"brush-fire\"pattern. It should be remembered that vitreous hemorrhage, though, is not common in CMV retinitis, it may occur after initiation of treatment of AIDS (HAA).

Ocular involvement by HSV may occur in two forms: - Primary herpes: - Typically is a unilateral blepharoconjunctivitis which is characterized by vesicles on the skin of lids, follicular conjunctivitis, preauriculars adenopathy and sometimes punctate keratitis. Recurrent ocular herpes: - After primary infection, recurrent disease may involve any or all layers of the cornea. Recurrent herpatic keratitis is divided into:? 1) Epithelial keratitis: - Manifestations of epithelial keratitis include: - Corneal vesicles: - Vesicles coalesce and erupt to form dendritic or geographic ulcer. Superficial punctate keratitis Dendritic ulcer: - It is the most common presentation and is a typical lesion of herpes keratitis. There is an associated marked diminution of sensation. Geographic ulcer (amoeboid ulcer) 2) Stromal keratitis: - Stromal keratitis may be of two types: - Disciform keratitis: - This is due to damage to endothelial cells as a result of hypersensitivity reaction to the HSV antigen. Diffuse stromal necrotic keratitis: - Caused by active viral invasion and tissue destruction. 3) Metaherpatic keratitis (Epithelial sterile trophic ulceration): - It is not an active disease, but is a mechanical healing problem at the site of previous herpetic ulcer.",

Several varieties of contact lens can aid in treatment of dry eye. Hard contact lens may stimulate reflex tearing and also prevent evaporation of tear. Cosmatically superior. Tinted contact lenses relieve photophobia in albinism. Disadvantages of contact lens Complications of contact lens wearing are:? Intolerance: - Some people find wearing contact lenses intolerable. Corneal complications: - Corneal abrasion, Corneal edema, Corneal vascularization, Microbial keratitis (Pseudomonas, acanthamoeba), Sterile corneal infiltrate. Giant papillary conjunctivitis. Hypoxia: - Cornea is deprived of oxygen from the tear film by the presence of the contact lens. The cornea becomes edematous and new vessels may develop in the limbal area. Sensitivity: - This may develop in response to the preservative (thiomersal) in the cleaning and soaking solution. This results in allergic conjunctivitis.",

Staphyloma is divided anatomically into:? 1) Anterior staphyloma: - Protrusion and adhesion of iris to ectatic cornea. The most common cause is a sloughing corneal ulcer which perforates and heals with the formation ofpseudocornea by the organization of exudates and laying down of fibrous tissue. It is lined internally by iris. 2) Intercalary staphyloma: - It occurs at the limbus. It is lined internally by the root of iris and the anterior most poion of the ciliary body. The causes are perforating injuries to limbus, marginal corneal ulcer, anterior scleritis, Scleromalacia perforans, Complicated cataract surgery, secondary angle closure glaucoma. 3) Ciliary staphyloma: - This affects the ciliary zone that includes the region upto 8 mm behind the limbus. The ciliary body is incarcerated in the region of scleral ectasia. Causes are Developmental glaucoma, Primary or secondary glaucoma end stage, scleritis, trauma to ciliary region. 4) Equatorial staphyloma: - This occurs at the equatorial region of the eye with incarceration of the choroid.

This is thought to arise due to anatomical arrangement of the nerve fibres in the occulomotor nerve. Parasympathetic fibres that control the pupillary function are superficial and spared from ischemic injuries typical of diabetes. In ishchemia, the nerve fibres in the core of the nerve are the first to be affected, as good collateral supply exists in the nerve periphery. But, in subarchnoid hemorrhage, aneurysmal rupture, tumour & trauma; superficial fibres will also be compressed & damaged leading to loss of pupillary reflex. Other causes which can also cause pupillury sparing occulornotor palsy. - vascular diseases - hpeension Spontaneous recovery over a period of months is the rule.",
