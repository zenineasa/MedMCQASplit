Pterygium is always situated in the palpebral apeure. Pathologically Pterygium is a degenerative and hyperplastic condition of conjunctiva. The subconjunctival tissue undergoes elastotic degeneration and proliferates as vascularized granulation tissue under the epithelium, which ultimately encroaches the cornea. The corneal epithelium, Bowman's layer and stroma are destroyed. Etiology & Clinical features Pterygium is more common in people with excess outdoor exposure to sunlight (UV rays), dry heat, high wind and abundance of dust. Therefore it is more common in those who work outdoors. Clinically it presents as a triangular fold of conjunctiva encroaching the cornea in the area of palpebral apeure, usually on the nasal side. Other findings are stocker's line (deposition of iron) Ptergyium is an asymptomatic condition in the early stages, except for cosmetic intolerance. Visual disturbance or corneal astigmatism may occur. Visual disturbances are due to encroachment of pterygium on pupillary area or corneal astigmatism. Occasionally diplopia may occur due to limitation of ocular movements. Treatment Asymptomatic pterygium which is not progressive is best left alone. Surgical excision is the only satisfactory treatment and is indicated for: - (1) Cosmetic reasons, (2) Continued progression threatening to encroach onto the pupillary area (once the pterygium has encroached pupillary area, wait till it crosses on the other side), (3) Diplopia due to interference in ocular movement.",

Other associated symptoms include photophobia, lacrimation and ropy discharge from the eyes. Vernal keratoconjunctivitis, also known as \"spring catarrh, \" \"seasonal conjunctivitis\" or \"warm weather conjunctivitis\". The upper palpebral conjunctiva often has giant papillae that give a cobblestone appearance. A stringy conjunctival discharge and a fine, fibrinous pseudomembrane (Maxwell-Lyons sign) may be noted. Patients with atopic dermatitis (eczema) often also have atopic keratoconjunctivitis. The symptoms and signs are a burning sensation, mucoid discharge, redness, and photophobia.

The disease has the following characteristic features: Heterochrornia of iris. Diffuse stromal iris atrophy Fine KPs at the back of the cornea. Faint aqueous flare. The absence of posterior synechiae. A fairly common rubeosis iridis, sometimes associated with neovascularisation of the angle of the anterior chamber.

Treatment Fuch's heterchromic uveitis responds variably to steroids and cycloplegics. The complications of long-term use of these drugs may at times outweigh their potential benefits. Therefore, treatment with topical steroids is given to iritis which is sufficiently active to require the treatment, otherwise, the patient is routinely followed without giving any treatment.

Since there are no cells to detect light on the optic disc, a pa of the field of vision is not perceived. The brain fills in with surrounding detail and with information from the other eye, so the blind spot is not normally perceived.

Adults commonly affected include those individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), oncology patients, and patients on immunosuppresive therapy. There is characteristic hemorrhagic, full thickness retinitis. In early stage there are yellow-white exudates (areas of retinal necrosis) associated with areas of vasculitis and retinal hemorrhage. There may be exudative retinal detachment and ultimately, there occurs total retinal atrophy. There are three distinct variants of CMV retinitis:? 1. Classical (fulminant) retinitis It is necrotic retinitis Large areas of retinal hemorrhage along a whitened, edematous or necrotic retina, usually in posterior pole in the distribution of nerve fiber layer along the vascular arcades. It is also known as \"Pizza-Pic retinopathy\" or \"cottage cheese with catchup\". 2. Granular (indolent) retinitis Without edema, hemorrhage or vascular sheathing, progressing along active border of retinal periphery. 3. Perivascular retinitis Frosted branch angitis with retinal perivasculitis. Another finding in CMV retinitis is a white granular geographic lesion that clears centrally as it enlarges, leaving a quiet central area of retinal atrophy and mottled pigment epithelium. This has also been described as \"brush-fire\"pattern. It should be remembered that vitreous hemorrhage, though, is not common in CMV retinitis, it may occur after initiation of treatment of AIDS (HAA). In routine course there is no vireous hemorrhage or vitritis due to immunocompromised state of these patients. But, once the treatment of AIDS is staed, their immune status may improve, and capable of producing inflammation. Which may cause vitritis and vitreous hemorrhage.",

Staphyloma is divided anatomically into:? 1) Anterior staphyloma: - Protrusion and adhesion of iris to ectatic cornea. The most common cause is a sloughing corneal ulcer which perforates and heals with the formation ofpseudocornea by the organization of exudates and laying down of fibrous tissue. It is lined internally by iris. 2) Intercalary staphyloma: - It occurs at the limbus. It is lined internally by the root of iris and the anterior most poion of the ciliary body. The causes are perforating injuries to limbus, marginal corneal ulcer, anterior scleritis, Scleromalacia perforans, Complicated cataract surgery, secondary angle closure glaucoma. 3) Ciliary staphyloma: - This affects the ciliary zone that includes the region upto 8 mm behind the limbus. The ciliary body is incarcerated in the region of scleral ectasia. Causes are Developmental glaucoma, Primary or secondary glaucoma end stage, scleritis, trauma to ciliary region. 4) Equatorial staphyloma: - This occurs at the equatorial region of the eye with incarceration of the choroid.

Strabismus, which occurs as a result of visual loss, is the second most common mode of presentation. Thus, funduscopic examination through a well-dilated pupil must be performed in all cases of childhood strabismus. Retinoblastoma can cause secondary changes in the eye, including glaucoma, retinal detachment, and inflammation secondary to tumor necrosis. Pseudouveitis, with a red eye and pain and associated hypopyon and hyphema, is a rare presentation. It is characteristic of an infiltrating type of retinoblastoma in which the tumor cells invade the retina diffusely without forming a discrete tumor mass. Orbital inflammation mimicking orbital cellulitis may occur in eyes with necrotic tumors and does not necessarily imply extraocular extension. Proptosis is a more common presenting symptom in most underdeveloped countries. Histologically, the growth consists chiefly of small round cells with large nuclei resembling the cells of the nuclear layers of the retina. Many of these cells stain poorly, showing that they are undergoing necrosis. Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes like formation of cells resembling the rods and cones may be found.",

However, practically there is always some associated inflammation of the adjacent structures such as retina, vitreous, sclera and cornea. Due to close relationship between the anatomically distinct pa of the uveal tract, the inflammatory process usually involve the uvea as a whole and are generally not limited to a single pa. However, the uveitis is classified according to the pa of uvea which is clinically more affected. For example, the term iritis is used when iris appears to be more affected. Anatomical classification of uveitis 1. Anterior uveitis. It is inflammation of the uveal tissue from iris up to pars plicata of ciliary body. It may be subdivided into - Iritis, in which inflammation predominantly affects the iris. Iridocyctitis in which iris and pars plicata pa of ciliary body are equally involved, and Cyclitis, in which pars plicata pa of ciliary body is predominatly affected. 2. Intermediate uveitis. It includes inflammation of the pars plana and peripheral pa of the retina and underlying `choroid'. It is also called 'pars planitis'. 3. Posterior uveitis. It refers to inflammation of the choroid (choroiditis). Always there is associated inflamation of retina and hence the term `chorioretinitis' is used. 4. Panuveitis. It is inflammation of the whole uvea.",

        "exp": "The posterior cerebral aeries supply the coical surfaces of the occipital and medial temporal lobes. Damage to one occipital lobe (e. g., by trauma or by ischemia/infarction due to stroke) usually produces a contralateral homonymous hemianopia. Occlusion of the right posterior cerebral aery would therefore result in a left homonymous hemianopia; blindness in the left half of the visual field in both eyes. In addition, involvement of the medial temporal lobe might give rise to peduncular hallucinosis; visual illusions or elementary (unformed) hallucinations. Bilateral lesions would cause \"coical\" blindness, which does not affect the pupillary reflexes. Bitemporal hemianopia is a loss of vision in the temporal quadrants of the visual field. (It is also termed heteronymous hemianopia). This occurs in lesions of the optic chiasm, which may occur with pituitary tumors. Central scotoma is a loss of vision in the center of the visual field, with preservation of the peripheral fields. It is associated with optic neuritis, a common complication of multiple sclerosis. Superior quadrantanopia is caused by lesions in the upper poion of the contralateral temporal lobe. Ref: Ropper A. H., Samuels M. A. (2009). Chapter 13. Disturbances of Vision. In A. H. Ropper, M. A.

Vernal conjunctivitis occurs only in the warm months of the year. The disease characteristically produces giant (\"cobblestone\") papillae of the tarsal conjunctiva.

This disease affects the limbal region, producing a characteristic gelatinous thickening of the limbal conjunctiva, often associated with white accumulations of eosinophils and desquamated epithelial cells (\"Horner-Trantas dots\").

The optic disc is placed 3-4 mm nasal to the fovea (fovea is temporal to optic disc). There is a central depression in the optic disc called physiological cup. There are no light sensitive rods or cones to respond to a light stimulus. Therefore, it causes a break in the visual field called the blind spot or physiological blind spot which is presented as physiological absolute scotoma on visual field chaing. Optic disc is the location where ganglionic cells axons exit the eye to form the optic nerve and optic disc represents the beginning of the optic nerve. The optic nerve head (optic disc) in a normal human eye carries 1-1. 2 million neurons from the eye towards the brain. The optic disc is also the entry point for the major blood vessels (CRA & CRV) that supply the retina. CRA and CRV emerge through the physiological cup. Macula lutea (yellow spot) Macula lutea is a small yellowish area 5. 5 mm in diameter, situated at the posterior pole of the eyeball, temporal to the optic disc. Fovea centralis is the central depressed pa of the macula and has a diameter of 1. 5 mm. It is situated about 2 Disc diameter (3 mm) temporal to the temporal margin of optic disc. It is the most sensitive pa of retina, with lowest threshold for light and highest visual acuity because it contains only cones. Following pas are related to fovea centralis:? Foveola:- Forms the central floor of the fovea (0. 35 mm in diameter). Actually, it is foveola which is situated 2 Disc diameter (3 mm) temporal to temporal margin of the disc Umbo Is a tiny depression in the very centre of foveola.

Its administration can be directly observed. Therefore, compliance is higher than with tetracycline and can actually be measured, whereas, with the home administration of tetracycline, the level of compliance is unknown. Azithromycin has high efficacy and a low incidence of adverse effects. When adverse effects occur, they are usually mild; gastrointestinal upset and rash are the most common adverse events.

Because accommodation cannot occur, the near point moves way from the eye and images must be held at some distance from the eye to be clearly seen. This is similar to the situation in hyperopia where the converging power is too weak for the axial length of the eye. Hyperopes must accommodate to see distant objects clearly and thus have less accommodation available for near vision. Thus hyperopes, like presbyopes, must hold objects at a distance to see them clearly (hence the term \"farsighted\"). Ref: Riordan-Eva P. (2011). Chapter 21. Optics & Refraction. In P.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a DNA virus in the family Herpesviridae known for producing large cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions called an \"owl's eye\" effect. While CMV is found in almost everyone, and is usually fought off by the immune system, for people who are immunocompromised, by diseases, transplants, or chemotherapy the virus is not adequately destroyed and can cause damage to the eye and the rest of the body. HIV positive persons are most at risk, especially when the CD4 cell count decreases. It is usually treated by antivirals such as ganciclovir or foscarnet, which can be taken orally, intravenously, injected directly into the eye (intravitreal injection). Ganciclovir has good antiviral propey against herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, Epstein-Barr virus, and is at least 100 times more potent an inhibitor of CMV replication in vitro than acyclovir.

Infectious conjunctivitis (pinkeye) accounts for 70 percent of all cases and is caused by either a bacteria (usually staphylococci, pneumococci, streptococci or chlamydia trachomatis) or a virus. Bacterial conjunctivitis occurs in 50 percent of all cases, and viral conjunctivitis occurs in 20 percent. Infectious conjunctivitis is very contagious. Noninfectious conjunctivitis (which accounts for the remaining 30 percent of all cases), can be caused by allergies (such as pollen or grass), chemicals (such as air pollutants, smoke or household cleaners), or underlying diseases (such as rheumatoid ahritis, lupus, Kawasaki's disease, ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease). Additionally, conjunctivitis can be caused by hemorrhaging from trauma or changes in pressure within the head (subconjunctival hemorrhage).

        "question": "Accomodation is maximum in which of the following: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Children As the lens gets older, the central cells become sclerosed and more compressed, thus forming a relatively hard nucleus. Consequently, the lens tends to respond less to changes in tension of the capsule (during accommodation) Thus, a normal child of 10 years is able to see a small object clearly when it is only 7 cm from the eye, while a person of 30 years of age may not see clearly at a distance less than 14 cm Accommodation It is the process by which the eye changes optical power to maintain a clear image (focus) on an object as its distance changes. Accommodation acts like a reflex, but can also be consciously controlled. Mammals, birds and reptiles vary the optical power by changing the form of the elastic lens using the ciliary body (in humans up to 15 diopters). The young human eye can change focus from distance to 7 cm from the eye in 350 milliseconds. This dramatic change in focal power of the eye of approximately 12 diopters (a diopter is 1 divided by the focal length in meters) occurs as a consequence of a reduction in zonular tension induced by ciliary muscle contraction. The amplitude of accommodation declines with age. By the fifth decade of life the accommodative amplitude has declined so the near point of the eye is more remote than the reading distance. When this occurs the patient is presbyopic. Once presbyopia occurs, those who are emmetropic (do not require optical correction for distance vision) will need an optical aid for near vision; those who are myopic (nearsighted and require an optical correction for distance vision), will find that they see better at near without their distance correction; and those who are hyperopic (farsighted) will find that they may need a correction for both distance and near vision. Accommodation decreases to essentially 0 dioptres at the age of 70 years. It is normally accompanied by a convergence of the eyes to keep them directed at the same point, sometimes termed accommodation convergence reflex Induced effects of accommodation When someone accommodates to a near object, they also converge their eyes and constrict their pupils. The combination of these three movements (accommodation, convergence and miosis) is under the control of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and is referred to as the near triad.",

As such, all preterm babies are at risk for ROP, and very low bih weight is an additional risk factor. Normally, maturation of the retina proceeds in-utero and at term, the mature infant has fully vascularised retina. However, in preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. ROP occurs when the development of the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. The key disease element is fibrovascular proliferation. This is growth of abnormal new vessels that may regress, but frequently progresses. Patients with ROP are at greater risk for strabismus, glaucoma, cataracts and myopia later in life. Retinal vascularization is judged to be complete when vessels extend to the ora serrata. Retinal examination with scleral depression is generally recommended for patients born before 30-32 weeks gestation, with bihweight 1500 grams or less, or at the discretion of the treating neonatologist. The initial examination is usually performed at 4-6 weeks of life, and then repeated every 1-3 weeks until vascularization is complete (or until disease progression mandates treatment). The most difficult aspect of the differential diagnosis may arise from the similarity of two other diseases: Familal Exudative Vitreoretinopathy which is a genetic disorder that also disrupts the retinal vascularization in full-term infants. Persistent Fetal Vascular Syndrome also known as Persistent Hyperplastic Primary Vitreous that can cause a traction retinal detachment difficult to differentiate but typically unilateral. Prophylaxis is most impoant. In the management of premature infants, the Pa02 level from the umbilical aery should be monitored, levels of 50-100 mm Hg being regarded as unlikely to produce constriction of immature retinal vessels. Unsatisfactory guides includes 'pinkiness', oxygen given at less than 40% in the tent and vascular constriction as seen by ophthalmologist. In establishes cases: Peripheral retinal ablation is the mainstay of ROP treatment. The destruction of the avascular retina is performed with a solid state laser photocoagulation device Cryotherapy, a technique in which regional retinal destruction was done using a probe to freeze the desired areas, However, cryotherapy is no longer preferred for routine avascular retinal ablation in premature babies, due to the side effects of inflammation and lid swelling. Scleral buckling and/or vitrectomy surgery may be considered for severe ROP Intravitreal injection of bevacizumab has been repoed as a suppoive measure in aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity.",

Proptosis may be classified as follows:? 1) Unilateral Proptosis Proptosis of one eye. Inflammatory lesions:- Orbital cellulitis, abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, etc. Vascular disturbances:- Haemorrhage, varicose orbital veins, haemangioma, etc. Cysts and tumour:- Dermoid cyst, osteoma, lymphoma, lymphosarcoma, glioma, meningioma of optic nerve, retinoblastoma and metastatic deposits in orbit. Systemic diseases - Leukemias and endocrine disturbances such as Graves' disease and thyrotropic exophthalmos in initial stages. Paralysis of extraocular muscles as in complete ophthalmoplegia. Mucocele of PNS' - Frontal (most common), ethmoid, maxillary. The most common cause of unilateral proptosis in children is orbital cellulitis. The most common cause of unilateral proptosis in adults is thyroid ophthalmopathy. 2) Bilateral Proptosis Proptosis of both eyes. Developmental anomalies of the skull- Oxycephaly (tower skull). Endocrine exophthalmos, both thyrotoxic and thyrotropic. Inflammatory lesions - Cavernous sinus thrombosis. Tumours - lymphosarcoma, lymphoma, pseudotumour, nephroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma. Systemic disease - Histocytosis (Hand - schuller christon disease), amyloidosis, wegner's granulomatosis. Most common cause of bilateral proptosis in children Neuroblastoma (mc), Leukemia (Chloroma) Most common cause of bilateral proptosis in adults is thyroid ophthalmopathy. 3) Intermittent proptosis Proptosis developing intermittently and rapidly in one eye when venous stasis is induced by forward bending or lowering the head, turning the head forcibly, hyperextension of the neek, coughing, forced expiration with or without compression of the nostrils, or pressure on jugular veins. The most impoant casue is orbital varix (varicocele). 4) Pulsatile proptosis:- Pulsatile proptosis is seen in caroticocovernous fistula; saccular aneurysm of ophthalmic aery; and due to transmitted cerebral pulsation as seen in meningocele, neurofibromatosis and traumatic or operative hiatus.",

        "exp": "Ans. A: Iris and Ciliary Body Anterior uveitis include iritis, anterior cyclitis and iridocyclitis Anatomical classification of uveitis Uveitis may be classified anatomically into anterior, intermediate, posterior and panuveitic forms, based on which pa of the eye is primarily affected by the inflammation. \"Anterior uveitis\" (or iridocyclitis) is the inflammation of the iris and anterior chamber. Anywhere from two-thirds to 90% of uveitis cases are anterior in location. Symptoms include red eye, injected conjunctiva, pain and decreased vision. Signs include dilated ciliary vessels, presence of cells and flare in the anterior chamber, and keratic precipitates (\"KP\") on the posterior surface of the cornea. \"Intermediate uveitis\" (pars planitis) consists of vitritis - inflammatory cells in the vitreous cavity, sometimes with snowbanking, or deposition of inflammatory material on the pars plana. \"Posterior uveitis\" (or chorioretinitis) is the inflammation of the retina and choroid. \"Pan-uveitis\" is the inflammation of all the layers of the uvea. Systemic disorders associated with uveitis Ankylosing spondylitis Behcet's disease Chronic granulomatous disease Enthesitis Inflammatory bowel disease Juvenile rheumatoid ahritis Kawasaki's disease Multiple sclerosis Polyaeritis nodosa Psoriatic ahritis Reactive ahritis Sarcoidosis Systemic lupus erythematosus Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome Whipple's disease Lyme disease Infectious causes Uveitis may be a (normal) immune response to fight an infection inside the eye. While representing the minority of patients with uveitis, such possible infections include: Brucellosis Herpes simplex Herpes zoster Leptospirosis Lyme disease Toxocariasis Toxoplasmosis Uveitis Syndromes Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE) Birdshot retinochoroidopathy Fuchs Heterochromic Iridocyclitis Multifocal Choroiditis and Panuveitis Syndrome Masquerade syndromes Masquerade syndromes are ophthalmic disorders that clinically present as either an anterior or posterior uveitis, but are not primarily inflammatory. The following are some of the most common: Anterior segment - Intraocular foreign body - Juvenile xanthogranuloma - Leukemia - Retinal detachment - Retinoblastoma Posterior segment - Lymphoma - Multiple sclerosis - Retinitis pigmentosa - Retinoblastoma Symptoms Redness of the eye Blurred vision Sensitivity to light (photophobia) Dark, floating spots along the visual field Eye pain Treatment Uveitis is typically treated with glucocoicoid steroids, either as topical eye drops (prednisolone acetate) or oral therapy with coicosteroids. But before administration of coicosteroids, corneal ulcers are ruled out, typically by a Florescence Dye test. In addition to coicosteroids, topical cycloplegics, such as atropine or homatropine, may be used. In some cases an injection of PSTTA (posterior subtenon triamcinolone acetate) may also be given to reduce the swelling of the eye. Antimetabolite medications, such as methotrexate are often used for recalcitrant or more aggressive cases of uveitis.",

Owing to the occurrence of a wide range of complications associated with RBA, anesthesiologists and ophthalmologists began to turn to peribulbar anesthesia (PBA), which consists of introducing a needle into the extraconal space, as a theoretically safer form of regional ocular anesthesia. Peribulbar anesthesia (PBA) was formally described in 1986 and is based on the \"tissue compament principle. \" The latter refers to the phenomenon wherein a needle is inseed into a compament and the local anesthetic injected spreads by viue of its pressure and volume throughout the compament. With PBA a relatively large volume (8-12 ml) of local anesthetic is injected into the extraconal space; to provide adequate analgesia and akinesis of the globe, the extraconal local anesthetic must spread to the intraconal space",

FA in central serous chorioretinopathy gives smoke stack and ink blot appearance. Cystoid Macular Edema (CME) Definition and Etiology - CME is a final common pathological response of retina to a variety of insults, consisting of fluid accumulation in outer plexiform (Henle's) layer and inner nuclear layer of the central macula that results in the formation of visible cystic space. - Initially fluid accumulates intracellularly in Muller cells, with subsequent rupture forming microcystic spaces. These coalesce into larger cavities and may progress to lamellar hole formation at the fovea with irreversible impairment of central vision. - CME is commonly a/w intraocular inflammations (eg pars planitis), vascular incompetence (diabetes & RVO), vitreoretinal traction, inherited diseases (eg RP or dominant CME), medications (epinephrine, latanoprost) and most commonly following cataract surgeryQ (k/a Irvine-Gass syndrome). Agiographically evident CME is seen in 60% ECCE, 20% ICCE and 10-20% phacoemulsification cases (all uncomplicated). Clinically significant CME with decreased visual acuity, however, is seen only in 0. 2-3% patients. - Planned posterior capsulorrhexis during phacoemulsification does not 1/t an increase prevalence of CME, whereas those with inadveent rupture of posterior capsule &/or persistent vitreous traction to anterior segment are at highest risk.

O12 It is a crystal that is used as a lasing medium for solid-state lasers. The dopant, triply ionized neodymium, typically replaces yttrium in the crystal structure of the yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG), since they are of similar size. Generally the crystalline host is doped with around 1% neodymium by atomic percent. Nd: YAG lasers are optically pumped using a flashtube or laser diodes. Nd: YAG lasers typically emit light with a wavelength of 1064 nm, in the infrared. However, there are also transitions near 940, 1120, 1320, and 1440 nm. Nd: YAG lasers operate in both pulsed and continuous mode. Pulsed Nd: YAG lasers are typically operated in the so called Q-switching mode: Nd: YAG absorbs mostly in the bands between 730-760 nm and 790-820 nm. At low current densities krypton flashlamps have higher output in those bands than do the more common xenon lamps, which produce more light at around 900 nm. The former are therefore more efficient for pumping Nd: YAG lasers Uses Nd: YAG lasers are used in ophthalmology to correct posterior capsular opacification, a condition that may occur after cataract surgery, and for peripheral iridotomy in patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma, where it has superseded surgical iridectomy. Frequency-doubled Nd: YAG lasers (wavelength 532 nm) are used for pan-retinal photocoagulation in patients with diabetic retinopathy. In oncology, Nd: YAG lasers can be used to remove skin cancers. These lasers are also used extensively in the field of cosmetic medicine for laser hair removal and the treatment of minor vascular defects such as spider veins on the face and legs. Using hysteroscopy the Nd: YAG laser has been used for removal of uterine septa within the inside of the uterus. In podiatry, the Nd: YAG laser is being used to treat onychomycosis, which is fungus infection of the toenail.",

Clinical features Symptoms are similar to bacterial corneal ulcers but in general, they are less marked than the equal size bacterial ulcer. On the other hand, signs are very prominent, i. e. signs are more prominent than symptoms, Following signs can be seen: - i) Greyish-white dry looking ulcer with the elevated rolled out feathery & hyphate margins. ii) Feathery finger-like extension into surrounding stroma under intact epithelium. iii) A sterile immune ring (yellow line) of Wesseley. iv) Multiple small satellite lesions. v) Non-sterile (infected) hypopyon (Pseudohypopyon-Hence penetrated the endothelium) vi) Perforation is rare and comes vascularization is conspicuously absent. Diagnosis o Examination of wet KOH will show:- i) Filamentous fungi (branched septate hyphae ):- Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium. ii) Non-filamentous (yeast-like fungi): - Candida. Treatment of fungal corneal ulcer Treatment of corneal fungal ulcer involves:- 1) Specific (definitive) treatment, and 2) Adjunctive (concurrent) treatment. 1) Definitive treatment: - It includes antifungal drugs: - A) Topical antifungals - i) For filamentous fungi (Aspergillus, Fusarium):- Natamycin (5%) eye drops (drug of choice), Miconazole ointment, Amphotericin B drops. ii) For yeast (Candida): - Amphotericin B (Drug of choice), nystatin, flucytosine. B) Systemic antifungals: - May be required in severe cases.

The oculomotor nerve is responsible for the efferent limb of the light reflex - it drives the muscles that constrict the pupil.

The optic nerve connects to the pretectal nucleus of the upper midbrain, bypassing the lateral geniculate nucleus and the primary visual coex. Neuron 2: From the pretectal nucleus, axons connect to neurons in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, whose axons run along both the left and right oculomotor nerves.

        "exp": "Ans. C: Lagophthalmos Lagophthalmos is a condition in which there is incomplete closure of the palpebral apeure when an attempt is made to shut the eyes Lagophthalmos It is defined as the inability to close the eyelids completely. Blinking covers the eye with a thin layer of tear fluid, thereby promoting a moist environment necessary for the cells of the exterior pa of the eye. The tears also flush out foreign bodies and wash them away. This is crucial to maintain lubrication and proper eye health. If this process is impaired, as in lagophthalmos, the eye can suffer abrasions and infections. Lagopthalmos leads to corneal drying and ulceration Pathophysiology Lagophthalmos can arise from a malfunction of the Facial nerve. Lagopthalmos can also occur in comatose patients having a decrease in orbicularis tone, in patients having palsy of the facial nerve (7th cranial nerve), and in people with severe skin disorders such as ichthyosis. Today, lagophthalmos may arise after an overenthusiastic upper blepharoplasty. Blepharoplasty is an operation performed to remove excessive skin overlying the upper eyelid (suprapalpebral hooding) that often occurs with aging. This can appreciably improve the patient's appearance, and make the patient look younger. If, however, excessive skin is removed, the appearance is unnatural and \"lagophthalmos\" is one of the signs of such excessive skin removal.",

Within the anterior segment are two fluid-filled spaces: The anterior chamber between the posterior surface of the cornea (i. e. the corneal endothelium) and the iris. The depth of anterior chamber of eye is 2. 5 mm. It is shallow in the very young and the deep. The posterior chamber between the iris and the front face of the vitreous. Aqueous humor fills these spaces within the anterior segment and provides nutrients to the surrounding structures. The posterior segment is the back five-sixths of the eye that includes the anterior hyaloid membrane and all of the optical structures behind it: the vitreous humor, retina, choroid, and optic nerve. The radii of the anterior and posterior sections are 8 mm and 12 mm, respectively. The point of junction is called the limbus. On the other side of the lens is the second humour, the aqueous humour, which is bounded on all sides: by the lens, ciliary body, suspensory ligaments and by the retina.

Image Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) It is a reflex eye movement that stabilizes images on the retina during head movement by producing an eye movement in the direction opposite to head movement, thus preserving the image on the center of the visual field. For example, when the head moves to the right, the eyes move to the left, and vice versa. Since slight head movement is present all the time, the VOR is very impoant for stabilizing vision: patients whose VOR is impaired find it difficult to read using print, because they cannot stabilize the eyes during small head tremors. The VOR does not depend on visual input and works even in total darkness or when the eyes are closed. However, in the presence of light, the fixation reflex is also added to the movement.",

This will only last a few moments. If possible, treat all the children in the family. F - Clean Faces Families and individuals can do something to protect themselves from infection by increasing the number of times a child washes his/her face.

Developmental Cataract may present - At bih (Congenital Cataract) - During fuher development: Infancy to Adulthood The location of the cataract in paicular layer of the lens is an indicator of the stage of development of the cataract i. e the earliest cataracts lie in the nucleus whereas the latest ones in the superficial coex.",

Retained Intraocular Foreign Body A retained foreign body may be associated with several types of glaucoma. Loss of integrity of the globe as a result of penetration may produce a shallow or flat anterior chamber. This, in association with attendant inflammation, can result in secondary angle-closure glaucoma with extensive peripheral anterior synechiae. Frank disruption of the lens capsule may produce lens paicle glaucoma. Cataract formation may produce phacomorphic glaucoma or phacolytic glaucoma if the cataract becomes hypermature. Siderotic glaucoma may occur as a late manifestation of a retained iron-containing foreign body. Diagnosis: Dilated fundus exam may allow easy visualization of the retained foreign body. Occasionally, a foreign body is located in the anterior chamber and is found on gonioscopy. If the media are not clear enough to allow fundoscopic examination, additional studies including plain films, computed tomography, and ultrasonography are helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Reduced retinal function may also be evident with a reduction electroretinogram activity.",
