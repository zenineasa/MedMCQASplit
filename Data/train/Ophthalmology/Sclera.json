        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e.. Myopia [Ref: Parson 21st/ep. 223). Staphylomao Staphyloma is an abnormal protrusion of uveal tissue through a weak and thin portion of cornea or sclera, o So, a staphyloma is lined internally by uveal tissue and externally by weak cornea or sclera. o Staphyloma is divided anatomically into: -Anterior staphyloma: - Protrusion and adhesion of iris to ectatic cornea. The most common cause is a sloughing corneal ulcer which perforates and heals with the formation of pseudocornea by the organization of exudates and laying down of fibrous tissue. It is lined internally by iris. Intercalary' staphyloma: - It occurs at the limbus. It is lined internally by the root of iris and the anterior most portion of the ciliary'- body. The causes are perforating injuries to limbus, marginal corneal ulcer, anterior scleritis, Scleromalacia perforans, Complicated cataract surgery, secondary angle closure glaucoma. Ciliary staphyloma: - This affects the ciliary zone that includes the region upto 8 mm behind the limbus. The ciliary body is incarcerated in the region of scleral ectasia. Causes arc Developmental glaucoma, Primary or secondary glaucoma end stage, scleritis, trauma to ciliary region. Equatorial staphyloma: - This occurs at the equatorial region of the eye with incarceration of the choroid. Causes are scleritis, degenerative myopia and chronic uncontrolled glaucoma. Posterior staphyloma: - Occurs at posterior pole and is lined internally by choroid. Degenerative high axial myopia is the most common cause.",
