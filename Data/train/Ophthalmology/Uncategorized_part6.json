        "question": "Corneal transparency is maintained by all except -",
        "exp": "Corneal transparency The main physiologic function of the cornea is to act as a major refracting medium so that a clear retinal image is formed. Maintenance of corneal transparency of high degree is a pre-requisite to perform these functions, as 90% of light has to be transmitted through the cornea. The factors that maintain corneal transparency can be divided into two groups:- A) Anatomical factors Anatomical factors which maintain corneal transparency are:- i) Corneal epithelium and tear film The normal epithelium is transparent due to the homogenity of the refractive index throughout. Normal precorneal tear film also plays an important role in maintaining the transparency of epithelium. Therefore epithelial edema is more damaging on visual acuity than that of stromal edema. ii) The absence of blood vessels and myelinated nerves The cornea is avascular except for the capillary palisades at the limbal margin. Vascularization of cornea interferes with its functional properties, especially its transparency. There are sensory nerves in the cornea, through the long ciliary nerve. These nerves are non- myelinated, which is helpful to maintain cornea transparently. iii) The arrangement of stronzal lamellae Two theories have been put forward to explain the role of the peculiar arrangement of the stromal lamellae in corneal transparency:- Maurice theory:- The cornea is transparent because the uniform collagen fibrils are arranged in a regular lattice so that scattered light is destroyed by the mutual interference. As long as the fibrils are regularly arranged in a lattice, separated by less than a wavelength of 4000- 7000 A\u00b0, the cornea will remain transparent. Goldman & Benedek's theory:- The Stromal fibrils are small in relationship to light and do not interfere with light transmission unless they are larger than one half a wavelength of light. B) Physiological factors (Corneal hydration) Physiological factors are those which keep the cornea in a relative state of cornea dehydration by maintaining corneal hydration. The normal cornea maintains itself in a state of relatice dehydration, which is essential for corneal transparency. The water content of normal cornea is approximately 80%, which is the highest water content of any connective tissue in the body. If its hydration becomes above 80% due to corneal edema, its transparency reduces. There are certain factors that maintain the correct amount of fluid in the cornea: i) Stromal swelling pressure and imbibition pressure Swelling pressure (SP) is the 'keystone' of corneal biophysics. It is a pressure (50-60 mm Hg) exerted by the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) of the corneal stroma and GAGs are the main cause of hydration the cornea. GAG acts like a sponge. It has anionic charges, so GAGs cause repulsion of each other. As there is separation, the cornea can swell and get hydrated. This is known as swelling pressure. The GAG anionic repulsion expands the tissue and sucks in the fluid equal to the pressure called imbibition pressure (IP). So, the imbibition pressure should be equivalent to swelling pressure, which is the case in vitro. However, in vivo intraocular tension (TOT) prevent imbibition of water, therefore, IP is reduced by the values equivalent to IOT:- IP = IOT - SP = 20-50 = -30 ii) The barrier function of limiting layers The epithelium and endothelium act as barriers to the excessive flow of water and diffusion of electrolyte's into the stroma due to their semi-permeable membrane. The epithelium is a hundred timeless permeable than the endothelium. It prevents excess imbibition of water from the tears. The endothelium is more permeable than epithelium. It prevents excess imbibition of water from the aqueous. The barrier function of the endothelium is calcium dependent. iii) Endothelial pump The endothelium has an active pump which is very necessary for normal corneal hydration and thickness. It is now established that the corneal endothelium plays a predominant role in controlling fluid transport due to several enzyme pump systems present in it. The enzyme pump systems which collectively regulate fluid and ionic transport across the endothelium are:- Na+/ K+ ATPase pump, Bicarbonate dependent ATPase, Carbonic anhydrase enzyme, Na+/H+ pump iv) Evaporation from corneal surface Evaporation of the water from the precorneal tear fluid film also affect corneal hydration by changing osmolarity on the corneal surface. v) Intraocular pressure If the intraocular pressure increases, corneal edema occurs. As already explained IP = IOT- SP or IOT = SP + IP = 50 + (-30) If IOT exceeds the swelling pressure epithelial edema will occur (as in glaucoma) Thus, these five factors help to maintain corneal hydration. The most important of these is the endothelial pump mechanism.",

However, chronic UV exposure is accepted as a causative agent. Treatment options: Pterygia are usually treated only when they interfere with vision. The standard therapy is surgical removal. Pterygia affect astigmatism and are associated with increased rates of macular degeneration; however, it is unclear whether treatment reduces this risk. Eyes with a pterygium or previous pterygium surgery (but not pinguecula) have a higher risk of incident late age-related maculopathy (ARM) (OR 3. 3, 95% CI 1. 1-10. 3) and early ARM (OR 1. 8, 95% CI 1. 1-2. 9).

Trachoma is characterized by mixed follicular and papillary conjunctivitis. Trachoma is cuased by chlamydia trachomatis seroptypes A, B, Ba and C. The organism is epitheliotropic and produces intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies called HP bodies (Halberstaedter prowazeke bodies). Clinical features of Trachoma The clinical course of trachoma is determined by the presence or absence of secondary infection. In the absence of such infection, a pure trachoma is so mild and symptomless that the disease is usually neglected and symptoms include mild foreign body sensation and occasionally lacrimation. But, mostly the picture is complicated by secondary infection and may sta with typical symptoms of acute mucopurulent conjunctivitis. On examination the conjunctiva and cornea, both are involved:? A) Conjunctival signs Congestion of upper tarsal and forniceal conjunctiva. Conjunctival follicles:- Boiled sagograin like follicles are commonly seen on upper tarsal conjunctiva and fornix. Sometimes follicles are present on bulbar conjunctiva and presence of follicles on bulbar conjunctiva is pathognomonic of trachoma. The characteristic feature of trachoma follicle is the presence of necrosis and leber cells (large multinucleated cells) which differentiate it from follicular conjunctivitis. Papillary hyperplasia:- Papillae are reddish, flat topped raised areas which give red and velvety appearance to the tarsal conjunctiva. Conjunctival scarring: - Linear scar present in the sulcus subtarsalis is called Arlt's line. Concretion: - May be formed due to accumulation of dead epithelial cells and inspissated mucus in depressions called glands of Henle. B) Corneal signs Superficial keratitis Herbe follicles: - Follicles in the limbal area. Pannus:- Infiltration of cornea associated with vascularization. Corneal ulcer.. - At the advancing edge of pannus. Herbe pits: - Left after healing of Herbe follicles in the limbal area. Corneal opacity Sequelae and complications of trachoma Sequelae and complications of trachoma are:? Lids: - Entropion, trichiasis, tylosis, ptosis, madarosis, ankyloblepharon. Conjunctival: - Concretions, pseudocyst, Xerosis (dryness), symblepharon. Corneal: - Corneal opacity, ectasia, corneal xerosis, total corneal pannus, corneal ulcer.

Post-operative therapy with Mitomycin-C drops has been tried, but complications such as scleral necrosis, cataract and iritis have been repoed Pterygium/ Surfer's Eye It most often refers to a benign growth of the conjunctiva. A pterygium commonly grows from the nasal side of the sclera. It is usually present in the palpebral fissure. It is associated with, and thought to be caused by ultraviolet-light exposure (e. g., sunlight), low humidity, and dust. Pterygium in the conjunctiva is characterized by elastotic degeneration of collagen (actinic elastosis) and fibrovascular proliferation. It has an advancing poion called the head of the pterygium, which is connected to the main body of the pterygium by the neck. Sometimes a line of iron deposition can be seen adjacent to the head of the pterygium called Stocker's line. The location of the line can give an indication of the pattern of growth. The pterygium is composed of several segments: - Fuchs' Patches (minute gray blemishes that disperse near the pterygium head) - Stocker's Line (a brownish line composed of iron deposits) - Hood (fibrous nonvascular poion of the pterygium) - Head (apex of the pterygium, typically raised and highly vascular) - Body (fleshy elevated poion congested with touous vessels) - Superior Edge (upper edge of the triangular or wing-shaped poion of the pterygium) - Inferior Edge (lower edge of the triangular or wing-shaped poion of the ptyerygium). Symptoms of pterygium It include persistent redness, inflammation, foreign body sensation, tearing, which can cause bleeding, dry and itchy eyes. In advanced cases the pterygium can affect vision as it invades the cornea with the potential of obscuring the optical center of the cornea and inducing astigmatism and corneal scarring Management As it is a benign growth, pterygium typically does not require surgery unless it grows to such an extent that it covers the pupil, obstructing vision or presents with acute symptoms. Some of the irritating symptoms can be addressed with aificial tears. However, no reliable medical treatment exists to reduce or even prevent pterygium progression. Definitive treatment is achieved only by surgical removal. Long-term follow up is required as pterygium may recur even after complete surgical correction. If there is recurrence after surgery or if recurrence of pterygium is thought to be vision threatening, it is possible to use strontium (90. Sr) plaque therapy. 90. Sr is a radioactive substance that produces beta paicles, which penetrate a very sho distance into the cornea at the site of the operation.

        "question": "Patient complains of distoed vision after wearing spectacles, which worsens in both meridians progressively. Which of the following is not true about this condition?",
        "exp": "Ans. d. Cylindrical lens increases the distoion Distoion occurs when the transverse magnification is not constant but changes as distance from the axis increases within a transverse plane. In pincushion distoion, magnification increases as distance from the axis increases (in the same transverse plane), whereas in barrel distoion, magnification decreases as distance from the axis increases. Distoion is field dependent, pupil independent, and stigmatic. Pincushion distoion occurs in practically all spectacle corrected aphakes and is occasionally seen in high myopes after clear lens extraction. ' Aniseikonia Aniseikonia is an ocular condition where there is a significant difference in the perceived size of images. It can occur as an overall difference between the two eyes, or as a difference in a paicular meridian Causes: Aniseikonia can occur naturally or be induced by the correction of a refractive error, usually anisometropia (having significantly different refractive errors between each eye) or antimetropia (being myopic in one eye and hyperopic in the other) Meridional aniseikonia occurs when these refractive differences only occur in one meridian. Refractive surgery can cause aniseikonia in much the same way that it is caused by glasses and contacts. One cause of significant anisometropia and subsequent aniseikonia has been aphakia Symptoms: When this magnification difference becomes excessive the effect can cause diplopia, suppression, disorientation, eyestrain, headache, and dizziness and balance disorders. Treatment: Treatment is done by changing the optical magnification propeies of the auxiliary optics (corrective lenses). The optical magnification propeies of spectacle lenses can be adjusted by changing parameters like the base curve, veex distance, and center thickness. Contact lenses may also provide a better optical magnification to reduce the difference in image size. The difference in magnification can also be eliminated by a combination of contact lenses and glasses (creating a weak telescope system). The optimum design solution will depend on different parameters like cost, cosmetic implications, and if the patient can tolerate wearing a contact lens. When the image disparity is astigmatic (cylindrical) and not uniform, images can appear wider, taller, or diagonally different. When the disparity appears to vary across the visual field (field-dependent aniseikonia), as may be the case with an epiretinal membrane or retinal detachment, the aniseikonia cannot fully be corrected with traditional optical techniques like standard corrective lenses. However, paial correction often improves the patient's vision comfo significantly. Little is known yet about the possibilities of using surgical intervention to correct aniseikonia.",

IOL selection in uveitis patients depends on the type of uveitis, expected surgical trauma and expected a post\u00adoperative inflammatory reaction. Hydrophilic acrylic foldable JOLs and heparin surface-modified (HSM) PIVEVIA I Ls are used most widely and tolerated in uveitis patients. However, IOL implantation in a patient of JRA having uveitis is highly controversial. Implantation of IOL in such patients carries a greater danger for development fibrosis, secondary retrolental membranes and lens capture.

Causes may include: Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of ahritis that mainly affects the spine. This can cause recurrent ahritis. It is mostly associated with HLA B27 Reiter's syndrome is an inflammatory ahritis common in young men - often caused by chlamydia infection. It is mostly associated with HLA B27 Psoriatic ahropathy is a form of ahritis that nearly a quaer of people with psoriasis may develop. It causes pain, swelling and stiffness in joints. Psoriasis is an immune-related disease of the skin and joints. Inflammatory bowel disease causes inflammation, ulcers and scarring to the wall of the intestine but can affect other pas of the body as well. Juvenile rheumatoid ahritis (JRA) is a kind of ahritis (inflammation of the joints) in children. Uveitis is the most common eye problem that can develop in children with JRA. Children with JRA may get uveitis before JRA is even diagnosed, or it can occur many years later. Herpes is a common viral infection that causes oral or genital herpes. It mostly affects only one eye, but it can cause recurrent uveitis. Sarcoidosis is a kind of inflammation that can affect many pas of the body. Its cause is unknown. Fuch's heterochromic iridocyclitis is a chronic kind of iritis. Its cause is unknown. It may cause rapid increase in eye pressure, requiring immediate treatment. Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects different pas of the body, including the skin, joints, blood, and kidneys and is related to the body's immune system. Intraocular lens surgically implanted to replace a cataract lens. Uveitis can be caused by trauma related to cataract surgery. The presence of aificial lens can cause anterior uveitis. Posner-Schlossman syndrome (PSS) is an uncommon inflammatory eye condition that usually affects one eye at a time. It typically affects young to middle-aged adults who develop high pressure inside the eye and mild inflammation. Rheumatoid ahritis is a chronic inflammation of the joints that can cause permanent joint damage and disability. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease. It can be cured, but if left untreated, the late stages of the disease can cause hea problems, abnormalities, mental illness, blindness and death. Although on the decline over the past decade, it has seen more cases in recent years. Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria that usually attacks the lungs. Lyme disease is a disease caused by bacteria that are transmitted to people from the bite of a deer tick. It often causes a \"bull's-eye\" rash around the bite, with symptoms such as fever, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint aches. B. Causes of Intermediate Uveitis In more than two thirds of all cases of intermediate uveitis, the exact cause is unknown. The remaining third of all cases are thought to be caused by conditions such as: Sarcoidosis can affect many pas of the body. Its cause is unknown. MS (multiple sclerosis) an inflammatory disease that affects the brain and spinal cord Lyme disease, a disease caused by bacteria that are transmitted to people from the bite of a deer tick. It often causes a \"bull's-eye\" rash around the bite, with symptoms such as fever, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint aches C. Causes of Posterior Uveitis Following is a list of common causes of posterior uveitis. In more than one in ten cases of uveitis, however, the exact cause is unknown. Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a parasite. People may become infected from eating raw or undercooked meats, drinking unpasteurized milk, cleaning cat litter boxes, or working in gardens or playing in sandboxes that contain cat feces. Cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMV retinitis) is a serious eye infection of the retina. It is a threat to people with weak immune systems, such as people with HIV, people undergoing chemotherapy, and people who have had organ transplants. Without treatment, CMV retinitis can destroy the retina and damage the optic nerve, resulting in blindness. Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects different pas of the body, including the skin, joints, blood, and kidneys and is related to the body's immune system. Birdshot retinochoroidopathy may be an autoimmune disease. People with this condition may experience blurry vision, sensitivity to light, floaters, and night blindness. In most people, it affects both eyes. It causes white or yellow lesions scattered around the retina that can damage the retina and affect the vitreous. Sarcoidosis is a kind of inflammation that can affect many pas of the body. Its cause is unknown. Acute retinal necrosis is a condition that often causes retinal detachment and vision loss. Signs may include red eyes, eye pain and hazy/blurry vision. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a virus that infects nearly every adult. When infection with EBV occurs during adolescence or young adulthood, it often causes mononucleosis. Behcet's disease is a rare, chronic inflammatory disease. The cause of Behcet's disease is unknown. If often begins when individuals are in their 20s or 30s, although it can happen at any age. Uveitis is very common with people suffering from Behcet's, which can cause acute uveitis that happens soon after onset of Behcet's disease. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease. It can be cured, but if left untreated, the late stages of the disease can cause hea problems, abnormalities, mental illness, blindness and death. Although on the decline over the past decade, it has seen more cases in recent years. Serpiginous choroidopathy is related to uveitis - a rare condition that affects the pa of the uvea called the choroid. It can affect the vitreous body and cause lesions on the retina that result in vision loss. D. Causes of Panuveitis As with other kinds of uveitis, the cause of panuveitis is often unknown. Other possible causes include: Sarcoidosis is a kind of inflammation that can affect many pas of the body. Its cause is unknown. Behcet's disease is a rare, chronic inflammatory disease. The cause of Behcet's disease is unknown. If often begins when individuals are in their 20s or 30s, although it can happen at any age.

Although on the decline over the past decade, it has seen more cases in recent years. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome is an inflammatory condition that involves the eyes and meninges (coverings of the brain). The condition is most common in Asians and American Indians. It often causes uveitis in both eyes and retinal detachments, and can result in serious vision loss and blindness. Tuberculosis (TB) Fungal Retinitis fungal infections can be a problem for people with weakened immune systems, including very premature babies and people with HIV or AIDS",

During right horizontal (lateral) gaze the central pathway is:- Left frontal eye field -> contralateral (right) PPRF -> Right abducens nuclei (causing abduction of right eye) -> Right medial longitudinal fasciculus -> contralateral oculomoter nerve -> medial rectus (adduction of left eye). So, abduction of right eye is accompanied by adduction of left eye for right lateral gaze. In right internuclear ophthalmoplegia there is damage to right medial longitudinal fasciculus. Therefore, signal transmission is normal upto abducens nucleus (abduction of right eye is possible), but it cannot be further transmitted to controlateral 'oculomotor nucleus (adduction of left eye is not possible). Thus, on attempting right lateral gaze, abduction of right eye is possible but adduction of left eye does not occur. There may be saccades in right eye during abduction. Convergence is maintained in internuclear ophthalmoplagia as the pathway for convergence is different and does not involve medial longitudinal fasciculus. The convergence pathways run directly into the midbrain without involving MLF.",

Formic acid is the metabolite responsible for toxicity and the metabolic acidosis that occurs with methanol poisoning. Formic acid enter the brain and ocular tissues causing central nervous system depression as well as retinal and optic nerve injury. Loss of vision may be complete and sudden within a few hours after drinking methanol or may occasionally be noted about 3 days after exposure. Pupillary reflexes are sluggish. Ophthalmoscopic examination shows swelling and hyperemia of the optic nerve head, distention of the veins, and peripapillary edema of the retina. Acute methanol poisoning causes nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Ref: Smith J. C., Quan D. (2011). Chapter 179. Alcohols. In J. E. Tintinalli, J. S. Stapczynski, D. M. Cline, O. J. Ma, R. K.

When a light is shined in her right eye, there is no pupillary response in either eye. However, upon shining a light in her left eye, both ipsilateral and contralateral pupillary responses are apparent. Her extraocular movements are intact. What is the most likely location of her lesion?",
        "exp": "Know your cranial nerves! This woman has a \"Marcus-Gunn pupil, \" with a defect in the afferent pathway of the optic nerve (in this case on the right side). Recall that the afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex is the optic nerve (CN II); the efferent limb is the oculomotor nerve (CN III; parasympathetic fibers). When light is shined into her right eye, because her right optic nerve is not functioning properly, the light signal is not transmitted to the CNS, resulting in no pupillary response. As light is shined into her left eye, the left optic nerve transmits the signal to the CNS, which then sends an outbound signal through both the right and left oculomotor nerves to cause pupillary constriction in both eyes. The oculomotor nerve innervates all extraocular muscles except the lateral rectus (innervated by the abducens nerve), and the superior oblique (innervated by the trochlear nerve. The oculomotor nerve also mediates pupillary constriction (parasympathetic fibers), eyelid opening (levator palpebrae), and innervates the ciliary muscle (allowing accommodation). A patient with a lesion of the left optic nerve would have no pupillary responses in either eye when shining a light in the left eye; pupillary responses would be present in both eyes when shining a light in the right eye.

On examination, lacrimation, lid edema, conjunctival injection, a steamy cornea, and a fixed mid-dilated pupil are seen. She has markedly elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and a visual acuity of 20/200 in her right eye. She has no family history of eye diseases. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "This patient has acute closed-angle glaucoma, as evidenced by the pain and redness of her eye, the steamy cornea, her description of halos around lights, and her markedly elevated intraocular pressure. The fixed mid-dilated pupil indicates ischemia to the iris. Unlike open angle glaucoma, closed-angle glaucoma (also called narrow-angle or angle-closure glaucoma) is a medical emergency, and requires immediate diagnosis and treatment to prevent permanent visual impairment. The anterior and posterior chambers of the eye are filled with aqueous humor, which flows from the posterior chamber, through the pupil, into the anterior chamber, into the trabecular network, and then exits the eye the canal of Schlemm. Individuals with a shallow or narrow anterior chamber or thickened lens may be predisposed to this type of glaucoma because their iris is in close opposition to the chamber angle and cornea (narrow angle). If the aqueous humor is produced at a greater rate than it can be drained, intraocular pressure rises. Any stimulus that causes pupillary dilation (e. g., anticholinergic medications, sympathomimetics, emotional upset, dim lighting) can precipitate an attack. The cornea may look hazy because of edema, but corneal laceration is produced by trauma. There is no history of trauma in this patient and the symptoms exhibited by this patient strongly suggest acute closed-angle glaucoma. Intraocular hypertension is a condition in which IOP is higher than normal (greater than 21 mm Hg), but there is no damage to the optic nerve or visual loss. About 90% of people with elevated IOP never develop glaucoma. There is no associated pain or visual symptoms associated with this. Known as the \"sneak thief of sight, \" open-angle glaucoma has no early warning signs or symptoms, and accounts for 90% of all glaucoma cases. It is a slow progressive condition, usually affecting both eyes, in which there is an increase in resistance to the outflow of aqueous humor. This resistance is associated with a normal rate of production of the fluid and normal anterior chamber angle. Elevated IOP is the most common finding and age-related changes in the trabecular region are the most likely explanation of this disease.",

The primary vitreous is both mesodermal and ectodermal in origin. The lens cells and the retinal cells contribute the ectodermal pa in the formation of primary vitreous. The mesodermal component of primary vitreous is contributed by hyaloid vascular system. Eventually the primary vitreous is restricted to the area of Cloquet's canal when mesodermal elements atrophy. The secondary vitreous is the chief contributor to formation of adult vitreous body and is derived completely from the neural ectoderm. The secondary vitreous is composed of fine dense undulating fibers which arise from the developing retina. The progressive growth of the secondary vitreous causes cessation of growth of the primary vitreous. The teiary vitreous develops into zonular fibres (suspensory ligament) during the fouh month of gestation. It is derived from the inner neural ectodermal layer of the developing ciliary body.

It is best tested by swinging flash light test. To perform this test, a bright flash light is shone to one pupil and constriction of that pupil is noted. Then the flashlight is quickly moved to the contralateral pupil and the response in that pupil is noted. This swinging to and fro of the flashlight is repeated several times while the pupillary response is observed. Normally, both pupils constrict equally and the pupil to whom light is transferred remains tightly constricted. In the presence of relative afferent pupillary defect in one eye, both the pupil will dilate when the flash light is moved from the normal to the abnormal eye. This is a paradoxical resposne. This is called Marcus Gunn pupil and is the earliest indicator of optic nerve disease even in the presence of a normal visual acuity. Relative afferent papillary defect (RAPD) or Marcus Gunn pupil is a reliable and objectve sign of unilateral or assymmetric disease or any lesion in afferent papillary pathway, i. e., retina, optic nerve, optic chiasma, optic tract or midbrain (pretectal nucleus).

However, sclera-keratitis (limbal vascular keratitis) is least common (1%)Q. Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus (HZO) Corneal Disease (Keratitis) It can result in significant vision loss and manifests in 5 basic clinical forms 1. Epithelial Keratitis It may be acute (develop in >50% cases) or chronic (-8% patients). Punctate epithelial keratitis is earliest finding and presents with multiple, fine, swollen, raised intraepithelial lesions located paracentrally or at the limbus which stain intensely with rose bengal but only mildly with fluorescein. These contain live virus and may resolve into elevated dendriform epithelial lesion referred to as pseudo dendrites. (Pseudodendritic keratitis) Pseudodendrites are typically smaller than dendrites, and lack terminal end bulb formations. They are transient and usually resolve within 2 weeks after the cutaneous eruption, and steroids have little to no effect. Chronic epithelial keratitis is characterized by coarse pleomorphic epithelial mucous plaques appearing 1 weeks to 1 year (usually 3-4 months) after the skin lesions. They are a/w diffuse anterior stromal haze and debridement of plaque is not a/w any damage to underlying epithelium. 2. Nummular (Anterior Stromal) Keratitis Is earliest finding of corneal stromal involvement & present during, 2^d week of disease in 25-40% of patients. - It is characterized by multiple, fine, granular, (usually) transitory infiltrates in anterior stroma in areas previously affected by either punctuate or pseudodendrites. 3. Dissiform (Deep stromal) Keratitis or Endothelitis Develop 3-4 months after initial acute phase & is usually preceeded by acute epithelial or anterior stromal keratitis.

        "question": "In retinitis pigmentosa, \"night-blindness\" is an early symptom of visual loss. Which of the following explains this phenomenon?",
        "exp": "Retinitis pigmentosa is a familial degenerative disease of the retina that most often has recessive genetics. The initial problem appears to be alterations in the pigmented epithelium below the retina, paicularly in the most anterior poions of the retina. The pigmented epithelial cells become disrupted and leak pigment, which accumulates along the attenuated blood vessels (and can be seen with an ophthalmoscope). A consequence of this damage is that the rod cells that are normally nutritionally suppoed and \"groomed\" by the pigment epithelium also undergo degenerative changes. Since the cones are relatively preserved, day vision is preserved, but night vision, which is highly dependent on rods, begins to decay. With disease progression, vision is completely or nearly completely lost and the retina becomes so distoed that only a single row of cone nuclei with scattered stumpy cone remnants is all that remains of the photoreceptor layer.

Irregular astigmatism can be corrected. No peripheral distoration as it moves with eye and there is normal field of vision. Not subjected to moistening. Several varieties of contact lens can aid in treatment of dry eye. Hard contact lens may stimulate reflex tearing and also prevent evaporation of tear. Cosmatically superior. Tinted contact lenses relieve photophobia in albinism. Disadvantages of contact lens Complications of contact lens wearing are:? Intolerance: - Some people find wearing contact lenses intolerable. Corneal complications: - Corneal abrasion, Corneal edema, Corneal vascularization, Microbial keratitis (Pseudomonas, acanthamoeba), Sterile corneal infiltrate. Giant papillary conjunctivitis. Hypoxia: - Cornea is deprived of oxygen from the tear film by the presence of the contact lens. The cornea becomes edematous and new vessels may develop in the timbal area. Sensitivity: - This may develop in response to the preservative (thiomersal) in the cleaning and soaking solution. This results in allergic conjunctivitis.",

        "exp": "Ans. D: Dry eye Schirmer test producing wetting of less than 6 mm suppo the diagnosis of dry eye Schirmer's test It determines whether the eye produces enough tears to keep it moist. This test is used when a person experiences very dry eyes or excessive watering of the eyes. It poses no risk to the subject. A negative (more than 10 mm of moisture on the filter paper in 5 minutes) test result is normal. Both eyes normally secrete the same amount of tears. It is named for Otto Schirmer Schirmer's test uses paper strips inseed into the eye for several minutes to measure the production of tears. Both eyes are tested at the same time. Most often, this test consists of placing a small strip of filter paper inside the lower eyelid (conjunctival sac). The eyes are closed for 5 minutes. The paper is then removed and the amount of moisture is measured. Sometimes a topical anesthetic is placed into the eye before the filter paper to prevent tearing due to the irritation from the paper. The use of the anesthetic ensures that only basal tear secretion is being measured. This technique measures basic tear function. A young person normally moistens 15 mm of each paper strip. Because hypolacrimation occurs with aging, 33% of normal elderly persons may wet only 10 mm in 5 minutes. Persons with Sj. Ogren's syndrome moisten less than 5 mm in 5 minutes. Newer and better tests of tear production and function are One test measures an iron-binding molecule called lactoferrin. The amount of this molecule appears to be closely related to tear production. Patients with low tear production and dry eyes have low levels of this molecule. This test may be especially valuable for patients with dry eyes since it can point to specific treatment strategies for dry eye. The tears may also be examined for their content of lysozyme, an enzyme normally found in tears. Another test involves fluorescein eye drops, which contain a dye that is placed in the eye. The dye should drain with the tears through the lacrimal duct into the nose within 2 minutes. If patients do not have enough tears to flush the dye into the nose, this time will be longer. Dry eyes can occur from conditions such as: Aging Dehydration Corneal ulcers and infections Eye infections (for example conjunctivitis) Vitamin A deficiency Sj. Ogren's syndrome Secondary tearing deficiency (associated with disorders such as - lymphoma, leukemia, GVHD (graft vs. host disease, after a transplant), and rheumatoid ahritis) As a temporary or permanent side effect of LASER vision correction surgery such as LASIK or PRK",

Damage to fibers carrying the conjugate signal from abducens interneurons to the contralateral medial rectus motoneurons results in a failure of adduction on attempted lateral gaze. For example, a patient with a left INO will have slowed or absent adducting movements of the left eye. Nystagmus is usually present in the abducted eye. Convergence is usually preserved unless the responsible lesion is high in the midbrain. A patient with bilateral injury to the medial longitudinal fasciculus will have bilateral INO. Multiple sclerosis is the most common cause, although tumor, stroke, trauma, or any brainstem process may be responsible. Ref: Hoon J. C. (2012). Chapter 28. Disorders of the Eye. In D. L. Longo, A.

        "exp": "Diabetic retinopathy Extensively discussed with 2 Ophthalmologists Central bleed implies bleed in macula. This is what is leading to reduced vision in the involved eye. Diabetic retinopathy is the obvious choice due to following reasons: Diabetic retinopathy Among the given options macular bleed can be seen in DR only. Though DR is usually bilateral, but can be unilateral or assymetrical. Microaneurysms are the first ophthalmoscopically detectable change in diabetic retinopathy, seen as small red dots in the middle retinal layers. When these microaneurysms rupture it may give rise to an intraretinal haemorrhages. Optic neuritis Optic neuritis can be ruled out as - Vision loss is usually abrupt - Mild periorbital pain (exacerbated by eye movement) is present in about 90% cases. - Usually seen in young patients - Fundus picture is not matching. Retinal haemorrhages are uncommon. Macular bleed is never seen. Fundus examination is normal in retrobulabar type of optic neuritis (which is the much more common type of optic neuritis). In the less common papillitis type of optic neuritis, optic disc swelling is present. Funduscopic features of optic disc swelling include elevation of the optic nerve head, disk hyperemia, blurring of the disc margins, and edema of the nerve fibre layer. Optic disc hemorrhages are uncommon. Retinal tear Retinal tear are usually peripheral and typically occur in the equatorial and ora serrata regions of the retina. Peripheral retinal breaks alone do not cause loss of vision, but the associated conditions of vitreous hemorrhage and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment can result in severe visual loss. Even if retinal tear is central, will not cause macular bleed. Retinal tear can be of 2 types: traumatic and non-traumatic. Non traumatic can occur because of lattice degeneration or due to vitreous traction. Vitreous traction will lead to symptoms of flashes and associated haemorrhages would cause floaters. Hypeensive retinopathy Hypeensive retinopathy can be of 2 types- Chronic hypeensive retinopathty and Malignant acute hypeensive retinopathy. Chronic hypeensive retinopathy is usually asymptomatic. Fundus picture is - focal constriction and dilatation of the retinal aerioles, touosity of the retinal aerioles, an increase in the aeriolar light reflex, and loss of transparency of the intra-aerial blood column, aeriovenous nicking (aeriovenous nicking is a highly specific. finding and the hallmark of chronic hypeensive retinopathy), retinal hemorrhages, macular edema, and cotton-wool spots. Malignant hypeensive retinopathy is due to acutely elevated blood pressure in a patient with relatively young aerioles undefended by sclerosis. Vision loss is acute and severe. The fundus picture is dominated by edema. The entire retina may be clouded by a generalized edema which may be paicularly accentuated at the disc, resulting in a marked degree of disc edema with multiple cotton wool patches, hard exudates and retinal haemorrhages. Diabetic retinopathy and age: Diabetic retinopathy affects both young and old, as it is the diabetic age and not the chronological age that is impoant. The best predictor of diabetic retinopathy is the duration of the disease. First 5 yrs of type 1 diabetes - very low risk 5-10 yrs of type 1 diahete - 27% develop diabetic retinopathy > 10 yrs - 71 to 90 % develop diabetic retinopathy > 20-30 yrs - 95% develop DR.

The most common conditions associated with the development of exposure keratitis include Bell's palsy, exophthalmos associated with Grave's disease, and ectropion. If the eye is not properly covered by the eyelids or blinking is ineffective or absent (as in Bell's palsy), the cornea may dry out resulting in exposure keratitis. This condition is characterized by pain or discomfo, blurred vision, and even permanent loss of vision in some cases due to corneal ulceration or the more dreaded perforation of the cornea. Exposure keratitis is treated based on the underlying condition. Prevention of the condition is the best management. In the cases of Bell's palsy and ectropion, a minor plastics procedure may decrease or eliminate the exposure of the eye. If exophthalmos associated with Grave's disease is the underlying cause, an orbital decompression procedure may be appropriate. Immediate management of patients with exposure keratitis is based on lubrication with aificial tears or ointments and reduction of the exposure, either with shields or patching of the affected eye",

Fungal corneal ulcers require intensive application of topical anti-fungal agents. Viral corneal ulceration caused by herpes virus may respond to antivirals like topical acyclovir ointment instilled at least five times a day. Alongside, suppoive therapy like pain medications are given, including topical cycloplegics like atropine or homatropine to dilate the pupil and thereby stop spasms of the ciliary muscle. All forced expiration like blowing the nose, coughing etc. must be avoided. Proper nutrition, including protein intake and Vitamin C are usually advised. In cases of Keratomalacia, where the corneal ulceration is due to a deficiency of Vitamin A, supplementation of the Vitamin A by oral or intramuscular route is given. Drugs that are usually contraindicated in corneal ulcer are topical coicosteroids and anesthetics - these should not be used on any type of corneal ulcer because they prevent healing, may lead to superinfection with fungi and other bacteria Fuher option is the use of a tissue adhesive such as N-butyl 2-ethyl cyanoacrylate monomer which is applied to the area of perforation after careful debridement. Drying of the adhesive may take few minutes after which anterior chamber may reform. Following this, a continuous-wear soft contact lens can be applied or a definite surgical procedure such as therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty or conjunctival flap undeaken. Superficial ulcers may heal in less than a week.",

Such factors are dim light (watching a film in a cinema), and mydriatic drugs (atropine, tropicamide, cyclopentolate, phenylephrine). Dilatation of the pupil increases the amount of apposition between iris and anteriorly placed lens with a considerable pressure resulting in relative papillary block. Consequently the aqueous collects in the posterior chamber and pushes the peripheral flaccid iris anteriorly (Iris bombe), resulting in appositional angle closure due to iridocorneal contact. Eventually there occurs a rise in IOP which is transient to begin with but slowly the appositional angle closure is converted to synechial angle closure due to formation of peripheral anterior synechiae (Goniosynechiae). To counteract this, miotic (mainly pilocarpine) is used in the treatment to constrict pupil and pull the iris away from the angle.",

Epithelial and subepithelial corneal dystrophies may present with bouts of recurrent corneal erosions Bowman layer corneal dystrophy usually presents with recurrent corneal erosions. Recurrent corneal erosion. It is characterized by the failure of the cornea's outermost layer of epithelial cells to attach to the underlying basement membrane (Bowman's layer). The condition is excruciatingly painful because the loss of these cells results in the exposure of sensitive corneal nerves. There is often a history of previous corneal injury (corneal abrasion or ulcer), but also may be due to corneal dystrophy or corneal disease. In other words, one may suffer from corneal erosions as a result of another disorder, such as map dot fingerprint disease. Presentation. Symptom include recurring attacks of severe acute ocular pain, foreign-body sensation, photophobia (i. e. sensitivity to bright lights), and tearing often at the time of awakening or during sleep when the eyelids are rubbed or opened. Signs of the condition include corneal abrasion or localized roughening of the corneal epithelium, sometimes with map-like lines, epithelial dots or microcyts, or fingerprint patterns. Investigation. The erosion may be seen by using the magnification of an ophthalmoscope, although usually fluorescein stain must be applied first and a blue-light used. Use of slit lamp microscopes allow for more thorough evaluation under the higher magnification. Management. With the eye generally profusely watering, the type of tears being produced have little adhesive propey. Water or saline eye drops tend therefore to be ineffective. Rather a 'better quality' of tear is required with higher 'wetting ability' (i. e. greater amount of glycoproteins) and so aificial tears (e. g. viscotears) are applied frequently. Where episodes frequently occur, or there is an underlying disorder, one medical, or three types of surgical curative procedures may be attempted: Use of therapeutic contact lens, controlled puncturing of the surface layer of the eye (Anterior Stromal Puncture) and laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK). These all essentially try to allow the surface epithelium to reestablish with normal binding to the underlying basement membrane. Medical. Patients with recalcitrant recurrent corneal erosions often show increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes. These enzymes dissolve the basement membrane and fibrils of the hemidesmosomes, which can lead to the separation of the epithelial layer. Treatment with oral tetracycline antibiotics (such as doxycycline or oxytetracycline) together with a topical coicosteroid (such as prednisolone), reduce MMP activity and may rapidly resolve and prevent fuher episodes in cases unresponsive to conventional therapies.",

The fly picks up microfilariae from the skin of the infected person, where it matures into larvae that become adult worms in 1 year. The adult parasite produces cutaneous nodules which are 5-25 mm in diameter on the trunk, thighs, arms, head, and shoulders. In the eye it causes nummular keratitis and sclerosing keratitis. Death of the microfilariae causes an intense inflammatory reaction and severe uveitis, vitritis, and retinitis. It is diagnosed by skin biopsy and microscopic examination looking for live microfilariae. The preferred treatment for onchocerciasis is with nodulectomy and ivermectin. Ref: Cunningham, Jr. E.

        "question": "Characteristic feature of diabetic retinopathy: September 2005, 2010 March 2007",
        "exp": "Ans. D: Microaneurysm Diabetic retinopathy is an ocular manifestation of systemic disease which affects up to 80% of all patients who have had diabetes for 10 years or more. Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. As new blood vessels form at the back of the eye as a pa of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, they can bleed (hemorrhage) and blur vision. On fundoscopic exam, one can see cotton-wool spots, flame hemorrhages, and dot-blot hemorrhages. Diabetic retinopathy is the result of microvascular retinal changes. Hyperglycemia-induced pericyte death and thickening of the basement membrane lead to incompetence of the vascular walls. The initial loss of pericytes leads to the formation of the dilatations of the vessels seen as microaneurysms and breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier making the retinal blood vessels more permeable. Small blood vessels in the eye are especially vulnerable to poor blood sugar control. An over accumulation of glucose and/or fructose damages the tiny blood vessels in the retina. During the initial stage, called nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), most people do not notice any change in their vision. Some people develop macular edema. It occurs when the damaged blood vessels leak fluid and lipids onto the macula, the pa of the retina that lets us see detail. The fluid makes the macula swell, which blurs vision. As the disease progresses, severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy enters an advanced, or proliferative, stage. The lack of oxygen in the retina causes fragile, new, blood vessels to grow along the retina and in the clear, gel-like vitreous humour that fills the inside of the eye. Without timely treatment, these new blood vessels can bleed, cloud vision, and destroy the retina. Fibrovascular proliferation can also cause tractional retinal detachment. The new blood vessels can also grow into the angle of the anterior chamber of the eye and cause neovascular glaucoma. Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy shows up as cotton wool spots, or microvascular abnormalities or as superficial retinal hemorrhages. Diabetic retinopathy is detected during an eye examination that includes: Visual acuity test: Ophthalmoscopy: Note that hand-held ophthalmoscopy is insufficient to rule out significant and treatable diabetic retinopathy. Ocular Coherence Tomography or OCT: This is a scan similar to an ultrasound which is used to measure the thickness of the retina. Digital Retinal Screening Programs: This involves digital image capture and transmission of the images to a digital reading center for evaluation and treatment referral. Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy Retinal Screening Programs: Systematic programs for the early detection of diabetic retinopathy using slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Early signs of the disease (over retina): Leaking blood vessels, Retinal swelling, such as macular edema, Pale, fatty deposits on the retina (exudates) - signs of leaking blood vessels, Damaged nerve tissue (neuropathy), and Any changes in the blood vessels. Panretinal photocoagulation, or PRP (also called scatter laser treatment), is used to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Rather than focus the light on a single spot, hundreds of small laser burns are made away from the center of the retina, a procedure called scatter laser treatment or panretinal photocoagulation. The treatment shrinks the abnormal blood vessels.",

In the question light reflex is normal, thus optic neuritis and retinal detachment can be ruled out. Now we are left with hysteria and cortical blindness. This can be differentiated by VER which is normal in hysteria and shows abnormality in cortical lesions. So, answer is cortical blindness. It is worth noting that VER will also be abnormal in retinal detachment and optic neuritis. However, they have been excluded on the basis of normal pupillary response. Here I am giving brief idea about VER. We know when light falls on retina, a series of nerve impulses are generated and passed on to the visual cortex via the visual pathway. The visual evoked response measures the electrical potential resulting from a visual stimulus. Because it is measured by scalp electrodes placed over the occipital cortex, the entire visual pathway from retina to cortex must be intact in order to produce a normal electrical waveform reading. Visual evoked response is the only clinically objective technique available to assess the functional state of the visual system beyond the retinal ganglion cells. Interruption of neuronal conduction by any lesion in this pathway will result in reduced amplitude of the VER. In the question extinguished visual response suggests any abnormality some where, in the visual conducting system. This abnormality in the VER can be easily attributed to cortical blindness because normal pupillary response and normal fundus rule out any chance of optic neuritis and retinal detachment.",

The corneal epithelium, Bowman's layer and stroma are destroyed. Etiology & Clinical features Pterygium is more common in people with excess outdoor exposure to sunlight (UV rays), dry heat, high wind and abundance of dust. Therefore it is more common in those who work outdoors. Clinically it presents as a triangular fold of conjunctiva encroaching the cornea in the area of palpebral apeure, usually on the nasal side. Other findings are stocker's line (deposition of iron) Ptergyium is an asymptomatic condition in the early stages, except for cosmetic intolerance.

        "question": "Definitive managenment in primary angle closure glaucoma: March 2005",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Laser iridotomy Although intraocular pressure is only one of the major risk factors for glaucoma, lowering it various pharmaceuticals and/or surgical techniques is currently the mainstay of glaucoma treatment. A. Medications used for lowering intraocular tension: Prostaglandin analogs like latanoprost, bimatoprost and travoprost increase uveoscleral outflow of aqueous humor. Bimatoprost also increases trabecular outflow Topical beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists such as timolol, levobunolol, and betaxolol decrease aqueous humor production by the ciliary body. Alpha2-adrenergic agonists such as brimonidine work by a dual mechanism, decreasing aqueous production and increasing uveo-scleral outflow. Less-selective sympathomimetics like epinephrine and dipivefrin increase outflow of aqueous humor through trabecular meshwork and possibly through uveoscleral outflow pathway, probably by a beta2-agonist action. Miotic agents parasympathomimetics like pilocarpine work by contraction of the ciliary muscle, tightening the trabecular meshwork and allowing increased outflow of the aqueous humour. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors like dorzolamide, brinzolamide, acetazolamide lower secretion of aqueous humor by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary body. B. Conventional surgery to treat glaucoma makes a new opening in the meshwork. This new opening helps fluid to leave the eye and lowers intraocular pressure. Canaloplasty is a nonpenetrating procedure utilizing microcatheter technology. By opening the canal, the pressure inside the eye may be relieved. Laser trabeculoplasty may be used to treat open angle glaucoma. It is a temporary solution, not a cure. Nd: YAG Laser peripheral iridotomy reduces the risk of developing an attack of acute angle closure. In most cases it also reduces the risk of developing chronic angle closure or of adhesions of the iris to the trabecular meshwork. It is mandatory after reducing the intraocular pressure in all eyes with any form of primary angle-closure glaucoma and also prophylactically in the unaffected eye. Diode laser cycloablation lowers IOP by reducing aqueous secretion by destroying secretory ciliary epithelium. Trabeculectomv allows fluid to flow out of the eye through this opening, resulting in lowered intraocular pressure.",

These two diseases account for about two-thirds of all NVG cases. The predisposing condition for diabetic retinopathy obviously is diabetes. With respect to CRVO, predisposing conditions include elevated intraocular pressure and systemic hypertension (high blood pressure). The remaining one-third of NVG cases has less-common causes. Among these are: Central retinal aery occlusion (CRAO) Carotid aery obstructive disease Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (a tear in the retina with fluid accumulating underneath that can fuher separate the pigment layer from other layers). Choroidal melanoma beneath a retinal detachment.

In early stages it is characterised by large areas of intra and subretinal yellowish exudates and haemorrhages associated with overlying dilated and touous retinal blood vessels and a number of small aneurysms near the posterior pole and around the disc. It may present with visual loss, strabismus or leukocoria (whitish pupillary reflex) and thus needs to be differentiated from retinoblastoma. The condition usually progresses to produce exudative retinal detachment and a retrolental mass. In late stages complicated cataract, uveitis and secondary glaucoma occur, which eventually end in phthisis bulbi. Treatment Photocoagulation or cryotherapy may check progression of the disease if applied in the early stage. However, once the retina is detached the treatment becomes increasingly difficult and success rate declines to 33 percent.",

Lens capsule A transparent membrane surrounding the lens like a pocket. It is thicker over the anterior surface than the posterior surface. It is thickest at pre- equator region and thinnest at the posterior pole. When an aificial lens replaces the natural lens in cataract surgery (IOL implantation), it is placed in this same capsule. 2. Lens epithelium It is a single layer on the anterior (front) surface of the lens. There is no epithelium on posterior surface. The epithelial cells distribute fluid, ion and glucose through the entire lens. They also create new fibers throughout a person's life. 3. Lens fibres These are long protein fibers that arc closely packed and parallel. They make up most of the lens volume and are laid horizontally, front to back, and concentrically like layers of an onion. As the lens fibres are formed throughout the life, these are arranged compactly as nucleus and coex of the lens. a) Nucleus: - It is the central pa containing the oldest fibres. it consists of different zones:- Embryonic nucleus:- Formed at 1-3 months of gestation, therefore consists the oldest primary fibres. Fetal nucleus: - Lies around the embryonic nucleus and is formed from 3 months of gestation till bih. Infantile nucleus:- Corresponding the lens from bih to pubey and surrounds the fetal nucleus. Adults:- Corresponds to the lens fibres formed after pubey to rest of the life. Coex:- It is the peripheral pa containg the youngest fibres. The ciliary zonules (Zonules of zinn or suspensory ligaments of lens) hold the lens in position and enable the ciliary muscle to act on it. These consist essentially of a series of fibres which run from the ciliary body and fuse into the outer layer of the lens capsule around the equatorial zone.",

Autosomal recessive is the most common and is very severe. Autosomal dominant is benign and is symptomatic only in adult life. X-linked recessive is least common. It is also a very severe form. Degeneration of rods commences near the equator. Macular region is not affected until late in the disease. The symptoms of retinitis pigmentosa are characteristic, the most prominent being defective vision in the dusk (night blindness/nyctalopia). It is due to degeneration of rods, which are primarily responsible for vision in low illumination. The visual field show concentric reduction. In early cases a paial or complete annular/ring scotoma is found. As the disease progresses the field becomes gradually smaller until at last it is reduced to a restricted area around the fixation point (tubular vision). Hence person has difficulty in moving about. Initially the equatorial region is affected. Ophthalmoscopic findings in the affected zones shows the retina studded with small, jet black spots resembling bone corpuscles with a spidery outline. The retinal pigment epithelium becomes transparent so that the choroid vessels become visible and the fundus appears tessellated or tigroid. The retinal veins, never the aeries, often have a sheath of pigment for pa of their course. The retinal vessels becomes extremely attenuated and thread like. The disc exhibits the characteristics of primary optic atrophy. It is pale and have a wax like yellowish appearance and is often termed as 'consecutive optic atrophy' (Ganglion cells destroyed with degeneration of the axial cylinders and optic nerve is known as consecutive atrophy). Ocular associations of retinitis pigmentosa are myopia, chronic simple glaucoma. Systemic associations of retinitis pigmentosa are in the form of various syndromes: Laurence - Moon - Biedl syndrome - obesity, hypogonadism, polydactyly and mental retardation. Usher's syndrome - deaf mutism. Secondary retinitis pigmentosa due to infections like syphilis, mumps, German measles (rubella) and due to drug like chloroquine must be differentiated from primary retinitis pigmentosa.

It can be done in disease involving all or few layers of cornea eg keratoconus, pseudophakic bullous keratopathy, Fuchs endothelial & other dystrophies. An ideal graft size is 7. 5 mm; grafts smaller than this may 1/t high astigmatism. Grafts 8. 5 mm are prone to postoperative anterior synechiae formation, vascularization and increased intraocular pressure. - PKP has long been the gold standard for treatment of endothelial dysfunction. The limitations of PK include However, because of recent advances & lack of these limitations, endothelial keratoplasty is rapidly gaining popularity. It takes 6 months to many years for the refraction to stabilize 10-15% of patients typically require a hard contact lens for best vision and final mean refractive cylinder of 45D is common PKP incision cuts all corneal nerves, so the inclination to blink and produce tears is reduced postoperatively. This, together with prolonged presence of corneal sutures, increases the risk that ocular surface complications will interfere with recovery. PKP wound never heals back to the full strength of a virgin cornea, so a PKP eye is forever at increased risk of loss from a traumatic injury. Paial Thickness /Lamellar Keratoplasty (LKP) - It is a procedure in which a paial thickess graft of donor tissue is used to provide tectonic stability and /or optical improvement. - It may be of 2 types: anterior LKP and posterior LKP. - In anterior LKP, the transplanted tissue does not include corneal endothelium. This procedure avoids endothelial rejection and thus donor tissue may be obtained from older eyes. Indications for anterior LKP mainly include anterior corneal pathology in which the posterior cornea is unaffected - In deep LKP and posterior LKP, the diseased corneal endothelium is replaced while keeping the anterior corneal surface intact. - Because the donor endothelium is not used, the criteria for anterior LKP are less stringent than those used in PKP; the tissue does not need to be as fresh as that used in PKP. Corneal stroma may be used upto 7 days postmoem (whereas, Posterior LKP has same criteria as PKP). Endothelial Keratoplasty (EK) i. e. posterior lamellar keratoplasty/ Descemet's Stripping endothelial Keratoplasty involves selective removal of dysfunctional recipient corneal endothelium and replacement with donor tissue consisting of posterior stroma and healthy endothelium. EK is performed through a small incision and spares the majority of host cornea so corneal strength and surface topography are minimally altered & technique is essentially refractive neutral. Fuhermore, corneal innervaton is retained and corneal sutures are not required. So corneal surface complications are minimal. The small incison allows rapid healing and rapid visual recovery after surgery. While fewer patients may achieve 20/20 vision after EK compared with PKP, overall the visual results are more predectible. - DSEK increases corneal thickness because posterior donor stroma is implanted without removal of any recipient stoma. In general, younger patients are likely to achieve better visual acuity after DSEK than older patients (even when have no retinal problems). Whereas PKP was often post phoned until after retirement or at least until visual problems were quite disturbing, EK is now being performed earlier, when visual problems begin to interfere with daily activities, such as reading or driving Infact, it is preferable to perform EK before long standing corneal edema 1/ anterior stromal scarring, because the anterior stroma is not replaced in EK.",

The reduced schematic eye treats the eye as if it were a single refracting element consisting of an ideal spherical surface separating two media of refractive indices of 1. 00 (air in external environment) and 1. 33 (eye as a whole). So, in reduced eye, the entire system (of eye) can be regarded as one lens with one optical centre which lies in the posterior pa of crystalline lens. The diopteric power of reduced eye is + 60D, of which + 44D is contributed by cornea and + 16D by the crystalline lens. Reduced eye concept was introduced by Listing, therefore, it is also referred to as Listing's reduced eye.",
