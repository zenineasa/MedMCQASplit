Khurana 6th ed. /381* Fasanella-servat operation or Tarso-conjunctivo- mullerectomy is the surgery of choice for ptosis due to Horner syndrome: as the ptosis in Horner syndrome is mild (2mm) and is due to Muller's muscle dysfunction (sympathetic supply)* Sling surgery is done in severe ptosis with poor Levator action. Here the ptosis is mild so sling is not advised* Levator resection upto 15 mm strengthens levator muscle and is done to correct mild degree of ptosis. If fasanella Servat operation is not provided, that it is the best correct option.",
