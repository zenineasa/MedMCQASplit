Schlote, Pocket Atlas of Ophthalmology, p. 153).# Primary open-angle glaucoma is also known as chronic open-angle glaucoma, chronic simple glaucoma, glaucoma simplex. Not all people with POAG have elevated IOP, but decreasing the eye pressure further has been shown to stop progression. The increased IOP is caused by trabecular blockage. Because the microscopic passages are blocked, the pressure builds up in the eye and causes imperceptible very gradual vision loss. Peripheral vision is affected first, but eventually the entire vision will be lost if not treated.# Diagnosis is made by looking for cupping of the optic nerve.# Rx: Pg agonists open uveoscleral passageways. Beta blockers (timolol) decrease aqueous formation. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease bicarbonate formation from ciliary processes, thus decreasing Aqueous humor formation. Parasympathetic analogs act on the trabecular outflow by opening up the passages and constricting the pupil. Alpha 2 agonists (brimonidine, apraclonidine) decrease fluid production (via. inhibition of AC) and increase drainage.High yield flow chart for Rx of Angle closure glaucoma:Glaucoma Classification (The European Glaucoma Society)Main typesSubtypesPrimary congenital glaucoma/ dysgenetic glaucomaIs due to primary trabecular meshwork dysgenesisPrimary open-angle glaucoma# Primary open-angle glaucoma with high pressur simple glaucoma# Primary open-angle glaucoma without high pressure/normal-pressure glaucoma# Primary juvenile glaucoma# Ocular hypertensionSecondary open-angle glaucoma# Secondary open-angle glaucoma as a result of ocular diseases# Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma# Pigment dispersion glaucoma# Lens-induced secondary open-angle glaucoma (phacolytic glaucoma, lens particle glaucoma, phacoanaphylactic glaucoma)# Glaucoma with intraocular hemorrhage (glaucoma with hyphema, hemolytic glaucoma, ghost cell glaucoma)# Glaucoma with intraocular inflammation# Glaucoma with intraocular tumors# Glaucoma with retinal detachment# Traumatic glaucoma# Iatrogenic secondary open-angle glaucoma contd # Steroid glaucoma# Glaucoma following intraocular surgery and laser therapy# Secondary open-angle glaucoma as a result of extraocular diseases# Glaucoma with raised episcleral venous pressurePrimary angle-closure glaucomaSecondary angle-closure glaucoma# Primary narrow-angle glaucoma# Secondary angle-closure glaucoma with pupillary block# Secondary angle-closure glaucoma without pupillary block with anterior pulling mechanism# Secondary angle-closure glaucoma without pupillary block with posterior pushing mechanismVariants of primary glaucoma# Pigmentary glaucoma# Exfoliation glaucomafpseudoexfoliative glaucoma or glaucoma capsulare)",

It acts by producing a thermal energy at the point of application which will produce micro scars. As the micro scars contract, surrounding un-lasered tissue is stretched there by allowing for better drainage. Repopulation of the trabecular meshwork by stimulation of the cellular division is another possible mechanism. New formed cells are more efficient at allowing drainage. In the given options, Pseudoexfoliation syndrome and Uveitic glaucoma are secondary open angle glaucoma. Uveitic glaucoma patients require control of the uveitis and usually medical treatment of glaucoma. Surgical intervention including laser treatment can worsen the uveitic component of the disease. Pseudo exfoliation syndrome (PES) is characterized by deposition of an amorphous grey dandruff-like material on the pupillary border, anterior lens surface, posterior surface of iris, zonules and ciliary processes. Secondary open-angle glaucoma is associated in about 50% of the cases. Exact mechanism of rise of IOP is also not clear. Trabecular blockage by the exfoliative material is considered as the probable cause. Clinically, the glaucoma behaves like POAG and is managed by Laser Trabeculoplasty (Increases Trabecular Outflow) Laser trabeculoplasty causes damage, inflammation and scarring of trabecular mesh work causing opening up of trabecular spaces.

Pathogenesis: The common feature of the ICE syndromes is the presence of abnormal corneal endothelial cells which proliferate to form an endothelial membrane in the angle of anterior chamber. Glaucoma is caused by secondary synechial angle-closure as a result of contraction of this endothelial membrane. Clinical features: The ICE syndromes typically affect middle-aged women. The raised IOP is associated with characteristic features of the causative condition. \u0001 1) In 'progressive iris atrophy', iris features predominate with marked corectopia, atrophy and hole formation. 2)\u0001 While in Chandler's syndrome, changes in iris are mild to absent and the corneal oedema even at normal IOP predominates. 3)\u0001 Hallmark of Cogan-Reese syndrome is nodular or diffuse pigmented lesions of the iris (therefore also called as iris naevus syndrome) which may or may not be associated with corneal changes. Treatment: Medical treatment is often ineffective. \u0001 Trabeculectomy operation usually fails, \u0001 Aificial filteration shunt may control the IOP. Ref:- A K KHURANA; pg num:-237",

In older age groups increases in mean IOP with age is greater in female.4. **Diurnal variations of IOP - Usually there is tendancy of higher IOP in the morning and lower in the evening. This has been related to diurnal variation in the level of plasma cortisol5. **Postural variations - IOP increases when changing from the sitting to the supine positions6.

The dynamic contour tonometer represents a potentially new technology for non-invasive and direct intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement, and has been proposed to accurately measure the true IOP irrespective of the corneal thickness. The Perkins tonometer is a type of poable applanation tonometer, which may be useful in children, anesthetised patients who need to lie flat, or patients unable to co-operate with a sitting slit lampexamination, that yields clinical results comparable to the Goldmann. Rebound tonometers determine intraocular pressure by bouncing a small plastic tipped metal probe against the cornea. The device uses an induction coil to magnetise the probe and fire it against the cornea. As the probe bounces against the cornea and back into the device, it creates an induction current from which the intraocular pressure is calculated. The device is simple and easy to use and self-use versions are available. It is poable, does not require the use of eye drops and is paicularly suitable for children and non-cooperative patients. The image above shows rebound tonometer. Diaton tonometer is a handheld device measuring IOP through the eyelid and over the sclera with no contact to the cornea & causing no discomfo to the patient.The pen-like tonometer diaton measures IOP within seconds without the need for anesthesia or sterilization.",
