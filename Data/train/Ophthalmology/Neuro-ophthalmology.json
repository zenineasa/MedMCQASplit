Optic vesicles are outgrowings of the brain (Neuroectoderm) which make contact with the surface ectoderm and this contact induces changes necessary for further development of the eye. Through a groove at the bottom of the optic vesicle known as choroid fissure the blood vessels enter the eye.o Eye morphogenesis begins with the evagination, or outgrowth, of the optic grooves or sulci. These two grooves in the neural folds transform into optic vesicles with the closure of the neural tube.The optic vesicles then develop into the optic cup with the inner layer forming the retina and the outer portion forming the retinal pigment epithelium. The middle portion of the optic cup develops into the ciliary body and iris.During the invagination of the optic cup, the ectoderm begins to thicken and form the lens placode, which eventually separates from the ectoderm to form the lens vesicle at the open end of the optic cup.",

It is formed from Arginine.Arginine is converted to ornithine then to glutamate-y-semialdehyde by OAT.Deficiency of OAT leads to hyperomithemia causing gyrate atrophy.Patients develop nyctalopia during the second to third decade of life. Visual acuity is preserved until later stages. Treatment:Since ornithine is produced from other amino acids, mainly arginine a low protein diet, including near total elimination of arginine with supplementation of essential amino acids has been found to be beneficial in gyrate atrophy.Gene for the enzyme OAT has been mapped to chromosome 10q26.Replacement of the abnormal gene, or genetic engineering to produce a supply of normal enzyme, may result in a reduction of ornithine levels without dietary restrictions.",
