        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Meibomian gland Chalaziono Chalazion is chronic non-infective (non-suppurative) lipogranulomatous inflammation of sebaceous glands called meibomian glands.o It results from obstruction of a meibomian gland duct.3 Extravasated lipid material produces a surrounding chronic lipogranulomatous inflammation.o Obstruction is induced by low grade infection that causes proliferation of meibomian gland duct epithelium and infiltration of the wall of ducts.o Patients present with painless, non-tender swelling of the lid. Signs of acute inflammation are not present.o Swelling is slightly away from lid margin.o Occasionally, it may present on the intermarginal strip, i.e. marginal chalazion.o Often chalazion slowly increases in size to become very large and causes blurred vision from induced astigmatism (due to compression on cornea) or eversion of the punctum. Rarely, complete resolution may occur.o Recurrence may occur in seborrhoeic dermatitis, acne rosacea and malignant change.o Secondary malignancy caused by chalagion is Meibomian gland adenocarcinoma (sebaceous cell carcinoma). Secondary infection may cause hordeolum internum.o Acute infection of Zeis (Moll) gland - Stye (Hardoleum externum).o Acute infection of tarsal gland (Meibomian gland) - Hardoleum internumo Chronic infection of tarsal gland (Meibonium gland) - ChalazionDifferences between stye (Hordeolum externum), chalazion and Hordeolum internum Stye (Hordeolum externum)ChalazionHordeolum internumOnsetAcuteChronicAcuteGlandZeis's glandMeibomian glandMeibomian glandTypes of inflammationSuppurativeL ipogranul omatousSuppurativeSymptomsAcute pain and swellingPainless disfigurementSevere painSignsLocalized, hard and tender swelling near the lid marginHard nontender swelling away from lid marginYellow' point seen on everting the lidTreatmentHot fomentation.
