It is the commonest variety and involves only the lower lids. It occurs due to senile laxity of the tissues of the lids and loss of tone of the orbicularis muscle, o Cicatricial ectropion. It occurs due to scarring of the skin and can involve both the lids. Common causes of skin scarring are: thermal burns, chemical bums, lacerating injuries and skin ulcers, o Paralytic ectropion. It results due to paralysis of the seventh nerve. It mainly occurs in the lower lids. Common causes of facial nerve patsy are: Bell's palsy, head injury and infections of the middle ear. o Mechanical ectropion. It occurs in conditions where either the lower lid is pulled down (as in tumours) or pushed out and down (as in proptosis and marked chemosis of the conjunctiva), o Spastic ectropion. It is a rare entity, seen in children and young adults following spasm of the orbicularis, where lids are well supported by the globe.",

BLEPHARITISo It is a subacute or chronic inflammation of the lid margins. It is an extremely common disease which can be divided into following clinical types: o Seborrhoeic or squamous blepharitis, o Staphylococcal or ulcerative blepharitis, o Mixed staphylococcal with seborrhoeicblepharitis, o Posterior blepharitis or meibomitis, ando Parasitic blepharitis. Seborrhoeic or squamous blepharitis. Etiology. It is usually associated with seborrhoea of scalp (dandruff). In it, glands of Zeis secrete abnormal excessive neutral lipids which are split by Corynebacterium acne into irritating free fatty acids. Symptoms. Patients usually complain of deposition of whitish material at the lid margin associated with mild discomfort, irritation, occasional watering and a history of falling of eyelashes. Signs. Accumulation of white dandruff-like scales are seen on the lid margin, among the lashes. On removing these scales underlying surface is found to be hyperaemic (no ulcers). The lashes fall out easily but are usually replaced quickly without distortion. In long-standing cases lid margin is thickened and the sharp posterior border tends to be rounded leading to epiphora. Treatment. General measures include improvement of health and balanced diet. Associated seborrhoea of the scalp should be adequately treated. Local measures include removal of scales from the lid margin with the help of lukewarm solution of 3 percent soda bicarb or baby shampoo and frequent application of combined antibiotic and steroid eye ointment at the lid margin.",
