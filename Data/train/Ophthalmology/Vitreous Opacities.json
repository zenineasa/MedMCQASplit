        "exp": "Ans. a. Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (Ref: style=\"font-size: 1. 04761904761905em; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif\">). Causes of Calcification of the Globe. Retinal: Drusen. Retinoblastoma. Retinocytoma. Tuberous sclerosis (TS). Epiretinal membranes. Retrolental fibroplasia (retinopathy of prematurity). Coats disease. Retinochoroidal. Chorioretinitis: most commonly following Toxoplasmosis. Choroidal. Choroidal osteoma(s): more common in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Choroidal angioma(s): occasionally calcify. Sclerochoroidal: Metastatic calcification: hyperparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, renal tubular acidosis. Dystrophic calcification: Phthisis bulbi. Persistent Primary Hyperplastic Vitreous Persistent Fetal Vasculature Syndrome (PFV). Uncommon congenital ocular anomaly in which the hyaloid vasculature system and primary vitreous fail to involute or regress. Usually unilateral. Associations of Bilateral PHPVTrisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). Norries diseases. Walker Warberg syndrome. Clinical Presentation: Typically presents with unilateral leucokoria. Typically associated with mild microphtalmos. Abnormality may be confined to anterior segment or posterior segment. Persistent Primary Hyperplastic Vitreous. Anterior PHPVPosterior PHPV* Abnormality is confined to anterior segment* Often involves the lens* Typical Presentation:- Unilateral leucokoria* Signs and complications:- Retroiental mass into which elongated ciliary processes are inserted- Cataract- Shallow anterior chamber and angle closure glaucoma- Recurrent intraocular hemorrhage- Microphthalmia* Treatment:- Vitreoretinal surgery in selected early cases to salvage vision- Abnormality is confined to posterior segment- Lens is usually clear- Typical Presentation:- Unilateral leucokoria, strabismus and nystagmus- Signs and complications:- Adense white membrane or a prominent retinal fold extension from the optic disc to ora serrate- Pre-retinal membrane- Tractional retinal folds and tractional retinal detachment- Retinal dysplasia and optic nerve hypoplasia- Microphthalmia* Treatment:- Not possible",
