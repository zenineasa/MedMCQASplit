However posterior subcapsular cataract make it difficult for light rays to pass Nuclear cataract or nuclear sclerosis causes index myopia and thus difficulty in far vision like driving a car but it improves near vision - hence the 2nd vision phenomenon. In the question, vision for near is expected for reading a newspaper which would be good in a patient with nuclear cataract Coical cataract cause problem in night vision as pupil dilate at night exposing the cataractous lens and rays of light are not able to pass through peripheral pa of lens. Coronary cataract is an extremely common form of developmental cataract occurring about pubey; thus involving either the adolescent nucleus or deeper layer of the coex. Since, the opacities are situated peripherally, vision is usually unaffected. Sometimes the associated large punctace opacities may marginally reduce the vision.",
