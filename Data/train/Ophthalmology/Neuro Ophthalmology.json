If a homonymous hemianopia is due to a lesion in the parietal lobe, smooth pursuit pathways towards the side of the lesion are likely to be affected, making this component of OKN defective. OKN will therefore be asymmetrical: erratic when the drum is rotated towards the side of the lesion, but regular when the drum is rotated away from the side of the lesion.

Make your concept - Homonymous means same side (i. e. right or left) - Heteronymous means opposite side (i. e. nasal or temporal) - Congruous means same shape or symmetric on both sides - Incongruous means different shape or asymmetric on both sides - Hemianopia means half side is involved - Generally Anterior lesions cause heteronymous, incongruous defects and posterior lesions cause more homonymous and congruous defects Impoant Points on Visual Pathway Lesions 1.
