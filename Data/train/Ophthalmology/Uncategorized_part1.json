        "exp": "The central aery of the retina is a branch of the ophthalmic aery. It is the sole blood supply to the retina; it has no significant collateral circulation and blockage of this vessel leads to blindness. The branches of this aery are what you view during a fundoscopic exam. Note: The infraorbital aery is a branch of the maxillary aery. It comes through the infraorbital foramen, inferior to the eye. It supplies the maxillary sinus, the maxillary incisors, canine and premolar teeth, and the skin of the cheek below the orbit. The supraorbital aery is another branch of the maxillary aery. It comes through the supraorbital foramen and supplies blood to the muscles, skin and fascia of the forehead. The lacrimal aery is a branch of the ophthalmic aery that supplies the lacrimal gland. The nasociliary aery doesn't exist, but there is a nasociliary nerve that travels with the ophthalmic aery. Ref: Moon D. A., Foreman K. B., Albeine K. H. (2011). Chapter 18. Orbit. In D. A. Moon, K.

        "question": "Most serious complication seen in other eye after traumatic injury to one eye: March 2005, September 2008",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Sympathetic ophthalmia Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) is a condition in which serious inflammation attacks the sound eye after injury (including intraocular surgeries) to the other. It is the most dreaded complication of unilateral severe eye injury, as it can leave the patient completely blind. Symptoms may develop from days to several years after a penetrating eye injury. Sympathetic ophthalmia is thought to be an autoimmune inflammatory response toward ocular antigens, specifically a delayed hypersensitivity to melanin-containing structures from the outer segments of the photoreceptor layer of the retina. It is thought that Louis Braille, who injured his left eye as a child, lost vision in his right eye due to SO Floating spots and loss of accommodation are among the earliest symptoms. The disease may progress to severe iridocyclitis with pain and photophobia. Commonly the eye remains relatively painless while the inflammatory disease spreads through the uvea. The retina, however, usually remains uninvolved. Papilledema, secondary glaucoma, vitiligo and poliosis of the eyelashes may accompany SO. Diagnosis is clinical, seeking a history of eye injury. An impoant differential diagnosis is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH), which is thought to have the same pathogenesis, without a history of surgery or penetrating eye injury. Definitive prevention of SO requires prompt (within the first 7 to 10 days following injury) enucleation of the injured eye. Evisceration--the removal of the contents of the globe while leaving the sclera and extraocular muscles intact--is easier to perform, offers long-term orbital stability, and is more aesthetically pleasing. But evisceration may lead to a higher incidence of SO compared to enucleation. Immunosuppressive therapy is the mainstay of treatment for SO. When initiated promptly following injury, it is effective in controlling the inflammation and improving the prognosis.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: It manifests just after bih Keratoconus is frequently due to a congenital weakness of the cornea, though it manifests itself after pubey. However it can occur secondarily following trauma or Down's syndrome. Keratoconus is divided into mild, moderate, and advanced. Mild keratoconus - External and corneal signs are often absent or minimal. - A history of multiple inadequate spectacle corrections of one or both eyes may be noted and may include oblique astigmatism on refraction as well as moderate-to-high myopia. - Irregularly astigmatic keratometry values (egg-shaped), not necessarily on the steep side of normal (approximately 45 diopters (D)), are consistent with diagnosis. Diagnosis can be confirmed with computer-assisted videokeratography, which may reveal corneal inferior steepening (approximately 80% of keratoconus cases), central corneal astigmatic steepening (approximately 15% of keratoconus cases), or even bilateral temporal steepening (extremely rare). Diagnosis may also be aided by applying a diagnostic rigid contact lens with its base curve equal to the flat keratometry value. One observes a typical nipple pattern by use of sodium fluorescein dye in the underlying tear film. Moderate keratoconus One or more corneal signs of keratoconus are often present. Enhanced appearance of the corneal nerves is noted. Approximately 40% of eyes in patients with moderate keratoconus develop Vogt striae (fine-stress lines) in the deep stroma. Approximately 50% develop the deposition of iron in the basal epithelial cells in a (often paial) ring shape at the base of the conical protrusion called the Fleischer ring. Approximately 20% develop corneal scarring. Superficial corneal scarring can be fibular, nebular, or nodular. Deep stromal scarring may occur, perhaps representing resolved mini-hydrops events. Some patients show scarring at the level of the Descemet membrane (posterior limiting lamina), consistent in appearance with posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy. Paraxial (usually inferior to the pupil) stromal thinning may be appreciated. Keratometry values typically increase to 45-52 D. Distoion of the retinoscopy and direct ophthalmoscope red pupillary reflex may allow observation of \"scissoring\" or an inferior distoion termed the oil drop sign. The Munson sign is noted when, upon downgaze, a \"V\" shape is noted in the cornea's profile against the lower lid margin, an accentuation of the conical shape of the modest to advanced keratoconus cornea. Advanced keratoconus This often results in keratometry values greater than 52 D and enhancement of all corneal signs, symptoms, and visual loss/distoion. Vogt striae are seen in approximately 60% of eyes, and Fleischer ring and/or scarring are seen in approximately 70% of eyes. Acute corneal hydrops can occur. Treatment: In the early stages, vision may be improved with spectacles but contact lens are more beneficial as they eliminate the irregular corneal curvature. If the disease progresses and the cone hydrated, the most satisfactory treatment is corneal transplantation.",

Because of high hypermetropia, an aphakic eye requires the correcting spectacle lens of about 10-11 D worn in the usual position if the eye were previously emmetropic. The retinal image of aphakic eye wearing spectacles is about 25% (quaer) magnified/ larger than the emmetropic image. Hence vision of even 6/6 with 10-11 D glasses is not quite as good as it seems. Because of the disparity of images, correcting unilateral aphakia with spectacles when there is good vision in other eye 1/ t an intolerable diplopia. With contact lenses, a comfoable binocular vision may be attained in aphakia. However, posterior chamber intraocular (in bag) lens implantation is the best available method of correcting aphakiaQ - The optical rehabilitation of aphakia is best done by IOL implants and best site for intraocular lens implants is posterior chamber or within capsular bag Q and this is the normal anatomical position. Whereas anterior chamber lens has more complications like corneal endothelial damage, secondary glucoma, uveitis etc. - With incision in upper pa of cornea, the sutureless phacoemulsification produces 0. 5-1D 'against the rule' astigmatism (since cornea is flattened in veical meridian) whereas, extra capsular cataract extraction (ECCE) performed with sutures produces 1 D to 3 D 'with the rule' astigmatism (which gradually reduces after suture removal & thee after). Aphakia Aphakia means absence of crystalline lens from eye. However from optical point of view, it may be considered a condition in which the lens is absent from the pupillary area. Causes of aphakia are - congenital absence of lens, surgical aphakia (most common), traumatic absorption or extrusion of lens and posterior dislocation of lens Optical changes of aphakia eye are: - Total power of eye is reduced to +44 D from + 60 D Q - Eye becomes highly hypermetropic (10-11 D) Q - All accommodation is lost Q - The anterior focal point becomes 24 mm (15 nun for normal eye) in front of the cornea - The posterior focal point becomes 31 mm (24 mm for normal eye) behind the cornea i. e. about 7 mm behind the eye ball (anteroposterior length of eye ball is 24 mm) Signs of aphakia are - deep anterior chamber, jet black pupil, iridodonesis (i. e. tremulousness of iris) and purkinje's image test shows only two images (normally four images are seen). Main symptoms of aphakia is marked defective vision for both far and near d/t high hypermetropia and loss of accommodationQ.

The facial veins make clinically impoant connections with the cavernous sinus through the superior ophthalmic veins. Cavernous sinus thrombosis usually results from infections in the orbit, nasal sinuses, and superior pa of the face. Think Detail: Cavernous sinus: is located on the side of the body of sphenoid. The cavernous sinuses consist of extradural venous plexuses surrounded by a dural fold.

Clinical features: Infection of the cavernous sinus is characterized by sepsis, orbital pain, chemosis, proptosis, and ophthalmoplegia. Cavernous sinus thrombosis results in paresis of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI and the opthalmic and maxillary divisions of the cranial nerve V. The diagnosis is based primarily on clinical data. CT and MR imaging can provide diagnostic information. Treatment is with broad spectrum antibiotics and should be staed early. This has high moality. Cavernous sinus syndrome: is characterized by multiple cranial neuropathies. The clinical presentation includes impairment of ocular motor nerves, Horner's syndrome, and sensory loss of the first or second divisions of the trigeminal nerve in various combinations. The pupil may be involved or spared or may appear spared with concomitant oculosympathetic and parasympathetic involvement.

The condition is usually unilateral and chronic in nature and is characterized by a chronic non-granulomatous uveitis and eventually results in iris heterochromia (a change in the colour of iris) The disease has following characteristic features: Heterochromia of iris Diffuse stromal iris atrophy Fine KPs at back of cornea Faint aqueous flare Absence of posterior synechiae A fairly common rubeosis iridis, sometimes associated with neovascularisation of the angle of anterior chamber. Comparatively early development of complicated cataract and secondary glaucoma (usually open angle type). Glaucoma has been repoed in 10-59% of cases. Treatment Fuch's heterchromic uveitis responds variable to steroids and cycloplegics. The complications of long term use of these drugs may at times outweigh their potential benefits. Therefore, treatment with topical steroids is given to iritis which is sufficiently active to require the treatment, otherwise the patient is routinely followed without giving any treatment. Cataract responds well to mostforms of intraocular surgeries, including the standard IOL implantation. Hyphernia may occur because of rubeosis iridis (neovascularization of iris).

Dermoid and Capillary hemangiomas are primarily extraconal lesions. Cavernous hemangioma Cavernous hemangioma is the most common orbital vascular tumor in adults. Patients are typically middle aged (2nd to 4th decade) Present with slowly progressive painless proptosis Mostly its intraconal (>80%) but may also be extraconal. Cavernous hetnangiomas possess a distinct fibrous pseudo capsule and therefore on CT and MR appear well defined masses. Cavernous hemangioma is easily resectable as it is: - well encapsulated - does not have a prominent aerial supply (in contrast to capillary hemangioma) Capillary hemangioma Capillary hemangiomas occur primarily in infants. The tumor often increases in size for 6 to 10 months and then gradually involutes. Mostly extraconal, commonly occur in superior nasal quadrant. Capillary hemangiomas in and around the orbit may have an aerial supply from either the external carotid or internal carotid aeries. These tumors are capable of profuse bleeding. On CT and MR these lesions appear fairly well marginated to poorly marginated. Hemangiopericytomas Hemangiopericytomas are rare, slow growing vascular neoplasms that arise from the pericytes of Zimmermann, which normally envelop capillaries. About 50% cases are malignant. On CT and MR the orbital hemangiopericytoma, in contrast to cavernous hemangioma, appear less distint owing to its tendency to invade the surrounding tissues. Angiography may differentiate the tumors from cavernous hemangioma, meningioma, and schwannoma. - Hemangiopericytomas usually have an early florid blush - Cavernous hemangiomas show late minor pooling of contrast, or often appear as avascular masses - Meningiomas may show multiple tumor vessels and a late blush - Schwannomas may show no tumor blush. Dermoid Dermoid and epidermoids are the most frequent development cysts of the orbit. They result from the inclusion of ectodermal elements during closure of the neural tube. The dermoid contains one or more dermal adnexal structures such as sebaceous glands and hair folliclels.

One or both eyes may be involved at either the same time or one following the other. Approximately two thirds of cases affect one eye only. Mooren's ulcer is more common in men than women. Damage begins at the edge of the cornea and may progress to involve the central cornea. A serious complication of Mooren's ulcer is formation of a perforation or hole, in the cornea.

The ability of the subject to continue to see one complete picture when his eyes are made to converge or diverge a few degrees, gives the positive and negative fusion range, respectively. 3.

In diabetic adults, coin- pared to non-diabetics, cataracts are more prevalent, are dependent on the duration of diabetes and progress more rapidly. The mechanisms are believed to be glycation, carbamylation of crystallins and increased oxidative damage. True diabetic cataract is a rare condition occurring typi- cally in young people in whom the diabetes is so acute as to disturb grossly the water balance of the body. A large number of fluid vacuoles appear under the anterior -td posterior pas of the capsule, initially manifesting as myopia and then producing a diffuse opacity which at this stage is reversible. The lens then rapidly becomes cataractous, with dense, white subcapsular opacities in the anterior and posterior coex resembling a snowstorm- 'snowflake' cataract. Fine, needle-shaped polychromatic coical opacities may also form. With appropriate treatment to control hyperglycaemia, the rapid progression to mature cataract may be arrested at this stage.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Flat cornea Angle closure glaucoma is caused by contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork, which in turn obstructs outflow of the aqueous humor from the eye. Predisposing factors include sho eye, small corneal diameter, a shallow anterior chamber, and a relative anterior positioning of the lens-iris diaphragm. These all lead to a very narrow space at the angle of the anterior chamber. In over half of all cases, prolonged contact between iris and TM causes the formation of synechiae (effectively \"scars\"). These cause permanent obstruction of aqueous outflow. Diagnosis is made from physical signs and symptoms: very highly raised intraocular pressure, pupils are veically oval and mid-dilated and unresponsive to light, cornea edematous (cloudy), reduced vision, redness, pain. Once any symptoms have been controlled, the first line (and often definitive) treatment is laser iridotomy. This may be performed using either Nd: YAG or argon lasers, or in some cases by conventional incisional surgery. In early to moderately advanced cases, iridotomy is successful in opening the angle in around 75% of cases. In the other 25% laser iridoplasty, medication (pilocarpine) or incisional surgery may be required.",

In most cases it is preferable to attempt panretinal photocoagulation, because the more laser a patient has previtrectomy the better he or she usually does after vitrectomy. An uncommon and unfounate complication of panretinal photocoagulation, paicularly in patients with vitreous hemorrhage & preexisting fibrosis, is acceleration or production of a tractional detachment by the laser treatment. Vitrectomy removes the scaffolding & possible stimuli (disintegrated blood products) for neovascular growth. Endophotocoagulation is used exclusively during a vitrectomy procedureQ. The endophotocoagulation probe may have a laser fiber +- an aspirating po to help remove subretinal fluid. To best treat retinal tears by endophotocoagulation, it is impoant that all subretinal fluids be removed from under the retina for the laser to take. If all traction is removed from the tear, once the fluid is removed from under the retina, it usually does not accumulate. Epiretinal membrane is a thin sheet of abnormal scar tissue that grows over the retina and causes distoion of vision due to macular puckering (s/t contracted epiretinal membrane), detachment (secondary to localized retinal traction) and opacification of membrane.",

It occurs both free and salt like combination with proteins and forms ground substance of the mesenchyme, an integral gel like ground substance of connective tissue and other tissues. It is composed of repeating units of N acetyl glucosamine and D glucuronic acid. Functions: It acts as a cementing substance and contribution to tissue barriers which permits metabolites to pass through but resist penetration by bacteria and other infective agents. In joints it acts as a lubricant and shock absorbent. Ref: Textbook of Medical Biochemistry By M. N. Chatterjea, page 38.

Very minute ecchymoses, or possibly thromboses, are seen in severe conjunctivitis; large extravasations accompany severe straining, especially in old people, as on lifting heavy weights or vomiting. They are not infrequently seen in children with whooping cough and may occur in scurvy, blood diseases such as purpura, or in malaria. Recurrent subconjunctival haemorrhages warrant investigations for a bleeding diatheses or leukaemia. The differential diagnosis includes Kaposi sarcoma. More serious are the large sub-conjunctival ecchymoses which seep forwards from the fonix following head injuries. They are due to an extravasation of blood along the floor of the orbit, secondary to a fracture of the base of the skull. In fractures of the sphenoid the blood appears later on the temporal side than elsewhere. Haemorrhages also result from severe or prolonged pressure on the thorax and abdomen, as in persons squeezed in a crowd or by machinery.

        "question": "Which of the following reflects wavelength (nanometers) of Laser used for shaping cornea in refractive surgery:",
        "exp": "A i. e. 193 - Corneal reshaping refractive procedures such as photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser assisted epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK), & laser assisted insitu keratomileusis (LASIK), used to correct refractive errors (myopia and hypermetropia), are ultraviolet-photoablation procedures using Excimer (also k/a argon fluoride/Ar-F- excimer) laser of ultraviolet (193 nm) wave lengthQ. Myopia is treated by ablating the central anterior corneal surface so that it becomes flatter; 10um ablation corrects 1D myopia. Hypermetropia is corrected by ablation of periphery so that the centre becomes steeper. Excimer laser (193 nm) corneal reshaping refractory surgery is of 2 types. In PRK the anterior surface of cornea is ablated by laser, which can correct myopia upto 6D, astigmatism upto 3D and low hypermetropia. The more popular other method is LASIK, in which superficial circular flap of epithelium & stroma is cut with microkeratome (an automated sharp blade), lifting up 120-150 pm thick hinged flap attached on one side. The stromal bed is laser ablated to desired extent ensuring minimal stromal bed thickness of 250 pm (to maintain stability & prevent iatrogenic ectasia). Following this the flap is repositioned without sutures; this can corret hypermetropia upto 4D, astigmatism upto 5D and myopia upto 12D. Modifications to minimize microkeratome related complications include use of 20% alcohol (30-40 seconds) to lift / clear thin epithelial flap (LASEK), use of special microkeratome to cut & separate a thin flap of epithelium & Bowman's layer (Epi - LASIK) and use of femto second laser to pre fashion the anterior flap to a desired size and depth without using a surgical blade Refractive Keratoplasty to modify refractive power of cornea may be done by: (i) radial keratotomy (radial incisions are made in cornea); (ii) arcuate keratotomy (arcuate shaped incisions in steeper or more myopic meridian to reduce astigmatism); (iii) Keratomileusis (tissue resected & modified in shape before replacement) and (iv) epikeratophakia, where donor corneal tissue is attached to the host cornea after removal of epithelium capsulectomy in an eye with a silicone intraocular lens implant is challenging because optical breakdown occurs in silicone at relatively low power, therefore damaging IOL even when the laser is focused posterior to implant. Procedure is even more difficult if capsule is in intimate contact with the implant. Use of corneal contact lens during laser capsulectomy result in steeper convergence & more sharply focused Nd YAG laser beam. - IOL made of PMMA and acrylic are less susceptible to optical breakdown than silicone lenses. Photodisruption (PD) - PD is a mechanical effect produced by highly focused laser (with high electromagnetic field strength), which can actually strip electrons from their nuclei, destroying chemical nature of material producing an entirely different physical state of matter called plasma. - In plasma, the orderly array of molecules is fractured into a random mixture of electron & protons in a process called optical break down, which is basically a miniature lightening bolt or thunderclap. Vapors formed by lightning bolt expands, quickly collapse and produce a miniature thunder clap. Acoustic shock waves produced from thunderclap cause most of the tissue damage. - PD optical breakdown requires electro magnetic fields so powerful they can be produced only by concentrating lasr energy into very brief periods, thereby giving each pulse an extremely high power. Infrared Nd: YAG laser (1064nm) with Q switching or mode locking pulsing is used for PD. Q switching is most commonly used, inexpansive and reliable but cant produce pulses as sho or powerful as mode locking. Whereas, mode locking are expansive and difficult to maintain but more powerful. - Nd: YAG laser is infrared, invisible, so aiming system (a red helium-neon / He-Ne laser) is necessary. However, the patient's eye cause the red aiming beam to bend more than Nd: YAG's infrared laser. Therefore, the focus of both rarely coincide precisely (chromatic aberration). Photodisruption with infrared Nd: YAG laser (1064nm) is used in performing posterior lens capsulectomyQ. Photocoagulation (PC) - In PC, laser light (mostly visible or sometimes infrared) is absorbed by the target tissue or by neighbouring tissue, generating heat that coagulates (denatures) proteins. - It is the most commonly used laser procedure performed during panretinal photocoagulation, argon laser trabeculoplasty, peripheral iridecotomy, and thermal destruction of choroidal neovascular membranes. It is used in treatment of various conditions. Anterior segment PC Posterior segment PC - lridoplasty - Proliferative DR - Iridotomy - Diabetic macular edema - Trabeculoplasty - Choroidal neovascularization - Cyclophoto secondary to age related macular coagulation degeneration - Retinal breaks - Retinal detachments - Types of laser that produce PC include Laser Wave length (nm) Argon Blue- Green 488 Argon-Green 514 Frequency doubled (2x) Nd-YAG (green) 532 Rhodamine 6G Organic tunable Dye laser (Yellow-Red) 570 to 630 Krypton-Red 647 Ruby - Red 694 Diode (near infrared) 810 - Increase in exposure time modestly increases the lesion's diameter and also extends damage deeper into target tissue (eg 10 fold ET doubles diameter). Whereas very brief exposure times (0. 01-0. 05 seconds), allow little time for heat to dissipate from the burn. Therefore a small area of intense burn is produced, resulting in perforation of delicate ocular structures like neural retina & Bruch's membrane. - An increase in power has strong influence on lesion diameter (doubling power doubles size) but creates more damage and can be painful. In most PC lasers, the energy is concentrated in the centre of beam, with less energy at edges. Therefore, use of excessive power during laser treatment of retina may result in inadveent retinal hole. Also the lower energy at periphery may produce permanent tissue damage even though it does not produce a visible reaction. This means the area of laser damage may extend beyond the area of immediately visible reaction. In sensitive areas such as macula, a small spot size (100pm) is preferred so as to minimize unnecessary adjacent damage. In contrast, larger spot size (200-500pm) is preferred for panretinal photocoagulation. - Laser contact lenses also increase spot size Laser contact lens Multiplication factor of increased spot size Goldman three mirror lens 1. 08 Panfundoscopic lens 1. 41 Mainster wide angle lens 1. 47 Quadr Aspheric lens 1. 92 If the spot size is increased, the power needs to be increased. However, because energy is concentrated in centre of beam, it is best to raise power only modestly (no more than two folds at a time) and to test burns to refine the power settings. Photoablation (PA) - PA breaks chemical bonds that hold tissue together, essentially vaporizing the tissue. Chemical bonds are broken by absorption of Photons without any external mechanical pressure. Therefore, the laser is able to remove tissue with more precision and with much less damage to surrounding tissue. - It is most recent light tissue interaction using argon-fluoride (Ar-F) excimer laser producing electro magnetic energy with a wave length of 193 nm (in the extreme ultraviolet). - Photoablation used for shaping cornea in refractive surgery and to treat corneal pathology such as corneal ulcers and scars. - Excimer laser removes --0. 1 mm of corneal tissue with each pulse. Beam shaping optics are used to create even beam profile; however, these are ablated slowly & must be replaced periodically. - Irregularities in corneal stroma, presence of keratinocytes, & variable corneal collagen density (depending on altitude, atmospheric pressure, humidity, age and duration of procedure) may cause uneven ablation even when beam profile is uniform.",

Most of the (85%) uveal melanomas arise in the choroid. So, choroidal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular tumor in adults. Tumor arises from dendritic melanocytes (neural crest, neuroectodermal origin). Histologically choroidal melanoma can be divided into: - Spindle cell melanomas: - These melanomas contain predominantly spindle cells. These melanomas are fuher subdivided into Spindle A or Spindle B depending upon the type of cells. Epitheloid cell melanomas: - Contain epitheloid like cells. Mixed cell melanomas: - Contain both spindle cells and epitheloid cells. Choroidal melanoma presents as a sessile or dome shaped mass located deep to the sensory retina. A secondary non-rheugmatogenous retinal detachment frequently occurs. Involvement of voex vein by tumor results in glaucoma. With continued growth, a choroidal melanoma can rupture Bruch's membane and assume a mushroom shape. When that occurs, tumor has a tendency to bleed, and vitreal or subretinal hemorrhage may occur.",

Presbyopia is a condition that occurs as a pa of normal ageing and is not considered to be an eye diseasedeg. Symptoms are usually noticeable by age 40-45 and continue to develop until the process stabilizes some 10-20 years later. Causes: As individuals age, the lens becomes less flexible and elastic, and the muscles become less powerful Because these changes result in inadequate adjustment of the lens of the eye for various distances, objects that are close will appear blurry Major cause: Loss of elasticity of the lens of the eye Loss of ciliary muscle power, however, is also believed to contribute to the problemQ. Symptoms: Individuals typically have difficulty in reading small print, and may need to hold reading materials at arm's lengthQ. Symptoms include headache and eyestrain when doing close work, blurry vision, and eye fatigueQ. Symptoms may be worse early in the morning or when individuals are fatigued Dim lighting may also aggravate the problemQ. Diagnosis: Diagnosed during an eye examination conducted by eye specialists, such as optometrists or ophthalmologists. Pa of the examination will assess vision while reading by using various strength lenses. Treatment: Presbyopia cannot be cured, but individuals can compensate for it by wearing reading, bifocal, or trifocal eye glassesQ A convex lens. Qis used to make up for the lost automatic focusing power of the eye. Half-glasses can be worn, which leave the top open and uncorrected for distance vision In addition to glasses, contact lenses have also been found to be useful in the treatment of presbyopia",

Rx: Medical treatment is usually staed with intensive topical propamidine isethionate (1% solution) and either polyhexamethylene biguanide (0. 01%-0. 02% solution) or foified neomycin eyedrops Polyhexamethylene biguanide is considered first line agent in the treatment of acanthamoeba. It is available as a contact lens disinfectant at a low concentration and as a swimming pool supplement at high concentration. This drug interferes with cytoplasmic membrane integrity and inhibit essential respiratory enzymes of multiple microbes. Other treatment options includes use of: Aromatic diamidines such as propamidine isethionate, brolene and pentamidine, neomycin and paramomycin, imidazoles and triazole antifungals and polymixins.

Therefore fluorescein angiography is used primarily for retinal vasculature. On the other hand, indocyanine green angiography is used primarily for choroidal vasculature because:- Indocyanine green stays within the choroidal circulation and is stimulated by a longer wavelength of light than fluorescein dye. This provides a better resolution of the choroidal vasculature, especially choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVM).

The reason for maximum refraction lies in the fact that when light travel from one refractive medium to other, refraction will be more if the difference between the refractive index of the two surfaces is more. In the eye, there are three such refracting interfaces:- Air - cornea: Difference between refractive index is 0. 38 (1. 38 of cornea minus 1. 00 of air). Aqueous - lens.: Difference between refractive index is 0. 064 (1. 4 of lens minus 1. 336 of aqueous). Lens - vitreous: Difference between refractive index is 0. 064 (1. 4 of lens minus 1. 336 of vitreous). As air-cornea interface has a maximum difference in refractive index, maximum refraction occurs from the anterior surface of the cornea. Therefore, out of + 60 D (total diopter power of eye), + 44 D is provided by the cornea. It is important to mention one important fact here. Normally cornea is covered by tear, so actual refraction occurs at the air-tear interface. Tear has refractive index 1. 336. Difference between refractive index at air tear interface is (0. 336), maximum of all interface. Therefore, maximum refraction occurs at the air-tear interface. So, remember If the air-tear interface is there in options it is the best answer. If it is not in options, air-cornea is the best answer.",

He describes the visual loss as a gradual progression from blurry to total blackout over the past two hours. He has no history of prior visual problems. Past medical history is significant for a myocardial infarction three years ago. The patient takes aspirin daily. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination reveals 20/20 vision of the left eye but no vision in the right eye. Extraocular muscles are intact. The neurologic examination is normal. The cardiac examination reveals an S4 heart sound. The most likely cause of this unilateral blindness is which of the following?",
        "exp": "This patient has a sudden onset of complete, unilateral, painless loss of vision with intact extraocular muscle movement. This is consistent with occlusion of the retinal aery. The retina derives its blood supply from the internal carotid aery the ophthalmic aery, from which branch the central retinal aery and ciliary aeries. The central retinal aery supplies the inner layers of retina, while ciliary aeries supply blood to the choriocapillaris and the outer retinal layers. Occlusion of small retinal aerioles produces \"cotton wool\" spots while total occlusion of the ophthalmic aery leads to total ischemia and blindness. This usually occurs secondary to atherosclerotic disease. The key here is recognizing that the loss of vision is an isolated finding with no other neurologic symptoms. Other deficits would be consistent with a stroke of a larger vascular territory such as the internal carotid aery. Carotid aery dissection is less likely than retinal aery occlusion because there would likely be multiple associated neurologic findings in the case of dissection, as the internal carotid aery supplies a large poion of the anterior circulation of the brain. The most likely symptoms among a large cadre of possibilities is face and arm weakness contralateral to the dissection. Cavernous sinus thrombosis would lead to facial pain and possible cranial nerve deficits. The optic nerve (cranial nerve II) extends anteriorly from the optic chiasm through the superior orbital fissure. Posterior cerebral aery occlusion is less likely than retinal aery occlusion because there would likely be multiple associated neurologic findings. Also, the visual field loss resulting from a unilateral posterior cerebral aery occlusion would more likely be a homonymous hemianopia, it would not cause complete blindness in one eye. Other changes that may occur from posterior cerebral aery stroke are complex findings, such as the inability of recognize faces (prosopagnosia), failure to connect visual perception with conscious thought, color vision loss, and difficulty with reading (dyslexia or alexia). Memory problems and motor impairment are also common associated findings.",

Mechanism of action: Heterotrimeric Transducin (alpha-beta-gamma subunits) is activated by a conformational change in rhodopsin due to the absorption of a photon by rhodopsin's active group retinal. Activation causes the GDP bound to the alpha subunit to be exchanged with GTP from solution and results in activated alpha dissociating from beta-gamma. Active Transducin-alpha then causes cyclic GMP Phosphodiesterase to increase its activity, thereby lowering the concentration of c. GMP, an intracellular second-messenger molecule. Decrease in c. GMP concentration leads to the closure of c. GMP-regulated Na+ and Ca2+ ion channels and a hyperpolarized membrane potential. This chain of signaling events is also called \"the veebrate photo transduction cascade\"",

        "question": "Unilateral proptosis in a 40 year old lady is commonly due to: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Graves ophthalmopathy Graves ophthalmopathy (dysthyroid eye disease) is the most common cause of unilateral or bilateral proptosis in adults between the ages of 25-50 years Graves' ophthalmopathy/ Thyroid eye disease (TED)/ dysthyroid/thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TAO), Graves' orbitopathy It is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the orbit around the eye, characterized by upper eyelid retraction, swelling (edema), redness (erythema), conjunctivitis, and bulging eyes (proptosis). It is pa of a systemic process with variable expression in the eyes, thyroid, and skin, caused by autoantibodies that bind to tissues in those organs, and, in general, occurs with hypehyroidism. The most common form of hypehyroidism is Graves' disease. The autoantibodies target the fibroblasts in the eye muscles, and those fibroblasts can differentiate into fat cells (adipocytes). Fat cells and muscles expand and become inflamed. Veins become compressed, and are unable to drain fluid, causing edema. Cigarette smoking, which is associated with many autoimmune diseases, raises the incidence 7. 7-fold. Epidemiology The pathology mostly affects persons of 30 to 50 years of age. Females are four times more likely to develop TAO than males. When males are affected, they tend to have a later onset and a poor prognosis. Pathophysiology In mild disease, patients present with eyelid retraction. In fact, upper eyelid retraction is the most common ocular sign of Graves' orbitopathy. This finding is associated with lid lag on infraduction (Von Graefe's sign), eye globe lag on supraduction (Kocher's sign), a widened palpebral fissure during fixation (Dalrymple's sign) and an incapacity of closing the eyelids completely (lagophthalmos). Due to the proptosis, eyelid retraction and lagophthalmos, the cornea is more prone to dryness and may present with chemosis, punctate epithelial erosions and superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis. The patients also have a dysfunction of the lacrimal gland with a decrease of the quantity and composition of tears produced. In moderate active disease, the signs and symptoms are persistent and increasing and include myopathy. The inflammation and edema of the extraocular muscles lead to gaze abnormalities. The inferior rectus muscle is the most commonly affected muscle and patient may experience veical diplopia on upgaze and limitation of elevation of the eyes due to fibrosis of the muscle. This may also increase the intraocular pressure of the eyes. The double vision is initially intermittent but can gradually become chronic. The medial rectus is the second-most-commonly-affected muscle, but multiple muscles may be affected, in an asymmetric fashion. In more severe and active disease, mass effects and cicatricial changes occur within the orbit. This is manifested by a progressive exophthalmos, a restrictive myopathy that restricts eye movements and an optic neuropathy. With enlargement of the extraocular muscle at the orbital apex, the optic nerve is at risk of compression. The orbital fat or the stretching of the nerve due to increased orbital volume may also lead to optic nerve damage. The patient experiences a loss of visual acuity, visual field defect, afferent pupillary defect, and loss of color vision. Diagnostic Graves' ophthalmopathy is diagnosed clinically by the presenting ocular signs and symptoms, but positive tests for antibodies (anti-thyroglobulin, anti-microsomal and anti-thyrotropin receptor) and abnormalities in thyroid hormones level (T3, T4, and TSH) help in suppoing the diagnosis. Orbital imaging is an interesting tool for the diagnosis of Graves' ophthalmopathy and is useful in monitoring patients for progression of the disease. Ultrasonography may detect early Graves' orbitopathy in patients without clinical orbital findings. It is less reliable than the CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Thus, CT scan or MRI is necessary when optic nerve involvement is suspected. On neuroimaging, the most characteristic findings are thick extraocular muscles with tendon sparing, usually bilateral, and proptosis. Classification of Graves' eye disease Mnemonic: \"NO SPECS\": Class 0: No signs or symptoms Class 1: Only signs (limited to upper lid retraction and stare, with or without lid lag) Class 2: Soft tissue involvement (oedema of conjunctivae and lids, conjunctival injection, etc.) Class 3: Proptosis Class 4: Extraocular muscle involvement (usually with diplopia) Class 5: Corneal involvement (primarily due to lagophthalmos) Class 6: Sight loss (due to optic nerve involvement) Treatment The first step is the regulation of thyroid hormone levels by a physician. Topical lubrication of the ocular surface is used to avoid corneal damage caused by exposure. Tarsorrhaphy is an alternative option when the complications of ocular exposure can't be avoided solely with the drops. Coicosteroids are efficient in reducing orbital inflammation, but the benefits cease after discontinuation. Radiotherapy is an alternative option to reduce acute orbital inflammation. A simple way of reducing inflammation is smoking cessation, as pro-inflammatory substances are found in cigarettes. Surgery may be done to decompress the orbit, to improve the proptosis, and to address the strabismus causing diplopia. Surgery is performed once the patient's disease has been stable for at least six months. Eyelid surgery is the most common surgery performed on Graves ophthalmopathy patients. TAO is an orbital autoimmune disease. The thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSH-R) is an antigen found in orbital fat and connective tissue, and is a target for autoimmune assault. On histological examination, there is an infiltration of the orbital connective tissue by lymphocytes, plasmocytes, and mastocytes. The inflammation results in a deposition of collagen and glycosaminoglycans in the muscles, which leads to subsequent enlargement and fibrosis. There is also an induction of the lipogenesis by fibroblasts and preadipocytes, which causes orbital volume enlargement due to fat deposition. Poor prognostic indicators Age greater than 50 years Rapid onset of symptoms under 3 months Cigarette smoking Diabetes Severe or uncontrolled hypehyroidism Presence of pretibial myxedema High cholesterol levels (hyperlipidemia) Peripheral vascular disease",

So, a staphyloma is lined internally by uveal tissue and externally by weak cornea or sclera. Staphyloma is divided anatomically into:? 1. Anterior staphyloma: - Protrusion and adhesion of iris to ectatic cornea. The most common cause is a sloughing corneal ulcer which perforates and heals with the formation of pseudocornea by the organization of exudates and laying down of fibrous tissue. It is lined internally by iris. 2. Intercalary staphyloma: - It occurs at the limbus. It is lined internally by the root of iris and the anterior most poion of the ciliary body. The causes are perforating injuries to limbus, marginal corneal ulcer, anterior scleritis, Scleromalacia perforans, Complicated cataract surgery, secondary angle closure glaucoma. 3. Ciliary staphyloma: - This affects the ciliary zone that includes the region upto 8 mm behind the limbus. The ciliary body is incarcerated in the region of scleral ectasia. Causes are Developmental glaucoma, Primary or secondary glaucoma end stage, scleritis, trauma to ciliary region. 4. Equatorial staphyloma: - This occurs at the equatorial region of the eye with incarceration of the choroid. Causes are scleritis, degenerative myopia and chronic uncontrolled glaucoma. 5.

Our eyes have been provided with a unique mechanism by which we can even focus the diverging rays coming from a near object on the retina in a bid to see clearly. This mechanism is the accommodation. In accommodation there occurs increase in the power of crystaline lens due to increase in the curvature of its surfaces. Accommodation is due to contraction of ciliary muscles. Near point and far point are related to accommodation The near point is the closest distance between an object and eye that makes possible the formed image to be focused, i. e., it is the point in which accommodation is maximum (ciliary muscles are maximally contracted). Far point is the most distant point from the eye in which an object can be placed and its image is still focused, i. e., it is the situation of maximum relaxation of ciliary muscles. In myopia near point and far point of vision come closer and in hypermetropic near point becomes more distant.

C: Paicles in vitreous With age, the normally transparent vitreous gel liquefies and breaks up, leading to the presence of little paicles and fibrous strands floating in the vitreous cavity and casts shadow onto the retina Patient may complain of seeing black dots, rings, strands etc. Vitreous Hemorrhage It is the extravasation of blood into the areas in and around the vitreous humor of the eye. The vitreous humor is the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eye. Causes 1. Diabetic Retinopathy The most common cause found in adults is diabetic retinopathy. Abnormal blood vessels can form in the back of the eye of a person with diabetes. These new blood vessels are weaker and prone to breaking and causing hemorrhage. 2. Trauma Trauma is the leading cause of vitreous hemorrhage in young people, and accounts for 12-18. 8% of cases in adults. 3. Retinal Tear/Detachment A tear in the retina can allow fluids from the eye to leak in behind the retina, which causes retinal detachment. When this occurs, blood from the retinal blood vessels can bleed into the vitreous. 4. Posterior Vitreous Detachment As one gets older, pockets of fluid can develop in the vitreous. When these pockets develop near the back of the eye, the vitreous can pull away from the retina and possibly tear it. 5. Other Causes Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy Macroaneurysm Age-related macular degeneration Terson syndrome Retinal neovascularization as a result of branch or central retinal vein occlusion Symptoms/Diagnosis Blurry vision Floaters- faint cobweb-like apparitions floating through the field of vision Reddish tint to vision Photopsia-brief flashes of light in the peripheral vision Small vitreous hemorrhage often manifests itself as \"floaters\". A moderate case will often result in dark streaks in the vision, while dense vitreous hemorrhage can significantly inhibit vision. Treatments The treatment method used depends on the cause of the hemorrhage. In most cases, the patient is advised to rest with their head elevated 30-45deg and sometimes to put patches over the eyes to limit movement prior to treatment in order to allow the blood to settle. The patient is also advised to avoid taking medications that cause blood thinning (such as aspirin or similar medications). Retinal tears are closed by Laser treatment or cryotherapy, and detached retinas are reattached surgically. In cases of vitreous hemorrhage due to detached retina, long standing vitreous hemorrhage with a duration of more than 2-3 months, or cases associated with rubeosis iridis or glaucoma, a vitrectomy may be necessary to remove the standing blood in the vitreous",

However it may also occur rarely in Euthyroid person, primary hypehyroidism and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thyroid ophthalmopathy is characterized by enlargement of ocular fat and enlargement of extraocular muscles due to deposition of mucopolysaccharides. Clinical features are:- The most common and earliest symptom is upper eyelid retraction. Exophthalmos (Proptosis) Proptosis is the second most common symptom. Thyroid ophthalmopathy is the most common cause of proptosis, whether unilateral or bilateral in adults. Proptosis may be:- Mild exophthalmos:- In hypehyroidis (thyrotoxicosis, Graves disease) Extreme exophthalmos:- In hypothyroidism Restrictive extraocular myopathy:- Enlargement of extraocular muscle without enlargement of tendon is the hallmark of thyroid ophthalmopathy. This distribution of extraocular muscle swelling is typical of thyroid ophthalmopathy. The extraocular muscles involvement in order of decreasing frequency is: Inferior rectus (most commonly involved)> Medial rectus > Superior rectus > Lateral rectus > obliques. It is woh noting that this is restrictive myopathy and the muscle becomes thickened & scarred with detion of eye towards the direction of action of muscle and there is restriction of movement in the direction opposite to the action of the involved muscle, though the opposite muscle is normal. For example in medial rectus involvement eye may be deted medial and abduction will be restricted though the lateral rectus is normal.

Acanthamoeba keratitis It is a rare disease in which amoebae invade the cornea of the eye In developed countries, it is nearly always associated with contact lens use, as Acanthamoeba can survive in the space between the lens and the eye. For this reason, contact lenses must be properly disinfected before wearing, and should be removed when swimming or surfing. However, elsewhere in the world, many cases of Acanthamoeba present in non-contact lens wearers To detect Acanthamoeba on a contact lens in a laboratory, a sheep blood agar plate with a layer (a lawn) of E. coli is made. Pa of the contact lens is placed on the agar plate. If Acanthamoeba are present, they will ingest the bacteria, leaving a clear patch on the plate around the area of the lens. Polymerase chain reaction can also be used to confirm a diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis, especially when contact lenses are not involved. Acanthameoba is also characterized by a brawny edema and hazy view into the interior AC. Late stages of the disease also produces a ring shaped corneal ulcer Signs and symptoms It include severe pain, severe keratitis (similar to stromal herpetic disease), corneal perineuritis, ring ulcer (although this is late in the disease process) Treatment One treatment used is PHMB (poly hexa methyl biguanide). Propamidine isethionate has also shown some effectiveness. Another possible agent is chlorhexidine. Keratoplasty may sometimes be required. A combined regimen of propamidine, miconazole nitrate, and neomycin has also been suggested",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Non perpendicular principal meridians ASTIGMATISM Astigmatism is a type of refractive error wherein the refraction varies in the different meridia. Consequently, the rays of light entering in the eye cannot converge to a point focus but form focal lines. The refractive error of the astigmatic eye stems from a difference in degree of curvature refraction of the two different meridians (i. e., the eye has different focal point in different planes). For example, the image may be clearly focused on retina in the horizontal plane, but not in the veical plane. The most common cause of astigmatism is abnormality of corneal curvature. Other less common causes are lenticular (curvature abnormality of lens, oblique position of lens) and retinal (oblique placement of macula). Types of astigmatism A) Based on axis of the principal meridians 1) Regular stigmatism: Principal meridians are perpendicular With-the-rule astigmatism-the veical meridian is steepest. Against-the-rule astigmatism-the horizontal meridian is steepest. Oblique astigmatism-the steepest curve lies in between 120 and 150 degrees and 30 and 60 degrees. 2) Irregular astigmatism - principal meridians are not perpendicular. B) Based on focus of the principal meridians 1) Simple astigmatism Simple hyperopic astigmatism - first focal line is on retina while the second is located behind the retina Simple myopic astigmatism - first focal line is in front of the retina while the second is on the retina. 2) Compound astigmatism Compound hyperopic astigmatism-both focal lines are located behind the retina. Compound myopic astigmatism-both focal lines are located in front of the retina. 3) Mixed astigmatism-focal lines are on both sides of the retina (straddling the retina). Treatment of. Astigmatism Treatment of astigmatism consists: - Optical treatment: - It consists of cylindrical power spectacles or contact lens. Types of contact lenses used are permeable contact lens, Soft toric contact lens (for high degree astigmatism), hybrid lens, i. e., soft on hard lens, hard contact lens.

        "exp": "Ans. C: EDTA In band shaped keratopathy, improvement of vision may be obtained by dissolving it with the sodium salt of ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (sodium edetate) Band keratopathy It derives its name from the distinctive appearance of calcium deposition in a band across the central cornea. Band keratopathy is the result of precipitation of calcium salts on the corneal surface (directly under the epithelium). Elevated serum calcium or serum phosphate can tip the balance in or of precipitation. Topical medications that contain phosphates also may contribute to this problem. Finally, elevation of the surface pH out of the physiologic range changes the solubility product and ors precipitation. This type of tissue pH change can be seen in chronically inflamed eyes and may explain, in pa, why patients with uveitis are at risk for the development of band keratopathy Presentation Visual acuity will be decreased in propoion with the density of deposition of calcium salts in the central cornea. Slit lamp examination often reveals a whitish-grayish plaquelike deposition that occurs in a band across the cornea. The very periphery of the cornea may be spared because of the buffering effect of limbal blood vessels. Holes in the plaque may be apparent; these holes represent spaces where the corneal nerves are traversing the Bowman membrane to the epithelial surface Features of calcium deposition The calcium deposition typically begins in the periphery and progresses centrally but, occasionally, may begin centrally. The calcium may be very fine or thick and plaquelike. When it is thick, it may flake off, causing epithelial defects and painful symptoms Medical therapy It is ineffective in treating band keratopathy. However, underlying conditions associated with elevated levels of calcium or phosphate should be treated to prevent deposition from recurring (eg, patients on dialysis who subsequently undergo renal transplantation often have a more normal phosphate level). The goals of pharmacotherapy are to reduce plasma calcium levels, to prevent complications, and to reduce morbidity. Edetate calcium disodium Chelates with many divalent and trivalent metals. Because of its affinity for calcium, lowers serum calcium levels during IV infusion. Slow infusion causes mobilization of extracirculatory calcium stores. Also chelates with other polyvalent metals, therefore increasing urinary excretion of magnesium, zinc and other trace elements. Although it does not chelate with potassium, it may reduce the serum potassium level. Do not use for lead toxicity.",

It is woh noting that it is the duration of disease after the onset of puberity, which acts as risk factor. For example, the risk of retinopathy is roughly same for two 25 years old patients, of whom one developed DM at 12 years (onset of pubey) and other at the age of 6 years because both have same duration (13 yrs) of disease after the onset of pubey. The risk of retinopathy in children diagnosed prior to the age of 2 years have a negligible risk of retinopathy for the first 10 years. So, age of onset also acts as a risk factor. However, after onset of pubey, age of onset is not a risk factor. ii) Sex:- Incidence is more in females iii) Poor glycemic control iv) Accompanying factors:- Hypertension, smoking, poor renal status, obesity, hyperlipidemia v) Pregnancy:- May accelerate the changes of diabetic retinopathy.",

The measured level of Anti-Ach-R antibody does not correspond well with the severity of MG in different patients. However, a treatment induced fall often correlates with clinical improvement in individual patient. * Anti-muscle specific kinase antibody Q (MUSK) is found in 40% of Ach R-antibody negative patients with generalized MG. It is not present in Ach R-antibody positive patients or in patients with MG limited to ocular disease * Repetitive nerve stimulation of weak or proximal muscle 6-24 hr after stopping anti Ach E medication; rapid reduction of >10-15% in amplitude of evoked response at 3.

        "question": "Which of the following does not result in optic neuritis: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Hypertension Aetiology of optic neuritis includes immune mediated disorders (local-sympathetic ophthalmitis and systemic-sarcoidosis), metabolic disorders-diabetes etc. Optic neuritis It is the inflammation of the optic nerve that may cause a complete or paial loss of vision. Causes The optic nerve comprises axons that emerge from the retina of the eye and carry visual information to the primary visual nuclei, most of which is relayed to the occipital coex of the brain to be processed into vision. Inflammation of the optic nerve causes loss of vision usually because of the swelling and destruction of the myelin sheath covering the optic nerve. The most common etiology is multiple sclerosis. The presence of demyelinating white matter lesions on brain MRI at the time of presentation of optic neuritis is the strongest predictor for developing clinically definite MS. Some other causes of optic neuritis include infection (e. g. Syphilis, Lyme disease, herpes zoster), autoimmune disorders (e. g. lupus), Inflammatory Bowel Disease, drug induced (e. g. chloramphenicol, Ethambutol) vasculitis and diabetes Symptoms Major symptoms are sudden loss of vision (paial or complete), or sudden blurred or \"foggy\" vision, and pain on movement of the affected eye. The vision might also look \"disturbed/blackened\" rather than blurry, like when feeling dizzy. Many patients with optic neuritis may lose some of their color vision in the affected eye (especially red), with colors appearing subtly washed out compared to the other eye. On medical examination the head of the optic nerve can easily be visualised by an ophthalmoscope; however frequently there is no abnormal appearance of the nerve head in optic neuritis (in cases of retrobulbar optic neuritis), though it may be swollen in some patients (anterior papillitis or more extensive optic neuritis). In many cases, only one eye is affected and patients may not be aware of the loss of color vision until the doctor asks them to close or cover the healthy eye. Epidemiology Optic neuritis typically affects young adults ranging from 18-45 years of age, with a mean age of 30-35 years. There is a strong female predominance. Treatment and prognosis In most cases, visual functions return to near normal within eight to ten weeks, but they may also advance to a complete and permanent state of visual loss. Therefore, systemic intravenous treatment with coicosteroids, which may quicken the healing of the optic nerve, is often recommended Very occasionally, if there is concomitant increased intracranial pressure, the sheath around the optic nerve may be cut to decrease the pressure. When optic neuritis is associated with MRI lesions suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) then general immunosuppressive therapy for MS is most often prescribed (IV methylprednisolone may shoen attacks; initial only oral prednisone may increase relapse rate).",
