        "question": "Most serious complication seen in other eye after traumatic injury to one eye: March 2005, September 2008",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Sympathetic ophthalmia Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) is a condition in which serious inflammation attacks the sound eye after injury (including intraocular surgeries) to the other. It is the most dreaded complication of unilateral severe eye injury, as it can leave the patient completely blind. Symptoms may develop from days to several years after a penetrating eye injury. Sympathetic ophthalmia is thought to be an autoimmune inflammatory response toward ocular antigens, specifically a delayed hypersensitivity to melanin-containing structures from the outer segments of the photoreceptor layer of the retina. It is thought that Louis Braille, who injured his left eye as a child, lost vision in his right eye due to SO Floating spots and loss of accommodation are among the earliest symptoms. The disease may progress to severe iridocyclitis with pain and photophobia. Commonly the eye remains relatively painless while the inflammatory disease spreads through the uvea. The retina, however, usually remains uninvolved. Papilledema, secondary glaucoma, vitiligo and poliosis of the eyelashes may accompany SO. Diagnosis is clinical, seeking a history of eye injury. An impoant differential diagnosis is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH), which is thought to have the same pathogenesis, without a history of surgery or penetrating eye injury. Definitive prevention of SO requires prompt (within the first 7 to 10 days following injury) enucleation of the injured eye. Evisceration--the removal of the contents of the globe while leaving the sclera and extraocular muscles intact--is easier to perform, offers long-term orbital stability, and is more aesthetically pleasing. But evisceration may lead to a higher incidence of SO compared to enucleation. Immunosuppressive therapy is the mainstay of treatment for SO. When initiated promptly following injury, it is effective in controlling the inflammation and improving the prognosis.",

Posterior chamber Classical signs of aphakia are - a deep anterior chamber, iridodonesis (tremulousness of iris), only 2 images on Purkinje's test, dark (jet black) papillary reflexQ and highly hypermetropic small disc on fundus examination with markedly defective vision for both far and near d/t high hypermetropia and absence of accommodationQ. A scar mark around limbusQ is found in surgical aphakia. Because of high hypermetropia, an aphakic eye requires the correcting spectacle lens of about 10-11 D worn in the usual position if the eye were previously emmetropic. The retinal image of aphakic eye wearing spectacles is about 25% (quaer) magnified/ larger than the emmetropic image. Hence vision of even 6/6 with 10-11 D glasses is not quite as good as it seems. Because of the disparity of images, correcting unilateral aphakia with spectacles when there is good vision in other eye 1/ t an intolerable diplopia. With contact lenses, a comfoable binocular vision may be attained in aphakia. However, posterior chamber intraocular (in bag) lens implantation is the best available method of correcting aphakiaQ - The optical rehabilitation of aphakia is best done by IOL implants and best site for intraocular lens implants is posterior chamber or within capsular bag Q and this is the normal anatomical position. Whereas anterior chamber lens has more complications like corneal endothelial damage, secondary glucoma, uveitis etc. - With incision in upper pa of cornea, the sutureless phacoemulsification produces 0. 5-1D 'against the rule' astigmatism (since cornea is flattened in veical meridian) whereas, extra capsular cataract extraction (ECCE) performed with sutures produces 1 D to 3 D 'with the rule' astigmatism (which gradually reduces after suture removal & thee after). Aphakia Aphakia means absence of crystalline lens from eye. However from optical point of view, it may be considered a condition in which the lens is absent from the pupillary area. Causes of aphakia are - congenital absence of lens, surgical aphakia (most common), traumatic absorption or extrusion of lens and posterior dislocation of lens Optical changes of aphakia eye are: - Total power of eye is reduced to +44 D from + 60 D Q - Eye becomes highly hypermetropic (10-11 D) Q - All accommodation is lost Q - The anterior focal point becomes 24 mm (15 nun for normal eye) in front of the cornea - The posterior focal point becomes 31 mm (24 mm for normal eye) behind the cornea i. e. about 7 mm behind the eye ball (anteroposterior length of eye ball is 24 mm) Signs of aphakia are - deep anterior chamber, jet black pupil, iridodonesis (i. e. tremulousness of iris) and purkinje's image test shows only two images (normally four images are seen). Main symptoms of aphakia is marked defective vision for both far and near d/t high hypermetropia and loss of accommodationQ.

Clinical features: Infection of the cavernous sinus is characterized by sepsis, orbital pain, chemosis, proptosis, and ophthalmoplegia. Cavernous sinus thrombosis results in paresis of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI and the opthalmic and maxillary divisions of the cranial nerve V. The diagnosis is based primarily on clinical data. CT and MR imaging can provide diagnostic information. Treatment is with broad spectrum antibiotics and should be staed early. This has high moality.

Patients are typically middle aged (2nd to 4th decade) Present with slowly progressive painless proptosis Mostly its intraconal (>80%) but may also be extraconal. Cavernous hetnangiomas possess a distinct fibrous pseudo capsule and therefore on CT and MR appear well defined masses. Cavernous hemangioma is easily resectable as it is: - well encapsulated - does not have a prominent aerial supply (in contrast to capillary hemangioma) Capillary hemangioma Capillary hemangiomas occur primarily in infants. The tumor often increases in size for 6 to 10 months and then gradually involutes. Mostly extraconal, commonly occur in superior nasal quadrant. Capillary hemangiomas in and around the orbit may have an aerial supply from either the external carotid or internal carotid aeries. These tumors are capable of profuse bleeding. On CT and MR these lesions appear fairly well marginated to poorly marginated. Hemangiopericytomas Hemangiopericytomas are rare, slow growing vascular neoplasms that arise from the pericytes of Zimmermann, which normally envelop capillaries. About 50% cases are malignant. On CT and MR the orbital hemangiopericytoma, in contrast to cavernous hemangioma, appear less distint owing to its tendency to invade the surrounding tissues. Angiography may differentiate the tumors from cavernous hemangioma, meningioma, and schwannoma. - Hemangiopericytomas usually have an early florid blush - Cavernous hemangiomas show late minor pooling of contrast, or often appear as avascular masses - Meningiomas may show multiple tumor vessels and a late blush - Schwannomas may show no tumor blush. Dermoid Dermoid and epidermoids are the most frequent development cysts of the orbit. They result from the inclusion of ectodermal elements during closure of the neural tube. The dermoid contains one or more dermal adnexal structures such as sebaceous glands and hair folliclels.

It is tested by projecting two dissimilar objects (which can be joined or superimposed to form a complete picture) in front of the two eyes. For example, when a picture of a bird is projected onto the right eye and that of a cage onto the left eye, an individual with presence of simultaneous perception will see the bird in the cage. 2. Grade-II - Fusion It consists of the power to superimpose two incomplete but similar images to from one complete image. The ability of the subject to continue to see one complete picture when his eyes are made to converge or diverge a few degrees, gives the positive and negative fusion range, respectively. 3.

        "question": "Which of the following reflects wavelength (nanometers) of Laser used for shaping cornea in refractive surgery:",
        "exp": "A i. e. 193 - Corneal reshaping refractive procedures such as photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser assisted epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK), & laser assisted insitu keratomileusis (LASIK), used to correct refractive errors (myopia and hypermetropia), are ultraviolet-photoablation procedures using Excimer (also k/a argon fluoride/Ar-F- excimer) laser of ultraviolet (193 nm) wave lengthQ. Myopia is treated by ablating the central anterior corneal surface so that it becomes flatter; 10um ablation corrects 1D myopia. Hypermetropia is corrected by ablation of periphery so that the centre becomes steeper. Excimer laser (193 nm) corneal reshaping refractory surgery is of 2 types. In PRK the anterior surface of cornea is ablated by laser, which can correct myopia upto 6D, astigmatism upto 3D and low hypermetropia. The more popular other method is LASIK, in which superficial circular flap of epithelium & stroma is cut with microkeratome (an automated sharp blade), lifting up 120-150 pm thick hinged flap attached on one side. The stromal bed is laser ablated to desired extent ensuring minimal stromal bed thickness of 250 pm (to maintain stability & prevent iatrogenic ectasia). Following this the flap is repositioned without sutures; this can corret hypermetropia upto 4D, astigmatism upto 5D and myopia upto 12D. Modifications to minimize microkeratome related complications include use of 20% alcohol (30-40 seconds) to lift / clear thin epithelial flap (LASEK), use of special microkeratome to cut & separate a thin flap of epithelium & Bowman's layer (Epi - LASIK) and use of femto second laser to pre fashion the anterior flap to a desired size and depth without using a surgical blade Refractive Keratoplasty to modify refractive power of cornea may be done by: (i) radial keratotomy (radial incisions are made in cornea); (ii) arcuate keratotomy (arcuate shaped incisions in steeper or more myopic meridian to reduce astigmatism); (iii) Keratomileusis (tissue resected & modified in shape before replacement) and (iv) epikeratophakia, where donor corneal tissue is attached to the host cornea after removal of epithelium capsulectomy in an eye with a silicone intraocular lens implant is challenging because optical breakdown occurs in silicone at relatively low power, therefore damaging IOL even when the laser is focused posterior to implant. Procedure is even more difficult if capsule is in intimate contact with the implant. Use of corneal contact lens during laser capsulectomy result in steeper convergence & more sharply focused Nd YAG laser beam. - IOL made of PMMA and acrylic are less susceptible to optical breakdown than silicone lenses. Photodisruption (PD) - PD is a mechanical effect produced by highly focused laser (with high electromagnetic field strength), which can actually strip electrons from their nuclei, destroying chemical nature of material producing an entirely different physical state of matter called plasma. - In plasma, the orderly array of molecules is fractured into a random mixture of electron & protons in a process called optical break down, which is basically a miniature lightening bolt or thunderclap. Vapors formed by lightning bolt expands, quickly collapse and produce a miniature thunder clap. Acoustic shock waves produced from thunderclap cause most of the tissue damage. - PD optical breakdown requires electro magnetic fields so powerful they can be produced only by concentrating lasr energy into very brief periods, thereby giving each pulse an extremely high power. Infrared Nd: YAG laser (1064nm) with Q switching or mode locking pulsing is used for PD. Q switching is most commonly used, inexpansive and reliable but cant produce pulses as sho or powerful as mode locking. Whereas, mode locking are expansive and difficult to maintain but more powerful. - Nd: YAG laser is infrared, invisible, so aiming system (a red helium-neon / He-Ne laser) is necessary. However, the patient's eye cause the red aiming beam to bend more than Nd: YAG's infrared laser. Therefore, the focus of both rarely coincide precisely (chromatic aberration). Photodisruption with infrared Nd: YAG laser (1064nm) is used in performing posterior lens capsulectomyQ. Photocoagulation (PC) - In PC, laser light (mostly visible or sometimes infrared) is absorbed by the target tissue or by neighbouring tissue, generating heat that coagulates (denatures) proteins. - It is the most commonly used laser procedure performed during panretinal photocoagulation, argon laser trabeculoplasty, peripheral iridecotomy, and thermal destruction of choroidal neovascular membranes. It is used in treatment of various conditions. Anterior segment PC Posterior segment PC - lridoplasty - Proliferative DR - Iridotomy - Diabetic macular edema - Trabeculoplasty - Choroidal neovascularization - Cyclophoto secondary to age related macular coagulation degeneration - Retinal breaks - Retinal detachments - Types of laser that produce PC include Laser Wave length (nm) Argon Blue- Green 488 Argon-Green 514 Frequency doubled (2x) Nd-YAG (green) 532 Rhodamine 6G Organic tunable Dye laser (Yellow-Red) 570 to 630 Krypton-Red 647 Ruby - Red 694 Diode (near infrared) 810 - Increase in exposure time modestly increases the lesion's diameter and also extends damage deeper into target tissue (eg 10 fold ET doubles diameter). Whereas very brief exposure times (0. 01-0. 05 seconds), allow little time for heat to dissipate from the burn. Therefore a small area of intense burn is produced, resulting in perforation of delicate ocular structures like neural retina & Bruch's membrane. - An increase in power has strong influence on lesion diameter (doubling power doubles size) but creates more damage and can be painful. In most PC lasers, the energy is concentrated in the centre of beam, with less energy at edges. Therefore, use of excessive power during laser treatment of retina may result in inadveent retinal hole. Also the lower energy at periphery may produce permanent tissue damage even though it does not produce a visible reaction. This means the area of laser damage may extend beyond the area of immediately visible reaction. In sensitive areas such as macula, a small spot size (100pm) is preferred so as to minimize unnecessary adjacent damage. In contrast, larger spot size (200-500pm) is preferred for panretinal photocoagulation. - Laser contact lenses also increase spot size Laser contact lens Multiplication factor of increased spot size Goldman three mirror lens 1. 08 Panfundoscopic lens 1. 41 Mainster wide angle lens 1. 47 Quadr Aspheric lens 1. 92 If the spot size is increased, the power needs to be increased. However, because energy is concentrated in centre of beam, it is best to raise power only modestly (no more than two folds at a time) and to test burns to refine the power settings. Photoablation (PA) - PA breaks chemical bonds that hold tissue together, essentially vaporizing the tissue. Chemical bonds are broken by absorption of Photons without any external mechanical pressure. Therefore, the laser is able to remove tissue with more precision and with much less damage to surrounding tissue. - It is most recent light tissue interaction using argon-fluoride (Ar-F) excimer laser producing electro magnetic energy with a wave length of 193 nm (in the extreme ultraviolet). - Photoablation used for shaping cornea in refractive surgery and to treat corneal pathology such as corneal ulcers and scars. - Excimer laser removes --0. 1 mm of corneal tissue with each pulse. Beam shaping optics are used to create even beam profile; however, these are ablated slowly & must be replaced periodically. - Irregularities in corneal stroma, presence of keratinocytes, & variable corneal collagen density (depending on altitude, atmospheric pressure, humidity, age and duration of procedure) may cause uneven ablation even when beam profile is uniform.",

Most of the (85%) uveal melanomas arise in the choroid. So, choroidal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular tumor in adults. Tumor arises from dendritic melanocytes (neural crest, neuroectodermal origin). Histologically choroidal melanoma can be divided into: - Spindle cell melanomas: - These melanomas contain predominantly spindle cells. These melanomas are fuher subdivided into Spindle A or Spindle B depending upon the type of cells. Epitheloid cell melanomas: - Contain epitheloid like cells. Mixed cell melanomas: - Contain both spindle cells and epitheloid cells. Choroidal melanoma presents as a sessile or dome shaped mass located deep to the sensory retina. A secondary non-rheugmatogenous retinal detachment frequently occurs. Involvement of voex vein by tumor results in glaucoma. With continued growth, a choroidal melanoma can rupture Bruch's membane and assume a mushroom shape. When that occurs, tumor has a tendency to bleed, and vitreal or subretinal hemorrhage may occur.",

Treatment is hampered by the organism's ability to encyst within the corneal stroma. Topical biguanides are probably the only effective primary treatment.

He describes the visual loss as a gradual progression from blurry to total blackout over the past two hours. He has no history of prior visual problems. Past medical history is significant for a myocardial infarction three years ago. The patient takes aspirin daily. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination reveals 20/20 vision of the left eye but no vision in the right eye. Extraocular muscles are intact. The neurologic examination is normal. The cardiac examination reveals an S4 heart sound. The most likely cause of this unilateral blindness is which of the following?",
        "exp": "This patient has a sudden onset of complete, unilateral, painless loss of vision with intact extraocular muscle movement. This is consistent with occlusion of the retinal aery. The retina derives its blood supply from the internal carotid aery the ophthalmic aery, from which branch the central retinal aery and ciliary aeries. The central retinal aery supplies the inner layers of retina, while ciliary aeries supply blood to the choriocapillaris and the outer retinal layers. Occlusion of small retinal aerioles produces \"cotton wool\" spots while total occlusion of the ophthalmic aery leads to total ischemia and blindness. This usually occurs secondary to atherosclerotic disease. The key here is recognizing that the loss of vision is an isolated finding with no other neurologic symptoms. Other deficits would be consistent with a stroke of a larger vascular territory such as the internal carotid aery. Carotid aery dissection is less likely than retinal aery occlusion because there would likely be multiple associated neurologic findings in the case of dissection, as the internal carotid aery supplies a large poion of the anterior circulation of the brain. The most likely symptoms among a large cadre of possibilities is face and arm weakness contralateral to the dissection. Cavernous sinus thrombosis would lead to facial pain and possible cranial nerve deficits. The optic nerve (cranial nerve II) extends anteriorly from the optic chiasm through the superior orbital fissure. Posterior cerebral aery occlusion is less likely than retinal aery occlusion because there would likely be multiple associated neurologic findings. Also, the visual field loss resulting from a unilateral posterior cerebral aery occlusion would more likely be a homonymous hemianopia, it would not cause complete blindness in one eye. Other changes that may occur from posterior cerebral aery stroke are complex findings, such as the inability of recognize faces (prosopagnosia), failure to connect visual perception with conscious thought, color vision loss, and difficulty with reading (dyslexia or alexia). Memory problems and motor impairment are also common associated findings.",

Mechanism of action: Heterotrimeric Transducin (alpha-beta-gamma subunits) is activated by a conformational change in rhodopsin due to the absorption of a photon by rhodopsin's active group retinal. Activation causes the GDP bound to the alpha subunit to be exchanged with GTP from solution and results in activated alpha dissociating from beta-gamma. Active Transducin-alpha then causes cyclic GMP Phosphodiesterase to increase its activity, thereby lowering the concentration of c. GMP, an intracellular second-messenger molecule. Decrease in c. GMP concentration leads to the closure of c. GMP-regulated Na+ and Ca2+ ion channels and a hyperpolarized membrane potential. This chain of signaling events is also called \"the veebrate photo transduction cascade\"",

        "exp": "Cavernous sinus thrombosis Repeated pain over medial canthus and chronic use of nasal decongestants suggest chronic ethmoidal sinusitis.

There is sudden onset of? - Chills & rigor Systemic symptoms - Diplopia on lateral gaze --> s/o VI C. N. (abducent) involvement leading to lateral rectus palsy - Proptosis & chemosis b/o venous congestion - Optic disc congestion So, among the given options? Orbital apex syndrome (OAS) can be ruled out as visual loss is often the initial manifestations of an OAS (not seen in this patient). Orbital apex syndrome *Orbital apex syndrome is caused by any etiology (infective, neoplastic, granulomatous inflammation or traumatic) that involves the structures in the orbital apex (posterior orbit). Orbital apex consists of the superior orbital fissure + optic canal. Thus so: Orbital apex syndrome Superior orbital fissure syndrome + optic nerve signs *Superior orbital fissure syndrome is caused by involvement of all extraocular peripheral nerves passing through the superior orbital fissure i. e. III, IV, VI, & VI. *Orbital apex syndrome is characterized by: - Ophthalmoplegia (due to paresis of III, IV, VI, & VI cranial nerves), - Ptosis, - Anaesthesia in the region supplied by ophthalmic division of Vth nerve (decreased corneal sensation and -Early visual loss and afferent papillary defect (caused by optic nerve involvement). The remaining two options; cavernous sinus thrombosis & orbital cellulitis can impose adignostic difficulty. Both of these have almost similar presentation with some differences. Abrupt onset of chills & rigor, mod. proptosis and lateral gaze palsy our cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST). In orbital cellulitis onset is slow & systemic features are mild & there is restricted ocular movement in all directions from the beginning. Optic disc congestion & vision loss in late stages are found both in CST & orbital cellulitis. Differences in CST, Orbital cellulitis & OAS Clinical features CST Orbital Cellulitis OAS Onset Abrupt Slow Slow Systemic features Marked Mild Mild Laterality Initially unilateral, but can become bilateral in more than 50% cases Unilateral Unilateral Proptosis Moderate Marked Mild to moderate Chemosis Moderate Marked Mild Vision Not affected in early stages Not affected in early stages Lost in early stages Ophthalmo- plegia Sequential & complete -4 lateral gaze palsy to sta with, as 6th C.

C: Graves ophthalmopathy Graves ophthalmopathy (dysthyroid eye disease) is the most common cause of unilateral or bilateral proptosis in adults between the ages of 25-50 years Graves' ophthalmopathy/ Thyroid eye disease (TED)/ dysthyroid/thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TAO), Graves' orbitopathy It is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting the orbit around the eye, characterized by upper eyelid retraction, swelling (edema), redness (erythema), conjunctivitis, and bulging eyes (proptosis). It is pa of a systemic process with variable expression in the eyes, thyroid, and skin, caused by autoantibodies that bind to tissues in those organs, and, in general, occurs with hypehyroidism. The most common form of hypehyroidism is Graves' disease. The autoantibodies target the fibroblasts in the eye muscles, and those fibroblasts can differentiate into fat cells (adipocytes). Fat cells and muscles expand and become inflamed. Veins become compressed, and are unable to drain fluid, causing edema. Cigarette smoking, which is associated with many autoimmune diseases, raises the incidence 7. 7-fold. Epidemiology The pathology mostly affects persons of 30 to 50 years of age. Females are four times more likely to develop TAO than males. When males are affected, they tend to have a later onset and a poor prognosis. Pathophysiology In mild disease, patients present with eyelid retraction. In fact, upper eyelid retraction is the most common ocular sign of Graves' orbitopathy. This finding is associated with lid lag on infraduction (Von Graefe's sign), eye globe lag on supraduction (Kocher's sign), a widened palpebral fissure during fixation (Dalrymple's sign) and an incapacity of closing the eyelids completely (lagophthalmos). Due to the proptosis, eyelid retraction and lagophthalmos, the cornea is more prone to dryness and may present with chemosis, punctate epithelial erosions and superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis. The patients also have a dysfunction of the lacrimal gland with a decrease of the quantity and composition of tears produced. In moderate active disease, the signs and symptoms are persistent and increasing and include myopathy. The inflammation and edema of the extraocular muscles lead to gaze abnormalities. The inferior rectus muscle is the most commonly affected muscle and patient may experience veical diplopia on upgaze and limitation of elevation of the eyes due to fibrosis of the muscle. This may also increase the intraocular pressure of the eyes. The double vision is initially intermittent but can gradually become chronic. The medial rectus is the second-most-commonly-affected muscle, but multiple muscles may be affected, in an asymmetric fashion. In more severe and active disease, mass effects and cicatricial changes occur within the orbit. This is manifested by a progressive exophthalmos, a restrictive myopathy that restricts eye movements and an optic neuropathy. With enlargement of the extraocular muscle at the orbital apex, the optic nerve is at risk of compression. The orbital fat or the stretching of the nerve due to increased orbital volume may also lead to optic nerve damage. The patient experiences a loss of visual acuity, visual field defect, afferent pupillary defect, and loss of color vision. Diagnostic Graves' ophthalmopathy is diagnosed clinically by the presenting ocular signs and symptoms, but positive tests for antibodies (anti-thyroglobulin, anti-microsomal and anti-thyrotropin receptor) and abnormalities in thyroid hormones level (T3, T4, and TSH) help in suppoing the diagnosis. Orbital imaging is an interesting tool for the diagnosis of Graves' ophthalmopathy and is useful in monitoring patients for progression of the disease. Ultrasonography may detect early Graves' orbitopathy in patients without clinical orbital findings. It is less reliable than the CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Thus, CT scan or MRI is necessary when optic nerve involvement is suspected. On neuroimaging, the most characteristic findings are thick extraocular muscles with tendon sparing, usually bilateral, and proptosis. Classification of Graves' eye disease Mnemonic: \"NO SPECS\": Class 0: No signs or symptoms Class 1: Only signs (limited to upper lid retraction and stare, with or without lid lag) Class 2: Soft tissue involvement (oedema of conjunctivae and lids, conjunctival injection, etc.) Class 3: Proptosis Class 4: Extraocular muscle involvement (usually with diplopia) Class 5: Corneal involvement (primarily due to lagophthalmos) Class 6: Sight loss (due to optic nerve involvement) Treatment The first step is the regulation of thyroid hormone levels by a physician. Topical lubrication of the ocular surface is used to avoid corneal damage caused by exposure. Tarsorrhaphy is an alternative option when the complications of ocular exposure can't be avoided solely with the drops. Coicosteroids are efficient in reducing orbital inflammation, but the benefits cease after discontinuation. Radiotherapy is an alternative option to reduce acute orbital inflammation. A simple way of reducing inflammation is smoking cessation, as pro-inflammatory substances are found in cigarettes. Surgery may be done to decompress the orbit, to improve the proptosis, and to address the strabismus causing diplopia. Surgery is performed once the patient's disease has been stable for at least six months. Eyelid surgery is the most common surgery performed on Graves ophthalmopathy patients. TAO is an orbital autoimmune disease. The thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSH-R) is an antigen found in orbital fat and connective tissue, and is a target for autoimmune assault. On histological examination, there is an infiltration of the orbital connective tissue by lymphocytes, plasmocytes, and mastocytes. The inflammation results in a deposition of collagen and glycosaminoglycans in the muscles, which leads to subsequent enlargement and fibrosis. There is also an induction of the lipogenesis by fibroblasts and preadipocytes, which causes orbital volume enlargement due to fat deposition. Poor prognostic indicators Age greater than 50 years Rapid onset of symptoms under 3 months Cigarette smoking Diabetes Severe or uncontrolled hypehyroidism Presence of pretibial myxedema High cholesterol levels (hyperlipidemia) Peripheral vascular disease",

C: Paicles in vitreous With age, the normally transparent vitreous gel liquefies and breaks up, leading to the presence of little paicles and fibrous strands floating in the vitreous cavity and casts shadow onto the retina Patient may complain of seeing black dots, rings, strands etc. Vitreous Hemorrhage It is the extravasation of blood into the areas in and around the vitreous humor of the eye. The vitreous humor is the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eye. Causes 1. Diabetic Retinopathy The most common cause found in adults is diabetic retinopathy. Abnormal blood vessels can form in the back of the eye of a person with diabetes. These new blood vessels are weaker and prone to breaking and causing hemorrhage. 2. Trauma Trauma is the leading cause of vitreous hemorrhage in young people, and accounts for 12-18. 8% of cases in adults. 3. Retinal Tear/Detachment A tear in the retina can allow fluids from the eye to leak in behind the retina, which causes retinal detachment. When this occurs, blood from the retinal blood vessels can bleed into the vitreous. 4. Posterior Vitreous Detachment As one gets older, pockets of fluid can develop in the vitreous. When these pockets develop near the back of the eye, the vitreous can pull away from the retina and possibly tear it. 5. Other Causes Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy Macroaneurysm Age-related macular degeneration Terson syndrome Retinal neovascularization as a result of branch or central retinal vein occlusion Symptoms/Diagnosis Blurry vision Floaters- faint cobweb-like apparitions floating through the field of vision Reddish tint to vision Photopsia-brief flashes of light in the peripheral vision Small vitreous hemorrhage often manifests itself as \"floaters\". A moderate case will often result in dark streaks in the vision, while dense vitreous hemorrhage can significantly inhibit vision. Treatments The treatment method used depends on the cause of the hemorrhage. In most cases, the patient is advised to rest with their head elevated 30-45deg and sometimes to put patches over the eyes to limit movement prior to treatment in order to allow the blood to settle. The patient is also advised to avoid taking medications that cause blood thinning (such as aspirin or similar medications). Retinal tears are closed by Laser treatment or cryotherapy, and detached retinas are reattached surgically.

However it may also occur rarely in Euthyroid person, primary hypehyroidism and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thyroid ophthalmopathy is characterized by enlargement of ocular fat and enlargement of extraocular muscles due to deposition of mucopolysaccharides. Clinical features are:- The most common and earliest symptom is upper eyelid retraction. Exophthalmos (Proptosis) Proptosis is the second most common symptom. Thyroid ophthalmopathy is the most common cause of proptosis, whether unilateral or bilateral in adults. Proptosis may be:- Mild exophthalmos:- In hypehyroidis (thyrotoxicosis, Graves disease) Extreme exophthalmos:- In hypothyroidism Restrictive extraocular myopathy:- Enlargement of extraocular muscle without enlargement of tendon is the hallmark of thyroid ophthalmopathy. This distribution of extraocular muscle swelling is typical of thyroid ophthalmopathy. The extraocular muscles involvement in order of decreasing frequency is: Inferior rectus (most commonly involved)> Medial rectus > Superior rectus > Lateral rectus > obliques. It is woh noting that this is restrictive myopathy and the muscle becomes thickened & scarred with detion of eye towards the direction of action of muscle and there is restriction of movement in the direction opposite to the action of the involved muscle, though the opposite muscle is normal. For example in medial rectus involvement eye may be deted medial and abduction will be restricted though the lateral rectus is normal. External ophthalmoplegia:- Thyroid ophthalmopathy can cause veical diplopia due to paralysis of veical acting muscles like inferior oblique.",

        "question": "Treatment of band shaped keratopathy: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. C: EDTA In band shaped keratopathy, improvement of vision may be obtained by dissolving it with the sodium salt of ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (sodium edetate) Band keratopathy It derives its name from the distinctive appearance of calcium deposition in a band across the central cornea. Band keratopathy is the result of precipitation of calcium salts on the corneal surface (directly under the epithelium). Elevated serum calcium or serum phosphate can tip the balance in or of precipitation. Topical medications that contain phosphates also may contribute to this problem. Finally, elevation of the surface pH out of the physiologic range changes the solubility product and ors precipitation. This type of tissue pH change can be seen in chronically inflamed eyes and may explain, in pa, why patients with uveitis are at risk for the development of band keratopathy Presentation Visual acuity will be decreased in propoion with the density of deposition of calcium salts in the central cornea. Slit lamp examination often reveals a whitish-grayish plaquelike deposition that occurs in a band across the cornea. The very periphery of the cornea may be spared because of the buffering effect of limbal blood vessels. Holes in the plaque may be apparent; these holes represent spaces where the corneal nerves are traversing the Bowman membrane to the epithelial surface Features of calcium deposition The calcium deposition typically begins in the periphery and progresses centrally but, occasionally, may begin centrally. The calcium may be very fine or thick and plaquelike. When it is thick, it may flake off, causing epithelial defects and painful symptoms Medical therapy It is ineffective in treating band keratopathy. However, underlying conditions associated with elevated levels of calcium or phosphate should be treated to prevent deposition from recurring (eg, patients on dialysis who subsequently undergo renal transplantation often have a more normal phosphate level). The goals of pharmacotherapy are to reduce plasma calcium levels, to prevent complications, and to reduce morbidity. Edetate calcium disodium Chelates with many divalent and trivalent metals. Because of its affinity for calcium, lowers serum calcium levels during IV infusion. Slow infusion causes mobilization of extracirculatory calcium stores. Also chelates with other polyvalent metals, therefore increasing urinary excretion of magnesium, zinc and other trace elements. Although it does not chelate with potassium, it may reduce the serum potassium level. Do not use for lead toxicity.",

Those in front of that plane (1) will move in the same direction, and those behind, (3, 4, 5) will appear to move in the opposite direction. If 4 is the centre of rotation of the eye and the eye is rotated slightly, all the opacities except 4 will move, the movement being greater when the opacity is faher from the centre of rotation.

        "question": "Which of the following does not result in optic neuritis: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Hypertension Aetiology of optic neuritis includes immune mediated disorders (local-sympathetic ophthalmitis and systemic-sarcoidosis), metabolic disorders-diabetes etc. Optic neuritis It is the inflammation of the optic nerve that may cause a complete or paial loss of vision. Causes The optic nerve comprises axons that emerge from the retina of the eye and carry visual information to the primary visual nuclei, most of which is relayed to the occipital coex of the brain to be processed into vision. Inflammation of the optic nerve causes loss of vision usually because of the swelling and destruction of the myelin sheath covering the optic nerve. The most common etiology is multiple sclerosis. The presence of demyelinating white matter lesions on brain MRI at the time of presentation of optic neuritis is the strongest predictor for developing clinically definite MS. Some other causes of optic neuritis include infection (e. g. Syphilis, Lyme disease, herpes zoster), autoimmune disorders (e. g. lupus), Inflammatory Bowel Disease, drug induced (e. g. chloramphenicol, Ethambutol) vasculitis and diabetes Symptoms Major symptoms are sudden loss of vision (paial or complete), or sudden blurred or \"foggy\" vision, and pain on movement of the affected eye. The vision might also look \"disturbed/blackened\" rather than blurry, like when feeling dizzy. Many patients with optic neuritis may lose some of their color vision in the affected eye (especially red), with colors appearing subtly washed out compared to the other eye. On medical examination the head of the optic nerve can easily be visualised by an ophthalmoscope; however frequently there is no abnormal appearance of the nerve head in optic neuritis (in cases of retrobulbar optic neuritis), though it may be swollen in some patients (anterior papillitis or more extensive optic neuritis). In many cases, only one eye is affected and patients may not be aware of the loss of color vision until the doctor asks them to close or cover the healthy eye. Epidemiology Optic neuritis typically affects young adults ranging from 18-45 years of age, with a mean age of 30-35 years. There is a strong female predominance. Treatment and prognosis In most cases, visual functions return to near normal within eight to ten weeks, but they may also advance to a complete and permanent state of visual loss. Therefore, systemic intravenous treatment with coicosteroids, which may quicken the healing of the optic nerve, is often recommended Very occasionally, if there is concomitant increased intracranial pressure, the sheath around the optic nerve may be cut to decrease the pressure. When optic neuritis is associated with MRI lesions suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) then general immunosuppressive therapy for MS is most often prescribed (IV methylprednisolone may shoen attacks; initial only oral prednisone may increase relapse rate).",

A: Bitemporal hemianopia Bitemporal hemianopia is usually caused by tumours in the region of the sella turcica, pressure by suprasellar aneurysm or by chronic arachnoiditis; these press upon the chiasma, so that the fibres from the nasal halves of each retina are destroyed Bitemporal hemianopsia/ Bitemporal hemianopia It is a type of paial blindness where vision is missing in the outer half of both the right and left visual field. It is usually associated with lesions of the optic chiasm, the area where the optic nerves from the right and left eyes cross near the pituitary gland Causes In bitemporal hemianopsia vision is missing in the outer (temporal or lateral) half of both the right and left visual fields. Information from the temporal visual field falls on the nasal (medial) retina. The nasal retina is responsible for carrying the information along the optic nerve, and crosses to the other side at the optic chiasm. When there is compression at optic chiasm the visual impulse from both nasal retina are affected, leading to inability to view the temporal, or peripheral, vision. This phenomenon is known as bitemporal hemianopsia. Bitemporal hemianopsia most commonly occurs as a result of tumors located at the mid-optic chiasm. Since the adjacent structure is the pituitary gland, some common tumors causing compression are pituitary adenomas, and craniopharyngiomas. Also another relatively common neoplastic etiology is meningiomas. An etiology of vascular origin is an aneurysm of the anterior communicating aery which arise superior to the chiasm, enlarge, and compress it from above.",

Management of uveitic glaucoma In general, the treatment of patients with uveitic glaucoma begins with the control of intraocular inflammation by topical steroids. If successful, in rare cases this treatment may normalize the 10P. Early anti- inflammatory therapy combined with mydriatics and cyloplegic drugs is used to prevent irreversible consequences of uveitis, such as posterior synechiae, peripheral and anterior synechiae However, medical and surgical antiglaucomatous therapy may be needed when the IOP does not respond to anti- inflammatory drugs. Topical 13- blockers are the drugs of choice for the treatment of raised 10P in patients with uveitic glaucoma. Adrenergic agonists like epinephrine or dipivefrin are also widely used. Other adrenergic drug, apraclonidine (a, - agonist) can also be used in acute LOP elevation. Topical or systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be used when 13 - blockers and adrenergic stimulators do not control the IOP or when they are contraindicated. Hyperosmotic agents are rarely used but may be of paicular value when TOP has to be lowered rapidly. When medical therapy fails, surgical treatment (laser iridotomy) should be considered. Among antiglaucoma medications, prostaglandin analogues (eg Latanoprost) should not be used as they breakdown the blood aqueous barrier and may exacerbate cystoid macular edema",

The region between the epithelial monolayer and the nucleus is the coex which is relatively younger and apa from epithelium the most metabolically active region of the lens.

The patient may describe a shade dropping in front of the eye or describe vision like looking through ground glass. If a thrombus propagates up the carotid to the middle cerebral aery, then symptoms seen in middle cerebral aery occlusion or embolization (hemiparesis with sensory symptoms, aphasia depending on hemispheric dominance) will also occur. Midbasilar aery disease produces weakness and sensory loss with diplopia, loss of facial sensation or movement, and ataxia. Branches of the basilar aery supply the base of the pons and superior cerebellum. The symptoms described suggest disease in the posterior circulation, whichincludes paired veebral aeries, the basilar aery, and the paired posterior cerebral aeries. The basilar aery divides into two posterior cerebral aeries that provide branches to the cerebellum, medulla, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and temporal and occipital lobes. A midbasilar aery occlusion could cause ataxia of limbs by involving pontine nuclei; paralysis of the face, arm, and leg by involving coicospinal tracts; and impairment of facial sensation by involvement of fifth nerve nucleus. Occlusion of the entire middle cerebral aery results in contralateral hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, and homonymous hemianopsia. When the dominant hemisphere is involved, aphasia is present. When the nondominant hemisphere is involved, apraxia and neglect are produced. When only a penetrating branch of the middle cerebral aery is affected, the syndrome of pure motor hemiplegia is produced, as the infarct involves only the posterior limb of the internal capsule, involving only motor fibers to the face, arm, and leg (lacunar infarct).",
