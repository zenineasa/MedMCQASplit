The term rhegmatogenous is derived from the Greek word rhegma, which means a discontinuity or a break. A rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) occurs when a tear in the retina leads to fluid accumulation with a separation of the neurosensory retina from the underlying RPE; this is the most common type of retinal detachment. Types of Retinal detachments Type. Definition. Causes1. Rhegmatogenous. Full thickness defect or hole in the retina with subretinal Fluid accumulation# Trauma (blunt)# Spontaneous# Myopia (high)# ICCE# Aphakia/Pseudophakia# Age-related retinoschisis# Vitreoretinal tufts and Meridional folds# Family history of RD2. Traction detachment. Caused by scar tissue pulling on the retina# Proliferative diabetic retinopathy# ROP# Sickle cell retinopathy [\"sea-fan\" retina)# Penetrating posterior segment trauma3.

Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome: similar to Bardet-Biedl syndrome. In addition to Bardet Biedl syndrome has paraplegia. Usher's syndrome: RP & labyrinthine deafness. Bassen-Kornzweig disease (Abetalipoproteinemia): RP, fat malabsorption, spinocerebellar degeneration, and acanthocytosis. Kearns-Sayer syndrome: Mitochondrial myopathy characterized by external ophthalmoplegia, lid ptosis, cardiac conduction block & mild RP. Cockayne's syndrome: RP, progressive infantile deafness, dwarfism, mental retardation, nystagmus & ataxia. Refsum's syndrome: RP, peripheral neuropathy, cerebellar ataxia. (This is an autosomal recessive hypertrophic neuropathy caused by defective oxidation of phytanic acid, a branched-chain fatty acid found in dairy products, beef, lamb, and fish. The onset is in late childhood or adolescence, with a slowly progressive course of a sensorimotor demyelinating neuropathy with sensorineural deafness, cerebellar ataxia, and anosmia. Retinitis pigmentosa presenting as night blindness often precedes the onset of neuropathy). Hallgren fs syndrome: RP, vestibulo-cerebellar ataxia, congenital deafness & mental deficiency. Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis: is a devastating condition that involves progressive neurological failure, mental deterioration, seizures, and retinitis pigmentosa. It results from excessive accumulation of lip pigments (lipofuscin) in the body's tissues. Olivopontocerebellar degeneration.

Involvement is bilateral in 1-2%, with the exception of temporal arteritis and other systemic vasculitides.# Clinical features- Patients present with sudden painless loss of vision.- Usually unilateral.- Direct pupillary light reflex is absent.- Retinal arteries are markedly narrowed.- Central part of mascular area shows 'cherry-red' spot due to vascular choroid shining through thin retina.- Segmented blood column within retinal veins ('cattle- track' appearance) is pathognomonic of central retinal artery occlusion.- The arteries are thin and the segmented blood flow in the retinal arteries can be observed in acute stages of the disease.# Diagnosis- Diagnosis is made clinically.- The diagnosis can be confirmed by fluorescence angiography.# Differential diagnosis- Differentiation between arteritic (Horton disease) and nonarteritic CRAO is very important because in Horton disease the fellow eye can become involved within a few days without appropriate treatment.# Treatment- There is no consensus currently about the efficacy of different forms of treatment.- Conservative treatment: globe massage, anterior chamber paracentesis, infusion treatment with pentoxifylline, hyperbaric oxygen, intravenous r. TPA, or corticosteroid injection.- Invasive treatment: selective catheterization of the ophthalmic artery with administration of fibrinolytic drugs.# Prognosis.- The visual acuity on first presentation generally decides the prognosis.- Spontaneous improvements are observed in up to 15%.

Clinical diagnostic features indicative of Retinitis Pigmentosa include a substantially small and progressively decreasing visual area in the visual field test, and compromised levels of clarity measured during the visual acuity testo Additionally, optical tomography such as fundus and retinal (optical coherence) imagery provide further diagnostic tools when determining an RP diagnosis. Photographing the back of the dilated eye allows the confirmation of bone spicule accumulation in the fundus, which presents during the later stages of RP retinal degenerationo While visual field and acuity test results combined with retinal imagery support the diagnosis of Retinitis Pigmentosa, additional testing is necessary to confirm other pathological features of this disease.

Mid-peripheral ring scotoma (annular scotoma) because the maximum density of rods occurs in mid-periphery. Ultimately central vision is also lost after many years. Cone-rod type: - Cones are degenerated early. As cones are responsible for vision in bright light, colour vision and central vision, the symptoms of this type of retinitis pigmentosa are reduction in central acuity, colour vision defect and defective vision in bright light. At least some peripheral vision is retained till very late.",

        "question": "Retinopathy of prematurity- true is -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Most cases resolve spontaneouslyo Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a disease that affects immature retinal vasculature of premature babies. The retinal manifestations of this disease are noted some weeks after birth in premature infants who have been given high concentration of O2 and is usually confined to those with a birth weight of under 1. 5 kg and/or a gestational age of 32 weeks. ROM can be mild with no visual defects or it may become aggressive with neovascularization and progress to retinal detachment and blindness. All babies weighing less than 1500 gm at birth or having a gestation period of less than 32 weeks should be screened with indirect ophthalmoscopy for ROM, between 32 and 36 weeks post conceptiono Important risk factors for ROM are: -# Primary: - Prematurity: Gestation age < 32 weeks (most important); Birth weight <1. 5 kg; Oxygen therapy: Excessie oxygen use.# Other:- Sepsis, multiple blood transfusions, apnoeic spells, metabolic acidosis, use of aminophylline & antibioticso Important signs of ROM are: - i) Leukocoria (white pupil); ii) Nystagmus (abnormal eye movements); iii) Strabismus (crossed eye); iv) Severe nearsightedness (myopia). Classification of ROP: o ROP is described using a number of parameters. These are location of the disease into zones (1, 2, and 3), the circumferential extent of the disease based on the clock hours (1-12), the severity of the disease (stage 1-5) and the presence or absence of \"Plus disease\". 1) Classification on the basis of severity, ROP is divided into 5 stages# Stage I - the first sign of ROP (stage 1) is the appearance of a thin, fiat, white structure (termed a demarcation line) at the junction of vascularized retina posteriorly and avascular retina anteriorly.# Stage II - the demarcation line develops into a pink or white elevation (ridge) of thickened tissue.# Stage III - proliferation of vessels over the ridge and into vitreous (extravitreal fibrovascular proliferation).# Stage IV - partial retinal detachment. IVa - partial detachment with macular sparing. IVb - partial detachment with macula involved# Stage V - total retinal detachment2) Classification on basis of anatomical location# Since there is a direct correlation between severity of disease and amount of avascular retina, the location of the border between vascularized and avascular retina is an important prognostic sign.# 3 zones are divided to describe the location of ROP. Location of the border in zone 1 is the most severe disease and in zone 3 least. i) Zone 1 is defined as a circle, the center of which is the disc, and the radius of which is twice the distance of the disc to the fovea. ii) Zone 2 is a doughnut-shaped region that extends from the anterior border of zone 1 to within one disc- diameter of the ora serrata nasally and to the anatomic equator temporally. iii) Zone 3 encompasses the residual temporal retina. o Plus disease As ROP progresses, more and more shunting occurs in the neovascular tissue at the retinal vascular- avascular junction. This increased retinal vascular blood flow results in dilation and tortuosity of the major retinal arteries and veins in the posterior pole - described as \"plus disease\". Plus disease is the hallmark of rapidly progressive ROP and is notated by adding a plus sign after the number of the ROP stage. Management:-Most of the cases (approx. 80%) of ROP resolve spontaneously, hence intervention is chosen according to the below given protocol. ROP is divided into threshold and prethreshold disease. o Threshold disease: It is defined as stage 3+ ROP in zones 1 or 2 occupying at least five contiguous clock-hours or eight noncontiguous clock-hours of retina. Treatment of threshold disease is - Laser photocoagulation. o Prethreshold disease is divided into 2 types: High risk or Type I - treatment is Laser photocoagulation. Low risk or Type II - treatment is Weekly or twice weekly observation",
