The term rhegmatogenous is derived from the Greek word rhegma, which means a discontinuity or a break. A rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) occurs when a tear in the retina leads to fluid accumulation with a separation of the neurosensory retina from the underlying RPE; this is the most common type of retinal detachment. Types of Retinal detachments Type. Definition. Causes1. Rhegmatogenous. Full thickness defect or hole in the retina with subretinal Fluid accumulation# Trauma (blunt)# Spontaneous# Myopia (high)# ICCE# Aphakia/Pseudophakia# Age-related retinoschisis# Vitreoretinal tufts and Meridional folds# Family history of RD2. Traction detachment. Caused by scar tissue pulling on the retina# Proliferative diabetic retinopathy# ROP# Sickle cell retinopathy [\"sea-fan\" retina)# Penetrating posterior segment trauma3. Exudative (serous) detachment. As a result of inflammatory diseases or sometimes hypertension# Choroidal tumor# Exophytic retinoblastoma# Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome# Posterior scleritis# Infectious (syphilis, TB, CMV, Toxoplasmosis)# Subretinal vascularisation# Collagen vascular diseases# Coats disease# Central serous chorioretinopathy# Uveal effusion syndrome# Renal diseases# Severe hypertension/ eclampsia/ preeclampsia.

Involvement is bilateral in 1-2%, with the exception of temporal arteritis and other systemic vasculitides.# Clinical features- Patients present with sudden painless loss of vision.- Usually unilateral.- Direct pupillary light reflex is absent.- Retinal arteries are markedly narrowed.- Central part of mascular area shows 'cherry-red' spot due to vascular choroid shining through thin retina.- Segmented blood column within retinal veins ('cattle- track' appearance) is pathognomonic of central retinal artery occlusion.- The arteries are thin and the segmented blood flow in the retinal arteries can be observed in acute stages of the disease.# Diagnosis- Diagnosis is made clinically.- The diagnosis can be confirmed by fluorescence angiography.# Differential diagnosis- Differentiation between arteritic (Horton disease) and nonarteritic CRAO is very important because in Horton disease the fellow eye can become involved within a few days without appropriate treatment.# Treatment- There is no consensus currently about the efficacy of different forms of treatment.- Conservative treatment: globe massage, anterior chamber paracentesis, infusion treatment with pentoxifylline, hyperbaric oxygen, intravenous r. TPA, or corticosteroid injection.- Invasive treatment: selective catheterization of the ophthalmic artery with administration of fibrinolytic drugs.# Prognosis.- The visual acuity on first presentation generally decides the prognosis.- Spontaneous improvements are observed in up to 15%.

It may occur in a variety of vascular, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases involving the retina, RPE and choroid in which fluid leaks outside the vessels and accumulates under the retina. As long as the RPE is able to compensate by pumping the leaking fluid into the choroidal cir-culation, RD does not occur. However, when the mechanism is overwhelmed or functions subnormally, fluid accumulates in the subretinal space. Sign in exudative RD: The detached retina is very mobile and exhibits the phenomenon of 'shifting fluid' in which SRF detaches the area of retina under which it accumulates. For example, in the upright position the SRF collects under the inferior retina, but on assuming the supine position for several minutes, the inferior retina flattens and SRF shifts posteriorly, detaching the superior retina. Demarcation lines are present in long standing retinal detachmemts. Tobacco dusting is a sign of rhegmatogenous retinal detachmemt. Fixed folds are seen in tractional retinal detachmemt.",
