Berger's space: centre of hyalocapsoid ligament or weiger's ligament. Cloquet's canal: During the tenth week of development in humans (time varies depending on species), the lens grows independent of a blood supply and the hyaloid artery usually regresses. Its proximal portion remains as the central artery of the retina. Regression of the hyaloid artery leaves a clear central zone through the vitreous humor, called the hyaloid canal or Cloquet's canal. Area of martergiani: posterior area of cloquet's canal which is seen as weiss ring. Mittendorf's dot: An anterior remnant of the hyaloid artery can be seen in some people as Mittendorf s dot, a small pinpoint-like scar on the posterior surface of the lens.

        "exp": "ANSWER: (C) 3. DREF: Oxford American Handbook of Ophthalmology By James Tsai Pg 7, Ophthalmology at a glance by J. Olver Ch 8. The pinhole (stenopeic slit upto 1. 2 mm) can neutralize upto 3 Dioptres of refractive error. It is a useful method of finding out if the patient is suffering from refractive errors. If the vision improves with a pinhole test, it means that the patient has a refractive error. See the diagram below: In emmetropia every point in an object of regard is brought to point focus on the retina and the sum of all the points yields a clear image, i. e. point-to-point correspondence. If there is a refractive error present, a blur circle is formed on the retina, which is dependent on the size of their pupil (smaller pupil = smaller blur circle). When a pinhole aperture is placed in front of the eye, it acts as an artificial small pupil and the size of the blur circle is abolished/reduced, producing a clearer image",

        "question": "Medial rectus is inserted on the medial aspect of sclera at what distance from sclerocorneal junction?",
        "exp": "Ans. A. 5. 5 mm. Medial Rectus: The medial rectus is the largest of the ocular muscles and stronger than the lateral.# Origin- The medial rectus muscle arises from the annulus of Zinn. It has a wide origin to the medial side of and below the optic foramen from both parts of the common tendon, and from the sheath of the optic nerve.# Insertion - The medial rectus inserts medially, in the horizontal meridian about 5. 5 mm from the limbus.# Blood supply - The medial rectus is supplied by the inferior muscular branch of ophthalmic artery and 2 anterior ciliary arteries.# Size - The medial rectus muscle is 40. 8 mm long; tendon is 3. 7 mm long and 10. 3 mm wide.# Innervation- The inferior division of the 3rd nerve innervates the medial rectus on its lateral surface at about the junction of its middle and posterior thirds.# Action. - The medial rectus is a pure adductor. Inferior Rectus: The inferior rectus is the shortest of the recti muscles.# Origin-It arises below the optic foramen, from the middle slip of the lower common tendon of the annulus of Zinn at the apex of the orbit.# Insertion- inserted inferiorly, in vertical meridian about 6. 5 mm from the limbus. The inferior rectus is also attached to the lower lid by means of the fascial expansion of its sheath.# Blood supply - the inferior muscular branch of ophthalmic artery and infraorbital artery, 2 anterior ciliary vessels# Size - 40 mm long; tendon is 5. 5 mm long and 9. 8 mm wide# Innervation- The inferior rectus is supplied by the inferior division of the 3rd nerve, which enters it on its upper aspect at about the junction of the middle and posterior thirds.# Actions - The inferior rectus makes the eye look downwards or medially or wheel-rotates it laterally (extorsion). By means of its fascial expansion it also depresses the lower lid. The principal action is depression which increases as the eye is turned out and is nil when the eye is adducted. The inferior rectus is the only depressor in the abducted position of the eye. Lateral Rectus:# Origin - arises from the annulus of Zinn and spans the superior orbital fissure.# Insertion - inserted laterally, in horizontal meridian 6. 9 mm from the limbus# Blood supply - the lacrimal artery (the only rectus muscle with a single blood supply)# Size - 40. 6 mm long; tendon is 8 mm long and 9. 2 mm wide# Relations- The structures which go through the two heads of the lateral rectus, within the cone of muscles or within the annulus of Zinn, have been referred to as the oculomotor foramen.# Innervation- The 6th nerve (abducens) enters it on its medial aspect, just behind its middle.# Actions- The lateral rectus is a pure abductor - that is, makes the eye look directly laterally in the horizontal plane. Superior Rectus:# Origin - The superior rectus arises from the upper part of the annulus of Zinn above and to the lateral side of the optic foramen and from the sheath of the optic nerve. This origin lies below that of the levator, and is continuous on the medial side with the medial rectus and on the lateral with the lateral rectus.# Insertion - inserted superiorly, in vertical meridian 7. 7 mm from limbus# Blood supply - Superior muscular branch of ophthalmic artery and 2 anterior ciliary a.# Size - 41. 8 mm long; tendon is 5. 8 mm long and 10. 6 mm wide# Innervation - The superior rectus is supplied by the superior division of the oculomotor (3rd cranial), which enters the under-surface of the muscle at the junction of the middle and posterior thirds.# Actions - The superior rectus makes the eye look upwards or medially or wheel-rotates it medially (intorts). It also helps the levator to lift the upper lid. Superior Oblique: The superior oblique is the longest and thinnest eye muscle.# Origin - arises above and medial to the optic foramen by a narrow tendon which partially overlaps the origin of the levator. The origin is just outside the medial rectus and blends with the periosteum of the sphenoid bone.# Insertion - inserted to trochlea at orbital rim, then inferior and under superior rectus posterior to center of rotation# Blood supply - the superior muscular branch of ophthalmic artery supply blood# Size - 40 mm long; tendon is 20 mm long and 10. 8 mm wide# Actions - The superior oblique moves the eye downwards or laterally or (wheel-) rotates it inwards (i. e. makes twelve o'clock on the cornea move towards the nose).- The principal is the depression, and this increases as the eye is adducted. The superior oblique is the only muscle which can depress in the adducted position. Its action is practically nil when the eye is abducted.- The abduction and intorsion are the subsidiary actions, and increase as the eye turns out.- The superior oblique acts with the inferior rectus to make the eye look directly down. The abductor component of the action of the oblique muscles is due to their being inserted behind the equator of the globe.# Innervation - The superior oblique is supplied by the 4th or trochlear nerve which, having divided into three or four branches, enters the muscle on the upper-surface near its lateral border; the most anterior branch at the junction of the posterior and middle thirds, the most posterior about 8 mm. from its origin.# Blood-supply comes from the superior muscular branch of the ophthalmic artery. Inferior Oblique:# Origin - The inferior oblique is the only extrinsic muscle to take origin from the front of the orbit; arises from a rounded tendon in a depression on orbital floor near orbital rim (maxilla), just behind the orbital margin and lateral to orifice of the naso-lacrimal duct. Some of its fibres may, in fact, arise from the fascia covering the lacrimal sac.# Insertion - inserted posterior inferior temporal quadrant at level of macula# Blood supply - the inferior branch of ophthalmic artery and infraorbital artery# Size - 37 mm long; the shortest tendon of insertion ( essentially no tendon) and it is 9. 6 mm wide at insertion.# Innervation- the inferior division of the oculomotor nerve, crosses above the posterior border to enter the muscle on its upper-surface at about the middle of the muscle.# Blood-supply comes from the infraorbital artery and the inferior muscular branch of the ophthalmic a.# Actions- The inferior oblique makes the eye look upwards or laterally or wheel-rotates it laterally (extorts). The principal action is the elevation which increases as the eye is turned in and is nil in abduction. The inferior oblique is the only elevator in the adducted position. Levator Palpebrae Superioris Muscle:# striated muscle to elevate the eyelid.# The levator palpebrae superioris arises from the under-surface of the lesser wing of the sphenoid above and in front of the optic foramen by a short tendon which is blended with the underlying origin of the superior rectus.# The flat ribbon-like muscle belly (about 40 mm in length) passes forwards below the roof of the orbit and on the superior rectus to about 1 cm. behind the orbital septum (at the upper fornix or a few millimeters in front of the equator of the eye), where it ends in a membranous expansion or aponeurosis. From the equator forward about 10-15 mm of levator tendon spreads out in a fan-shaped manner, so as to occupy the whole breadth of the orbit and thus gives the whole muscle the rough form of an isosceles triangle.# Attachments. - (a) The main insertion of the levator is to the skin of the upper lid at and below the upper palpebral sulcus. It reaches this by intercalating with the fibres of the orbicularis.# (b) To the Tarsal Plate. - Some of the fibres of the aponeurosis are attached to the front and lower part of the tarsal plate, but the main attachment of the levator here is via the smooth superior palpebral muscle of Muller. This is continuous with the fleshy part of the levator, and is attached to the upper border of the tarsus.# Innervation- The Superior Division of the 3rd, which reaches the muscle either by piercing the medial edge of the superior rectus.# Action. - The levator raises the upper eyelid, thus uncovering the cornea and a portion of the sclera, and deepens the superior palpebral fold. Its antagonist is the palpebral portion of the orbicularis. Muller's muscle-The superior palpebral muscle is a smooth muscle that acts a an eyelid elevator.# Origin- arises from the inferior or bulbar aspect of the levator palpebrae behind the fornix.# Insertion-upper edge of the tarsal plate, between the levator and conjunctiva.# Action- eyelid elevator# Size- 15-20 mm at its origin, 10 mm in vertical length, slightly sider at its insertion# Relations-lies between the tendon of the levator and the conjunctiva in the eyelid# Innervation- sympathetic fibers",

These postganglionic fibers are part of cranial nerve V (Nasociliary nerve of the trigeminal)o Presynaptic parasympathetic signals that originate in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus are carried by cranial nerve III (theoculomotor nerve) and travel through the ciliary ganglion. Parasympathetic activation of the M3 muscarinic receptors causes ciliary muscle contraction, the effect of contraction is to decrease the diameter of the ring of ciliary muscle. The zonule fibers relax and the lens becomes more spherical, increasing its power to refract light for near vision. o The parasympathetic tone is dominant when a higher degree of accommodation of the lens is required, such as reading a book",

The points in favour of the above answer are --Of all the above options, carbonic anhydrase is the only enzyme which catalyzes the reversible reaction: CO2+H2O =H2 CO3. Kanski writes - \"Aqueous humor is actively secreted by the non pigmented epithelium as a result of a metabolic process that depends on several enzyme systems, specially the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, which secretes Na+ ions into the posterior chamber. Water follows passively along the osmotic gradient. Carbonic anhydrase also plays a role, but the precise mechanism is uncertain. \"Parson writes - \"Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors block the action of carbonic anhydrase and reduce the production of aqueous in the eye. \"",

INDOCYANINE GREEN ANGIOGRAPHYThe principal use for fluorescein angiography in age-related macular degeneration is in locating subretinal choroidal neovascularization for possible laser photocoagulation. The angiogram may showr a well-demarcated neovascular membrane. Frequently, however, the area of choroidal neovascularization is poorly defined (\"occult\") because of surrounding or overlying blood, exudate, or serous fluid. Indocyanine green angiography is a separate technique that is superior for imaging the choroidal circulation. Fluorescein diffuses out of the choriocapillaris, creating a diffuse background fluorescence. As opposed to fluorescein, indocyanine green is a larger molecule that binds completely to plasma proteins, causing it to remain in the choroidal vessels. Thus, larger choroidal vessels can be imaged. Unique photochemical properties allow the dye to be transmitted better through melanin (eg, in the retinal pigment epithelium), blood, exudate, and serous fluid. This technique therefore serves as an important adjunct to fluorescein angiography for imaging occult choroidal neovascularization and other choroidal vascular abnormalities. Following dye injection, angiography is performed using special digital video cameras. The digital images can be further enhanced and analyzed by computer.",
