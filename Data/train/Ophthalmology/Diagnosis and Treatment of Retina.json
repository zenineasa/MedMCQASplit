Early findings include mottling of the RPE and blunted foveal reflex. As the retinopathy progresses, a bull's-eye maculopathy develops, as seen in this image. In addition to the bull's-eye maculopathy, patients can demonstrate paracentral scotomas on visual field testing and parafoveal outer retinal atrophy on OCT.
