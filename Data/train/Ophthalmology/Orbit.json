The most common cause is a sloughing corneal ulcer which perforates and heals with the formation of pseudocornea by the organization of exudates and laying down of fibrous tissue. It is lined internally by iris. Intercalary staphyloma: - It occurs at the limbus. It is lined internally by the root of iris and the anterior most portion of the ciliary body. The causes are perforating injuries to limbus, marginal corneal ulcer; anterior scleritis, Scleromalacia perforans, Complicated cataract surgery, secondary angle closure glaucoma. Ciliary staphyloma: - This affects the ciliary zone that includes the region upto 8 mm behind the limbus. The ciliary body is incarcerated in the region of scleral ectasia. Causes are Developmental glaucoma, Primary or secondary glaucoma end stage, scleritis, trauma to ciliary region. Equatorial staphyloma: - This occurs at the equatorial region of the eye with incarceration of the choroid. Causes are scleritis, degenerative myopia and chronic uncontrolled glaucoma.

The fracture usually involves the floor of the orbit, along the thin bone covering the infra orbital canal. Two types: Pure Blow Out fracture does not involve the orbital rim or the other bones. Impure Form involves other bones. Symptoms: Diplopia - due to the entrapment of muscle into the fracture, intraorbital hemorrhage or injury to the muscle itself. Double Diplopia - Diplopia in both upgaze & downgaze due to entrapment of both Inferior rectus (Depression) & inferior oblique (Elevation). Periocular ecchymosis & edema. Enophthalmos.

Management: Conserv ative management with antibiotics & anti inflammatory drugs. Orbital floor repair with bone graft, silicone plate within 2 weeks.
