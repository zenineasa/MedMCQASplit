OP)o Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases causing optic nerve damage i. e., glaucoma is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy caused by a group of ocular conditions which lead to damage of optic nerveo Optic neuropathy in glaucoma results in a characteristic appearance of optic disc and a specific pattern of irreversible visual field defects, called glaucomatous changes. It is worth noting that raised IOP without optic neuropathy is not referred to as glaucoma, it is simply called ocular hypertension. So, glaucoma is a type of optic neuropathy, which is usually caused by increased IOP.",

Grade-1-Simultaneous perceptiony It is the power to see two dissimilar objects stimultaneously. It is tested by projecting two dissimilar objects (which can be joined or superimposed to form a complete picture) in front of the two eyes. For example, when a picture of a bird is projected onto the right eye and that of a cage onto the left eye, an individual with presence of simultaneous perception will see the bird in the cage. 2 Grade-11 - Fusion. It consists of the power to superimpose two incomplete but similar images to from one complete image. The ability of the subject to continue to see one complete picture when his eyes are made to converge or diverge a few degrees, gives the positive and negative fusion range, respectively. 3. Grade-Ill - Stereopsis. It consists of the ability to perceive the third dimension (depth perception). It can be tested with stereopsis slides in synoptophore.",
