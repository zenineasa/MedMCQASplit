However, intially drugs are used to decrease IOP during an acute attack. Approach of treatment is as follow's:-Start i.v. mannitol or i.v. acetazolamideWhen IOT starts falling, start topical pilocarpine or p-blocker (timolol).Apraclonidine/latanoprost may be added.Once IOT is reduced, surgery' is done.o Topical pilocarpine 2% is the preferred antiglaucomatous drugo After control of IOP, Laser (Nd : YAG) peripheral irodotomy is the definitive management of choice. If laser is not available surgical peripheral iridectomy is the procedure of choice. Other surgical procedures used are fiIteration surgeries (like trabeculectomy , deep sclerotomy, Viscoanulostomy).o Symptomatic treatment during an attack also includes analgesics, antiemetic and topical corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Mydriatics (e.g. atropine) are contraindicated as they precipitate glaucomao PACG is a bilateral disease, the fellow eye is at risk of developing an acute attack in 50% cases in future. Therefore a prophylactic peripheral laser iridotomy should be performed in the fellow eye.",
