The cornea (especially anterior surface) is the most important refractive surface of eye. The refractive power of cornea depend on two factors (i) Refractive index of cornea (Directly related), (ii) Radius of curvature (inversly related), o Second important refractive structure of eye is lens with refractive index 1. 386 - 1. 406. Center (nucleus) of lens has maximum refractive index (1. 46) amongst all the refractive structures of eye. o Third important factor determining the refractive power of eye is the axial length of eyeball. 1mm change in axial length leads to change of 3D in refractive power. For example, 1 mm shortening in axial length causes hypermetropia of 3D and 1mm lengthening causes myopia of 3D. Refractive index. Medium. Air. Cornea. Aqueous humour. Lens. Vitreous humor.

Inversely to focal length Optical powero Optical power (also referred to as dioptric power, refractive power, focusing power, or convergence power) is the degree to which a lens, mirror, or other optical system converges or diverges light. It is equal to the reciprocal of the focal length of the device: P = 1/f. High optical power corresponds to short focal length. The SI unit for optical power is the inverse metre (m 1), which is commonly called the dioptreo Converging lenses have positive optical power, while diverging lenses have negative power.
