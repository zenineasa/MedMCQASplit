        "question": "What is irregular astigmatism-",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Non perpendicular principal meridians ASTIGMATISMo Astigmatism is a type of refractive error wherein the refraction varies in the different meridia. Consequently, the rays of light entering in the eye cannot converge to a point focus but form focal lines. The refractive error of the astigmatic eye stems from a difference in degree of curvature refraction of the two different meridians (i.e.,, the eye has different focal point in different planes). For example, the image may be clearly focused on retina in the horizontal plane, but not in the vertical plane.o The most common cause of astigmatism is abnormality of corneal curvature. Other less common causes are lenticular (curvature abnormality of lens,oblique position of lens) and retinal (oblique placement of macula). Types of astigmatismBased on axis of the principal meridiansRegular stigmatism : Principal meridians are perpendicularo With-the-rule astigmatism-the vertical meridian is steepest.o Against-the-rule astigmatism-the horizontal meridian is steepest.o Oblique astigmatism-the steepest curve lies in between 120 and 150 degrees and 30 and 60 degrees.Irregular astigmatism - principal meridians are not perpendicular.Based on focus of the principal meridiansSimple astigmatismo Simple hyperopic astigmatism - first focal line is on retina while the second is located behind the retinao Simple myopic astigmatism - first focal line is in front of the retina while the second is on the retina.Compound astigmatismo Compound hyperopic astigmatism-both focal lines are located behind the retina,o Compound myopic astigmatism-both focal lines are located in front of the retina.Mixed astigmatism-focal lines are on both sides of the retina (straddling the retina).Treatment of Astigmatismo Treatment of astigmatism consists : -Optical treatment: - It consists of cylindrical power spectacles or contact lens. Types of contact lenses used are permeable contact tens, Soft toric contact lens (for high degree astigmatism), hybrid lens, i.e,, soft on hard lens, hard contact lens.Surgical treatment: - Non-laser (astigmatic keratotomy) or laser (PRK, LASIK).",

Refraction with near add (Ref: style=\"font-size: 1.04761904761905em; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif; margin: 0 0 0 8px; text-indent: 0\">A 59-year-old male presents with dimness of near vision. On examination, the media was clear in both the eyes. For diminuation of vision this age. one should think for cataract; but in this case, media (cornea/aqueos/lens/vitreous) is clear, so cataract is ruled out. As there is dimness of near only; the next most likely cause would be presbyopia. The treatment for presbyopia is refraction and near addition.PresbyopiaThe term presebyopia means \"oldie\" and is a vision condition involving the loss of the eye's ability to focus on close objectsQ.Presbyopia is a condition that occurs as a part of normal ageing and is not considered to be an eye diseaseQ.Symptoms are usually noticeable by age 40-45 and continue to develop until the process stabilizes some 10-20 years later.Causes:As individuals age, the lens becomes less flexible and elastic, and the muscles become less powerfulQ.Because these changes result in inadequate adjustment of the lens of the eye for various distances, objects that are close will appear blurry.Major cause: Loss of elasticity of the lens of the eyeQ.Loss of ciliary muscle power, however, is also believed to contribute to the problemQ.Symptoms:Individuals typically have difficulty in reading small print, and may need to hold reading materials at arm's lengthQ.Symptoms include headache and eyestrain when doing close work, blurry vision, and eye fatigueQ.Symptoms may be worse early in the morning or when individuals are fatigued.Dim lighting may also aggravate the problemQ.Diagnosis:Diagnosed during an eye examination conducted by eye specialists, such as optometrists or ophthalmologists.Part of the examination will assess vision while reading by using various strength lenses.Treatment:Presbyopia cannot be cured, but individuals can compensate for it by wearing reading, bifocal, or trifocal eye glassesQ.A convex lensQ is used to make up for the lost automatic focusing power of the eye.Half-glasses can be worn, which leave the top open and uncorrected for distance vision.In addition to glasses, contact lenses have also been found to be useful in the treatment of presbyopia.",

The cornea (especially anterior surface) is the most important refractive surface of eye. The refractive power of cornea depend on two factors (i) Refractive index of cornea (Directly related), (ii) Radius of curvature (inversly related),o Second important refractive structure of eye is lens with refractive index 1.386 - 1.406. Center (nucleus) of lens has maximum refractive index (1.46) amongst all the refractive structures of eye.o Third important factor determining the refractive power of eye is the axial length of eyeball. 1mm change in axial length leads to change of 3D in refractive power.
