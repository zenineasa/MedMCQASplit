        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e. Vitamin B Nutritional optic atrophyo The exact mechanism by which nutritional deficits damage the optic nerve has not been elucidated. Although the etiology is likely multifactorial, most clinicians agree that in patients who abuse ethanol and tobacco, malnourish- ment is often present and undemutrition, rather than direct toxicity, is the principal cause of the visual loss. Specific deficiencies of vitamin B-12 (cyanocobalamin), thiamine (vitamin B-1), other B-complex vitamins (riboflavin, niacin, and pyridoxine), and folic acid, as well as reduced systemic levels of other proteins with sulfur-containing amino acids, may play a role. Causes of optic atrophyo Compressive - secondary to papilledema, tumor, bony growth (fibrous dysplasia, osteopetrosis), thyroid eye disease, chiasmal (pituitary etc), optic nerve sheath meningioma, disc drusen, increased intraocular pressure (glaucoma)o Vascular - arteritic and non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy, diabeteso Inflammatory - sarcoid, systemic lupus, Behcet's, demyelination (MS), etc. o Infectious - viral, bacterial, fungal infections - herpes, TB, bartonella, etc. o Toxic & nutritional - many medications such as ethambutol, amiodarone, methanol, vitamin deficiency etc. o Metabolic - diabeteso Neoplastic - lymphoma, leukemia, tumor, gliomao Genetic - Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (OPA1), Leber's hereditary optic atrophy, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, as a late complication of retinal degneration. o Radiation optic neuropathyo Traumatic optic neuropathy",

This palsy presents as deviation of the eye to a 'down and out'position due to loss of innervations to all ocular motility muscles except for the lateral rectus (innervated by CN 6th) and superior oblique (innervated by CN 4th)o These symptoms occur in order because the parasympathetic fibres surround the motor fibres of CN 3 and hence compressed first.",

However, a few rare optic nerve gliomas arise from oligodendrocytes. 70% of optic gliomas occur during first decade of life. Optic nerve gliomas are associated with Neurofibromatosis-1 (Von Recklinghausen's disease) in 55% of cases. 75% of optic gliomas arise from optic chiasma and adjacent optic nerve. 25% are confined to optic nerve alone (orbital optic nerve glioma). o Patients present with some degree of unilateral visual dysfunction, visual field loss, afferent pupillary defect, decreased ocular motility, optic atrophy, pain headache and nystagmus. Proptosis is often the chief complaint of an orbital glioma. Nystagmus may also occur. Other late features of optic nerve glioma are neovascular glaucoma, anterior segment ischemia and hemorrhagic glaucoma from retinal vascular occlusiono In chiasmal gliomas there may be visual field defects, raised ICT, papilloedema and endocrine abnormalities like diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism, dwarfism and precocious puberty.",
