Thus, eyeball is depressed and elevation is not possible. Thyroid ophthalmopathy Thyroid ophthalmopathy, also called thyroid orbitopathy, is a disease of the orbit seen in Graves disease (thyrotoxicosis), therefore also called Graves ophthalmopathy. However it may also occur rarely in Euthyroid person, primary hypehyroidism and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thyroid ophthalmopathy is characterized by enlargement of ocular fat and enlargement of extraocular muscles(PG'\") due to deposition of mucopolysaccharides. Clinical features are:- The most common and earliest symptom is upper eyelid retraction. Exophthalmos (Proptosis) Proptosis is the second most common symptom. Thyroid ophthalmopathy is the most common cause of proptosis, whether unilateral or bilateral in adults. Proptosis may be:- i) Mild exophthalmos:- In hypehyroidis (thyrotoxicosis, Graves disease) Extreme exophthalmos:- In hypothyroidism' Restrictive extraocular myopathy:- Enlargement of extraocular muscle without enlargement of tendon is the hallmark of thyroid ophthalmopathy. This distribution of extraocular muscle swelling is typical of thyroid ophthalmopathy. The extraocular muscles involvement in order of decreasing frequency is: Inferior rectus (most commonly involved)> Medial rectus > Superior rectus< Lateral rectus< obliques. It is woh noting that this is restrictive myopathy and the muscle becomes thickened & scarred with detion of eye towards the direction of action of muscle and there is restriction of movement in the direction opposite to the action of the involved muscle, though the opposite muscle is normal. For example in medial rectus involvement eye may be deted medial and abduction will be restricted though the lateral rectus is normal External ophthalmoplegia:- Thyroid ophthalmopathy can cause veical diplopia due to paralysis of veical acting muscles like inferior oblique.",

Steroid induced glaucoma Steroid induced glaucoma characteristically presents as chronic open angle glaucoma, with an open angle normal appearing anterior chamber and absence of symptoms (eg. halos, pain)Q. Halos are due to accumulation of fluid in the corneal epithelium and to alterations in the refractive condition of corneal lamellae. The colours are distributed as in normal spectrum, red on the outside, blue the innermost. Coicosteroid induced glaucoma generally occurs in white, painless eyes with an open normal looking angle, optic disc cupping, visual field defects, elevated IOP, & decreased outflow facility. Patients are usually asymptomatic but an acute presentation can occur if IOP is very high, when corneal oedema, blurred vision, ciliary hyperaemia, coloured halos and pain may occur. (but rare) Pigmentary glaucoma is a secondary open angle glaucoma due to pigment release is young male myopes who present with intermittent halos, an open angle, Krukenberg spindle of pigment (on corneal endothelium on slit lamp microscopy) and sampaolesi line on genioscopy (increased pigmentation in trabecular meshwork). Epidemic dropsy glaucoma (Bengal glaucoma) presents with diarrhoea, edema of legs, myocarditis. Coloured halos are marked & persistent. In Phakomorphic glaucoma the lens becomes intuinescentQ, either by rapid development of cataract or after traumatic rupture of its capsule. The swollen lens obliterates the angle by forcing root of iris against cornea. Phacolytic glaucoma is secondary open angle glaucoma that develops if the lens has been damaged or if lens proteins from a hypermature senile cataract escapes into aqueous. Phacotopic glaucoma develops in anterior subluxation or dislocations of lens especially if the iris becomes firmly contracted over the posterior surface of lens.",

Therefore the two main predisposing factors for bacterial corneal ulcer are: - Damage to corneal epithelium Infection of the eroded area However, there are a few species that are capable of penetrating an intact epithelium: - Neisseria gonorrhoea Neisseria meningitidis Corynebacterium diphtheriae Listeria species Haemophilus agyptus Bacteria which cause corneal ulcer (Purulent keratitis) after epithelial injuries are: - Pseudomonas Pneumococcus Streptococcus epidermidis Staphylococcus aureus Morexella Enterobacterias Proteus, Klebsiella) Although there are specific presentations depending on the bacteria involved, there exists a series of symptoms and signs common to all that allow for a rapid diagnosis, and therefore early treatment of corneal ulcers.

Clinical Features: Episodic unilateral mild anterior uveitis, photophobia, reduced vision and colored rings around lights (from secondary corneal edema)Q. Symptoms of an acute attack of PSS may include unilateral blurred vision and pain. Clinical exam reveals mild anterior chamber reaction and small to medium sized non- granulomatous keratic precipitatesQ There may also be associated corneal edema, which resolves with lowering of the 10P. Intraocular pressure elevation is usually as high as 40-60 mm.

Panuveitis is commonly caused by VKH syndrome, sympathetic ophthalmia, sarcoidosis, syphilis, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, toxocariasisQ and endophthalmitis. Ocular Toxoplasmosis Ocular toxoplasmosis presents with necrotizing chorio-retinitis (destroying choroid & retina producing punched out heavily pigmented macular scar), satellite lesion (solitary inflammatory focus near old pigmented scar), spill over anterior uveitis (may be granular resembling Fuchs syndrome) and severe vitritis (so dense as to prohibit an adequate view of posterior segment i. e. head light in fog appearance). It usually presents in infants or adults between ages of 10-and 35 years. Bilateral macular involvement is common (in immune compromised). - Diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis is often made by clinical features alone. Active toxoplasmosis typically manifests localized necrotizing retinitis. The classical lesion is a grey white focus of retinal necrosis at the edge of pre existing pigmented chorioretinal scar. The entire thickness of choroid and retina is destroyed in a necrotizing inflammation so that a punched out heavily pigmented scar remains (often misdiagnosed White dot syndromes are caused by inflammation at the level of choriocapillaries resulting in non perfusion as congenital coloboma). In infants it is frequently a/w acute illness, convulsions, meningeal changes, hydrocephalus, calcification in brain and mental retardation.

It presents with mild vitritis, numerous tiny deep ill defined grey white dots at posterior pole and mid periphery. The blind spot is enlarged. The macula is spared but has a characteristic granular orange appearance which renders the foveal reflex abnormal or absent( 2. Over several weeks central vision recovers, dots fade. Fovea granularity may remain and enlarged blind spot may take much longer to diminish in size. Multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis is usually bilateral, recurrent / chronic, frequently asymmetrical disease that predominantly affects myopic females in their 3rd -4th decade with blurring of central vision, floater and photopsia. It presents with vitritis (universal), anterior uveitis (50%), and active lesions (bilateral, multiple, discrete, ovoid, yellowish grey) involving the posterior pole & periphery and arranged in clumps or linear streaks (Schlagel lines). Inactive lesions have sharp punched out margins and pigmented borders. Mild disc edema, disc enlargement and peripapillary fibrosis simulating napkin holder may develop.",

Fungal corneal ulcers require intensive application of topical anti-fungal agents. Viral corneal ulceration caused by herpes virus may respond to antivirals like topical acyclovir ointment instilled at least five times a day. Alongside, suppoive therapy like pain medications are given, including topical cycloplegics like atropine or homatropine to dilate the pupil and thereby stop spasms of the ciliary muscle. All forced expiration like blowing the nose, coughing etc. must be avoided. Proper nutrition, including protein intake and Vitamin C are usually advised. In cases of Keratomalacia, where the corneal ulceration is due to a deficiency of Vitamin A, supplementation of the Vitamin A by oral or intramuscular route is given. Drugs that are usually contraindicated in corneal ulcer are topical coicosteroids and anesthetics - these should not be used on any type of corneal ulcer because they prevent healing, may lead to superinfection with fungi and other bacteria Fuher option is the use of a tissue adhesive such as N-butyl 2-ethyl cyanoacrylate monomer which is applied to the area of perforation after careful debridement. Drying of the adhesive may take few minutes after which anterior chamber may reform. Following this, a continuous-wear soft contact lens can be applied or a definite surgical procedure such as therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty or conjunctival flap undeaken. Superficial ulcers may heal in less than a week.",

Light entering one eye produces a constriction of the pupil of that eye (the direct response), as well as a constriction of the pupil of the unstimulated eye (the consensual response). Comparing these two responses in both eyes is helpful in locating a lesion Normally, both pupils should constrict with light shone into either eye alone. On testing each reflex for each eye, several patterns are possible. Optic nerve damage on one side: - The ipsilateral direct reflex is lost (Example: when the left eye is stimulated, neither pupil constricts, as no signals reach the brain from the left eye due to its damaged optic nerve)",

Extraocular muscle and subconjunctival tissue are the two most common sites of extraocular cysticercosis. Extraocular muscle cysticercosis is the commonest form of orbital cysticercosis and patients presents with a red eye, restricted ocular motility and or proptosis. Patients develop decreased ocular motility in the direction of action of the involved muscle and a restriction of opposite movement. In the eye intraocular posterior segment such as vitreous and subretinal space are commonly affected. CT scan done in patients with orbital cysticercosis shows a cystic lesion near or within an extraocular muscle. An intraocular mass or cyst may be present.

B: Uncrossed diplopia The abducens nerve/ abducent nerve/sixth cranial nerve/sixth nerve /VI is a \"somatic efferent\" nerve that controls the movement of a single muscle, the lateral rectus muscle of the eye. Complete interruption of the peripheral sixth nerve causes diplopia (double vision), due to the unopposed action of the medial rectus muscle. The affected eye is pulled medially. In order to see without double vision, patients will rotate their heads so that both eyes are looking sideways. On formal testing, the affected eye cannot abduct past the midline - it cannot look sideways, toward the temple. Paial damage to the sixth nerve causes weak or incomplete abduction of the affected eye. The diplopia is worse on attempted lateral gaze, as would be expected (since the lateral gaze muscle is impaired). Isolated sixth nerve palsies in children are assumed to be due to brain tumors until proven otherwise. The most common overall cause of sixth nerve impairment is diabetic neuropathy.

There is detachment of neurosensory retina (layers of rods and cones) with or without retinal pigment epithelium detachment. The condition affects males between 20-40 years of age. Patient presents with a sudden onset of painless loss of vision associated with relative positive scotoma, micropsia and metamorphosia. Ophthalmoscopic findings include mild elevation of macular area demarcated by a circular ring reflex and foveal reflex is distoed or absent. The diagnosis is confirmed by fluorescein angiography. It shows focal leakage of fluorescein in following two patterns:? Ink-blot pattern or enlarging dot sign:- A small hyperfluorescent spot which gradually increases in size.

        "exp": "Proteins in the lens are unusually long lived and are thus subject to extensive and accumulated oxidative damage. The damaged proteins accumulate, aggregate, and precipitate; causing the lens to loose its transparency. Of critical impoance is the decrease in the Na+/K+ ATPase, resulting in the inability to maintain steady concentrations of Na+, K+, and Ca++within the lens. The decreased activity of this enzyme is thought to be associated with oxidative damage to the sulfhydryl poions of the molecule, usually protected by the interaction of several antioxidants, especially glutathione (GSH), ascorbate, superoxide, dismutase (SOD), and catalase. Like the processes leading to ARMD, senile cataracts are the result of years of damage and accumulated oxidation. Several reviews are available that discuss the relationship between cataracts and oxidative damage. Antioxidants in the eye Ascorbate (Vitamin C) Catalase Superoxide dysmutase (SOD) Glutathione (GSH) d-alpha-tocoferol (Vit E) Lipoic acid Microelements required: Zn, Cu and Mn Carotene Ubiquinone Ginko biloba extract is known to be anti-oxidant. Free radicals are highly reactive molecular species with an unpaired electron. They can react with, and modify, proteins, nucleic acids and fatty acids in cell membranes and plasma lipoproteins. Radical damage to lipids and proteins in plasma lipoproteins is a factor in the development of atherosclerosis and coronary aery disease; radical damage to nucleic acids may induce heritable mutations and cancer; radical damage to proteins may lead to the development of autoimmune diseases.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Subjective refining Subjective refraction Subjective refraction is meant for finding out the most suitable lenses to be prescribed. The proper subjective refraction includes three steps. 1). Subjective verification of refraction It is done by `trial and-error 'methods. In this one eye is occluded and the appropriate lens combination (as indicated by retinoscopy or refractometry) is placed in front of the other eye. By increasing or decreasing the power of lens, the most suitable spherical lens is chosen. The strongest convex lens and the weakest concave lens providing best vision should be chosen in patients with hypermetropia and myopia respectively. 2). Subjective refining of refraction The most suitable combination of lenses chosen after the subjective verification of refraction is refined before final prescription is made. It is always better to first refine the cylinder and then sphere. A) Refining the cylinder: - Cylinder can be refined by either crosscylinder or by astigmatic fan test. Jackson's crosscylinder test (more commonly used) Crosscylinder is used to verify the strength and axis of the cylinder prescribed. The cross cylinder is a mixed combination of various strengths in which spherical component is one half the power of the cylindrical and of opposite sign to with the axis at right angles. The most convenient form is a combination of a -0. 5 D sphere with a +1. 0 D cylinder which has an effective strength of + 0. 5 D cylinder in one meridian and - 0. 5 D cylinder in the meridian perpendicular to the first. The cross-cylinder is identified by the strength of its cylinderical component. So, above described cross cylinder is referred as + 0. 5 crosscylinder. Thus, cross cylinder has following feature: - It has one spherical and one cylinderical lens. This combination creates two cylinders of equal strength but with opposite sign placed with their axes at right angle to each other. Astigmatic fan test: - It is used to confirm the cylindrical correction. B) Refining the sphere: - After refining the cylindrical power and axis, the spherical correction is refined by: - The fogging technique, Duochrome test, Pin-hole test. 3). Subjective binocular balancing The final step in the subjective refraction is binocular balancing, i. e., 'equalization of vision ' or 'equalizing the accommodative effo'. This allows both eyes to have the retinal image simultaneous in focus.",

        "exp": "C i. e. Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis Periostitis It is rare inflammation of periosteum mostly affecting orbital margin. Mostly d/t trauma, TB, syphilis or extension of inflammation from neightbouring tissue. Deep orbit involvement causes less definite signs. There may be pain of deep seated nature, proptosis with detion of direction of eye If apex of orbit is involved (orbital apex syndrome) various ocular motor palsies may develop with trigeminal anaesthesia & neuralgia and occasionly amaurosis d/t involvement of optic nerveQ. Orbital Cellulitis (OC) It is a purulent inflammation of cellular tissue of orbit. It is most common d/t extension of inflammation from neighbouring tissue esp nasal sinuses (mc. ethmoid). Other less common causes are penetrating injuries (esp with retained foreign body with in 72 hours), septic operations, posterior extension of suppurative infections of eyelids or eyeball eg panopthalmitis, facial erysipelas, or dacrocystitis, metastases in pyaemia Preseptal orbital cellulites involves structures anterior to orbital septum i. e. largely lids and presents as a swelling of lids, with erythema, chemosis and conjunctival discharge. But there is no proptosis, or restriction of ocular movements or visual function. However, orbital cellulites term is reserved for infections behind the orbital septum which may or may not spill over to lids. Bacterial OC is more common in children and fulminant infection (& ischemic infarction) with Mucor or Aspergillus typically affects patients with diabetes (esp ketoacidosis) and immunosuppression. Presentation is Extensive swelling of lids with chemosis often obscure proptosis (i. e. most commonly lateral & downwards). Proptosis with impaired mobility resulting in diplopia Pain is severe, increased by movement of eye or pressure Unilateral, tender, warm & red periorbital edema. Painful opthalmoplegia Rapid onset of severe malaise, fever, pain Vision may be impaired owing to retrobulbar optic neuritis or compression of otic nerve or its blood supply at the apex of orbit Fundus is difficult to examine; it may be normal or show engorgement of veins and optic neuritis developing later into optic atrophy. Orbit abscess usually pointing, towards skin of lid near orbital margin or conjunctival fornix is rare in sinus related but common in post traumatic or post operative cases. Panopthalmitis may supervene & there is grave danger of Meningitis, cerebral symptoms and cavernous sinus thrombosis, (CST). CST should be suspected when there is evidence of bilateral involvement, rapidly progressive proptosis, and congestion of facial, conjunctival and retinal veins. Additional features include abrupt progression of clinical signs a/w prostration, severe headache, nausea and vomittingQ. Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis Infection may occur obital veins, as in septic lesions of face, orbital cellulites, erysipelas, and infective conditions of mouth, pharynx, ear, nose and accessory sinuses, or as a metastasis in infectious diseases or septic condition. The patient presents with almost same features as in orbital cellulites, but with systemic symptoms such as fever, rigors, vomiting, headache, altered sensorium and severe cerebral symptomsQ. Another impoant diagnostic feature is transference of symptoms to the fellow eye 0, which occurs in 50% of cases where as bilateral orbital cellulitis is very rare. The first sign of other eye involvement is often paralysis of the opposite lateral rectus Q & this should be carefully watched for in any suspicious case of inflammatory unilateral proptosis. These is severe supra orbital pain d/t involvement of ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve, and paresis of ocular motor nerves. In later stages pupil is dilated, eye immobilized and cornea anesthetic. Proptosis occurs in almost all cases, but is of late onset in cases of otic origin. Retinal veins may be greathy engorged and when this occurs it is usually accompanied by pronounced disc swelling (both indicating extensive implication of orbital veins) Bilateral (but more pronounced on the side of aural lesion), typical papilledema is most common in otitic cases & indicate meningitis or cerebral abscess Simultaneous bilateral CST, with proptosis and disc swelling, occurs in disease of sphenoid sinuses. Edema in the mastoid region behind the ear (d/t thrombosis of emissary vein) confirms the diagnosis.

Many pyogenic organisms (Staphylococcus, streptococci, gonococci, Moraxella) and fungi may produce hypopyon but by far the most dangerous are pseudomonas pyogenea and pneumococcus. Thus, any corneal ulcer may be associated with hypopyon, however, it is customary to reserve the term 'hypopyon corneal ulcer' for the characteristic ulcer caused by pneumococcus and the term 'corneal ulcer with hypopyon' for the ulcers associated with hypopyon due to other causes. The characteristic hypopyon corneal ulcer caused by pneumococcus is called \"ulcus serpens\". It is woh noting that the hypopyon in bacterial causes is sterile since the outpouring of polymorphonuclear cells is due to toxin and not due to actual invasion by bacteria. On the other hand, hypopyon in fungal (mycotic) corneal ulcer is non-sterile as there is direct invasion by fungi.",

In central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), glaucoma manifests about 100 days after thrombosis of central vein, therefore, it is also called 100 days glaucoma.

        "question": "Which is the most common early feature of diabetic retinopathy: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Dot and blot hemorrhages Ophthalmoscopically, the earliest change of background diabetic retinopathy characteristically affects the smaller blood vessels. Small dot and blot haemorrhages are common Diabetic retinopathy It is retinopathy (damage to the retina) caused by complications of diabetes mellitus, which can eventually lead to blindness. It is an ocular manifestation of systemic disease which affects up to 80% of all patients who have had diabetes for 10 years or more. Signs and symptoms Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. As new blood vessels form at the back of the eye as a pa of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), they can bleed (ocular hemorrhage) and blur vision. In most cases, it will leave just a few specks of blood, or spots, floating in a person's visual field, though the spots often go away after a few hours. On funduscopic exam, one see cotton wool spots, flame hemorrhages (similar lesions are also caused by the alpha-toxin of Clostridium novyi), and dot-blot hemorrhages. Elevation of blood-glucose levels can also cause edema (swelling) of the crystalline lens (hyperphacosorbitomyopicosis) as a result of sorbitol (sugar alcohol) accumulating in the lens. This edema often causes temporary myopia (nearsightedness). A common sign of hyperphacosorbitomyopicosis is blurring of distance vision while near vision remains adequate. Pathogenesis Diabetic retinopathy is the result of microvascular retinal changes. Hyperglycemia-induced intramural pericyte death and thickening of the basement membrane lead to incompetence of the vascular walls. These damages change the formation of the blood-retinal barrier and also make the retinal blood vessels become more permeable. During the initial stage, called nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), most people do not notice any change in their vision. Early changes that are reversible and do not threaten central vision are sometimes termed simplex retinopathy or background retinopathy. Some people develop macular edema. It occurs when the damaged blood vessels leak fluid and lipids onto the macula. The fluid makes the macula swell, which blurs vision. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) (or PDRP) As the disease progresses, severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy enters an advanced, or proliferative, stage when blood vessels proliferate (i. e. grow). The lack of oxygen in the retina causes fragile, new, blood vessels to grow along the retina and in the clear, gel-like vitreous humour that fills the inside of the eye. Without timely treatment, these new blood vessels can bleed, cloud vision, and destroy the retina. Fibrovascular proliferation can also cause tractional retinal detachment. The new blood vessels can also grow into the angle of the anterior chamber of the eye and cause neovascular glaucoma. Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy shows up as cotton wool spots, or microvascular abnormalities or as superficial retinal hemorrhages. Risk factors All people with diabetes mellitus are at risk - those with Type I diabetes (juvenile onset) and those with Type II diabetes (adult onset). The longer a person has diabetes, the higher the risk of developing some ocular problem. People with Down's syndrome, who have three copies of chromosome 21, almost never acquire diabetic retinopathy. This protection appears to be due to the elevated levels of endostatin, an anti-angiogenic protein, derived from collagen XVIII. The collagen XVIII gene is located on chromosome 21. Management There are three major treatments for diabetic retinopathy, which are very effective in reducing vision loss from this disease. These three treatments are laser surgery, injection of triamcinolone into the eye, and vitrectomy. Although these treatments are very successful (in slowing or stopping fuher vision loss), they do not cure diabetic retinopathy. Laser photocoagulation It is widely used for early stages of proliferative retinopathy. Panretinal photocoagulation Panretinal photocoagulation, or PRP (also called scatter laser treatment), is used to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The goal is to create 1, 600 - 2, 000 burns in the retina with the hope of reducing the retina's oxygen demand, and hence the possibility of ischemia. Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide Triamcinolone is a long acting steroid preparation. When injected in the vitreous cavity, it decreases the macular edema (thickening of the retina at the macula) caused due to diabetic maculopathy, and results in an increase in visual acuity. The effect of triamcinolone is transient, lasting up to three months, which necessitates repeated injections for maintaining the beneficial effect. Complications of intravitreal injection of triamcinolone include cataract, steroid-induced glaucoma and endophthalmitis. Vitrectomy Instead of laser surgery, some people require a vitrectomy to restore vision. A vitrectomy is performed when there is a lot of blood in the vitreous. It involves removing the cloudy vitreous and replacing it with a saline solution.",

They are associated withindexmyopia\" -- Ophthalmic study guide Causes of errors of refraction Possible causes of ametropia are:? 1) Axial It is the commonest form of ametropia (both myopia and hypermetropia). In hypermetropia, there is an axial shoening of eyeball. So, image is formed behind the retina. In myopia, there is an axial lengthening of eyeball. So, image is formed in front of the retina. 1 mm change in axial length leads to ametropia of 3D. For example 1 mm shoening in axial length causes hypermetropia of 3D. 2) Curvature Change in the curvature of cornea or lens will cause ametropia. In hypermetropia, the curvature of cornea or lens is lesser than normal. In myopia, there is increase in curvature of cornea or lens./ mm change in corneal curvature leads to 6-7 D ametropia. 3) Index If refractive index of optical system is low, it will result in hypermetropia and high refractive index will result in myopia. 4) Positional (Due to relative position of the lens), A forward shift of lens causes myopia, backward shift result in hypermetropia. Absence of lens (aphakia) causes hypermetropia. 5) Excessive accommodation Excessive accommodation due to spasm of accommodation causes myopia.",

        "exp": "Cataracts are lens opacifications. It is not known whether senile cataracts represent disease or normal opacification with age. Cataracts may occur as a consequence of diabetes mellitus, long-term steroids, or congenital infections. They are successfully treated at present with lens extractions and implantation of prosthetic lenses. Note: Aqueous humor is continually replaced due to active secretion by the ciliary body. As such, it does not undergo opacification; it is in constant flux. Corneal opacification is generally a consequence of squamous metaplasia, in which the transparent, non-keratinized, squamous cells are replaced by opaque, keratinized, squamous cells. Squamous metaplasia is a reparative process, usually due to friction injury to the cornea or vitamin A deficiency. The optic nerve is not transparent, and it does not undergo opacification injury. It may, however, atrophy due to ischemic, traumatic, infective, or metabolic insults. Ref: Harper R. A., Shock J. P. (2011). Chapter 8. Lens. In P. Riordan-Eva, E. T.

B: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum Angioid streaks/Knapp streaks/Knapp striae are small breaks in Bruch's membrane, an elastic tissue containing membrane of the retina that can become calcified and crack. Hermann Jakob Knapp called them \"angioid streaks\" because of their resemblance to blood vessels. It is believed that its pathology may be a combination of elastic degeneration of Bruch's membrane, iron deposition in elastic fibers from hemolysis with secondary mineralization, and impaired nutrition due to stasis and small vessel occlusion. Angioid streaks are often associated with: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) Paget's disease Sickle cell anemia Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome These streaks can have a negative impact on vision due to choroidal neovascularization or choroidal rupture. Also, vision can be impaired if the streaks progress to the fovea and damage the retinal pigment epithelium",

As the lens continues to take up water it may swell and become an intumescent cataract, still later it forms a total white opacity called mature cataract and finally become Hypermature cataract. The proteins leak out leaving behind a shrunken -Posterior subcapsular cataract - Patients develop a greater decrease in near vision than distant vision. Phacolytic glaucoma is associated with a damaged lens/if lens protein from a hypermature cataract escape into the aqueous.

Fusarium The points in our of fungal (Fusarium) corneal ulcer include history of trauma to eye with vegetative matter, mild symptoms with greater signs, feathery /fluffy margins, hyphate ulcer, satellite lesions, yellow line/ring of Wesseley and thick, immobile, big pseudohypopyon. It is more common in rural /agricultural areas of developing tropical countries. Keratomycosis/ Fungal (Mycotic) Corneal Ulcer Etiology Filamentous septate hyphae (tubular projections) producing multicellular fungi, most notably, Fusarium and Aspergillus (fumigatus) are the most common causative organism in tropics (or hot climate) and around the word - Unicellular budding yeast eg Candida is most common cause of fungal keratitis in temprate (cold) regions. Predisposing Factors - Injury by vegetative materials or animal tail are common modes of infectionQ. - Antibiotics disturb the symbiosis between bacteria & fungi; and the steroids make fungi facultative pathogens by decreasing local immunity. Therefore excessive use of these drugs result in fungal infections. Corneal trauma often tril, involving plant matter or gardening / agricultural tool (in tropics); corneal disease, local immunosuppression, long term use of topical steroid, prior corneal transplantation, contact lens wear, systemic immune suppression and diabetes (in temperate zones). Clinical Features - Symptoms are much tnilder than the clinical signs would suggestQ -. There is marked ciliary, & conjunctival congestion but symptoms of pain, watering and photophobia are dispropoionately less (as compared to those with bacterial corneal ulcer) - Presents with a gradual onset of pain, grittiness, photo phobia, blurred vision and watery or mucopurulent discharge. - The ulcer is dry-lookingQ, grayish white with elevated rolled out margins and feathery finger like extensionsQ into surrounding stroma under intact epithelium. - A sterile immune ring (yellow line of Wesseley)Q present where fungal antigen and host antibody meet. - Multiple small satellite lesions Q may be present around ulcer (feathery /fluffy margins with satellite lesions) - A big hypopyon is present even if the ulcer is very small. Unlike bacterial ulcer the hypopym may not be sterile (pseudohypopyon) Q as fungi can penetrate into anterior chamber without perforation. Hypopyon is thick and immobile d/t direct invasion and enmeshing of fungal hyphae. Perforation is rare & corneal vascularization is conspicuously absent. Q Diagnosis Examination of wet KOH Q calcofluor white, for fungal hyphae and culture on Sabouraud's agent. Treatment - Topical antifungal eg. natamycin, Amphotericin B drops. - Oral agents are used in severe ulcer and there is suspicion of endopthalmitis.",

So fixed, dilated pupil d/t atropine (pharmacological blockade) can be differentiated with confidence from an innervation palsy by its tendency to resist the miotic effects of cholinergic drops such as pilocarpine. RAPD (Marcus Gunn pupil) is most characteristic of lesions in ipsilateral optic nerve. And when light is moved from normal to affected eye (while performing swinging flash light-test) in RAPD, there is dilation of both pupilsQ.

Possible side effects include difficulty breathing, slowed pulse, hair loss, lower blood pressure, impotence, fatigue, weakness, depression and memory loss. Alpha-agonists. These reduce the production of aqueous humor and increase drainage. Examples include apraclonidine and brimonidine. Possible side effects include fatigue; dizziness; red, itchy or swollen eyes; dry mouth; and allergic reactions. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. These also reduce the production of aqueous humor. Examples include dorzolamide and brinzolamide. Frequent urination and a tingling sensation in the fingers and toes are possible side effects, occurring more often with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors than with anhydrase inhibitor eyedrops. Prostaglandin-like compounds. These eyedrops increase the outflow of aqueous humor. Examples include latanoprost, bimatoprost and travoprost. Possible side effects include mild reddening and stinging of the eyes and darkening of the iris, changes in the pigment of the eyelid skin, and blurred vision from swelling of the retina. Miotic or cholinergic agents. These also increase the outflow of aqueous humor. Examples include pilocarpine and carbachol. Possible side effects are pain around or inside the eyes, brow ache, blurred or dim vision, nearsightedness, allergic reactions, a stuffy nose, sweating, increased salivation, and occasional digestive problems. Epinephrine compounds. These compounds, such as dipivefrin, also increase the outflow of aqueous humor. Possible side effects include red eyes, allergic reactions, palpitations, increased blood pressure, headache and anxiety Prednisone is very effective for treating inflammations and immune-related ocular diseases.

        "exp": "Ans. B: Superior palpebral conjunctiva In trachoma, a characteristic white conjunctival scar (Arlt line) is usually formed at the junction between the lower third and upper two-third of the superior tarsus Trachoma/ Granular conjunctivitis/ Egyptian ophthalmia It is an infectious disease causing a characteristic roughening of the inner surface of the eyelids. It is the leading cause of infectious blindness in the world. Trachoma is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis It is spread by direct contact with eye, nose, and throat secretions from affected individuals, or contact with fomites (inanimate objects that carry infectious agents, such as blankets and pillowcases), such as towels and/or washcloths, that have had similar contact with these secretions. Untreated, repeated trachoma infections result in entropion -- a painful form of permanent blindness when the eyelids turn inward, causing the eyelashes to scratch the cornea. Children are the most susceptible to infection due to their tendency to easily get diy The bacterium has an incubation period of 5 to 12 days, after which the affected individual experiences symptoms of conjunctivitis, or irritation similar to \"pink eye. \" Blinding endemic trachoma results from multiple episodes of reinfection that maintains the intense inflammation in the conjunctiva. The conjunctival inflammation is called \"active trachoma\" and usually is seen in children, especially pre-school children. It is characterized by white lumps in the undersurface of the upper eyelid (conjunctival follicles or lymphoid germinal centres) and by non-specific inflammation and thickening often associated with papillae. Follicles may also appear at the junction of the cornea and the sclera (limbal follicles). Active trachoma will often be irritating and have a watery discharge. Bacterial secondary infection may occur and cause a purulent discharge. The later structural changes of trachoma are referred to as \"cicatricial trachoma\". These include scarring in the eyelid (tarsal conjunctiva) that leads to distoion of the eyelid with buckling of the lid (tarsus) so the lashes rub on the eye (trichiasis). These lashes will lead to corneal opacities and scarring and then to blindness. Linear scar present in the Sulcus subtarsalis is called Ar. It's line (named after Carl Ferdinand von Arlt). In addition, blood vessels and scar tissue can invade the upper cornea (pannus). Resolved limbal follicles may leave small gaps in pannus (Herbe's Pits). The major complication or the most impoant one is corneal ulcer occurring due to rubbing by concentrations, or trichiasis with superimposed bacterial infection Grading of trachoma Mc. Callan's classification-Mc. Callan in 1908 divided the clinical course of trachoma into 4 stages WHO classification-The World Health Organization recommends a simplified grading system for trachoma. The Simplified WHO Grading System is summarized below (FISTO): Trachomatous inflammation, follicular (TF) - Five or more follicles of >0. 5 mm on the upper tarsal conjunctiva Trachomatous inflammation, intense (TI) - Papillary hyperophy and inflammatory thickening of the upper tarsal conjunctiva obscuring more than half the deep tarsal vessels Trachomatous scarring (TS) - Presence of scarring in tarsal conjunctiva. Trachomatous trichiasis (TT) - At least one ingrown eyelash touching the globe, or evidence of epilation (eyelash removal) Corneal opacity (CO) - Corneal opacity blurring pa of the pupil margin SAFE strategy National governments in collaboration with numerous non-profit organizations implement trachoma control programs using the WHO-recommended SAFE strategy, which includes: Surgery to correct advanced stages of the disease; Antibiotics to treat active infection, using Zithromax (azithromycin) donated by Pfizer Inc through the International Trachoma Initiative; Facial cleanliness to reduce disease transmission; Environmental change to increase access to clean water and improved sanitation. Surgery For individuals with trichiasis, a bilamellar tarsal rotation procedure is warranted to direct the lashes away from the globe. Early intervention is beneficial as the rate of recurrence is higher in more advanced disease. Antibiotic therapy WHO Guidelines recommend that a region should receive community-based, mass antibiotic treatment when the prevalence of active trachoma among one to nine year-old children is greater than 10 percent. Subsequent annual treatment should be administered for three years, at which time the prevalence should be reassessed. Annual treatment should continue until the prevalence drops below five percent At lower prevalences, antibiotic treatment should be family-based. Antibiotic selection: Azithromycin (single oral dose of 20 mg/kg) or topical tetracycline (one percent eye ointment twice a day for six weeks). Azithromycin is preferred because it is used as a single oral dose. Although it is expensive, it is generally used as pa of the international donation program organized by Pfizer through the International Trachoma Initiative. Azithromycin can be used in children from the age of six months and in pregnancy. Facial cleanliness Children with grossly visible nasal discharge, ocular discharge, or flies on their faces are at least twice as likely to have active trachoma as children with clean faces. Intensive community-based health education programs to promote face-washing can significantly reduce the prevalence of active trachoma, especially intense trachoma (TI). If somebody is already infected washing one's face is strongly encouraged, especially a child, in order to prevent reinfection Environmental improvement Modifications in water use, fly control, latrine use, health education and proximity to domesticated animals have all been proposed to reduce transmission of C. trachomatis.",

Impulses from these nuclei travel in the oculomotor nerve to reach the ciliary ganglia. From the ciliary ganglia impulses travel to the eye where they cause the pupils to constrict by activation of the constrictor pupillae muscle. Pupillary light reflex refers to constriction of pupils of both eye when light is shone into the pupil of an eye. Constriction of the pupil in the eye into which light is shining is called direct response and constriction of the opposite pupil is called consensual response.

        "exp": "Ans. C: Pseudomyopia Pseudomyopia It refers to an intermittent and temporary shift in refraction of the eye towards myopia, in which the focusing of light in front of the retina is due to a transient spasm of the ciliary muscle causing an increase in the refractive power of the eye. It may be either organic, through stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system, or functional in origin, through eye strain or fatigue of ocular systems. It is common in young adults who have active accommodation, and classically occurs after a change in visual requirements, such as students preparing for an exam, or a change in occupation. The major symptom is intermittent blurring of distance vision paicularly noticeable after prolonged periods of near work, and symptoms of asthenopia. The vision may clear temporarily using concave (minus) lenses. The diagnosis is done by cycloplegic refraction using a strong cycloplegic like atropine or homatropine eye drops. Accommodative amplitude and facility may be reduced as a result of the ciliary muscle spasm. Treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology. Organic causes may include systemic or ocular medications, brain stem injury, or active ocular inflammation such as uveitis. Functional pseudomyopia is managed though modification of working conditions, an updated refraction, or through appropriate ocular exercises",

        "exp": "Ans. D: High myopia Degenerative high axial myopia is the most common cause of posterior staphyloma Staphyloma It is an abnormal protrusion of the uveal tissue through a weak point in the eyeball. The protrusion is generally black in colour, due to the inner layers of the eye. It occurs due to weakening of outer layer of eye (cornea or sclera) by an inflammatory or degenerative condition. It may be of 5 types, depending on the location on the eye ball (bulbus oculi). Anterior (corneal) staphyloma In the anterior segment of the eye, involving the cornea and the nearby sclera. Intercalary staphyloma It is the name given to the localised bulge in limbal area, lined by the root of the iris. It results due to ectasia of weak scar tissue formed at the limbus, following healing of a perforating injury or a peripheral corneal ulcer. There may be associated secondary angle closure glaucoma, may cause progression of the bulge if not treated. Defective vision occurs due to marked corneal astigmatism. Treatment consists of localised staphylectomy under heavy doses of oral steroids. Ciliary staphyloma It is the bulge of weak sclera lined by ciliary body, which occurs about 2-3 mm away from the limbus. Its common causes are thinning of sclera following perforating injury, scleritis and absolute glaucoma. Equatorial staphyloma Seen on the equator of the eye (region circumferencing the largest diameter ohogonal to the visual axis). Its causes are scleritis and degeneration of sclera in pathological myopia. It occurs more commonly in the regions of sclera which are perforated by voex veins. Posterior staphyloma It is seen in the posterior segment of the eye, typically diagnosed at the region of the macula, deforming the eye in a way that the eye-length is extended associated with myopia (nearsightedness). It is diagnosed by ophthalmoscopy, which shows an area of retinal excavation in the region of the staphvloma",

Causes may be Optical aniseikonia: - When the difference between refractive error of two eyes is of high degree, the image of an object may be of different size or shape in two eyes. So the defect is at refractive structures level. Retinal aniseikonia: - Defect is at retinal level and occurs due to displacement of retinal elements towards the nodal point in one eye due to stretching or edema of the retina. Coical aniseikonia: - Defect is at higher central level. There is asymmetrical simultaneous perception inspite of equal size of images formed on the two retinae. Up to 5 percent aniseikonia is well tolerated. For high degree of aniseikonia, treatment of choice is contact lenses.",
