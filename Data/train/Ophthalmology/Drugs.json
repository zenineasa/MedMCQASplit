It is found to reduce monocyte interleukin I, consequently inhibiting B lymphocytes.# Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine are employed in milder nonerosive disease in case methotrexate or sulfasalazine cannot be used, especially when only one or a few joints are involved. Chloroquine accumulates in tissues and produce toxicity, most disturbing of which is retinal damage (Bull's eye' maculopathy) and corneal opacity.# This is less common and reversible in case of hydroxychloroquine, which is preferred over chloroquine.# Other adverse effects are:- Rashes, - Graying of hair, - Irritable bowel syndrome, - Myopathy and- Neuropathy.
