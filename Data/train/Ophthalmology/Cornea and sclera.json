Reis-Buckler dystrophy Also known as ring-shaped dystrophy (due to the typical lesion) primarily involving the Bowman's layer is a progressive corneal dystrophy occurring in childhood. It has got an autosomal dominant inheritance. Most patients get frequent attacks of recurrent corneal erosions that usually result in diffuse anterior scarring. Treatment: In early cases, it is same as that of recurrent corneal erosions, i. e. by patching. However, most of the patients ultimately need lamellar or penetrating keratoplasty. Reis-Bucklers corneal dystrophy, is a rare, corneal dystrophy of unknown cause, in which the Bowman's layer of the cornea undergoes disintegration.

Ocular pain radiates to the jaw and temple. It is associated with localised or diffuse redness, mild to severe photophobia and lacrimation. Occasionally there occurs diminution of vision. Signs: The salient features of different clinical types of scleritis are as follows: 1. Non-necrotizing anterior diffuse scleritis: It is the commonest variety, characterised by widespread inflammation involving a quadrant or more of the anterior sclera. The involved area is raised and salmon pink to purple in colour. 2. Non-necrotizing anterior nodular scleritis: It is characterised by one or two hard, purplish elevated scleral nodules, usually situated near the limbus.

Slit lamp examination may show thinning and ectasia of central cornea, opacity at the apex and Fleischer's ring at the base of cone, folds in Descemet's and Bowman's membranes. Very fine, veical, deep stromal striae (Vogt lines) which disappear with external pressure on the globe are peculiar feature. 6. On retinoscopy a yawning reflex (scissor reflex) and high oblique or irregular astigmatism is obtained. 7. On distant direct ophthalmoscopy an annular dark shadow (due to total internal reflection of light) is seen which separates the central and peripheral areas of cornea (oil droplet reflex). 8. Munson's sign, i. e. localised bulging of lower lid when patient looks down is positive in late stages. Reference: Comprehensive ophthalmology, AK Khurana, 4th edition, page no. 119",

It may occur as mucopurulent conjunctivitis with petechial haemorrhages or acute follicular conjunctivitis with regional lymphadenopathy. Sometimes, severe necrotizing membranous inflammation may be seen. 2. Zoster keratitis: May precede the neuralgia or skin lesions. 3. Episcleritis and scleritis: These usually appear at the onset of the rash but are frequently concealed by the overlying conjunctivitis. 4. Iridocyclitis: It is of a frequent occurrence and may or may not be associated with keratitis. There may be associated hypopyon and hyphaema (acute haemorrhagic uveitis). 5. Acute retinal necrosis: 6. Anterior segment necrosis and phthisis bulbi. 7. Secondary glaucoma: It may occur due to trabeculitis in early stages and synechial angle closure in late stages.
