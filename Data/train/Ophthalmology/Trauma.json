A black biconvex area is seen at the periphery, and the pupillary edge bulges slightly inwards forming a 'D'-shaped pupil. In a blunt trauma, substance of the iris is often torn. The most common lesions are minute ruptures in the pupillary margin which are of little significance, while radiating lacerations of the iris, sometimes extending to the ciliary margin, are rare. Iridoschisis-This rare condition occurs most commonly as a degenerative ageing senile phenomenon, though it may follow as a late result of severe trauma. Large dehiscences appear on the anterior mesodermal layer of the iris and strands of this tissue may float into the anterior chamber.",
