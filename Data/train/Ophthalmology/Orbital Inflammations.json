        "exp": "ANSWER: (C) S. aureus. REF: With text. Bacterial orbital cellulitis is a life-threatening infection of the soft tissues behind the orbital septum. It can occur at any age but is more common in children. The most common causative organisms are S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, S. pyogenes and H. Influenzae. (Ref: Khurana 4th ed page 385, Kanski 7th ed chapter 3). The major causes of orbital cellulitis are sinusitis (58%), lid or face infection (28%), foreign body (11%), and hematogenous (4%). Staphylococcus and. Streptococcus are the most common causative organisms in adults, Haemophilus influenzae in children. Less common organisms are Pseudomonas and Escherichia coli. (Ref: Yanoff 2nd ed page 739)H. influenza type b has been the most common pathogen responsible for Orbital cellulitis prior to the advent of its vaccine. Currently Staphylococcus is the most common bacterial isolate. (Ref: Oculoplastics and Orbit: Aesthetic and Functional Oculofacial Volume 3 By. Rudolf R Guthoff, James Katowitz page 151). Option (D); Rhino-orbital mucormycosis: Mucormycosis is a very rare opportunistic infection caused by fungi of the family Mucoraceae, which typically affects patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or immunosuppression.

        "question": "Which sinus infection most commonly leads to Periorbital cellulitis?",
        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Ethmoidal. REF: Khurana page 384, Dhingra 4th Ed Pg 182, 190. Orbital cellulitis was asked in ENT June 2011. The orbital septum is an important landmark in distinguishing between orbital cellulitis (inside the septum) and periorbital cellulitis (outside the septum). Ethmoiditis being the commonest cause of orbital cellulitis. Note: However preseptal/periorbital cellulitis is not commonly caused by sinusitis, the most common sinus involved is Ethmoid sinus. PRESEPTAL CELLULITISPreseptal (or periorbital) cellulitis refers to infection of the subcutaneous tissues anterior to the orbital septum. Strictly speaking it is not an orbital disease but is included here under because the facial veins are valveless and preseptal cellulitis may spread posteriorly to produce orbital cellulitis. Causes: Causative organisms are usually staphylococcus aureus, H influenzae or sreptococcus pyogenes. Modes of infection. The organisms may invade the preseptal tissue by any of the following modes. Exogenous infection may result following skin laceration or insect bites. Extension from local infections such as from an acute hordeolum, acute dacryocystitis, ethmoid sinus. Endogenous infection may occur by haematogenous spread from remote infection of the middle ear or upper respiratory tract.",
