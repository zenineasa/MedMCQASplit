(Ref: Khurana 3rd Edition page 100.)Vernal corneal ulcers, also known as shield ulcers, are usually horizontally oval in orientation and involve the upper third of the cornea.Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis# Vernal keratitis is characterized by a combination of punctate epithelial erosions and keratitis. Punctate epithelial erosions are areas of absent epithelium that stain with fluorescein. Punctate epithelial keratitis is an influx of white cells into the corneal epithelium. The epithelium in this area stains with rose bengal, which stains devitalized cells.# Keratitis epithelialis of Tobgy is the early phase of vernal keratitis, consisting of minute white dots in the epithelium.# When the keratitis coalesces, a vernal (shield) ulcer is formed. There is often white material at the base of the ulcer, which has been reported to be mucopolysaccharides. In general, these ulcers are sterile, but there have been rare reports of superimposed infectious corneal ulcers occurring in VKC. These ulcers differ from vernal shield ulcers, which are indolent and often have a plaque at the base.# Horner-Trantas' dots are small white elevated lesions that appear at the apices of limbal excresences that consist of desquamated epithelial cells and eosinophils.# Subepithelial scarring and pseudogerontoxon also known to occur.Vernal conjunctivitis (Spring catarrh) : key facts- Bulbar and palpebral conjunctivitis- Bilateral and recurrent- Ropy discharge- 'Cobble stone' palpebral conjunctiva- Gaint papilla- Horner-Trantas spots- Maxwell-Lion sign- Pseudogerontoxon- Treatment with steroids, acetyl cysteine and topical NSAID",

(Ref: Khurana 3rd Edition page 92.).To diagnose active trachoma (esp Trachomatous inflammation-follicular stage), at least >5 follicles each of >0.5 mm diameter must be present on the upper tarsal conjunctiva.TRACHOMA WHO CLASSIFICATIONTrachoma has always been an important blinding disease under consideration of WHOand thus many attempts have been made to streamline is clinical profile. The latest classification suggested by WHO in 1987 (to replace all the previous ones) is as follows:1. Trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF). It is the stage of active trachoma with predominantly follicular inflammation. To diagnose this stage at least five or more follicles (each 0.5 mm or more indimeter) must be present on the upper tarsal conjunctiva (PL. 1.2). Further, the deep trasal vessels should be visible through the follicles and papillae.2. Trachomatous inflammation-intense (TI). This stage is diagnosed when pronounced inflammatory thickening of more upper tarsal conjunctiva obscures more than half of the normal deep tarsal vessels (PL. 1.3).3. Trachomatous scarring (TS). This stage is diagnosed by the presence of scarring in the tarsal conjuctiva. These scars are easily visible as white, banks or sheets (fibrosis) in the tarsal conjunctiva (PL. 1.4).4. Trachomatous trichiasis(TT). It is labelled when at least one eyelash rubs the eyeball. Evidence of recent removal of inturned eyelashes should also be graded as trachomatous trichiasis (PL. 1.5)/5. Corneal opacity (CO). This stage is labelled when early visible corneal opacity is present over the pupil. This sign ferers to corneal scarring that is do dense that at least part of pupil margin is blurred when seen through the opacity. The definition is intended to detect corneal opacities that cause significant visual impairment (less than 6/18).",

The difference in clinical appearance based on difference in histopathology allows a clear differentiation. The edge of Haab's striae are thickened, curled, and secondarily proliferate Descemet's membrane, while the area between the edge is thin and smooth. Posterior polymorphous dystrophy bands are the exact opposite. The band is a thickening of Descemet's membrane between the edges with thinner, more normal Descemet's membrane outside of them.
