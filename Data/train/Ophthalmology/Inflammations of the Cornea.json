        "exp": "Ans. b. Lactate (Ref: Yanoff and Duker 4/e p280). In hypoxic injury, cornea becomes edematous because of accumulation of lactate. 'Contact lenses are generally very well tolerated, but they induce numerous changes in corneal physiology and the tear film. Decreased oxygen tension occurs with contact lens wear, especially when conventional lenses are worn overnight. Hypoxic stromal edema results from the osmotic changes produced by lactate accumulation. - Yanoff and Duker 4/e p280. Cornea. Cornea (the anterior surface) is the most important refractive surface of the eye, and have power of 45 diopter (3/4th of total power of eye). The refractive index is 1. 376Q The critical angle is 46\" at cornea tear interface. The healthy cornea is avascular and devoid of lymphatic channelsQ. Corneal cell derives nourishment by diffusion from the aqueous, the capillaries at the limbus and oxygen dissolved in the tear himQ. The metabolism of cornea is preferentially aerobicQ and it can function only up to 6-7 hours anaerobically under normal conditions. Hypoxic corneal stromal edema results from the osmotic changes produced by lactate accumulationQ. The metabolic active cells are endothelium, epithelium and stromal keratocytes. QOxygen is mostly derived from tear filmQ with a small contribution from timbal capillaries. Glucose supply from cornea metabolism is mainly (90%) derived from aqueousQ and supplemented (10%) by limbal capillaries. Cornea is richly supplied by nervesQ (without myelin sheaths and Schwann cell sheath) which originate from small ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve, mainly by long ciliary nerveQ Due to its dense nerve supply, the cornea is extremely sensitive structure.",

Many pyogenic organisms (Staphylococcus, streptococci, gonococci, Moraxella) and fungi may produce hypopyon but by far the most dangerous are pseudomonas pyogenea and pneumococcus. o Thus, any corneal ulcer may be associated with hypopyon, however, it is customary to reserve the term 'hypopyon corneal ulcer'for the characteristic ulcer caused by pneumococcus and the term 'corneal ulcer with hypopyon' for the ulcers associated with hypopyon due to other causes. The characteristic hypopyon corneal ulcer caused by pneumococcus is called \"ulcus serpens\". o It is worth noting that the hypopyon in bacterial causes is sterile since the outpouring of polymorphonuclear cells is due to toxin and not due to actual invasion by bacteria. On the other hand, hypopyon in fungal (mycotic) corneal ulcer is non-sterile as there is direct invasion by fungi.",

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the MC gram-negative organism isolated from corneal ulcers and is a frequent cause of contact lens-associated keratitisQ. Source of Infection: These aerobic bacilli are found in moist environments. QFrequently contaminate inadequately chlorinated swimming pools and hot tubs, ventilators, nebulizer and vaporizer solutions, and ophthalmic solution bottlesQ. Pathophysiology: The organism readily adheres to damaged epithelium, and stromal invasion is rapidQ. Pseudomonas keratitis tends to progress rapidly if inadequately treated. Most commonly, the organism produces destructive enzymes such as protease, lipase, elastase, and exotoxin, which results in necrotic, lipase, elastase, and exotoxin, which results in necrotic, soupy ulceration. The ulcer often extends peripherally and deeply within hours and can rapidly involve the entire cornea. Ring ulcers can develop, and the corneal epithelium peripheral to the primary ulcer typically develops a diffuse gray, ground-glass appearance. The corneal stroma appears to dissolve into a greenish yellow mucous discharge that fluoresces under ultraviolet (but not under cobalt blue) light. The suppurative ulcer frequently thins to a discemetocele that perforatesQ. The ulcer is often associated with a marked anterior chamber reaction and hypopyon formation. Extensive keratitis can extend to the limbus and produce an infectious sclertis.",
