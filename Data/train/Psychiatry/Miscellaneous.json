        "exp": "(A) Continuous positive pressure ventilation# Sleep apnea: Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. Each episode, called an apnea, lasts long enough so that one or more breaths are missed, and such episodes occur repeatedly throughout sleep.> The standard definition of any apneic event includes a minimum 10 second interval between breaths, with either a neurological arousal (a 3-second or greater shift in EEG frequency, measured at C3, C4, O1, or O2), a blood oxygen desaturation of 3-4deg/: or greater, or both arousal and desaturation. Sleep apnea is diagnosed with an overnight sleep test called a polysomnogram, or a \"Sleep Study\".> Treatment: The most common treatment and arguably the most consistently effective treatment for sleep apnea is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device, which 'splints' the patient's airway open during sleep by means of a flow of pressurized air into the throat. However the CPAP machine only assists inhaling whereas a Bi. PAP machine assists with both inhaling and exhaling, and is used in more severe cases. Medications like Acetazolamide lower blood pH and encourage respiration. Low doses of oxygen are also used as a treatment for hypoxia but are discouraged due to side effects.",

It is the commonest type of phobia encountered in clinical practice. Women far out-number men In suffering from agoraphobia in the Western countries. It is characterized by an irrational fear of being in places away from the familiar setting of home.

In fact patient is afraid of all the places or situations from where escape may be difficult or help may not beavailable. if he suddenly develops embarrassing symptoms. These embarrassing or incapacitating symptoms are the classical symptoms of panic.

As the agoraphobia increases in severity, there is a gradual restriction in the normal day-to-day activities.

Fluvoxamine (50-200 mg/day) is marketed as a specific anti-obsessional SSRI drug, whilst Paroxetine (20-40 mg/day) & Sertraline (50-200 mg/day) are also effective in some patients. Antipsychotics: These are occasionally used in low doses (e. g. haloperidol, risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, pimozide) in the treatment of severe, disabling anxiety. Buspirone has also been used beneficially as an adjunct for augmentation of SSRIs, in some patients.> Electroconvulsive Therapy: In presence of severe depression with OCD, ECT may be needed. ECT is particularly indicated when there is a risk of suicide and/or when there is a poor response to the other modes of treatment. ECT is not the treatment of First choice in OCD.> Psychosurgery: Psychosurgery can be used in treatment of OCD that has become intractable & is not responding to other methods of treatment. It is worth mentioning that psychosurgery is only available as a treatment choice at a very few centres throughout the world. The best responders are usually those who have significant associated depression, although pure obsessives also do respond. The main benefit is the marked reduction in associated distress and severe anxiety.",

In Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a caregiver, usually the mother, fabricates or produces symptoms of illness in a child. The caregiver's motive is to vicariously receive care and attention from health providers through the sick child. The severity of the disorder varies from cases in which symptoms are completely fabricated to cases in which the mother causes serious physical harm to or even the death of the child. Mothers in cases of Munchausen by proxy are extremely attentive to their children and often are considered model parents. These mothers are not cognitively impaired or psychotic; on the contrary, they are often quite accomplished and knowledgeable and frequently work or have worked in the medical field. Not infrequently, more than one child is victimized in a family, particularly in cases of suffocation disguised as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or apnea.

Compulsions are defined as repetitive acts, behaviours, or thoughts that are designed to counteract the anxiety associated with an obsession. The key characteristic of a compulsion is that it reduces the anxiety associated with the obsession. OCD frequently co-occurs with other disorders. The association with major depression is particularly prominent. OCD exhibits a particularly interesting association with Tourette's syndrome. Approximately half of all patients with Tourette's syndrome meet criteria for OCDThe prevalence of the disorder is approximately equal in men and women, although men tend to have an earlier onset than women do. OCDs typically begin in late adolescence, although onset in childhood is not uncommon Washing of hands or the whole body is the commonest OCD. Treatment Psychotherapy. Behaviour therapy and.

        "exp": "(A) Persecution # DELUSIONS are misguided beliefs that have no basis in reality, and people with schizophrenia often suffer from delusions as a symptom of their disease. Their disorganized thinking and impaired ability to interpret new information often lead them to false perceptions. People with schizophrenia often have delusions that fit certain common categories.> Persecutory delusions are the most common type of delusions experienced by people with schizophrenia. These types of delusions are based on suspicions of being targeted by someone or something. People with these types of delusions mistakenly believe that they are being followed, harmed, poisoned or tormented. Delusions of persecution are suggestive of the paranoid type of schizophrenia.> Referential: Referential delusions are another common type of delusion reported by people with schizophrenia. People with referential delusions believe that gestures and words of others are specifically directed at them. They become convinced that they are the focus of song lyrics, books or comments made by someone on television.> Grandiose: Delusions of grandeur are based on the affected person's mistaken idea that he is someone of extreme importance. People with this type of delusions may believe they are a popular celebrity or a powerful political figure. Since they believe they are well-known or famous, it is disturbing to them when others do not recognize or acknowledge them as such.> Religious: Religious delusions center around misguided ideas about one's relationship with God. People with schizophrenia with this type of delusion may believe they have a special relationship with God or that God has given them special powers. They may profess an ability to speak directly to God or a responsibility to carry out God's plans. In some cases, these individuals may actually believe that they are God.> Somatic: Somatic delusions involve a preoccupation with one's body. These delusions commonly consist of erroneous beliefs that they are suffering from a physical condition, such as a tumor. However, the perceived source of the physical malady is usually bizarre, such as having a foreign substance in one's body.> Control: Delusions of control involve the belief that one's thoughts and actions have been taken over by some outside force. People with schizophrenia with delusions of control believe that their thoughts have been involuntarily taken from their mind. Therefore, they are convinced that the thoughts in their mind are not their own. Delusions of control may also include the belief that their bodies are being manipulated to perform certain actions.# SUBTYPES OF SCHIZOPHRENIA: With the publication of DSM-5, the APA removed all sub-classifications of schizophrenia. The five sub-classifications included in DSM-IV-TR were:> Paranoid type: Delusions or auditory hallucinations are present, but thought disorder, disorganized behavior, or affective flattening are not. Delusions are persecutory and/or grandiose, but in addition to these, other themes such as jealousy, religiosily. or somatization may also be present.> Disorganized type: Named hebephrenic schizophrenia in the ICD. Where thought disorder and flat affect are present together.> Catatonic type: The subject may be almost immobile or exhibit agitated, purposeless movement. Symptoms can include catatonic stupor and waxy flexibility.> Undifferentiated type: Psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types have not been met.> Residual type: Where positive symptoms are present at a low intensity only.> ICD-10 defines two additional subtypes: Post-schizophrenic depression: A depressive episode arising in the aftermath of a schizophrenic illness where some low level schizophrenic symptoms may still be present. Simple schizophrenia: Insidious and progressive development of prominent negative symptoms with no history of psychotic episodes.> Latent schizophrenia, schizophrenic reaction, pseudoneurotic schizophrenia, pseudopsychopathic schizophrenia, \"symptom- depleted\" schizophrenia are in the Russian version of the ICD-10.",

Down syndrome/Trisomy 21: Chromosome 21 genetic disorder, associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features and mild to moderate intellectual disability. Neurodevelopmental disorder for studying the biological consequences of polygenic, complex disorders, as the source of polygenic disruption (trisomy 21) is well established. Among these, a characterization of the DS developmental brain transcriptome found that approximately 5 percent of genes on all chromosomes were dysregulated at some point in development, with a roughly equal number of up- and down-regulated genes, with the exception of 18 percent of Chr21 genes, all of which were up-regulated. Revealed prominent hypomyelination, disorganization of myelinated fibers, and slower conductance through myelinated fiber tracts as features of DS neuropathology. Neurological Features of Down Syndrome: Most individuals with Down syndrome have. Mild (IQ: 50-69) or. Moderate (IQ: 35-50) intellectual disability. Severe (IQ: 20-35) difficulties. Typically have IQ scores 10-30 points higher. Typically perform less well than their same-age peers. After 30 years of age some may lose their ability to speak. This syndrome causes about a third of cases of intellectual disability. Many developmental milestones are delayed with the ability to crawl typically occurring around 8 months rather than 5 months and the ability to walk independently typically occurring around 21 months rather than 14 months. Down syndrome have better language understanding than ability to speak. Between 10 and 45% have either a stutter or rapid and irregular speech, making it difficult to understand them. Do fairly well with social skills. Behavior problems are not generally as great an issue as in other syndromes associated with intellectual disability. Mental illness occurs in nearly 30% with autism occurring in 5-10%. Experience a wide range of emotions. Are generally happy, symptoms of depression and anxiety may develop in early adulthood. Are at increased risk of epileptic seizures, which occur in 5-10% of children and up to 50% of adults. Increased risk of a specific type of seizure called infantile spasms. Many (15%) who live 40 years or longer develop Alzheimer disease. In those who reach 60 years of age, 50-70% have the disease. Other Options[?]. Oligophrenia: Oligophrenia Old term for mental retardation. [?]. Madness: Insanity, a spectrum of behaviors characterized by certain abnormal mental or behavioral patterns.

Hallucinations at sleep onset (hypnogogic hallucinations) or upon awakening (hypnopompic hallucinations); and Muscle paralysis upon awakening (sleep paralysis). Narcolepsy: Treatment The treatment of narcolepsy is symptomatic. Somnolence is treated with wake-promoting therapeutics. Modafinil is now the drug of choice, principally because it is associated with fewer side effects than older stimulants and has a long half-life; 20. CM00 mg is given as a single daily dose. Modafinil, like other stimulants, increases the release of monoamines, specifically the catecholamines norepinephrine and dopamine, from the synaptic terminals. However, modafinil also elevates hypothalamic histamine levels In the United States, modafinil is approved by the U. S.

In some countries, it is also approved for idiopathic hypersomnia (all forms of excessive daytime sleepiness where causes can't be established).

The severity of the stressor or stressors does not always predict the severity of the disorder; the stressor severity is a complex function of degree, quantity, duration, reversibility, environment, and personal context. Stressors may be single, such as a divorce or the loss of a job, or multiple, such as the death of a person important to a patient, which coincides with the patient's own physical illness and loss of a job. Specific developmental stages, such as beginning school, leaving home, getting married, becoming a parent, failing to achieve occupational goals, having the last child leave home, and retiring, are often associated with adjustment disorders.",

But finally he reaches his goal (i. e. he tells his blood sugar level).

The thought reaches its ultimate goal in a long and round about manner; taking too many degressions and irrelevant elaborations on its way. In simple words, thinking is indirect in reaching a goal or getting a point, i. e., it does not reach the goal directly, rather it reaches the goal indirectly through other direction because of irrelevant details and digressions. It is seen in mania, Schizophrenia and anankastic personality disorder. About other optionsi) Tangentiality (Tangential thinking): - In contrast to circumstantiality the goal is not reached in tangentiality. The thought is sidetracked more and more away from the natural end and never returns to its original point. In response to a question, the patient gives answer that is appropriate to general topic without actually answering the original question, e. g., Q:- Do you have trouble sleeping? Ans. I used to sleep in my bed but now I am sleeping on floor. ii) Flight of ideas: - Skipping verbally from one thought to another before completion of first thought causing the speech to become fragmented.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Phobia Flooding* Flooding is based on the assumption that fear dissipates when the subject is not allowed to escape from the scene. The subject is exposed to the fear provoking situations abruptly and not in a graded way as in systemic desensitization and without any attempt to reduce anxiety. The sessions continue till fear dissipates. It is used in phobia. Other forms of behavior therapy1. Systemic desensitizaiton: - It is based on the principle of reciprocal inhibition i. e., if a response is incompatible with anxiety is made to occur at the same time as an anxiety provoking stimulus then anxiety is reduced by reciprocal inhibition. Systemic desensitization are used in phobia and OCD. 2. Therapeutic-graded exposure:- Therapeutic graded exposure is similar to systemic desensitization, except that relaxation training is not involved and treatment is usually carried out in a real-life context. This means that the individual must be brought in contact with (i. e., be exposed to) the warning stimulus to learn firsthand that no dangerous consequences will ensue. Exposure is graded according to a hierarchy. For example, Patient afraid of cats might progress from looking at a picture of cat to holding one. 3. Exposure & response prevention: - Patient is exposed to a situation (intentional contamination of hand which from carrying out rituals (e. g., by shutting of water). The anxiety which mounts up dissipates after sometime. It is particularly useful for OCD and some types of phobias. 4. Aversion therapy: - Aversion therapy is used for the treatment of conditions which are pleasant but undesirable (e. g., alcoholism, sexual deviation, drug abuse, smoking). The underlying principle is the pairing of the pleasant stimulus (e. g., alcohol) with an unpleasant response (e. g., brief electric stimulus). 5. Operant conditioning procedure for decreasing a behavior: -a. Positive punishment: - On performing an undesired behavior an aversive stimulus is given. b. Negative punishment: - On performance of an undesired behavior, reward is avoided.",

Dysarthria, gait disturbance, and oculomotor abnormalities are common features. With advancing disease, there may be a reduction in chorea and emergence of dystonia, rigidity, bradykinesia, myoclonus, and spasticity.

HD patients may also develop non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and neuroendocrine abnormalities, e. g., hypothalamic dysfunction. A clinical diagnosis of HD can be strongly suspected in cases of chorea with a positive family history. The disease predominantly strikes the striatum.

It may also involve other neurological deficits, such as psychomotor disturbances (e. g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleep-wake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e. g. hallucinations and delusions), although these features are not required for diagnosis. Delirium is caused by an acute organic process, which is a physically identifiable structural, functional, or chemical problem in the brain that may arise from a disease process outside the brain that nonetheless affects the brain. It may result from an underlying disease process (e. g. infection, hypoxia, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance), side effect of a medication, withdrawal from drugs, over-consumption of alcohol, or from any number of factors affecting one's overall health (e. g. malnutrition, pain, etc.).

It is a system for coding all diseases of mankind. It also includes: o Signs and symptomso Abnormal findingso Social circumstanceso External causes of injury or distress. It is published by WHO (World Health Organization). The current version is 10th. Next version 11th is expected in 2015. It has 22 chapters (coded in Roman I to XXII). It also has codes as \"alpha-numericaC (i. e. alphabets and numbers). The alphabets A to Z are there but put in chapters as ''blocks\". For example, Chapter I contains A and B blocks. Mental health disorders are coded in Chapter V, F block. Each alphabet (block) has numbers in two digits which in turn followed by two decimal numbers. For example, moderate depressive episode with somatic syndrome is coded as F32. ll. Mental health disorders are coded from F00 to F99 in ten categories (F00-FO9, FIO-19. F20-29, F90-99). First organic conditions (F00-09), then substance use (F10-19) are coded and insist all of us to rule out these etiopathological factors first in any case of behavioral disturbance. Other classificatory systems are DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Vth revision) and Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD, 3rd edition). DSM is devised by APA ( American Psychiatric Association). In contrast to ICD. these classification systems are applicable for mental health problems ONLY (ICD codes all disorders). ICD system is used for medical insurance system in USA though DSM is used widely by clinicians.",

Kaplan & Sadock's Synopsis of Psychiatry, Xth/Ch. 6. 1, Page no, 202........... \"Denial is the avoidance of awareness of some painful aspect of reality by negating sensory data. Displacement refers to the shifting of an emotion or a drive from one object to another (for e. gthe shifting of unacceptable aggressive feelings toward one's parents to the family cat). \"Discussion:# Denial is a defense mechanism in which the conscious awareness of a painful reality is abolished. E. g. in case of a female with the bad news from her doctor about she being suffering from Ca breast, she will not pretend that her doctor's visit was uneventful; she consciously will believe that her doctor's visit was fine.# In displacement, an unacceptable impulse or emotion is shifted from one object to another. This permits the release of the impulse or emotion onto someone or something that is less unacceptable or dangerous.# Distortion is the reshaping of external reality to suit one's inner needs. For example, a singer who is told at an audition that she needs a lot of work to make her voice stronger remembers the audition as notable for receiving only positive feedback. Blocking is the inhibition of thinking, temporarily and transiently. Isolation is the splitting or separating of an idea from the emotion that accompanies it (but has been repressed).# Dissociation is the temporary but drastic modification of a per- son's sense of personal identity so that emotional distress can be avoided. Fugue states are one example of dissociation in action. Additional Educational points: Freud classified defense mechanisms as narcissistic (or primitive, including denial, projection, and distortion), immature (acting out, introjection, passive-aggressive behavior, somatization, and several others), neurotic (displacement, externalization, intellectualization, rationalization, inhibition, reaction formation, and repression), and mature (sublimation, altruism, asceticism, anticipation, suppression, and humor).# Projection is the act of perceiving and acting as if unacceptable internal impulses (which are unconscious) are coming from the external realm. For example, a patient with very aggressive impulses, which are unacceptable to him, begins acting as if the person in the room with him were being aggressive toward him.# Sublimation is the act of transforming unacceptable social impulses into acceptable ones, in order to achieve impulse gratification. For example, a man with strong homicidal impulses writes extremely graphic but successful horror novels as a way to channel those unacceptable feelings into something socially appropriate.# Reaction formation is the transformation of an unacceptable impulse into its opposite. For example, a woman who has feelings of hate and disgust toward another finds these impulses unaccept- able, so instead she behaves as if this other person is a good friend.# Altruism uses service to others as a way of getting one's instincts gratified.",

Other symptoms may include muscle tremors and pharyngitis. Once symptoms do appear, they rapidly progress and can reach peak intensity in as little as three days.

During an erotomanic episode, the patient believes that a \"secret admirer\" is declaring his or her affection to the patient, often by special glances, signals, telepathy, or messages through the media. Usually the patient then returns the perceived affection by means of letters, phone calls, gifts, and visits to the unwitting recipient.

        "exp": "Ans: A (Malingering) Ref: Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 9th edition. Explanation: Voluntary Vs Involuntary Symptoms. Presentation of symptoms, signs and disability are either \"involuntary\" as in almost all physical problems or \"voluntary\" as in some psychological issues. Identification and classification depends upon: 1. The nature of symptoms and signs. 2. Consistency of it. 3. Corroborative evidence {from others like relatives, staff and from investigations) for the underlying mechanisms. 4. The supposed aim or effect of it on the person's life. In case of voluntary (willful) production, the signs and symptoms do not fit into the existing literature, inconsistent, have poor corroboration and will give the feeling of \"something fishy\" to the clinician (effect/aim of having such pro. Wems). In case of malingering and factitious disorders, \"voluntary\" presentation occurs: rest of the disorders it is \"involuntary\". Gain. From psychiatric point of view. \"Gain\" is the term used for such psychological phenomena. Gain is something by which a person achieves through the signs and symptoms or illness and disability. There are three types of gain: 1. Primary gain - used for \"relief from anxiety\". The anxiety is in turn due to conflict within. 2. Secondary gain is any tangible or Intangible benefit one gets. Example for tangible benefit - money, intangible benefit- leave or care. 3. Tertiary gain is when a relative gets intangible or tangible benefit because of the sickness of the patient. For example, father taking leave from office to look after his sick daughter. Secondary and tertiary gain are due to almost always willful production, hence it can result in malingering or factitious disorder. The difference between the two lies in the aim of production. If a person produces symptoms to get money, leave from work, litigious revenge- then it is malingering as in the question. If a person produces signs and symptoms to get care and affection- factitious disorder. Also Note: In conversion and dissociative disorders, production of symptoms is involuntary and the aim is to get primary gain'. In somatoform/ somatization disorder, involuntary production is due to \"undue feaf' (pathological anxiety) about body/future. In case ot hypochondriasis, the patient is worried about having/contracting an illness rather than worried about symptoms per se, otherwise it is similar to somatoform disorder. In delusional disorder (of somatic type), the belief is too rigid and patient is fully convinced and not amenable for explanations to the contrary.",
