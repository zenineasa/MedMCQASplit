Neurological disorders often present with psychological disturbances leading to misdiagnosis of the underlying problem. Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in such cases. It may be a part of the disease process or a reaction to the illness/disability or even a side effect of drugs used for underlying diseases. In case of stroke, the mechanism of development of depressive disorder is complex, either part of the disease process per se or the reaction to the disability or both.
