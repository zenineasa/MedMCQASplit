The clinical features include small hands and feet and a deceleration of the rate of head growth between 5-48 months (including microcephaly in some). Loss of previously acquired hand skills. Repetitive hand movements, such as wringing and/or repeatedly putting hands into the mouth, are also noted and also. People with Rett syndrome are prone to gastrointestinal disorders and up to 80% have seizures. They typically have no verbal skills, and about 50% of individuals affected are not ambulatory. Scoliosis, growth failure, and constipation are very common and can be problematic.

Biological Factors in Suicide# Diminished central serotonin plays a role in suicidal behavior.# Low concentrations of CSF 5-HIAA also predicts future suicidal behavior. ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF SUICIDE# There is some evidence that a functional polymorphism in the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene may interact with stressful life events to markedly increase risk of depression and suicide.# Postmortem examination of brains of suicide victims indicate altered noradrenergic activity, including increased binding to a1, - a2-, and b-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex and decreased numbers of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. Involvement of the serotonin system is suggested by findings of reduced plasma tryptophan levels, a decreased cerebrospinal fluid level of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (the principal metabolite of serotonin in brain), and decreased platelet serotonergic transporter binding. An increase in brain serotonin receptors in suicide victims and decreased expression of the cyclic AMP response element-binding (CREB) protein are also reported.# However, a decrement in mood after tryptophan reduction is considerably less robust in untreated patients, indicating that, if presynaptic serotonergic dysfunction occurs in depression, it likely plays a contributing rather than a causal role.

Genetics and of Eating Disorders. Advances in Genomics and Genetics page 131-150. Explanation: Pathological problems associated with eating are many, like pica, overeating, under-eating. By and large, eating disorders denote: o Anorexia nervosa (AN). Bulimia nervosa (BN); and. Binge eating disorder. Etiology-wise, they have more genetic contribution (than many psychiatric disorders). Studies (especially twin-studies) indicate upto 74% of phenotypic variation can be accounted by additive genetic factors. Penetrance is defined as the probability of expression of an allele. It can be complete/incomplete; highly penetrant/low penetrant. In eating disorders, studies show higher degree of penetrance (> 50%, some studies state upto 90%) (option (d)). Like any other psychiatric disorder, eating disorders have neuro-humoral underpinnings. Brain regions and chemicals which are involved in appetite are implicated. Neurological substrates are mainly hypothalamus, anterior frontal regions. Till date, all monoamine neurotransmitter systems were implicated in AN and BN. Among the NTs, dysregulation of 5-HT system appears to have robust data (option (a)). Starvation and other symptoms of eating disorders are mutually reinforcing each other, may be leading to a vicious cycle as in animal models (p. 1119, Biological Psychiatry).",

Atypical depression as a biologically distinct subtype of depression has been suggested by its superior response to MAOIs compared to TCAs and from cerebral laterality, as well from genetic and neuroendocrine studies. (CTP 10th Eds, ICD10, DSM-V). Criteria for atypical depression* According to the DSM-V, symptoms of depression with atypical features include the following: A. Mood reactivity (i. e., mood brightens in response to positive events)B. Two or more of the following features, present for most of the time, for at least two weeks: 1. Increased appetite2. Increased sleep3. Leaden paralysis (i. e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs)4. Interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) resulting in significant social or occupational impairmentC. Criteria are not met for melancholic(ENDOGENOUS/BIOLOGICAL) or catatonic features of depression. So Atypical depression can be defined as a subgroup of Depression (DSM5, ICD-10) the main criterion of atypical depression is the presence of mood reactivity in combination with at least two of four secondary criteria (hypersomnia, increased appetite or weight gain, leaden paralysis, and interpersonal rejection sensitivity). Note: The chief complaint of fatigue as part of the symptom of leaden paralysis in people with atypical depression can also result in misdiagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. That is why patients with no physical signs and symptoms (like tender lymph nodes, sore throat) but with history of long-standing fatigue should be carefully screened for presence of atypical depression. Other importent feature of ATYPICAL DEPRESSION are (compared to the patients with non-atypical depression)1. Female gender2. Earlier age of onset3. Longer disease duration4. More depressive recurrences5. More chronic disease course6. More suicidality7. More severe symptoms8. More comorbid diagnoses - dysthymia, substance abuse, antisocial personality disorder, panic disorder and social phobia9. Verbal fluency and psychomotor speed tasks seem to to differentiate atypical subtype of depression from melancholic subtype, since melancholic patients performed worst. 10. Is often associated with HPA axis down-regulation, inflammatory and metabolic dysregulation11. Usually have higher rates of a history of neglect and abuse during the childhood and familial alcohol and drug disorders. Major differentiating symptoms of atypical and melancholic (part of non-atypical) depression. Symptom. Atypical. Melancholic (nonatypical). Mood reactivity. Mood reactivity present (brightens in response to positive events). Lack of mood reactivity even temporarily, when something good happens. Weight appetite. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite. Significant anorexia or weight loss. Sleep. Excessive sleep all through the day. Decreased sleep with early morning awakening. Psychomotor activity. Leaden paralysis (heavy feeling in arms, legs). Psychomotor retardation or agitation. Personality thinking. Interpersonal rejection sensitivity not limited to mood episodes. Excessive or inappropriate guild during mood episodes. Diurnal variation. Depression likely worse in evening (not part of diagnostic criteria). Depression regularly worse in morning. Treatment* Psychotherapeutic treatments are often found to be less effective than pharmacotherapy.* Such patients responded better to monoamine oxidase inhibitors (M AOIs) compared to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).",

Depressive Ideation/Cognition: Sadness of mood is usually associated with pessimism, which can result in three common types of depressive ideas. These are: a. Hopelessness (there is no hope in the future). b. Helplessness (no help is possible now). c. Wohlessness (feeling of inadequacy and inferiority). The ideas of wohlessness can lead to self-reproach and guilt-feelings. Psychomotor Activity In younger patients (< 40 years old), retardation is more common and is characterised by slowed thinking and activity, decreased energy and monotonous voice. In a severe form, the patient can become stuporous ( depressive stupor). In the older patients (e. g. post-menopausal women), agitation is common. It often presents with marked anxiety, restlessness (inability to sit still, handwringing, picking at body pas or other objects) and a subjective feeling of unease.

Postpartum psychosis. Postpartum Blues fsvn. maternity blues/ baby blues}It is a common, transient and self-limiting condition. Observed 4-5 days after delivery. Lasts a few days to 2 - 3 weeks. Occurs at the height of hormonal changes. Seen in 50% of postpartum women. Manifestations are: o Labile moodo Depressiono Anxietyo Fearful nesso Insomniao Helplessnesso Negative feelings towards infant. Can progress to post-partum depression. Treatment: Reassurance and psychological support of family members. Contrast to this, baby pinks\" is a condition where women experience elated mood. It is rare but serves as a risk factor for postpartum psychosis. Postpartum Depression (postnatal depression)it is an uncommon disorder characterised by symptoms of major depression. Occurs usually within 2 weeks after childbirth. Lasts more than 2 weeks. Neglect of self and baby is a real threat. Seen in 10 - 20% of mothers. It is more gradual in onset over the first 4-6 months following delivery or abortion. Changes in hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Clinical features: o Loss of energyo Loss of appetiteo Insomniao Social withrdrawaio Irritiabilityo Suicidal tendencies. Risk of recurrence is 50 - 100% in subsequent pregnancies. Treatment: Fluoxetine is effective. It is insidious or acute in onset and warrants treatment as earfy as possible. SSRIs and psychotherapy both found to be useful. Risk factors are: o Family historyo Past history of depressiono Premenstrual dysphoric disorder o Unwanted pregnancy. Postpartum Psychosis (Puerperal psychosis). It is a rare but severe condition. It is characterised by abrupt or acute onset of either. o Polymorphic or persistent changes in mood (elation or depression). o Behaviour {agitation or catatonia), o Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions), It occurs within 2 weeks of childbirth. Risk factors: o Primi-gravidao Female babieso Babies with congenital defects. ECT is highly effective method of treatment. SSRIs and antipsychotics also useful. Ruling out organic cause is must (like cortical vein thrombosis). Course is relatively fair but NOT GOOD. Recurrence is a real possibility but NOT A RULE.

(The use of panic- inducing substances is strictly limited to research settings; no clinically indicated reasons exist to stimulate panic attacks in patients.) So-called respiratory panic-inducing substances cause respiratory stimulation and a shift in the acid-base balance. These substances include carbon dioxide (5 to 35 percent mixtures), sodium lactate, and bicarbonate.* Neurochemical panic-inducing substances that act through specific neurotransmitter systems include yohimbine, an I^+-2-adrenergic receptor antagonist; m-chlorophenyl piperazine (m. CPP), an agent with multiple serotonergic effects; m-Caroline drugs; GABAB receptor inverse agonists; flumazenil (Romazicon), a GABAB receptor antagonist; cholecystokinin; and caffeine. Isoproterenol (Isuprel) is also a panic-inducing substance, although its mechanism of action in inducing panic attacks is poorly understood.* The respiratory panic-inducing substances may act initially at the peripheral cardiovascular baroreceptors and relay their signal by vagal afferents to the nucleus tractus solitarii and then on to the nucleus paragigantocellularis of the medulla.* The hyperventilation in panic disorder patients may be caused by a hypersensitive suffocation alarm system whereby increasing PCO2 and brain lactate concentrations prematurely activate a physiological asphyxia monitor.* The neurochemical panic-inducing substances are presumed to primarily affect the noradrenergic, serotonergic, and GABA receptors of the CNS directly.",

        "exp": "Twin studies are useful tools to separate biological and environmental etiologic factors in illnesses. Most twin studies sta with the selection of monozygotic and same-sex dizygotic twin pairs who are raised together, in which one of the twins has the disorder. The other twin is then followed to determine if he or she also develops the disorder. The propoion of the twin pairs in which both twins are affected is called concordance. The difference in the concordance rate between the monozygotic and the dizygotic pairs reflects the impoance of hereditary factors in the development of the disorder. The concordance rate for mood disorders in monozygotic twins averages 70% when various studies are combined. The concordance rate in Dizygotic twins is approximately 20%. This is significantly higher than that found in the general population, but still 2 to 4 times lower than the concordance in monozygotic twins. These studies prove that, although environmental factors do play a role in mood disorders (the concordance is not 100%), heredity has a major role.

The two characteristic sleep disturbances in depression are \"early morning awakening\" and \"reduced latency of REM sleep\". B) Interest (loss): Patient looses interest in the activities which used to interest him earlier (anhedonia). C) Guilt: Patient may have excessive guilt feelings and may blame himself for tril matters. D) Energy (lack): Patient may have decreased energy levels and easy fatigability. E) Cognition/Concentration: Patient may have negative cognitions (negative thoughts) and may have poor concentration. F) Appetite: Usually the appetite and weight are lost, in some patients weight gain may be seen. G) Psychomotor agitation or retardation: The term 'psychomotor' refers to the changes in motor activity secondary to psychological causes. It may be increased (e. g. in restless patients) or may be decreased (e. g. a patient who keeps on lying on the bed and rarely gets up). H) Suicidal thoughts and sadness of mood (depressed mood).

There is some evidence that a functional polymorphism in the serotonin transporter (5- HTT) gene may interact with stressful life events to markedly increase risk of depression and suicide. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies show decreased metabolic activity in the caudate nuclei and frontal lobes in depressed patients that returns to normal with recovery. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies show comparable changes in blood flow.# Postmortem examination of brains of suicide victims indicate altered noradrenergic activity.# Diurnal variations in symptom severity and alterations in circadian rhythmicity of a number of neurochemical and neurohumoral factors suggest that biologic differences may be secondary to a primary defect in regulation of biologic rhythms. Patients with major depression show consistent findings of a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep onset (REM latency), an increase in REM density, and, in some subjects, a decrease in stage IV delta slow-wave sleep.",

An episode may be characterized by sadness, indifference, apathy, or irritability and is usually associated with: changes in sleep patterns, appetite, and weight; motor agitation or retardation; fatigue; impaired concentration and decision-making; feelings of shame or guilt; and thoughts of death or dying. Patients with depression have a profound loss of pleasure in all enjoyable activities, exhibit early morning awakening, feel that the dysphoric mood state is qualitatively different from sadness, and of- ten notice a diurnal variation in mood (worse in morning hours). Some chronic disorders of uncertain etiology, such as chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia, are strongly associated with depression and anxiety; patients may benefit from antidepressant treatment, usually at lower than normal dosing.",

Beginning in the late part of the 19th century, depression was seen as prominent component of clinical hypothyroidism, although other psychiatric symptoms were often present. As a result of the inverse relationship between thyroid function and depression observed in endocrine patients, it was hoped that thyroid hormones-particularly thyroid hormone deficiency-might be a biological factor in the etiology of unipolar and bipolar mood disorders. Thyroid hormones are used in psychiatry, either alone or as augmentation, to treat persons with depression or rapid-cycling bipolar I disorder. They can convert an antidepressant-nonresponsive person into an antidepressant-responsive person.",
