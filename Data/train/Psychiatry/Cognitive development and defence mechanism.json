Male development-The boy develops castration anxiety (fear of castration at the hand of his father in retaliation for the boy's desire to replace his father in his mother's affections). This leads to the formation of the Oedipus complex (aggressive impulses directed towards the father; named after the Greek tragedy Oedipus Rex in which Oedipus unknowingly kills his father and marries his mother, unaware of their true identities). Oedipus complex is usually resolved by identification with father, attempting to adopt his characteristics. Female development- The girl develops penis envy (discontent with female genitalia following a fantasy that they result from loss of penis). This is theorised by Freud to lead to a wish to 'receive' the penis and to bear a child. Resolution occurs by identification with the mother. This phase has been called an Electra complex.
