        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Freud o Structural theory of mind (the id, ego and superego) was given by sigmund freud. Structural theory of mindo Freud coined the term \"The Ego and The Id\", and divided the mental apparatus (Personality) into three dynamic structures: -The Id:- The id is the only component of personality that is present from birth. This aspect of personality is entirely unconscious and includes the instinctive and primitive reflexive behavior. The Id is the source of all psychic energy, making it the primary component of personality. The id is driven by the pleasure principle, which strives for immediate gratification of all desires, wants, and needs. If these needs are not satisfied immediately, the result is a state anxiety or tension. For example, an increase in hunger or thirst should produce an immediate attempt to eat or drink. The id is very important early in life, because it ensures that an infant's needs are met. If the infant is hungry, he or she will cry until the demands of id are met. The Ego:- The ego is the component of personality that is responsible for dealing with reality. The ego develops from the id and ensures that the impulses of the id can be expressed in manner acceptable in the real world. The ego functions in conscious, preconscious and unconscious mind. The ego operates based on the reality principle, which strives to satisfy1 the Id's desires in realistic and socially appropriate ways. The superego:- The last component of personality to develop is the superego. The superego is the aspect of personality that holds all of our internalized moral standards and ideals that we acquire from both parents and society. Our sense of right and wrong. The superego based on idealism principle and acts to perfect and civilize our behavior. It works to supress all unacceptable urge of id, i. e.. It tries to prove or disprove the urge of Id, and struggles to make the ego act upon idealistic standards rather than upon realistic principles. The activities of superego occur largely unconscious. There are two components of superego: -The ego ideal: - Includes rules and standard for good behaviors. These behaviors include those which approved of by parental and other authority figures. Obeying these rules leads to feeling pride, value and accomplishment. The conscience: - Include information about things that are viewed as bad by parents and society. These behaviours are often forbidden and lead to bad consequences, punishments or feeling of guilt or remorse.",
