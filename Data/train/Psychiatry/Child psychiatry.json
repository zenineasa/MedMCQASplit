Estimates of lifetime occurrence of grand mal seizures ranges between 4 and 32 percent. Recent neuroimaging studies suggest a pattern of increased and then decreased rate of brain growth over time; increased total brain volume is noted in many individuals with autism. Ventricular enlargement on CT scan is observed in 20 to 25 percent of individuals with autism. Although no EEG findings are specific for autism, abnormalities are common in the disorder; estimates of prevalence of EEG abnormalities range from 10 to 83 percent, and failure of cerebral lateralization is a typical finding. One-third of children with autism demonstrate elevated serum serotonin levels; the significance of this finding is uncertain, particularly given similar rates of hyperserotonemia in children with severe mental retardation.",

Head circumference at birth is normal, and early developmental milestones, including social interactions, are unremarkable. Between 6 and 48 months, most commonly between 6 and 12 months, a progressive encephalopathy develops. Head growth begins to decelerate, with resultant microcephaly. Motor abnormalities occur; purposeful hand movements are lost, and characteristic midline hand movements, such as hand wringing, emerge. Gait and truncal apraxia, ataxia, and poor coordination develop in the preschool years. Expressive and receptive language skills deteriorate and are associated with marked mental retardation (not normal intelligence). A loss of social interactional skills is observed during the preschool years. The etiology of the disease is unknown. A genetic basis for the condition is likely; Rett syndrome occurs only in girls, and case reports indicate complete concordance in monozygotic twins. Associated features include seizures (occurring in up to 75% of affected patients) and irregular respiration with episodes of hyperventilation, apnea, and breath holding.",

(Ref: Kaplan & Sadock's Synopsis of Psychiatry, Xth/Ch. 43, Page no, 1208.)A 7-year-old child has conservative behavior, not playing quietly with peers, and difficulty in organization. He also interrupts others in school and easily gets distracted. The most likely diagnosis is ADHD (Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Kaplan, pg. 576............ \"Excessive motor activity, usually with intrusive and annoying qualities, poor sustained attention, difficulties inhibiting impulsive behaviors in social situations and on cognitive tasks, and difficulties with peers are the main characteristics of ADHD, combined type. Symptoms must be present in two or more settings (in this case, home and school) and must cause significant impairment. The Rx of choice for ADHD is CNS stimulants, primarily detroamphetamine, methylphenidate, and pemoline.**. Discussion: Conduct disorder# Children with conduct disorder display a persistent disregard for rules and other people's rights that lasts at least one year.# Aggression toward people and animals, destruction of property, deceit and illegal activities, and frequent truancy from school are the main characteristics of the disorder.# Patients with antisocial personality disorder display a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others since the age of 15 years, with evidence of a conduct disorder before age 15. Substance abuse is just one facet of conduct disorder.# Children with oppositional defiant disorder are problematic and rebellious but do not routinely engage in aggressive, destructive, or illegal activities. Autistic disorder# Autistic disorder is characterized by lack of interest in social interactions, severely impaired verbal and nonverbal communication, stereotyped behaviors, and a very restricted range of interests.# Children with autism do not involve themselves in imaginative and imitative play and can spend hours lining and spinning things or dismantling toys and putting them together.# Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder may spend hours on repetitive tasks (such as lining up toys) but do not show the difficulties with language and social interaction that this patient displays.# Patients with Asperger's syndrome show no clinically significant delay in spoken or receptive language development, making this diagnosis unlikely.# Patients with Rett's disorder by the age of 5 would be expected to have microcephaly and a disordered gait (unsteady and stiff). Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Onset before age 12. Limited attention span and poor impulse control. Characterized by hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or inattention in multiple settings (school, home, places of worship, etc.). Normal intelligence, but commonly coexists with difficulties in school. Continues into adulthood in as many as 50% of individuals. Associated with*frontal lobe volume/ metabolism. Treatment: methylphenidate, amphetamines, atomoxetine, behavioral interventions (reinforcement, reward). Conduct disorder. Repetitive and pervasive behavior violating the basic rights of others (e. g,, physical aggression, destruction of property, theft). After age 18, many of these patients will meet criteria for diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder. Enduring pattern of hostile, defiant behavior toward authority figures in the absence of serious violations of social norms. Tourette syndrome. Onset before age 18. Characterized by sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic, stereotyped motor and vocal tics that persist for > 1 year. Lifetime prevalence of 0. 1-1. 0% in the general population. Coprolalia (involuntary obscene speech) found in only 10-20% of patients. Associated with OCD and ADHD. Treatment: antipsychotics and behavioral therapy. Separation anxiety disorder. Common onset at 7-9 years. Overwhelming fear of separation from home or loss of attachment figure. May lead to factitious physical complaints to avoid going to or staying at school. Treatment: SSRIs and relaxation techniques/behavioral interventions.",

        "exp": "PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS (AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER):- These are group of neurodevelopmental or neurobehavioral disorders, which are characterized by disturbance of social interaction, abnormalities of communication and restricted behaviors. Autism (Childhood autism, autistic disorder):- It is a neurodevelopmental disorder (neurobehavioral disorder) with a strong genetic basis. The onset is before the age of 3 years. Chromosome 7, 2, 4, 15 and 19 have been found to contribute to the disorder. Fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, congenital rubella and phenylketonuria are associated with autism and are found with high frequency in children with autistic disorders. Around 70% of children with autism have comorbid mental retardation. The prevalence of perinatal insults like bih asphyxia has also been found to be higher in children with autism. symptoms:- * Impairment in social interaction: The patients with autism have impaired reciprocal social skills. As infants they have poor eye contact, lack social smile and anticipatory posture (the posture which the kid assumes when he wants to be picked up). They may have poor attachment to their parents and other impoant persons and may not acknowledge their presence (e. g. they won't come running to meet when the father returns to home after office). However, if the routine of these children is disturbed (e. g. if someone rearranges the furniture in their room), they may show excessive reaction. When they grow up, they may have difficulty in making friends and getting into a romantic relationship. * Impairment of communication and language: These children usually have significant delay in language milestones, whereas the motor milestones are usually normally achieved. The patients also have development of abnormal language such as difficulty in making sentences properly (aiculation difficulties) and pronoun reversals (using \"me\" instead of \"you\"). * Restricted, repetitive and stereotyped behavior: The activities and play of these children tend to be repetitive and boring. They may show stereotyped behaviors like hand wringing, spinning and banging. These children are quite resistant to changes and may become extremely upset if their routines are disturbed (e. g. bathing routine is changed or furnitures are rearranged in the room). These restrictive behaviors usually result from a lack of imagination and creativity. Apa from these three characteristic features, the patients with autism also have abnormal responses to stimuli. They may have a higher threshold for pain and may show intense interest in some sounds (like that of a ticking watch) and may totally ignore other sounds. They may also have self destructive behaviors like head banging, biting, scratching, etc. Precocious skills or islets of precocity: Some individuals with autism may have skills in ceain areas, which are much higher than their normal peers. For example, hyperlexia (early ability to ready very well), extremely good remote memory or calculating ability, etc. Treatment:- Educational interventions such as a structured classroom teaching along with use of behavioral therapy is the recommended treatment. The role of medications is limited. Atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and aripiprazole have been used to reduce aggressive and self injurious behavior.
