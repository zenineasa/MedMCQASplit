Bipolar disorder can be categorized into: - Bipolar I: - Episodes of mania and major depression with euthymic (normal mood) in between. Bipolar II: - Episodes of hypomania (rather than mania) and major depression. o Cyclothymic disorder It is a more subdued version of bipolar disorder, characterized by depressive spells and hypomanic times that never have sufficient intesity or duration to meet full diagnostic measure. It has to be chronic (2 years or more). Note: As the duration is > 2 years, cyclothymia is also considered as persistent mood disorder, o Bipolar NOS (not otherwise specified): - Episodes of mania and depression that can't fit into any other bipolar categories. o Some genes play an important role in bipolar mood disorder. Genes on long arm of chromosome 18 fp. Gt94> may plav a role in some families. Other chromosome involved are 22 and 21. The current episode in bipolar mood disorder is specified as one of the following 1. Hypomania 2. Mania without psychotic features 3. Mania with psychotic fetures 4. Mild or Moderate depression 5. Severe depression with psychotic symptoms 6. Severe depression without psychotic symptoms 7. Mixed, or 8. In remission",

REF: Kaplan 8f Sadock's Synopsis of Psychiatry: Behavioral Sciences/Clinical Psychiatry, 10th Edition, American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 4th edition.

Dysthymic disorder2 years. Cyclothymic disorder2 years. Manic episode1 week. Mixed episode1 week. Hypomanic episode4 days. Rapid cycling bipolar IAt least 4 episodes/year. Slow cyclers bipolar I1-3 episodes/year. Postpartum mood disturbance. Onset within 4 weeks postpartum. DSM-IV-TR Criteria for Manic EpisodeA distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, lasting at least 1 week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary). During the period of mood disturbance, three (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable) and have been present to a significant degree: Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. Decreased need for sleep (e. g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep). More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. Distractibility (i. e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli). Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation. Excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e. g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments). The symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in occupational functioning or in usual social activities or relationships with others, or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features. The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e. g., a drug of abuse, a medication, or other treatment) or a general medical condition (e. g., hyperthyroidism). Note: Manic-like episodes that are clearly caused by somatic antidepressant treatment (e. g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy, and light therapy) should not count toward a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.",
