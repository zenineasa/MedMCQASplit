        "exp": "(D) Risperidone[?]RISPERIDONE is one of the atypical neuroleptics most likely to induce hyperprolactinemia. Mechanism: Dopamine acts on the pituitary as an inhibitor of prolactin secretion. Blockade of dopamine D2 receptors by risperidone can cause hyperprolactinemia in males and females. Other atypical antipsychotics do not cause sustained hyperprolactinemia because of their lower affinity for D2 receptors. Combination of D2+5-HT2 receptor blockade. In addition it has high affinity for. Alpha 1. Alpha2 & H1 receptors. Blockade of these may contribute to efficacy as well as side effects like postural hypotension. Risperidone is more potent D2 blocker than clozapine; extrapyramidal side effects are less only at low doses (<6mg/day). Prolactin levels rise during risperidone therapy, but it is less epileptogenic than clozapine. Caution: Increased risk of stroke in the elderly. Risperidone Side Effects: Prolactin elevation, probably greater than that seen with the typical neuroleptics. Agitation: This can look like akathisia, or it may present as hypomania or mania. It is unclear whether these reports represent true side effects of the atypicals or coincidental exacerbations of the patient's underlying condition. Anxiety, insomnia, headache & nausea. Weight gain and the metabolic syndrome - low to medium risk. About other options: Clozapine: almost no effects. Olanzapine, ziprasidone: limited effects.

Pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders includes the use of benzodiazepines, beta blockers, buspirone and anti depressants. Antidepressants are among the most effective antianxiety agents available. SSRIs have been shown to help reduce or prevent various forms of anxiety, including panic anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and social anxiety. Most treatment algorithms begin treatment of each of these disorders with an SSRI. Serotonin-Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine has been shown in randomized, controlled trials to be as effective as SSRIs in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and generalized social anxiety disorder. Beta blockers like propranalol and atenolol are particularly useful in management of anticipatory anxiety (anxiety occurring before going on stage, or before examinations). Buspirone is an anti anxiety drug which does not have any dependence potential, unlike benzodiazepines. Note on anxiety disorders. Anxiety is the commonest psychiatric symptom in clinical practice and anxiety disorders are one of the commonest psychiatric disorders in general population. 1) Generalised anxiety disorder: This is characterized by an insidious onset in the third decade and a stable, usually chronic course which may or may not be punctuated by panic attacks. The symptoms of anxiety should last tor at least a period of 6 months for a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder to be made. It is the commonest psychiatric disorder in the population. 2) Panic disorder: This is characterized by discrete episodes of acute anxiety. Panic disorder can either present alone or with agoraphobia. Note on phobias. Phobia is defined as an irrational fear of a specific object. situation or activity, often leading to persistant avoidance of the feared object situation or activity, often leading to persistant avoidance of the feared object situation or activity. The common type of phobias are: a) Agoraphobia-It is the commonest type of phobia encountered in clinical practice. lt is characterized by an irrational fear of being in places away from the familiar setting of home. It includes fear of open spaces. public spaces, crowded spaces and any other place from where there is no easy escape to a safe place. A full blown attack may occur (agoraphobia with panic disorder) or only a few symptoms(like dizziness or tachycardia) may occur (agoraphobia without panic disorder)SSRIs are currently the drugs of choice. with paroxetine being the most widely used drug. \"Nomophobia\"-one of the latest additions to the phobia list.

Use of lithium in treating adolescent mania has been supported in many open trials. (Option a). Divalproex is used frequently to treat bipolar disorder in children and adolescents. (Option b). Quetiapine is at least as effective as divalproex in treating acute manic symptoms. Reduction of symptoms occurred more quickly with quetiapine compared with divalproex. Propranolol (Inderal) has been chosen as an agent to control aggression in open trials, although no evidence supports its use in children and adolescents. Carbamazepine (Tegretol) has not been shown to be effective in controlling aggression in child and adolescent conduct disorders. (Option d). About carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine (page 379). Carbamazepine has been used worldwide for decades as a first-line treatment for acute mania but has only gained approval in the United States in 2004. Typical doses of carbamazepine to treat acute mania range between 600 and 1, 800 mg/day associated with blood levels of between 4 and 12 pg/mL. Oxcarbazepine (keto congener of carbamazepine), possess similar antimanic properties as carbamazepine. Higher doses than those of carbamazepine are required because 1, 500 mg of oxcarbazepine approximates 1, 000 mg of carbamazepine. Thus based on above discussion oxcarbazepine seems to be possible answer",

Refinements of magnetic stimulators, including the development of stimulators capable of discharging at frequencies up to 60. Hz (referred to as rapid-rate TMS ) have allowed focal stimulation of the CNS to estimate motor thresholds and determine hemispheric language dominance. r. TMS was found to benefit some patients with Parkinson's disease, and some patients with Parkinson's disease exhibited improved mood after r. TMS. Additionally, subjects exposed to r. TMS for purposes of determining hemispheric language dominance exhibited affective responses after stimulation of the left frontal cortex. These observations suggest that r. TMS may have therapeutic potential in psychiatry and may allow focal stimulation of areas most involved in affective states. In one of the best studies to date, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation significantly improved depression ratings in 11 of 17 patients with psychotic major depression. r. TMS appears to be well tolerated and does not require general anesthesia. Seizures may be a side effect in some patients but do not appear to be required for therapeutic effects. TMS is performed using a high-speed magnetic stimulator that generates a 1. 5- to 2. 5-Tesla field for brief periods. This field is similar to that used for nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. r. TMS stimulus is delivered at frequencies of 10to60. Hz using a figure 8-shaped coil that is placed over the desired region of the skull and cooled continuously with water to prevent overheating. Patients and staff usually wear earplugs because of the noise generated by the stimulator. Stimulation is typically given several times per session and is repeated over several days to weeks.",

NRTs are meant to be used for a short period of time and should be tapered down to a low dose before stopping. NRTs increase the chance of stopping smoking by 50to60% compared to placebo or to no treatment. There is no side effects reported other than local slight irritation and rarely non-ischemic chest pain. Antidepressants: The antidepressant bupropion is considered a first-line medication for smoking cessation and has been shown in many studies to increase long-term success rates. People who take bupropion should be monitored for any unusual mood changes; bupropion also increases risk of seizures and should not be used in people with a seizure disorder. Varenicline decreases the urge to smoke and reduces withdrawal symptoms and is therefore considered a first-line medication for smoking cessation. A 2016 Cochrane review of 27 studies also found that the number of people stopping smoking with varenicline was higher than with bupropion or NRT.

Elderly persons, particularly if they have organic brain disease, are especially susceptible to the side effects of antipsychotics, which include dry mouth, tardive dyskinesia, akathisia, and a toxic confusional state. Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by disfiguring and involuntary buccal and lingual masticatory movements; akathisia is a restlessness marked by a compelling need for constant motion. Choreiform body movements, which are spasmodic and involuntary movements of the limbs and the face, and rhythmic extension and flexion movements of the fingers may also be noticeable. Examination of the patient's protruded tongue for fine tremors and vermicular (worm-like) movements is a useful diagnostic procedure. A toxic confusional state, also called a central anticholinergic syndrome, is characterized by a marked disturbance in short-term memory, impaired attention, disorientation, anxiety, visual and auditory hallucinations, increased psychotic thinking, and peripheral anticholinergic side effects.",
