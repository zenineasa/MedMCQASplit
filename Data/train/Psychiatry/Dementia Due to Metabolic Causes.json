Apraxia (inability to do which were done with ease before). Executive dysfunction (unable to perform the previously performed. dearned activities). Dementia is basically due to degeneration of neurons of brain. Depending upon the site, it may be cortical (Alzheimer's disease) or subcortical (Parkinson's disease) or mixed (Vascular/Multi-infarct dementia). While the degeneration is progressive, sometimes if the cause is removed or treated, the dementia resolves. Hence, depending upon the \"reversibility\", there are1.
