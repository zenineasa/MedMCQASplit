Later even remote memory is affected. Confabulation is common. 2) Impairment of intellectualfunction:- Disorientation (particularly to time), impaired attention & concentration. 3) Impairementt of thinking and judgement:- Thinking becomes slower and abstract thinking may be impaired. Delusions and paranoid thoughts may develop. 4) Deterioration of personality and personal care - The patient becomes solvently in dress and demenour. Clothes become unkempt and stained and are not worn properly. 5) Impairment of language:- There is difficulty in word finding and a reduced functional vocabulary in speech. Perseveration and echolalia can occur. 6) Catastrophic reactions:- Some people with dementia overreact to a trivial setback or a minor criticism.

Apraxia (inability to do which were done with ease before). Executive dysfunction (unable to perform the previously performed. dearned activities).
