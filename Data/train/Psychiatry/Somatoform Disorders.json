One sexual symptom4. One pseudoneurologic symptom. All the symptoms are not intentionally produced or feigned. Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Delayed and protracted response to an exceptionally stressful or catastrophic situation or life event which causes pervasive distress in almost any person (e. g. natural calamities/disasters, wars, rape, torture or serious accident). It is characterized by recurrent and intrusive recollections of stressful event either in flashbacks or dreams. Associated sense of experiencing of stressful event with anxiety and increased arousal. Partial amnesia, feeling of numbness and anhedonia. Depersonalization disorder. It is a dissociative disorder, diagnosed when patients report feeling detached from their mental processes or body (e. g. feelings as if they are in dream), however patient accurately report who they are and what is going around them, but it results in significant distress or impairment in functioning. Depression. The diagnosis of depression should be considered in any geriatric patient who complains about increasing levels of somatic concern. An important point is that although many patients and clinicians believe that depression is a normal feature of a terminal illness, most terminally ill patients do not become depressed.",
