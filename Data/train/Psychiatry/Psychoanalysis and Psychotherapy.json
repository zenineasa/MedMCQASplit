        "exp": "Ans is 'b' i. e. Doctor's feelings towards the patient Transference. Transference is the phenomenon whereby unconsciously transfer feelings and attitudes from a person or situation in the past on to a person or situation in the present. The process is at least partly inappropriate to the present. Characteristic features of Transference. Transference is unconscious. It is at least partly inappropriate to the present. It is the transferring of a relationship, not a person. Only an aspect of a relationship, not the entire relationship, is transferred. Points to note. The process of transference is not conscious, and the patient unwittingly projects a needed aspect of a previously experienced or wished-for relationship on to doctor. Because it is a relationship that is \"transferred\", the patient and doctor are expected to take complementary roles. So a patient who is afraid that he or she is seriously ill may adopt a helpless child-like role and project an omnipotent parent-like quality on to the doctor, who is then expected to provide a solution. Projection and transference. Transference involves the projection of a mental representation of previous experience on to the present. Other people are treated as though they are playing the complementary role needed for the projected relationship. There are subtle (unconscious) behavioural \"nudges\" to take on these feelings and behaviours. Examples to explain transference. Suppose a patient is in a session with a therapist and the therapist says something that sets him of and he get way angry at him. He lash back with anger and says things that really have nothing to do with him at all. He has said something that triggers another relationship from the past and that anger from the old relationship gets transferred onto him. Another example is love transference and this is very common in therapyA lady patient go to see therapist and starts having strong feelings about him. He reminds her of someone from the past - her father and now seems to be transferring feelings that she had towards her father on to the therapist and she wants him to meet the needs that she had towards daddy. Countertransference. Definition. Countertransference is the response that is elicited in the recipient (therapist) by the other9s (patient9s) unconscious transference communications. Countertransference response includes both feelings and associated thoughts. When transference feeling are not an important part of the therapeutic relationship, there can obviously be no countertransference. Countertransference. Includes the feelings evoked in the doctor by the patient's transference projections. These can be a useful guide to the patient's expectations of relationships. They are easier to identify if they are not congruent with the doctor's personality and expectation of his or her role. Awareness of the transference-countertransference relationship allows reflection and thoughtful response rather than unthinking reaction from the doctor. The degree to which the projected role is congruent with some aspect of the personality of the recipient will affect the likelihood of his or her adoptions it. An understanding of transference and countertransference is essential to good practice in psychiatry. Being aware of the hidden agenda in the clinical relationship will help the doctor recognize some of the patients wishes and fears which are not full conscious and which can contribute to conflict or intense dependency. The doctor is then more likely to stand back a little from patients emotional demand and avoid getting caught up in agenda. Mr D was a young man with a long history of unstable relationships, depressive episodes and alcohol misuse attending a day hospital. He was often hostile to his keyworker whom he accused of not caring whether he lived or died. The keyworker was an experienced community psychiatric nurse and was confident that she was neither negligent nor uncaring about her patient. She was aware that Mr D projected a scenario in which he was neglected and at risk, while she was experienced as a callous uncaring parent. Her recognition of this transference allowed her to remain calm and supportive and not to retaliate.<< A role may be congruent with an aspect of the therapist's personality and he or she may unconsciously accept and collude with the projection. Ms E had a long history of repeated treatment episodes for eating disorder, depression and relationship problems. Following a move to university, the university general practitioner referred her to the local psychiatric service for treatment. She confided in the young SHO that he was the first doctor to whom she had been able to talk freely, and that she had told him things she had never told previous doctors. The doctor enjoyed this idealisation and accepted that he had a special relationship with the patient.",

Amongst the TCA only clomipramine is effective as it is the most selective for serotonin reuptake versus norepinephrine reuptake and is exceeded in this respect only by the SSRIs. Other drugs which can be added, if patient is not responding to clomipramine or SSRIs, are Valproate, Carbamazapine, Lithium, venlafaxine, Pindolol, MAOIs, buspirone and clonazepam. 2) Behavior therapy; - Most commonly used behavior therapy is exposure and response prevention. Other behavior techniques are systemic desensitization, Flooding, thought stopping, aversive conditioning and implosion therapy. 3) Psychotherapy: - Psychoanalytic psychotherapy is used in certain selected patients who are psychologically oriented. Supportive psychotherapy must include attention to family members through provision of emotional support, reassurance, explanation and advice on how to manage and respond to the patient. 4) ECT: - For extreme cases that are resistant and chronically debilitating, ECT (VPSC09) and psychosurgery are considerations. 5) Psychosurgery: - Psychosurgery can be used in treatment of OCD that has become intractable, and is not responding to other methods of treatment.

Psychosurgery, Vagal Nerve Stimulation, Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Deep Brain Stimulation are other physical methods. ECT is very effective in treating: Severe depression with suicidality. Catatonia. Mania/Excitement. OCD (intractable cases). The exact mechanism of action of ECT is not known but it has been hypothesized that direct stimulation of neurons by current and / or activation of HPA axis / HPT axis or enhancement of certain neurotransmitters like serotonin are proposed. Whatever the mechanism. ECT is not only effective but also rapid in its effect (drugs might take days and psychotherapy might take months to show efficacy) and safe also. Contraindications: 1. Absolute contraindication. Raised intracranial pressure (the ONLY absolute contraindication) as evidenced by papilledema clinically. 2. Relative contraindications (which means, the following conditions should be treated adequately and patient should be fit) - Hypertension. Diabetes. Sepsis, etc. Types of ECT: 1. Unmodified (No anaesthesia). 2. Modified (under general anaesthesia). Drugs Used in ECT: 1. IV anaesthetic agents like methohexiatone. thiopentone sodium and propofal2.

        "question": "A male patient of bipolar disorder with history of 5 episodes of mania and 1 episode of depression in last 8 years, under control by mood stabilizer, and manic symptoms appear as he tapered down the drugs. Which of the following intervention should be carried out to improve drug compliance?",
        "exp": "Ans. a. Psychoeducation (Ref: Niraj Ahuja 7/e p67-68). In the question patient symptoms of bipolar disorder are well controlled by medication, which implies pharmacotherapy is efficient and added psychotherapy is necessary only to keep the patient compliant to the medication. In such a case, psychoeducation of the patient about adherence to strict treatment is most crucial psychotherapy modality in preventing relapse. Psychoeducation. Psychoeducation refers to the education offered to individuals with a mental health condition & their families to help empower them & deal with their condition in an optimal way. Frequently psychoeducational training involves individuals with schizophrenia, clinical depression, anxiety disorders, psychotic illnesses, eating disorders, and personality disorders, as w ell as patient training courses in context of the treatment of physical illnesses. Family members are also included. A goal is for the consumer to understand and be better able to deal with the presented illness. Also, the patient's own capabilities, resources & coping skills are strengthened & used to contribute to their own health & well-being on a long-term basis. Since it is often difficult for the patient and their family members to accept the patient's diagnosis, psychoeducation also has the function of contributing to the destigmatization of psychological disturbances and to diminish barriers to treatment. The relapse risk is in this way lowered: patients & family members, who are more well- informed about the disease, feel less helplessQ. Important elements in psychoeducation are: Information transfer (symptomatology of the disturbance, causes, treatment concepts, etc.). Emotional discharge (understanding to promote, exchange of experiences with others concerning, contacts, etc.). Support of a medication or psychotherapeutic treatment, as cooperation is promoted between the mental health professional and patient (compliance, adherence). Assistance to self-help (e. g. training, as crisis situations are promptly recognized and what steps should be taken to be able to help the patient). Supportive Psychotherapy. It is a psychotherapeutic approach that integrates psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, & interpersonal conceptual models & techniques. The objective of the therapist is to reinforce the patient's healthy & adaptive patterns of thought behaviors in order to reduce the intrapsychic conflicts that produce symptoms of mental disorders. Unlike in psychoanalysis, in which the analyst works to maintain a neutral demeanor as a 'blank canvas' for transference, in supportive therapy, the therapist engages in a fully emotional, encouraging, and supportive relationship with the patient as a method of furthering healthy defense mechanisms, especially in the context of interpersonal relationships. This therapy has been used for patients suffering from severe cases of addiction as well as bulimia nervosa, stress and other mental illnesses. Supportive psychotherapy is used as an initial therapy, to be reduced and not to be prolonged, in situations or periods where there is a lack of means for a systematic approach or behaviorism. Examples of such situations include: Critical negotiations. Volatile but unavoidable everyday life or decisive situations. Compromises (to introduce at least minimal operational, efficient relationship conditions) in long-term, engaged relationships, based on lasting agreements. Insight-oriented Psychotherapy. It relies on conversation between the therapist & client. It helps people through understanding & expressing feelings, motivations, beliefs, fears and desires. As insight-oriented psychotherapy is a client-centered therapy, it is assumed that the client is healthy & his/her problem is a result of faulty thinking. During the therapy, the patient talks about what is on his/her mind and the therapist looks for patterns in situations in which the patient might feel stress or anxiety. Patients typically wish to explore their anxiety more deeply because of a belief that deeper exploration will lead to change. Insight-oriented psychotherapy can refer to: Psychoanalysis, a method of treatment of mental disorders by using talk-therapy to discover and process unconscious thoughts and desires. Psychodynamic psychotherapy, a more-brief & less intensive type of talk therapy that uses psychoanalytic theory & methods.",
