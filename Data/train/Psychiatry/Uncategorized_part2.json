Panic disorder must be differentiated from a number of medical conditions that produce similar symptomatology. Panic attacks are associated with a variety of endocrinological disorders, including both hypo- and hypehyroid states, hyperparathyroidism, and pheochromocytomas. Episodic hypoglycemia associated with insulinomas can also produce panic-like states, as can primary neuropathological processes. Disorders of the cardiac and pulmonary systems, including arrhythmias, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma, can produce autonomic symptoms and accompanying crescendo anxiety that can be difficult to distinguish from panic disorder.",

Somatoform disorders The somatoform disorders are heterogenous group that have common presenting feature suggestive of physical illness, symptoms or preoccupation. As a feature of this group the symptoms are unexplained by general medical condition or are dispropoionate to symptoms that might be expected from a general medical condition. - To establish one of the these diagnosis the clinician must rule out accult physical disorders that might better explain the symptoms. Types of somatoform disoreders Category Key characteristics * Multiple symptoms - pain, gastrointestinal, sexual dysfunction Somatization * Symptoms vary over time disorder * Chronic condition-often with extensive treatment history * Not intentional * Symptoms affect voluntary motor or sensory system * Symptoms do not conform to neuroanatomic structures Conversion disorder * May reflect, symbolically, past or current stressor * Patient may not be upset by the symptoms * Not intentional * Chronic preoccupation with having a serious disease Hypochondriasis * Patient misattributes symptom or test results. * Preoccupation not solely due to affective status Body dysmorphic * Preoccupation with an imagined defect in physical appearance Disorder * May exaggerate mild anomay Chronic pain * Pain is the central anomaly Syndrome * May begin after specific injury * Can lead to serious functional impairment and medication overuse Somatization disorder Previously somatiation disorder was referred to as hysteria or Briquet's syndrome. It is a chronic fluctuating condition that usually begins after the age of 30 and extends over many years. The patient presents with multiple symptoms, including pain, gastrointestinal symtpmatology, neurologic symptoms and sexual dysfunction, which may vary considerably over time. He or she may have a long history of past extensive treatment including surgery. Typically, the patient seeks out multiple providers because of dissatisfaction with prior treatment, and may end up on complex combinations of medications because of frustration on the pa of both patient and physician Significant impairment in work and social. functioning are common Criteria for somatization disorder As described in the Diagnostic and statistical Manual-IV -Patients should have a history of pain in at least four different sites. - Two different gastrointestinal symptoms other than pain. - At least one sexual symptom, and one neurologic symptom. Conversion disorder Conversion disorder presents with deficits of the voluntary motor or sensory neurologic system and often mimic recognized neurologic or other medical conditions. As with somatization disorder the symptoms are not intentionally produced; often, the underlying psychological factors are expressed in physical symptoms. Common presentations include loss of sensation in a single limb or pa of a limb, double vision blindness, deafness, difficulty with swallowing and paralysis. On careful exam, the symptoms typically do not conform to recognized anatomic pathways. Pain disorders Pain disorders are characterized by a specific, predominant focus on pain as the presenting symptom. The pain usually does not. follow established anatomic patterns. However, if may be impossible to differentiate from established medical conditions such as lumbar disc disease. Although work-ups typically are negative, prior invasive treatment may lead to physical. findings that completely muddy the diagnosis. Indeed, pain disorders may develop after prior injury or treatment, which provides some pathophysiologic explanation. for the symptoms. Pain disorders may occur throughout the lifespan and are more common in women than man. The course may be persistent and lead to severe. functional impairment and extensive use of pain medication.",

CNS - Stimulant medication- Remain the drugs of choice in the pharmacological treatment; d/t significant efficacy, and excellent safety records.- Sustained release preparations are preferred d/t single doseand no rebound irritability.- FDA approves use of dextroamphetamine in children 3 years old and older and methyl phenidate in children 6 years old and olderQ. These are two most commonly used treatments for children.- Drug of 1,, choice methylphenidate is a sho acting medication generally used to be effective during school hours. It's most common side effects are headaches, stomachaches, nausea and insomnia. In some rebound effect (brief period of hyper activity), exacerbation of tic disorder and growth suppression can occur, but children tend to make up the growth when are given drug holidays in the summer or on weekends.- d- enantiomer - dexmethylphenydate (Focalin) is recently introduced to maximize target effects & minimize adverse effects in individuals who obtain paial response from methyl - phenydate. Dextroamphetamine & dextroamphetamine + amphetamine salt combinations are usually the second drugs of choice when methylphenydate is not effective.- Modafinil (provigil), a CNS stimulant, originally developed to reduce day time sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy, has also been tried. Non stimulant medication. Atomoxetine is a presynaptic norepinephrine uptake inhibitor approved by FDA in treatment of ADHD for children age 6 years and above. It is effective for inattention & impulsivity in children and adults. It improves mood and anxiety. Modafinil (provigil) is a ble treatment of ADHD in adolescents. Although stimulants remain the drug of choiceQ, a body of evidence now suppos the use of non stimulants, including atomoxetine and modafinil (Kaplan 1213). Bupropion has been used as both an antidepressant & in the treatment of ADHD- Venlafaxine used especially for children & adolescents with combinations of ADHD and depression or anxiety features.- a adrenergic agonists eg clonidine & guanfacine. Clonidine may be helpful when patients also have tic disorders. Other classes of medications, tricyclic drugs and premoline previously used to treat ADHD are no longer recommended because of potential adverse effects on liver function (premoline), potential cardiac arrhythmia effects (TCA) and sudden death (with desipramine). Very rarely antipsychotics are used to treat refractory hyperactivity in children & adolescents who are severely impaired and do not respond to other treatments. Quetiapine (like risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine, & Ziprasidone) is a serotonin domamine - antagonist (SDA; which is also known as second generation - atypical antipsychotic drugs). All SDAs have a higher ratio of serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) to D2 dopamine receptor blockades and a low D2 receptor blocking effect when compared with typical, conventional dopamine receptor antagonists (DRA). So there is a reduced risk of extrapyramidal side effects. These drugs have proved efficacy as treatments for Schizophrenia & acute maniaQ. Quetiapine is also used in bipolar depression, insomnia, on aggression in children with autism, childhood or adolescent antisocial behaviour (with episodes of explosive behaviour, aggression and violent out bursts), conduct disorders, and for schizophrenia and mania in children & adolescent.",

When sitting, the patient constantly shifts his body and legs, crosses and uncrosses his legs, and swings the free leg. Running in place and persistent pacing are also characteristic. This abnormality of movement is most prominent in the lower extremities and may not be accompanied, at least in mild forms of akathisia, by perceptible rigidity or other neurologic abnormalities. First noted in patients with Parkinson disease and senile dementia, akathisia is now observed most often in patients receiving neuroleptic drugs. This disorder can be induced in normal individuals by the administration of neuroleptic drugs or L-dopa. Akathisia refers to somatic restlessness which occur in patients treated with first generation antipsychotics.

        "exp": "A i. e. Exposure and Response prevention. Systematic desensitization is behaviour therapy of choice for specific and social phobiasQ whereas exposure and response prevention is behaviour therapy of choice for obscessive- compulsive disorder. QBehavior Therapy (BT). It is a sho duration (6-8 week) therapy based on theories of learning (Skinner's operant and Pavlov's classical conditioning) and assume that all behaviour is learned behaviour. So a behaviour that is followed by a reward (positive reinforcement) is more likely to occur again that behaviour is learned more easily if taught in small steps. It aims at changing maladaptive behaviour & substituting it with adaptive behaviot42. John B. Watson is father of behaviourism and Joseph Wolpe developed systemic desensitization. Types include: Systematic Desensitization (SD) Based on Wolpe's principle of counter conditioning or reciprocal inhibition, whereby a person over comes maladaptive anxiety by appoching the feared situation gradually in a state of complete psycophysiological relaxation It consists of 3 steps: relaxation training, hierarchy construction (i. e. a list is made of situations that provoke increasing degrees of anxiety) and desensitization (i. e. patient proceed systematically through the list from least to most anxiety provoking situation while in a deeply relaxed state)- Works best in clearly identifiable anxiety provoking stimulus such as phobias (simple & social) where it is BT of choiceQ, panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessiove-compulsive disorder (BT of 2. d choice)Q and some sexual disorders. Therapeutic-Graded Exposure Similar to SD, except that relaxation training is not involved & treatment is usually carried out in a real life context to learn firsthand that no dangerous consequences will ensue. Flooding (Implosion)- Patient is exposed to maximum level of feared situation (near the top of hierarchy without a gradual buildup or relaxation exercises, as in SD) from the sta of treatment and remain their until autonomic habituation occurs/ anxiety diminishes. - Premature withdrawal from feared situation or prematurely terminating the fantasized scene (imaginal flooding) is equivalent. Contingency (Reinforcer) ) Contracting & Behaviour Exchange/Contingency Management- Operant is a term used to describe a mechanism by which a behavior operates on environment. In this learning model, behavior is not evoked or elicited (as in classic conditioning) but occurs independently, and environmental responses influence whether the behavior is continued or stopped. For a consequence to change a ceain behavior, the consequence must be contigent on the behavior. Contingency refers to the relationship between a behavior and the events that follow it. A consequence is contingent when it is delivred only after the target behavior is performed and it is otherwise not available. Reinforcement is a contigent event that strengthens the response that it follows (eg a child is given a chocolate when he smiles; the child then smiles again). Reinforcers are always individual (eg food may be reinforcer for a hungry person but not to one who has just finished a large meal). Primary reinf orcers are objects with their own intrinsic or inherent value such as food or water. Secondary reinforcers are objects that have acquired value (eg money). The notion of contingency is iron clad i. e. inconsistent applications of contingencies (such as not giving reward after desired behavior few times) results in poor response acquisition. A behavior may be positively reinforced, negatively reinforced or punished. Positive reinforcement increases the frequency of a paicular resonse by giving something ourable immediately after the response (eg candy). Negative reinforcement increases the frequency of a response by removing an aversive event immediately after response (scoulding / nagging stops after a child cleans his room). Punishment decreases the frequency of a response by either pesenting an aversive event following a response (eg spanking; punishment I) or a removal of a positive event following a response (eg allowance is withdrawn; punishment II). Contingent Action. Positive (+) Event. Negative Event (-). Given. Positive Reinforcement. Punishment ITaken Away. Punishment IINegative Reinforcement. Continuous reinfofcement means that reinforcemnt /punishment is applied every time the behavior occurs. Intermittent reinforcement occurs a/t schedule (eg every 3rd time) whereas, variable reinforcement is randomly determined.- Shaping and Chaining are other operant strategies for acquisition of new behaviors. Shaping is a process of reinforcing (rewarding) successive (gradual) approximations that come increasingly close to a desired behavior goal because they resemble the desired behavior or include a component of desired behavior. For example, in the case of selective mutism, the ultimate goal of treatment would be to have the child speak aloud in full sentences in front of others. Shaping uses a process of slow, small steps to reach this final goal.- Most daily activities require a series of small behaviors or steps that when performed in sequence form a chain. Forward chaining consists of teaching the sequence of behaviors beginning with the initial step in the chain (from 1 to 10). In backward to an escape, that would reinforce both conditioned anxiety & avoidance behaviour andproduce the opposite of desired effect. It works best in specific phobias and is contraindicated when intense anxiety would be hazardous to a patient (eg heart disease or fragile psychological patient). Exposure and Response Prevention. It is BT of choice for obscessional ritualsQ and is based on concept that the urge to carry out rituals diminishes if rituals can berestrained for long periods (- an hour)- Steps include: explaining the rationle of treatment & agreeing targets for exposure with patient --> Modelling (i. e. therapist demonstrates procedure himself) --> initially therapist suppo & accompany patients while they strive to prevent the rituals --> Urge to carry out rituals is made greater by persuading the patient and they do this on their own. Eye Movement Desensitization &Reprocessing- Inducing. Saccadic eye movements (which are rapid oscillation of eyes that occur when person follows rapid side to side moving object) while a person is imagining or thinking about (i. e. exposing to), an anxiety provoking event can yield a positive thought or image that results in decreased anxiety. Used in post traumatic stress disorders & phobias. Thought Stopping and Distraction- Automatic negative thoughts and repetitive, intrusive ruminations are some times too intense to address with purely cognitive interventions. So thought stopping, a behavioural ditraction technique capitalizes on the individuals ability to focusattention away from distressing thoughts by producing a sudden sensory stimulus. For example -Snapping a rubber band on the wrist as a distractor or visualizing a large red stop sign. The command \"stop! \" is paired with the image or snap- It has 4 stages: 1) defining & recording the behaviour to be changed (by another person) 2) identifying the stimuli and reinforcers by recording the events that immediately follow the behaviour, 3) redirecting reinforcement from problem behaviour to desired behaviours eg parents advised to attend less when child shouts & more when quiet, 4) monitoring progress. It relies on principles of 1) controlling over contingency or reinforcer controls behaviour, 2) positive contingency should be desirable & available sholy after the terms of contract have been met 3) terms of contract should be negotiated, specific & straight forward 4) pairing or chaining a high frequency behaviour (eg watching TV) to a low frequency one (eg doing paperwork/house work etc). 1) Reinforcement is a privilege that must be earned2) Good contracts are based on even exchange3) The value of contract is influenced by the reinforcement received4) A contract increases freedom within the relationship for both paies to earn the reinforcement that they deserve- Sta out relatively rich (eg 1 hour TV after 15 minutes of homework) and progressively thinned in time.- Used mainly in t/t of children & people with learning disbility and patients with medication adherence (pairing medication taking with routine activities)Q. - Token Economy (token reinforcement & response cost) Programs are a formalized method of contingency management, which clearly spells out a series of behaviors that are expected (eg making bed, arriving on time, cleaning) and the contingencies for compliance / non-compliance with these behavior goals (i. e. reward or privileges achieved or not respectively). Some programs include response cost (a form of punishment), which is the removal or withdrawl of a reinforcer / reward following in appropriate/problem behavior (eg fining a child for swearing). Imposing fine / response cost is very effective for suppressing undesirable behavior. The combination of token reinforcement and response cost is more effective then either alone. Child Management Training (CMT) is most established contingency managment program that teaches disciplinary skills to parents and includes: 1) how to use reinforcement to change a chld's behavior (positive reinforcement training; 2) how to attend to a desirable behavior to increase its frequency and ignore undesirable behavior to decrease their frequency (eg praising a child when he plays quietly & ignoring a child when he is interrupting); 3) how to give commands and use time outs & response costs. Time out is a punishment by the removal of positive reinforcement. Asseiveness Training- Asseive behaviour enables a person to act in his own best interest, to stand up for himself without undue anxiety, to express honest feelings comfoably & to exercise personal rights without denying the right of others.- By a combination of coaching, modelling (role playing), role reversal, videofeed back etc patients are encouraged to judge the level of self asseion and practise appropriate verbal & non verbal behaviours.- It is usually required for 1) Setting limits on pushy friends or relatives, 2) Social encounters such as being ignored by gossiping shop assistant, countering a sales pitch or being persistent when returning defective merchandise: Problem Solving Skills Training (PST). Impulsive/Careless problem solving, characterized by hurried, impulsive and careless attempts at problem resolution. And avoidant problem solving is procrastination, passivity and over dependence on others to provide solutions. Master's and Johnson's Dual Sex Therapy- Developed by William Masters and Virginia Johnson is a behaviour therapy used for treatment of sexual dysfunctions. In premature ejacutation, semen's squeeze technique and in male erectile disorder or impotence, sensate focus technique (to discover sensate focuses on body excluding genitalia where manipulation leads to sexual arousal); In orgasm and psychosexual disorders, orgasmic conditioning & desensitization are used. Habbit Reversal Training (H)- Has 4 components which include training in 1) becoming aware of onset of behavior (awareness training), 2) monitoring of behaviour and habit control motivation 3) initiating competing responses, that are incompatible with the behavior and inconspicuous (invisible) to others eg fist clenching is incompatable with body focused repetitive behaviours such as hair pulling, nail biting & skin picking (completing response training is the core of H), 4) relaxation & social suppo- Used to treat (reduce) repetitive behaviours (habbits) like tics, Tourette's syndrome, hair pulling, nail bitting & stutteringQ. Positive effects have been repoed but the evidence to decide the effectiveness of treatment is insufficient Rational problem solving is systematic, planned & constructive- Problems are defined as life situations tht require responses for adaptive functioning. Solutions are coping responses that alter the nature of problems, negative emotional reactions to them, or both- PST may be effective in wide range of situations (eg patients with schizophrenia, depression, eating disorders), psychological problems (eg smoking, marital discord) and stress a/w chronic illness. Social Skills Training- Some social behaviours can be learned eg making eye contact or staing conversation, negotiating & compromising, conflict management, community living, friendship & dating, work, vocation, medication management and asseiveness (eg making/refusing requests, making/ responding to complaints, making apologies, expressing unpleasant feelings /fear, asking for information, refusing drugs etc), - Useful for socially inadequate people or in rehabilitation of chronic mental disorders (Schizophrenia, depression, social phobia). Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD)- Depression is at least paially maintained by a lack of positive reinforcement. Severly depressed mood 1/t behavioral withdrawl, which inturn results in a loss of reinforcement from pleasureable events or activities.- Guiding principle of BATD is matching law, which states that behaviors are allocated to various alternatives (eg should I stay home or go out) based on the propoion of reinforcers obtained from the various alternatives. It says that depression persists because depressed behavior is more highly reinforced than nondepressed behavior. BATD increases the individual's exposure to positive out come of healthy behavior, there by increasing the frequency of these behaviors and reducing depressed behavior. Aversion Based Approches- Based on operant &/or counter conditioning strategies such as timeout, response cost and/or application of noxious stimulus to decrease the likelihood of undesived behavior.- Three different stimuli have been used as aversive conditioning stimuli 1) Chemical aversion (olfactory aversion = pairing of extremely noxious but harmless odors such as amonia with sexual perversion; gustatory /emetic aversion = pairing chemical that induces vomition with substance abuse). 2) Faradic or electrical aversion and. Verbal aversion (k/a Cove sensitization) involves the presentation of an imaginal scene involving dent behavior that is immediately f/b a scene that produces nausea. All three types of aversion therapies are used for treatment of sexual detions and substance abuseQ (however alone is rarely sufficient to treat substance abuse/ dependence)",

Expes think schizophrenia is caused by several factors. 1. Heredity (Genetic factors) Schizophrenia runs in families. The illness occur in 0. 5-1% of general population. However, First degree relative of schizophrenic patients have a 10 times more lifetime risk of having illness. The risk is 3-6 times and 2 times more in second and third degree relatives, respectively 2. Environmental factors Environmental factors and stress are impoant in precipitating schizophrenia in many individuals. These factors are:? Socioeconomic: - Low socio-economic status, Industrialization; Immigration; familes with high expressed emotions; Nuclear families; Schisms & skewed families; and pseudomutul & pseudohostile families. Drugs: - Drugs causing schizophrenia like state are amphetamine (most common causative drug), LSD, Phencyclidine, ketamine, Mescaline, Cocaine, Cannabis. Metabolic & Neurological disorders: - Schizophrenia like symptoms may occur in Huntington's chorea (early stage), homocystinuria, acute intermittent porphyria, Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis. 3. Biochemical factors Dopamine hypothesis is the most accepted hypothesis for schizophrenia. There is hyperactivity of dopaminergic system. This hypothesis is suppoed by: 1) Amphetamine and cocaine which release dopamine in central synapses induce schizophrenia like symptoms; and 2) Antipsychotic drugs control the schizophrenic symptoms by blocking dopamine (D, ) receptors. However, the dipamine hypothesis has been questioned also as Homo vanillic acid (HVA the principal metabolite of dopamine) is not elevated and prolactin level is not decreased (Dopamine has inihibitory action on prolactin release). Other neurotransmitters involved are: - Increased serotonin, Decreased GABA, variable change (Increased or decreased) glutamate, and increased norepinephrine.",

The SSRis are being found to be as effective as the tricyclic antidepressants. Haloperidol is an example of a neuroleptic or antipsychotic medication useful in the management of acute psychosis, as well as long-term care. Clozapine is a newer atypical antipsychotic medication.

It is associated with a triad of symptoms: impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity. DSM IV-TR has described three ADHD subtypes: hyperactive-impulsive, inattentive, and combined; the combined subtypes often do not appear until 7 years of age. The majority of children with ADHD have a combined type with symptoms of inattention as well as hyperactivity and impulsivity. Girls have a higher prevalence of the inattentive subtype; boys have a higher prevalence of the hyper-active subtype. Although symptoms begin in early childhood, they can diminish between ages 10 and 25 years. Hyperactivity declines more quickly, and impulsivity and inattentiveness often persist into adolescence and adulthood. Ref: Goldson E., Reynolds A. (2012). Chapter 3. Child Development & Behavior.

Phenelzine, an MAO inhibitor, augments available catecholamine neurotransmitters for release into the synaptic cleft by inhibiting the intraneuronal breakdown of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. The degree of enzyme inhibition appears to be directly related to the antidepressant effect. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, exes its therapeutic effect by means of inhibition of serotonin reuptake into the presynaptic neuron, thus enhancing the availability of neurotransmitter for action on the postsynaptic neuron. There is controversy surrounding the use of these medications for obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobic disorder, and panic attack, in which derangements in catecholamine neurotransmitters are also implicated. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine used primarily as an anticonvulsant in the treatment of akinetic and myoclonic seizures. Haloperidol is a high potency antipsychotic agent with minimal anticholinergic propeies and maximal dopamine-blocking propeies; it is used in the treatment of schizophrenia, manic-depressive disorder, and other psychotic states. Benztropine is an anticholinergic used to manage the pseudoparkinsonian and extrapyramidal side effects of the higher potency antipsychotic agents like haloperidol. Ref: Olson K. R. (2013).

Spasticity, muscle wasting, scoliosis, and lower limb deformities may become evident in the late stages of the illness. Handwringing and similar stereotypes are very typical features (and are different in subtle ways from the hand-flapping of autistic children). Ref: Ropper A. H., Samuels M. A. (2009). Chapter 38.

Malingering can lead to abuse of the medical system, with unnecessary tests being performed and time being wasted by the clinician as opposed to those with legitimate health problems. Malingering can exist in a variety of intensities, from pure (in which all symptoms are falsified) to partial, in which symptoms are exaggerated. Treatment: Treatment lies in the clinician being able to detect the disorder. Cues for the clinician include If the patient has legal problems Potential for financial reward, antisocial personality disorder If the patient's story is in congruent with known facts or other informant accounts If the patient will not cooperate while being evaluated Psychological evaluation is also recommended as a way to diagnose malingering, in particular, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2) as this measure has validity scales of value for this purpose. The MMPI-2 provides objective, scientifically based information about whether an individual has responded honestly to the test, or whether he or she has exaggerated or minimized psychological problems (possibly to obtain an external incentive, such as money damages in a personal injury lawsuit).",

Treatment of panic disorder, treats agoraphobia. Treatment is staed with SSRIs (paroxetine, seraline, or fluvoxamine).

Postpaum mood disturbance. Onset within 4 weeks postpaum DSM-IV-TR Criteria for Manic EpisodeA distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, lasting at least 1 week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary). During the period of mood disturbance, three (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable) and have been present to a significant degree: Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. Decreased need for sleep (e. g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep). More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. Distractibility (i. e., attention too easily drawn to unimpoant or irrelevant external stimuli). Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation. Excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e. g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments). The symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in occupational functioning or in usual social activities or relationships with others, or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features. The symptoms are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e. g., a drug of abuse, a medication, or other treatment) or a general medical condition (e. g., hypehyroidism).

Freud Psychoanalysis Credit for invention of psychoanalysis belongs to Sigmund FreudQ, (born on 6 may 1956 in Freiburg, Czech Republic spent most of life in Vienna (Austria) & died in Lndon in 1939)Q Principles of role of meaning, free association, resistance, transference, counter transference and parapraxes are at the core of psychoanalysis as a treatmentQ. Other tenets (principles) include unconscious mental activity, role of childhood experiences in shaping adult personality and notion of psychic determination. Concept of psychic determinism means that all mental activity is purposeful & meaningful (not accidental)Q, though unconscious, & is linked with previous experiences of life. Role of meaning - means all symptoms, thoughts, feelings & behaviours are final common pathways of meaningful psychological processes. Many of which were unconscious. So even content of auditory hallucinations (produced by biological factors) is meaningful & shows psychological characteristics unique to that patients. Free association is a technique when patient is asked to say whatever came to mind. Freud recognized that patients often resist the physician's effo to heal reflected by mundane behaviours such as unable to follow suggestions, missing medication or scheduled appointment; all reflecting unconscious resistance to getting better. Parapraxes or slips of tongue, often reveal unconscious intent that is outside the individual's awareness. Transference is patient's displacement of early wishes & feelings toward persons from past onto the analyst or physician. It is influenced by analyst's real characteristics as it is an admixture of figures from the patient's past & the real relationship with the clinician in present. Counter transference is the flip side of transference - the clinician's feelings towards the patientQ, based on mixture of real characteristics of patient and qualities associated with figures from the clinician's past. In classical psychoanalysis, no detailed history taking, mental status examination or formalized diagnosis is attempted. The patient is allowed to communicate unguidedQ, by using free association. Therapist constantly challenges existing defences & interprets resistances and transference (patient's feeling, behaviour & relationship with the therapist)Q. The physician remains passive & his approach is non-directive i. e. no direct advice is ever givenQ to the patient. The crux of therapy is on interpretation.",

These disorders are characterized by disturbance in gender identity, i. e., the sense of one's masculinity or femininity is disturbed. Gender identity disorders have the following two characteristics:? 1. A strong and persistent cross-gender identification which is manifested by:? Repeatedly stated desire to be, or the insistence that he or she is, of the other sex. Wearing the clothes of other sex (cross-dressing), Preference for cross-sex roles in plays or fantasies, Preference for playmates of the other sex. 2. Persistent discomfo with his or her sex. Impoant gender identity disorders are: -Transsexualism: - It has all the characteristics of gender identity disorder (see above). The most characteristic feature is that there is marked preoccupation with the wish to get rid of one's genitals and secondary sex characteristics and to adopt the sex characteristics of other sex (perceived-gender), e. g., Female transexuals request for hysterectomy or mastectomy. Dual-role transvestism: - It is characterized by wearing clothes of the opposite sex to enjoy the temporary experience of membership of the opposite sex, but without any desire for a more permanent sex change (unlike transsexualism). Both transsexualism and dual-role transvestism should be differentiated from fetishistic transvestism which is not a gender identity disorder and characterized by wearing the clothes of other sex for sexual excitement which can be categorized as a disorder of sexual preference. Gender-identity disorder of childhood: - This disorder is similar to transsexualism with a very early age of onset (2-4 years of age).",

Dissociative disorder are:- Dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia:- It is the most common type of dissociative disorder. Dissociative amnesia is characterized by retrograde amnesia (inability to retrieve stored memories and events leading up to onset of amnesia) and absence of antegrade amnesia (inability to form new long term memories). Dissociative fugue:- A dissociative fugue may be present when a person impulsively wanders or travels away from home and upon arrival in the new location is unable to remember his/her past (i. e., amnesia for early life). There is loss of personal identity and the person assumes a new identity. There is absence of awareness of amnesia during fugue episode, i. e., Patient denies any memory loss during fugue state. On recovery there is amnesia for fugue episodes and recovery of memory of earlier life (i. e., before the episode of fugue). Dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder):- More than one personality appears to possess the individuals, Showing their characteristic behavior. At any instance behavior and memories of one personality is exhibited, patient then is unaware of the other's existance. Depersonalization disorder: - Feeling of detachment from self is referred to as depersonalization. Individuals with this disorder will repo feeling as if they are living in a dream or watching themselves on movie screen i. e., feeling detached from self and as if one is an outside observer of oneself. People with this disorder feel like they are \"going crazy\" and they frequently become anxious and depressed Dissociative disorders not otherwise specified:- These are the disorders that are characterized by dissociative response that do not meet diagnostic criteria for one of the other dissociative disorder. Impoant ones are:- Dissociative Trance (Possession) disorders:- There is temporary exchange of person's personality by a new personality usually attributed to a spirit or divine power. Usually the person is aware of the existance of the other, i. e., possessor (unlike dissociative identity disorder). Ganser's syndrome: - Also known as syndrome of approximate answers.

Other precipitating causes are prolonged starvation causing malnutrition (marasmus), hyperemesis gravidarum, HIV-AIDS, bariatric surgery, prolonged intravenous hyperalimentation, hemodialysis for CRF, and malignancies (gastric carcinoma). Thiamine is a cofactor for several impoant enzymes (transketolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase & a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase). Thiamine deficiency results in decreased utilization of glucose and accumulation of glutamate which causes excitatory damage to neurons. Acute damage (in wernicke's encephalopathy) causes petechial hemorrhage in thalamus, mammillary bodies, midline cerebellum, periaqueductal gray matter of midbrain, and peripheral nerves.

Symptoms include disturbances in thoughts (or cognitions), mood (or affects), perceptions, and relationships with others. The hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia are auditory hallucinations and delusions, which are fixed false beliefs. The symptoms of schizophrenia may be divided into the following 4 domains: Positive symptoms: These include psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, which are usually auditory; delusions; and disorganized speech and behavior. Negative symptoms: These include a decrease in emotional range, povey of speech, loss of interests, and loss of drive. Cognitive symptoms: These include neurocognitive deficits, such as deficits in working memory and attention and executive functions such as the ability to organize and abstract. Mood symptoms: Schizophrenia patients often seem cheerful or sad in a way that does not make sense to others. They often are depressed. Catatonia Schizophrenia This syndrome occurs in children, adolescents, and adults; is associated with a heterogeneous group of comorbid conditions; and is characterized by a variety of symptoms and signs of impairment of the expression of voluntary thoughts and movements. Typically, the syndrome of catatonia is episodic, with periods of remission. It can presents in three clinical forms: Excited catatonia Stuporous catatonia Catatonia alternating between excitement and stupor.",

Dosages exceeding 800 mg daily have been linked to the development of retinitis pigmentosa. Other side effects of thioridazine include ejaculatory inhibition. Although it also produces sedation, a side effect that can be of clinical value in treating agitated psychotic individuals, thioridazine causes fever extrapyramidal side effects than most other neuroleptics. Haloperidol is a widely used butyrophenone antipsychotic that can produce significant extrapyramidal side effects. However, because it is non-sedating and causes little autonomic disturbance, it is effective in low dosages in treating agitation in elderly persons. MAO inhibitors such as phenelzine are used to treat mood disorders. Persons on MAO inhibitor therapy must remain on a diet free of tyramine-containing foods (e. g., aged cheese) to avoid a potentially fatal hypeensive crisis, which can present as severe headache. Lithium carbonate is used in the treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar disorder. The dosage must be adjusted according to blood level. Side effects commonly associated with rising or mildly toxic blood levels include fine tremor of the hands, nausea, anorexia, and diarrhea. Ref: Meyer J. M. (2011). Chapter 16.

Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36-200 hours. Very sho-acting compounds have a half-life of 2-5 hours. They have few residual effects if taken before bedtime, rebound insomnia may occur upon discontinuation and they might cause day time withdrawal symptoms such as next day rebound anxiety with prolonged usage. Examples are brotizolam, midazolam and triazolam. Sho-acting compounds have a half-life of 8-20 hours. They may have some residual effects in the first half of the day if used as a hypnotic. Rebound insomnia, however, is more common upon discontinuation of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines than longer acting benzodiazepines. Examples are estazolam, flunitrazepam, lormetazepam, nitrazepam and temazepam. Long-acting compounds have a half-life of 40-100 hours.

However, there is one problem in diagnosing acute & transient psychotic disorder -> This patient is having a fever. So, we can not exclude organic cause (e. g. CNS infection) as a cause of psychotic symptoms. While the diagnostic criteria for acute & transient psychotic disorder state that there should be the absence of organic cause. So, the diagnosis of the acute & transient psychotic disorder cannot be made without addressing the organic basis of the disease. Actually, the best answer here would have been organic psychosis, which is not provided in the options.

        "exp": "Vagus nerve. The most commonly used treatments for major depressive episodes are pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. - Although the majority of patients suffering from a major depressive episode improve significantly with these treatments, a minority does not achieve adequate symptom reduction. These minority are described as having treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Although the definition of TRD is itnpetfect, the (STARD) data suggest that patients who have major depression and who have failed to respond to three or four medication trials are treatment resistant. Until recently, few treatments for major depression other than pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) have been available. Now days somatic therapies are being used for TRP.- These new treatments are device-related and/or surgical interventions. for major depression and other psychiatric illnesses, and the field associated with these new treatments often is referred to as \"neurotherapeutics\" or \"neuromodulation\". These treatments are typically (but not always) used in TRD patients. Examples of neurotherapeutic interventions for major depression include:- Ablative limbic system surgeries- Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and- Deep brain stimulation (DBS). Ablative limbic system surgery Procedures used include - Anterior cingulotomy - Subcaudate tractotomy - Limbic leucotomy - Anterior capsulotomy. These procedures have been found to be efficacious in patients suffering. from intractable mood and anxiety disorders with response rates ranging. from 35% to 70% over a period of several weeks to several months, depending upon the response criteria. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) was initially approved for use in treatment-resistant epilepsy in 1994 in Europe and in 1997 in the United States. During the treatment it was noted that many patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy being treated with VNS experienced improved mood. This led to its use for treatment-resistant depression and bipolar disorder. VNS device is surgically implanted around the left vagus nerve an incision in the neck (only the left vagus nerve is used for VNS because the right vagus nerve has parasympathetic branches to the heart). The exact mechanism of VNS is not completely understood. The fibres of vagus have widespread connections to many areas throughout the CNS that are implicated in feeding, arousal, mood, and other \"reflex\" behaviors. It is impoant to note that the FDA-approval language states that VNS is an adjunctive treatment for TRD and that it should be used in patients with severe, chronic, recurrent TRD who have failed at least four adequate antidepressant trials. Transcranial magnetic stimulation. Repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (r. TMS) uses a strong magnetic field introduced on the scalp surface to generate. focal electrical stimulation of the coical surface. To date in the United States, this procedure remains experimental, not approved. for general clinical use with regard to this indication i. e. treatment resistant depression. Deep brain stimulation. DBS involves the placement of electrodes in specified brain regions so that electrical stimulation can be delivered in a targeted manner. To date, one clinical trial of DBS for depression has been published.",

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) refers to the combination of hypehermia, rigidity, and autonomic dysregulation that can occur as a serious complication of the use of antipsychotic drugs. The list of atypical antipsychotic drugs that may cause NMS include olanzapine, risperidone, paliperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, amisulpride, and quetiapine. Clozapine may also be associated with the development of NMS, but it appears to be less likely to manifest with extrapyramidal features, including rigidity and tremor. The most widely accepted mechanism by which antipsychotics cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome is that of dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Central D2 receptor blockade in the hypothalamus, nigrostriatal pathways, and spinal cord leads to increased muscle rigidity and tremor extrapyramidal pathways. Hypothalamic D2 receptor blockade results in an elevated temperature set point and impairment of heat-dissipating mechanisms. Peripherally, antipsychotics lead to increased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in increased contractility, which can contribute to hypehermia, rigidity, and muscle cell breakdown.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Nihilistic delusions Types of delsions Based on the contents of delusions, they are divided into:- Persecutory delusions (paranoid): - The patient feels that he is being persecuted against. There is false belief that one is being harmed, threatened, cheated, poisoned, harassed or spied on or is a victim of conspiracy to damage his reputation. The supposed persecutor of the patient may be people in the environment (e. g., members of family, neighbours, former friend) or may be political or religious groups. These delusions occur in schizophrenia (especially paranoid), severe affective disorders (sever mania or severe depression), and organic brain syndrome. This is the most common type of delusion. Delusion of persecution may occur in the context of primary delusional experiences, auditory hallucinations, bodily hallucinations or experiences of passivity. Grandiose delusion (expansive delusions): - False belief that one is exceptionally powerful, talented or impoant. These delusions seen most commonly in mania, However, can also occur in schizophrenia and organic states. Delusions of reference: - False belief that ceain objects, people or events have intense personal significance and refer specifically to one self, e. g., believing that a television news reader is talking directly about oneself, or people walking on the road are talking about him. These delusions are seen in schizophrenia, mania and organic states. Religious delusions: - False belief peaining to a religious theme, often grandiose in nature, e. g., believing that one is a special messenger from God. These delusions are seen in schizophrenia. Delusions of love (erotomania): - False belief that another person is in love with one (commoner in woman). In one form, termed de clerambault sydrome, a woman (usually) believes that a man, frequently older and of higher status, is in love with her. Delusion of infidility (morbid jealousy, othello syndrome:- False belief that one's lover has been unfaithful. These are seen in schizophrenia, alcohol related psychosis, organic states. Delusion of misidentification: - a) Capgras syndrome (Delusion of double): - Belief that a familiar person has been replaced by an exact double i. e. an impostor. b) Fregoli syndrome: - Belief that a complete stranger is actually a familiar person already known to one. Delusion of self accusation or guilt: - False feeling of remorse of guilt. It occur in Depression. Nihilistic delusions: - False belief that oneself, others or the world is non-existent or about to end. There are pessimistic ideas that the patient's career is finished, he is about to die, world is doomed. These occurs in severe depression. If nihilistic delusions are accompanied by ideas concerning bodily function failure, e. g., putrefaction of intestines, etc., the syndrome is called COTARD's SYNDROME. Hypochondriacal delusions: - False belief about one's health, patient wrongly believes that he has severe medical illness, contrary to the all medical evidences. It is seen in depression. Delusion of infestations: - False belief that one is infested with small but visible organisms. As a monosymptomatic delusional disorder this is called EKBOM SYNDROME. It is seen in acute confusional state (due to drugs or alcohol withdrawal), in schizophrenia, in dementing illness, and as delusional eloboration of tactile hallucinatory experiences (secondary to formication). Delusion of control: - Belief that his actions, impulses or thoughts are controlled by an outside agency and accordingly called as made action, made impulse or made affect. Also called somatic passivity experiences (passivity phenomenon). Commonly seen in schizophrenia. Delusions concerning possession of thoughts - Patients with delusions about possession of thoughts may lose the conviction that their thoughts are their own. Most commonly seen in schizophrenia. Delusions of thought inseion - thoughts have been implanted by an outside agency. Delusions of thought withdrawal - thoughts are being taken out of their mind. This is usually accompanied by \"thought block\". Delusions of thought broadcast - unspoken thoughts are known to other people through radio, telepathy or in some other way.",

Parkinsonism Deep brain stimulation It is a neurosurgical procedure involving the implantation of a medical device called a neurostimulator (sometimes referred to as a 'brain pacemaker'), which sends electrical impulses, through implanted electrodes, to specific targets in the brain (brain nuclei) for the treatment of movement and neuropsychiatric disorders. DBS in select brain regions has provided therapeutic benefits for otherwise-treatment-resistant disorders such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia, chronic pain, major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved DBS as a treatment for essential tremor and Parkinson's disease in 1997, dystonia in 2003, and OCD in 2009. DBS is also used in research studies to treat chronic pain, PTSD, and has been used to treat various affective disorders, including major depression; none of these applications of DBS have yet been FDA-approved.",

Association areas of the neocoex Topographical Distribution of NFTs in Alzheimer's disease`The spatiotemporal pattern of progression of NFTs in Alzheimer's disease is steriotypical and predictable. Briefly, the neurofibrillary degeneration stas in the aliocoex of medial temporal lobe (entorhinal coex and hippocampus) and spreads to the associative neocoex, relatively sparing the primary sensory and primary motor and visual coex. 'Enterohinal coex, Hippocampus and Associative areas of neocoex are primarily involved. Taken from 'Neuropathological Alterations in Alzheimer's Disease': Perspectives in Medicine 2011 Braak and Braak distinguished six stages to explain topographical distribution and progression of NFT. Stage IThe first NFTs consistently appear in the Transentorhinal (perihilar) region along with Entorhinal coex proper. Stage IINFTs appear in the CA I region of the Hippocampus. Stage IIINFTs appear in the Limbic structures such as the subiculum of H ppocampal formation. Stage IVNFTs appear in the Amygdala, Thalamus & Claustrum. Stage VNFTs appear in all isocoical areas with the affection of Associative areas. Stage VINFTs appear in primary sensory, motor and visual areas (Primary sensory, motor and visual area are considered most resistant). These six stages can be summarized into three for the purpose of understanding, namely: Entorhinal, Limbic and isocoical",

Syele viewed these diseases as a byproduct of the body's attempt to adapt to stress from any source and thought aderenal coical hormones responsible for the physiological reaction.

While both drugs are very effective, SSRIs have generally become the preferred medication for anxiety disorders including OCD.

Adults with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) consistently develop the typical neuropathologic hallmarks of AD if they survive beyond age 40. Presenilin-1 (PS-1) is on chromosome 14 and encodes a protein called S182. Mutations in this gene cause an early-onset AD transmitted in an autosomal dominant, highly penetrant fashion. The Apo E gene on chromosome 19 is involved in the pathogenesis of late-onset familial and sporadic forms of AD. AD most often presents with an insidious onset of memory loss followed by a slowly progressive dementia over several years. Pathologically, atrophy is distributed throughout the medial temporal lobes, lateral and medial parietal lobes and lateral frontal coex. Microscopically, there are neuritic plaques containing A-beta, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau filaments, and accumulation of amyloid in blood vessel walls in coex and leptomeninges. Clinical Manifestation begins with memory impairment and spreading to language and visuospatial deficits. The management of AD is challenging and gratifying, despite the absence of a cure or a robust pharmacologic treatment. Donepezil (target dose, 10 mg daily), rivastigmine (target dose, 6 mg twice daily or 9. 5-mg patch daily), galantamine (target dose 24 mg daily, extended-release), memantine (target dose, 10 mg twice daily), and tacrine are the drugs presently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of AD.

Two impoant ways to rule out organic epilepsy from psychogenic epilepsy are:-i) Abnormality in E. E. G.- Generalized tonic clonic seizures always produce marked E. E. G. abnormalities during and after the seizure. ii) Increase in prolactin secretion- Measurement of serum prolactin levels may also help to distinguish between organic and psychogenic seizures, since most generalized seizures and many complex seizures are accompanied by rise in serum prolactin. Amnesia can occur in ceain epilepsies (complex paial seizures). Complex paial seizures are characterized by foal seizure activity accompanied by a transient impairment of the patient's ability to maintain normal contact with the environment (altered sensorium). The patient is unable to respond appropriately to visual or verbal commands during the seizure and has impaired recollection or awareness of the ictal phase. Examination immediately following the seizure may show an anterograde amnesia (memory deficits) or in cases involving the dominant hemisphere, a postictal aphasia. Other two options can be easily rule out. Somatization disorder. In these cases patient will compain of number of symptoms involving multiple organ. system of the body. Hypochondriasis In lzypochondriasis patient complains that he has some serious ailment and he consults many dotors.",

This can be a normal behaviour but use definitely need to rule out of few disorders before reaching this conclusion. Recent studies have suggested a possible correlation b/w migraine and behavioural problems. There is nothing in the question to point out towards migraine as a cause of the headache, not there are any specific behavioural problems that can be linked to migraine. Diagnostic criteria for appositional defiantdisorder (ADD) A. A pattern of negativistic, hostile, and defiant behaviour lasting for atleast 6 months, during which four (or more) of the following are present? Often loses temper. Often argues with adults. Often actively defies or refuses to comply with adults' requests or rules. Often deliberately annoys people. Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehaviour. Is often touchy or easily annoyed by others. Is often spiteful and resentful. Is often spiteful or vindictive. Note: Consider a criterion met only if the behaviour occurs more frequently than is typically observed in individuals of comparable age and developmental level. B. The disturbance in behaviour causes clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning. C. The behaviours do not occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic or mood disorder. D. Criteria are not met for conduct disorder, and if the individual is 18 years or older, criteria are not met for antisocial personality disorder. Clinical manifestations of depression in children and adolescents Anhedonia. Loss of interest andenthusiasm in play, socializing, school, andusual activities; boredom; loss of pleasure. Dysphoric mood. Tearfulness; sad, downturned expression; slumpedposture; quick temper; irritability; anger. Fatigability. Lethargy and tiredness; noplay after school. Morbid ideation. Self-deprecating thoughts, statements; thoughts ofdisaster, abandonment, death, suicide, orhopelessness. Somatic symptoms. Changes in sleep or appetitepatterns; difficulty inconcentrating; bodilycomplaints, paicularlyheadache and stomachache. QFrequent quarrels with parents and lack of interest in studies for last 6 months are both consistent with a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. However, children with oppositional disorder typically present to the clinic by the age of 8 years. Also headache has not been mentioned as a manifestation in this disorder. The presence of frequent headaches and age of presentation (18 years) make the diagnosis of appositional delusional disorders unlikely. So symptoms of the patient here are not enough to be diagnosed as ADD. Depression can occur at any age including adolescents and young adults. Lack of interest in school is a known feature (anhedonia). Restlessness & irritability are pa of dysphoric mood & explain frequent quarrels with parents. Also somatic symptoms like headache/ heaviness of head are known associations",

Other conditions associated with ED include neurologic disorders, endocrinopathies, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and depression. Conditions associated with reduced nerve and endothelium function, such as aging, hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes, alter the balance between contraction and relaxation factors. These conditions cause circulatory and structural changes in penile tissues, resulting in aerial insufficiency and defective smooth muscle relaxation. In some patients, sexual dysfunction may be the presenting symptom of these disorders. Additionally, ED is often an adverse effect of many commonly prescribed medications. Some psychotropic drugs and antihypeensive agents are associated with ED.",

Changing to another drug is preferable to changing to a high dose. If a patient has responded poorly to a conventional DRA, it is unlikely that this individual will do well on another DRA. Changing to an SDA is more likely to be helpful. Clozapine is effective for patients who respond poorly to DRAs.

Improvement with VNS result in enhanced neurocognitive function in many patients. VNS appears to be most effective in patients with low to moderate antidepressant resistance. Response rates usually range from 30-40%, and long-term VNS treatment appears to be associated with sustained symptomatic improvement. VNS is also known to improve mood in depressed patients with epilepsy. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (r. TMS) is a noninvasive and easily tolerated method of altering coical physiology. Clinical studies suppo an antidepressant effect of high-frequency r. TMS administered to the left PFC; however, antidepressive efficacy is not consistent, and where efficacy is demonstrated, degree of clinical improvement appears to be small. The absence of psychosis, and younger age may be predictors of treatment success. Low frequency TMS to the right PFC also has shown promise.
