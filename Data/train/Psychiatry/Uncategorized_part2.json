It is not used as an anti-craving agent. Other drugs in the choices are used for anti-craving. Good to know: Naltrexone is chemically related to the highly selective opioid-receptor antagonist naloxone but has higher oral bioavailability and a longer duration of action. Naltrexone helps to maintain abstinence by reducing the urge to drink and increasing control when a \"slip\" occurs. It is not a \"cure\" for alcoholism and does not prevent relapse in all patients. Naltrexone works best when used in conjunction with some form of psychosocial therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy. It typically is administered after detoxification and given at a dose of 50 mg/day for several months. Acamprosate is an analogue of GABA. A number of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that acamprosate (1.3-2 g/day) decreases drinking frequency and reduces relapse drinking in abstinent alcoholics and appears to have efficacy similar to that of naltrexone. Acamprosate generally is well tolerated by patients, with diarrhea being the main side effect. Topiramate, a drug used for treating seizure disorders, appears useful for treating alcohol dependence. Compared with the placebo group, patients taking topiramate achieved more abstinent days and a lower craving for alcohol. Ref: Schuckit M.A. (2011). Chapter 23. Ethanol and Methanol. In L.L.

Perseveration :- There is persistent repetition of movement or speech, beyond fulfilment of purpose. Patient is unable to stop the action or speech beyond fulfilment of purpose. Perseveration is goal directed and requires external stimulus (in contrast to stereotypy). Note : Sterotypy and perseveration may be seen either as speech disturbance or as motor activity disturbance, i.e., repetion of speech or movemnt. Echopraxia :- Patients senselessly repeat the movement of others around them (associated with echolalia). TIC :- Sudden, involuntary, rapid, recurrent non-rhythmic motor movements. Catatonia :- Catatonia is characterized by a marked disturbance of motor behaviour. Most common cause of catatonia is schizophrenia, However it may also occur in depression, Mania, conversion - dissociative disorders, reactive psychosis, hypnosis, anxiety disorders and many medical disorders. Catatonia may be of following types :- Catatonic excitment :- Excited, uncontrolled motor activity, not influenced by external stimuli. Catatonic posturing :- Voluntary adoption of an unusual or bizarre position that is then maintained for some time. Catatonic rigidity :- Maintaining a fixed position and rigidity resisting all attempts to be moved. Waxy flexibility (flexibilitas cerea or catalepsy) : - Maintaining of paicular posture imposed on the patient by examiner, even if the posture is bizzare and uncomfoable, i.e., patient can he moulded like wax into a position that is then maintained. Catatonic stupor :- Patient is mute and immobile (akinetic mutism) but fully conscious. Catatonic negativism .- A seemingly motiveless resistance to all instructions or attempts to be moved.

Process refers to the way in which a person puts together ideas and associations, the form in which a person thinks. Process or form of thought can be logical and coherent or completely illogical and even incomprehensible. Content refers to what a person is actually thinking about: ideas, beliefs, preoccupations, obsessions. I. Formal thought disorder: The patient may have either an overabundance or a povey of ideas. There may be rapid thinking, which, if carried to the extreme, is called a flight of ideas. A patient may exhibit slow or hesitant thinking. It is characteristic of schizophrenia Few of formal thought disorders are as follows: Circumstantiality. Overinclusion of tril or irrelevant details that impede the sense of getting to the point. Clang associations. Thoughts are associated by the sound of words rather than by their meaning (e.g., through rhyming or assonance). Derailment. (Synonymous with loose associations.) A breakdown in both the logical connection between ideas and the overall sense of goal-directedness. The words make sentences, but the sentences do not make sense. Flight of ideas. A succession of multiple associations so that thoughts seem to move abruptly from idea to idea; often (but not invariably) expressed through rapid, pressured speech. Neologism. The invention of new words or phrases or the use of conventional words in idiosyncratic ways. Perseveration. Repetition of out of context of words, phrases, or ideas. Tangentiality. In response to a question, the patient gives a reply that is appropriate to the general topic without actually answering the question. Example: Doctor: Have you had any trouble sleeping lately? Patient: I usually sleep in my bed, but now I'm sleeping on the sofa. 8. Thought blocking. A sudden disruption of thought or a break in the flow of ideas. II. Thought content disorder: Disturbances in content of thought include Delusions Preoccupations (which may involve the patient's illness) Obsessions Compulsions Phobias Recurrent ideas about suicide or homicide Hypochondriacal symptoms Specific antisocial urges",

        "exp": "Patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) suffer from obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors that impair everyday function. Obsessions are defined as recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are intrusive, inappropriate, and cause anxiety and distress. Patients realize that these thoughts and images are a product of their own mind and they will attempt to suppress them. In addition to obsessions, patients experience compulsions. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that a person performs in accordance with an obsession. The behaviors are aimed at reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation. Locking doors is a common compulsion, and thus this patient meets the diagnostic criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive anxiety and apprehensive expectation for a period greater than 6 months. Patients experience anxiety, cognitive vigilance, autonomic hyperactivity, motor tension, irritability, and poor concentration. Compulsions are not a pa of this disorder. Panic disorder is characterized by episodes of panic. Patients have a discrete period of intense fear with tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, trembling, shoness of breath, chest pain and tightening, abdominal discomfo, fear of dying, and paresthesias.

        "question": "An 82 year old woman, whose husband passed away 6 weeks ago after a long illness, is admitted to the hospital for worsening of her cardiac problems. During the hospital stay, a psychiatrist is invited to consult at the request of her daughters. The daughters think their mother is depressed, because she is tearful, often talks about her dead husband, and states that she had heard his voice several times. She blames herself for not having gone with him on his last visit to his sister, and she stas crying. She has never seen a psychiatrist before and has been \"strong\" all her life. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "A normal or uncomplicated grief reaction after the loss of a beloved person may resemble depression in some ways (e.g., changes in sleep or appetite, sadness, withdrawal). However, as the loss becomes remote, the grief-stricken person is able to re- experience joy. Self-blame is focused on what was not done in relation to the deceased person. Illusions or hallucinations of the deceased person are common. The uncomplicated grief reaction can last several months, or longer, depending on the relationship to the deceased. Depression secondary to a general medical condition can be seen in association with cardiopulmonary disease, among other disorders; however, since the symptoms are related to the precipitating event, one would have to wait till the normal grief is resolved and then reassess the presence of symptoms of depression. The main diagnostic criterion of dysthymia involves milder symptoms of depression occurring every day for at least 2 years. Major depressive disorder can be precipitated by the loss of a beloved person, but it has a distinct quality even though some symptoms are the same. Suicidal ideation, guilt related to the person alone and not to the deceased person, and feelings of wohlessness are common. Significant functional impairment is typical.

Dosages exceeding 800 mg daily have been linked to the development of retinitis pigmentosa. Other side effects of thioridazine include ejaculatory inhibition. Although it also produces sedation, a side effect that can be of clinical value in treating agitated psychotic individuals, thioridazine causes fever extrapyramidal side effects than most other neuroleptics. Haloperidol is a widely used butyrophenone antipsychotic that can produce significant extrapyramidal side effects. However, because it is non-sedating and causes little autonomic disturbance, it is effective in low dosages in treating agitation in elderly persons. MAO inhibitors such as phenelzine are used to treat mood disorders.Persons on MAO inhibitor therapy must remain on a diet free of tyramine-containing foods (e.g., aged cheese) to avoid a potentially fatal hypeensive crisis, which can present as severe headache. Lithium carbonate is used in the treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar disorder. The dosage must be adjusted according to blood level. Side effects commonly associated with rising or mildly toxic blood levels include fine tremor of the hands, nausea, anorexia, and diarrhea. Ref: Meyer J.M. (2011). Chapter 16.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Thinking Delusion is an incorrect belief which is out of keeping with the person's cultural context, intelligence and social background and which is held with unshakeable conviction' Primary delusiona are commonly associated with schizophrenia. Some of the more common delusion themes are: Delusion of control: This is a false belief that another person, group of people, or external force controls one's thoughts, feelings, impulses, or behavior. A person may describe, for instance, the experience that aliens actually make him or her move in ceain ways and that the person affected has no control over the bodily movements. Thought broadcasting (the false belief that the affected person's thoughts are heard loud), thought inseion, and thought withdrawal (the belief that an outside force, person, or group of people is removing or extracting a person's thoughts) are also examples of delusions of control. Nihilistic delusion: A delusion whose theme centres on the nonexistence of self or pas of self, others, or the world. A person with this type of delusion may have the false belief that the world is ending. Delusion of infidelity/ delusional jealousy: A person with this delusion falsely believes their spouse or lover is having an affair. This delusion stems from pathological jealousy, and the person often gathers \"evidence\" and confronts the spouse about the nonexistent affair. Delusion of guilt or sin/ Delusion of self-accusation: This is a false feeling of remorse or guilt of delusional intensity. A person may, for example, believe he has committed some horrible crime and should be punished severely. Delusion of mind being read: The false belief that other people can know one's thoughts. This is different from thought broadcasting in that the person does not believe their thoughts are heard loud. Delusion of the person falsely believes that insignificant remarks, events, or objects in one's environment have personal meaning or significance. For instance, a person may believe they are receiving special messages from newspaper headlines. Grandiose delusion: An individual is convinced they have special powers, talents, or abilities. Sometimes, the individual may actually believe they are a famous person or character (for example, a rock star). Persecutory delusion: These are the most common type of delusions and involve the theme of being followed, harassed, cheated, poisoned or drugged, conspired against, spied on, attacked, or obstructed in the pursuit of goals.",

An obsession has following characteristic : - An idea, impulse or image which intrudes into the conscious awareness repeatedly. It is recognized as one's own ideas, impulse or image but is perceived as egoalien (foreign to one's personality). It is recognized as irrational and absurd (insight is present --4 Patient knows about disorder). Patient tries to resist against it but is unable to do so which leads to marked distress or anxiety. A compulsion has following characteristics :- It is repetitive, purposeful form of behavior is carried out because of strong feeling of compulsion to do so. It usually follows an obsession. ts goal is to prevent or reduce the anxiety or stress caused by obsession however it do not always succeed in doing so. It is irrational or excessive and not realistic. Insight is present. A patient with OCD may have an obsession, a compulsion or both (mostly patients have both). A patient with OCD realizes the irrationality of the obsession and experiences both the obsession and the compulsion as ego-dystonic (unwanted behavior). The person is preoccupied with details rules, list order, organisation or schedules to the extent that the major point of activity is lost.

It is also k/ a Wernicke - Korsakov syndrome, because it often follows an acute neurological syndrome called Wernicke's encephalopathy comprising delirium, ataxia, opthalmoplegia, nystagmus & peripheral neuropathy. It is a potentially reversible conditionQ caused by thiamine deficiency most commonly associated with chronic alcohol abuse malnutrition. But other causes of malnutrition eg. starvation, hyperemesis gravidarum, dialysis, cancer, AIDS, gastric plication or prolonged IV hyperalimentation, alone can also result in thiamine deficiency & KP. Neuropathological lesion caused by thiamine deficiency is usually widespread but most consistent changes are seen in bilateral dorsomedial (& anterior) nucleus of thalamus, mammillary bodies, and hippocampus, in form of small vessels hyperplasia; petechial hemorrhages, astrocytic hyperophy & degenerationQ. It disrupts a critical circuit between hippocampus & frontal lobes. The changes are also seen in periventricular (around 3rd ventricle), periaqueductal grey matter, cerebellum, and brain stem (midbrain, pons, medulla fornix) as symmetrical lesions. The cardinal feature is a profound deficit of episodic memory, confabulation and lack of insight into the amnesiaQ. It presents as : Change in personality (frontal lobe like) such that they display lack of initiative, interest or concern & diminished spontaneity. - Executive function deficits involving attention, planning, set shifting, & inferential reasoning. - Apathy, passivity & confabulationQ are often prominent. There is disorientation for time, emotional blunting, & ineia. - There is little impairment in implicit memory and their ability to perform (complete) complex motor procedures remain intactQ. Typically general intelligence, perceptual skills & language remain relatively normalQ. Memory disorder - Profound deficit of episodic type explicit (declarative) memory 1/t loss of autobiographic information (often extending back for many years). Severe anterograde amnesia (learning defect) for verbal & visual material with a lack of insight into the amnesia. Events are recalled immediately after they occur, but forgotten a few minutes later. Thus digit span, testing the sho term memory store, is normal. Storage is mildly impaired but retrieval & learning are severely impairedQ. When patients learn new material they will forget it at a normal rate, but learning the new material is extremely difficult, and in severe cases new learning is impossible. So these patients have difficult encoding & consolidating explicit memory. - Retrograde amnesia back to the onset of illness, is as severe as anterograde loss; but the overall retrograde memory impairment (i.e. before the onset of illness) is not as severe as that of anterograde memory. New learning & recent memory is grossly defective but retrograde (remote) memory is relatively (variably) preserved, and show a temporal gradient, with older memories better preserved. As a result these patients retain more distant memories dramatically more proficiently than they learn new material. - Although remote memory is surprisingly intact, patients are unable to organize them in a temporal context. So they disto the relationship between facts and fill the remote memory gaps by confabulationQ (a vivid & wholly fictitious account of recent activities which the patient believes to be true).",

When questioned about his identity, he talks incessantly in a rapid fashion and threatens to \"unleash God's wrath on those who do not submit.\" He repos that he has not slept in a week, and does not need sleep. He has spent the last week preparing for a secret government mission that only the president knows about. When asked if he ever hears God talking to him, he says, \"Of course not, I am God!\" Police repo that he has had several prior arrests for reckless driving and lewd acts. On examination, he is disheveled and malodorous. It is nearly impossible to get any fuher history, as he rapidly paces about and mutters, \"I must go, I must go\" over and over again.Which of the following is the most likely preliminary diagnosis?",
        "exp": "This patient is displaying many of the diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder. He has had a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated mood lasting at least one week. In addition, his thoughts are grandiose (\"I am a golden god\"), he has a decreased need for sleep, and he has pressured and excessive speech. His arrest history indicates possible previous sexual indiscretions, which are a hallmark of bipolar disorder (excessive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a high potential for painful consequences). His pacing indicates psychomotor agitation, also a hallmark of bipolar disorder. This patient probably has a history of severe depressive episodes, but the occurrence of a single manic episode allows the diagnosis of bipolar disorder to be made. Antisocial personality disorder refers to a long-standing pattern of socially irresponsible behavior that reflects a disregard for the rights of others. These individuals were formerly called psychopaths, and generally lack a conscience. Many people with this disorder engage in unlawful acts. The most pervasive characteristic is a lack of remorse for the harm they cause others. Borderline personality disorder refers to a lifelong pattern of unstable affect and self-image with erratic behavior. Borderlines have interpersonal relationships that are intense, but very unstable (\"love-hate\" relationships). They are prone to self-mutilation and the defense mechanism of splitting. But they have a life of chaos, not a sense of grandeur and power, so the diagnosis does not fit this case. Posttraumatic stress disorder is an anxiety disorder that develops surrounding a traumatic event. Symptoms revolve around the event and include reexperiencing of the trauma, avoidance of associated stimuli, psychic numbing, and increased autonomic arousal Ref: Brent D.A., Pan R.J. (2008).

First choice is determined by side effect profile least objectionable to patient's physical status, severity of disorder including self harm, patient preference & nature of any associated illnessQ In recurrent depression, continuation treatment of choice will be which ever (any) antidepressant has been effective & well toleratedQ. Guidelines for medical management of (unipolar) major depression Objective of treatment is remission of symptoms, not just symptom reduction as patients with residual symptoms are more likely to experience relapse or recurrence. Significant therapeutic effect may take 3-4 weeks although some may be seen earlier. Most common mistake 1/t unsuccessful trial is the use of too low a dosage for too sho time. An antidepressant need to be continued for a minimum duration of 6 weeks (oxford) /4-5 weeks (kaplan) at adequate or high dose before being considered as unsuccessful. If not responding, plasma conc. of drug is obtained at 2 or 3 weeks to find out non compliance or unusual pharmacokinetics. There is no ideal antidepressant. First choice is determined by side effect profile least objectionable to patient's physical status, severity of disorder including self harm, patient preference & nature of any associated illnessQ Since SSRIs are comparatively free of side effects and are not costly, they are generally recommended as first choice antidepresantsQ. Where there is a previous h/o response to a specific drug or class, the best first choice is that antidepressantQ. Symptom pattern and therapeutic use of side effects (such as sedating amitriptyline for more anxious and more activating desipramine for psychomotor retardation) is not a good guide to treatment. Despite widespread use of SSRIs, there is no evidence that this class is more efficacious than TCA. Selecting second option: Switching to a new single treatment rather than augmenting is preferred after initial medication failure. Whereas augmentation is helpful with patients who have gained some benefit from initial treatment but who have not achieved remission. Switch should be to an antidepressant of a different class or to broad action SNRI. Lithium > thyroid hormone are best documented augmentations. For non responsive & resistant cases not responding to Li or thyroid hormone variety of other augmenters such as tryptophan, pindolol, buspirone, and combinations of antidepressants such as SSRIbupropion (widely used), SNRI-mitrazepine, TCA-MAOI may be tried. ECT is an alteranative 2^d choice in very severe depression or for repeatedly non responsive cases. Begin new medication at 1/3 to 1/2 target dose if drug is TCA, bupropion, venlafaxine or mitrazapine, or full dose as tolerated if drug is an SSRI. For sedative ADD, administration of 2/3 of drug dose at night may avoid hypnotic. Bed time doses of stimulant anti depressant (ADD) such as SSRIs and older MAOIs should be avoided. ECT may be used as 1s, choice treatment in severe depression with psychomotor retardation or mood congruent depressive delusions, or where an antidepressant has failed, and for moderately severe depressions which have not responded to 1 or 2 courses of AD.UK-NICE recommend its use only to achieve rapid improvement where other treatment has failed or the condition is potentially life threatening, in severe depression, catatonia & prolonged or severe mania. Antidepressant or Li are advisable after ECT. Patient should be completely free of residual symptom for atleast 4 months before AD is withdrawn. Withdrawal should be slowly over 2-3 months, to minimize the risk of relapse & withdrawal symptoms (oxford). AD treatment should be maintained for atleast 6 months or length of previous episode, whichever is greater. Prophylactic treatment is effective in reducing the number & severity of recurrences. (Kaplan). Continuation treatment for 9-12 months should be routine following response to acute treatment. Full dose should be resumed, f/b continuation for fuher 912 months if depressive symptoms return (relapse). Several recurrences (>2 in last 2 years or >3 in 5 yrs) require maintenance treatment for 2 to 5 years or even life long where 2 or 3 attempts to withdraw have been followed by another episode within year Maintenance treatment of choice will be whichever antidepressant has been effective and well toleratedQ Condition Preferred antidepressants (AD) Atypical depression (hysteroid dysphoria) MAOIs or SSRIs or bupropion Melanocholic AD with dual action on both depression serotonin & noradrenergic receptors (SNRIs) Psychotic - Antidepressant SNRIs or TCA (delusion) rather than SSRIs and an depression atypical antipsychotic combinationQ - ECT is perhaps more effective than pharmacotherapy - Antipsychotic alone is not adequate and it is refractory to psychotherapy Seasonal Light (photo) therapyQ Winter depression Suicidal risk Requires consideration of lethality of AD in over dose. So SNRIs & TCA should be avoided. SSRIs & most new drugs are comparatively safe in overdose, with careful monitoring for increased risk early in treatmentQ Elderly SSRIs & newer AD are preferable to TCAQ Children & adolescents AD are not first choice, psychological therapy is preferred. In non improving & severe depression, SSRIs (fluoxetine is best) preferred. For adolescents, combination of SSRIs with CBT is useful. Pregnancy & TCA is safe. Lithium & Lactation anticonvulsants carry risk of foetal malformation & are contraindicated in the early months of pregnancy. Cardiac SSRI or other new non TCA? problems non-SNRI antidepressant is indicated. MAOIs lower BP as dose related effect & should be avoided. T/t of depression after MI enhance survival Epilepsy Only AD established not to be epileptogenic are older MAOIs Depression SSRIs, SNRIs or clomipramine with OCD are preferable to noradrenergic AD Depression with panic disorder TCA and SSRIs Depression Abstinence often results in with remission in substance induced substance abuse mood disorder",

Nightmares occur during REM sleep; sleep terrors in stage 3 or stage 4 sleep. Enuresis is involuntary micturition during sleep in a person who usually has voluntary control. Like other parasomnias, it is more common in children, usually in the 3-4 hours after bedtime, but is not limited to a specific stage of sleep. Sleepwalking (somnambulism) includes ambulation or other intricate behaviors while still asleep, with amnesia for the event. It affects mostly children aged 6-12 years, and episodes occur during stage 3 or stage 4 sleep in the first third of the night and in REM sleep in the later sleep hours.

Less commonly euphoria, apathy or depression may occur. Mood constantly fluctuates, i.e., labile mood.\n5. Language disturbances: - Museum as well as rambling and incoherent speech.\n6. Psychomotor disturbances: - Hypo or hyperactivity, agitation.\n7. Disorder of sleep: - Sleep-wake rhythm is usually altered. Sleep is fragmented and disturbed by nightmares. Diurnal variation with sedation in the day me and restlessness at night (Sundowning) is common.\n8. Autonomic disturbances: - Tachycardia, sweating, tremors.\n9. Neurological signs : - Tremor, seizure, choreiform movements.\n10. Electroencephalography (EEG) : - The most typical finding is diffuse (generalized) slowing.

Anorexia nervosa is characterized by emaciation, a relentless pursuit of thinness and unwillingness to maintain a normal or healthy weight, intense fear of gaining weight, distoed body image, a self-esteem that is heavily influenced by perceptions of body weight and shape, or a denial of the seriousness of low body weight, lack of menstruation among girls and women, extremely restricted eating. With binge-eating disorder a person loses control over his or her eating. Unlike bulimia nervosa, periods of binge-eating are not followed by purging, excessive exercise, or fasting. As a result, people with binge-eating disorder often are over-weight or obese.

        "question": "All are used for treatment of morphine dependence except ?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., Disulfiram Treatment of morphine or heroin poisoning Treatment can be divided into :? A.Treatment of toxicity (overdose) Overdose is a medical emergency, and is treated with opioid antagonist to reverse the complications (respiratory depression) by antagonizing the action on opioid receptors. Intravenous naloxone is the antagonist of choince for morphine (heroin) poisoning. Oral naltrexone is used for maintenance therapy, once acute poisoning has been treated by iv naloxone. Intravenous nalmefene is another specific antagonist. A.Treatment of dependence Treatment of dependence include medically supervised withdrawal and detoxification, followed by maintenance therapy : a. Detoxification Detoxification process include abrupt withdrawal of opioid followed by management of the emergent withdrawal symptoms, i.e., treatment of withdrawal syndrome. Detoxification can be done by any of the following : Substitution of long-acting opioid agonism :- Methadone is the treatment of choice. Because of its agonistic activity on opioid receptors it suppresses withdrawal symptoms. L-alpha-acetylmethadol/Levomethyl (LAAM) is the other opioid agonist which was used for this purpose. However it is no longer in use because some patients developed prolonged QT intervals (torsades de points). Substitution of paial agonist Buprenorphine can be used in place of methadone because of its paial agonistic activity on opioid receptor. Substitution by a2 agonists Clonidine acts as a sympatholytic agent due to its agonistic action on central presynaptic a2 receptors which reduce nor-adrenergic activity. Therefore, clonidine reduces the adrenergic withdrawal symptoms. Lofexidine another a2 agonist, is an alternative to clonidine. Clonidine plus naltrexone :- A more rapid detoxification can occur when clonidine is used along with naltrexone. Naltrexone, when given in opioid dependent patient, causes withdrawal symptoms because of its antagonistic action. These can be treated with clonidine. The addition of sho acting Benzodiazepine (lorazepam or oxazepam) and NSAIDs, will help relieve withdrawl symptoms not covered by clonidine. It should be kept in mind that naltrexone should not be used alone for detoxification (to treat withdrawl syptoms) as it precipitates or worsens the withdrawl syndrome. 5.0ther drugs :- Dextropropoxyphene, diphenoxylate b. Maintenance therapy Once detoxification phase is over (i.e., withdrawal symptoms have been managed), the patient is maintained on any of the following drugs to prevent relapse by reducing craving and preventing `kick' or 'euphoria' produced by opioids (morphine or heroin). Drugs used are :- 1.Methadone :- Reduces craving and `kick/euphoria' from morphine or heroin because their opioid receptors are already occupied. 2.LAAM and buprenorphine :- Similarly reduce craving. 3.Opioid antagonists (naltrexone) Naltrexone can be used orally to assist in the rehabilitation of ex-opioid abusers who are fully withdrawn (otherwise it induces an acute withdrawl syndrome). Naltrexone prevents relapse by discouraging substance seeking behavior --) If a patient, who is on naltrexone maintenance therapy, takes an opioid, there is no 'kick' or 'euphoria' as opioid receptors are already blocked. Naltrexone can be used with clonidine as in detoxification.",

There is an absence or decrease of spontaneous movement, expressive gestures, eye contact, shifts in vocal inflections. .- Alogia is decrease in production and fluency of spontaneous speech (but not refusal to speak), which is believed to reflect povey of thought Abnormalities may also include prolonged pauses before answering questions.Disorganized Speech (Criterion A3)Disorganized speech reflects an underlying impairment in thought processQ that is, the inability to process stimuli accurately and link thoughts or ideas in a coherent & logical manner (=Thought disorder). These are cardinal features of schizophrenia, more closely a/w functional disability than positive symptoms and include Clanging (Rhyming or Rassonance) : Words are used based on how they sound rather than what they mean. 2. Concrete speeh : Is speech that reflects an inability to use abstract thinking which may bring about literal meaning of proverbs during mental status examination, or a pattern of speech that conveys little to no information d/t use of excessively vague or meaningless phrases (Verbigeration) Circumstantiality: Speech that is goal directed but excessive in unneeded detail. Questions are eventually answered; however, direct answers are difficult to come by.Derailment: Speech that begins in a goal directed manner, but topics shift rapidly between sentences with no logical connection to the topic previously under discussionIllogicality: Speech that is goal directed but gives illogical responses to logical questions, or bases asseion on premises that have no coherent or logical basis.Incoherence: Incomprehensible speech d/t loss of logical connections between words, phrases and sentences, the extreme form of which is k/a word salad.Tangentiality: Speech that begins in a goal directed manner, but detes gradually and constantly such that answers to questions are not reached. New topics arise from the topic previously under discussion, so an association between thoughts can be appreciated.Thought blocking: Sudden and involuantry interuption in the progress of speech of thought.Neologism: Use of nonsensical words, often as combination of pas of two or more different words. In Q.67, Patient has h/o 6 months of disorganized behaviour, disorganized speech (muttering) and hallucinatory voices (talking to himself). In Q.68, Patient has h/o bizarre auditory hallucination of voices commenting or arguing about him with a delusional belief (that's why he dropped police complaint). In Q.69, Patient has disorganized behaviour (recently staed writing books which could not be understood by anybody, metaphilosphical ideas), negative symptoms (shy, self absorbed), disorganized speech (i.e. neologism, incomprehensible, derailment, incoherence here indicated by use of words could not be understood by anybody, were never in any dictionary and with disjoined theme). In Q.70, Patient has third person hallucination (hallucination of voices commenting on his action) & disorganized behaviour (out of propoion recent onset suspiciousness). In Q.71, Patient has disorganized behaviour keeping shoes in fridge, wearing vest over shi), hallucinatory voices and delusion of persecution (people talking about & conspiring against him). In Q.72, Patient has delusion & disorganized behaviour (thinks that class mate laugh & talk about him and will harm him). In Q. 73, third person hallucinations are present. So all these cases can be easily diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia.In delusional disorders, hallucinations are rare and if present they are tactile, or olfactory and related to delusional theme. Delusions are non bizarre and contact with reality and personality are disturbed in delusional areas only.Differentiating b/w delusions of different causesDelusional disorderSchizophreniaDepression* Delusions are non bizarre (ie involvingsituations that occur in life as beingfollowed, deceived, infected, loved etc)* Bizarre delusions* NihilisticdelusionsQ* Behaviour & personality is normalexcept in the delusional areaQ* Behaviour & personality is deteoratedQ in almost allareas* Depressedpersonality* Hallucinations are very rare & if occurare of tactile or olfactory verityQ* Hallucinations are very common1.

Here there is no abstinence, clouding of consciousness & disorientation so it is ruled out.Alcohol induced psychosis (Karsakoff's psychosis) presents with profound amnesia & confabulationQ; so this option is also ruled out.Anxiety neurosis and adjustment reaction are ruled out by absence of stressor and presence of delusions and loss of insight.",

Treatment is based on collaboration between client and therapist and on testing beliefs. Therapy may consist of testing the assumptions which one makes and identifying how some of one's usually unquestioned thoughts are distoed, unrealistic and unhelpful.

Sleep paralysisQ (brief paralysis associated with onset of sleep or wakefulness)Hypnagogic hallucinationsQ (dream like experience while falling asleep but not yet asleep).It usually begins in second decade (10-20 years) Q i.e. adolescence & occurs equally in males and females.The strong genetic association with HLA DR2, specifically HLA DQB1 * 602 (>85%) suggests an autoimmune mechanism.In narcolepsy (esp. with cataplexy), Hypocretins (Orexins), the hypothalamic neuropeptide transmitter, regulating sleep-wake cycle, is decreased in brain and CSF along with the decrease in number of hypocretin-positive cells in hypothalamus.It results from defective REM sleep regulationQ. Sleep attacks & hypnagogic hallucinations are d/t REM intrusion, whereas cataplexy and sleep paralysis is atonia without REM.Diagnosis is confirmed by a sleep onset REM period (on all night PSG) or a positive MSLT in the sleep laboratory.Treatment includes:Stimulant drug eg. dexamfetamine to decrease sleepiness & frequency of sleep attacks.- Modafinil, a non amfetamine stimulant to decrease day time sleepiness with less side effects. - Clomipramine & other antidepressants to decrease cataplexy.",

(These aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are also referred to as PHF, or \"Paired Helical Filaments\").
