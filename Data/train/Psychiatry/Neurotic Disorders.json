        "question": "Defence mechanism in OCD?",
        "exp": "Ans. a (Reaction formation) (Ref Ahuja Psychiatry 6th/pg. 104). Ego defences. All ego defences are automatic and unconscious reactions to psychological stress. E. g. Mature Altruism. Guilty feelings alleviated by unsolicited generosity. Mafia boss makes large donation of charity towards others. Humor. Appreciating the nature of an anxiety provoking or adverse situation. Nervous medical student jokes about the boards. Sublimation. Process whereby one replaces an unacceptable wish with a course of action that is similar to the wish but does not conflict with one's value system. Aggressive impulses used to succeed in business ventures. Suppression. Voluntary (unlike other defenses) withholding of an idea or feeling from conscious awareness. Choosing not to think about the MHPGMCET until the week of the exam. HINT: Mature women wear a SASH: Sublimation, Altruism, Suppression, Humor Immature Acting out. Unacceptable feelings and thoughts are expressed through actions. Tantrums. Dissociation. Temporary, drastic change in personality, memory, consciouness, or motor behaviour to avoid emotional stress. Extreme forms can result in multiple personalities (dissociative identity disorder). Denial. Avoidance of awareness of some painful realityA common reaction in newly diagnosed AIDS and cancer patients. Displacement. Process whereby avoided ideas and feelings are transferred to some neutral person or object. Mother yells at child because she is angry at her husband. Fixation. Partially remaining at a more childish level of development. Men fixating on sports. Identification. Modeling behaviour after another person who is more powerful (thought not necessarily admired). Abused child becomes an abuser. Isolation. Separation of feelings from ideas and events. Describing murder in graphic detail with no emotional response. Projection. An unacceptable internal impulse is attributed to an external source. A man who wants another woman thinks his wife is cheating on him. Rationalization. Proclaiming logical reasons for actions actually performed for other reasons, usually to avoid self-blame. Saying the job was not important anyways, after getting fired. Reaction formation. Process whereby a warded-off idea or feeling is replaced by an unconsciously derived emphasis on its opposite. A patient with libidinous thoughts enters a monastery. Regression. Turning back the maturational clock and going back to earlier modes of dealing with the world. Seen in children under stress (e. g., bed-wetting) and in patients on dialysis (e. g., crying). Repression. Involuntary withholding of an idea or feeling from conscious awareness. The basic mechanism underlying all others. Splitting. Belief that people are either good or bad. A patient says that all nurses are cold and insensitive but that the doctors are warm and friendly.",

It usually arises in the first 5 years of life and is three times more common in boys than in girlso ADHD is characterized by an age inappropriate hyperactivity, impulsiveness and inattention. Hyperactivity is usually the first symptom noticed. o The disorder is dividede into three classes:-# Class I (most common):- All three symptoms are present, i. e., hyperactivity, impulsiveness and inattention. Therefore, it is known as combined subtype.# Class II:- First two symptoms are present, i. e., hyperactivity and impulsiveness. It is known as hyperactiveimpulsive subtype.# Class III (least common):- Only inattention is present. It is known as inattentive subtype. Diagnostic criteria1) Six (or more) of the following symptoms of inattention have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with development level. a) Often make careless mistakesb) Often has difficulty sustaining attentionc) Often does not listend) Often fails to follow through on instruction or of finish taskse) Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activitiesf) Often avoids tasks requiring sustained attentiong) Often looses thingsh) Often is easily distracted by external stimulii) Often is forgetful in daily activities2) Six (or more) of the following symptoms of hyperactivity impulsivity have persisted for at least 6 months to a degree that is maladaptive and inconsistent with developmental level. Hyperactivity: a) Often fidgets or squirmsb) Often leaves seatc) Often moves excessively (may feel restless)d) Often has difficulty playing or engaging in leisure activities quietlye) Is often \"on the go\"f) Often talks excessively. Impulsivity: g) Often blurts out answersh) Often has difficulty awaiting turni) Often inerrupts or intrudes on otherso Other features: - Nonlocalizing neurological soft signs such as clumsiness, left-right confusion, perceptual motor discordination. Treatment of ADH D1) Pharmacotherapy:- Pharmacological treatment is considered to be the first line of treatment of ADHD. Drugs used for ADHD are:-a) CNS stimulants:- These are drugs of choice for ADHD. Methylphenidate is the drug of choice. Other CNS stimulants used are dexmethylphenyldate, dextroamphetamine, Dextroamphetamine + amphetamine, and modafinil (Provigil). Methylphenidate should be used in children of 6 years or above and amphetaminesm should be used in children of 3 years & above. b) Nonstimulant drugs:- Atomoxetine, Bupropion, venlafaxine, alpha-adrenergic agonists (Clonidine, guanfacine). 2) Psychological treatment:- The child and parents should be educated with regard to the ways in which ADHD can affect learning, behavior, self esteem and skills. Goal should be set for the family to improve the child's interpersonal relationships, develop study skills, and decrease disruptive behaviors. 3) Behavior therapy:- The goal of behavior therapy is to identify targeted behavior that cause impairment in child's life so that child can work on pregressively improving his or her skill in these area. It includes management of disruptive behavior at home & class room and improving academic performance.",

Amongst antidepressants SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertaline, citalopram) are the drug of choice for OCD. Treatment of PCD* Drug treatment and behavioral therapy (including cognitive behavioral therapy) are regarded as first line treatments: 1) Drug treatment: - SSRIs antidepressants (Fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertaline, Citalopram, fluvomoxamine) are the drugs of choice. Amongst the TCA only clomipramine is effective as it is the most selective for serotonin reuptake versus norepinephrine reuptake and is exceeded in this respect only by the SSRIs. Other drugs which can be added, if patient is not responding to clomipramine or SSRIs, are Valproate, Carbamazapine, Lithium, venlafaxine, Pindolol, MAOIs, buspirone and clonazepam. 2) Behavior therapy: - Most commonly used behavior therapy is exposure and response prevention. Other behavior techniques are systemic desensitization, Flooding, thought stopping, aversive conditioning and implosion therapy. 3) Psychotherapy: - Psychoanalytic psychotherapy is used in certain selected patients who are psychologically oriented. Supportive psychotherapy must include attention to family members through provision of emotional support, reassurance, explanation and advice on how to manage and respond to the patient. 4) ECT: - For extreme cases that are resistant and chronically debilitating, ECT and psychosurgery are considerations. 5) Psychosurgery: - Psychosurgery can be used in treatment of OCD that has become intractable, and is not responding to other methods of treatment. The procedures employed are: - i) Stereotactic limbic leucotomy (cingulotomy) and ii) Stereotactic Subcaudate tractotomy (capsulotomy).",

        "question": "Behavioral therapy is done in -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Agoraphobia o Most important use of behavioral therapy:- Phobia & OCD. o Other uses are:- Other anxiety disorders (including panic), eating disorders, Autism, ADHD, some personality disorders, sexual dysfunctions, depression.# Behaviour therapy is based on the assumption that all behaviours (normal or abnormal) are learning response. Normal and abnormal behaviours are subject to the laws of learning and the same laws can be used to change them. Behaviour therapty is based on theories of learning and aims at changing the maladaptive behaviour and substituting it with adaptive behaviour. Some common behavioral techniques are:-a) Systemic desensitizaiton:- It is based on the principle of reciprocal inhibition, i. e., if a response is incomaptible with anxiety is made to occur at the same time as an anxiety provoking stimulus then anxiety is reduced by reciprocal inhibition. In this technique first the patient is trained by relaxation technique to decrease anxiety and muscular tension. Then the patient is exposed serially to a predetermined list of anxiety - provoking stimuli graded in a hierarchy from the least to most anxiety provoking stimuli. The patient is advised to signal whenever anxiety occurs. With each signal, patient is asked to relax (as during relaxation technique). After a few trials patient is able to control anxiety. Then the patient moves up to next stimulus level (according to Hierarchy). Thus, gradually the hierarchy climbed till the maximum anxiety provoking stimulus can be faced in the absence of anxiety. Systemic desensitization are used in phobia and OCD. b) Therapeutic-graded exposure:- Therapeutic-graded exposure is similar to systemic desensitization, except that relaxation training is not involved and treatment is usually carried out in a real-life context. This means that the individual must be brought in contact with (i. e., be exposed to) the warning stimulus to learn firsthand that no dangerous consequences will ensue. Exposure is graded according to a hierarchy. For example, Patient afraid of cats might progress from looking at a picture of cat to holding one. c) Exposure & response prevention:- Patient is exposed to a situation (intentional contamination of hand) which ordinarily produces in him a strong urge to carry out rituals (for example hand washing). However, he is prevented from carrying out rituals (e. g., by shutting of water). The anxiety which mounts up dissipates after sometime. It is particularly useful for OCD and some types of phobias. d) Flooding:- This is based on the assumption that fear dissipates when the subject is not allowed to escape from the scene. The subject is exposed to the fear provoking situations abruptly and not in a graded way as in systemic desensitization and without any attempt to reduce anxiety. The sessions continue till fear dissipates. e) Aversion therapy:- Aversion therapy is used for the treatment of conditions which are pleasant but undesirable (e. g., alcoholism, sexual deviation, drug abuse, smoking). The underlying principle is the pairing of the pleasant stimulus (e. g., alcohol) with an unpleasant response (e. g., brief electric stimulus). f) Operant conditioning procedure for decreasing a behavior:-i) Positive punishment:- On performing an undesired behavior an aversive stimulus is given. ii) Negative punishment:- On performance of an undesired behavior, reward is avoided.",
