Freud Psychoanalysis Credit for invention of psychoanalysis belongs to Sigmund FreudQ, (born on 6 may 1956 in Freiburg, Czech Republic spent most of life in Vienna (Austria) & died in Lndon in 1939)Q Principles of role of meaning, free association, resistance, transference, counter transference and parapraxes are at the core of psychoanalysis as a treatmentQ. Other tenets (principles) include unconscious mental activity, role of childhood experiences in shaping adult personality and notion of psychic determination. Concept of psychic determinism means that all mental activity is purposeful & meaningful (not accidental)Q, though unconscious, & is linked with previous experiences of life. Role of meaning - means all symptoms, thoughts, feelings & behaviours are final common pathways of meaningful psychological processes. Many of which were unconscious. So even content of auditory hallucinations (produced by biological factors) is meaningful & shows psychological characteristics unique to that patients. Free association is a technique when patient is asked to say whatever came to mind. Freud recognized that patients often resist the physician's effo to heal reflected by mundane behaviours such as unable to follow suggestions, missing medication or scheduled appointment; all reflecting unconscious resistance to getting better. Parapraxes or slips of tongue, often reveal unconscious intent that is outside the individual's awareness. Transference is patient's displacement of early wishes & feelings toward persons from past onto the analyst or physician. It is influenced by analyst's real characteristics as it is an admixture of figures from the patient's past & the real relationship with the clinician in present. Counter transference is the flip side of transference - the clinician's feelings towards the patientQ, based on mixture of real characteristics of patient and qualities associated with figures from the clinician's past. In classical psychoanalysis, no detailed history taking, mental status examination or formalized diagnosis is attempted. The patient is allowed to communicate unguidedQ, by using free association. Therapist constantly challenges existing defences & interprets resistances and transference (patient's feeling, behaviour & relationship with the therapist)Q. The physician remains passive & his approach is non-directive i. e. no direct advice is ever givenQ to the patient. The crux of therapy is on interpretation.",

Most antipsychotic agents strongly block D 2 receptors, especially in the mesolimbic system. Newly developed antipsychotic agents seem to block 5-HT 2 receptors better than D 2 receptors, suggesting that blockade of dopamine receptors is not the entire story for antipsychotic activity. Phenothiazines also possess antimuscarinic activity, which results in blurred vision, dry mouth, difficulty in urination, and constipation. a1-Blocking activity results in ohostatic hypotension. Blockade of dopamine receptors results in parkinsonism and hyperprolactinemia, which can lead to amenorrhea and infeility in females and impotence in males. Ref: Sanders-Bush E., Hazelwood L. (2011).

These disorders are characterized by disturbance in gender identity, i. e., the sense of one's masculinity or femininity is disturbed. Gender identity disorders have the following two characteristics:? 1. A strong and persistent cross-gender identification which is manifested by:? Repeatedly stated desire to be, or the insistence that he or she is, of the other sex. Wearing the clothes of other sex (cross-dressing), Preference for cross-sex roles in plays or fantasies, Preference for playmates of the other sex. 2. Persistent discomfo with his or her sex. Impoant gender identity disorders are: -Transsexualism: - It has all the characteristics of gender identity disorder (see above). The most characteristic feature is that there is marked preoccupation with the wish to get rid of one's genitals and secondary sex characteristics and to adopt the sex characteristics of other sex (perceived-gender), e. g., Female transexuals request for hysterectomy or mastectomy. Dual-role transvestism: - It is characterized by wearing clothes of the opposite sex to enjoy the temporary experience of membership of the opposite sex, but without any desire for a more permanent sex change (unlike transsexualism). Both transsexualism and dual-role transvestism should be differentiated from fetishistic transvestism which is not a gender identity disorder and characterized by wearing the clothes of other sex for sexual excitement which can be categorized as a disorder of sexual preference. Gender-identity disorder of childhood: - This disorder is similar to transsexualism with a very early age of onset (2-4 years of age).",

Age of onset There has been no general agreement on the definition of late onset. Some chose 40 years of age as the cutoff whereas others defined late onset as onset after 45, 60 or 65 years of age. - To diagnose late onset schizophrenia the patient should meet the DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia (including duration of at least 6 months) with the additional requirement that the onset of symptoms (including the prodrome) be at or age 45. The prototypical patient is middle aged elderly women who functioned moderately well through early adulthood. Late onset schizophrenia meets the same DSM IV criteria as early onset schizophrenia however there appears to be some differences in how the disease presents. More likely to occur in females Increased prevalence of hearing loss and ocular pathology More likely to have tactile, visual and auditory hallucinationsdeg. Olfactory, tactile and gustatory hallucinations less common. More likely to have delusion of persecution These patients are less likely to have \"disorganized thoughts\" and are less likely to have the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. They have more \"positive symptoms\" and fewer \"negative symptoms\".

In opioid dependent (& intoxicated) patients administration of opioid antagonists (eg naloxone & nalmefene; both approved for overdose/intoxication) may produce signs of opioid withdrawl (precipitated opioid withdrawl) as well as reversal of overdose. A relative advantage of naloxone is that withdrawl effects are of sho duration (ti/2 = 60-90 min) in comparison to nalmefene (t1/2 = 10 hours) Opioid related disorder Drugs Used Overdose/Intoxication Naloxone (1st), Nalmefene (2nd)Q Withdrawl Symptoms Methadone (1st), Buprenorphine (symptomatic relief) (2nd), LAAM (no longer used), Clonidine/ Lofexidine (3rd), Benzodiazepines & Tramadol Withdrawl Treatment All above + Naltrexone (for rapid (Detoxification) detoxifiation; however it can't be used alone) Opioid Dependence Methadone, Buprenorphine, (Maintenance LAAM (no longer used / treatment) available / recommended), Naltrexone (to prevent relapseQ) Opioid withdrawl syndrome (symptoms) can be treated by weak or paial opioid agonist such as methadone (drug of 1\" choice)Q, buprenorphine (drug of 2\" choice)Q, LAAM (not recommended as it prolongs QT interval) and a2 adrenergic agonist drugs such as clonidine (drug of 3rd choice)Q and lofexidineQ (clonidine analogue with less hypotensive effect). Weak or paial opioid agonists act by stabilizing the patient on an equivalent drug with less addition/abuse potential, and then the substituted drug is gradually withdrawn. Whereas, a-2 adrenergic agonist drugs are centrally acting sympatholytic agents with no addiction and no narcotic action and relieve opioid withdrawl symptoms by reducing central sympathetic outflow (noradrenergic hyperactivity). Opiate withdrawl treatment (or detoxification) is done by methadone (1st choice), buprenorphine (2nd), LAAM (not recommended), clonidine (3rd) and lofexidineQ. Opioid antagonist naltrexone combined with az adrenergic agonist is used to shoen the duration of withdrawl with out significantly increasing patient discomfo (i. e. rapid & ultra rapid opiate detoxification = ROD). Another benefit of ROD is reduced time between opioid use and commencement of sustained naltrexone treatment for prevention of relapseQ. Ultrarapid opiate detoxification is an extension of ROD using anesthetics. Alpha 2 adrenergic agonists are primarily used for detoxification (treatment of withdrawl symptoms). Weak agonist and paial opioid agonist medications are commonly used for detoxifiation (treatment of withdrawl symptoms) and maintenance treatment for opioid dependence. Opioid antagonists (eg naltrexone) are used to accelerate detoxification (used in withdrawl treatment but does not treat withdrawl symptoms) and then continued post detoxification to prevent relapseQ. Opioid antagonist naltrexone must be staed after detoxification or with a2 agonist, to prevent withdrawl symptoms. For opioid dependence (chronic use), FDA approved maintenance treatment include opioid agonists methadone, buprenorphinQ and LAAM (not preferred; but theoritically can be given) and opioid antagonist naltrexoneQ. Cognitive behavior therapy, psychodynamic & interpersonal therapies, self help and 12-step group therapy, behavioral therapies and therapeutic communities help to achieve opioid abstinence.",

Dissociative disorder are:- Dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia:- It is the most common type of dissociative disorder. Dissociative amnesia is characterized by retrograde amnesia (inability to retrieve stored memories and events leading up to onset of amnesia) and absence of antegrade amnesia (inability to form new long term memories). Dissociative fugue:- A dissociative fugue may be present when a person impulsively wanders or travels away from home and upon arrival in the new location is unable to remember his/her past (i. e., amnesia for early life). There is loss of personal identity and the person assumes a new identity. There is absence of awareness of amnesia during fugue episode, i. e., Patient denies any memory loss during fugue state. On recovery there is amnesia for fugue episodes and recovery of memory of earlier life (i. e., before the episode of fugue). Dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder):- More than one personality appears to possess the individuals, Showing their characteristic behavior. At any instance behavior and memories of one personality is exhibited, patient then is unaware of the other's existance. Depersonalization disorder: - Feeling of detachment from self is referred to as depersonalization. Individuals with this disorder will repo feeling as if they are living in a dream or watching themselves on movie screen i. e., feeling detached from self and as if one is an outside observer of oneself. People with this disorder feel like they are \"going crazy\" and they frequently become anxious and depressed Dissociative disorders not otherwise specified:- These are the disorders that are characterized by dissociative response that do not meet diagnostic criteria for one of the other dissociative disorder. Impoant ones are:- Dissociative Trance (Possession) disorders:- There is temporary exchange of person's personality by a new personality usually attributed to a spirit or divine power. Usually the person is aware of the existance of the other, i. e., possessor (unlike dissociative identity disorder). Ganser's syndrome: - Also known as syndrome of approximate answers.

These two syndrome occur due to deficiency of thiamine. Most common cause precipitating thiamine deficiency (causing wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome) is chronic alcoholism. Other precipitating causes are prolonged starvation causing malnutrition (marasmus), hyperemesis gravidarum, HIV-AIDS, bariatric surgery, prolonged intravenous hyperalimentation, hemodialysis for CRF, and malignancies (gastric carcinoma). Thiamine is a cofactor for several impoant enzymes (transketolase, pyruvate dehydrogenase & a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase). Thiamine deficiency results in decreased utilization of glucose and accumulation of glutamate which causes excitatory damage to neurons. Acute damage (in wernicke's encephalopathy) causes petechial hemorrhage in thalamus, mammillary bodies, midline cerebellum, periaqueductal gray matter of midbrain, and peripheral nerves. In chronic disease (Korsakoff's syndrome) there is atrophy of mammillary body, medial thalamic nuclei, and hippocampus",

Symptoms include disturbances in thoughts (or cognitions), mood (or affects), perceptions, and relationships with others. The hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia are auditory hallucinations and delusions, which are fixed false beliefs. The symptoms of schizophrenia may be divided into the following 4 domains: Positive symptoms: These include psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations, which are usually auditory; delusions; and disorganized speech and behavior. Negative symptoms: These include a decrease in emotional range, povey of speech, loss of interests, and loss of drive. Cognitive symptoms: These include neurocognitive deficits, such as deficits in working memory and attention and executive functions such as the ability to organize and abstract. Mood symptoms: Schizophrenia patients often seem cheerful or sad in a way that does not make sense to others. They often are depressed. Catatonia Schizophrenia This syndrome occurs in children, adolescents, and adults; is associated with a heterogeneous group of comorbid conditions; and is characterized by a variety of symptoms and signs of impairment of the expression of voluntary thoughts and movements.

        "question": "Panic attack is associated with a disturbance in all of the following neurotransmitters except:",
        "exp": "C i. e. Glutamate Panic disorder is associated with noradrenaline (norepinephrine), cholecystokinin (CCK)- pentagastrin /tetrapeptide (administration or agonism of both); GABA (antagonism) and serotonin (decrease). Glutamate studies are either equivocal or in preclinical phase d/t fear of convulsions. Neurochemical Aspects of Panic Disorder Panicogenic Agents Intravenous sodium lactate or inhalation of 5-35% CO2 can induce panic attacks in perons with panic disorder while sparing those without such a history - these substances are k/a panicogenic. Other examples of panicogenic agents include caffeine, cholecystokinin 4, noradrenergic agents yohimbine & isoproterenol, CABA antagonist such as flumezanil, reverse benzodiazepine agonists such as /3-carbolines (because benzodiazepine agonists eg alprazolam, clonazepam treat panic disorders, so drugs reversing their actions precipitate panic attack). Serotonin Gorman's neuroanatomical hypothesis states that both panic attack in humans & conditioned fear responses in animals are similar in autonomic arousal, fear evoked by specific cues (i. e. contextual fear) and avoidance of these cues. Both are mediated by fear network consisting of amygdala & its afferent & efferent projections paiculary its connections with hippocampus, medial prefrontal y-Amino Butyric Acid GABA system is ceainly involved in panic disorder as evidenced by 1) Benzodiazepine agonist such as alprazolam, & clonazepam are effective in treatment of panic disorder. 2) Reverse benzodiazepine agonist such as fl-carbolines cause panic attacks. 3) CABA antagonist such as flumezanil have increased panicogenic effects. Cholecystokinin (CCK) - Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a neuropeptide derived from 112 amino acid precursor compound which acts CCK-A (CCK-1) and CCK-B (CCK-2) receptors. CCK-8 (octapeptide) is most abundant, does not cross BBB (so induce anxiety only after intracranial administration) and acts on both receptors CCK4 (tetrapeptide) is anxiogenic and a primary agonist of CCK-B receptors. Both CCK-4 and CCK-5 (pentagastrin) are panicogenic and effects could be blocked by CCK antagonist or treatment with GABA agonist such as vigabatrin or coex, hypothalamus & brain stem. SSRIs desensitize the fear network. SSRIs increase serotonergic transmission in brain. Serotonergic neurons originate in brain stern raphe & project throughout CNS and some of these projections have inhibitory influences. For example the greater the activity in the raphe. 1) The greater the inhibition of noradrenergic neuron in locus cerulus (resulting in reduction in CVS sysmptoms such as tachycardia). 2) Greater the inhibition in periaqueductal gray region (resulting in reduction in avoidance behavior). 3) Increased senetonergic activity also reduces hypothalmic release of coicotropin releasing factor, thereby resulting in a reduction of coisol and reduction in activity of locus ceruleus thereby 1/t reduction in fear. 4) SSRIs may also directly inhibit activity of lateral nucleus of amygodala. Noradrenaline Noradrenaline (norepinephrine) agents yohimbine & isoproterenol stimulate panic attacks suggesting a possible subsensitivity of presynaptic a2 inhibitory adrenoreceptors. Both increase firing rate of locus ceruleus (brain alarm system). Most effective medications in treatment of panic disorder in fact decrease locus ceruleus firing rate & most panicogenic stimuli increase the locus ceruleus firing rate. tiagabine. However, clinical trials of C1-988, a CCK-B antagonist have failed to abate (treat) anxiety symptoms induced by CCK-4 or MCPP. Patients with panic disorder have lower CSF levels of CCK than healthy controls, although it is unclear whether it is d/t higher CCK turnover or greater receptor sensitivity. CCK has its highest levels in the cerebral coex, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate & putamen, with intermediate levels in thalamus & hypothalamus. It is also prevent in gastrointestinal tract. CCK receptors are found in greatest density in the coex, hypothalamus, substantia nigra & PAG. Glutamate Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter of CNS & precursor of GABA. It consists of 2 families of receptors: Metabotropic (m G1uR) & ionotropic receptors. Several preclinical (animal) studies have shown anxiolytic propeies of group 2 & group 3 m-Glu- receptor agonist. However, human studies have failed to give a result distinct from placebo or were discontinued d/t findings of convulsions in animal studies of compound. This is understandable risk, given that glutamate enhancing drugs have neuro excitatory propeies and glutamate inhibitors are used as anti convulsants. Similarly MG1u-5 and m GIu. R7 antagonists and AMPA/kainate receptor blockers have shown antianxiety propeies in animals.",

        "exp": "Of all the antipsychotic medications, thioridazine is the only one with a strongly recommended dosage ceiling. Dosages exceeding 800 mg daily have been linked to the development of retinitis pigmentosa. Other side effects of thioridazine include ejaculatory inhibition. Although it also produces sedation, a side effect that can be of clinical value in treating agitated psychotic individuals, thioridazine causes fever extrapyramidal side effects than most other neuroleptics. Haloperidol is a widely used butyrophenone antipsychotic that can produce significant extrapyramidal side effects. However, because it is non-sedating and causes little autonomic disturbance, it is effective in low dosages in treating agitation in elderly persons. MAO inhibitors such as phenelzine are used to treat mood disorders. Persons on MAO inhibitor therapy must remain on a diet free of tyramine-containing foods (e. g., aged cheese) to avoid a potentially fatal hypeensive crisis, which can present as severe headache. Lithium carbonate is used in the treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar disorder. The dosage must be adjusted according to blood level. Side effects commonly associated with rising or mildly toxic blood levels include fine tremor of the hands, nausea, anorexia, and diarrhea. Ref: Meyer J. M. (2011). Chapter 16.

Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36-200 hours. Very sho-acting compounds have a half-life of 2-5 hours. They have few residual effects if taken before bedtime, rebound insomnia may occur upon discontinuation and they might cause day time withdrawal symptoms such as next day rebound anxiety with prolonged usage. Examples are brotizolam, midazolam and triazolam. Sho-acting compounds have a half-life of 8-20 hours. They may have some residual effects in the first half of the day if used as a hypnotic. Rebound insomnia, however, is more common upon discontinuation of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines than longer acting benzodiazepines. Examples are estazolam, flunitrazepam, lormetazepam, nitrazepam and temazepam. Long-acting compounds have a half-life of 40-100 hours. They have a risk of accumulation in the elderly and in individuals with severely impaired liver function, but they have a reduced severity of rebound effects and withdrawal.

Reactive (neurotic/exogenous):- Precipitated by external events or stressors, e. g. loss of a loved one, failure in love etc. As no external precipitating factor has been mentioned in the question, this patient is having endogenous depression.

Kluver-Bucy syndrome is a neuro-behavioural syndrome associated with bilateral lesions in the anterior temporal horn or amygdala. Heinrich kluver and Paul Bucy first described the syndrome in 1937 after experimental work where they removed rhesus monkey's temporal lobes. They found that the monkeys developed. Visual agnosia: They could see, but were unable to recognise familiar objects or their use. Oral tendencies: They would examine their surroundings with their mouths instead of their eyes. Hypermetamorphosis: A desire to explore everything. Emotional changes: Emotion was dulled and facial movements and vocalisations were far less expressive. They lost fear where it would normally occur. Even after being attacked by a snake, they would casually approach it again. This was called \"placidity\". Hypersexuality: A dramatic inc rease in ove sexual behaviour, including masturbation, and homosexual and heterosexual acts. They may even attempt copulation with inanimate objects. The syndrome in humans is due to bilateral destruction of the amygdaloid body and inferior temporal coex, most commonly due to herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). It shares visual agnosia and loss of normal fear and anger responses in common with the monkey model but one also seen loss of memory with dementia, distractibility and seizures. The hypersexuality tends to be less ove than in the monkeys but may be public and unacceptable.",

Cognitive therapy is used in depression, panic disorder, GADQ, obscessive compulsive disorder, personality disorder and somatoform disorder (hysteria)Q. - Kaplan-958. Stuttering is treated by combinations of behaviour distraction, relaxation techniques and directed speech modification therapy. Most modern treatments of stuttering include components that target stuttering as, in pa, a learned behaviour that can be modified through behaviour techniques eg self therapy proposed by speech foundation of America. It is based on premise that stuttering is not a symptom, but a behaviour that can be modified. - Kplan's -1188. Somatization disorder combined with conversion disorder was earlier referred to as hysteria (conversion reaction or dissociative reaction). Somatization disorder is treated with cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), brief psychodynamic psychotherapyQ and antidepressants. (Kaplan-638, New oxford-1006). Evidence based psychological treatment of conversion disorder, involve CBT or interpersonal therapy discouraging, 'maintaining factors' such as excessive bed rest and challenging patient's negative or false beliefs (New Oxford-1019). Resolution of conversion disorder is facilitated by insight oriented suppoive or behaviour therapy (i. e. CBT). Hypnosis, anxiolytics, & behaviour relaxation exercises are effective in some cases. Psychodynamic approaches include psychoanalysis & insight oriented psychotherapy, in which patients explore intrapsychic conflictsQ and the symbolism of conversion disorder symptoms.

        "exp": "Vagus nerve. The most commonly used treatments for major depressive episodes are pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. - Although the majority of patients suffering from a major depressive episode improve significantly with these treatments, a minority does not achieve adequate symptom reduction. These minority are described as having treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Although the definition of TRD is itnpetfect, the (STARD) data suggest that patients who have major depression and who have failed to respond to three or four medication trials are treatment resistant. Until recently, few treatments for major depression other than pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) have been available. Now days somatic therapies are being used for TRP.- These new treatments are device-related and/or surgical interventions. for major depression and other psychiatric illnesses, and the field associated with these new treatments often is referred to as \"neurotherapeutics\" or \"neuromodulation\". These treatments are typically (but not always) used in TRD patients. Examples of neurotherapeutic interventions for major depression include:- Ablative limbic system surgeries- Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and- Deep brain stimulation (DBS). Ablative limbic system surgery Procedures used include - Anterior cingulotomy - Subcaudate tractotomy - Limbic leucotomy - Anterior capsulotomy. These procedures have been found to be efficacious in patients suffering. from intractable mood and anxiety disorders with response rates ranging. from 35% to 70% over a period of several weeks to several months, depending upon the response criteria. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) was initially approved for use in treatment-resistant epilepsy in 1994 in Europe and in 1997 in the United States. During the treatment it was noted that many patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy being treated with VNS experienced improved mood. This led to its use for treatment-resistant depression and bipolar disorder. VNS device is surgically implanted around the left vagus nerve an incision in the neck (only the left vagus nerve is used for VNS because the right vagus nerve has parasympathetic branches to the hea). The exact mechanism of VNS is not completely understood. The fibres of vagus have widespread connections to many areas throughout the CNS that are implicated in feeding, arousal, mood, and other \"reflex\" behaviors. It is impoant to note that the FDA-approval language states that VNS is an adjunctive treatment for TRD and that it should be used in patients with severe, chronic, recurrent TRD who have failed at least four adequate antidepressant trials. Transcranial magnetic stimulation. Repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (r. TMS) uses a strong magnetic field introduced on the scalp surface to generate. focal electrical stimulation of the coical surface. To date in the United States, this procedure remains experimental, not approved. for general clinical use with regard to this indication i. e. treatment resistant depression. Deep brain stimulation. DBS involves the placement of electrodes in specified brain regions so that electrical stimulation can be delivered in a targeted manner. To date, one clinical trial of DBS for depression has been published.",

Rett's syndrome seen almost (but not always) exclusively in girlsQ is characterized by apperantly normal initial (prenatal, perinatal and very early i. e. upto -5months) development which means infants have age appropriate motor skills, normal head circumference, growth and excepted reciprocal social interactions. After initial normal development, usually b/w 6 months- 2 years development begins to slow or actually regress and various motor problems sta to develop such as:? purposeful hand movements lost and (replaced by) characteristic stereotypic mrdline hand movements (hand washing / wringing, licking or bitting of finger & tapping or slapping) loss of previously acquired speech and decrease in head growth (lit microcephaly) and social skills poor muscle coordination, ataxia, apraxic-unsteady- stiff gait, seizures (in 75%), EEG changes, irregular respiration with episodes of hyperventilation, apnea, & breath holdingQ (mostly while awake), scoliosis, bruxism, & spasticity Childhood disintegrative disorder (psychosis) or dementia infantilis or Heller's syndrome is characterized by a relative prolonged period (atleast 2 years) of normal development followed by a marked developmental regression and development of various autistic featuresQ. Onset is typically b/w 3 & 4 years. Once established, it resembles autism, however the outcome is even worse. So the child who was normally socially related, spoke in full sentences, and was toilet trained becomes indifferent to social interaction, losses all expressive language, and toilet skills and remains mute & relatively low functioning. Asperger's syndrome is characterized by impairments in social interaction and restricted interests and behaviours as seen in autism. However, unlike autistic disorder, in Asperger's syndrome early development is marked by lack of any clinically significant delay in spoken or receptive language, cognitive development, self help skills, and curiosity aboutthe environment. Patient often exhibits a some what eccentric style (rather than more passive or aloof social style of autism). For example they may engage others in very one sided conversations about their area of special interest, overly reliant on rigid rules and may fail to see the forest for the trees in social matters (eg an appreciation exactly when the usual rules do not apply is as impoant as when they do). It is typical for patient to amass considerable factual information about their topic of interest, which they pursue with great intensity and the family life mayrevolve around the topic of special interest. Motor delay (clumsiness), persistent motor awkwardness & limited ability to appreciate nuances (finer details) with eccentric interest, normal cognition (intelligence) & language more commonly in males is usual presentation.

This disorder is characterized by self imposed dietary restrictions leading to malnutrition and severe weight loss. Clinical features Females are far more commonly affected than males. Onset usually occurs between the age of 10-30 years, usually in mid adolescence. A deliberate and persistent restriction of food is usually the earliest presenting symptom. There is intense fear of becoming of obese, even if body becomes very thin and underweight. There is a body-image disturbance. The person is unable to perceive the body size accurately. Some patients cannot continuously control their voluntary restriction of food intake and So have eating binges. These binges usually occur secretly and often at night and are frequently followed by self-induced vomiting. Patients abuse laxatives and even diuretics to lose weight, and ritualistic exercising, extensive cycling, walking, jogging and running are common activities. Patients with anorexia nervosa exhibit peculiar behavior about food. They hide food all over the house, frequently carry large quantities of candies in their pockets and purses. They try to dispose of food in their napkins or hide in their pockets, while eating meals. They cut their meat into very small pieces and spend a great deal of time rearranging the pieces on their plates. There is significant weight loss and patient is underweight. Amenorrhea is seen in almost all women and loss of libido may occur in male patients. There may be poor sexual adjustment. Obsessive compulsive neurosis, depression and anxiety like psychiatric illness may coexist. Complications of malnutrition may occur, e. g., hypoglycemia, hypothermia, low BP, bradycardia, leucopenia, endocrine changes (raised GH and Coisol, reduced gonadotrophin), and appearance of lanugo hair.",

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) refers to the combination of hypehermia, rigidity, and autonomic dysregulation that can occur as a serious complication of the use of antipsychotic drugs. The list of atypical antipsychotic drugs that may cause NMS include olanzapine, risperidone, paliperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, amisulpride, and quetiapine. Clozapine may also be associated with the development of NMS, but it appears to be less likely to manifest with extrapyramidal features, including rigidity and tremor. The most widely accepted mechanism by which antipsychotics cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome is that of dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Central D2 receptor blockade in the hypothalamus, nigrostriatal pathways, and spinal cord leads to increased muscle rigidity and tremor extrapyramidal pathways. Hypothalamic D2 receptor blockade results in an elevated temperature set point and impairment of heat-dissipating mechanisms. Peripherally, antipsychotics lead to increased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in increased contractility, which can contribute to hypehermia, rigidity, and muscle cell breakdown.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Nihilistic delusions Types of delsions Based on the contents of delusions, they are divided into:- Persecutory delusions (paranoid): - The patient feels that he is being persecuted against. There is false belief that one is being harmed, threatened, cheated, poisoned, harassed or spied on or is a victim of conspiracy to damage his reputation. The supposed persecutor of the patient may be people in the environment (e. g., members of family, neighbours, former friend) or may be political or religious groups. These delusions occur in schizophrenia (especially paranoid), severe affective disorders (sever mania or severe depression), and organic brain syndrome. This is the most common type of delusion. Delusion of persecution may occur in the context of primary delusional experiences, auditory hallucinations, bodily hallucinations or experiences of passivity. Grandiose delusion (expansive delusions): - False belief that one is exceptionally powerful, talented or impoant. These delusions seen most commonly in mania, However, can also occur in schizophrenia and organic states. Delusions of reference: - False belief that ceain objects, people or events have intense personal significance and refer specifically to one self, e. g., believing that a television news reader is talking directly about oneself, or people walking on the road are talking about him. These delusions are seen in schizophrenia, mania and organic states. Religious delusions: - False belief peaining to a religious theme, often grandiose in nature, e. g., believing that one is a special messenger from God. These delusions are seen in schizophrenia. Delusions of love (erotomania): - False belief that another person is in love with one (commoner in woman). In one form, termed de clerambault sydrome, a woman (usually) believes that a man, frequently older and of higher status, is in love with her. Delusion of infidility (morbid jealousy, othello syndrome:- False belief that one's lover has been unfaithful. These are seen in schizophrenia, alcohol related psychosis, organic states. Delusion of misidentification: - a) Capgras syndrome (Delusion of double): - Belief that a familiar person has been replaced by an exact double i. e. an impostor. b) Fregoli syndrome: - Belief that a complete stranger is actually a familiar person already known to one. Delusion of self accusation or guilt: - False feeling of remorse of guilt. It occur in Depression. Nihilistic delusions: - False belief that oneself, others or the world is non-existent or about to end. There are pessimistic ideas that the patient's career is finished, he is about to die, world is doomed. These occurs in severe depression. If nihilistic delusions are accompanied by ideas concerning bodily function failure, e. g., putrefaction of intestines, etc., the syndrome is called COTARD's SYNDROME. Hypochondriacal delusions: - False belief about one's health, patient wrongly believes that he has severe medical illness, contrary to the all medical evidences. It is seen in depression. Delusion of infestations: - False belief that one is infested with small but visible organisms. As a monosymptomatic delusional disorder this is called EKBOM SYNDROME. It is seen in acute confusional state (due to drugs or alcohol withdrawal), in schizophrenia, in dementing illness, and as delusional eloboration of tactile hallucinatory experiences (secondary to formication). Delusion of control: - Belief that his actions, impulses or thoughts are controlled by an outside agency and accordingly called as made action, made impulse or made affect. Also called somatic passivity experiences (passivity phenomenon). Commonly seen in schizophrenia. Delusions concerning possession of thoughts - Patients with delusions about possession of thoughts may lose the conviction that their thoughts are their own. Most commonly seen in schizophrenia. Delusions of thought inseion - thoughts have been implanted by an outside agency. Delusions of thought withdrawal - thoughts are being taken out of their mind. This is usually accompanied by \"thought block\". Delusions of thought broadcast - unspoken thoughts are known to other people through radio, telepathy or in some other way.",

Delirium Tremens:? Some recommend, high dose Benzodiazepene while others recommend antipsychotics. Anticonvulsants are not given to control seizures seen in delirium Tremens. Management of alcoholic rehabilitation. Mainstay of alcoholic rehabilitation involves counselling, education and cognitive approaches. Several medications have also proved beneficial:-Naltrexone (opioid antagonist)? It blocks opioid receptors and thus decrease the activity in dopamine rich ventral tegrnental reward system or decrease the feeling of pleasure or reward if alcohol is imbibed. Acamprosate? Widely used in United States and Europe. The drug inhibits the action of NMDA receptors and has been hypothesized to act by decreasing mild symptoms of protracted withdrawl. Disulfiram (ALDH inhibitor). Drinking alcohol, while taking disulfiram, produces a reaction involving an increased pulse, changes in blood pressure, vomiting and diarrhoea. This can be dangerous especially for patients with heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Thus most clinicians reserve this medication for patients who have a clear history of longer term abstinence associated with prior use of disulfiram and for those who might take the drug under the supervision of another individual.

Parkinsonism Deep brain stimulation It is a neurosurgical procedure involving the implantation of a medical device called a neurostimulator (sometimes referred to as a 'brain pacemaker'), which sends electrical impulses, through implanted electrodes, to specific targets in the brain (brain nuclei) for the treatment of movement and neuropsychiatric disorders. DBS in select brain regions has provided therapeutic benefits for otherwise-treatment-resistant disorders such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia, chronic pain, major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved DBS as a treatment for essential tremor and Parkinson's disease in 1997, dystonia in 2003, and OCD in 2009. DBS is also used in research studies to treat chronic pain, PTSD, and has been used to treat various affective disorders, including major depression; none of these applications of DBS have yet been FDA-approved.",

Association areas of the neocoex Topographical Distribution of NFTs in Alzheimer's disease`The spatiotemporal pattern of progression of NFTs in Alzheimer's disease is steriotypical and predictable. Briefly, the neurofibrillary degeneration stas in the aliocoex of medial temporal lobe (entorhinal coex and hippocampus) and spreads to the associative neocoex, relatively sparing the primary sensory and primary motor and visual coex. 'Enterohinal coex, Hippocampus and Associative areas of neocoex are primarily involved. Taken from 'Neuropathological Alterations in Alzheimer's Disease': Perspectives in Medicine 2011 Braak and Braak distinguished six stages to explain topographical distribution and progression of NFT. Stage IThe first NFTs consistently appear in the Transentorhinal (perihilar) region along with Entorhinal coex proper. Stage IINFTs appear in the CA I region of the Hippocampus. Stage IIINFTs appear in the Limbic structures such as the subiculum of H ppocampal formation. Stage IVNFTs appear in the Amygdala, Thalamus & Claustrum. Stage VNFTs appear in all isocoical areas with the affection of Associative areas. Stage VINFTs appear in primary sensory, motor and visual areas (Primary sensory, motor and visual area are considered most resistant).

        "exp": "Several genes play impoant pathogenic roles in at least some patients with Alzheimer's disease(AD). One is the APP gene on chromosome 21. Adults with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) consistently develop the typical neuropathologic hallmarks of AD if they survive beyond age 40. Presenilin-1 (PS-1) is on chromosome 14 and encodes a protein called S182. Mutations in this gene cause an early-onset AD transmitted in an autosomal dominant, highly penetrant fashion. The Apo E gene on chromosome 19 is involved in the pathogenesis of late-onset familial and sporadic forms of AD. AD most often presents with an insidious onset of memory loss followed by a slowly progressive dementia over several years. Pathologically, atrophy is distributed throughout the medial temporal lobes, lateral and medial parietal lobes and lateral frontal coex. Microscopically, there are neuritic plaques containing A-beta, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau filaments, and accumulation of amyloid in blood vessel walls in coex and leptomeninges. Clinical Manifestation begins with memory impairment and spreading to language and visuospatial deficits. The management of AD is challenging and gratifying, despite the absence of a cure or a robust pharmacologic treatment. Donepezil (target dose, 10 mg daily), rivastigmine (target dose, 6 mg twice daily or 9. 5-mg patch daily), galantamine (target dose 24 mg daily, extended-release), memantine (target dose, 10 mg twice daily), and tacrine are the drugs presently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of AD.

A deliberate and persistent restriction of food is usually the earliest presenting symptom. There is intense fear of becoming of obese, even if body becomes very thin and underweight. There is a body-image disturbance. Patients with anorexia nervosa exhibit peculiar behavior about food. They hide food all over the house, frequently carry large quantities of candies in their pockets and purses. They try to dispose of food in their napkins or hide in their pockets, while eating meals. There is significant weight loss and patient is underweight. Amenorrhea is seen in almost all women and loss of libido may occur in male patients. Obsessive compulsive neurosis, depression and anxiety like psychiatric illness may coexist. Complications of malnutrition may occur, e. g., hypoglycemia, hypothermia, low BP, bradycardia, leucopenia, endocrine changes (raised GH and Coisol, reduced gonadotrophin), and appearance of lanugo hair.

Complex paial seizures are characterized by foal seizure activity accompanied by a transient impairment of the patient's ability to maintain normal contact with the environment (altered sensorium).

This can be a normal behaviour but use definitely need to rule out of few disorders before reaching this conclusion. Recent studies have suggested a possible correlation b/w migraine and behavioural problems. There is nothing in the question to point out towards migraine as a cause of the headache, not there are any specific behavioural problems that can be linked to migraine. Diagnostic criteria for appositional defiantdisorder (ADD) A. A pattern of negativistic, hostile, and defiant behaviour lasting for atleast 6 months, during which four (or more) of the following are present? Often loses temper. Often argues with adults. Often actively defies or refuses to comply with adults' requests or rules. Often deliberately annoys people. Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehaviour. Is often touchy or easily annoyed by others. Is often spiteful and resentful. Is often spiteful or vindictive. Note: Consider a criterion met only if the behaviour occurs more frequently than is typically observed in individuals of comparable age and developmental level. B. The disturbance in behaviour causes clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning. C. The behaviours do not occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic or mood disorder. D. Criteria are not met for conduct disorder, and if the individual is 18 years or older, criteria are not met for antisocial personality disorder.

Dysphoric mood. Tearfulness; sad, downturned expression; slumpedposture; quick temper; irritability; anger. Fatigability. Lethargy and tiredness; noplay after school. Morbid ideation. Self-deprecating thoughts, statements; thoughts ofdisaster, abandonment, death, suicide, orhopelessness. Somatic symptoms. Changes in sleep or appetitepatterns; difficulty inconcentrating; bodilycomplaints, paicularlyheadache and stomachache. QFrequent quarrels with parents and lack of interest in studies for last 6 months are both consistent with a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. However, children with oppositional disorder typically present to the clinic by the age of 8 years. Also headache has not been mentioned as a manifestation in this disorder. The presence of frequent headaches and age of presentation (18 years) make the diagnosis of appositional delusional disorders unlikely. So symptoms of the patient here are not enough to be diagnosed as ADD. Depression can occur at any age including adolescents and young adults. Lack of interest in school is a known feature (anhedonia). Restlessness & irritability are pa of dysphoric mood & explain frequent quarrels with parents.

Other conditions associated with ED include neurologic disorders, endocrinopathies, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and depression. Conditions associated with reduced nerve and endothelium function, such as aging, hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes, alter the balance between contraction and relaxation factors. These conditions cause circulatory and structural changes in penile tissues, resulting in aerial insufficiency and defective smooth muscle relaxation. In some patients, sexual dysfunction may be the presenting symptom of these disorders. Additionally, ED is often an adverse effect of many commonly prescribed medications. Some psychotropic drugs and antihypeensive agents are associated with ED.",

There are six major symptoms of Korsakoff's syndrome: Anterograde amnesia and Retrograde amnesia, severe memory loss Confabulation, that is, invented memories which are then taken as true due to gaps in memory sometimes associated with blackouts Meager content in conversation Lack of insight Apathy - the patients lose interest in things quickly and generally appear indifferent to change. These symptoms are caused by a deficiency of thiamine, which is thought to cause damage to the medial thalamus and possibly to the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus as well as generalized cerebral atrophy. When Wernicke's encephalopathy accompanies Korsakoff's syndrome, the combination is called the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Korsakoff's is a continuum of Wernicke's encephalopathy, though a recognised episode of Wernicke's is not always obvious. Korsakoff's involves damage to neurons; gliosis which is a result of damage to suppoing cells of the central nervous system; and hemorrhage or bleeding in mammillary bodies.",
