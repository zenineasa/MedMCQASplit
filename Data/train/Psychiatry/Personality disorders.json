Mentalization is a social construct that allows a person to be attentive to the mental states of oneself and of others; it comes from a person's awareness of mental processes and subjective states that arise in interpersonal interactions. MBT is based on a theory that borderline personality symptoms, such as difficulty regulating emotions and managing impulsivity, are a result of patients' reduced capacities to mentalize. Thus, it is believed that recovery of mentalization helps patients build relationship skills as they learn to better regulate their thoughts and feelings. MBT was found to be effective for borderline personality disorder in several randomized, controlled research trials.",

Personality traits are 'enduring patterns of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and oneself that are exhibited in a wide range of social and personal contexts' (American Psychiatric Association 2000). The DSM-IV-TR used a \"multi-axial\" diagnostic system. This means that when a diagnosis was made using DSM-IV, attention was paid to five different areas, or axes, that may have affected the individual being diagnosed. Personality disorders were diagnosed on Axis II of the multi-axial system. This axis is reserved for very long-standing conditions of clinical significance. Mental retardation is the only other condition that was diagnosed on Axis II. In DSM-5. the most recent version, there are no axes. Clusters. Personality disorders are organized into three \"clusters\" in both the DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5. The disorders in each cluster share key features or have overlap in terms of the characteristics of individuals who are diagnosed within that cluster. Cluster A'The \"Cluster A\" personality disorders are characterized by odd or eccentric behavior. Individuals with the personality disorders in this cluster tend to experience major disruptions in relationships because their behavior may be perceived as peculiar, suspicious or detached. The \"Cluster A\" personality disorders include:* Schizotypal Personality Disorder* Paranoid Personality Disorder* Schizoid Personality Disorder'Cluster B'The \"Cluster B\" personality disorders are characterized by dramatic or erratic behavior. Individuals with the personality disorders in this cluster tend to either experience very intense emotions or engage in extremely impulsive, theatrical, promiscuous or law-breaking behaviors. The \"Cluster B\" personality disorders include:* Borderline Personality Disorder* Histrionic Personality Disorder* Antisocial Personality Disorder* Narcissistic Personality Disorder'Cluster C'The \"Cluster C\" personality disorders are characterized by anxiety. Individuals with the personality disorders in this cluster tend to experience pervasive anxiety and/or fearfulness. The \"Cluster C\" personality disorders include:* Dependent Personality Disorder* Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder* Avoidant Personality Disorder. PARANOID PERSONALITY DISORDERIndividuals with paranoid personality disorder view others as devious, deceptive, and covertly manipulative. They view themselves as righteous and mistreated by others and vulnerable and open to the possibility of being exploited and therefore need to be on guard. They fear being controlled, demeaned, and discriminated against. As a result, they are wary, suspicious, and looking for cues. The main affect is anger over presumed abuse and they may experience anxiety over perceived threats because of heightened sense of fear and vulnerability. paranoid behaviors that may be recognized, including: inability to confide in others, hostility if it is perceived they are being schemed against, reluctance to sign documents, excessive concern about confidentiality, and a history of repeated termination of employment. Pathological jealously concerning faithfulness of partners is also common Beck and Freeman also describe possible symptoms of paranoid personality disorder: tendency to attribute blame to others, difficulties considering alternative explanations, searching intensely and narrowly for evidence, inability to see humour in situations, strong need for independence, and inability to relax and close his or her eyes. SCHIZOID PERSONALITY DISORDERThe two striking features of schizoid personality disorder are first a lack of interpersonal relationships and the lack of desire to obtain such relationships. The second feature is the presence of'negative symptoms' in the absence of psychotic- like cognitive and perceptual distortions. Prevalence figures range from 0. 5% to 7% in the general population and the diagnosis is more commonly made in men whereas the disorder is uncommon in inpatient psychiatric settings (American Psychiatric Association 2000; Fulton & Winokur 1993). Individuals construct their lives to limit interactions with others and usually select occupations that require minimal social contact and are sometimes in jobs that are below their level of ability. They have a tendency to turn inwards and away from the external world and see themselves as self-sufficient and independent and will sacrifice intimacy in order to preserve autonomy. They consider themselves to be observers rather than participants in the world around them. Some typical thoughts may include: 'going through the motions', 'why bother', 'who cares', 'rather do it by myself', 'emptiness inside', and 'life is unfulfilling'. Despite these thoughts, individuals may believe that they should strive to attain a more conventional lifestyle but recognize that they cannot respond in the same way as others to particular stimuli and may make emotional attachments with animals or inanimate objects. Others may see them as shy, withdrawn, reclusive, isolated, dull, uninteresting, and humourless. Their cognitive style is characterized by vagueness and poverty of thought or concrete thoughtform. Typical behaviours include lethargic and unexpressive movements that lack gestures or alternatively, rhythmic movements, slow and monotonous speech, poor spontaneous speech, or poverty of content of speech, limited eye contact, and may appear ill at ease. Although they may appear sad or anxious during close encounters, they are not inclined to show their feelings either verbally or through facial expressions. SCHIZOTYPAL PERSONALITY DISORDERThis disorder is revalent in approximately 3% of the general population (American Psychiatric Association 2000). The cognitive distortions in these individuals are the most severe of any in the personality disorders and generally consist of suspicious and paranoid ideation, ideas of reference, odd beliefs, magical thinking and illusions. Speech is coherent but may be vague, tangential, circumstantial, or overelaborate, and individuals may engage in emotional reasoning and personalization as a result of their concrete thought-form while affect is often inappropriate or restricted. Generally, the themes expressed by an individual will be unique to them but common thoughts include: believing they are being watched; knowing what people are thinking; feeling something bad is going to happen; believing that they are not going to be liked by others; supposing there are reasons for everything; and believing they are defective. Inappropriate behavior contributes to the extreme social isolation associated with this disorder. Common behavior includes peculiar mannerisms such as excessive hand washing and refusing to touch doorknobs, dressing in an unusual manner, and generally avoiding eye contact Individuals will largely desire social relationships and experience great pain as a result of their isolation. This along with increased stress results in fewer opportunities for reality testing with others and the possibility of deterioration to a psychotic condition.",

Kleptomania may begin in childhood, although most children and adolescents who steal do not become kleptomaniac adults. The onset of the disorder generally is late adolescents. The key feature of the diagnosis of kleptomania that separates it from more common theft is the fact that the items stolen are not needed for personal use or their monetary value and the thefts are not committed to express anger or vengeance or in response to a delusion or a hallucination. Most (not all) kleptomaniacs steal from retail stores, but they may also steal from family members in their own households. The course of the disorder waxes and wanes but tends to be chronic.

Evidence is accumulating that Type D may also be a risk factor for adverse outcome across CVD patient groups, including patients undergoing revascularization with drug-eluting stent implantation or bypass surgery, patients with heart failure, peripheral aerial disease, and arrhythmia. In these patient groups, Type D personality has been associated with a 2-5 fold increased risk of adverse prognosis, impaired quality of life and symptoms of anxiety and depression independent of traditional biomedical risk factors, including disease severity.

It is a type of Behavior therapy' (which in turn is a type of Psychotherapy). It is based on the principle of \"Respondent Conditioning\". It was first elaborated by VVolpe. It is used to treat 'Phobias' (Specific and Social). It consists of three steps: 1. Hierarchy chart (where anxiety/fear provoking stimuli are identified and charted from lowest to highest level of potency in inducing the anxiety/ fear). 2. Coping skills (learning to relax by various methods like - paced breathing exercises, Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation, applied relaxation by meditation). 3. Graded exposure (applying the relaxation techniques after exposing oneself to the anxiety/ fear provoking stimuli in graded manner, i. e., from weakest stimulus to strongest stimulus). Other Forms of Exposure Therapy1. Flooding-sudden exposure and making one to cope up at one go. 2. Virtual Reality Exposure - useful for PTSD. 3. ERP- Exposure and Response Prevention-Unlike other exposure therapies, here, the escape is not allowed completely and even in between the sessions. Used in OCD. Psychotherapyit is one of three forms of therapy (the other two are - chemical, i. e.. drugs and physical, ie., ECT, Psyehosurgery, VNS, r. TMS). It involves patient-therapist co-operation and usually conducted in sessions. The following is an outline of psychotherapies practised worldwide. 1. Supportive psychotherapy (often termed as counseling), is the most widely used method2. Cognitive therapy (for depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, sexual disorders)3. Behavior therapy (anxiety disorders like OCD. Childhood behavioral problems). 4. Cognitive-Behavior therapy (CBT)- Highly useful and often an alternative to substance abuse (a special form called Motivation Enhancement Therapy used here), depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, sexual disorders. 5.

Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD), also called anankastic personality disorder, is a personality disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, mental and interpersonal control at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency. In contrast to people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), behaviors are rational and desirable to people with OCPD. OCPD is a chronic non-adaptive pattern of extreme perfectionism, preoccupation with neatness and detail, and a need for control or power over one's environment that causes major suffering and stress, especially in areas of personal relationships. Persons with OCPD are usually inflexible and controlling. They may find it hard to relax and must plan out their activities down to the minute. OCPD occurs in about 1% of the general population.

The fear is morbid because: -a) The fear is irrational: The objects or situations do not produce fear in normal persons. b) The fear is out of proportion to the dangerousness perceived that the affected person avoids the situation permanently. c) Patient is unable to control the fear and is very distressed by it. o The common types of phobia are: -1) Agoraphobia. This is an example of irrational fear of situations. It is the commonest type of phobia encountered in clinical practice. It is characterized by an irrational fear of being in places away from familiar setting of home and patient believes that he cannot escape from these places, to a safer place (usually home). This fear results in avoidance of these places which include public places, stores, crowd, travelling alone in bus, train or plane, Theaters, Tunnels, Bridge, standing in line small enclosed rooms or lifts. The patient is afraid of all the places or situations from where escape may be perceived to be difficult if he suddenly develops embrassing or incapaciating symptoms. These embrassing or incapaciating symptoms are the classical symptoms of panic. A full-blown panic attack may occur (agoraphobia with panic disorder) or only a few symptoms (like dizziness or tachycardia) may occur (agoraphobia without panic disorder). 2) Social phobia. In social phobia there is irrational fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is concerned about negative evaluation or scrutiny by others, for example: Public speaking; writing/drinking/eating in public; using public lavatories. Feared social or performance situations may produce anxiety symptoms, even a panic attack. Therefore, feared social or performance situations are avoided. 3) Specific (simple) phobia. These are phobias limited to highly specific situations or objects, for example. i) Claustrophobia: - Fear of closed spacesviii) Mysophobia: - Fear of dirt & germsii) Acro/Aerophobia: - Fear of high placesix) Erythrophobia: - Fear of blushingiii) Zoophobia: - Fear of animalsx) Sitophobia: - Fear of eatingiv) Pyrophobia: - Fear of firexi) Ailurophobia: - Fear of catsv) Xenophobia: - Fear of strangersxii) Sitaphobia Fear of dogsvi) Algophobia: - Fears of painxiii) Hydrophobia: - Fear of watervii) Thanatophobia: - Fear of death",
