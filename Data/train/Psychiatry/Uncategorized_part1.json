A traumatic event in the past. Point 2: 'Intentionality' or 'aboutness' is an impoant factor for PTSD. Nightmares, flashbacks or reliving experiences should be related to the past event. PTSD concerns memory - Intrusion of past stressors into the present. Point 3: Avoid a 'stimulus' or 'activity' that provokes the memory of the past event. In the above question, only reliving experience is mentioned as connected to the past experiences. Hence, that is the answer for this question.

        "exp": "Beck Cognitive therapy is a psychotherapy developed by American pyschiatrist Aaron T. Beck. Cognitive therapy is one of the therapeutic approaches within the larger group of cognitive behavioural therapies. Cognitive therapy seeks to help the client overcome difficulties by identifying and changing dysfunctional thinking, behaviour and emotional responses. This involves helping clients develop skills for modifying beliefs, identifying distoed thinkings, relative to others in different ways and changing behaviours. Treatment is based on collaboration between client and therapist and on testing beliefs. Therapy may consist of testing the assumptions which one makes and identifying how some of one's usually unquestioned thoughts are distoed, unrealistic and unhelpful. Once, those thoughts have been challenged, ones feelings about the subject matter of those thoughts are more easily subject to change. Beck initially focussed on depression and developed a list of errors in thought that he proposed could maintain depression, including arbitrary inference, selective abstraction, over generalization and magnification (of negatives) and minimization (of positives). According to Beck's theorey of the etiology of depression, depressed people acquire a negative view of the world in childhood and adolescence. Children and adolescent who suffer from depression acquire this negative view earlier. Depressed people acquire such view through a loss of a parent, rejection by peers, (criticism from teachers or parents, the depressive attitude and other negative events). When the person with such view encounters a situation that resembles the original conditions of the learned view in some way, even remotely, the negative views of the persons are activated. A simple example may illustrate the principle of how cognitive therapy works Having made a mistake at work, a person may believe \"I am useless and can't do anything right at work\". Strongly believing this then tends to worsen his mood. The problem may be worsened fuher if the individual reacts by avoiding activities and then behaviourally confirming the negative belief to himself. As a result, any adaptive response and fuher constructive consequences become unlikely, which reinforces the original belief of being useless. In therapy, the latter example could be identified as a self fulfilling prophecy or \"problem cycle\" and the effos of the therapist and client would be directed at working together to change it.",

Acute onset, presence of fever, no history of psychiatric illness suggests delirium. But, the diagnosis of delirium cannot be made definitively in the absence of disorientation. In the question there is no definite comment on orientation of the patient. May be, that suggests, the patient is not disoriented. Acute onset, presence of perceptual disturbances (hallucination and other symptoms point towards acute psychosis. But acute psychosis seems unlikely because:-- Absence of cognitive dysfunction or thought disorders.- Absence of H/o psychiatric illness or substance abuse disorders. Psychotic disorders cannot be diagnosed only in the presence of perceptual disturbances. Some disorder in cognitive dysfunction or thought disorders is also required. May be this is a case of acute transient psychosis- These disorders do not give the classical manifestations of psychotic disorders.- They are characterized by the predominance of perceptual disturbances, and they do not fulfil the criteria of psychotic disorders. Acute and Transient Psychotic disordersA large number of psychiatrists especially from the developing countries like India, repoed that many patients developed an acute psychotic disorder that neither followed the course of schizophrenia nor resembled mood disorders in the clinical picture and usually had a better prognosis than schizophrenia. Acute and transient psychosis as a descriptive entity was recognized only with the advent of 1. CD-10 in 1992. Where it is included under psychotic disorder.- The key features that characterize the disorder are an -- acute within (2 weeks) onset in all the cases presence of typical syndrome which are described as rapidly changing variables, polymorphic states and typical schizophrenic symptoms evidence, for associated acute stress in a substantial number of cases and complete recovery in most cases within 2-3 months. A pa from these criteria ICD-10 also provides diagnostic guide- lines which include- Not meeting the criteria for manic or depressive episodes although the affective symptoms may be prominent - Absence of organic causation although perplexity confusion and inattention may he present. - Absence of obvious intoxication by drugs or alcohol. It is evident that ICD 10 intends to \"clearly differentiate\" the concept of acute transient psychosis. from those of affective psychosis, organic psychosis and drug induced psychosis. This is the point which is creating doubt in our minds. The ICD wants to clearly differentiate it from organic psychosis.- The boy presents with \"fever\" therefore the organic cause for the psychosis cannot be ruled out. - May be the psychosis is due to fever (some C. N. S. infection)- If fever had not been mentioned the diagnosis would have been clear. But the presence of fever prevents us from diagnosing this as acute transient psychosis.- The correct option would have been \"organic psychosis\" or \"psychosis due to general medical condition\". - Acute psychosis cannot be diagnosed without addressing the organic basis of the disease. Four subtypes of acute transient psychosis are described in ICD 10 -Acute polymorphic psychotic disorder without symptoms of schizo- phrenia - Acute polymorphic psychotic disorders with symptoms (? f schizo- phrenia - Acute schizophrenia like psychotic disorder- Acute predominantly delusional psychotic disorder. Overall, duration of total episode should not exceed 3 months and that. for schizophrenic symptoms should not exceed 1 month. There is provision for change of diagnosis to schizophrenia.",

Acute psychosis- Delusions or hallucinations (suchas hearing voices in this case) with grossly disorganized speech and behavior (such as muttering to self, gesticulation, aggressiveness in this case) of acute onset with normal cognition & consciousness indicate the diagnosis of acute psychosis (i. e. psychosis of acute onset). This acute psychosis may be d/t psychotic disorder d/t general medical condition (such as high fever as in this case) or d/t brief psychotic disorder (DSMIVTR), or d/t acute and transient psychotic disorder (ICD-10). So here the term acute psychosis is used to depict the clinical picture not the cause of that clinical picture. Delirium can also present acute onset disorganized behavior (agitation) and speech (incoherent) with delusions or hallucinations but the delusions are poorly elaborated & transient, the course of disease is fluctuant (eg sun downing). And characteristically there is clouding of (disturbance in) consciousnesss (i. e. reduced clarity of awareness of the environment) and disorientation (change in cognition) in delirium. Just like psychosis clinical picture of delirium may also be d/t various reasons such as general medical condition / substance intoxication/ withdrawal.- Dementia is a chronic slow/insiduous process presenting with decrement in intellectual abilities (such as sho & long term memory, judgement, abstract thinking, impulse control, personal care and personality)Q.- Delusional disorder presents with nonbizarre delusions (involving situations that occur in real life) of at least 1 months durationQ.

In classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus (which usually does not produce the response), when paired with unconditioned stimulus (stimulus which usually produces a response), directly produces a response. The typical example of classical conditioning is pavlov's experiment. Normally food produces salivation in dog, Therefore salivation in response to food is called unconditioned response and the stimulus, i. e., food is called unconditioned stimulus. Under normal circumstances, a dog does not salivate at the sound of a bell. However, if the sound of bell is paired consistently with presentation of food, the dog begans to salivate to the sound of bell even if the food is not presented. This learned response, i. e., salivation to a sound of bell without food, is called conditioned response and the stimulus (sound of a bell) is called conditioned stimulus. There is a reverse side to classical conditioning, called counter conditioning. This amounts to reducing the intensity of conditioned response (e. g., anxiety) by establishing an incompatible response (e. g., relaxation) to a conditioned stimulus (i. e., snake). So anxiety symptoms can be reduced when the stimuli to anxiety are presented in graded order and systemically paired with a relaxation response. This process of reciprocal inhibition is called systemic desensitization. Other behavioral therapies based on classical conditioning principle (counter conditioning) are exposure with response prevention and aversion therapy.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Mania. Mania is characterized by extremely elevated mood, energy, unusual thought patterns and sometimes psychosis. It is most often associated with bipolar disorder, where episodes of mania may cyclically alternate with episodes of major depression. Manic symptoms include irritability, anger or rage, delusions, hypersensitivity, hypersexuality, hyper-religiosity, hyperactivity, impulsiveness, racing thoughts, talkativeness, pressure to keep talking or rapid speech, and grandiose ideas and plans, decreased need for sleep (e. g. feels rested after 3 or 4 hours of sleep). A mnemonic used to remember the symptoms of mania is DIGFAST: D = DistractibilityI = IndiscretionG = GrandiosityF = Flight of ideasA = Activity increasedS = Sleep (decreased need for)T = Talkativeness (pressured speech). Dysphoric mania is primarily manic and agitated depression is primarily depressed. Acute mania in bipolar disorder is typically treated with mood stabilizers and/or antipsychotic medication. Treatments need to be prescribed and monitored carefully to avoid harmful side-effects such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome with the antipsychotic medications. Antipsychotics and mood stabilizers help stabilize mood of those with mania or depression. They work by blocking the receptor for the neurotransmitter dopamine and allowing serotonin to still work, but in diminished capacity. Lithium is the classic mood stabilizer to prevent fuher manic and depressive episodes. More recent drug solutions include lamotrigine.",

        "exp": "Autism Prevasive developmental disorder includes the following condition:- Autism - Rett's disorder - Asperger's disorder - Childhood disintegrative disorder - Pervasive disorders not otherwise specified Pervasive development disorders are characterized by three symptom clusters? i) Impairment in social reciprocity marked by poor eye contact, lack of interest in other people and failure to interact appropriately with others. ii) Communicative impairment, it is characterized by either no language at all or by dent speech with errors in tone, prosody, pitch, grammar, or pragmatics. iii) Restricted and repetitive behaviours include using the same words and phrases repeatedly out of context, performing the same action in routine ways or insisting that others do so, or exhibiting other vocal or visual self stimulatory behaviours. Stereotype movements are seen. Stereotype movements are apparently purposeless movements such as hand flapping, head rolling or body rocking.) Now, the salient feature of each pervasive disorder: Autistic disorder It gives all the classical features of pervasive developmental disorder. The patient presents with problems in social interaction, communication and repetitive sterotype behaviour. In most of these patients there is subnormal intelligence. Example A 3 year old boy shows no interest in or connection to his parents, other adults or children. He does not speak voluntarily and is fascinated with watching rotating objects. He screams fiercely when his environment is altered in any way such as when his mother tries to dress him. Rett's disorder It is seen exclusively in females. The characteristic feature of these patients is that they begin to lose their acquired skills. Example After 4 months of normal development, an infant begins to lose her acquired skills. By 18 months of age, she shows little social interaction with her parents, other adults or children and she uses strange hand gestures. Asperger's disorder The impoant point in differential diagnosis of these patients is that they have normal intelligence. These are the only pervasive development disorders in which the intelligence is unimpaired. These patients often have some exceptional ability. They have little or no developmental language delay and relatively normal cognitive development. In the question the lack of social interaction and communication along with stereotypic behaviour (watching her own hard) suggests Autistic disorder. The patient does not give any symptoms of attention deficit disorder i. e. there are no symptoms indicating lack of concentration and hyperactivity. The patients of ADHD can also present with symptoms similar to pervasive developmental disorder but the main complaint will always be that of attention deficit and hyperactivity. Patients with depression should give other features of depression. 200. Ans is (I)) i. e. Serotonin Suicide is caused by diminished serotonin level Serotonin is a hormone that acts as neurotransmitter. Serotonin levels in our body affects a wide range of mental and physical responses and plays a significant role in activities such as temperature regulation, longer sensations,, sexual behaviour and sleep patterns. Serotonin receptors also help to regulate emotions, cognition, pain and sensory motor function. Serotonin deficiencies can give rise to wide range of illnesses depending on the pa of the brain that is affected. Other neurotransmitters may send the message that we are full but serotonin level determines if we are satisfied. Low serotonin levels in the brain are linked to clinical depression, suicidal tendencies, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive behaviours (such as builimia), schizophrenia sleep problems, migraine, headaches, autism, drug and alcohol addiction, Alzhiemer's diseases and patterns of violent behaviour. \"Diminished central serotonin plays a role in suicidal behaviour. A group at the karolinska institute was the first to note that low concentrations of the serotonin metabolite 5 Hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5. HIAA) in the lumbar cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) were associated with suicidal behaviour. \" This finding has been replicated many times and in different diagnostic groups. Postmoem neurochemical studies have repoed modest decrease in serotonin itself or 5. HIAA, in either the brain stem or frontal coex of suicide victims. Post moem receptor studies have repoed significant changes in presynaptic and postsynaptic serotonin binding sites in suicide victims.",

Personality Traits: Temprament & Character. Personality is the dynamic (constantly changing) psychobiological organization within the individual that modulate their unique adaptations to a changing internal and external environment and characterize their differences in outlook, thoughts, emotions and actions. Inflexibility in personality is an indicator of personality disorder. A person may feel and act differently on different situations (such as on a date, at work or school, in church, or with trusted friend), although his personality doesn't change. So the way a person adapts to 5 different types of situations distinguish layers of personality. Sexual situations involving reproduction & sexuality. Material situations involving quest for material possessions & power Emotional situations involving emotions and social attachment Intellectual situations involving communication & culture. Spiritual situations involving quest for what is beyond individual human existence. Temperament and character together constitute personality. Temprearment is the innate predisposition to behave in a paicular manner. Temperamental traits are biases in emotional response that are fully developed early in life and relatively stable there after whereas, character is a configuration of habbits, a disposition, consisting in the actualized aspects acquired through learning and shaped by experience. It involves higher cognitive processes that develop in a stepwise manner over the life time to enable a person to regulate his emotions, maintain paicular values and viues and achieve ceain goals.

The fear is irrational: The objects or situations do not produce fear in normal persons. The fear is out of propoion to the dangerousness perceived that the affected person avoids the situation permanently. Patient is unable to control the fear and is very distressed by it. The common types of phobia are:? 1. Agoraphobia This is an example of irrational fear of situations. It is the commonest type of phobia encountered in clinical practice. It is characterized by an irrational fear of being in places away from familiar setting of home and patient believes that he cannot escape from these places, to a safer place (usually home). This fear results in avoidance of these places which include public places, stores, crowd, travelling alone in bus, train or plane, Theaters, Tunnels, Bridge, standing in line small enclosed rooms or lifts. The patient is afraid of all the places or situations from where escape may be perceived to be difficult if he suddenly develops embrassing or incapaciating symptoms. These embrassing or incapaciating symptoms are the classical symptoms of panic. A full-blown panic attack may occur (agoraphobia with panic disorder) or only a few symptoms (like dizziness or tachycardia) may occur (agoraphobia without panic disorder). 2. Social phobia In social phobia there is irrational fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is concerned about negative evaluation or scrutiny by others, for example: Public speaking; writing/drinking/eating in public; using public lavatories. Feared social or performance situations may produce anxiety symptoms, even a panic attack. Therefore, feared social or performance situations are avoided. 3. Specific (simple) phobia These are phobias limited to highly specific situations or objects, for example. Claustrophobia:-Fear of closed spaces Acro/Aerophobia:-Fear of high places Zoophobia:- Fear of animals Pyrophobia:- Fear of fire Xenophobia:- Fear of strangers Algophobia:- Fears of pain Thanatophobia:- Fear of death Mysophobia:- Fear of di & germs Erythrophobia:- Fear of blushing Sitophobia:- Fear of eating Ailurophobia:- Fear of cats Sitaphobia:- Fear of dogs Hydrophobia:- Fear of water",

Read below - Perseveration is goal-directed (However, it is repeated beyond the fulfillment of goal), on the other hand, stereotypy is not goal-directed. Perseveration requires an external stimulus, but stereotypy does not. For example:- If you ask the person `QI - What is your name? ' Ansi- Ramesh'. Q2 - 'Where are you'. Ans2 - 'Ramesh'. Q3 \u00ad'What is the Day'. Ans 3 - 'Ramesh'. This is an example of perseveration. Here the external stimulus is given by asking the Question and the person gave a goal-directed answer. However, he repeated the same answer again, i. e. repetition beyond the fulfillment of a goal.

They have very low risk of extrapyramidal side effects, weight gain and diabetis. This are also a distinguishing factors from other Atypical Antipsychotics.

Sexual drive theory, that human beings, from bih, possess an instinctual libido (sexual appetite) that develop in 5 stages - the oral, the anal, the phallic, the latent, and the genital - is characterised by the erogenous zone that is the source of the libidinal drive. Sigmund freud proposed that if the child experienced anxiety, thwaing his or her sexual appetite during any libidinal (phychosexula) deveolpement stage, said anxiety would persist into adulthood as a neurosis, a functional mental disorder.

Obsessions are defined as recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images that are intrusive, inappropriate, and cause anxiety and distress. Patients realize that these thoughts and images are a product of their own mind and they will attempt to suppress them. In addition to obsessions, patients experience compulsions. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that a person performs in accordance with an obsession. The behaviors are aimed at reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation. Locking doors is a common compulsion, and thus this patient meets the diagnostic criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive anxiety and apprehensive expectation for a period greater than 6 months. Patients experience anxiety, cognitive vigilance, autonomic hyperactivity, motor tension, irritability, and poor concentration. Compulsions are not a pa of this disorder. Panic disorder is characterized by episodes of panic. Patients have a discrete period of intense fear with tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, trembling, shoness of breath, chest pain and tightening, abdominal discomfo, fear of dying, and paresthesias.

Dosages exceeding 800 mg daily have been linked to the development of retinitis pigmentosa. Other side effects of thioridazine include ejaculatory inhibition. Although it also produces sedation, a side effect that can be of clinical value in treating agitated psychotic individuals, thioridazine causes fever extrapyramidal side effects than most other neuroleptics. Haloperidol is a widely used butyrophenone antipsychotic that can produce significant extrapyramidal side effects. However, because it is non-sedating and causes little autonomic disturbance, it is effective in low dosages in treating agitation in elderly persons. MAO inhibitors such as phenelzine are used to treat mood disorders. Persons on MAO inhibitor therapy must remain on a diet free of tyramine-containing foods (e. g., aged cheese) to avoid a potentially fatal hypeensive crisis, which can present as severe headache. Lithium carbonate is used in the treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar disorder. The dosage must be adjusted according to blood level. Side effects commonly associated with rising or mildly toxic blood levels include fine tremor of the hands, nausea, anorexia, and diarrhea. Ref: Meyer J. M. (2011). Chapter 16.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Thinking Delusion is an incorrect belief which is out of keeping with the person's cultural context, intelligence and social background and which is held with unshakeable conviction' Primary delusiona are commonly associated with schizophrenia. Some of the more common delusion themes are: Delusion of control: This is a false belief that another person, group of people, or external force controls one's thoughts, feelings, impulses, or behavior. A person may describe, for instance, the experience that aliens actually make him or her move in ceain ways and that the person affected has no control over the bodily movements. Thought broadcasting (the false belief that the affected person's thoughts are heard loud), thought inseion, and thought withdrawal (the belief that an outside force, person, or group of people is removing or extracting a person's thoughts) are also examples of delusions of control. Nihilistic delusion: A delusion whose theme centres on the nonexistence of self or pas of self, others, or the world. A person with this type of delusion may have the false belief that the world is ending. Delusion of infidelity/ delusional jealousy: A person with this delusion falsely believes their spouse or lover is having an affair. This delusion stems from pathological jealousy, and the person often gathers \"evidence\" and confronts the spouse about the nonexistent affair. Delusion of guilt or sin/ Delusion of self-accusation: This is a false feeling of remorse or guilt of delusional intensity. A person may, for example, believe he has committed some horrible crime and should be punished severely. Delusion of mind being read: The false belief that other people can know one's thoughts. This is different from thought broadcasting in that the person does not believe their thoughts are heard loud. Delusion of the person falsely believes that insignificant remarks, events, or objects in one's environment have personal meaning or significance. For instance, a person may believe they are receiving special messages from newspaper headlines. Grandiose delusion: An individual is convinced they have special powers, talents, or abilities. Sometimes, the individual may actually believe they are a famous person or character (for example, a rock star). Persecutory delusion: These are the most common type of delusions and involve the theme of being followed, harassed, cheated, poisoned or drugged, conspired against, spied on, attacked, or obstructed in the pursuit of goals.",

It is also k/ a Wernicke - Korsakov syndrome, because it often follows an acute neurological syndrome called Wernicke's encephalopathy comprising delirium, ataxia, opthalmoplegia, nystagmus & peripheral neuropathy. It is a potentially reversible conditionQ caused by thiamine deficiency most commonly associated with chronic alcohol abuse malnutrition. But other causes of malnutrition eg. starvation, hyperemesis gravidarum, dialysis, cancer, AIDS, gastric plication or prolonged IV hyperalimentation, alone can also result in thiamine deficiency & KP. Neuropathological lesion caused by thiamine deficiency is usually widespread but most consistent changes are seen in bilateral dorsomedial (& anterior) nucleus of thalamus, mammillary bodies, and hippocampus, in form of small vessels hyperplasia; petechial hemorrhages, astrocytic hyperophy & degenerationQ. It disrupts a critical circuit between hippocampus & frontal lobes. The changes are also seen in periventricular (around 3rd ventricle), periaqueductal grey matter, cerebellum, and brain stem (midbrain, pons, medulla fornix) as symmetrical lesions. The cardinal feature is a profound deficit of episodic memory, confabulation and lack of insight into the amnesiaQ. It presents as: Change in personality (frontal lobe like) such that they display lack of initiative, interest or concern & diminished spontaneity. - Executive function deficits involving attention, planning, set shifting, & inferential reasoning. - Apathy, passivity & confabulationQ are often prominent. There is disorientation for time, emotional blunting, & ineia. - There is little impairment in implicit memory and their ability to perform (complete) complex motor procedures remain intactQ. Typically general intelligence, perceptual skills & language remain relatively normalQ. Memory disorder - Profound deficit of episodic type explicit (declarative) memory 1/t loss of autobiographic information (often extending back for many years). Severe anterograde amnesia (learning defect) for verbal & visual material with a lack of insight into the amnesia. Events are recalled immediately after they occur, but forgotten a few minutes later. Thus digit span, testing the sho term memory store, is normal. Storage is mildly impaired but retrieval & learning are severely impairedQ. When patients learn new material they will forget it at a normal rate, but learning the new material is extremely difficult, and in severe cases new learning is impossible. So these patients have difficult encoding & consolidating explicit memory. - Retrograde amnesia back to the onset of illness, is as severe as anterograde loss; but the overall retrograde memory impairment (i. e. before the onset of illness) is not as severe as that of anterograde memory. New learning & recent memory is grossly defective but retrograde (remote) memory is relatively (variably) preserved, and show a temporal gradient, with older memories better preserved. As a result these patients retain more distant memories dramatically more proficiently than they learn new material. - Although remote memory is surprisingly intact, patients are unable to organize them in a temporal context. So they disto the relationship between facts and fill the remote memory gaps by confabulationQ (a vivid & wholly fictitious account of recent activities which the patient believes to be true).",

Predisposing Factors for PTSDFemale genderQ neuroticism. Previous history of trauma. Lower intelligence and lack of suppo. QPersonal history of mood and anxiety disorder. QNeurobiological Factors: Monoamine neurotransmitters and HPA axis mediate defensive response to stressful events. Small hippocampus leads to dysfunctional and inadequate memory processing while increased noradrenergic activity of amygdala, increases arousal and facilitates automatic recall and encoding of traumatic events. Clinical Presentation: May begin very soon after stressors or after an interval of days (usually), months (occasionally) or rarely more than 6 months. Symptoms must be present for at least 1 month, until then it is called acute stress disorder. Must leads to significant distress or impaired social functioning. Flash backs, nightmares and intrusive images collectively known, as painful re-experiencing symptoms along with avoidance, emotional numbing and fairly constant hyper arousal are most characteristic feature. Treatment: Structured psychotherapy is more effective than drug treatments. Counseling is TOC for sho term PTSDQCognitive behaviour therapy is TOC for severe long standing PTSDQDrug treatment: Antidepressants and benzodiazepines (in low doses for sho periods) are useful in treatment, if anxiety and/or depression are impoant components of the clinical picture.

Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent and frequent episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food and feeling a lack of control over these episodes. This binge-eating is followed by behavior that compensates for the overeating such as forced vomiting, excessive use of laxatives or diuretics, fasting, excessive exercise, or a combination of these behaviors. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by emaciation, a relentless pursuit of thinness and unwillingness to maintain a normal or healthy weight, intense fear of gaining weight, distoed body image, a self-esteem that is heavily influenced by perceptions of body weight and shape, or a denial of the seriousness of low body weight, lack of menstruation among girls and women, extremely restricted eating. With binge-eating disorder a person loses control over his or her eating. Unlike bulimia nervosa, periods of binge-eating are not followed by purging, excessive exercise, or fasting. As a result, people with binge-eating disorder often are over-weight or obese. Adjustment disorder occurs when an individual is unable to adjust to or cope with a paicular stressor, like a major life event.

This involves helping clients develop skills for modifying beliefs, identifying distoed thinking, relative to others in different ways and changing behaviors'. Treatment is based on collaboration between client and therapist and on testing beliefs. Therapy may consist of testing the assumptions which one makes and identifying how some of one's usually unquestioned thoughts are distoed, unrealistic and unhelpful. Once, those thoughts have been challenged, ones feelings about the subject matter of those thoughts are more easily subject to change.",

This is called \"hinging\". - The person may feel gaining weight after a binge. Binging also can cause fear of shame and guilt. So the person tries to undo the binge by getting rid of the. food. This is called purging. Purging might be done by:? - Making yourself throw up - Taking laxative - pills or liquids that speed up the movement of food - Exercising a lot - Eating very little or not at all - Taking water pills to urinate Diagnosis According to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM - IVTR) published by the American psychological association the criteria for diagnosing a patient with bulimia are:- Recurrent episodes of binge eating. - An episode of binge eating is characterized by the following:- - Eating in a. fixed period of time, an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat under similar circumstances. - A lack of control over eating during the episode. A feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviour to prevent weight gain such as:? - Self induced vomiting - Misuse of laxative - Diuretics or other medications - Fasting - Excessive exercise. Self evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight. These symptoms occur at least twice a week on average and persist for at least 3 months. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa. There are two types of Bulimia Nervosa Purging type These patients self induce vomiting (usually by triggering the gag reflex or ingesting emetics such as syrup of ipecac) to rapidly remove food from the body before it can be digested such as diuretics and enemas. Non purging types These bulimics (approx imately 6-8% of cases) exercise or fast excessively after a binge to offset the caloric intake after eating purging type bulimics may also exercise or fast but as a secondary form of weight control. The onset of bulimia nervosa is often during adolescence (b/w/3-20 years of age) with many sufferers relapsing in adulthood into episodic binging and purging even after initially successful treatment and remission. Treatment Cognitive behavioural therapy which involves teaching clients to challenge automatic thoughts and engage in behavioural experiments (e. g. in session eating of 'forbidden foods\").",
