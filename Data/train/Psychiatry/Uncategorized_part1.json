Impoant features in distinguishing the condition are given below. Differential diagnosis: Point 1: Etiologically significant trauma should be present for a diagnosis of PTSD. E. g. A traumatic event in the past. Point 2: 'Intentionality' or 'aboutness' is an impoant factor for PTSD. Nightmares, flashbacks or reliving experiences should be related to the past event. PTSD concerns memory - Intrusion of past stressors into the present. Point 3: Avoid a 'stimulus' or 'activity' that provokes the memory of the past event. In the above question, only reliving experience is mentioned as connected to the past experiences. Hence, that is the answer for this question.

        "exp": "Beck Cognitive therapy is a psychotherapy developed by American pyschiatrist Aaron T. Beck. Cognitive therapy is one of the therapeutic approaches within the larger group of cognitive behavioural therapies. Cognitive therapy seeks to help the client overcome difficulties by identifying and changing dysfunctional thinking, behaviour and emotional responses. This involves helping clients develop skills for modifying beliefs, identifying distoed thinkings, relative to others in different ways and changing behaviours. Treatment is based on collaboration between client and therapist and on testing beliefs. Therapy may consist of testing the assumptions which one makes and identifying how some of one's usually unquestioned thoughts are distoed, unrealistic and unhelpful. Once, those thoughts have been challenged, ones feelings about the subject matter of those thoughts are more easily subject to change. Beck initially focussed on depression and developed a list of errors in thought that he proposed could maintain depression, including arbitrary inference, selective abstraction, over generalization and magnification (of negatives) and minimization (of positives). According to Beck's theorey of the etiology of depression, depressed people acquire a negative view of the world in childhood and adolescence. Children and adolescent who suffer from depression acquire this negative view earlier. Depressed people acquire such view through a loss of a parent, rejection by peers, (criticism from teachers or parents, the depressive attitude and other negative events). When the person with such view encounters a situation that resembles the original conditions of the learned view in some way, even remotely, the negative views of the persons are activated. A simple example may illustrate the principle of how cognitive therapy works Having made a mistake at work, a person may believe \"I am useless and can't do anything right at work\". Strongly believing this then tends to worsen his mood. The problem may be worsened fuher if the individual reacts by avoiding activities and then behaviourally confirming the negative belief to himself. As a result, any adaptive response and fuher constructive consequences become unlikely, which reinforces the original belief of being useless. In therapy, the latter example could be identified as a self fulfilling prophecy or \"problem cycle\" and the effos of the therapist and client would be directed at working together to change it.",

Acute onset, presence of fever, no history of psychiatric illness suggests delirium. But, the diagnosis of delirium cannot be made definitively in the absence of disorientation. In the question there is no definite comment on orientation of the patient. May be, that suggests, the patient is not disoriented. Acute onset, presence of perceptual disturbances (hallucination and other symptoms point towards acute psychosis. But acute psychosis seems unlikely because:-- Absence of cognitive dysfunction or thought disorders.- Absence of H/o psychiatric illness or substance abuse disorders. Psychotic disorders cannot be diagnosed only in the presence of perceptual disturbances. Some disorder in cognitive dysfunction or thought disorders is also required. May be this is a case of acute transient psychosis- These disorders do not give the classical manifestations of psychotic disorders.- They are characterized by the predominance of perceptual disturbances, and they do not fulfil the criteria of psychotic disorders. Acute and Transient Psychotic disordersA large number of psychiatrists especially from the developing countries like India, repoed that many patients developed an acute psychotic disorder that neither followed the course of schizophrenia nor resembled mood disorders in the clinical picture and usually had a better prognosis than schizophrenia. Acute and transient psychosis as a descriptive entity was recognized only with the advent of 1. CD-10 in 1992. Where it is included under psychotic disorder.- The key features that characterize the disorder are an -- acute within (2 weeks) onset in all the cases presence of typical syndrome which are described as rapidly changing variables, polymorphic states and typical schizophrenic symptoms evidence, for associated acute stress in a substantial number of cases and complete recovery in most cases within 2-3 months. A pa from these criteria ICD-10 also provides diagnostic guide- lines which include- Not meeting the criteria for manic or depressive episodes although the affective symptoms may be prominent - Absence of organic causation although perplexity confusion and inattention may he present. - Absence of obvious intoxication by drugs or alcohol. It is evident that ICD 10 intends to \"clearly differentiate\" the concept of acute transient psychosis. from those of affective psychosis, organic psychosis and drug induced psychosis. This is the point which is creating doubt in our minds. The ICD wants to clearly differentiate it from organic psychosis.- The boy presents with \"fever\" therefore the organic cause for the psychosis cannot be ruled out. - May be the psychosis is due to fever (some C. N. S. infection)- If fever had not been mentioned the diagnosis would have been clear. But the presence of fever prevents us from diagnosing this as acute transient psychosis.- The correct option would have been \"organic psychosis\" or \"psychosis due to general medical condition\". - Acute psychosis cannot be diagnosed without addressing the organic basis of the disease. Four subtypes of acute transient psychosis are described in ICD 10 -Acute polymorphic psychotic disorder without symptoms of schizo- phrenia - Acute polymorphic psychotic disorders with symptoms (? f schizo- phrenia - Acute schizophrenia like psychotic disorder- Acute predominantly delusional psychotic disorder. Overall, duration of total episode should not exceed 3 months and that. for schizophrenic symptoms should not exceed 1 month. There is provision for change of diagnosis to schizophrenia.",

Neurofibrillary Tangles (NFTs) are intracellular accumulations of hyperphosphorylated 'tau' proteins. Neurofibrillary Tangles are Intracellular Accumulations. Neurofibrillary Tangles are intracellular accumulations of hyperphosphorylated microtubule binding protein 'tau'. Paired helical filaments of tau protein (NFTs) form intracellularly within the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons. These cytoskeletal protein tangles (NFTs), initially impede cellular metabolism and axosplasmic transpo leading to impaired synaptic function and eventually to neuronal death. These neurofibrillaty tangles may be seen as extracellular tangles after degeneration of the neuron as evidence of the neuronal cell's demise. Neurofibrillary Tangles are intracellular accumulations that may appear extracellularly alter degeneration of neuron (neuronal death). Histopathological Hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease. Amyloid Plaques (Extracellular). Amyloid Neuritic Plaques are formed by extracellular accumulation of beta amyloid deposits within the neutropil'Neuritic' or 'Senile' I3-amyloid plaques are an early histopathological sign of Alzheimer's disease (that occur rarely in healthy subjects). The amyloid 13-protein accumulated in single neuritic plaques is toxic to surrounding structures and adjacent neurons. Clinicopathological studies have shown that amy/aid burden does not directly correlate with severity or duration of dementia. Neurofibrillary Tangles (Intracellular). Neurofibrillary tangles arc formed by intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated microtubule binding protein 'tau'. NFT's occur in many neurodegenerative diseases and /or a group of diseases called laupathies'. These include Frontotemporal dementia, Pick's disease etc. The cooccurance of fi-amyloid plaques with NFT's suggests a diagnosis of AD. The NFT's are toxic to the neurons and neurons with NFT's eventually die and degenerate leaving a residual `ghost tangle', in the extracellular space reminding of the pyramidal cell body in which it was initially formed. Clinicopathological studies have shown that dementia correlates more strongly with NFT's than with senile plaques (3-amyloid)",

The etiology appears to be a combination of both biological and psychological dysfunction. The sensations and physiologic changes can be very dramatic and, in addition to the features cited in the question stem, can include dizziness, fear of going crazy, feelings of unreality, chills, abdominal distress, palpitations, shoness of breath, and trembling or shaking. Many patients who experience a panic attack are concerned that they may have a dangerous hea, lung, or brain disorder. Although the diagnosis is fairly straightforward in a younger individual with no known serious disease, the diagnostic dilemma is more difficult in an older patient, who may potentially have a true disease of these organ systems. Whereas isolated panic attacks are common, less than 1% of the population has \"panic disorder, \" characterized by frequent panic attacks, severe anticipation anxiety about recurrent attacks, and avoidance of places in which attacks had previously been experienced. Individuals with isolated panic attacks usually need no more therapy than reassurance; those with panic disorder may be helped with antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and behavior therapy. Angina and myocardial infarction would not be expected in a 25-year-old woman, and the ischemic changes would be apparent on the ECG.

Mn-SSRI for \"DOPES\" is 1st choice. SSRIs are also used in generalized anxiety disorder, treatment of premature ejaculation (paroxetiene is most useful), body dysmorphic disorders, compulsive buying, & kleptomania. Psychotherapy (group, suppoive) remains the treatment of choice for adjustment disordersQ. And medications are used only to treat specific symptoms for brief periods. Patients with severe anxiety bordering on panic can benefit from anxiolytics (diazepam); those in withdrawn or inhibited states may benefit from sho course of psychostimulant drugs; those with signs of decompensation or impending psychosis may be helped by antipsychotic drugs; whereas, SSRIs are useful in treating symptoms of traumatic grief. There is recent trend of increased antidepressant use, however, to augment psychotherupy in adjustment disorder rather than serving as the primary modality. All SSRIs (except fluvoxamine) are US-FDA approved for treatment of major depression. Fluvoxemine is only used for treatment of OCD in US (b/o commercial reasons not d/t therapeutic profile as it is used for major depression in other countries). In US, citalopram is used only in major depression; escitalopram in major depression & GAD; paroxetine is only not used in bulimia nervosa; and setraline is not used in bulimia & GAD. Fluoxetine is not used in GAD, PTSD and social anxiety but is approved for treatment of bipolar depression (with olanzapine).",

Above is an example of delusion of infidelity (morbid jealousy, Othello syndrome) i. e. False belief that one's lover has been unfaithful. Persecutory delusions (paranoid): The patient feels that he is being persecuted against. There is a false belief that one is being harmed, threatened, cheated, poisoned, harassed or spied on or is a victim of a conspiracy to damage his reputation. The supposed persecutor of the patient may be people in the environment (e. g., members of the family, neighbours, former friend) or may be political or religious groups. These delusions occur in schizophrenia (especially paranoid), severe affective disorders (severe mania or severe depression) and organic brain syndrome. This is the most common type of delusion. The delusion of persecution may occur in the context of primary delusional experiences, auditory hallucinations, bodily hallucinations or experiences of passivity Grandiose delusion (expansive delusions): False belief that one is exceptionally powerful, talented or important. These delusions are seen most commonly in mania, However, can also occur in schizophrenia and organic states. Delusions of reference: False belief that certain objects, people or events have intense personal significance and refer specifically to oneself, e. g., Believing that a television newsreader is talking directly about oneself, or people walking on the road are talking about him. These delusions are seen in schizophrenia, mania and organic states. Religious delusions: False belief pertaining to a religious theme, often grandiose in nature, e. g.: believing that one is a special messenger from God. These delusions are seen in schizophrenia. Delusions of love (erotomania): False belief that another person is in love with one (commoner in a woman). In one form, termed de clerambault syndrome, a woman (usually) believes that a man, frequently older and of higher status, is in love with her. The delusion of infidelity (morbid jealousy, Othello syndrome): False belief that one's lover has been unfaithful. These are seen in schizophrenia, alcohol-related psychosis, organic states. The delusion of misidentification: Capgras syndrome (Delusion of double): Belief that a familiar person has been replaced by an exact double i. e. an impostor. Fregoli syndrome: Belief that a complete stranger is actually a familiar person already known to one. The delusion of self - accusation or guilt: False feeling of remorse of guilt. It occurs in Depression. Nihilistic delusions: False belief that oneself, others or the world is non - existent or about to end. There are pessimistic ideas that the patient's career is finished, he is about to die, the world is doomed. These occur in severe depression: If nihilistic delusions are accompanied by ideas concerning bodily function failure, e. g., putrefaction of intestines, etc. the syndrome is called COTARD's SYNDROME. Hypochondriacal delusions: False belief about one's health, patient wrongly believes that he has a severe medical illness, contrary to the all medical evidence. It is seen in depression. The delusion of infestations: False belief that one is infested with small but visible organisms. As a monosymptomatic delusional disorder, this is called EKBOM SYNDROME. It is seen in the acute confusional state (due to drugs or alcohol withdrawal), in schizophrenia, in dementing illness, and as a delusional elaboration of tactile hallucinatory experiences (secondary to fornication). Delusion of control: Belief that his actions, impulses or thoughts are controlled by an outside agency and accordingly called as made action, made impulse or made an effect. Also called somatic passivity experiences (passivity phenomenon). Commonly seen in schizophrenia. Delusions concerning possession of thoughts: Patients with delusions about possession of thoughts may lose the conviction that their thoughts are their own. Most commonly seen in schizophrenia.",

In somatoform pain disorder the major symptom will be unexplained chronic pain, which is usually isolated. Patients have a long history of complaints of severe pain out of propoion to any biomedical findings that are present. Exacerbations and remission of complaints correlate with psychogenic factors. The term somatization refers to the experience and repoing of physical symptoms that cause distress but lack a corresponding level of tissue damage or pathology and are linked to psychosocial stress. In contrast to this broad and inclusive view of the process, psychiatrists have developed strict diagnostic criteria that define several distinct disorders, which are collectively referred to as the somatoform disorders. As such, clinicians should be careful to distinguish between somatization, as defined above, and somatization disorder, which is one type of somatoform disorder. In general, these conditions are chronic and reflect an enduring way for the affected individuals to cope with psychosocial stressors. Ref: Shim J., Eisendrath S. J. (2008). Chapter 25. Somatization.

Poor concentration, inattention, altered sensorium and disturbances of memory are seen. There is impairment of immediate and recent memory, remote memory is normal. Perceptual anomalies: - Delirium is the most common cause of illusion. Hallucination, paicularly visual are common. Emotional disturbances: - Most commonly it is fear, followed by anxiety. Less commonly euphoria, apathy or depression may occur. Mood constantly fluctuates, i. e., labile mood. Language disturbances: - Mutism as well as rambling and incoherent speech. Psychomotor disturbances: - Hypo or hyperactivity, agitation. Disorder of sleep: - Sleep wake rhythm is usually altered. Sleep is fragmented and disturbed by nightmares. Diurnal variation with sedation in the day time and restlessness at night (Sun downing) is common. Autonomic disturbances: - Tachycardia, sweating, tremers. Neurological signs: - Tremor, seizure, choreiform movements. Electroencephalography (EEG): - The most typical finding is diffuse (generalized) slowing.

Up to 70 to 90% of brain norepinephrine is produced in the pontine nucleus, locus ceruleus. Dopamine is implicated in schizophrenia and also in an impoant neurotransmitter for the extra-pyramidal system. Depletion of this substance, as in parkinsonism, causes muscular rigidity and tremors. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter associated with higher coical functioning and is depleted in Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholine also is an impoant neurotransmitter for the autonomic nervous system (parasympathetic system and the sympathetic nerves to the sweat glands). Many antidepressants have an anticholinergic action, thus dryness of the mouth, constipation, and blurred vision. GABA is an impoant inhibitory transmitter that opens the chloride channels directly associated with the GABA receptors, hyperpolarizing the cell. Ref: Meltzer H. Y., Bobo W. V., Heckers S.

Mood: Mood is characteriztically low and sad. There is loss of interest and pleasure in almost all activities, which result in social withdrawal, avolition, occupational dysfunction. In severe cases there may be anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure). Thoughts (Thinking): - Pesimistic thoughts conerning the patients past, present and future occur which results in Hopelessness, Helplessness, and wohlessness. Other thought problems may be guilt-feeling, Loss of self esteem, Suicidal ideas, Delusion of nihlism (World has come to an end, Intestines has been rotated away, No brain in head), Hypochondriacal delusions. Other delusions that may occur in elderly include paranoid or persecutory delusion, and delusional jealousy. Psychomotor activity: - There is psychomotor retardation --> Movements are sluggish & laboured, lack of initiative & energy, Easy fatiguability. In severe form, the patient becomes stuporous (depressive stupor). In older patient there may be agitation and restlessness. Cognition: - There is poor concentration, which may lead the patient to think (mistakenly) that the memory is also impaired (However, memory is normal). In old patients depression may present similar to dementia, i. e., Pseudodementia. Somatic symptoms & biological disturbances: - Multiple physical symptoms are common in elderly patient. Symptoms include heaviness of head, generalized ache & pain, Loss of sexual drive and amenorrhea, severe disturbance in biological function is called somatic syndrome (melancholia). Somatic syndrome (melanocholia) is characterized by:- Decrease in appetite or weight Early morning awakening, at least 2 hours before usual time. Diurnal variation, depession is worse in morning Loss of interest and loss of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, and loss of pleasure in all activities. Psychomotor agitation or retardation. Excessive or inappropriate guilt. 6. Psychotic symptoms (Psychotic depression): - Occur in 15-20% of patients. Symptoms include 2\"a person auditory hallucinations, delusions, grossly inappropriate behavior. These symptoms may be mood congruent (e. g., nihilistic delusions, delusions of povey or guilt) which are understandable in the light of depressed mood or can be mood incongruent (e. g., delusion of control) which are not directly related to depressive mood. Psychotic depression usually occur later in life and is associated with severe depression.",

In classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus (which usually does not produce the response), when paired with unconditioned stimulus (stimulus which usually produces a response), directly produces a response. The typical example of classical conditioning is pavlov's experiment. Normally food produces salivation in dog, Therefore salivation in response to food is called unconditioned response and the stimulus, i. e., food is called unconditioned stimulus. Under normal circumstances, a dog does not salivate at the sound of a bell. However, if the sound of bell is paired consistently with presentation of food, the dog begans to salivate to the sound of bell even if the food is not presented. This learned response, i. e., salivation to a sound of bell without food, is called conditioned response and the stimulus (sound of a bell) is called conditioned stimulus. There is a reverse side to classical conditioning, called counter conditioning. This amounts to reducing the intensity of conditioned response (e. g., anxiety) by establishing an incompatible response (e. g., relaxation) to a conditioned stimulus (i. e., snake). So anxiety symptoms can be reduced when the stimuli to anxiety are presented in graded order and systemically paired with a relaxation response. This process of reciprocal inhibition is called systemic desensitization. Other behavioral therapies based on classical conditioning principle (counter conditioning) are exposure with response prevention and aversion therapy.",

However, isolated neurological defects like aphasia are not themselves classified as dementias. Likewise, sensory defects or hemiplegia of body pas would not be included. Nonetheless many of these neurological abnormalities may precede or follow the onset of intellectual dysfunction, thereby taxing the diagnostic acumen of the clinician. Dementia does not necessarily mean a gradual loss of these functions, for it may be of sudden onset (eg, following a stroke). It is a syndrome resulting from a variety of diseases affecting the brain and, in many cases, is remediable with proper diagnosis and treatment. Irrespective of the cause of the disorder, the symptoms are a function of the locus and not the type of disease. Therefore, atrophy affecting the frontal lobes or a tumor involving the same areas may present in a similar fashion. Additionally, there are typical and often prominent behavioral changes that may become evident much earlier in the evolution of the disorder than do problems with orientation, cognition, or memory.

It is most often associated with bipolar disorder, where episodes of mania may cyclically alternate with episodes of major depression. Manic symptoms include irritability, anger or rage, delusions, hypersensitivity, hypersexuality, hyper-religiosity, hyperactivity, impulsiveness, racing thoughts, talkativeness, pressure to keep talking or rapid speech, and grandiose ideas and plans, decreased need for sleep (e. g. feels rested after 3 or 4 hours of sleep). A mnemonic used to remember the symptoms of mania is DIGFAST: D = DistractibilityI = IndiscretionG = GrandiosityF = Flight of ideasA = Activity increasedS = Sleep (decreased need for)T = Talkativeness (pressured speech). Dysphoric mania is primarily manic and agitated depression is primarily depressed. Acute mania in bipolar disorder is typically treated with mood stabilizers and/or antipsychotic medication. Treatments need to be prescribed and monitored carefully to avoid harmful side-effects such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome with the antipsychotic medications. Antipsychotics and mood stabilizers help stabilize mood of those with mania or depression. They work by blocking the receptor for the neurotransmitter dopamine and allowing serotonin to still work, but in diminished capacity. Lithium is the classic mood stabilizer to prevent fuher manic and depressive episodes. More recent drug solutions include lamotrigine.",

Preconscious: - This is the region of mind between the unconscious and the conscious, with access to both. The unconscious mental contents can reach the conscious only through the preconscious.

They have belief about unusual conditions such as contamination with toxic substances, infestations of insects, foul body odors, malfunctions of specific body pas such as the liver or intestines. Types of delusional disorders are: Erotomanic type: Patients have delusions that another person, usually of higher status is in love with the individual. Grandiose type: Patients have delusions of inflated woh, power, knowledge, identity, or special relationship to a deity or famous person. Jealous type: Patients have delusions that the individual's sexual paner is unfaithful.

        "exp": "Autism Prevasive developmental disorder includes the following condition:- Autism - Rett's disorder - Asperger's disorder - Childhood disintegrative disorder - Pervasive disorders not otherwise specified Pervasive development disorders are characterized by three symptom clusters? i) Impairment in social reciprocity marked by poor eye contact, lack of interest in other people and failure to interact appropriately with others. ii) Communicative impairment, it is characterized by either no language at all or by dent speech with errors in tone, prosody, pitch, grammar, or pragmatics. iii) Restricted and repetitive behaviours include using the same words and phrases repeatedly out of context, performing the same action in routine ways or insisting that others do so, or exhibiting other vocal or visual self stimulatory behaviours. Stereotype movements are seen. Stereotype movements are apparently purposeless movements such as hand flapping, head rolling or body rocking.) Now, the salient feature of each pervasive disorder: Autistic disorder It gives all the classical features of pervasive developmental disorder. The patient presents with problems in social interaction, communication and repetitive sterotype behaviour. In most of these patients there is subnormal intelligence. Example A 3 year old boy shows no interest in or connection to his parents, other adults or children. He does not speak voluntarily and is fascinated with watching rotating objects. He screams fiercely when his environment is altered in any way such as when his mother tries to dress him. Rett's disorder It is seen exclusively in females. The characteristic feature of these patients is that they begin to lose their acquired skills. Example After 4 months of normal development, an infant begins to lose her acquired skills. By 18 months of age, she shows little social interaction with her parents, other adults or children and she uses strange hand gestures. Asperger's disorder The impoant point in differential diagnosis of these patients is that they have normal intelligence. These are the only pervasive development disorders in which the intelligence is unimpaired. These patients often have some exceptional ability. They have little or no developmental language delay and relatively normal cognitive development. In the question the lack of social interaction and communication along with stereotypic behaviour (watching her own hard) suggests Autistic disorder. The patient does not give any symptoms of attention deficit disorder i. e. there are no symptoms indicating lack of concentration and hyperactivity. The patients of ADHD can also present with symptoms similar to pervasive developmental disorder but the main complaint will always be that of attention deficit and hyperactivity. Patients with depression should give other features of depression. 200. Ans is (I)) i. e. Serotonin Suicide is caused by diminished serotonin level Serotonin is a hormone that acts as neurotransmitter. Serotonin levels in our body affects a wide range of mental and physical responses and plays a significant role in activities such as temperature regulation, longer sensations,, sexual behaviour and sleep patterns. Serotonin receptors also help to regulate emotions, cognition, pain and sensory motor function. Serotonin deficiencies can give rise to wide range of illnesses depending on the pa of the brain that is affected. Other neurotransmitters may send the message that we are full but serotonin level determines if we are satisfied. Low serotonin levels in the brain are linked to clinical depression, suicidal tendencies, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive behaviours (such as builimia), schizophrenia sleep problems, migraine, headaches, autism, drug and alcohol addiction, Alzhiemer's diseases and patterns of violent behaviour. \"Diminished central serotonin plays a role in suicidal behaviour. A group at the karolinska institute was the first to note that low concentrations of the serotonin metabolite 5 Hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5. HIAA) in the lumbar cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) were associated with suicidal behaviour. \" This finding has been replicated many times and in different diagnostic groups. Postmoem neurochemical studies have repoed modest decrease in serotonin itself or 5. HIAA, in either the brain stem or frontal coex of suicide victims. Post moem receptor studies have repoed significant changes in presynaptic and postsynaptic serotonin binding sites in suicide victims.",

This technique involves increasing or decreasing a paicular behavior by associating the behavior with a positive or negative conditions (rewards or punishments).

Negative reinforcement increases the probability of a behavior by associating the behavior with the removal of a negative condition. Punishment decreases the probability of a behavior by associating the behavior with a negative condition. So punishment leads to a decrease in resultant behavior and not an increase.

Personality Traits: Temprament & Character. Personality is the dynamic (constantly changing) psychobiological organization within the individual that modulate their unique adaptations to a changing internal and external environment and characterize their differences in outlook, thoughts, emotions and actions. Inflexibility in personality is an indicator of personality disorder. A person may feel and act differently on different situations (such as on a date, at work or school, in church, or with trusted friend), although his personality doesn't change. So the way a person adapts to 5 different types of situations distinguish layers of personality. Sexual situations involving reproduction & sexuality. Material situations involving quest for material possessions & power Emotional situations involving emotions and social attachment Intellectual situations involving communication & culture. Spiritual situations involving quest for what is beyond individual human existence. Temperament and character together constitute personality. Temprearment is the innate predisposition to behave in a paicular manner. Temperamental traits are biases in emotional response that are fully developed early in life and relatively stable there after whereas, character is a configuration of habbits, a disposition, consisting in the actualized aspects acquired through learning and shaped by experience. It involves higher cognitive processes that develop in a stepwise manner over the life time to enable a person to regulate his emotions, maintain paicular values and viues and achieve ceain goals.

Whereas, Psychodynamic psychotherapy is based on unconscious intrapsychic intersystem conflictsQ Psychotherapy Cognitive Therapy - It comprises techniques designed to help the patient recognize, challenge, and modify irrational or dysfunctional beliefs, ideas, perceptions, and self statements, that are assumed to cause pathological emotional reactionsQ, to negative or stressful events. Modifying such beliefs is k/a cognitive restructuring. Dysfunctional information processing include automatic thoughts and schemas. schemas. 1. Automatic thoughts are cognitions that stream rapidly through an individual's mind, whether spontaneously or triggered by affective arousal (i. e. anxiety, anger or sadness). Their automatic nature refers to their speed of entery into awareness & their implicit believability leading to emotional validity (emotional reasoning). Beck coined term cognitive triad to describe the content of automatic negative thoughts grouped by themes peaining to self world (i. e. significant others or people in general) and future. Cognitive errors or distoions are stereotypic errors in logic which shape the content of automatic thoughts. Schemas represent the sum of one's attitude & beliefs. They are unspoken rules or basic assumptions that act as templates for screening and decoding informations from the environment. - Cognitive therapy is a sho term (25 weeks), structured therapy that uses active collaboration b/w patient & therapist, to achieve its therapeutic goals, which are oriented towards current problems & their resolution. It includes 4 processes: eliciting automatic thoughts, testing automatic thoughts, identifying maladaptive assumptions and testing the validity of maladaptive assumptions. - Alternations in the content of underlying cognitive structures affect their affective (emotional) state & behavioral pattern. - It is effective in mood (depression) and anxiety disorders (such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and both social & specific phobias) > substance abuse, schizophrenia, personality disorders and eating disorders. Behavior Therapy - It is based on principles of operant & classic conditioning, and modeling to help patients to change maladaptive patterns of behaving. - It is effective in OCD, anxiety disorders including GAD, panic disorder, and both social and specific phobias. It is also effective in treatment of pain disorders, sleep problems, behavior problems (a/w schizophrenia), substance abuse disorder, and children's disorder such as attention- deficit/hyper activity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder, school phobia, separation anxiety disorder, eneuresis and self injury (in mentally retarded children) Interpersonal therapy (IPT) IPT focuses on specific inter personal deficits or problems, such as continual relational conflicts or difficulty transitioning into a new life role (eg divorce, job loss, retirement). substance abuse, schizophrenia, personality disorders and eating disorders. \" v: shapes=\"_x0000_s1026\">- It focuses on 4 categories of problems; inter personal deficits, role disputes, role transitions & grief. - It was originally developed to treat depression. It has also been used in eating disorders, paicularly bulimia nervosa & binge- eating disorder. Psychodynamic Psychotherapy - They are derived from Sigmund Freud'sQ psychoanalytic techniques and are intended to promote self understanding and insight into recurring problems with others. - In therapy, the inter personal problems which are the result of defence mechanisms and intrapsychic conflicts are identified, interpreted, and managed. - The primary mode of therapeutic action of psychoanalytic psychotherapy is insight which may be defined as the conscious recognition of the role of unconscious factors (such as feelings, experiences & fantasies) on current experience and behavior. - Unconscious neurotic conflicts are recovered from memory & verbellay expressed, re experienced in the transference, reconstructed by analyst, & ultimately, resolved through understanding. Freud referred to these processes as recollection, repetition, and working through, which make up the totality of remembering, reliving, and gaining insight. Interpersonal Therapy (ITP) - It is a time limited treatment (12-20 sessions over 4-5 month period) which assumes that the development & maintenance of some psychiatric illnesses occur in interpersonal & social context, and that the onset, response to treatment and out comes are influenced by the inter personal relations between the patient & significant others. Psychodrama, Sociodrama, Sociometry & Sociatry - Jacob Levy Moreno hypothesized a model of health focusing on capacity for creativity, not pathology. It assumes that human beings learn primarily through interaction with social networks, which he called social atoms. Social atoms can depict all or any combinations of relationships: past, present, absent, alive or needed, positive, negative, neutral, ambivalent, mutul, nonmutual what needs to be changed / clarified/ staed / ended / substracted and added with whom the client is emotionally related. - The nucleus of social atom reflects oneself & first ring are those whose impact is most significant, and so on - It is based on theories and methods of the social atom, canon of creativity, therapeutic stage, psychodramatic mirror, surplus reality, auxiliary ego, role reversal, role playing, the empty chair, role theory, the double, encounter & development theory. - Therapeutic dramatization of emotional problems includes the protagonist, auxiliary ego, director and group. A client (patient or protagonist), works with a psychodramatist (director, leader or therapist) who uses a sequence of methods to guide a protagonist (in psychodrama) or group (in sociodrama) in their experiential exploration of any aspect of the past, present or future towards the acquisition of insight. An auxiliary ego is another group member, who may be asked by the protagonist or director to represent a person or aspect (someone or something) in protagonist's experience.

Cognition or higher mental functions are evaluated by testing memory, mathematics, reading, writing, visuospatial skills, constructional ability, fine sensory function (stereognosis, graphesthesia, two point discrimination), finger - gnosis, right - left orientation, executive functions and abstraction. - in Neuropsychiatric mental status examination.

With excessive or prolonged use, the drug can cause itching, tachcardia, hallucinations and paranoid delusions. Overdoses cause tachyarrythmias and a marked elevation of blood pressure, which can be life-threatening. Toxicity results in seizures, followed by respiratory and circulatory depression of medullar origin. This may lead to death from respiratory failure, stroke, or hea-failure. Cocaine is also highly pyrogenic, because the stimulation and increased muscular activity cause greater heat production. Heat loss is inhibited by the intense vasoconstriction. Cocaine-induced hypehermia may cause muscle cell destruction and myoglobinuria resulting in renal failure. Emergency treatment often consists of administering a benzodiazepine sedation agent, such as diazepam to decrease the elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Physical cooling (ice, cold blankets, etc.) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used to treat hypehermia. There is no officially approved specific antodote for cocaine overdose. Cocaine's primary acute effect on brain chemistry is to raise the amount of dopamine and serotonin in the nucleus accumbens (the pleasure center in the brain); this effect ceases, due to metabolism of cocaine to inactive compounds and paicularly due to the depletion of the transmitter resources (tachyplaxis). This can be experienced acutely as feelings of depression, as a \"crash\" after the initial high.",

The fear is irrational: The objects or situations do not produce fear in normal persons. The fear is out of propoion to the dangerousness perceived that the affected person avoids the situation permanently. Patient is unable to control the fear and is very distressed by it. The common types of phobia are:? 1. Agoraphobia This is an example of irrational fear of situations. It is the commonest type of phobia encountered in clinical practice. It is characterized by an irrational fear of being in places away from familiar setting of home and patient believes that he cannot escape from these places, to a safer place (usually home). This fear results in avoidance of these places which include public places, stores, crowd, travelling alone in bus, train or plane, Theaters, Tunnels, Bridge, standing in line small enclosed rooms or lifts. The patient is afraid of all the places or situations from where escape may be perceived to be difficult if he suddenly develops embrassing or incapaciating symptoms. These embrassing or incapaciating symptoms are the classical symptoms of panic. A full-blown panic attack may occur (agoraphobia with panic disorder) or only a few symptoms (like dizziness or tachycardia) may occur (agoraphobia without panic disorder). 2. Social phobia In social phobia there is irrational fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is concerned about negative evaluation or scrutiny by others, for example: Public speaking; writing/drinking/eating in public; using public lavatories. Feared social or performance situations may produce anxiety symptoms, even a panic attack. Therefore, feared social or performance situations are avoided. 3. Specific (simple) phobia These are phobias limited to highly specific situations or objects, for example. Claustrophobia:-Fear of closed spaces Acro/Aerophobia:-Fear of high places Zoophobia:- Fear of animals Pyrophobia:- Fear of fire Xenophobia:- Fear of strangers Algophobia:- Fears of pain Thanatophobia:- Fear of death Mysophobia:- Fear of di & germs Erythrophobia:- Fear of blushing Sitophobia:- Fear of eating Ailurophobia:- Fear of cats Sitaphobia:- Fear of dogs Hydrophobia:- Fear of water",
