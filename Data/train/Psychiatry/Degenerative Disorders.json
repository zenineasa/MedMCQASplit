        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Acetylcholine Neurotransmitters in Alzheimer's diseaseo Acetylcholine has a major role in memory functions and deficiency in cholinergic functioning is associated with memory disturbances particularly short term memory. In Alzheimer's disease there loss of cells in the nucleus basalis of meyernet results in marked reduction in choline acetyltransferase (CHAT), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of acetylcholine - Decreased Acetylcholine. o The other important neurotransmitter involved is norepinephrine - There is decrease in nor-epinephrine containing neurons in the locus ceruleus. o Two other neuroactive peptides have been implicated in AD - Somatostatin and corticotropin, both of which have decreased concentration.",
