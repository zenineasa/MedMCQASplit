He has also become withdrawn and has decreased meeting people. The patient also behaved inappropriately with a female neighbour couple of says back, which is much against his usual nature. The patient denies having any problems and seems indifferent to his wife's concern.

In addition, pupillary irregularities, retinal haemorrhages and papilloedema can occur, causing an impairment of vision. ii. Higher mental function disturbance: Disorientation, confusion, recent memory disturbances, poor attention span and distractibility are quite common. Other early symptoms are apathy and ataxia. Peripheral neuropathy and serious malnutrition are often co-existent. Neuropathologically, neuronal degeneration and haemorrhage are seen in the thalamus, hypothalamus, mammillary bodies and midbrain.
