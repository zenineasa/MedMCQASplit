        "exp": "ANSWER: (B) Dyslexia. REF: Kaplan and sadock 10th ed p. 1162. Reading Disorder: Reading disorder is characterized by an impaired ability to recognize words, slow and inaccurate reading, and poor comprehension. The term developmental alexia was accepted and defined as a developmental deficit in the recognition of printed symbols. This term was simplified by adopting the term dyslexia in the 1960s. Dyslexia was used extensively for many years to describe a reading disability syndrome that often included speech and language deficits and right-left confusion. Reading disorder is frequently accompanied by disabilities in other academic skills, and the term dyslexia has been replaced by broader terms, such as learning disorder. Differential diagnosis: A recent study indicates that children with reading disorder consistently present difficulties with linguistic abilities, whereas children with ADHD do not. Reading disorder must be differentiated from mental retardation syndromes in which reading, along with other skills, is below the achievement expected for a child's chronological age. Intellectual testing helps to differentiate global deficits from more specific reading difficulties.",
