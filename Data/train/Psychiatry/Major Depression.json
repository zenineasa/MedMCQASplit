Significant weight loss w hen not dieting or weight gain (e. g. a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month) or decrease or increase in appetite. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly everyday. Psychomotor agitation or retardation. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly everyday. Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional). Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation. The symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in soeial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
