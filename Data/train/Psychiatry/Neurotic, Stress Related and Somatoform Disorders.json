Adjustment disorder is always seen after a stressful event, which is usually a negative life event. The symptoms of adjustment disorder are quite similar to depression and include depressed mood, anxiety, worry, a feeling of inability to cope and some degree of disturbance in individuals daily functioning. Now, a negative life event can also precipitate the depressive episode. So, the presence of a stressor cannot be used to differentiate between adjustment disorder and depression. If a patient has the symptoms severe enough to qualify the diagnosis of depression, depression would always be diagnosed ahead of adjustment disorder, irrespective of whether there was a stressor or not. In this case patient has the symptoms such as loss of interest, ideas of hopelessness (patient is convinced that she won't be able to work again) and most impoantly suicide attempt, all of which are highly suggestive of depression. Hence, the diagnosis would be depressive disorder.",
