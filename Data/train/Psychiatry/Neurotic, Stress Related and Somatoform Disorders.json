The question has not mentioned if it was an auditory perception (i. e. he heard voice of wife) or visual perception (i. e. he saw his wife), what was the state of consciousness (whether he was awake or sleeping). In view of above its difficult to even call this phenomenon as a hallucination. Even if we accept it as a hallucination, it appears to be a single episode. There is no history of any other associated symptoms.

Now, a negative life event can also precipitate the depressive episode. So, the presence of a stressor cannot be used to differentiate between adjustment disorder and depression. If a patient has the symptoms severe enough to qualify the diagnosis of depression, depression would always be diagnosed ahead of adjustment disorder, irrespective of whether there was a stressor or not. In this case patient has the symptoms such as loss of interest, ideas of hopelessness (patient is convinced that she won't be able to work again) and most impoantly suicide attempt, all of which are highly suggestive of depression.
