This is called \"hinging\". - The person may feel gaining weight after a binge. Binging also can cause fear of shame and guilt. So the person tries to undo the binge by getting rid of the. food. This is called purging. Purging might be done by:? - Making yourself throw up - Taking laxative - pills or liquids that speed up the movement of food - Exercising a lot - Eating very little or not at all - Taking water pills to urinate Diagnosis According to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM - IVTR) published by the American psychological association the criteria for diagnosing a patient with bulimia are:- Recurrent episodes of binge eating. - An episode of binge eating is characterized by the following:- - Eating in a. fixed period of time, an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat under similar circumstances. - A lack of control over eating during the episode. A feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviour to prevent weight gain such as:? - Self induced vomiting - Misuse of laxative - Diuretics or other medications - Fasting - Excessive exercise. Self evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight. These symptoms occur at least twice a week on average and persist for at least 3 months. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa. There are two types of Bulimia Nervosa Purging type These patients self induce vomiting (usually by triggering the gag reflex or ingesting emetics such as syrup of ipecac) to rapidly remove food from the body before it can be digested such as diuretics and enemas. Non purging types These bulimics (approx imately 6-8% of cases) exercise or fast excessively after a binge to offset the caloric intake after eating purging type bulimics may also exercise or fast but as a secondary form of weight control. The onset of bulimia nervosa is often during adolescence (b/w/3-20 years of age) with many sufferers relapsing in adulthood into episodic binging and purging even after initially successful treatment and remission. Treatment Cognitive behavioural therapy which involves teaching clients to challenge automatic thoughts and engage in behavioural experiments (e. g. in session eating of 'forbidden foods\").",

Impoant clinical features are:? Memory:- The Korsakoff syndrome is characterized by both anterograde (i. e., learning) and retrograde (i. e., a memory of past events) amnesia. Anterograde amnesia is severe with a lack of insight. Retrograde amnesia is not as severe. New learning and recent memory are impaired but remote memory is relatively preserved. Although remote memory is relatively preserved, the patient is unable to organize them in a temporal context and disto the relationship between facts and fill the remote memory gaps by confabulation. There is a profound deficit of explicit (conscious or declarative) type of long term memory, with little impairment of implicit (unconscious or non-declarative) type of long term memory. Personality:- Passive and malleable such that they display a lack of initiatives, interest, or concern and diminished spontaneity.

Somatoform disorders The somatoform disorders are heterogenous group that have common presenting feature suggestive of physical illness, symptoms or preoccupation. As a feature of this group the symptoms are unexplained by general medical condition or are dispropoionate to symptoms that might be expected from a general medical condition. - To establish one of the these diagnosis the clinician must rule out accult physical disorders that might better explain the symptoms. Types of somatoform disoreders Category Key characteristics * Multiple symptoms - pain, gastrointestinal, sexual dysfunction Somatization * Symptoms vary over time disorder * Chronic condition-often with extensive treatment history * Not intentional * Symptoms affect voluntary motor or sensory system * Symptoms do not conform to neuroanatomic structures Conversion disorder * May reflect, symbolically, past or current stressor * Patient may not be upset by the symptoms * Not intentional * Chronic preoccupation with having a serious disease Hypochondriasis * Patient misattributes symptom or test results. * Preoccupation not solely due to affective status Body dysmorphic * Preoccupation with an imagined defect in physical appearance Disorder * May exaggerate mild anomay Chronic pain * Pain is the central anomaly Syndrome * May begin after specific injury * Can lead to serious functional impairment and medication overuse Somatization disorder Previously somatiation disorder was referred to as hysteria or Briquet's syndrome. It is a chronic fluctuating condition that usually begins after the age of 30 and extends over many years. The patient presents with multiple symptoms, including pain, gastrointestinal symtpmatology, neurologic symptoms and sexual dysfunction, which may vary considerably over time. He or she may have a long history of past extensive treatment including surgery. Typically, the patient seeks out multiple providers because of dissatisfaction with prior treatment, and may end up on complex combinations of medications because of frustration on the pa of both patient and physician Significant impairment in work and social. functioning are common Criteria for somatization disorder As described in the Diagnostic and statistical Manual-IV -Patients should have a history of pain in at least four different sites. - Two different gastrointestinal symptoms other than pain. - At least one sexual symptom, and one neurologic symptom. Conversion disorder Conversion disorder presents with deficits of the voluntary motor or sensory neurologic system and often mimic recognized neurologic or other medical conditions. As with somatization disorder the symptoms are not intentionally produced; often, the underlying psychological factors are expressed in physical symptoms. Common presentations include loss of sensation in a single limb or pa of a limb, double vision blindness, deafness, difficulty with swallowing and paralysis. On careful exam, the symptoms typically do not conform to recognized anatomic pathways. Pain disorders Pain disorders are characterized by a specific, predominant focus on pain as the presenting symptom. The pain usually does not. follow established anatomic patterns. However, if may be impossible to differentiate from established medical conditions such as lumbar disc disease. Although work-ups typically are negative, prior invasive treatment may lead to physical. findings that completely muddy the diagnosis. Indeed, pain disorders may develop after prior injury or treatment, which provides some pathophysiologic explanation. for the symptoms. Pain disorders may occur throughout the lifespan and are more common in women than man. The course may be persistent and lead to severe. functional impairment and extensive use of pain medication.",

These are two most commonly used treatments for children.- Drug of 1,, choice methylphenidate is a sho acting medication generally used to be effective during school hours. It's most common side effects are headaches, stomachaches, nausea and insomnia. In some rebound effect (brief period of hyper activity), exacerbation of tic disorder and growth suppression can occur, but children tend to make up the growth when are given drug holidays in the summer or on weekends.- d- enantiomer - dexmethylphenydate (Focalin) is recently introduced to maximize target effects & minimize adverse effects in individuals who obtain paial response from methyl - phenydate. Dextroamphetamine & dextroamphetamine + amphetamine salt combinations are usually the second drugs of choice when methylphenydate is not effective.- Modafinil (provigil), a CNS stimulant, originally developed to reduce day time sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy, has also been tried. Non stimulant medication. Atomoxetine is a presynaptic norepinephrine uptake inhibitor approved by FDA in treatment of ADHD for children age 6 years and above. It is effective for inattention & impulsivity in children and adults. It improves mood and anxiety. Modafinil (provigil) is a ble treatment of ADHD in adolescents. Although stimulants remain the drug of choiceQ, a body of evidence now suppos the use of non stimulants, including atomoxetine and modafinil (Kaplan 1213). Bupropion has been used as both an antidepressant & in the treatment of ADHD- Venlafaxine used especially for children & adolescents with combinations of ADHD and depression or anxiety features.- a adrenergic agonists eg clonidine & guanfacine. Clonidine may be helpful when patients also have tic disorders. Other classes of medications, tricyclic drugs and premoline previously used to treat ADHD are no longer recommended because of potential adverse effects on liver function (premoline), potential cardiac arrhythmia effects (TCA) and sudden death (with desipramine). Very rarely antipsychotics are used to treat refractory hyperactivity in children & adolescents who are severely impaired and do not respond to other treatments. Quetiapine (like risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine, & Ziprasidone) is a serotonin domamine - antagonist (SDA; which is also known as second generation - atypical antipsychotic drugs). All SDAs have a higher ratio of serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) to D2 dopamine receptor blockades and a low D2 receptor blocking effect when compared with typical, conventional dopamine receptor antagonists (DRA). So there is a reduced risk of extrapyramidal side effects. These drugs have proved efficacy as treatments for Schizophrenia & acute maniaQ. Quetiapine is also used in bipolar depression, insomnia, on aggression in children with autism, childhood or adolescent antisocial behaviour (with episodes of explosive behaviour, aggression and violent out bursts), conduct disorders, and for schizophrenia and mania in children & adolescent.",

In catharsis, psychodramatic scenario is created that provides sensory stimulation which triggers emotional release and cathaic abreaction, in the patient who at the same time enjoys this. However, Freud noticed that while recovering suppressed feeling under hypnosis, patients were often unable or unwilling to recall significant distressing pa of memory. He referred this reluctance as resistance and excluding distressing material from conscious awareness as repression.

When sitting, the patient constantly shifts his body and legs, crosses and uncrosses his legs, and swings the free leg. Running in place and persistent pacing are also characteristic. This abnormality of movement is most prominent in the lower extremities and may not be accompanied, at least in mild forms of akathisia, by perceptible rigidity or other neurologic abnormalities. First noted in patients with Parkinson disease and senile dementia, akathisia is now observed most often in patients receiving neuroleptic drugs. This disorder can be induced in normal individuals by the administration of neuroleptic drugs or L-dopa. Akathisia refers to somatic restlessness which occur in patients treated with first generation antipsychotics. Among the options given haloperidol is an old generation antipsychotic which causes a side effect of akathisia.

Systematic desensitization is behaviour therapy of choice for specific and social phobiasQ whereas exposure and response prevention is behaviour therapy of choice for obscessive- compulsive disorder. QBehavior Therapy (BT). It is a sho duration (6-8 week) therapy based on theories of learning (Skinner's operant and Pavlov's classical conditioning) and assume that all behaviour is learned behaviour. So a behaviour that is followed by a reward (positive reinforcement) is more likely to occur again that behaviour is learned more easily if taught in small steps. It aims at changing maladaptive behaviour & substituting it with adaptive behaviot42. John B. Watson is father of behaviourism and Joseph Wolpe developed systemic desensitization. Types include: Systematic Desensitization (SD) Based on Wolpe's principle of counter conditioning or reciprocal inhibition, whereby a person over comes maladaptive anxiety by appoching the feared situation gradually in a state of complete psycophysiological relaxation It consists of 3 steps: relaxation training, hierarchy construction (i. e. a list is made of situations that provoke increasing degrees of anxiety) and desensitization (i. e. patient proceed systematically through the list from least to most anxiety provoking situation while in a deeply relaxed state)- Works best in clearly identifiable anxiety provoking stimulus such as phobias (simple & social) where it is BT of choiceQ, panic attacks, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessiove-compulsive disorder (BT of 2. d choice)Q and some sexual disorders. Therapeutic-Graded Exposure Similar to SD, except that relaxation training is not involved & treatment is usually carried out in a real life context to learn firsthand that no dangerous consequences will ensue. Flooding (Implosion)- Patient is exposed to maximum level of feared situation (near the top of hierarchy without a gradual buildup or relaxation exercises, as in SD) from the sta of treatment and remain their until autonomic habituation occurs/ anxiety diminishes. - Premature withdrawal from feared situation or prematurely terminating the fantasized scene (imaginal flooding) is equivalent. Contingency (Reinforcer) ) Contracting & Behaviour Exchange/Contingency Management- Operant is a term used to describe a mechanism by which a behavior operates on environment. In this learning model, behavior is not evoked or elicited (as in classic conditioning) but occurs independently, and environmental responses influence whether the behavior is continued or stopped. For a consequence to change a ceain behavior, the consequence must be contigent on the behavior. Contingency refers to the relationship between a behavior and the events that follow it. A consequence is contingent when it is delivred only after the target behavior is performed and it is otherwise not available. Reinforcement is a contigent event that strengthens the response that it follows (eg a child is given a chocolate when he smiles; the child then smiles again). Reinforcers are always individual (eg food may be reinforcer for a hungry person but not to one who has just finished a large meal). Primary reinf orcers are objects with their own intrinsic or inherent value such as food or water. Secondary reinforcers are objects that have acquired value (eg money). The notion of contingency is iron clad i. e. inconsistent applications of contingencies (such as not giving reward after desired behavior few times) results in poor response acquisition. A behavior may be positively reinforced, negatively reinforced or punished. Positive reinforcement increases the frequency of a paicular resonse by giving something ourable immediately after the response (eg candy). Negative reinforcement increases the frequency of a response by removing an aversive event immediately after response (scoulding / nagging stops after a child cleans his room). Punishment decreases the frequency of a response by either pesenting an aversive event following a response (eg spanking; punishment I) or a removal of a positive event following a response (eg allowance is withdrawn; punishment II). Contingent Action. Positive (+) Event. Negative Event (-). Given. Positive Reinforcement. Punishment ITaken Away. Punishment IINegative Reinforcement. Continuous reinfofcement means that reinforcemnt /punishment is applied every time the behavior occurs. Intermittent reinforcement occurs a/t schedule (eg every 3rd time) whereas, variable reinforcement is randomly determined.- Shaping and Chaining are other operant strategies for acquisition of new behaviors. Shaping is a process of reinforcing (rewarding) successive (gradual) approximations that come increasingly close to a desired behavior goal because they resemble the desired behavior or include a component of desired behavior. For example, in the case of selective mutism, the ultimate goal of treatment would be to have the child speak aloud in full sentences in front of others. Shaping uses a process of slow, small steps to reach this final goal.- Most daily activities require a series of small behaviors or steps that when performed in sequence form a chain. Forward chaining consists of teaching the sequence of behaviors beginning with the initial step in the chain (from 1 to 10). In backward to an escape, that would reinforce both conditioned anxiety & avoidance behaviour andproduce the opposite of desired effect. It works best in specific phobias and is contraindicated when intense anxiety would be hazardous to a patient (eg heart disease or fragile psychological patient). Exposure and Response Prevention. It is BT of choice for obscessional ritualsQ and is based on concept that the urge to carry out rituals diminishes if rituals can berestrained for long periods (- an hour)- Steps include: explaining the rationle of treatment & agreeing targets for exposure with patient --> Modelling (i. e. therapist demonstrates procedure himself) --> initially therapist suppo & accompany patients while they strive to prevent the rituals --> Urge to carry out rituals is made greater by persuading the patient and they do this on their own. Eye Movement Desensitization &Reprocessing- Inducing. Saccadic eye movements (which are rapid oscillation of eyes that occur when person follows rapid side to side moving object) while a person is imagining or thinking about (i. e. exposing to), an anxiety provoking event can yield a positive thought or image that results in decreased anxiety. Used in post traumatic stress disorders & phobias. Thought Stopping and Distraction- Automatic negative thoughts and repetitive, intrusive ruminations are some times too intense to address with purely cognitive interventions. So thought stopping, a behavioural ditraction technique capitalizes on the individuals ability to focusattention away from distressing thoughts by producing a sudden sensory stimulus. For example -Snapping a rubber band on the wrist as a distractor or visualizing a large red stop sign. The command \"stop! \" is paired with the image or snap- It has 4 stages: 1) defining & recording the behaviour to be changed (by another person) 2) identifying the stimuli and reinforcers by recording the events that immediately follow the behaviour, 3) redirecting reinforcement from problem behaviour to desired behaviours eg parents advised to attend less when child shouts & more when quiet, 4) monitoring progress. It relies on principles of 1) controlling over contingency or reinforcer controls behaviour, 2) positive contingency should be desirable & available sholy after the terms of contract have been met 3) terms of contract should be negotiated, specific & straight forward 4) pairing or chaining a high frequency behaviour (eg watching TV) to a low frequency one (eg doing paperwork/house work etc). 1) Reinforcement is a privilege that must be earned2) Good contracts are based on even exchange3) The value of contract is influenced by the reinforcement received4) A contract increases freedom within the relationship for both paies to earn the reinforcement that they deserve- Sta out relatively rich (eg 1 hour TV after 15 minutes of homework) and progressively thinned in time.- Used mainly in t/t of children & people with learning disbility and patients with medication adherence (pairing medication taking with routine activities)Q. - Token Economy (token reinforcement & response cost) Programs are a formalized method of contingency management, which clearly spells out a series of behaviors that are expected (eg making bed, arriving on time, cleaning) and the contingencies for compliance / non-compliance with these behavior goals (i. e. reward or privileges achieved or not respectively). Some programs include response cost (a form of punishment), which is the removal or withdrawl of a reinforcer / reward following in appropriate/problem behavior (eg fining a child for swearing). Imposing fine / response cost is very effective for suppressing undesirable behavior. The combination of token reinforcement and response cost is more effective then either alone. Child Management Training (CMT) is most established contingency managment program that teaches disciplinary skills to parents and includes: 1) how to use reinforcement to change a chld's behavior (positive reinforcement training; 2) how to attend to a desirable behavior to increase its frequency and ignore undesirable behavior to decrease their frequency (eg praising a child when he plays quietly & ignoring a child when he is interrupting); 3) how to give commands and use time outs & response costs. Time out is a punishment by the removal of positive reinforcement. Asseiveness Training- Asseive behaviour enables a person to act in his own best interest, to stand up for himself without undue anxiety, to express honest feelings comfoably & to exercise personal rights without denying the right of others.- By a combination of coaching, modelling (role playing), role reversal, videofeed back etc patients are encouraged to judge the level of self asseion and practise appropriate verbal & non verbal behaviours.- It is usually required for 1) Setting limits on pushy friends or relatives, 2) Social encounters such as being ignored by gossiping shop assistant, countering a sales pitch or being persistent when returning defective merchandise: Problem Solving Skills Training (PST). Impulsive/Careless problem solving, characterized by hurried, impulsive and careless attempts at problem resolution. And avoidant problem solving is procrastination, passivity and over dependence on others to provide solutions. Master's and Johnson's Dual Sex Therapy- Developed by William Masters and Virginia Johnson is a behaviour therapy used for treatment of sexual dysfunctions. In premature ejacutation, semen's squeeze technique and in male erectile disorder or impotence, sensate focus technique (to discover sensate focuses on body excluding genitalia where manipulation leads to sexual arousal); In orgasm and psychosexual disorders, orgasmic conditioning & desensitization are used. Habbit Reversal Training (H)- Has 4 components which include training in 1) becoming aware of onset of behavior (awareness training), 2) monitoring of behaviour and habit control motivation 3) initiating competing responses, that are incompatible with the behavior and inconspicuous (invisible) to others eg fist clenching is incompatable with body focused repetitive behaviours such as hair pulling, nail biting & skin picking (completing response training is the core of H), 4) relaxation & social suppo- Used to treat (reduce) repetitive behaviours (habbits) like tics, Tourette's syndrome, hair pulling, nail bitting & stutteringQ. Positive effects have been repoed but the evidence to decide the effectiveness of treatment is insufficient Rational problem solving is systematic, planned & constructive- Problems are defined as life situations tht require responses for adaptive functioning. Solutions are coping responses that alter the nature of problems, negative emotional reactions to them, or both- PST may be effective in wide range of situations (eg patients with schizophrenia, depression, eating disorders), psychological problems (eg smoking, marital discord) and stress a/w chronic illness. Social Skills Training- Some social behaviours can be learned eg making eye contact or staing conversation, negotiating & compromising, conflict management, community living, friendship & dating, work, vocation, medication management and asseiveness (eg making/refusing requests, making/ responding to complaints, making apologies, expressing unpleasant feelings /fear, asking for information, refusing drugs etc), - Useful for socially inadequate people or in rehabilitation of chronic mental disorders (Schizophrenia, depression, social phobia). Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD)- Depression is at least paially maintained by a lack of positive reinforcement. Severly depressed mood 1/t behavioral withdrawl, which inturn results in a loss of reinforcement from pleasureable events or activities.- Guiding principle of BATD is matching law, which states that behaviors are allocated to various alternatives (eg should I stay home or go out) based on the propoion of reinforcers obtained from the various alternatives. It says that depression persists because depressed behavior is more highly reinforced than nondepressed behavior. BATD increases the individual's exposure to positive out come of healthy behavior, there by increasing the frequency of these behaviors and reducing depressed behavior. Aversion Based Approches- Based on operant &/or counter conditioning strategies such as timeout, response cost and/or application of noxious stimulus to decrease the likelihood of undesived behavior.- Three different stimuli have been used as aversive conditioning stimuli 1) Chemical aversion (olfactory aversion = pairing of extremely noxious but harmless odors such as amonia with sexual perversion; gustatory /emetic aversion = pairing chemical that induces vomition with substance abuse). 2) Faradic or electrical aversion and. Verbal aversion (k/a Cove sensitization) involves the presentation of an imaginal scene involving dent behavior that is immediately f/b a scene that produces nausea. All three types of aversion therapies are used for treatment of sexual detions and substance abuseQ (however alone is rarely sufficient to treat substance abuse/ dependence)",

Expes think schizophrenia is caused by several factors. 1. Heredity (Genetic factors) Schizophrenia runs in families. The illness occur in 0. 5-1% of general population. However, First degree relative of schizophrenic patients have a 10 times more lifetime risk of having illness. The risk is 3-6 times and 2 times more in second and third degree relatives, respectively 2. Environmental factors Environmental factors and stress are impoant in precipitating schizophrenia in many individuals. These factors are:? Socioeconomic: - Low socio-economic status, Industrialization; Immigration; familes with high expressed emotions; Nuclear families; Schisms & skewed families; and pseudomutul & pseudohostile families. Drugs: - Drugs causing schizophrenia like state are amphetamine (most common causative drug), LSD, Phencyclidine, ketamine, Mescaline, Cocaine, Cannabis. Metabolic & Neurological disorders: - Schizophrenia like symptoms may occur in Huntington's chorea (early stage), homocystinuria, acute intermittent porphyria, Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis. 3. Biochemical factors Dopamine hypothesis is the most accepted hypothesis for schizophrenia. There is hyperactivity of dopaminergic system. This hypothesis is suppoed by: 1) Amphetamine and cocaine which release dopamine in central synapses induce schizophrenia like symptoms; and 2) Antipsychotic drugs control the schizophrenic symptoms by blocking dopamine (D, ) receptors. However, the dipamine hypothesis has been questioned also as Homo vanillic acid (HVA the principal metabolite of dopamine) is not elevated and prolactin level is not decreased (Dopamine has inihibitory action on prolactin release). Other neurotransmitters involved are: - Increased serotonin, Decreased GABA, variable change (Increased or decreased) glutamate, and increased norepinephrine.",

The term 'psychosis' was first formulated by Ernst von Feuchtersleben (1806-49) in his Principles of Medical Psychology.

It has also been valuable in the treatment of rapid cycling bipolar patients. Paroxetine is an example of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which is a newer form of antidepressant. The SSRis are being found to be as effective as the tricyclic antidepressants. Haloperidol is an example of a neuroleptic or antipsychotic medication useful in the management of acute psychosis, as well as long-term care. Clozapine is a newer atypical antipsychotic medication. It is not associated with tardive dyskinesia as are the older neuroleptics. This makes it a drug of choice for individuals who have developed signs of tardive dyskinesia after using other neuroleptics. Problems with agranulocytosis prevent clozapine from being used as a \"first line\" neuroleptic. Ref: Meltzer H. Y., Bobo W. V., Heckers S. H., Fatemi H. S. (2008). Chapter 16. Schizophrenia. In M.

        "exp": "ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that may affect 2%-10% of school-aged children and may persist into adolescence and adulthood. It is associated with a triad of symptoms: impulsivity, inattention, and hyperactivity. DSM IV-TR has described three ADHD subtypes: hyperactive-impulsive, inattentive, and combined; the combined subtypes often do not appear until 7 years of age. The majority of children with ADHD have a combined type with symptoms of inattention as well as hyperactivity and impulsivity. Girls have a higher prevalence of the inattentive subtype; boys have a higher prevalence of the hyper-active subtype. Although symptoms begin in early childhood, they can diminish between ages 10 and 25 years. Hyperactivity declines more quickly, and impulsivity and inattentiveness often persist into adolescence and adulthood. Ref: Goldson E., Reynolds A. (2012). Chapter 3. Child Development & Behavior.

Patients may insist that they are accompanied every time they leave the house. A severely affected patient may refuse to leave the house. The behaviour may result in marital discord. The situations are avoided (eg. travel is restricted) or else are endured with marked distress or anxiety about having a panic attack or panic-like symptoms. The anxiety or phobic avoidance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder, such as social phobia (eg. avoidance limited to social situations because of fear of embarrassment), specific phobias (eg. avoidance limited to single situation like elevators), OCD (eg avoidance of di in someone with an obsession about contamination), post-traumatic stress disorder (eg avoidance of stimuli associated with severe stressor), or separation anxiety disorder (eg avoidance of leaving home or relatives), Agoraphobia is usually associated with panic disorder. Agoraphobia without a h/o panic disorder is often incapacitating & chronic, and alcohol dependence often complicates its curse. Treatment is staed with SSRIs (paroxetine, seraline, or fluvoxamine). Benzodiazepines have the most rapid onset of action against panic, within the first week.

Patients with the restless leg syndrome describe a crawling or drawing sensation in the legs rather than an inner restlessness, although both disorders create an irresistible desire for movement. At times these distinctions are blurred. Many of the medications used for the restless legs syndrome are propoxyphene or clonazepam or treatment can be directed to the akathisia by selecting a less potent neuroleptic (if it is the suspected cause) or by using an anticholinergic medication, amantadine or perhaps the more effective and best tolerated--beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs.

Therefore, Hypochondriasis is abnormal preoccupation about normal body function, i. e., body functioning is normal but patient thinks it as abnormal. The preoccupation with the presence of a feared illness persists inspite of normal medical assessment and investigations. Patient goes from one doctor to another for a consultation. People with hypochondriasis are able to acknowledge that their fears are unrealistic (insight is present), but this intellectual realization is not enough to reduce their anxiety. Two impoant facts differentiate hypochondriasis from somatization disorder: - Patient with hypochondriasis is preoccupied with illness, on the other hand patient with somatization disorder is occupied with symptoms. Hypochondriasis patient is preoccupied with one illness (usually) while patient with somatization disorder has many (at least 8 or more) symptoms.",

Phenelzine, an MAO inhibitor, augments available catecholamine neurotransmitters for release into the synaptic cleft by inhibiting the intraneuronal breakdown of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. The degree of enzyme inhibition appears to be directly related to the antidepressant effect. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, exes its therapeutic effect by means of inhibition of serotonin reuptake into the presynaptic neuron, thus enhancing the availability of neurotransmitter for action on the postsynaptic neuron. There is controversy surrounding the use of these medications for obsessive-compulsive disorder, phobic disorder, and panic attack, in which derangements in catecholamine neurotransmitters are also implicated. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine used primarily as an anticonvulsant in the treatment of akinetic and myoclonic seizures. Haloperidol is a high potency antipsychotic agent with minimal anticholinergic propeies and maximal dopamine-blocking propeies; it is used in the treatment of schizophrenia, manic-depressive disorder, and other psychotic states. Benztropine is an anticholinergic used to manage the pseudoparkinsonian and extrapyramidal side effects of the higher potency antipsychotic agents like haloperidol. Ref: Olson K. R. (2013).

This is a hereditary form of mental retardation, but one that affects girls.

It is most evident on frontal lobe and occurs when patient is fully awake and ale. Therefore this replacement of beta rhythm for alpha rhythm is called arousal or aleing response or alpha block.

Malingering can lead to abuse of the medical system, with unnecessary tests being performed and time being wasted by the clinician as opposed to those with legitimate health problems. Malingering can exist in a variety of intensities, from pure (in which all symptoms are falsified) to partial, in which symptoms are exaggerated. Treatment: Treatment lies in the clinician being able to detect the disorder. Cues for the clinician include If the patient has legal problems Potential for financial reward, antisocial personality disorder If the patient's story is in congruent with known facts or other informant accounts If the patient will not cooperate while being evaluated Psychological evaluation is also recommended as a way to diagnose malingering, in particular, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2) as this measure has validity scales of value for this purpose. The MMPI-2 provides objective, scientifically based information about whether an individual has responded honestly to the test, or whether he or she has exaggerated or minimized psychological problems (possibly to obtain an external incentive, such as money damages in a personal injury lawsuit).",

The examiner gives the patient a series of numbers of increasing length, beginning with 3 or 4, at a rate of about one per second; the patient is asked to repeat them. The numbers should be random, nor following any identifiable pattern, for example, a phone number. Backward digit span, having the patient repeat a series of numbers in reverse order, is a more complex mental process that involves working memory; it requires the ability to retail, and manipulate the string of numbers. Expected performance is 7 +- 2 forward and 5 +- I backward. Reverse digit span should not be more than two digits less than the forward span. Forward digit span is also a test of repetition and may be impaired in aphasic patients. Another test of attention and concentration is a three-step task. For instance, tear a piece of paper in half, then tear half of it in half then tear one half in half again, so that there are three different sizes. Give the patient an instruction such as, \"Give the large piece of paper to me, put the small piece on the bed, and keep the other piece. \" Another multistep task might be, \"Stand up, face the door, and hold out your arms. \"-",

Dysthymia (Meaning bad mood/ill humored) Disorder. Clinical Pincture. Long standing insidious onset sub threshold depression of fluctuating or persistent nature dating back to late childhood or the teens, preceding any major depressive episodes by years, even decades. A return to low grade depressive pattern is the rule following recovery from superimposed major depressive episodes, if any, hence the name double depression. Low grade chronic depressive profile marked by fluctuating complaint consisting of gloominess, pessimism, lethargy (low drive), self doubt, lack of joie de vivre (i. e. low enjoyment of life), yet endowed with self critical attitudes & suffering for others. Typically work hard (back bone of society), devoting their lives to jobs that require dependability & great attention to detail, but do not enjoy their work. At their best, they invest what ever energy they have in work, leaving none for leisure or social activities. They are satisfied with nothing, complain of everything and brood about their usefullness of existence. Their entire existence is a burden for them. Often complain of having been depressed since bih. They view themselves as belonging to an aristocracy of suffering. These hyperbolic descriptions of suffering in absence of more objective signs of depression label them characterological depression.

This was contrasted to a personality style they labeled \"Type B, \" which was defined as the absence of Type A characteristics, that is, easy-going, patient, and soft-spoken. Why is this significant? Their initial findings were that Type As were more than twice as likely as Type Bs to develop heart disease in the form of angina, silent hea attacks, ove hea attacks, and coronary death. Although subsequent large-scale studies failed to show this relationship, more recent research has isolated a \"toxic core\" of Type A that includes hostility, anger, cynicism, suspiciousness, and excessive self-involvement. Hostility is conceptualized as comprising three elements: the emotion of anger, its expression, and cognitions of cynical mistrust. Using well-validated measures of the cognitive aspect of hostility, recent research has linked higher hostility scores with subsequent coronary events like hospitalizations for angina, nonfatal MI, stroke, and congestive heart failure. Higher hostility has also been associated with coronary risk factors, such as increased plasma homocysteine levels, triglycerides, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, glucose levels, alcohol consumption, and smoking. In a study of middle-aged women each one-point increase in hostility scores predicted a significantly higher intimal-medial thickening in the carotid aeries. Ref: Christensen J. F. (2008).

Non-REM (NREM) or slow-wave sleep: - It is called Non-REM sleep because no rapid eye movement (REM) is there on eletrooculogram, rather there is slow or quiscent eye movement. It is also referred as S-sleep (synchronized sleep) or quiet sleep or ohodox sleep because there diminished physiological functions and a low level of overall activity. It is fuher divided into:? Stage 1: - It is a transition from wakefulness to sleep and is characterized by disappearance of alpha activity and appearance of theta activity. There is slow eye movements. Stage 2: - It is characterized by typical EEG activity i. e., Sleep spindles and IC-complex'. No eye movement occurs. Stage 3 & 4: - Stage 3 & 4 are stages of deep sleep. These are also called slow wave sleep as these stages are characterized by slow delta waves. Delta wave appearance stas in stage 3 and dominated in stage 4. REM sleep: - The REM sleep is so named as there is rapid roving movements of eye, i. e., rapid eye movement (REM)on electro-oculogram. It is also called paradoxical sleep because there is a paradoxical elevation of brain activity & metabolism and physiological activity. The high-amplitude slow waves seen in stage 3, 4 of REM sleep is replaced by rapid low voltage activity (beta wave). Features of REM sleep are: - EEG Beta wave, Reappearance of alpha wave, Saw-tooth wave (low voltage fast activity), Pontogenital-occipital spikes.

The syndrome is usually marked by withdrawn behavior that simulates autism, dementia, ataxia, loss of purposeful hand movements, and respiratory irregularities. Ref: Ropper A. H., Samuels M. A.
