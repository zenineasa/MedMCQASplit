Delusional Disorder This disorder, also previously called as a paranoid disorder, is characterised by the following clinical features in ICD-10. Persistent delusions must be present for at least 3 months and these can include delusions of persecution (being persecuted against), delusions of grandeur (inflated self-esteem and self-image), delusions of jealousy (infidelity), somatic (hypochondriacal) delusions, erotomanic delusions (delusions of love), and/or other non-bizarre delusions. It is impoant to note the absence of prominent hallucinations, organic mental disorders, schizophrenia and mood disorders. The emotional response and behaviour are often understandable in the light of their delusional beliefs, with behaviour outside the 'limits' of delusions usually almost normal. Very often, these individuals are able to carry on a near normal social and occupational life without arousing suspicion regarding their delusional disorder. It is only when the area of delusions is probed or confronted that the dysfunction becomes evident. When the content of delusions is predominantly jealousy (infidelity) involving the spouse, it is called as Othello syndrome or conjugal paranoia.
