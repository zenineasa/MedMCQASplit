It prevents the rate of breakdown of c. GMP causing enhanced relaxation of cavernosal smooth muscle, increase in aerial flow into corpus cavernosa, compression of subtunical veins, and hence penile erection. The typical dose is 50 mg (25-100 mg), 1 hour before sexual activity. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once a day. The adverse effects include a transient and mild headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and nasal congestion. Caution needs to be exercised in patients with known history of hypersensitivity, Other similar drugs include tadalafil and vardenafil.
