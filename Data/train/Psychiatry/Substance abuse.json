        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Methadone Maintenance therapy for opioid addiction* Once detoxification phase is over (i. e., withdrawal symptoms have been managed), the patient is maintained on any of the following drugs to prevent relapse by reducing craving and preventing 'kick' or 'euphoria' produced by opioids (morphine or heroin). Drugs used are: -1. Methadone: - Reduces craving and 'kick/euphoria from morphine or heroin because their opioid receptors are already occupied. 2. LAAM and buprenorphine: - Similarly reduce craving. 3. Opioid antagonists (naltrexone): - Naltrexone can be used orally to assist in the rehabilitation of ex-opioid abusers who are fully withdrawn (otherwise it induces an acute withdrawal syndrome). Naltrexone prevents relapse by discouraging substance seeking behavior - If a patient, who is on naltrexone maintenance therapy, takes an opioid, there is no 'kick' or euphoria as opioid receptors are already blocked. Naltrexone can be used with clonidine as in detoxification. Treatment of opioid addiction* Treatment can be divided into: -A. Treatment of toxicity (overdose)# Overdose is a medical emergency and is treated with opioid antagonist to reverse the complications (respiratory depression) by antagonizing the action on opioid receptors. Intravenous naloxone is the antagonist of choice for morphine (heroin) poisoning. Oral naltrexone is used for maintenance therapy, once acute poisoning has been treated by iv naloxone. Intravenous nalmefene is another specific antagonist. B. Treatment of dependence# Treatment of dependence include medically supervised withdrawal and detoxification, followed by maintenance therapy. a. Detoxification* Detoxification process include abrupt withdrawal of opioid followed by management of the emergent withdrawal symptoms, i. e., treatment of withdrawal syndrome. Detoxification can be done by any of the following. i) Substitution of long-acting opioid agonism: - Methadone is the treatment of choice. Because of its agonistic activity on opioid receptors it suppresses withdrawal symptoms. L-alpha-acetyl-methadol/ Levomethyl (LAAM) is the other opioid agonist which was used for this purpose. However it is no longer in use because some patients developed prolonged QT intervals (torsades de points). ii) Substitution of partial agonist: - Buprenorphine can be used in place of methadone because of its partial agonistic activity on opioid receptor. iii) Substitution by a2 agonists: - Clonidine as a sympatholytic agent due to its agonistic action on central presynaptic a2 receptors which reduce nor-adrenergic activity. Therefore, clonidine reduces the adrenergic withdrawal symptoms. Lofexidine, another a2 agonist, is an alternative to clonidine. iv) Clonidine plus naltrexone: - A more rapid detoxification can occur when clonidine is used along with naltrexone. Naltrexone, when given in opioid dependent patient, causes withdrawal symptoms because of its antagonistic action. These can be treated with clonidine. The addition of short acting Benzodiazepine (lorazepam or oxazepam) and NSAIDs, will help to relieve withdrawal symptoms not covered by clonidine. It should be kept in mind that naltrexone should not be used alone for detoxification (to treat withdrawal syptoms) as it precipitates or worsens the withdrawal syndrome. v) Other drugs: - Dextropropoxyphene, diphenoxylateb.

With increasing intoxication, there is increased reaction time, slowed thinking, distractibility and poor motor control. Later, dysahria, ataxia and incoordination can occur. There is a progressive loss of self-control with frank disinhibited behaviour. The duration of intoxication depends on the amount and the rapidity of ingestion of alcohol. With blood alcohol levels of 300-450 mg%, increasing drowsiness followed by coma and respiratory depression develop. Death occurs with blood alcohol levels between 400 to 800 mg%. Occasionally a small dose of alcohol may produce acute intoxication in some persons. This is known as pathological intoxication.

Cellular or pharmacodynamics tolerance# Second, cellular or pharmacodynamic tolerance develops through neurochemical changes that may also contribute to physical dependence.# The cellular changes caused by chronic alcohol exposure may not resolve for several weeks or longer following cessation of drinking. Behavioural tolerance# Third, individuals can develop behavioural tolerance, i. e., can learn to adapt their behaviour so that they can function better than expected under drug influence. Functional Tolerance# Humans and animals develop tolerance when their brain functions adapt to compensate for the disruption caused by alcohol in both their behavior and their bodily functions. This adaptation is called functional tolerance. Environment-dependent tolerance# The development of tolerance to alcohol's effects over several drinking sessions is accelerated if alcohol is always administered in the same environment or is accompanied by the same cues. This effect has been called environment- dependent tolerance. Learned tolerance# The development of tolerance also can be accelerated by practicing a task while under the influence of alcohol. This phenomenon is called behaviorally augmented (i. e., learned) tolerance. Educational points: EFFECTS OF BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVELS IN THE ABSENCE OF TOLERANCEBlood Level, mg/d. LUsual Effect20.

Metronidazole has a well-documented disulfiram-like effect, and some patients will experience abdominal distress, vomiting, flushing, or headache if they drink alcoholic beverages during or within 3 days of therapy with this drug. Patients should be cautioned to avoid consuming alcohol during metronidazole treatment even though the risk of a severe reaction is low.

Drugs used in alcohol dependence can divided into 2 groups1. Deterrant agents like disufiram2. Anti craving agents -acamprostate, naltrexone and SSRIs. Complications seen in alcohol dependence. Complications of acute intoxication are: Emotional and behavioural disturbance, hypoglycaemia, aspiration of vomit, respiratory depression, accidents, and injuries sustained in fights. Effects on the central nervous system- blackouts, cerebellar degeneration, central pontine myelinolysis, Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome (thinning of the corpus callosum along with a change in consciousness, ataxia, and possible dementia) Wernicke's encephalopathy, Korsakoff's psychosis, dementia, cerebral haemorrhage. Peripheral Neuropathy: Gastrointestinal problems- Fatty liver, liver failure leading to hepatic encephalopathy, acute pancreatitis, esophagitis, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, malabsorption. Cerebrovascular and Cardiovascular Problems: enhanced risk for myocardial infarction and thrombosis, alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Cancer-High rates of most cancers are seen in alcoholic people, especially those of the head, neck, esophagus, stomach, liver, colon, lungs, and breast tissue. Fetal alcohol effect-Surviving infants of heavy-drinking mothers can evidence any mixture of the components of a syndrome that, in its full-blown form, can include severe mental retardation, a small head, a diminished physical size, facial abnormalities (including a flat bridge of the nose, an absent philtrum, and an epicanthal eye fold), an atrial septal heart defect, and syndactyly. Wernicke's encephalopathy. This is an acute reaction to a severe deficiency of thiamine, the commonest cause being alcohol use. It characteristically occurs after a period of vomiting. The important clinical signs are1. Ocular signs- Coarse nystagmus and ophthalmoplegia, with bilateral external rectus palsy occuring early. Pupillary irregularities, retinal haemorrhages and papilledema can occur, causing impairment of vision. 2. Higher mental faction disturbance- Disorientation, confusion, recent memory disturbances, poor attention span and distractibility are also common. Ataxia and apathy are often seen. Peripheral neuropathy and serious malnutrition are often coexistent. Neuropathology - Neuronal degeneration and haemorrhage are seen in thalamus, hypothalamus, mammillaiy bodies and mid-brain. Korsakoff psychosis. This often follows Wernicke's encephalopathy. Usually caused by severe, untreated thiamine deficiency secondary to chronic alcohol use. Clinical features-Korsakoff psychosis presents as an organic amnestic syndrome, characterized by severe short-term memory deficits with confabulation. Insight is often impaired. Neuropathology- The most consistent changes are seen in bilateral dorsomedial nuclei of thalamus and mammillary bodies. Changes are also seen in periventricular and periaqueductal grey matter, cerebellum and parts of brain stem. CAGE questionnaire is used for screening purpose for detection of problem drinkers. Impairment Likely to be seen at Different Blood Alcohol Concentrations. Level. Likely Impairment20-30 mg/d. LSlowed motor performance and decreased thinking ability30-80 mg/d. LIncreases in motor and cognitive problems80-200 mg/d. LIncreases in incoordination and judgment errors. Mood lability. Deterioration in cognition200-300 mg/d. LNystagmus, marked slurring of speech, and alcoholic blackouts>300 mg/d. LImpaired vital signs and possible death. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome-Withdrawal develops because the brain has physically adapted to the presence of a brain depressant and cannot function adequately in the absence of the drug. The most common withdrawal syndrome is a hangover on the next morning. Tremors are the most common symptom of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal phenomena are likely to begin within approximately 8 hours of abstinence, reach a peak intensity on the second or third day, and markedly diminish by the fourth or fifth day. Delirium tremens (DT) is the most severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome. It occurs usually within 2-4 days of complete or significant abstinence from heavy alcohol drinking in about 5% of patients. The characteristic features are: 1) Clouding of consciousness2) Poor attention span3) Visual and auditory hallucinations and illusions. Tactile hallucinations of insects crawling over the body may occur. 4) Marked autonomic dysfunction with tachycardia, fever, sweating, hypertension, and papillary dilation5) Psychomotor agitation and ataxia6) Insomnia, with reversal of sleep wake cycle7) Dehydration with electrolyte imbalance. Rum fits (Alcoholic seizures)GTC seizures may occur in about 10% of alcohol dependence patients usually after 12-48 hrs after heavy bout of drinking. Alcoholic hallucinosis is characterized by the presence of hallucinations (usually auditory) during partial or complete abstinence, following regular alcohol intake. TREATMENTDetoxification-It is the management of alocohol withdrawal symptoms. Drug of choice for detoxification are usually benzodiazepines. Chlordiazepoxide(80-100 mg/ day in divided doses), diazepam (40-80 mg/day) and lorazepam are the most frequently used benzodiazepines.

The higher limit of the normal dose range is used in delirium tremens.

However, in more severe dependence, higher doses are needed for longer periods (up to 10 days).

Thirdindividuals can develop behavioural tolerance, i. e. can learn to adapt their behaviour so that they can function better than expected under drug influence. UNCOMMON TOLERANCE TYPESFunctional. Tolerance. Humans and animals develop tolerance when their brain functions adapt to compensate for the disruption caused by alcohol in both their behavior and their bodily functions. This adaptation is called functional tolerance. Environment- dependent tolerance. The development of tolerance to alcohol's eff ects over several drinking sessions is accelerated if alcohol is always administered in the same environment or is accompanied by the same cues. This effect has been called environment-dependent tolerance. Learned tolerance. The development of tolerance also can be accelerated by practising a task while under the influence of alcohol.

Naltrexone is an orally available narcotic antagonist which, when given to an opioid-dependent individual, causes withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms are managed with the addition of clonidine for 10-14 days after which clonidine is withdrawn and the patient has continued on naltrexone alone.

Therefore, this method is a combination of detoxification and maintenance treatment. The usual dose of naltrexone is 100 mg orally, administered on alternate days. Once again treatment is usually staed in an inpatient psychiatric or specialist alcohol and drug treatment centre setting. Other Drugs: The other detoxification agents include LAAM ( Levo-alpha-acetyl-Methadol), propoxyphene, diphenoxylate, buprenorphine (long-acting synthetic paial m-agonist which can be administered sublingually), and lofexidine (a2 agonist, similar to clonidine).

Due to tolerance, chronic heavy drinkers can present with fewer symptoms, even with blood alcohol levels greater than 500 mg/dL.",
