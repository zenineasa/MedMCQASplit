In general, napping is discouraged except in elderly and debilitated patients. Two caveats are in order when helping to educate a patient about sleep hygiene. The first is that these are general principles and are not applicable to all patients.

This is called purging. Purging might be done by. Making yourself throw up Taking laxative - pills or liquids that speed up the movement of food. Exercising a lot. Eating very little or not at all. Taking water pills to urinate. Diagnosis. According to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM - IVTR) published by the American psychological association the criteria for diagnosing a patient with bulimia are. Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by the following. Eating in a fixed period of time, an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat under similar circumstances. A lack of control over eating during the episode. A feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviour to prevent weight gain such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxative, diuretics or other medications, fasting, excessive exercise. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight. These symptoms occur at least twice a week on average and persist for at least 3 months. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa. There are two types of Bulimia Nervosa Purging type. These patients self induce vomiting (usually by triggering the gag reflex or ingesting emetics such as syrup of ipecac) to rapidly remove food from the body before it can be digested such as diuretics and enemas. Non purging types. These bulimics (approx. irately 6-8% of cases) exercise or fast excessively after a binge to offset the caloric intake after eating purging type bulimics may also exercise or fast but as a secondary form of weight control. The onset of bulimia nervosa is often during adolescence (b/w/3-20 years of age) with many sufferers relapsing in adulthood into episodic binging and purging even after initially successful treatment and remission.

        "question": "A young lady presents with repeated episodes of excessive eating followed by purging by use of laxatives. What is the diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Bulimia nervosa Bulimia nervosa is a type of eating disorder. It is often just called bulimia. A person with bulimia eats a lot of food in a short amount of time. This is called \"binging\". The person may feel gaining weight after a binge. Binging also can cause fear of shame and guilt. So the person tries to undo the binge by getting rid of the food. This is called purging. Purging might be done by:-Making yourself throw up. Taking laxative - pills or liquids that speed up the movement of food. Exercising a lot. Eating very little or not at all. Taking water pills to urinate Diagnosis. According to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM - IVTR) published by the American Psychological association the criteria for diagnosing a patient with bulimia are:-Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by the following:-Eating in a fixed period of time, an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat under similar circumstances. A lack of control over eating during the episode. A feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviour to prevent weight gain such as:-Self-induced vomiting. Misuse of laxative. Diuretics or other medications. Fasting. Excessive exercise. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight. These symptoms occur at least twice a week on average and persist for at least 3 months. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa. There are two types of Bulimia Nervosa. Purging type. These patients self induce vomiting (usually by triggering the gag reflex or ingesting emetics such as syrup of ipecac) to rapidly remove food from the body before it can be digested such as diuretics and enemas. Non purging types. These bulimics (approx. imately 6-8% of cases) exercise or fast excessively after a binge to offset the caloric intake after eating purging type bulimics may also exercise or fast but as a secondary form of weight control. The onset of bulimia nervosa is often during adolescence (b/w/3-20 years of age) with many sufferers relapsing in adulthood into episodic binging and purging even after initially successful treatment and remission. Treatment. Cognitive behavioural therapy which involves teaching clients to challenge automatic thoughts and engage in behavioural experiments (e. g. in session eating of 'forbidden foods\").* This is a case of Donovanosis. It occurs due to infection with calymmatobacterium granulomatosis Diagnosis of Donovanosis is based on. Presence of lesion in genital or perianal region QExuberant ulcer with beefy red floor with a raised Serpiginous Q margin.*Absence of lymphadenopathy(r), though pseudo bubo may be present in the inguinal region. Tissue smears show \"bipolar inclusions in macrophages\" Q. Clinical features. Single Q(sometimes multiple asymptomatic ulcers). Floor is made of beefy, exuberant granulation tissues, which bleeds easily on manipulation. Border is elevated and has serpiginous outline. Location of ulcers:-Males: Gains Q (M. C.) prepuce, shaft of the penis, perianal area and penoscrotal junction. Females: Labia majora, mons veneris and perianal area. Lymphadenopathy:-Not seen. Sometimes subcutaneous swelling appear in the inguinal region (pseudo buboes) Q and these may ulcerate to form typical ulcers of donovanosis.",

Important disorders are: -i) Somnambulism (Night walking): - Patient walks during sleep. ii) Sleep terror or night terrors (pavor nocturnus): - The patient suddenly gets up screaming, with autonomic arousal (tachycardia, sweating). Sleep terrors are rarely remembered in the morning (in contrast to night mares). No treatment is required only reassurance is required. However, in severe cases benzodiazepine can be used. iii) Sleep-related enuresis (Nocturnal enuresis/bed wetting): - Repetitive voiding occurs during sleep. First line of treatment is behaviour therapy. If behavioral therapy fails, desmopressin (DOC) and Imipraminecan be used. iv) Bruxism (Teeth grinding)v) Sleep-talking (Somniloquy). B) REM sleep eventsi) Nocturnal penile tumescence: - It is spontaneous occurence of an erection of the penis during sleep. It is a normal phenomenon and occurs for 80-120 minutes per night. Nocturnal penile tumescence can be used to differentiate between psychogenic impotence and organic impotence as nocturnal penile tumescence is preserved in psychogenic impotence but not in organic cause of impotence. ii) Night mares (dream anxiety disorder): - They are characterized by fearful dreams occuring in the last one third of night sleep. The person wakes up frightned and remembers the dream vividly (in contrast to night terror). iii) Narcolepsy: - This is characterized by excessive day time sleep, often disturbed night time sleep and decreased in the REM sleep. Age of onset is between 10-20 years. There is irresistable desire to sleep and bouts of sudden sleep each lasting for 10-30 minutes occuring during day time. In majority of cases narcolepsy is associated with one or more accessory symptoms: -a) Cataplexy: - It is the most common accessory symptom and is characterized by sudden decrease in muscle tone either, local or generalized. b) Hypnagogic hallucination: - Hallucination occuring just before falling asleep. When hallucination occurs just before awakening it is called hyponopompic hallucinations. c) Sleep paralysis (least common)",
