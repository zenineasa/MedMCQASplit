        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Catatonia Disorders of motor activityo Disorder of motor activity may be. Mannerism Odd, repetitive and goal directed movements, e. g., waving, saluting. Stereotype Odd, repetitive movements which are not goal directed e. g., rocking to and fro. Repetition of speechs (words, phrases) may also occur. Sterotype occur without any stimulus. Perseveration:- There is persistent repetition of movement or speech, beyond fulfilment of purpose. Patient is unable to stop the action or speech beyond fulfilment of purpose. Perseveration is goal directed and requires external stimulus (in contrast to stereotypy). Note: Sterotypy and perseveration may be seen either as speech disturbance or as motor activity disturbance, i. e., repetion of speech or movemnt. Echopraxia Patients senselessly repeat the movement of others around them (associated with echolalia). TIC Sudden, involuntary, rapid, recurrent non-rhythmic motor movements. Catatonia Catatonia is characterized by a marked disturbance of motor behaviour. Most common cause of catatonia is schizophrenia, However it may also occur in depression, Mania, conversion - dissociative disorders, reactive psychosis, hypnosis, anxiety disorders and many medical disorders. Catatonia may be of following types. Catatonic excitment. Excited, uncontrolled motor activity, not influenced by external stimuli. Catatonic posturing:- Voluntary adoption of an unusual or bizarre position that is then maintained for some time. Catatonic rigidity:- Maintaining a fixed position and rigidity resisting all attempts to be moved. Waxy flexibility (flexibilitas cerea or catalepsy): - Maintaining of particular posture imposed on the patient by examiner, even if the posture is bizzare and uncomfortable, i. e., patient can be moulded like wax into a position that is then maintained. Catatonic stupor:- Patient is mute and immobile (akinetic mutism) but fully conscious. Catatonic negativism:- A seemingly motiveless resistance to all instructions or attempts to be moved. Automatic obedience:- Exactly reverse to negativism, i. e., unhesitating compliance to all instructions without apparent conscious control.",

        "question": "A schizophrenic patient shows abnormal back and forth movements of hands, diagnosis -",
        "exp": "Ans is 'a' i. e. Catatonic schizophrenia o Clinical subtypes of schizophrenia are:-1) Paranoid schizophrenia:- This is the commonest type of schizophrenia. The core symptoms are delusions of persecution, i. e., there are suspicious ideas and belief. Delusions of grandeur, reference, Control and double are also common as are the auditory hallucinations. There is minimal or no disturbances of affect volition, speech, motor behavior, and personality. The onset is in later life (3rd- 4th decade), in contrast to other subtypes. The prognosis is better than other subtypes (only catotonic schizophrenia has better prognosis better than paranoid). Amphetamine can cause paranoid schizophrenia like symptoms. 2) Hebephrenic (Disorganized) schizophrenia:- It is the second most common type of schizophrenia. As evident from its name (disorganized), this type of schiophrenia is marked by disorganized thought, behavior, speech, affect, and personality with fragmentary and changeable delusions and hallucinations. This is one of the subtype where emotional impairment is prominent (e. g., flat or inappropriate affect). It has one of the worst prognosis as negative symptoms occur early (e. g., flat, blunted or inappropriate affect). This subtype starts early in 2nd decade. 3) Catatonic schizophrenia:- It is characterized by a marked disturbance of motor behavior. It may occur in three forms:-a) Excited catatonia:- It is characterized by increased in psychomotor activity (restlessness, agitation, excitment, aggressiveness, violence) and increase in speech production (Pressure of speech). Psychomotor activity is purposeless and has not apparent relationship with external environment. The impulsive activity may occur in response to hallucinations and delusions. Reactive catatonia has the best prognosis. b) Stuporous (retarded) catatonia:- Characterized by extreme retardation of psychomotor function, which includes mutism, rigidity, negativism, posturing, echolalia, Echopraxia, Catalepsy (waxy flexibility), ambitendency, gegenhalten, Streotypies, stupor, Mannerism, Grimicing), Automatic obedience, and verbigeration. c) Catatonia alternating between excitment and stupor:- The features of both excited catatonia and stuporous catatonia are altematingly present. 4) Undifferentiated schizophrenia:- This type meets the general diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia but symptoms do not meet the criteria for paranoid, catatonic, and disorganized schizophrenia. 5) Residual schizophrenia:- This represents a chronic stage of schizophrenia with incomplete remissions and residual negative symptoms (lack of drive, shallow affect) with no or minimal recurrence of positive symptoms (i. e., Absence of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, catatonic behavior). 6) Simple schizophrenia:- Characterized by a slow and progressive withdrawal from the social and work situations. Except for lack of drive & initiative (due to withdrawal) and shallow emotions the patient does not exhibit any psychotic features (Hallucination or delusions are not present), i. e., there are only negative symptoms and no positive symptoms. In simple schizophrenia positive symptoms do not occur at any time during the course, in contrast to residual schizophrenia where positive symptoms occur initially but later on only residual negative symptoms remain to be present. 7) Other:- In post-schizophrenic depression the depressive symptoms become florid as an outcome of schizophrenic illness and not as a reaction to it. Schizophrenia when occurs in the presence of mental retardation, is called pfropf schizophrenia. Von-Gogh syndrome is a dramatic self multilation in schizophrenia.",

        "question": "A person with violent behavior and agitation was diagnosed to have Schizophrenia and was receiving haloperidol. Following this he developed rigidity and inability to move his eyes. Which of the following drugs should be added to his treatment intravenously for this condition?",
        "exp": "Ans. c. Promethazine (Ref: Harrison 19/e p2624, 18/e p3544. Katzung 12/e p495). Rigidity and inability to move eyes after haloperidol use in a patient of Schizophrenia is highly suggestive of acute muscular dystonia. Treatment with IM anticholinergic (benztropine) or IV/IM antihistaminic (diphenhydramine hydrochloride almost always relieves the symptoms. Promethazine, 25-50 mg IV or IM, has been used less frequently but readily available. Acute Muscular Dystonia: Bizarre muscle spasms, mostly involving linguo-facial muscles-grimacing, torticollis, locked jaw. QOccurs within few hours of single dose or at the most in the first week of therapy. QMore common in children below 10 years and in girls, particularly after parenteral administration. QTreatment: Central anticholinergicQ, promethazineQ or hydroxyzine. Neuroleptic Induced Acute Dystonia. About 10% of all patients experience dystonia as an adverse effect of dopamine receptor antagonist, usually in the first few hours or days of treatmentQ (early onset during the course of treatment with neuroleptics). Most common in young men (< 40 years old). Most common with high doses of high potency dopamine receptor antagonistQ especially via IM route (haloperidol is high potency drug and 20 mg/day is high dose), shortly after starting the drug or increasing its doseQ. It results from dopaminergic hyperactivity in the basal ganglia, that occurs when the CNS levels of dopamine receptor antagonist drug begin to fall between doses. Clinical Features: Dystonic movements result from a slow, sustained muscular contraction or spasm that can result in an involuntary movement. It can involve the:* Face (grimacing)Q* Neck (spasmodic torticollisQ or retrooollis)* Jaw (forced opening resulting in dislocation of jaw or trismusQ)* Tongue (protrusions, twisting)Q* Eye (oculogyric crisisQ characterized by eyes' upward lateral movement)* Dystonic posture of limb and trunkQ* Spinal muscles (opisthotonos)Q* Blepharospasm, glossopharyngeal and laryngopharyngeal dystonia, which can result in dysarthria, dysphagia, and even trouble breathing, which can cause cyanosis. Unlike other types of dystonia, an oculogyric crisis may occur late in treatment. Children are particularly likely to exhibit opisthotonos, scoliosis, lordosis, and writhing movements. Treatment: Treatment with IM anticholinergic (benztropine) or IV/IM antihistaminic (diphenhydramine hydrochloride)Q almost always relieves the symptoms. Promethazine, 25-50 mg IV or IM has been used less frequently but readily available. Extrapyramidal Disturbances of anti-Psychotic drugs. These are the major dose limiting side effects. QMore prominent with high potency drugs like fiuphenazine, haloperidol, pimozide etcQ. Least with thioridazine, clozapine, olanzapine, and low doses of resperidoneQ. These are of following types: Parkinsonism: With typical manifestations-rigidity, tremor, hypokinesia, mask like facies, shuffling gait. QAppears between 1-4 weeks of therapy. QTreatment: Central anticholinergic drugs. QRabbit syndromeA rare form of extrapyramidal side effect is perioral tremors \"rabbit syndrome\"Occurs years after of therapy. Treatment: Central anticholinergic drugs. QAcute muscular dystonia: Bizarre muscle spasms, mostly involving linguo-facial muscles-grimacing, torticollis, locked jaw. QOccurs within few hours of single dose or at the most in the first week of therapy. QMore common in children below 10 years and in girls, particularly after parenteral administration. QTreatment: Central anticholinergicQ, promethazineQ or hydroxyzine. Akathisia: Restlessness, feeling of discomfort, apparent agitation manifested as compelling desire to move about but without anxiety. QBetween 1-8 weeks of therapy. QNo specific antidote is available. Treatment: Propranolol. QMalignant neuroleptic syndrome: Occurs rarely with high doses of potent agents. QMarked rigidity, immobility, tremor, fever, semi-consciousness, fluctuating BP and heart rate, myoglobin may be present in blood-lasts 5-10 days after drug withdrawal and may be fatalQ. Treatment: Stop neuroleptic. Bromocriptine. QTardive dyskinesia: Occurs late in therapy (Chronic therapy), sometimes even after withdrawal of neuroleptic. QManifests as purposeless involuntary facial and limb movements like constant chewing, pouting, puffing of cheeks, lip licking, choreoathetoid movements. QMore common in elderly women. QProbably a manifestation of progressive neuronal degeneration along with supersensitivity to DAAccentuated by anticholinergics and temporarily suppressed by high doses of neurolepticsQ",

Multiple randomized trials have found that maintenance of antipsychotic medication reduces the risk of relapse over a period of up to two years. \"A meta-analysis of 6493 patients with schizophrenia in 65 randomized trials of 7 to 12 months duration found that patients who continued on an antipsychotic experienced a lower relapse rate compared to patients withdrawn from an antipsychotic and receiving placebo (27 versus 64 percent; number needed to treat to benefit = 3, 95% Cl 2--3). Other studies of up to two years have found similar results. Although the current consensus is that antipsychotic should be prescribed for 1-2 years after 1st episode of schizophrenia. Gitlan et al found that withdrawing the antipsychotic leads to relapse at rate of 80 % after one years of medication free and relapse at rate of 98% after 2 years of medication free. \"-- Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines in Psychiatry 12/e p31.
