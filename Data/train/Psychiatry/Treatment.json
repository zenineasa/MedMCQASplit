        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Behavior therapy * Nail tic disorders are examples of body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs). They are self-grooming behaviors that include pulling, picking, biting or scraping one's hair, skin or nails. They include -A) Hair pulling to the point of having seriously thinned hair or bald spots, missing eyebrows, or eyelashesB) Skin picking, resulting in scabs, sores that never heal, holes in the skin, and scarringC) Nail and/or cuticle biting, causing bleeding or infected fingertipsD) Blemish picking or squeezing, causing scarring and infectionsE) Biting the inside of the cheek* BFRBs most often begin in late childhood or in the early teens. Treatment* There are three main types of help. These are behavioral therapy, medication, and family therapy: 1) Behavioral therapy is usually the preferred way. It consists of two approaches: Habit Reversal Therapy (HRT), which teaches the sufferer a set of alternative behaviors that can help them focus themselves, interrupt, and block the behavior, and Stimulus Control (SC), which teaches them how to identify, change, and control the different triggers present in their routines, environments, and moods that lead to the behaviors. 2) Medication can be of help in some cases. It should be regarded as a tool to help with behavior therapy. Effective medications are Clomipramine, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), Other Antidepressants, Naltrexone, Neuroleptics, Lithium, Other Agents/ Supplements3) Family therapy can be extremely valuable in a number of ways, and can make important contributions in healing the family, and aiding the sufferers recovery.",

        "exp": "Ans. D. Behavioral. (Ref: Kaplan & Sadockfs Synopsis of Psychiatry, Xth/Ch. 35. 8, Page no, 954). Therapeutic exposure is form of Behavioral therapy. A behavioral therapist would most likely instruct the patient to change his/her behavior as an antecedent to recovery (such as exercising or another activity). No medication has proven to be effective in treating specific phobias. The Rx of choice for specific phobias is exposure, in vivo or using techniques of guided imagery, pairing relaxation exercises with exposure to the feared stimulus. The patient can be exposed to the feared stimulus gradually or can be asked to immediately confront the most anxiety- provoking situation (flooding). Discussion: LEARNING THEORY & BEHAVIORAL THERAPY# Goals = change behavior & think more accurately# Specific phobia: ex. dogs, flying, heights, snakes- Therapy* Behavioral - Exposure therapy6# Prolonged & frequent (6-10) sessions# Gradual exposure to stimulus# End when anxiety reduced- Learning principles* Conditioning (stimulus elicits maintained response)* Negative reinforcement (behavior repeated to avoid a negative emotion)* Habituation (fear eliminated by prolonged contact w/ phobic stimulus)# Social phobia: ex. public speaking; fear of being scrutinized by others- Therapy* Cognitive - Cognitive restructuring- Correct irrational thinking* Behavioral - Exposure therapy & social skills training# Social distance, eye contact, movement, content- Learning principles* Modeling (observe others)* Shaping (acquire behavior by reinforcement)* Positive reinforcement (behavior? in frequency by reward)* Punishment (behavior? in frequency)* Irrational thinking (inaccurate beliefs that others are scrutinizing)i. Psychoanalysis would also use the understanding of the patient and the recreation of the past through clarification, confrontation, and interpretation, but typically the patient comes to the office more frequently than once per week, and often, though not always, the patient lies on a couch facing away from the therapist. ii. An experiential-humanistic therapist would focus on developing a supportive and gratifying relationship with the patient to help provide the empathic responsiveness that was hypothesized as absent in the patient's past. iii. A cognitive therapy would most likely focus on the negative worldview of the patient and attempt to restructure those thoughts. Cognitive therapy is based on the principle that psychopathology derives from the patient's faulty, distorted beliefs about him- or herself and the world (schemas).",
