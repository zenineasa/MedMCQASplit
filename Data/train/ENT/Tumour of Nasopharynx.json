Nasopharyngeal carcinoma metastasis or direct extension laterally to the parapharyngeal space post styloid compartment leads to the involvement of cervical sympathetic chain which is known as Horner's syndrome. Signs of Horner's syndrome:(Mnemonic: AMPLE)1. Anhidrosis (decreased sweating on the affected side of the face)2. Miosis (small pupils)3. Ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid from loss of sympathetic innervation to the superior tarsal muscle, also known as Muller's muscle)4.
