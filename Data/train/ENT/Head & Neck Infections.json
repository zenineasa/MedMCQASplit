The dangerous triangle of the face or maxillofacial death pyramid (MDP) consists of the area from the corners of the mouth to the bridge of the nose, including the nose and maxilla. Due to the special nature of the blood supply to the human nose and surrounding area, it is possible (although very rare) for retrograde infections from the nasal area to spread to the brain. This is possible because of venous communication (via the ophthalmic veins) between the facial vein and the cavernous sinus.
