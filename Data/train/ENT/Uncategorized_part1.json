Malignant otitis externa (also k/a Necrotizing external otitis) Malignant otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the external ear usually spreading deep to cause osteomyelitis of temporal bone and base of skull. It occurs primarily in immunocompromised persons, especially older persons with diabetes mellitus, and is often initiated by self-inflicted or iatrogenic trauma to the external auditory canal [May also be seen in pts. who received radiotherapy to skull base I The most frequent pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Others may be S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aspergillus, Actinomyces, and some gram-negative bacterial. One of the hallmarkof malignant otitis externs is granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, especially at the hone-cailage junction. As the infection spreads to the temporal bone, it may extend into the cranium and result in cranial nerve palsies (commonly the facial nerve) Cranial nerve involvement indicates poor prognosis. Death is usually due to intracranial complications such as sigmoid sinus thrombosis. It has high moality rate due to which the name 'malignant' is used for this disease. Treatment Includes correction of immunosuppression (when possible), local treatment of the auditory canal, long-term systemic antibiotic therapy, and in selected patients, surgery. - In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. - IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. - For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin (3rd generation-piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e. g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocoticoid is also used. - Early cases can be managed with oral and otic fluoroquinolones only. - Extensive surgical debridement once an impoant pa of the treatment is now rarely needed.",

If the only symptom is a hearing impairment, the chances of improving hearing with surgery should be considered carefully, not just the hearing in the operated ear but the overall hearing ability of the patient.

The underlying principle of FESS is that the sinus mucosa will return to normal if adequate drainage is established. No attempt is made to remove the sinus mucosa; rather, it is allowed to return to normal and to resume its normal function. FESS has greatly reduced the indications for conventional operations like those of Caldwell-Luc, Frontal-sinus operations, and an external ethmoidectomy.",

Veigo (\"a whirling or spinning movement\") It is a type of dizziness, where there is a feeling of motion when one is stationary. The symptoms are due to a dysfunction of the vestibular system in the inner ear. It is often associated with nausea and vomiting as well as difficulties standing or walking. The most common causes are benign paroxysmal positional veigo, concussion and vestibular migraine while less common causes include Meniere's disease and vestibular neuritis. Excessive consumption of ethanol (alcoholic beverages) can also cause notorious symptoms of veigo. A number of conditions that involve the central nervous system may lead to veigo including: migraine headaches, lateral medullary syndrome, multiple sclerosis Veigo is a sensation of spinning while stationary. Repetitive spinning, as in familiar childhood games, can induce sho-lived veigo by disrupting the ineia of the fluid in the vestibular system Veigo is classified into either peripheral or central depending on the location of the dysfunction of the vestibular pathway Peripheral: Veigo caused by problems with the inner ear or vestibular system is called \"peripheral\", \"otologic\" or \"vestibular\". - The most common cause is benign paroxysmal positional veigo (BPPV) but other causes include Meniere's disease, superior canal dehiscence syndrome, labyrinthitis and visual veigo. - Any cause of inflammation such as common cold, influenza, and bacterial infections may cause transient veigo if they involve the inner ear, as may chemical insults (e. g., aminoglycosides) or physical trauma (e. g., skull fractures). - Motion sickness is sometimes classified as a cause of peripheral veigo. Central: If veigo arises from the balance centers of the brain, it is usually milder, and has accompanying neurologic deficits, such as slurred speech, double vision or pathologic nystagmus. - Brain pathology can cause a sensation of disequilibrium which is an off-balance sensation.",

The disorder typically progeses to asthma, then polyposis, with aspirin sensitivity coming last. The aspirin reaction can be severe, including an asthma attack, anaphylaxis, and uicaria in some cases. Patients typically react to other NSAIDS such as ibuprofen, although paracetamol is generally considered safe.

Cochlear implants can be implanted in children at 12 months of age, rather early implantation gives better results. (Dhingra 5th/ed p 139), 6th led p 125\"The timing of implantation is very impoant. Earlier implantation in children generally yields more orable results and many centers roultinely implant children under 12 months of age:'So friends-Option b-C/I in children < 5 years of age is incorrect. Approach for cochlear implants is facial recess, where a simple coical mastoidectomy is done first and sho process of incus and lateral semicircular canal is identified. The facial recess is operated by performing a posterior tymparotomy. A cochleostomy is then done inferior to round window (Not oval window) with the goal of affording access to scale tympani (where the electrode has to be placed).

Dysfunction of larynx can lead to aspiration. The primary goal of treatment of aspiration is to separate the upper digestive tract from the upper respiratory tract for a sho period of time or in some cases, permanently. There are 3 broad categories of treatment. Temporary/Adjunct Treatments Medical Therapy - in the form of antibiotics is impoant to prevent aspiration pneumonia. It is impoant to make the patient NPO, to avoid fuher aspiration and to find an alternate feeding route to maintain the patients nutritional status. A nasogastric tube (feeding gastostomy/jejunostomy) is commonly placed, but this may actually increase the aspiration reflux by making the lower esophageal and upper esophageal sphincters incompetent. Vocal cord medialization (by injecting Gel foam) is useful in unilateral paralysis. This is helpful but is rarely curative, if there is a serious aspiration problem. Tracheostomy will often make aspiration worse by preventing laryngeal elevation on swallowing. It does however, allow easy access to the chest for suctioning. Even a cuffed tube doesn't prevent aspiration as secretions pool above the cuff and the seal is never perfect\"- Scotts Brown 7th/ed vol 1 pg. 1278 Definite - Reversible Procedures Endolaryngeal stents: They function like a cork in the bottle. There job is to seal the glottis and therefore thay need to be used in conjunction with a tracheostomy tube. But they are not often used as they are effective only as a sho term solution, plus there is risk of glottic stenosis. Laryngotracheal separation: The procedure involves transecting the cervical trachea and bringing out the lower end as a permanent end stoma But it has disadvantage of sacrificing voice. Alternative procedure is Tracheoesophageal diversion but has higher complication rates. Definite - Irreversible Procedure It includes: Narrow field laryngectomy: it was considered as a gold standard prior to 1970s, when the irreversible procedures like laryngo tracheal separation were not done.

However, they do not have a cuff and cannot produce an airtight seal. Nonmetallic Tracheostomy Tube Can be of cuffed or noncuffed variety, e. g. rubber and PVC tubes. Cuffed Tracheostomy Tubes A cuff is a balloon-like device around the distal end of the tracheostomy tube. Most cuffed tubes now available have low pressure cuffs with a high volume. This significantly reduces the possibility of pressure necrosis and potential stenosis formation. Pediatric tubes do not have a cuffQ. Cuffed tubes are used in situation where positive pressure ventilation is required, or when the airway is at risk from aspiration. (In unconscious patient or when patient is on respiration). The cuff should be deflated every 2 hours for 5 mins to present pressure damage to the trachea. Uncuffed Tracheostomy Tubes As the name suggest, this tube does not have a cuff that can be inflated inside the trachea. It is suitable for a patient who has returned to the ward from a prolonged stay in intensive care and requires physiotherapy and suction via trachea. This type of tube is not suitable for patients who are unable to swallow due to incompetent laryngeal reflexes, and aspiration of oral or gastric contents is likely to occur.

It measures electrical potentials arising in the cochlea and auditory nerve in response to auditory stimuli within first 5 milliseconds. Auditory stimuli are delivered to the cochlea commonly in the form of a wideband click, composed of many frequencies that stimulate the entire cochlea. Cochlear potentials that can be recorded from humans include the cochlear microphonic potentials, the summating potential(SP) and the compound action potential(AP) of the auditory nerve. The SP and AP are the most impoant components of electrocochleography. EcoG is useful: To find threshold of hearing in young infants and children to within 5-10 dB To differentiate lesions of cochlea from those of the VIIIth nerve. Normally the ratio between the amplitude of summating potential to the action potential is less than 30%. An increase in this ratio is indicative of Meniere's disease.",

It is well recognised that glomus tumors arise from paraganglions, which are normally occuring structures usually found in close association with sympathetic ganglions along the aoa and its main branches. The chief cells (paraganglionic cells) of the paraganglions are of neural crest origin and are components of the diffuse neuroendocrine system (DNES). These paraganglionic cells are derived from embryonic neuroepithelium (neural crest). Glomus tumors are also referred to as chemodectomas or nonchromaffin paragangliomas. There are two types of glomus tumors:- Glomus jugulare These glomus tumors arise from the dome of the internal jugular vein in the hypotympanum and jugular foramen. In jugular foramen they can invade IX to XII cranial nerves. Glomus tympanicum They arise from the promontory of the middle ear along the course of the tympanic branch of the IXth cranial nerve. Although rare, glomus tumors are the most common tumor of the middle ear and are second to acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) as the most common tumor of the temporal bone. It is more common in females with female to male ratio of 3-6: 1. Glomus jugulare tumors have also been noted to be more common on the left side, especially in females. o Most tumors occur in patient 40-60 years.

Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cailage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear. Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been repoed. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other pas of the body. Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externa Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor) Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency) C.)

Jugular venous thrombosis Cavernous sinus thrombosis Meningitis Treatment of malignant otitis externa In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin (3\" generation piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e. g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocoicoid is also used.

Hearing loss is conductive and slowly progressive. These are followed by blood stained otorrhoea and earache. Before the tympanic membrane (eardrum) is perforated a red swelling is seen to arise from the floor of middle ear, i. e. \"Rising sun\" appearance. This results in a red reflex through the intact tympanic membrane. Sometimes, eardrum may be bluish and bulging. Pulsation sign (Brown sign) is positive, i. e. when ear canal pressure is raised with Siegle's speculum, tumor pulsates vigorously and then blanches; reverse happens with release of pressure. Aquino sign is positive, i. e. blanching of mass with manual compression of ipsilateral carotid aery. When the tumour perforates the eardrum a polypus will be seen in the meatus and this will bleed profusely if touched. Cranial nerve palsies is a late feature appearing several years after aural symptoms. IX' to XIIth cranial nerves may be paralysed. This can cause dysphagia and hoarseness, and weakness of trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles, unilateral paralysis of soft palate, pharynx and vocal cord. Ausculation with stethoscope over the mastoid may reveal audible systolic bruit. Some glomus tumours secrete catecholamines and produce symptoms like tachycardia, arrhythmias, sweating, flushing and headache etc. Facial palsy may be caused by glomus tympanicum type of glomus tumor.

By creating a small surgical passage just inside the stoma, from the back wall of the trachea into the esophageal wall, a voice prosthesis can be placed into this passage to enable tracheoesophageal speech. Voice is produced by temporarily blocking the stoma so that exhaled air from the lungs can be directed from the trachea through the prosthesis into the esophagus and then out through the mouth. Fluent, conversational speech may be acquired within just a few days.",

Binaural receptive fields (which is a feature of most auditory neurons above the level of cochlear nuclei) contribute to sound localization. In other words, relay nuclei in the brain stem (especially the superior olivary nuclei complex) mediate localization of sound. The auditory system uses following clues to judge the origin of sound:? Time lag between the entry of sound in two ears:- For example, if the sound originates from the right side of a person, it reaches the right ear earlier than the left ear. This time lag is more impoant for relatively low -frequency sounds (below 3000 Hz). Difference in intensities between the sound in the two ears:- It is impoant for sounds of higher frequencies (>3000 Hz).

Therefore, surgery is the mainstay of treatment. Primary aim is removal of disease by mastoidectomy to make ear safe followed by reconstruction of hearing at a later stage. Modified radical mastoidectomy is the surgery of choice. Two types of surgical procedures (mastoidectomy) are done to deal with cholesteatoma:- 1. Canal wall down procedures These leave the mastoid cavity open into the external auditory canal so that the diseased area is fully exteriorized. The commonly used procedures for atticoantral disease are atticotomy, modified radical mastoidectomy and rarely radical mastoidectomy. Modified radical mastoidectomy is the procedure of choice. 2. Canal wall up procedures (coical mastoidectomy) Here disease is removed by combined approach through the meatus and mastoid but retaining the posterior bony meatus wall, thereby avoiding an open mastoid cavity. For reconstruction of hearing mechanism myringoplasty or tympanoplasty can be done at the time of primary surgery or as a second stage procedure.",

In most cases, this pressure seems to be caused by an aery or vein compressing trigeminal nerve. Other causes are tumor, cysts, AV malformation and multiple sclerosis.

Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a benign, but locally aggresive, tumor of nasopharynx seen in prepubeal and adolescent males. It is the most common benign neoplasm of nasopharynx. It is a highly vascular tumor and blood supply of the tumor most commonly arises from the internal maxillary aery. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) occurs almost exclusively in males. Female with Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) should undergo genetic testing. Onset is most commonly in the second decades, the range is 7-19 years. The exact cause is unknown. As the tumour is predominantly seen in adolescent males in the second decade of life, it is thought to be testosterone dependent. Such patients have a hamaomatous nidus of vascular tissue in the nasopharynx and this is activated to form angiofibroma when male sex hormone appears.",
