Malignant otitis externa (also k/a Necrotizing external otitis) Malignant otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the external ear usually spreading deep to cause osteomyelitis of temporal bone and base of skull. It occurs primarily in immunocompromised persons, especially older persons with diabetes mellitus, and is often initiated by self-inflicted or iatrogenic trauma to the external auditory canal [May also be seen in pts. who received radiotherapy to skull base I The most frequent pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Others may be S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aspergillus, Actinomyces, and some gram-negative bacterial. One of the hallmarkof malignant otitis externs is granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, especially at the hone-cailage junction. As the infection spreads to the temporal bone, it may extend into the cranium and result in cranial nerve palsies (commonly the facial nerve) Cranial nerve involvement indicates poor prognosis. Death is usually due to intracranial complications such as sigmoid sinus thrombosis. It has high moality rate due to which the name 'malignant' is used for this disease. Treatment Includes correction of immunosuppression (when possible), local treatment of the auditory canal, long-term systemic antibiotic therapy, and in selected patients, surgery. - In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. - IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. - For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin (3rd generation-piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e. g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocoticoid is also used. - Early cases can be managed with oral and otic fluoroquinolones only. - Extensive surgical debridement once an impoant pa of the treatment is now rarely needed.",

Bilateral cases occur in 20-30% of patients and 50% of these patients are associated with other congenital anomaly, i. e., CHARGE syndrome -> Coloboma, Heart defects, Choanal atresia, Retarded growth, Genitourinary abnormalies and Ear defects. Diagnosis - Unilateral lesions go unnoticed until the child presents with persistent unilateral nasal discharge. There is the absence of air bubbles in nasal discharge. A simple test for unilateral choanal atresia is to have the child attempt nose blowing with opposite nostril occluded by external pressure.

Barium swallow shows a web in the post-cricoid region and the same can be seen on oesophagoscopy. It is due to subepithelial fibrosis in this region. About 10% of the cases with this syndrome will develop post-cricoid carcinoma. Treatment: Primary treatment is to correct anemia by oral/parenteral iron.

FESS is based on the hypothesis that the osteomeatal complex (maxillary sinus ostium, anterior & middle ethmoid Ostia, frontal recess, infundibulum and middle meatal complex) is the key area in the pathogenesis of chronic sinus disease. Minor pathological changes in the nasal mucosa in the vicinity of the osteomeatal complex may interfere with mucociliary clearance or with the ventilation of maxillary, ethmoid and frontal sinuses. The underlying principle of FESS is that the sinus mucosa will return to normal if adequate drainage is established. No attempt is made to remove the sinus mucosa; rather, it is allowed to return to normal and to resume its normal function. FESS has greatly reduced the indications for conventional operations like those of Caldwell-Luc, Frontal-sinus operations, and an external ethmoidectomy.",

Veigo (\"a whirling or spinning movement\") It is a type of dizziness, where there is a feeling of motion when one is stationary. The symptoms are due to a dysfunction of the vestibular system in the inner ear. It is often associated with nausea and vomiting as well as difficulties standing or walking. The most common causes are benign paroxysmal positional veigo, concussion and vestibular migraine while less common causes include Meniere's disease and vestibular neuritis. Excessive consumption of ethanol (alcoholic beverages) can also cause notorious symptoms of veigo. A number of conditions that involve the central nervous system may lead to veigo including: migraine headaches, lateral medullary syndrome, multiple sclerosis Veigo is a sensation of spinning while stationary. Repetitive spinning, as in familiar childhood games, can induce sho-lived veigo by disrupting the ineia of the fluid in the vestibular system Veigo is classified into either peripheral or central depending on the location of the dysfunction of the vestibular pathway Peripheral: Veigo caused by problems with the inner ear or vestibular system is called \"peripheral\", \"otologic\" or \"vestibular\". - The most common cause is benign paroxysmal positional veigo (BPPV) but other causes include Meniere's disease, superior canal dehiscence syndrome, labyrinthitis and visual veigo. - Any cause of inflammation such as common cold, influenza, and bacterial infections may cause transient veigo if they involve the inner ear, as may chemical insults (e. g., aminoglycosides) or physical trauma (e. g., skull fractures). - Motion sickness is sometimes classified as a cause of peripheral veigo. Central: If veigo arises from the balance centers of the brain, it is usually milder, and has accompanying neurologic deficits, such as slurred speech, double vision or pathologic nystagmus. - Brain pathology can cause a sensation of disequilibrium which is an off-balance sensation.",

        "exp": "Aspiration is the passage of foreign material beyond the vocal cords: The larynx has 3 distinct functions - respiration, phonation and airway protection. Dysfunction of larynx can lead to aspiration. The primary goal of treatment of aspiration is to separate the upper digestive tract from the upper respiratory tract for a sho period of time or in some cases, permanently. There are 3 broad categories of treatment. Temporary/Adjunct Treatments Medical Therapy - in the form of antibiotics is impoant to prevent aspiration pneumonia. It is impoant to make the patient NPO, to avoid fuher aspiration and to find an alternate feeding route to maintain the patients nutritional status. A nasogastric tube (feeding gastostomy/jejunostomy) is commonly placed, but this may actually increase the aspiration reflux by making the lower esophageal and upper esophageal sphincters incompetent. Vocal cord medialization (by injecting Gel foam) is useful in unilateral paralysis. This is helpful but is rarely curative, if there is a serious aspiration problem. Tracheostomy will often make aspiration worse by preventing laryngeal elevation on swallowing. It does however, allow easy access to the chest for suctioning. Even a cuffed tube doesn't prevent aspiration as secretions pool above the cuff and the seal is never perfect\"- Scotts Brown 7th/ed vol 1 pg. 1278 Definite - Reversible Procedures Endolaryngeal stents: They function like a cork in the bottle. There job is to seal the glottis and therefore thay need to be used in conjunction with a tracheostomy tube. But they are not often used as they are effective only as a sho term solution, plus there is risk of glottic stenosis. Laryngotracheal separation: The procedure involves transecting the cervical trachea and bringing out the lower end as a permanent end stoma But it has disadvantage of sacrificing voice. Alternative procedure is Tracheoesophageal diversion but has higher complication rates. Definite - Irreversible Procedure It includes: Narrow field laryngectomy: it was considered as a gold standard prior to 1970s, when the irreversible procedures like laryngo tracheal separation were not done.

Rhinophyma occurs equally in those who do not drink at all and those who drink large quantities of alcohol. It mostly affects men past middle age. Red/pink colour of the tumor is due to engorgment of superficial vessels. Treatment Surgery to reshape the nose is the best known treatment for rhinophyma.

It is well recognised that glomus tumors arise from paraganglions, which are normally occuring structures usually found in close association with sympathetic ganglions along the aoa and its main branches. The chief cells (paraganglionic cells) of the paraganglions are of neural crest origin and are components of the diffuse neuroendocrine system (DNES). These paraganglionic cells are derived from embryonic neuroepithelium (neural crest). Glomus tumors are also referred to as chemodectomas or nonchromaffin paragangliomas. There are two types of glomus tumors:- Glomus jugulare These glomus tumors arise from the dome of the internal jugular vein in the hypotympanum and jugular foramen. In jugular foramen they can invade IX to XII cranial nerves. Glomus tympanicum They arise from the promontory of the middle ear along the course of the tympanic branch of the IXth cranial nerve. Although rare, glomus tumors are the most common tumor of the middle ear and are second to acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) as the most common tumor of the temporal bone. It is more common in females with female to male ratio of 3-6: 1. Glomus jugulare tumors have also been noted to be more common on the left side, especially in females. o Most tumors occur in patient 40-60 years. Multicentric tumors are found in 3-10% of sporadic cases and in 25-50% of familial cases.",

Hearing loss is conductive and slowly progressive. These are followed by blood stained otorrhoea and earache. Before the tympanic membrane (eardrum) is perforated a red swelling is seen to arise from the floor of middle ear, i. e. \"Rising sun\" appearance. This results in a red reflex through the intact tympanic membrane. Sometimes, eardrum may be bluish and bulging. Pulsation sign (Brown sign) is positive, i. e. when ear canal pressure is raised with Siegle's speculum, tumor pulsates vigorously and then blanches; reverse happens with release of pressure. Aquino sign is positive, i. e. blanching of mass with manual compression of ipsilateral carotid aery. When the tumour perforates the eardrum a polypus will be seen in the meatus and this will bleed profusely if touched. Cranial nerve palsies is a late feature appearing several years after aural symptoms. IX' to XIIth cranial nerves may be paralysed. This can cause dysphagia and hoarseness, and weakness of trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles, unilateral paralysis of soft palate, pharynx and vocal cord. Ausculation with stethoscope over the mastoid may reveal audible systolic bruit. Some glomus tumours secrete catecholamines and produce symptoms like tachycardia, arrhythmias, sweating, flushing and headache etc. Facial palsy may be caused by glomus tympanicum type of glomus tumor.

By creating a small surgical passage just inside the stoma, from the back wall of the trachea into the esophageal wall, a voice prosthesis can be placed into this passage to enable tracheoesophageal speech. Voice is produced by temporarily blocking the stoma so that exhaled air from the lungs can be directed from the trachea through the prosthesis into the esophagus and then out through the mouth. Fluent, conversational speech may be acquired within just a few days.",

Binaural receptive fields (which is a feature of most auditory neurons above the level of cochlear nuclei) contribute to sound localization. In other words, relay nuclei in the brain stem (especially the superior olivary nuclei complex) mediate localization of sound. The auditory system uses following clues to judge the origin of sound:? Time lag between the entry of sound in two ears:- For example, if the sound originates from the right side of a person, it reaches the right ear earlier than the left ear. This time lag is more impoant for relatively low -frequency sounds (below 3000 Hz). Difference in intensities between the sound in the two ears:- It is impoant for sounds of higher frequencies (>3000 Hz). Sounds coming from directly in front of the individual and the back of the individual cannot be differentiated by the above two mechanisms.

Same occurs in bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, where the vocal cords are in median or paramedian position -> Voice is less likely to be impaired. Now, the question comes to the mind immediately: - Why the voice is affected in unilateral paralysis, in which the cord is in median or paramedian position. The answer is: - In unilateral vocal cord paralysis, one cord is paralysed and vibrates abnormally or does not vibrate at all, therefore cannot coordinate with the other side (normal) vocal cord.

Conservative Most common site of bleeding is Little's area and most of the time bleeding can be controlled by conservative management which includes: - Nasal pinching: - Pinching of all soft pas of the nose together between thumb and index finger for about 5 minutes can control bleeding most of the time. Trotter's method: - Patient is made to sit, leaning a little forward over a basin to spit any blood and breathe quietly from the mouth. Cold compresses: - Cause vasoconstriction Vasoconstrictor medication on a cotton pledget. Treatment of the etiology: - For example antihypeensives in hypeensive patient. 2. Cauterisation Patient who continues to bleed after properly applied nasal pressure, or a patient with recurrent episodes of bleeding over a period of hours or days, deserve a more definitive procedure. If a presumptive source of bleeding is identified chemical cautery by silver nitrate or coagulation with electrocautery should be considered. 3. Anterior nasal pack Continued epistaxis from an anterior site despite cautery requires placement of anterior nasal pack. 4. Posterior nasal pack The persistent appearance of blood in the hypopharynx with no identifiable anterior source or after placement of an anterior nasal pack indicates posterior site of epistaxis and necessitates placement of posterior nasal pack. 5. Ligation of vessels If bleeding is still continued, surgical ligation of vessels is indicated.",

When higher frequencies are involved, curve becomes flat or a falling type. 3) Speech audiometry Discrimnation score is usually 55-85%. 4) Special audiometry tests Indicate cochlear lesion:- Recruitment test is positive SISI (sho increment sensitivity index) score is better than 70% Tone decay test shows decay of less than 20 dB. 5) Electrocochleography Normally, ratio of summating potential (SP) to action potential (AP) is 30%. In Meniere's disease, SP/AP ratio is greater than 30% and is diagnostic of Meniere's disease. 6) Caloric test It shows reduced response on the affected side. Often, it reveals a canal paresis on the affected side (most common) but sometimes there is directional preponderance to healthy side or a combination of both canal paresis on the affected side and directional preponderance to opposite side. 7) Glycerol test Glycerol reduces endolymphatic pressure due to its dehydrating propey and thus causes an improvement in hearing. 8) Reverse glycerol test Performed by using acetazolamide.

To collect the specimen of the antral contents for culture and sensitivity, or cytological examination to exclude early malignancy. Contraindications Children less than 12 years of age. Acute maxillary sinusitis as it may lead to osteomyelitis Fracture of maxilla as fluid may pass through fracture line. Diabetes hearing it. The examiner then says that he is going to repeat the test, but puts a non-vibrating fork on the mastoid while at the same time bringing a vibrating fork close to the auricle. If the patient is malingering, he will hear the tuning fork through air conduction, but think that it is being heard through the bone. If he is really deaf he will not hear the fork. 3. Lomard's test This depends upon the fact that to the normal man the sound of his own voice is necessary for the proper regulation of its tone and loudness. The Barany noise apparatus is adjusted to the patient's sound ear and its machinery staed in order to accustom him to its grating noise. He is given a book, and told to read aloud in his normal voice and not to stop reading when the instrument is set in action. As soon as the noise begins, a man whose opposite ear is profoundly deaf will at once raise his voice and, if his deafness is absolute, may literally shout. The malingerer, on the other hand, claiming a one-sided deafness which is not real will continue to read in an even tone or in a tone only slightly elevated. 4. Acoustic reflex (stapedial reflex threshold) If stapedial reflex is present, it rules out NOHL because stapedial reflex is not in voluntary control. 5. Electric response audiometry (ERA) or coical evoked response audiometry It is very useful in NOHL and can establish hearing acuity of the person to within 5-10 dB of actual thresholds. 6.

        "exp": "Surgical treatment of Salivary malignancies The primary treatment of salivary malignancies is surgical excision. In this setting, basic surgical principles include the en bloc removal of the involved gland with preservation of all nerves unless directly invaded by tumor. For parotid tumors that arise in the lateral lobe, superficial parotidectomy with preservation of CN VII is indicated. If the tumor extends into the deep lobe of the parotid, a total parotidectomy with nerve preservation is performed. Although malignant tumors may abut the facial nerve, if a plane of dissection can be developed without leaving gross tumor, it is preferable to preserve the nerve. If the nerve is encased by tumor (or is noted to be nonfunctional preoperatively) and preservation would result leaving gross residual disease, nerve sacrifice should be considered. The removal of submandibular malignancies includes en bloc resection of the gland and submental and submandibular lymph nodes. Radical resection is indicated with tumors that invade the mandible, tongue, or floor of mouth. Therapeutic removal of the regional lymphatics is indicated for clinical adenopathy or when the risk of occult regional metastasis exceeds 20%. High-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas, for example, have a high risk of regional disease and require elective treatment of the regional lymphatics. When gross nerve invasion is found (lingual or hypoglossal), sacrifice of the nerve is indicated with retrograde frozen section biopsies to determine the extent of involvement. If the nerve is invaded at the level of the skull base foramina, a surgical clip may be left in place to mark the area for inclusion in postoperative radiation fields. The presence of skip metastases in the nerve with adenoid cystic carcinoma makes recurrence common with this pathology. Postoperative radiation treatment plays an impoant role in the treatment of salivary malignancies. The presence of extraglandular disease, perineural invasion, direct invasion of regional structures, regional metastasis, and high-grade histology are all indications for radiation treatment.",

The etiological agent is Rhinosporidium seeberi. Rhinosporidium seeberi is an aquatic bacterium (not a fungus). Infection usually results from a local traumatic inoculation with the organism. It is seen in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In India, most of the cases are seen in Southern states. Infection of the nose and nasopharynx is observed in 70% of persons with rhinosporidiosis; infection of palpebral conjunctiva or associated structures (including lacrimal apparatus) is observed in 15% of cases. Other structures of the mouth and upper airway may be sites of disease. Disease of the skin, ear, genitals and rectum has also been described. Rhinosporidiosis is an infection that typically limited to the mucosal epithelium. The disease progress with local replication of R seeberi and associated hyperplastic growth of host tissue and a localized immune response. Clinical features of Rhinosporidiosis Rhinosporidiosis presents as soft leafy polypoidal mass (soft polyp), which is pink to purple in colour studded with white dots, i. e. strawberry appearance. This appearance results from sporangia, which is visible as grey or yellow spots in the vascular polypoid masses. Because the polyps are vascular and friable, they bleed easily upon manipulation. Treatment The treatment of choice is surgical excision. Complete excision of mass is done with diathermy knife and cauterization of base. Dapsone is being tried for treating rhinosporidiosis but with limited success.",

Hearing aids These are miniaturized sound amplifying devices to amplify sounds reaching the ear. These devices contain a microphone to recieve sound, an electronic processor (amplifier) that manipulates the qualities of sound to make it more usable to listner, a speaker (receiver) that conves electrical impulses back to the sound. Hearing Aids may be of two types:? Air conduction hearing aid: - In this, the amplified sound is transmitted the ear canal to the tympanic membrane. Bone conduction hearing aid: - Instead of a receiver, it has a bone vibrator which snugly fits on the mastoid and directly stimulates the cochla. This type of aid is specially useful in persons with actively draining ears, otitis externa or atresia of the ear canal when ear-inses cannot be worn. Hearing aid is indicated in persons who has a hearing problem that cannot be helped by medical or surgical means. 2. Implants Two commonly used Implants are:? A. Cochlear implants Cochlear implants bypass the function of the sensory receptors by directly stimulating ganglion cells in the auditory nerve. Cochlear implants conve the mechanical sound energies into the electrical signals that can be directly delivered into the auditory nerve in severe or profoundly hearing impaired individuals. Cochlear implant has two components: External component: - It contains microphone, speech processor and transmitter, and remains outside the body. Internal component: - It contains receiver/stimulater which is implanted under the skin and electrode which is implanted in the Scala tympani of the cochlea a cochleastomy opening in the basal turn of cochlea. It may also be placed at other locations like promontory or round window but these sites has poorer performance. B. Auditory brainstem implant The cochlear nucleus complex within the brainstem is stimulated directly by placing the electrode into the lateral recess of fouh ventricle. Such implant is used when V///'h cranial nerve has been severed in surgery of acoustic neuroma. Cochlear implants are not effective in this situation.",

However several risk factors have been associated and therefore it is seen more commonly in people working in hardwood furniture industry, nickel refining, leather work, and manufacturer of mustard gas. More than 80% of the malignant tumours are of squamous cell variety. Rest are adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, melanoma, and various type of sarcomas. Workers of furniture industry develop adenocarcinoma of the Ethmoids and upper nasal cavity. While those engaged in Nickel refining get squamous cell and Anaplastic carcinoma. Clinical features for maxillary carcinoma It is seen more commonly in the 7th decade of life. Males are affected more commonly than females. Early features of maxillary sinus malignancy are nasal stuffiness, blood-stained nasal discharge, facial paraesthesias or pain and epiphora. These symptoms may be missed or simply treated as sinusitis. Late features will depend on the direction of spread and extent of growth. Medial spread to nasal cavity gives rise to nasal obstruction, discharge and epistaxis. It may also spread into anterior and posterior ethmoid sinuses and that is why most antral malignancies are antroethmoidal in nature. Anterior spread causes swelling of cheeks. Inferior spread leads to expansion of alveolus with dental pain, loosening of teeth, poor fitting dentures, ulceration of gingiva. Superior spread invades the orbit causing proptosis, diplopia, ocular pain and epiphora. Posterior spread is into pterygomaxillary fossa, pterygoid plate and the pterygoid muscles causing trismus. Lymphatic spread in maxillary carcinoma is rare and occurs only in the late stages. Most commonly involved lymph node is submandibular lymph node followed by jugular nodes. Treatment of maxillary carcinoma For squamous cell carcinoma, the treatment of choice is a combination of radiotherapy and surgery. Radiotherapy can be given before or after surgery. Very often, a full course of pre-operative telecobalt therapy is given, followed 4 - 6 weeks later by surgical excision of the growth by total or extended maxillectomy.",

Olfactory dysfunction is associated with early Parkinson disease and with other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease and Huntington chorea. An association also exists between abnormal olfactory identification and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Head trauma leading to fracture of the cribriform plate may cause cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea and a potential for meningitis. Paranasal sinus endoscopy may lead to violation of the cribriform plate and potential infectious complications.

Caloric test evaluates the integrity of lateral (horizontal) semicircular canals and their afferent pathways. o The veigo produced by caloric test is compared with veigo experienced by the patient during the clinical episode of veigo and if both are qualitatively same, it suggests labyrinthine origin of veigo. Nystagmus produced by caloric test has both fast and slow component because caloric test stimulates vestibular system and vestibular nystagmus has a slow and a fast component. In caloric test one ear is tested at one time and the principle advantage of the test lies in the ability of an investigator to evaluate selectively the physiological integrity of a patient's left or ight horizontal semicircular canal separately.

        "exp": "CSF rhinorrhea may be classified as: Traumatic (>90%) - Approximately 80% of all traumatic leaks occur in the setting of accidental trauma, and the remaining traumatic leaks occur after neurosurgical and rhinological procedures Nontraumatic (Nontraumatic etiologies include neoplasms and hydrocephalus High pressure flow- intracranial tumours & hydrocephalous Low pressure flow- congenital defects Most common site for leak is through cribform plate and ethmoidal air sinuses. Less common sites are through frontal and sphenoidal sinuses. Rarely, the leak can originate in the middle or posterior cranial fossa and can reach the nasal cavity by way of the middle ear and eustachian tube Diagnosis: Basic clinical tests - Rhinoscopy-visualisation of CSF leakage from paranasal sinuses - Tissue test-unlike nasal mucous, CSFdoes not cause a tissue to stiffen - Filter paper test-sample of nasal discharge on a filter paper exhibits a light CSF border and a dark central area of blood 'double ring sign' or ' halo sign' (in cases of traumatic CSF leak where blood and CSF are mixed.) - Queckenstedt test-compression of jugular veins leads to increased CSF leakage d/t increase in 1. CP Biochemical tests: - Concentrations of glucose & protein are higher in CSF than in nasal discharge. - 12-transferrin is the preferred biochemical marker of CSF. It helps in distinguishing CSF from other nasal secretions. - Beta-trace protein (11. TP) is another chemical marker that could be used for the detection of CSF CSF tracers: Intrathecal fluorescein dye administration, radionuclide cisternography, CTcisternography Radiological studies: High-resolution CT provides detailed information about the bony skull base anatomy, and MR1 assesses soft tissues, including unrecognized tumors and coincidental meningoencephaloceles Treatment: Traumatic rhinorrhea often stops spontaneously Conservative treatment consists of 1-2 weeks trial of? - Strict bed rest - Head elevation - Stool softeners - Advising patient to avoid coughing, sneezing, nose blowing, and straining - Prophylactic antibiotics - Subarachnoid drainage through a lumbar catheter Surgical repair is generally advocated in patients with large fistulas especially in the presence of pneurnocephalous.",

Tinnitus:- More common in cochlear otosclerosis. Speech:- Monotonous, well modulated soft speech. Veigo:- is uncommon. Signs in otosclerosis Tympanic membrane is quite normal and mobile. In 10% of cases flamingo - pink blush is seen through the tympanic membrane called as Schwaze sign. Various tests show conductive hearing loss. Tuning fork tests in otosclerosis As otosclerotic patients have conductive deafness, the tuning fork tests results will be as follows:? Rinnes:- Negative Webers:- Lateralized to the ear with greater conductive loss. Absolute bone conduction (ABC):- Normal (can be decreased in cochlear otosclerosis). Gelles test:- No change in the hearing through bone conduction when air pressure of ear canal is increased by Siegle's speculum. Audiometry in otosclerosis Audiometry is one of the impoant tools in evaluation of a patient of otosclerosis. Various audiometric tests are:? 1. Pure tone audiometry Shows loss of air conduction, more for lower frequencies with characteristic rising pattern. Bone conduction is normal. However in some cases, there is a dip in bone conduction curve which is maximum at 2000 Hz (2 KHz) and is called the Carha's notch. 2. Impedance audiometry Impedance audiometry shows:- Tympanometry Patient with early disease may show type A tympanogram (because middle ear areation is not affected) Progressive stapes fixation results in classical As type tympanogram. Acoustic (stapedial reflex) It is one of the earliest sign of otosclerosis and preceedes the development of airbone gap. In early stage, diphasic on-off pattern is seen in which there is a brief increase in compliance at the onset and at the termination of stimulus occurs. This is pathognomonic of otosclerosis.

Veigo (\"a whirling or spinning movement\") It is a type of dizziness, where there is a feeling of motion when one is stationary. The symptoms are due to a dysfunction of the vestibular system in the inner ear. It is often associated with nausea and vomiting as well as difficulties standing or walking. The most common causes are benign paroxysmal positional veigo, concussion and vestibular migraine while less common causes include Meniere's disease and vestibular neuritis. Excessive consumption of ethanol (alcoholic beverages) can also cause notorious symptoms of veigo. A number of conditions that involve the central nervous system may lead to veigo including: migraine headaches, lateral medullary syndrome, multiple sclerosis Veigo is a sensation of spinning while stationary. Repetitive spinning, as in familiar childhood games, can induce sho-lived veigo by disrupting the ineia of the fluid in the vestibular system Veigo is classified into either peripheral or central depending on the location of the dysfunction of the vestibular pathway Peripheral: Veigo caused by problems with the inner ear or vestibular system is called \"peripheral\", \"otologic\" or \"vestibular\". - The most common cause is benign paroxysmal positional veigo (BPPV) but other causes include Meniere's disease, superior canal dehiscence syndrome, labyrinthitis and visual veigo. - Any cause of inflammation such as common cold, influenza, and bacterial infections may cause transient veigo if they involve the inner ear, as may chemical insults (e. g., aminoglycosides) or physical trauma (e. g., skull fractures). - Motion sickness is sometimes classified as a cause of peripheral veigo. Central: If veigo arises from the balance centers of the brain, it is usually milder, and has accompanying neurologic deficits, such as slurred speech, double vision or pathologic nystagmus. - Brain pathology can cause a sensation of disequilibrium which is an off-balance sensation.",

Most common fungal infection of paranasal sinus is Aspergillus (A fumigatus > A niger > A flavus). Other offending fungi are Alternaria, Mucor and Rhizopus. Types of fungal sinusitis There are four types of fungal sinusitis:? 1. Mycetoma fungal sinusitis (fungal ball):- Produces clumps of spores, a \"fungal ball\", within a sinus cavity, most frequently in maxillary sinus. The patient maintains an effective immune system. The non-invasive nature of this disorder requires a treatment consisting of simple scraping of infected sinus. An anti fungal therapy is generally not prescribed. 2. Allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS):- It is a non-invasive condition which is believed to be an allergic reaction to the environmental fungi that is finely dispersed into the air. Patient is usually immunocompetent with normal immune system. Treatment consists of endoscopic surgical clearance of the sinus along with pre-and postoperative systemic steroids. Anti-inflammatory medical therapy and immunotherapy are typically prescribed to prevent recurrence. 3. Chronic indolent invasive sinusitis:- It is an invasive form of fungal sinusitis in immunocompetant patients. This is characterized by a granulomatous inflammatory infiltrates. Treatment consists of surgical removal of the involved mucosa, bone and soft tissue followed by iv amphotericin B. 4. Acute fulminant sinusitis:- It is usually seen in the immunocompromized patients. This disease leads to progressive destruction of the sinuses and can invade the bony cavities containing the eyeball and brain.

In adults, tonsillitis does not occur usually (tonsillitis occurs usually in children). Thus, in adults it is due to tooth infection or extraction. Parapharvngeal abscess Parapharyngeal space As the name suggests, parapharyngeal space, it is the space on both side of the pharynx, i. e. lateral to the pharynx - lateral pharyngeal space. It is also known as pharyngomaxillary space. It is pyramidal in shape with base at the base of skull and apex at the hyoid bone. Relations Medial: Buccopharyngeal fascia covering the constrictor muscles. Posterior: Preveebral fascia covering preveebral muscles and transverse processes of cervical veebrae. Lateral: Medial pterygoid muscle, mandible and deep surface of parotid gland. Divisions of parapharyngeal space Styloid process and the muscles attached to it divide the parapharyngeal space into anterior and posterior compaments. Anterior compament is related to tonsillar fossa medially and medial pterygoid muscle laterally. Posterior compament is related to posterior pa of lateral pharyngeal wall medially and parotid gland laterally. Through the posterior compament pass the carotid aery, jugular vein, IV, Xth, XIth, XII\" cranial nerves and sympathetic trunk. Clinical features of parapharyngeal abscess This is rare site to get infection. Sixty per cent of patients develop it as a complication of tonsillitis or tonsillectomy and 40 per cent as a result of either infection or extraction of lower third molar tooth. Mastoid infection can extend into the space on rare occasions. There is fever and marked trismus because of spasm in medial pterygoid muscle. The tonsil, if it is normal, is pushed medially. The most marked swelling is in the neck at the posterior pa of the middle third of the sternomastoid (behind the angle ofjaw). There may also be swelling in retromolar area. There is toicollis (due to spasm of preveebral muscles), sore throat, marked odynophagia and signs of toxemia.

It is an objective test and can be done under sedation. It is used both as a screening test and as a definative hearing assessment test in children. Best test to detect deafness in infants (reliably recorded even from premature infants of 30 weeks gestational age) and mentally retarded or malingering subjects. It is also used for Identification of the site of lesion in Retrocochlear pathologies and to diagnose brainstem pathology e. g. multiple sclerosis or pontine tumor.

Generally occurs in young age group (children and young adults) and is more common in male. Exact etiology is not known, However sinus infection has been incriminated (in contrast to ethmoidal polyp, which is considered as allergic). Clinical features of antrochoanal polyp Unilateral Nasal blockage (more on expiration than on inspiration) Obstruction may become bilateral when polyp grows into nasopharynx and stas obstructing opposite choana. Hyponasal voice Mucoid nasal discharge Conductive deafness due to eustachian tube dysfunction On examination, polyp may not be visible on anterior rhinoscopy as it grows posteriorly On posterior rhinoscopy - smooth, greyish white, spherical mass is seen in choana. Treatment of antrochoanal polyp There is no medical treatment for antrochoanal polyp. The treatment of choice is complete surgical removal of polyp along with removal of lining of maxillary sinus to prevent the recurrence. Surgeries for antrochoanal polyp include:? 1) Avulsion of a polyp The stalk of the polyp is grasped and gently moved around to tease out the antral lining. Most of the time, avulsion fails to remove the polyp and antral lining completely. 2) Intranasal polypectomy It was the treatment of choice for all age groups prior to the advent of endoscopic sinus surgery and is still the treatment of choice in those setups where endoscopic surgery is not practised. 3) Caldwell Luc operation It is indicated if there is a recurrence and the age of the patient is more than 17 years.

Sound produced by outer hair cells travels in a reverse direction: Outer hair cells basilar membrane - Perilymph Oval window Ossicles - Tympanic membrane Ear canal. OAEs are present when outer hair cells are healthy and are absent when they are damaged and thus help to test the function of cochlea. Types of OAEs OAEs are two types: - Spontaneous OAEs: - They are present in healthy normal hearing persons where hearing loss does not exceed 30 dB. They may be absent in 50% of normal persons. Evoked OAEs: - There are produced by sound stimulus and they are subdivided into two types depending on the sound stimulus used to elicit them:- Transient evoked OAEs (TEOAEs):- Evoked by click. Distoion product OAEs (DPOAEs):- Two tones are simultaneously presented to the cochlea to produce distoion products. OAEs are absent in 50% of normal individuals, lesions of cochlea, middle ear disorders (as sound travelling in reverse direction cannot be picked up) and when hearing loss exceeds 30 dB. Uses of otoacoustic emissions OAEs are used as a screening test of hearing in neonate and to test hearing in uncooperative or mentally challenged individuals after sedation. Sedation does not interfere with OAEs. They help to distinguish cochlear from retrocochlear hearing loss. OAEs are absent in cochlear lesions, e. g. ototoxic sensorineural hearing loss. They detect ototoxic effects earlier than pure-tone audiometry. OAEs are also useful to diagnose retrocochlear pathology, especially auditory neuropathy. Auditory neuropathy is a neurologic disorder of CN VIII. Audiometric tests, e. g. SNHL for pure tones, impaired speech discrimination score, absent or abnormal auditory brainstem response, show a retrocochlear type of lesion but OAEs are normal.",

May occasionally follow superficial parotidectomy. Clinical features: There is flushing and sweating of the skin innervated by the auriculotemporal nerve paicularly during meal and presence of cutaneous hyperaesthesia in front and above (the ear the area supplied by the auriculotemporal nerve.) - The postganglionic parasympathetic fibres become united to the sympathetic nerves from the superior cervical ganglion which are concerned to supply vessels and sweat glands of that region. This causes flushing and sweating of the skin. Following injury to the auriculotemporal nerve, postganglionic parasympathetic fibres from the otic ganglion grow down the sheaths of the cutaneous filaments, so hyperaesthesia follows stimulation of the secretomotor nerves.
