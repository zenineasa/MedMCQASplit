Typical finding is the presence of a black necrotic mass filling the nasal cavity and eroding the septum and hard palate. Special stains help to identify the fungus in tissue sections. Treatment is by amphotericin B and surgical debridement of the affected tissues and control of underlying predisposing cause. Ref: Dhingra 7e pg 178.",

Its surface is studded with white dots representing the sporangia of fungus. In early stages, the patient may complain of nasal discharge which is often blood tinged and nasal stuffiness. Sometimes, frank epistaxis is the only presenting complaint. Diagnosis: This is made by biopsy. It shows several sporangia, oval or round in shape and filled with spores which may be seen bursting through its chitinous wall. It has not been possible to culture the organism or transfers the disease to experimental animals. Treatment: Complete excision of the mass with diathermy knife and cauterization of its base.

Local recurrences after surgical excision are common and can occur as late as 10-20 years after surgery. Distant metastases go to the lung, brain and bone. Treatment is radical parotidectomy with largest cuff of grossly normal tissue around the boundaries of the tumour. Radical neck is not done unless nodal metastases are present.

Isolated fractures of orbital floor, when a large blunt object strikes the globes, are called \"blow out fractures. \" Orbital contents may herniate into the antrum. CLINICAL FEATURES 1. Ecchymosis of lid, conjunctiva and sclera. 2. Enophthalmos with inferior displacement of the eyeball. This becomes apparent when oedema subsides. 3. Diplopia, which may be due to displacement of the eyeball or entrapment of inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles. 4. Hypoaesthesia or anaesthesia of cheek and upper lip, if infraorbital nerve is involved. DIAGNOSIS Waters' view shows a convex opacity bulging into the antrum from above (tear-drop opacity). CT scans may confirm the Diagnosis. Entrapment of inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles is diagnosed by asking the patient to look up and down, or by the traction test. The latter is performed by grasping the globe and passively rotating it to check for restriction of its movements. TREATMENT Indications for surgery include enophthalmos and persistent diplopia due to entrapment of muscle. Orbital floor fractures can be satisfactorily reduced by a finger passed into the antrum through a transantral approach. A pack can be kept in the antrum to suppo the fragments. Infraorbital approach, through a skin crease of the lower lid, can also be used either alone or in combination with transantral approach. Badly comminuted fractures of orbital floor can be repaired by a bone graft from the iliac crest, nasal septum or the anterior wall of the antrum. Silicon or teflon sheets have also been used to reconstruct the orbital floor but autogenous grafts are preferable. Ref: Diseases of ENT by Dhingra 6th edition Pgno: 184",
