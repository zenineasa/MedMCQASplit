        "exp": "Rhinosporidiosis. It is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi and affects both man and animals. The disease mostly affects nose and nasopharynx. The disease is acquired through the contaminated water of ponds also frequented by animals. In the nose, the disease presents as a leafy, polypoidal mass, pink to purple in color and attached to the nasal septum or lateral wall. The mass is very vascular and bleeds easily on touch. Its surface is studded with white dots representing the sporangia of fungus. In early stages, the patient may complain of nasal discharge which is often blood tinged and nasal stuffiness. Sometimes, frank epistaxis is the only presenting complaint. Diagnosis: This is made by biopsy. It shows several sporangia, oval or round in shape and filled with spores which may be seen bursting through its chitinous wall. It has not been possible to culture the organism or transfers the disease to experimental animals. Treatment: Complete excision of the mass with diathermy knife and cauterization of its base. Recurrence may occur after surgical excision. Not many drugs are effective against the disease. Dapsone has been tried with some success. Ref: Dhingra; 6th ed; Pg: 159",

Isolated fractures of orbital floor, when a large blunt object strikes the globes, are called \"blow out fractures. \" Orbital contents may herniate into the antrum. CLINICAL FEATURES 1. Ecchymosis of lid, conjunctiva and sclera. 2. Enophthalmos with inferior displacement of the eyeball. This becomes apparent when oedema subsides. 3. Diplopia, which may be due to displacement of the eyeball or entrapment of inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles. 4. Hypoaesthesia or anaesthesia of cheek and upper lip, if infraorbital nerve is involved. DIAGNOSIS Waters' view shows a convex opacity bulging into the antrum from above (tear-drop opacity). CT scans may confirm the Diagnosis. Entrapment of inferior rectus and inferior oblique muscles is diagnosed by asking the patient to look up and down, or by the traction test. The latter is performed by grasping the globe and passively rotating it to check for restriction of its movements. TREATMENT Indications for surgery include enophthalmos and persistent diplopia due to entrapment of muscle. Orbital floor fractures can be satisfactorily reduced by a finger passed into the antrum through a transantral approach. A pack can be kept in the antrum to suppo the fragments. Infraorbital approach, through a skin crease of the lower lid, can also be used either alone or in combination with transantral approach. Badly comminuted fractures of orbital floor can be repaired by a bone graft from the iliac crest, nasal septum or the anterior wall of the antrum. Silicon or teflon sheets have also been used to reconstruct the orbital floor but autogenous grafts are preferable. Ref: Diseases of ENT by Dhingra 6th edition Pgno: 184",
