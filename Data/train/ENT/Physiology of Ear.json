Explanation: There exists a potential difference approx (125mv) between the K+ rich endolymph (+80mv) and the inner hair cells (-45mv). When the ion channels of the hair cells open, K+ is driven into the hair cells because of this potential difference and causes depolarization. This mechanism helps covert the mechanical energy of sound into electrical impulses. This gradient and energy for transduction is provided by the Na+/K+ ATPase pump in the stria vascularis.",
