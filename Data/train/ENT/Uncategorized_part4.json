A: Young Males Nasopharyngeal fibroma/ juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is seen almost exclusively in males in the age group of 10-20 years Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (also called juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma) It is a histologically benign but locally aggressive vascular tumor that grows in the back of the nasal cavity. It most commonly affects adolescent males. Patients with nasopharyngeal angiofibroma usually present with one-sided nasal obstruction and recurrent bleeding. Frequent chronic epistaxis (Nose-Bleeds) or blood-tinged nasal discharge Nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea Conductive hearing loss from eustachian-tube obstruction Diplopia, which occurs secondary to erosion into the cranial cavity and pressure on the optic chiasma If nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is suspected based on physical exam (a smooth submucosal mass in the posterior nasal cavity), imaging studies such as CT or MRI should be performed. Biopsy can lead to extensive bleeding since the tumor is composed of blood vessels without a muscular coat. Differential diagnosis Antro-choanal polyp (benign neoplasm) Rhinosporidiosis (as bleeding point is here too) Malignancy - nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lymphoma, plasmacytoma, rhabdomyosarcoma Chordoma Nasopharyngeal cyst Pyogenic granuloma Treatment Medical treatment is usually given before surgery to reduce the blood loss - includes the usage of Diethylstilbestrol 2-3 weeks before surgery to make the surgery less vascular. Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is sometimes treated by surgery. Pre-surgery angiography may allow for embolization, reducing intraoperative blood loss. Hypotensive Anaesthesia is the usual modality followed to reduce blood loss. Patients with tumors that have extended into the cranial cavity or whose tumors can't be safely reached by surgery may receive radiation therapy. Also Radiation therapy helps in case where recurrence is the main problem. Endoscopy has recently been used in patients with tumors of limited extension that have been pre-operatively embolized.",

The symptoms usually occur several months or even years after parotid surgery. The likely pathophysiology is aberrant regeneration of postganglionic secretomotor parasympathetic nerve fibres (originating from the otic ganglion) misdirected through several axonal sheaths of post-ganglionic sympathetic fibres feeding the sweat glands. These sympathetic fibres are to the sweat glands of the skin in the dissected field. The frey's syndrome is likely due to injury to auriculotemporal nerve with faulty regeneration, therefore Frey's syndrome is also known as Auriculotemporal syndrome. A variant of Frey's syndrome in which there is gustatory facial flushing but not sweating, occurs following facial paralysis due to faulty regeneration following injury to the facial nerve.

' Management of Nasal Foreign Body Before you sta, make sure you have the correct equipment and that the child is being adequately held, in an accommodating position. Fewer attempts will reduce the anxiety of the parent and child. Use topical anaesthetic and vasoconstrictor (reduces swelling) spray in the affected nostril. Blow positive pressure through the nose - preferably by the parent blowing sharply through the child's mouth whilst obstructing the unaffected nostril. This has been shown to be relatively non-traumatic, with success rates of 79% Use a nasal speculum and a hook or thin forceps, to hold object. Be careful not to push the FB fuher back Application of strong suction is sometimes sufficient to draw the object out. Pass a narrow balloon catheter past the FB, inflate and remove the catheter, pulling the FB with it. The Fogay is preferred (compared to a Foley), as it is stiffer and stronger.

This occurs because occlusion of ear canal prevents ambient noise (opposing background noise) to enter through air conduction route.

Another name for leukoplakia is hyperkeratosis dyskeratosis Smoking is a predisposing factor, not a premalignant condition. y In some cases of chronic laryngitis, the laryngeal mucosa becomes dysplastic particularly over true vocal folds and is a premalignant condition. Chronic inflammatory conditions of larynx like chronic laryngitis may develop into malignancy. Keratosis of larynx/leukoplakia:- It is epithelial hyperplasia of the upper surface of one or both vocal cords. Appears as a white plaque or warty growth on cord without affecting its mobility Regarded as a precarcerous condition as Ca in situ develops frequently T/t = stripping of cords",

Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cailage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear. Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been repoed. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other pas of the body. Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externa Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor) Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency) Chemotherapy Clinical features of malignant otitis externa Severe pain:- inside the ear and may get worse when moving head. Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cailagenous pa. Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent. Fever Itching of ear or ear canal Troubled swallowing & weakness of face. Complications Cranial nerve palsies:- most commonly facial nerve is involved. Other cranial nerves can also be involved (glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, abducens, trigeminal). Jugular venous thrombosis Cavernous sinus thrombosis Meningitis Treatment of malignant otitis externa In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin (r generation piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e. g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocoicoid is also used.

The patient is able to stand with feet together and eyes open but sways or falls with eyes closed; it is one of the earliest signs of posterior column disease. - De. Jong's the neurologic examination Proprioceptive pathway: Proprioception is the ability to sense the position of one's extremities without the aid of vision. The peripheral sense organs are located in the muscle, tendons, and joints. The first cell body is situated in the dorsal root ganglion, going without a synapse to the ipsilateral fasiculi cuneatus and gracilis (dorsal column) to the lower medulla where the synapse occurs. Following a decussation of the internal arcuate fibers, the impulses ascend in the medial leminiscus to the thalmus, terminating in the parietal lobe, posterior to those that convey touch. Patholophysiologic basis of Romberg test: Central postural control (equilibrium) is dependent on input from three peripheral modalities: Joint position sense (proprioception), carried in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord; Vision Vestibular apparatus Disturbance in any one of these modalities can be compensated for (completely or incompletely) by input from the other two systems. Impaired proprioception can be over come by visual and vestibular feedback. However, reduced visual input in the dark surroundings or due to failing vision can seriously predispose such a patient to severe incoordination (ataxial) Asking the patient to close his eyes during rombergs test helps uncover any disordered proprioception that may have been masked by vision. Conditions commonly causing a positive Romberg test: Posterior column dysfunction Posterior cord compression Multiple sclerosis Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord Tabes dorsalis Sensory polyneuropathy Idiopathic Diabetes mellitus Intracranial lesions Less common Romberg's test is not a test of cerebellar function. Patients with cerebellar ataxia will, generally, be unable to balance even with the eyes open.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., H. influnzae Epiglottitis It is the inflammation of epiglottis with inflammatory edema of hyopharynx. It is a true medical emergency. H. influenzae is the most common causative organism. Other organisms are Pneumococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, N. meningitidis, Staphylococcus Clinical manifestations Onset is sudden. Symptoms are- fever, dysphagia, drooling, muffled voice, inspiratory retractions, cyanosis and soft stridor. Patients often sit in sniffing dog position. Respiratory arrest may occur. Plain lateral soft tissue radiograph of neck Thickening of the epiglottis - the thumb sign Absence of a deep well defined vallecula - the vallecula sign \"The risk of sudden death for persons is high due to sudden airway obstruction\". Diagnosis of acute epiglottitis In most cases presumptive diagnosis can be made by typical clinical picture of the disease. The definitive diagnosis is made by direct inspection of the epiglottis, a procedure that should be done by an experienced airway specialist under controlled conditions (usually the operating room). The typical findings are cherry-red and swollen epiglottis and arytenoids. In children, the epiglottis can be seen by simple depression of tongue by tongue blade. In older children and adults, indirect or direct laryngoscopy usually is necessory to make a diagnosie\"\". Though the definitive diagnosis requires direct inspection of the epiglottis. Case management should be individualized. In the child with moderate or advanced disease, the clinical diagnosis should be apparent without an intraoral examination. In this situation, intraoral examination should not be performed, but the child should be prepared for the establishment of an airway. This preparation should be rapid but controlled so that intubation can be performed in an operating room. The diagnosis can also be established by the classical appearance on a lateral neck radiograph which shows the thumb sign and vellecula sign. Etiological diagnosis is made by culture of an organism from blood and from the specimen of the surface of epiglottis. Treatment of epiglottitis Once the diagnosis of epiglottitis is made, endotracheal intubation must be performed immediately. After an airway is established, cultures of the blood and epiglottis should be obtained and patient staed on appropriate intravenous antibiotics to cover H. influenzae (Ceftriaxone or equivalent cephalosporins). Ceftriaxone is the treatment of choice for epiglottitis\". Other antibotic options are:- Ampicillin plus sulbactam Cefuroxime Clindamycin Chloramphenicol Cefotaxime Intravenous antibiotics should be continued for 2-3 days, followed by oral antibiotics to complete a 10 days course.",

Primary acquired cholesteatoma There is no history of previous otitis media or a pre-existing perforation. Theories for its genesis are: - Retraction pocket (wittmaack's theory): - It is the most accepted theory. There is invagination of pars flaccida in the form of retraction pocket due to negative pressure in middle ear as a result of Eustachian tube dysfunction. There is in growth (migration) of squamous epithelium from the outer layer of tympanic membrane (outer layer of TM is lined by squamous epithelium) through this retraction pocket. Infection supervenes on the impacted squamous epithelium/keratin. Basal cell hyperplasia (Ruedi's theory): - There is proliferation of the basal layer of pars flaccida induced by subclinical childhood infections. These proliferating basal cells lay down keratinizing squamous epithelium. Squamous metaplasia (Sade's theory): - Pavement epithelium of attic undergoes metaplasia and transforms into squamous epithelium due to subclinical infections. B. Secondary acquired cholesteatoma There is pre-existing perforation in pars tensa. Theories on its genesis include: - Epithelial invasion (Habermann's theory): - The epithelium from the meatus or outer drum surface grows into the middle ear through a pre-existing perforation especially of the marginal type where pa of annulus tympanicus has already been destroyed.

ETIOLOGY OF OTITS MEDIA WITH EFFUSIONMalfunctioning of Eustachian tube (adenoid hyperplasia, chronic rhinitis, sinusitis & tonsillitis, tumors of nasopharynx, cleft palate). Cause of U/L secretory otitis media in an adult is Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. Patients with Wegener's Granulomatosis may present with Secretory Otitis Media. Characteristic triad of Wegener's granutomatosis is vasculitis of the upper respiratory tract (serious otitis media and epistaxis), vasculitis of the lower respiratory tract (hemoptysis) and vasculitis of the kidney (proteinuria). Allergy. Unresolved otitis media. Viral infection - adeno and rhinoviruses. CLINCAL FEATURES OF OTITS MEDIA WITH EFFUSIONSymptoms: Hearing loss (<40. DB). Delayed and defective speech. Mild ear ache. Otoscopy: Dull and opaque tympanic membrane. Intact tympanic membrane. Colour may be Yellow/Grey/Blue. Loss of light reflex. Thin leash of blood vessels seen along the handle of malleus (less marked than ASOM). Retracted TMBulging of the posterior pa of TMFluid level and air bubbles seen. Mobility restricted. Tuning fork tests: Conductive deafness of 20-40 d. BImpedance Audiometry: confirmatory test for Secretory Otits Media, Shows Type -B curve. X-ray Mastoid: Clouding of air cells. MANAGEMENT OF OTITS MEDIA WITH EFFUSIONMedical Treatment: Decongestant, Anti allergic, Antibiotics, Middle ear aeration (Valsalva maneuver). Watchful waiting is recommended without immediate use of antibiotics for children with uncomplicated otitis media with effusion. Surgical Treatment: 1. Myringotomy and fluid aspiration: 2 incisions one in the antero inferior and other antero superior quadrant of the TM to aspirate thick glue like secretions. (Beer can principle)2.

The treatment should be urgent mastoid exploration, with decompression of the facial nerve in the fallopain canal. However, the scenario is not the same in ASOM. An acute inflammatory process cannot effectively erode the bony falopian canal within the sho period of time. Hence, the only possibility in a patient with ASOM to develop facial palsy is the presence of a congenitally dehiscent fallopian canal (facial nerve without a bony canal), which is the commonest congenital maliformation of temporal bone. Thus in this case the treatment is myringotomy to relieve pressure on the exposed nerve or sometimes cotical mastoidectomy.",

Surgical decompression Nerve decompression - Surgical management of acute facial nerve palsy is based on the principle that axonal ischemia can be reduced by decompression of nerve segments presumed to be inflamed and entrapped. Nerve decompression is not done in all cases of acute facial palsy. Prerequisite for Nerve decompression (Read very carefully) To identify those patients who may benefit from nerve decompression, electro physiological testing should be done prior to it (Current otolaryngology 3/e, p887) The test done is - Evoked electro myograpy (EEMG). Surgical treatment is offered when evoked response amplitudes are 10% (or less) of the normal side. So now after understanding all this lets see the question once again - It says - a case of bells palsy on steroids, shows no improvement after 2 weeks, next step in management would be - Next step would obviously be electrophysiolgical testing for two reasons: 1. Bells palsy as a rule recovers after 10 days and responds after sterioid, the diagnosis has to reviewed to rule out other causes like herpes zoster oticus (which can be indicated by the pattern of degeneration on electro physiological nerve testing) 2.

There is collection of pus between the capsule of tonsil and the superior constrictor muscle, i. e. in the peritonsillar area. Peritonsillar abscess is a complication of tonsillitis and is most commonly caused by group A beta - hemolytic streptococcus. Clinical features of Quinsy Clinical features are divided into:? General: They are due to septicaemia and resemble any acute infection. They include fever (up to 104degF), chills and rigors, general malaise, body aches, headache, nausea and constipation. Local: Severe pain in throat. Usually unilateral. Odynophagia. It is so marked that the patient cannot even swallow his own saliva which dribbles from the angle of his mouth. Patient is usually dehydrated. Muffled and thick speech, often called \"Hot potato voice\". Foul breath due to sepsis in the oral cavity and poor hygiene. Ipsilateral earache. This is referred pain CN IX which supplies both the tonsil and the ear. Trismus due to spasm of pterygoid muscles which are in close proximity to the superior constrictor. Examination findings The tonsil, pillars and soft palate on the involved side are congested and swollen. Tonsil itself may not appear enlarged as it gets buried in the oedematous pillars. Uvula is swollen and oedematous and pushed to the opposite side. Bulging of the soft palate and anterior pillar above the tonsil. Mucopus may be seen covering the tonsillar region. Cervical lymphadenopathy is commonly seen. This involves jugulodigastric lymph nodes. Toicollis: Patient keeps the neck tilted to the side of abscess. Treatment of peritonsillar abscess IV fluids Antibiotics: High dose penicllin. (iv benzipenicillin) is the DOC. In patients allergic to penicillin erythromycin is the DOC. Incision and drainage per orally, if the abscess does not resolve depite high dose of iv antibiotics Tonsillectomy is done 6 weeks following an attack of quinsy (interval tonsillectomy).",

It is seen in normal person or those having sensorineural deafness. Rinne-negative occurs with a conductive hearing loss - no note is audible at the external meatus (i. e. bone conduction is better than air conduction). A prediction of the air-bone gap can be made if tuning forks of 256, 512 and 1024 are used.

Rarely, trigeminal neuralgia can cause otalgia. Oral cavity carcinoma can also cause referred ear pain this pathway. Via Facial nerve. This can come from the teeth (most commonly the upper molars, when it will be worse when drinking cold fluids), the temporomandibular joint (due to its close relation to the ear canal), or the parotid gland. Via Glossopharyngeal nerve. This comes from the oropharynx, and can be due to pharyngitis or tonsillitis, or to carcinoma of the oropharynx (base of tongue, soft palate, pharyngeal wall, tonsils). Via Vagus nerve. This can arise from the laryngopharynx in carcinoma of this area, or from the esophagus in GERD. Via the second and third spinal segments, C2 and C3. In an adult with chronic ear pain, yet a normal ear on exam, the diagnosis is carcinoma of the head and neck region until proven otherwise.

Medical treatment Prednisolone (steroid) is the drug of choice and is staed at initial visit. Initiation of therapy during first 24 hours of symptom confers a higher likelihood of recovery. Antiviral therapy (Acyclovir) is a newer adjunct in treating acute facial palsy of viral origin (both Bell's palsy and Ramsay hunt syndrome). Most surgeons these days advocate combination of steroids and antiviral drugs. 2. Physical treatment Physical treatment includes: - Eye care: - Aificial tear drops, ocular ointment and use of sunglasses to prevent eye complication due to dry eye. Electric stimulation: - To maintain membrane conductivity and reduce muscle atrophy. If the patient of Bell's palsy is not responding to conservative treatment, electrodiagnostic study (electrophysiological study) should be done. Electrodiagnostic study includes, electromyography (EMG), Electroneurography (ENG), minimal excitibility test and maximal excitibility test. Surgery is reserved for those who meet electrodiagnostic (electrophysiological) study criteria or are worsening on medial treatment. 3. Surgical treatment Nerve decompression relieves pressure on the nerve fibers and thus improves the microcirculation of the nerve. Usually veical and tympanic segments of nerve are decompressed. However, some worker's suggest total decompression including labyrinthine segment. Decompression is done in cases who have a poor prognosis for complete recovery with medical therapy alone or in cases who do not respond to medical therapy after 8-12 weeks.",

This combines with an increase in volume of tinnitus and temporary, albeit significant, hearing loss. Hearing may improve after an attack, but often becomes progressively worse. Nausea, vomiting, and sweating sometimes accompany veigo, but are symptoms of veigo, and not of Meniere's. Fluctuating, progressive, unilateral or bilateral hearing loss, usually in lower frequencies. For some, sounds can appear tinny or distoed, and patients can experience unusual sensitivity to noises. Unilateral or bilateral tinnitus. A sensation of fullness or pressure in one or both ears. Some may have parasitic symptoms, which aren't necessarily symptoms of Meniere's, but rather side effects from other symptoms. Veigo may induce nystagmus, or uncontrollable rhythmical and jerky eye movements, usually in the horizontal plane, reflecting the essential role of non-visual balance in coordinating eye movements. Sudden, severe attacks of dizziness or veigo, known informally as \"drop attacks, \" can cause someone who is standing to suddenly fall Meniere's disease is idiopathic, but it is believed to be linked to endolymphatic hydrops, an excess of fluid in the inner ear. Edolymphatic fluid bursts from its normal channels in the ear and flows into other areas, causing damage. This is called \"hydrops. \" The membranous labyrinth, a system of membranes in the ear, contains a fluid called endolymph. The membranes can become dilated like a balloon when pressure increases and drainage is blocked. This may be related to swelling of the endolymphatic sac or other tissues in the vestibular system of the inner ear, which is responsible for the body's sense of balance. Endolymphatic duct may be obstructed by scar tissue, or may be narrow from bih. In some cases there may be too much fluid secreted by the stria vascularis. The symptoms may occur in the presence of a middle ear infection, head trauma, or an upper respiratory tract infection, or by using aspirin, smoking cigarettes, or drinking alcohol.

Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cailage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear. Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been repoed. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other pas of the body. Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externa Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor) Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency) Chemotherapy Clinical features of malignant otitis externa Severe pain:- inside the ear and may get worse when moving head. Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cailagenous pa. Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent. Fever Itching of ear or ear canal Troubled swallowing & weakness of face. Complications Cranial nerve palsies:- most commonly facial nerve is involved. Other cranial nerves can also be involved (glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, abducens, trigeminal). Jugular venous thrombosis Cavernous sinus thrombosis Meningitis Treatment of malignant otitis externa In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin (3'd generation piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e. g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocoicoid is also used. Early cases can be managed with oral and otic fluoroquinolones only. Extensive surgical debridement once an impoant pa of the treatment is now rarely needed.",

Carhas notch is seen only in bone conduction curve. It disappears after successful stapedectomy/stapedotomy. The reason why it disappears after successful surgery is that when the skull is vibrated by bone--conduction sound, the sound is detected by the cochlea 3 routes:- Route (a)--is by direct vibration within the skull.- Route (b)--is by vibration of the ossicular chain which is suspended within the skull.- Route (c)--is by vibrations emanating into the external auditory canal as sound and being heard by the normal air-conduction route.

There is collection of pus between the capsule of tonsil and the superior constrictor muscle, i. e. in the peritonsillar area. Peritonsillar abscess is a complication of tonsillitis and is most commonly caused by group A beta - hemolytic streptococcus. Clinical features of Quinsy Clinical features are divided into:? 1) General: They are due to septicaemia and resemble any acute infection. They include fever (up to 104degF), chills and rigors, general malaise, body aches, headache, nausea and constipation. 2) Local: Severe pain in throat. Usually unilateral. Odynophagia. It is so marked that the patient cannot even swallow his own saliva which dribbles from the angle of his mouth. Patient is usually dehydrated. Muffled and thick speech, often called \"Hot potato voice\". Foul breath due to sepsis in the oral cavity and poor hygiene. Ipsilateral earache. This is referred pain CN IX which supplies both the tonsil and the ear. Trismus due to spasm of pterygoid muscles which are in close proximity to the superior constrictor. Examination findings The tonsil, pillars and soft palate on the involved side are congested and swollen. Tonsil itself may not appear enlarged as it gets buried in the oedematous pillars. Uvula is swollen and oedematous and pushed to the opposite side. Bulging of the soft palate and anterior pillar above the tonsil. Mucopus may be seen covering the tonsillar region. Cervical lymphadenopathy is commonly seen. This involves jugulodigastric lymph nodes. Toicollis: Patient keeps the neck tilted to the side of abscess. Treatment of peritonsillar abscess IV fluids Antibiotics: High dose penicllin. (iv benzipenicillin) is the DOC. In patients allergic to penicillin erythromycin is the DOC. Incision and drainage per orally, if the abscess does not resolve depite high dose of iv antibiotics. Tonsillectomy is done 6 weeks following an attack of quinsy (interval tonsillectomy).",

The symptoms usually occur several months or even years after parotid surgery. The likely pathophysiology is aberrant regeneration of postganglionic secretomotor parasympathetic nerve fibres (originating from the otic ganglion) misdirected through several axonal sheaths of post-ganglionic sympathetic fibres feeding the sweat glands. These sympathetic fibres are to the sweat glands of the skin in the dissected field. The frey's syndrome is likely due to injury to auriculotemporal nerve with faulty regeneration, therefore Frey's syndrome is also known as Auriculotemporal syndrome. A variant of Frey's syndrome in which there is gustatory facial flushing but not sweating, occurs following facial paralysis due to faulty regeneration following injury to the facial nerve.

It increases labyrinthine blood flow by releasing histamine. Other vasodilators employed include nicotinic acid, thymoxamine, inhaled carbogen (5% CO2 with 95% 02), and histamine drip. Vasodilators increase vascularity of endolymphatic sac and its duct and thereby increases reabsorption of endolymphatic fluid. 4. Diuretics (furosemide) Diuretics with fluid and salt restriction can help to control recurrent attacks if not controlled by vestibular sedatives or vasodilators. 5. Other drugs Propantheline bromide, phenobarbitone and hyoscine are effective alternatives. Surgical management Surgical therapy for meneire's disease is reserved for medical treatment failures and is otherwise controversial. Surgical procedures can be divided into two main categories Destructive surgical procedures Nondestructive surgical procedures Destructive surgical procedures: rationale is to control veigo. Endolymphatic hydrops causes fluid pressure accumulation within the inner ear, which causes temporary malfunction and misfiring of the vestibular nerve. These abnormal signals cause veigo. Destruction of the inner ear and / or the vestibular nerve prevents these abnormal signals. The procedures performed are: Labyrinthectomy Intermittent low pressure pulse therapy (Meniett device therapy) Conservative surgical procedures: are used in cases where veigo is disabling but hearing is still useful & needs to be preserved. They are: Decompression of endolymphatic sac Endolymphatic shunt operation Sacculotomy (Fick's operation & Cody's tack procedure) Vestibular neuronectomy Ultrasonic destruction of vestibular labyrinth to preserve cochlear function.

Fistula Test. The basis of this test is to induce nystagmus by producing pressure changes in the external canal which are then transmitted to the labyrinth. Stimulation of the labyrinth results in nystagmus and veigo. Normally the test is negative because the pressure changes in the EAC cannot be transmitted to the labyrinth. Positive Fistula Test is seen in: Erosion of horizontal semicircular canal (Cholesteatoma or fenestration operation). Abnormal opening in oval window (post stapedectomy fistula) or round window (rupture of round window). A positive fistula test also implies that the labyrinth is still functioning.

This is a congenital malformation involving the first and second branchial arches. The disorder is characterized by abnormalities of the auricular pinna, hypoplasia of facial bones, antimongoloid slanting palpebral fissures with coloboma of the lower eyelids and cleft palate. Impoant clinical findings are:- Antimongoloid palpebral fissures Malformed malleus and incus (normal stapes) Coloboma of lower lid Conductive deafness Hypoplasia of mandible (micrognathia) and molar bones Cleft palate Malformed pinna and meatal atresia It is the most common benign neoplasm of nasopharynx. It is a highly vascular tumor and blood supply of the tumor most commonly arises from the internal maxillary aery. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) occurs almost exclusively in males. Female with Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) should undergo genetic testing. Onset is most commonly in the second decades, the range is 7-19 years. The exact cause is unknown. As the tumour is predominantly seen in adolescent males in the second decade of life, it is thought to be testosterone dependent. The most common site is posterior pa of nasal cavity close to the margin of sphenopalatine foramen. The tumor stas adjacent to the sphenopalatine foramen. Large tumors are frequently bilobed or dumbbel shaped, with one poion of tumor filling the nasopharynx and the other poion extending to the pterygopalatine fossa. Clinical features Symptoms depend on spread of tumour to nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, pterygomaxillary fossa, infratemporal fossa, cheek, orbits (through inferior orbital fissure), cranial cavity (most common site is middle cranial fossa). Nasal obstruction (80-90%) is the most common symptom, especially in the initial stages. This results in denasal speech, hyposmia, broadening of nasal bridge. pontaneous profuse & recurrent epistaxis is the second most common symptom Otalgia, conductive hearing loss, serous otitis media, due to eustachian tube obstruction. Pink or purplish mass obstructing one or both chonae in nasopharynx. Tumour in the orbit causes: proptosis; and frog-face deformity; diplopia and diminshed vision. Tumour in infratemporal fossa can cause trismus and bulge of parotid. II, III, IV, V, VI cranial nerve can be involved. Splaying of nasal bones. Swelling of cheek and fullness of face.

Fodrin (brain spectrin) co-localized with actin in the cuticular plates of both inner and outer hair cells and along the lateral wall of the outer hair cells.
