Tympanometry Is based on the principle of reflection of sound energy when sound strikes tympanic membrane, some of the sound energy is absorbed while the rest is reflected. A stiffer tympanic membrane would reflect more of sound energy than a compliant one. By changing the pressures in a sealed external auditory canal and then measuring the reflected sound energy, it is possible to find the compliance or stiffness of the tympano-ossicular system and thus find the healthy or diseased status of the middle ear. By charting the compliance of tympano-ossicular system against various pressure changes, different types of graphs called tympanograms are obtained. These tympanograms are diagnostic of certain middle ear pathologies. Types of tympanograms Type A Normal tympanogram Type As Reduced compliance at or near ambient air pressure. Seen in fixation of ossicles, eg. otosclerosis or malleus fixation. Type Ad Increased compliance at or near ambient pressure. Seen in ossicular discontinuity or thin and lax tympanic membrane.
