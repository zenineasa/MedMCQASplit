Erosion of medial wall of right orbit can be clearly seen without any invasion into the orbit as Medial Rectus Muscle can be clearly seen with out distoion. ( compare with Left Side) Areas of increased signal intensity are thought to be due to the accumulation of heavy metals such as iron, manganese, and calcium within the inspissated allergic mucin.",
