Generally, atrophic rhinitis refers to primary atrophic rhinitis. Causes are: -Hereditary. Endocrinal pathology - Starts at puberty. Stops after menopauseiii) Racial factors - Seen more in Whites and Yellow racesiv) Nutritional deficiency - Deficiency of vitamin A, D, E and iron may be responsible for it. v) Infective - Klebsiella ozanae, Diphtheriods, P. vulgaris, E. coli, Staphylococci, Streptococci. v) Autoimmune process - Causing destruction of nasal, neurovascular and glandular elements may be the cause. 2) Secondary atrophic rhinitis# Specific infections, such as syphilis, lupus, leprosy, and rhinoscleroma, may cause destruction of the nasal structures leading to atrophic changes. Can also results from long standing purulent sinusitis, radiotherapy of nose, excessive surgical removal of the turbinate and as complication of DNS on the root side of nose. Clinical features of atrophic rhinitiso The disease is mostly seen in females and tends to appear during puberitv. o The disease is always bilateral except in case of DNS where it is seen on the wider side. o There is foul smell from the nose making the patient a social outcast though patient himself is unaware of the smell due to marked anosmia (merciful anosmia). o Patient complains of nasal obstruction inspite of unduly wide nasal chambers. This is due to large crusts filling the nose. o Epistaxis may occur when the crusts are removed, o Crusting may occur in the larynx and cause hoarseness, o Apart from nose, other sites may also be involved. Pharynx - Atrophic phary ngitis may be seenlarynx - Atrophic laryngitis may be seen which can lead to cough and hoarseness of voice.

Epistaxis can be divided into 2 categories, anterior bleed (anterior epistaxis) and posterior bleed (posterior epistaxis), on the basis of the site where the bleeding originates. Anterior epistaxis. Bleeding is from a source anterior to the plane of ihe piriform aperture and blood flows out from the front of nose. More than 90% of bleeds occur anteriorly and arise from little's area, where the Kiesselbach plexus forms on the septum(PGI08. ). Bleeding may also from above the level of middle turbinate or below the level ofmiddle turbinate in anterior part of lateral nasal walk. Anterior bleeding is usually due to trauma, and usually mild which can be controlled by local pressure or nasal pack. It mostly occurs in children or young adult. Posterior epistaxis. Bleeding is from a vessel situated posterior to the piriform aperture and blood usually flows back into the throat. Bleeding is mostly from the posterior superior part of nasal cavity.

Kiesselbach's plexus, which lies in Kiesselbach's area, Kiesselbach's triangle, or Little's area, is a region in the anteroinferior part of the nasal septum where four arteries anastomose to form a vascular plexus of that name. The arteries are:* Anterior ethmoidal artery (from the ophthalmic artery)* Sphenopalatine artery (terminal branch of the maxillary artery)* Greater palatine artery (from the maxillary artery)* Septal branch of the superior labial artery (from the facial artery). Ninety percent of nose bleeds (epistaxis) occur in Little's area, as it is exposed to the drying effect of inspiratory current. The danger triangle of the face consists of the area from the comers of the mouth to the bridge of the nose, including the nose andmaxilla. Due to the special nature of the blood supply to the human nose and surrounding area, it is possible (although very rare) for retrograde infections from the nasal area to spread to the brain. This is possible because of venous communication (via the ophthalmic veins) between the facial vein and the cavernous sinus. The cavernous sinus lies within the cranial cavity, between layers of the meninges and is a major conduit of venous drainage from the brain. It is a common misconception that the veins of the head do not contain one-way valves like other veins of the circulatory system. In fact, it is not the absence of venous valves but the existence of communications between the facial vein and cavernous sinus and the direction of blood flow that is important in the spread of infection from the face. Most people, but not ail, have valves in the veins of the face. Soft triangle is the area of the top of the triangle-shaped nostrils which has no cartilage and only consists of skin. Damaging this area duringincisions on the nose can cause scarring and notching, and should be avoided.

In young patient, nasal polyp is antrochoanal polyp which usually causes unilateral nasal obstruction. Bilateral nasal obstruction is seen in ethmoidal polyp, which occur mostly in adult age. o So, the diagnosis is juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromao Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a benign, but locally aggresive, tumor of nasopharynx seen in prepubertal and adolescent males. o It is the most common benign neoplasm of nasopharynx. o It is a highly vascular tumor and blood supply of the tumor most commonly arises from the internal maxillary artery. o Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) occurs almost exclusively in males. o Female with Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) should undergo genetic testing. o Onset is most commonly in the second decades, the range is 7-19 years. o The exact cause is unknown. As the tumour is predominantly seen in adolescent males in the second decade of life, it is thought to be testosterone dependent. o The most common site is posterior part of nasal cavity close to the margin of sphenopalatine foramen. o The tumor starts adjacent to the sphenopalatine foramen. o Large tumors are frequently bilobed or dumbbel shaped, with one portion of tumor filling the nasopharynx and the other portion extending to the pterygopalatine fossa. Clinical featureso Symptoms depend on spread of tumour to nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, pterygomaxillary fossa, infratemporal fossa, cheek, orbits (through inferior orbital fissure), cranial cavity (most common site is middle cranial fossa). o Nasal obstruction (80-90%) is the most common symptom, especially in the initial stages. This results in denasal speech, hyposmia, broadening of nasal bridge. o Spontaneous profuse & recurrent epistaxis is the second most common symptom o Otalgia, conductive hearing loss, serous otitis media, due to eustachian tube obstruction. o Pink or purplish mass obstructing one or both chonae in nasopharynx. o Tumour in the orbit causes: proptosis; and frog-face deformity; diplopia and diminshed vision. o Tumour in infratemporal fossa can cause trismus and bulge of parotid. o II, III, IV, V, VI cranial nerve can be involved. o Splaying of nasal bones. o Swelling of cheek and fullness of face. Diagnosis and treatment o Contrast CT is the investigation of choice. o Biopsy should be avoided as it can cause severe bleeding. o Surgical excision is the treatment of choice.",

Haller cells are a type of ethmoidal cells which are situated in the roof of maxillary sinus. Sometimes they may enlarge and block the opening of the maxillary sinus leading to maxillary sinusitis. Agger nasi is an elevation just anterior to the attachment of middle turbinate and can contain the agger nasi cell. An enlarged agger nasi cell can block the frontal sinus drainage and lead to frontal sinusitis. Bula ethmoidalis is the ethmoidal cell situated behind the uncinate process and forms the posterior boundary of hiatus semilunaris through which the maxillary, frontal and anterior ethmoidal sinuses drain. Onodi cell is the posterior ethmoidal cell related superiorly or laterally to the sphenoid sinus. The optic nerve lies in its lateral wall and can be injured while operating in this cell.",

In the past, the exact nature of these tumours was suggested by the plain lateral skull radiographic appearance that would show anterior bowing of the posteriorwall of the maxillary sinus. Nowadays, thediagnosis is based on the CT and MR appearances that are sometimes confirmed by angiography. A trans-nasalbiopsy is not necessary and can provoke brisk haemorrhage. The exacc extent or stage of the tumour can only bedetermined by a combination of CT and MR imaging andthis is vital when planning the surgical resection. Juvenile angiofibromas present as well-defined, lobulatedtumours that are covered by nasopharyngeal mucosa. Thetumour consists of proliferating, irregular vascular channels within a fibrous stroma.

Clinical featureso Initial symptoms (3-4 days maggots) Intense irritation, sneezing, headache, blood stained disharge, lacrimation. o Later Maggots may crawl out of nose and there is foul smell. Complicationso Destruction of nose, sinuses, soft tissues of face, palate and eyeball, o Fistulae in nose and palate, o Death occurs due to meningitis.
