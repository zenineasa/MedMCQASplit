This result in mouth breathing. As the respiration and feeding cannot take place simultaneously, child fails to thrive.Other are nasal discharge (wet bubbly nose), sinusitis, epistaxis and toneless voice with loss of nasal quality (Rhinololia clausa).Aural symptomsTubal obstructionOtitis media:- Recurrent acute otitis media, CSOM, serous otitis mediaGeneral symptomsAdenoid facies : Elongated face with dull expression, open mouth, prominent & crowded upper teeth, hitched upper lip, pinched in appearance of nose and high arched palate.Pulmonary hypertension, aprosexia (lack of concentration).o Diagnosis by examination of post nasal space is possible in some children. A rigid or flexible nasopharyngoscope can also be useful in diagnosis. Soft tissue lateral radiograph will reveal size of adenoids and also the extent to which nasopharyngeal air space has been compromised. CT scan has no role in its diagnosis.o When symptoms are not marked breathing excercise, decongenstant nasal drops and antihistaminics are used. When symptoms are marked, adenoidectomy is done.",
