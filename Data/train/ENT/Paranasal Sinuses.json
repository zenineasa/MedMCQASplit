Complications of non-endoscopic drainage procedures can be minor or severe. The most common complication is failure to enter the sinus because of improper positioning of the trocar, incomplete penetration of the sinus mucosa, or the presence of a hypoplastic antrum.

Severe complications include orbital injury, air embolism, and death secondary to injection of air into the sinus.",
