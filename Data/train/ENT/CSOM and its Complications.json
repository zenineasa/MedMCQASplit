        "question": "Unsafe eardrum perforation is",
        "exp": "Ans. b (Marginal) (Ref. Diseases of ENT PL Dhingra 3rd/pg, 91-99). Attic and posterosuperior marginal perforations are seen in dangerous type of CSOM and are often associated with cholesteatoma while central perforation is considered safe, as cholesteatoma is usually not asso with it. OTITIS MEDIA# Tubotympanic disease (central perforation) remains localized to mucosa and that too mostly to anteroinferior part of middle ear cavity.# While atticoantral type or marginal or unsafe otitis media involves posterosuperior part of middle ear cleft (attic, antrum, posterior tympanum and mastoid) and is associated with cholesteatoma, which due to its bone-eroding property causes risk of serious complications and hence called unsafe or dangerous type. Chronic suppurative otitis media. Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is classified into two types: tubotympanic disease, in which there is a perforation of the pars tensa; and atticoantral disease, in which a retraction pocket develops from the pars flaccida. CSOM of the tubotympanic type. CSOM of the tubotympanic type can result from trauma or infection. When perforated the tympanic membrane usually repairs itself, but occasionally the outer layer of the tympanic membrane fuses with inner mucosa and a chronic perforation results. With this type of disease the patient's main symptoms are of an intermittent or chronic mucoid discharge associated with a mild conductive hearing loss. It is rare for this type of disease to be associated with intracranial complications. A diagnosis is made on otoscopy and the tuning forks usually suggest a conductive hearing impairment. The first-line treatment is topical antibiotic and steroid drops, and on occasion microsuction. If medical treatment fails, the patient may request an operation to graft the tympanic membrane in order to give a dry ear. This operation is termed a myringoplasty (type I tympanoplasty). The edges of the perforation are freshened and a small piece of temporalis fascia is inserted under the tympanic membrane to graft the drum. CSOM of the atticotympanic type. CSOM of the atticoantral type is important because of the complications associated with it. Cholesteatoma is the alternative name and means a cyst or sac of squamous epithelium that is present in the attic part of the middle ear. The exact aetiology of cholesteatoma is not known, although poor eustachian tube function is implicated. A retraction pocket develops in the pars flaccida and, if the squamous epithelium cannot migrate out of this pocket, a cholesteatoma results. The expanding ball of skin causes a low-grade osteomyelitis which results in the release of fatty acids from the bone. This gives the discharge its characteristic faecal smell. Invariably the discharge is accompanied by hearing loss and mild discomfort. The infection spreads to the dura via emissary veins which connect the middle ear mucosa to the dura or by direct extension of the disease through the bone. Meningitis, extradural, subdural or intracerebral abscess, or a combination of these may occur. Diagnosis should be suspected on otoscopy. Pus, crusts, granulations or a whitish debris in the attic are hallmarks of the disease. Examination under the microscope, audiometry and, sometimes, HRCT are indicated. The treatment is surgical and follows the principle of exposing the disease, excising the disease and then exteriorising the affected area. Two commonly applied operations for this disease are an atticotomy and a modified radical mastoidectomy.",

Suppurative otitis media is extremely common in childhood and is characterised by purulent fluid in the middle ear. Mastoiditis may be associated with otitis media because the mastoid air cells connect freely with the middle ear space.

It occurs lateral to the cortex of mastoid in Mac. Ewen's triangle. 2) Bezold abscess:- Pus passes through mastoid tip and presents as upper neck swelling. The abscess may:-i) Lies deep to sternocleidomastoidii) Follow the posterior belly of diagastric and presents swelling between mastoid tip and angle of jaw. iii) Be present in posterior triangleiv) Reach the parapharyngeal pouchv) Track down along the carotid vessels. 3) Zygomatic abscess: - Infection of zygomatic air cells. 4) Meatal (Luc9s) abscess:- Pus passes between the antrum and external osseous meatus. 5) Citelli's abscess:- Abscess is formed behind the mastoid more towards occipital bone. Some consider it as abscess of diagastric triangle. 6) Parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal abscess.",

It is an extra cranial complication of CSOM - attico antral type. Pus breaks through the mastoid tip and extends along the sternocleidomastoid to present as a neck abscess. Other abscess are. Post aural abscess: Most common. Displaces the pinna forwards, outwards and downwards. Meatal abscess: Luc's abscess. Pus breaks into the bony osseous external auditory meatus.

Therefore, surgery is the mainstay of treatment Primary aim is removal of disease by mastoidectomy to make ear safe followed by reconstruction of hearing at a later stage. Modified radical mastoidectomy is the surgery of choice. o Two types of surgical procedures (mastoidectomy) are done to deal with cholesteatoma. Canal wall down procedures. These leave the mastoid cavity open into the external auditory canal so that the diseased area is fully exteriorized. The commonly used procedures for atticoantral disease are atticotomy, modified radical mastoidectomy and rarely radical mastoidectomy. Modified radical mastoidectomy is the procedure of choice. Canal wall up procedures (cortical mastoidectomy). Here disease is removed by combined approach through the meatus and mastoid but retaining the posterior bony meatus wall, thereby avoiding an open mastoid cavity. o For reconstruction of hearing mechanism myringoplasty or tympanoplasty can be done at the time of primary surgery or as a second stage procedure.",
