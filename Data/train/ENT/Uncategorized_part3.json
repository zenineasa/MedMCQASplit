A: Maxillary Malignant neoplasm most frequently involves the maxillary sinus followed in turn by ethmoid, frontal and sphenoid Paranasal sinuses They are a group of four paired air-filled spaces that surround the nasal cavity The sinuses are named for the facial bones behind which they are located. The maxillary sinuses, also called the maxillary antrechea and the largest of the paranasal sinuses lie in the maxillary bones. The frontal sinuses in the frontal bone The ethmoid sinuses are formed from several discrete air cells within the ethmoid bone. The sphenoid sinuses, in the sphenoid bone at the center of the skull base under the pituitary gland. The paranasal air sinuses are lined with respiratory epithelium (ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium). Paranasal sinuses form developmentally through excavation of bone by air-filled sacs (pneumatic diveicula) from the nasal cavity. This process begins prenatally, and it continues through the course of an organism's lifetime Role Decreasing the relative weight of the front of the skull, and especially the bones of the face. Increasing resonance of the voice. Providing a buffer against blows to the face. Insulating sensitive structures like dental roots and eyes from rapid temperature fluctuations in the nasal cavity. Humidifying and heating of inhaled air because of slow air turnover in this region Malignancies of the paranasal sinuses They comprise approximately 0. 2% of all malignancies. About 80% of these malignancies arise in the maxillary sinus. Men are much more often affected than women. They most often occur in the age group between 40 and 70 years. Carcinomas are more frequent than sarcomas. Metastases are rare. Tumours of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses are extremely rare.",

(Range 32-38 mm) From its tympanic end, it runs downward forward and medially joining an angle of 45\u00b0 with horizontal. In infants, the tube is shorter, wider and is more horizontal. It has two parts-a pharyngeal cartilaginous part which forms 2/3rd (24 mm) of its length (i. e. inner or medial part) and a tympanic bony part which forms remaining 1/3rd (outer or lateral part) (12 mm). This is just reverse of external auditory canal The two parts meet at isthmus which is the narrowest part of tube. The fibers of origin of tensor palati muscles are attached to lateral wall of the tube. Contraction of this muscle during swallowing, yawning and sneezing opens the tube and this helps in maintaining equality of air pressure on both sides of tympanic membrane. Contraction of levator palati muscles which runs below the floor of cartilaginous part also helps in opening the tube. It is lined by pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium (cartilaginous part contains numerous mucous glands). Ref. Dhingra 6/e, p 57, 5/e, p 63",

The reason why it disappears after successful surgery is that when the skull is vibrated by bone-conduction sound, the sound is detected by the cochlea via 3 routes: - Route (a)-is by direct vibration within the skull. - Route (b)-is by vibration of the ossicular chain which is suspended within the skull. - Route (c)-is by vibrations emanating into the external auditory canal as sound and being heard by the normal air-conduction route. In a conduction type of hearing loss (as in otosclerosis) the latter two routes are deficient but regained by successful reconstruction surgery. Hence bone conduction thresholds improve following surgery. ALSO KNOW Dip in noise induced hearing loss is seen at 4 KHZ.

Dry perforations that are symptom free do not require usually require closure. If the only symptom is a hearing impairment, the chances of improving hearing with surgery should be considered carefully, not just the hearing in the operated ear but the overall hearing ability of the patient. In patients with a H/O intermittent activity, surgery to close the perforation is probably indicated to minimize future activity.

A sound of low pitch produces the greatest displacement toward the apex of the cochlea and produces the greatest activation of hair cells at that location. As the pitch is increased, the position of greatest displacement moves closer to the base of the cochlea. Increases in the number of hair cells that are activated and in the frequency of discharge of units in the auditory nerve fibers, together with an increase in range of frequencies to which such units respond, are all more likely to be observed in response to increases in the intensity of a sound stimulus rather than to increases in pitch. In the auditory coex, sound frequencies are organized topographically so that a change in pitch may be represented by a change in the location of activated coical units. Ref: Barrett K. E., Barman S.

Irritation from cold wind and water exposure causes the bone surrounding the ear canal to develop lumps of new bony growth which constrict the ear canal.

If previous attempts to eradicate cholesteatoma have failed. Following steps are done in radical mastoidectomy: Posterior meatal wall is removed and the entire area of middle ear, attic, antrum and mastoid is conveed into a single cavity, by removing the bridege and lowering the facial ridge. All remnants of tympanic membrane, ossicles (except the stapes foot plate) and mucoperiosteal lining are removed (Not cohlea). Eustachian tube is obliterated by a piece of muscle or cailage.

        "exp": "Aspiration is the passage of foreign material beyond the vocal cords: The larynx has 3 distinct functions - respiration, phonation and airway protection. Dysfunction of larynx can lead to aspiration. The primary goal of treatment of aspiration is to separate the upper digestive tract from the upper respiratory tract for a short period of time or in some cases, permanently. There are 3 broad categories of treatment. Temporary/Adjunct Treatments Medical Therapy - in the form of antibiotics is important to prevent aspiration pneumonia. It is important to make the patient NPO, to avoid further aspiration and to find an alternate feeding route to maintain the patients nutritional status. A nasogastric tube (feeding gastostomy/jejunostomy) is commonly placed, but this may actually increase the aspiration reflux by making the lower esophageal and upper esophageal sphincters incompetent. But Still \"Tubal feeding (either by nasogastric tube or gastrostomy) however is often unavoidable. \" - Scotts Brown 7/e, vol 1 p 1278 Here it is important to note that feeding Gastrostotomy / jejunostomy are not the gold standard methods of preventing aspiration but rather are done to maintain the nutritional status of patient and prevent further aspiration. In fact according to most texts - they are a common cause of aspiration. Vocal cord medialization (by injecting Gel foam) is useful in unilateral paralysis. This is helpful but is rarely curative, if there is a serious aspiration problem. Tracheostomy will often make aspiration worse by preventing laryngeal elevation on swallowing. It does however, allow easy access to the chest for suctioning. Even a cuffed tube doesn't prevent aspiration as secretions pool above the cuff and the seal is never perfect\" Scotts Brown 7/e, vol 1 p 1278 Definite - Reversible Procedures Endolaryngeal stents: They function like a cork in the bottle. There job is to seal the glottis and therefore thay need to be used in conjunction with a tracheostomy tube. But they are not often used as they are effective only as a short term solution, plus there is risk of glottic stenosis. Laryngotracheal separation: The procedure involves transecting the cervical trachea and bringing out the lower end as a permanent end stoma According to Scotts Brown and Internet sites: It is the procedure of choice as it is reversible. But it has disadvantage of sacrificing voice. Alternative procedure is Tracheoesophageal diversion but has higher complication rates.",

This function of the middle ear is called as impedance matching mechanism or the transformer action. ii. Transduction of mechanical energy to electrical impulse: Movements of the stapes footplate causes vibrations in scala vestibuli followed by scala tympani and is transmitted to the cochlear fluids which brings about movement of the basilar membrane. This sets up shearing force between the tectorial membrane and the hair cells. The distoion of hair cells gives rise to electrical nerve impulse. A sound wave, depending on its frequency, reaches maximum amplitude on a paicular place on the basilar membrane, and stimulates that segment (traveling wave theory of von Bekesy).

Usually, movement is sensed by the movement of this heavy membrane as it stimulates hair-like projections on sensory hair cells fixed to the membrane in the inner ear. In BPPV, the loose crystals aberrantly stimulate the hair cells with ceain head movements. Thus the sensation of veigo is produced. Hair cell death does not cause veigo.

Modified radical mastoidectomy is the surgery of choice. Two types of surgical procedures (mastoidectomy) are done to deal with cholesteatoma. 1) Canal wall down procedures These leave the mastoid cavity open into the external auditory canal so that the diseased area is fully exteriorized. The commonly used procedures for atticoantral disease are atticotomy, modified radical mastoidectomy and rarely radical mastoidectomy. Modified radical mastoidectomy is the procedure of choice. 2) Canal wall up procedures (coical mastoidectomy) Here disease is removed by combined approach through the meatus and mastoid but retaining the posterior bony meatus wall, thereby avoiding an open mastoid cavity.

The etiological agent is Rhinosporidium seeberi. Rhinosporidium seeberi is an aquatic bacterum (not a fungus). Infection usually results from a local traumatic inoculation with the organism. It is seen in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In India, most of the cases are seen in Southern states. Infection of the nose and nasopharynx is observed in 70% of persons with rhinosporidiosis; infection of palpebral conjunctiva or associated structures (including lacrimal apparatus) is observed in 15% of cases. Other structures of the mouth and upper airway may be sites of disease. Disease of the skin, ear, genitals and rectum has also been described. Rhinosporidiosis is an infection that typically limited to the mucosal epithelium. The disease progress with local replication of R seeberi and associated hyperplastic growth of host tissue and a localized immune response. Clinical features of Rhinosporidiosis Rhinosporidiosis presents as soft leafy polypoidal mass (soft polyp), which is pink to purple in colour studded with white dots, i. e. strawberry appearance. This appearance results from sporangia, which is visible as grey or yellow spots in the vascular polypoid masses. Because the polyps are vascular and friable, they bleed easily upon manipulation. Treatment The treatment of choice is surgical excision. Complete excision of mass is done with diathermy knife and cauterization of base. Dapsone is being tried for treating rhinosporidiosis but with limited success.",

The traditional method is to have the patient extend the arm and place his extended finger on the examiner's index finger; then with the eye closed raise the arm directly overhead; than bring it back down precisely onto the examiner's finger. If vestibular or cerebellar lesion is there, past pointing (detion of limb) will be present. The two types (cerebellar and vestibular) past pointing have different patterns:- With vestibular in: balance, the normal labyrinth will push the limb toward the abnormal side and the patient will miss the target. The past pointing will always be to the same side of target and will occur with either limb. With a cerebellar hemispheric lesion, the ipsilateral limbs will have ataxia and incoordination; past pointing occurs only with the involved arm and may be to the side of lesion or erratically to either side of the target.

Conductive hearing loss is usually secondary to impingement of abnormal bone on the stapes footplate. This involvement of the oval window forms the basis of the name fenestral otosclerosis. The most common location of involvement of otosclerosis is the bone just anterior to the oval window at a small cleft known as the fissula ante fenestram. The fissula is a thin fold of connective tissue extending through the endochondral layer, approximately between the oval window and the cochleariform process, where the tensor tympani tendon turns laterally toward the malleus.",

It occurs due to pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum. Clinical features Ear discomfo or pain, hearing loss, and tinnitus are common Veigo is uncommon Otoscopy findings are:- Congested and retracted tympanic membrane Blood may extravasate into middle ear producing haemotympanum On examination there is conductive deafness. Pathogenesis of otitic barotrauma The middle ear pressure is normally maintained at a level similar to that of the atmosphere by the function of Eustachian tube which allows passage of air from middle ear to pharynx. Sudden or dramatic changes of external pressure may defeat this mechanism and cause injury to middle ear. When atmospheric pressure is higher than that of middle ear by critical level of 90 mm Hg, eustachian tube gets locked as the soft tissues of pharyngeal end of the tube are forced into the lumen by high atmospheric pressure. This results in sudden negative pressure in the middle ear which causes retraction of tympanic membrane, hyperemia, transudation with hemorrhage and development of Aero-otitis media (barotrauma). At pressure difference >100 to 500 mm Hg, tympanic membrane can rupture when the pressure difference is more than 100 mg Hg, tympanic membrane can rupture. Treatment of otitic Barotrauma Routine self treatment of pain associated with changing pressure in air craft includes chewing gum, attempting to yawn & swallow, blowing against closed nostrils, and using decongestant nasal sprays. The aim is to restore middle ear areation. Catheterization or politzerization can also be used. If the eustachian tube will not open with other treatments, surgery may be necessory. Myringotomy and aspiration of fluid is the surgical procedure used.",

C: Frontal Sinus Frontal sinus opens into the middle meatus of the nose at the anterior end of hiatus semilunaris Middle Meatus It is a nasal opening or canal situated between the middle and inferior conchae, and extends from the anterior to the posterior end of the latter. On it is a curved fissure, the hiatus semilunaris and limited below by the edge of the uncinate process of the ethmoid and above by an elevation named the bulla ethmoidalis; the middle ethmoidal cells are contained within this bulla and open on or near to it. Through the hiatus semilunaris the meatus communicates with a curved passage termed the infundibulum, which communicates in front with the anterior ethmoidal cells and in rather more than fifty percent of skulls is continued upward as the frontonasal duct into the frontal air-sinus; when this continuity fails, the frontonasal duct opens directly into the anterior pa of the meatus.

Initiation of therapy during first 24 hours of symptom confers a higher likelihood of recovery. Antiviral therapy (Acyclovir) is a newer adjunct in treating acute facial palsy of viral origin (both Bell's palsy and Ramsay hunt syndrome). Most surgeons these days advocate combination of steroids and antiviral drugs. 2) Physical treatment Physical treatment includes: - i) Eye care:- Aificial tear drops, ocular ointment and use of sunglasses to prevent eye complication due to dry eye. ii) Electric stimulation:- To maintain membrane conductivity and reduce muscle atrophy. If the patient of Bell's palsy is not responding to conservative treatment, electrodiagnostic study (electrophysiological study) should be done. Electrodiagnostic study includes, electromyography (EMG), Electroneurography (ENG), minimal excitibility test and maximal excitibility test. Surgery is reserved for those who meet electrodiagnostic (electrophysiological) study criteria or are worsening on medial treatment. 3) Surgical treatment Nerve decompression relieves pressure on the nerve fibers and thus improves the microcirculation of the nerve. Usually veical and tympanic segments of nerve are decompressed. However, some worker's suggest total decompression including labyrinthine segment.

The patient in question is a case of dangerous or unsafe type of CSOM as Signified by the presence of posterosuperior retraction pocket cholesteatoma. The mainstay in treatment of this type of CSOM is surgery. - Primary aim is to remove the disease and render the ear safe. Secondary aim is to preserve or reconstruct hearing, but never at the cost of the primary aim. (Mastoid exploration) is the operation of choice. Tympanoplasty: forms pa of secondary aim to reconstruct hearing after a primary mastoid exploration. - Dangerous type CSOM is associated with a a perforation in attic or posterosuperior region of T. M. along with variable extent of destruction of ossicles and other middle ear contents. Reconstruction of hearing in this type of CSOM thus requires vari- able extent of ossicular reconstruction besides closure of perforation. Audiometry forms an impoant step in evaluation of disease process preoperatively. Although myringoplasty also forms a type of tympanoplasty its use is limited to closure of perforation in the pas tensa of tympanic membrane which is seen in safe type CSOM.",

It occurs due to pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum. Clinical features Ear discomfo or pain, hearing loss, and tinnitus are common Veigo is uncommon Otoscopy findings are:- Congested and retracted tympanic membrane Blood may extravasate into middle ear producing haemotympanum On examination there is conductive deafness. Pathogenesis of otitic barotrauma The middle ear pressure is normally maintained at a level similar to that of the atmosphere by the function of Eustachian tube which allows passage of air from middle ear to pharynx. Sudden or dramatic changes of external pressure may defeat this mechanism and cause injury to middle ear. When atmospheric pressure is higher than that of middle ear by critical level of 90 mm Hg, eustachian tube gets locked as the soft tissues of pharyngeal end of the tube are forced into the lumen by high atmospheric pressure. This results in sudden negative pressure in the middle ear which causes retraction of tympanic membrane, hyperemia, transudation with hemorrhage and development of Aero-otitis media (barotrauma) At pressure difference >100 to 500 mm Hg, tympanic membrane can rupture - when the pressure difference is more than 100 mg Hg, tympanic membrane can rupture. Treatment of otitic Barotrauma Routine self treatment of pain associated with changing pressure in air craft includes chewing gum, attempting to yawn & swallow, blowing against closed nostrils, and using decongestant nasal sprays. The aim is to restore middle ear areation. Catheterization or politzerization can also be used. If the eustachian tube will not open with other treatments, surgery may be necessory. Myringotomy and aspiration of fluid is the surgical procedure used.",

Generally, a tracheal tube of the largest possible internal diameter should be chosen to minimize resistance to gas flow and avoid an excessive leak around the tube. It is important, however, to avoid inserting too large tube, which may cause mucosal damage. The length of the tube is calculated as: Length = + 12 cm For orotracheal intubation Length = + 15 cm For nasotracheal intubation Uncuffed tubes are used in children - as there is potential for mucosal damage with the cuffed tubes (with high volume, low pressure cuffs) In older children approaching puberty - Cuffed endotracheal tubes are used, reflecting the anatomical development of the airway. Endotracheal tubes are available in a variety of materials although the use of PVC and silicone rubber is now almost universal. As far as blades are concerned - A huge range of laryngoscopes blades are available. Anatomical considerations and to some extent personal choice, determine the most appropriate blade to use. In general position of the infant larynx and the long epiglottis makes intubation easier with a straight blade and are often used in children under 6 months of age.

Several conditions can cause a facial paralysis, e. g., brain tumor, stroke, and Lyme disease. However, if no specific cause can be identified, the condition is known as Bell's palsy. Named after Scottish anatomist Charles Bell, who first described it, Bell's palsy is the most common acute mononeuropathy and is the most common cause of acute facial nerve paralysis. Idiopathic unilateral facial nerve paralysis is usually self-limiting. The trademark is rapid onset of paial or complete palsy, usually in a single day. It can occur bilaterally resulting in total facial paralysis in around 1% of cases in GBS, sarcoidosis, sickle cell disease etc. Patient may complain of noise intolerance due to stapedial palsy or loss of taste due to involvement of chorda tympani.",

The stapedius stiffens the ossicular chain by pulling the stapes (stirrup) of the middle ear away from the oval window of the cochlea and the tensor tympani muscle stiffens the ossicular chain by loading the eardrum when it pulls the malleus (hammer) in toward the middle ear. The reflex decreases the transmission of vibrational energy to the cochlea, where it is conveed into electrical impulses to be processed by the brain. The acoustic reflex normally occurs only at relatively high intensities; activation for quieter sounds can indicate ear dysfunction.
