A: Maxillary Malignant neoplasm most frequently involves the maxillary sinus followed in turn by ethmoid, frontal and sphenoid Paranasal sinuses They are a group of four paired air-filled spaces that surround the nasal cavity The sinuses are named for the facial bones behind which they are located. The maxillary sinuses, also called the maxillary antrechea and the largest of the paranasal sinuses lie in the maxillary bones. The frontal sinuses in the frontal bone The ethmoid sinuses are formed from several discrete air cells within the ethmoid bone. The sphenoid sinuses, in the sphenoid bone at the center of the skull base under the pituitary gland. The paranasal air sinuses are lined with respiratory epithelium (ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium). Paranasal sinuses form developmentally through excavation of bone by air-filled sacs (pneumatic diveicula) from the nasal cavity. This process begins prenatally, and it continues through the course of an organism's lifetime Role Decreasing the relative weight of the front of the skull, and especially the bones of the face. Increasing resonance of the voice. Providing a buffer against blows to the face. Insulating sensitive structures like dental roots and eyes from rapid temperature fluctuations in the nasal cavity. Humidifying and heating of inhaled air because of slow air turnover in this region Malignancies of the paranasal sinuses They comprise approximately 0.2% of all malignancies. About 80% of these malignancies arise in the maxillary sinus. Men are much more often affected than women. They most often occur in the age group between 40 and 70 years. Carcinomas are more frequent than sarcomas. Metastases are rare. Tumours of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses are extremely rare.",

The commonest presenting symptoms are unilateral deafness or tinnitus, or a combination of both. Hearing loss is retrocochlear sensorineural type. There is marked difficulty in understanding speech, out of propoion to the pure tone hearing loss, a characteristic feature of acoustic neuroma. Vestibular symptoms are imbalance or unsteadiness. True veigo is very rare. When tumor extends beyond IAC and involves other structures Vhcranial nerve :- It is the earliest nerve to be involved. There is reduced corneal sensitivity and loss of corneal reflex which is the earliest sign of acoustic neuroma. Numbness or paraesthesia of face may occur.

There is hypoesthesia of posterior meatal wall (Hitzelberg's sign), loss of taste, and loss of lacrimation on Schirmer's test. Motor fibres are more resistant. IXth and A' nerves :- Dysphagia and hoarseness due to palatal, pharyngeal and laryngeal paralysis. Brainstem :- Ataxia, weakness, numbness of arms & legs, exaggerated tendon reflexes. Cerebellum :- Ataxia, Dysdiadochokinesia, Nystagmus. Due to raised ICT :- Headache, neusea, vomiting, diplopia due to VI' nerve involvement, and papilloedema.",

A sound of low pitch produces the greatest displacement toward the apex of the cochlea and produces the greatest activation of hair cells at that location. As the pitch is increased, the position of greatest displacement moves closer to the base of the cochlea. Increases in the number of hair cells that are activated and in the frequency of discharge of units in the auditory nerve fibers, together with an increase in range of frequencies to which such units respond, are all more likely to be observed in response to increases in the intensity of a sound stimulus rather than to increases in pitch. In the auditory coex, sound frequencies are organized topographically so that a change in pitch may be represented by a change in the location of activated coical units.

Rhinoscleroma The causative organism is Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis or Frisch bacillus, which can be cultured from the biopsy material. The disease is endemic in several pas of world. In India, it is seen more often in nohern than in the southern pas. Biopsy shows infiltration of submucosa with plasma cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, Mikulicz cells & Russell bodies. The latter two are diagnostic features of the disease. The disease stas in the nose & extends to nasopharynx, oropharynx, larynx, trachea & bronchi. Mode of infection is unknown. Both sexes of any age may be affected. Clinical features of rhinoscleroma The disease runs through the following stages :? a. Atrophic stage : It resembles atrophic rhinitis and is characterised by foul smelling purulent nasal discharge and crusting. b. Granulomatous stage : Granulomatous nodules form in nasal mucosa. There is also subdermal infiltration of lower pa of external nose and upper lip giving a 'woody' feel. Nodules are painless and non-ulcerative. c. Cicatricial stage : This causes stenosis of nares, distoion of upper lip, adhesions in the nose, nasopharynx and oropharynx. There may be subglottic stenosis with respiratory distress. Biopsy of rhinoscleroma shows infiltration of submucosa with plasma cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, Mikulicz cells and Russell bodies. The latter two are the diagnostic features of the disease. Treatment Both streptomycin & tetracycline are given together for minimum of 4-6 wks. Steroid can be combined to reduce fibrosis. Surgical treatment may be required to establish the airway and correct nasal deformity",

Surfer's ear is not the same as swimmer's ear, although infection can result as a side effect. Irritation from cold wind and water exposure causes the bone surrounding the ear canal to develop lumps of new bony growth which constrict the ear canal. The condition is so named due to its prevalence among cold water surfers. Cold water surfers experience surfer's ear at about six times the rate of warm water surfers. Common site for surfer's ear is external auditory canal. Tympanic pa of the temporal bone is a U shaped curved bony plate that forms most of the pa of the external auditory canal.

Another incision is made in the mucoperiosteum over the nasal spine on the same side, elevating the mucoperiosteum from nasal spine on both sides thus making two more tunnels called inferior tunnels. Two tunnels are joined by sharp dissection. Septal cailage is then separated from vomero-ethmoid bones posteriorly and nasal spine inferiorly. Maxillary crest is removed to realign septal cailage. Bony septal deformity is corrected by removing deformed pa. Deformed septal cailage is corrected. Trans-septal sutures are put to coapt mucoperichondrial flaps. Nasal pack is put.

Modified radical mastoidectomy is the surgery of choice. Two types of surgical procedures (mastoidectomy) are done to deal with cholesteatoma. 1) Canal wall down procedures These leave the mastoid cavity open into the external auditory canal so that the diseased area is fully exteriorized. The commonly used procedures for atticoantral disease are atticotomy, modified radical mastoidectomy and rarely radical mastoidectomy. Modified radical mastoidectomy is the procedure of choice. 2) Canal wall up procedures (coical mastoidectomy) Here disease is removed by combined approach through the meatus and mastoid but retaining the posterior bony meatus wall, thereby avoiding an open mastoid cavity. For reconstruction of hearing mechanism myringoplasty or tympanoplasty can be done at the time of primary surgery or as a second stage procedure.",

The etiological agent is Rhinosporidium seeberi. Rhinosporidium seeberi is an aquatic bacterum (not a fungus). Infection usually results from a local traumatic inoculation with the organism. It is seen in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In India, most of the cases are seen in Southern states. Infection of the nose and nasopharynx is observed in 70% of persons with rhinosporidiosis; infection of palpebral conjunctiva or associated structures (including lacrimal apparatus) is observed in 15% of cases. Other structures of the mouth and upper airway may be sites of disease. Disease of the skin, ear, genitals and rectum has also been described. Rhinosporidiosis is an infection that typically limited to the mucosal epithelium. The disease progress with local replication of R seeberi and associated hyperplastic growth of host tissue and a localized immune response. Clinical features of Rhinosporidiosis Rhinosporidiosis presents as soft leafy polypoidal mass (soft polyp), which is pink to purple in colour studded with white dots, i.e. strawberry appearance. This appearance results from sporangia, which is visible as grey or yellow spots in the vascular polypoid masses. Because the polyps are vascular and friable, they bleed easily upon manipulation. Treatment The treatment of choice is surgical excision. Complete excision of mass is done with diathermy knife and cauterization of base. Dapsone is being tried for treating rhinosporidiosis but with limited success.",

The traditional method is to have the patient extend the arm and place his extended finger on the examiner's index finger; then with the eye closed raise the arm directly overhead; than bring it back down precisely onto the examiner's finger. If vestibular or cerebellar lesion is there, past pointing (detion of limb) will be present. The two types (cerebellar and vestibular) past pointing have different patterns :- With vestibular in:balance, the normal labyrinth will push the limb toward the abnormal side and the patient will miss the target. The past pointing will always be to the same side of target and will occur with either limb. With a cerebellar hemispheric lesion, the ipsilateral limbs will have ataxia and incoordination; past pointing occurs only with the involved arm and may be to the side of lesion or erratically to either side of the target.

Conductive hearing loss is usually secondary to impingement of abnormal bone on the stapes footplate. This involvement of the oval window forms the basis of the name fenestral otosclerosis. The most common location of involvement of otosclerosis is the bone just anterior to the oval window at a small cleft known as the fissula ante fenestram. The fissula is a thin fold of connective tissue extending through the endochondral layer, approximately between the oval window and the cochleariform process, where the tensor tympani tendon turns laterally toward the malleus.",

It occurs due to pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum. Clinical features Ear discomfo or pain, hearing loss, and tinnitus are common Veigo is uncommon Otoscopy findings are :- Congested and retracted tympanic membrane Blood may extravasate into middle ear producing haemotympanum On examination there is conductive deafness. Pathogenesis of otitic barotrauma The middle ear pressure is normally maintained at a level similar to that of the atmosphere by the function of Eustachian tube which allows passage of air from middle ear to pharynx. Sudden or dramatic changes of external pressure may defeat this mechanism and cause injury to middle ear. When atmospheric pressure is higher than that of middle ear by critical level of 90 mm Hg, eustachian tube gets locked as the soft tissues of pharyngeal end of the tube are forced into the lumen by high atmospheric pressure. This results in sudden negative pressure in the middle ear which causes retraction of tympanic membrane, hyperemia, transudation with hemorrhage and development of Aero-otitis media (barotrauma). At pressure difference >100 to 500 mm Hg, tympanic membrane can rupture when the pressure difference is more than 100 mg Hg, tympanic membrane can rupture. Treatment of otitic Barotrauma Routine self treatment of pain associated with changing pressure in air craft includes chewing gum, attempting to yawn & swallow, blowing against closed nostrils, and using decongestant nasal sprays. The aim is to restore middle ear areation. Catheterization or politzerization can also be used. If the eustachian tube will not open with other treatments, surgery may be necessory. Myringotomy and aspiration of fluid is the surgical procedure used.",

On it is a curved fissure, the hiatus semilunaris and limited below by the edge of the uncinate process of the ethmoid and above by an elevation named the bulla ethmoidalis; the middle ethmoidal cells are contained within this bulla and open on or near to it. Through the hiatus semilunaris the meatus communicates with a curved passage termed the infundibulum, which communicates in front with the anterior ethmoidal cells and in rather more than fifty percent of skulls is continued upward as the frontonasal duct into the frontal air-sinus; when this continuity fails, the frontonasal duct opens directly into the anterior pa of the meatus.

Initiation of therapy during first 24 hours of symptom confers a higher likelihood of recovery. Antiviral therapy (Acyclovir) is a newer adjunct in treating acute facial palsy of viral origin (both Bell's palsy and Ramsay hunt syndrome). Most surgeons these days advocate combination of steroids and antiviral drugs. 2) Physical treatment Physical treatment includes : - i) Eye care :- Aificial tear drops, ocular ointment and use of sunglasses to prevent eye complication due to dry eye. ii) Electric stimulation :- To maintain membrane conductivity and reduce muscle atrophy. If the patient of Bell's palsy is not responding to conservative treatment, electrodiagnostic study (electrophysiological study) should be done. Electrodiagnostic study includes, electromyography (EMG), Electroneurography (ENG), minimal excitibility test and maximal excitibility test. Surgery is reserved for those who meet electrodiagnostic (electrophysiological) study criteria or are worsening on medial treatment. 3) Surgical treatment Nerve decompression relieves pressure on the nerve fibers and thus improves the microcirculation of the nerve.Usually veical and tympanic segments of nerve are decompressed.

The patient in question is a case of dangerous or unsafe type of CSOM as Signified by the presence of posterosuperior retraction pocket cholesteatoma. The mainstay in treatment of this type of CSOM is surgery. - Primary aim is to remove the disease and render the ear safe. Secondary aim is to preserve or reconstruct hearing, but never at the cost of the primary aim. (Mastoid exploration) is the operation of choice. Tympanoplasty: forms pa of secondary aim to reconstruct hearing after a primary mastoid exploration. - Dangerous type CSOM is associated with a a perforation in attic or posterosuperior region of T.M. along with variable extent of destruction of ossicles and other middle ear contents. Reconstruction of hearing in this type of CSOM thus requires vari- able extent of ossicular reconstruction besides closure of perforation.

It occurs due to pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum. Clinical features Ear discomfo or pain, hearing loss, and tinnitus are common Veigo is uncommon Otoscopy findings are :- Congested and retracted tympanic membrane Blood may extravasate into middle ear producing haemotympanum On examination there is conductive deafness. Pathogenesis of otitic barotrauma The middle ear pressure is normally maintained at a level similar to that of the atmosphere by the function of Eustachian tube which allows passage of air from middle ear to pharynx. Sudden or dramatic changes of external pressure may defeat this mechanism and cause injury to middle ear. When atmospheric pressure is higher than that of middle ear by critical level of 90 mm Hg, eustachian tube gets locked as the soft tissues of pharyngeal end of the tube are forced into the lumen by high atmospheric pressure. This results in sudden negative pressure in the middle ear which causes retraction of tympanic membrane, hyperemia, transudation with hemorrhage and development of Aero-otitis media (barotrauma) At pressure difference >100 to 500 mm Hg, tympanic membrane can rupture - when the pressure difference is more than 100 mg Hg, tympanic membrane can rupture. Treatment of otitic Barotrauma Routine self treatment of pain associated with changing pressure in air craft includes chewing gum, attempting to yawn & swallow, blowing against closed nostrils, and using decongestant nasal sprays. The aim is to restore middle ear areation. Catheterization or politzerization can also be used. If the eustachian tube will not open with other treatments, surgery may be necessory.

All muscles of pharynx are supplied by cranial accessory through branches of vagus pharyngeal plexus except stylopharyngeus which is supplied by glossopharyngeal. Inferior constrictor muscle has two pas :- (i) Thyropharyngeous with oblique fibres, and (ii) Cricophatyngeous with transverse fibres. Between these two pas of inferior constrictor exists a potential gap called Killan's dehiscence. It is also called the gateway to tear as perforation can occur at this site during esophagoscopy. It is also the site for herniation of pharyngeal mucosa in case of pharyngeal pouch. Upper fibers of palatopharyngeus constitute the Passavant's muscle which on contraction raises a ridge called Passavant's ridge on posterior wall of nasopharynx.",

Idiopathic unilateral facial nerve paralysis is usually self-limiting. The trademark is rapid onset of paial or complete palsy, usually in a single day.

The reflex decreases the transmission of vibrational energy to the cochlea, where it is conveed into electrical impulses to be processed by the brain. The acoustic reflex normally occurs only at relatively high intensities; activation for quieter sounds can indicate ear dysfunction.
