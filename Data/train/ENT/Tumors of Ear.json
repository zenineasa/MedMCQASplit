Therefore from the floor it comes into the hypotympanum. Less commonly Glomus may arise from promontory and is called Glomus tympanicum. Since it is locally invasive Glomus may later on reach epitympanum, mastoid and other nearby areas.",

Age group - Middle aged females. Histology - Paraganglionic cells of neural crest origin. Types 1. Glomus jugulare--from jugular bulb2. Glomus tympanicum--from promontory. Symptoms: Progressive conductive deafness, pulsating tinnitus. Signs: Brown sign (pulsating sign)-when ear canal pressure is increased tumour pulsates vigorously and blanches, and reverse on releasing pressure. Rising sun sign-looking through an otoscope tumour appears to be arising from the floor of middle ear. Investigation of choiceC. T scan- shows erosion of caroticojugular spine.
