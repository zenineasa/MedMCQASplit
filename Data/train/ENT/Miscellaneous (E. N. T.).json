Triad of postcricoid dysphagia, oesophageal webs, and iron deficiency anemia constitutes Plummer Vinson syndrome. Due to iron deficiency there occurs atrophy of the gastric mucosa leading to achlorhydria. Intrinsic factor (IF) is needed for the absorption of dietary cobalamin, i. e. vitamin B12. This binding of IF with B12 prevents the proteolytic digestion of B12. Intrinsic factor is secreted by the parietal cells of the cardiac and fundic mucosa of the stomach, which also secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl). The IF-cobalamin complex then reaches terminal ileum where cobalamin gets absorbed. In PV syndrome due to atrophy of gastric mucosa therefore there is no IF available leading to poor absorption of vitamin B12. Eagle syndrome is pain in the tonsillar fossa area due to enlarged calcified styloid process. Job's syndrome is hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome. Treacher Collin syndrome is 1st arch hypoplasia causing maxillo-mandibular hypoplasia.",

Associated symptoms such as hearing loss and vertigo are thought to occur as a result of transmission of the virus via direct proximity of cranial nerve (CN) VIII to CN VII at the cerebellopontine angle or via vasa vasorum that travel from CN VII to other nearby cranial nerves.> If diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome is not established by physical examination alone, consider a head CT scan to investigate other etiologies of facial paralysis.> Early administration (<72 h) of acyclovir showed an increased rate of facial nerve function recovery and prevented further nerve degeneration. Evidence is accumulating that VZV may be responsible for many cases of Bell palsy that go unrecognized because of a lack of cutaneous findings (zoster sine herpete).> Accordingly, the clinician should entertain more liberal use of antivirals such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir.
