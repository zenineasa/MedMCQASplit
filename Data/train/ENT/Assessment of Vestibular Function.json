Epley Maneuver for Rx of BPPV: The patient is taken through 4 moves, starting in the sitting position with the head turned at a 45-degree angle toward the affected side. (1) The patient is placed into the Dix-Hallpike position (supine with the affected ear down) until the vertigo and nystagmus subside. (2) The patient's head is then turned to the opposite side, causing the affected ear to be up and the unaffected ear to be down. (3) The whole body and head is then turned away from the affected side to a lateral decubitus position, with the head in a face down position. (4) The last step is to bring the patient back to a sitting position with the head turned toward the unaffected shoulder. BPPV (BENIGN PAROXYSMAL POSITIONAL VERTIGO). It is characterized by vertigo when head is placed in a certain critical position.# Cause:- Disorder of posterior semicircular canal.- Otoconial debris, consisting of calcium carbonate, is released from the degenerating macula of utricle and floats freely in endolymph. When it settles on the cupula of posterior semicircular canal in critical head position, it causes displacement of cupula and vertigo.# H/o: Deafness, Vomiting, Tinnitus# Positional vertigo is precipitated by a recumbent head position, either to the right or to the left.# Benign paroxysmal positional (or positioning) vertigo (BPPV) of the posterior semicircular canal is particularly common. Although the condition may be due to head trauma, usually no precipitating factors are identified. It generally abates spontaneously after weeks or months. The vertigo and accompanying nystagmus have a distinct pattern of latency, fatigability, and habituation that differs from the less common central positional vertigo due to lesions in and around the fourth ventricle. Moreover, the pattern of nystagmus in posterior canal BPPV is distinctive.# When supine, with the head turned to the side of the offending ear (bad ear down), the lower eye displays a large- amplitude torsional nystagmus, and the upper eye has a lesser degree of torsion combined with upbeating nystagmus. If the eyes are directed to the upper ear, the vertical nystagmus in the upper eye increases in amplitude. Mild dysequilibrium when upright may also be present. Features. BPPVCentral. Latency3-40 s.

However additionally there may be tinnitus and deafness when there occurs involvement of cochlea. Important differentiating features between peripheral and central nystagmus include the following. Characteristic of spontaneous nystagmus. Peripheral vestibular. Central vestibular. Form. Torsional (i. e. rotatory movement of the eye globe about its anteroposterior axis) component superimposed on a horizontal (left or right movement) or vertical (downbeat or upbeat) nystagmus. Pure horizontal, pure vertical or purely torsional nystagmus. Direction. Direction-fixed, i. e. unidirectional nystagmus. The nystagmus becomes more pronounced with gaze towards the side of the fast component. Direction changing, i. e. bidirectional. Here the direction of the fast component gets directed towards the side of gaze (e. g. left-beating in left gaze and right-beating in right gaze). On visual/optic fixation. The nystagmus disappears with visual fixation. On removing the visual fixation, the nystagmus reappears. If the nystagmus is very fine, i. e. difficult to be seen by naked eye, then Frenzel glasses, which are strong convex glasses, are used. These glasses allow the examiner to see the patient's eyes greatly magnified. These glasses at the same time remove visual fixation, by blurring the patient's vision, thereby making the nystagmus apparent. The nystagmus, does not disappear with visual fixation, indicating loss of inhibition. Associated features. Unilateral Tinnitus and deafness is often present, but without any other cranial nerve and cerebellar involvement. Besides tinnitus and deafness (indicating the involvement of 8th nerve), involvement and deficits of cranial nerves III to XII which are closely associated with the brainstem are often present. Also cerebellar manifestations (e. g. ataxia, dysarthria, etc.) may be seen. Common causes. BPPV, Labyrinthitis, Vestibular neuronitis, Meniere's, Labyrinthine fistula and damage by ototoxic drugs. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency and other central vascular conditions, Demyelinating illnesses and Tumours. In Cerebellar disease the nystagmus is pendular.

Disease is caused by a disorder of posterior semicircular canal though many patients have history of head trauma and ear infection. It has been demonstrated that otoconial debris, consisting of crystals of calcium carbonate, is released from the degenerating macula of the utricle and floats freely in the endolymph. The condition can be treated by performing Epley's manoeuvre. The principle of this manoeuvre is to reposition the otoconial debris from the posterior semicircular canal back into the utricle. The manoeuvre consists of five positions. Position 1; With the head turned 45deg, the patient is made to lie down in head-hanging position (Dix. Hallpike manoeuvre).

Treatment of BPPVo The definitive treatment of BPPV requires that crystals causing inflammation in the semicircular canals should 1 removed. o This can be done by the Eplev maneuvers (vestibular exercise), where the head is taken through a series of positic changes that allow the crystals to be emptied out of the canal. o Several medications, including common motion sickness remedies, may relieve symptoms of BPPV and may be us< for less severe episodes of vertigo or in addition to the Epley maneuvers, o These medications are meclizine, dimenhydramine, diazepam. o Surgery for BPPV is reserved for the most severe cases which are intractable and which are not associate with other pathology. o Posterior semicircular canal occlusion is the simplest procedure w hich addresses the cause of the dizziness its source. o The posterior semicircular canal is surgically plugged. This prevents any loose particles from causing vertigo.",

        "exp": "Ans. A. Intralabrynthine streptomycin. (Ref. PL Dhingra ENT, 5th /pg. 51)BPPV (BENIGN PAROXYSMAL POSITIONAL VERTIGO): It is characterized by vertigo when head is placed in a certain critical position.# Cause:- Disorder of posterior semicircular canal.- Otoconial debris, consisting of calcium carbonate, is released from the degenerating macula of utricle and floats freely in endolymph. When it settles on the cupula of posterior semicircular canal in critical head position; it causes displacement of cupula and vertigo.# H/o: Deafness, Vomiting and Tinnitus.# Positional vertigo is precipitated by a recumbent head position, either to the right or to the left.# BPPV generally abates spontaneously after weeks or months. The vertigo and accompanying nystagmus have a distinct pattern of latency, fatigability, and habituation that differs from the less common central positional vertigo due to lesions in and around the fourth ventricle. Moreover, the pattern of nystagmus in posterior canal BPPV is distinctive.# When supine, with the head turned to the side of the offending ear (bad ear down), the lower eye displays a large- amplitude torsional nystagmus, and the upper eye has a lesser degree of torsion combined with upbeating nystagmus. If the eyes are directed to the upper ear, the vertical nystagmus in the upper eye increases in amplitude. Mild dysequilibrium when upright may also be present. Features. BPPVCentral. Latency3-40 s. None: immediate vertigo and nystagmus. Fatigability. Yes. No. Habituation. Yes. No. Intensity of vertigo. Severe. Mild. Reproducibility. Variable. Good. Treatment: a) Epley's Maneuverb) Intra-labyrinthine Streptomycin / Gentamycin. (newer Rx). Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is caused by dislodged otoconia that move with changes in head position. Single applications of the Epley procedure or the Semont maneuver have been reported to relieve symptoms in the majority of patients. Repeated treatment sessions may be necessary before symptoms resolve. Also know: Technique of syringing the ear# Patient seating with ear to be syringed towards examiner.# Patient's head slightly tilted over tray to collect returning fluid.# Pinna is pulled upwards and backwards and a jet of water from ear syringe is directed along posterosuperior wall of meatus which expels wax out.",
