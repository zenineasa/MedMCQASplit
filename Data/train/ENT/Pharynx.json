It can be controlled by pressure, ligation or electrocoagulation of the bleeding vessels. Reactionary haemorrhage: Occurs within a period of 24 hours. Injury to tonsillar pillars, uvula, soft palate, tongue or superior constrictor muscle due to bad surgical technique. Injury to teeth. Aspiration of blood. Facial oedema: Some patients get oedema of the face particularly of the eyelids. Surgical emphysema. Dalayed complications. Secondary haemorrhage: Usually seen between the 5th to 10th post-operative day. It is the result of sepsis and premature separation of the membrane. Usually, it is heralded by bloodstained sputum but may be profuse. Infection: Infection of tonsillar fossa may lead to parapharyngeal abscess or otitis media. Lung complications: Aspiration of blood, mucus or tissue fragments may cause atelectasis or lung abscess. Scarring in soft palate and pillars. Tonsillar remnants: Tonsil tags or tissue, left due to inadequate surgery, may get repeatedly infected. Hypertrophy of lingual tonsil: This is a late complication and is compensatory to loss of palatine tonsils.",

Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromao Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a benign, but locally aggresive, tumor of nasopharynx seen in prepubertal and adolescent males. o It is the most common benign neoplasm of nasopharynx. o It is a highly vascular tumor and blood supply of the tumor most commonly arises from the internal maxillary artery. o Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) occurs almost exclusively in males. o Female with Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) should undergo genetic testing, o Onset is most commonly in the second decades, the range is 7-19years. o The exact cause is unknown. As the tumour is predominantly seen in adolescent males in the second decade of life, it is thought to be testosterone dependent. o The most common site is posterior part of nasal cavity close to the margin of sphenopalatine foramen. o The tumor starts adjacent to the sphenopalatine foramen. o Large tumors are frequently bilobed or dumbbel shaped, with one portion of tumor filling the nasopharynx and the other portion extending to the pterygopalatine fossa. Clinical featureso Symptoms depend on spread of tumour to nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, pterygomaxillary fossa, infratemporal fossa, cheek, orbits (through inferior orbital fissure), cranial cavity' (most common site is middle cranialfossa). o Nasal obstruction (80-90%) is the most common symptom, especially in the initial stages. This results in denasal speech, hyposmia, broadening of nasal bridge, o Spontaneous profuse & recurrent ep is taxis is the second most common symptomo Otalgia, conductive hearing loss, serous otitis media, due to eustachian tube obstruction, o Pink or purplish mass obstructing one or both chonae in nasopharynx. o Tumour in the orbit causes: proptosis; and frog-face deformity; diplopia and diminshed vision, o Tumour in infratemporal fossa can cause trismus and bulge of parotid. o II, III, IV, V, VI cranial nerve can be involved. o Splaying of nasal bones. o Swelling of cheek and fullness of face. Diagnosis and treatmento Contrast CT is the investigation of choice. o Biopsy should be avoided as it can cause severe bleeding. o Surgical excision is the treatment of choice.",

AETIOLOGY:- Peritonsillar abscess usually follows acute tonsillitis though it may arise de novo without previous history of sore throats. First, one of the tonsillar crypts, usually the crypta magna, gets infected and sealed off. It forms an intratonsillar abscess which then bursts through the tonsillar capsule to set up peritonsillitis and then an abscess. Culture of pus from the abscess may reveal pure growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus or anaerobic organisms. More often the growth is mixed, with both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. CLINICAL FEATURES:- Peritonsillar abscess mostly affects adults and rarely the children though acute tonsillitis is more common in children. Usually, it is unilateral though occasionally bilateral abscesses are recorded. Clinical features are divided into: 1. General:- Theyare due to septicaemia and resemble any acute infection. They include fever (up to 104degF), chills and rigors, general malaise, body aches, headache, nausea and constipation. 2. Local:- (a) Severe pain in throat. Usually unilateral. (b) Odynophagia. It is so marked that the patient cannot even swallow his own saliva which dribbles from the angle of his mouth. Patient is usually dehydrated. (c) Muffled and thick speech, often called \"hot potato voice. \" (d) Foul breath due to sepsis in the oral cavity and poor hygiene. (e) Ipsilateral earache. This is referred pain CN IX which supplies both the tonsil and the ear. (f) Trismus due to spasm of pterygoid muscles which are in close proximity to the superior constrictor.

PHARYNGOESOPHAGEAL DIVERTICULUM (ZENKER DIVERTICULUM)# General Considerations- Zenker diverticulum originates from the posterior wall of the esophagus, in a triangular area of weakness limited: SS inferiorly by the cricopharyngeus muscle and. SS superiorly by the inferior constrictor muscles (ie, the Killian triangle).- As the diverticulum enlarges, it tends to deviate from the midline, mostly to the left.# Pathogenesis- Zenker diverticulum results from either a lack of coordination between the pharyngeal contraction and the opening of the UES or a hypertensive UES.- Because of the increased intraluminal pressure, there is progressive herniation of mucosa and submucosa through the Killian triangle. Clinical Findings - Essentials of Diagnosis- Dysphagia, (the most common symptom)- Regurgitation of undigested food (with risk of aspiration).- Gurgling sounds in the neck.- Halitosis.# Imaging Studies- A barium swallow is the investigation of choice. It can also show a hiatal hernia.# Treatment- The standard treatment consists of excision of -the diverticulum and myotomy of the cricopharyngeus muscle, including the upper 3 cm of the posterior esophageal wall.- For small diverticula (ie, < 2 cm), myotomy alone is sufficient. As an alternative to the conventional treatment, a transoral endoscopic approach, using an endoscopic stapling instrument, can be used for diverticula between 3 cm and 6 cm in size.# Prognosis- The prognosis is excellent in about 90% of cases.",
