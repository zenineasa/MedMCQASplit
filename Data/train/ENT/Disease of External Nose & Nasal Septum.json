It is predominantly seen in men age 40 and older. The word rhinophyma comes from the Greek language: rhinis meaning nose and phyma meaning growth. Rare cases have also been noted to involve the ears. This skin condition is frequently referred to as the \"W. C. Fields\" nose or potato nose. Rhinophyma consists of hypertrophic nodular growths on the distal half of the nose. The nose becomes very fibrous and inflamed, often becoming deep red or purple in color due to diffuse telangiectasias. Treatment: Rhinophyma is best treated with surgical ablation of the tissue. Cases with minimal involvement can easily be treated with electrosurgery. In moderate to severe cases, carbon dioxide laser surgery provides the best cosmetic improvement. Additionally a vascular laser (532 nm PDL) can be used to restore normal skin color. The goal of treatment is to return the nose to a pre diseased appearance and function",
