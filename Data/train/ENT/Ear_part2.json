Guidlines aimed at both primary care and specialist otolaryngologist broadly agree that a watchful waitin period for about three months is the initial management of children with serous otitis media. Therefore, unless there are also signs of an infection, most health care providers will not treat SOM at first Instead, they will recheck the problem in 2-3 months. This should be coupled with reassurance that doing nothing is as likely as doing something to result in resolution of the SOM and the associated symptoms.2) Surgery# Surgicalinterventionisrecommendedwhenwatchfulwaitingandmonitoringofhearinghasconfirmedfailure of resolution of SOM. Following surgical intervention are used commonly: -i) Myringotomy and aspiration of fluid: -An incision is made in tympanic membrane and fluid aspirated with suction.ii) Grommet (ventilation tube) surgery: - If myringotomy and aspiration combined with medical measures has not helped and fluid recurs, a grommet is inserted to provide continued aeration of middle ear.

SOM is an insidious condition in which there is thick or sticky non-purulent fluid behind the eardrum in the middle ear, but there is no ear infection, i.e., effusion of middle ear without infection. Fluid in the middle ear is sterile. SOM occurs most commonly in school going children and SOM is the commonest cause of childhood hearing loss.EtiopathogenesisEustachian tube dysfunctionEustachian tube dysfunction, coupled with recurrent upper respiratory tract infection is the most important factor in the development of SOM. Normally eustachian tube helps to drain fluids to prevent them from building up in the ear. In Eustachian tube dysfunction, it is unable to drain the fluid. Following can cause Eustachian tube blockRespiratory tract infection Adenoid, rhinitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis.AllergiesBenign and malignant tumor of nasopharynx.Unresolved otitis mediaInadequate antibiotic therapy in acute suppurative otitis media may inactivate infection but fails to resolve it completely. Low grade infection lingers on and acts as stimulus for mucosa to secrete more fluid.Clinical featureso Unlike children with an ear infection (ASOM), children with SOM do not act sick,o The only presenting symptom may be hearing loss with fullness in ear.Otoscopic finding of SOMo Air bubbles on the surface of ear drumo Fluid behind the eardrum.o Dullness of the eardrum when a light is used, with loss of light reflex,o Eardrum may appear yellow, grey or bluish in colour,o Retracted eardrum with decreased mobilityo Tympanometry shows type B tympanogram.",

Sudden or dramatic changes of external pressure may defeat this mechanism and cause injury to middle ear. When atmospheric pressure is higher than that of middle ear by critical level of 90 mm Hg, eustachian tube gets locked as the soft tissues of pharyngeal end of the tube are forced into the lumen by high atmospheric pressure. This results in sudden negative pressure in the middle ear which causes retraction of tympanic membrane, hyperemia, transudation with hemorrhage and development ofAero-otitis media (barotrauma)o At pressure difference >100 to 500 mm Hg, tympanic membrane can rupture --> when the pressure difference is more than 100 mg Hg, tympanic membrane can rupture.Treatment of otitic Barotraumao Routine self treatment of pain associated with changing pressure in air craft includes chewing gum, attempting to yawn & swallow, blowing against closed nostrils, and using decongestant nasal sprays. The aim is to restore middle ear areation. Catheterization or politzerization can also be used. If the eustachian tube will not open with other treatments, surgery may be necessory.

R.Va p.327PRESBYCUSIS:Sensory neural hearing loss associated with physiological aging process in the ear is called presbycusis. It usually manifests at the age of 65 years but may do so early if there is hereditary predisposition, chronic noise exposure or generalized vascular disease.Clinical features:Patients of presbycusis have great difficulty in hearing in the presence of background noise though (he may hear well in quiet surroundings).They may complain of speech being heard but not understood.Recruitment phenomenon is positive and all the sounds suddenly become intolerable when volume is raised.Tinnitus is another troublesome problem and in some it is the only complaintCauses: Although the precise etiology of presbycusis is currently not known, the cause of presbycusis is generally agreed to be multifactorial. Proposed causes include the following:Arteriosclerosis:Diabetes accelerates the process of atherosclerosis, diffuse proliferation and hypertrophy of the vascular intimal endothelium and brainstem neuropathyDiets high in antioxidants such as vitamins C and E reduce the progression of presbycusisAccumulated exposure to noiseDrug and environmental chemical exposureStressGeneticsInvestigations: Audiometric testing with pure-tone average and speech discrimination forms the cornerstone of diagnostic testing for presbycusis.

OAEs are auditory evoked potentialsExplanationOAEs are low-intensity sounds that are generated by the cochlea either spontaneously or evoked by an auditory stimulus and propagate through the middle ear into the ear canal.OAEs are by-product of active processing by the outer-hair cell system. OAEs are present when outer-hair cells are healthy and absent when outer-hair cells are damaged. Thus, OAEs reveal, an incoming the integrity of outer-hair cell function.OAEs are biological phenomenon generated in normal cochlea when cochlea processes incoming auditory impulse. This is a mechanical activity taking place in outer hair cells before the inner hair cells transducer the mechanical activity into action potentials.are sounds, they are measured in decibels (dBSPL).It is a preneural activity and there are no action potentials generated. OAEs are not auditory evoked potentials.There are two broad categories of OAEs: spontaneous and evoked.Transient evoked OAEs (TEOAEs). Evoked by clicks. A series of click stimuli are presented at 80-85 dBSPL and response recorded.Distortion product OAEs (DPOAEs). Two tones are simultaneously presented to the cochlea to produce distortion products. They have been used to test hearing in the range of 1000-8000 Hz.UsesOAEs are used as a screening test of hearing in neonates and to test hearing in uncooperative or mentally challenged individuals after sedation. Sedation does not interfere with OAEs.They help to distinguish cochlear from retrocochlear hearing loss. OAEs are absent in cochlear lesions, e.g. ototoxic sensorineural hearing loss. They detect ototoxic effects earlier than pure- tone audiometry.OAEs are also useful to diagnose retrocochlear pathology, especially auditory neuropathy. Auditory neuropathy is a neurologic disorder of CN VIII. Audiometric tests, e.g. SNHL for pure tones, impaired speech discrimination score, absent or abnormal auditory brainstem response, show a retrocochlear type of lesion but OAEs are normal.",

Here, middle ear implies middle ear cleft, i.e. eustachian tube, middle ear, attic, aditus, antrum and mastoid air cells. ROUTES OF INFECTION 1. Via eustachian tube: It is the most common route. Infection travels the lumen of the tube or along subepithelial peritubal lymphatics. Eustachian tube in infants and young children is shoer, wider and more horizontal and thus may account for higher incidence of infections in this age group. Breast or bottle feeding in a young infant in horizontal position may force fluids through the tube into the middle ear and hence the need to keep the infant propped up with head a little higher. Swimming and diving can also force water through the tube into the middle ear. 2. Via external ear: Traumatic perforations of tympanic membrane due to any cause open a route to middle ear infection. 3. Blood-borne: This is an uncommon route. AETIOLOGY : It is more common especially in infants and children of lower socioeconomic group.

Cailage is a continuation of the cailage which forms the framework of the pinna. It has two deficiencies--the \"fissures of Santorini\" in this pa of the cailage and through them the parotid or superficial mastoid infections can appear in the canal or vice versa. The skin covering the cailaginous canal is thick and contains ceruminous and pilosebaceous glands which secrete wax. Hair is only confined to the outer canal and therefore furuncles (staphylococcal infection of hair follicles) are seen only in the outer one- third of the canal. 2. BONY PA It forms inner two-thirds (16 mm). Skin lining the bony canal is thin and continuous over the tympanic membrane. It is devoid of hair and ceruminous glands. About 6 mm lateral to tympanic membrane, the bony meatus presents a narrowing called isthmus. Foreign bodies, lodged medial to the isthmus, get impacted, and are difficult to remove. Anteroinferior pa of the deep meatus, beyond the isthmus, presents a recess called anterior recess, which acts as a cesspool for discharge and debris in cases of external and middle ear infections. Anteroinferior pa of the bony canal may present a deficiency (foramen of Huschke) in children up to the age of four or sometimes in adults, permitting infections to and from the parotid.

The membranous labyrinth is filled with a clear fluid called endolymph while the space between membranous and bony labyrinths is filled with perilymph. BONY LABYRINTH It consists of three pas: the vestibule, the semicircular canals and the cochlea. Cochlea: The bony cochlea is a coiled tube making 2.5 to 2.75 turns round a central pyramid of bone called modiolus. The base of modiolus is directed towards internal acoustic meatus and transmits vessels and nerves to the cochlea. Around the modiolus and winding spirally like the thread of a screw, is a thin plate of bone called osseous spiral lamina. It divides the bony cochlea incompletely and gives attachment to the basilar membrane. The bony bulge in the medial wall of middle ear, the promontory, is due to the basal coil of the cochlea. The bony cochlea contains three compaments: (a) Scala vestibuli, (b) Scala tympani, (c) Scala media or the membranous cochlea. The scala vestibuli and scala tympani are filled with peri- lymph and communicate with each other at the apex of cochlea through an opening called helicotrema. Scala vestibuli is closed by the footplate of stapes which separates it from the air-filled middle ear. The scala tympani is closed by secondary tympanic membrane; it is also connected with the subarachnoid space through the aqueduct of cochlea. Ref:- Dhingra; pg num:-09,10",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., P. aeruginosaMalignant otitis externao Malignant otitis externa, also called necrotizing external otitis. is a misnomer as it is not a neoplastic condition, rather it is an infectious condition. Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cartilage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear. Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S.aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been reported. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other parts of the body.Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externao Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor)o Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency )o ChemotherapyClinical features of malignant otitis externao Severe pain inside the ear and may get worse when moving head.o Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cartilagenous part,o Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent.o Fevero Itching of ear or ear canalo Troubled swallowing & weakness of face.Complicationso Cranial nerve palsies most commonly facial nerve is involved. Other cranial nerves can also be involved (glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, abducens, trigeminal),o Jugular venous thrombosiso Cavernous sinus thrombosiso MeningitisTreatment of malignant otitis externao In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonalpenicillin or cephalosporin (3rd generation piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e.g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocorticoid is also used. Early cases can be managed with oral and otic fluoroquinolones only. Extensive surgical debridement once an important part of the treatment is now rarely needed.",

Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cartilage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear.* Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been reported. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other parts of the body.Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externa* Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor)* Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency)* ChemotherapyClinical features of malignant otitis externa* Severe pain inside the ear and may get worse when moving head.* Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cartilagenous part.* Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent.* Fever* Itching of ear or ear canal* Troubled swallowing & weakness of face.Complications* Cranial nerve palsies most commonly facial nerve is involved. Other cranial nerves can also be involved (glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, abducens, trigeminal).* Jugular venous thrombosis* Cavernous sinus thrombosis* MeningitisTreatment of malignant otitis externa* In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture.* IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin (3rd generation piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside.* A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside.* Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e.g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocorticoid is also used.* Early cases can be managed with oral and otic fluoroquinolones only.* Extensive surgical debridement once an important part of the treatment is now rarely needed.Radiology in malignant otitis externa* To look for signs of a bone infection next to the ear canal, the following tests may be performedi) CT scan of the head# A CT scan defines the anatomical extent of the disease and remains the initial investigation of choice.ii) MRI of the head# MRI scanning is useful for asessing the initial severity of the disease and is excellent at delineating the extent of soft tissue disease present and intracranial complications.iii) Radioisotope scans (technetium 99/gallium 67)# A base line gallium scan is obtained for comparison followed by serial scans to monitor treatment response.# Radioactive labelled white cell scans have a role in assessing the presence and degree of osteomyelitis.",

It indicates-Normal hearingQSensorineural deafnessQ. in which AC and BC are both reduced or absent.Rinne Negative: When BC is better than ACC It indicates-Conductive deafness (For Rinne test to become netgative, hearing loss has to be greater than 15 dB)Q.Rinne Equivocal: When AC and BC are both equalQ It indicates-Very mild conductive deafness (of less than 15 dB).False Rinne NegativWhen a person has severe unilateral sensorineural deafnessQ, his AC and BC are markedly reduced on the diseased side.But the patient may still indicate a better BC on the diseased side.It is due to crossing of the sound from the affected ear to the normal ear through the skull. and the patient actually hears through the opposite normal earQ.This can be avoided by masking the normal earQ.Masking is the presentation of a continuous noise to the normal ear to prevent crossing of the sound from the bad ear to the good ear.This can be achieved by:Making a rustling noise with a piece of paper in the earBaranv noise box which produces noise mechanically to block the better earAudiometry, by presenting noise to the good ear while the bad ear is being testing.

Treatment of Meniere's disease is of two typesA) Medical management B) Surgical managementMedical managemento Treatment of Meniere's disease begins first with medical managemento Medical treatment controls the condition in over two third of patientso Medical management includes1 Antihistamine labyrinthine sedatives (vestibular sedatives)Many cases can be controlled by vestibular sedatives like prochlorperazine, promethazine, dimenhydramine, and cinnarzine.2 Anxiolytic and tranquillizersMany patients are anxious, therefore they may be helped by anxiolytic and tranquillizers like diazepam.3. VasodilatorsBetahistine hydrochloride appears to be the most useful recent addition to the medical armamentarium and is routinely prescribed for most patients. It increases labyrinthine blood flow by releasing histamine.Other vasodilators employed include nicotinic acid, thymoxamine, inhaled carbogen (5% C02 with 95% 02), and histamine drip.Vasodilators increase vascularity of endolymphatic sac and its duct and thereby increases reabsorption of endolymphatic fluid.4. Diuretics (furosemide)Diuretics with fluid and salt restriction can help to control recurrent attacks if not controlled by vestibular sedatives or vasodilators.5. Other drugsPropantheline bromide, phenobarbitone and hyoscine are effective alternatives.Surgical managemento Surgical therapy for meneire's disease is reserved for medical treatment failures and is otherwise controversial. Surgical procedures can be divided into two main categoriesDestructive surgical proceduresNondestructive surgical procedureso Destructive surgical procedures : rationale is to control vertigo. Endolymphatic hydrops causes fluid pressure accumulation within the inner ear, which causes temporary malfunction and misfiring of the vestibular nerve. These abnormal signals cause vertigo. Destruction of the inner ear and / or the vestibular nerve prevents these abnormal signals. The procedures performed are :LabyrinthectomyIntermittent low pressure pulse therapy (Meniett device therapy)o Conservative surgical procedures : are used in cases where vertigo is disabling but hearing is still useful & needs to be preserved.

Not only there is improvement in veigo, tinnitus and ear fullness, but hearing may also improve. Intermittent positive pressure waves can be delivered through an instrument called Meniett device which has been approved by FDA. A prerequisite for such a therapy is to perform a myringotomy and inse a ventilation tube so that the device when coupled to the external ear canal can deliver pressure waves to the round window membrane the ventilation tube. Pressure waves pass through the perilymph and cause reduction in endolymph pressure by redistributing it through various communication channels such as the endolymphatic sac or the blood vessels. Some believe they regulate secretion of endolymph by the stria vascularis. Patient can self-administer the treatment at home.

(c) Stapedial otosclerosisRef: Logan Turners ENT 11th Ed; Page No-464Otosclerosis* Most commonly seen in third decade, i.e. 20-30 years of age.* Most commonly seen in females, with a ratio of 2:1.* It is most commonly seen in white peoples.* The most common site origin of otosclerosis is fissula ante fenestrum.* It is aggravated by any hormonal change, be it pregnancy or menopause.* It is an autosomal dominant disorder and positive family history.* Clinical features:# Patients presents with bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss (70-85%).# Otosclerosis is the most common cause of bilateral progressive conductive hearing loss in adults.# This patient gives the typical history of haring better in noisy surroundings, which is known as Paracusis willisii phenomenon. This is because the speaker raises his voice in noisy surroundings which now cross the hearings threshold of the patient.# Less commonly tinnitus can also occur in otosclerosis, particular in cochlear otosclerosis and active otosclerosis.# Sometimes otosclerosis is associated with Osteogenesis imperfecta and blue sclera, when it constitutes van dar Hoeve syndrome.* Investigation:# Tympanic membrane appears pearly white (normal) in 90% patients; it is called as mature otosclerosis.# 10% cases of otosclerosis are active. In these the active division is taking place on the medial wall of middle ear leading to increase vascularity. This appears pinkish through the intact tympanic membrane leading to flamingo pink appears of TM also known as Schwartz sign.# Audiometric test:Tuning fork testFindingsRinne'sNegativeWeber'sLateralized to the worst earABCSame as examinerSchwabachLengthenedGelle'sNegative (i.e. change in the pressure of EAC does not produce ant y change in hearings as ossicular chain is already fixed.* Pure tone Audiometry:# The audiogram of the patients shows anA-B gap > 15dB (Suggestive of conductive hearing loss). Complete fixation of foot plate leads to the maximum conductive hearing loss of 60dB.# There is typical dip at 2000Hz in the bone conduction curve. This dip is because of fixation of footplate of stapes, the natural frequency of which 2000Hz. Hence its fixation fails to transit this frequency sound.# This dip is known as \"Carhart's notch\". This dip disappears after the mobilization of footplate and stapes during the management of otosclerosis.TreatmentActive casesMature cases* Sodium fluoride (NaF):# Inactive cases i.e. when Scwartze sign is present, medial medical management with sodium fluoride is done.# NaF accelerates the maturation of the focus by increasing osteoblastic and decreasing osteolytic activity.# It also inhibits the proteolytic enzymes that release cytotoxic chemicals to Cochlea.* Surgery: In mature otosclerosis when the foot plate is fixed and active division has stopped the treatment consists of mobilization of foot plate of stapes. The surgical procedure s are:-* Stapedectomy:# Here the whole of the stapes is removed and the oval window is then covered with a fascia graft and prosthesis is placed over the graft with other end of prosthesis attached to the long process of incus.# The change of perilymph fistula, SN hearing loss and vertigo is higher in stapedectomy as compared to stapedotomy. Hence it is not preferred nowadays.# It is contraindicated in chronic nephritis, RA, pregnancy and lactation.* Bisphosphonates have also been used as they inhibit bone resorption.* Stapedotomy:# This is a more conservative and better procedure where the incudostapedial joint is separated; the Stapedial tendon is cut and the suprastructure of stapes (head, neck, anterior and posterior crura) is removed leaving the foot plate behind.# The most common prosthesis is used here Teflon piston.* Postoperative Complication:# Conductive hair loss.# Perilymph fistula# Facial nerve palsyHow to rule out other options?Meniere's disease# It is also known as endolymphatic hydrops.
