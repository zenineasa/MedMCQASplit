Antiviral therapy (Acyclovir) is a newer adjunct in treating acute facial palsy of viral origin (both Bell's palsy and Ramsay hunt syndrome). Most surgeons these days advocate combination of steroids and antiviral drugs. Physical treatmento Physical treatment includes: -Eye care: - Artificial tear drops, ocular ointment and use of sunglasses to prevent eye complication due to dry eye. Electric stimulation: - To maintain membrane conductivity and reduce muscle atrophy. o If the patient of Bell's palsy is not responding to conservative treatment, electrodiagnostic study (electrophysiological study) should be done. Electrodiagnostic study includes, electromyography (EMG), Electroneurography (ENG), minimal excitibility test and maximal excitibility test. Surgery is reserved for those who meet electrodiagnostic (electrophysiological) study criteria or are worsening on medial treatment. Surgical treatmento Nerve decompression relieves pressure on the nerve fibers and thus improves the microcirculation of the nerve. Usually vertical and tympanic segments of nerve are decompressed. However, some worker's suggest total decompression including labyrinthine segment.
