This became commonly known as \"aspirin triad.\" Following studies by Samter and Beers in the late 1960s, aspirin triad was commonly referred to as Samter's triad. (Ref: Head & Neck Surgery--otolaryngology - Volume 1 by Byron J. Bailey, Jonas T. Johnson, Shawm D. Newlands 4th ed Page 396)\"36% of the patients with aspirin intolerance may show polypi. Sampter's triad consists of nasal polypi, asthma and aspirin intolerance* (Ref: Dhingra 4th ed page 162)",
