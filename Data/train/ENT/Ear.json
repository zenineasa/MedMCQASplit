Myringotomy is done to drain suppurative or nonsuppurative fluid (effusion) of middile ear or to provide aeration in case of nonfunctional eustachian tube. Indications. Acute suppurative otitis media. Severe earache with bulging tympanic membrane. Incomplete resolution with opaque drum and persistent conductive deafness. Complications of acute otitis media, e. g. facial paralysis, labyrinthitis or meningitis with bulging tympanic membrane. Serous otitis media.

        "question": "In a patient with CSF otorrhea a cotton plug is kept in ear near Eustachian tube. A dye is injected in the sub- arachnoid space. The plug gets stained. Which of the following is most likely site of CSF leak?",
        "exp": "Ans. A. Temporal bone. CSF otorrhea# The most common cause of CSF otorrhea is trauma with fracture involving the tegmen tympani. Tegmen tympani which is formed in part by the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and the squamous portion of the temporal bone, forms the roof of the middle ear cavity. Other etiologies include perilymphatic fistula, surgeries involving the temporal bone, congenital anomalies, and destructive temporal bone tumors.# Fluid leaking from the nose or external auditory canal must first be positively identified as CSF. Drops of fluid from a CSF leak placed on absorbent filter paper may result in the double-ring sign, a central circle of blood and an outer clear ring of CSF. Serum glucose, chloride, and total protein tests of the fluid are not specific or conclusive for CSF.# Confirm or exclude the presence of CSF in leaking fluid by means of an immunoelectrophoretic study of the fluid for beta-2 transferrin or, beta-trace protein.# Methods for detecting CSF fistulas with intrathecal injections of dye pose a risk of chemical meningitis. Methylene blue, indigo carmine, and phenolsulfonphthalein (PSP) dyes are no longer in use. Some use a dilute solution of fluorescein to localize CSF fistulas both preoperatively and during surgery. Typically, is injected into the lumbar subarachnoid space over more than 1 minute. Cotton pledgets are placed in the nose. The dye reaches the skull base in 6 hours and is present over the cerebral convexities in 24 hours. The pledgets are examined for green fluorescence in a dark room with ultraviolet light 6 hours after the intrathecal PSP injection.# CT myelography is used in the detection of spinal CSF leak. CT cranial cisternography is performed with injection of 5-7 mL of nonionic myelographic contrast medium into the lumbar subarachnoid space. The patient is maintained in the prone position until a CT scan is performed. CT cistemographic findings in CSF leak include the concentration of contrast medium in portions of a paranasal sinus or within ethmoid or mastoid air cells. Occasionally, a stream of contrast medium is seen at the fistula site. Most common site for linear skull fracturesis the parietal bone, which is the thinnest of the cranial bones. Temporal bone fracturesclassified as transverse (extending across the petrous portion) or longitudinal (extending lateral to medial). Complication asso with transverse temporal bone fracture include CN VIII and CN VII injury, whereas longitudinal temporal fracture can cause hemotympanum, torn tympanic membrane, CSF leak, and conductive haering loss due to bony disruption. Basilar fracture of the temporal boneresults in \"battle sign, \" which is postauricular ecchymoses and can be associated with CSF otorrhea. A frontal basilar farcture results in\"raccoon's eyes\", which is periorbital ecchymoses. CSF rhinorrhea can result due to frontal basilar fracture. The majority of CSF leaks resolve within 7 days without surgical intervention.",

Intratympanic direct therapy for inner ear diseases has several advantages over the conventional systemic and indirect therapy: Increased therapeutic concentrations in the inner ear Reduced side-effects. Can be used when systemic therapy is contraindicated. Can be used when systemic therapy fails. In direct therapy to the inner ear, the drug is delivered at the Round window membrane. Round window membrane separates the middle ear from the inner ear. A large range of substances are able to cross the RWM, including antimicrobials, corticosteroids, anesthetics etc. Delivery methods: Typical intratympanic injection- Drug is administered directly around RWM using injection after a myringotomy. There are several drawbacks of intratympanic injection method i. e. the injected medication may leak down the Eustachian tube, escape out of the external auditory canal, or be sequestered in the middle ear. In order to address these problems, several sustained release vehicles have been developed. Gelfoam method- A dry gelfoam pad can be placed directly in the round window niche. The medication is directly injected over the gelfoam pad. Mechanical sustained release devices- there are 2 devices that are presently used for sustained release of the medication: The Silverstein Micro Wick- It is made of polyvinyl acetate. It's a wick measuring 1x9 mm small enough to fit through a tympanostomy tube. The wick absorbs medication which can be instilled into the external auditory canal by the patient at home and delivers it to the RWM. The Intra Ear Microcatheter- consists of an electronic pump connected to a catheter tip that is placed directly on the RWM. Implantation of the Microcatheter is more invasive and requires the elevation of a tympanomeatal flap. Fully implantable micro pump system- This device is made from pure titanium, polyethylene, and silicone and is designed for life-long implantation in humans. To place the device, a cavity is drilled in the mastoid bone to house the pump and the reservoir system, a procedure that is similar to the one used to place cochlear implants or implantable hearing devices. This device can deliver drugs which require chronic and continuous application.",

Scheibe's aplasia is the most common form seen in inherited congenital hearing losses, especially those having autosomal recessive inheritance. In this type of aplasia, the bony labyrinth is fully formed, as are the membranous utricle and semicircular canals. The parts inferior (saccule and cochlear duct) is represented by mounds of undifferentiated cells. The tectorial membrane is reduced in size. The scala media is collapsed and Reissner's membrane may lie directly on the mound of undifferentiated cells and the stria. The stria vascularis and organ of Corti show abortive strands of connective tissue. The wall of the saccule is flattened and lies on the aplastic sensory epithelium and otolithic membrane. Also know.

In some cases even the petrous portion of the temporal bone is not developed, whereas in others it is present but is underdeveloped at the usual site of the labyrinth. o. Mondini's aplasia has been described as a flattened cochlea with development only of the basal coil. Instead of two and one-half turns in the bony cochlea, there may be only one and one-half turns, with the middle and apical turns occupying a common space or cloaca. The vestibular structures and their associated neural elements may be similarly underdeveloped. o. Alexander's aplasia is characterized by aplasia of the cochlear duct.

It often develops after an infection of the roots of the teeth (such as tooth abscess) or a mouth injury. This condition is uncommon in children. CLinical features: There is marked difficulty in swallowing (odynophagia) with varying degrees of trismus. When infection is localized to the sublingual space, structures in the floor of mouth are swollen and tongue seems to be pushed up and back. When infection spreads to submaxillary space, submental and submandibular regions become swollen and tender, and impa woody-hard feel. Usually, there is cellulitis of the tissues rather than frank abscess. Tongue is progressively pushed upwards and backwards threatening the airway. Laryngeal oedema may appear. Complications: 1. Spread of infection to parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal spaces and thence to the mediastinum. 2. Airway obstruction due to laryngeal oedema, or swelling and pushing back of the tongue. 3.

Neonatal/Infantile Hearing Screening. American Academy of Pediatrics endorses the goal of universal detection of hearing loss in infants before 3 months of age, with appropriate intervention no later than 6 months of age. The recommended hearing screening techniques are either otoacoustic emissions (OAE) testing or auditory brainstem evoked responses (ABRs). ABR test is an auditory evoked electrophysiologic response that correlate highly with hearing. OAE tests, used successfully in most universal newborn screening programs, are quick, easy to administer & inexpensive, and they provide a sensitive indication of the presence of hearing loss. Results of OAE are relatively easy to interpret. OAE tests elicit no response if hearing is worse than 30-40 dB, no matter what's the cause. Children who fail OAE tests undergo an ABR for a more definitive evaluation. Screening methods such as observing behavioural responses to uncalibrated noisemakers or using automated systems such as the Crib-o-gram or the auditory' response cradle are not recommended. Otoacoustic Emissions. During normal hearing. OAEs originate from the hair cells in the cochlea. OAEs travel through the middle ear to the external auditory canal, where they can be detected using miniature microphones. Transient evoked OAEs (TEOAEs) may be used to check the integrity of the cochlea. In neonatal period, detection of OAEs can be accomplished during natural sleep. TEOAEs can be used as screening tests in infants and children for hearing at the 30 dB level of hearing loss. If a hearing loss is suspected based on the absence of OAEs, ears should be examined for evidence of pathology, and then ABR testing should be used for confirmation & identification of type, degree & laterality of hearing loss. Types of Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE). Spontaneous OAE (SOAEs). Sounds emitted without an acoustic stimulus (i. e, spontaneously).* SOAE are seen in 25-80% of neonates with normal hearing & absence of SOAEs is not necessarily abnormal. Transient evoked OAE (TEOAEs). Sounds emitted in response to an acoustic stimuli of very short duration; usually clicks but can be tone-bursts* TOAEs commonly are used to screen infant hearing, to validate behavioural or electrophysiologic auditory thresholds & to assess cochlear function. Distortion product OAE (DPOAEs). Sounds emitted in response to 2 simultaneous tones of different frequencies* Particularly useful for early detection of cochlear damage as they are for ototoxicity & noise-induced damage. Sustained -frequency OAE (SFOASEs). Sounds emitted in response to a continuous tone* SPOAEs are responses recorded to a continuous tone. Advantages of using OAE as a screening test: Less time consuming & cost lower than ABRInfants who fail the OAE test are then screened using ABR.",

It is a tumour of the nonolfactory mucosa of nose (Schneiderian membrane) and paranasal sinuses. Most common site of origin is lateral wall of nose in the middle meatus; less commonly it arises from the maxillary, frontal or sphenoid sinus. It is so named because hyperplastic papillomatous tissue grows into the stroma rather than in exophytic manner. Human papilloma virus is thought to be responsible for its aetiology. Clinically, men are affected more than women in the age group of 40-70. It is almost always unilateral and presents with nasal obstruction, nasal discharge and epistaxis. It can invade sinuses or orbit. Orbital involvement causes proptosis, diplopia and lacrimation. On examination of nose or endoscopy, it presents as a pale polypoidal mass resembling a simple nasal polypus or polypi. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show the location and extent of the lesion. MRI also helps to differentiate associated secretions in sinus from the actual tumour mass. Biopsy is essential for diagnosis. Care should be taken as simple nasal polypi may be associated with it or even the patient might have been operated for their removal. Treatment. Medial maxillectomy is the treatment of choice. It can be performed by lateral rhinotomy or sublabial degloving approach. These days endoscopic approach is preferred. In 10-15% of cases, it is associated with malignancy. Wider external surgical approaches may be required for tumour extending to the frontal sinus or orbit. Recurrence can occur.

Malignant otitis externao Malignant otitis externa, also called necrotizing external otitis, is a misnomer as it is not a neoplastic condition, rather it is an infectious condition. Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cartilage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear. Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been reported. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other parts of the body. Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externao Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor)o Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency)o Chemotherapy. Clinical features of malignant otitis externao Severe pain inside the ear and may get worse when moving head. o Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cartilagenous part. o Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent. o Fevero Itching of ear or ear canalo Troubled swallowing & weakness of face. Complicationso Cranial nerve palsies most commonly facial nerve is involved. Other cranial nerves can also be involved (glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, abducens, trigeminal). o Jugular venous thrombosis. o Cavernous sinus thrombosis o Meningitis. Treatment of malignant otitis externao In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonalpenicillin or cephalosporin (3rd generation piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear dropscontaining antipseudomonal antibiotic e. g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocorticoid is also used. Early cases can be managed with oral and otic fluoroquinolones only. Extensive surgical debridement once an important part of the treatment is now rarely needed.",

Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cartilage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear. Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been reported. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other parts of the body. Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externao Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor) o Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency)o Chemotherapy. Clinical features of malignant otitis externao Severe pain inside the ear and may get worse when moving head. o Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cartilagenous part. o Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent. o Fevero Itching of ear or ear canal. o Troubled swallowing & weakness of face. Complicationso Cranial nerve palsies most commonly facial nerve is involved. Other cranial nerves can also be involved (glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, abducens, trigeminal), o Jugular venous thrombosis. o Cavernous sinus thrombosiso Meningitis. Treatment of malignant otitis externao In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonalpenicillin or cephalosporin (3rdgeneration piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e. g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocorticoid is also used.

Intratympanic direct therapy for inner ear disease has several advanges over the conventional systemic and indirect therapy:* Increased therapeutic concentrations in the inner ear* Reduced side-effects* Can be used when systemic therapy is contraindicated* Can be used when systemic therapy fails. In direct therapy to the inner ear, the drug is delivered at the Round window membrane. Round window membrane separates the middle ear from the inner ear. A large range of substances are able to cross the RWM, including antimicrobials, corticosteroids, anesthetics etc. Delivery methods. Typical intratympanic injection. Gelfoam method. Mechanical sustained release devices. Fully implantable micropump system* Drug is administered directly around RWM. using injection after a myringotomy.* Drawbacks: Injected medication my leak down the Eustachian tube, escape out of the external auditory canal, or be sequestered in the middle ear* In order to address these problems, several sustained release vehicles have been developed.* A dry' gelfoam pad can be placed directly in the round window niche.* The medication is directly injected over the gelfoam pad.* The Silverstein micro wick: It is made of polyvinyl acetate. It is wick measuring 1x9 mm small enough to fit through a tympanostomy tube. The wick absorbs medication which can be instilled into the external auditory canal by the patient at home and delivers it to the RWM.* The Intra Ear Microcatehter: Consists of an electronic pump connected to catheter tip that is placed directly on the RWM Implantation of the Microcatheter is more invasive and requires the elevation of tympanomeatal flap.* This device is made from pure titanium, polyethylene, and silicone and is designed for life-long implantation in humans.* To place the device, a cavity is drilled in the mastoid bone to house the pump and the reservoir system.* This device can deliver drugs which require chronic and continuous application.",

Drawback: tracheostomy at this point violates the I51 ring of trachea and causes perichondritis of the cricoid cartilage and subglottic stenosis, so it is better avoided. Mid tracheostomy: Performed at the level of thyroid isthmus. The opening is made at the level of II, III rings. It is the preferred site for tracheostomy. Low tracheostomy: Performed below the level of thyroid isthmus. Indicated in laryngeal papillomatosis to avoid implantation. Drawback: At this level trachea lies close to several large vessels which can get injured and the tracheostomy tube impinges on suprasternal notch at this level.",

He is given a book, and told to read aloud in his natural voice, and not to stop reading when the instrument is set in action. As soon as the noise begins, a man whose opposite ear is profoundly deaf will at once raise his voice. The malingerers on the other hand, claiming a one-sided deafness which is not real, will continue to read in an even tone or in a tone only slightly elevated.

As (Ref: Dhingra 4/e p25, 88) A 35 years old pregnant female complained of hearing loss, which was aggravated during pregnancy: This patient is most probably suffering from otosclerosis, which is more common in females and aggravated during pregnancy. Type As tympanogram is seen in otosclerosis'People of African-American descent rarely have otosclerosis - it is usually a condition found in persons of Caucasian or Oriental descent. Women are affected twice as often as men, and pregnancy often has an adverse effect. Otosclerosis is often discovered during or just after pregnancy. The effect of hormone supplements post-menopause is unknown.

The study confirms previous reports that pregnancy does involve a risk of aggravating deafness in clinical otosclerosis. '- style=\"width: 49pt; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif\">Types of Tympanogram. Type ANormal tympanogram. Type ASCompliance is lower at or near ambient air pressure. Seen in fixation of ossicles, e. g. OtosclerosisQ or Malleus fixation. QType ADHigh compliance at or near ambient pressure. Seen in ossicular discontinuityQ or thin and lax tympanic membrane. QType BA flat or dome shaped graph. No change in compliance with pressure changes Seen in middle ear fluidQ or thick tympanic membrane. QType CMaximum compliance occurs with negative pressure in excess of 100 mm of H2O. Seen in retracted tympanic membraneQ and may show some fluid in middle ear. QRemember: AS (S) for Sclerosis and AD (D) for discontinuity. Otosclerosis (Otospongiosis). Disease of bony labyrinth where the normal dense enchondral bone is replaced by foci of irregularly laid spongy boneQ. 50% patients have positive family history, inherited as autosomal dominantQ. White racesQ are affected more than negroes. FemalesQ are more common than males. Pregnancy aggravates otosclerosis. Age of onset is around puberty. Types of otosclerosis: 1. Stapedial Otosclerosis: The part most commonly involved in otosclerosis is Oval window. Stapedial otosclerosis causing stapes fixation and conductive deafness is the most common varietyQ. Lesion starts just in front of the oval window in an area called fissula ante fenestrum2. Cochlear Otosclerosis: Involves region of round window. Q3. Histologic Otosclerosis: Remains asymptomatic. QClinical Presentation: Painless and progressive, bilateral (often) conductive hearing loss/deafness is presenting symptom. QParacusis wilsiiQ: Patient hears better in noisy than quiet environment. Tinnitus, vertigo and monotonous speechQ are other features. Tympanic membrane is usually normal and mobile. QSchwartz SignQ: A reddish hue or Flamingo pink tinge maybe seen on the promontory through the tympanic membrane, indicating a focus of increased vascularity. Carhartz notchQ: A dip in bone conduction may be seen which is different at different frequencies but maximum at 2000 HzQ. Treatment: There is no medical treatment that cures otosclerosis, sodium fluorideQ has been used to attain maturity of active focus. Stapedectomy with prosthesis replacement is the treatment of choice. QHearing aidQ for patients who refuses or unfit for surgery",

This results in a red reflex through the intact tympanic membrane. Sometimes, eardrum may be bluish and bulging. o Pulsation sign (Brown sign) is positive, i. e. when ear canal pressure is raised with Siegle's speculum, tumor pulsates vigorously and then blanches; reverse happens with release of pressure. o Aquino sign is positive, i. e. blanching of mass with manual compression of ipsilateral carotid artery. o When the tumour perforates the eardrum a polypus will be seen in the meatus and this will bleed profusely if touchedo Cranial nerve palsies is a late feature appearing several years after aural symptoms. IXth to XIIth cranial nerves may be paralysed.

        "exp": "ANSWER: (B) Sensory neural hearing loss. REF: Dhingra 4th ed page 38, Otolaryngology Basic science and clinical review by Thomas. R. Va p. 327. PRESBYCUSIS: Sensory neural hearing loss associated with physiological aging process in the ear is called presbycusis. It usually manifests at the age of 65 years but may do so early if there is hereditary predisposition, chronic noise exposure or generalized vascular disease. Clinical features: Patients of presbycusis have great difficulty in hearing in the presence of background noise though (he may hear well in quiet surroundings). They may complain of speech being heard but not understood. Recruitment phenomenon is positive and all the sounds suddenly become intolerable when volume is raised. Tinnitus is another troublesome problem and in some it is the only complaint. Causes: Although the precise etiology of presbycusis is currently not known, the cause of presbycusis is generally agreed to be multifactorial. Proposed causes include the following: Arteriosclerosis: Diabetes accelerates the process of atherosclerosis, diffuse proliferation and hypertrophy of the vascular intimal endothelium and brainstem neuropathy. Diets high in antioxidants such as vitamins C and E reduce the progression of presbycusis. Accumulated exposure to noise. Drug and environmental chemical exposure. Stress. Genetics. Investigations: Audiometric testing with pure-tone average and speech discrimination forms the cornerstone of diagnostic testing for presbycusis. Based upon audiometry and histopathology presbycusis is classified as. Type. Audiometry Sensorypresbycusis. Sharply down-sloping bilateral symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss. Higher frequencies are affected but speech discrimination remains good. Degeneration of the organ of corti, starting at the basal coil and progressing gradually to the apex. Neuralpresbycusis. Slowly descending audiometric pattern, worse in the high frequencies, and a significant decrements in speech discrimination. Degeneration of the coils of spiral ganglion, starting at the basal coil and progressing to the apex. Strial or metabolic. Audiomety is flat but speech discrimination is good. Atrophy of the stria vascularis in all turns of cochlea. Cochlearconductive. Sloping type audiogram. This is due to stiffening of the basilar membrane thus affecting its movements. Treatment: Patients of presbycusis can be helped by a hearing aid. They should also have lessons in speech reading through visual cues. Curtailment of smoking and stimulants like tea and coffee may help to decrease tinnitus.",

Intraneural: electrodes placed directly in the modiolus# To ensure the success of inserting electrode arrary into the scala tympani, many authors in the field of cochlear implant have been successful in performing cochleostomy from the promontory rather than going through the round window niche.# The classical surgical technique of cochleostomy is by the facial recess approach and through the round window niche.

Here, middle ear implies middle ear cleft, i. e. eustachian tube, middle ear, attic, aditus, antrum and mastoid air cells. ROUTES OF INFECTION 1. Via eustachian tube: It is the most common route. Infection travels the lumen of the tube or along subepithelial peritubal lymphatics. Eustachian tube in infants and young children is shoer, wider and more horizontal and thus may account for higher incidence of infections in this age group. Breast or bottle feeding in a young infant in horizontal position may force fluids through the tube into the middle ear and hence the need to keep the infant propped up with head a little higher. Swimming and diving can also force water through the tube into the middle ear. 2. Via external ear: Traumatic perforations of tympanic membrane due to any cause open a route to middle ear infection. 3. Blood-borne: This is an uncommon route. AETIOLOGY: It is more common especially in infants and children of lower socioeconomic group. Bacteriology: Most common organisms in infants and young children are Streptococcus pneumoniae (30%), Haemophilus influenzae (20%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (12%).

Presence of a painful lesion in the external ear with the evidence of granulation tissue and associated cranial nerve palsies (VII nerve) in a diabetic (or immunocompromised) patient suggest a diagnosis of malignant otitis externa. Severe hearing loss is not the chief presenting complaint malignant otitis externa. Malignant Otitis Externa: Characterized by granulation tissue in external auditory canal at the junction of bone and cartilage. MC organism: Pseudomonas aeruginosa. QESR is raised, used for follow up of treatment. Malignant Otitis Externa (Necrotizing Otitis Externa/ Skull Base Osteomyelitis). Progressive debilitating and sometimes fatal infection of the external auditory canal. QCharacterized by granulation tissue in external auditory canal at the junction of bone and cartilageQ. MC organism: Pseudomonas aeruginosa. QPathophysiolology: Characterized by necrotizing vasculitis. QThe infection does not spread through the pneumatized air tracts of the temporal bone. The otic capsule appears to be resistant to the disease process. Extensive destruction in the wall of the bony external auditory canal and osteomyelitic destruction of the wall of the fallopian canal in the descending portion of the facial nerve is seen. The infection spreads beneath the otic capsule to erode the wall of the carotid canal and then extended into the central skull base. Predisposing Factors: Diabetes (90% of patients), AIDS, aural irrigation. Features: Occurs commonly in elderly diabetic (>60 years), immunosuppressed patients or patients who have received radiotherapy to skull base. QMore common in males. MC nerve involved: VII (Facial)Q; Others: IX, X, XI, XIIQSevere, unrelenting, deep-seated otalgia, temporal headaches, purulent otorrhea, possibly dysphagia, hoarseness, and/or facial nerve dysfunction. The pain is out of proportion to the physical examination findings. Marked tenderness is present in the soft tissue between the mandible ramus and mastoid tip. Granulation tissue is present at the floor of the osseo-cartiliginous junction. This finding is virtually pathognomonic of malignant external otitis. Otoscopic examination may also reveal exposed bone. The tympanic membrane is usually intact. Spread of the infection. Diagnosis: Investigation: CT scan, gallium and technetium-99 scintigraphy. The leukocyte count is usually normal or mildly elevated. ESR is raised. CT scanning and MRI is both useful for evaluating the anatomic extent of soft tissue inflammation, abscess formation, and intracranial complications. MRI is more sensitive for detecting intracranial complications. Treatment: Correction of immunosuppression (when possible), local treatment of the auditory canal, long-term systemic antibiotic therapy, and in selected patients, surgery. In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. IV antibiotics are directed against the offending organism. Extensive surgical debridement once an important part of the treatment is now rarely needed. Prognosis: High mortality rate (So termed as malignant)",

Vagus Nerve: Pharyngeal & Laryngeal lesions. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF NERVESAuriculotemporal Nerve Clinical significance: Is frequently injured in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery, causing an ipsi-lateral parasthesia of the auricle and skin surrounding the ear. After a parotidectomy, the nerves from the Auriculotemporal Nerve that previously innervated the parotid gland can reattach to the sweat glands in the same region & causes sweating along the cheek with the consumption of foods (Frey's syndrome). Pain from parotitis, a condition that can be caused by mumps, will be carried by the auriculotemporal nerve tc the brain. [?]. Facial nerve Clinical significance: Acute facial nerve paralysis is usually manifested by facial paralysis. Bell's palsy is one type of idiopathic acute facial nerve paralysis, which is more accurately described as a multiple cranial nerve ganglionitis that involves the facial nerve, and most likely results from viral infection and also sometimes as a result of Lyme disease. [?]. Vagus nerve Clinical significance: Vagotomy is a now-obsolete therapy that was performed for peptic ulcer disease. Highly selective vagotomy is indicated for Peptic ulcer disease. Vagotomy is currently being researched as a less invasive alternative weight-loss procedure to gastric bypass surgery. Neuropathy in Chagas disease spreads in part via major parasympathetic branches of vagus nerve. Since the tonsils and tonsillar fossa are supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve, any irritation or pain can be referred to the ear along the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal (Jacobson's) nerve.",

        "exp": "THE INTERNAL EAR The internal ear or the labyrinth is an impoant organ of hearing and balance. It consists of a bony and a membranous labyrinth. The membranous labyrinth is filled with a clear fluid called endolymph while the space between membranous and bony labyrinths is filled with perilymph. BONY LABYRINTH It consists of three pas: the vestibule, the semicircular canals and the cochlea. Cochlea: The bony cochlea is a coiled tube making 2. 5 to 2. 75 turns round a central pyramid of bone called modiolus. The base of modiolus is directed towards internal acoustic meatus and transmits vessels and nerves to the cochlea. Around the modiolus and winding spirally like the thread of a screw, is a thin plate of bone called osseous spiral lamina. It divides the bony cochlea incompletely and gives attachment to the basilar membrane. The bony bulge in the medial wall of middle ear, the promontory, is due to the basal coil of the cochlea. The bony cochlea contains three compaments: (a) Scala vestibuli, (b) Scala tympani, (c) Scala media or the membranous cochlea. The scala vestibuli and scala tympani are filled with peri- lymph and communicate with each other at the apex of cochlea through an opening called helicotrema. Scala vestibuli is closed by the footplate of stapes which separates it from the air-filled middle ear. The scala tympani is closed by secondary tympanic membrane; it is also connected with the subarachnoid space through the aqueduct of cochlea. Ref:- Dhingra; pg num:-09, 10",

Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cartilage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear. Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been reported. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other parts of the body. Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externao Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor)o Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency )o Chemotherapy. Clinical features of malignant otitis externao Severe pain inside the ear and may get worse when moving head. o Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cartilagenous part, o Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent. o Fevero Itching of ear or ear canalo Troubled swallowing & weakness of face.

Treatment of malignant otitis externao In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonalpenicillin or cephalosporin (3rd generation piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e. g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocorticoid is also used.

Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cartilage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear.* Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been reported. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other parts of the body. Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externa* Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor)* Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency)* Chemotherapy. Clinical features of malignant otitis externa* Severe pain inside the ear and may get worse when moving head.* Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cartilagenous part.* Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent.* Fever* Itching of ear or ear canal* Troubled swallowing & weakness of face. Complications* Cranial nerve palsies most commonly facial nerve is involved. Other cranial nerves can also be involved (glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, abducens, trigeminal).* Jugular venous thrombosis* Cavernous sinus thrombosis* Meningitis. Treatment of malignant otitis externa* In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture.* IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin (3rd generation piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside.* A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside.* Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e. g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocorticoid is also used.* Early cases can be managed with oral and otic fluoroquinolones only.* Extensive surgical debridement once an important part of the treatment is now rarely needed. Radiology in malignant otitis externa* To look for signs of a bone infection next to the ear canal, the following tests may be performedi) CT scan of the head# A CT scan defines the anatomical extent of the disease and remains the initial investigation of choice. ii) MRI of the head# MRI scanning is useful for asessing the initial severity of the disease and is excellent at delineating the extent of soft tissue disease present and intracranial complications. iii) Radioisotope scans (technetium 99/gallium 67)# A base line gallium scan is obtained for comparison followed by serial scans to monitor treatment response.# Radioactive labelled white cell scans have a role in assessing the presence and degree of osteomyelitis.",

Treatment of Meniere's disease is of two typesA) Medical management B) Surgical management. Medical managemento Treatment of Meniere's disease begins first with medical managemento Medical treatment controls the condition in over two third of patientso Medical management includes1 Antihistamine labyrinthine sedatives (vestibular sedatives). Many cases can be controlled by vestibular sedatives like prochlorperazine, promethazine, dimenhydramine, and cinnarzine. 2 Anxiolytic and tranquillizers. Many patients are anxious, therefore they may be helped by anxiolytic and tranquillizers like diazepam. 3. Vasodilators. Betahistine hydrochloride appears to be the most useful recent addition to the medical armamentarium and is routinely prescribed for most patients. It increases labyrinthine blood flow by releasing histamine. Other vasodilators employed include nicotinic acid, thymoxamine, inhaled carbogen (5% C02 with 95% 02), and histamine drip. Vasodilators increase vascularity of endolymphatic sac and its duct and thereby increases reabsorption of endolymphatic fluid. 4. Diuretics (furosemide). Diuretics with fluid and salt restriction can help to control recurrent attacks if not controlled by vestibular sedatives or vasodilators. 5. Other drugs. Propantheline bromide, phenobarbitone and hyoscine are effective alternatives. Surgical managemento Surgical therapy for meneire's disease is reserved for medical treatment failures and is otherwise controversial. Surgical procedures can be divided into two main categories. Destructive surgical procedures. Nondestructive surgical procedureso Destructive surgical procedures: rationale is to control vertigo. Endolymphatic hydrops causes fluid pressure accumulation within the inner ear, which causes temporary malfunction and misfiring of the vestibular nerve. These abnormal signals cause vertigo. Destruction of the inner ear and / or the vestibular nerve prevents these abnormal signals. The procedures performed are: Labyrinthectomy. Intermittent low pressure pulse therapy (Meniett device therapy)o Conservative surgical procedures: are used in cases where vertigo is disabling but hearing is still useful & needs to be preserved. They are: Decompression of endolymphatic sac. Endolymphatic shunt operation. Sacculotomy (Fick's operation & Cody's tack procedure). Vestibular neuronectomy. Ultrasonic destruction of vestibular labyrinth to preserve cochlear function. Stellate ganglion block or cervical sympathectomy. Intratympanic gentamycin. Vestibular nerve section",

There is painless necrosis of tympanic membrane. Multiple perforations may form which coalesce to form a single large perforation. Middle ear and mastoid get filled with pale granulations. Caries of bone and ossicles may occur leading to complications.

Not only there is improvement in veigo, tinnitus and ear fullness, but hearing may also improve.

A prerequisite for such a therapy is to perform a myringotomy and inse a ventilation tube so that the device when coupled to the external ear canal can deliver pressure waves to the round window membrane the ventilation tube. Pressure waves pass through the perilymph and cause reduction in endolymph pressure by redistributing it through various communication channels such as the endolymphatic sac or the blood vessels.

The lasing medium can be solid (ruby, Nd: YAG or potassium titanyl phosphate); gas (CO2 or Helium-Neon) or liquid (pumped inorganic dye in a glass tube). CO2 laser: Wavelength 10, 400 nm, invisible, requires an aiming beam of a helium-neon laser, cannot pass through flexible optical fibers and requires aiculated arm with a series of reflective mirrors to direct the beam to the target area. Clinically it has been used in laryngeal surgery to excise vocal nodules, polyps, cysts, granulomas or juvenile laryngeal papillomas. It cuts precisely and a spot size of 0. 3 mm can be achieved; lesion is first delineated and then dissected with microlaryngeal instruments. Microflaps can be raised to treat Reinke's edema. It is also used for leukoplakia, T1 lesion of vocal cord or localized lesions of supraepiglottis and infraepiglottis. Transverse cordotomy and endoscopic paial or complete arytenoidectomy can also be done in bilateral abductor paralysis. CO2 does not penetrate into the deep tissue, hence there is decreased risk of scarring. Ref: Dhingra; 6th edition; Chapter 71; Page no: 357",
