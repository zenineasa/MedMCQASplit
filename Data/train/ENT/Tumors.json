An elderly male presents with T3. N0 laryngeal carcinoma. Treatment is concurrent chemoradiotherapy. 'Advanced laryngeal cancers are often treated by combining radiation with concurrent chemotherapy for larynx preservation and total laryngectomy for bulky T4 disease or salvage.

''Concomitant Cisplatin with radiation therapy resulted in a 41% reduction in risk of locoregional failure compared with radiation therapy alone. ' Cancer Larynx* It is 10 times more common in malesQ than females.* Disease is mostly seen in the age group of 40-70 yearsQ.* Both tobaccoQ and alcoholQ are well established risk factor in laryngeal cancer.* Cigarette smoke contains benzopyrene and other hydrocarbons which are carcinogenic in man.* About 90-95% of laryngeal malignancies are squamous cell carcinomaQ with various grades of differentiation.* Cordal lesions are often well-differentiatedQ while supraglottic ones are Anaplastic. 1. Supraglottic Cancer:- Supraglottic cancer is Jess frequent than glottic cancerQ.- Nodal metastases occur earlyQ, upper and middle jugular nodes are often involved.- Bilateral metastases may be seen in cases of epiglottic cancer.- Pain on swallowing is the most frequent initial symptomQ.- Mass in the neck may be the first sign.- Hoarseness is a late symptom.- Pain may be referred to ear by way of vagus nerve and auricular nerve of ArnoldQ. 2. Glottic Cancer:- It is MC site of CA LarynxQ- Mostly originates from free edge and upper surface of anterior 1/3rd of true vocal cordQ followed by middle third 1 /3rd. Spread locally to anterior commissure than to opposite cord (conus elasticus initially acts as barrier for subglottic spreadQ).- Fixation of vocal cord indicates spread of disease to thyroaretenoid muscle and is a bad prognostic signQ.- As vocal cord is free of lymphatics, nodal metastases is never seen in cordal cancer, unless the disease spread beyond membranous cord.- Hoarseness is MC and the earliest symptomQ because of this glottic cancer is detected early. 3. Subglottic Cancer:- Least common siteQ.- Subglottic region extends from glottic area to lower border of cricoid cartilage.- Spreads locally around anterior wall to opposite side or down wrards to trachea, upwrard spread to vocal cord is late and hoarseness is not an early symptomQ- Lymphatic metastases to prelaryngeal, pretracheal (Delphian nodeQ) and lower jugular nodes.- Earliest and most prominent symptom is stridorQ, but it appears only in advanced stage.

Paragangliomas of the temporal bone are generally divided into. Those that originate within the middle ear: Glomus tympankum tumors. Those that originate within the jugular fossa: Glomus jugulare tumors. Classification systems that have been developed for temporal bone paragangliomas are used for staging purposes. Surgical planning and comparison among different therapeutic modalities. The Glasscock-Jackson and Fisch classifications are the most widely employed. Glasscock-Jackson Classification of Temporal Bone Paragangliomas. Type I- Small tumor involving the jugular bulb, middle ear and mastoid. Type II- Tumor extending under internal auditory canal: might have intracranial extension. Type III- Tumor extending into petrous apex: might have intracranial extension. Type IV- Tumor extending beyond petrous apex into clivus or infratemporal fossa: might have intracranial extension. Fisch Classification of Temporal Bone Paragangliomas. Class A: Tumors limited to the middle ear cleft. Class B: Tumors limited to the tympanomastoid area without destruction of bone in the infralabyrinthine compartment. Class C: Tumors extending into and destroying bone of the infralabyrinthine and apical compartments of the temporal bone. Cl: Tumors destroying the bone of the jugular foramen and jugular bulb with limited involvement of the vertical portion of the carotid canal. C2: Tumors destroying the infralabyrinthine compartment of the temporal bone and invading the vertical portion of the carotid canal. C3: Tumors involving the infralabyrinthine and apical compartments of the temporal bone with invasion of the horizontal portion of the carotid canal. Class D: Tumors with intracranial extension.

It is the most common benign neoplasm of middle ear and is so-named because of its origin from the glomus bodies. The latter resemble carotid body in structure and are found in the dome of jugular bulb or on the promontory along the course of tympanic branch of IXth cranial nerve (Jacobson's nerve). The tumor is often seen in the middle age (40-50 years). Females are affected five times more. Types: Glomus jugulare: They arise from the dome of Jugular bulb, invade the hypotympanum and jugular foramen, causing neurological signs of IXth to Xllth cranial nerve involvement. Glomus tympanicum: They arise from the promontory of the middle ear and cause aural symptoms, some times with facial paralysis. Clinical Features1. When tumor is intra tympanic: Earliest symptoms are deafness and tinnitus. Deafness is conductive and slowly progressive. Tinnitus is pulsatile and of swishing character, synchronous with pulse, and can be temporarily stopped by carotid pressure. Otoscopy shows a red reflex through intact tympanic membrane. ' Rising sun' appearance is seen when tumor arises from the floor of middle ear. \"Pulsation sign\" (Brown s sign) is positive, i. e. when ear canal pressure is raised with Siegle's speculum. When tumor presents as a polyp: In addition to deafness and tinnitus, there is history of profuse bleeding from the ear. Dizziness or vertigo and facial paralysis may appear, Cranial nerve palsies: This is a late feature appearing several years after aural symptoms. IXth to XIIth cranial nerves may be paralyzed.",
