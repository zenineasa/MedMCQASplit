It is the most commonly used method. 2) Artificial larynx:- Who fail to learn esophageal speech. The devices include: (i) Electrolarynx and (ii) Transoral pneumatic device. 3) Tracheo-esophageal speech:- Attempt is made to carry air from trachea to esophagus or hypopharynx by creation of skin-lined fistula or by placement of an artificial prosthesis.",

Clinical presentationo Most patients with aberrant right subclavian arteries do not have symptoms. Some present with mild dysphagia, while a small minority have a severe enough disturbance in swallowing that leads to inability to swallow and severe nutritional problems. o In children, the most common presentations are stridor and recurrent chest infections, may be due to their tracheal softening comparing to adult population. o The diagnosis of dysphagia lusoria is always difficult and late as the symptoms are often nonspecific and in the same time, diagnostic endoscopy is negative in more than 50% cases, and manometry has no diagnostic roleo Compression of the oesophagus by the aberrant right subclavian artery can be exacerbated by atherosclerosis or aneurysmal dilatation.",
