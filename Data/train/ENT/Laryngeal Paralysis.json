In bilateral abductor paralysis or B/L RLN palsy presentation is stridor because of which it is also known as life threatening palsy. In bilateral adductor paralysis, i. e. B/L complete paralysis, there will be aspiration bronchopneumonias but the presentation will not be acute life threatening in comparison to stridor in B/L RLN palsy. The remaining two options are not life threatening",
