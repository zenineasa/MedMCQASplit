Treatment Voice rest and speech therapy (Speech therapy re-education in voice production are essential in preventing recurrence) Microlaryngoscopic excision of nodules--Using microsurgical instruments or laser differential diagnosis is VOCAL CORD POLYP- Usually unilateral at the junction of anterior and middle third of vocal cord. caused by Voice abuse, chronic irritation like smoking Sudden shouting results in hemorrhage and submucosal edema. Treatment is Microlaryngeal excision. Acute laryngitis is a temporary condition caused by overusing the vocal cords. It can also be caused by an infection.
