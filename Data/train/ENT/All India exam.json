        "question": "A person present with cribriform plate fracture with CSF rhinorrhea. What will be immediate treatment?",
        "exp": "TREATMENT OF CSF RHINORRHEA Early cases of post-traumatic CSF rhinorrhoea can be managed by conservative measures such as bed rest, elevating the head of the bed, stool softeners, and avoidance of nose blowing, sneezing and straining. Prophylactic antibiotics can be used to prevent meningitis. Acetazolamide decreases CSF formation. These measures can be combined with lumbar drain if indicated. Surgical repair can be done by the following: 1. Neurosurgical intracranial approach. 2. Extradural approaches such as external ethmoidectomy for cribriform plate and ethmoid area, trans-septal sphenoidal approach for sphenoid and osteoplastic flap approach for frontal sinus leak. 3. Transnasal endoscopic approach. With the advent of endoscopic surgery for nose and sinuses, most of the leaks from the anterior cranial fossa and sphenoid sinus can be managed endoscopically with a success rate of 90% with first attempt. Principles of repair include: (a) Defining the sites of bony areas. It can be (i) Cribriform plate (ii) Lateral lamina close to anterior ethmoid aery (iii) Roof of ethmoid (iv) Frontal sinus leak (v) Sphenoid sinus (b) Preparation of graft site. (c) Underlay grafting of the fascia extradurally followed by placement of mucosa (as a free graft or pedicled flap) (d) If bony defect is larger than 2 cm, it is repaired with cailage (from nasal septum or auricular concha) followed by placement of mucosa. (e) Placement of surgicel and gelfoam fuher strengthens the area. This is followed by a high antibiotic smeared nasal pack. Sometimes fat from the thigh or abdomen is used to plug the defect in place of fascia graft. (f) Lumbar drain if CSF pressure is high. (g) Antibiotics CSF leak from frontal sinus often requires osteoplastic flap, operation and obliteration of the sinus with fat. Ref: ENT textbook by Dhingra 6th edition Pgno: 163-165",

It is divided into two pas: bony, which is posterolateral, forms one-third (12 mm) of the total length and fibrocailaginous, which is anteromedial, forms two-thirds (24 mm). The two pas meet at isthmus which is the narrowest pa of the tube. The fibrocailaginous pa of the tube is made of a single piece of cailage folded upon itself in such a way that it forms the whole of medial lamina, roof and a pa of the lateral lamina; the rest of its lateral Lamina is made of fibrous membrane. The tympanic end of the tube is bony, measures 5 x 2 mm and is situated in the anterior wall of middle ear, a little above the level of floor. The pharyngeal end of the tube is slit-like, veically. The cailage at this end raises an elevation called torus tubarius, which is situated in the lateral wall of the nasopharynx, 1-1. 25 cm behind the posterior end of inferior turbinate.

ABDUCTOR DYSPHONIA It is due to spasms of posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (the only abductor) and thus keeping the glottis open. Patient gets a breathy voice or breathy breaks in voice. The condition is gradually progressive and the symptoms get aggravated during periods of stress or when patient uses telephone. Like adductor spasm dysphonia, cause of abductor spasmodic dysphonia is not known. Treatment is injection of botulinum toxin in posterior cricoarytenoid muscles. It can be done by percutaneous or endoscopic route. The former being used with EMG guidance. Results of injection are not as good as in adductor spasmodic dysphonia. Only about 50% of patients improve and the duration of improvement is also less. Disadvantages of injection treatment are that it may compromise vocal cord movements with respiration leading to airway obstruction. Patients who do not respond to toxin injection can be treated by thyroplasty type I or fat injection. A prior gelfoam injection can be used to judge the effectiveness of the above procedure. Speech therapy should be combined with injection treatment as speech therapy alone may not be effective. Ref: ENT textbook by Dhingra 6th edition Pgno: 314, 315",

This form is specifically caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and tends to affect elderly diabetics and AIDS patients, causing the findings illustrated in the question stem. It is paicularly worrisome both because the Pseudomonas organism is so tissue destructive and because it is often highly resistant to most intravenous antibiotics. (Consult your local microbiology or pharmacology depaments for advice about local sensitivities if you encounter the condition.) Complications can be devastating, including deafness, facial nerve paralysis, osteomyelitis, and meningitis. Escherichia colic a cause both external otitis and acute otitis media, but does not usually cause malignant external otitis. Haemophilus influenzae is an impoant cause of acute otitis media. Proteus Vulgaris can cause external otitis but does not usually cause the malignant form. Staphylococcus aureus can cause external otitis but does not usually cause the malignant form.",

It usually manifests at the age of 65 years but may do so early if there is hereditary predisposition, chronic noise exposure or generalized vascular disease. Four pathological types of presbycusis have been identified. 1. Sensory. This is characterized by degeneration of the organ of Coi, staing at the basal coil and progressing gradually to the apex. Higher frequencies are affected but speech discrimination remains good. 2. Neural. This is characterized by degeneration of the cells of spiral ganglion, staing at the basal coil and progressing to the apex. Neurons of higher auditory pathways may also be affected. This manifests with high tone loss but speech discrimination is poor and out of propoion to the pure tone loss. 3. Strial or metabolic. This is characterized by atrophy of stria vascularis in all turns of cochlea. In this, the physical and chemical processes of energy production are affected. It runs in families. Audiogram is flat but speech discrimination is good. 4. Cochlear conductive. This is due to stiffening of the basilar membrane thus affecting its movements. Audiogram is sloping type. Patients of presbycusis have great difficulty in hearing in the presence of background noise though they may hear well in quiet surroundings. They may complain of speechbeing heard but not understood. Recruitment phenomenon is positive and all the sounds suddenly become intolerable when volume is raised. Tinnitus is another bothersome problem and in some it is the only complaint. Patients of presbycusis can be helped by a hearing aid. They should also have lessons in speech reading through Visual cues. Cuailment of smoking and stimulants like tea and coffee may help to decrease tinnitus.
