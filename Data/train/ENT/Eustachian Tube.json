This child is suffering from adenotonsillar hypertrophy which is causing recurrent URTI, mouth breathing, failure to grow and high-arched palate. Hypertrophied adenoids may have led to Eustachian tube blockade with a resultant SOM which explains impaired hearing. So the treatment is adenoidectomy with grommet insertion. It is understood that the grommet has to be put by radial Myringotomy in the antero-inferior quadrant.",
