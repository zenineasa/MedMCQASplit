Other etiologies include perilymphatic fistula, surgeries involving the temporal bone, congenital anomalies, and destructive temporal bone tumors.# Fluid leaking from the nose or external auditory canal must first be positively identified as CSF. Drops of fluid from a CSF leak placed on absorbent filter paper may result in the double-ring sign, a central circle of blood and an outer clear ring of CSF. Serum glucose, chloride, and total protein tests of the fluid are not specific or conclusive for CSF.# Confirm or exclude the presence of CSF in leaking fluid by means of an immunoelectrophoretic study of the fluid for beta-2 transferrin or, beta-trace protein.# Methods for detecting CSF fistulas with intrathecal injections of dye pose a risk of chemical meningitis. Methylene blue, indigo carmine, and phenolsulfonphthalein (PSP) dyes are no longer in use. Some use a dilute solution of fluorescein to localize CSF fistulas both preoperatively and during surgery. Typically, is injected into the lumbar subarachnoid space over more than 1 minute. Cotton pledgets are placed in the nose. The dye reaches the skull base in 6 hours and is present over the cerebral convexities in 24 hours. The pledgets are examined for green fluorescence in a dark room with ultraviolet light 6 hours after the intrathecal PSP injection.# CT myelography is used in the detection of spinal CSF leak. CT cranial cisternography is performed with injection of 5-7 mL of nonionic myelographic contrast medium into the lumbar subarachnoid space. The patient is maintained in the prone position until a CT scan is performed. CT cistemographic findings in CSF leak include the concentration of contrast medium in portions of a paranasal sinus or within ethmoid or mastoid air cells. Occasionally, a stream of contrast medium is seen at the fistula site. Most common site for linear skull fracturesis the parietal bone, which is the thinnest of the cranial bones. Temporal bone fracturesclassified as transverse (extending across the petrous portion) or longitudinal (extending lateral to medial). Complication asso with transverse temporal bone fracture include CN VIII and CN VII injury, whereas longitudinal temporal fracture can cause hemotympanum, torn tympanic membrane, CSF leak, and conductive haering loss due to bony disruption. Basilar fracture of the temporal boneresults in \"battle sign, \" which is postauricular ecchymoses and can be associated with CSF otorrhea. A frontal basilar farcture results in\"raccoon's eyes\", which is periorbital ecchymoses. CSF rhinorrhea can result due to frontal basilar fracture. The majority of CSF leaks resolve within 7 days without surgical intervention.",

        "exp": "Ans is 'd' i. e. Delivering drug to the round membrane Repeat from Nov 08. Micro Wick and Microcatheter are methods of delivery of medications directly to the inner ear. Intratympanic direct therapy for inner ear diseases has several advantages over the conventional systemic and indirect therapy: Increased therapeutic concentrations in the inner ear Reduced side-effects. Can be used when systemic therapy is contraindicated. Can be used when systemic therapy fails. In direct therapy to the inner ear, the drug is delivered at the Round window membrane. Round window membrane separates the middle ear from the inner ear. A large range of substances are able to cross the RWM, including antimicrobials, corticosteroids, anesthetics etc. Delivery methods: Typical intratympanic injection- Drug is administered directly around RWM using injection after a myringotomy. There are several drawbacks of intratympanic injection method i. e. the injected medication may leak down the Eustachian tube, escape out of the external auditory canal, or be sequestered in the middle ear. In order to address these problems, several sustained release vehicles have been developed. Gelfoam method- A dry gelfoam pad can be placed directly in the round window niche. The medication is directly injected over the gelfoam pad. Mechanical sustained release devices- there are 2 devices that are presently used for sustained release of the medication: The Silverstein Micro Wick- It is made of polyvinyl acetate. It's a wick measuring 1x9 mm small enough to fit through a tympanostomy tube. The wick absorbs medication which can be instilled into the external auditory canal by the patient at home and delivers it to the RWM. The Intra Ear Microcatheter- consists of an electronic pump connected to a catheter tip that is placed directly on the RWM. Implantation of the Microcatheter is more invasive and requires the elevation of a tympanomeatal flap. Fully implantable micro pump system- This device is made from pure titanium, polyethylene, and silicone and is designed for life-long implantation in humans. To place the device, a cavity is drilled in the mastoid bone to house the pump and the reservoir system, a procedure that is similar to the one used to place cochlear implants or implantable hearing devices. This device can deliver drugs which require chronic and continuous application.",

Its early manifestations resemble diffuse otitis externa but there is excruciating pain and appearance of granulations in the ear canal. Facial paralysis is common. Infection may spread to the skull base and jugular foramen causing multiple cranial nerve palsies. Anteriorly, infection spreads to temporomandibular fossa, posteriorly to the mastoid and medially into the middle ear and petrous bone. Diagnosis: Severe otalgia in an elderly diabetic patient with granulation tissue in the external ear canal at its cailaginous-bony junction should ale the physician of necrotizing otitis externa. CT scan may show bony destruction but is often not helpful. Gallium-67 is more useful in diagnosis and follow-up of the patient. It is taken up by monocytes and reticuloendothelial cells, and is indicative of soft tissue infection. It can be repeated every 3 weeks to monitor the disease and response to treatment.

Its early manifestations resemble diffuse otitis externa but there is excruciating pain and appearance of granulations in the meatus. Facial paralysis is common. Infection may spread to the skull base and jugular foramen causing multiple cranial nerve palsies. Anteriorly, infection spreads to temporomandibular fossa, posteriorly to the mastoid and medially into the middle ear and petrous bone. CT scan is useful, to know the extent of disease. Treatment consists of high doses of i. v. antibiotics directed against pseudomonas (tobramycin, ticarcillin or third generation cephalosporins). Antibiotics are given for 6-8 weeks or longer.

Chronic otitis externa is ac chronic infection/inflammation involving the skin lining of the external canal. There is thickening of skin lining of the external canal due to persistent low grade infection/inflammation. Etiolgy: Caused primarily by repeated local irritation, most commonly arising from persistent drainage from a chronic middle ear infection. Other causes of repeated irritation, such as insertion of cotton swabs or other foreign objects into the ear canal, can lead to this condition, as can rare chronic infections such as syphilis, tuberculosis, and leprosy. Clinical Features: Unrelenting pruritus, mild pain. Presence of dry skin in the external canal. Asteatosis (lack of cerumen), hypertrophic external canal skin, presence of dry flaky skin in the external canal. Mild tenderness on ear manipulation. Rarely mucopurulent otorrhea. Management: Treatment: Extensive use of acetic acid ear drops helps to reduce the pH of skin lining the external canal making it more resistant to bacterial infections. Surgery is indicated in extreme cases. A canaloplasty is performed to widen the external canal. The involved skin may be removed to be replaced by a split thickness graft. Carcinoma External Auditory Canal. Most commonly squamous cell carcinoma. Most commonly seen in cases of long standing ear discharge. May arise primarily from the meatus or a secondary extension from the middle ear carcinoma. Clinical Features: Blood staining of hitherto mucopurulent or purulent discharge and severe headache. Examination: Ulcerated area in the meatus or a bleeding polypoidal mass or granulations. Facial nerve may be paralysed because of local extension of disease through posterior meatal wall or its spread into middle ear. Regional lymph nodes (preauricular, postauricular, infra-auricular and upper deep cervical). Treatment: En-bloc wide surgical excision with post-operative radiation. Keratosis Obturans. Collection of pearly white mass of desquamated epithelial cells in the deep meatus is called keratosis obturans. By its pressure effects causes absorption of bone leading to widening of meatus so much sothat facial nerve may be exposed and paralysed. Commonly seen between 5-20 years of age. May affect one or both ears. Etiology: Sometimes associated with bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis. Normally epithelium from surface of tympanic membrane migrates onto the posterior meatal wall. Failure of this migration or obstruction to the migration caused by wax may lead to accumulation of epithelial plug in the deep meatus. Clinical Features: Pain in the ear, hearing loss, tinnitus, sometimes ear discharge. Examination: Ear canal may be full of pearly white mass of keratin material disposed in several layers. Removal of this mass may show widening of bony meatus with ulceration and granuloma formation. Treatment: Keratotic mass is removed either by syringing or instrumentation.",

Glue ear or Otitis media with effusion (OME)(also k/a Serous otitis media, secretory otitis media, Mucoid otitis media)OME is characterized by a non-purulent effusion of the middle ear that may be either mucoid or serous. Symptoms usually involve hearing loss or aural fullness but typically do not involve pain or fever. In children hearing loss is generally mild and is often detected only with an audiogram. The fluid is nearly sterile. The condition is commonly seen in school-going children. It is the leading cause of hearing loss in children. Pathogenesis. Two main mechanisms are thought to be responsible. Eustachian tube dysfunction. Increased secretory activity of middle ear mucosa Treatment. Treatment may be medical or surgical. Medical measures are controversial and involve. Decongestants. Antiallergic measures. Antibiotics. Middle ear aeration. Valsalva manoeuvrepolitzerisation or eustachian tube catheterizationchewing gum. Surgical. Myringotomy and aspiration of fluid. Grommet or ventilation tube insertion.

When infection is localized to the sublingual space, structures in the floor of mouth are swollen and tongue seems to be pushed up and back. When infection spreads to submaxillary space, submental and submandibular regions become swollen and tender, and impa woody-hard feel. Usually, there is cellulitis of the tissues rather than frank abscess. Tongue is progressively pushed upwards and backwards threatening the airway. Laryngeal oedema may appear. Complications: 1. Spread of infection to parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal spaces and thence to the mediastinum. 2. Airway obstruction due to laryngeal oedema, or swelling and pushing back of the tongue. 3.

Neonatal/Infantile Hearing Screening. American Academy of Pediatrics endorses the goal of universal detection of hearing loss in infants before 3 months of age, with appropriate intervention no later than 6 months of age. The recommended hearing screening techniques are either otoacoustic emissions (OAE) testing or auditory brainstem evoked responses (ABRs). ABR test is an auditory evoked electrophysiologic response that correlate highly with hearing. OAE tests, used successfully in most universal newborn screening programs, are quick, easy to administer & inexpensive, and they provide a sensitive indication of the presence of hearing loss. Results of OAE are relatively easy to interpret. OAE tests elicit no response if hearing is worse than 30-40 dB, no matter what's the cause. Children who fail OAE tests undergo an ABR for a more definitive evaluation. Screening methods such as observing behavioural responses to uncalibrated noisemakers or using automated systems such as the Crib-o-gram or the auditory' response cradle are not recommended. Otoacoustic Emissions. During normal hearing. OAEs originate from the hair cells in the cochlea. OAEs travel through the middle ear to the external auditory canal, where they can be detected using miniature microphones. Transient evoked OAEs (TEOAEs) may be used to check the integrity of the cochlea. In neonatal period, detection of OAEs can be accomplished during natural sleep. TEOAEs can be used as screening tests in infants and children for hearing at the 30 dB level of hearing loss. If a hearing loss is suspected based on the absence of OAEs, ears should be examined for evidence of pathology, and then ABR testing should be used for confirmation & identification of type, degree & laterality of hearing loss. Types of Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE). Spontaneous OAE (SOAEs). Sounds emitted without an acoustic stimulus (i. e, spontaneously).* SOAE are seen in 25-80% of neonates with normal hearing & absence of SOAEs is not necessarily abnormal. Transient evoked OAE (TEOAEs). Sounds emitted in response to an acoustic stimuli of very short duration; usually clicks but can be tone-bursts* TOAEs commonly are used to screen infant hearing, to validate behavioural or electrophysiologic auditory thresholds & to assess cochlear function. Distortion product OAE (DPOAEs). Sounds emitted in response to 2 simultaneous tones of different frequencies* Particularly useful for early detection of cochlear damage as they are for ototoxicity & noise-induced damage. Sustained -frequency OAE (SFOASEs). Sounds emitted in response to a continuous tone* SPOAEs are responses recorded to a continuous tone. Advantages of using OAE as a screening test: Less time consuming & cost lower than ABRInfants who fail the OAE test are then screened using ABR.",

BPPV is characterized by vertigo when the head is placed in certain critical position, therefore is called positional. Vertigo is brought on by typical head movements, usually neck extension such as with looking up at a high shelf or at the sky; or rotation to one side. The vertigo will commonly be felt when going to lie down in bed or when rolling over to one side while in bed, and for this reason it is frequently first noticed at night or awakening.* BPPV describes the situation where the spinning sensation lasts only a few minutes and often stops by itself. There may be recurrent episodes without any specific reason or cause.* While there are many causes of vertigo, BPPV is the term that is used for vertigo that comes and goes (paroxysmal), without a specific associated illness (Benign). Episodes are frightening and difficult to predict. In some cases (20- 30%) BPPV has history of head trauma or ear infection.* BPPV is thought to be caused by displacement of otoconia (mineral crystals) from the vestibule of inner ear into the semicircular canals. The posterior semicircular canal is most commonly involved, though superior and horizontal canals canal can also be affected. Otoconia or ear rocks are small crystals of calcium carbonate derived structure in the utricle which migrate into semicircular canals and cause BPPV.

        "exp": "Inveed papilloma (Transitional cell papilloma or Ringez tumour or Schneiderian papilloma). It is a tumour of the nonolfactory mucosa of nose (Schneiderian membrane) and paranasal sinuses. Most common site of origin is lateral wall of nose in the middle meatus; less commonly it arises from the maxillary, frontal or sphenoid sinus. It is so named because hyperplastic papillomatous tissue grows into the stroma rather than in exophytic manner. Human papilloma virus is thought to be responsible for its aetiology. Clinically, men are affected more than women in the age group of 40-70. It is almost always unilateral and presents with nasal obstruction, nasal discharge and epistaxis. It can invade sinuses or orbit. Orbital involvement causes proptosis, diplopia and lacrimation. On examination of nose or endoscopy, it presents as a pale polypoidal mass resembling a simple nasal polypus or polypi. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show the location and extent of the lesion. MRI also helps to differentiate associated secretions in sinus from the actual tumour mass. Biopsy is essential for diagnosis. Care should be taken as simple nasal polypi may be associated with it or even the patient might have been operated for their removal. Treatment. Medial maxillectomy is the treatment of choice. It can be performed by lateral rhinotomy or sublabial degloving approach. These days endoscopic approach is preferred. In 10-15% of cases, it is associated with malignancy. Wider external surgical approaches may be required for tumour extending to the frontal sinus or orbit. Recurrence can occur. Radiotherapy is not advised as it may induce malignancy. Ref: Diseases of ENT by Dhingra 6th edition Pgno: 202",

Malignant otitis externao Malignant otitis externa, also called necrotizing external otitis, is a misnomer as it is not a neoplastic condition, rather it is an infectious condition. Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cartilage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear. Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been reported. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other parts of the body. Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externao Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor)o Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency)o Chemotherapy. Clinical features of malignant otitis externao Severe pain inside the ear and may get worse when moving head. o Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cartilagenous part. o Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent. o Fevero Itching of ear or ear canalo Troubled swallowing & weakness of face. Complicationso Cranial nerve palsies most commonly facial nerve is involved. Other cranial nerves can also be involved (glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, abducens, trigeminal). o Jugular venous thrombosis. o Cavernous sinus thrombosis o Meningitis. Treatment of malignant otitis externao In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonalpenicillin or cephalosporin (3rd generation piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear dropscontaining antipseudomonal antibiotic e. g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocorticoid is also used. Early cases can be managed with oral and otic fluoroquinolones only. Extensive surgical debridement once an important part of the treatment is now rarely needed.",

        "question": "All are true about Rinne's test except -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Bone conduction is better in sensorineural hearing loss. Rinne's Testo The Rinne test is a tuning fork test that compares hearing by air conduction and bone conduction. The Rinne test is based on the idea that hearing mechanism is normally more efficient by air conduction (A C) than it is by bone conduction (BC), Le., AC > BC in normal persons. For this reason, a tuning fork will sound louder and longer by air conduction than by bone conduction. However, this air conduction advantage is lost when there is a conductive hearing loss in which case the tuning fork sounds louder by bone conduction than by air-conduction. Methodo Administering the Rinne test involves asking the patient to indicate whether a vibrating tuning fork sounds louder when its base is held against mastoid process (bone conduction) or when its prongs are held near the pinna, facing the opening of ear canal (air conduction). After striking the fork, the clinician alternates it between these two positions so that the patient can make a judgement about which one is louder. Interpretation of Rinne's testo The outcome of the Rinne test is traditionally called \"positive\" if the fork is louder by air conduction and this finding implies that the ear is normal or has sensorineural hearing loss. The results are called \"negative\" if the bone-conduction is louder than air-conduction, which is interpreted as revealing the presence of conductive deafness i. e., lesions of either external ear, tympanic membrane, middle ear or ear ossicles., o In conductive deafness Rinne's test will be negative if the conductive hearing loss is greater than 15-20 dB (minimum air bone gap 15-20 dB). That means, at least 15-20 dB of conductive hear loss is required to show bone conduction better than air conduction, Le., Negative Rinne's test. A negative Rinne test for 256, 512 and 1024 Hz indicates a minimum air-bone gap (ABG) of 15, 30, 45 dB respectively. Therefore, AB gap can be made if tuning forks of256, 512 and 1024 Hz are used: -A Rinne test equal or negative for 256 Hz but positive for 512 Hz indicates air-bone gap of20-30 dB. A Rinne test negative for 256 and 512 Hz but positive for 1024 Hz indicates air-bone gap of30-45 dB. A Rinne negative for all the three tuning forks of256, 512, and 1024 Hz, indicates air-bone gap of 45- 60 dB. Rationale of positive testo Positive test (AC > BC) is seen in:-Normal person. It has already been explained that air conduction is better than bone conduction, thus Rinne test is positive in normal person. Sensori-neural hearing. In sensorineural hearing loss, the defect is in cochlea or VIII nerve or its central connection. There is no defect in conductive apparatus of ear (air conduction) or in mastoid bone (bone conduction). As air conduction is better than bone conduction, Rinne test will be positive (because both air conductive apparatus and bone conductive apparatus are normal and the pathology is distal to them). o Negative test (BC > AC) is seen in: -Conductive deafness. As the conductive apparatus is defective, bone conduction becomes better than air conduction (BC > AC). Severe unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Here the Rinne test is false negative (not true negative) as it is interpreted by the patient that BC > AC, but actually it is not. In reality this response is from the opposite ear because of transcranial transmission of sound during bone conduction testing. This can be prevented by masking the non-test ear with Barany's box while testing the bone conduction. Weber test will help for such situation.",

II Floor or jugular wallo Formed by a thin plate of bone which separates the middle ear from the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein. o The floor also presents the tympanic canaliculus which transmits the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve. III Anterior or carotid wallo The uppermost part bears the opening of the canal of the tensor tympani. o The middle part has the opening of the auditory tube. o The inferior part of the wall is formed by a thin plate of bone which forms the posterior wall of the carotid canal. This plate separates the middle ear from the internal carotid artery. IV Posterior or mastoid wallo Superiorly, is the aditus through which the epitympanic recess communicates with the mastoid antrum. o Below it is the fossa incudis which lodges the short process of the incus. o Below it is the pyramid giving attachment to the tendon of stapedius. o Vertical part of the facial canal for facial nerveV Lateral or membranous wallo Tympanic membrane alongwith the tympanic ring and sulcus. VI Medial or labrynthine wallo Promontory - rounded bulge produced by the first turn of the cochlea. o Oval window - it is posterosuperior to the promontory. It is closed by the footplate of the stapes. o Horizontal part of the facial canal - runs just above the oval window. o Round window - posteroinferior to the promontory.

Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cartilage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear. Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been reported. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other parts of the body. Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externao Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor) o Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency)o Chemotherapy. Clinical features of malignant otitis externao Severe pain inside the ear and may get worse when moving head. o Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cartilagenous part. o Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent. o Fevero Itching of ear or ear canal. o Troubled swallowing & weakness of face. Complicationso Cranial nerve palsies most commonly facial nerve is involved. Other cranial nerves can also be involved (glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, abducens, trigeminal), o Jugular venous thrombosis. o Cavernous sinus thrombosiso Meningitis. Treatment of malignant otitis externao In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonalpenicillin or cephalosporin (3rdgeneration piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e. g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocorticoid is also used. Early cases can be managed with oral and otic fluoroquinolones only. Extensive surgical debridement once an important part of the treatment is now rarely needed.",

(Canal wall down mastoidectomy) Surgical treatment of Atticoantral Cholesteatoma It is the mainstay of treatment. Primary aim in surgical treatment is to remove the disease and render the ear safe, and second in priority is to preserve or reconstruct hearing but never at the cost of the primary aim. Two types of surgical procedures are done to deal with cholesteatoma: (a) Canal wall down procedures. They leave the mastoid cavity open into the external auditory canal so that the diseased area is fully exteriorized. The commonly performed operations for atticoantral disease are atticotomy, modified radical mastoidectomy and rarely, the radical mastoidectomy (see operative surgery). (b) Canal wall up procedures: Here disease is removed by combined approach through the meatus and mastoid but retaining the posterior bony meatal wall intact, thereby avoiding an open mastoid cavity. It gives dry ear and permits easy reconstruction of hearing mechanism. However, there is danger of leaving some cholesteatoma behind. Incidence of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma in these cases is very high and there fore long-term follow-up is essential. Some surgeon's even advise routine re-exploration in all cases after 6 months or so. Canal wall up procedures are advised only in selected cases. In combined approach or intact canal wall mastoidectomy, disease is removed both permeatally, and through coical mastoidectomy and posterior tympanotomy approach, in which a window is created between the mastoid and middle ear, through the facial recess, to reach sinus tympani Ref: Diseases of ENT by Dhingra 6th edition Pgno: 73",

Intratympanic direct therapy for inner ear disease has several advanges over the conventional systemic and indirect therapy:* Increased therapeutic concentrations in the inner ear* Reduced side-effects* Can be used when systemic therapy is contraindicated* Can be used when systemic therapy fails. In direct therapy to the inner ear, the drug is delivered at the Round window membrane. Round window membrane separates the middle ear from the inner ear. A large range of substances are able to cross the RWM, including antimicrobials, corticosteroids, anesthetics etc. Delivery methods. Typical intratympanic injection. Gelfoam method. Mechanical sustained release devices. Fully implantable micropump system* Drug is administered directly around RWM. using injection after a myringotomy.* Drawbacks: Injected medication my leak down the Eustachian tube, escape out of the external auditory canal, or be sequestered in the middle ear* In order to address these problems, several sustained release vehicles have been developed.* A dry' gelfoam pad can be placed directly in the round window niche.* The medication is directly injected over the gelfoam pad.* The Silverstein micro wick: It is made of polyvinyl acetate. It is wick measuring 1x9 mm small enough to fit through a tympanostomy tube. The wick absorbs medication which can be instilled into the external auditory canal by the patient at home and delivers it to the RWM.* The Intra Ear Microcatehter: Consists of an electronic pump connected to catheter tip that is placed directly on the RWM Implantation of the Microcatheter is more invasive and requires the elevation of tympanomeatal flap.* This device is made from pure titanium, polyethylene, and silicone and is designed for life-long implantation in humans.* To place the device, a cavity is drilled in the mastoid bone to house the pump and the reservoir system.* This device can deliver drugs which require chronic and continuous application.",

Tunnel of Coi- which is formed by the inner and outer rods. It contains a fluid called coilymph. The exact function of the rods and coilymph is not known. 2. Hair cells- They are impoant receptor cells of hearing and transduce sound energy into electrical energy. Inner hair cells form a single row while outer hair cells are arranged in three or four rows. Inner hair cells are richly supplied by afferent cochlear fibres and are probably more impoant in the transmission of auditory impulses. Outer hair cells mainly receive efferent innervation from the olivary complex and are concerned with modulating the function of inner hair cells. 3. Suppoing cell- Deiters' cells are situated between the outer hair cells and provide suppo to the latter. Cells of Hensen lie outside the Deiters' cells. 4. Tectorial membrane- It consists of gelatinous matrix with delicate fibres. It overlies the organ of Coi. The shearing force between the hair cells and tectorial membrane produces the stimulus to hair cells. Reference-Dhingra 6/e, p 13.",
