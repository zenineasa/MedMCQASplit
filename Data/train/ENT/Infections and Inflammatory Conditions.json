Seen mostly in middle aged males. Bacilli reach the larynx by bronchogenic (via sputum) and hematogenous route. Most commonly posterior part of the larynx is affected i. e. arytenoids, inter arytenoids area. Clinical Features. Weakness of voice (earliest symptom). Pain radiating to ear due to ulceration. Odynophagia. Examination Findings. Monocorditis - hyperemia of the vocal cord with impairment of adduction (earliest sign). Swelling in the inter arytenoids area giving it a niami. Jated appearance. Ulceration of the vocal cord - mouse nibbled appearance. Ulceration and granulation over the arytenoids and inter arytenoid area. Psuedoedema of the epiglottis - Turban epiglottis. Pale mucosa. Swelling of the false cord and aryepiglottic. Diagnosis is by chest x-ray and sputum AFB examination. Should take a biopsy to rule out malignancy in suspected cases. Treatment is with ATTLupus. Affects the anterior part of larynx. First epiglottis is affected. Painless and mostly asymptomatic. Good prognosis. Treatment is with ATTSyphilis. Can affect any part any part of larynx. Larynx generally affected in the tertiary stage. Diagnosed with biopsy and serology. Complication - laryngeal stenosis",

Croup (Larvngotracheobronchitis)o Laryngotracheobronchitis is the most common infectious cause of obstruction in children usually occurring between the ages of 6 months and 3 years. o Male children (boys) are characteristically more frequently involved than females (girls). Edologyo It is a viral infection most frequently caused by Parainfluenza virus. Pathologyo The most characteristic pathological feature is edema formation in the subglottic areao The loose areolar tissue in the subglottic area swells up and causes predominant signs of upper airway obstruction. Presentationo Gradual onset with a prodrome of upper respiratory? Symptomso Hoarseness and barking cough (croupy cough)o Stridor (initially inspiratory than biphasic)o Fever is usually low grade (or absent) although may occasionally be high gradeo Droolings is characteristically absent and there is no dysphagia (seen in epiglottitis). Imaging (X ray)o Symmetric 'steeple' or 'funnel shaped' narrowing of the subglottic region (steeple sign)o Hypopharyngeal widening or distensiono Normal epiglottis and arvepiglottic folds. Treatmento Mild symptoms (barking cough but no stridor at rest). Supportive therapy alone with humified oxygen, oral hydration and minimal handling, o Moderate symptoms (barking cough with stridor at rest). Active intervention with humified oxygen, Nebulized racemic epinephrine and glucocorticoids (steroids), o Severe symptoms (impending respiratory failure). Require an artificial airway (Intubation with endotracheal tube or tracheostomy may be required). Antibiotics are not routinely indicated in the treatment of Acute Laryngotracheobronchitis. Their use is limited if there is evidence of secondary bacterial infection",
