A: Maxillary Malignant neoplasm most frequently involves the maxillary sinus followed in turn by ethmoid, frontal and sphenoid Paranasal sinuses They are a group of four paired air-filled spaces that surround the nasal cavity The sinuses are named for the facial bones behind which they are located. The maxillary sinuses, also called the maxillary antrechea and the largest of the paranasal sinuses lie in the maxillary bones. The frontal sinuses in the frontal bone The ethmoid sinuses are formed from several discrete air cells within the ethmoid bone. The sphenoid sinuses, in the sphenoid bone at the center of the skull base under the pituitary gland. The paranasal air sinuses are lined with respiratory epithelium (ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium). Paranasal sinuses form developmentally through excavation of bone by air-filled sacs (pneumatic diveicula) from the nasal cavity. This process begins prenatally, and it continues through the course of an organism's lifetime Role Decreasing the relative weight of the front of the skull, and especially the bones of the face. Increasing resonance of the voice. Providing a buffer against blows to the face. Insulating sensitive structures like dental roots and eyes from rapid temperature fluctuations in the nasal cavity. Humidifying and heating of inhaled air because of slow air turnover in this region Malignancies of the paranasal sinuses They comprise approximately 0. 2% of all malignancies. About 80% of these malignancies arise in the maxillary sinus. Men are much more often affected than women. They most often occur in the age group between 40 and 70 years. Carcinomas are more frequent than sarcomas. Metastases are rare. Tumours of the sphenoid and frontal sinuses are extremely rare.",

The reason why it disappears after successful surgery is that when the skull is vibrated by bone-conduction sound, the sound is detected by the cochlea via 3 routes: - Route (a)-is by direct vibration within the skull. - Route (b)-is by vibration of the ossicular chain which is suspended within the skull. - Route (c)-is by vibrations emanating into the external auditory canal as sound and being heard by the normal air-conduction route. In a conduction type of hearing loss (as in otosclerosis) the latter two routes are deficient but regained by successful reconstruction surgery. Hence bone conduction thresholds improve following surgery. ALSO KNOW Dip in noise induced hearing loss is seen at 4 KHZ.

Glucose value > 30-40 mg% and protein value < 100 mg % (max 200 mg %) suppo a diagnosis of CSF leak. Presence of I3, transferrin is the most definitive test for detection of CSF and I32transferrin assay is the test of choice when a confirmatory test is needed, because of high sensitivity as well as specificity. I3-trace protein (prostaglandin D synthase) is also used, however it is nonspecific as it is also present in human testes, heart and seroma. 2. Basic clinical tests Tissue test (Handker chief test): - Unlike nasal mucous, CSF does not cause a tissue to stiffen. Filter paper test: - Sample of nasal discharge on a filter paper exhibits a light CSF border and a dark central area of blood, i. e., double ring sign or halo sign. Queckensted test: - Compression of the jugular vein leas to increased CSF leak due to increase in ICP. Rhinoscopy: - Visualization of CSF leak from paranasal sinus. 3.

TOC of tubo tympanic CSOM is conservative management. But according to Turner 70/e, p 285 - central perforation/ tubo tympanic CSOM are both managed conservatively by antibiotics and by keeping the ear dry. \"If there is recurring discharge or if there is deafness sufficient to cause disability, closure of the perforation by myringoplasty should be considered. \"According to Scott's Brown. Dry perforations that are symptom free do not require usually require closure. If the only symptom is a hearing impairment, the chances of improving hearing with surgery should be considered carefully, not just the hearing in the operated ear but the overall hearing ability of the patient. In patients with a H/O intermittent activity, surgery to close the perforation is probably indicated to minimize future activity. So from all above discussions it is clear that TOC for central safe perforation is conservative management.",

A sound of low pitch produces the greatest displacement toward the apex of the cochlea and produces the greatest activation of hair cells at that location. As the pitch is increased, the position of greatest displacement moves closer to the base of the cochlea. Increases in the number of hair cells that are activated and in the frequency of discharge of units in the auditory nerve fibers, together with an increase in range of frequencies to which such units respond, are all more likely to be observed in response to increases in the intensity of a sound stimulus rather than to increases in pitch. In the auditory coex, sound frequencies are organized topographically so that a change in pitch may be represented by a change in the location of activated coical units. Ref: Barrett K. E., Barman S.

Disease is caused by a disorder of posterior semicircular canal though many patients have history of head trauma and ear infection It has been demonstrated that otoconial debris, consisting of crystals of calcium carbonate, is released from the degenerating macula of the utricle and floats freely in the endolymph The condition can be treated by performing Epley's manoeuvre. The principle of this manoeuvre is to reposition the otoconial debris from the posterior semicircular canal back into the utricle. The manoeuvre consists of five positions. Position 1; With the head turned 45deg, the patient is made to lie down in head-hanging position (Dix. Hallpike manoeuvre). It will cause veigo and nystagmus. Wait till veigo and nystagmus subside. Position 2. Head is now turned so that affected ear is up. Position 3. The whole body and head are now rotated away from the affected ear to a la teral recumbent position in a face-down position. Position 4. Patient is now brought to a Sitting posiition with head st ill turned to the unaffected side by 45deg Position 5. The head is now turned forward and chin brought down 20deg.",

        "exp": "Aspiration is the passage of foreign material beyond the vocal cords: The larynx has 3 distinct functions - respiration, phonation and airway protection. Dysfunction of larynx can lead to aspiration. The primary goal of treatment of aspiration is to separate the upper digestive tract from the upper respiratory tract for a short period of time or in some cases, permanently. There are 3 broad categories of treatment. Temporary/Adjunct Treatments Medical Therapy - in the form of antibiotics is important to prevent aspiration pneumonia. It is important to make the patient NPO, to avoid further aspiration and to find an alternate feeding route to maintain the patients nutritional status. A nasogastric tube (feeding gastostomy/jejunostomy) is commonly placed, but this may actually increase the aspiration reflux by making the lower esophageal and upper esophageal sphincters incompetent. But Still \"Tubal feeding (either by nasogastric tube or gastrostomy) however is often unavoidable. \" - Scotts Brown 7/e, vol 1 p 1278 Here it is important to note that feeding Gastrostotomy / jejunostomy are not the gold standard methods of preventing aspiration but rather are done to maintain the nutritional status of patient and prevent further aspiration. In fact according to most texts - they are a common cause of aspiration. Vocal cord medialization (by injecting Gel foam) is useful in unilateral paralysis. This is helpful but is rarely curative, if there is a serious aspiration problem. Tracheostomy will often make aspiration worse by preventing laryngeal elevation on swallowing. It does however, allow easy access to the chest for suctioning. Even a cuffed tube doesn't prevent aspiration as secretions pool above the cuff and the seal is never perfect\" Scotts Brown 7/e, vol 1 p 1278 Definite - Reversible Procedures Endolaryngeal stents: They function like a cork in the bottle. There job is to seal the glottis and therefore thay need to be used in conjunction with a tracheostomy tube. But they are not often used as they are effective only as a short term solution, plus there is risk of glottic stenosis. Laryngotracheal separation: The procedure involves transecting the cervical trachea and bringing out the lower end as a permanent end stoma According to Scotts Brown and Internet sites: It is the procedure of choice as it is reversible. But it has disadvantage of sacrificing voice. Alternative procedure is Tracheoesophageal diversion but has higher complication rates.",

Conduction of sound: It is done mainly by middle ear. Middle ear not just simply conducts the sound but conves sound of great amplitude and less force to that of less amplitude and greater force. This function of the middle ear is called as impedance matching mechanism or the transformer action. ii. Transduction of mechanical energy to electrical impulse: Movements of the stapes footplate causes vibrations in scala vestibuli followed by scala tympani and is transmitted to the cochlear fluids which brings about movement of the basilar membrane. This sets up shearing force between the tectorial membrane and the hair cells. The distoion of hair cells gives rise to electrical nerve impulse. A sound wave, depending on its frequency, reaches maximum amplitude on a paicular place on the basilar membrane, and stimulates that segment (traveling wave theory of von Bekesy).

Modified radical mastoidectomy is the surgery of choice.

The commonly used procedures for atticoantral disease are atticotomy, modified radical mastoidectomy and rarely radical mastoidectomy. Modified radical mastoidectomy is the procedure of choice. 2) Canal wall up procedures (coical mastoidectomy) Here disease is removed by combined approach through the meatus and mastoid but retaining the posterior bony meatus wall, thereby avoiding an open mastoid cavity.

It is seen in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In India, most of the cases are seen in Southern states. Infection of the nose and nasopharynx is observed in 70% of persons with rhinosporidiosis; infection of palpebral conjunctiva or associated structures (including lacrimal apparatus) is observed in 15% of cases. Other structures of the mouth and upper airway may be sites of disease. Disease of the skin, ear, genitals and rectum has also been described. Rhinosporidiosis is an infection that typically limited to the mucosal epithelium. The disease progress with local replication of R seeberi and associated hyperplastic growth of host tissue and a localized immune response. Clinical features of Rhinosporidiosis Rhinosporidiosis presents as soft leafy polypoidal mass (soft polyp), which is pink to purple in colour studded with white dots, i. e. strawberry appearance. This appearance results from sporangia, which is visible as grey or yellow spots in the vascular polypoid masses. Because the polyps are vascular and friable, they bleed easily upon manipulation.

        "exp": "Foul smelling discharge and perforation in the Pars flaccida suggest CSOM of the unsafe type (Atticoantral type) This type of CSOM is often associated with a bone eroding process such as cholesteatoma, granulations or osteitis. Risk of complications is high Surgery is the mainstay of treatment. The primary aim is to remove the disease process by tympano-mastoid exploration and render the ear safe. Tympano-mastiod exploration can be done through various procedures. 1. Canal wall down procedures - Atticotomy, modified radical mastoidectomy and rarely radical mastoidectomy. 2. Canal wall up procedures Tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure that repairs or reconstructs the hearing mechanism. 'Type I Defect is perforation of tympanic membrane which is repaired with a graft. It is also called myringoplasty. -Type II Defect is perforation of tympanic membrane with erosion of malleus. Graft is placed on the incus or remnant of malleus. 'Type III Malleus and incus are absent. Graft is placed directly on the stapes head. It is also myringostapediopexy or columella tympanoplasty. -Type IV Only the footplate of stapes is present. It is exposed to the external ear, and graft is placed between the oval and round windows. A narrow middle ear (cavum minor) is thus created, to have an air pocket around the round window. A mucosa-lined space extends from the eustachian tube to the round window. Sound waves in this case act directly on the footplate while the round window has been shielded. *Type V Stapes footplate is fixed but round window is functioning. In such cases, another window is created on horizontal semicircular canal and covered with a graft. Also called fenestration operation.",

The traditional method is to have the patient extend the arm and place his extended finger on the examiner's index finger; then with the eye closed raise the arm directly overhead; than bring it back down precisely onto the examiner's finger. If vestibular or cerebellar lesion is there, past pointing (detion of limb) will be present. The two types (cerebellar and vestibular) past pointing have different patterns:- With vestibular in: balance, the normal labyrinth will push the limb toward the abnormal side and the patient will miss the target. The past pointing will always be to the same side of target and will occur with either limb. With a cerebellar hemispheric lesion, the ipsilateral limbs will have ataxia and incoordination; past pointing occurs only with the involved arm and may be to the side of lesion or erratically to either side of the target.

The cochlear promontory may have a faint pink tinge reflecting the vascularity of the lesion, referred to as the Schwaz sign. Conductive hearing loss is usually secondary to impingement of abnormal bone on the stapes footplate. This involvement of the oval window forms the basis of the name fenestral otosclerosis. The most common location of involvement of otosclerosis is the bone just anterior to the oval window at a small cleft known as the fissula ante fenestram.

Through the hiatus semilunaris the meatus communicates with a curved passage termed the infundibulum, which communicates in front with the anterior ethmoidal cells and in rather more than fifty percent of skulls is continued upward as the frontonasal duct into the frontal air-sinus; when this continuity fails, the frontonasal duct opens directly into the anterior pa of the meatus.

The right and left palatine tonsils form the most conspicuous pas of the waldeyer's ring. The ring is completed below by the lingual tonsils and above by pharyngeal tonsils (adenoids) and tubal tonsils. Since the respiratory and oral cavities may be a site of entry for many pathogens, waldeyer's ring maintains surveillance in this critical region and is able to initiate the immune response before the pathogens invade deep into the body. Gerlach tonsil is a collection of lymphoid nodules near the pharyngeal opening of auditory tube. It is also called as tubal tonsil.",

Initiation of therapy during first 24 hours of symptom confers a higher likelihood of recovery. Antiviral therapy (Acyclovir) is a newer adjunct in treating acute facial palsy of viral origin (both Bell's palsy and Ramsay hunt syndrome). Most surgeons these days advocate combination of steroids and antiviral drugs. 2) Physical treatment Physical treatment includes: - i) Eye care:- Aificial tear drops, ocular ointment and use of sunglasses to prevent eye complication due to dry eye. ii) Electric stimulation:- To maintain membrane conductivity and reduce muscle atrophy. If the patient of Bell's palsy is not responding to conservative treatment, electrodiagnostic study (electrophysiological study) should be done. Electrodiagnostic study includes, electromyography (EMG), Electroneurography (ENG), minimal excitibility test and maximal excitibility test. Surgery is reserved for those who meet electrodiagnostic (electrophysiological) study criteria or are worsening on medial treatment. 3) Surgical treatment Nerve decompression relieves pressure on the nerve fibers and thus improves the microcirculation of the nerve. Usually veical and tympanic segments of nerve are decompressed. However, some worker's suggest total decompression including labyrinthine segment.

It is important, however, to avoid inserting too large tube, which may cause mucosal damage. The length of the tube is calculated as: Length = + 12 cm For orotracheal intubation Length = + 15 cm For nasotracheal intubation Uncuffed tubes are used in children - as there is potential for mucosal damage with the cuffed tubes (with high volume, low pressure cuffs) In older children approaching puberty - Cuffed endotracheal tubes are used, reflecting the anatomical development of the airway. Endotracheal tubes are available in a variety of materials although the use of PVC and silicone rubber is now almost universal. As far as blades are concerned - A huge range of laryngoscopes blades are available. Anatomical considerations and to some extent personal choice, determine the most appropriate blade to use. In general position of the infant larynx and the long epiglottis makes intubation easier with a straight blade and are often used in children under 6 months of age.

Named after Scottish anatomist Charles Bell, who first described it, Bell's palsy is the most common acute mononeuropathy and is the most common cause of acute facial nerve paralysis. Idiopathic unilateral facial nerve paralysis is usually self-limiting. The trademark is rapid onset of paial or complete palsy, usually in a single day. It can occur bilaterally resulting in total facial paralysis in around 1% of cases in GBS, sarcoidosis, sickle cell disease etc. Patient may complain of noise intolerance due to stapedial palsy or loss of taste due to involvement of chorda tympani.",

' Management of Nasal Foreign Body Before you sta, make sure you have the correct equipment and that the child is being adequately held, in an accommodating position. Fewer attempts will reduce the anxiety of the parent and child. Use topical anaesthetic and vasoconstrictor (reduces swelling) spray in the affected nostril. Blow positive pressure through the nose - preferably by the parent blowing sharply through the child's mouth whilst obstructing the unaffected nostril. This has been shown to be relatively non-traumatic, with success rates of 79% Use a nasal speculum and a hook or thin forceps, to hold object. Be careful not to push the FB fuher back Application of strong suction is sometimes sufficient to draw the object out. Pass a narrow balloon catheter past the FB, inflate and remove the catheter, pulling the FB with it. The Fogay is preferred (compared to a Foley), as it is stiffer and stronger. Examine for signs of other FB e. g. nasal, ear, inhaled, etc. Refer to ENT specialist if unsuccessful after two attempts If the FB is a small button battery, moisture within the cavity may lead to tissue damage.

Interpretatons are as follows: - Normal person or person with sensorineural deafness hears louder when ear canal is occluded and softer when the canal is open (Bing positive). This occurs because occlusion of ear canal prevents ambient noise (opposing background noise) to enter through air conduction route. A patient with conductive hearing loss will appreciate no change (Bing negative). In patient with conductive deafness ambient noise does not interfere because it cannot enter through air conduction route as the conductive apparatus is defective.

Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cailage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear. Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been repoed. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other pas of the body. Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externa Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor) Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency) Chemotherapy Clinical features of malignant otitis externa Severe pain:- inside the ear and may get worse when moving head. Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cailagenous pa. Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent. Fever Itching of ear or ear canal Troubled swallowing & weakness of face. Complications Cranial nerve palsies:- most commonly facial nerve is involved. Other cranial nerves can also be involved (glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, abducens, trigeminal). Jugular venous thrombosis Cavernous sinus thrombosis Meningitis Treatment of malignant otitis externa In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin (r generation piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e. g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocoicoid is also used. Early cases can be managed with oral and otic fluoroquinolones only. Extensive surgical debridement once an impoant pa of the treatment is now rarely needed.",

These glands have histopathology similar to normal sebaceous glands, despite their ectopic location. They are regarded as hamartomas as they are not associated with hair follicles (In contrast to normal sebaceous glands which have their ducts in hair follicles). Fordyce's spot is totally benign condition which occurs in normal people. It is characterized by discrete, pin-head sized superficial, light or yellow milia-like, maculo-papular lesions in the mucous membrane of lips (especially vermilion portion), and sometimes buccal mucosa. The condition usually appears at puberty and is more common in males. Fordyce's spots are often confused with koplik's spot of measles -> There is erythematous halo around the Koplik's spot which is not there in Fordyce's spot. As the condition is asymptomatic, no treatment is required, other than reassurance. Oral isotretinoin can be used for large disfiguring spots.",

The patient is able to stand with feet together and eyes open but sways or falls with eyes closed; it is one of the earliest signs of posterior column disease. - De. Jong's the neurologic examination Proprioceptive pathway: Proprioception is the ability to sense the position of one's extremities without the aid of vision. The peripheral sense organs are located in the muscle, tendons, and joints. The first cell body is situated in the dorsal root ganglion, going without a synapse to the ipsilateral fasiculi cuneatus and gracilis (dorsal column) to the lower medulla where the synapse occurs. Following a decussation of the internal arcuate fibers, the impulses ascend in the medial leminiscus to the thalmus, terminating in the parietal lobe, posterior to those that convey touch. Patholophysiologic basis of Romberg test: Central postural control (equilibrium) is dependent on input from three peripheral modalities: Joint position sense (proprioception), carried in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord; Vision Vestibular apparatus Disturbance in any one of these modalities can be compensated for (completely or incompletely) by input from the other two systems. Impaired proprioception can be over come by visual and vestibular feedback. However, reduced visual input in the dark surroundings or due to failing vision can seriously predispose such a patient to severe incoordination (ataxial) Asking the patient to close his eyes during rombergs test helps uncover any disordered proprioception that may have been masked by vision. Conditions commonly causing a positive Romberg test: Posterior column dysfunction Posterior cord compression Multiple sclerosis Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord Tabes dorsalis Sensory polyneuropathy Idiopathic Diabetes mellitus Intracranial lesions Less common Romberg's test is not a test of cerebellar function. Patients with cerebellar ataxia will, generally, be unable to balance even with the eyes open.",

H. influenzae is the most common causative organism. Other organisms are Pneumococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, N. meningitidis, Staphylococcus Clinical manifestations Onset is sudden. Symptoms are- fever, dysphagia, drooling, muffled voice, inspiratory retractions, cyanosis and soft stridor. Patients often sit in sniffing dog position. Respiratory arrest may occur. Plain lateral soft tissue radiograph of neck Thickening of the epiglottis - the thumb sign Absence of a deep well defined vallecula - the vallecula sign \"The risk of sudden death for persons is high due to sudden airway obstruction\". Diagnosis of acute epiglottitis In most cases presumptive diagnosis can be made by typical clinical picture of the disease. The definitive diagnosis is made by direct inspection of the epiglottis, a procedure that should be done by an experienced airway specialist under controlled conditions (usually the operating room). The typical findings are cherry-red and swollen epiglottis and arytenoids. In children, the epiglottis can be seen by simple depression of tongue by tongue blade. In older children and adults, indirect or direct laryngoscopy usually is necessory to make a diagnosie\"\". Though the definitive diagnosis requires direct inspection of the epiglottis. Case management should be individualized. In the child with moderate or advanced disease, the clinical diagnosis should be apparent without an intraoral examination. In this situation, intraoral examination should not be performed, but the child should be prepared for the establishment of an airway. This preparation should be rapid but controlled so that intubation can be performed in an operating room. The diagnosis can also be established by the classical appearance on a lateral neck radiograph which shows the thumb sign and vellecula sign. Etiological diagnosis is made by culture of an organism from blood and from the specimen of the surface of epiglottis. Treatment of epiglottitis Once the diagnosis of epiglottitis is made, endotracheal intubation must be performed immediately. After an airway is established, cultures of the blood and epiglottis should be obtained and patient staed on appropriate intravenous antibiotics to cover H. influenzae (Ceftriaxone or equivalent cephalosporins). Ceftriaxone is the treatment of choice for epiglottitis\". Other antibotic options are:- Ampicillin plus sulbactam Cefuroxime Clindamycin Chloramphenicol Cefotaxime Intravenous antibiotics should be continued for 2-3 days, followed by oral antibiotics to complete a 10 days course.",

Non purulent sterile effusion accumulates in the middle ear cavity. Painless condition. MCC of conductive deafness in school-going children. ETIOLOGY OF OTITS MEDIA WITH EFFUSIONMalfunctioning of Eustachian tube (adenoid hyperplasia, chronic rhinitis, sinusitis & tonsillitis, tumors of nasopharynx, cleft palate). Cause of U/L secretory otitis media in an adult is Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. Patients with Wegener's Granulomatosis may present with Secretory Otitis Media. Characteristic triad of Wegener's granutomatosis is vasculitis of the upper respiratory tract (serious otitis media and epistaxis), vasculitis of the lower respiratory tract (hemoptysis) and vasculitis of the kidney (proteinuria). Allergy. Unresolved otitis media. Viral infection - adeno and rhinoviruses. CLINCAL FEATURES OF OTITS MEDIA WITH EFFUSIONSymptoms: Hearing loss (<40. DB). Delayed and defective speech. Mild ear ache. Otoscopy: Dull and opaque tympanic membrane. Intact tympanic membrane. Colour may be Yellow/Grey/Blue. Loss of light reflex. Thin leash of blood vessels seen along the handle of malleus (less marked than ASOM). Retracted TMBulging of the posterior pa of TMFluid level and air bubbles seen. Mobility restricted. Tuning fork tests: Conductive deafness of 20-40 d. BImpedance Audiometry: confirmatory test for Secretory Otits Media, Shows Type -B curve. X-ray Mastoid: Clouding of air cells. MANAGEMENT OF OTITS MEDIA WITH EFFUSIONMedical Treatment: Decongestant, Anti allergic, Antibiotics, Middle ear aeration (Valsalva maneuver). Watchful waiting is recommended without immediate use of antibiotics for children with uncomplicated otitis media with effusion. Surgical Treatment: 1. Myringotomy and fluid aspiration: 2 incisions one in the antero inferior and other antero superior quadrant of the TM to aspirate thick glue like secretions. (Beer can principle)2. Grommet inseion: left in place till spontaneously extruded. In chronic secretory otitis media(also known as Glue ear), the treatment of choice is Myringotomy with ventilation tube inseion3. Tympanotomy (or) coical mastoidectomy-very limted role4. Surgical t/t of causative factor - adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, and/or wash out of maxillary antra.

Facial Palsy and CSOMIn CSOM, facial palsy may be due to erosion of fallopian canal by cholesteatoma (which erodes fallopian canal) osteitis, or demin! eralization. The treatment should be urgent mastoid exploration, with decompression of the facial nerve in the fallopain canal. However, the scenario is not the same in ASOM. An acute inflammatory process cannot effectively erode the bony falopian canal within the sho period of time. Hence, the only possibility in a patient with ASOM to develop facial palsy is the presence of a congenitally dehiscent fallopian canal (facial nerve without a bony canal), which is the commonest congenital maliformation of temporal bone. Thus in this case the treatment is myringotomy to relieve pressure on the exposed nerve or sometimes cotical mastoidectomy.",

There is collection of pus between the capsule of tonsil and the superior constrictor muscle, i. e. in the peritonsillar area. Peritonsillar abscess is a complication of tonsillitis and is most commonly caused by group A beta - hemolytic streptococcus. Clinical features of Quinsy Clinical features are divided into:? General: They are due to septicaemia and resemble any acute infection. They include fever (up to 104degF), chills and rigors, general malaise, body aches, headache, nausea and constipation. Local: Severe pain in throat. Usually unilateral. Odynophagia. It is so marked that the patient cannot even swallow his own saliva which dribbles from the angle of his mouth. Patient is usually dehydrated. Muffled and thick speech, often called \"Hot potato voice\". Foul breath due to sepsis in the oral cavity and poor hygiene. Ipsilateral earache. This is referred pain CN IX which supplies both the tonsil and the ear. Trismus due to spasm of pterygoid muscles which are in close proximity to the superior constrictor. Examination findings The tonsil, pillars and soft palate on the involved side are congested and swollen. Tonsil itself may not appear enlarged as it gets buried in the oedematous pillars. Uvula is swollen and oedematous and pushed to the opposite side. Bulging of the soft palate and anterior pillar above the tonsil. Mucopus may be seen covering the tonsillar region. Cervical lymphadenopathy is commonly seen. This involves jugulodigastric lymph nodes. Toicollis: Patient keeps the neck tilted to the side of abscess. Treatment of peritonsillar abscess IV fluids Antibiotics: High dose penicllin. (iv benzipenicillin) is the DOC. In patients allergic to penicillin erythromycin is the DOC. Incision and drainage per orally, if the abscess does not resolve depite high dose of iv antibiotics Tonsillectomy is done 6 weeks following an attack of quinsy (interval tonsillectomy).",

There may be multiple perforations in the early stages, but they coalesce into a large tympanic membrane perforation accompanied by a pale granulation tissue. Periauricular fistulae, lymphadenopathy and facial palsy are infrequent findings. Late complications include facial paralysis, labyrinthitis, postauricular fistulae, subperiosteal abscess, petrous apicitis and intracranial extension of infection.",

Medical treatment Prednisolone (steroid) is the drug of choice and is staed at initial visit. Initiation of therapy during first 24 hours of symptom confers a higher likelihood of recovery. Antiviral therapy (Acyclovir) is a newer adjunct in treating acute facial palsy of viral origin (both Bell's palsy and Ramsay hunt syndrome). Most surgeons these days advocate combination of steroids and antiviral drugs. 2. Physical treatment Physical treatment includes: - Eye care: - Aificial tear drops, ocular ointment and use of sunglasses to prevent eye complication due to dry eye. Electric stimulation: - To maintain membrane conductivity and reduce muscle atrophy. If the patient of Bell's palsy is not responding to conservative treatment, electrodiagnostic study (electrophysiological study) should be done. Electrodiagnostic study includes, electromyography (EMG), Electroneurography (ENG), minimal excitibility test and maximal excitibility test. Surgery is reserved for those who meet electrodiagnostic (electrophysiological) study criteria or are worsening on medial treatment. 3. Surgical treatment Nerve decompression relieves pressure on the nerve fibers and thus improves the microcirculation of the nerve. Usually veical and tympanic segments of nerve are decompressed. However, some worker's suggest total decompression including labyrinthine segment. Decompression is done in cases who have a poor prognosis for complete recovery with medical therapy alone or in cases who do not respond to medical therapy after 8-12 weeks.",

This combines with an increase in volume of tinnitus and temporary, albeit significant, hearing loss. Hearing may improve after an attack, but often becomes progressively worse. Nausea, vomiting, and sweating sometimes accompany veigo, but are symptoms of veigo, and not of Meniere's. Fluctuating, progressive, unilateral or bilateral hearing loss, usually in lower frequencies. For some, sounds can appear tinny or distoed, and patients can experience unusual sensitivity to noises. Unilateral or bilateral tinnitus. A sensation of fullness or pressure in one or both ears. Some may have parasitic symptoms, which aren't necessarily symptoms of Meniere's, but rather side effects from other symptoms. Veigo may induce nystagmus, or uncontrollable rhythmical and jerky eye movements, usually in the horizontal plane, reflecting the essential role of non-visual balance in coordinating eye movements. Sudden, severe attacks of dizziness or veigo, known informally as \"drop attacks, \" can cause someone who is standing to suddenly fall Meniere's disease is idiopathic, but it is believed to be linked to endolymphatic hydrops, an excess of fluid in the inner ear. Edolymphatic fluid bursts from its normal channels in the ear and flows into other areas, causing damage. This is called \"hydrops. \" The membranous labyrinth, a system of membranes in the ear, contains a fluid called endolymph. The membranes can become dilated like a balloon when pressure increases and drainage is blocked. This may be related to swelling of the endolymphatic sac or other tissues in the vestibular system of the inner ear, which is responsible for the body's sense of balance. Endolymphatic duct may be obstructed by scar tissue, or may be narrow from bih. In some cases there may be too much fluid secreted by the stria vascularis. The symptoms may occur in the presence of a middle ear infection, head trauma, or an upper respiratory tract infection, or by using aspirin, smoking cigarettes, or drinking alcohol. A detailed otolaryngological examination, audiometry and head MRI scan should be performed to exclude a vestibular schwan. noma or superior canal dehiscence which would cause similar symptoms.

Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been reported.

Malignant otitis externa is a disorder involving inflammation and damage of the bones and cailage at the base of skull in temporal bone as a result of spread of infection from outer ear. Malignant otitis externa is often caused by difficult to treat bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. Only rare cases of malignant otitis externa due to S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been repoed. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and inflammation may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may spread more and affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other pas of the body. Predisposing factors for malignant otitis externa Elderly diabetics (most common predisposing factor) Individuals with altered immune function (immunodeficiency) Chemotherapy Clinical features of malignant otitis externa Severe pain:- inside the ear and may get worse when moving head. Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, at the junction of bony and cailagenous pa. Drainage from the ear - yellow, yellow - green, foul smelling, persistent. Fever Itching of ear or ear canal Troubled swallowing & weakness of face. Complications Cranial nerve palsies:- most commonly facial nerve is involved. Other cranial nerves can also be involved (glossopharyngeal, vagus, spinal accessory, hypoglossal, abducens, trigeminal). Jugular venous thrombosis Cavernous sinus thrombosis Meningitis Treatment of malignant otitis externa In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin (3'd generation piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e. g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocoicoid is also used.

Carhas notch is seen only in bone conduction curve. It disappears after successful stapedectomy/stapedotomy. The reason why it disappears after successful surgery is that when the skull is vibrated by bone--conduction sound, the sound is detected by the cochlea 3 routes:- Route (a)--is by direct vibration within the skull.- Route (b)--is by vibration of the ossicular chain which is suspended within the skull.- Route (c)--is by vibrations emanating into the external auditory canal as sound and being heard by the normal air-conduction route.

There is collection of pus between the capsule of tonsil and the superior constrictor muscle, i. e. in the peritonsillar area. Peritonsillar abscess is a complication of tonsillitis and is most commonly caused by group A beta - hemolytic streptococcus. Clinical features of Quinsy Clinical features are divided into:? 1) General: They are due to septicaemia and resemble any acute infection. They include fever (up to 104degF), chills and rigors, general malaise, body aches, headache, nausea and constipation. 2) Local: Severe pain in throat. Usually unilateral. Odynophagia. It is so marked that the patient cannot even swallow his own saliva which dribbles from the angle of his mouth. Patient is usually dehydrated. Muffled and thick speech, often called \"Hot potato voice\". Foul breath due to sepsis in the oral cavity and poor hygiene. Ipsilateral earache. This is referred pain CN IX which supplies both the tonsil and the ear. Trismus due to spasm of pterygoid muscles which are in close proximity to the superior constrictor. Examination findings The tonsil, pillars and soft palate on the involved side are congested and swollen. Tonsil itself may not appear enlarged as it gets buried in the oedematous pillars. Uvula is swollen and oedematous and pushed to the opposite side. Bulging of the soft palate and anterior pillar above the tonsil. Mucopus may be seen covering the tonsillar region. Cervical lymphadenopathy is commonly seen. This involves jugulodigastric lymph nodes. Toicollis: Patient keeps the neck tilted to the side of abscess. Treatment of peritonsillar abscess IV fluids Antibiotics: High dose penicllin. (iv benzipenicillin) is the DOC. In patients allergic to penicillin erythromycin is the DOC. Incision and drainage per orally, if the abscess does not resolve depite high dose of iv antibiotics. Tonsillectomy is done 6 weeks following an attack of quinsy (interval tonsillectomy).",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Menieres disease Treatment of Meniere's disease Most treatments are for symptoms believed to be caused by excess endolymphatic fluid. Treatment of Meniere's disease is of two types:? A) Medical management B) Surgical management Medical management: Treatment of Meniere's disease begins first with medical management. Medical treatment controls the condition in over two third of patients. Medical management includes:? 1. Antihistamine labyrinthine sedatives (vestibular sedatives) Many cases can be controlled by vestibular sedatives like prochlorperazine, promethazine, dimenhydramine, and cinnarzine. 2. Anxiolytic and tranquillizers Many patients are anxious, therefore they may be helped by anxiolytic and tranquillizers like diazepam. 3. Vasodilators Betahistine hydrochloride appears to be the most useful recent addition to the medical armamentarium and is routinely prescribed for most patients. It increases labyrinthine blood flow by releasing histamine. Other vasodilators employed include nicotinic acid, thymoxamine, inhaled carbogen (5% CO2 with 95% 02), and histamine drip. Vasodilators increase vascularity of endolymphatic sac and its duct and thereby increases reabsorption of endolymphatic fluid. 4. Diuretics (furosemide) Diuretics with fluid and salt restriction can help to control recurrent attacks if not controlled by vestibular sedatives or vasodilators. 5. Other drugs Propantheline bromide, phenobarbitone and hyoscine are effective alternatives. Surgical management Surgical therapy for meneire's disease is reserved for medical treatment failures and is otherwise controversial. Surgical procedures can be divided into two main categories Destructive surgical procedures Nondestructive surgical procedures Destructive surgical procedures: rationale is to control veigo. Endolymphatic hydrops causes fluid pressure accumulation within the inner ear, which causes temporary malfunction and misfiring of the vestibular nerve. These abnormal signals cause veigo. Destruction of the inner ear and / or the vestibular nerve prevents these abnormal signals. The procedures performed are: Labyrinthectomy Intermittent low pressure pulse therapy (Meniett device therapy) Conservative surgical procedures: are used in cases where veigo is disabling but hearing is still useful & needs to be preserved. They are: Decompression of endolymphatic sac Endolymphatic shunt operation Sacculotomy (Fick's operation & Cody's tack procedure) Vestibular neuronectomy Ultrasonic destruction of vestibular labyrinth to preserve cochlear function.

The length of the tube is calculated as: Length =+ 12 cm For orotracheal intubation Length = + 15 cm For nasotracheal intubation Uncuffed tubes are used in children - as there is potential for mucosal damage with the cuffed tubes (with high volume, low pressure cuffs) In older children approaching pubey - Cuffed endotracheal tubes are used, reflecting the anatomical development of the airway. Endotracheal tubes are available in a variety of materials although the use of PVC and silicone rubber is now almost universal. As far as blades are concerned - A huge range of laryngoscopes blades are available. Anatomical considerations and to some extent personal choice, determine the most appropriate blade to use.

In freeze-dried preparations of the guinea pig cochlea, both actin and tubulin are found in the sensory and suppoing cells of the organ of Coi. Fodrin (brain spectrin) co-localized with actin in the cuticular plates of both inner and outer hair cells and along the lateral wall of the outer hair cells. Alpha-actinin co-localized with actin in the cuticular plates of the hair cells and in the head and foot plates of the suppoing cells. It was also found in the junctional regions between hair cells and suppoing cells. o Profilin co-localized with actin in the cuticular plates of the sensory hair cells. Myosin was detected only in the cuticular plates of the outer hair cells and in the suppoing cells in the region facing endolymph. Gelsolin was found in the region of the nerve fibers. Tubulin is found in microtubules in all cells of the organ of Coi. In suppoing cells, microtubules are bundled together with actin microfilaments and tropomyosin, as well as being present as individual microtubules arranged in networks. An intensely stained network of microtubules is found in both outer and inner sensory hair cells. The microtubules in the outer hair cells appear to course throughout the entire length of the cells, and based on their staining with antibodies to the tyrosinated form of tubulin they appear to be more dynamic structures than the microtubules in the suppoing cells. The microtubule-associated protein MAP-2 is present only in outer hair cells within the organ of Coi and co-localizes with tubulin in these cells. No other MAPs (1, 3, 4, 5) are present. Tau is found in the nerve fibers below both inner and outer hair cells and in the osseous spiral lamina.",
