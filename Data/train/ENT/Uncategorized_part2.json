So, for proper voice, the vocal cords should be in median or paramedian position. Same occurs in bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, where the vocal cords are in median or paramedian position -> Voice is less likely to be impaired. Now, the question comes to the mind immediately: - Why the voice is affected in unilateral paralysis, in which the cord is in median or paramedian position. The answer is: - In unilateral vocal cord paralysis, one cord is paralysed and vibrates abnormally or does not vibrate at all, therefore cannot coordinate with the other side (normal) vocal cord. This results in voice problems. In bilateral paralysis, both vocal cords vibrate abnormally but coordinate with each other, therefore voice is less affected.",

Trotter's method: - Patient is made to sit, leaning a little forward over a basin to spit any blood and breathe quietly from the mouth. Cold compresses: - Cause vasoconstriction Vasoconstrictor medication on a cotton pledget. Treatment of the etiology: - For example antihypeensives in hypeensive patient. 2. Cauterisation Patient who continues to bleed after properly applied nasal pressure, or a patient with recurrent episodes of bleeding over a period of hours or days, deserve a more definitive procedure. If a presumptive source of bleeding is identified chemical cautery by silver nitrate or coagulation with electrocautery should be considered. 3. Anterior nasal pack Continued epistaxis from an anterior site despite cautery requires placement of anterior nasal pack. 4.

Indications 1. Chronic and subacute maxillary sinusitis with dual purpose of: Confirming the diagnosis and Washing out the pus 2. To collect the specimen of the antral contents for culture and sensitivity, or cytological examination to exclude early malignancy. Contraindications Children less than 12 years of age. Acute maxillary sinusitis as it may lead to osteomyelitis Fracture of maxilla as fluid may pass through fracture line. Diabetes hearing it. The examiner then says that he is going to repeat the test, but puts a non-vibrating fork on the mastoid while at the same time bringing a vibrating fork close to the auricle. If the patient is malingering, he will hear the tuning fork through air conduction, but think that it is being heard through the bone. If he is really deaf he will not hear the fork. 3. Lomard's test This depends upon the fact that to the normal man the sound of his own voice is necessary for the proper regulation of its tone and loudness. The Barany noise apparatus is adjusted to the patient's sound ear and its machinery staed in order to accustom him to its grating noise. He is given a book, and told to read aloud in his normal voice and not to stop reading when the instrument is set in action. As soon as the noise begins, a man whose opposite ear is profoundly deaf will at once raise his voice and, if his deafness is absolute, may literally shout. The malingerer, on the other hand, claiming a one-sided deafness which is not real will continue to read in an even tone or in a tone only slightly elevated. 4. Acoustic reflex (stapedial reflex threshold) If stapedial reflex is present, it rules out NOHL because stapedial reflex is not in voluntary control. 5. Electric response audiometry (ERA) or coical evoked response audiometry It is very useful in NOHL and can establish hearing acuity of the person to within 5-10 dB of actual thresholds. 6.

Most are unilateral, but about 5% are associated with the hereditary syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 2, in which bilateral eighth nerve tumors may be accompanied by meningiomas and other intracranial and spinal tumors. These benign lesions arise within the internal auditory canal and gradually grow to involve the cerebellopontine angle, eventually compressing the pons and resulting in hydrocephalus. Their typical auditory symptoms are a unilateral hearing loss with a deterioration of speech discrimination exceeding that predicted by the degree of pure tone loss. Nonclassic presentations, such as sudden unilateral hearing loss, are fairly common. Any individual with a unilateral or asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss should be evaluated for an intracranial mass lesion. Vestibular dysfunction more often takes the form of continuous dysequilibrium than episodic vertigo. Diagnosis is made by enhanced MRI. Treatment consists of observation, microsurgical excision, or stereotactic radiotherapy, depending on such factors as patient age, underlying health, and size of the tumor at presentation.",

These primed TH, cells release IL-4 that acts on B-cells to form Ig E specific for that paicular antigen. The antigen specific Ig E antibodies then bind to the surface receptors of mast cells and basophils. The process from first antigen exposure to the coating of mast cells by Ig E acts as sensitization (prior sensitization) and first exposure is also called priming or sensitizing exposure (dose). Subsequent exposure (shocking dose) to same antigen then results in activation of mast cells and basophils with release of inflammatory mediators Histamine (most impoant) PAF Heparin Cytokines (IL-1, 3, 4, 5, 6; INF) Leukotriens (B4, Ch D4) Eosinophil chemolactic factor (ECF) PGD2 Neutrophil chemolactic factor (NCF) The release of these mediators result in: - Increased vascular permeability and vasodilatation which result in tissue edema - Nasal blockage and sneezing. Smooth muscle spasm - Bronchoconstriction Hyperactivity of glands - Rhinorrhea Recruitment of inflammatory cells. 2) Late phase response Recruited inflammatory cells of initial phase amplify and sustain the inflammatory response without additional exposure to the triggered antigen.

In this setting, basic surgical principles include the en bloc removal of the involved gland with preservation of all nerves unless directly invaded by tumor. For parotid tumors that arise in the lateral lobe, superficial parotidectomy with preservation of CN VII is indicated. If the tumor extends into the deep lobe of the parotid, a total parotidectomy with nerve preservation is performed. Although malignant tumors may abut the facial nerve, if a plane of dissection can be developed without leaving gross tumor, it is preferable to preserve the nerve. If the nerve is encased by tumor (or is noted to be nonfunctional preoperatively) and preservation would result leaving gross residual disease, nerve sacrifice should be considered. The removal of submandibular malignancies includes en bloc resection of the gland and submental and submandibular lymph nodes. Radical resection is indicated with tumors that invade the mandible, tongue, or floor of mouth. Therapeutic removal of the regional lymphatics is indicated for clinical adenopathy or when the risk of occult regional metastasis exceeds 20%. High-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas, for example, have a high risk of regional disease and require elective treatment of the regional lymphatics. When gross nerve invasion is found (lingual or hypoglossal), sacrifice of the nerve is indicated with retrograde frozen section biopsies to determine the extent of involvement. If the nerve is invaded at the level of the skull base foramina, a surgical clip may be left in place to mark the area for inclusion in postoperative radiation fields. The presence of skip metastases in the nerve with adenoid cystic carcinoma makes recurrence common with this pathology. Postoperative radiation treatment plays an impoant role in the treatment of salivary malignancies. The presence of extraglandular disease, perineural invasion, direct invasion of regional structures, regional metastasis, and high-grade histology are all indications for radiation treatment.",

Rhinosporidiosis is an infection that typically limited to the mucosal epithelium. The disease progress with local replication of R. seeberi and associated hyperplastic growth of host tissue and a localized immune response. Clinical features of Rhinosporidiosis Rhinosporidiosis presents as soft leafy polypoidal mass (soft polyp), which is pink to purple in colour studded with white dots, i. e., strawberry appearance. This appearance results from sporangia, which is visible as grey or yellow spots in the vascular polypoid masses. Because the polyps are vascular and friable, they bleed easily upon manipulation.

The exact etiology is unknown, but triggers include emotions, odors, poor air quality, spicy foods, and medication side effects. Pathogenesis include:- Parasympathetic overactivity Hyperactive nasal mucosa to several non-specific stimuli especially in women of 20-40 years. Symptoms of vasomotor rhinitis include excessive clear rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction/congestion, irritation, paroxysmal sneezing and post-nasal drip. Nasal mucosa is hyperophied & congested; and mucosa of turbinates may give mulberry like appearance and is pale to dusky red in colour. Complications of vasomotor rhinitis include hyperophic rhinitis & sinusitis, and nasal polyp. Treatment Treatment of vasomotor rhinitis includes: - 1. Conservative treatment Avoidance of physical factors which provoke symptoms. Antihistaminics and oral or nasal decongestants. Topical or systemic steroids 2. Surgical treatment Nasal obstruction can be relieved by measures which reduce the size of hyperophied nasal turbinate: -Cryosurgery, submucosal diathermy, Linear cauterization, paial or total turbinectomy, submucosal resection of turbinate. Excessive rhinorrhoea in vasomotor Rhinitis not corrected by medical therapy and bothersome to the patient, is relieved by sectioning the parasympathetic secretomotor fibres to nose i. e., vidian neurectomy.",

        "exp": "Rhinosporidiosis Rhinosporidiosis is a chronic granulomatous infection of the mucous membrane that usually manifests as vascular friable polyps that arise from the nasal mucosa. The etiological agent is Rhinosporidium seeberi. Rhinosporidium seeberi is an aquatic bacterium (not a fungus). Infection usually results from a local traumatic inoculation with the organism. It is seen in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In India, most of the cases are seen in Southern states. Infection of the nose and nasopharynx is observed in 70% of persons with rhinosporidiosis; infection of palpebral conjunctiva or associated structures (including lacrimal apparatus) is observed in 15% of cases. Other structures of the mouth and upper airway may be sites of disease. Disease of the skin, ear, genitals and rectum has also been described. Rhinosporidiosis is an infection that typically limited to the mucosal epithelium. The disease progress with local replication of R seeberi and associated hyperplastic growth of host tissue and a localized immune response. Clinical features of Rhinosporidiosis Rhinosporidiosis presents as soft leafy polypoidal mass (soft polyp), which is pink to purple in colour studded with white dots, i. e. strawberry appearance. This appearance results from sporangia, which is visible as grey or yellow spots in the vascular polypoid masses. Because the polyps are vascular and friable, they bleed easily upon manipulation. Treatment The treatment of choice is surgical excision. Complete excision of mass is done with diathermy knife and cauterization of base. Dapsone is being tried for treating rhinosporidiosis but with limited success.",

Hearing aids These are miniaturized sound amplifying devices to amplify sounds reaching the ear. These devices contain a microphone to recieve sound, an electronic processor (amplifier) that manipulates the qualities of sound to make it more usable to listner, a speaker (receiver) that conves electrical impulses back to the sound. Hearing Aids may be of two types:? Air conduction hearing aid: - In this, the amplified sound is transmitted the ear canal to the tympanic membrane. Bone conduction hearing aid: - Instead of a receiver, it has a bone vibrator which snugly fits on the mastoid and directly stimulates the cochla. This type of aid is specially useful in persons with actively draining ears, otitis externa or atresia of the ear canal when ear-inses cannot be worn. Hearing aid is indicated in persons who has a hearing problem that cannot be helped by medical or surgical means. 2. Implants Two commonly used Implants are:? A. Cochlear implants Cochlear implants bypass the function of the sensory receptors by directly stimulating ganglion cells in the auditory nerve. Cochlear implants conve the mechanical sound energies into the electrical signals that can be directly delivered into the auditory nerve in severe or profoundly hearing impaired individuals. Cochlear implant has two components: External component: - It contains microphone, speech processor and transmitter, and remains outside the body. Internal component: - It contains receiver/stimulater which is implanted under the skin and electrode which is implanted in the Scala tympani of the cochlea a cochleastomy opening in the basal turn of cochlea. It may also be placed at other locations like promontory or round window but these sites has poorer performance. B. Auditory brainstem implant The cochlear nucleus complex within the brainstem is stimulated directly by placing the electrode into the lateral recess of fouh ventricle. Such implant is used when V///'h cranial nerve has been severed in surgery of acoustic neuroma. Cochlear implants are not effective in this situation.",

Infectious: Leprosy, teiary syphilis, tuberculosis, rhinoscleroderma, naso-oral blastomycosis, leishmaniasis, actinomycosis, histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis and diphtheria. Autoimmune: Lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease and Wegener's granulomatosis. Neoplastic: Different tumors can extend from maxillary sinus or nasal cavity and perforate the palate. Although these neoplasms usually form a mass, but in advanced cases perforation of palate may occur in course of disease or following treatment. Drug related: Palatal perforation due to cocaine abuse is a well-known situation. Other durgs (heroine, narcotics) can be responsible for palatal perforation. latrogenic: Sometimes following a tooth extraction an oro-antral fistula remains. Other procedures such as tumor surgery (maxillectomy), corrective surgeries (e. g. septoplasty) or intubation can cause palatal perforation. Rare causes: Rhinolith can result in palatal perforation.

Cuffed Tracheostomy Tubes A cuff is a balloon-like device around the distal end of the tracheostomy tube. Most cuffed tubes now available have low pressure cuffs with a high volume. This significantly reduces the possibility of pressure necrosis and potential stenosis formation. Pediatric tubes do not have a cufr. Cuffed tubes are used in situation where positive pressure ventilation is required, or when the airway is at risk from aspiration. (In unconscious patient or when patient is on respiration). The cuff should be deflated every 2 hours for 5 mins to present pressure damage to the trachea. Uncuffed Tracheostomy Tubes This tube does not have a cuff that can be inflated inside the trachea. It is suitable for a patient who has returned to the ward from a prolonged stay in intensive care and requires physiotherapy and suction trachea. This type of tube is not suitable for patients who are unable to swallow due to incompetent laryngeal reflexes, and aspiration of oral or gastric contents is likely to occur.

        "exp": "Ans. is `c' i. e., Type C tympanogram Serous otitis media Serous otitis media (SOM) has many synonyms: Serous otitis media, otitis media with effusion, glue ear, non-suppurative otitis media, mucoid otitis media, silent otitis media. SOM is an insidious condition in which there is thick or sticky non-purulent fluid behind the eardrum in the middle ear, but there is no ear infection, i. e., effusion of middle ear without infection. Fluid in the middle ear is sterile. SOM occurs most commonly in school going children and SOM is the commonest cause of childhood hearing loss. Etiopathogenesis 1. Eustachian tube dysfunction Eustachian tube dysfunction, coupled with recurrent upper respiratory tract infection is the most impoant factor in the development of SOM. Normally eustachian tube helps to drain fluids to prevent them from building up in the ear. In Eustachian tube dysfunction, it is unable to drain the fluid. Following can cause Eustachian tube block:- Respiratory tract infection:- Adenoid, rhinitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis. Allergies Benign and malignant tumor of nasopharynx. 2. Unresolved otitis media Inadequate antibiotic therapy in acute suppurative otitis media may inactivate infection but fails to resolve it completely. Low grade infection lingers on and acts as stimulus for mucosa to secrete more fluid. Clinical features Unlike children with an ear infection (ASOM), children with SOM do not act sick. o The only presenting symptom may be hearing loss with fullness in ear. Otoscopic finding of SOM Air bubbles on the surface of ear drum Fluid behind the eardrum. Dullness of the eardrum when a light is used, with loss of light reflex. o Eardrum may appear yellow, grey or bluish in colour. Retracted eardrum with decreased mobility Tympanometry shows type B tympanogram.",

        "exp": "Paranasal sinus cancer is uncommon and represents only 0. 2 to 0. 8% of all malignancies. Cancer of paranasal sinus constitutes 3% of all carcinomas of the aerodigestive tract. The majority of paranasal sinus malignancies (50-80%) originate within the maxillary sinus antrum. Malignancies rarely occur within the other sinuses and originate in the ethmoid, frontal, and sphenoid sinuses in 10%, 1% and 1% respectively. The cause of parasinus malignancy is unknown. However several risk factors have been associated and therefore it is seen more commonly in people working in hardwood furniture industry, nickel refining, leather work, and manufacturer of mustard gas. More than 80% of the malignant tumours are of squamous cell variety. Rest are adenocarcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, melanoma, and various type of sarcomas. Workers of furniture industry develop adenocarcinoma of the Ethmoids and upper nasal cavity. While those engaged in Nickel refining get squamous cell and Anaplastic carcinoma. Clinical features for maxillary carcinoma It is seen more commonly in the 7th decade of life. Males are affected more commonly than females. Early features of maxillary sinus malignancy are nasal stuffiness, blood-stained nasal discharge, facial paraesthesias or pain and epiphora. These symptoms may be missed or simply treated as sinusitis. Late features will depend on the direction of spread and extent of growth. Medial spread to nasal cavity gives rise to nasal obstruction, discharge and epistaxis. It may also spread into anterior and posterior ethmoid sinuses and that is why most antral malignancies are antroethmoidal in nature. Anterior spread causes swelling of cheeks. Inferior spread leads to expansion of alveolus with dental pain, loosening of teeth, poor fitting dentures, ulceration of gingiva. Superior spread invades the orbit causing proptosis, diplopia, ocular pain and epiphora. Posterior spread is into pterygomaxillary fossa, pterygoid plate and the pterygoid muscles causing trismus. Lymphatic spread in maxillary carcinoma is rare and occurs only in the late stages. Most commonly involved lymph node is submandibular lymph node followed by jugular nodes. Treatment of maxillary carcinoma For squamous cell carcinoma, the treatment of choice is a combination of radiotherapy and surgery. Radiotherapy can be given before or after surgery. Very often, a full course of pre-operative telecobalt therapy is given, followed 4 - 6 weeks later by surgical excision of the growth by total or extended maxillectomy.",

Olfactory dysfunction is associated with early Parkinson disease and with other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease and Huntington chorea. An association also exists between abnormal olfactory identification and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Head trauma leading to fracture of the cribriform plate may cause cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea and a potential for meningitis. Paranasal sinus endoscopy may lead to violation of the cribriform plate and potential infectious complications.

Caloric test evaluates the integrity of lateral (horizontal) semicircular canals and their afferent pathways. o The veigo produced by caloric test is compared with veigo experienced by the patient during the clinical episode of veigo and if both are qualitatively same, it suggests labyrinthine origin of veigo. Nystagmus produced by caloric test has both fast and slow component because caloric test stimulates vestibular system and vestibular nystagmus has a slow and a fast component. In caloric test one ear is tested at one time and the principle advantage of the test lies in the ability of an investigator to evaluate selectively the physiological integrity of a patient's left or ight horizontal semicircular canal separately.

        "question": "All are true about Rinne's test except?",
        "exp": "Ans. is'd' i. e., Bone conduction is better in sensorineural hearing loss Rinne's Test The Rinne test is a tuning fork test that compares hearing by air conduction and bone conduction. The Rinne test is based on the idea that hearing mechanism is normally more efficient by air conduction (AC) than it is by bone conduction (BC), i. e., AC > BC in normal persons. For this reason, a tuning fork will sound louder and longer by air conduction than by bone conduction. However, this air conduction advantage is lost when there is a conductive hearing loss in which case the tuning fork sounds louder by bone conduction than by air-conduction. Method Administering the Rinne test involves asking the patient to indicate whether a vibrating tuning fork sounds louder when its base is held against mastoid process (bone conduction) or when its prongs are held near the pinna, facing the opening of ear canal (air conduction). After striking the fork, the clinician alternates it between these two positions so that the patient can make a judgement about which one is louder. Interpretation of Rinne's test The outcome of the Rinne test is traditionally called \"positive\" if the fork is louder by air conduction and this finding implies that the ear is normal or has sensorineural hearing loss. The results are called \"negative\" if the bone-conduction is louder than air-conduction, which is interpreted as revealing the presence of conductive deafness i. e., lesions of either external ear, tympanic membrane, middle ear or ear ossicles.. In conductive deafness Rinne's test will be negative if the conductive hearing loss is greater than 15-20 dB (minimum air bone gap 15-20 dB). That means, at least 15-20 dB of conductive hear loss is required to show bone conduction better than air conduction, i. e., Negative Rinne's test. A negative Rinne test for 256, 512 and 1024 Hz indicates a minimum air-bone gap (ABG) of 15, 30, 45 dB respectively. Therefore, AB gap can be made if tuning forks of 256, 512 and 1024 Hz are used: - A Rinne test equal or negative for 256 Hz but positive for 512 Hz indicates air-bone gap of 20-30 dB. A Rinne test negative for 256 and 512 Hz but positive for 1024 Hz indicates air-bone gap of 30-45 dB. A Rinne negative for all the three tuning forks of 256, 512, and 1024 Hz, indicates air-bone gap of 4560 dB. Rationale of positive test Positive test (AC > BC) is seen in:? 1. Normal person It has already been explained that air conduction is better than bone conduction, thus Rinne test is positive in normal person. 2. Sensori-neural hearing In sensorineural hearing loss, the defect is in cochlea or VIII nerve or its central connection. There is no defect in conductive apparatus of ear (air conduction) or in mastoid bone (bone conduction). As air conduction is better than bone conduction, Rinne test will be positive (because both air conductive apparatus and bone conductive apparatus are normal and the pathology is distal to them). Negative test (BC >AC) is seen in:? 1. Conductive deafness As the conductive apparatus is defective, bone conduction becomes better than air conduction (BC > AC). 2. Severe unilateral sensorineural hearing loss Here the Rinne test is false negative (not true negative) as it is interpreted by the patient that BC > AC, but actually it is not. In reality this response is from the opposite ear because of transcranial transmission of sound during bone conduction testing. This can be prevented by masking the non-test ear with Barany's box while testing the bone conduction. Weber test will help for such situation.",

In cochlear otosclerosis sensorineural hearing loss also occur along with conductive deafness. Paracusis willissii:- An otosclerotic patient hears better in noisy than quiet surroundings. Tinnitus:- More common in cochlear otosclerosis. Speech:- Monotonous, well modulated soft speech. Veigo:- is uncommon. Signs in otosclerosis Tympanic membrane is quite normal and mobile. In 10% of cases flamingo - pink blush is seen through the tympanic membrane called as Schwaze sign. Various tests show conductive hearing loss. Tuning fork tests in otosclerosis As otosclerotic patients have conductive deafness, the tuning fork tests results will be as follows:? Rinnes:- Negative Webers:- Lateralized to the ear with greater conductive loss. Absolute bone conduction (ABC):- Normal (can be decreased in cochlear otosclerosis). Gelles test:- No change in the hearing through bone conduction when air pressure of ear canal is increased by Siegle's speculum. Audiometry in otosclerosis Audiometry is one of the impoant tools in evaluation of a patient of otosclerosis. Various audiometric tests are:? 1. Pure tone audiometry Shows loss of air conduction, more for lower frequencies with characteristic rising pattern. Bone conduction is normal. However in some cases, there is a dip in bone conduction curve which is maximum at 2000 Hz (2 KHz) and is called the Carha's notch. 2. Impedance audiometry Impedance audiometry shows:- Tympanometry Patient with early disease may show type A tympanogram (because middle ear areation is not affected) Progressive stapes fixation results in classical As type tympanogram. Acoustic (stapedial reflex) It is one of the earliest sign of otosclerosis and preceedes the development of airbone gap. In early stage, diphasic on-off pattern is seen in which there is a brief increase in compliance at the onset and at the termination of stimulus occurs. This is pathognomonic of otosclerosis. In later stage the reflex is absent.",

Multiple ethmoidal polyps: Antihistaminic, low dose steroids, local steroid sprays, help to regress the ethmoidal polyps to a ceain extent. However, the above treatment rarely eliminates well-formed polyps and is often combined with surgery. Post antrochoanal surgery: Most patients with antrochoanal polyps have a history of chronic sinusitis and/or allergy (rarely). The dominating symptoms are nasal obstruction and chronic rhinorrhea. Other common symptoms of ACPs in children are snoring, nocturnal sleep apnea and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. Computed tomography is an impoant radiological examination of choice for evaluation of antrochoanal polyps. The treatment of choice is always surgical. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) with polypectomy has been the dominating surgical approach. Antrochoanal polyps are single, unilateral and rarely recur. Topical steroids are rarely recommended. Allergic Fungal Sinusitis: The treatment of choice is generally surgery.

Veigo (\"a whirling or spinning movement\") It is a type of dizziness, where there is a feeling of motion when one is stationary. The symptoms are due to a dysfunction of the vestibular system in the inner ear. It is often associated with nausea and vomiting as well as difficulties standing or walking. The most common causes are benign paroxysmal positional veigo, concussion and vestibular migraine while less common causes include Meniere's disease and vestibular neuritis. Excessive consumption of ethanol (alcoholic beverages) can also cause notorious symptoms of veigo. A number of conditions that involve the central nervous system may lead to veigo including: migraine headaches, lateral medullary syndrome, multiple sclerosis Veigo is a sensation of spinning while stationary. Repetitive spinning, as in familiar childhood games, can induce sho-lived veigo by disrupting the ineia of the fluid in the vestibular system Veigo is classified into either peripheral or central depending on the location of the dysfunction of the vestibular pathway Peripheral: Veigo caused by problems with the inner ear or vestibular system is called \"peripheral\", \"otologic\" or \"vestibular\". - The most common cause is benign paroxysmal positional veigo (BPPV) but other causes include Meniere's disease, superior canal dehiscence syndrome, labyrinthitis and visual veigo. - Any cause of inflammation such as common cold, influenza, and bacterial infections may cause transient veigo if they involve the inner ear, as may chemical insults (e. g., aminoglycosides) or physical trauma (e. g., skull fractures). - Motion sickness is sometimes classified as a cause of peripheral veigo. Central: If veigo arises from the balance centers of the brain, it is usually milder, and has accompanying neurologic deficits, such as slurred speech, double vision or pathologic nystagmus. - Brain pathology can cause a sensation of disequilibrium which is an off-balance sensation.",

Most common fungal infection of paranasal sinus is Aspergillus (A fumigatus > A niger > A flavus). Other offending fungi are Alternaria, Mucor and Rhizopus. Types of fungal sinusitis There are four types of fungal sinusitis:? 1. Mycetoma fungal sinusitis (fungal ball):- Produces clumps of spores, a \"fungal ball\", within a sinus cavity, most frequently in maxillary sinus. The patient maintains an effective immune system. The non-invasive nature of this disorder requires a treatment consisting of simple scraping of infected sinus. An anti fungal therapy is generally not prescribed. 2. Allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS):- It is a non-invasive condition which is believed to be an allergic reaction to the environmental fungi that is finely dispersed into the air. Patient is usually immunocompetent with normal immune system. Treatment consists of endoscopic surgical clearance of the sinus along with pre-and postoperative systemic steroids. Anti-inflammatory medical therapy and immunotherapy are typically prescribed to prevent recurrence. 3. Chronic indolent invasive sinusitis:- It is an invasive form of fungal sinusitis in immunocompetant patients. This is characterized by a granulomatous inflammatory infiltrates. Treatment consists of surgical removal of the involved mucosa, bone and soft tissue followed by iv amphotericin B. 4. Acute fulminant sinusitis:- It is usually seen in the immunocompromized patients.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Expiratory stridor Laryngomalacia It is the most common congenital abnormality of the larynx. Laryngomalacia is the most frequent cause of stridor or noisy breathing in infants. It occurs as a result of a floppy poion of the larynx (in supraglottic larynx) that has not yet developed the strength to provide rigid suppo to the airway. During inspiration negative pressure is created through larynx, which results in a collapse of these structures into the airway and a narrower breathing passage. Paial obstruction is the source of the noise with breathing (stridor), and sometimes cyanosis. The hallmark sign includes intermittent stridor mostly in inspiration. It is usually more prominent when the infant is lying on his/her back (supine position, crying, feeding, excited or has a cold. Stridor gets relieved on placing the patient in prone position. This is usually first noticed in the first few weeks of life. It may worsen over the first few months and become louder. This is because as the baby grows, inspiratory force is greater, which causes greater collapse of the laryngeal structures into the airway. This is usually worst at 3-6 months and then gradually improves as the rigidity of the cailage improves. Most children are symptom free by 1 to 2 years. Sometimes, cyanosis may occur. Direct laryngoscopy shows:- Omega shaped epiglottis, i. e. elongated and curled on itself. Floopy, tall, foreshoened and thin aryepiglottic folds. Prominent arytenoids. In most patients laryngomalacia is a self limiting condition. Treatment of laryngomalacia is reassurance to the parents and early antibiotic therapy for upper respiratory tract infections.",

In adults, tonsillitis does not occur usually (tonsillitis occurs usually in children). Thus, in adults it is due to tooth infection or extraction. Parapharvngeal abscess Parapharyngeal space As the name suggests, parapharyngeal space, it is the space on both side of the pharynx, i. e. lateral to the pharynx - lateral pharyngeal space. It is also known as pharyngomaxillary space. It is pyramidal in shape with base at the base of skull and apex at the hyoid bone. Relations Medial: Buccopharyngeal fascia covering the constrictor muscles. Posterior: Preveebral fascia covering preveebral muscles and transverse processes of cervical veebrae. Lateral: Medial pterygoid muscle, mandible and deep surface of parotid gland. Divisions of parapharyngeal space Styloid process and the muscles attached to it divide the parapharyngeal space into anterior and posterior compaments. Anterior compament is related to tonsillar fossa medially and medial pterygoid muscle laterally. Posterior compament is related to posterior pa of lateral pharyngeal wall medially and parotid gland laterally. Through the posterior compament pass the carotid aery, jugular vein, IV, Xth, XIth, XII\" cranial nerves and sympathetic trunk. Clinical features of parapharyngeal abscess This is rare site to get infection. Sixty per cent of patients develop it as a complication of tonsillitis or tonsillectomy and 40 per cent as a result of either infection or extraction of lower third molar tooth. Mastoid infection can extend into the space on rare occasions. There is fever and marked trismus because of spasm in medial pterygoid muscle. The tonsil, if it is normal, is pushed medially. The most marked swelling is in the neck at the posterior pa of the middle third of the sternomastoid (behind the angle ofjaw). There may also be swelling in retromolar area.

The commonest presenting symptoms are unilateral deafness or tinnitus, or a combination of both. Hearing loss is retrocochlear sensorineural type. There is marked difficulty in understanding speech, out of propoion to the pure tone hearing loss, a characteristic feature of acoustic neuroma. Vestibular symptoms are imbalance or unsteadiness. True veigo is very rare. 2) When tumor extends beyond IAC and involves other structures Vthcranial nerve:- It is the earliest nerve to be involved. There is reduced corneal sensitivity and loss of corneal reflex which is the earliest sign of acoustic neuroma. Numbness or paresthesia of face may occur. Involvement of Vth nerve indicates that tumor is roughly 2. 5 cm in diameter and occupies the CP angle. VIP nerve:- Sensory fibres of facial nerve are involved. There is hypoesthesia of posterior meatal wall (Hitzelberg's sign), loss of taste, and loss of lacrimation on Schirmer's test. Motor fibres are more resistant. IXth and Xth nerves:- Dysphagia and hoarseness due to palatal, pharyngeal and laryngeal paralysis. Brainstem:- Ataxia, weakness, numbness of arms & legs, exaggerated tendon reflexes.

It is commonly used to validate a diagnosis of asymmetric function in the peripheral vestibular system. Calories are usually a subtest of the electronystagmography (ENG) battery of tests. Cold or warm water or air is irrigated into the external auditory canal, usually using a syringe. The temperature difference between the body and the injected water creates a convective current in the endolymph of the nearby horizontal semicircular canal. Hot and cold water produce currents in opposite directions and therefore a horizontal nystagmus in opposite directions. In patients with an intact brainstem: - If the water is warm (44degC or above) endolymph in the ipsilateral horizontal canal rises, causing an increased rate of firing in the vestibular afferent nerve. - This situation mimics a head turn to the ipsilateral side. - Both eyes will turn toward the contralateral ear, with horizontal nystagmus to the ipsilateral ear. If the water is cold, relative to body temperature (30degC or below), the endolymph falls within the semicircular canal, decreasing the rate of vestibular afferent firing. The eyes then turn toward the ipsilateral ear, with horizontal nystagmus (quick horizontal eye movements) to the contralateral ear. Absent reactive eye movement suggests vestibular weakness of the horizontal semicircular canal of the side being stimulated. In comatose patients with cerebral damage, the fast phase of nystagmus will be absent as this is controlled by the cerebrum. As a result, using cold water irrigation will result in detion of the eyes toward the ear being irrigated. If both phases are absent, this suggests the patient's brainstem reflexes are also damaged and carries a very poor prognosis One mnemonic used to remember the FAST direction of nystagmus is COWS.

In the Weber test, a 512 Hz tuning fork is placed on the patient's forehead. If the sound lateralizes (is louder on one side than the other), the patient may have either an ipsilateral conductive hearing loss or a contralateral sensorineural hearing loss. The Schwabach test compares the patient's bone conduction to that of the examiner's. If the patient stops hearing before the examiner, this suggests a sensorineural loss.

SOM is an insidious condition in which there is thick or sticky non-purulent fluid behind the eardrum in the middle ear, but there is no ear infection, i. e., effusion of middle ear without infection. Fluid in the middle ear is sterile. SOM occurs most commonly in school going children and SOM is the commonest cause of childhood hearing loss. Etiopathogenesis1) Eustachian tube dysfunction. Eustachian tube dysfunction, coupled with recurrent upper respiratory tract infection is the most impoant factor in the development of SOM. Normally eustachian tube helps to drain fluids to prevent them from building up in the ear. In Eustachian tube dysfunction, it is unable to drain the fluid. Following can cause Eustachian tube block:-Respiratory tract infection:- Adenoid, rhinitis, tonsillitis, sinusitis. Allergies. Benign and malignant tumor of nasophar-ynx. 2) Unresolved otitis media. Inadequate antibiotic therapy in acute suppurative otitis media may inactivate infection but fails to resolve it completely. Low grade infection lingers on and acts as stimulus for mucosa to secrete more fluid. Clinical features. Unlike children with an ear infection (ASOM), children with SOM do not act sick. o The only presenting symptom may be hearing loss with fullness in ear. Otoscopic finding of SOMAir bubbles on the surface of ear drum. Fluid behind the eardrum. Dullness of the eardrum when a light is used, with loss of light reflex. o Eardrum may appear yellow, grey or bluish in colour. Retracted eardrum with decreased mobility.

The treatment of choice is complete surgical removal of polyp along with removal of lining of maxillary sinus to prevent the recurrence.

Most of the time, avulsion fails to remove the polyp and antral lining completely. 2) Intranasal polypectomy It was the treatment of choice for all age groups prior to the advent of endoscopic sinus surgery and is still the treatment of choice in those setups where endoscopic surgery is not practised. 3) Caldwell Luc operation It is indicated if there is a recurrence and the age of the patient is more than 17 years.

Sound produced by outer hair cells travels in a reverse direction: Outer hair cells basilar membrane - Perilymph Oval window Ossicles - Tympanic membrane Ear canal. OAEs are present when outer hair cells are healthy and are absent when they are damaged and thus help to test the function of cochlea. Types of OAEs OAEs are two types: - Spontaneous OAEs: - They are present in healthy normal hearing persons where hearing loss does not exceed 30 dB. They may be absent in 50% of normal persons. Evoked OAEs: - There are produced by sound stimulus and they are subdivided into two types depending on the sound stimulus used to elicit them:- Transient evoked OAEs (TEOAEs):- Evoked by click. Distoion product OAEs (DPOAEs):- Two tones are simultaneously presented to the cochlea to produce distoion products. OAEs are absent in 50% of normal individuals, lesions of cochlea, middle ear disorders (as sound travelling in reverse direction cannot be picked up) and when hearing loss exceeds 30 dB. Uses of otoacoustic emissions OAEs are used as a screening test of hearing in neonate and to test hearing in uncooperative or mentally challenged individuals after sedation. Sedation does not interfere with OAEs. They help to distinguish cochlear from retrocochlear hearing loss. OAEs are absent in cochlear lesions, e. g. ototoxic sensorineural hearing loss. They detect ototoxic effects earlier than pure-tone audiometry. OAEs are also useful to diagnose retrocochlear pathology, especially auditory neuropathy. Auditory neuropathy is a neurologic disorder of CN VIII. Audiometric tests, e. g. SNHL for pure tones, impaired speech discrimination score, absent or abnormal auditory brainstem response, show a retrocochlear type of lesion but OAEs are normal.",

This type of injury: May be congenital, possibly due to bih trauma. May be accidental injury. May be caused by inadverent incision for drainage of parotid abscess. May occasionally follow superficial parotidectomy. Clinical features: There is flushing and sweating of the skin innervated by the auriculotemporal nerve paicularly during meal and presence of cutaneous hyperaesthesia in front and above (the ear the area supplied by the auriculotemporal nerve.) - The postganglionic parasympathetic fibres become united to the sympathetic nerves from the superior cervical ganglion which are concerned to supply vessels and sweat glands of that region. This causes flushing and sweating of the skin. Following injury to the auriculotemporal nerve, postganglionic parasympathetic fibres from the otic ganglion grow down the sheaths of the cutaneous filaments, so hyperaesthesia follows stimulation of the secretomotor nerves. Treatment: If the symptoms persist, the treatment is avulsion of the auriculotemporal nerve in front of the auricle where it lies just posterior to the superficial temporal vessels.",
