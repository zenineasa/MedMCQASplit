Volume cycled assist control mode of ventilation is the most commonly used mode of ventilation. Volume targeted modes deliver a preset volume unless a specified circuit pressure limit is exceeded. Its major advantages are capacity to deliver unvarying tidal volumes, flexibility of flow and volume adjustments, and power to ventilate difficult patients. Disadvantages of this type of ventilation are: Unless the airway is well sealed volume cycled modes cannot ventilate effectively and consistently. After the flow rate and profile are set the inflation time of machine is set and remains unresponsive to patients native cycling rythm and flow demands.

        "exp": "C i. e. Ataracurium In pediatric patients the choice of non depolarizing muscle relaxant depends on side effects and duration of action. The method of excretion of atracurium and cisatracurium (Hofman elimination and ester hydrolysis) makes these relaxants paicularly useful in newborns and children with liver or renal diseaseQ. If tachycardia is desired (eg with fentanyl anesthesia), pancuronium would be an appropriate choice. Vecuronium, atracurium, rocuronium & cisatracurium are useful for shoer procedures. Rocuronium offers an advantage that it can be administered intramuscularly (like Sch) preferably in deltoid however, the duration of action is - 1 hour, which could be a distinct disadvantage for a brief procedure. Vecuronium is valuable because no histamine is released; however, its duration of action is prolonged in newborns, which makes it similar to pancuronium The potential for rhabdomyolysis & hyperkalemia (paicularly in boys < 8 yrs who may have unrecognized muscular dystrophy), as well as for masseter spasm (jaws of steel), malignant hypehermia, cardiac arrhythmias, and myoglobinemia after administration of succinyl choline suggests that Sch should not be used routinely in children. Unlike adult patients profound bradycardia & sinus node arrest can develop in pediatric patients following 1st dose of Sch without atropine pretreatment. If a child unexpectedly experiences cardiac arrest following Sch administration, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Howeve, it is the only available ultrasho acting muscle relaxant that provides a dependable, rapid onset of action. IV use of Sch should be limited to children who have full stomach or to treat laryngospasm. Intramuscular, intralingual (Submental) use is indicated for children with difficult intravenous access when control of airway is deemed essential. Mivacurium is an alternative to Sch when profound neuromuscular block of sho duration is required but rapid onset of action is unnecessary. Antagonism of neuromuscular blockade in all neonates & small infants, is recommended, even if they have recovered clinically, because any increase in work of breathing may cause fatigue and respiratory failure. Sugammadex, a cyclodextrin whose endoskeleton forms a water soluble complex with exoskeleton of rocuronium, is designed to antagonize the effects of rocuronium. As it is made of sugars and antagonize by covalent bonding the side effects are minimal. Antagonism is more rapid than neostigmine/atropine. It also reverse the other steroidal relaxants vecuronium & pancuronium to a lesser extent. The mechanism of reversal is lowering of plasma conentation & thus reversing the concentration gradient and pulling the rocuronium off the myoneural junction.",

Diazepam use has become less common as newer shoer-acting benzodiazepines have become available. Lorazepam is more potent than midazolam and, because of its low lipid solubility, crosses the blood-brain barrier more slowly, delaying its onset of action and prolonging the sedative effect. Hence, it is recommended for longer-term sedation while midazolam is preferred for sho-term sedation Propofol, another frequently used sedative agent, resembles midazolam in terms of pharmacological profile. Midazolam and propofol have similar efficacy and safety in sedating various groups of critically ill patients. Midazolam is, however, cheaper than propofol Neveheless, propofol, when used as a sedative in mechanically ventilated patients, is associated with shoer weaning times and hence, while midazolam may be cheaper, the overall cost-benefit analysis taking into account duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay may in fact be better with propofol.",

        "exp": "Ans. C: Ketamine Ketamine is classified as an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspaate) receptor antagonist, and at high, fully anesthetic level doses, ketamine has also been found to bind to opioid (mu) receptors and sigma receptors. Like other drugs of this class such as tiletamine and phencyclidine (PCP), it induces a state referred to as \"dissociative anaesthesia\" and is used as a recreational drug. Ketamine has a wide range of effects in humans, including analgesia, anaesthesia, hallucinations, elevated blood pressure, and bronchodilation. It is primarily used for the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia, usually in combination with some sedative drug. Ketamine is usually injected intravenously or intramuscularly, but it is also effective when insufflated, smoked, or taken orally. When used at anaesthetic doses, it will usually stimulate rather than depress the circulatory system, so I/ V anaesthetic of choice for shock. Ketainine produces a dissociative state, characterised by a sense of detachment from one's physical body and the external world which is known as depersonalization and derealization. At sufficiently high doses users may experience what is coined the \"K-hole\", a state of dissociation whose effects are thought to mimic the phenomenology of schizophrenia.",

Clinical manifestations 1. CNS manifestations These are the most common manifestations of toxicity. CNS lidocaine toxicity is biphasic Earlier manifestations-are due to CNS excitation e. g. convulsions Subsequent manifestations -are due to CNS depression drowsiness, disorientation, respiratory depression. The cause of biphasic response is Local anaesthetic action first blocks inhibitary CNS pathways-resulting in stimulation Eventually blocks both inhibitory and excitatory pathways- overall CNS depression 2. Cardiovascular manifestations These occur at higher serum concentrations There may be cardiac depression, hypotension, coma, respiratory arrest. Note: lignocaine can precipitate malignant hypehermia Management of toxicity If lignocaine toxicity is suspected, stop the injection immediately. Ensure adequate oxygenation, whether by face mask or by intubation. Anticonvulsants such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates are the drug of choice for seizure control. Succinykholine is sometimes also used to terminate the neuromuscular effects of seizures. If CVS symptoms occur (cardiac depression and hypotension), IVfluid and vasopressor agents may be required.

It is the backward continuation of the nerve fibre layer of the retina, which consists of the second order neurons i. e., axon originating from the ganglion cells. It also contains the afferent fibres of the papillary light reflex. Morphologically and embryologically, the optic nerve is comparable to a sensory tract. Unlike peripheral nerves it is not covered by neurilemma (so it does not regenerate when cut). The fibres of optic nerve, numbering about a million, are very fine (2-10 m in diameter as compared to 20 mm of sensory nerves). Optic nerve is about 47-50 mm in length and can be divided into 4 pas:? Intraocular pa (1 mm): - It begins at optic disc (optic nerve head) and exits the nerve through a hole in sclera that is occupied by a mesh like structure called the lamina cribrosa. The nerve fibres from the retina leave the eye through pores (holes) in lamina cribrosa, a sieve-like structure made up of collagen meshwork. Intraorbital pa (30 mm): - Extends from back of the eyeball (at lamina cribrosa) to the optic foramina. Intracanalicular pa (6-9 mm): - It lies within the optic canal and closely related to ophthalmic aery which crosses obliquely over it. Intracranial pa (10 mm): - It lies above the cavernous sinus and converges with its fellow from contralateral side to form optic chiasma.

Vaso vagal attack Total spinal anesthesia - Ocurs if the large volume of LA used for epidural -anesthesia is injected into subarachnoid space i. e. it occurs following epidural/caudal anesthesia, if there is inadveent intrathecal injection of large volume of drugs. - It occurs after (not during injection) Vasovagal attack or emotional fainting (Syncope) Likely to occur paicularly in an anxious patient with a rapidly ascending spinal block. It may occur instantaneously even during the procedure (e. g. spinal)Q. Pallor, nausea and (neurocardiogenic) bradycardia or asystole are a/w hypotension and fainting. Rapid resolution results from placing the patient in head down position and administration of iv ephedrine or atropine. Systemic toxicity - If large amount of LA reach the tissues of heart and brain they exe the same membrane stabilizing effect as on nerve resulting in progressive depression of function. The earliest feature is numbness or tingling of tongue and circumoral area; b/o rich blood supply to these tissue depositing enough drug to have an effect on nerve endings. The patient may beome light headed, anxious, drowsy and or complain of tinnitus. Convulsions, loss of consciousness, coma and apnoea may develop subsequently. Cardiovascular collapse may result from direct myocardial depression and vasodilation or hypoxemia d/t apnoea. - The most ommon cause is accidental intravascular injectionQ but it may also result from absolute overdose during blocks. System absorption of LA is greatest after intercostal nerve block and caudal anesthesia; intermediate after epidural anesthesia > brachial plexus > sciatic & femoral nerve block; and least after infiltration anesthesia.",

Local anesthetic binding to Na channels does not alter the resting membrane potential. With increasing local anesthetic concentrations, an increasing fraction of the Na channels in the membrane bind a local anesthetic molecule and cannot conduct Na ions. As a consequence, impulse conduction slows, the rate of rise and the magnitude of the action potential decrease, and the threshold for excitation and impulse conduction increases progressively. At high enough local anesthetic concentrations and with a sufficient fraction of local anesthetic-bound Na channels, an action potential can no longer be generated and impulse propagation is abolished.

They are usually due to blunt trauma caused by a large object such as a cricket ball, human fist etc. o Most commonly the orbital floor blows, but it can also affect the medial wall of the orbit. The most common site for a blowout fracture to occur is the posteromedial aspect of the orbital floor, medial to the infraorbital neurovascular bundle where the maxillary bone is very thin. Lamina papyracea is also thin and the medial orbital wall is also prone to fracture. Although the lamina papyracea is thinner than the maxilla, the existence of ethmoid air cells reinforce the medial wall like corrugated paper or a beehive. The orbital floor overlies the maxillary sinus without reinforcement, therefore is weaker and more blowouts tend to occur here especially in the posteromedial floor (near the infraorbital groove), where it is the weakest area. Fracture of the floor causes the orbital contents to collapse into the maxillary sinus, causing enophthalmos and entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle. Blowout fractures are divided into pure and impure. The term pure orbital blowout fracture is used to describe a fracture of the orbital floor, the medial orbital floor or both, with an intact bony orbital margin. The term impure orbital blowout fracture is used when such fractures occur in combination with a fracture of the orbital rim.",

Celiac plexus The celiac plexus is situated retroperitoneally in the upper abdomen. It is at the level of T12 and L1 veebrae, anterior to the crura of the diaphragm. It is the main junction for autonomic nerves supplying the upper abdominal organs (Liver, gallbladder, spleen, stomach, pancreas, kidneys, small bowel and 2/3 of the large bowel). The ganglia lie on each side of LI (aoa lying posteriorly, pancreas anteriorly and inferior venacava laterally). The plexus is composed of network of neve fibres from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Sympathetic supply:? It contains two large ganglia that receive sympathetic fibres from three splanchnic nerves - Greater splanchnic nerves (TIT, to TIT() - Lesser splanchnic nerves (Tio/T,, ) - Least splanchnic nerves (Tii/T, 2) Parasympathetic supply - From the left and right vagal trunks which pass through the celiax plexus but do not connect there. Technique The block is performed using X-ray screening, intravenous sedation, local anaesthetic infiltration of the superficial layers with the patient in the prone position. Indications of celiac plexus block For releief of pain from nonpelvic intraabdominal organs. Acute pain - may be performed during surgery for postoperative pain relief. Chronic pain - useful for any condition that causes chronic severe upper abdominal visceral pain e. g. chronic pancreatitis (local anaesthetic blocks only). Cancer pain - useful for upper abdominal organ cancer pain and is frequently used for carcinoma of the pancreas Complications of coeliac plexus block:- Ohostatic hypotension:? This is the most common complication of coeliac plexus block. It is more common when retrocrural pr splanchnic technique was used. Treatment includes resting in bed, avoiding changes in position and replacing fluids. Once compensatory vascular reflexes are fully activated this side effect disappears. Backache It results from retroperitoneal hematoma which is formed due to local trauma.

First IV canula is inseed usually in the dorsum of hand. Then tourniquet cuff is applied to proximal arm. Limb is elevated and exsanguinated with the help of an elastic bandage (Esmarch). Now tourniquet cuff is inflated above systolic pressure (so that no blood can enter in that limb and the limb remains exsanguinated). Now the local anaesthetic solution is slowly injected into cannula. The veins are filled with only local anaesthetic as there is no blood -ocal anaesthetic can not be drained out from upper limb and can not enter in systemic circulation because of inflated cuff in proximal arm. The arm is anaesthetized in 6-8 minutes. Lidocaine without adrenaline is the DOC for this technique. --Goodman & Gilman llthie 381 o A few clinician prefers prilocaine over lidocaine because of its higher therapeutic index - least toxic LA.

In these cases emergency airway management is essential.

S. F. rhinorrhoea. Orotracheal intubation in patients with severe maxillofacial injury In patients with severe maxillofacial injuries orotracheal intubation is also difficult. Presence of blood clots,. fractures make the passage of the tube quite difficult. Moreover when the surgeons perform operation for mandibular or maxillary fractures they wires both these together. If surgery is required with severe maxillofacial injury surgeons usually prefer nasotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. Tracheostomy in patient with severe maxillofacial injury:? Tracheostomy does not have much role in \"emergency airways management\". - Tracheostomy is a time taking procedure compared to intubation. - If the airways of the patient is severely compromised and he requires immediate oxygenation, tracheostomy has no role. - Immediate oxygenation can only be delivered by rapid intubation. In case, intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative. -In emergency management of the airway, cricothyroidotomy is done if intubation is not possible. Tracheostomy is only done when immediate oxygen requirements are taken care of and a surgical procedure is planned. In the question the Sp02 of the patient is 80% when on oxygen. He requires immediate emergency management of the airway which can be achieved through intubation, If intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative.

It also blocks neuronal re uptake of nor epinephrine thus potentiating adrenergic activity. Ocular effects of cocaine includes anaesthesia, mydriasis and vasoconstriction. Mydriatic effect of cocaine depends upon presence of a functioning adrenergic innervation. Procaine causes vasodilation hence it is usually given with adrenaline. The main shocomings of procaine are: Being a vasodilator, when it is given in the absence of a vasoconstrictor agent procaine is rapidly absorbed into the circulation and hydrolysed by plasma cholinesterase. Hypersensitivity to procaine is commonly encountered. Ref: Clinical Ocular Pharmacology edited by Jimmy D. page 119. Principles of Pharmacology: A Tropical Approach By D. T. Okpako page 403.",

        "question": "Anaesthesia used in microlaryngoscopy is",
        "exp": "C i. e. Pollarad tube with infiltration block When fire breaks out during laser vocal cord surgery, oxygen should be turned off, ventilation stopped, tracheal tube removed and submerged in water and the patient should be ventilated with facemasK. Airway damage is assessed with bronchoscopy and bronchial lavage, steroids, can be used for treatment. Anesthesia for Endoscopic Surgeries of Airway Endoscopy includes laryngoscopy, microlaryngoscopy (i. e. aided by an operating microscope), bronchoscopy & oesophagoscopy. These procedures may be accompanied by laser surgery. Microlaryngoscopic surgeries include biopsy / surgery of laryngeal malignancy, vocal cord polyps etc. It is associated with some specific problems as - common field for anesthetist & surgeon, already reduced glottic opening d/t growth, laryngospasm (mediated by superior laryngeal nerve) d/t laryngeal stimulation, very high chances of aspiration and myocardial ischemia (- 4% due to sympethetic stimulation). Preoperative Considerations - Sedative premedication is contraindicated in any patient with any significant degree of upper airway obstructionQ, d/t fear of aspiration. Glycopyrrolate, 1 hour before surgery minimize secretions, thereby facilitate ventilation. Pethidine & promethazine are only given if there is no airway obstruction. Laser Precautions General laser precautions include wearing protective spectacles to prevent retinal damage and evacuation of toxic fumes (laser plume) from tissue vaporization which may have potential to transmit microbacterial diseases. Greatest fear during laser airway surgery is a tracheal tube fire. This can be avoided by using a technique of ventilation that does not involve a flammable tube or catheter (eg intermittent apnea or jet ventilation through the laryngoscope side po). The potential fuel source should have laser resistant propeies (laser tubes or wrapping a tracheal tube with metallic tape) or be removed (supraglottic jet ventilation technique). The only non inflammable, laser proof tube is the all metal. Noon tube, which has no cuff. Most laser tubes have laser resistant propeies around the shaft, but the cuff is not protected and can ignite. So there are double cuffs to seal the airway- if upper cuff is struck by laser and saline escapes, the lower cuff will continue to seal the airway. No cuffed tracheal tube, or any currently available tube protection is completely laser proof. Therefore, whenever laser airway surgery is being performed with a tracheal tube in place, the following precaution should be observed. - Inspired 02 conc. should be as low as possible may be upto 21% - N20 suppo combustion & should be replaced with air (N2) or heliumQ - Tracheal tube cuffs should be filled with saline dyed with methylene blue to dessipate heat & signal cuff rupture - A cuffed tube will minimize 02 conc. in the parynx. The addition of 2% lidocaine jelly (1: 2 mixture with saline) can seal small laser induced cuff leaks, potentially preventing combustion - Laser intensity & duration should be limited as much as possible. - Saline soaked pledgets (completely saturated) should be placed in the airway to limit risk of ignition. - A source of water (60 ml) should be immediately available in case of fire. Muscle Relaxation Profound muscle relaxation is the aim to provide masseter muscle relaxation for introduction of suspension laryngoscope & an immobile surgical field. - Anesthesia is induced with IV induction agent followed by a non depolarizing muscle relaxant; the vocal cords are sprayed with 3 ml lidocaine 4% to assist smooth anesthesia & to minimize the possibility of postextubation laryngospasmQ - Alternatively the cords may be painted with 3% cocaine at the end of procedure, which has the added advantage of reducing bleeding from operative site. Oxygentation & Ventilation - Microlaryngoscopy tubes are long, have a small internal and external diameter, and are designed specifically for endoscopic procedures (but not suitable for laser surgery). Typically 4 to 5 mm internal diameter tubes with high volume, low pressure cuffs are used in nasal or oral versions. The most popular anesthetic technique use a Coplan's microlaryngoscopy tube (5mm ID, 31cm long, 10m1 cuff volume and constructed from soft plastic). It is designed for micro laryngeal surgery or for patient whose airway has been narrowed to such an extent that a normal sized tracheal tube cannot be inseed. The small tube diameter provides better visibility and access to surgical field but may lit incomplete exhalation and occlusion. - Most commonly the patients are intubated with small diameter (4 - 6 mm) tracheal tubesQ; - Standandard tracheal tubes of this size, however, are designed for pediatric patients. They tend to be too sho for adult trachea (in length)Q with a low volume cuff that will exe high pressure against it - A 4 - 6 mm microlaryngea tracheal (MLT) tubes (Mallinckrodt critical Care) is the same length as the adult tube, has dispropoionately large high volume low pressure cuff, and is stiffer and less prone to compression than a regular tracheal tube. - The advantages of intubation include - protection against aspiration, and the ability to administer inhalational anesthetics and enable monitoring of ventilation by capnography and spirometry, by measuring end tidal CO2Q - In some cases (eg those involving posterior commissure), intubation may interfere with surgeon's visualization and then alternatives are: 1. Insufflation of high flows of oxygen through small catheter placed in the trachea 2. Intermittent apnea technique.

It causes mild reduction in peripheral vascular resistance which may cause a slight decline in aerial blood pressure. Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate does not release histamine. Cardiovascular effect of Propofol: The major cardiovascular effect of propofol is a decrease in aerial blood pressure due to a drop in systemic vascular resistance (inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, cardiac contractility and preload). Propofol markedly impairs the normal aerial baroreflex response to hypotension. Sometimes there may be a marked drop in preload. Cardiovascular effect of barbiturates (Thiopental) The cardiovascular effect of barbiturates vary markedly depending on the volume status, basline autonomic tone and preexisting cardiovascular disease. Normally, intravenously administered barbiturates cause a fall in blood pressure. Cardiac output is maintained due to increase in heart rate and increased myocardial contractility from compensatory baroreceptor reflexes. However, in the absence of adequate baroreceptor response (e. g., hypovolemia. congestive heart, failure, 13 adrenergic blockade) cardiac output and aerial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated pooling and unmasked direct myocardial depression. Effect of ketamine on cardiovascular system Ketamine causes central stimulation of sympathetic system which causes increased aerial blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. There is also increase in pulmonary aery pressure and myocardial work. Because of these effects, ketamine should be avoided in patients with coronary aery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure and aerial aneurysms.",

In patients or addicts who are tolerant to the depressant effects of meperidine, large doses repeated at sho interval may produce an excitatory syndrome including hallncination, tremors, muscle twitches, dilated pupils, hyperactive reflexes and convulsions. These excitatory symptoms are d/t accumulation of normeperidine, which has a half life of 15-20 hours, compared to 3 hours for meperidine. In patients with cirrhosis, the bioavailability of meperidine is --80% increased and t1/2 of both meperidine and normeperidine are prolonged. Since normeperidine is eleminated by kidney and liver, decreased renal or hepatic function predispose to neurotoxic effects of nor-meperidineQ. Meperidine is also not recommended for the treatment of chronic pain b/o concerns of metabolite toxicity. It should not be used for longer than 48 hours or in doses > 600 mg/day. Major pathway for morphine metabolism is conjugation with glucuronic acid forming morphine -6- glucuronide and morphine -3- glucuronide. Morphine-6-glucuronide is twice as potent as morphine with somewhat longer t1/2. (t1/2 of morphine is 2 hours) and pharmacological actions indistinguishable from those of morphine. With chronic morphine administration, the 6-glucuronide accounts for most of analgesia and its blood levels exceed those of morphine. Morphine-6-glucuronide is excreted by kidney, so its levels increase in renal failure, perhaps explaining morphine's potency and long action in compromised renal function. So in patients with renal failure decreased protein binding of morphine (resulting in higher plasma free drug level) and accumulation of morphine -6- glucuronide predispose them to respiratory depression. So morphine is given cautiously in low doses in renal failure. Respiratory depression is also repoed in patients with CRF receiving sufentanyl. Except for slightly decreased protein binding, the free drug volume of distribution and clearance of alfentanil appears to be unaffected by renal failure. Fentanyl, has sho half life and its metabolites are inactive. Therefore, it is a good choice in patients with renal diseaseQ. In renal disease (renal failure) remifentanil > fentanyl > alfentanil > sufentanil are safe. Whereas morphine (d/t morphine 6 glucoronide) 1/t respiratory depression is used very cautiously in low dose and meperidine (pethidine) is contraindicated d/t very long acting metabolite nor-meperidine causing neurotoxic excitatory syndrome.",

Since this patient has a history of hypersensitivity to neostigmine, atracurium can be used in this patient as it does not require reversal. Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants acts by blocking the postsynaptic receptors in a competitive manner so that acetylcholine cannot occupy the receptors to activate depolarization. Neostigmine acts by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase in the cleft of neuromuscular junctions which inturn leads to building up of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft thereby reversing the effects of non depolarizing muscle relaxants that are competitive agonists.

        "question": "Mechanism of action of curare is?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Reducing end plate potential Curare (D-tubocurarine) is a competitive neuromuscular blocker. All neuromuscular blockers bind to Nm receptors on end-plate and prevents generation of end-plate potential. Mechanism of action of muscle relaxants To know the mechanism of action of different skeletal muscle relaxants one should know the normal sequences of events in contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle? A. Contraction There is discharge of motor neuron. Release of Ach at neuromuscular junction. Binding of Ach to nicotinic (NM) cholinergic receptors at end plate. Binding of Ach to nicotinic receptors causes opening of Na.* channels (NM receptor has intrinsic ion channel). Opening of Na+channel generate end plate potential on skeletal muscle membrane. If end plate potential is above a threshold level, action potential is generated on skeletal muscle membrane- depolarization. Depolarization of skeletal muscle membrane causes intracellular release of Ca\" from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca\" binds to troponin 'c', uncovering myosin binding site of actin. Cross linking between actin and myosin, and sliding of thin filaments on thick filaments - contraction. B. Relaxation Ca\" pumped back into sarcoplasmic reticulum. Release of Ca\" from Troponin. Cessation of interaction between actin and myosin - relaxation. Now coming back to the mechanism of different skeletal muscle relaxants. Competitive (nondepolarising) blockers The competitive blockers have affinity for N. receptors but no intrinsic activity. They compete with Ach for N receptor --) called competitive blockers. They prevent binding of Ach to N. receptors- No opening of Na- channels - No depolarization, so these are called non-depolarizing blockers. Competitive blockers reduce the frequency of channel opening but not its duration or the conductance of a channel once it has opened. When the magnitude of end plate potential falls below a critical level, it is unable to trigger propagated muscle action potential muscle fails to contract. Neostigmine (anticholinesterases) antagonises competitive blockers. Depolarizing blockers Depolarizing blockers have affinity as well as submaximal intrinsic activity on A r receptors. They depolarize muscle end plates by opening of Na+ channels and initially produce twitching and fasciculations (not full contraction as these drugs have submaximal activity)-o, they are called depolarizing blocker. These drugs do not dissociate rapidly from the receptor (NM) - Persistant paial depolarization- Na+ channels get inactivated - flaccid paralysis. Neostigmine does not antagonise depolarising blockers. Under ceain conditions depolarizing agents produce dual mechanism of neuromuscular blockade which can be divided into two phases: a. Phase I block Rapid in onset Result from persistant depolarization of muscle end plate. Has classical features of depolarization block. Block is not antogonized by anticholinesterases (neostigmine). b. Phase H block Slow in onset Results from desensitization of receptor to ACh. Resembles block produced by competitive blockers. Block is paially reversed by anticholinesterases (Neostigmine). In man normally only phase I block is seen typical depolarizing block. Phase II block is seen when fluorinated anaesthetics have been given or when SCh is injected in high dose. SCh also produces phase II block in patients with atypical or deficient pseudocholinesterase.",

Mitral stenosis is a disorder where cardiac output remains relatively fixed. Decrease in cardiac output should he avoided at any cost. - Any drug that increases the heart rate will reduce the cardiac output in patient with M. S. All the inhalational agents mentioned in the question decrease systemic vascular resistance and also increase the heart rate. Decrease in systemic vascular resistance leads to fall in blood pressure. Moreover, they may also decrease B. P. by their cardiodepressant action on myocardium. Therefore these drugs should not be used in patients with M. S. \"Xenon has no effects on cardiac output or cardiac rhythum and is not thought to have significant effect on systemic vascular resistance It also does not affect pulmonary function and is not known to have any renal or hepatic toxicity\". The main drawback of Xenon is its high cost and insufficient availability. -Xenon is an ine gas which is quite difficult to obtain and hence extremely expensive. - Xenon has received considerable interest in the last few years because it has many characteristics approaching those of an \"ideal\" inhaled anaesthetics. Mitral stenosis Due to mitral stenosis less blood. flows through the mitral valve to left ventricle. Left ventricle functions normally but is small and poorly. filled. Initially the left ventricle dilates keeping the pulmonary aery pressure low. As disease progresses pulmonary aery pressure increases and medial hyperophy develops resulting in chronic reactive pulmonary hypertension. The right heart hyperophies to pump against a pressure overload, then. fails. The pressure gradient across the narrow mitral orifice increase with the square of cardial output. Rapid heart rates, especially with atrial fibrillation decreases diastolic. filling time and markedly decreases cardiac output. Li /. filling is optimized by slow heart rate. Hemodynamic goals Low normal heart rate 50-70/min, treat tachycardia aggressively with /8 blockers. Maintain sinus rhythmus if possible. Maintain adequate preload Maintain high normal systemic vascular resistance Avoid hypercarbia, acidosis and hypoxia which may exacerbate pulmonary hypertension. The cardiac output is relatively fixed, maintain adequate afterload, slow the heart rate and avoid hypovolemia. Measure CVP and PAOP and maintain high preload. Avoid rapid decrease in afterload.",

        "exp": "Ans.: C: Propofol Propofol is a sho-acting, intravenously administered hypnotic agent. Its uses include the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia, sedation for mechanically ventilated adults, and procedural sedation. Propofol is unrelated to barbiturates, and has largely replaced sodium thiopental (Pentothal) for induction of anaesthesia because recovery from propofol is more rapid and \"clear\" when compared with thiopental. Propofol is not considered an analgesic, so opioids such as fentanyl may be combined with propofol to allete pain and it is the agent of choice for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). It is used to produce sedation in ICU. It is the agent of choice for induction in susceptible individuals for malignant hypehermia. Due to its amnestic effects and appearance as a white liquid, propofol has been humorously dubbed \"milk of amnesia\".",

If the inhaled Concentration of anaesthetic is high (eg N20), Substantial loss of alveolar gas volume will occur and it creates negative intralveolar pressure that leads to removal of more gas from cylinder to alveoli --> Concentration effect. If another inhalation agent is (eg Halothane) is being given at the same time, it also will be delivered to lung from the cylinder (due to negative intraalveolar pressure) --> Second gas effect. During recovery reverse occurs - N20 having low blood solubility, rapidly diffuses into alveoli and dilutes the alveolar air --> paial pressure of oxygen in alveoli is reduced. The resulting hypoxia is known as diffusion hypoxia. Diffusion hypoxia can be prevented by continuing 100% 02 inhalation for a few minutes after discontinuing N20, instead of straight away switching over to air. Remember Concentration effect and secondary gas effect during induction. Diffusion hypoxia --> during recovering. All these occur with N20 only",

The tube in trachea can be put nose (nasotracheal), oral cavity (orotracheal) or trachea itself (tracheostomy). - Ideally tracheostomy should be performed under GA. And technically tracheostomy with an awake local anesthetic in a patient with severe airway compromise is difficult because the ideal positioning with an extended head and supine is often not tolerated by patient, and the procedure is to be undeaken in a semi upright sitting position. Because tracheostomy is a relatively time taking procedure in comparison to intubation, it does not have much role in emergency airway managementQ. Tracheostomy is usually done when immediate 02 requirements are taken care of by rapid intubation and prolonged intubation is plannedQ (>1 to 2-3 weeks). However, if intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an emergency procedure. So option D is excluded. Orotracheal intubation using rapid sequence induction is the technique of choice for resuscitationQ. And nasotracheal intubation is preferred in awake patients.

This may result in a found continuous precordial murmur, the so called \"Mill wheel murmur\". Two conditions must exist for venous air embolism to occur: - A direct communication between a source of air and the vasculature and - A pressure gradient ouring the passage of air into the circulation. Air embolism can occur whenever a blood vessel is open and a pressure gradient exists ouring entry of gas. Because the pressure in most aeries and veins is greater than atmospheric pressure an air embolus does not always happen when a blood vessel is injured. In the veins above the heart, such as in the head and neck, the pressure is less than atmospheric and an injury may let air in. This is one reason why surgeons must be paicularly careful when operating on the brain. The key factors determining the degree of morbidity and moality in venous air emboli are? The volume of the gas entrapped. The rate of accumulation and The patient's position at the time of event. Generally small amounts of air are broken up in the capillary bed and absorbed from the circulation without producing symptoms. Traditionally it has been estimated that more than 5 ml/kg of air displaced into the intravenous space is required for significant injury (shock or cardiac arrest to occu). It a large amount of air gets lodged in the heart; it stops the flow of the blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. This results in significant rise in pulmonary aery pressures. This increase in pulmonary aery pressures can lead to right ventricular outflow obstruction and fuher compromise pulmonary venous return to the left heart. The diminished pulmonary venous return will lead to decreased left ventricular preload with resultant decreased cardiac output and eventual systemic cardiovascular collapse. In patients with patent foramen ovale the air entrapped can travel to the left side of the heart and on to the brain or coronary aeries. This can lead to most serious of air embolism symptoms. Diagnosis Dopple ultrasounddeg is the most sensitive noninvasive method to detect air embolism. Transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than Doppler ultrasound but is also more invasivedeg and technically more difficult to place and to interpret. The pulmonary aery catheter is the next most sensitive monitor. Mass spectrometry. for end tidal nitrogen is as sensitive as the pulmonary aery catheter. End tidal carbon di-oxide measurement decreases during air embolism. - But decrease in ETCO2 is not specific for air embolism. Hypoventilatiorz, low cardiac output, other types of emboli and COPD can also decrease ETCO2. The least sensitive method to detect air embolism is the precordial or esophageal stethoscope. On stethoscope - \"mill wheel murmur\" is detected Clinical signs of Air embolism Abrupt fall in end tidal CO2 is usually the first sign Hypotension Tachycardia Cyanosis Mill wheel murmur Cardiovascular collapse",

        "exp": "Xenon [Ref: Morgan's Anaesthesia 4/e p 781, 166, 167; Miller's Anaesthesia p 626, 6491 Xenon seems to be the best answer because all other inhalational anaesthetics mentioned in the question produce some cardiovascular effects that may harm the patient with mitral stenosis. Mitral stenosis is a disorder where cardiac output remains relatively fixed. Decrease in cardiac output should he avoided at any cost. - Any drug that increases the heart rate will reduce the cardiac output in patient with M. S. All the inhalational agents mentioned in the question decrease systemic vascular resistance and also increase the heart rate. Decrease in systemic vascular resistance leads to fall in blood pressure. Moreover, they may also decrease B. P. by their cardiodepressant action on myocardium. Therefore these drugs should not be used in patients with M. S. \"Xenon has no effects on cardiac output or cardiac rhythum and is not thought to have significant effect on systemic vascular resistance It also does not affect pulmonary function and is not known to have any renal or hepatic toxicity\". The main drawback of Xenon is its high cost and insufficient availability. -Xenon is an ine gas which is quite difficult to obtain and hence extremely expensive. - Xenon has received considerable interest in the last few years because it has many characteristics approaching those of an \"ideal\" inhaled anaesthetics. Mitral stenosis Due to mitral stenosis less blood. flows through the mitral valve to left ventricle. Left ventricle functions normally but is small and poorly. filled. Initially the left ventricle dilates keeping the pulmonary aery pressure low. As disease progresses pulmonary aery pressure increases and medial hyperophy develops resulting in chronic reactive pulmonary hypertension. The right heart hyperophies to pump against a pressure overload, then. fails. The pressure gradient across the narrow mitral orifice increase with the square of cardial output. Rapid heart rates, especially with atrial fibrillation decreases diastolic. filling time and markedly decreases cardiac output. Li /. filling is optimized by slow heart rate. Hemodynamic goals Low normal heart rate 50-70/min, treat tachycardia aggressively with /8 blockers. Maintain sinus rhythmus if possible. Maintain adequate preload Maintain high normal systemic vascular resistance Avoid hypercarbia, acidosis and hypoxia which may exacerbate pulmonary hypertension. The cardiac output is relatively fixed, maintain adequate afterload, slow the heart rate and avoid hypovolemia. Measure CVP and PAOP and maintain high preload. Avoid rapid decrease in afterload.",

Endotracheal intubation is the best mean to protect airways. Tubes used for endotracheal intubation are:- Standard endotracheal tube RAE preformed tubes Spiral embedded (flexometallic armored tube) Microlagngeal & laryngotracheal surgery tube Colees tube & endotrol tube Double lumen tube About LMA \"The classic LMA should not be regarded as providing any protection against aspiration of regurgitated gastric contents and is contraindicated for patients who are not starved or who may have a full stomach\". -Core topics in airway management However, if LMA uses devices with an additional esophageal drainage lumen, it can be used in patients with an increased risk of aspiration. Such devices are combitube, Easytube, and intubating LMA (fastrach).",
