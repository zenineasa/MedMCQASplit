Use of high inspiratory flow rate can minimize end inspiratory lung volume and intrinsic PEEP, but it can cause higher peak airway pressures. Volume cycled assist control mode of ventilation is the most commonly used mode of ventilation. Volume targeted modes deliver a preset volume unless a specified circuit pressure limit is exceeded. Its major advantages are capacity to deliver unvarying tidal volumes, flexibility of flow and volume adjustments, and power to ventilate difficult patients. Disadvantages of this type of ventilation are: Unless the airway is well sealed volume cycled modes cannot ventilate effectively and consistently. After the flow rate and profile are set the inflation time of machine is set and remains unresponsive to patients native cycling rythm and flow demands.

        "exp": "C i. e. Ataracurium In pediatric patients the choice of non depolarizing muscle relaxant depends on side effects and duration of action. The method of excretion of atracurium and cisatracurium (Hofman elimination and ester hydrolysis) makes these relaxants paicularly useful in newborns and children with liver or renal diseaseQ. If tachycardia is desired (eg with fentanyl anesthesia), pancuronium would be an appropriate choice. Vecuronium, atracurium, rocuronium & cisatracurium are useful for shoer procedures. Rocuronium offers an advantage that it can be administered intramuscularly (like Sch) preferably in deltoid however, the duration of action is - 1 hour, which could be a distinct disadvantage for a brief procedure. Vecuronium is valuable because no histamine is released; however, its duration of action is prolonged in newborns, which makes it similar to pancuronium The potential for rhabdomyolysis & hyperkalemia (paicularly in boys < 8 yrs who may have unrecognized muscular dystrophy), as well as for masseter spasm (jaws of steel), malignant hypehermia, cardiac arrhythmias, and myoglobinemia after administration of succinyl choline suggests that Sch should not be used routinely in children. Unlike adult patients profound bradycardia & sinus node arrest can develop in pediatric patients following 1st dose of Sch without atropine pretreatment. If a child unexpectedly experiences cardiac arrest following Sch administration, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Howeve, it is the only available ultrasho acting muscle relaxant that provides a dependable, rapid onset of action. IV use of Sch should be limited to children who have full stomach or to treat laryngospasm. Intramuscular, intralingual (Submental) use is indicated for children with difficult intravenous access when control of airway is deemed essential. Mivacurium is an alternative to Sch when profound neuromuscular block of sho duration is required but rapid onset of action is unnecessary. Antagonism of neuromuscular blockade in all neonates & small infants, is recommended, even if they have recovered clinically, because any increase in work of breathing may cause fatigue and respiratory failure. Sugammadex, a cyclodextrin whose endoskeleton forms a water soluble complex with exoskeleton of rocuronium, is designed to antagonize the effects of rocuronium. As it is made of sugars and antagonize by covalent bonding the side effects are minimal. Antagonism is more rapid than neostigmine/atropine. It also reverse the other steroidal relaxants vecuronium & pancuronium to a lesser extent. The mechanism of reversal is lowering of plasma conentation & thus reversing the concentration gradient and pulling the rocuronium off the myoneural junction.",

        "exp": "Ans. C: Propofol Benzodiazepines, e. g. diazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, are widely used as sedative agents in the ICU. Diazepam use has become less common as newer shoer-acting benzodiazepines have become available. Lorazepam is more potent than midazolam and, because of its low lipid solubility, crosses the blood-brain barrier more slowly, delaying its onset of action and prolonging the sedative effect. Hence, it is recommended for longer-term sedation while midazolam is preferred for sho-term sedation Propofol, another frequently used sedative agent, resembles midazolam in terms of pharmacological profile. Midazolam and propofol have similar efficacy and safety in sedating various groups of critically ill patients. Midazolam is, however, cheaper than propofol Neveheless, propofol, when used as a sedative in mechanically ventilated patients, is associated with shoer weaning times and hence, while midazolam may be cheaper, the overall cost-benefit analysis taking into account duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay may in fact be better with propofol.",

        "exp": "Ans. b. Prevented by giving warm fluids Hypothermia during anesthesia can be prevented by giving warm fluids. Hypothermia During Anesthesia Mild hypothermia is extremely common during anesthesia and surgery. The physiological effects of hypothermia may have significant potential for detrimental effects on patient well-being. Major consequences of inadveent hypothermia include morbid myocardial events, reduced resistance to surgical wound infection, impaired coagulation, delayed recovery, and postoperative shivering. Heat loss occurs primarily from the skin of a patient to the environment through several processes, including radiation, conduction and convection, and evaporation. Of these, radiation is most significant and accounts for --60% of total heat loss. Drug metabolism can be markedly decreased by hypothermia. Although hypothermia is generally regarded as deleterious, it can be beneficial in some situations. Hypothermia decreases the overall metabolic rate by 8% per degC to about half the normal rate at 28degC. Oxygen demand drops and those tissues that have high oxygen consumption normally, such as brain and hea, have a propoionally greater reduction of oxygen use. This allows aerobic metabolism to continue through greater periods of compromised oxygen supply, thereby reducing the production of anaerobic byproducts such as superoxide radicals and lactate. Hypothermia During Anesthesia Hypothermia lowers intracranial pressures and cerebral perfusion pressure. Warming of fluids can only help to minimize heat loss. Warm fluids are probably of benefit only when large amounts are administered for fluid replacement.",

C: Ketamine Ketamine is classified as an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspaate) receptor antagonist, and at high, fully anesthetic level doses, ketamine has also been found to bind to opioid (mu) receptors and sigma receptors. Like other drugs of this class such as tiletamine and phencyclidine (PCP), it induces a state referred to as \"dissociative anaesthesia\" and is used as a recreational drug. Ketamine has a wide range of effects in humans, including analgesia, anaesthesia, hallucinations, elevated blood pressure, and bronchodilation. It is primarily used for the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia, usually in combination with some sedative drug. Ketamine is usually injected intravenously or intramuscularly, but it is also effective when insufflated, smoked, or taken orally. When used at anaesthetic doses, it will usually stimulate rather than depress the circulatory system, so I/ V anaesthetic of choice for shock. Ketainine produces a dissociative state, characterised by a sense of detachment from one's physical body and the external world which is known as depersonalization and derealization.

Clinical manifestations 1. CNS manifestations These are the most common manifestations of toxicity. CNS lidocaine toxicity is biphasic Earlier manifestations-are due to CNS excitation e. g. convulsions Subsequent manifestations -are due to CNS depression drowsiness, disorientation, respiratory depression. The cause of biphasic response is Local anaesthetic action first blocks inhibitary CNS pathways-resulting in stimulation Eventually blocks both inhibitory and excitatory pathways- overall CNS depression 2. Cardiovascular manifestations These occur at higher serum concentrations There may be cardiac depression, hypotension, coma, respiratory arrest. Note: lignocaine can precipitate malignant hypehermia Management of toxicity If lignocaine toxicity is suspected, stop the injection immediately. Ensure adequate oxygenation, whether by face mask or by intubation. Anticonvulsants such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates are the drug of choice for seizure control. Succinykholine is sometimes also used to terminate the neuromuscular effects of seizures. If CVS symptoms occur (cardiac depression and hypotension), IVfluid and vasopressor agents may be required.

        "exp": ". Ans. is 'c' i. e., Intraorbital Optic nerve Each optic nerve (second cranial nerve) stas from the optic disc and extends up to optic chiasma, where the two nerves meet. It is the backward continuation of the nerve fibre layer of the retina, which consists of the second order neurons i. e., axon originating from the ganglion cells. It also contains the afferent fibres of the papillary light reflex. Morphologically and embryologically, the optic nerve is comparable to a sensory tract. Unlike peripheral nerves it is not covered by neurilemma (so it does not regenerate when cut). The fibres of optic nerve, numbering about a million, are very fine (2-10 m in diameter as compared to 20 mm of sensory nerves). Optic nerve is about 47-50 mm in length and can be divided into 4 pas:? Intraocular pa (1 mm): - It begins at optic disc (optic nerve head) and exits the nerve through a hole in sclera that is occupied by a mesh like structure called the lamina cribrosa. The nerve fibres from the retina leave the eye through pores (holes) in lamina cribrosa, a sieve-like structure made up of collagen meshwork. Intraorbital pa (30 mm): - Extends from back of the eyeball (at lamina cribrosa) to the optic foramina. Intracanalicular pa (6-9 mm): - It lies within the optic canal and closely related to ophthalmic aery which crosses obliquely over it. Intracranial pa (10 mm): - It lies above the cavernous sinus and converges with its fellow from contralateral side to form optic chiasma. Like other pas of CNS, the optic nerve is covered by meningeal sheaths (Pia, archnoid and dura mater) as soon as the nerve leaves the eyeball.",

CARDIAC EFFECTS OF ANESTHETIC AGENTS: Anticholinergic agents - Atropine/glycopyrrolate: will cause an increase in heart rate, contractility, cardiac output and myocardial oxygen consumption. Often there will be no changein blood pressure and a decrease in right atrial pressure. Thiopental - Barbiturate. Reduction in blood pressure - peripheral vasodilation is the main action. Compensatory rise in heart rate - barorecptor response. Commonly associated with ventricular arrhythmias. Benzodiazepines. Midazolam and diazepam: Cause little or no direct myocardial depressant effects. Hypnotics- Etomidate: no direct myocardial depression. Safe to use with cardiac, critical and septic patients.. Mu opioids- Fentanyl is a pure mu agonist causes dose dependant bradycardia (increase in vagal tone). Mixed agonist/antagonist agents= Buprenorphine: a paial mu agonist/antagonist. Slow onset of action, duration of 6-8 hours. Cardiovascular depression and respiratory depression not as profound as pure mu agonists. Butorphanol: paial agonist/antagonist. Similar to buprenorphine in cardiovascular/respiratory effects. Dissociative Agents: Ketamine- Heart rate and aerial pressure increase due to an increase in sympathetic tone. Inhalational Anesthetics: Isoflurane and sevoflurane preserved cardiac index, and isoflurane and fentanyl-midazolam preserved myocardial contractility at baseline levels in this group of patients with congenital heart disease. Halothane depressed cardiac index and myocardial contractility.",

They are usually due to blunt trauma caused by a large object such as a cricket ball, human fist etc. o Most commonly the orbital floor blows, but it can also affect the medial wall of the orbit. The most common site for a blowout fracture to occur is the posteromedial aspect of the orbital floor, medial to the infraorbital neurovascular bundle where the maxillary bone is very thin. Lamina papyracea is also thin and the medial orbital wall is also prone to fracture. Although the lamina papyracea is thinner than the maxilla, the existence of ethmoid air cells reinforce the medial wall like corrugated paper or a beehive. The orbital floor overlies the maxillary sinus without reinforcement, therefore is weaker and more blowouts tend to occur here especially in the posteromedial floor (near the infraorbital groove), where it is the weakest area. Fracture of the floor causes the orbital contents to collapse into the maxillary sinus, causing enophthalmos and entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle. Blowout fractures are divided into pure and impure. The term pure orbital blowout fracture is used to describe a fracture of the orbital floor, the medial orbital floor or both, with an intact bony orbital margin. The term impure orbital blowout fracture is used when such fractures occur in combination with a fracture of the orbital rim.",

Celiac plexus The celiac plexus is situated retroperitoneally in the upper abdomen. It is at the level of T12 and L1 veebrae, anterior to the crura of the diaphragm. It is the main junction for autonomic nerves supplying the upper abdominal organs (Liver, gallbladder, spleen, stomach, pancreas, kidneys, small bowel and 2/3 of the large bowel). The ganglia lie on each side of LI (aoa lying posteriorly, pancreas anteriorly and inferior venacava laterally). The plexus is composed of network of neve fibres from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Sympathetic supply:? It contains two large ganglia that receive sympathetic fibres from three splanchnic nerves - Greater splanchnic nerves (TIT, to TIT() - Lesser splanchnic nerves (Tio/T,, ) - Least splanchnic nerves (Tii/T, 2) Parasympathetic supply - From the left and right vagal trunks which pass through the celiax plexus but do not connect there. Technique The block is performed using X-ray screening, intravenous sedation, local anaesthetic infiltration of the superficial layers with the patient in the prone position. Indications of celiac plexus block For releief of pain from nonpelvic intraabdominal organs. Acute pain - may be performed during surgery for postoperative pain relief. Chronic pain - useful for any condition that causes chronic severe upper abdominal visceral pain e. g. chronic pancreatitis (local anaesthetic blocks only). Cancer pain - useful for upper abdominal organ cancer pain and is frequently used for carcinoma of the pancreas Complications of coeliac plexus block:- Ohostatic hypotension:? This is the most common complication of coeliac plexus block. It is more common when retrocrural pr splanchnic technique was used. Treatment includes resting in bed, avoiding changes in position and replacing fluids. Once compensatory vascular reflexes are fully activated this side effect disappears.

        "exp": "Rocuronium is a monoquaternary steroid analogue of vecuronium was designed to provide a rapid onset of action. Rocuronium is the fastest acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxant. Rocuronium (at a dose of 0. 9-1. 2 mg/kg) has an onset of action that approaches succinylcholine (60-90 s), making it a suitable alternative for rapid-sequence induction. Rocuronium is less potent than most other steroidal muscle relaxants (potency appears to be inversely related to speed of onset). Because rocuronium does not have active metabolites, it may be a better choice than vecuronium for prolonged infusions. Its duration of action is not significantly affected by renal disease, but it is modestly prolonged by severe hepatic failure and pregnancy. Ref: Morgan, Jr. G. E., Mikhail M. S., Murray M. J.

PAP in respiratory distress syndrome It is impoant to note that c. PAP helps mainly by preventing the alveolar collapse in infants with surfactant deficiency. Once atelactasis and collapse have occurred c. PAP might not help much. Therefore all pretenn infants < 35 weeks with any sign of respiratory distress should be staed immediately on c. PAP. Prophylactic c. PAY Extending the above logic some have advocated the use of prophylactic c. PAP before the onset of respiratory distress in preterm VLBW infants as majority of them would eventually develop respiratory distress. However there is no evidence for any additional benefits with this approach, indeed there are concerns regarding increased adverse effect such as intraventricular hemorrhage. \"Hence prophylactic c.

More on c. PAP Continuous positive airway pressure is a modality in which increased pulmonary pressure is provided during the expiratory phase of respiration in spontaneously breathing neonates.

Absolute contraindications - Nitrous oxide is contraindicated in patients with significant respiratory compromise. The blood: gas paition coefficient of nitrous oxide is 34 times greater than that of nitrogen. This differential solubility means that nitrous oxide can leave the bloodstream and enter air-filled cavities 34 times faster than nitrogen. As a result, nitrous is contraindicated in patients in whom expansion of these air-filled cavities could compromise patient safety. This includes patients with pneumothorax, pulmonary blebs, air embolism, bowel obstruction, and those undergoing surgery of the middle ear and tympanoplasties. - Pneumoperitoneum - Pneumoencephalum - Acute intestinal surgeries and volvulus of gut as it may increase gut distension Relative contraindications - Nitrous oxide is known to interfere with vitamin B12 and folate metabolism. In patients with these preexisting conditions, nitrous oxide should only be used with full precautionary consideration and close monitoring. Paicular precautions should be taken in pediatric patients with underlying vitamin B12 deficiency (genetic or environmental) and conditions related to vitamin B12 deficiency. Nitrous oxide is relatively contraindicated in pregnancy. It is known to have potential teratogenic and fetal toxic effects, paicularly with chronic use. In vitro it depresses myocardium but in vivo this effect is not seen because of stimulation of sympathetic system, so it can be used safely for cardiac patients and for patients in shock.",

In these cases emergency airway management is essential. The patient require immediate oxygen. - These patients needs to be intubated immediately. - But an impoant point to note is that severe maxillofacial trauma makes intubation very difficult. -Some believe that nasotracheal intubation is contraindicated in patients with severe maxillofacial injury because nasotracheal intubation in these patients can result in nasocranial intubation or severe nasal hemorrhage. - Nasotracheal intubation is absolutely contraindicated in patients with midfacial injury and C. S. F. rhinorrhoea. Orotracheal intubation in patients with severe maxillofacial injury In patients with severe maxillofacial injuries orotracheal intubation is also difficult. Presence of blood clots,. fractures make the passage of the tube quite difficult. Moreover when the surgeons perform operation for mandibular or maxillary fractures they wires both these together. If surgery is required with severe maxillofacial injury surgeons usually prefer nasotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. Tracheostomy in patient with severe maxillofacial injury:? Tracheostomy does not have much role in \"emergency airways management\". - Tracheostomy is a time taking procedure compared to intubation. - If the airways of the patient is severely compromised and he requires immediate oxygenation, tracheostomy has no role. - Immediate oxygenation can only be delivered by rapid intubation. In case, intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative. -In emergency management of the airway, cricothyroidotomy is done if intubation is not possible. Tracheostomy is only done when immediate oxygen requirements are taken care of and a surgical procedure is planned. In the question the Sp02 of the patient is 80% when on oxygen. He requires immediate emergency management of the airway which can be achieved through intubation, If intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative.

Anesthesia for Endoscopic Surgeries of Airway Endoscopy includes laryngoscopy, microlaryngoscopy (i. e. aided by an operating microscope), bronchoscopy & oesophagoscopy. These procedures may be accompanied by laser surgery. Microlaryngoscopic surgeries include biopsy / surgery of laryngeal malignancy, vocal cord polyps etc. It is associated with some specific problems as - common field for anesthetist & surgeon, already reduced glottic opening d/t growth, laryngospasm (mediated by superior laryngeal nerve) d/t laryngeal stimulation, very high chances of aspiration and myocardial ischemia (- 4% due to sympethetic stimulation). Preoperative Considerations - Sedative premedication is contraindicated in any patient with any significant degree of upper airway obstructionQ, d/t fear of aspiration. Glycopyrrolate, 1 hour before surgery minimize secretions, thereby facilitate ventilation. Pethidine & promethazine are only given if there is no airway obstruction. Laser Precautions General laser precautions include wearing protective spectacles to prevent retinal damage and evacuation of toxic fumes (laser plume) from tissue vaporization which may have potential to transmit microbacterial diseases. Greatest fear during laser airway surgery is a tracheal tube fire. This can be avoided by using a technique of ventilation that does not involve a flammable tube or catheter (eg intermittent apnea or jet ventilation through the laryngoscope side po). The potential fuel source should have laser resistant propeies (laser tubes or wrapping a tracheal tube with metallic tape) or be removed (supraglottic jet ventilation technique). The only non inflammable, laser proof tube is the all metal. Noon tube, which has no cuff. Most laser tubes have laser resistant propeies around the shaft, but the cuff is not protected and can ignite. So there are double cuffs to seal the airway- if upper cuff is struck by laser and saline escapes, the lower cuff will continue to seal the airway. No cuffed tracheal tube, or any currently available tube protection is completely laser proof. Therefore, whenever laser airway surgery is being performed with a tracheal tube in place, the following precaution should be observed. - Inspired 02 conc. should be as low as possible may be upto 21% - N20 suppo combustion & should be replaced with air (N2) or heliumQ - Tracheal tube cuffs should be filled with saline dyed with methylene blue to dessipate heat & signal cuff rupture - A cuffed tube will minimize 02 conc. in the parynx. The addition of 2% lidocaine jelly (1: 2 mixture with saline) can seal small laser induced cuff leaks, potentially preventing combustion - Laser intensity & duration should be limited as much as possible. - Saline soaked pledgets (completely saturated) should be placed in the airway to limit risk of ignition. - A source of water (60 ml) should be immediately available in case of fire. Muscle Relaxation Profound muscle relaxation is the aim to provide masseter muscle relaxation for introduction of suspension laryngoscope & an immobile surgical field. - Anesthesia is induced with IV induction agent followed by a non depolarizing muscle relaxant; the vocal cords are sprayed with 3 ml lidocaine 4% to assist smooth anesthesia & to minimize the possibility of postextubation laryngospasmQ - Alternatively the cords may be painted with 3% cocaine at the end of procedure, which has the added advantage of reducing bleeding from operative site. Oxygentation & Ventilation - Microlaryngoscopy tubes are long, have a small internal and external diameter, and are designed specifically for endoscopic procedures (but not suitable for laser surgery). Typically 4 to 5 mm internal diameter tubes with high volume, low pressure cuffs are used in nasal or oral versions. The most popular anesthetic technique use a Coplan's microlaryngoscopy tube (5mm ID, 31cm long, 10m1 cuff volume and constructed from soft plastic). It is designed for micro laryngeal surgery or for patient whose airway has been narrowed to such an extent that a normal sized tracheal tube cannot be inseed. The small tube diameter provides better visibility and access to surgical field but may lit incomplete exhalation and occlusion. - Most commonly the patients are intubated with small diameter (4 - 6 mm) tracheal tubesQ; - Standandard tracheal tubes of this size, however, are designed for pediatric patients. They tend to be too sho for adult trachea (in length)Q with a low volume cuff that will exe high pressure against it - A 4 - 6 mm microlaryngea tracheal (MLT) tubes (Mallinckrodt critical Care) is the same length as the adult tube, has dispropoionately large high volume low pressure cuff, and is stiffer and less prone to compression than a regular tracheal tube. - The advantages of intubation include - protection against aspiration, and the ability to administer inhalational anesthetics and enable monitoring of ventilation by capnography and spirometry, by measuring end tidal CO2Q - In some cases (eg those involving posterior commissure), intubation may interfere with surgeon's visualization and then alternatives are: 1. Insufflation of high flows of oxygen through small catheter placed in the trachea 2. Intermittent apnea technique. Jet ventilation through laryngoscope High frequency positive pressure ventilation (HFPPV)",

Propofol is highly protein bound, and its pharmacokinetics may be affected by conditions that alter serum protein levels.

It causes mild reduction in peripheral vascular resistance which may cause a slight decline in aerial blood pressure. Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate does not release histamine. Cardiovascular effect of Propofol: The major cardiovascular effect of propofol is a decrease in aerial blood pressure due to a drop in systemic vascular resistance (inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, cardiac contractility and preload). Propofol markedly impairs the normal aerial baroreflex response to hypotension. Sometimes there may be a marked drop in preload. Cardiovascular effect of barbiturates (Thiopental) The cardiovascular effect of barbiturates vary markedly depending on the volume status, basline autonomic tone and preexisting cardiovascular disease. Normally, intravenously administered barbiturates cause a fall in blood pressure. Cardiac output is maintained due to increase in heart rate and increased myocardial contractility from compensatory baroreceptor reflexes. However, in the absence of adequate baroreceptor response (e. g., hypovolemia. congestive hea, failure, 13 adrenergic blockade) cardiac output and aerial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated pooling and unmasked direct myocardial depression. Effect of ketamine on cardiovascular system Ketamine causes central stimulation of sympathetic system which causes increased aerial blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. There is also increase in pulmonary aery pressure and myocardial work. Because of these effects, ketamine should be avoided in patients with coronary aery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure and aerial aneurysms.",

In patients or addicts who are tolerant to the depressant effects of meperidine, large doses repeated at sho interval may produce an excitatory syndrome including hallncination, tremors, muscle twitches, dilated pupils, hyperactive reflexes and convulsions. These excitatory symptoms are d/t accumulation of normeperidine, which has a half life of 15-20 hours, compared to 3 hours for meperidine. In patients with cirrhosis, the bioavailability of meperidine is --80% increased and t1/2 of both meperidine and normeperidine are prolonged. Since normeperidine is eleminated by kidney and liver, decreased renal or hepatic function predispose to neurotoxic effects of nor-meperidineQ. Meperidine is also not recommended for the treatment of chronic pain b/o concerns of metabolite toxicity. It should not be used for longer than 48 hours or in doses > 600 mg/day. Major pathway for morphine metabolism is conjugation with glucuronic acid forming morphine -6- glucuronide and morphine -3- glucuronide. Morphine-6-glucuronide is twice as potent as morphine with somewhat longer t1/2. (t1/2 of morphine is 2 hours) and pharmacological actions indistinguishable from those of morphine. With chronic morphine administration, the 6-glucuronide accounts for most of analgesia and its blood levels exceed those of morphine. Morphine-6-glucuronide is excreted by kidney, so its levels increase in renal failure, perhaps explaining morphine's potency and long action in compromised renal function. So in patients with renal failure decreased protein binding of morphine (resulting in higher plasma free drug level) and accumulation of morphine -6- glucuronide predispose them to respiratory depression. So morphine is given cautiously in low doses in renal failure. Respiratory depression is also repoed in patients with CRF receiving sufentanyl. Except for slightly decreased protein binding, the free drug volume of distribution and clearance of alfentanil appears to be unaffected by renal failure. Fentanyl, has sho half life and its metabolites are inactive. Therefore, it is a good choice in patients with renal diseaseQ. In renal disease (renal failure) remifentanil > fentanyl > alfentanil > sufentanil are safe. Whereas morphine (d/t morphine 6 glucoronide) 1/t respiratory depression is used very cautiously in low dose and meperidine (pethidine) is contraindicated d/t very long acting metabolite nor-meperidine causing neurotoxic excitatory syndrome.",

Moreover, because of their differential blood: gas paition coefficients, nitrous oxide will enter the cavity faster than nitrogen escapes, thereby increasing the volume and/or pressure in the cavity. Examples of air collections that can be expanded by nitrous oxide are: - Pneumothorax - Air embolus - Obstructed middle ear - Obstructed loop of bowel - lntracranial air - A pulmonary (bleep) Nitrous oxide should be avoided in these clinical settings: Now lets move on to the options Nitrous oxide in vitreoretinal surgery The use of nitrous oxide anaesthesia in patients with an intraocular gas bubble is potentially sight threatening. Patients who have vitreoretinal surgery often have a gas bubble deliberately left within the eyes as it helps keep the retina attached while adhesions develop. Filtered room air, Sulfur hexqfluoride and perfluoropropane are the most commonly used gases. By varying the concentration volume and type of gas used, bubbles can be produced that will last upto 70 days before being completely absorbed. If nitrous oxide is administered during this time the bubble will rapidly expand with the risk of retinal and optic nerve ischemia. Nitrous oxide and middle ear surgeries Middle ear cavity is connected to eustachian tube. When nitrous oxide is inhaled in large quantities N20 replaces the N2 in the middle air cavity thereby increasing the pressure in the cavity. After discontinuation of N20 the gas is rapidly reabsorbed from the cavity thus creating negative pressure in the cavity this may cause:? - Serous otitis media - Disaiculation of stapes - Impaired hearing N20 anaesthesia is hazadrous to hearing iu patients who have previously undergone reconstructive middle ear surgery. Microlaryngeal surgery CO2and (Nd: YAG) lasers are frequently used for microsurgery on the upper airway and trachea. Lasers can ignite materials used in anaesthesia.

Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants acts by blocking the postsynaptic receptors in a competitive manner so that acetylcholine cannot occupy the receptors to activate depolarization. Neostigmine acts by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase in the cleft of neuromuscular junctions which inturn leads to building up of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft thereby reversing the effects of non depolarizing muscle relaxants that are competitive agonists.

Use of the oxygen flush valve during the inspiratory cycle of a ventilator must be avoided because the ventilator spill valve will be closed and the APL valve is excluded; the surge of oxygen (600-1200 mL/s) and circuit pressure will be transferred to the patient's lungs.

        "question": "Mechanism of action of curare is?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Reducing end plate potential Curare (D-tubocurarine) is a competitive neuromuscular blocker. All neuromuscular blockers bind to Nm receptors on end-plate and prevents generation of end-plate potential. Mechanism of action of muscle relaxants To know the mechanism of action of different skeletal muscle relaxants one should know the normal sequences of events in contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle? A. Contraction There is discharge of motor neuron. Release of Ach at neuromuscular junction. Binding of Ach to nicotinic (NM) cholinergic receptors at end plate. Binding of Ach to nicotinic receptors causes opening of Na.* channels (NM receptor has intrinsic ion channel). Opening of Na+channel generate end plate potential on skeletal muscle membrane. If end plate potential is above a threshold level, action potential is generated on skeletal muscle membrane- depolarization. Depolarization of skeletal muscle membrane causes intracellular release of Ca\" from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca\" binds to troponin 'c', uncovering myosin binding site of actin. Cross linking between actin and myosin, and sliding of thin filaments on thick filaments - contraction. B. Relaxation Ca\" pumped back into sarcoplasmic reticulum. Release of Ca\" from Troponin. Cessation of interaction between actin and myosin - relaxation. Now coming back to the mechanism of different skeletal muscle relaxants. Competitive (nondepolarising) blockers The competitive blockers have affinity for N. receptors but no intrinsic activity. They compete with Ach for N receptor --) called competitive blockers. They prevent binding of Ach to N. receptors- No opening of Na- channels - No depolarization, so these are called non-depolarizing blockers. Competitive blockers reduce the frequency of channel opening but not its duration or the conductance of a channel once it has opened. When the magnitude of end plate potential falls below a critical level, it is unable to trigger propagated muscle action potential muscle fails to contract. Neostigmine (anticholinesterases) antagonises competitive blockers. Depolarizing blockers Depolarizing blockers have affinity as well as submaximal intrinsic activity on A r receptors. They depolarize muscle end plates by opening of Na+ channels and initially produce twitching and fasciculations (not full contraction as these drugs have submaximal activity)-o, they are called depolarizing blocker. These drugs do not dissociate rapidly from the receptor (NM) - Persistant paial depolarization- Na+ channels get inactivated - flaccid paralysis. Neostigmine does not antagonise depolarising blockers. Under ceain conditions depolarizing agents produce dual mechanism of neuromuscular blockade which can be divided into two phases: a. Phase I block Rapid in onset Result from persistant depolarization of muscle end plate. Has classical features of depolarization block. Block is not antogonized by anticholinesterases (neostigmine). b. Phase H block Slow in onset Results from desensitization of receptor to ACh. Resembles block produced by competitive blockers. Block is paially reversed by anticholinesterases (Neostigmine). In man normally only phase I block is seen typical depolarizing block. Phase II block is seen when fluorinated anaesthetics have been given or when SCh is injected in high dose. SCh also produces phase II block in patients with atypical or deficient pseudocholinesterase.",

A) Congenital myogenic ptosis:- It is the most common type of ptosis and is often bilateral. It is associated with maldevelopment or congenital weakness of levator palpebrae sperioris. Congenital myogenic ptosis is characterized by drooping of one or both lids at bih, with a diminished or absent lid crease and lid lag on downgaze due to tethering effect of abnormal muscle. It may occur in following forms Simple congenital ptosis:- Not associated with other anomaly Congenital ptosis with superior rectus weakness Blepharophimosis syndrome Congenital ptosis, blepharophimosis, telecanthus and epicanthus inversus. Congenital synkinetic ptosis (Marcus Gunn jaw- winking Ptosis):- Retraction of ptotic lid with jaw movement like chewing, i. e., with stimulation of ipsilateral pterygoid muscle. B) Acquird ptosis:- Depending upon the cause acquired ptosis may be Neurogenic:- It is due to paralysis of 3rd nerve, Horner's syndrome, ophthalmoplegic migraine, multiple sclerosis. Neurogenic ptosis may also occur due to lesion of sympathetic nerve) supplying muller's muscle. Myogenic:- It is due to acquired defect of LPS muscle and may be seen in myasthenia gravis, dystrophia myotonica, ocular myopathy, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, thyrotoxicosis, Lambe - Eaton mysthenia syndrome Mechanical:- It is due to excessive weight on the upper lid e. g in lid tumors, multiple chalazia, lid edema. It may also occur due to scarring (cicatracial ptosis) in atients with ocular pemphigoid and trachoma.

The new England journal of medicine Feb 08 vol 358: 700 - 708 nuber 07) Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is associated with ventilation (intubation) & 02 treatment. Infants who were born at 25 -28 weeks gestation and were breathing spontaneously were treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) sholy (at 5 minutes) after bih. 50% were subsequently intubated. Infants in CPAP group had a better outcome at 28th day than did those in intubated group (i. e. required significantly lower rate of 02 treatment and underwent fewer days of ventilation) even though the rate of pneumothorae was higher in CPAP group. A CPAP of 8 - 12 cm of water was used to maintain functional residual capacity and for improving lung compliance and oxygenation. The study suggests that staing respiratory suppo with CPAP does not adversely affect, infants even if upto 50% of them subsequently undergo ventilation (intubation), some because of pneumothorax. Ammar et al also showed that 76% of infants < 1. 251 kg and 50% of those weighing < 0. 751 kg did not need to undergo ventilation (intubation). Previous research suggest that CPAP (nasal) application in preterm infants is associated with benefits in terms of reduced respiratory failure and reduced duration and invasiveness of respiratory suppo; without worsening of other standard measures of neonatal outcome (bronchopulmonary dysplasia & death). Among spontaneously breathing very premature infants, surfactant therapy administered within 10 hour of life along with nasal CPAP decreases the oxygen requirement, need for mechanical ventilation and may prevent chronic lung disease.",

Mitral stenosis is a disorder where cardiac output remains relatively fixed. Decrease in cardiac output should he avoided at any cost. - Any drug that increases the heart rate will reduce the cardiac output in patient with M. S. All the inhalational agents mentioned in the question decrease systemic vascular resistance and also increase the heart rate. Decrease in systemic vascular resistance leads to fall in blood pressure. Moreover, they may also decrease B. P. by their cardiodepressant action on myocardium. Therefore these drugs should not be used in patients with M. S. \"Xenon has no effects on cardiac output or cardiac rhythum and is not thought to have significant effect on systemic vascular resistance It also does not affect pulmonary function and is not known to have any renal or hepatic toxicity\". The main drawback of Xenon is its high cost and insufficient availability. -Xenon is an ine gas which is quite difficult to obtain and hence extremely expensive. - Xenon has received considerable interest in the last few years because it has many characteristics approaching those of an \"ideal\" inhaled anaesthetics. Mitral stenosis Due to mitral stenosis less blood. flows through the mitral valve to left ventricle. Left ventricle functions normally but is small and poorly. filled. Initially the left ventricle dilates keeping the pulmonary aery pressure low. As disease progresses pulmonary aery pressure increases and medial hyperophy develops resulting in chronic reactive pulmonary hypertension. The right hea hyperophies to pump against a pressure overload, then. fails. The pressure gradient across the narrow mitral orifice increase with the square of cardial output. Rapid heart rates, especially with atrial fibrillation decreases diastolic. filling time and markedly decreases cardiac output. Li /. filling is optimized by slow heart rate. Hemodynamic goals Low normal heart rate 50-70/min, treat tachycardia aggressively with /8 blockers. Maintain sinus rhythmus if possible.

Procedure of rapid sequence has following steps: - Li The patient is preoxygenatedfor full 3 minutes. Intravenous induction agent (thiopentone or propofol) is given. Sellick's maneuver (cricoid/pressure) is done to prevent aspiration.
