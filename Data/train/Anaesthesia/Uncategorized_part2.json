In these cases emergency airway management is essential. The patient require immediate oxygen. - These patients needs to be intubated immediately. - But an impoant point to note is that severe maxillofacial trauma makes intubation very difficult. -Some believe that nasotracheal intubation is contraindicated in patients with severe maxillofacial injury because nasotracheal intubation in these patients can result in nasocranial intubation or severe nasal hemorrhage. - Nasotracheal intubation is absolutely contraindicated in patients with midfacial injury and C. S. F. rhinorrhoea. Orotracheal intubation in patients with severe maxillofacial injury In patients with severe maxillofacial injuries orotracheal intubation is also difficult. Presence of blood clots,. fractures make the passage of the tube quite difficult. Moreover when the surgeons perform operation for mandibular or maxillary fractures they wires both these together. If surgery is required with severe maxillofacial injury surgeons usually prefer nasotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. Tracheostomy in patient with severe maxillofacial injury:? Tracheostomy does not have much role in \"emergency airways management\". - Tracheostomy is a time taking procedure compared to intubation. - If the airways of the patient is severely compromised and he requires immediate oxygenation, tracheostomy has no role. - Immediate oxygenation can only be delivered by rapid intubation. In case, intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative. -In emergency management of the airway, cricothyroidotomy is done if intubation is not possible. Tracheostomy is only done when immediate oxygen requirements are taken care of and a surgical procedure is planned. In the question the Sp02 of the patient is 80% when on oxygen. He requires immediate emergency management of the airway which can be achieved through intubation, If intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative. The better option of intubation in this patient is orotracheal intubation. The ideal management in this patient is cricothyroidotomy. Since that is not mentioned in the question intubation in the next best option. \"Orotracheal intubation would be preferred over nasotracheal intubation in these cases\"",

        "exp": "The only depolarizing type of neuromuscular blocker in clinical use is succinylcholine (SCh). Succinylcholine mimics acetylcholine in action and it causes muscle relaxation by causing persistent depolarization of motor end plate. This is also known as phase I blockade. Repeated doses or continuous infusion may cause phase II block. Clinically relevant phase II block can occur with total succinylcholine doses as low as 4 mg/kg in some patients, with either repeat dosing or continuous infusions. Such block may be evident with tetanic stimulation in highly sensitive muscle groups, later respiratory muscles are involved. Patients having abnormal pseudocholinesterase experiences prolonged paralysis after administration of succinylcholine. Ref: Anaesthesia By M. Roy & E. Saha, 2008, Page 28; Surgery: Basic Science and Clinical Evidence By Jeffrey A. Noon, 2008, Page 369.",

In fact, their new proposal strongly reflects current European practice, which is to use a No. 4 for normal adults and a No. 5 for large adults and to use the No. 3 rarely. We consider, however, that further conclusive trials are required before the manufacturer's weight-based recommendations are altered. Judging the correct size of LMA can be difficult since the relationship between gender, weight, height, and upper airway geometry appears inconsistent. No factors have yet been identified that give an easy measurement of potential pharyngeal volume directly correlating with appropriate LMA size, and certainly, there is no known anatomical difference between the male and the female adult or child pharynx at a given weight. Some practitioners consider that the smaller sizes are satisfactory for spontaneous ventilation since a less effective seal is required. However, too small a mask may still result in local soft tissue damage due to poor fit around the laryngeal inlet or misplacement into the upper oesophagus or the glottic inlet. The problems associated with insertion of too large a mask (airway obstruction, airway reflex activation) are probably fewer than those associated with insertion of too small a mask.",

In Mapleson A or Magill circuit, free gas flow (FGF) enters the circuit near the reservoir bag and the APL valve is placed close to the patients face. This system is very efficient during spontaneous ventilation (SV), because the FGF needs to be only 0. 7 to 1. 0 times the patient's minute ventilation to avoid rebreathing. Use of this circuit is less efficient in case of rapid respiratory rate as in small children, and in controlled ventilation (CV). It should not be used in children less than 20kg because of the impoant apparatus dead space.

No consensus exists on the optimal perioperative management of patients receiving warfarin. The usual recommendation is to withhold warfarin staing 4 to 5 days preoperatively (if the INR is between 2. 0 and 3. 0) to allow the INR to decrease to less than 1. 5, which is a level considered safe for surgical procedures and neuraxial blockade. If the INR is greater than 3. 0, it is usually necessary to withhold warfarin longer than 4 to 5 days. If the INR is measured the day before the surgical procedure and remains higher than 1. 8, a small dose of vitamin K (1 to 5 mg administrated orally or subcutaneously) can reverse anticoagulation. Vitamin K has an effect within 6 to 10 hours after oral or subcutaneous administration (more predictable with oral administration), and it peaks within 24 hours to 48 hours.

Clinical features: contracture, rigidity, and heat production from skeletal muscle resulting in severe hypehermia, accelerated muscle metabolism, metabolic acidosis, and tachycardia. Mechanism: Uncontrolled release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle is the initiating event. Although the halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics (e. g., halothane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) and succinylcholine alone repoedly precipitate the response, most incidents arise from the combination of depolarizing blocking agent and anesthetic. Susceptibility to malignant hypehermia, an autosomal dominant trait Treatment: Intravenous administration of dantrolene (DANTRIUM), which blocks Ca2+release and its sequelae in skeletal muscle. Rapid cooling, inhalation of 100% oxygen, and control of acidosis should be considered adjunct therapy in malignant hypehermia",

        "exp": "Ans. is `B' i. e., Supraclavicular Brachial plexus block This is the second most commonly practised block after central neuraxial block (spinal & epidural anaesthesia). Brachial plexus block is used for upper limb surgeries. Brachial plexus can be blocked by 4 approaches: - 1. Interscalene approach Brachial plexus is blocked between anterior and middle scalene. This approach is not used routinely due to close proximity of vital structures. Ulnar nerve is usually spared by this approach because injection is given in close proximity of upper nerve roots and inferior nerve roots (C8-T 1) may be spared. This technique provides excellent anaesthesia and analgesia for shoulder and upper arm procedures. (in contrast to other three approaches which do not provide adequate shoulder anaesthesia). Complications include Horner syndrome (due to stellate ganglion block), phrenic nerve block, intravascular injection into carotids and epidural or intrathecal injections. 2. Supraclavicular approach This is the most commonly used approach. It involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity to the trunks of the brachial plexus by inseing the needle lateral to subclan vessels. The supraclavicular block is performed where the brachial plexus is most compact, consequently, it produces reliable and rapid onset anaesthesia and is paicularly useful in a fast paced ambulatory surgery centre. Pneumothorax is the most common complication. Other complications include phrenic nerve block, intravascular injection in subclan aery or vein, Horner syndrome, hematoma formation. 3. Infra-clavicular approach Infraclavicular block involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity of cords of the brachial plexus. The axillary nerve may be spared as this nerve exits the brachial plexus sheath proximal to the level of infraclavicular block. 4. Axillary approach Axillary block involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity of terminal branches of the brachial plexus. The major disadvantage of this approach is that mucocutaneous and intercostobrachial nerves are spared. So arm surgery cannot be performed. In contrast to interscalene approach, most intense block occur in (C7-T1) ulnar dermatomes and least in C5-C6 dermatomes.",

In spinal anesthesia autonomic preganglionic sympathetic fibresQ are the earliest blocked fibres. Block of sympathetic nerves causes vasodialation of venous capacitance vessels, pooling of blood and HypotensionQ (most common complication of spinal anesthesiaQ). It is prevented by preloading with crystalloid. Following spinal subarachnoid block most common complication is hypotensionQ. During sub-arachnoid block, there is sympathetic blockade producing decreased venous return & hence, cardiac output and BP falls. So the patient can be managed by all the four means but the least effective & most controversial mean is lowering head end. The specific gravity (baricity) of CSF is 1. 003 - 1. 008Q at 37degC. A hyper baric solution of LA is denser than CSF & hypobaric solution of LA is Lighter than CSF. A LA solution can be made hyperbaric by adding glucose & hypobaric by addition of sterile water. Most impoant factors affecting level of spinal anesthesia are: BaricityQ, Position of patient - during & immediately after injection, Q drug dose & site of injection. Thus with a head down position a hyperbaric solution spreads cephald & hypobaric solution moves caudad and vice versa. And in this Q baricity of LA & time passed after injecting spinal anesthesia is not mentioned, so lowering the head end is weakest option.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., 10 days Post dural puncture headache is due to CSF leak. Typical location is bifrontal or occipital. Headache gets worsen on sitting or upright posture and is relieved by lying down position and abdominal pressure --> The hallmark of postdural puncture headache i. e., association with body position. The onset of headache is usually 12-72 hours following the procedure, however, it may be seen almost immediately. In most cases it lasts for 7-10 days. PDPH is believed to result from leakage of CSF from a dural defect and decreased ICT. Loss of CSF at a rate faster that it can be produced causes traction on structure suppoing the brain, paicularly dura and tentorium. Traction on cranial nerve (paicularly 6th nerve) produces diplopia. Factors that increase the incidence of PDPH are young age, female sex, Pregnancy, large bore needle and multiple punctures. Use of small bore needle can prevent PDPH. Intially conservative treatment is given which includes analgesics (NSAIDs), oral or i. v., fluids, Sumatriptan, cosyntropin, caffeine and recumbent position. If conservative treatment fails, epidural blood patch can be used. It involves injecting 15-20 ml of autologus blood into the epidural space which stop leakage of CSF by coagulation and mass effect",

Normal value is 35-45 mm Hg (4% to 6%). Capnography works on the principle that infrared light is absorbed by carbon dioxide. A beam of infrared light is passed across the gas sample to fall on to a sensor. The presence of CO2 in the gas leads to a reduction in the amount of light falling on the sensor which changes the voltage in the circuit. Uses of Capnography It is the surest confirmatory sign of correct intubation in trachea. Incorrect position of tube in esophagus instead of trachea (esophageal intubation) will yield ETCO2 = 0.

Thereafter, the drug distributes to the rest of the body and in about 15-20 minutes the concentration is low enough in the brain such that consciousness returns Thiopental is not used to maintain anaesthesia in surgical procedures because, in infusion, it displays zero-order elimination kinetics, leading to a long period before consciousness is regained.

LAs first penetrate the axonol membrane to come inside and then their active species (cationic form) bind to Net' channel from inside. Cationic form (active form) is able to approach its receptor only when the channel is open at the inner face - So resting nerve is resistant to block as Na' channels are not activated and cationic form is not able to approach its receptor. So blockade develops rapidly when the nerve is stimulated repeatedly. Degree of blockade is frequency dependent greater blockade at higher frequency of stimulation. Exposure to higher concentration of Ca' reduces inactivation of Na' channels and lessens the block. Order of blockade of fibres B > C > AS> Ace, (3 & y (Autonomic > Sensory > Motor). Order of recovery is in reverse order. Among sensory afferent order of block is: Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure. When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sweet and sour, and salty taste last of all. Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated. Smaller fibres are more sensitive than larger fibres.",

It is at the level of T12 and L, veebrae anterior to the crura of the diaphragm. It contains visceral afferent and efferent fibers divided from T5 to T1, by means of greater, lesser and least splanchnic nerves. Celiac plexus innervates most of the abdominal viscera, therefore this procedure blocks the nerves which come from the pancreas, liver, gall bladder, stomach, intestine, spleen, kidney and adrenal glands. A celiac plexus block can be combined with an intercostal block to provide anesthesia for intra-abdominal surgery. Because celiac plexus block results in blockade of the autonomic nervous system, this block may help to reduce stress and endocrine responses to surgery. For the same reason, the most common complication of celiac plexus block is postural hypotenstion because of blockade of lumbar sympathetic chain leading to upper abdominal vessel dilation and venous pooling. Celiac plexus block can be done by following three approaches: - Retrocrural (classic) approach, anterocrural approach and splanchnic nerve block. Celiac plexus block is given to treat intractable pain in chronic pancreatitis, gastric & pancreatic malignancies. It can be combined with an intercostal block to provide anesthesia for intra-abdomival surgery.

The syndrome can vary greatly in presentation and nerve involvement. Brachial neuritis (BN) exists in an inherited and an idiopathic form. In the idiopathic version, the pathophysiology is unknown, but the condition is generally thought to be an immune system - mediated inflammatory reaction against nerve fibers of the brachial plexus. The onset of pain in brachial neuritis (BN) is often abrupt and may follow recent illness, surgery, immunization, or even trauma (see Causes, below). Up to two thirds of cases begin during the nighttime. Sensory abnormalities are of usually of less intensity than the pain and muscle weakness. Causes: The exact cause of brachial neuritis is unknown, but the condition has been linked to many antecedent events or illnesses, as follows: Viral infection (paicularly of the upper respiratory tract) Bacterial infection (eg, pneumonia, diphtheria, typhoid) Parasitic infestation S urgery 2 Trauma (not related to shoulder) Vaccinations (eg, influenza, tetanus, diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, peussis [DPT J. smallpox, swine flu) Childbih Miscellaneous medical investigative procedures (eg, lumbar puncture, administration of radiologic dye) Systemic illness (eg, polyaeritis nodosa, lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal aeritis, Ehlers. Danlos syndrome) A rarer, hereditary form of BN has been localized to the SEPT9 gene on chromosome arm 17q and should be considered a distinct disorder. This entity presents in a younger age group, and is characterized by recurrent, often bilateral attacks. Dysmorphic facial features (eg, hypotelorism, long nasal bridge, facial asymmetry) can also be present. Diagnosis: Other causes of severe pain, such as an acute herniated cervical disc, should be excluded. In brachial plexus neuritis, electromyography and nerve conduction studies reveal abnormalities in more than one nerve; in contrast, cervical radiculopathy may show osteophytes and interspace narrowing on cervical spine x-rays and neuroforaminal disc impingement of MRI. Treatment: of brachial plexus neuritis is suppoive, with analgesics for pain, physical therapy to maintain shoulder strength/mobility, and reassurance that the condition generally will improve, albeit slowly.",

Ketamine is different from most other anaesthetic induction agents in that it has significant analgesic action. Ketamine increases IOT and cerebral metabolism --> contraindicated in head injury. It causes sympathetic stimulation with elevation of HR, CO & BP --) contraindicated in hypertension and ischemic heart disease. It also raises IOT --> contraindicated in glaucoma. It relieves bronchospasm --> intravenous anaesthetic of choice in asthmatics (inhalation anaesthetic of choice in asthmatic is halothane). Injection is not painful (All other inducing agents cause pain on injection). It is i. v. anaesthetic of choice in children (Sevoflurane is inhalation agent of choice). Because it causes sympathetic stimulation it is intravenous anaesthetic of choice in patients with shock and hypovolumia. It has no muscle relaxant propey rather muscle tone is increased. Airway reflexes (pharyngeal and laryngeal) are not depressed --> intravenous anaesthetic of choice for emergency anaesthesia (no starvation is required).

The injection can cause both a loss of sensation (anaesthesia) and a loss of pain (analgesia), by blocking the transmission of signals through nerves in or near the spinal cord The anaesthetist may use epidural analgesia in addition to general anaesthesia. This may reduce the patient's requirement for opioid analgesics. This is suitable for a wide variety of surgery, for example gynaecological surgery (e. g. hysterectomy), ohopaedic surgery (e. g. hip replacement), general surgery (e. g. laparotomy) and vascular surgery (e. g. open aoic aneurysm repair) which are longer duration surgeries. Other features of epidural anaesthesia: Expensive compared to spinal anaesthesia More incidence of intravascular injection (epidural space has venous plexus of Batson) More incidence of epidural hematoma Level of block can be changed by increasing the dose through the catheter",
