However, its onset of action is significantly slower than that of succinylcholine. In addition, the use of a larger dose to speed the onset can be associated with profound histamine release leading to hypotension, flushing, and bronchospasm. Clearance of mivacurium by plasma cholinesterase is rapid and independent of the liver or kidney. However, because patients with renal failure often have decreased levels of plasma cholinesterase, the short duration of action of mivacurium may be prolonged in patients with impaired renal function. Although mivacurium is no longer in widespread clinical use, an investigational ultra-short-acting isoquinoline nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, gantacurium, is currently in phase III clinical testing. This novel compound has a very rapid onset and short duration of action",

Competitive (Non-depolarizing) blocker: -# They compete with Achfor Nm receptors - called competitive blockers. They prevent binding of Ach to Nm receptors - No opening of Na+ channels - No depolarization, so these are called non-depolarizing blockers. Competitive blockers reduce the frequency of channel opening but not its duration or the conductance of a channel once it has opened. When the magnitude of end plate potential falls below a critical level, it is unable to trigger propagated muscle action potential - muscle fails to contract. Neostigmine (anticholinesterases) antagonises competitive blockers as it increases the concentration of Ach by inhibiting its degradation by cholinesterase. Therefore, Neostigmine is used for the reversal of competitive (nondepolarizing) blockers.2. Depolarizing blockers (Succinylcholine, Decamethonium)# Depolarizing blockers have affinity as well as submaximal intrinsic activity on NM receptors. They depolarize muscle end plates by opening of Na+ channels and initially produce twitching and fasciculations (not full contraction as these drugs have submaximal activity) - So, they are called depolarizing blocker. These drugs do not dissociate rapidly from the receptor (NM) - Persistant partial depolarization - Na+ channels get inactivated - flaccid paralysis. Neostigmine does not antagonize depolarising blockers (Therefore neostigmine cannot be used for reversal).Inf act neostigmine can potentiate the block as neostigmine and other anti-cholinesterase also inhibits pseudocholinesterase which metabolizes Sch.Under certain conditions depolarizing agents produce dual mechanism of neuromuscular blockade which can be divided into two phases :a) Phase I block* Rapid in onset* Result from persistant depolarization of muscle end plate - Typical mechanism of action of depolarizing blocker.* Has classical features of depolarization block.* Block is not antagonized by anticholinesterases (neostigmine).b) Phase II block (Dual block)* Slow in onset* Results from desensitization of receptor to ACh - Ach can not act on Nm receptors (similar to competitive blocker).* Resembles block produced by competitive blockers - Therefore, has characteristics similar to non-depolarizing (competitive) block.* Block is partially reversed by anticholinesterases (Neostigmine).# In man, normally, only phase I block is seen - typical depolarizing block.# Phase II block is seen when fluorinated anaesthetics have been given or when SCh is injected in high dose.# SCh also produces phase II block in patients with atypical or deficient pseudocholinesterase.",

        "exp": "Ans. d (Atracurium) (Ref KDT 6th !345; Anaesthesia by Ajay yadav, 2nd ed., p. 90)The unique feature of atracurium is inactivation in plasma by spontaneous nonenzymatic degradation (Hofmann elimination) in addition to that by cholinesterases. Consequently its duration of action is not altered in patients with hepatic/renal insufficiency or hypodynamic circulation. It is the preferred muscle relaxant for such patients as well as for neonates and the elderly. Hypotension may occur due to histamine release.Cisatracurium, R-Cis, R-Cis enantiomer of atracurium is nearly 4 times more potent, slower in onset, but similar in duration of action. Like atracurium it undergoes Hofmann elimination, but in contrast it is not hydrolysed by plasma cholinesterase. Most importantly, it does not provoke histamine release.ATRACURIUM BESYLATE# Long acting and non-depolarising muscle relaxant.# Muscle relaxant of choice in renal failure or anephric patients.# pH of solution is 3.5.; Stored at 4degC.; Duration of action doubled at 25degC.# Metabolism mainly by Hofmann elimination (chemical degradation) and hydrolysis in plasma and elsewhere in body.# Major metabolite is laudanosine, which is CNS stimulant.# Cisatracurium is one of the ten isomers of atracurium and its active metabolites contain less laudanosine which causeless hypotension, central nervous system excitement, and seizures than that of atracurium.# It is considered an intermediate-acting agent in terms of duration of action.Notable features of Few muscle relaxantsPropertyMuscle relaxant (MR)Rapid onset of ActionShortest ActingLongest ActingSch (overall); Rocuronium (non-depolarising)Sch (overall); Mivacurium (non-depolarising)DoxacuriumExcreted in LiverRocuronium; VecuroniumNo placenta crossingd -TCHistamine released-TC (maximum) Atracuronium Mivacuronium SchLeast Histamine releaseVecuroniumMost CardiostableVecuroniumM.R. used to decrease BPd -TCM.R.

Paul's anaesthesia 5th/pg. 427-428; Miller 7th/pg. 867)Paul's anaesthesia 5th/pg. 427-428 ..............'The mean dose of scoline producing 95% blockade (ED95) at the adductor pollicis is 0.30 to 0.35 mg/kg with opioid- nitrous oxide anesthesia. In the absence of nitrous oxide, the ED95 is increased to 0.5 mg/kg\".DEPOLARIZING DRUGS: SUCCINYLCHOLINENeuromuscular Effects# depolarizes presynaptic, postsynaptic, and extrajunctional receptors.# Within 1 minute after succinylcholine injection and before paralysis is manifest, some disorganized muscular activity is observed frequently (\"fasciculations\") and is probably a result of depolarization of the nerve terminal produced by activation of presynaptic receptors.# In some muscles, like the masseter and to a lesser extent the adductor pollicis, a sustained increase in tension that may last for several minutes can be observed (spasm).Characteristics of Depolarizing Blockade# After injection of succinylcholine, single-twitch height is decreased. However, the response to high-frequency stimulation is sustained: minimal train-of-four and tetanic fade is observed. The block is antagonized by nondepolarizing agents so that the ED95 is increased by a factor two if a small dose of nondepolarizing drug is given before.# Succinylcholine blockade is potentiated by inhibitors of acetyl cholinesterase, such as neostigmine and edrophonium.# Phase II Block: After administration of 7 to 10 mg/kg, or 30 to 60 minutes of exposure to succinylcholine, train- of-four and tetanic fade become apparent. Neostigmine or edrophonium can antagonize this block, which has been termed \"nondepolarizing,\" \"dual,\" or \"Phase II block.\" The onset of Phase II block coincides with tachyphylaxis, as more succinylcholine is required for the same effect.Pharmacology of Succinylcholine# Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase (also called pseudocholinesterase), with an elimination half-life of <1 minute in patients. Because of the rapid disappearance of succinylcholine from plasma, the maximum effect is reached quickly.# Plasma cholinesterase activity is reduced by some anticholinesterases (e.g., neostigmine) so that the duration of succinylcholine given after neostigmine, but not after edrophonium, is increased.Side Effects# Sinus bradycardia with nodal or ventricular escape beats.- Anaphylaxis# Fasciculations- Muscle Pains# increases intragastric pressure- Hyperkalemia# increases intraocular Pressure & ICP Clinical Uses# to facilitate tracheal intubation (adult dose of 1.0 mg/kg; Children are slightly more resistant to succinylcholine than adults, and doses of 1 to 2 mg/kg are required to facilitate intubation. In infants, 2 to 3 mg/kg may be required. Precurarization is not necessary in patients younger than 10 years).# \"rapid sequence induction\" ( patient with full stomach and possibility of aspiration).# Succinylcholine, at a dose of 4 mg/kg, is the only effective intramuscular neuromuscular blocking agent in children with difficult intravenous access and provides adequate intubating conditions in about 4 minutes. However, this route of administration should not be the method of choice.Additional Educational points:Sevoflurane:# Fast induction and emergence# Rapid changes in depth can be achieved.# Acceptability is good by pediatric patients (agent of choice for induction in children).# Hepatic blood flow is maintained.# Does not cause sympathetic stimulation and airway irritation even during rapid induction.# Amount of fluoride liberated is safe for kidney and liver.# Degraded by sodalime - hence not recommended for use in closed circuit.",

However, this can be reversed with the administration of antihistaminics.The increased airway resistance is due to the presence of increased levels of histamine and administration of an antihistaminic such as diphenhydramine causes the reversal of the effects of histamine.d-Tubocurarine can block even the sympathetic ganglia.Histamine release along with sympathetic blockade can result in severe hypotension.",

(Hoffman elimination) so its duration of action will not be affected in patients with hepatic insufficiency.All other muscle relaxants given in the question undergo biliary excretion so they should be avoided in a case of biliary atresia.",
