It is also an alternative to supraclavicular block for anaesthetizing the upper arm. The veical infraclavicular is better than the lateral approaches in this respect and has similar rates of pneumothorax but less frequent phrenic nerve paresis. The lateral approach performed with ultrasound control has a minimal risk of phrenic nerve paresis or pneumothorax and so may be a better choice in those with respiratory compromise, but provides less reliable upper arm anaesthesia. Complications are rare and less frequent than supraclavicular approaches and vary depending on the specific infraclavicular technique used. Although the axillary block provides safe and straightforward regional anaesthesia of the arm, the infraclavicular approach does offer an alternative in some specific situations and can be considered a ble routine alternative in experienced hands. It has some advantages in providing upper arm anaesthesia, securing infusion catheters to the chest wall, and ease of patient positioning",

Main mechanism of action of local anesthetics is through inhibition of. Activated, voltage-gated Na channel. Local anesthetics have a greater affinity for the channel in the open or inactivated state than in the resting state. Local anesthetic binding to open or inactivated channels, or both, is facilitated by depolarization. The fraction of Na channels that have bound a local anesthetic increases with frequent depolarization (eg, during trains of impulses). This phenomenon is termed use-dependent block Local anesthetic inhibition is both voltage and frequency dependent, and is greater when nerve fibers are firing rapidly than with infrequent depolarizations Sodium passess through voltage gated sodium channel and cause change in membrane potential and cause depolarization.

The risk factors for developing LAST (Local Anesthetic systemic toxicity)can be categorized into those that are related to the injected drug, the patient, or the technique. Drug The cardiovascular collapse/CNS (CC/CNS) ratio is \"the ratio of drug dose required to cause catastrophic cardiovascular collapse to the drug dose required to produce seizures. \" A low CC/CNS ratio is associated with more cardiotoxic agents, while LAs with a higher CC/CNS ratio have a greater safety margin. This is because the earlier presentation of CNS features may expedite earlier diagnosis (and thus, treatment) of LAST before cardiovascular collapse ensues. Ropivacaine and levobupivacaine, for example, have higher CC/CNS ratios than racemic bupivacaine; therefore, it seems logical to preferentially use these drugs when long-acting LAs are desired. Vigilance is always required, however, as all LA drugs may cause LAST. Patient Age Patients at the extremes of age have consistently been shown to be at the greatest risk of LAST. Pregnancy Renal disease Patients with severe renal disease not only have a hyperdynamic circulation and reduced clearance of LAs, but also have an increased a1-acid glycoprotein concentration.

In 1884, Austrian ophthalmologist Karl Koller (1857-1944) instilled a 2% solution of cocaine into his own eye and tested its effectiveness as a local anesthetic by pricking the eye with needles. His findings were presented a few weeks later at annual conference of the Heidelberg Ophthalmological Society. The following year, William Halsted (1852-1922) performed the first brachial plexus block. Also in 1885, James Leonard Corning (1855-1923) injected cocaine between the spinous processes of the lower lumbar veebrae, first in a dog and then in a healthy man. His experiments are the first published descriptions of the principle of neuraxial blockade. On August 16, 1898, German surgeon August Bier (1861-1949) performed surgery under spinal anesthesia in Kiel. Following the publication of Bier's experiments in 1899, a controversy developed about whether Bier or Corning performed the first successful spinal anesthetic.",
