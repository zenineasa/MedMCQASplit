        "exp": "Sodium channels are membrane bound proteins that are composed of one large and subunit through which Na ions pass, and one or two smaller b subunits. Voltage - gated Na channels exist in three stages - resting, open and inactivated local anesthetics bind a specific region of the & subunit and inhibit voltage - gated Na channels preventing channel activation and Na influx associated with membrane depolarization. Main mechanism of action of local anesthetics is through inhibition of. Activated, voltage-gated Na channel. Local anesthetics have a greater affinity for the channel in the open or inactivated state than in the resting state. Local anesthetic binding to open or inactivated channels, or both, is facilitated by depolarization. The fraction of Na channels that have bound a local anesthetic increases with frequent depolarization (eg, during trains of impulses). This phenomenon is termed use-dependent block Local anesthetic inhibition is both voltage and frequency dependent, and is greater when nerve fibers are firing rapidly than with infrequent depolarizations Sodium passess through voltage gated sodium channel and cause change in membrane potential and cause depolarization. Local anesthetic attaches to sodium channel and prevents propogation & depolarization",

General complications to peripheral nerve blockade apply to supraclavicular blocks including risk for infection, bleeding, and neuropathy. With the advent of ultrasonography, constant visualization of the needle tip, first rib, and pleura can decrease the risk for pneumothorax.

His findings were presented a few weeks later at annual conference of the Heidelberg Ophthalmological Society. The following year, William Halsted (1852-1922) performed the first brachial plexus block. Also in 1885, James Leonard Corning (1855-1923) injected cocaine between the spinous processes of the lower lumbar veebrae, first in a dog and then in a healthy man. His experiments are the first published descriptions of the principle of neuraxial blockade. On August 16, 1898, German surgeon August Bier (1861-1949) performed surgery under spinal anesthesia in Kiel.

A hyperbaric solution of local anesthetic is denser (heavier) than CSF, whereas a hypobaric solution is less dense (lighter) than CSF. Significance: Hyperbaric solutions tend to move to the most dependent area of the spine. With the patient in a head-down position, a hyperbaric solution spreads cephalad, and a hypobaric anesthetic solution moves caudal. A head-up position causes a hyperbaric solution to settle caudally and a hypobaric solution to ascend cephalad. An isobaric solution tends to remain at the level of injection.",

        "exp": "Drug must have entered subarachnoid space and resulted in total spinal anesthesia. The occurrence of a high regional block or total spinal can be potentially catastrophic and require immediate management. They may occur following spinal or epidural anaesthesia and therefore can occur outside of the operating theatre. Both are due to the inappropriately high spread of local anaesthetic affecting spinal nerves and as such are on a continuum of severity:? High spinal/regional block: spread of local anaesthetic affecting the spinal nerves above T4. The effects are of variable severity depending upon the maximum level that is involved, but can include cardiovascular and/or respiratory compromise.? Total spinal: intracranial spread of local anaesthetic resulting in loss of consciousness. A total spinal can also occur following epidural anaesthesia/analgesia. As the above are different severities of the same process, they may both be referred to as high regional block. Left untreated, a high regional block can progress to a total spinal. TOTAL spinal anesthesia is a complication that follows inadveent introduction of local anesthetics into the intracranial subarachnoid space. Clinical features- Hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory depression followed by neurological symptoms. The clinical features are dependent on the level of the spinal nerves affected by the local anaesthetic. Untreated the block may ascend fuher leading to more severe features as shown below: Spinal level Area(s) affected Symptoms/signs T1-T4 Cardiac sympathetic fibres blocked Hypotension Bradycardia C6-C8 Hands and arms Paraesthesia or numbness in hands/arms Weakness of hands/arms Shoness of breath (accessory respiratory muscles affected) C3-5 Diaphragm and shoulders Shoulder weakness - respiratory compromise immenent Hypoventilation and/or desaturation Respiratory arrest Intracranial spread - Brain stem Slurred speech Sedation Loss of consciousness",
