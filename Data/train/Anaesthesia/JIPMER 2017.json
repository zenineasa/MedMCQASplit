A few drugs may diminish the effects of a nondepolarizing NMBD, including calcium, coicosteroids, and anticonvulsant (phenytoin) drugs.",

First, the time required to reach a substantial fraction of the ultimate steady-state concentration is very long in the context of intraoperative use. To reach a near steady state more quickly requires a bolus be administered before the infusion is commenced (or increased). Remifentanil perhaps represents a paial exception to this general rule. Also, opioid concentrations will increase for many hours after an infusion is commenced; in other words, concentrations are typically increasing even though the infusion rate may have been the same for hours! That remifentanil achieves a near steady state relatively quickly is ceainly pa of why it has emerged as a popular drug for total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA).",

In anesthetized patients, the prone position has advantages over the supine position with regard to lung volumes and oxygenation without adverse effects upon respiratory mechanics.
