Risk factors for halothane hepatitis: Multiple exposures to halothane at sho intervals middle-aged obese women - because halothane undergo extensive metabolism in obese patients familial predisposition to halothane Another theory for halothane hepatitis is that it is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction associated with oxidative metabolism of halothane.

Desflurane has two physical propeies, making it unsuitable for use with a conventional vaporizer. First, it has a very high SVP (88. 5 k. Pa at 20degC). A conventional vaporizer would require high fresh gas flows to dilute it to within clinically useful concentrations, making it uneconomical. Secondly, it has a low boiling point (23. 5degC). At room temperature, it will intermittently boil resulting in large fluctuations in agent delivery. When boiling, there will be excessive agent delivery; however, it will then cool due to a large loss of latent heat of vaporization, resulting in an exponential decrease in SVP and under-delivery of agent. The Ohmeda Tec 6 overcomes these problems by using an electrical filament that heats the desflurane to 39degC, raising its SVP to 194 k. Pa, that is, nearly 2 atm. In addition to providing a stable SVP, this high pressure removes the need for a pressurized carrier gas--instead, the fresh or diluent gas is entirely separate from the vaporizing chamber",
