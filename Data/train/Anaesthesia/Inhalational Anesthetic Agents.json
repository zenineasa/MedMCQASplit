A conventional vaporizer would require high fresh gas flows to dilute it to within clinically useful concentrations, making it uneconomical. Secondly, it has a low boiling point (23. 5degC). At room temperature, it will intermittently boil resulting in large fluctuations in agent delivery. When boiling, there will be excessive agent delivery; however, it will then cool due to a large loss of latent heat of vaporization, resulting in an exponential decrease in SVP and under-delivery of agent. The Ohmeda Tec 6 overcomes these problems by using an electrical filament that heats the desflurane to 39degC, raising its SVP to 194 k. Pa, that is, nearly 2 atm. In addition to providing a stable SVP, this high pressure removes the need for a pressurized carrier gas--instead, the fresh or diluent gas is entirely separate from the vaporizing chamber",

The mechanism appears to be incompletely understood, but is likely a combination of: effect on central motor neurons augmentation of the NMB's affinity for the receptor site inhibition of post-synaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors Clinically, the presence of inhaled anesthetics will decrease the ED50, as well as both prolong the duration of action and recovery from neuromuscular blockade. The degree of potentiation depends on the specific agent and concentration used. For example, desflurane > sevoflurane > isoflurane. With deeper planes of anesthesia, the degree of potentiation is enhanced due to a dose-dependent inhibition of current through the nicotinic receptor at the neuromuscular junction. Studies attempting to quantify the magnitude of these effects have led to conflicting results due to the time factor, or duration of anesthesia. The older halogenated agents (halothane, enflurane, isoflurane) may take up to 2 hours to equilibrate with muscle, so in practice the potentiating effects of these vapors might not be immediately apparent. In contrast, newer agents such as sevoflurane and desflurane equilibrate more rapidly with muscle, and the effects may be seen after as little as 30 minutes.
