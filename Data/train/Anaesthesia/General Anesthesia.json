        "question": "Which of the following inhalational anesthetic agent is contraindicated in liver disease?",
        "exp": "Ans. b (Halothane). (Ref. Lee's synopsis of Anesthesia 12th ed. 163). Ether may cause a transient depression of liver function but does not cause significant damage. HALOTHANE# Dose: 0. 5% (MAC 0. 75%)# Actions: analgesic, anaesthetic# Advantages:- Potent and effective, - Allows for high FI02 delivery, - Bronchodilatation, - Low irritant, - Nice smell; can be used for induction# Disadvantages:- CVS depression, - Cerebral Vasodilatation- | ICP, - Respiratory depression, Airway irritation, - \"halothane hepatitis\", - Arrhythmias, - Myocardial depression, - Incidence of malignant hyperpyrexia. ISOFLURANE# An isomer of enflurane.# It is a stable agent, so, no need of preservative.# It does not depress myocardium, so good for cardiac surgery.# Sensitizes heart to catecholamines, but not nephro/hepatotoxic.# Commonly used in neurosurgery.# Can cause coronary-steal syndrome. ENFLURANE# Nonirritating and noninflammable Liquid# Stimulates salivary and respiratory secretions slightly# Heart rate decreases little and reduction of cardiac output is less marked.# Does not sensitize the heart to adrenaline, arrhythmias are rare.# Bronchodilatation is similar to halothane.# It is a better skeletal muscle relaxant.# Contraindicated in epilepsy. METHOXYFLURANE# It has highest amount of fluoride content.# It can be converted into oxalate in the liver and can cause oxalate renal stone formation.# It is nephrotoxic and causes high out put renal failure.# Not used commonly. SEVOFLURANE# Induction and emergence from anaesthetic are fast and rapid changes in depth can be achieved.# Acceptability is good by pediatric patients.# Sevoflurane does not cause sympathetic stimulation and airway irritation even during rapid induction. Amount of fluoride liberated is safe for kidney and liver.# It is degraded by soda lime - not recommended for use in closed circuit.# Sevoflurane has rapid induction (1-2 min) and also emergence from anesthesia is more rapid than Isoflurane, and is comparable with than seen after continuous Propofol anesthesia. This makes it suitable for day -stay surgery. DESFLURANE# Anaesthetic for out patient surgery.# Induction and recovery are very fast.# Postanaesthetic cognitive and motor impairment is short-lived.# Desflurane is less potent than isoflurane; may induce coughing, breath holding and laryngospasm.# Desflurane can serve as a good alternative to isoflurane for routine surgery.",

        "question": "Which of the following determines the speed of recovery from IV anesthetic?",
        "exp": "Ans. c. Redistribution of the drug from sites in the CNSAn IV anesthetic completely bypasses the process of absorption, because the drug is placed directly into the bloodstream. Highly perfused organs (vessel rich) including the brain take up disproportionately large amount of drug compared to less perfused areas (the muscle, fat, and vessel-poor groups). Drugs bound to plasma proteins are unavailable for uptake by an organ. After the highly perfused organs are saturated during initial distribution, the greater mass of the less perfused organs continue to take up drug from the bloodstream. As plasma concentration falls, some drug leaves the highly perfused organs to maintain equilibrium. This redistribution from the vessel-rich group is responsible for termination of effect of many anesthetic drugs.",

Anesthesia in Children -Induction. Inhalational induction* Inhalational agent with mask is the induction method of choice in children.* Sevoflurane is the inhalation agent of choice for induction. Sevoflurane is used in N2O+O2 gas mixture. Halothane is second choice inhalational agent for induction. Isoflurane and desflurane are not used for induction as they are more pungent and associated with more coughing 8c laryngospasm. Intravenous induction* Intravenous induction is preferred when induction by mask is contraindicated i. e., in full stomach patients or of child comes in the operation theatre with IV line in situ.* Thiopentol or propofol are commonly used agents. Propofol is particularly suitable for out patient surgery. Ketamine is preferred in children with hypovolemia. Etomidate can be used in child with unstable cardiovascular status as it is most cardio-vascular stable intravenous inducing agent. Maintenance* As sevoflurane cause emergence delirium and agitation, it is not used for maintenance. After induction with sevoflurane anaesthesia, isoflurane or Halothane are used for maintenance anaesthesia. During maintenance, anaesthetic gas mixture contain N2O+O2 +Halothane or isoflurane. Halothane is commonly used for induction and maintenance in children.* If sevoflurane is continued for maintenance, administration of an opioid (Fentanyl) 15-20 min before the end of the procedure can reduce the incidence of emergence delirium and agitation. Muscle relaxants. Depolarizing blockers* Children are more susceptible to cardiac arrhythmia, Hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis after administration of succinylcholine. If a child unexpectedly experiences cardiac arrest following administration of sucinylcholine, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. For this reason, succinylcholine is best avoided for routine elective surgery in children.* Generally accepted indications for succinylcholine are1) Rapid sequence induction, 2) Laryngospasm, and 3) Rapid muscle relaxation prior to intravenous access (e. g., regurgitation).* Profound bradycardia and sinus node arrest can develop in pediatric patients following first dose of succinyl choline, if given without pretreatment with atropine. Therefore, atropine must always be administered prior to succinylcholine in children.* Children with muscular dystrophy are more prone to develop hyperkalemia: Arrhythmia and cardiac arrest may occur - Should be avoided in such patients. Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants* Functional maturation of NM junction is not complete unti 12 months of age, therefore new born sarevery sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants.* Kidney and liver functions are immature in neonate - Atracurium/cisatracurium is the muscle relaxant of choice in newborn as it does not require renal or hepatic elimination. For the same reason mivacurium can also be used.* In older children the choice of non-depolarizing muscle relaxant depends on the side effects, and onset & duration of action: -i) Mivacurium for procedures lasting 10-15 min. ii) Atracurium/cisatracurium for precedures lasting around 30 min. iii) Pancuronium when tachycardia is desired e. g., with fentanyliv) Vecuronium (fastest acting non-depolarizing NM blocker) for intubation in place of SCH. v) Atracurium/cisatracurium in patients with renal or hepatic disease.",

        "question": "Which of the following is a pleasant anaesthetic agent preferred for inhalation mask anaesthesia in children?",
        "exp": "Ans. A. Sevolfurane. (Ref. Lee's Synopsis of Anaesthesia 13th/pg. 136). Sevoflurane, with low blood gas solubility allows rapid induction and early emergence. Due to its pleasant odor, it is nonirritant to the airway which makes it an attractive alternative for inhalational induction in children. An area where sevoflurane might be expected to find increasing use is that of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion which is becoming more frequent in paediatric ambulatory surgery as this avoids some of the hazards of endotracheal intubation. Inhalational Anaesthetics# HALOTHANE# ISOFLURANE# NITROUS OXIDE# SEVOFLURANESEVOFLURANE# used widely for induction in children as is not irritant to the airway and has good cardiovascular stability# apnea can occur with prolonged use of high concentrations; use for a brief time only# emergence times are usually short following sevoflurane anaesthesia (unless administration is prolonged); ensure adequate analgesia is given to cover the early recovery period# agitation during recovery appears to be common in children# there is a theoretical risk of nephrotoxicity due to Compound A which is formed by the breakdown of sevoflurane by carbon dioxide absorbents; reduce sevoflurane degradation by avoiding prolonged use in low-flow systems (<2 L/ minute).# Induction: Up to 8% inspired concentration in oxygen with or without nitrous oxide produces surgical anaesthesia in <2 minutes.# Maintenance: 0. 5-3% inspired concentration in oxygen with or without nitrous oxide; use concentrations in lower end of range when using nitrous oxide. HALOTHANE# Mode of action- Halothane is a volatile liquid anaesthetic. It's advantages are that it is potent, induction is smooth, pleasant to inhale, the vapor is not irritant to the skin and mucous membranes and does not produce necrosis when split on tissues. It suppresses salivary, mucous, bronchial, and gastric secretions and dilates the bronchioles.- Indications. Induction but more often for the maintenance of general anaesthesia.- Specific considerations. Halothane reduces muscle tone in pregnant uterus and generally its use is not recommended in obstetrics because of the increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage.- Halothane should not be used for patients with cardiac arrhythmias.- Halothane was considered to be unsafe in patients with acute porphyria.# Adverse Effects- Cardiovascular: Halothane has a depressant action on the cardiovascular systemand reduces blood pressure; signs of overdosage are bradycardia and profound hypotension. It is also a respiratory depressant and can cause cardiac arrhythmias; there have been instances of cardiac arrest. The sensitivity of the heart to sympathomimetic amines is increased.- Hepatic: dysfunction, hepatitis, and necrosis have been reported following the use of halothane, more frequent following repeated use. Serious hepatotoxicity has limited its use in recent years.- Other: malignant hyperpyrexia, involuntary muscle movements, hiccup, coughing, bronchospasm, laryngospasm and respiratory depression.# Drug interactions1. Adrenaline: the concurrent use of adrenaline with halothane may lead to seious side effects since fatalities have been reported in some patients associated with ventricular fibrillation. 2. Calcium-Channel Blockers: verapamil has been reported to cause cardiac arrest when given with halothane. 3. Morphine, chlorpromazine: both drugs increase the depressant effects of halothane. 4. Suxamethonium: reports of potentiation of suxamethonium-induced muscle damage by prior anaesthetic induction using halothane have been observed.# Sodium Bicarbonate: sodium bicarbonate, given to induce metabolic alkalosis, decreased total peripheral resistance during halothane anaesthsia and might lead to severe hypotension.# Dosage- Anaesthesia may be induced with 2 to 4% v/v of halothane in oxygen or mixtures of nitrous oxide and oxygen; It takes up to about 5 minutes to attain surgical anaesthesia and halothane produces little or no excitement in the induction period. For induction in children a concentration of 1. 5 to 2% v/v has been used.. The more usual practice is to induce anaesthesia with an intravenous agent. Anaesthesia is maintained with concentrations of 0. 5 to 2% v/v depending on the flow rate used; the lower concentration is usually suitable for the elderly. ISOFLURANE# Mode of action. Thought to enhance inhibitory ion channel activity and inhibit excitatory activity in the brain to induce hypnosis and amnesia, and in the spinal cord to cause immobility in response to painful stimuli.# Indications. Induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia.# Contraindications. Specific considerations. Pregnancy: Limited data; ADEC category B3. Reduce maintenance dose in obstetric anaesthesia. Breastfeeding: No data.# Adverse effects. Common: On induction, coughing, breath-holding, laryngospasm.# Dosage. Induction: 1. 5-3% inspired concentration in oxygen and nitrous oxide produces surgical anaesthesia within 10 minutes; alternatively, start at an inspired concentration of 0. 5% and increase gradually to the required level.# Maintenance: 0. 5-2. 5% inspired concentration in oxygen and nitrous oxide; 1. 5-3. 5% inspired concentration when used with oxygen alone. NITROUS OXIDEIntroduction:# in anaesthesia, it is mainly used as an adjunct to other inhalational anaesthetics, allowing them to be used at lower concentrations# it is a weak anaesthetic but has strong analgesic properties; used in subanaesthetic concentrations in obstetrics, emergency care and procedures not requiring loss of consciousness; premixed nitrous oxide 50% and oxygen 50% alone is suitable for self-administration# prolonged inhalation can inactivate vitamin B12 and interfere with DNA synthesis causing haematological and neuro- logical adverse effects; avoid exposures of >6 hours# whether or not chronic low level occupational exposure is harmful to staff remains unresolved; control nitrous oxide pollution using a scavenging system and effective ventilation# protect cylinders containing 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen from the cold; if cooled to temperatures < -7degC, liquid nitrous oxide separates and may require remixing before use# Mode of action. Nitrous oxide is an anesthetic administred by inhalation. It is a weak anaesthetic with minimum alveolar concentration value of 110%. It has strong analgesic properties, but produces little muscle relaxation.# Indications. Nitrous oxide is used as an adjuvant to other anaesthetics and permits them to be used at a significantly reduced dosage. It is given with oxygen for anaesthesia especially in obstetrics. Recovery is usually rapid from nitrous oxide anaesthesia.# Specific considerations. Air-containing cavities (e. g. middle ear occlusion, abdominal distension, pneumothorax, air embolus), or during or after pneumoencephalography or vitreoretinal surgery involving gases such as sulphur hexafluoride: risk of increased pressure and/or volume within such cavities. Vitamin B12 deficiency: increased risk of neurological dysfunction, including subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord with prolonged exposure. Pregnancy: Safe to use; ADEC category A.# Adverse effects. The main complications are those due to varying degrees of hypoxia.. Rare: With prolonged (eg >24 hours) or repeated use: megaloblastic anemia, leucopenia, agranulocytosis, neuropathy, myeloneuropathy. Dosage. Induction: 70% with 30% oxygen, (in combination with other anaesthetic agent). Maintenance: 30-70% with oxygen, (in combination with other anaesthetic agent). Analgesia: 25-50% with oxygen.",

Anesthesia in Children -Induction. Inhalational induction* Inhalational agent with mask is the induction method of choice in children.* Sevoflurane is the inhalation agent of choice for induction. Sevoflurane is used in N2O+O2 gas mixture. Halothane is second choice inhalational agent for induction. Isoflurane and desflurane are not used for induction as they are more pungent and associated with more coughing 8c laryngospasm. Intravenous induction* Intravenous induction is preferred when induction by mask is contraindicated i. e., in full stomach patients or of child comes in the operation theatre with IV line in situ.* Thiopentol or propofol are commonly used agents. Propofol is particularly suitable for out patient surgery. Ketamine is preferred in children with hypovolemia. Etomidate can be used in child with unstable cardiovascular status as it is most cardio-vascular stable intravenous inducing agent. Maintenance* As sevoflurane cause emergence delirium and agitation, it is not used for maintenance. After induction with sevoflurane anaesthesia, isoflurane or Halothane are used for maintenance anaesthesia. During maintenance, anaesthetic gas mixture contain N2O+O2 +Halothane or isoflurane. Halothane is commonly used for induction and maintenance in children.* If sevoflurane is continued for maintenance, administration of an opioid (Fentanyl) 15-20 min before the end of the procedure can reduce the incidence of emergence delirium and agitation. Muscle relaxants. Depolarizing blockers* Children are more susceptible to cardiac arrhythmia, Hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis after administration of succinylcholine. If a child unexpectedly experiences cardiac arrest following administration of sucinylcholine, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. For this reason, succinylcholine is best avoided for routine elective surgery in children.* Generally accepted indications for succinylcholine are1) Rapid sequence induction, 2) Laryngospasm, and 3) Rapid muscle relaxation prior to intravenous access (e. g., regurgitation).* Profound bradycardia and sinus node arrest can develop in pediatric patients following first dose of succinyl choline, if given without pretreatment with atropine. Therefore, atropine must always be administered prior to succinylcholine in children.* Children with muscular dystrophy are more prone to develop hyperkalemia: Arrhythmia and cardiac arrest may occur - Should be avoided in such patients. Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants* Functional maturation of NM junction is not complete unti 12 months of age, therefore new born sarevery sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants.* Kidney and liver functions are immature in neonate - Atracurium/cisatracurium is the muscle relaxant of choice in newborn as it does not require renal or hepatic elimination. For the same reason mivacurium can also be used.* In older children the choice of non-depolarizing muscle relaxant depends on the side effects, and onset & duration of action: -i) Mivacurium for procedures lasting 10-15 min. ii) Atracurium/cisatracurium for precedures lasting around 30 min. iii) Pancuronium when tachycardia is desired e. g., with fentanyliv) Vecuronium (fastest acting non-depolarizing NM blocker) for intubation in place of SCH. v) Atracurium/cisatracurium in patients with renal or hepatic disease.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Propofol Ambulatory (outpatient/day care) anaesthesia -* Ambulatory or day care or outpatient anaesthesia means, patient comes on same day, gets operated and is discharged on same day. So, the drugs used in outpatient anaesthesia are those which have short duration of action. Anaesthetic techniques and agents ideal for day care surgery are: -Premedication* Usually premedication is not used. However in anxious patients, midazolam is the drug of choice, which should be given 1-2 hours before the surgery with sip of water by oral route or 30 min. before surgery by im route. If patient is prone to nausea and vomiting, dolasetron is the drug of choice. Ondansetron is an alternative. Airway* Laryngeal mask airway is preferred over intubation. Intravenous anaesthetics* Intravenous route is the preferred method for induction. Propofol is the intravenous anaesthetic of choice for induction because of its smooth induction and rapid recovery. Antiemetic action of propofol is also beneficial - use of propofol for induction or maintenance of anaesthesia is associated with a reduced incidence of post- operative nausea and vomiting. Inhalational agents* Inhalational anaesthetics are preferred for the maintenance. Desflurane (1st choice) and sevoflurane (2nd choice are the agents of choice. These agents are used along with N2O as N2O decreases the requirement of other anaesthetics hence fastening the recovery. Halothane and isoflurane have largely been replaced by the less soluble desflurane and sevoflurane. Muscle relaxants* Mivacurium is the muscle relaxant of choice because of its short duration of action. Succinylcholine should be avoided as it causes post-operative myalgia. However, if intubation is required, succinylcholine remains the agent of choice. Opioid analgesics* Opioids compounds are frequently administered during anaesthesia to suppress autonomic responses to tracheal intubation and painful (noxious) surgical stimuli. These drugs are also useful supplements to inhaled anaesthetics during maintenance period. Alfentanil is the agent of choice because of rapid onset and shorter duration of action. Remifentanil is emerging as an alternative because of much shorter duration of action. Fentanyl or sufentanil can also be used.",

        "question": "A 40 year old dental assistant presents with increased weakness and fatigue. Lab tests reveal megaloblastic anemia. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the presence of anemia?",
        "exp": "Answer: b) Nitrous oxide. NITROUS OXIDE (laughing gas). Has second gas effect during induction & diffusion hypoxia after discontinuation of anesthesia in recovery phase. As N2O is used in high concentration (70-80%) it leads to entry of N2O in blood at a rate higher than minute (1 lit/min) volume. N2O has low blood solubility. So it rapidly diffuse into alveoli & dilutes the alveolar air-Partial Pressure of O2 in alveoli is reduced i. e. diffusion hypoxia. Diffusion hypoxia is prevented by administering 100% oxygen for 5-10 min after discontinuing N2. OPoynting effect: Entonox (50% O2 & 50% N2O) & mixture of gases (O2 & N2O) keeps them in gaseous form. If another potent anesthetic eg. Halothane is added, it also will be delivered to the blood at a rate higher than minute volume & the induction will be faster. N2O is a good analgesic but weak anaesthetic and poor muscle relaxant. Hence it is not a complete anaesthetic. N2O has blood gas coefficient of 0. 47 and has fast induction. It has MAC value of 104; Hence Potency is low. N2O is used as a carrier gas given in a mixture of 33% O2 and 66% N2. OContraindications for N2O: Middle ear surgeries and tympanoplasty. Laparoscopic surgeries. Acute intestinal obstruction and volvulus. Microlaryngeal surgeries. Pneumothorax, pneumoperitonium. Eye surgeries. Pneumoencephalos. It should be avoided in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Adverse effects: bone marrow depression (agranulocytosis, megaloblastic anemia) and even neurological deficiencies (peripheral neuropathies and pernicious anemia). NOTE: Nitrous oxide is one of the most common anesthetics used in dental procedures. Prolonged exposure to nitrous oxide results in the development of megaloblastic anemia. Mechanism: Nitrous oxide oxidizes the cobalt in methylcobalamin to produce physiologically inactive B12. The resultant deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia. Severe forms even present with myelosuppression and sub-acute combined degeneration. Side effects of nitrous oxide: Methylcobalamin deficiency. Pneumothorax and pneumoperitoneum. Methemoglobinemia.",

E1, and to a lesser extent by CYP3. A4 and CYP2. A6o. Lidocaine is about 95% metabolized (dealkylated) in the liver mainly by CYP3. A4o. The unique feature of atracurium is inactivation in plasma by spontaneous nonenzymatic degradation (Hofman elimination) in addition to that by alkaline ester hydrolysis. Propofolo. The principal site for the metabolism of propofol is the liver. However, the total body clearance of propofol is greater than the generally accepted hepatic blood flow and significant extrahepatic metabolism also occur in lungs, and excreted via kidney. Metabolic clearance of propofol by the kidneys accounts for almost one-third of total body clearance and may be the major contributor to the extra-hepatic elimination of this drug. Halothaneo. Halothane is an inhalational anesthetic. Most of the inhaled anesthetics are eliminated from lung, though some metabolism in liver may occur. In terms of extent of hepatic metabolism, the rank of order is methoxyflurane (>50%) > Halothane (20%)> Ether (10-15%)> enflurane (3-5%)> Sevoflurane (3%)> Isoflurane (0. 2%)> desflurane (<0. 1%)>N2 O(0%). N2 O does not have any metabolism in the body. o. Halothane is metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2. E1, and to a lesser extent by CYP3. A4 and CYP2. A6 Lignocaineo. Lidocaine is about 95% metabolized (dealkylated) in the liver mainly by CYP3. A4 to the pharmacologically active metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and then subsequently to the inactive glycine xylidide. Lignocaine clearance is reduced in patients with liver disease and appears to be a sensitive index of liver dysfunction. Atracuriumo. The unique feature of atracurium is inactivation in plasma by spontaneous non-enzymatic degradation (Hoffman elimination) in addition to that by alkaline ester hydrolysis. Consequently its duration of action is not altered in patients with hepatic/renal insufficiency or hypodynamic circulation - Preferred muscle relaxant for such patients as well as for neonates and the elderlyo. The major degradation product is laudanosine. Metabolites can be considered as pharmacologically inactive with the usual doses of atracurium. Because of spontaneous degradation of atracurium in plasma, its kinetics is theoretically independent of renal and liver functions.",

        "question": "The most suitable agent for IV induction and maintenance in a day care surgery?",
        "exp": "Ans. c (Propofol) (Ref: Morgan's 3rd edition, p. 173, 804; Lee Anaesthesia 12th edition, p. 417). Currently, propofol has superceded thiopentone as an i. v. anaesthetic, both for induction as well as maintenance. It lacks airway irritancy and is particularly suited for outpatient surgery, because residual impairment is less marked and shorter-lasting. Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting patient acceptability is very good. DAY CARE ANESTHESIAMSIAPMMivacurium(Muscle relaxant of choice). Succinylcholine(for intubation). Isoflurane & Desflurane(Inhalation agent of choice). Alfentarnil(for Amnesia). Propofol(as inducing) agent of choice). Midazolam(For relief of anxietyand sedation)PROPOFOLChemistry and Formulations# The active ingredient in propofol, 2, 6-diisopropylphenol, is essentially insoluble in aqueous solutions and is formulated only for IV administration as a 1% (10 mg/mL) emulsion in 10% soybean oil, 2. 25% glycerol, and 1. 2% purified egg phosphatide. Dosage and Clinical Use# The induction dose of propofol in a healthy adult is 1. 5 to 2. 5 mg/kg and it has an onset and duration of anesthesia similar to thiopental. For short procedures, small boluses (10% to 50% of the induction dose) every 5 minutes or as needed are effective. An infusion of propofol produces a more stable drug level (100 to 300 mg/kg per minute) and is better suited for longer-term anesthetic maintenance. Propofol elicits pain on injection. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism# Propofol's shorter duration after infusion can be explained by its very high clearance, coupled with the slow diffusion of drug from the peripheral to the central compartment. The rapid clearance of propofol explains its less severe hangover compared with barbiturates, and may allow for a more rapid discharge from the recovery room. Propofol is metabolized in the liver to less active metabolites that are renally excreted; however, its clearance exceeds hepatic blood flow, and an hepatic metabolism has been demonstrated. Propofol is highly protein bound, and its pharmacokinetics, like those of the barbiturates, may be affected by conditions that alter serum protein levels. Side Effects# Nervous System. The CNS effects of propofol are similar to those of barbiturates. Propofol decreases CMRO:, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial and intraocular pressures by about the same amount as thiopental. Unlike thiopental, propofol is not a proven acute intervention for seizures.# Cardiovascular. Causes fall in blood pressure that can be explained by both vasodilation and mild depression of myocardial contractility. As with thiopental, propofol should be used with caution in patients at risk for or intolerant of decreases in blood pressure.# Respiratory and Other Side Effects. At equipotent doses, propofol produces a slightly greater degree of respiratory depression than thiopental. Patients given propofol should be monitored to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Although propofol does cross placental membranes, it is considered safe for use in pregnant women, and like thiopental, only transiently depresses activity in the newborn.",
