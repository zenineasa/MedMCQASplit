Block of this nerve can be used to supplement pain relief during the second stage of labor. The S2-S4 nerves give off branches to the pudendal nerve that pass between the pyriformis and coccygeal muscles. The nerve is blocked at the pudendal canal, just lateral and inferior to the sacroaspinous ligament. A pudendal nerbe block does not abolish sensation from anterior and lateral part of perineum and hence a block of ilioinguinal and/or posterior cutaneous nerve of thigh may also be required.",

File/62297/50293. Spinal Anesthesia for Lower Segment Cesarean Section (LSCS). Spinal anesthesia, which blocks the nerve roots as they course through the subarachnoid space, has become the preferred technique for LSCSs. This is because general anaesthesia is associated with a higher incidence of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents and failed endotracheal intubations compared to other types of surgery, causing higher rates of morbidity and mortality'. Furthermore, spinal anesthesia offers less neonatal exposure to potentially depressant drugs and allows early bonding between mothers and their babies, as mothers are awake throughout the procedure.

Spinal anesthesia requires the injection of a small volume of local anesthetic agent directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the lumbar region, below the level of Ll/2, where the spinal cord ends. A line joining both iliac crests (Tuffiers line) passes across the spine of L4 and is a reliable landmark for locating the L3/4 interspace, which is the L3/4 interspace, which isusually easily defined and is the one most often used. Method: Sterilize the skin over the lumbar spine and raise a skin weal with lidocaine 1% over the appropriate interspace. Inject 2-3 ml more lidocaine into the subcutaneous tissue. Insert the needle or introducer in the midline at 90 degrees to the skin. Feedback from the needle tip will monitor the progress of the needle through the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, the ligamentum flavum and sometimes the dura mater. If bone is contacted, withdraw the needle to the subcutaneous tissue and redirect slightly cephalad in the first instance.
