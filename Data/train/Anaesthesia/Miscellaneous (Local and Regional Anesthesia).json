Conduction blockA. Field blocko Is produced by subcutaneous injection of a solution of local anaesthetic in order to anaesthetize the region distal to the injection. o For example, subcutaneous infiltration of the proximal portion of the volar surface of the forearm results in extensive area of cutaneous anaesthesia that starts 2 to 3 cm distal to the site of injection. B. Nerve blocko LA is injected around a peripheral nerve or a plexus. Examples are -Upper limb - brachial plexus and wrist block. Head & Neck - Stellate ganglion block, trigeminal nerve block. Thorax & abdomen - Interc4ostal nerve & celiac plexuso Note - Most common complication of brachial plexus block is pneumothorax.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Na channel inhibition inside gate o Local anesthetics act by inhibiting Na+ channels from inside. Mechanism of action of LAo Local anaesthetics block generation and conduction of nerve impulse at all part of neuron where they come in contact, without causing structural damage. o Thus not only sensory but motor impulses and autonomic control is also interrupted, o Mechanism of action# Normally Na+ channel in axonal membrane has following phases: LAs prolong the inactive state - channel takes longer to recover - refractory period of the fiber is increased. LAs first penetrate the axonol membrane to come inside and then their active species (cationic form) bind to Na+ channel from inside. Cationic form (active form) is able to approach its receptor only when the channel is open at the inner face - So resting nerve is resistant to block as Na+ channels are not activated and cationic form is not able to approach its receptor. So blockade develops rapidly when the nerve is stimulated repeatedly. Degree of blockade is frequency dependent - greater blockade at higher frequency of stimulation. Exposure to higher concentration of Ca+2 reduces inactivation of Na+ channels and lessens the block. o Order of blockade of fibres B > C > Ad > Aa, b & g (Autonomic > Sensory > Motor). Order of recovery is in reverse order. o Among sensory afferent order of block is: Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure, o When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sweet and sour, and salty taste last of all. o Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated, o Smaller fibres are more sensitive than larger fibres.",

        "exp": "Ans: C (Bretylium) TREATMENT OF BUP1. VACA1. NE INDUCED CARDIOTOXIC1. TY MILLER 6. TH/933\"Many resuscitation drugs, including atropine, epinephrine, bretylium, lidocaine, amrinone, and phenytoin, have been used in animal studies and occasionally in humans for the treatment of bupivacaine overdose and cardiovascular collapse. In our view, beyond the established uses of epinephrine, vasopressin, and atropine in their designated steps in the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol and beyond the use of Intralipid as detailed later, there is no established role for anti arrhythmic drugs or other traditional resuscitation drugs in the setting of bupivacaine-induced cardiac arrest It is not recommended that bupivacaine-induced ventricular arrhythmias be treated with iidocaine or amiodarone. The clinical implications for cardiac resuscitation after intravascular injection or overdose of local anesthetic are the following: Miller 6th/933. No medications are uniformly effective in facilitating resuscitation from bupivacaine-induced cardiac arrest or severe ventricular tachycardia. Basic principles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be emphasized first, including attention to securing the airway; providing oxygenation and ventilation, and performing chest compressions if needed. Because resuscitation after local anesthetic-induced circulatory collapse is so difficult, prevention of massive intravascular injection or excessive dosing is crucial. Negative aspiration of the syringe does not always exclude intravascular placement, incremental, fractionated dosing should be the rule for all patients undergoing major conduction blockade. Although changes on the ECG are not always present before circulatory collapse, they often are, and continuous attention to the ECG (including changes in QRS morphology, rate, rhythm, or ectopy) may be lifesaving by terminating injection before a lethal dose is administered. If a patient experiences profound cardiovascular depression or circulatory arrest after the administration of bupivacaine, ropivacaine, or by extrapolation, other local anesthetics, then along with initiation of basic life support and the. ACLS protocol we support the recommendation of Weinberg and colleagues that a rapid bolus of Intralipid 20%<t\\ 1. 5 mL/kg (or roughly 100 mL in adults), be administered without delay, followed if necessary by an infusion of 0. 25 mL/kg/min for the next 10 minutes. Treatment of Bupivacaine Induced Cardiotoxicity Barash Anesthesia 6th/545\"Potent local anesthetics (e. g., bupivacaine! can produce profound cardiovascular depression and malignant dysrhythmias that should be promptly treated. Oxygenation and ventilation must be immediately instituted, with cardiopulmonary resuscitation if needed. Ventricular dysrhythmias may be difficult to treat and may need large and multiple doses of electrical cardioversion, epinephrine, vasopressin, and amiodarone. The use of calcium channel blockers in this setting is not recommended, as its cardiodepressant effect is exaggerated\"A novel and promising treatment for cardiac toxicity is the administration of intravenous lipid to theoretically remove bupivacaine from sites of action. Administration of 100 mL of 20% lipid solution has been reported to allow successful resuscitation of a patient from bupivacaine-induced dysrhythmias refractory to conventional therapy. These findings raise the question of whether standard propofol in a 10% lipid solution would be a preferred treatment for cardiac toxicity. However, the dose of lipid in a standard induction dose of propofol would be too small and the dose of propofol would lead to unacceptable cardiac depression",

Maximum dose of lignocaine with adrenaline for local blocks in ophthalmic surgeries is 7 mg/kg. \"Maximum safe dose of lignocaine with epinephrine is 500 mg or 7 mg/kg. Lignocaine (Lidocaine or Xylocaine). Most commonly used LA. It is amide linked local anaesthetic that can be used as surface anesthetic agent (i. e. through mucous membrane or skin)Q. Lignocaine: Characteristic Features. Vaso-ineffective: Neither vasoconstrictor nor vasodilator. No mydriasis and cycloplegia. Propranolol increases risk of toxicity by decreasing clearance. Contraindicated in malignant hyperpyrexia and in patients with history of convulsions. Dose related neurological effects is main toxicity. Mechanism of Action: Lignocaine blocks both open (active) and closed (inactivated) cardiac Na+ channelsQ. Lignocaine is a local anesthetic that also is useful in acute intravenous therapy of ventricular arrhythmias. It is not useful in atrial arrhythmias. Lidocaine decreases the automaticity by reducing the slope of phase 4 and altering the threshold for excitability. Lidocaine is the least cardiotoxicQ of currently used Na+ channel blocker. Pharmacokinetics: It is well absorbed but undergoes extensive though variable first pass hepatic metabolismQ (only ~3% orally administered drug appearing in plasma); thus oral use of the drug is inappropriate. Therapeutic plasma concentrations of lidocaine may be maintained by intermittent intra muscular injections, but the IV route is preferred.

Maximum safe dose. Maximum safe dose with Adrenaline4. 5 mg/kg or 300 mg. Q7 mg/kg or 500 mg. QUses of Lignocaine: It is used to suppress ventricular tachycardia (VT) and prevent ventricular fibrillation (VF). Its efficacy in chronic ventricular arrhythmia is poor but it suppresses VT due to digitalis toxicity (because it does not worsen AV block). However, it is not routinely prophylacticallY used to prevent VF in all acute Ml patients because it may increase mortality. Side-Effects of Lignocaine. CNSCVSRespiratory.

        "question": "Mechanism of action of Local anesthetics:",
        "exp": "Ref: Miller Textbook of Anaesthesia. 6th edition. Explanation: Mechanism of action of Local anesthetics. The primary mechanism of action of local anesthetics is blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. The excitable membrane of nerve axons, like the membrane ot cardiac muscle and neuronal cell bodies, maintains a resting transmembrane potential of -90 to -60 mV. During excitation, the sodium channels open, and a fast inward sodium current quickly depolarizes the membrane toward the sodium equilibrium potential t+40 mV). As a result of depolarization, the sodium channels close (inactivate) and potassium channels open. The outward flow of potassium repolarizes the membrane toward the potassium equilibrium potential (about -95 mV): repolarization returns the sodium channels to the rested state. Biologic toxins such as batrachotoxin. aconitine, veratridine. and some scorpion venoms bind to receptors within the channel and prevent inactivation. This results in prolonged influx of sodium through the channel and depolarization of the resting potential. The marine toxins tetrodotoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin block sodium channels by binding to channel receptors near the extracellular surface. Their clinical effects superficially resemble those of local anesthetics (ie, block of conduction without a change in the resting potential) even though their receptor site is quite different. The blockade of sodium channels by most local anesthetics is both voltage- and time-dependent: Channels in the rested state, which predominate at more negative membrane potentials, have a much lower affinity for local anesthetics than activated (open state) and inactivated channels, w-hich predominate at more positive membrane potentials. Elevated extracellular calcium partially antagonizes the action of local anesthetics owing to the calcium-induced increase in the surface potential on the membrane (which favors the low-affinity rested state). Increases in extracellular potassium depolarize the membrane potential and favor the inactivated state, enhancing the effect of local anesthetics.",

Brugada J. Mechanisms of the cardiac toxicity of bupivacaine. Ann Fr Anesth Reanim. 1988; 7(3): 204-10. Explanation: Bupivacaine is the most cardiotoxic of all the local anaesthetics. Associated with sudden increase in the plasma concentration of bupivacaine. It involves both electrical and mechanical structures within the heart. The main site of action on cardiac conduction tissue is the Vmax of phase 0 of the action potential of fast-reacting structures tl. Na current). Bupivacaine, like lidocaine and the other class I antiarrhythmic drugs, blocks the sodium channels, this block being more slowly reversible. The disturbance of sodium channels throughout the heart leads to a decreased conduction speed throughout the conduction system, thus explaining possible acute conduction disturbances originating below the bundle of His. The ventricular dysarrhythmias are due to a re-entry circuit secondary to a slowing in conduction speed. The sinus bradycardias and junctional disturbances seen in toxic accidents are probably due to an inhibition of the slow current of the atrial and atrio-ventricular nodes (Isi current!. Bupivacaine, at toxic levels, has a direct effect on contractility. The negative inotropic effects seem to be due to a fall in the intracytoplasmic calcium concentration on wrhich depends the excitation- contraction couple, as well as disturbed cellular energetic events dependent on the contraction. Bupivacaine is disproportionately more cardiotoxic than its shorter-acting counterparts like ropivacaine and levobupivacaine. While all local anaesthetics can cause direct negative inotropic effects, ropivacaine and levobupivacaine are less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine.",
