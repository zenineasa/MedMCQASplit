It is the earliest and most sensitive indicator. o Hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, elevated creatininephosphokinase, muscle rigidity, o Increased myoglobin, renal failure. o Muscle biopsy contracture test (definitive diagnostic procedure):- The muscle biopsy contracture test is the most sensitive and specific test. The Caffeine Halothane Contracture test (CHCT), a test performed on freshly biopsied muscle; is the \"gold standard\" for diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia. However, the test is available only at few centers in the world (only about 30 centers world wide) and it is very costly. The CHCT test should be considered for all those judged to be at significant risk for malignant hyperthermia, either through family history, or by elicitation of signs of an episode of malignant hyperthermia, or if there had been any previous uncharacterized adverse reaction to a general anesthetic.

        "exp": "Ref: Miller Textbook of Anaesthesia. 6th edition. Explanation: Succinyl Choline - Mechanism of action1. Phase 1 block (depolarizing). Succinylcholine is the only clinically useful depolarizing blocking drug. Its neuromuscular effects are like those of acetylcholine except that succinylcholine produces a longer effect at the myoneural junction. Succinylcholine reacts with the nicotinic receptor to open the channel and cause depolarization of the motor end plate, and this in turn spreads to the adjacent membranes, causing contractions of muscle motor units. Because succinylcholine is not metabolized effectively at the synapse, the depolarized membranes remain depolarized and unresponsive to subsequent impulses (ie, in a state of depolarizing block). Furthermore, because excitation-contraction coupling requires end plate repolarization (\"reprintmg\") and repetitive firing to maintain muscle tension, a flaccid paralysis results. This so-called phase 1 (depolarizing) block is thus augmented, not reversed, by cholinesterase inhibitors. 2. Phase II block (desensitizing). With continued exposure to succinylcholine, the initial end plate depolarization decreases and the membrane becomes repolarized. Despite this re polarization, the membrane cannot easily be depolarized again because it is desensitized. The mechanism for this desensitizing phase is unclear, but some evidence indicates that channel block may become more important than agonist action at the receptor in phase II of succinylcholine' s neuromuscular blocking action. Later in phase II. the characteristics of the blockade are nearly identical to those of a nondepolarizing block (ie, a nonsustained twitch response to a tetanic stimulus), with reversal by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.",

It was administered in intermittent dosing (total 640 mg). During recovery patient was not able to respire spontaneously & move limbs. What is the explanation -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Phase 2 blockade produced succinylcholine Patients developing paralysis after prolonged and high dose of succinyl choline is highly suggestive of phase II succinyl choline block. Phase II block with succinylcholine occurs with prolonged and high dose of the drug. (High dose for Sch is 7-10 mg/kg, 30-60 minutes of exposure is considered prolong). Morgan's Anaesthesia 4th/e p. 112. The type of succinylcholine block may change into a non depolarizing block following prolonged administration of the drug (phase II block). Transition from a depolarizing to phase II block is gradual and usually occurs after administration of 7-10 mg/kg of succinylcholine. Recovery from a phase II block is much slower. Millers Anaesthesia 6th/e p. 985. After administration of 7-10 mg/kg or 30-60 minutes of exposure to succinylcholine, non depolarizing dual or phase II block occurs. Prolonged paralysis with succinylcholine administration may also occur in pseudocholinesterase deficiency. But in pseudocholinesterase deficiency prolonged paralysis occurs with usual dose of succinylcholine. Succinylcholine is a noncompetitive muscle relaxant. Normally muscles contract due to the action of acetylcholine released in the neuromuscular synaptic junctions. Acetylcholine acts by activating its receptors present on motor end plate, and generates action potential. Competitive Neuromuscular blockers act by blocking the action of acetylcholine and prevents the generation of action potential. On the other hand succinylcholine acts by depolarization of the motor end plate i. e. it activates the acetylcholine receptor present at the motor end plate. At their first application voluntary muscle contracts but as they are not destroyed immediately like acetylcholine the depolarization persist. It might be expected that this prolonged depolarization would cause muscles to remain contracted but this is not so. With prolonged administration, a depolarization block changes to competitive block. Succinylcholine produces neuromuscular block by overstimulation so that the end plate is unable to respond to further stimulation. Neuromuscular block with succinylcholine occurs in two sequential phases. An initial depolarization of the endplate produces muscle action potentials and fasciculations. Maintained depolarization past the threshold for firing produces Na+ channel inactivation so that muscle action potentials cannot be generated. This is called phase I or depolarization block. In the continued presence of succinylcholine, the membrane becomes repolarized *Na+ channel inactivation is reversed and muscle membrane excitability is restored. Nonetheless, the neuromuscular block persists because of desensitization of Acetylcholine receptors. This is known as phase II or desensitization block. The mechanism for phase II block is not completely understood, a series of allosteric transitions in Acetylcholine receptor is suspected. Succinylcholine phase I block changes to phase II block after prolonged administration of the drue usually following 7-10 mg/kg of the drug or 700 mg drug. Pseudocholinesterase deficiency. Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine which is pharmacologically inactive. In certain conditions metabolism of succinylcholine to the metabolically inactive succinylmonocholine cannot occur. These are: -Genetic determined inability to metabolize succinylcholine. Small proportion of patients have genetically determined inability to metabolize succinylcholine. In these patients either the plasma cholinesterase is absent or there is an abnormal form of the enzyme present. The metabolism of succinylcholine is reduced and the patient have prolonged paralysis. An important point to note is that this prolonged paralysis occurs even with usual doses of succinylcholine. Other endogenous and exogenous causes. Plasma cholinesterase activity can be reduced by a number of endogenous and exogenous causes such as: -Pregnancy. Liver disease. Uremia. Malnutrition. Burns. Plasma pheresis. Oral contraceptives. These conditions usually lead to a slight clinically unimportant increase in the duration of action of succinylcholine.",

Phase I blocko Rapid in onseto Result from persistant depolarization of muscle end plate - Typical mechanism of action of depolarizing blocker. o Has classical features of depolarization block, o Block is not antagonized by anticholinesterases (neostigmine). Phase II block (Dual block)o Slow in onseto Results from desensitization of receptor to ACh - Ach can not act on Nm receptors (similar to competitive blocker). o Resembles block produced by competitive blockers - Therefore, has characteristics similar to non-depolarizing (competitive) block. o Block is partially reversed by anticholinesterases (Neostigmine). In man, normally, only phase I block is seen - typical depolarizing block. Phase II block is seen when fluorinated anaesthetics have been given or when SCh is injected in high dose. SCh also produces phase II block in patients with atypical or deficient pseudocholinesterase.",

        "question": "An eye surgery was performed using propofol as the intravenous anesthetic agent and succinylcholine as the muscle relaxant. Recovery from anesthesia was uneventful. However, after 8 hours of surgery, patient complained of pain in legs on walking. Which of the following is the most likely reason for this?",
        "exp": "Ans. b. Succinylcholine (Ref: Miller's Anesthesia 8/e p866; Morgan 4/e p210-215; Lee 13/e p181-191). Succinylcholine is a short acting depolarizing muscle relaxant, which causes initial fasciculations during induction. It can cause muscle soreness and post-op muscle pain. Succinylcholine (Scoline, Suxamethonium or Diacetylcholine). Suxamethonium chloride, a dicholine ester of acetyl cholineA clear, colorless aqueous solution of pH 3. 0-5. 0 with a shelf life of 2 years. QStored at 4deg. CQSpontaneous hydrolysis occurs in alkaline or warm conditionsQ. Metabolism: Sch is the only depolarizing (non-competitive) muscle relaxantQ in clinical use. It is the only neuromuscular blocker with a rapid onset of action (30-60 seconds) and ultra short (shortest) duration of actionQ (3-5 min; typically < 10 min). Its rapid onset effect is mainly due to its low lipid solubilityQ and relatively overdose that is administered. The short duration of action is due to rapid hydrolysis by butyrylcholinesterase (plasma cholinesterase or pseudocholinesteraseQ). Dibucaine number indicates the percentage of inhibition of pseudocholinesteraseQ (butyrylcholinesterase) enzyme activity by local anesthetic dibucaine and it is a measure of qualitative activity of pseudocholinesterase. The dibucaine number indicates the genetic make up of an individual with respect to butyrylcholinesterase. it does not measure the concentration of enzyme in plasma, nor does it indicate the efficiency of enzyme in hydrolysing substrate succinylcholine or mivacuriumQ. Dibucaine number is proportional to enzyme function (quality) and independent of amount of enzyme (i. e. quantity)Q. Prolonged paralysis from succinylcholine caused by atypical (abnormal) pseudochoiinesterase should be treated with continued mechanical ventilation until muscle fasciculation returns to normalQ. Anticholinesterases neostigmine and pyridostigmine are avoidedQ, as these may prolong the effect of Sch. Side Effects: Sch is a relatively safe drug but because of risk of hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis and cardiac arrest (profound bradycardia) in children with undiagnosed myopathies, Sch is considered contraindicated in routine management of children and adolescent. Side effects of Succinylcholine include an increase in* Muscle tone (masseter spasm)Q* Muscle fasciculations (signal onset of paralysis)Q* Muscle pains or myalgia (MC complication)Q* Hyperkalemia leading to diastolic cardiac arrest refractory to CPRQ* Introcutar, intracranial, intra abdominal, intragastric pressure and opening pressure of lower esophageal sphincter (all increased)* Malignant hyperthermia. QManagement of Side-effects: Sinus bradycardias, nodal (junctional rhythms and ventricular dysrhythmiasQ occur. Children are particularly susceptible to profound bradycardia. Intravenous atropine is prophylactically, given to children prior to first dose and always before a 2nd dose. Side effects especially myalgia and fasciculation can be prevented by precurarization, self-taming with IV scoline, IV lignocaine and faster infusion. But pretreatment with small doses of nondeplarizing relaxant (e. g. rocuronium) remain the most commonly used method. QMalignant Hyperpyrexia: Autosomal dominant. Predisposing conditions: Duchene muscular dystrophyQ, HalothaneQ and Succinyl choline. QTreatment: DantroleneQ, bromocriptine and external cooling",

        "exp": "ANSWER: (B) Ryanodine receptor. REF: Morgan 3ra e p. 869. This condition is known by a number of names, including malignant hyperthermia (MH), malignant hyperthermia syndrome (MHS), and malignant hyperpyrexia. Signs and symptoms: The typical symptoms of malignant hyperthermia are due to a hyper catabolic state, which presents as a very high temperature, an increased heart rate and breathing rate, increased carbon dioxide production, increased oxygen consumption, acidosis, rigid muscles, and rhabdomyolysis. The symptoms usually develop within one hour after exposure to trigger substances, but may even occur several hours later in rare instances. Causes: Volatile anesthetic gases Local anesthetics Depolarizing muscle 1 relaxantshalothane, sevoflurane, desfluranelidocaine, bupivicaine, mepivacainesuccinylcholine. Other. Opiates (morphine, fentanyl), ketamine, barbiturates, nitrous oxide, propofol, etomidate, benzodiazepines. Genetics: Malignant hyperthermias inheritance is autosomal dominant.
