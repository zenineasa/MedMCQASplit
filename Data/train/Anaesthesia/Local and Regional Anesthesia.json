Absolute contraindications:# Patient refusal, hemodynamic instability, infection at the anticipated site of puncture, and absence of resuscitation equipment. Relative contraindications:# Fever, preexisting CNS disease, hypovolemia, hypotension, lack of experience by the anesthetist, and blood coagulation defects.# Although an arbitrary platelet count of 100, 000 per mm3 has been advocated as the lower limit for safe lumbar epidural analgesia, successful blocks without epidural bleeding complications have been obtained with platelet counts as low as 50, 000 per mm3. Three principal advantages of lumbar epidural analgesia:# The parturient remains awake and cooperative.# The incidence of complications is very low when the technique is used correctly.# Once an epidural catheter is in place, it can be used to provide analgesia or anesthesia for a vaginal or cesarean delivery.

        "exp": "Ans. d (Subarachnoid space). (Ref. Harrisons, Medicine, 18th/735)SPINAL ANESTHESIA# The term \"spinal anesthesia\" was coined in 1885 by Leonard Corning. Technique of spinal anesthesia:# In spinal anaesthesia the spinal needle is pierced upto subarachnoid space where the anaesthetic agent is injected to produce the anaesthesia.# The selected level should be below LI in an adult and L3 in a child to avoid needle trauma to the spinal cord. As an anatomic landmark, the L3-L4 interspace is located at the line intersecting the top of the iliac crests. Either a midline or paramedian approach can be used.# The anatomic layers passed through include skin, subcutaneous structures, supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, dura mater, and arachnoid membrane.# Once the needle tip is believed to be in the subarachnoid space, the stylet is removed to see if CSF appears at the needle hub. With small diameter needles (26 to 29 gauge) this generally requires 5 to 10 seconds, but may require >1 minute in some patients. Gentle aspiration may speed the appearance of CSF. If CSF does not appear, the needle orifice may be obstructed by a nerve root and rotating the needle 90 degrees may result in CSF flow. Alternatively, the needle orifice may not be completely in the subarachnoid space and advancing an additional 1 to 2 mm may result in brisk CSF flow. This is particularly true of pencil-point needles, which have their orifice on the side of the needle shaft proximal to the needle tip.# Finally, failure to obtain CSF suggests that the needle orifice is not in the subarachnoid space and the needle should be reinserted.# Common complications include hypotension, bradycardia, increased sensitivity to sedative medications, nausea and vomiting (possibly secondary to hypotension), postdural puncture headache, nerve injury, total spinal, and hematoma/abscess formation at the site of puncture.# Total spinal anesthesia results from local anesthetic depression of the cervical spinal cord and brain stem. Signs and symptoms include dysphonia, dyspnea, upper extremity weakness, loss of consciousness, pupillary dilation, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Eaily recognition is the key to management. Treatment includes securing the airway, mechanical ventilation, volume infusion, and pressor support.# Absolute contraindications include local infection at the puncture site, bacteremia, severe hypovolemia, coagulopathy, severe stenotic valvular disease, infection at the site of the procedure, and intracranial hypertension. Relative contraindications include progressive degenerative (demyelinating) neurologic disease (multiple sclerosis), low back pain, and sepsis.# Intrathecal opioids:- Opioids produce intense visceral analgesia and may prolong sensory blockade without affecting motor or sympathetic function.- Fentanyl and sufentanil have a rapid onset of action and an effective duration greater than 6 hours.- Morphine lasts 6-24 hours.- Side effects include respiratory depression (which may occur late with hydrophilic agents), nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and urinary retention.",

When local anesthetic-induced seizures occur, hypoxia, hypercarbia and acidosis develop rapidly. ABC (Airway, Breathing and Circulation) is the mainstay of treatment. Administration of O2 by mask, or ventilation support by bag and mask, is often all that is necessary to treat seizures. If seizures interfere with ventilation, benzodiazepines, small dose propofol or thiopental can be used. The use of succinylcholine effectively facilitates ventilation and, by abolishing muscular activity, decreases the severity of acidosis. However neuronal seizure activity is not inhibited and therefore, cerebral metabolism and oxygen requirements remain increased. LOCALANAESTHETICSMechanism of action of local anesthetics# Diffusion of the unionized (base) form across the nerve sheath and membrane# Re-equilibration between the base and cationic forms in the axoplasm# Binding of the cation to a receptor site inside of the Na+ channel, resulting in its blockade and consequent inhibition of Na+ conductance.

        "exp": "B. Selectively binds to rocuronium. Sugammadex Morgan 5th/23l. Sugammadex is a novel selective relaxant-binding agent. Its three-dimensional structure resembles a hollow truncated cone or doughnut with a hydrophobic cavity and a hydrophilic exterior. Hydrophobic interactions trap the drug (e. g., rocuronium) in the cyclodextrin cavity (doughnut hole), resulting in tight formation of a water-soluble guest-host complex in a 1: 1 ratio. This terminates the neuromuscular blocking action and restrains the drug in extracellular fluid where it cannot interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is essentially eliminated unchanged via the kidneys. It produces rapid and effective reversal of both shallow and profound rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in a consistent manner.* Barash 6th/Chap 20. Sugammadex, previously called ORG 25969, leads to restoration of normal neuromuscular function not by interfering with acetylcholine, the nicotinic receptor or acetylcholinesterase, but by selectively binding to rocuronium, and to a lesser extent to vecuronium and pancuronium. Selective relaxant binding agent for reversal of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) induced by rocuronium or vecuronium in adults undergoing surgery\"-reference. medscape. com. The compound is a cyclodextrin, made up of eight sugars arranged in a ring to make a center to accommodate the rocuronium molecule. Once bound, rocuronium is held in place by polar side chains attached to the ring. Because sugammadex does not bind to any known receptory it is devoid of major cardiovascular or other side effects. It does not bind neuromuscular blocking drugs that do not have a steroid nucleus. The benzylisoquinolines, such as atracurium, cisatracurium and mivacurium, and succinylcholine are unaffected by sugammadex. After injection of sugammadex, evidence suggests that binding of rocuronium to sugammadex in plasma leads to a marked decrease in free (unbound) rocuronium concentration, 153 leading to the establishment of a concentration gradient of rocuronium between the neuromuscular junction and plasma. This favors movement of rocuronium from neuromuscular junction to plasma, producing less neuromuscular block. Vecuronium has less affinity for sugammadex than rocuronium does, and pancuronium has less still. Sugammadex could also be used in the case of a failed intubation. If rocuronium 0. 6 mg/kg was given, sugammadex 8 mg/kg might be effective as early as 3 minutes after rocuronium injection, and if the dose of rocuronium is doubled to 1. 2 mg/ kg, one might need 16 mg/kg of sugammadex. The availability of sugammadex might make succinylcholine obsolete for intubation.",

LOCAL ANESTHETICSInterfere with the excitation process in a nerve membrane in one or more of the following ways: Altering the basic resting potential of the nerve membrane. Altering the threshold potential (firing level). Decreasing the rate of depolarization. Prolonging the rate of repolarization. LA's are weak bases carrying a positive charge at the tertiary amine group at physiological pH. MOA: Blocks voltage gated Na+ channels from inside of cell membrane by binding to a-subunit. Nerve block produced by local anesthetics is called a nondepolarizing nerve block. LA's are weak bases; they act by penetrating the axonal membrane in the unionized form.
