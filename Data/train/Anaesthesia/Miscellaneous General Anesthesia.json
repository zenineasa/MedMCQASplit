Lower blood gas coefficient of Xenon results in rapid induction and recovery. Xenon Anesthesia* Xenon was isolated by William Ramsay (Nobel prize for chemistry ) in 1904 and 1st used as anesthetic in 1950.* It is one of the noble gases (colourless, odurless, nonirritating, non-flammable, does not support combustion and non-explosive gas)* Heavier than air (4 times) and more viscous than N2 and N2O.* Being extremely unreactive. it does not interact with soda lime, but will diffuse readily through rubber.* Except for cost, xenon would be the most ideal inhaled anesthetic agent because Xenon (MAC of 71%) is more potent than nitrous oxide, can provide anesthesia in 30% O2 is very insoluble (blood-gas partition coefficienct of 0. 14) and has positive medical and environmental effects. Characteristic Features of Xenon Anaesthesia* Minimal cardiovascular and hemodynamic side effects* Not known to be metabolized in liver or kidney* Not teratogenic and does not trigger malignant hyperthermia* Neuroprotective and cardioprotective0* Emergence from xenon anesthesia is faster* Xenon is more potent than nitrous oxide with MAC 71%* It is a good analgesic* Blood-gas solubility coefficient of less than one third of N2O, there is still the potential of diffusion hypoxia during recovery.* Lower blood gas coefficient of Xenon results in rapid induction and recovery* It provides good hemodynamic stability with little change in blood pressure.* It inhibits calcium pump in plasma membrane0 and NMDA receptor in dorsal bom neuron. Advantages of Xenon Anesthesia. Disadvantages of Xenon Anesthesia* Inert, non-explosive, environment friendly* Low blood solubility* Not metabolized in the body* Rapid induction and recovery* Eliminated via lungs (can be used in renal and hepatic failure)* Does not trigger malignant hyperthermia* High cost* Less potent* No commercially available anesthesia equipment",

Sudden stoppage can lead to Diffusion Hypoxia). Shou 1 d always be tapered slowly by giving 100% oxygen). Metabolism. It is not metabolized in human body. It is excreted unchanged in lungs. Small amount is excreted v ia skin (Percutaneous excretion). Impurities in N20 cylinder can cause severe laryngospasm. methhemoglobinemia & Pulmonary edema. Systemic Actions. CVS: It does not depress the myocardium in vivo, so it can be safely used in patients with cardiac disease and shock. CNS: It increases cerebral metabolic rate and raises intra cranial tension. RS: It causes tachypnea and decrease tidal volume, maintaining minute volume. Ventilatory response to hypoxia is blunted. No significant effect on Liver and Kidneys. Side Effects. Hematological: li inactivates vitamin B12 (If used for >6 hours) - defective folate metabolism - Bone marrow depression - Aplastic anemia and Megaloblastic anemia. CNS: Vitamin B 12 deficiency can cause Demy el i nation of spinal cord (Subacute degeneration of spinal cord) especially involving posterior columns and lateral spinothalamic tracts.

        "exp": "Ans. b. Bispectral index monitoring (Ref: Morgan 4/144-146; Lee's 12/e p146, 286, 447). Use of the bispectral index (BIS), developed front a processed electroencephalogram, has been reported to decrease the incidence of anesthesia awareness when the BIS value is maintained below 60. Bispectral Index Scale (BIS). It is based on the principle of EEGQBispectral imaging analyses EEC date and quantitate anesthetic effects on the brain, specifically the hypnotic component. It is a composite numerical index, which represents a dimensionless numerical value that has been correlated with the patient's current hypnotic state or depth of anaesthesia and provides some assurance that paralyzed (anesthetized) patient is also asleep (unaware). BIS analysis may reduce chances of patient awareness during anesthesia. It may also reduce resource utilization because lesser drug is required to ensure amnesia, facilitating a faster wake up time and a shorter stay in recovery room. The BIS number decreases with increasing hypnosis. The BIS is derived from complex EEG analysis incorporating weighted information derived from the degree of burst suppression, spectral (b band) power and the bispectrum coherence. To make the EEG signals easier to interpret it uses 2 principles which are, which are, spectral analysis (power) and fast fourier analysis. It uses 3 EEG electrodes placed on frontal, parietal and temporal lobes. QBIS is used to monitor: Intraoperative aw arenessQ. Depth of anesthesia.

By varying the concentration volume and type of gas used, bubbles can be produced that will last upto 70 days before being completely absorbed. If nitrous oxide is administered during this time the bubble will rapidly expand with the risk of retinal and optic nerve ischemia. Nitrous oxide and middle ear surgeries. Middle ear cavity is connected to eustachian tube. When nitrous oxide is inhaled in large quantities N2O replaces the N2 in the middle air cavity thereby increasing the pressure in the cavity. After discontinuation of N2O the gas is rapidly reabsorbed from the cavity thus creating negative pressure in the cavity this may cause: -Serous otitis media. Disarticulation of stapes. Impaired hearing. N2O anaesthesia is hazardous to hearing in patients who have previously undergone reconstructive middle ear surgery. Micro laryngeal surgery. CO2 and (Nd: YAG) lasers are frequently used for microsurgery on the upper airway and trachea. Lasers can ignite materials used in anaesthesia.

It it is defined as the concentration of the vapour in the lungs that is needed to prevent movement (motor response) in 50% of subjects in response to surgical (pain) stimulus. A lower MAC value represents a more potent volatile anesthetic. Meyer-Overton hypothesis. The MAC of a volatile substance is inversely proportional to its lipid solubility (oil: gas coefficient)MAC is inversely related to potency i. e. high mac equals low potency. The hypothesis correlates lipid solubility of an anaesthetic agent with potency (1/MAC) and suggests that onset of anaesthesia occurs when sufficient molecules of the anaesthetic agent have dissolved in the cell's lipid membranes, resulting in anaesthesia. Common MAC values. Nitrous oxide - 104. Xenon -72. Desflurane - 6. Ethyl Ether - 3. 2. Sevo flu rune - 2. Enflurune - 1. 7. Isoflurane - 1. 2. Halothane - U. 75.

Commonly in the induction of general anesthesia. Its use has been largely replaced with that of propofol. Following intravenous injection the drug rapidly reaches the brain and causes unconsciousness within 15 seconds. At one minute, the drug attains a peak concentration of about 60% of the total dose in the brain. Thereafter, the drug distributes to the rest of the body and in about 5-10 minutes the concentration is low enough in the brain such that consciousness returns. Causes hypotension and tachycardia. Precipitates acute intermittantporphyria, hence contraindicated in Porphyrias. Accidental Intra-arterial injection causes severe pain & gangrene. Can trigger Malignant Hyperthermia.

So when N2O is discontinued after prolonged anaesthesia, due to its low blood solubility it rapidly diffuses into the alveoli and dilutes the alveolar air. This causes excess of N2O in alveoli so the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli is reduced. This results in hypoxia and it is known as diffusion hypoxia. If the cardiac reserve is normal diffusion hypoxia is not of much significance but if cardiac reserve is low, diffusion hypoxia can be very dangerous. Prevention: -It can be prevented by continuing 100% 02 inhalation for a few minutes after discontinuing N2.

        "question": "Regarding thiopentone all are true except",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e. Induction agent of choice in shock Thiopentone is a short acting barbiturate used in the induction of anaesthesia. Anaesthetic barbiturates are derivatives of Barbituric acid with an oxygen or sulfur at 2 position. The three barbiturates commonly used for clinical anaesthesia are: Sodium thiopental. Thiamylal. Methohexital. Thiopentone is supplied as powder containing the sodium salts with 6% sodium carbonate. The addition of sodium carbonate to the powder makes it water soluble. It prevents it from precipitating. Thiopentone is used for the induction of anaesthesia because it has a very rapid onset of action. The typical induction dose (3-5 mg/kg) of thiopentone produces unconsciousness in 10-30 seconds with a peak effect in 1 minutes and duration of anaesthesia of 5-8 minutes. Action of this drug terminates quickly because of rapid redistribution. Thiopentone is highly lipid soluble, therefore its redistribution is very rapid and this accounts for its short duration of action. Sulphur is added to increase the lipid solubility of thiopentone. Thiopentone is given intravenously. It produces little to no pain on injection. Venoirritation can be reduced by injection into larger non hand veins and by prior intravenous injection of lidocaine. If sometimes thiopentone inadvertently enter intraarterial circulation it causes severe inflammatory and potentially necrotic reaction. Effects on systemC. N. S. Besides producing a general anaesthesia, barbiturates reduce the cerebral metabolic rate, as measured by cerebral oxygen consumption (CMR02) in a dose dependent manner. As a consequence of the decrease in (CMR02) cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure are similarly reduced. Because it markedly lowers cerebral metabolism, thiopentone has been used as a protectant against cerebral ischemia. Thiopentone also reduces intraocular pressure. Presumably in part due to their CNS depressant activity barbiturates are effective anticonvulsants. Thiopentone in particular is a proven medication in the t/t of status epilepticus. Respiratory. Thiopentone is respiratory depressants. It causes dose dependent decrease in minute ventilation and tidal volume with a smaller and inconsistent decrease in respiratory rate. Thiopentone in cardiovascular system * Thiopentone produces dose dependent decrease in blood pressure. The effect is primarily due to vasodilation, particularly venodilation and to a lesser degree to direct decrease in cardiac contractility. Hypotension can be severe in patients with impaired ability to compensate for venodilation such as those with hypovolemia, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, cardiac tamponade and b adrenergic block.* Intravenous anaesthesia of choice in shock is ketamine. Ketamine increases blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. These effects are mediated due to sympathomimetic activity of ketamine. Ketamine causes inhibition of both central and peripheral catecholamine reuptake. Ketamine has direct negative inotropic and vasodilatory activity but these effects usually are overwhelmed by sympathomimetic action. Adverse effects. Thiopentone has no clinically significant effect on hepatic, renal or endocrine systems. Thiopentone (Barbiturates) can induce fatal attacks of porphyria in patients with acute intermittent porphyria and are contraindicated in such patients.",

It is used as a carrier gas to other anesthetics. MAC is 104% (It is not possible to deliver, so not a complete anesthetic). Maximum concentration which can be given is 66%. A minimum of 33% of Oxygen has to be given (Otherwise can cause severe hypoxia). It is usually given as N20 66% and 02 33% mixture. Blood gas coefficient is 0. 47 making it agent w ith faster induction and recovery. Good analgesic. Not a muscle relaxant. When given with other inhalational agent, it increases the concentration of that agent (Second gas effect) and also its own concentration (Concentration effect). Sudden stoppage can lead to Diffusion Hypoxia (Should always be tapered slowly by giving 100% oxygen). Metabolism. It is not metabolized in human body. It is excreted unchanged in lungs. Small amount is excreted via skin (Percutaneous excretion). Impurities in N20 cylinder can cause severe laryngospasm, methhemoglobinemia and Pulmonary edema. Systemic Actions. CVS: It does not depress the myocardium in vivo, so it can be safely used in patients with cardiac disease and shock. CNS: It increases cerebral metabolic rate and raises intra cranial tension. RS: It causes tachypnea and decrease tidal volume, maintaining minute volume. Ventilatory response to hypoxia is blunted. No significant effect on Liver and Kidneys. Side Effects. Hematological: It inactivates vitamin B12 (If used for >6 hours) - defective folate metabolism - Bone marrow depression - Aplastic anemia and Megaloblastic anemia. CNS: Vitamin B 12 deficiency can cause Demyelination of spinal cord (Subacute degeneration of spinal cord) especially involving posterior columns and lateral spinothalamic tracts.
