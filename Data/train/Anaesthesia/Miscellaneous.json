The endocrine system reacts by releasing an excessive amount of hormones, ultimately resulting in carbohydrate, protein, and fat catabolism (destruction); poor glucose use; and other harmful effects. This reaction combined with inflammatory processes can produce weight loss, tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, fever, shock, and death.

        "exp": "The cause of malignant hypehermia is unknown, but it is associated with inhalational anesthetic agents and succinylcholine. It may develop in an otherwise healthy person who has tolerated previous surgery without incident. It should be suspected in the presence of a history of unexplained fever, muscle or connective tissue disorder, or a positive family history (evidence suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern). In addition to fever during anesthesia, the syndrome includes tachycardia, increased O2 consumption, increased CO2 production, increased serum K+, myoglobinuria, and acidosis. Rigidity rather than relaxation following succinylcholine injection may be the first clue to its presence. Treatment of malignant hypehermia should include prompt conclusion of the operative procedure and cessation of anesthesia, hyperventilation with 100% O2, and administration of intravenous dantrolene. The urine should be alkalinized to protect the kidneys from myoglobin precipitation. If reoperation is necessary, the physician should premedicate heavily, alkalinize the urine, and avoid depolarizing agents such as succinylcholine. Pretreatment for 24 hours with dantrolene is helpful; it is thought to act directly on muscle fiber to attenuate calcium release.",

        "exp": "Dopamine has a variety of pharmacologic characteristics that make it useful in critically ill patients. At all doses, the diastolic blood pressure can be expected to rise; since coronary perfusion is largely a result of the head of pressure at the coronary ostia, coronary blood flow should be increased. In low doses (1-5 mg/), dopamine affects primarily the dopaminergic receptors. Activation of these receptors causes vasodilation of the renal and mesenteric vasculature and mild vasoconstriction of the peripheral bed, which thereby redirects blood flow to kidneys and bowel. At these low doses, the net effect on the overall vascular resistance may be slight. As the dose rises (2-10 mg/), b1 -receptor activity predominates and the inotropic effect on the myocardium leads to increased cardiac output and blood pressure. Above 10 mg/(kg*min), a-receptor stimulation causes peripheral vasoconstriction, shifting of blood from extremities to organs, decreased kidney function, and hypertension.",

Heparin is much more frequently associated with spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage than are oral agents. Advanced patient age and poor regulation of coagulation times also increase the likelihood of bleeding complications. Most cases of retroperitoneal hemorrhage present with flank pain and signs of peritoneal irritation suggestive of an acute intra-abdominal process. CT scans are most useful in confirming the diagnosis and following the course of the bleeding. Successful management is usually nonoperative and consists of the discontinuation of anticoagulants, reversal of anticoagulation, possible transfusion of clotting factors, and repletion of intravascular volume with intravenous fluids. Warfarin inhibits synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, whereas heparin potentiates antithrombin III activity. Aprotinin is a protease inhibitor that decreases the inflammatory and fibrinolytic response and is used in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery to reduce bleeding complications.

Full control of the airway should be secured in the emergency room if the patient is unstable. Endotracheal intubation will usually be the method chosen, but the physician should be prepared to do a tracheotomy if attempts at perioral or perinasal intubation are failing or are impractical because of maxillofacial injuries. The most dangerous period is just prior to and during the initial attempts to get control of the airway. Manipulation of the oronasopharynx may provoke combative behavior or vomiting in a patient already confused by drugs, alcohol, hypoxia, or cerebral trauma. The risk of aspiration is high during these initial attempts, and the physician should make no assumptions about the state of the contents of the patient's stomach. Antacids are recommended just prior to the intubation attempt, if feasible. Although steroids have been recommended in the past, they are no longer considered of value in the management of aspiration of acidic gastric juice. The best management requires prevention of the complication of aspiration. In a reasonably cooperative patient, awake intubation with topical anesthesia may help to prevent some of the risks of hypotension, arrhythmia, and aspiration associated with the induction of anesthesia. If awake intubation is inappropriate, then an alternative is rapid-sequence induction with a thiobarbiturate followed by muscle paralysis with succinylcholine. If elevated intracranial pressure is suspected, or if a penetrating eye injury exists, awake intubation is contraindicated.",

Six hours later he develops ST segment depression, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) shows anterolateral ischemia. His hemodynamic parameters are as follows: systemic BP 70/40 mm Hg, pulse 100 beats per minute, CVP 18 mm Hg, PCWP 25 mm Hg, cardiac output 1. 5 L/min, and systemic vascular resistance 1000 (dyne * s)/cm5. Which of the following is the single best pharmacologic intervention for this patient?",
        "exp": "This patient has developed pump failure because of a combination of preexisting coronary aery occlusive disease and high preload following a fluid challenge; afterload remains moderately high as well because of systemic vasoconstriction in the presence of cardiogenic shock. Poor myocardial performance is reflected in the low cardiac output and high PCWP. Therapy must be directed at increasing cardiac output without creating too high a myocardial O2 demand on the already failing heart. Administration of nitroglycerin could be expected to reduce both preload and afterload, but, if given without an inotrope, it would create unacceptable hypotension. Nitroprusside similarly would achieve afterload reduction but would result in hypotension if not accompanied by an inotropic agent. A b-blocker would act deleteriously by reducing cardiac contractility and slowing the heart rate in a setting in which cardiac output is likely to be rate-dependent. Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine that is becoming the inotropic agent of choice in cardiogenic shock. As a b1 -adrenergic agonist, it improves cardiac performance in pump failure both by positive inotropy and peripheral vasodilation. With minimal chronotropic effect, dobutamine only marginally increases myocardial O2 demand.",

Primary cause of VAE is surgical procedures, especially neurosurgical procedures performed in the upright, sitting position. Anytime the operative site is more than 5 cm above the right atrium, VAE is a risk. Other surgical procedures that can lead to the infusion of air include obstetric/gynecologic procedures (cesarean section), craniofacial surgery, dental implant surgery, vascular procedures, liver transplantation, and orthopedic procedures (e. g., hip replacement, arthroscopy). The frequency of reported VAE in surgical procedures ranges from 10% in cervical laminectomy up to 80% in posterior fossa surgery. 2. Second cause of VAE is iatrogenic creation of a pressure gradient for air entry. Examples include spinal needles in lumbar punctures (case report), peripheral intravenous lines, central venous catheters, pulmonary artery catheters, hemodialysis catheters, and long-term (Hickman) catheters. Most cases occur during catheter manipulation, disconnection, or removal. A pressure difference of 5 cm of H2O across a 14-gauge needle allows 100 ml of air per second to enter the venous system. The frequency of reported VAE with central catheter use ranges from 1 in 47 to 1 in 3000. 3. A third cause of VAE is mechanical insufflation or infusion. Insufflation has been documented to occur during arthroscopic procedures, CO2 hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, urethral insufflation, and orogenital sexual activity during pregnancy. Infusion air entry can occur during the injection of contrast agents for CT scans, angiography, and cardiac catheterization, and during cardiac ablation procedures. 4. A fourth cause of VAE is positive-pressure ventilation, which can occur during mechanical ventilation and SCUBA diving. 5. Finally, blunt and penetrating trauma to the chest, abdomen, neck, and face can lead to the entry of air and ultimately to VAE",

        "exp": "Determination of CVP can be helpful in the overall hemodynamic assessment of the patient. This pressure can be affected by a variety of factors, including those of cardiac, noncardiac, and aifactual origin. Venous tone, right ventricular compliance, intrathoracic pressure, and blood volume all influence CVP. Vasoconstrictor drugs, positive-pressure ventilation (with and without PEEP), mediastinal compression, and hypervolemia all increase CVP. Acute pulmonary embolism, when clinically significant, elevates CVP by causing right ventricular overload and increased right atrial pressure. Sepsis, on the other hand, decreases CVP through both the release of vasodilatory mediators and the loss of intravascular plasma volume due to increased capillary permeability. Trends in CVP measurement are more reliable than isolated readings. CVP, along with other hemodynamic parameters, can also be useful in differentiating septic shock from other etiologies of shock; shock is inadequate tissue perfusion. Septic shock has two phases: (1) a hypodynamic phase that is characterized by hypovolemia and myocardial depression and (2) a hyperdynamic phase that follows fluid resuscitation and is characterized by a normal to increased cardiac output",

The tenets of resuscitation include intubation if hypoxic, fluid resuscitation to a central venous pressure target of 8 to 12 mm Hg if not intubated and infusion of vasopressors to maintain a mean aerial pressure of 65 mm Hg. Norepinephrine and dopamine are the vasopressors of choice; epinephrine vasoconstricts peripherally as well as increases cardiac contractility and is not a first-line agent for septic shock. Inotropes such as dobutamine have been used if oxygen delivery is low, but should not be used to push delivery to supranormal levels. Fuhermore, cultures should be drawn immediately and empiric antibiotics initiated; if there is a surgical source of sepsis, then operative intervention for source control should be promptly performed after initial resuscitative effos. Recombinant-activated protein C is indicated in patients with severe sepsis with a predicted high risk of moality (ie, older age, increased severity of disease); this patient does not have evidence of end-organ dysfunction such as acute renal or respiratory failure at this time.
