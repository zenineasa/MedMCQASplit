        "exp": "Volume - controlled ventilation, where the inflation volume is preselected, and the ventilator automatically adjusts the inflation pressure to deliver the desired volume. the rate of lung inflation can be constant or decelerating. Advantages of volume control ventilation Guaranteed tidal volumes produce a more stable minute volume. The reliability of the minute volume makes this mode of ventilation more appropriate in situations where careful control of Pa. CO2is of impoance. Volume controlled modes were the standard of care for patients with severe traumatic brain injury where tight Pa. CO2 control is necessary. The minute volume remains stable over a range of changing pulmonary characteristics. If airway resistance fluctuates significantly (eg. in the course of therapy for status asthmaticus) this mode has the advantage of maintaining a reliable minute volume. The initial flow rate is lower than in pressure-controlled modes. This is an advantage if airway resistance is high; blowing more slowly into the tight bronchi does not produce a high resistance-related early pressure peak, and potentially prevents an early termination of the breath by the pressure alarm limit. Disadvantages of volume control ventilation The mean airway pressure is lower with volume control ventilation, due to the slopy shape of the pressure waveform. This can theoretically be a disadvantage in patients who have severe hypoxia; in those people one might want to use a pressure-controlled mode instead. One wa of getting around this is to use an inspiratory pause, which is discussed elsewhere (in summary, it doesn't work and possibly increases the work of breathing). Recruitment may be poorer in lung units with poor compliance. Units with a long time constant and poor compliance may remain unrecruited until very late in the inspiratory phase when pressure approaches its maximum value. These units will have little time for gas exchange before the ventilator cycles to expiration. From this, one might expect that with a volume-controlled mode the degree of atelectasis will be greater than with a pressure controlled mode, peak aiway pressures being equal. In the presence of a leak, the mean airway pressure may be unstable. The constant flow used during VCV may not be able to compensate for an intermittent leak. Consider: if the leak flow rate is equal to the inspiratory flow rate, there will be no volume delivered. Insufficient flow may give rise to patient-ventilatordyssynchrony. In the presence of increased respiratory demand during the course of a breath, the ventilator may not meet the patient's need for increased flow.",

        "exp": "VENTILATORY STRATEGIES in ARDS Low-Tidal-Volume Ventilation The cornerstone of ARDS management is a strategy of low-tidal-volume ventilation pioneered by the ARDSnet trial in 2000. This involves the following: \u0002 Tidal volume 6 ml/kg based on ideal body weight \u0002 Plateau pressure, 30 cm H2O \u0002 Permissive hypercapnoea tolerated as long as pH. 7. 2 The lower tidal volumes were strongly associated with a decrease in moality and an increase in ventilator-free days. This was thought to be as a result of reducing excessive distension or stretch of the aerated lung, which could be associated with the release of proinflammatory cytokines that could contribute to lung (volutrauma) and other organ injury. Positive End-Expiratory Pressure PEEP prevents alveolar derecruitment, minimising atelectrauma. It increases functional residual capacity, displaces fluid from the alveoli into the interstitium, and moves the lung to the steeper pa of the compliance curve. However, this has to be balanced against potential hyperinflation and decreased venous return, and thus cardiac output. PEEP is patient-specific and determining the ''optimal'' PEEP for each patient is challenging. A number of different strategies (none of which have proven superiority) have been suggested to set PEEP: \u0002 Use of PEEP/Fi. O2 tables \u0002 Titrating based on plateau pressure \u0002 Stepwise increase until maximal compliance \u0002 Recruitment manoeuvre followed by decremental titration \u0002 Based upon the inflection point of the pressure/volume curve Guidelines recommend use of high PEEP (defined variably, but on average 15 cm H2O) on patients with moderate and severe ARDS, in whom a moality benefit was demonstrated in clinical trials. Prone-Position Ventilation. Although this has long been known to improve oxygenation, evidence of moality benefit has been lacking until recently.

        "exp": "Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) refers to the administration of ventilatory suppo without using an invasive aificial airway (endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube). The use of noninvasive ventilation (see the video below) has markedly increased over the past two decades, and noninvasive ventilation has now become an integral tool in the management of both acute and chronic respiratory failure, in both the home setting and in the critical care unit. Noninvasive ventilation has been used as a replacement for invasive ventilation, and its flexibility also allows it to be a valuable complement in patient management. Its use in acute respiratory failure is well accepted and widespread. It is the focus of this review. The role of noninvasive ventilation in those with chronic respiratory failure is not as clear and remains to be defined. The key to the successful application of noninvasive ventilation is in recognizing its capabilities and limitations. This also requires identification of the appropriate patient for the application of noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Patient selection is crucial for the successful application of noninvasive ventilation. Once patients who require immediate intubation are eliminated, a careful assessment of the patient and his or her condition determines if the patient is a candidate for noninvasive ventilation. This requires evaluation on several levels, and it may involve a trial of noninvasive ventilation. The following variables and factors help identify patients who may be candidates for noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Absolute contraindications are as follows: Coma Cardiac arrest Respiratory arrest Any condition requiring immediate intubation Other contraindications (rare exceptions) are as follows: Cardiac instability - Shock and need for pressor suppo, ventricular dysrhythmias, complicated acute myocardial infarction GI bleeding - Intractable emesis and/or uncontrollable bleeding Inability to protect airway - Impaired cough or swallowing, poor clearance of secretions, depressed sensorium and lethargy Status epilepticus Potential for upper airway obstruction - Extensive head and neck tumors, any other tumor with extrinsic airway compression, angioedema or anaphylaxis causing airway compromise Other considerations that may limit application are as follows: Implementation - Staff learning curve and time requirements (nursing and respiratory therapy), potential for delay in definitive therapy (limit trials of therapy) After eliminating unsuitable candidates for noninvasive ventilation, successful application of noninvasive ventilation mandates close assessment and selection of patients and identification of conditions best suited for treatment.

        "exp": "Positive end expiratory pressure decreases venous return and decreases cardiac output and hence blood pressure decreases and decreased perfusion so urine output can reduce. Pulmonary barotrauma is a frequentcomplicationof. PEEPtherapy. Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and interstitial emphysema may lead to rapid deterioration of a patient maintained on mechanical ventilation with an already compromised respiratory status. Positive end-expiratory pressure PEEP is a mode of therapy used in conjunction with mechanical ventilation. At the end of mechanical or spontaneous exhalation, PEEP maintains the patient's airway pressure above the atmospheric level by exeing pressure that opposes passive emptying of the lung. This pressure is typically achieved by maintaining a positive pressure flow at the end of exhalation. This pressure is measured in centimeters of water. PEEP therapy can be effective when used in patients with a diffuse lung disease that results in an acute decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the volume of gas that remains in the lung at the end of a normal expiration. FRC is determined by primarily the elastic characteristics of the lung and chest wall. In many pulmonary diseases, FRC is reduced because of the collapse of the unstable alveoli. This reduction in lung volume decreases the surface area available for gas exchange and results in intrapulmonary shunting (unoxygenated blood returning to the left side of the hea). If FRC is not restored, a high concentration of inspired oxygen may be required to maintain the aerial oxygen content of the blood in an acceptable range. Applying PEEP increases alveolar pressure and alveolar volume. The increased lung volume increases the surface area by reopening and stabilizing collapsed or unstable alveoli. This splinting, or propping open, of the alveoli with positive pressure improves the ventilation-perfusion match, reducing the shunt effect. After a true shunt is modified to a ventilation-perfusion mismatch with PEEP, lowered concentrations of oxygen can be used to maintain an adequate Pa. O2. PEEP therapy may also be effective in improving lung compliance. When FRC and lung compliance are decreased, additional energy and volume are required to inflate the lung. By applying PEEP, the lung volume at the end of exhalation is increased. The already paially inflated lung requires less volume and energy than before for full inflation. When used to treat patients with a diffuse lung disease, PEEP should improve compliance, decrease dead space, and decrease the intrapulmonary shunt effect. The most impoant benefit of the use of PEEP is that it enables the patient to maintain an adequate Pa. O2 at a low and safe concentration of oxygen (< 60%), reducing the risk of oxygen toxicity. Because PEEP is not a benign mode of therapy and because it can lead to serious hemodynamic consequences, the ventilator operator should have a definite indication to use it. The addition of external PEEP is typically justified when a Pa. O2 of 60 mm Hg cannot be achieved with an FIO2 of 60% or if the estimated initial shunt fraction is greater than 25%. No evidence suppos adding external PEEP during initial setup of the ventilator to satisfy misguided attempts to supply prophylactic PEEP or physiologic PEEP.",
