        "exp": "Central chemoreceptors are situated in the deeper pa of medulla oblongata, close to the dorsal respiratory group of neurons. This area is known as a chemosensitive area, and the neurons are called chemoreceptors. Chemoreceptors are in close contact with blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Central chemoreceptors are connected with respiratory centers, paicularly the dorsal respiratory group of neurons through synapses. These chemoreceptors act slowly but effectively. Central chemoreceptors are responsible for 70% to 80% of increased ventilation through chemical regulatory mechanisms. Main stimulant for central chemoreceptors is the increased hydrogen ion concentration. However, if hydrogen ion concentration increases in the blood, it cannot stimulate the central chemoreceptors because the hydrogen ions from blood cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. On the other hand, if carbon dioxide increases in the blood, it can easily cross the blood-brain barrier and bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier and enter the interstitial fluid of the brain or the cerebrospinal fluid. There, carbon dioxide combines with water to form carbonic acid. Since carbonic acid is unstable, it immediately dissociates into hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion. CO2 + H2O - H2. CO3 - H+ + HCO3- Hydrogen ions stimulate the central chemoreceptors. From chemoreceptors, the excitatory impulses are sent to the dorsal respiratory group of neurons, resulting in increased ventilation (increased rate and force of breathing). Because of this, excess carbon dioxide is washed out and respiration is brought back to normal. Lack of oxygen does not have a significant effect on the central chemoreceptors, except that it generally depresses the overall function of the brain. Ref: Sembulingam - physiology 7th edition",

        "question": "Local anaesthetic acts by inhibition of",
        "exp": "The nerve resting membrane potential is little affected by local anesthetics. As the concentration of local anesthetic applied to the nerve is increased, a decrease in the rate of depolarization and in the peak amplitude of the action potential occurs until the impulse is abolished. It is not possible, however, to derive data on the binding of local anesthetics to Na+ channels from measurement of the changes in nerve impulses. By using a \"voltage-clamp\" procedure, Na+ currents and their inhibition by local anesthetics can be directly assayed. When the membrane of isolated neurons is rapidly depolarized to a constant value, the time course of ionic currents is observed. Sodium currents during one initial depolarization are reduced by subclinical doses of local anesthetic (e. g., 0. 2mM lidocaine) and totally abolished by clinical doses (e. g., 1% lidocaine, [?]40mM). If the test depolarization is applied repeatedly, for example, at frequencies higher than 5. Hz (five pulses per second), the paially depressed (tonically inhibited) Na+ current is fuher reduced incrementally for each pulse until a new steady-state level of inhibition is reached. This frequency-dependent inhibition, also called phasic inhibition. Local anesthetics bind in the inner vestibule of the closed Na+ channel. Amino acid mutations in the S6 segments of D-1, D-3, and D-4 all modify local anesthetic action, thus suggesting either that these regions form a pharmacophore small enough to simultaneously contact the drug at three surfaces or that the local anesthetic molecule moves rapidly among these three segments.

The current opinion allows clear liquids until 2 h before the induction of anesthesia. According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guideline, breast milk is permitted up to 4 h before anesthesia.

        "question": "In clinical anaesthesia, which nerve is the most popular site, and commonly used for monitoring neuromuscular response during anaesthesia & in intensive care units?",
        "exp": "(A) Ulnar nerve[Miller's Anaesthesia6-1557, 1559, 1559f)[?]. Neuromuscular function is monitored by evaluating the muscular response to Supramaximal Stimulation of a Peripheral Motor Nerve. Two types of stimulation can be used: 1. Electrical & 2. Magnetic. Electrical nerve stimulation is by far the most commonly used method in clinical practice. [?]. Patterns of Nerve Stimulation: For evaluation of neuromuscular function, the most commonly used patterns of electrical nerve stimulation are Single-Twitch, TOF, Tetanic, Post-Tetanic Count (PTC), & Double-Burst Stimulation (DBS). Advantages of Train-of-Four (TOF) stimulation are greatest during nondepolarizing blockade because the degree of block can be read directly from the TOF response even though a preoperative value is lacking. TOF stimulation has some advantages over tetanic stimulation: It is less painful &, unlike tetanic stimulation, doesnot generally affect the degree of neuromuscular blockade. Sites of Nerve Stimulation & Different Muscle Responses: Any superficially located peripheral motor nerve may be stimulated. In clinical anesthesia, the ulnar nerve is the most popular site. Median, posterior tibial, common peroneal, & facial nerves are also sometimes used. For stimulation of the ulnar nerve, the electrodes are best applied to the volar side of the wrist. Distal electrode should be placed about 1 cm proximal to the point at which the proximal flexion crease of the wrist crosses the radial side of the tendon to the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. Proximal electrode should preferably be placed so that the distance between the centers of the two electrodes is 3 to 6 cm. Electrical stimulation normally elicits only finger flexion & thumb adduction. If one electrode is placed over the ulnar groove at the elbow, thumb adduction is often pronounced because of stimulation of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. Ulnar groove placement of electrodes (sometimes preferred in small children) is used, the active negative electrode should be at the wrist to ensure maximal response. Polarity of the electrodes is less crucial, placement of the negative electrode distally normally elicits the greatest neuromuscular response. Because different muscle groups have different sensitivities to neuromuscular blocking agents, results obtained for one muscle cannot be automatically extrapolated to other muscles. Diaphragm is among the most resistant of all muscles to both depolarizing and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs. Clinical significance is that onset time is normally shorter for the diaphragm than for the adductor pollicis muscle and the diaphragm recovers from paralysis more quickly than the peripheral muscles do. Other respiratory muscles are less resistant than the diaphragm, as are the larynx & the corrugator supercilii muscles. Most sensitive are the abdominal muscles, the orbicularis oculi muscle, the peripheral muscles of the limbs, & the geniohyoid, masseter, & upper airway muscles. From a practical clinical point of view, it is worth noting that: Response of the corrugator supercilii to facial nerve stimulation reflects the extent of neuromuscular blockade of the laryngeal adductor muscles & abdominal muscles better than the response of the adductor pollicis to ulnar nerve stimulation does. Upper airway muscles seem to be more sensitive than the peripheral muscles. Although three investigations using acceleromyography have indicated small differences in the response to TOF nerve stimulation in the arm (adductor pollicis muscle) & the leg (flexor hallucis brevis muscle), these differences are probably of little clinical significance. Remember: In assessing neuromuscular function, use of a relatively sensitive muscle such as the adductor pollicis of the hand has both disadvantages & advantages. During surgery it is a disadvantage that even total elimination of the response to single-twitch & TOF stimulation does not exclude the possibility of movement of the diaphragm, such as hiccuping & coughing.",

        "question": "High airway resistance is seen in",
        "exp": "Resistance impedes airflow into (and out of) the lung. The major component of resistance is the resistance exeed by the airways (large and small), and a minor component is the sliding of the lung and the chest wall tissue elements during inspiration (and expiration). Resistance is overcome by (driving) pressure. In spontaneous breathing, Resistance (R) is calculated as driving pressure (DP) divided by the resultant gas flow (F): R = DP/F The value of airway resistance is approximately 1 cm H2O/L/sec, and is higher in obstructive lung disease (e. g., COPD, asthma); in severe asthma, it is elevated approximately tenfold. The presence of an endotracheal tube adds a resistance of 5 (or 8) cm H2O/L/min for a tube with an internal diameter of size 8 (or 7) cm. For any tube for which the airflow is laminar (smooth, streamlined), the resistance increases in direct propoion to the tube length and increases dramatically (to the fouh power) as the diameter of the tube is reduced. Two factors explain why most (approximately 80%) of the impedance to gas flow occurs in the large airways. First, as bronchi progressively branch, the resistances are arranged in parallel and the total cross-sectional area at the level of the terminal bronchioles adds up to almost tenfold that at the trachea. Second, in tubes that are large, irregular or branched, the flow is often turbulent, not laminar. When flow is laminar: F(lam) = DP/R In contrast, when the flow is turbulent: F(turb) = DP/R2 Therefore, for a given radius, far more pressure is required to achieve comparable flow where the flow is turbulent; thus, the effo required is greater, and if prolonged or severe, respiratory failure is more likely.

        "exp": "The first modern halogenated volatile anesthetic, halothane, was introduced in 1955. Clinical exposure to halothane is associated with two distinct types of hepatic injury. Subclinical hepatotoxicity occurs in 20% of adults who receive halothane. It is characterized by mild postoperative elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspaate aminotransferase, but is reversible and innocuous. Anaerobic halothane reduction by CYP2. A6 to a 2-chloro-1, 1, 1-trifluoroethyl radical is thought to mediate this mild hepatic injury. The fulminant form of hepatotoxicity, commonly known as halothane hepatitis, is characterized by elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspaate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels, massive hepatic necrosis following the administration of halothane. Halothane hepatitis is rare (1 in 5000 to 35, 000 administrations in adults), but is fatal in 50% to 75% of these cases. Because of the potential for fatal hepatitis, halothane is no longer used in adult patients in many countries. Halothane hepatitis is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction associated with the oxidative metabolism of halothane. The highly reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride metabolite of halothane oxidation can react with nearby liver proteins. In most patients who developed hepatic necrosis after halothane anesthesia, antibodies against TFA-modified proteins were detected, suggesting that the hepatic damage is linked to an immune response against the modified protein, which acts as a neoantigen. Accordingly, patients who develop halothane hepatitis often have a history of prior exposures to halothane or other volatile anesthetics, together with symptoms suggestive of immune reactivity, such as fever, rash, ahralgia, and eosinophilia. A current hypothesis is that TFA-protein adducts induce a cytotoxic T cell reaction in sensitized individuals, which leads to liver damage. However, the immune responses observed in halothane hepatitis might not mediate liver injury. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",
