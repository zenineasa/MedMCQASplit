        "exp": "Ans. c. Etomidate (Ref: Morgan 4/e p167, 194, 199)A 32-year -old male with no past medical history is brought to the emergency department after being injured in a bomb blast. On examination he is suspected to have a splenic injury and is supposed to undergo an emergency laparotomy. The ideal anaesthetic agent of choice would be etomidate, as it has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system.\"Abdominal trauma patient especially with splenic injury are at high risk of hypotension, etomidate is agent of choice as it has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system.\"\"Etomidate has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system. A mild reduction in peripheral vascular resistance is responsible for a slight decline in arterial blood pressure. Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate does not release histamine.\"\"Opioids: In general, opioids do not seriously impair cardiovascular function. Meperidine tends to increase heart rate (it is structurally similar to atropine). Ramifentanyl, and alfentanyl are associated with vagus-mediated bradycardia With the exception of meperidine, the opioids do not depress cardiac contractility. Nonetheless, arterial blood pressure often falls as a result of bradycardia, venodilation, and decreased sympathetic reflexes, sometimes requiring vasopressor (eg., ephedrine) support. Meperidine and morphine evoke histamine release in some individuals that can lead to profound drops in systemic vascular resistance and arterial blood pressure.\"\"Halothane: A dose-dependent reduction of arterial blood pressure is due to direct myocardial depression. 2.0 MAC of halothane results in a 50% decrease in blood pressure and cardiac output.\"EtomidateEtomidate is a carboxylated imidazole compound that is a selective positive allosteric modulator at GABA-A receptorQUnlike thiopental does not appear to affect other pentameric ion channels.It is structurally unrelated to other agents.Mechanism of Action:Selective positive allosteric modulator at GABA-A receptorQPharmacokinetics:It is rapidly acting general anesthetic agent with a short duration of action (2-3 min), resulting predominantly from redistribution, although it is also eliminated rapidly from bodyQ.Characteristic Features:It is characterized by hemodynamic stability, minimal respiratory depression and cerebroprotective effectQ.It is a sedative hypnotic but lacks analgesic propertiesQAs with thiopental, cerebral blood flow and metabolism, intracranial and intraocular pressure all fall with etomidateQAs with methohexital, excitatory phenomenon (on induction) may be seen which can be prevented by benzodiazepine premedication or concomitant use of opioid.Central sympathetic out flow is stimulated, which maintains hemodynamics. Because of minimal cardiovascular effect, CPP is well maintained.It enhances somatosensory evoked potentials on EEG.Side-Effects:It causes adrenocortical suppressionQ by inhibiting enzymes 11-beta hydroxylase (mainly) and 17-alpha hydroxylase involved in cortisol and aldosterone (mineralocorticoid) productionQ. Vitamin C supplementation restores cortisol level.Excitatory phenomenon causing myoclonus, hiccups and other involuntary movements (40%); emergence phenomenon causing restlessness and delirium during recoveryQHigh incidence of nausea and vomiting (highest among all IV anesthetics i.e. ~40%)Pain on injection; Vitamin C deficiency; ThrombophlebitisQ",

        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Oculocardiac reflexREF: Miller's Anaesthesiology 7th Ed Ch 75OCULOCARDIAC REFLEXThe oculocardiac reflex was first described by Aschner and Dagnini in 1908.Traction on the extraocular muscles or pressure on the globe causes bradycardia, atrioventricular block, ventricular ectopy, or asystole. It is especially seen with traction on the medial rectus muscle, but can occur with stimulation of any of the orbital contents, including the periosteum.The reflex is trigeminovagal. The afferent limb is from orbital contents to ciliary ganglion to ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve to the sensory nucleus of the trigeminal near the fourth ventricle. The efferent limb is via the vagus nerve to the heart.The reflex maybe seen more often with procedures under topical anesthesia. Retrobulbar block is not uniformly effective, however, at preventing the reflex. Orbital injections can trigger the response. The response is exacerbated by hypercapnia or hypoxemia.In the event of arrhythmia, the anesthesiologist first should ask the surgeon to stop manipulations. The ventilatory status is assessed. If significant bradycardia persists or recurs, intravenous atropine is administered in 7 ug/kg increments. Rarely, severe bradycardia or asystole occurs. Although chest compressions might be required to allow the atropine to circulate, usually the heart rhythm returns to normal isnth cessation of manipulation alone. The response fatigues with repeated stimulation.Pretreatment with intravenous atropineorglycopyrrolatecanbeeffective. Pretreatment may be indicated in patients with a history of conduction block, vasovagal responses, or b-blocker therapy",

The consequence of decreased venous return and decreased systemic vascular resistance as a result of these procedures would be hazardous to the patientGeneral anaesthesia is the preferred technique for performing ceasarean section in a patient with coarctation of Aorta as it has the advantage ofmore rapid inductionless hypotensionbetter airway and ventilation.Here are the quoted lines from an internet site further supporting our answerUncorrected coarctation is rare in pregnancy but when present tends to be exacerbated by normal physiologic changes with fixed aortic outflow obstruction and distal hypoperfusion. These patients are at increased risk of left ventricular failure, aortic dissection and rupture, endocarditis and cerebrovascular accident. Anesthetic goals should center on maintaining normal to slightly elevated SVR and heart rate and adequate preload. Regional anesthesia is relatively contraindicated. General anesthesia is the preferred technique for cesarean section with invasive hemodynamic monitoring with post ductal intraarterial catheter, CVP or PA catheters to guide fluid administration and to assess left ventricular function and use of ephedrine and dopamine as vasopressors of choice.",

Page 97Explanation:BRONCHOSPASM DURING ANESTHESIALight anaesthesia in asthmatics can induce bronchospasni.Secretions and noxious stimuli can also induce bronchospasni.Treatment:Good depth of anesthesia.Bronchodilators.Light anaesthesia during Lord's (Anal) stretching and cervical dilatation can initiate parasympathetic overactivity causing laryngospasm, broncho- spasm, bradycardia and cardiac arrest. This is called Breur Lockhgard reflex.The most common cause of asthmatic attack during surgery is inadequate depth of anesthesia. What to be done during an asthmatic attack during anaesthesia?First, deepen die level of anesthesia.Increase Fi02.Patient is under anesthesia and undergoing surgery, so medical interventions such as beta agonist administration is not the first choice of treatment.When the level of anaesthesia is light, the patient may develop bucking, straining or coughing as a result of endotracheal tube in the trachea and then hronchospasm.Other Methods:IV Ketamine: Increases BP, deepens anaesthesia, causes bronchodilation.Beta agoinst nebulization: Causes bronchodilation.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Halothane * Among given options halothane is the best answer as other agents are relatively safe in hepatic dysfunction. But it should be kept in mind that pre-existing liver disease and jaundice is not a contraindication to halothane. Unexplained liver dysfunction and jaundice to previous exposure of Halothane is a contraindication. Though not a contraindication, Halothane should be avoided in liver disease, if possible.Important facts hapatotoxicty of anesthetics* All inhalational agent cause mild hapatotoxicty by decreasing hepatic blood flow. Direct hapatotoxicty (Hepatitis, Hepatic necrosis) is caused by Halothane, Trichloroethylene, Chloroform, Carbon tetrachloride and methoxyflurane.* Isoflurane is the agent of choice in liver disease as it has least effect on Hepatic blood flow.* If the patient of halothane hepatitis has to undergo surgery, then the inhalational agent of choice is sevoflurane.",
