        "exp": "APRV - Airway Pressure Release Ventilation Mode of mechanical ventilation that is less common than pressure control or volume control, APRV was described initially by Stock and Downs in 1987 as a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with an intermittent release phase. APRV applies CPAP (P high) for a prolonged time (T high) to maintain adequate lung volume and alveolar recruitment, with a time-cycled release phase to a lower set of pressure (P low) for a sho period of time (T low) or (release time) where most of ventilation and CO2 removal occurs Using high-flow (demand valve) CPAP circuit, unrestricted spontaneous breathing can be integrated and can happen any time regardless of the ventilator cycle. If the patient has no spontaneous respiratory effo, APRV becomes typical to 'inverse ratio pressure'-limited, 'time cycle'-assisted mechanical ventilation (pressure-controlled ventilation).",
