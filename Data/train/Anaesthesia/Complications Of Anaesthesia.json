MH may occasionally present more than an hour after emergence from an anesthetic, and rarely may occur without exposure to known triggering agents. Most cases have been repoed in young males; almost none have been repoed in infants, and few have been repoed in the elderly. Neveheless, all ages and both sexes may be affected. The incidence of MH varies significantly from country to country and even among different geographic localities within the same country, reflecting varying gene pools. The upper Midwest appears to have the greatest incidence of MH in the United States. Anesthetic drugs that trigger MH include ether, halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, and depolarizing muscle relaxants, succinylcholine being the only anesthetic drug currently used. Desflurane and sevoflurane appear to be less potent triggers than halothane and produce a more gradual onset of MH. The onset may be explosive if succinylcholine is used.

Explanation:\"A complete history and physical examination is essential before anaesthetizing these children. \"\"In the absence of a precise diagnosis, children presenting with an undiagnosed neuromusculardisease should not have elective surgery or anaesthesia other than as part of the diagnostic process. Ref: Vindra etal., Anaesthesia for Children with Neuromuscular Disease, Continuing Education in Anaesthesia Critical Care and Pain, Volume 10, Issue 5, 1 October2010, pages 143-147. Inguinal hernia repair is the most common general surgical procedure performed by pediatric surgeons. Males are more frequently affected than females, and the incidence of inguinal hernia is highest in the first year of life. Right-sided hernias (60%) occur more frequently than left-sided (30%) and bilateral (10%) hernias. Risk factors associated with inguinal hernias are prematurity, chronic respiratory illness, and excessive intraperitoneal fluid (ventriculoperitoneal shunts, ascites, peritoneal dialysis). Anesthesia can be induced by mask inhalation of volatile agents or by IV or rectal technique. Endotracheal intubation is usually unnecessary for herniorrhaphy, except in infants younger than 1 year, in whom it may be difficult to maintain an adequate airway with bag and mask ventilation without distending the stomach. Premature infants have a particularly high incidence of inguinal hernias. In these infants, for whom an inhalation anesthetic may have increased risks, spinal anesthesia and caudal epidural anesthesia have been used successfully to avoid general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. The history is compatible with cerebral palsy or congenital myopathies. Since this is an elective surgical repair, complete neurological workup and diagnosis is necessary before anesthetic risk can be assessed. These children are ideal for assessment by a multidisciplinary team which include anaesthesiologists and pediatrician. A complete history and physical examination is essential before anaesthetizing these children, including a discussion of postoperative pain management with the parents. Cognitive and communication problems may make preoperative assessment more difficult. Parents and caretakers are best to be involved during this period not only to gain information but also allay the fears of the child. Anesthetic Concern in Cerebral Palsy. Intraoperative hypothermia and slow emergence. Suxamethonium does not cause hyperkalaemia in these patients, and a rapid sequence induction may be indicated. Anesthetic Concern in Neuromuscular Diseases. The incidence of anaesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis is significant. Succinylcholine and volatile agents should be avoided in at-risk children.",

        "exp": "In Mendelson's syndrome, the critical pH is 2. 5 and the critical volume is 25ml (0. 3ml/kg body wt). Opioids will decrease the tone of LES and increase the risk rather than decrease. In 1946, Mendelson was the first to describe aspiration pneumonitis attributable to the pulmonary aspiration of acidic gastric secretions in pregnant women undergoing anesthesia. This potentially fatal complication, occasionally referred to as Mendelson syndrome, has since been the intense focus of preventive effos among the anesthesia community. Prevention of aspiration of gastric contents is primarily accomplished by adherence to established preoperative fasting guidelines, premedication with drugs that may decrease the risk of aspiration pneumonitis, and specialized induction techniques. Traditionally, patients who were scheduled for elective procedures requiring sedation, regional anesthesia, or general anesthesia were instructed to remain NPO (Latin for nulla per os or nothing by mouth) after midnight to ensure an empty stomach to decrease the risk of regurgitation. Based on evidence that allowing ingestion of clear liquids 2 to 4 hours before surgery resulted in lower gastric volumes and higher gastric pH, the ASA published Practice Guidelines for Preoperative Fasting and the Use of Pharmacologic Agents to Reduce the Risk of Pulmonary Aspiration in 1999 that liberalized the traditional NPO policy and allowed clear liquids up to 2 hours before beginning elective procedures requiring anesthesia. The guidelines, updated in 2011, recommend 4 hours of fasting from breast milk 6 hours of fasting from solid foods, infant formula, and nonhuman milk. Fried or fatty foods may require longer fasting times (e. g., 8 hours or more). Although the ASA guidelines do not specifically address chewing gum, hard candies, or smoking, guidelines published by the European Society of Anaesthesiology on the topic do not recommend delaying the sta of anesthesia if a patient has consumed any of these immediately before the induction of anesthesia. The routine use of drugs as prophylaxis against aspiration pneumonitis is not recommended by the ASA guidelines but may be beneficial in patients with specific risk factors for aspiration, such as a full stomach, symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hiatal hernia, presence of a nasogastric tube, morbid obesity, diabetic gastroparesis, or pregnancy. The goal of aspiration prophylaxis is twofold: to decrease gastric volume and to increase gastric fluid pH. Commonly used agents include nonpaiculate antacids (e. g., Bicitra), promotility drugs (e. g., metoclopramide), and H2-receptor antagonists. These drugs may be used alone or in combination.

        "exp": "Ans. B. Preperative glycopyrolate is not helpful for prevention. (Ref. Miller's Anesthesia 7th/Pg. 293; Paul's Clinical Anesthesia/Pg. 1327). A variety of stimuli arising in or near the eye especially following traction on the medial rectus or pressure on the eye ball may cause bradycardia, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. In clinical practice this oculocardiac reflex (Trigeminovagal reflex) is most often encountered during squint surgery in children. OCR is also seen during eye muscle surgery, repair of detached retina, compression of gasserian ganglion 13, enucleation of eye and by contact lens and repair of nasal fracture under General Anaesthesia. Prophylactic anti cholinergic is recommended and adequate cardiac monitoring must accompany these interventions as immediate action may be required. OCR may be manifest by bradycardia, bigeminey, ectopic beats, nodal rhythm, AV block and cardiac arrest. Oculocardiac Reflex (Trigeminovagal Reflex)# Bernard Aschner and Guiseppe Dagnini first described the oculocardiac reflex in 1 908. This reflex is triggered by pressure on the globe and by traction on the extraocular muscles, as well as on the conjunctiva or the orbital structures.# This reflex is clinically significant during strabismus surgery in children, although the manifestations of this reflex are not consistent. The oculocardiac reflex (OCR) is induced by pressure on the eyeball.# The afferent pathway follows the long and short ciliary nerves to the ciliary ganglion. From there, it travels to the gasserian ganglion body along the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). The afferent pathway ends in the main trigeminal sensory nucleus in the floor of the fourth ventricle.# Efferent impulses start at the vasomotor center and travel through the vagal nerve (CN X) and the sympathetic chain. Bradycardia is the result of increasing parasympathetic tone. Decreasing sympathetic tone causes vasodilatation.# The cardiac effect stops when eye pressure is relieved. Patients should be monitored to recognize ECG changes. Atropine should be available to reverse life-threatening bradycardia.",

Fontes). On doing laparoscopic cholecystectomy patient developed wheezing, which should be treated by deepening of the plane of anesthesia. The most common cause of asthmatic attack during surgery is inadequate depth of anesthesia. First, deepen the level of anesthesia and increase FIO2. Remember that the patient is under anesthesia and undergoing surgery. Therefore, medical intervention, such as B-agonist administration, is not the first choice of treatment. - Yao and Artusio's Anesthesiology. In the middle of surgery, the patient developed a severe wheezing attack. How do you manage it? First, deepen the level of anesthesia and increase FIO2, Remember that the patient is under anesthesia and undergoing surgery. Therefore, medical intervention, such as B-agonist administration, is not the first choice of treatment. The most common cause of asthmatic attack during surgery is inadequate depth of anesthesia. The patient with asthma has an extremely sensitive tracheobronchial tree. When the level of anesthesia is too light, the patient may develop bucking, straining, or coughing as a result of the foreign body (endotracheal tube) in the trachea and then bronchospasm. First, the blood pressure is taken to ensure it is normal or high, and then anesthesia is deepened by increasing the concentration of inhalation agents, such as sevoflurane, halothane, or isoflurane. which are direct bronchodilators as well. An incremental dose of ketamine maybe a quick way of maintaining blood pressure, rapidly deepening anesthesia, achieving bronchodilation, and avoiding the problem of delivering an inhaled anesthetic to a patient with poor ventilation. At the same time, oxygenation can be improved by increasing the inspired oxygen concentration and decreasing nitrous oxide. The patient should be continuously ventilated with a volume-cycled ventilator. Second, relieve mechanical stimulation. Pass a catheter through the endotracheal tube to suction secretions and determine whether there is an obstruction, kinking of the tube, or overinflation of the endotracheal tube cuff. The cuff of the endotracheal tube can be deflated, the tube moved back 1 to 2 cm, and the cuff reinflated. Occasionally, the endotracheal tube slips down and stimulates the carina of the trachea, causing severe bronchospasm during light anesthesia. Surgical stimulation, such as traction on the mesentery, intestine, or stomach, should be stopped temporarily, because it causes vagal reflex and can cause bronchospasm. Third, medical intervention is necessary if the previously mentioned treatment cannot break the bronchospasm or the anesthesia cannot be increased because of hypotension. The cornerstone of the treatment of the intraoperative bronchospasm is inhalation of B2-agonists such as albuterol, which induce further bronchodilation even in the presence of adequate inhalational anesthesia. Fourth, bring in an intensive care unit (ICU) ventilator. Anesthesia ventilators are not designed for patients with high airway resistance. An ICU ventilator can generate inspiratory pressures as high as 120 cm H2O. With low tubing compliance, little ventilation is wasted into the circuit.",

Fluid resuscitation in septic shock* The landmark of septic shock is systemic vasodilation, with different levels of hypovolemia. Fluid administration is the first-line intervention to restore the systemic hemodynamics and increase oxygen delivery to match oxygen demand in septic patients.* Fluid resuscitation is initiated to achieve a CVP of 8 to 12 mm. Hg* According to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, septic patients presenting tissue hypoperfusion, hypotension or signs of hypovolemia and admitted to the emergency department must receive an initial fluid load with 30mL/kg of body weight of crystalloids.* Crystalloid refers to solutions containing water, inorganic ions and small organic molecules. Crystalloids are composed of glucose or sodium chloride solutions, and can be hypotonic, isotonic or hypertonic* They supply water and electrolytes to maintain osmotic gradient between extravascular and intravascular compartments as they contain fluids and electrolytes that are normally found in the body.* Colloids have larger molecular-weight particles that give them oncotic plasma pressures similar to natural plasma proteins. This theoretically allows for better volume resuscitation by remaining in the intravascular space and supporting circulating volume as compared to crystalloids, which may have extravascular shift causing pulmonary and interstitial edema. However, in patients with increased vascular permeability as seen in sepsis and late hemorrhagic shock, leakage of these larger colloid molecules also exist.* Hypo-oncotic albumin solutions can be used as an alternative for those who need large amounts of fluids during the initial resuscitation phase.* Hydroxyethyl starches solutions must be avoided in septic patients due to the increased risk of acute renal failure, increased need for renal replacement therapy and increased mortality.",

Oo It is colourless, odourless, heavier than air, nonirritating and noninflammable gas. o It is also called laughing gas. o MAC is 105% (least potent) - even pure N2O at 1 atmospheric pressure can not produce adequate anaesthesia. o It has good analgesic but poor muscle relaxant activity. o It is supplied under pressure in blue coloured steel cyclinders. o It has very low blood solubility - induction is quick and smooth with rapid recovery. o Second gas effect and diffusion hypoxia occur with N2O only. o N2O is generally used as a carrier and adjuvant to other anaesthetics - A mixture of 70% N2O + 25 - 30% O2 + 0[?]2 - 2% another potent anaesthetic is employed for most of the surgical procedures. o Entonox is a mixture of 50% N2O and 50% O2. o It has little effect on respiration, heart and BP. o It can cause bone marrow depression and vit B12 deficiency. o N2O is the only anaesthetic reported to produce hematologic toxicity and neurotoxicity with long term administration. o Both toxicides are the result of the interaction of N2O with vit B12. o Complete bone marrow failure can be expected after several days of continuous exposure. o Bone marrow changes are preventable by pretreating patients with large doses of folinic acid. o Other manifestations of vit B12 deficiency eg. megaloblastic anemia, subacute combined degeneration of cord may also occur. o Methemoglobinemia and laryngospasm may occur. o It is contraindicated in patients with air cavities like pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum and volvulus - expansion and increase in pressure occur.",

About other options* It produces little cardiovascular and respiratory depression - Agent of choice for cardiovascular surgeries (bypass, aneurysms, valve surgery). Etomidate is most cardiostable inducing agent. Coronary perfusion pressure is maintained when it is used with fentanyl.* Similar to thiopentone & propofol, etomidate is cerebroprotective - Decreases cerebral blood flow, metabolism, oxygen consumption and ICT.* Superficial thrombophlebitis and pain may occur on IV injection but intraarterial injection is not associated with local or vascular complications.",

CSF ata rate faster that it can be produced causes traction on structure supporting the brain, particularly dura and tentorium. Traction on cranial nerve (particularly 6th nerve) produces diplopia, o Factors that increase the incidence of PDPH art young age, female sex, Pregnancy, large bore needle and multiple punctures. o Use of small bore needle can prevent PDPH. o Intially conservative treatment is given which includes analgesics (NSAIDs), oral or i. v., fluids, Sumatriptan, cosyntropin, caffeine and recumbent position. o If conservative treatment fails, epidural blood patch can be used. It involves injecting 15-20 ml of autologus blood into the epidural space which stop leakage of CSF by coagulation and mass effect.",
