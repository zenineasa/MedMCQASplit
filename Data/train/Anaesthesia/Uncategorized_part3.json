Their logic is that, if the head end is lowered, the anesthetic drug will move up and will produce severe hypotension and bradycardia. However, all texts books have mentioned that in the management of hypotension after spinal anesthesia, head low position (Trendelenburg position) should be given to increase the venous return. \"Head low position (Trendelenburg position) to increase the venous return. Although the concern of trendelenburg position increases the chances of high spinal anesthesia, but number of studies have proven that the beneficial effects over weigh these problems and secondly head low up to 15\u00b0 does not significantly increase the level of block. So, trendelenburg up to 15\u00b0 does not significantly increase the level of block.

Clinical features: contracture, rigidity, and heat production from skeletal muscle resulting in severe hypehermia, accelerated muscle metabolism, metabolic acidosis, and tachycardia. Mechanism: Uncontrolled release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle is the initiating event. Although the halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics (e. g., halothane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) and succinylcholine alone repoedly precipitate the response, most incidents arise from the combination of depolarizing blocking agent and anesthetic. Susceptibility to malignant hypehermia, an autosomal dominant trait Treatment: Intravenous administration of dantrolene (DANTRIUM), which blocks Ca2+release and its sequelae in skeletal muscle. Rapid cooling, inhalation of 100% oxygen, and control of acidosis should be considered adjunct therapy in malignant hypehermia",

        "exp": "Ans. is `B' i. e., Supraclavicular Brachial plexus block This is the second most commonly practised block after central neuraxial block (spinal & epidural anaesthesia). Brachial plexus block is used for upper limb surgeries. Brachial plexus can be blocked by 4 approaches: - 1. Interscalene approach Brachial plexus is blocked between anterior and middle scalene. This approach is not used routinely due to close proximity of vital structures. Ulnar nerve is usually spared by this approach because injection is given in close proximity of upper nerve roots and inferior nerve roots (C8-T 1) may be spared. This technique provides excellent anaesthesia and analgesia for shoulder and upper arm procedures. (in contrast to other three approaches which do not provide adequate shoulder anaesthesia). Complications include Horner syndrome (due to stellate ganglion block), phrenic nerve block, intravascular injection into carotids and epidural or intrathecal injections. 2. Supraclavicular approach This is the most commonly used approach. It involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity to the trunks of the brachial plexus by inseing the needle lateral to subclan vessels. The supraclavicular block is performed where the brachial plexus is most compact, consequently, it produces reliable and rapid onset anaesthesia and is paicularly useful in a fast paced ambulatory surgery centre. Pneumothorax is the most common complication. Other complications include phrenic nerve block, intravascular injection in subclan aery or vein, Horner syndrome, hematoma formation. 3. Infra-clavicular approach Infraclavicular block involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity of cords of the brachial plexus. The axillary nerve may be spared as this nerve exits the brachial plexus sheath proximal to the level of infraclavicular block. 4. Axillary approach Axillary block involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity of terminal branches of the brachial plexus. The major disadvantage of this approach is that mucocutaneous and intercostobrachial nerves are spared. So arm surgery cannot be performed. In contrast to interscalene approach, most intense block occur in (C7-T1) ulnar dermatomes and least in C5-C6 dermatomes.",

Bradycardia will sometimes occur in adults when a second bolus of succinylcholine is administered approximately 3-8 min after the first dose. The dogma is that the succinylcholine metabolite, succinylmonocholine, sensitizes muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the sinoatrial node to the second dose of succinylcholine, resulting in bradycardia. Intravenous atropine is normally given prophylactically to children prior to the first and subsequent doses, and usually before a second dose of succinylcholine is given to adults. Succinylcholine not only stimulates nicotinic cholinergic receptors at the neuromuscular junction, it stimulates all ACh receptors. Low doses of succinylcholine can produce negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, but higher doses usually increase heart rate and contractility and elevate circulating catecholamine levels.

The Ry. R1 gene is located on chromosome 19. Malignant hypehermia (MH) is a subclinical myopathy that allows large quantities of calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle and cause a hypermetabolic state after exposure to triggering agents. Altered calcium channel gating kinetics in the SR is the underlying cause.

(CO shift oxy. Hb dissociation curve to left). - Improvement in mucociliary transpo and small airway function and decrease in sputum production require prolonged abstinence (8-12 weeks) from smoking. So the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications decrease with abstinence from cigarette smoking for > 8 weeks in patients undergoing cardiac (coronary aery bypass) surgery and > 4 weeks in patients underging pulmonary surgery. - Smoking sholy before surgery may be a/w an increased incidence ST segment depression on ECG. Major action of nicotine consists initially of transient stimulation (at small doses) and subsequently of a more persistent depression of all autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) ganglia (at larger doses). Nicotine also possess a biphasic action on adrenal medulla i. e. small doses evoke whereas larger doses prevent the discharge of catecholamines in response to splanchnic nerve stimulation. The effect of nicotine on neuromuscular junction are similar to those on ganglia i. e. initial stimulant phase (contractions) f/b blockade by receptor desensitization (IA rapidly developing paralysis). Nicotine, like Ach, stimulates number of sensory receptors such as mechanoreceptors (to stretch or pressure) of skin, mesentry, tongue, lung and stomach; chemoreceptors of carotid and aoic body, thermal receptors of skin and tongue; pain receptors; and emetic chemorecepto trigger zone (CTZ) in the area postrema of medulle oblongata (causing vomiting). Nicotine markedly stimulates CNS i. e. weak analgesia at low doses; tremors and convulsion at higher doses followed by CNS depression and death from respiratory failure.

Etomidate is a dose dependent but reversible inhibitor of 11 - hydroxylase in the adrenal coex and is more potent than metyrapone. This enzyme is required for both mineralocoicoid and coicosteroid production. Minor adrenocoical supressive effects (i. e. impaired response to ACTH) follow induction doses or sho infusion doses. Propofol is not recommended for sedation of critically ill pediatric patients in ICU. The drug has been associated with higher moality d/t propofol infusion syndrome.

It is considered to be Type I hypersensitivity reaction (immediate type) to exogenous allergens such as grass pollens. It is more common in boys and affects age group 4-20 years. More common in summer, hence the name spring catarrh looks a misnomer. Recently it is being labeled as \"Warm weather conjunctivitis\". Clinical features of spring catarrh Spring catarrh is characterized by marked itching& burning, Stringy (ropy) discharge, lacrimation, photophobia and heaviness of lids. Clinically spring catarrh is divided into three types:? Palpebral form: - It is the most common types. The upper palpebral conjunctiva shows papillae (papillary hyperophy with their characteristic appearance: - i) Lage & flat toped Cobble stone appearance (Pavement stone appearance). These papilla heal without scarring. Bulbar form: - It is characterized by Dusky red triangular congestion of bulbar conjunctiva in palpebral area; Gelatinous thickened accumulation of tissue around the limbus; Presence of discrete whitish raised dots along the limbus (Tranta's spot). Mixed form: - Both bulbar and palpebral manifestations occur together.

At one minute, the drug attains a peak concentration of about 60% of the total dose in the brain. Thereafter, the drug distributes to the rest of the body and in about 15-20 minutes the concentration is low enough in the brain such that consciousness returns Thiopental is not used to maintain anaesthesia in surgical procedures because, in infusion, it displays zero-order elimination kinetics, leading to a long period before consciousness is regained. Instead, anaesthesia is usually maintained with an inhaled anesthetic (gas) agent. Inhaled anesthetics are eliminated relatively quickly, so that stopping the inhaled anesthetic will allow rapid return of consciousness.",

By decreasing the rate of absorption, it not only localizes the anesthetic at the desired site, but also allows the rate at which it is destroyed in the body to keep pace with the rate at which it is absorbed into the circulation. This reduces its systemic toxicity. Must Know: The use of vasoconstrictors in local anesthetic preparations for anatomical regions with limited collateral circulation could produce irreversible hypoxic damage, tissue necrosis, and gangrene, and therefore is contraindicated.

Mechanism of action of LA Local anaesthetics block generation and conduction of nerve impulse at all pa of neuron where they come in contact, without causing structural damage. Thus not only sensory but motor impulses and autonomic control is also interrupted. Mechanism of action Normally Na+ channel in axonal membrane has following phases: Recovery Resting (close) - Active (open) - Inactive (open) LAs prolong the inactive state --> channel takes longer to recover - refractory period of the fiber is increased. LAs first penetrate the axonol membrane to come inside and then their active species (cationic form) bind to Net' channel from inside. Cationic form (active form) is able to approach its receptor only when the channel is open at the inner face - So resting nerve is resistant to block as Na' channels are not activated and cationic form is not able to approach its receptor. So blockade develops rapidly when the nerve is stimulated repeatedly. Degree of blockade is frequency dependent greater blockade at higher frequency of stimulation. Exposure to higher concentration of Ca' reduces inactivation of Na' channels and lessens the block. Order of blockade of fibres B > C > AS> Ace, (3 & y (Autonomic > Sensory > Motor). Order of recovery is in reverse order. Among sensory afferent order of block is: Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure.

It is at the level of T12 and L, veebrae anterior to the crura of the diaphragm. It contains visceral afferent and efferent fibers divided from T5 to T1, by means of greater, lesser and least splanchnic nerves. Celiac plexus innervates most of the abdominal viscera, therefore this procedure blocks the nerves which come from the pancreas, liver, gall bladder, stomach, intestine, spleen, kidney and adrenal glands. A celiac plexus block can be combined with an intercostal block to provide anesthesia for intra-abdominal surgery. Because celiac plexus block results in blockade of the autonomic nervous system, this block may help to reduce stress and endocrine responses to surgery. For the same reason, the most common complication of celiac plexus block is postural hypotenstion because of blockade of lumbar sympathetic chain leading to upper abdominal vessel dilation and venous pooling. Celiac plexus block can be done by following three approaches: - Retrocrural (classic) approach, anterocrural approach and splanchnic nerve block. Celiac plexus block is given to treat intractable pain in chronic pancreatitis, gastric & pancreatic malignancies. It can be combined with an intercostal block to provide anesthesia for intra-abdomival surgery.

The condition occurs in known viral infections (herpes zoster, Epstein-Barr virus), following injections of tetanus toxoid, in putative viral infections; and as an autobnmune disorder following a surgical procedure. \"- Basic neurology By John Gilroy 3/e p594 Brachial plexus neuritis usually is characterized by the acute onset of excruciating unilateral shoulder pain, followed by flaccid paralysis of shoulder and parascapular muscles several days later. The syndrome can vary greatly in presentation and nerve involvement. Brachial neuritis (BN) exists in an inherited and an idiopathic form. In the idiopathic version, the pathophysiology is unknown, but the condition is generally thought to be an immune system - mediated inflammatory reaction against nerve fibers of the brachial plexus. The onset of pain in brachial neuritis (BN) is often abrupt and may follow recent illness, surgery, immunization, or even trauma (see Causes, below). Up to two thirds of cases begin during the nighttime. Sensory abnormalities are of usually of less intensity than the pain and muscle weakness. Causes: The exact cause of brachial neuritis is unknown, but the condition has been linked to many antecedent events or illnesses, as follows: Viral infection (paicularly of the upper respiratory tract) Bacterial infection (eg, pneumonia, diphtheria, typhoid) Parasitic infestation S urgery 2 Trauma (not related to shoulder) Vaccinations (eg, influenza, tetanus, diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, peussis [DPT J. smallpox, swine flu) Childbih Miscellaneous medical investigative procedures (eg, lumbar puncture, administration of radiologic dye) Systemic illness (eg, polyaeritis nodosa, lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal aeritis, Ehlers. Danlos syndrome) A rarer, hereditary form of BN has been localized to the SEPT9 gene on chromosome arm 17q and should be considered a distinct disorder. This entity presents in a younger age group, and is characterized by recurrent, often bilateral attacks. Dysmorphic facial features (eg, hypotelorism, long nasal bridge, facial asymmetry) can also be present. Diagnosis: Other causes of severe pain, such as an acute herniated cervical disc, should be excluded. In brachial plexus neuritis, electromyography and nerve conduction studies reveal abnormalities in more than one nerve; in contrast, cervical radiculopathy may show osteophytes and interspace narrowing on cervical spine x-rays and neuroforaminal disc impingement of MRI. Treatment: of brachial plexus neuritis is suppoive, with analgesics for pain, physical therapy to maintain shoulder strength/mobility, and reassurance that the condition generally will improve, albeit slowly.",

It acts on NMDA receptors. Sho duration of action (10-15 minutes) is due to redistribution from brain and blood to other tissues of the body. Ketamine is different from most other anaesthetic induction agents in that it has significant analgesic action. Ketamine increases IOT and cerebral metabolism --> contraindicated in head injury. It causes sympathetic stimulation with elevation of HR, CO & BP --) contraindicated in hypertension and ischemic heart disease. It also raises IOT --> contraindicated in glaucoma. It relieves bronchospasm --> intravenous anaesthetic of choice in asthmatics (inhalation anaesthetic of choice in asthmatic is halothane). Injection is not painful (All other inducing agents cause pain on injection). It is i. v. anaesthetic of choice in children (Sevoflurane is inhalation agent of choice). Because it causes sympathetic stimulation it is intravenous anaesthetic of choice in patients with shock and hypovolumia. It has no muscle relaxant propey rather muscle tone is increased. Airway reflexes (pharyngeal and laryngeal) are not depressed --> intravenous anaesthetic of choice for emergency anaesthesia (no starvation is required). Ketamine produces emergence reaction during awakening from anaesthesia --> vivid dreaming, illusions, extracorporeal experiences, excitment, confusion, fear and euphoria --> contraindicated in psychiatric illness like schizophrenia.",

        "exp": "Ans. A: Prolonged duration of effect Epidural anaesthesia, a form of regional anaesthesia involving injection of drugs through a catheter placed into the epidural space. The injection can cause both a loss of sensation (anaesthesia) and a loss of pain (analgesia), by blocking the transmission of signals through nerves in or near the spinal cord The anaesthetist may use epidural analgesia in addition to general anaesthesia. This may reduce the patient's requirement for opioid analgesics. This is suitable for a wide variety of surgery, for example gynaecological surgery (e. g. hysterectomy), ohopaedic surgery (e. g. hip replacement), general surgery (e. g. laparotomy) and vascular surgery (e. g. open aoic aneurysm repair) which are longer duration surgeries. Other features of epidural anaesthesia: Expensive compared to spinal anaesthesia More incidence of intravascular injection (epidural space has venous plexus of Batson) More incidence of epidural hematoma Level of block can be changed by increasing the dose through the catheter",
