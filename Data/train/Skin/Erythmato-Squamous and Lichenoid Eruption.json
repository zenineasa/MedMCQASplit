Lichen planus. Etiology unknown. Important features are alopecia, severe itching and oral mucosal involvement. Wickham's striae, ie, a network of grayish lines on papules of lichen planus is the characteristic lesion. Important features of the lesion are 5 P's* Pruritic* Purple* Polygonal* Plain top* Papular lesion. Wickham's striae are due to alteration in density of granular layer. It is associated with Kobner phenomenon which is more characteristic of lichen planus than psoriasis. Pterygium of nail (hypertrophy of eponychium) is an important feature and is diagnostic of lichen planus. Histopathological features of typical lichen planus are hyperkeratosis, irregular hypergranulosis, irregular acanthosis, liquefactive degeneration of the basal cells and pointed, saw tooth like elongation of the rete ridges. There is infiltration of dermo-epidermal junction by lymphocytes, histiocytes and melanophages. Minute spaces called \"Max Joseph spaces\" are seen between the epidermis and dermis due to liquefactive degeneration of the basal cells. Civatte bodies are found which represent necrotic keratinocytes in dermis. Other names are colloid bodies/apoptotic bodies.

Explanation: The Koebner phenomenon is the development of isomorphic pathologic lesions in the traumatized uninvolved skin of patients who have cutaneous diseases. Koebner phenomenon signifies activity of the disease. Types of Koebner phenomenon: 1. True isomorphic phenomenon: There appear to be three disease processes that display the true isomorphic response of Koebner: Psoriasis. Lichen planus. Vitiligo. 2. Pseudoisomorphic phenomenon: The Koebner phenomenon also seen in infectious diseases. Warts. Molluscum contagiosum. Behcet's disease. Pyoderma gangrenosum. 3. Occasionally occurring isomorphic phenomenon: In this category, diseases occasionally localize to sites of trauma, e. g. Cancer (gastric, testicular or mammary ). Darier's disease. Erythema multiforme. Hailey-Hailey disease. Kaposi's sarcoma. Kyrle's disease. Lichen sclerosus et atrophieus. Pellagra. Perforating folliculitis. Reactive perforating collagenosis. Koebner response in psoriasis: The reported incidence of Koebner response in psoriasis varies from 11-75%. The latent period between injury to uninvolved skin and appearance of disease is usually 10-14 days, but it may range from 3 days to several years. The \"reverse\" Koebner response: The reverse Koebner reaction is seen when an area of psoriasis clears following injury.",

Characterized by round/oval pink brown patches with a superficial, centrifugal scale, distributed over trunk in a Christmas tree pattern. The disease is thought to be viral disease, is self limiting, and subsides in 6-12 weeks. The exact etiology is not known, but it is considered to be a viral disease; Human Herpes virus 6 (HHV 6) and Human Herpes virus 7 (HHV 7) may play a role. Clinical manifestations of P. roseao The disease starts with an upper respiratory prodrome or a mild flu. After 1-2 weeks, Annular erythmatous plaque appears on trunk that is referred to as mother patch or herald patch. Over the next 1 -2 weeks, fresh patch appear all over the trunk, in a Christmas tree configuration or Fir tree Configration. The lesions are pinkish in white skin, hence the name rosea. However, on the dark Indian skin the lesions are skin coloured or brown. The most characteristic clue for the diagnosis is the presence of a fine scale at the edge of the lesion referrred to as centrifugal scale or collarette scales or cigarette paper scales. Lesions subside with hyperpigmentation. Trunk is involved predominantly, Sometimes (in 20% of patients) lesions occur predominantly on extremities and neck (inverse pattern). o Hanging curtain sign is seen in patients with pityriasis rosea. When the skin is stretched across long axis of herald patch, the scale is noted to be finer, lighter, and attached to one end, which tends to fold across the line of scratch. Drug induced pityriasis roseao Some drugs may cause pityriasis rosea like skin lesions.
