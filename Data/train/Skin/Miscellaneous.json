QMorphology of lesions and variants: Primary lesions are of three types: Burrow: Serpentine (S-shaped) path traversed by parasite in stratum corneumQ.

        "exp": "Ans. D. Lymph node involvement suggests worst prognosis. a. Kaposi's sarcoma is a multicentric neoplasm consisting of multiple vascular nodules appearing in the skin, mucous membranes, and viscera. The course ranges from indolent, with only minor skin or lymph node involvement, to fulminant, with extensive cutaneous and visceral involvement. b. In the initial period of the AIDS epidemic, KS was a prominent clinical feature of the first cases of AIDS, occurring in 79% of the patients diagnosed in 1981. By 1989 it was seen in only 25% of cases, by 1992 the number had decreased to 9%, and by 1997 the number was <1%. HHV-8 or KSHV has been strongly implicated as a viral cofactor in the pathogenesis of KS. c. Clinically, KS has varied presentations and may be seen at any stage of HIV infection, even in the presence of a normal CD4+ T cell count. The initial lesion may be a small, raised reddish-purple nodule on the skin, a discoloration on the oral mucosa, or a swollen lymph node. d. Lesions often appear in sun-exposed areas, particularly the tip of the nose, and have a propensity to occur in areas of trauma (Koebner phenomenon). Because of the vascular nature of the tumors and the presence of extravasated red blood cells in the lesions, their colors range from reddish to purple to brown and often take the appearance of a bruise, with yellowish discoloration and tattooing. e. Lesions range in size from a few millimeters to several centi- meters in diameter and may be either discrete or confluent. KS lesions most commonly appear as raised macules; however, they can also be papular, particularly in patients with higher CD4+ T cell counts. Con- fluent lesions may give rise to surrounding lymphedema and may be disfiguring when they involve the face and disabling when they involve the lower extremities or the surfaces of joints. f. Apart from skin, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and lung are the organ systems most commonly affected by KS. Lesions have been reported in virtually every organ, including the heart and the CNS. In contrast to most malignancies, in which lymph node involvement implies metastatic spread and a poor prognosis, lymph node involvement may be seen very early in KS and is of no special clinical significance.",

It can also occur through blood products or vertically from mother to child. It can resemble other childhood rashes, such as rubella or scarlet fever, but, slapped cheek syndrome usually begins with the distinctive, sudden appearance of bright red cheeks that look as if the child has been slapped. The disease is rare in infants and adults. Fetal infection can result in anemia, fetal hydrops or death. Symptoms in Children. High temperature of 38degC (100. 4degF). Bright red cheeks. A flat or raised red rash, usually on the arms and legs, which lasts from 2 to 39 days and may itch. The rash fades from the center of red areas towards the edges, giving it a lacy appearance.

Characterized by round/oval pink brown patches with a superficial, centrifugal scale, distributed over trunk in a Christmas tree pattern. The exact etiology is not known, but it is considered to be a viral disease; Human Herpes virus 6 (HHV 6) and Human Herpes virus 7 (HHV 7) may play a role. Clinical manifestations of P. rosea* The disease starts with an upper respiratory prodrome or a mild flu. After 1-2 weeks, annular erythematous plaque appears on trunk that is referred to as mother patch or herald patch. Over the next 1-2 weeks, fresh patch appear all over the trunk, in a Christmas tree configuration or Fir tree Configuration. The lesions are pinkish in white skin, hence the name rosea. However, on the dark Indian skin the lesions are skin coloured or brown. The most characteristic clue for the diagnosis is the presence of a fine scale at the edge of the lesion referrred to as centrifugal scale or collarette scales or cigarette paper scales. Lesions subside with hyperpigmentation. Trunk is involved predominantly, Sometimes (in 20% of patients) lesions occur predominantly on extremities and neck (inverse pattern).* Hanging curtain sign is seen in patients with pityriasis rosea.
