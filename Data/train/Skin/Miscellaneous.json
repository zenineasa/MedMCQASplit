        "exp": "(a) Source: (Braunwald, 15/e, pp 318, 323, 822, 1061, 1917-1918.) Urticaria, or hives, is a common dermatologic problem characterized by pruritic, edematous papules and plaques that vary in size and come and go, often within hours. Mast cells may be stimulated by heat, cold, pressure, water, or exercise. Immunologic mechanisms can also cause mast cell degranulation. Folliculitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause a rash, often after exposure to hot tubs. The lesions would not be as diffuse, with a line of demarcation depending on the water level. These lesions are pustular and occur 8 to 48 h after soaking. Erythema multiforme produces target-like lesions and oral blisters often secondary to medications. Erythema chronicum migrans usually presents with a large, solitary annular lesion.",

The spots are caused by bleeding underneath the skin usually secondary to vasculitis or dietary deficiency of vitamin C. Other Options: Option a: Crusts (scabs): Crusts consist of dried serum and other exudates. Option b: Atrophy* Loss of tissue from one or more of the epidermis, dermis or subcutaneous tissues.* There may be fine wrinkling and increased translucency if the process is superficial. Option d: Induration: Dermal thickening that clinically presents as skin that feels thicker and firmer on palpation than normal. Primary Lesions of Skin.

Usually, treatment with high-potency topical glucocorticoids is enough to relieve symptoms while the dermatitis runs its course. For those patients who require systemic therapy, daily oral prednisone beginning at 1mg/kg, but usually 60mg/d, is sufficient. It should be tapered over 2-3 weeks, and each daily dose given in the morning with food. b. Identification of a contact allergen can be a difficult and time-consuming task. Patients with dermatitis unresponsive to conventional therapy or with an unusual and patterned distribution should be suspected of having ACD. They should be questioned carefully regarding occupational exposures and topical medications. Common sensitizers include preservatives in topical preparations, nickel sulfate, potassium dichromate, thimerosal, neomycin sulfate, fragrances, formaldehyde, and rubber-curing agents. Patch testing is helpful in identifying these agents but should not be attempted on patients with widespread active dermatitis or on those taking systemic glucocorticoids.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., 6-12 weeks * P. rosea is self limiting disease, subsides with 6-12 weeks. Pityriasis rosea* P. rosea is a common scaly disorder, occuring usually in children and young adults (10-35 years). Characterized by round/oval pink brown patches with a superficial, centrifugal scale, distributed over trunk in a Christmas tree pattern. The exact etiology is not known, but it is considered to be a viral disease; Human Herpes virus 6 (HHV 6) and Human Herpes virus 7 (HHV 7) may play a role. Clinical manifestations of P. rosea* The disease starts with an upper respiratory prodrome or a mild flu. After 1-2 weeks, annular erythematous plaque appears on trunk that is referred to as mother patch or herald patch. Over the next 1-2 weeks, fresh patch appear all over the trunk, in a Christmas tree configuration or Fir tree Configuration. The lesions are pinkish in white skin, hence the name rosea. However, on the dark Indian skin the lesions are skin coloured or brown. The most characteristic clue for the diagnosis is the presence of a fine scale at the edge of the lesion referrred to as centrifugal scale or collarette scales or cigarette paper scales. Lesions subside with hyperpigmentation. Trunk is involved predominantly, Sometimes (in 20% of patients) lesions occur predominantly on extremities and neck (inverse pattern).* Hanging curtain sign is seen in patients with pityriasis rosea. When the skin is stretched across long axis of herald patch, the scale is noted to be finer, lighter, and attached to one end, which tends to fold across the line of scratch",
