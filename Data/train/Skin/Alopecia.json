When there is loss of total body hair it is referred as Alopecia universalis. Alopecia along the scalp margin is called ophiasis. An inverse ophiasis pattern (sisaphio) is when it spares occipital region and affects rest of the scalp. Presentation of alopecia areata* Young adults are affected, but can occur at any age. Round or oval circumscribed patches of hair loss, which may be single or multiple. Alopecia is sharply defined. Scalp is the first affected site in most cases but any hair bearing skin, e. g. beard, eyebrows and eyelashes can be involved. Exclamation mark hair - These are diagnostic and are characterized by broken-off stubby hair (distal end is broader than proximal end). Exclamation mark hair are seen at the margins of hair loss area.* The characteristic feature is sparing of gray/white hair and preferentially affecting pigmented (black/brown) hair. This results in a dramatic change in hair colour if alopecia progress rapidly and referred to as \"going white overnight phenomenon\".* In 10-15% of patient's there is nail involvement - Fine stippled pitting (\"hammered brass\"), mottled lunula, trachynonychia (rough nails), onychomadesis (separation of nail from matrix).",

        "exp": "Ans. D. Alopecia areata. (Ref Harrison, 18th/Pg. 298). Alopecia areata is characterized by abortive hair growth and the formation of a short, stubby, 'exclamation mark' hair at the edge of the area of hair loss. 'Alopecia' is a generic term for hair loss; areata is the plural of area. 'Alopecia areata' is a descriptive term for a disorder characterized by one or more discrete circular areas of hair loss and which can occur anywhere on the body. Alopecia totalis and universalis are variants of alopecia areata, differentiated only by the extent of the hair loss. Telogen effluvium# Acute telogen effluvium relates to a specific form of diffuse alopecia - eviction of hairshafts that have prematurely entered the telogen phase (telogen hair increase to 25%, normal-13%).# Excessive loss of hair can occur.# Telogen Effluvium tends to become apparent 6-12 weeks following the cause.# Such a hairloss can result in l-2cm stubble in extreme cases within weeks.# Causes include:- Pyrexia (body temperature reaching 103. 5 C +), - Childbirth (rare)- Telogen gravidarum, - severe infection (especially toxaemia), - major surgery, - protein deficiency due to unsupervised diets, - drugs including beta blockers, anti-depressants, minoxidil, - severe psychological stress.# Spontaneous regrowth occurs in 3-6 months. Anagen effluvium. Anagen effluvium is the dramatic and rapid hair loss most commonly seen in association with cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy to the scalp. Other causes are: high-dose colchicine; thallium, mercury, and arsenic poisoning; and cantharadin. The insult to the hair follicle is sufficiently severe to cause an immediate metabolicarrest with complete cessation of hair production. The hair may come out by the root or, if the insult is brief, the hair shaft will narrow, providing a point of weaknessthat subsequently snaps off. The follicle may remain in anagen, in which case recovery is quick, or move into telogen, in which case regrowth will be delayed by about3 months. Androgenetic alopecia. Androgenetic alopecia is a progressive patterned baldness, which is sufficiently common among both men and women to be considered a secondary sexualphenomenon. It is also called common baldness, male-patterned baldness, and female- patterned alopecia. When it occurs prematurely in a man, it can be anunwanted and distressing event and patients may present for treatment. Among women it is usually both unwanted and unexpected at any age and women commonlypresent for both diagnosis and treatment.

Minoxidil (Topical) - A vasodilator, which prolongs anagen phase of cycle there by slows hair loss and stimulate new hair. Hair growth is temporary, hair fall restarts if medication is withdrawn - required lifelong. 2. 5-a reductase inhibitors: - Finasteride inhibits type 2, 5a-reductase, which is responsible for conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in hair follicles. As this prevent conversion of testosterone to DHT hair loss slows down (DHT is the major causative hromone in androgenetic alopecia). Dutasteride - combined type 1 and type 2, 5a-reductase inhibitor. 3. Surgery - Punch graft, rotation flaps, scalp reduction, hair transplantation. B) In females1. Topical minoxidil - Same as for males2. Systemic antiandrogensa) Cyproterone acetate (with ethinyl estradiol) - blocks androgen receptors. (Note - Cyproterone acetate, ethinyl estradiol combination is Dianette.)b) Spironolactone - Blocks cytoplasmic receptors of DHT.

Autoimmune pathogenesis is supported by -The germinative zones of hair follicles are surrounded by T-lvmphocytes, where they are not normally present. Sometimes alopecia areata is associated with other autoimmune disorders, e. g. vitiligo, IL4, ulcerative colitis, hypothyroidism.# Frequency of type 1 DM is increased in relative of patients with alopecia areata but not in patient themselves --> alopecia areata may be protective against type 1 DM. 2.
