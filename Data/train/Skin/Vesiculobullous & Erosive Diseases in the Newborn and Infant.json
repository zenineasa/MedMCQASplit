Most commonly occurs on face, i.e., around nose & mouth; and exposed parts, i.e., arms, legs. Presents erythematous macule/papule which changes into vesicle which soon ruptures with formation of crusting. Crust has characteristic features : -Honey-yellow colour in streptococcal impetigo.Waxy in staphylococcal impetigo.Lesion heal without scarring. Mucous membrane involvement is rare. Lymphadenopathy is common2. Bullous impetigoIt is caused by staphylococcus aureus most often phage type 71.
