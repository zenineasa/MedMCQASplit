Burrow is pathognomic sign of scabies. Burrows are very difficult to demonstrate in infants. Scabieso Scabies in is caused by mites of the family Sarcoptidae, which includes Sarcoptes scabiei, the scabies mite. Usually affects children but can occur at any age. More common in low socioeconomic strata as overcrowding and poor hygiene facilitate the spread. The most imp mean of spread is direct contact with the infected individual. Scabies is water shed disease wrhich occurs die to inadequate use of water and improper hygiene. Pathogenesiso After copulation male mite dies and female mite burrows down into superficial skin layer (s. corneum) at rate of 2mm/day. Female mite lays eggs which hatch into the larva, which moulds and mature into adult mites. The mites then burrow through stratum corneum. These burrows are visible clinically as irregular grey brown line. Burrow is pathognomic sign of scabies. o Incubation period is 4-6 weeks before itching starts. During this period there is no symptom because itching is due to hypersensitivity to some of the products (saliva scabin) of mites and it takes 4-6 weesk to hyprsensitivity to develop.

Size: 0. 4x0. 2 (female), 0. 2 x 0. 15mm (male). Time from hatching to adult: 14-17 days. Average rate of egg laying: 2-3/ day, (40-50 eggs/ lifetime). Average number of female mites. In adult: 12. In infant: 20. Lifespan of adult female mite: 4-6 weeks. Incubation periodI ST episode 4 weeks. Subsequent episode ->> 2 weeks. How is scabies transmitted? Scabies is passed from an infected person to another via prolonged skin contact, sexually and nonsexually (ten minutes or more, often through hand holding). Infected persons who have no itching can pass the mite on to othersA person can be infected for up to 2 to 6 weeks before the rash or itching occurs. Scabies is not transmitted via clothing or bedding. Clinical Features. Nocturnal itching. Pathognomic lesions are burrows - slightly raised, brownish, tortuous lesions. Burrow's can be difficult to identify but absence of burrow's does not exclude scabies. Usual sites are wrist, borders of hands, sides of fingers, finger web spaces, instep of feet & genitalia. Papular rash. The rash is an allergic reaction of the body to the mite, its waste products, and its eggs. Sites of rash may not correspond to sites of burrows. Classical sites (Circle of liebra). Axilla, Elbows, Wrist, Hands, Crotch, -- all forms a circle. Other variants. Nodular scabies- scrotum, axilla, groins, penis. Bullous scabies. Crusted scabies (Norwegian). Neurologic disorders, immunocompromised patientswidespread erthema, hyperkeratosis, crusting without burrow's. Innumerable mites. Scabies in clean. Scabies incognito.
