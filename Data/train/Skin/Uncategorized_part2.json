DIF results remain positive for a long time and may still be positive many years after clinical remission.

        "exp": "This is a case of Lupus vulgaris. Lupus vulgaris is a rare, chronic, progressive form of cutaneous tuberculosis that develops as a result of direct extension from underlying joints or lymph nodes; through lymphatic or hematogenous spread; or, rarely, by cutaneous inoculation with BCG vaccine. It most commonly follows cervical adenitis or pulmonary tuberculosis. Approximately 33% of cases are preceded by scrofuloderma, and 90% of cases present on the head and neck, most commonly on the nose or cheek. Involvement of the trunk is uncommon. A typical solitary lesion consists of a soft, brownish-red papule that has an apple-jelly color when examined by diascopy. One or several lesions may develop, including nodules or plaques that are flat and serpiginous, hyperophic and verrucous, or edematous in appearance. Spontaneous healing occurs centrally, and lesions characteristically reappear within the area of atrophy. Lymphadenitis is present in 40% of those with lupus vulgaris. Squamous cell carcinoma, with a relatively high metastatic potential, may develop, usually after several years of the disease. After a temporary impairment in immunity, paicularly after measles infection (lupus exanthematicus), multiple lesions may form at distant sites as a result of hematogenous spread from a latent focus of infection. Histologic examination and a positive culture for M. tuberculosis/bovis confirm the diagnosis. The tuberculin test is strongly positive except for the early phases of post-exanthematic lupus. Acid-fast bacilli are usually not found on histopathological examination. Small lesions can be excised. Antituberculous drug therapy usually halts fuher spread and induces involution.

        "exp": "This is stasis dermatitis, which is a common complication of chronic lower leg edema, typically due to either congestive hea failure, venous incompetence, or both. The condition may be neglected by both the patient and the physician because of its relative lack of symptoms. However, it should be taken seriously because once skin breakdown occurs, the resulting ulcer may be very difficult to treat successfully. Helpful measures in the treatment of stasis dermatitis include elevating the ankles above the hea, properly fitted suppo hose, and tap water compresses. Ulcers are treated with compresses and bland dressings. Oral antibiotics are used when an ulcer becomes infected. Atopic dermatitis is an itchy inflammation of the skin that appears to have an allergic basis. Lichen simplex chronicus can also involve the ankles, but the lesion is very itchy, tends to be relatively localized, and is not typically accompanied by ankle edema. Seborrheic dermatitis causes diffuse scaling (dandruff) of the scalp. Ref: Suurmond D. (2009). Section 16. Skin Signs of Vascular Insufficiency. In D.

It refers to the fact that in persons with ceain skin diseases, especially psoriasis, trauma (scratches, surgical incisions/ injury) is followed by new lesions in the traumatized but otherwise normal skin, and these new lesions are clinically and histopathologically identical to those in the diseased skin. Type of Koebner phenomenon: Boyd and Neldner have classified all repoed cases of Koebner phenomenon into four different groups: True isomorphic phenomenon-There appear to be three disease processes that display the true isomorphic response of Koebner: psoriasis, lichen planus and vitiligo; Pseudoisomorphic phenomenon the Koebner phenomenon seen in infectious diseases, e.g. was, molluscum contagiosum and Behcet's disease and pyoderma gangrenosum; Occasionally occurring isomorphic phenomenon-In this category, diseases occasionally localize to sites of trauma, e.g. cancer (gastric, testicular or mammary), Darier's disease, erythema multiforme, Hailey-Hailey disease, Kaposi's sarcoma, Kyrle's disease, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, pellagra, perforating folliculitis, reactive perforating collagenosis, and Questionable isomorphic phenomenon -There are many conditions that have been associated with the Koebner phenomenon, many of which are single case repos.

Scleroderma is classified into : - Cutaneous (localized) Scleroderma or Morphea. Systemic sclerosis (generalized scleroderma). Cutaneous scleroderma (Morphea or localized scleroderma) Morphea is characterized by excessive collegen deposition leading to thickening of dermis, subcutaneous tissue or both. Internal organs are not involved (in contrast to system sclerosis). Morphea presents as dark, purple or bluish, firm indurated plaques. The most impoant skin finding is the induration of skin (which is felt inside -dermal induration) and hence inability to pinch skin (hidebound skin). Morphea is divided into : ? Plaque-type -4 Most common. occurs most commonly on lower trunk followed by extremities. Face is spared. Generalized-type --> When plaque type morphea involves 3 or more major anatomical ragions of chest (sternum), abdomen, lower back, buttock and thighs. Linear type Involves most commonly lower extremities followed by upper extremities, frontal poion of head (forehead) and anterior trunk. Frontoparietal linear morphea involves frontoparietal aspect of face and scalp: it is referred to as en coup de sabre. Deep morphea (Morphea profundus or subcutaneous morphea) It affects the subcutaneous tissue in contrast to other variant of morphea where dermis is involved primarily. Systemic sclerosis (Generalized scleroderma) Systemic sclerosis is generalized form of scleroderma, which involves internal organs along with skin. So, systemic sclerosis is a multisystem disorder. It is characterized by diffuse sclerosis of Skin predominantly affecting the acral region, i.e., hands, feet, finger, toes and face. Which leads to sclerodactyly and contractures in acral areas. Other manifestations are : - Raynaud's phenomenon --> Most common & earliest manifestation. Mask like face (expression less) Beaking of nose Thinning of lips. Mat like telangiectasia Salt-pepper dyschromatosis Periungual telangiectasia Calcinosis cutis on elbow, knuckles and malleoli. Calcinosis cutis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly and Telangiectasia occur together in CREST syndrome a variant of sclerodermea.

The primary cutaneous lesions are pruritic, polygonal, flat-topped, violaceous papules. Close examination of the surface of these papules often reveals a network of gray lines (Wickham's striae). The skin lesions may occur anywhere but have a predilection for the wrists, shins, lower back, and genitalia. Involvement of the scalp, lichen planopilaris, may lead to scarring alopecia, and nail involvement may lead to permanent deformity or loss of fingernails and toenails. LP commonly involves mucous membranes, paicularly the buccal mucosa, where it can present a spectrum of disease from a mild, white, reticulate eruption of the mucosa, to a severe, erosive stomatitis. Erosive stomatitis may persist for years and may be linked to an increased risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma. Ref: Harrison's Internal Medicine;Pa 2.

Distribution of lesion in both is much the same (i.e. seborrheic distribution including face, scalp and upper trunk) except that in PF the mucous membranes are almost always sparedQ. - Characteristic clinical lesions of PF are well demarcated, shallow erosions on an erythematous base with scales, crust formation, erythemaQ and sometimes surrounded with small vesicles along the borders. Patients often complain of both pain & burning in the leions. Eventually patient becomes erythrodermic with crusted, oozing & red skin. Sun exposure (UV rays), environmental stimuli (insect bites), auto immune diseases paicularly thymoma &/or myasthenia gravisQ, and drug exposure (eg drug containing thiol group like penicillamine, captopril, enalapril and non thiol drugs like penicillins, cephalosporins and piroxicams) may be associated and aggrevating factor. PF is generally less severe and carries better prognosis than PV. Histology (tzank smear) shows superficial acantholytic blisters just below stratum corneum and in granular layer. And DIM demonstrates autoantibodies against Dsg1Q. Because of lack of mucosal involvement autoantibodies against Dsg3 are not foundQ. Because of superifical cleavage, the small flaccid blisters rupture easily and PF rarely demonstrate intact blisters.",

        "exp": "Acne vulgaris is a common inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous glands. It is a self-limited disorder primarily of teenagers and young adults. The permissive factor for the expression of the disease in adolescence is the increase in sebum production by sebaceous glands after pubey. Small cysts, called comedones, form in hair follicles due to blockage of the follicular orifice by retention of keratinous material and sebum. The activity of bacteria (Proprionobacterium acnes) within the comedones releases free fatty acids from sebum, causes inflammation within the cyst, and results in rupture of the cyst wall. An inflammatory foreign-body reaction develops as result of extrusion of oily and keratinous debris from the cyst. The clinical hallmark of acne vulgaris is the comedone, which may be closed (whitehead) or open (blackhead). Comedones are usually accompanied by inflammatory lesions: papules, pustules, or nodules. The earliest lesions seen in adolescence are generally mildly inflamed or non-inflammatory comedones on the forehead. Subsequently, more typical inflammatory lesions develop on the cheeks, nose, and chin. The most common location for acne is the face, but involvement of the chest and back is common. Most disease remains mild and does not lead to scarring. Ref: 1) Harrison's Internal Medicine; Pa 2. Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases ; Section 9.

        "exp": "Ans. D: All of the above Histologic findings vary according to the type of leprosy. Indeterminate leprosy is characterized by a few cells cuffing the dermal appendages and neurovascular bundles and a few M leprae within cutaneous nerves. In TT leprosy, epithelioid cells, lymphocytes, and perhaps giant cells form noncaseating granulomas. Dermal nerves are destroyed. Normal skin organs (e.g., sweat glands, hair follicles) are lost. Bacilli are frequently absent or difficult to demonstrate. In LL leprosy, the epidermis is normal and the rete flattened. A clear space separates the epidermis from diffuse granulomatous reaction with macrophages; large, foamy histiocytes (Virchow or lepra cells); and many intracellular AFB, which are frequently found in spheroidal masses (i.e., globi). Epithelioid cells and giant cells are not found. Granulomas are most numerous around blood vessels, nerves, and skin appendages. In some cases, many plasma cells are found. Dermal nerves are easily visible. In BT leprosy, granulomas are epithelioid, with a preponderance of lymphocytes. Dermal nerves are mostly destroyed. Bacilli may be scanty or absent. In BB leprosy, granulomas are epithelioid, dermal nerves may be visible, and bacilli are seen more often than in BT leprosy. In BL leprosy, histiocytes form granulomas, dermal nerves are visible, and bacilli are seen in greater numbers than in other types. In a reversal reaction, epithelioid cells and lymphocytes form granulomas. Extracellular edema is noted in the collagen of the dermis with dilated lymphatics or a proliferation of fibrocytes. As reactions clear, lesions heal with reduction or eradication of bacilli. ENL reaction is characterized by a massive influx of polymorphonuclear cells. Complement and immunoglobulin may be deposited in a granular pattern around dermal vessels. Bacilli become more numerous. Histologic studies are not useful for assessing clinical activity because granuloma persists for a long time after clinical activity subsides.",

The disease is thought to be viral disease, is self limiting, and subsides in 6-12 weeks. The exact etiology is not known, but it is considered to be a viral disease; Human Herpes virus 6 (HHV 6) and Human Herpes virus 7 (HHV 7) may play a role. Clinical manifestations of P. rosea The disease stas with an upper respiratory prodrome or a mild flu. After 1-2 weeks, Annular erythmatous plaque appears on trunk that is referred to as mother patch or herald patch. Over the next 1-2 weeks, fresh patch appear all over the trunk, in a Christmas tree configuration or Fir tree Configration. The lesions are pinkish in white skin, hence the name rosea. However, on the dark Indian skin the lesions are skin coloured or brown. The most characteristic clue for the diagnosis is the presence of a fine scale at the edge of the lesion referrred to as centrifugal scale or collarette scales or cigarette paper scales.

It is thought to be due to an abnormal immune reaction provoked by a viral infection (such as hepatitis C) or a drug. Inflammatory cells seem to mistake the skin cells as foreign and attack them. Classical lichen planus is characterized by shiny, flat-topped, firm papules (bumps) varying from pin point size ('guttate') to larger than a centimetre. They are a purple colour and often are crossed by fine white lines (called 'Wickham's striae'). They may be close together or widespread, or grouped in lines (linear lichen planus) or rings (annular lichen planus). Linear lichen planus can be the result of scratching or injuring the skin. Although sometimes there are no symptoms, it is often very itchy. Lichen planus may affect any area, but is most often seen on the front of the wrists, lower back, and ankles. On the palms and soles the papules are firm and yellow. Very thick scaly patches are paicularly itchy and are most likely to arise around the ankles (hyperophic lichen planus).",

Porphyrins are impoant intermediates in biosynthesis of heme from glycine and succinyl CoA. Each step is controlled by specific enzyme. So, prophyrias are due to inherited or acquired deficiency of enzymes in heme bio-synthetic pathways (also called porphyrias pathway). They manifest with either neurological complications or skin problems (or rarely both). Based on the site of overproduction and accumulation of porphyrins, porphyrias are broadly classified as :? A. Acute (hepatic prophyria) Acute intermettant porphyria 5-ALA dehydratase deficiency Hereditary Coproporphyria Variegate porphyria Porphyria cutanea tarda B. Cutaneous (erythropoeitic) porphyria Erythropeitic protoporphyria Congenital erythropoeitic porphyria X-linked sideroblastic Anemia The acute (hepatic) porphyrias primarily affect nervous system resulting in abdominal pain, vomiting, acute neuropathy, seizures, muscle weakenss, psychiatric/mental symptoms (i.e., Hallucination, depression, anxiety, paronoia); and autonomic nervous disturbances like hypeension, tachycardia, constipation, arrhythmias, sweating. The cutaneous (erythropoietic) porphyrias primarily affect skin causing photosensitivity (photodermatitis) blisters, itching, maculopapular rash. There is no abdominal pain. There are some variation in above presentation. Following two types of hepatic (acute) porphyrias also affect skin : - Hereditary coproporphyria and varigated porphyria. Therefore these two have both neuropsychiatric as well as skin manifestations. Porphyria cutanea tarda (a hepatic porphyria) does not have neuropsychiatric symptom, rather it has only skin manifestation.

Which of the following findings would suggest the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris as opposed to bullous pemphigoid?",
        "exp": "Pemphigus vulgaris is associated with chronic, severe bullae formation on the skin and oral mucosa. Mucosal lesions are extremely rare in bullous pemphigoid. This can be used clinically to guide therapy, although a skin biopsy should be taken to confirm the diagnosis. Both diseases are characterized by formation of tender bullae that can rupture,leaving red, raw areas. Pemphigus vulgaris patients eventually became febrile and lose weight, and if untreated, most will die within one year. Bullous pemphigoid lesions tend to heal and the patients do very well. This prognostic difference is an impoant distinction in dermatological medicine. Eosinophils within blisters provide an impoant clue suppoing bullous pemphigoid as the diagnosis which must be asceained with histologic examination. The vesicles in pemphigus vulgaris mostly contain rounded acantholytic keratinocytes \"floating\" within. IgA deposits seen with immunofluorescence on the basement membrane is characteristic of a third bullae-forming disease known as dermatitis herpetiformis. Vesicles form between the dermal-epidermal junction. The disease is associated with gluten sensitivity and celiac disease. IgG autoantibody activity is common to both pemphigus vulgaris and bullous pemphigoid. Ref: Payne A.S., Stanley J.R. (2012). Chapter 54. Pemphigus. In K.

The former usually stas at the hands and forearms, presumptive sites of contact, but depigmentation at a distance is also possible. Chemical leukoderma spreads by coalescence of small macules, whereas the sudden appearance of large patches with perifollicular sparing is more suggestive of vitiligo.

C: PsoriasisDithranol (cytostatic agent) is used as a topical therapy agent in psoriasis Dithranol/ An thralinIt is a Hydroxyanthrone, anthracene derivativeApplied to the skin of people with psoriasis.It is available as creams, ointment or pastes in 0.1 to 2% strengthsThe terms dithranol and anthralin are sometimes used synonymouslyDithranol accumulates in mitochondria where it interferes with the supply of energy to the cell, probably by the oxidation of dithranol releasing free radicals.This impedes DNA replication and so slows the excessive cell division that occurs in psoriatic plaques. In addition Dithranol may act by reducing the elevated levels of cGMP that occurs in psoriasis.The anti-proliferative effects of anthralin appear to result from both an inhibition of DNA synthesis as well as from its strong reducing propeies.Unlike retinoids and PUVA, anthralin does not inhibit liver microsomal enzyme activityConsequently, the likelihood of adverse drug interactions is greatly reduced when other agents are administered concomitantly with anthralin.Dithranol has a slower onset of action in controlling psoriasis, typically several weeks, compared to glucocoicoid steroids, but is without the potential for rebound reaction on withdrawal.It cannot be used on the face or genitalia.It temporarily stains the skin a yellowy-brown and permanently stains clothing fabrics.It may cause a local burning sensation and irritation",

The disease is thought to be viral disease, is self limiting, and subsides in 6-12 weeks.

Clinical manifestations of P. rosea The disease stas with an upper respiratory prodrome or a mild flu. After 1-2 weeks, Annular erythmatous plaque appears on trunk that is referred to as mother patch or herald patch. o Over the next 1-2 weeks, fresh patch appear all over the trunk, in a Christmas tree configuration or Fir tree Configration. The lesions are pinkish in white skin, hence the name rosea. However, on the dark Indian skin the lesions are skin coloured or brown.

Nevus anaemicus - Developmental, solitary (unilateral) white (pale) round flat patch, usually on trunk and present at bih. It is stable (i.e. does not increase in size). Thought to have vascular filling defect. - Massage fails to develop erythema in lesionQ. Pressure with glass slide makes the lesion disappear & indistinct from surrounding skin. Hypomelanosis of Ito (Linear nevoid hypopigmentation/ Pigmentary Mosacism/ Incontinentia pigmenti achromians of Ito) - This neurocutaneous disorder results from migration of 2 clones of melanocytes, each with a different pigment potential. - It may present with widespread bilateral (symmetrical) or unilateral areas of hypopigmentation in form of whorls (swirls) and streaks occurring along Blaschko's lines. - One third cases are associated with abnormalities involving musculoskeletal system (asymmetry), CNS (convulsions & mental retardation), teeth, and eyes (hypeelorism & strabismus).

BP is the most common subtype and involves blisters below the surface of the skin, but can also affect mucous membranes. CP most commonly affects the mucous membrane in the body In Bullous Pemphigoid, autoantibodies are directed against the normal components of hemidesmosomes, BP180 and BP230.

If left untreated, 50% of cases develop infected lymph glands, which become large, hard painful lumps (buboes), on either one or both sides of the groin. The site of most infections in men is the foreskin but other pas of the penis may be affected. In women, ulcers may be located on the labia, thigh, perineum and cervix.

B: Munro's micro-abscesses, parakeratosis, and epidermal hyperplasia Psoriasis is a common, relapsing chronic inflammatory condition affecting about 1.5-3% of the world's population, causing significant morbidity. The presence of a well-defined margin and a silvery white scale, over a glossy homogenous membrane, is clinically diagnostic of psoriasis. The successive removal of the psoriatic scales usually reveals an underlying, smooth, glossy red membrane with multiple bleeding points where thin suprapapillary epithelium is torn off (Auspitz's sign). When the scaling is not evident, it can be induced by light tangential scratching with the edge of glass slide (Grattage). Psoriasis often involves nails, scalp, mucosae, and joints, as well. Parakeratosis (nuclei retained in the horny layer), dilated blood vessels, regular epidermal hyperplasia (regular acanthosis), and presence of Munro microabscess and/or Kogoj's abscess have been described to be the most constant or characteristic histopathological features in skin biospy of psoriasis. Similarly, spongiosis, irregular epidermal hyperplasia, and absence of Munro micro and Kogoj's abscess have been found consistently in psoriasiform dermatitis Moreover, the \"diagnostic\" histopathological findings of psoriasis, namely, Kogoj's spongiform pustules and Munro microabscess, can also be seen in dermatophytoses, candida infection, and others.",

Usually affects young adults. Clinical features There are multiple scaly hypopigmented (more common) or hyperpigmented macules. Scaling is fufuraciousor rice powder like. Macules sta around the hair follicles and they merge with each other to form large areas. Affects trunk and shoulders (mainly chest and back). There may be loosening of scales with finger nails- coupled onle or stroke of nail. Lesions are recurrent in nature. Diagnosis Examination of scales in 10% KOH shows sho hyphae and round spores (sphagetti and meat ball appearance). Wood's lamp shows apple green fluorescence(blue-green fluorescnce). Skin surface biopsy - a cyanoacrylate adhesive is used to separate the layer of stratum corneum on glass slide and then stained with PAS reagent. Treatment Systemic agents :- systemic azoles provide convenient therapeutic option. Drugs used are ketokonazole, fluconazole or iatroconazole Topical antifungals used are ?

Cockayne's syndrome Cockayne's syndrome is AR degenerative disease with cutaneous (photosensitivity, premature skin aging), ocular (pigmentary retinal degeneration with salt-peper appearance of retina, optic atropy and cataract), neurological (sensorineural deafness, progressive neurological degeneration, extensive primary demyelination, peripheral neuropathy, normal pressure hydrocephalus, microcephaly, intellectual deterioration) and somatic abnormalities (postnatal growth failure, cachectic dwarfism with dispropoionately long limbs with large hands and feet and ears). Child usually appears normal for the first year, when photosensitive butterfly facial erythema develop 1/ t mottled pigmentation, atrophic scars giving patient a prematurely senile appearance which is enhanced by marked loss of subcutaneous fat on face (wizened appearance) and sunken eyes with typical bird headed facies and prominent Mickey mouse ear. In contrast to xerodema pigmentosa, CS don't have increased incidence of skin cancer and infection and the CS patients have unusual facies, demyelination with delayed nerve conduction velocity and normal level of global NER. Rothmund Thomson Syndrome Rothmund Thomson syndrome (congenital poikiloderma), an AR disorder is characterized by poikiloderma with variegated cutaneous pigmentation, atrophy and telangiectasia beginning in infancy (but not bih). Cheeks are fist and most severly involved but face, buttock and extremities are also involved. Photosensitive erythema and facial smelling may be accompanied by blister formation. Scalp hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, pubic and axillary hair are often sparse or absent. Juvenile cataract (b/l), propoionate stunted growth with slender delicate limb, small hands, feet and finger; bird like small skull with a saddle nose, skelatel abnormalities including radial ray defect (present as thumb hypoplasia, abnormal radial head or absence of radius) and a predisposition for cancer especially osteosarcoma (30%). Intelligence is normal and life expectancy depends on development of cancer; otherwise it appears to be normal.",

The skin of the hands may be edematous or swollen early in the disease, and the patient may initially repo this as puffy changes. This edematous stage precedes the indurated sclerotic stage; longer time to progression to the sclerotic phase indicates a better prognosis. In the sclerotic phase, the skin may appear tight and shiny, with a characteristic loss of hair, decreased sweating, and loss of the ability to make a skin fold.

It is common to find other individuals especially children staying in same house also showing similar features. In infants, eczematization is very common and it leads to exudation and crusting especially on the wrist and ankle. Secondary infection leads to pustule, crust fever and lymphadenopathy. Involvement of palm & soles, duration of < 6 weeks (2 weeks) and presence of same lesions in mother, our the diagnosis of scabies. Scabies Intense itching even in presence of minor physical signs The physical sign are essentially those of eczema & effects of scratching. Vesicles are seen but excoriations and prurigo-like papules are more common. Pathognomic lesion is burrow or run (in stratum corneum); which is a tiny, raised, linear or serpiginous white mark. The best sites to find burrows are palms & interdigital areas of fingers, flexural creases and over the elbows. Other common sites of involvement are - anterior axillary fold, buttock fold, areola of breast, lower abdomen, genitalia, knees, ankle and soles. Head and neck is involved in infants only. Same type of lesion may also present in family members.

The fluid is placed on a glass slide and stained by using the Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast method or the Fite method to look for organisms. The bacterial index (BI) is then determined as the number of organisms at 100X with oil immersion. Skin smears have high specificity but low sensitivity because 70% of all patients with leprosy have negative smear results. However, this test is useful because it detects the most infectious patients. Presence of AFB in suggestive skin lesions, even in the absence of sensory deficit, confirms the diagnosis of leprosy.

It leads to a characteristic pruritic, papular, violaceous eruption of polygonal shape and is often covered with fine scales. Lichen planus most commonly leads to thick patchy rough, scaly skin that develops on the flexor surfaces of the upper extremities, around the ankles, in the genital region genitalia, and on the mucous membranes and is itchy in nature. It causes scarring alopecia leading permanent hair damage. Taenia capitis - It is a fungal dermatophyte infection of the scalp and hair caused especially by the Trichophyton and Microsporum. It causes contagious non-scarring alopecia. It causes inflammatory lesions such as pustules, scaling and itching. The hallmark of diagnosis is patches of hair loss with a \"black-dot\" pattern on examination. The clinical diagnosis is confirmed by mycological examination. Androgenic alopecia - It is an autosomal dominant disorder which is the most common cause of alopecia in both men and women. It causes miniaturisation of the hair follicles which is androgen dependent and caused by scalp dihydrotestosterone. There is a typical shoening of the hair cycle leading to increased numbers of anagen hairs entering the telogen phase and thus leading to premature hair fall. It leads to scarring alopecia. Alopecia areata - It is a inflammatory non-scarring alopecia of auto-immune origin. There is a inappropriate immune response due to the hair follicle associated antigens. The patient presents with well - demarcated patches of reversible hair loss. Histologically there is a typical peribulbar lymphocyte infiltration. The disturbance of hair shaft growth leads to characteristic exclamation point hairs which is the hallmark for diagnosis.

        "exp": "In this case, diagnosis can be made by excluding each option. This patient is least likely to have scabies, as it does not produce lesions on the face in adults. Atopic dermatitis is unlikely since he is giving a history of similar lesions only since 3 years. In atopic dermatitis lesions first appears in infancy and then continues into childhood and adulthood. By this time lesions become more and more lichenified. Uicaria is characterised by the presence of evanescent wheals due to edema of dermis, and it last only for 24- 48 hours. So the most appropriate diagnosis would be insect bite hypersensitivity. In this condition the characteristic lesions are itchy persistent papules with a central punctum, seen mainly on exposed pas of the body and aggrevated during rainy season.",
