Molluscum contagiosum It is a common viral infection in children. It is caused by pox virus, i. e., Molluscum contagiosum virus. It is characterized by multiple pearly white, dome-shaped papules which are umbilicated centrally. On using a hand lens, many of the papules has a mosaic appearance. Epidermal cells contain eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Molluscum or Henderso-Paterson bodies). Autoinoculation can give rise to lesions arranged linearly along line of trauma ----> pseudoismorphic (pseudokoebner's) phenomenon. M. C. may involve any pa of the body In children face is involved most commonly. Anogenital molluscum contagiosum is a STD.

        "exp": "This is a case of Lupus vulgaris. Lupus vulgaris is a rare, chronic, progressive form of cutaneous tuberculosis that develops as a result of direct extension from underlying joints or lymph nodes; through lymphatic or hematogenous spread; or, rarely, by cutaneous inoculation with BCG vaccine. It most commonly follows cervical adenitis or pulmonary tuberculosis. Approximately 33% of cases are preceded by scrofuloderma, and 90% of cases present on the head and neck, most commonly on the nose or cheek. Involvement of the trunk is uncommon. A typical solitary lesion consists of a soft, brownish-red papule that has an apple-jelly color when examined by diascopy. One or several lesions may develop, including nodules or plaques that are flat and serpiginous, hyperophic and verrucous, or edematous in appearance. Spontaneous healing occurs centrally, and lesions characteristically reappear within the area of atrophy. Lymphadenitis is present in 40% of those with lupus vulgaris. Squamous cell carcinoma, with a relatively high metastatic potential, may develop, usually after several years of the disease. After a temporary impairment in immunity, paicularly after measles infection (lupus exanthematicus), multiple lesions may form at distant sites as a result of hematogenous spread from a latent focus of infection. Histologic examination and a positive culture for M. tuberculosis/bovis confirm the diagnosis. The tuberculin test is strongly positive except for the early phases of post-exanthematic lupus. Acid-fast bacilli are usually not found on histopathological examination. Small lesions can be excised. Antituberculous drug therapy usually halts fuher spread and induces involution.

That is why, histology (tzanck smear) show (intra) epidermal acantholytic bullae (blister) in deep supra basal layer of epidermisQ along with single layer of intact stratum basale cells attached to basement membrane (row of tomb stone appearance) that form the base of blister. Indirect immuno fluorescence microscopy demonstrate circulating autoantibodies against keratinocyte cell surface antigen whereas diagnostic (gold standard) direct immunofluorescence microscopy (DIM) show deposits of IgG on the surface keratinocyte in fishnet like patternQ and in intercellular space (causing it to widen). Pemphigus vulgaris presents as muco-cutaneous lesions (blister or erosions) predominantly in middle aged patients (> 40 year age). It typically begins on mucosal surface and nearly all patients have mucosal involvement (oral in 70% Q >> ocular, nasal, pharyngeal, larynx, oesophagus, urethra, vulva, cervix).

Scleroderma is classified into: - Cutaneous (localized) Scleroderma or Morphea. Systemic sclerosis (generalized scleroderma). Cutaneous scleroderma (Morphea or localized scleroderma) Morphea is characterized by excessive collegen deposition leading to thickening of dermis, subcutaneous tissue or both. Internal organs are not involved (in contrast to system sclerosis). Morphea presents as dark, purple or bluish, firm indurated plaques. The most impoant skin finding is the induration of skin (which is felt inside -dermal induration) and hence inability to pinch skin (hidebound skin). Morphea is divided into:? Plaque-type -4 Most common. occurs most commonly on lower trunk followed by extremities. Face is spared. Generalized-type --> When plaque type morphea involves 3 or more major anatomical ragions of chest (sternum), abdomen, lower back, buttock and thighs. Linear type Involves most commonly lower extremities followed by upper extremities, frontal poion of head (forehead) and anterior trunk. Frontoparietal linear morphea involves frontoparietal aspect of face and scalp: it is referred to as en coup de sabre. Deep morphea (Morphea profundus or subcutaneous morphea) It affects the subcutaneous tissue in contrast to other variant of morphea where dermis is involved primarily. Systemic sclerosis (Generalized scleroderma) Systemic sclerosis is generalized form of scleroderma, which involves internal organs along with skin. So, systemic sclerosis is a multisystem disorder. It is characterized by diffuse sclerosis of Skin predominantly affecting the acral region, i. e., hands, feet, finger, toes and face. Which leads to sclerodactyly and contractures in acral areas. Other manifestations are: - Raynaud's phenomenon --> Most common & earliest manifestation. Mask like face (expression less) Beaking of nose Thinning of lips. Mat like telangiectasia Salt-pepper dyschromatosis Periungual telangiectasia Calcinosis cutis on elbow, knuckles and malleoli.

The primary cutaneous lesions are pruritic, polygonal, flat-topped, violaceous papules. Close examination of the surface of these papules often reveals a network of gray lines (Wickham's striae). The skin lesions may occur anywhere but have a predilection for the wrists, shins, lower back, and genitalia. Involvement of the scalp, lichen planopilaris, may lead to scarring alopecia, and nail involvement may lead to permanent deformity or loss of fingernails and toenails. LP commonly involves mucous membranes, paicularly the buccal mucosa, where it can present a spectrum of disease from a mild, white, reticulate eruption of the mucosa, to a severe, erosive stomatitis. Erosive stomatitis may persist for years and may be linked to an increased risk of oral squamous cell carcinoma. Ref: Harrison's Internal Medicine; Pa 2.

The permissive factor for the expression of the disease in adolescence is the increase in sebum production by sebaceous glands after pubey. Small cysts, called comedones, form in hair follicles due to blockage of the follicular orifice by retention of keratinous material and sebum. The activity of bacteria (Proprionobacterium acnes) within the comedones releases free fatty acids from sebum, causes inflammation within the cyst, and results in rupture of the cyst wall. An inflammatory foreign-body reaction develops as result of extrusion of oily and keratinous debris from the cyst. The clinical hallmark of acne vulgaris is the comedone, which may be closed (whitehead) or open (blackhead). Comedones are usually accompanied by inflammatory lesions: papules, pustules, or nodules. The earliest lesions seen in adolescence are generally mildly inflamed or non-inflammatory comedones on the forehead. Subsequently, more typical inflammatory lesions develop on the cheeks, nose, and chin. The most common location for acne is the face, but involvement of the chest and back is common. Most disease remains mild and does not lead to scarring. Ref: 1) Harrison's Internal Medicine; Pa 2. Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases; Section 9.

These lesions have the distinctive appearance described in the question stem, and tend to occur on sun-exposed areas including the face, the forearm, and the dorsum of the hand. These lesions microscopically closely resemble squamous cell carcinoma, but are now considered benign. They may resolve spontaneously, and some authors suggest that they may not need resection. However, they are usually resected since both patient and physician often feel uncomfoable with neglecting them without having a definitive diagnosis and being absolutely ceain they will spontaneously regress. Lipoma causes a soft subcutaneous mass. Malignant melanoma usually causes a pigmented lesion, often with feathery edges suggesting invasion. Pyogenic granuloma causes a red mass, often at a site of previous injury. Ref: Cerroni L., Kerl H. (2012). Chapter 117. Keratoacanthoma. In K.

Characterized by round/oval pink brown patches with a superficial, centrifugal scale, distributed over trunk in a Christmas tree pattern. The disease is thought to be viral disease, is self limiting, and subsides in 6-12 weeks. The exact etiology is not known, but it is considered to be a viral disease; Human Herpes virus 6 (HHV 6) and Human Herpes virus 7 (HHV 7) may play a role. Clinical manifestations of P. rosea The disease stas with an upper respiratory prodrome or a mild flu. After 1-2 weeks, Annular erythmatous plaque appears on trunk that is referred to as mother patch or herald patch. Over the next 1-2 weeks, fresh patch appear all over the trunk, in a Christmas tree configuration or Fir tree Configration. The lesions are pinkish in white skin, hence the name rosea. However, on the dark Indian skin the lesions are skin coloured or brown. The most characteristic clue for the diagnosis is the presence of a fine scale at the edge of the lesion referrred to as centrifugal scale or collarette scales or cigarette paper scales.

It is thought to be due to an abnormal immune reaction provoked by a viral infection (such as hepatitis C) or a drug. Inflammatory cells seem to mistake the skin cells as foreign and attack them. Classical lichen planus is characterized by shiny, flat-topped, firm papules (bumps) varying from pin point size ('guttate') to larger than a centimetre. They are a purple colour and often are crossed by fine white lines (called 'Wickham's striae'). They may be close together or widespread, or grouped in lines (linear lichen planus) or rings (annular lichen planus). Linear lichen planus can be the result of scratching or injuring the skin. Although sometimes there are no symptoms, it is often very itchy. Lichen planus may affect any area, but is most often seen on the front of the wrists, lower back, and ankles. On the palms and soles the papules are firm and yellow. Very thick scaly patches are paicularly itchy and are most likely to arise around the ankles (hyperophic lichen planus).",

Porphyrins are impoant intermediates in biosynthesis of heme from glycine and succinyl CoA. Each step is controlled by specific enzyme. So, prophyrias are due to inherited or acquired deficiency of enzymes in heme bio-synthetic pathways (also called porphyrias pathway). They manifest with either neurological complications or skin problems (or rarely both). Based on the site of overproduction and accumulation of porphyrins, porphyrias are broadly classified as:? A. Acute (hepatic prophyria) Acute intermettant porphyria 5-ALA dehydratase deficiency Hereditary Coproporphyria Variegate porphyria Porphyria cutanea tarda B. Cutaneous (erythropoeitic) porphyria Erythropeitic protoporphyria Congenital erythropoeitic porphyria X-linked sideroblastic Anemia The acute (hepatic) porphyrias primarily affect nervous system resulting in abdominal pain, vomiting, acute neuropathy, seizures, muscle weakenss, psychiatric/mental symptoms (i. e., Hallucination, depression, anxiety, paronoia); and autonomic nervous disturbances like hypertension, tachycardia, constipation, arrhythmias, sweating. The cutaneous (erythropoietic) porphyrias primarily affect skin causing photosensitivity (photodermatitis) blisters, itching, maculopapular rash. There is no abdominal pain. There are some variation in above presentation. Following two types of hepatic (acute) porphyrias also affect skin: - Hereditary coproporphyria and varigated porphyria. Therefore these two have both neuropsychiatric as well as skin manifestations. Porphyria cutanea tarda (a hepatic porphyria) does not have neuropsychiatric symptom, rather it has only skin manifestation.

Both diseases are characterized by formation of tender bullae that can rupture, leaving red, raw areas. Pemphigus vulgaris patients eventually became febrile and lose weight, and if untreated, most will die within one year. Bullous pemphigoid lesions tend to heal and the patients do very well. This prognostic difference is an impoant distinction in dermatological medicine. Eosinophils within blisters provide an impoant clue suppoing bullous pemphigoid as the diagnosis which must be asceained with histologic examination.

Applied to the skin of people with psoriasis. It is available as creams, ointment or pastes in 0. 1 to 2% strengths. The terms dithranol and anthralin are sometimes used synonymously. Dithranol accumulates in mitochondria where it interferes with the supply of energy to the cell, probably by the oxidation of dithranol releasing free radicals. This impedes DNA replication and so slows the excessive cell division that occurs in psoriatic plaques. In addition Dithranol may act by reducing the elevated levels of c. GMP that occurs in psoriasis. The anti-proliferative effects of anthralin appear to result from both an inhibition of DNA synthesis as well as from its strong reducing propeies. Unlike retinoids and PUVA, anthralin does not inhibit liver microsomal enzyme activity. Consequently, the likelihood of adverse drug interactions is greatly reduced when other agents are administered concomitantly with anthralin. Dithranol has a slower onset of action in controlling psoriasis, typically several weeks, compared to glucocoicoid steroids, but is without the potential for rebound reaction on withdrawal. It cannot be used on the face or genitalia. It temporarily stains the skin a yellowy-brown and permanently stains clothing fabrics. It may cause a local burning sensation and irritation",

The lesions are pinkish in white skin, hence the name rosea. However, on the dark Indian skin the lesions are skin coloured or brown.

Hairs within the lesiosn are usually depigmented. Histology shows normal or reduced number of melanocytes. 3 variants of lesion are single (mc), segmental and systematized (very rare). - Erythema appears on massage - Pressure with glass slide does not make the lesion disappear.

Thought to have vascular filling defect. - Massage fails to develop erythema in lesionQ. Pressure with glass slide makes the lesion disappear & indistinct from surrounding skin. Hypomelanosis of Ito (Linear nevoid hypopigmentation/ Pigmentary Mosacism/ Incontinentia pigmenti achromians of Ito) - This neurocutaneous disorder results from migration of 2 clones of melanocytes, each with a different pigment potential. - It may present with widespread bilateral (symmetrical) or unilateral areas of hypopigmentation in form of whorls (swirls) and streaks occurring along Blaschko's lines. - One third cases are associated with abnormalities involving musculoskeletal system (asymmetry), CNS (convulsions & mental retardation), teeth, and eyes (hypeelorism & strabismus). Bilateral Piebaldism - It is AD condition characterized by congenital stable areas of vitiligo like amelanotic skin with white forelock. - Amelanotic patches of skin totally devoid of pigment are present at bih (congenital) and remain unchanged throughout life (stable)Q. - Frontal median or paramedian patch with a mesh of white hair (white foelock) is most common lesion; rest of scalp hair are pigmented. - Often, white patches occur bilaterally mostly but not necessarily (always) symmetrically on ventral trunk (chest & abdomen) and limbs (upper & lower extremities). Occasionally they are found on face esp. chin - Back as well as hands and feet (acral area) remain normally pigmented (acral sparing). - Islands of normal or hypermelanotic skin occur in white depigmented areasQ. - Piebaldism can be distinguished from vitiligo (where the lesions are acquired later in life) by almost invariable presence of white forelock and islands of normal pigmented skin in hypomelanotic areasQ as well as configuration & distribution of lesions. - Piebaldism may be associated with 2 systemic neurocristopathies d/t abnormal embryonic migration or survival of 2 neural crest derived elements, one being melanocytes and other myenteric ganglion cells (IA Hirschprung disease in Shah-Waardenburg syndrome) or auditory nerve cells (1/t sensorineural deafness in Waardenburg's syndrome).

Rosacea is a centrofacial disease, i. e., it involves the central face -Cheeks, Chin, Forehead, Nose, making typical cruciate pattern of involvement. Periorbital & perioral areas are spared. Clinical features are intermittant flushing followed by more permanent erythma and telangiectasia. On this back-ground, erythmatous papules, papulo pustules and rarely nodules develop. Lesions may be exacerbated by light (photosensitive) and spicy foods. Complications are:? Rhinophyma: - Rhinophyma is large, bulbous, ruddy appearance of nose caused by granulomatous infiltration of skin. It is slowly progressive condition due to hyperophy of sebaceous gland on the tip of nose. It is also known as Potato nose. Ophthalmologic: - Blephritis, Conjuctivits, Keratitis,.

B: Munro's micro-abscesses, parakeratosis, and epidermal hyperplasia Psoriasis is a common, relapsing chronic inflammatory condition affecting about 1. 5-3% of the world's population, causing significant morbidity. The presence of a well-defined margin and a silvery white scale, over a glossy homogenous membrane, is clinically diagnostic of psoriasis. The successive removal of the psoriatic scales usually reveals an underlying, smooth, glossy red membrane with multiple bleeding points where thin suprapapillary epithelium is torn off (Auspitz's sign). When the scaling is not evident, it can be induced by light tangential scratching with the edge of glass slide (Grattage). Psoriasis often involves nails, scalp, mucosae, and joints, as well. Parakeratosis (nuclei retained in the horny layer), dilated blood vessels, regular epidermal hyperplasia (regular acanthosis), and presence of Munro microabscess and/or Kogoj's abscess have been described to be the most constant or characteristic histopathological features in skin biospy of psoriasis. Similarly, spongiosis, irregular epidermal hyperplasia, and absence of Munro micro and Kogoj's abscess have been found consistently in psoriasiform dermatitis Moreover, the \"diagnostic\" histopathological findings of psoriasis, namely, Kogoj's spongiform pustules and Munro microabscess, can also be seen in dermatophytoses, candida infection, and others.",

However, it is not 100% specific for mastocytosis as it is also rarely seen in juvenile Xanthogranuloma and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia of neonates. Uicaria Pigmentosa (UP)/Mastocytosis - Mastocytosis is mast cell hyperplasia in 1 organs: bone marrow, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract and skin. So mast cell activation may produce symptoms like, pruritis, flushing, uication, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, musculo skeletal pain, vascular instability, headache and neuropsychiatric difficulties. UP (a type of cutaneous mastocytosis) is the most common manifestation of mastocytosis, both in adults & children. - Numerous pale yellow tan to reddish brown monomorphic macules or slightly raised papules develop in a symmetrical distributions anywhere on the body with generally less involvement of the sun exposed areas, with the highest concentration usually being on the trunk and thighsQ. Also generally spared (or less involved) are face, scalp, head, palms & soles. - The edges of lesion are not completely sharp. It is not uncommon for lesion to become pigmented, hence name uicaria pigmentosa. - Development of uicaria, erythema & itching around the lesion after mild trauma, including scratching or rubbing of lesionQ is called Darier Sign. It is seen in UP. - Climatic temperature, skin friction, ingestion of hot beverages, spicy foods, alcohol, opioids or other drugs may cause histamine release from mast cells and exacerbate mastocytosis - 3 types/ forms of UP are Juvenile type develop mostly in P, year of life and usually remits spontaneously during adolescence Adult papular type persists. Adult telangiectasia macularis eruptive perstans of Parker & Weber: in which telangiectatic macules sta to appear, persist and increase in number over the years. Uicarial Vasculitis - An impoant characteristic of uicaria is its transience but rarerly it may stay for days rather than hours & leave a brownish stain - It is due to involvement of small vessels - Vasculitis uicari typically persist longer than 72 hours, where as conventional uicaria often has a duration of less than 24 -48 hours. Fixed drug Erruption - Inflamatory patches appear within hours at the same sites on every occasionQ the drug is administered Leave pigmentation - Common drugs are dapsone, tetracycline, sulfonamides, mefenimic acid.",

Pustular psoriasis in pregnancy is called impetigo herpatiformis. In pregnancy, safest drug for treatment of pustular psoriasis is prednisoloneQ.

It presents with development of generalized pustules all over the bodyQ. Erythematous skin rash with multiple pus lakes suggests a diagnosis of generalized pustular psoriasis. As retinoids, methotrexate & PUVA cannot be used (or contraindicated) in pregnancy. Coicosteroids form the mainstay of treatment for generalized pustular psoriasis in pregnancyQ.

Reticular acropimentation of kitamura presents with reticular freckle like pigmentation on dorsal hands, palmar pitsQ and breakage of epidermal ridge pattern. Cockayne's syndrome, Bloom's syndrome and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome are genodermatoses with defective DNA repairing, presenting as photo sensitivity. Dowling-Degos disease Dowling-Degos disease (reticular pigmented anomaly of flexures) is a rare autosomal dominant genodermatoses usually presenting post pubeally with multiple small, round pigmented macules that resemble freckles. Pigmentation is symmetrical and progressive; and the lesions become progressively more numerous and reticulate with time. It characteristically involves flexurals areasQ e. g: axillae, groins (mc sites), intergluteal/ infra-mammary folds, neck, scalp, trunk, arms and genitals. Except pigmentation, it is otherwise asymptomatic (rarely pruritic). Scattered comedo like lesions (dark dot follicles) pitted acneiform scars near angels of mouthQ and hidradenitis suppurativa are other features. Histology is diagnostic, with a distinctive form of acanthosis, characterized by an irregular elongation of rete ridges, with a concentration of melanin at the tips (filiform down growths in epidermis with hyperpigmentation of deepest areas); the melanocyte count being normal. It involves follicular infundibulum with follicular plugging in some cases. Reticulate acropigmentation of Kitamura Reticulate acropigmentation of kitamura is characterized by a reticulate network of freckle like areas of pigmentation which develop on dorsa of hands in first 2 decades, which may subsequently involve most pas of body. Palmar pits and breakages of epidermal ridge pattern are foundQ. Histologically, the pigmented macules show epidermal atrophy and increased number of melanocytes. Hereditary symmetrical dyskeratosis of extremities (reticulate acropimentation of Dohi) is AD disorder presenting in infancy or early childhood as mottled pigmentation with areas of depigmentation on dorsa of hands and feet or arms and legs. Haber's syndrome - Haber's syndrome is a familial condition characterized by persistent/permanent rosacea like eruption (i. e. facial flushing, erythema, telangiectasia, prominent follicles, comedones, small papules and tiny atrophic pitted areas) associated in some cases with static, scaly/keratotic, flat, non-indurated plaques on trunk and limbs. Bloom's syndrome Bloom's syndrome (congenital telangiectatic erythema and stunted growth) is a AR disorder characterized by photosensitive telagiestatic facial erythema during infancy or early childhood (superficially resembling lupus erythematosus), moderate and propoionate growth deficiency both in utero and postnatally, unusual facies (narrow, slender, delicate face with a narrow, prominent nose, hypoplastic malar areas, receding chin and microcephaly and dolichocephaly i. e. long and narrow head). Patients are predisposed to multiple infection (d/t immune dysfunction) and early cancers (usually interanal) lit early death (usually neurological development is normal; diabetes mellitus and testicular atrophy are common. Cockayne's syndrome Cockayne's syndrome is AR degenerative disease with cutaneous (photosensitivity, premature skin aging), ocular (pigmentary retinal degeneration with salt-peper appearance of retina, optic atropy and cataract), neurological (sensorineural deafness, progressive neurological degeneration, extensive primary demyelination, peripheral neuropathy, normal pressure hydrocephalus, microcephaly, intellectual deterioration) and somatic abnormalities (postnatal growth failure, cachectic dwarfism with dispropoionately long limbs with large hands and feet and ears). Child usually appears normal for the first year, when photosensitive butterfly facial erythema develop 1/ t mottled pigmentation, atrophic scars giving patient a prematurely senile appearance which is enhanced by marked loss of subcutaneous fat on face (wizened appearance) and sunken eyes with typical bird headed facies and prominent Mickey mouse ear. In contrast to xerodema pigmentosa, CS don't have increased incidence of skin cancer and infection and the CS patients have unusual facies, demyelination with delayed nerve conduction velocity and normal level of global NER.

The skin of the hands may be edematous or swollen early in the disease, and the patient may initially repo this as puffy changes. This edematous stage precedes the indurated sclerotic stage; longer time to progression to the sclerotic phase indicates a better prognosis. In the sclerotic phase, the skin may appear tight and shiny, with a characteristic loss of hair, decreased sweating, and loss of the ability to make a skin fold.

In infants, eczematization is very common and it leads to exudation and crusting especially on the wrist and ankle. Secondary infection leads to pustule, crust fever and lymphadenopathy. Involvement of palm & soles, duration of < 6 weeks (2 weeks) and presence of same lesions in mother, our the diagnosis of scabies. Scabies Intense itching even in presence of minor physical signs The physical sign are essentially those of eczema & effects of scratching. Vesicles are seen but excoriations and prurigo-like papules are more common. Pathognomic lesion is burrow or run (in stratum corneum); which is a tiny, raised, linear or serpiginous white mark. The best sites to find burrows are palms & interdigital areas of fingers, flexural creases and over the elbows. Other common sites of involvement are - anterior axillary fold, buttock fold, areola of breast, lower abdomen, genitalia, knees, ankle and soles. Head and neck is involved in infants only. Same type of lesion may also present in family members.

Atopic dermatitis is unlikely since he is giving a history of similar lesions only since 3 years. In atopic dermatitis lesions first appears in infancy and then continues into childhood and adulthood. By this time lesions become more and more lichenified. Uicaria is characterised by the presence of evanescent wheals due to edema of dermis, and it last only for 24- 48 hours. So the most appropriate diagnosis would be insect bite hypersensitivity. In this condition the characteristic lesions are itchy persistent papules with a central punctum, seen mainly on exposed pas of the body and aggrevated during rainy season.",
