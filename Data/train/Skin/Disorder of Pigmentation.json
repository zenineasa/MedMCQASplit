Eczema and non infectious immunodeficiency disorders. In: James WD. Berger TG, Elston DM. editors. Andrew's diseases of the skin: Clinical Dermatology, 11th edn., China: Saunders Elsevier 2011: 62-87. Explanation: Patch test - Application of allergens suspected to be the cause of allergic contact dennatitis to intact uninflamed skin in non irritating concentration. Diagnostic of allergic contact dermatitis (airborne contact dermatitis is a type of allergic contact dermatitis wherein the allergens are airborne like pollen, cement, etc). Patch test - Delayed hypersensitivity (type IV hypersensitivity). Reading done two days later. Prick test. Type I hypersensitivity reaction, used to detect allergy to a host of allergens like food, dust, insects, drugs, etc. Done in atopic dermatitis, chronic urticaria, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, bronchial asthma. Reading done in 15 minutes. Serum IgE levels are non specifically elevated in allergic conditions characteristically high levels are seen in atopic dermatitis and very high levels in hyper IgE syndrome. Skin biopsy reveals nonspecific features of spongiosis seen in all cases of dermatitis and not specific for airborne contact dermatitis.",

        "exp": "Ans. (b) Segmental vitiligo.* Vitiligo is an acquired autoimmune condition targeting melanocytes and present with localized or widespread white depigmented patches. Thyroid autoimmune dysfunction is associated.* Piebaldism is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by white forelock and circumscribed depigmented patches affecting the body. It is caused by a defect in proliferation and migration of melanocytes during embryo- genesis. Unlike vitiligo, it is congenital and non-progressive. In the question the depigmentation started at age of 12 years and patient presented at 13 years.* Nevoid hypomelanosis is characterized by hypopigmented patches or streaks which follow the lines of Blaschko. They are present at birth and may develop in the first 2 years of life.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Methoxsalen * Melanizing agents are drugs that increase sensitivity to solar radiation and promote re-pigmentation of de- pigmented areas of skin. Melanizing agents sensitize the skin to sunlight. As a result, erythema, inflammation and pigmentation occurs.* Psoralen is a natural drug obtained from the fruit of Psoralea corylifolia.* Methoxsalen and Trioxsaolan are synthetic psoralens. These drugs can be used either topically or orally. Note- Patients taking minocycline may develop a diffuse blue - grey, muddy appearance in sun exposed areas in addition to pigmentation of mucus membranes, teeth, nails, bones and thyroid.
