Occurs on exposed area like face (nose, eyelid, pinna); and sometimes on buttock, trunk. o Lesions are usually solitary and characterized by: -Reddish brown (erythematous). Annular in shape. Indurated. Slowly increases in size (gradually progressive). Healing with tissue paper like scarring at centre (most common) or edge. Peripheral crusting. Blanching with glass slide (diascopy) will reveal grey green foci - Apple jelly nodules. viii ) Match-stick test positive - Apple jelly nodule has no resistance to pressure by a sharp match-stick. o Reappearance of new nodules within previously atrophic or scarred lesions is characteristic. Cartilage (Ear, nose) in the affected area is progressively destroyed (Lupus vorax); bone is usually spared. Buccal, nasal and conjuctival mucosa may be involved primarily or by extension.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e. Borderline lepromatous leprosy. Ref: Pasricha 4th/e p 101-105; OP Ghai Paediatrics 5th/e p 208. It's a very close diagnosis. Problem in this question is that the skin lesions show the characteristics of tuberculoid leprosy and the nerve involvement shows the features of lepromatous leprosy. Characteristics of skin lesions in tuberculoid leprosy. One or few lesions Well defined border. Lesions are erythematous and indurated plaques. The plaque may be uniformly raised but sometimes it is annular and has raised margins. Lesions are Hypoesthetic. Characteristics of skin lesions in lepromatous leprosy. Numerous, small, wide spread (involving, face, ear lobes). Bilaterally symmetrical. Ill defined, macules which gets nodular. Early involvement of face, nasal stuffiness, epistaxis. Sensations are unimpaired. They do not manifest the sensory loss which are so characteristic of tuberculoid leprosy. Now about the nerve involvement in the Tuberculoid type. Nerve involvement is common in tuberculoid type. Nerve involvement begins early and progresses rapidly. The involvement is usually restricted to a single nerve which may either be small cutaneous nerve twig supplying cutaneous patch or it may be a large nerve trunk such as ulnar, median, radial, lateral popliteal, great auricular etc. Nerve involvement in the lepromatous type. Nerves are infrequently involved but whenever involved the involvement tends to be B/L and symmetrical. So, now we can say that this case neither belongs to lepromatous leprosy (absence of characteristic lesions) nor to tuberculoid type (presence of B/L nerve involvement with numerous lesions). So it should be some dimorphous case i. e. either it is a case of Borderline Tuberculoid, Borderline lepromatous or midborderline (BB) leprosy. Mid borderline (BB) is not among the options. Note that Borderline leprosy is not same as Mid borderline (Borderline Borderline or BB). The term Borderline leprosy includes all the three -Borderline Tuberculoid. Borderline (B. B.). Borderline lepromatous. So we are left with the two options i. e. Borderline Tuberculoid and Borderline lepromatous. The following features favour the diagnosis of Borderline lepromatous leprosy. Multiple lesions with wide distribution in the body (Trunk and extremities are involved)B/L and symmetrical peripheral nerve enlargement. Though the presence of hypoaesthetic lesions with characteristic shape, erythematous plaques with raised margin is not typical of lepromatous, yet it can be seen in Borderline lepromatous.",
