Explanation: LICHEN PLANUSIt is a pruritic, inflammatory papulosquamous disorder affecting the skin, mucous membranes, nails and hair follicles. Etiology - Unknown. Genetic predisposition: HI A B8- oral LP: HLA-Bw 35-cutaneous LPExogenous: Primary biliary cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis CDrugs cause lichenoid drug eruptions. Metals like mercury (dental amalgams), palladium, gold - oral lichenoid eruptions. Clinical features: 30-60 years; children -4% of cases, childhood LP more common in India 05 Skin. Intensely pruritic, flat topped, shiny, polygonal, violaceous papules and plaques. Predominantly flexor distribution - flexor of wrist, forearm, legs, trunk, glans penis (cf- psoriasis another papulosquamous disorder has predominant extensor distribution). Wickham fs striae- netw-ork of greyish w hite streaks on papules seen on pressing with glass slide after application of oil - corresponds to wedge shaped hvpergranulosis seen on histo-pathology. Koebner! isomorphic phenomenon common. Annular LP- glans penis. Hypertrophic LP- shins. Actinic LP-sun exposed areas. Oral: Classical type is reticulate pattern- white/ violaceous lacy reticular network of coalesent papules in buccal mucosa and tongue; usually asymptomatic. Most common pattern - ulcerative/erosive LPNail: 5-10% cases. Thinning of nail plate (cf psoriasis - thickening of nail plate), longitudinal ridging, roughening of nail plate (trachyonychia) and nail dystrophy involving all 20 nails called 20 nail dystrophy (also seen in alopecia areata). Classical/characteristic nail finding (but not common finding)- pterygium formation (proximal nail fold fuses with nail bed). Hair follicles: lichen pktnopilaris - scarring alopecia. Histopathology: Hyperkeratosis. Wedge shaped hypergranulosis (psoriasis - hypogranulosis). Irregular acanthosis (psoriasis - regular acanthosis). Saw tooth rete ridges (psoriasis - elephant foot/camel foot like/club shaped rete ridges ) Basal layer vacuolar degeneration. Band like dermal lymphocytic infiltrate hugging epidermis. Max Joseph spaces - subepidermal clear zone (subepidermal clear zone in lepro- matous leprosy is called Grenz zone). Melanin incontinence. Treatment - steroids (topieal/intralesionsal/ systemic), retinoids, cyclosporine, PUVA photochemotherapy, dapsone, methotrexate. Lichen planus- \"8 P's\"Papu losq uamous disorder. Pruritic.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Lichen planus Histological feature of lichen planus. The earliest finding is an increase in epidermal Langerhans' cells, associated with a superficial perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes, impinging on the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ). Mild spongiosis is followed by vacuolar alteration and clefting along the DEJ, with accumulation of necrotic keratinocytes (colloid bodies). Irregular acanthosis of the epidermis, irregular thickening of the granular layer, and compact hyperkeratosis. A focal increase in thickness of the granular layer and infiltrate corresponds to the presence of Wickham's striae. Degenerating basal epidermal cells are transformed into colloid bodies (15-20 im diameter). The rete ridges may appear flattened or effaced ('saw-tooth' appearance), and focal separation from the dermis may lead to max Joseph spaces. In ' active ' L P, a band-like infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes, rarely admixed with plasma cells obliterates the DEJ. Epidermal melanocytes are absent or considerably decreased in number, while pigmentary incontinence with dermal melanophages is characteristic.",
