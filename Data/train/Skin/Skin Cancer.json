MALIGNANT MELANOMA - SUBTYPESSuperficial spreading melanoma is by far the most frequent type of melanoma. Most common sites: In female - leg and the In males - back. If the melanoma is developing in a pre-existing naevus, which occurs in approximately 50% of lesions, the irregular appearance of the growing melanoma may contrast strikingly with the more regularly pigmented and outlined residual naevus component. All patients with suspected malignant melanoma should have an excision biopsy of the lesion carried out with a margin of 1-2 mm of clinically normal skin. Incisional or punch biopsies should NOT be performed in suspected melanoma because of sampling error, because an inaccurate tumour thickness may be obtained due to biopsy trauma, and also because the overall shape and symmetry of the whole lesion is important to the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions. There is a theoretical risk of displacing melanoma cells deeper into the dermis. The essential pathological features of superficial spreading melanoma are the presence of a focus of malignant melanoma cells invading the dermis with areas of in situ malignant change in the adjacent epidermis.

Rapid growth over weeks to months. Carries Worst Prognosis*C. Lentigo maligna melanoma (Hutchinson's freckle). Slowly grows over 5-20 years. Arises in only a small percentage of the intra-epithelial precursor lesion, the lentigo maligna. Malignant Melanoma in situ. Good prognosisD. Acral lentiginous melanoma. Least common subtype. Occurs on the palms, soles, beneath the nail plate (Subungual variant). Pigment spread to the proximal or lateral nailfolds (Hutchinson sign) - Hallmark of this subtype. Prognosis is worse than superficial spreading melanoma subtypeE. Amelanotic melanoma. Nonpigmented. Pink or flesh colored. Mimics basal cell carcinoma or Squamous cell carcinoma.
