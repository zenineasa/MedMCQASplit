Pityriasis versicolor (Tinea versicolor)o Tinea versicolor is a misnomer as it is not caused by dermatophyte; Pityriasis versicolor is more appropriate term. It is caused by a nondermatophyte fungus called Pityrosporum ovale (Malasezia furfur). It usually affectsjoww adults. Clinical featureso There are multiple small scaly hypopigmented macules (macules may be hyperpigmented also). Scaling is furfuraceous or rice powder like. Macules start around the hair follicles and then merge with each other to form large areas. Affects trunk and shoulders (mainly chest and back). There may be loosening of scales with finger nails - Coupled onle or stroke of nail. Lesions are recurrent in nature (may reappear after treatment). Diagnosis of P. versicoloro Examination of scales in 10% KOH shows short hyphae and round spores (Sphagetti and meat ball appearance). Wood's lamp shows apple green fluorescence (blue-green fluorescence).

Ivermectin is basically an antihelminthic drug used traditionally to treat onchocerciasis. The mechanism of action of Ivermectin is by inhibition of Glutamate gated chloride ion channels & other ligand gated chloride channels, such as those gated by the neurotransmitter gamma amino acid (GABA) present in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells. This binding leads to an increase in the permeability of the cell membrane to chloride ions with hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell, resulting in paralysis and death of parasite.
