It also may be indicated whenever it is desirable to keep the free gingival margins of the remaining anterior teeth exposed and depth of the floor of the mouth is inadequate to place a lingual bar. Contraindications for Use: Remaining natural anterior teeth severely tilted toward the lingual. Characteristics and Location: The sublingual bar is essentially the same half-pear shape as a lingual bar, except that the bulkiest portion is located to the lingual and the tapered portion is toward the labial. The superior border of the bar should be at least 3 mm from the free gingival margin of the teeth. The inferior border is located at the height of the alveolar lingual sulcus when the patient's tongue is slightly elevated. This necessitates a functional impression of the lingual vestibule to accurately register the height of the vestibule. Key Concept: The sublingual bar should be used for mandibular removable partial dentures when the height of the floor of the mouth in relation to the free gingival margins will be less than 6 mm.

Most usual age of occurrence is 1 to 2 years as they try to stand up and walk because of lack of control on motor movements. 28% of 5-year olds would have experienced some kind of injury to the teeth and supporting structures. Most injuries are luxation type as bone is resilient in primary dentition (injury is primarily to the supporting structures). For injuries of permanent dentition, school age is the common age. 20% of 12-year-olds had experienced some kind of trauma. More of crown fractures compared to root fractures. Boys to girls ratio is said to be 2: 1 but not many studies supporting this fact are available. The prevalence may be more in boys because of their physical activity. Prevalence of injuries is more in maxillary central incisors followed by maxillary laterals, mandibular centrals and laterals.

For some applications low viscosity may be a disadvantage, for example, when trying to record the depth of the lingual sulcus. A higher viscosity is required to displace the lingual soft tissues in order that the full depth can be recorded. Materials which are initially very \ufb02uid are often classi\ufb01ed as mucostatic impression materials because they are less likely to compress soft tissues, whilst materials which are initially more viscous are classi\ufb01ed as mucocompressive.

The terms low speed, medium speed and high speed are used preferentially. The low-speed range is used for cleaning teeth, caries excavation and finishing and polishing procedures. At low speeds, tactile sensation is better and generally overheating of cut surfaces is less likely. The availability of a low-speed option provides a valuable adjunct for many dental procedures. At high rpm, the surface speed needed for efficient cutting may be attained with smaller and more versatile cutting instruments. This speed is used for tooth preparation and removing old restorations. Ref: Sturdevant's art and science of operative dentistry. 4th edition page 321",

Generally, patients who have a tooth sensitive to mastication have already percussed the tooth in question with their own \ufb01nger tip(s) and informed the dentist which teeth are sensitive. Percussion is an indirect means of testing pulp vitality, because teeth that are sensitive to percussion often have existing periapical lesions associated with a necrotic pulp. However, this is not always the case, and false positives can result if the clinician is evaluating a cracked tooth or a \u2018\u2018high'' restoration. If a crack has developed in the crown of a tooth with a vital pulp, the tooth can still be exquisitely sensitive, because of the crown segments moving microscopically causes pain due to the movement of \ufb02uid in the odontoblastic tubules. The tooth is sensitive to thermal stimuli as the pulp is vital. These mutually exclusive diagnostic \ufb01ndings, pain to percussion/mastication and thermal sensitivity, are pathognomonic for a cracked tooth.",

Too vigorous stimulation may produce withdrawal, which may be misinterpreted as a Babinski sign. Plantar responses have limited diagnostic utility in neonates, because they are mediated by several competing reflexes and can be either flexor or extensor, depending on how the foot is positioned. Asymmetry of the reflexes or plantar response is a useful lateralizing sign in infants and children. Note: The Babinski sign can be elicited by stroking the sole of the foot with a firm stimulus. The normal adult response is plantar-flexion. The sign is positive when the application of the stimulus elicits extension of the large toe and fanning of the other toes. The Babinski sign is known to be a normal response in infants before full maturation of the corticospinal tract. However, in adults, a positive sign is indicative of underlying UMN damage. Other reflexes exist which represent lesions of the corticospinal tract. The Brissaud reflex is linked with the extensor response of the Babinski sign and is positive when stroking the sole of the foot elicits contraction of the tensor fascia latae of the ipsilateral leg. The Hoffman sign is an analog of the Babinski reflex for the upper limbs. The test is performed by loosely holding the patient's middle finger and quickly flicking the fingernail downward. A positive sign is the flexion and adduction of the thumb. Damage anywhere along the Corticospinal Tract can result in the presence of a Babinski sign.",

Non-anatomic or 0\u00b0 or cuspless Teeth Non-anatomical teeth are defined as, \"Artificial teeth with occlusal surfaces which are not anatomically formed but which are designed to improve the function of mastication\" - GPT. Cuspless teeth are defined as, \"They are teeth designed without cuspal prominences on the occlusal surfaces\" - GPT. Zero degree teeth are defined as, \"Artificial posterior teeth having no cusp angles in relation to the horizontal occlusal surfaces\" - GPT. Key Concept: Anatomic teeth with cuspal angulation of 33 degrees, allows for optimum balancing of complete dentures. Ref: Textbook of prosthodontics by Nallaswamy Ed 2nd Pg 8",

With restorative resins varnish is not used because the varnish liners dissolve in the monomer of the resin and also they interfere in their polymerization process. Liners are indicated to protect pulp from chemical irritants by sealing ability and stimulate formation of reparative dentin.

Pulpotomy is also indicated for immature permanent teeth if necrotic pulp tissue is evident at the exposure site with inflammation of the underlying coronal tissue, but a conventional or cervical pulpotomy would be required. Yet another indication is trauma to a more mature permanent (closed apex) tooth that has caused both a pulp exposure and a root fracture.

The crown is finished in the previously recommended manner and cemented to the prepared tooth. - If the dentist encounters a tooth that is too large for the largest crown, a similar technique may be helpful. The crown may be cut on the buccal or lingual surface. After the crown has been adapted to the prepared tooth, an additional piece of 0. 004-inch stainless steel band material may be welded into place. A small amount of solder should be added to the outer surface of the margins. The crown may then be contoured in the usual manner, polished, and cemented into place.",

The masseter influences the denture base at this point during both opening and closing movements of the mandible. Overextension will result both in tis\u00adsue soreness and in movement of the denture base. When the masseter muscle contracts under heavy closing pressures, it reduces the size of the space available for the distal end of the buccal flange. The extent of the buccal vestibule can be deceiving because the coronoid process obscures it when the mouth is opened wide. Therefore it should be examined with the mouth as nearly closed as possible. This space usually is more superior than any other part of the border.

The death of these organisum in the apical root releases LPS (lipopolysaccharides) which can initiate and sustain apical periodontitis. 3) Enzmes: endodontic microbes produce a varity of enzmes which are not directly toxic but may aid the spread of the organisum in host tissues. Microbias collagenase, hyaluronidase, fibrinolysins and proteases are some examples. 4) Microbial Interference with the host defence.",

        "exp": "For the three planes of space in both the maxilla and mandible, there is a definite sequence in which growth is \"completed\" (i. e., declines to the slow rate that characterizes normal adults). Growth in width is completed first, then growth in length, and finally growth in height. Growth in width of both jaws, including the width of the dental arches, tends to be completed before the adolescent growth spurt and is affected minimally if at all by adolescent growth changes. Intercanine width is more likely to decrease than increase after age 12. Growth in length and height of both jaws continues through the period of puberty. In girls, the maxilla grows slowly downward and forward to age 14 to 15 on the average. In both sexes, growth in vertical height of the face continues longer than growth in length, with the late vertical growth primarily in the mandible.

Bruxism occurs when freedom in centric is lost. It results from occlusal interferences during sliding from centric relation to centric occlusion.

Various systemic factors such as worm infestations, sub-clinical nutritional de\ufb01ciencies, magnesium de\ufb01ciency, allergies and endocrinal disorders have also been attributed.

This DCPD is highly reactive with fluoride ion and starts forming immediately when APF is applied. Fluoride penetrates into the crystals more deeply through the openings produced by shrinkage and leads to formation of fluorapatite. For the conversion of whole of DCPD so formed into fluorapatite, deeper penetration and continuous supply of fluoride is required. Because of this reason, APF is applied every 30 seconds and the teeth has to be kept wet for 4 minutes. Because high fluoride concentration and low pH favor fluoride deposition, acidification of the fluoride solution with phosphoric acid was found to suppress the dissolution of enamel, as well as the formation of calcium fluoride and provide a more effective treatment. The intermediate product formed is the dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and calcium fluoride is the principal reaction product. \u200bEssentials of preventive and community dentistry Soben Peter 5th edition",

        "exp": "Biomechanical Considerations The maxilla can be advanced 2-4 mm forward over a period of 8-12 months. The amount of maxillary movement is influenced by a number of factors like: Amount of force: Successful maxillary protraction can be brought about by 300-500 gm of force per side in the primary or mixed dentition. Direction of force: According to most authors, a 15- 20\u00b0 downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement. In most cases of maxillary deficiency, maxilla is deficient in the vertical plane as well, therefore, a slight downward, direction of force is usually desirable. The line of force passes below the center of resistance of the maxilla producing a counter-clockwise moment on the maxilla and dentition. This results in a possible extrusion of maxillary posterior teeth leading to a downward and backward rotation of the mandible. However, in patients with increased anterior facial height, downward pull is contradicted. Duration of force: A review of literature shows duration to vary between 3 and 16 months. On an average at least 8-12 months of wear is required to produce the desired effect. Frequency of use: 12-14 hrs/day Key Concept: Successful maxillary protraction can be brought about by 300-500 gm of force per side in the primary or mixed dentition.

The suborder denotes the position or manner of use of the instrument, e. g., push, pull. The class describes the form of the blade, e. g., hatchet, chisel. The angle denotes the number of angles in the shank. If the instrument contains one angle in its shank, it is called monangle. If it contains two angles, it is called binangle. If it contains three angles, it is called triple-angle. Four angles are called quaternary-angle. Naming of the instruments usually moves from 4 to 1. For example, a binangle hatchet push excavator. In most cases, the suborder describing the position or manner of use is variable and non-specific, and for practical purposes, it is usually omitted. Identifying the working end and the purpose of the instrument is sufficient, e. g., binangle hatchet excavator.

This reaction has become possible because the solubility of hemihydrate in water is four times greater than that of the dihydrate near room temperature. Thus, the setting reactions occur as follows: When the hemihydrate is mixed with water, a suspension is formed that is fluid and workable. The hemihydrate dissolves until it forms a saturated solution of Ca2+ and (SO4)2-. This saturated hemihydrate solution is supersaturated with respect to the solubility of the dihydrate; precipitation of dihydrate occurs.

The primary consideration for a single complete denture is preservation. By opposing the natural teeth, the magnitude of force transmitted to the denture and arrangement of artificial teeth will be the major considerations while planning the denture. These will be discussed in this chapter. Disadvantages The unfavourable force distribution by the natural teeth can cause the following adverse changes: Extensive morphological changes in denture foundation. Jaw relationship extremes which make it difficult to arrange artificial teeth for the denture along the line of support. Excessively displaceable denture-bearing tissue (flabby ridges). Indications A single complete denture may be desirable when it is to oppose any one of the following conditions: Natural teeth sufficient in numbers not to necessitate a fixed or removable partial denture. A partially edentulous arch in which the missing teeth have been or will be replaced by the fixed partial denture. A partially edentulous arch in which the missing teeth have been or will be replaced by a removable partial denture. An existing complete denture. Key Concept: The characteristic features that occur when an edentulous maxilla is opposed by natural mandibular anterior teeth, including loss of bone from the anterior portion of the maxillary ridge, overgrowth of the tuberosities, papillary hyperplasia of the hard palate's mucosa, extrusion of the lower anterior teeth, and loss of alveolar bone and ridge height beneath the mandibular removable dental prosthesis bases - also called anterior hyperfunction syndrome (Combination Syndrome)(GPT8).",

When molten metal strikes against the mold wall at 90-degree angle and if the mold metal temperature differential is more, it creates a \"hot spot\", the molten metal in this area will solidify last, leading to localizing shrinkage porosity, if there is no continuous supply of molten metal.

Clinical Features Dull spontaneous pain, mastication pain, tooth mobility, periodontal-type abscesses and bony radiolucencies. Deep osseous defects: The typical bone loss pattern in teeth with vertical root fracture is the loss of alveolar bone, specifically in relation to the fracture area. Sinus tract located near the cervical area. Radiographic Features Separation of root segments associated with a radiolucency surrounding the bone between the roots. Hairline fracture - like radiolucency. Halo appearance - a combined periapical and periradicular radiolucency on one or both sides of the involved root. Clinical Notes Vertical root fracture (VRF) are seen most commonly in endodontically treated teeth.

Both are characterized by a spherical contour but are decidedly different in size. The gas inclusion porosities are usually much larger than pinhole porosity. Many metals dissolve or occlude gases while they are molten. For example, both copper and silver dissolve oxygen in large amounts in the liquid state. Molten platinum and palladium have a strong affinity for hydrogen as well as oxygen. On solidification, the absorbed gases are expelled and pinhole porosity results. The larger voids may also result from the same cause, but it is more logical to assume that such voids are caused by gas that is mechanically trapped by the molten metal in the mold or by gas that is incorporated during the casting procedure.
