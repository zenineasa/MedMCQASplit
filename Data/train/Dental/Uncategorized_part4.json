However, the manner and time sequence in which the pulp becomes necrotic allow a great deal of potential for successful intervention in maintaining pulp vitality. The first reaction after an injury is hemorrhage and local inflammation. Subsequent inflammatory changes are usually proliferative, but can be destructive. It is expected that within the first 24 hours after the injury, a proliferative response with inflammation will extend no more than 2 mm into the pulp. In time, however, microbial infection will result in local pulp necrosis and a slow apical spread of pulpal inflammation. Treatment Treatment options are: (1) Vital pulp therapy comprising pulp capping, partial pulpotomy, and full pulpotomy, OR (2) Pulpectomy. The choice of treatment depends on the stage of development of the tooth, the time between the accident and treatment, concomitant periodontal injury, and the restorative treatment plan.

The use of custom trays for polyether and addition silicone impressions is not critical, since these materials are stiffer and have less polymerization shrinkage than the polysulfide material. In addition, disposable stock trays work satisfactorily. Note that the use of less material in a custom tray reduces the compressibility of the impression, which can make removal of the impression tray more difficult. When severe undercuts are present, the use of a custom tray should be avoided. The stock tray should be rigid, thereby minimizing flexure of the tray during impression making.

Crowns of canines in young jaws impinge on developing lateral incisor roots, thus driving the roots medially and causing the crowns to flare laterally. The roots of the central incisors are also forced together thus causing a maxillary midline diastema. The period from the eruption of lateral incisor to canine is termed as the Ugly Duckling stage. It is an unaesthetic metamorphosis, which eventually leads to an aesthetic result. With eruption of canines, the impingement from the roots shifts incisally thus driving the incisor crowns medially, resulting in closure of the diastema.",

Intramembranous bone growth, by contrast, is by direct apposition of osseous tissue in osteogenic (periosteal) membranes creating accretional growth, often with great speed, especially over rapidly growing areas, such as the frontal lobes of the brain, or at fracture sites.

Riga-Fede is the rare condition of benign ulceration caused by repetitive trauma to the lingual tissues by the teeth in children younger than two years of age. The differential diagnosis includes infective and neoplastic conditions. Histological diagnosis is required when the symptoms fail to resolve with standard management. The prevalence of natal teeth (teeth present at birth) and neonatal teeth (teeth that erupt during the first 30 days) is low. They found that about 85% of natal or neonatal teeth are mandibular primary incisors, and only small percentages are supernumerary teeth. It is common for natal and neonatal teeth to occur in pairs. They also reported that most premature tooth eruption seems to occur in otherwise normal infants, with or without a family history of the condition. In some infants, however, the presence of such teeth may be a localized manifestation of various environmental causes or an underlying syndrome, with the most common being Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, Hallermann- Streiff syndrome, Pierre Robin syndrome, and Sotos syndrome.",

Which of the following statements is least explanatory for the constricted maxillary arch in such cases?",
        "exp": "Although negative pressure is created within the mouth during sucking, there is no reason to believe that this is responsible for the narrowing of the maxillary arch that usually accompanies sucking habits. Instead, arch form is affected by an alteration in the balance between cheek and tongue pressures. If the thumb is placed between the teeth, the tongue must be lowered, which decreases pressure by the tongue against the lingual of upper posterior teeth. At the same time, cheek pressure against these teeth is increased as the buccinator muscle contracts during sucking. Cheek pressures are greatest at the corners of the mouth, and this probably explains why the maxillary arch tends to become V-shaped, with more constriction across the canines than the molars. A child who sucks vigorously is more likely to have a narrow upper arch than one who just places the thumb between the teeth.",

For example, there are often accumulations of food debris in the interproximal areas between the teeth, particularly if oral hygiene is poor. This debris then produces an electrolyte in that area, which is different from the electrolyte that is produced by normal saliva at the occlusal surface. Electrochemical corrosion of the alloy surface underneath the layer of food debris will take place in this situation. For most metallic dental appliances, the deleterious effects of stress and corrosion, called stress corrosion, are most likely to occur during fatigue or cyclic loading in the oral environment. When two dissimilar restorations are brought into contact, there is a sudden short-circuit through the two alloys. This can result in a sharp pain, called galvanic shock.

At this stage and during all building of the restoration, the compacted surface should be saucer shaped, with the compaction of gold on the external walls slightly ahead of the center. The surface should never be convex in the center because this may result in voids in the gold and poor adaptation of the gold along the external walls when the condenser nib is \"crowded out\" along the wall by the center convexity. The operator continues building the restoration until the cavosurface margin is covered with foil. One needs to exercise extreme care that gold is always present between the condenser face and the cavosurface margin; otherwise the condenser may injure (i. e., fracture) the enamel margin. The central area of the restoration's surface is filled in to the desired level. Tooth surface contour of the gold is created to simulate the final anatomic form, and a slight excess of gold is compacted on the surface to allow for the finishing and polishing procedures.

The Wits appraisal is used in cases, where the ANB angle is considered not so reliable, due to factors such as position of nasion and rotation of the jaws. A function occlusal plane is drawn through the overlapping cusps of first premolars and first molars. Perpendiculars are drawn to the occlusal plane from points A and B. The points of contact of these perpendiculars on the occlusal plane are termed AO and BO. The distance between points AO and BO gives the anteroposterior relation between the two jaws. In case of males, point BO is ahead of AO by 1 mm, while in case of females, the points AO and BO coincide.

Glass ionomers and compomers are significantly better for recharging than resin-based composite materials, but this depends on the composition of the materials. Hybrid ionomers are often reported to have the highest capacity for recharging. It has also been reported that as the specimens age, their efficiencies of fluoride recharging decrease. Water soluble methacrylate-based monomers have been used to replace part of liquid component of conventional GIC resulting in a group of materials called resin-modified glass ionomer cements, also known as hybrid ionomer cement.

When a thumb or finger is placed between the anterior teeth, the mandible must be positioned downward to accommodate it. The interposed thumb directly impedes incisor eruption. At the same time, the separation of the jaws alters the vertical equilibrium on the posterior teeth, and as a result, there is more eruption of posterior teeth than might otherwise have occurred. Because of the geometry of the jaws, 1 mm of elongation posteriorly opens the bite about 2 mm anteriorly, so this can be a powerful contributor to the development of anterior open bite. The child with a persistent digit-sucking habit that results in an open bite typically exhibits a convex profile with hypotonic upper lip, lower lip hypertonicity with marked mentalis muscle activity, and tongue-thrusting. These patterns maintain and possibly intensify the developing anterior open bite and overjet discrepancy.

The defective gene products cause abnormal water and electrolyte transport across epithelial cells, which results in a chronic disease of the respiratory and gastrointestinal system, elevated levels of electrolytes in sweat, and impaired reproductive function.

Local: Alleviation of the acute inflammation plus treatment of the chronic disease either underlying the acute involvement or elsewhere in the oral cavity. 2. Systemic: a. Supportive treatment: Alleviation of generalized toxic symptoms, such as fever and malaise. b. Etiotropic treatment: The correction of systemic conditions that contribute to the initiation or progress of the gingival changes. Antibiotics are administered systemically only in patients with toxic systemic complications or local adenopathy. They are not recommended in ANUG patients who do not have these complications. The antibiotic of choice is penicillin. Patients who are allergic to penicillin should be given erythromycin. Metronidazole may also be used. Supportive systemic treatment In addition to systemic antibiotics, supportive treatment consists of copious fluid consumption and administration of analgesics for the relief of pain. Bed rest is necessary for patients with toxic systemic complications such as high fever, malaise, anorexia, and general debility. In such cases, nutritional requirements also need to be kept in mind.

Root: Exaggerated flaring of the roots Long and slender",
        "exp": "Primary 1st molar: Unlike the other primary teeth, the first primary molar does not resemble any of the permanent teeth. The mesial outline of the tooth, when viewed from the buccal aspect, is almost straight from the contact area to the cervical region. The distal area of the tooth is shorter than the mesial area. The two distinct buccal cusps have no evidence of a distinct developmental groove between them; the mesial cusp is the larger of the two. There is a pronounced lingual convergence of the crown on the mesial aspect, with a rhomboid outline present on the distal aspect. The mesiolingual cusp is long and sharp at the tip; a developmental groove separates this cusp from the distolingual cusp, which is rounded and well developed. The mesial marginal ridge is well developed, to the extent that it appears as another small cusp lingually. When the tooth is viewed from the mesial aspect, there is an extreme curvature buccally at the cervical third. The crown length is greater in the mesiobuccal area than in the mesiolingual area; thus the cervical line slants upward from the buccal to the lingual surface. The longer slender roots spread considerably at the apical third, extending beyond the outline of the crown. The mesial root, when viewed from the mesial aspect, does not resemble any other primary root. The buccal and lingual outlines of the root drop straight down from the crown, being essentially parallel for more than half their length. The end of the root is flat and almost square. Primary mandibular second molar: The mandibular second molar resembles the mandibular first permanent molar, except that the primary tooth is smaller in all its dimensions. The buccal surface is divided into three cusps that are separated by mesiobuccal and distobuccal developmental grooves. The cusps are almost equal in size. Two cusps of almost equal size are evident on the lingual surface and are divided by a short lingual groove. The primary second molar, when viewed from the occlusal surface, appears rectangular with a slight distal convergence of the crown. The mesial marginal ridge is developed to a greater extent than the distal marginal ridge. One difference between the crown of the primary molar and that of the first permanent molar is in the distobuccal cusp; the distal cusp of the permanent molar is smaller than the other two buccal cusps. The roots of the primary second molar are long and slender, with a characteristic flare mesiodistally in the middle and apical thirds.",

It consolidates three indicators, viz. infant mortality, life expectancy at age one, and literacy. These three components measure the results rather than inputs. As such they lend themselves to international and national comparison. For each component, the performance of individual countries is placed on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 represents an absolutely defined \"worst\" performance, and 100 represents an absolutely defined \"best\" performance. The composite index is calculated by averaging the three indicators, giving equal weight to each of them. The resulting PQLI thus also is scaled 0 to 100.

In other children, the primary infection may be manifested by acute symptoms (acute herpetic gingivostomatitis). The active symptoms of acute disease can occur in children with clean mouths and healthy oral tissues. The symptoms of the disease develop suddenly and include, in addition to the fiery red gingival tissues, malaise, irritability, headache, and pain associated with the intake of food and liquids of acidic content. A characteristic oral finding in the acute primary disease is the presence of yellow or white liquid-filled vesicles. Reference: Mc.

Enamel and cementum, though semipermeable, provide an effective layer serving to protect the underlying dentin and limit tubular fluid flow. Dentin permeability is not uniform throughout the tooth. Coronal dentin is much more permeable than root dentin. Dentin permeability primarily depends on the remaining dentin thickness (i. e., length of the tubules) and the diameter of the tubules. Because the tubules are shorter, more numerous, and larger in diameter closer to the pulp, deep dentin is a less effective pulpal barrier compared with superficial dentin.

Also, the incidence of contact caries is less when compared to amalgam restorations (contact caries is the term applied to caries occurring on the proximal surface of the tooth adjacent to the restoration). The anti-cariogenic property is due to presence of 15% fluoride. Fluoride release is slow and occurs throughout the life of the restoration. Silicate cements were classed as a severe irritant to the pulp because of its low pH (acidic). For many years, silicate served as a standard for comparing the pulpal response to other materials. In deep cavities, the pulp had to be protected with varnish or calcium hydroxide. Ref- Manapallil 3rd Ed P: 88",

This results in harmful tipping or torquing of the tooth, which is greater with stiff clasps and increased denture base movement. Two strategies may be adopted to change the fulcrum location and subsequently the \"resistance arm\" engaging effect (mesial rest concept clasp assemblies), or to minimize the effect of the lever through the use of a flexible arm (wrought-wire retentive arm).

The spatulation effectively destroys the matrix as it forms, which means that extra time is needed to rebuild the bulk of the matrix. This is not a preferred method for extending the working time. First, the P/L ratio can be reduced to produce a thinner mixture. However, this change will result in a lower initial pH of the cement and it will adversely affect the mechanical properties of the cement. Second, smaller portions of powder should be mixed for the first few increments. Initial small increments of powder dissolve in the liquid, which reduces the acidity of the liquid and retards the reaction rate with subsequent increments. Third, the operator can prolong the spatulation of the last increment of powder. The spatulation effectively destroys the matrix as it forms, which means that extra time is needed to rebuild the bulk of the matrix.

The delayed fracture of molar ceramic crowns that are subjected to periodic cyclic forces may be caused by dynamic fatigue failure. The failure begins as a flaw that propagates until the catastrophic fracture occurs. Stresses well below the ultimate tensile strength can produce premature fracture of a dental prosthesis because microscopic flaws grow slowly over many cycles of stress. This phenomenon is called fatigue failure. Normal mastication induces several thousands of stress cycles per day within a dental restoration. For glasses and certain glass containing ceramics, the induced tensile stress and the presence of an aqueous environment further reduce the number of cycles to cause fatigue failure.

As a thick layer of calcium fluoride gets formed, it interferes with the further diffusion of fluoride from the topical fluoride solution to react with hydroxyapatite and blocks further entry of fluoride ions. This sudden stoppage of the entry of fluoride is termed as the \"Choking off effect\". Fluoride then slowly leaches from the calcium fluoride. Thus, calcium fluoride acts as a reservoir for fluoride release. It is for this reason that after each application of sodium fluoride onto the tooth surface, it is left to dry for 4 minutes.

After the powder is completely incorporated and a creamy mixture has been created, the cement is drawn across the slab and the flat blade of the mixing spatula contacts the mixture and is slowly drawn away. If a string of cement can be lifted 12 mm (12 inch) to 19 mm (~ 34 inch) before separating from the spatula, the cement is considered fluid enough for cementing a prosthesis. If the string exceeds 19 mm, the cement is too viscous for proper seating of prostheses and another mixture should be made.

In Naevus anaemic, localized vasoconstriction, other pigments are unaltered - diascopy of adjacent skin, therefore, reveals an identical colour to that of the depigmented area. By contrast, diascopy of skin adjacent to vitiligo, in which there is a loss of melanin, demonstrates that the vitiligo remains paler. Application of medium pressure to a spider naevus can compress radiating arterioles and allow visualization of pulsatile flow in the feeding vessel. Palpable purpuric lesions that do not blanch on pressure (diascopy) suggest vasculitis.",

This index was developed to study variations in gingival inflammation in relation to the degree of mental retardation in children. It was depicted as a sensitive, simple and rapid method for assessing group or individual oral hygiene quantitatively. The papillary - marginal - attachment index (PMA index) was developed by Maury Massler and Schour I. in 1944. The basic philosophy used in the development of the PMA index was very similar to the DMF index, i. e, the number of gingival units affected were counted rather than the severity of the inflammation. The Marginal Line Calculus Index (MLCI) was developed by Muhlemann H. R. and Villa R in 1967. MLCI, is another index that is frequently used in short-term clinical trials (i. e less than 6 weeks) of anticalculus agents. This index was developed to assess the accumulation of supra gingival calculus on the gingival third of the tooth or, more specifically, supragingival calculus along the margin of the gingiva. The Glass Index system was developed by Glass R. L. in 1965. This index assesses the presence and extent of debris accumulation, for evaluating tooth-brushing efficacy.",

Tongue is placed between the gum pads and tongue tip is brought forward into contact with the lower lip. Little posterior tongue activity /pharyngeal muscle activity. Tongue-to-lower lip posture adopted by infants at rest. Contraction of lips and facial muscles helps to stabilize the mandible. Vigorous mandibular thrust. Physiologic transition of swallow begins during the 1st year of life and continues for several years. Mature swallow is seen usually by 4-5 years. Maturation of swallow pattern occurs with the addition of semisolid and solid food to the diet. Increasing activation of the elevator muscles of mandible is seen. When sucking activity stops, a continued transition of swallow leads to acquisition of adult pattern of swallow. This swallow is characterized by: Cessation of lip activity, i. e, lips relaxed. Placement of tongue tip against the palate and behind upper incisors. Posterior teeth into occlusion during swallow. Downward and forward mandibular growth increases intraoral volume and vertical growth of the alveolar process changes tongue posture. Mandible stabilized by contraction of muscles of mastication.

In fact, many apparently are undetected until evidence of a calcified repair is seen radiographically sometime after the injury. Andreasen has described four tissue reactions after root fracture: (1) Healing with calcified tissue, which is characterized by a uniting callus of hard tissue that may consist of dentin, osteodentin, or cementum. (2) Healing with interposition of connective tissue, in which the fractured root surfaces are covered by cementum with connective tissue fibers joining the two fragments. (3) Healing with interposition of bone and connective tissue, in which a bony bridge and connective tissue are positioned between the fragments. (4) Interposition of granulation tissue. The last is the least favorable form of attempted repair, and the fracture will not heal spontaneously. The teeth usually present unfavorable symptoms that may be accompanied by fistulas resulting from necrosis of the coronal portion and also sometimes the apical portion of the pulp.

On further scraping, these capillaries at the tip of elongated papillae are torn leading to multiple bleeding points. This is known as Auspitz sign, it is attributed to parakeratosis, intracellular edema of epidermal cells, suprapapillary thinning of stratum Malpighi, elongation of dermal papillae and dilatation and tortuosity of papillary capillaries. PSORIASIS: Pink Papules/ Plaques/ Pinpoint bleeding (Auspitz sign)/ Physical injury (Koebner phenomenon) Silver Scale/ Sharp margins Onycholysis/ Oil Spots Rete Ridges with Regular elongation Itching Arthritis/ Abscess (Munro) Stratum corneum with nuclei, neutrophils Immunologic disease Stratum granulosum absent/ Stratum Spinosum thickening. Plaque Psoriasis This is the most common and well-recognized form of psoriasis. 2 It is characterized by well-defined raised erythematous papules and plaques with silvery coarse scale. The distribution is typically symmetric, and sites of predilection include - the extensor surfaces of the extremities, particularly the elbows and knees, sacrum, scalp, nape of the neck, and to a lesser extent trunk, genitalia, face, and ears. Individuals may present with hyperkeratotic scaling disease localized to the scalp only, making it difficult to discriminate from severe seborrheic dermatitis or tinea capitis. This presentation has been called tinea amiantacea, and requires evaluation to distinguish between these 3 entities. Additional features of psoriatic plaques include: - Auspitz sign, - Woronoff 's ring and - Kobner phenomenon",

        "exp": "Radiographs, tactile sensation, the presence of moisture on paper points, and knowledge of root morphology have been used to determine the length of root canal systems. Currently, the electronic apex locator is considered an accurate tool for determining working length. One study reported that the use of electronic apex locators in a dental student clinic resulted in a higher quality of obturation length control and an overall reduction in the number of radiographs taken. However, these devices must not be considered flawless, because several variables are known to affect their accuracy. For example, immature roots can present problems. Once roots mature (i. e., form a narrow apical foramen) and instruments are able to contact the canal walls, an electronic apex locator's accuracy greatly improves. Some investigators have found no statistical difference between roots with vital and necrotic tissue. Because apical root resorption is prevalent in necrotic cases with longstanding apical lesions, it may be concluded that apical resorption does not have a significant effect on the accuracy of electronic apex locators. Some clinicians have advocated the use of the electronically determined working length in lieu of working length estimations using the placement of a file in the canal and a radiograph. However, combined use of both of these techniques has been shown to result in greater accuracy. Furthermore, radiographs may add essential anatomic information that could be missed if electronic apex locators are used exclusively. Working length determination in elderly patients may be more difficult because of increased cementum deposition, modifying the apical anatomy. Ref: Cohen pathways of Pulp 11th ed page no 237",

It also tends to form thin adherent oxides that are required to promote atomic bonding of porcelain. Base metal alloys containing both beryllium and nickel exhibit high beryllium release rates, which may pose a health risk. Beryllium-containing particles that are inhaled and reach the alveoli of the lungs may cause a chronic inflammatory condition called berylliosis. Berylliosis occurs only in individuals with a hypersensitivity to beryllium and may occur from inhalation of beryllium dusts (from grinding or polishing alloys), salts, or fumes such as those encountered in casting beryllium-containing alloys. Thus, dental lab technicians would presumably be at the highest risk of adverse effects from exposure to beryllium dusts and vapors. Ref: Phillip's 12th edition page 128.",
