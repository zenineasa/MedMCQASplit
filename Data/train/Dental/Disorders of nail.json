After initial inflammation, pus accumulates beside the nail. These infections frequently result from trauma, picking at the nail, or disorders such as dermatitis. Often, these become secondarily infected with bacteria or fungus, which later involves the nail. Warm soaks three or four times a day may reduce pain and pressure; however incision and drainage, paial nail removal and antibiotics are frequently required.",

Onychogryphosis (club or ram horn nail) is longstanding hyperophy of the nail plate with curving deformity. The normal nail slids forward as a thin plate, in onychogryphosis the nail heaps up and curls over the end of the toe, resembling a claw or horn. Leukonychia is white spots on nail, and are probably the most common nail change. Onychauxis is a condition in which the nail plate is veically thicker than normal without deformity. It occurs due to thick hyperkeratotic nails caused by a buildup of keratin. The most common cause is a dermatophyte infection, and other known cause is psoriasis.",
