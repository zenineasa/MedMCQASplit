Acanthosis associated with obesity: Obesity-associated acanthosis nigricans, once labeled pseudo-acanthosis nigricans, is the most common type of acanthosis nigricans. Lesions may appear at any age but are more common in adulthood. The dermatosis is weight dependent, and lesions may completely regress with weight reduction. Insulin resistance is often present in these patients; however, it is not universal. Obesity-associated acanthosis nigricans may be a marker for higher insulin needs in obese women with gestational diabetes.
