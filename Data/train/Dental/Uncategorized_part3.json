It is always best to avoid torquing or twisting the impression in an effort to remove it quickly. Specifically, the handle should be used minimally during breaking of the air seal (\"suction\") or removal of the tray from the teeth. The compressive strength of alginate doubles during the first 4 min after gelation, but it does not increase appreciably thereafter. Most alginate materials improve in elasticity over time; this minimizes distortion of the material during impression removal, thus permitting superior reproduction of undercut areas. It is possible to leave an alginate impression in the mouth too long. Data clearly indicate that the alginate impression should not be removed from the mouth for at least 3 min after gelation has occurred. Key concept: The alginate impression should not be removed from the mouth for at least 3 min after gelation has occurred.",

General physical examination reveals increased anterior facial height and incompetent lips. Intraoral findings suggest narrow maxillary arch. These features are seen in patients with-",
        "exp": "Respiratory needs are the primary determinant of the posture of the jaws and tongue (and of the head itself, to a lesser extent). Therefore it seems entirely reasonable that an altered respiratory pattern, such as breathing through the mouth rather than the nose, could change the posture of the head, jaw, and tongue. This in turn could alter the equilibrium of pressures on the jaws and teeth and affect both jaw growth and tooth position. To breathe through the mouth, one must lower the mandible and tongue and extend (tip back) the head. If these postural changes were maintained, three effects on growth would be expected: (1) anterior face height would increase, and posterior teeth would super-erupt; (2) unless there was unusual vertical growth of the ramus, the mandible would rotate down and back, opening the bite anteriorly and increasing overjet; and (3) increased pressure from the stretched cheeks might cause a narrower maxillary dental arch. Chronic respiratory obstruction can be produced by prolonged inflammation of the nasal mucosa associated with allergies or chronic infection. It can also be produced by mechanical obstruction anywhere within the naso-respiratory system, from the nares to the posterior nasal choanae. Under normal conditions, the size of the nostril is the limiting factor in nasal airflow. The pharyngeal tonsils or adenoids normally are large in children, and partial obstruction from this source may contribute to mouth breathing in children. Individuals who have had chronic nasal obstruction may continue to breathe partially through the mouth even after the obstruction has been relieved. In this sense, mouth breathing can sometimes be considered a habit.",

Orthodontic expansion and widening of collapsed arch form can improve the appearance of the smile dramatically by decreasing the size of the buccal corridors and improving the transverse smile dimension. The transverse smile dimension (and the buccal corridor width) is related to the lateral projection of the premolars and the molars into the buccal corridors.

NOHP addresses the \u2018silent epidemic of oral diseases, via the following initiatives:- National Oral Health Programme IDA offers a unique oral programme by offering check-ups or preventive care by introducing different cards under National Oral Health Programme are: Child Oral Health Card - Check-ups for cavity or gum disease are conducted for the card-holder. Post examination, children are divided into three categories of mild, moderate and high risk. Parents are alerted\\ advised to bring the child for further treatment at IDA's approved dentist. Family Oral Health Card - Addresses all the unique and special oral health needs of the total family from babies to adults. The card holder with free- dental check -up can take the family on a healthy and safe lifestyle trip beginning with good oral health. Corporate Oral Health Card - Ensures convenient access to the best and most cost- effective oral health check-up. Check-up of oral health alerts the individual about health complications like cardio vascular disease, diabetes, stroke, Alzheimer etc which reflect in the mouth. Platinum Oral Health Card - Targeted at oral check-ups for elders, as we age salivary flow decreases which results in tooth decay and difficulty in eating, speaking and swallowing thereby affecting general health and quality of life. Oral check-ups maintain \"Teeth are for life\". Special Previlege Card - Holders can avail oral check-ups for disabled and mentally retarded people. They are more prone to tooth decay or gum diseases and are at a higher risk. They need special care as oral health awareness is low and lack coordination of body. Muskaan - Cards can be used by rural Indian for check-ups which are vital in the rural areas because dentist to population ratio is dismally low with less than 2% dentists being available for 72% of rural population.

        "exp": "ERUPTION SEQUESTRUM The eruption sequestrum is occasionally seen in children at the time of the eruption of the first permanent molar. Starkey and Shafer have described the sequestrum as a tiny spicule of nonviable bone overlying the crown of an erupting permanent molar just before or immediately after the emergence of the tips of the cusps through the oral. Regardless of its origin, the hard tissue fragment is generally overlying the central fossa of the associated tooth, embedded, and contoured within the soft tissue. As the tooth erupts and the cusps emerge, the fragment sequestrates. Eruption sequestra are usually of little or no clinical significance. It is probable that some of these sequestra spontaneously resolve without noticeable symptoms. However, after an eruption sequestrum has surfaced through the mucosa, it may easily be removed if it is causing local irritation. The base of the sequestrum is often still well embedded in gingival tissue when it is discovered, and application of a topical anesthetic or infiltration of a few drops of a local anesthetic may be necessary to avoid discomfort during removal.

        "exp": "Burnishing of a cast metal margin is a process sometimes used to reduce the width of a gap between the crown margin and the tooth surface. For a metal with relatively high ductility and moderate yield strength, application of a high pressure against the margin will plastically deform the margin and reduce the gap width. However, because elastic deformation has also occurred, the margin will spring back as elastic strain decreases during the decrease in pressure. Thus, burnishing the margin will close the gap only to the extent of the plastic deformation (strain) that is induced during burnishing. After the force is removed, the margin springs back an amount equal to the total elastic strain. Only by removing the crown from a tooth or die can total closure be accomplished. Because we must provide at least 25 micro m of clearance for the cement, total burnishing on the tooth or die is usually adequate since the amount of elastic strain recovery is relatively small.",

KINGSLEY (1956) Based on the nature of the habits, Kingsley (1956) classified habits as: Functional oral habit - E. g. mouth breathing. Muscular habits - Eg. tongue thrusting, cheek/lip biting.

As the tooth erupts and the cusps emerge, the fragment sequestrates. Eruption sequestra are usually of little or no clinical significance.

However, after an eruption sequestrum has surfaced through the mucosa, it may easily be removed if it is causing local irritation.

PRR is also called as conservative adhesive resin restoration. Depending on the extent and depth of the lesion, there are 3 types of PRR: Type A- Suspicious pits and fissures where caries is limited to enamel. Type B- Incipient lesion extending into dentin that is small and confined Type C- Deep caries thereby requiring greater exploratory preparation in dentin.",

        "exp": "Restorative Materials Used for Treatment of Root Caries Direct filling gold was material of choice because of its ability to adapt the preparation walls with good marginal adaptation. But since isolation of these areas is difficult, the use of direct filling gold is decreased. Dental amalgam is easy to manipulate, can be used in areas which are difficult to isolate and has self-sealing property. Traditional glass-ionomer cements have the desirable properties of being biocompatible, bonding chemically to tooth and showing anticariogenicity. But they have poor esthetics and excessive wear with time. Resin-modified glass ionomers are biocompatible, bond to tooth, have thermal expansion and contraction characteristics that match tooth structure, and fluoride releasing feature. Microfilled composites are recommended for root surface restorations as they have lower elastic modulus than hybrid composites. This is an advantageous property, since the teeth flex during mastication and a flexible material will be a better choice to restore the root surface. Nisha Garg, Amit Garg.

Since no teeth are erupting at that time, dental ages 9 and 10 must be distinguished by the extent of resorption of the primary canines and premolars and the extent of root development of their permanent successors. At dental age 9, the primary canines, first molars, and second molars are present. Approximately one third of the root of the mandibular canine and the mandibular first premolar is completed. Root development is just beginning, if it has started at all, on the mandibular second premolar.

The full onlay by definition caps all of the cusps of a posterior tooth and can be designed to help strengthen a tooth that has been weakened by caries or previous restorative experiences. It can be designed to distribute occlusal loads over the tooth in a manner that greatly decreases the chance of future fracture. It is more conservative of the tooth structure than the full crown preparation, and its supragingival margins, when possible, are less irritating to the gingiva.

Three of the most common reactions, which a dentist should recognize, are the following: 1. Asymmetric tonic neck reflex. If the patient's head is suddenly turned to one side, the arm and leg on the side to which the face is turned extend and stiffen. The limbs on the opposite side flex. 2. Tonic labyrinthine reflex. If the patient's head suddenly falls backward while the patient is supine, the back may assume the position known as postural extension; the legs and arms straighten out, and the neck and back arch. 3. Startle reflex. This reflex, which is frequently observed in persons with cerebral palsy, consists of sudden, involuntary, often forceful bodily movements. This reaction is produced when the patient is surprised by stimuli, such as sudden noises or unexpected movements by other people.

His material should be removed if any of the following conditions are present: The old material may negatively affect the esthetic result of the new restoration (i. e., old amalgam material left under a new composite restoration). Radiographic evidence indicates caries lesion development under the old material and clinical evaluation confirms the radiographic interpretation. The tooth pulp was symptomatic preoperatively. The dentin along the periphery of the remaining old restorative material is soft, or Retention of the existing material is compromised and the material is easily dislodged. If none of these conditions is present, it is acceptable to leave the remaining old restorative material to serve as a base, rather than risk unnecessary excavation in close proximity to the pulp, which may result in pulpal irritation or exposure. Removal of remaining old restorative material, when indicated, may be accomplished using sharp rotary instruments and light intermittent pressure with or without water irrigation/cooling.

The ingestion of fluoride results in its incorporation into the dentin and enamel of unerupted teeth; this makes the teeth more resistant to acid attack after eruption into the oral cavity. In addition, ingested fluoride is secreted into saliva. Although it is present in low concentrations, the fluoride is accumulated in plaque, where it decreases microbial acid production and enhances the remineralization of the underlying enamel. Fluoride from saliva is also incorporated into the enamel of newly erupted teeth, thereby enhancing enamel calcification (frequently called enamel maturation), which decreases caries susceptibility.",

Over the years these difficulties have not decreased. There are several tools for predicting dental caries development. In 2012 Tellez conducted a systematic review of caries-risk assessment tools and concluded, \"There is an urgent need to develop valid and reliable methods for caries risk assessment that are based on best evidence for prediction and disease epidemiology management rather than opinions of experts. \" In this review the four most commonly used caries-risk assessment tools were reviewed (Cariogram, Caries Management by Risk Assessment, American Dental Association, and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry) and were found to be of equal value. The Cariogram has been evaluated and found to be more predictive in permanent teeth than with preschool children. The \"Cariogram\" is a computer caries-risk program that records several data points including past caries experience, diet, oral hygiene habits, fluoride exposures, and analysis of saliva. The program then produces the results as a coloured graph. This was well described by Gonzalez and Okunseri in 2010. Cariogram was given by Brathall et al in 1999. It is a method of illustrating the interaction of factor contributing to the development of caries.

Generally, dental lasers produce photothermal effects, with soft or hard tissue being ablated by the action. At low temperatures, below 100\u00b0 C, thermal effects denature proteins, produce hemolysis, and cause coagulation and shrinkage. Above 100\u00b0 C, water in soft or hard tissues boils, producing explosive expansion. Above approximately 400\u00b0 C, the carbonization of organic materials is completed with the onset of some inorganic changes. As the temperature increases from 400\u00b0 to 1400\u00b0 C, inorganic constituents change in chemistry, may melt and/or recrystallize, and may vaporize.

Decayed, missing, and filled teeth should be recorded separately since the components of DMF are of great interest. When counting the number of decayed teeth, also include those teeth, which have restorations with recurrent decay. Care must be taken to list as missing only those teeth, which have been lost due to decay. Also included should be those teeth which are so badly decayed that they are indicated for extraction. The following should not be counted as missing A) Unerupted teeth B) Missing teeth due to accident C) Congenitally missing teeth D) Teeth that have been extracted for orthodontic reasons. A tooth may have several restorations but it is counted as one tooth. Deciduous teeth are not included in DMF count. Tooth is considered to be erupted when the occlusal surface or incisal edge is totally exposed or can be exposed by gently reflecting the overlying gingival tissue with the mirror or explorer.

The method of radiographic cephalometry was later derived from long-established anthropologic craniometrics studies and the use of the Broadbent-Bolton cephalometer devised in 1931. The head positioning cephalometer (more commonly referred to today as a cephalostat) allowed serial lateral skull radiographs to be obtained in a standardized manner, thus creating reproducible beam/\ufb01lm/patient projection geometry. In turn, this standardization of radiographic projections allowed the precise measurement and comparison of oral and craniofacial structures, either directly on the radiograph, or through the use of superimposed tracings of bony anatomic landmarks obtained from the radiograph.

Activities to be performed by ASHA are as follows: Search for suspected cases of leprosy i. e. before any sign of disability appears. Such early detection will help in prevention of disability and also cut down transmission potential. Follow-up all cases for completion of treatment in scheduled time. During follow up visit, also look for symptoms of any reaction due to leprosy and refer them to the Health Workers/PHC for treatment. This will again reduce chances of disability occurring in cases under treatment. Advise and motivate self-care practices by disabled cases for proper care of their hands and feet during the follow-up period.

        "exp": "Effects of increase in vertical dimension Discomfort: Increasing the vertical dimension alters the environment in which unconscious movements of muscles during chewing take place and until the original condition is restored, discomfort will result. The jarring effect of teeth coming into contact sooner than expected also causes discomfort. Trauma: The sudden and frequent contacting of teeth causes trauma to the denture-bearing area, especially under the lower denture, where the area to resist pressure is less. TMJ problem: The constant tooth contact will also affect the TMJ causing soreness and pain. Bone resorption: The increased vertical height does not allow the muscles that close the mouth to complete their contraction. They will continue to exert force to overcome this obstruction and this will lead to resorption of supporting tissues. Muscular fatigue: Due to the constant effort of the muscles to close the mouth, muscular fatigue will also occur. Clicking of teeth: The premature contact of teeth sooner than what the individual is used to, will cause clicking of teeth. Facial distortion: There will be an inability to close the lips, which will produce a strained expression and elongation of face. Difficulty in swallowing and speech: The inability to close the lips will also cause difficulty in swallowing and speech. Effects of decrease in vertical dimension Inefficiency: The biting force exerted by the teeth in occlusion decreases which causes inefficient mastication. Cheek biting: The loss of muscle tone and reduced vertical height causes the flabby cheeks to become trapped during mastication. TMJ problem: The patient has to often protrude the mandible to occlude the teeth and this causes pain and clicking in the TMJ. Facial distortion: The following effects are seen: Nose appears closer to the chin Loss of lip fullness Loss of tonicity of muscles of facial expression Face appears flabby Patient appears older Angular cheilitis: The corners of the mouth form deep folds, which are bathed in saliva. This becomes infected and sore. Key Concept: A lack of interocclusal space results in excess pressure on ridges continuously. As a result of which, ridge resorption takes place.

The PI was intended to estimate deeper periodontal disease by measuring the presence or absence of gingival inflammation and its severity, pocket formation, and masticatory function. This index is reported to be useful among large populations but it is only of limited use for individuals or small groups. The PI is a composite index because it records both the reversible changes due to gingivitis and the more destructive and presumably irreversible changes brought about by deeper periodontal disease. The most important feature of Periodontal Disease Index is measurement of the level of the periodontal attachment related to the Cemento - Enamel Junction of the teeth.",

The yield strength is the stress required to produce the particular offset strain (0. 1% or 0. 2%) that has been chosen. The yield strength for 0. 2% offset is greater than that associated with an offset of 0. 1%. If yield strength values for two materials tested under the same conditions are to be compared, identical offset values should be used.

For most clasps, the retentive region is only at its terminus. Fourth, a nonretentive arm (or other component) should be present on the opposite side of the tooth for stabilization and reciprocation against horizontal movement of the prosthesis (rigidity of this clasp arm is essential to its purpose). Key Concept: Rest seat: The prepared recess in a tooth or restoration created to receive the occlusal, incisal, cingulum, or lingual rest. There should be a principal rest, as a component of RPD designed to direct stress along the long axis of the tooth. Note: Out of the given options, rest seat is not a component of RPD. Ref: Mc.

Mild class III malocclusions which present with a reverse overjet and an average overbite can be regarded as potentially treatable with functional appliances. Low angle cases (i. e., horizontal growers) respond well as most functional appliances encourage the development of posterior teeth. High angle (vertical growers) class II cases are usually of 2 categories - those with increased overbite and those with some degree of open bite. The deep overbite type of high angle cases are successfully treated using functional appliances while the open bite type of case poses a special problem. Most functional appliances allow vertical development of the posterior dentoalveolar structures, which may induce unwanted backward rotation of the mandible.",

If the sprue is too short, the wax pattern may be so far removed from the end of the casting ring that gases cannot be adequately vented to permit the molten alloy to fill the ring completely. When these gases are not completely eliminated, porosity may result. Therefore, the sprue length should be adjusted so that the top of the wax pattern is within 6 mm of the open end of the ring for gypsum-bonded investments. With the higher-strength phosphate-bonded investments, it may be possible to position the wax pattern within 3 to 4 mm of the top of the investment. For reproducibility of casting accuracy, the pattern should be placed as close as possible to the center of the ring. However, the position of the wax pattern for vacuum pressure casting may be different. Reference: PHILLIPS' SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 214, 215",

When properly placed, these features result in onlays that distribute the occlusal forces over most or all of the tooth and not just a portion of it, reducing the likelihood of fractures of teeth. The lingual \"skirt\" extension, the lingual \"collar\" preparation or the lingual surface groove extension on a maxillary molar protects the facial cusps from fracture.

        "exp": "During the time that the core of the mandible rotates forward an average of 15 degrees, the mandibular plane angle, representing the orientation of the jaw to an outside observer, decreases only 2 to 4 degrees on the average. The reason that the internal rotation is not expressed in jaw orientation, of course, is that surface changes (external rotation) tend to compensate. This means that the posterior part of the lower border of the mandible must be an area of resorption, while the anterior aspect of the lower border is unchanged or undergoes slight apposition. Studies of surface changes reveal exactly this as the usual pattern of apposition and resorption. On the average, then, there is about 15 degrees of internal, forward rotation and 11 to 12 degrees of external, backward rotation producing the 3 to 4 degree decrease in mandibular plane angle observed in the average individual during childhood and adolescence.

In just 5-minutes, the BANA Test can detect the bacteria associated with periodontal disease simply by applying tongue swabbings or subgingival plaques to a small test strip. The BANA Test is a modification of the BANA hydrolysis test developed by Dr. Walter Loesche and colleagues at the Univ. of Michigan School of Dentistry. It exploits an unusual Trysin like enzyme found in Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus, three anaerobic bacteria highly associated with adult periodontitis. Of 60 subgingival plaque species, only these three possess an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the the synthetic trypsin substrate, benzoyl-DL-arginine\u00adnaphthylamide (BANA) present on BANA test strips. If any of the three species is present, they hydrolize the BANA enzyme producing B-naphthylamide which in turn reacts with imbedded diazo dye to produce a permanent blue color indicating a positive test. How it works For periodontal risk assessment, subgingival plaque is obtained with a curette. The samples are placed on the BANA test strip, which is then inserted into a slot on a small toaster-sized incubator. The incubator automatically heats the sample to 55\u00b0 for 5 minutes. If P. gingivalis, B. forsythus or T. denticola are present, the test strip turns blue. The bluer it turns, the higher the concentration and the greater the number of organisms.",

These arterioles, entering the apical pulp, have a relatively low blood pressure, and the pressure drop from the arterioles entering the pulp to the venules leaving is only about one-fourth of the total arteriovenous pressure difference. Accordingly, a considerable part of the vascular resistance that regulates the pulpal blood circulation is located in the venules and also outside the pulp. This implies that changes in circulation in the neighboring adjacent tissues, such as the gingiva, alveolar bone, and PDL, will change the blood flow to the pulp because it will affect the feeding pulpal arterial blood pressure. Any vasodilation in tissues that receive their blood supply through side branches of the end arterioles feeding the pulp will, according to the Poisseuille law, steal blood pressure from the pulp. It should therefore be borne in mind that clinical treatment causing vasodilatation in adjacent tissues may decrease the circulation to the dental pulp. Thus, the mere application of a matrix may affect the pulpal circulation and cause a fall in pulpal blood flow. The pulp may become ischemic.",
