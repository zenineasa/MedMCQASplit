The vertical height of a finished lingual bar should be at least 4 mm for strength and rigidity (So total 8 mm space is minimum requirement between gingival margins and movable floor of mouth). If less than 8 mm exists between gingival margins and the movable floor of the mouth, a linguoplate, a sublingual bar (when the height of the floor of the mouth in relation to the free gingival margins will be less than 6 mm.) or a continuous bar is preferred as a major connector.

        "exp": "An important type of electrochemical corrosion is called concentration cell corrosion, which occurs whenever there are variations in the electrolytes or in the composition of the given electrolyte within the system. For example, there are often accumulations of food debris in the interproximal areas between the teeth, particularly if oral hygiene is poor. This debris then produces an electrolyte in that area, which is different from the electrolyte that is produced by normal saliva at the occlusal surface. Electrochemical corrosion of the alloy surface underneath the layer of food debris will take place in this situation. For most metallic dental appliances, the deleterious effects of stress and corrosion, called stress corrosion, are most likely to occur during fatigue or cyclic loading in the oral environment. When two dissimilar restorations are brought into contact, there is a sudden short-circuit through the two alloys. This can result in a sharp pain, called galvanic shock.

A function occlusal plane is drawn through the overlapping cusps of first premolars and first molars. Perpendiculars are drawn to the occlusal plane from points A and B. The points of contact of these perpendiculars on the occlusal plane are termed AO and BO. The distance between points AO and BO gives the anteroposterior relation between the two jaws. In case of males, point BO is ahead of AO by 1 mm, while in case of females, the points AO and BO coincide. In case of skeletal Class II tendency, BO is usually behind AO (read as a positive reading) while in skeletal Class III pattern, the point BO is located ahead of AO (read as a negative reading).",

Hybrid ionomers are often reported to have the highest capacity for recharging. It has also been reported that as the specimens age, their efficiencies of fluoride recharging decrease. Water soluble methacrylate-based monomers have been used to replace part of liquid component of conventional GIC resulting in a group of materials called resin-modified glass ionomer cements, also known as hybrid ionomer cement.

Supportive treatment: Alleviation of generalized toxic symptoms, such as fever and malaise. b. Etiotropic treatment: The correction of systemic conditions that contribute to the initiation or progress of the gingival changes. Antibiotics are administered systemically only in patients with toxic systemic complications or local adenopathy. They are not recommended in ANUG patients who do not have these complications. The antibiotic of choice is penicillin. Patients who are allergic to penicillin should be given erythromycin. Metronidazole may also be used. Supportive systemic treatment In addition to systemic antibiotics, supportive treatment consists of copious fluid consumption and administration of analgesics for the relief of pain. Bed rest is necessary for patients with toxic systemic complications such as high fever, malaise, anorexia, and general debility. In such cases, nutritional requirements also need to be kept in mind.

Coronal dentin is much more permeable than root dentin. Dentin permeability primarily depends on the remaining dentin thickness (i. e., length of the tubules) and the diameter of the tubules. Because the tubules are shorter, more numerous, and larger in diameter closer to the pulp, deep dentin is a less effective pulpal barrier compared with superficial dentin.

Also, the incidence of contact caries is less when compared to amalgam restorations (contact caries is the term applied to caries occurring on the proximal surface of the tooth adjacent to the restoration). The anti-cariogenic property is due to presence of 15% fluoride. Fluoride release is slow and occurs throughout the life of the restoration. Silicate cements were classed as a severe irritant to the pulp because of its low pH (acidic). For many years, silicate served as a standard for comparing the pulpal response to other materials. In deep cavities, the pulp had to be protected with varnish or calcium hydroxide. Ref- Manapallil 3rd Ed P: 88",

As a thick layer of calcium fluoride gets formed, it interferes with the further diffusion of fluoride from the topical fluoride solution to react with hydroxyapatite and blocks further entry of fluoride ions. This sudden stoppage of the entry of fluoride is termed as the \"Choking off effect\". Fluoride then slowly leaches from the calcium fluoride. Thus, calcium fluoride acts as a reservoir for fluoride release. It is for this reason that after each application of sodium fluoride onto the tooth surface, it is left to dry for 4 minutes.

        "exp": "Radiographs, tactile sensation, the presence of moisture on paper points, and knowledge of root morphology have been used to determine the length of root canal systems. Currently, the electronic apex locator is considered an accurate tool for determining working length. One study reported that the use of electronic apex locators in a dental student clinic resulted in a higher quality of obturation length control and an overall reduction in the number of radiographs taken. However, these devices must not be considered flawless, because several variables are known to affect their accuracy. For example, immature roots can present problems. Once roots mature (i. e., form a narrow apical foramen) and instruments are able to contact the canal walls, an electronic apex locator's accuracy greatly improves. Some investigators have found no statistical difference between roots with vital and necrotic tissue. Because apical root resorption is prevalent in necrotic cases with longstanding apical lesions, it may be concluded that apical resorption does not have a significant effect on the accuracy of electronic apex locators. Some clinicians have advocated the use of the electronically determined working length in lieu of working length estimations using the placement of a file in the canal and a radiograph. However, combined use of both of these techniques has been shown to result in greater accuracy. Furthermore, radiographs may add essential anatomic information that could be missed if electronic apex locators are used exclusively. Working length determination in elderly patients may be more difficult because of increased cementum deposition, modifying the apical anatomy. Ref: Cohen pathways of Pulp 11th ed page no 237",

The defective exocrine gland function leads to microobstruction of the pancreas, which results in cystic degeneration of the pancreas and, ultimately, a digestive enzyme deficiency producing malabsorption of nutrients. The defective gene products cause abnormal water and electrolyte transport across epithelial cells, which results in a chronic disease of the respiratory and gastrointestinal system, elevated levels of electrolytes in sweat, and impaired reproductive function. The incidence of dental caries in children with cystic fibrosis is low secondary to long-term antibiotic therapy, buffering capacity of excess calcium in the saliva, and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. There is a high incidence of mouth breathing and open-bite malocclusion associated with chronic nasal and sinus obstruction. Patients with cystic fibrosis may prefer to be treated in a more upright position to allow them to clear secretions more easily. The use of sedative agents that interfere with pulmonary function should be avoided, and the patient's physician should be contacted before nitrous oxide-oxygen sedation is used in a patient exhibiting evidence of severe emphysema.

Clinically effective levels of xylitol show MS strains with reduced adhesion to the teeth and other reduced virulence properties, such as less acid production. Xylitol has been tested as an additive to a variety of foods and to dentifrices. However, the vast majority of published data come from studies in which xylitol was incorporated into chewing gum. M\u00e4kinen has reported numerous studies on the topic, most of them performed with many different co-workers in different parts of the world. In 2000 he published a concise summary entitled, \"The Rocky Road of Xylitol to Its Clinical Application. \" A recent evidence-based review concluded that there is insufficient evidence that the use of xylitol gum, chlorhexidine varnish or gel, or calcium supplementation in mothers lowers the incidence of caries in their children. Clinicians may consider recommending xylitol use to moderate- or high-caries-risk patients. Those recommending xylitol should be familiar with the product labeling and recommend age-appropriate products. They should routinely reassess a child for changes in caries-risk status and adjust recommendations accordingly.",

Coronal dentin is much more permeable than root dentin. Dentin permeability primarily depends on the remaining dentin thickness (i. e., length of the tubules) and the diameter of the tubules.

The alloy combinations that may produce galvanic corrosion or electrogalvanism through the flow of galvanic currents may be in either continuous or intermittent contact. An example would be a dental amalgam restoration placed on the occlusal surface of a tooth directly opposing a gold inlay. Because both restorations are wet with saliva, an electrical circuit exists with a difference in potential between the dissimilar restorations. When the two restorations are brought into contact, there is a sudden short-circuit through the two alloys. This can result in a sharp pain, called galvanic shock.

Most population-based health promotion activities, such as encouraging less consumption of sugars to reduce caries risk, are primary preventive measures. Other examples of primary prevention in medicine and dentistry include the use of fluoridated toothpaste, and vaccinations for infectious diseases like measles, mumps, rubella, and polio. Secondary Prevention The focus of secondary prevention is early disease detection, making it possible to prevent the worsening of the disease and the emergence of symptoms, or to minimize complications and limit disabilities before the disease becomes severe. Secondary prevention also includes the detection of disease in asymptomatic patients, with screening or diagnostic testing and preventing the spread of communicable diseases. Examples in dentistry and medicine include screening for caries, periodontal screening and recording for periodontal disease, and screening for breast and cervical cancer. Tertiary Prevention The goal of tertiary prevention is to reduce the negative impact of an already-established disease by restoring function and reducing disease-related complications. Tertiary prevention also aims to improve the quality of life for people with disease. In medicine and dentistry, tertiary prevention measures include the use of amalgam and composite fillings for dental caries, replacement of missing teeth with bridges, implants, or dentures, or insulin therapy for Type II diabetes.",

Structurally, calcium ions replace the sodium or potassium ions of two adjacent molecules to produce a cross-linked complex or polymer network. The production of the calcium alginate is so rapid that it does not allow sufficient working time. A water-soluble phosphate salt (e. g., trisodium phosphate) is added to the composition as a retarder to extend the working time. The strategy is that the calcium ions will react preferentially with the phosphate ions in the solution. Thus, the rapid reaction between calcium ions and the soluble alginate is deferred until phosphate ions from trisodium phosphate are exhausted. The amount of retarder is adjusted to provide the proper setting time. A similar gelation process is expected with the modified alginate product.

As setting occurs, the acidity is partially neutralized, but the cement remains acidic after 24 hours, with the pH rising from about 3 to about 6. For thin layers of dentin, a cavity liner (i. e., Ca2) is recommended to prevent an adverse pulpal response from the pressure of luting, which forces acid into the pulp tissue. Younger patients are especially susceptible because they have a more open dentin tubule area, whereas older patients with sclerotic dentin will have a more tortuous path that restricts the penetration of acid toward the pulp.

The gelation process of alginate impressions produces not only insoluble calcium alginate but also sodium sulfate, which is a gypsum-setting accelerator at low concentration, but becomes a retarder at a higher concentration. In addition, polysaccharide also inhibits the setting of gypsum. Because of retardation, the surfaces of the gypsum models prepared from hydrocolloid may be too soft for use as dies or casts. The deficiency of gypsum setting can be overcome in two ways: By immersing the agar impression in a solution containing a gypsum accelerator, such as 2% potassium sulfate solution, prior to pouring the impression with the gypsum-forming product or By incorporating a gypsum surface hardener in the material, such as the sulfate used in the formulation for agar hydrocolloid and the potassium titanium fluoride used in alginate.

        "exp": "Copper cements are basically modified zinc phosphate cements. Silver salts or copper oxide are sometimes added to the powders of the zinc phosphate cements to increase their \u2018antibacterial' properties. Copper cements gradually fell out of favor because of their poor biological properties. It was highly acidic and the copper was considered toxic to the cell. This may have been due to the extremely high copper content (97%) in certain cements (Ames). There has been a renewed interest in copper cements recently. New formulations have come out with lower copper content (2%). It is claimed that these new generation copper cements are safe and is especially recommended for indirect pulp capping and where there is active caries. COMPOSITION Copper oxide (if cuprous oxide is used-cement is red, if cupric oxide is used, the cement is black) Zinc oxide Liquid used is clear phosphoric acid Key Concept Copper phosphate and silver phosphate cements were developed to impart antibacterial properties and fluorophosphate cements to impart anticariogenic properties to the zinc phosphate cements. However, these materials are not in use now as they possess many disadvantages compared to conventional zinc phosphate cements. Reference: Mannapallil p; 98",

The basic philosophy used in the development of the PMA, index was very similar to the DMF index, i. e, the number of gingival units affected were counted rather than the severity of the inflammation. Method A gingival unit was divided into three component parts 1. Papillary gingiva (P) - the gingival portion between the teeth. 2. Marginal gingiva (M) - the marginal collar surrounding the teeth. 3. Attached gingiva (A) -the gingival portion overlying the bony alveolar process The presence or absence of Inflammation on each gingival unit is recorded respectively. Although all of the facial tissues surrounding all the teeth could be assessed in this manner, usually only the maxillary and mandibular incisors, canines and premolars are examined The routine examination procedure from the maxillary right second premolar around to the maxillary left second premolar and then from the mandibular left second premolar to the mandibular right second premolar is followed In general, mild gingivitis is confined to the papillary area, moderate gingivitis means spread to marginal gingiva and severe gingivitis is identified by its spread to the attached gingiva. Scoring Criteria: Papillary Component (P) 0 Normal, no inflammation 1 + Mild papillary engorgement, slight increase in size. 2+ Obvious increase in size of gingival papilla; bleeding on pressure. 3+ Excessive increase in size with spontaneous bleeding. 4+ Necrotic papilla. 5+ Atrophy and loss of papilla (through inflammation).

Generally, patients who have a tooth sensitive to mastication have already percussed the tooth in question with their own finger tip(s) and informed the dentist which teeth are sensitive. Percussion is an indirect means of testing pulp vitality because teeth that are sensitive to percussion often have existing periapical lesions associated with a necrotic pulp. However, this is not always the case, and false positives can result if the clinician is evaluating a cracked tooth or a \u2018\u2018high'' restoration. If a crack has developed in the crown of a tooth with a vital pulp, the tooth can still be exquisitely sensitive, because of the crown segments, moving microscopically causes pain due to the movement of fluid in the odontoblastic tubules. The tooth is sensitive to thermal stimuli as the pulp is vital. These mutually exclusive diagnostic findings, pain to percussion/mastication and thermal sensitivity, are pathognomonic for a cracked tooth.",

        "exp": "The cause of green stain, which is most often seen on the teeth of children, is unknown, although it is believed to be the result of the action of chromogenic bacteria on the enamel cuticle. Boys are more frequently affected than girls. The colour of the stain varies from dark green to light yellowish-green. This tenacious deposit is seen most often in the gingival third of the labial surfaces of the maxillary anterior teeth. The stain collects more readily on the labial surfaces of the maxillary anterior teeth in mouth breathers. It tends to recur even after careful and complete removal. The enamel beneath the stain may be roughened or may have undergone initial demineralization. The roughening of the surface is believed to be related to the frequency of recurrence of the stain. Fungi (Penicillium and Aspergillus) and fluorescent bacteria have been associated with the discoloration.",

That is, the greater the force applied, the faster the fluid flows and the plot is a straight line. Pseudoplastic viscosity: The viscosity of many dental materials decreases with increasing strain rate until it reaches a nearly constant value. That is, the faster they are stirred, forced through a syringe, or squeezed, the less viscous and more fluid they become. Liquids that show the opposite behavior are dilatant and become more rigid as the rate of deformation (shear strain rate) increases. That is, the faster they are stirred, the more viscous and resistant to flow they become. Finally, some classes of materials behave like a rigid body until some minimum value of shear stress is reached. This is represented by the offset along the shear-stress axis. These fluids, which exhibit rigid behaviour initially and then attain constant viscosity, are referred to as plastic. The viscosity of most fluids decreases rapidly with increasing temperature. Viscosity may also depend on the previous deformation of the liquid. Such fluids become less viscous and more flowable upon repeated applications of pressure and are termed thixotropic. Key concept",

Type III gold, with a concentration of 72% gold, is the most commonly used gold alloy in dentistry; it is used to fabricate crowns and fixed partial dentures. Type IV gold has the lowest concentration of gold (69%) and was used for the fabrication of removable partial denture frameworks at one time, but rarely for that purpose now.
