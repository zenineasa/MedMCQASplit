Reparative dentin is generally atubular and therefore structurally diferent from the primary and secondary dentin.\nIn the case of mild injury (e.g., a shallow caries lesion), primary odontoblasts initiate increased formation of dentin along the internal aspect of the dentin beneath the affected area through secretion of reactionary tertiary dentin (or \u201creactionary dentin\u201d).

As this gas builds up within the amalgam, a significant delayed\u00a0expansion\u00a0 can\u00a0 occur\u00a0 and\u00a0 may\u00a0 cause\u00a0 protrusion\u00a0 of\u00a0 the amalgam\u00a0 from\u00a0 the\u00a0 cavity\u00a0 preparation,\u00a0 which\u00a0 enhances the possibility of fracture at the margins. If the restoration is improperly finished by the dentist,\u00a0a thin ledge of amalgam may be left that extends slightly over the enamel at the margins. These thin edges of such a brittle material cannot support the forces of mastication. In time they fracture, leaving an opening at the margins.

If local anesthesia is still present, it may be difficult for the patient to tell when the teeth are in contact. After the patient has reopened the mouth and the articulating paper is removed, the following two features of the occlusal relationship suggests that the restoration is high:\n\nCusp tips of adjacent teeth are not in occlusal contact, when it is known from the preoperative occlusal assessment that they should be touching.\nAn opposing cusp prematurely occludes with the new restoration.\n\nContact areas on the amalgam should be assessed by the color imparted by the articulating paper. Deeply colored areas (heavy contacts) and those with light-colored centres (even heavier contacts) are reduced until all markings are uniformly of a light hue, and contacts are noted on adjacent teeth. Heavy occlusal contacts are commonly referred to as \u201cprematurities\u201d or \u201chigh spots\u201d.

Here two adjacent metal restorations where the metal surfaces have different compositions. The alloy combinations that may produce galvanic corrosion or electrogalvanism through the flow of galvanic currents may be in either continuous or intermittent contact. An example would be a dental amalgam restoration placed on the occlusal surface of a tooth directly opposing a gold inlay. Because both restorations are wet with saliva, an electrical circuit exists with a difference in potential between the dissimilar restorations. When the two restorations are brought into contact, there is a sudden short-circuit through the two alloys.

The production of the calcium alginate is so rapid that it does not allow sufficient working time. A water-soluble phosphate salt (e.g., trisodium phosphate) is added to the composition as a retarder to extend the working time. The strategy is that the calcium ions will react preferentially with the phosphate ions in the solution. Thus, the rapid reaction between calcium ions and the soluble alginate is deferred until phosphate ions from trisodium phosphate are exhausted. The amount of retarder is adjusted to provide the proper setting time. A similar gelation process is expected with the modified alginate product.\nReference: PHILLIPS\u2019 SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 172",

The mother did state that the patient only sucks his thumb while falling asleep. When digit-sucking occurs for a limited time per day, not only is tooth movement normally associated with digit-sucking unlikely, it is possible for teeth to return to a more normalized position. Remember that the risk of malocclusion as related to habitual activity is a function of amount of time per day the habit is practiced, the duration of the habit in terms of weeks and months, and the intensity of the habit. Because the occlusion seems to be improving and because the habit has significantly decreased, the best treatment is to counsel the parent regarding thumb-sucking, and recall the patient in 3 months.",

In addition, polysaccharide also inhibits the setting of gypsum. Because of retardation, the surfaces of the gypsum models prepared from hydrocolloid may be too soft for use as dies or casts.\nThe deficiency of gypsum setting can be overcome in two ways: \n\nBy immersing the agar impression in a solution containing a gypsum accelerator, such as 2% potassium sulfate solution, prior to pouring the impression with the gypsum-forming product or\nBy incorporating a gypsum surface hardener in the material, such as the sulfate used in the formulation for agar hydrocolloid and the potassium titanium fluoride used in alginate.\n\nReference: PHILLIPS\u2019 SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 175",

Focal sclerosing osteomyelitis (FSO) consists of a localized, usually uniform zone of increased radiopacity adjacent to the apex of a tooth that exhibits a thickened periodontal ligament space or an apical inflammatory lesion. The size of the lesions usually measure less than 1 cm in diameter. There is no radiolucent halo surrounding this type of lesion. The osteitis microscopically appears as a mass of dense sclerotic bone. FSO is most often found in patients younger than 20 years of age, around the apices of mandibular teeth (most commonly molars) with large carious lesions and chronically inflamed pulps or with recent restorations. Most sources agree that the associated tooth may or may not be vital. Gender is not a predisposing factor. FSO can be asymptomatic or the patient can experience mild pain, depending on the cause. FSO is usually discovered upon radiographic analysis. It represents a chronic, low-grade inflammation.",

Generally, patients who have a tooth sensitive to mastication have already percussed the tooth in question with their own finger tip(s) and informed the dentist which teeth are sensitive. Percussion is an indirect means of testing pulp vitality because teeth that are sensitive to percussion often have existing periapical lesions associated with a necrotic pulp. However, this is not always the case, and false positives can result if the clinician is evaluating a cracked tooth or a \u2018\u2018high\u2019\u2019 restoration. If a crack has developed in the crown of a tooth with a vital pulp, the tooth can still be exquisitely sensitive, because of the crown segments, moving microscopically causes pain due to the movement of fluid in the odontoblastic tubules. The tooth is sensitive to thermal stimuli as the pulp is vital. These mutually exclusive diagnostic findings, pain to percussion/mastication and thermal sensitivity, are pathognomonic for a cracked tooth.",

        "exp": "MANDIBULAR SUBLINGUAL BAR\nIndications for Use: The sublingual bar should be used for mandibular removable partial dentures when the height of the floor of the mouth in relation to the free gingival margins will be less than 6 mm. It also may be indicated whenever it is desirable to keep the free gingival margins of the remaining anterior teeth exposed and depth of the floor of the mouth is inadequate to place a lingual bar.\nContraindications for Use: Remaining natural anterior teeth severely tilted toward the lingual.\nCharacteristics and Location: The sublingual bar is essentially the same half-pear shape as a lingual bar, except that the bulkiest portion is located to the lingual and the tapered portion is toward the labial. The superior border of the bar should be at least 3 mm from the free gingival margin of the teeth. The inferior border is located at the height of the alveolar lingual sulcus when the patient\u2019s tongue is slightly elevated. This necessitates a functional impression of the lingual vestibule to accurately register the height of the vestibule.\nKey Concept:\nThe sublingual bar should be used for\u00a0mandibular removable partial dentures when the height of\u00a0the floor of the mouth in relation to the free gingival margins will be less than 6 mm.\nRef: McCrackens Removable Partial Denture Ed 13th Pg 53",

The prevalence may be more in boys because of their physical activity.\nPrevalence of injuries is more in maxillary central incisors followed by maxillary laterals, mandibular centrals and laterals.\n\nReference: Pediatric Dentistry Principles and Practice SECOND EDITION, MS Muthu; pdf no 859",

On examination anterior open bite is seen along with flaring of incisors. Which of these physiologic adaptation can result in malocclusion eventually",
        "exp": "When there is an anterior open bite and/or upper incisor protrusion , as often occurs from sucking habits, it is more difficult to seal off the front of the mouth during swallowing to prevent food or liquids from escaping. Bringing the lips together and placing the tongue between the separated anterior teeth is a successful maneuver to close off the front of the mouth and form an anterior seal. In other words, a tongue thrust swallow is a useful physiologic adaptation if you have an open bite, which is why an individual with an open bite usually also has a tongue thrust swallow, but protruding the tongue between the anterior teeth during swallowing is often present in children with good anterior occlusion. After sucking habit stops, the anterior open bite tends to close spontaneously , but the position of the tongue between the anterior teeth persists for a while as the open bite closes. Until the open bite disappears, an anterior seal by the tongue tip remains necessary.",
