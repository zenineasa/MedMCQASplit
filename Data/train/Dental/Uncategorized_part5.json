Likewise, the adjacent tooth contour may dictate specific preparation extensions that enable the creation of appropriate proximal restoration form. \"Prophylactic odontotomy\" procedures were used in the past. These more aggressive procedures involved preparing developmental or structural imperfections of the enamel that were thought to be at increased risk of caries and filling the preparation with amalgam to prevent caries from developing in these sites.

Increase in the anterior length of the dental arches: Permanent incisors erupt labial to the primary incisors to obtain an added space of 2-3 mm. Change in inclination of permanent incisors: Primary teeth are upright, but permanent teeth incline to the labial surface, thus decreasing the inter-incisal angle from about 150o in the deciduous dentition to 123o in the permanent dentition.

Sometimes the patient may not even be able to specify whether the symptoms are emanating from the maxillary or mandibular arch. In these instances, when pulp testing is inconclusive, selective anesthesia may be helpful. If the patient cannot determine which arch the pain is coming from, then the clinician should first selectively anesthetize the maxillary arch. This should be accomplished by using a periodontal ligament (intraligamentary) injection. The injection is administered to the most posterior tooth in the quadrant of the arch that may be suspected, starting from the distal sulcus. The anesthesia is subsequently administered in an anterior direction, one tooth at a time, until the pain is eliminated. If the pain is not eliminated after an appropriate period of time, then the clinician should similarly repeat this technique on the mandibular teeth below. It should be under-stood that periodontal ligament injections may anesthetize an adjacent tooth and thus are more useful for identifying the arch rather than the specific tooth.

Which of the following ions is not released by this material?",
        "exp": "Ariston is a light-cured filling material indicated for posterior restoration. Its monomer matrix consists of a mixture of dimethylmethacrylates and inorganic fillers include alkaline glass, Ba-Al fluorosilicate glass, ytterbium trifluoride and highly dispersed silicon dioxide. It also contains a catalyst and stabilizers. Its color is white so that, for aesthetic reasons, it is more acceptable than amalgam. According to the first research reports, Ariston is releasing three different types of ions (fluoride, calcium, hydroxyl). The release of these ions depends on the pH value. When the pH value in the oral cavity is low due to active plaque, Ariston releases significantly higher amounts of ions than it does with neutral pH values. The ion effects are as follows: Fluoride ions hamper demineralization, promote remineralization and inhibit bacterial growth. Calcium ions hamper demineralization and promote remineralization. Hydroxyl ions neutralize the acid produced by cariogenic bacteria and inhibit bacterial growth. Ref: Kukletov\u00e1 M, Kuklov\u00e1 J, Christoforidis G. Ariston p. Hc restorative material.

Space for the light-body \"wash\" material is provided either by cutting away some of the \"tray\" putty or by using a thin polyethylene sheet as a spacer between the putty and the prepared teeth during preliminary impression making. One can also generate the space by vacuum forming a blank plastic sheet on a cast and then make the impression with the putty material. A mixture of the thin-consistency wash material is placed into the putty impression and on the preparation; then the tray is reseated in the mouth to make the final impression.

Restorations for hypoplastic primary or permanent teeth that cannot be adequately restored with bonded restorations. Restorations for teeth with hereditary anomalies, such as dentinogenesis imperfecta or amelogenesis imperfecta. Restorations for pulpotomized or pulpectomized primary or young permanent teeth when there is increased danger of fracture of the remaining coronal tooth structure. Restorations for fractured teeth. Restorations for primary teeth to be used as abutments for appliances. Attachments for habit-breaking and orthodontic appliances. The composite materials have proved to provide a more satisfactory interim restoration for many of these teeth. Such a bonded composite build-up restoration allows for the preservation of all sound tooth structure and depends on the presence of some enamel surfaces to provide bonded retention for the restorative material. Any soft defective areas are excavated, but little or no additional tooth preparation is done. Usually even undermined enamel surfaces are preserved for additional retention and support of the restorative material.",

        "exp": "Late mesial shift The second transitional period is completed with the eruption of second molars at the age of 12 years. In this period, class I permanent molar occlusion is achieved by a late mesial shift of the mandibular permanent molars. The difference in the combined mesiodistal dimensions of the primary canine, first and second molar in each quadrant is greater than the combined mesio-distal dimensions of the permanent premolars and canine. This excess of space, i. e, Leeway space is greater in the mandibular arch as compared to the maxillary arch. The erupting permanent molars migrate mesially in the occlusal path, more mesial in the mandible and thereby establishing a Class I cusp to fossa relationship. These movements transform the straight terminal plane relationship of primary molars into a mesial step relationship. This phenomenon occurs mostly with closed primary dentition, where interdental spaces do not exist and primary second molars are in a straight terminal plane relationship. In this condition, an early mesial shift is not possible. The permanent maxillary, mandibular first molars emerge into a cusp-to-cusp relationship, but move to a class I relationship later. This change has been referred to as the late mesial shift. The late mesial shift is facilitated with the use of leeway space. OP Kharbanda 2nd ED",

Working independently in Adelaide, Begg also concluded that extraction of teeth was often necessary, and set out to adapt the ribbon arch appliance so that it could be used for better control of root position. Begg's adaptation took three forms: He replaced the precious metal ribbon arch with high-strength 16-mil round stainless steel wire when this became available from an Australian company in the late 1930s; He retained the original ribbon arch bracket, but turned it upside down so that the bracket slot pointed gingivally rather than occlusally; and He added auxiliary springs to the appliance for control of root position. In the resulting Begg appliance friction was minimized because the area of contact between the narrow ribbon arch bracket and the archwire was very small and the force of the wire against the bracket was also small. Binding was minimized because Begg's strategy for anchorage control was tipping and uprighting, and tipping minimizes the angle of contact between the wire and corner of the bracket.",

Apexogenesis is a treatment designed to preserve vital pulp tissue in the apical part of a root canal so that formation of the root apex may be completed. The clinical procedure is essentially a deep pulpotomy undertaken to preserve the formative capacity of the radicular pulp in immature teeth that have deep pulpal inflammation. Examples include carious exposures and some trauma cases in which treatment of the exposed pulp is delayed and it becomes necessary to extend farther into the canal to reach healthy tissue.",

The most commonly used accelerator is potassium sulfate, which is particularly effective in concentrations greater than 2%.

The composition of all these tempers is reported to be the same, the difference being in the wire processing methods. Blue (soft): The blue wire is the softest of the four wire tempers; it can be bent easily into the desired shapes. It is recommended for use, when considerable wire bending is needed such as multiple loop wires. Yellow (ductile): It is more resilient than blue elgiloy, but can also be bent with relative ease. Green (semi-resilient): It is more resilient than yellow. Red (resilient): Red Elgiloy wire is the hardest and most resilient elgiloy and provides high spring qualities. Careful manipulation is recommended when using this wire because it withstands only minimal working. Heat treatment makes red elgiloy remarkably resilient, but brittle.

Almost all authorities recognize that persistent digit-sucking habits extending into the incisor transition period can cause a malocclusion or aggravate an already existing one. Pressure generated from the habit can produce changes in the anterior segments of the dental arches, with labial flaring and protrusive spacing of maxillary anterior teeth and increased overjet.

        "exp": "Some guides have given atopic dermatitis and I would like to exclude this option first: \u00ad Exclusion of atopic dermatitis This child is presenting at the age of 7 years with a history of disease starting 3 years back -> that means the disease was started at 4 years of age. There is involvement of the forehead (face) and exposed part of arms and legs. You can easily exclude atopic dermatitis:- In childhood atopic dermatitis neither face is involved nor exposed part of extrimities. There is involvement of flexures (and sometime extensor surfaces). Exclusion of urticaria Urticaria presents as itchy mythmatous lesions which are transient. Lesions are usually not excoriated (as given in question) patients tend to rub rather than scratch their lesions. Further, there are many types of urtacaria (e. g. cholinergic, cold etc), but no one is improved in winter, (rather cold urticaria is precipitated by cold weather). Eclusion of scabies In scabies burrows are a very important feature (not present in this child). Areas involved are:- Fingers, web spaces, palms wrist, points of elbow, the buttocks, the abdomen, anterior axillary fold, the legs and feet. Usually, there is a history of exposure or multiple cases in the family. Now we are left with insect bite hypersensitivity; you can go ahead simply by the exclusion of other 3 options. If you still require some explanation, read below:- Insect bite hypersensitivity In this question, the lesions are on a face (forehead) and other exposed part of extremities -> you know insect bite is on exposed parts. Lesions are most severe in rainy season -> Rainy season is the period when there are maximum numbers of insects. \"Insect bites, fungal infections and bacterial infections are aggravated in the summer/rainy season\". Lesions improved in winter -> most of the insects disappear during winter. So, this child is most likely suffering from localized (lesions are on the sites of bite, i. e. exposed area) due to a repeated bite of the insect.",

The guidelines all acknowledge that, in some cases, radiographs are not possible, in which case, one should balance the benefit against the risk even more carefully. Sometimes it is better to postpone the radiographic exposure until the patient is older or better conditioned. The guidelines also clearly state that if there are no clinical signs of pathology, the need for a radiographic assessment is up to the professional's judgment, and that these decisions have to be made on an individual patient basis.

If this distortion is severe, surgical closure of lip, will become extremely difficult. So orthodontic intervention to reposition the segments and to bring the protruding premaxillary segment back into the arch may be needed to obtain a good surgical repair of lip. This is achieved by \"infant orthopedics\". Infant orthopedics was pioneered by Burston. In a child with bilateral cleft, the maxillary segment requires two movements i. e., lateral expansion and posterior reposition. This movement is accomplished by a Light elastic strap across anterior segment. In infants, the segments can be repositioned surprisingly, quickly and easily, so that the period of active treatment is only a few weeks at most. If pre-surgical movement of maxillary segment is needed, this typically would be done beginning at 3 to 6 weeks of age, so that the lip closure could be carried out approximately 10 weeks. A passive plate similar to an orthodontic retainer is then used for a few months after lip closure.",

        "exp": "DIAGNOdent is an instrument designed to facilitate the detection and quantification of dental caries on occlusal and smooth surfaces (Kaltenbach & Voigt GmbH & Co., Biberach/Riss, Germany). It uses a diode laser light source and a fibreoptic cable that transmits the light to a handheld probe with a fibreoptic eye in the tip. The light is absorbed and induces infrared fluorescence by organic and inorganic material. The emitted fluorescence is collected at the probe tip, transmitted through ascending fibres, and processed and presented on a display window as an integer between 0 and 99. Increased fluorescence reflects potential caries-affected tooth substance. The identity of the material responsible that DIAGNOdent is capable of detecting relatively advanced caries lesions, and DIAGNOdent readings show a very good correlation with histologic evidence of caries, but not with the depths of the lesions in dentin. Conventional clinical caries examinations routinely use transillumination to identify lesions located on the interproximal surfaces of the anterior teeth. For at least 30 years a fibreoptic transillumination (FOTI) instrument has been available for clinical use. It provides an intense light beam that is transmitted through a fibreoptic cable to a specially designed probe to permit the use of transillumination on the proximal surfaces of posterior teeth, Repeated improvements have been made in the instrument so that it may be used on occlusal and proximal tooth surfaces and the instrument is commonly used, often in place of radiographs, in private practices in Europe.",

An improved selective media with an acidic pH having high amounts of acetate, salts and lower surface tension that is highly selective for growth of Lactobacillus is the Rogosa's medium. The colonies grown on media upon incubation reflect the number of aciduric flora in the patient's saliva.

        "exp": "-DEVELOPMENT OF RESIDUAL COMPRESSIVE STRESSES The fabrication of metal-ceramic and all-ceramic prostheses usually involves sintering the ceramic at high temperature or hot-pressing a veneering ceramic onto the metal or core ceramic. The process of cooling to room temperature offers the opportunity to take advantage of mismatches in coefficients of thermal contraction of adjacent materials in the ceramic structure. -MINIMIZING THE NUMBER OF FIRING CYCLES The purpose of porcelain firing procedures is to densely sinter the particles of powder together and produce a relatively smooth, glassy layer (glaze) on the surface. In some cases a stain layer is applied for shade adjustment or for characterization, such as stain lines or fine cracks. -ION EXCHANGE The technique of ion exchange is an effective method of introducing residual compressive stresses into the surface of a ceramic. -THERMAL TEMPERING Perhaps the most common method for strengthening glasses is by thermal tempering, which creates residual surface compressive stresses by rapidly cooling the surface of the object while it is hot and in the softened (molten) state. This rapid cooling produces a skin of rigid glass surrounding a soft (molten) core. As the molten core solidifies, it tends to shrink, but the outer skin remains rigid. The pull of the solidifying molten core, as it shrinks, creates residual tensile stresses in the core and residual compressive stresses within the outer surface.

Zinc oxide eugenol is said to have anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Its limitations are slow resorption, irritation to the periapical tissues, necrosis of bone and cementum and alters the path of erupting teeth. When ZOE mixture is used, thin mixture is used to coat the walls of the canal, followed by a thick mixture that can be manually condensed into the lumen of the canal. Barr et al. showed 82. 3 percent clinical success rate, Gould showed 86. 1 percent, Coll et al. showed 86. 1 percent clinical success rate. Barcelos et al. showed 85 percent of clinical success with ZOE but the overfilling was evident even after evaluation period. Reference: Pediatric Dentistry by Nikhil Marwah 3rd ed, page no 672",

Although the esthetic result appears much better than that obtained from external bleaching, this approach involves all the inherent risks otherwise associated with endodontic treatment. External bleaching techniques offer a safer alternative, although they may not be as rapid or effective. Patients who have darkly stained teeth always should be informed that although porcelain (or composite) veneers can result in improved esthetics, they may not entirely eliminate or mask extremely dark stains. Because of the limited thickness of the veneers and the absolute necessity of incorporating intrinsic opacity, the realistic translucency or esthetic vitality of veneered teeth may never be comparable with that of natural, unaffected teeth. Full porcelain coverage with all-ceramic crowns may be indicated in some patients with severe discoloration because of the crown's greater capacity to restore esthetic vitality.
