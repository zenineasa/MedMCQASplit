Successful host-defense repair processes result in the remineralization of the intertubular dentin, in addition to the mineral occlusion of the dentinal tubules, such that the final hardness of the dentin in this affected area is greater than normal primary dentin. The increased overall mineralization of this caries-affected primary dentin is referred to as reactive dentin sclerosis. Deep dentin formation processes occur simultaneously with the pulpal inflammatory response and result in the generation of tertiary dentin at the pulp-dentin interface.

Type III gold, with a concentration of 72% gold, is the most commonly used gold alloy in dentistry. It is used to fabricate crowns and fixed partial dentures. Type IV gold has the lowest concentration of gold (69%), and was used for the fabrication of removable partial denture frameworks at one time, but rarely for that purpose now.

Sassouni pointed out that the horizontal anatomic planes-the inclination of the anterior cranial base, Frankfort plane, palatal plane, occlusal plane, and mandibular plane-tend to converge toward a single point in well-proportioned faces. If the planes intersect relatively close to the face and diverge quickly as they pass anteriorly, the facial proportions are long anteriorly and short posteriorly, which predisposes the individual to an open bite malocclusion. Sassouni coined the term skeletal open bite for this anatomic relationship. If the planes are nearly parallel, so that they converge far behind the face and diverge only slowly as they pass anteriorly, there is a skeletal predisposition toward anterior deep bite, and the condition is termed skeletal deep bite.",

The set cement gains approximately 70% of its maximum strength in the first 30 minutes. The strength continues to rise with time and maximum strength is attained at the end of 24 hours. The strength of zinc phosphate cement is sufficient when used as a base or luting agent. However, when it is exposed to the oral environment, e. g. temporary restorations, its brittleness and low strength causes it to fracture and disintegrate. Also, the prolonged contact with the oral fluids or water gradually reduces its strength. This may be due to the slow dissolution of the cement. TENSILE STRENGTH The set cement is weaker in tension (5. 5 MPa), thus making it brittle.

        "exp": "Traditionally, dentists have relied upon a visual-tactile radiographic procedure for the detection of dental caries. This procedure involves the visual identification of demineralized areas (typically white spots) or suspicious pits or fissures and the use of the dental explorer to determine the presence of a loss of continuity or breaks in the enamel and to assess the softness or resilience of the enamel. Caries lesions located on interproximal tooth surfaces have generally been detected with the use of bitewing radiographs. These procedures have been used routinely in virtually every dental office in the United States for the past 50 years. Tactile probing with an explorer is no longer used for caries detection in most European countries, and this protocol has now been adopted by many U. S. dental schools. The primary concerns that led to the discontinuation of the probing procedure were as follows: (1) the insertion of the explorer into the suspected lesion inevitably disrupts the surface layer covering very early lesions, thereby eliminating the possibility for remineralization of the decalcified area; (2) the probing of lesions and suspected lesions results in the transport of cariogenic bacteria from one area to another; and (3) frank lesions requiring restoration are generally apparent visually without the need for probing.",

Reliability and validity of the method were tested, with favorable results. At the University of Washington, several clinical studies have been and are continuing to be performed, using this technique as one of several methods of assessing pretreatment status and posttreatment change.

        "exp": "Respiratory needs are the primary determinant of the posture of the jaws and tongue (and of the head itself, to a lesser extent). Therefore it seems entirely reasonable that an altered respiratory pattern, such as breathing through the mouth rather than the nose, could change the posture of the head, jaw, and tongue. This in turn could alter the equilibrium of pressures on the jaws and teeth and affect both jaw growth and tooth position. To breathe through the mouth, one must lower the mandible and tongue and extend (tip back) the head. If these postural changes were maintained, three effects on growth would be expected: (1) anterior face height would increase, and posterior teeth would super-erupt; (2) unless there was unusual vertical growth of the ramus, the mandible would rotate down and back, opening the bite anteriorly and increasing overjet; and (3) increased pressure from the stretched cheeks might cause a narrower maxillary dental arch. Chronic respiratory obstruction can be produced by prolonged inflammation of the nasal mucosa associated with allergies or chronic infection. It can also be produced by mechanical obstruction anywhere within the naso-respiratory system, from the nares to the posterior nasal choanae. Under normal conditions, the size of the nostril is the limiting factor in nasal airflow. The pharyngeal tonsils or adenoids normally are large in children, and partial obstruction from this source may contribute to mouth breathing in children. Individuals who have had chronic nasal obstruction may continue to breathe partially through the mouth even after the obstruction has been relieved. In this sense, mouth breathing can sometimes be considered a habit.",

Family Oral Health Card - Addresses all the unique and special oral health needs of the total family from babies to adults. The card holder with free- dental check -up can take the family on a healthy and safe lifestyle trip beginning with good oral health. Corporate Oral Health Card - Ensures convenient access to the best and most cost- effective oral health check-up. Check-up of oral health alerts the individual about health complications like cardio vascular disease, diabetes, stroke, Alzheimer etc which reflect in the mouth. Platinum Oral Health Card - Targeted at oral check-ups for elders, as we age salivary flow decreases which results in tooth decay and difficulty in eating, speaking and swallowing thereby affecting general health and quality of life. Oral check-ups maintain \"Teeth are for life\". Special Previlege Card - Holders can avail oral check-ups for disabled and mentally retarded people. They are more prone to tooth decay or gum diseases and are at a higher risk. They need special care as oral health awareness is low and lack coordination of body. Muskaan - Cards can be used by rural Indian for check-ups which are vital in the rural areas because dentist to population ratio is dismally low with less than 2% dentists being available for 72% of rural population. This card introduces preventive, interceptive, curative and educational oral health care.",

These spaces are called physiological spaces or developmental spaces. Physiological generalized spacing is common and is usual and desirable in deciduous dentition to accommodate large succeeding permanent teeth. It is average 4 mm in the upper arch and 3 mm in the lower arch. It is possible to use spacing between lower deciduous teeth for predicting the degree of crowding. Absence of spaces in the primary dentition is an indication that crowding of teeth may occur in permanent dentition.

But since isolation of these areas is difficult, the use of direct filling gold is decreased. Dental amalgam is easy to manipulate, can be used in areas which are difficult to isolate and has self-sealing property. Traditional glass-ionomer cements have the desirable properties of being biocompatible, bonding chemically to tooth and showing anticariogenicity. But they have poor esthetics and excessive wear with time. Resin-modified glass ionomers are biocompatible, bond to tooth, have thermal expansion and contraction characteristics that match tooth structure, and fluoride releasing feature. Microfilled composites are recommended for root surface restorations as they have lower elastic modulus than hybrid composites. This is an advantageous property, since the teeth flex during mastication and a flexible material will be a better choice to restore the root surface. Nisha Garg, Amit Garg.

        "exp": "When discussing caries risk and introducing the \"Cariogram, \" Petersson repeated the complex nature of dental caries and the difficulties in predicting the development of the disease in any one patient. Over the years these difficulties have not decreased. There are several tools for predicting dental caries development. In 2012 Tellez conducted a systematic review of caries-risk assessment tools and concluded, \"There is an urgent need to develop valid and reliable methods for caries risk assessment that are based on best evidence for prediction and disease epidemiology management rather than opinions of experts. \" In this review the four most commonly used caries-risk assessment tools were reviewed (Cariogram, Caries Management by Risk Assessment, American Dental Association, and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry) and were found to be of equal value. The Cariogram has been evaluated and found to be more predictive in permanent teeth than with preschool children. The \"Cariogram\" is a computer caries-risk program that records several data points including past caries experience, diet, oral hygiene habits, fluoride exposures, and analysis of saliva. The program then produces the results as a coloured graph. This was well described by Gonzalez and Okunseri in 2010. Cariogram was given by Brathall et al in 1999. It is a method of illustrating the interaction of factor contributing to the development of caries. The different colors are as follows: red for bacteria, dark blue for diet, light blue for susceptibility-related factors, and yellow for circumstances.

The method of radiographic cephalometry was later derived from long-established anthropologic craniometrics studies and the use of the Broadbent-Bolton cephalometer devised in 1931. The head positioning cephalometer (more commonly referred to today as a cephalostat) allowed serial lateral skull radiographs to be obtained in a standardized manner, thus creating reproducible beam/\ufb01lm/patient projection geometry. In turn, this standardization of radiographic projections allowed the precise measurement and comparison of oral and craniofacial structures, either directly on the radiograph, or through the use of superimposed tracings of bony anatomic landmarks obtained from the radiograph.

Activities to be performed by ASHA are as follows: Search for suspected cases of leprosy i. e. before any sign of disability appears. Such early detection will help in prevention of disability and also cut down transmission potential. Follow-up all cases for completion of treatment in scheduled time. During follow up visit, also look for symptoms of any reaction due to leprosy and refer them to the Health Workers/PHC for treatment. This will again reduce chances of disability occurring in cases under treatment. Advise and motivate self-care practices by disabled cases for proper care of their hands and feet during the follow-up period.

        "exp": "Effects of increase in vertical dimension Discomfort: Increasing the vertical dimension alters the environment in which unconscious movements of muscles during chewing take place and until the original condition is restored, discomfort will result. The jarring effect of teeth coming into contact sooner than expected also causes discomfort. Trauma: The sudden and frequent contacting of teeth causes trauma to the denture-bearing area, especially under the lower denture, where the area to resist pressure is less. TMJ problem: The constant tooth contact will also affect the TMJ causing soreness and pain. Bone resorption: The increased vertical height does not allow the muscles that close the mouth to complete their contraction. They will continue to exert force to overcome this obstruction and this will lead to resorption of supporting tissues. Muscular fatigue: Due to the constant effort of the muscles to close the mouth, muscular fatigue will also occur. Clicking of teeth: The premature contact of teeth sooner than what the individual is used to, will cause clicking of teeth. Facial distortion: There will be an inability to close the lips, which will produce a strained expression and elongation of face. Difficulty in swallowing and speech: The inability to close the lips will also cause difficulty in swallowing and speech. Effects of decrease in vertical dimension Inefficiency: The biting force exerted by the teeth in occlusion decreases which causes inefficient mastication. Cheek biting: The loss of muscle tone and reduced vertical height causes the flabby cheeks to become trapped during mastication. TMJ problem: The patient has to often protrude the mandible to occlude the teeth and this causes pain and clicking in the TMJ. Facial distortion: The following effects are seen: Nose appears closer to the chin Loss of lip fullness Loss of tonicity of muscles of facial expression Face appears flabby Patient appears older Angular cheilitis: The corners of the mouth form deep folds, which are bathed in saliva. This becomes infected and sore. Key Concept: A lack of interocclusal space results in excess pressure on ridges continuously. As a result of which, ridge resorption takes place.

In the mandibular arch, however, when the lateral incisors erupt, there is on the average 1. 6 mm less space available for the four mandibular incisors than would be required to perfectly align them.

Mild class III malocclusions which present with a reverse overjet and an average overbite can be regarded as potentially treatable with functional appliances. Low angle cases (i. e., horizontal growers) respond well as most functional appliances encourage the development of posterior teeth. High angle (vertical growers) class II cases are usually of 2 categories - those with increased overbite and those with some degree of open bite. The deep overbite type of high angle cases are successfully treated using functional appliances while the open bite type of case poses a special problem. Most functional appliances allow vertical development of the posterior dentoalveolar structures, which may induce unwanted backward rotation of the mandible.",

When these gases are not completely eliminated, porosity may result. Therefore, the sprue length should be adjusted so that the top of the wax pattern is within 6 mm of the open end of the ring for gypsum-bonded investments. With the higher-strength phosphate-bonded investments, it may be possible to position the wax pattern within 3 to 4 mm of the top of the investment. For reproducibility of casting accuracy, the pattern should be placed as close as possible to the center of the ring. However, the position of the wax pattern for vacuum pressure casting may be different. Reference: PHILLIPS' SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 214, 215",

        "exp": "During the time that the core of the mandible rotates forward an average of 15 degrees, the mandibular plane angle, representing the orientation of the jaw to an outside observer, decreases only 2 to 4 degrees on the average. The reason that the internal rotation is not expressed in jaw orientation, of course, is that surface changes (external rotation) tend to compensate. This means that the posterior part of the lower border of the mandible must be an area of resorption, while the anterior aspect of the lower border is unchanged or undergoes slight apposition. Studies of surface changes reveal exactly this as the usual pattern of apposition and resorption. On the average, then, there is about 15 degrees of internal, forward rotation and 11 to 12 degrees of external, backward rotation producing the 3 to 4 degree decrease in mandibular plane angle observed in the average individual during childhood and adolescence.

In just 5-minutes, the BANA Test can detect the bacteria associated with periodontal disease simply by applying tongue swabbings or subgingival plaques to a small test strip. The BANA Test is a modification of the BANA hydrolysis test developed by Dr. Walter Loesche and colleagues at the Univ. of Michigan School of Dentistry. It exploits an unusual Trysin like enzyme found in Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus, three anaerobic bacteria highly associated with adult periodontitis. Of 60 subgingival plaque species, only these three possess an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing the the synthetic trypsin substrate, benzoyl-DL-arginine\u00adnaphthylamide (BANA) present on BANA test strips. If any of the three species is present, they hydrolize the BANA enzyme producing B-naphthylamide which in turn reacts with imbedded diazo dye to produce a permanent blue color indicating a positive test. How it works For periodontal risk assessment, subgingival plaque is obtained with a curette. The samples are placed on the BANA test strip, which is then inserted into a slot on a small toaster-sized incubator. The incubator automatically heats the sample to 55\u00b0 for 5 minutes. If P. gingivalis, B. forsythus or T. denticola are present, the test strip turns blue. The bluer it turns, the higher the concentration and the greater the number of organisms.",

The spheno-occipital synchondrosis closes by 13-15 years of age. Growth at the spheno-occipital synchondrosis causes elongation of the middle portion of the cranial base as a result of primary displacement, while growth at the posterior part leads to \ufb02exion in the cranial base, since the posterior part of spheno-occipital synchondrosis has a greater amount of bone formation in its inferior part than its superior part. Key Concept: Anterior and posterior cranial base lengths increase because of bony deposition, as well as growth at the spheno-occipital and sphenoethmoidal synchondroses. Postnatally, the posterior cranial base becomes longer primarily due to growth at the spheno-occipital synchondrosis.

However, the manner and time sequence in which the pulp becomes necrotic allow a great deal of potential for successful intervention in maintaining pulp vitality. The first reaction after an injury is hemorrhage and local inflammation. Subsequent inflammatory changes are usually proliferative, but can be destructive. It is expected that within the first 24 hours after the injury, a proliferative response with inflammation will extend no more than 2 mm into the pulp. In time, however, microbial infection will result in local pulp necrosis and a slow apical spread of pulpal inflammation. Treatment Treatment options are: (1) Vital pulp therapy comprising pulp capping, partial pulpotomy, and full pulpotomy, OR (2) Pulpectomy. The choice of treatment depends on the stage of development of the tooth, the time between the accident and treatment, concomitant periodontal injury, and the restorative treatment plan.

The entering metal impinges onto the mold surface at this point and creates a higher localized mold temperature in this region, known as a hot spot. A hot spot may retain a localized pool of molten metal after other areas of the casting have solidified. This, in turn, creates a shrinkage void or suck-back porosity. This type of porosity defect can be eliminated by flaring the point of sprue attachment and reducing the mold-metal temperature differential-that is, lowering the casting temperature by about 30\u00b0C.

Crowns of canines in young jaws impinge on developing lateral incisor roots, thus driving the roots medially and causing the crowns to flare laterally. The roots of the central incisors are also forced together thus causing a maxillary midline diastema. The period from the eruption of lateral incisor to canine is termed as the Ugly Duckling stage. It is an unaesthetic metamorphosis, which eventually leads to an aesthetic result. With eruption of canines, the impingement from the roots shifts incisally thus driving the incisor crowns medially, resulting in closure of the diastema.",
