        "exp": "Pathergy phenomenon is defined as a state of altered tissue reactivity that occurs in response to minor trauma Although the exact mechanisms underlying pathergy phenomenon are unknown, skin injury caused by needle prick apparently triggers a cutaneous inflammatory response. Types of pathergy tests: Oral pathergy test Site: lower lip. Skin pathergy test Site: A hairless area on the flexor aspect of the forearm sterile needle (20 gauge) prick or an intradermal injection of normal saline, monosodium urate (MSU) crystals or streptococcal antigens to perform the test. The procedure is performed on a hairless pa of the volar forearm. Generally, the needle is inseed veically or diagonally at an angle of 45deg to a depth of 3-5 mm. The needle should reach the dermis for a proper response. Clinical evaluation: Readings are taken after 48 hrs of the needle prick. A 1-2mm papule that is usually felt by palpation and which is surrounded by an erythematous halo is formed on the skin. The papule may remain as a papule or transform into a 1-5mm pustule. The pustule becomes prominent in 24 h, becomes maximum in size in 48 h, and disappears in 45 days. Erythema without induration is interpreted as a negative result. Conditions with positive pathergy phenomenon: Behcet's disease Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG): The pathergy test positivity at a rate of 25% has been repoed in the literature in PG patients. Aggressive surgical debridement or skin grafting is discouraged in these patients because of the risk of a pathergic response.

        "exp": "Reactive ahritis, formerly known as Reiter's syndrome, is a form of inflammatory ahritis that develops in response to an infection in another pa of the body (cross-reactivity). Coming into contact with bacteria and developing an infection can trigger the disease. By the time the patient presents with symptoms, often the \"trigger\" infection has been cured or is in remission in chronic cases, thus making determination of the initial cause difficult. The ahritis often is coupled with other characteristic symptoms; this was previously referred to as Reiter's syndrome, Reiter's disease or Reiter's ahritis. The term \"reactive ahritis\" is preferred and increasingly used as a substitute for this designation because Hans Conrad Julius Reiter was not the first to describe the syndrome, his conclusions regarding its pathogenesis were incorrect, and because he committed war crimes as a Nazi at Buchenwald concentration camp during World War II. The manifestations of reactive ahritis include the following triad of symptoms: an inflammatory ahritis of large joints, inflammation of the eyes in the form of conjunctivitis or uveitis, and urethritis in men or cervicitis in women. Ahritis occurring alone following sexual exposure or enteric infection is also known as reactive ahritis. Patients can also present with mucocutaneous lesions, as well as psoriasis-like skin lesions such as circinate balanitis, and keratoderma blennorrhagicum. Enthesitis can involve the Achilles tendon resulting in heel pain. Not all affected persons have all the manifestations. The clinical pattern of reactive ahritis commonly consists of an inflammation of fewer than five joints which often includes the knee or sacroiliac joint. The ahritis may be \"additive\" (more joints become inflamed in addition to the primarily affected one) or \"migratory\" (new joints become inflamed after the initially inflamed site has already improved). Reactive ahritis is an RF-seronegative, HLA-B27-linked ahritis] often precipitated by genitourinary or gastrointestinal infections. The most common triggers are intestinal infections (with Salmonella, Shigella or Campylobacter) and sexually transmitted infections (with Chlamydia trachomatis), however, it also can happen after group A streptococcal infections.

Classically, it begins with a single red and slightly scaly area known as a \"herald patch\". This is then followed, days to weeks later, by a pink whole body rash. It typically lasts less than three months and goes away without treatment. Sometime a fever may occur before the sta of the rash or itchiness may be present, but often there are few other symptoms The symptoms of this condition include: An upper respiratory tract infection may precede all other symptoms in as many as 69% of patients. A single, 2- to (rarely) 10-cm oval red \"herald\" patch appears, classically on the abdomen. Occasionally, the \"herald\" patch may occur in a 'hidden' position (in the armpit, for example) and not be noticed immediately. The \"herald\" patch may also appear as a cluster of smaller oval spots, and be mistaken for acne. Rarely, it does not become present at all. 7-14 days after the herald patch, many small (5-10 mm) patches of pink or red, flaky, oval-shaped rash appear on the torso. The more numerous oval patches generally spread widely across the chest first, following the rib-line in a characteristic \"christmas-tree\" distribution. Small, circular patches may appear on the back and neck several days later. In 6% of cases an \"inverse\" distribution may occur, with rash mostly on the extremities. In children, presentation can be atypical or inverse, and the course is typically milder. About one in four people with PR have mild to severe symptomatic itching. (Moderate itching due to skin over-dryness is much more common, especially if soap is used to cleanse the affected areas.) The itching is often non-specific, and worsens if scratched. This tends to fade as the rash develops and does not usually last through the entire course of the disease. The rash may be accompanied by low-grade fever, headache, nausea and fatigue Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1290",
