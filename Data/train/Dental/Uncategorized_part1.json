Intraoral examination shows multiple pit and fissure caries and subsurface enamel porosity manifesting as milky white opacity. Tactile probing should not be used in this case because of all of the following EXCEPT?",
        "exp": "Traditionally, dentists have relied upon a visual-tactile radiographic\u00a0 procedure\u00a0 for\u00a0 the detection\u00a0 of\u00a0 dental caries. This procedure involves the visual identification of demineralized\u00a0 areas\u00a0 (typically\u00a0 white\u00a0 spots)\u00a0 or\u00a0 suspicious pits or fissures and the use of the dental explorer to determine the\u00a0 presence of a\u00a0 loss of continuity\u00a0 or breaks in the enamel and to assess the softness or resilience of the enamel. Caries lesions located on interproximal tooth surfaces\u00a0 have\u00a0 generally\u00a0 been\u00a0 detected\u00a0 with\u00a0 the\u00a0 use\u00a0 of\u00a0 bitewing radiographs. These procedures have been used routinely in virtually every dental office in the United States for the past 50 years. Tactile probing with an explorer is no longer used for caries detection in most European countries, and this protocol has now been adopted by many U.S. dental schools. The primary concerns that led to the discontinuation of the probing procedure were as follows:\n1. The\u00a0 insertion\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 explorer\u00a0 into\u00a0 the\u00a0 suspected lesion inevitably disrupts the surface layer covering very early lesions, thereby eliminating the possibility for remineralization of the decalcified area;\u00a0\n2. The probing of lesions and suspected lesions results in the transport of\u00a0 cariogenic\u00a0 bacteria\u00a0 from\u00a0 one area\u00a0 to another;\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0\n3.

The gingival stimulation provided by a positioner is an excellent way to promote a rapid return to normal gingival contours.\n\nAs a general rule, a tooth positioner in a cooperative patient will produce any changes it is capable of within 2-3 weeks. Final (post-treatment) records and retainer impressions can be taken 2 or 3 weeks after the positioner is placed. Beyond that time, if the positioner is continued, it is serving as a retainer rather than a finishing device-and positioners, as a rule, are not good retainers.\nContemporary orthodontics- proffit 4th edition page 614",

These guidelines clearly state that if the patient cannot cope with the procedure, one should attempt other strategies to handle the situation. The guidelines all acknowledge that, in some cases, radiographs are not possible, in which case, one should balance the benefit against the risk even more carefully. Sometimes it is better to postpone the radiographic exposure until the patient is older or better conditioned. The guidelines also clearly state that if there are no clinical signs of pathology, the need for a radiographic assessment is up to the professional\u2019s judgment, and that these decisions have to be made on an individual patient basis. Radiographs are never to be used for economic and screening reasons since they involve a potential health risk for the patient. A 3-year-old with a sound dentition and open proximal contacts does not need a radiographic assessment. In contrast, for a 3-year-old with only 10 teeth visible in the mouth and no history of dental treatment, the dental professional should make a radiographic assessment.

        "exp": "Classical conditioning (1927) occurs readily with young children and can have a considerable impact on a young child's behavior on the first visit to a dental office. By the time a child is brought for the first visit to a dentist, even if that visit is at an early age, it is highly likely that he or she will have had many experiences with pediatricians and medical personnel. When a child experiences pain, the reflex reaction is crying and withdrawal. In Pavlovian terms, the infliction of pain is an unconditioned stimulus, but a number of aspects of the setting in which the pain occurs can come to be associated with this unconditioned stimulus. For instance, it is unusual for a child to encounter people who are dressed entirely in white uniforms or long white coats. If the unconditioned stimulus of painful treatment comes to be associated with the conditioned stimulus of white coats, a child may cry and withdraw immediately at the first sight of a white-coated dentist or dental assistant. In this case, the child has learned to associate the conditioned stimulus of pain and the unconditioned stimulus of a white-coated adult, and the mere sight of the white coat is enough to produce the reflex behavior initially associated with pain\nNote: A) Acquisition \u2013 learning a new experience (fear of dentist/whitecoat/needles)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0B) Generalization \u2013 generalizing all similar stimuli (all those wearing white coat cause pain)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0C) Discrimination \u2013 differentiating individual stimuli ( not everyone who wears white coat causes pain)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0D) Extinction - disappearance of the acquired experience ( loss of fear of dental procedures)\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0E) Spontaneous recovery \u2013 reappearance of extinct response ( fear of dental procedure reappears due to poor management behaviour strategies).",

Whether the\u00a0tooth is \ufb01lled in one or two appointments (or more) should be determined to a large extent by the clinical signs and symptoms present and to a lesser extent by operator convenience.\nAll signs and\u00a0symptoms of active infection should be eliminated before the canal is \ufb01lled with the treatment paste.\u00a0\nAbsence of tenderness to percussion is an especially good sign before the canal is obturated.\nBecause of\u00a0the wide-open access to periapical tissues, it is not always possible to maintain complete dryness in\u00a0the root canal.\u00a0\nIf the canal continues to weep but other signs of infection seem to be controlled after\u00a0two or three appointments, the dentist may elect to proceed with the calcium hydroxide paste\u00a0treatment.",

This is clearly incorrect. Only brain damaged children retain a truly infantile swallow in which the posterior part of the tongue has little or no role .Because coordinated movements of the posterior tongue and elevation of the mandible tend to develop before protrusion of the tongue tip between the incisor teeth disappears, what is called \u201ctongue thrusting\u201d in young children is often a normal transitional stage in swallowing. During the transition from an infantile to a mature swallow, a child can be expected to pass through a stage in which the swallow is characterized by muscular activity to bring the lips together, separation of the posterior teeth, and forward protrusion of the tongue between the teeth.

Various formulas are available depending on the intended clinical application.\u00a0\u00a0\nWater-soluble polymers and polymerizable monomers have been replacing part of the liquid content. Particles of metal, metal-ceramic, and ceramic have been added to some products to enhance mechanical properties. Other new formulations are capable of being chemically cured, light-cured, or both. GICs have been used for the esthetic restoration of anterior teeth, e.g., Class III and\u00a0 V sites, as luting cements, as adhesives for orthodontic appliance and intermediate restorations, as pit and fissure sealants, liners and bases, and as core buildup materials. The GICs are classified below:\nType I: Luting crowns, bridges, and orthodontic brackets\nType IIa: Esthetic restorative cements\nType IIb: Reinforced restorative cements\nType III: Lining cements, base\nGICs elicit a greater pulpal reaction than ZOE cement but less than zinc phosphate cement. Glass ionomer luting agents pose a greater pulpal hazard than glass ionomer restorations when the GIC is mixed with a low P/L ratio because the pH remains acidic longer. With any GIC, a protective liner such as Ca(OH) 2 should be used if the preparation is closer than 0.5 mm to the pulp chamber.\nKEY Concept: The most commonly used, biocompatible and adhesive cement is Glass ionomer cement.\nReference: PHILLIPS\u2019 SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 320, 323, 324",

This type of distortion can be minimized or prevented by proper manipulation of the wax and handling of\u00a0the pattern. Unquestionably some distortion of the wax pattern occurs\u00a0as the investment hardens around it. The setting and hygroscopic expansions of the investment may produce a non-uniform\u00a0expansion of the walls of the pattern. This type of distortion occurs in part from the nonuniform outward movement of the proximal walls. The gingival margins are forced apart by the mold expansion, whereas the solid occlusal bar of wax resists expansion during the early stages of setting. The configuration of the pattern, the type of wax, and the thickness influence the distortion that occurs. For example, distortion increases as the thickness of the pattern decreases. As would be expected, the lower is the setting expansion of the investment, the less lower is distortion.\u00a0\nPhilips\u2019 Dental Material, pg- 223",

He noticed that many of his patients, particularly those who had lived in the area all their lives, had an apparently permanent stain on their teeth, which was known to the local inhabitants as \u2018Colorado Stain'.\u00a0\nMcKay checked the notes he had saved from dental school but found nothing to describe such markings, nor could he find any reference to them in any of the available scientific literature. He called the stain 'mottled enamel' and said that it was characterized by minute white flecks or yellow or brown spots or areas, scattered irregularly or streaked over the surface of a tooth or it may be a condition where the entire tooth surface is of a dead paper-white like the color of a china dish.\nEssentials of preventive and community dentistry\nSoben Peter\n5th edition\n\u00a0page no. 252",

The mandibular arch is totally imbricated inside the maxillary arch. Contact is established between the palatal surfaces of the maxillary teeth and the vestibular surfaces of the mandibular teeth.\nScissors bite: Scissors bite refers to a condition in which a tooth or group of teeth in the mandibular buccal arch are lingual to the lingual cusps of the maxillary teeth.\nOrthodontics: Diagnosis and Management of Malocclusion and Dentofacial Deformities THIRD EDITION: Om P.

        "exp": "Properties of Addition Silicone\n\nPleasant odor and color.\nThis may also cause allergic reaction so direct skin contact should be avoided.\nExcellent reproduction of surface details. Polyvinyl siloxanes are currently considered to reproduce the greatest detail of all the impression materials. The international standard for dental elastomeric impression materials states that a type 3 (light bodied) impression material must reproduce a line 20 \u03bcm in width. With the exception of the very high viscosity putty materials, all polyvinyl siloxanes (light, medium and heavy body) achieve this very low viscosity materials can reproduce lines 1-2 \u03bcm wide.\nSetting time ranges from 5 to 9 minutes. Mixing time is 45 seconds. Working time may be extended by chilling the tubes. Gains of up to 90 seconds have been reported when the materials are chilled to 2oC.\nIt has the best dimensional stability among the elastomers. It has a low curing shrinkage (0.17%) and the lowest permanent deformation (0.05-0.3%)\nEarly materials has the problem of hydrogen gas formation. If hydrogen gas is liberated pouring of stone is delayed by 1-2 hours to prevent formation of air bubbles in the stone cast. Current materials do not have this problem because of the addition of palladium.\nIt has good tear strength (3000 g/cm).\nIt is extremely hydrophobic, so similar care should be taken while making the impression and pouring the wet stone. Some manufactures add a surfactant (detergent) to make it more hydrophilic.\nIt can be electroplated with silver or copper. However, hydrophilic silicones are more difficult to electroplate because of the surfactant added.\nIt has low flexibility and is harder than polysulfides. Extra spacing (3 mm) should be provided in the impression tray. Care should also be taken while removing the stone cast from the impression to avoid any breakage.\nShelf life ranges from 1 to 2 years.",

It is a chemical irritant to the skin and mucous membranes and is associated with a high rate of nausea and vomiting, particularly when administered on an empty stomach. After oral administration, the drug was characterized by a slow onset time (30 to 60 minutes) and had a duration of action of 4 to 8 hours, with an elimination half-life of 8 to 11 hours. Children given chloral hydrate would often enter a period of disinhibition resulting in excitement and irritability before reaching a level of clinically useful sedation. Large doses sensitize the myocardium to the effects of epinephrine, resulting in arrhythmias. The lethal dose of chloral hydrate is stated to be 10 g in adults, yet ingestion of 4 g has been associated with a fatal outcome.\u00a0Chloral hydrate is no longer available commercially in the United States, but is included here because of its history in pediatric dentistry and references in the pediatric dentistry literature.",

Thus, a small contact angle indicates that the adhesive forces at the interface are stronger than the cohesive forces holding the molecules of the adhesive together. If\u00a0 the adhesive beads up,\u00a0 it means that the force of adhesion is weaker than the cohesive force of the adhesive. Because the tendency for the liquid to spread increases as the contact angle decreases, the contact angle is a useful indicator of spreadability or wettability. Complete wetting occurs at a contact angle of 0\u00b0 and no wetting occurs at an angle of 180\u00b0\nThus, the smaller the contact angles between an adhesive and an adherend, the better the ability of the adhesive to flow into and fill in irregularities within the surface of the adherend.

        "exp": "Behavior therapists have found that systematic desensitization is one of the most effective methods for reducing maladaptive anxiety. The technique usually involves teaching the patient how to induces a state of deep muscle relaxation, and describing, while the patient is in the relaxed state, imaginary scenes relevant to his tears. The imaginal scenes are presented to the patient in a graduated fashion, or hierarchy, so that scenes provoking only minimal anxiety are initially described. Gradually, more stressful situations are presented; however anxiety is minimized through use of relaxation. Behavior therapists have found that a highly significant reduction in anxiety responses to similar real-life situations usually results from participation in systematic desensitization sessions. The technique has been found to be effective in managing broad spectrum of phobias, including fears of rejection, physical injury, injections, and authority.\nUse of systematic desensitization technique involving deep muscle relaxation and the presentation of imaginary, anxiety-provoking situations frequently requires 15 to 25 therapy sessions in order to train the patient properly in muscle relation and to reduce anxiety. Therefore, for practical considerations, application of systematic desensitization, as described, for reducing anxiety associated with dental treatment would probably be limited to only the most anxious patients. These patients could initially be treated by a behavior therapist and subsequently receive dental treatment from a dentist familiar with systematic desensitization procedures and the cues associated with relaxation techniques\nWhile use of the classical systematic desensitization technique is not generally indicated for the dentist, variations of the technique have proven useful and may be more applicable to the dental office. Wolpe and D\u2019Zurilla have suggested that real-life contacts with the anxiety- promoting stimuli may be beneficial in reducing anxiety response and that, in fact, the presentation of imaginal scenes may not be necessary. In addition, evidence exists that deep muscle relaxation may not be necessary to desensitization procedures. Thus, the principles of desensitization may still be applied to the dental situation even through deep muscle relaxation and imaginal scene would seem to be impractical.",
