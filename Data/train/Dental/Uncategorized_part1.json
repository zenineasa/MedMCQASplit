The gingival stimulation provided by a positioner is an excellent way to promote a rapid return to normal gingival contours. As a general rule, a tooth positioner in a cooperative patient will produce any changes it is capable of within 2-3 weeks. Final (post-treatment) records and retainer impressions can be taken 2 or 3 weeks after the positioner is placed. Beyond that time, if the positioner is continued, it is serving as a retainer rather than a finishing device-and positioners, as a rule, are not good retainers.

        "exp": "The American Dental Association (ADA), the American Academy for Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD), the European Academy for Pediatric Dentistry (EAPD), and other organizations have published criteria that are meant to guide the dental professional in decision-making regarding appropriate radiographic imaging (Table 2-5). These guidelines clearly state that if the patient cannot cope with the procedure, one should attempt other strategies to handle the situation. The guidelines all acknowledge that, in some cases, radiographs are not possible, in which case, one should balance the benefit against the risk even more carefully. Sometimes it is better to postpone the radiographic exposure until the patient is older or better conditioned. The guidelines also clearly state that if there are no clinical signs of pathology, the need for a radiographic assessment is up to the professional's judgment, and that these decisions have to be made on an individual patient basis. Radiographs are never to be used for economic and screening reasons since they involve a potential health risk for the patient. A 3-year-old with a sound dentition and open proximal contacts does not need a radiographic assessment. In contrast, for a 3-year-old with only 10 teeth visible in the mouth and no history of dental treatment, the dental professional should make a radiographic assessment. If a 4-year-old shows rampant decay, a radiographic assessment is certainly justifiable and indicated.",

        "exp": "Classical conditioning (1927) occurs readily with young children and can have a considerable impact on a young child's behavior on the first visit to a dental office. By the time a child is brought for the first visit to a dentist, even if that visit is at an early age, it is highly likely that he or she will have had many experiences with pediatricians and medical personnel. When a child experiences pain, the reflex reaction is crying and withdrawal. In Pavlovian terms, the infliction of pain is an unconditioned stimulus, but a number of aspects of the setting in which the pain occurs can come to be associated with this unconditioned stimulus. For instance, it is unusual for a child to encounter people who are dressed entirely in white uniforms or long white coats. If the unconditioned stimulus of painful treatment comes to be associated with the conditioned stimulus of white coats, a child may cry and withdraw immediately at the first sight of a white-coated dentist or dental assistant. In this case, the child has learned to associate the conditioned stimulus of pain and the unconditioned stimulus of a white-coated adult, and the mere sight of the white coat is enough to produce the reflex behavior initially associated with pain Note: A) Acquisition - learning a new experience (fear of dentist/whitecoat/needles) B) Generalization - generalizing all similar stimuli (all those wearing white coat cause pain) C) Discrimination - differentiating individual stimuli ( not everyone who wears white coat causes pain) D) Extinction - disappearance of the acquired experience ( loss of fear of dental procedures) E) Spontaneous recovery - reappearance of extinct response ( fear of dental procedure reappears due to poor management behaviour strategies).",

Although it appears to thicken early during spatulation, further vigorous spatulation or stropping loosens the mix. Smaller increments are then added, until the mix is complete. For temporary restorations, a thick putty-like consistency is recommended. Oil of orange is used to clean eugenol cement from instruments. Reference - Manappallil p; 101",

Condylar guide inclination: The angle formed by the inclination of a condylar guide control surface of an articulator and a specified reference plane (GPT8). This is the mandibular guidance generated by the condyles traversing the contours of the glenoid fossa. It is duplicated in the articulator. The extent of duplication depends on the articulator's capability, whether it is semi-adjustable or fully adjustable. Protrusive condylar guidance is obtained using protrusive records, while the lateral condylar guidance is obtained using Hanau's formula or lateral records It is designated as an inclination or angle - condylar guidance angle or inclination - and is expressed in degrees. This is the only factor that is obtained from the patient and is not under the dentist's control. A shallow condylar guidance will cause less posterior tooth separation in protrusion and requires teeth with shorter cusps and flatter fossa to achieve balanced occlusion, than a steep guidance.

Repeatability (reliability, precision, reproducibility) - The test must give consistent results when repeated more than once on the same individual or material under the same condition. Validity (accuracy) - It refers to what extent the test accurately measures which it purports to measure. (it means it expresses the ability of a test to separate or distinguish those who have the disease from those who do not). Accuracy refers to closeness with which measured values agree with \"true\" value. It has two components: i. Sensitivity - Ability of test of identify correctly all those who have disease. ii. Specificity - Ability to test to identify correctly all those who do not have disease. So, if test gives the same reading for a sample on repeated testing means test is precise (i. e., reliable, reproducible, repeatable).",

Placing a calcium hydroxide dressing in the canal is optional at the \ufb01rst appointment. During the second appointment, the debridement procedures are repeated before the canal is \ufb01lled with a thick paste of calcium hydroxide and CMCP or calcium hydroxide in a methylcellulose paste. Whether the tooth is \ufb01lled in one or two appointments (or more) should be determined to a large extent by the clinical signs and symptoms present and to a lesser extent by operator convenience. All signs and symptoms of active infection should be eliminated before the canal is \ufb01lled with the treatment paste. Absence of tenderness to percussion is an especially good sign before the canal is obturated. Because of the wide-open access to periapical tissues, it is not always possible to maintain complete dryness in the root canal. If the canal continues to weep but other signs of infection seem to be controlled after two or three appointments, the dentist may elect to proceed with the calcium hydroxide paste treatment.",

        "question": "The most commonly used, most biocompatible and adhesive cement is:",
        "exp": "The use of polyacrylic acid makes GIC capable of bonding to tooth structure. GIC is considered superior to many types of cements because it is adherent and translucent. Various formulas are available depending on the intended clinical application. Water-soluble polymers and polymerizable monomers have been replacing part of the liquid content. Particles of metal, metal-ceramic, and ceramic have been added to some products to enhance mechanical properties. Other new formulations are capable of being chemically cured, light-cured, or both. GICs have been used for the esthetic restoration of anterior teeth, e. g., Class III and V sites, as luting cements, as adhesives for orthodontic appliance and intermediate restorations, as pit and fissure sealants, liners and bases, and as core buildup materials. The GICs are classified below: Type I: Luting crowns, bridges, and orthodontic brackets Type IIa: Esthetic restorative cements Type IIb: Reinforced restorative cements Type III: Lining cements, base GICs elicit a greater pulpal reaction than ZOE cement but less than zinc phosphate cement. Glass ionomer luting agents pose a greater pulpal hazard than glass ionomer restorations when the GIC is mixed with a low P/L ratio because the pH remains acidic longer. With any GIC, a protective liner such as Ca(OH) 2 should be used if the preparation is closer than 0. 5 mm to the pulp chamber. KEY Concept: The most commonly used, biocompatible and adhesive cement is Glass ionomer cement. Reference: PHILLIPS' SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 320, 323, 324",

The second is an impairment in communication, which can result in the delay or complete lack of spoken language. Children with Asperger syndrome do not have a general delay in language or cognitive development; however, they often have communication difficulties, especially in sustaining conversations. The third area of impairment in ASD is repetitive behaviors. They may include staring, floppy hands, an odd interest in or preoccupation with specific objects.

Kay in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA, in 1901, the year following his graduation from the University of Pennsylvania Dental School. He noticed that many of his patients, particularly those who had lived in the area all their lives, had an apparently permanent stain on their teeth, which was known to the local inhabitants as \u2018Colorado Stain'. Mc. Kay checked the notes he had saved from dental school but found nothing to describe such markings, nor could he find any reference to them in any of the available scientific literature. He called the stain 'mottled enamel' and said that it was characterized by minute white flecks or yellow or brown spots or areas, scattered irregularly or streaked over the surface of a tooth or it may be a condition where the entire tooth surface is of a dead paper-white like the color of a china dish.

However, the expected eventual outcome is ankylosis and resorption of the root, and the tooth will be lost eventually. Treatment \u200bClean the area with water spray, saline, or chlorhexidine. Re-implant the tooth in the socket. Suture gingival lacerations, if present. Verify normal position of the replanted tooth both clinically and radiographically. Apply a flexible splint for up to 2 weeks. Administer systemic antibiotics. If the avulsed tooth has been in contact with soil and if tetanus coverage is uncertain, refer to physician for a tetanus booster. Initiate root canal treatment 7-10 days after replantation and before splint removal. To slow osseous replacement of the tooth, treatment of the root surface with fluoride prior to replantation has been suggested (2% sodium fluoride solution for 20 minutes). Reference: Mc.

These irregularities can be minimized by applying a surface-active wetting agent on the wax. The function of the wetting agent is to reduce the contact angle of a liquid with the wax surface. Wetting agents also remove any oily film that is left on the wax pattern from the separating medium. The contact angles are 98 degrees for the plain wax surface and 61 degrees for the treated wax surface. The lower contact angle indicates that the treated wax surface has an affinity for water, which results in the investment being able to spread more easily over the wax. Because the surface-active agents are quite soluble, the wax pattern with water after the application defeats the purpose of their use.",

In vitro studies have suggested that trichloroethanol acts upon GABA receptors in a manner similar to barbiturates and benzodiazepines. It is a chemical irritant to the skin and mucous membranes and is associated with a high rate of nausea and vomiting, particularly when administered on an empty stomach. After oral administration, the drug was characterized by a slow onset time (30 to 60 minutes) and had a duration of action of 4 to 8 hours, with an elimination half-life of 8 to 11 hours. Children given chloral hydrate would often enter a period of disinhibition resulting in excitement and irritability before reaching a level of clinically useful sedation. Large doses sensitize the myocardium to the effects of epinephrine, resulting in arrhythmias. The lethal dose of chloral hydrate is stated to be 10 g in adults, yet ingestion of 4 g has been associated with a fatal outcome.

Thus, a small contact angle indicates that the adhesive forces at the interface are stronger than the cohesive forces holding the molecules of the adhesive together. If the adhesive beads up, it means that the force of adhesion is weaker than the cohesive force of the adhesive. Because the tendency for the liquid to spread increases as the contact angle decreases, the contact angle is a useful indicator of spreadability or wettability. Complete wetting occurs at a contact angle of 0\u00b0 and no wetting occurs at an angle of 180\u00b0 Thus, the smaller the contact angles between an adhesive and an adherend, the better the ability of the adhesive to flow into and fill in irregularities within the surface of the adherend.

Thus, a static evaluation will give a class III reading, but functional examination at postural rest and at first dental contact shows that the mandible is closing in a normal class I way.

In oral phase, it is believed that the mouth is an erogenous zone. During this phase, the child takes anything and everything to the oral cavity. It is believed that any kind of deprivation of this activity will lead to fixation resulting in oral habits. Oral drive theory by Sears and Wise (1960): Strength of oral drive is, in part, a function of how long a child continues to feed by sucking. The oral drive is strengthened by prolongation of nursing; this is the cause and not the frustration of weaning. Rooting reflex by Benjamin (1962): The rooting reflex is movement of the infant's head and tongue towards an object touching its cheeks. He suggested that, it arises from the rooting and placing reflexes common to all mammalian infants during the first 3 months of life. Pediatric Dentistry, Principles and Practice / M. S. Muthu, N.

Acceleration of the set may be achieved by: Incorporating chemical accelerators in the mix (the most efficient and predictable way of controlling the setting time). Reducing the powder particle size, providing for accelerated reactivity. Increasing the powder: Liquid ratio (of limited effect in reducing the setting time). Increasing the percentage of rosin and fillers. Increasing the temperature and/or humidity. Adding water to the original mix or after mixing is complete and seated into the preparation. Introducing greater energy in the mixing procedure (pressure-movement and time). A delay in setting is rarely needed. This is accomplished by adding vegetable oils or glycerin which keep the mass plasticized for a long period of time. Ref: Marzouk's operative dentistry page no 263",

If it is not discontinued, the treatment should generally be undertaken from 4 to 6 years. The treatment includes the following approaches. Phase 1 (normal and sub-clinically significant sucking): This phase extends from birth to 3 years of age. Children develop thumb sucking at this stage and resolve at the end of this phase. In case of malocclusion signs, prophylactic approaches, like pacifiers or medicaments, can be used. Phase 2 (clinically significant sucking): This phase extends from 3 to 7 years of age. A firm and definite treatment plan of correction that includes psychological counseling and appliance therapy is required. Phase 3 (intractable sucking): Thumb sucking present after 4th year poses problem for the children. Two-fold treatment including both psychotherapy and appliances is essential.",

Since it is the agar, not the alginate, that contacts the prepared teeth, maximal detail is reproduced. Because only the syringe material needs to be heated, equipment cost is lower and less preparation time is required.

So, such cases are difficult to treat and pose poor prognosis.

Mammandras evaluated the records of 32 untreated patients who represented a cross-sectional sample of ages 8 to 18 years and measured such variables as lip length, lip thickness, and soft-tissue chin thickness. Mammandras found that in women, the upper lip reached its maximum thickness by age 14 and remained the same until 16 years of age, with the lip thinning afterward. In men, maximum lip thickness was attained around age 16 but also began to thin thereafter. The horizontal thickness of the lower lip slowed dramatically but was close to its maximum in both men and women by age 15. Similar results were attained in a study by Nanda et al with mild differences but essentially similar trends. Ref: Mamandras AH. Linear changes of the maxillary and mandibular lips.

In a classic report, Cvek described a pulpotomy technique in which only the superficial 2 to 3 mm of hyperplastic inflamed tissue was removed with a water-cooled, high-speed diamond bur to place the wound in a healthy site. Hemostasis was then secured before capping with an appropriate material. Hemostasis was obtained with saline, and a pulp cap of calcium hydroxide was overlaid with a sealing coronal restoration.

        "exp": "Around the age of 8 years, a midline diastema is commonly seen in the upper arch, which is usually misinterpreted by the parents as a malocclusion. Crowns of canines in young jaws impinge on developing lateral incisor roots, thus driving the roots medially and causing the crowns to flare laterally. The roots of the central incisors are also forced together thus causing a maxillary midline diastema. The period from the eruption of lateral incisor to canine is termed as the Ugly Duckling stage. It is an unaesthetic metamorphosis, which eventually leads to an aesthetic result. With eruption of canines, the impingement from the roots shifts incisally thus driving the incisor crowns medially, resulting in closure of the diastema.

The temperature of the mixing water should be controlled carefully within a degree or two of a standard temperature, usually 20\u00b0C, so that a constant and reliable setting time can be obtained.
