        "exp": "Trichotillomania Trichotillomania is a behavioural disorder characterized by compulsive hair pulling. It presents as a pattern of hair loss, often bizarre, with no clear biological or ove traumatic explanation. Hair is plucked most frequently from one fronto-parietal region. This results in a patch of hair loss, often in a bizarre or angular pattern, in which the hairs are twisted and broken at various distances from the clinically normal scalp. Differential points: Trichotillomania is not necessarily associated with erythema/ some cases do have erythema. But presence of erythema dose not rule out the diagnosis Alopecia areata will be more regular in shape and density Alopecia: - Look at the more regular patterned hair loss",
