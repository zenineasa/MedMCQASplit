        "question": "Vitiligo Vulgaris best treatment is",
        "exp": "The best treatment in vitiligo vulgaris is topical coicosteroids. Vitiligo vulgaris is a localized depigmentation. It is an acquired condition resulting from progressive loss of melanocytes characterized by milky white sharply demarcated macules. First line treatment is topical coicosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors Second line-phototherapy: There is no cure for vitiligo but several treatment options are available. The best evidence is for applied steroids and the combination of ultraviolet light in combination with creams.. Lesions located on the hands, feet, and joints are the most difficult to repigment; those on the face are easiest to return to the natural skin color as the skin is thinner in nature. Immune mediators: Topical preparations of immune suppressing medications including glucocoicoids (such as 0. 05% clobetasol or 0. 10% betamethasone) and calcineurin inhibitors (such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus) are considered to be first-line vitiligo treatments. Phototherapy: *Phototherapy is considered a second-line treatment for vitiligo. Exposing the skin to light from UVB lamps is the most common treatment for vitiligo. The treatments can be done at home with an UVB lamp or in a clinic. The exposure time is managed so that the skin does not suffer overexposure. Treatment can take a few weeks if the spots are on the neck and face and if they existed not more than 3 years. If the spots are on the hands and legs and have been there more than 3 years, it can take a few months. Phototherapy sessions are done 2-3 times a week. Spots on a large area of the body may require full body treatment in a clinic or hospital. UVB broadband and narrowband lamps can be used, but narrowband ultraviolet picked around 311 nm is the choice. It has been constitutively repoed that a combination of UVB phototherapy with other topical treatments improves re-pigmentation. *Ultraviolet light (UVA) treatments are normally carried out in a hospital clinic. Psoralen and ultraviolet A light (PUVA) treatment involves taking a drug that increases the skin's sensitivity to ultraviolet light, then exposing the skin to high doses of UVA light. Treatment is required twice a week for 6-12 months or longer. Because of the high doses of UVA and psoralen, PUVA may cause side effects such as sunburn-type reactions or skin freckling. *Narrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB) phototherapy lacks the side-effects caused by psoralens and is as effective as PUVA. As with PUVA, treatment is carried out twice weekly in a clinic or every day at home, and there is no need to use psoralen. Longer treatment is often recommended, and at least 6 months may be required for effects to phototherapy. NBUVB phototherapy appears better than PUVA therapy with the most effective response on the face and neck. With respect to improved repigmentation: topical calcineurin inhibitors plus phototherapy are better than phototherapy alone, hydrocoisone plus laser light is better than laser light alone, gingko biloba is better than placebo, and oral mini-pulse of prednisolone (OMP) plus NB-UVB is better than OMP alone. *Skin camouflage In mild cases, vitiligo patches can be hidden with makeup or other cosmetic camouflage solutions. If the affected person is pale-skinned, the patches can be made less visible by avoiding tanning of unaffected skin. De-pigmenting In cases of extensive vitiligo the option to de-pigment the unaffected skin with topical drugs like monobenzone, mequinol, or hydroquinone may be considered to render the skin an even colour. The removal of all the skin pigment with monobenzone is permanent and vigorous. Sun-safety must be adhered to for life to avoid severe sunburn and melanomas. Depigmentation takes about a year to complete Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1290",

The disorder is a type of pemphigoid. It is classified as a type II hypersensitivity reaction, with the formation of anti-hemidesmosome antibodies Pathophysiology: The bullae are formed by an immune reaction, initiated by the formation of IgG autoantibodies targeting Dystonin, also called Bullous Pemphigoid Antigen 1, and/or type XVII collagen, also called Bullous Pemphigoid Antigen 2, which is a component of hemidesmosomes. A different form of dystonin is associated with neuropathy. Following antibody targeting, a cascade of immunomodulators results in a variable surge of immune cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils coming to the affected area. Unclear events subsequently result in a separation along the dermoepidermal junction and eventually stretch bullae. Diagnosis: Diagnosis consist of at least 2 positive results out of 3 criteria (2-out-of-3 rule): (1) pruritus and/or predominant cutaneous blisters, (2)linear IgG and/or C3c deposits (in an n- serrated pattern) by direct immunofluorescence microscopy (DIF) on a skin biopsy specimen, and (3)positive epidermal side staining by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on human salt-split skin (IIF SSS) on a serum sample. Routine H&E staining or ELISA tests do not add value to the initial diagnosis. Treatment: Treatments include class I topical steroids (clobetasol, halobetasol, etc.), systemic prednisone and powerful steroid-free immunosuppressant medications, such as methotrexate, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. Some of these medications have the potential for severe adverse effects such as kidney and liver damage, increased susceptibility to infections, and bone marrow suppression. Antibiotics such as tetracycline or erythromycin may also control the disease, paicularly in patients who cannot use coicosteroids. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has been found to be effective in treating some otherwise refractory cases of pemphigoid. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1278",

Injury to the skin can trigger psoriatic skin changes at that spot, which is known as the Koebner phenomenon. Goeckerman therapy is a regimen for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis using a combination of crude coal tar and aificial ultraviolet radiation. It is a specialized form of light therapy. *First formulated in 1925 by American dermatologist William H. Goeckerman (1884-1954), Goeckerman therapy continues to be used due to its efficacy and safety profile. Individual institutions have modified the Goeckerman regimen and developed their own protocols. Standard therapy includes use of 2-4% crude coal tar in a petroleum base applied daily to the psoriatic plaques. The minimum period of time for tar application is 2-hours, although it has been recognized that greater periods of time produce better results. The patient is then exposed to broad-band ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation, although narrow-band UVB may also be used. Laboratory studies have shown that the combination of coal tar and UV light reduces epidermal DNA synthesis. 1953, John Ingram, an English dermatologist, added topical anthralin paste to his Goeckerman regimen.

Presents with well defined scaly patches which heal with atrophy, scarring, and pigmentary changes. Factors predisposing to DLE: 1. trauma 2. streas 3. UV exposure 4. infection 5. drugs 6. seaonal exacerbations 7. cold exposure Ref: Harrison 20th edition pg 1234",

These are typically painful and break open, releasing fluid or pus. The areas most commonly affected are the underarms, under the breasts, and groin. Scar tissue remains after healing Self-consciousness or depression may result. *The cause of HS remains unknown, and expes disagree over proposed causes. The condition probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. *Lesions occur in any body areas with hair follicles, although areas such as the axilla, groin, and perianal region are more commonly involved. This theory includes most of the following potential indicators: Postpubescent individuals are more likely to exhibit HS. [ Plugged apocrine (sweat) gland or hair follicle Excessive sweating Androgen dysfunction Genetic disorders that alter cell structure Patients with more advanced cases may find exercise intolerably painful, which may increase the rate of obesity among sufferers. The historical understanding of the disease suggests dysfunctional apocrine glands[or dysfunctional hair follicles, possibly triggered by a blocked gland, create inflammation, pain, and a swollen lesion Treatment Medication: Antibiotics: taken by mouth, these are used for their anti-inflammatory propeies rather than to treat infection. Most effective is a combination of rifampicin and clindamycin given concurrently for 2-3 months. A few popular antibiotics include tetracycline, minocycline, and clindamycin. Topical clindamycin has been shown to have an effect in double-blind placebo controlled studies. Coicosteroid injections. Also known as intralesional steroids: can be paicularly useful for localized disease, if the drug can be prevented from escaping the sinuses. Antiandrogen therapy: hormonal therapy with antiandrogenic medications such as spironolactone, flutamide, cyproterone acetate, ethinylestradiol, finasteride, dutasteride, and metformin have been found to be effective in clinical studies. However, the quality of available evidence is low and does not presently allow for robust evidence-based recommendation Intravenous or subcutaneous infusion of anti-inflammatory (anti-TNF-alpha) drugs such as infliximab, and etanercept. This use of these drugs is not currently Food and Drug Administration approved and is somewhat controversial, so may not be covered by insurance. TNF inhibitor: Studies have suppoed that various TNF inhibitors have a positive effect on hidradenitis suppurativa lesions. Specifically adalimumab at weekly intervals is useful. Topical isotretinoin is usually ineffective in people with HS and is more commonly known as a medication for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Individuals affected by HS who responded to isotretinoin treatment tended to have milder cases of the condition Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1234",

Esthiomene is generally the visible result of lymphogranuloma venereum, lymphatic infection by Chlamydia trachomatis. This sexually transmitted infection produces inflammation of the lymphatic channels in the female genitalia, followed by abscesses, fistulae, ulcerations, and fibrosis of the tissues. The tissues swell, sometimes severely, and the genitalia may grow to a massive size. Esthiomene can also be the result of tuberculosis when the infection takes hold in the genitalia, or of cancer or filariasis, infection with parasitic roundworms. The condition is painful and sometimes disabling. People with the condition can experience mental distress from the pain and physical deformation of their genitalia. Masses can become so large they make walking difficult. Treatment of the condition includes treatment of bacterial chlamydial infections with antibiotics such as doxycycline, or treatment of other infections present.
