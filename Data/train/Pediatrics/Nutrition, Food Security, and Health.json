The skin loses turgor and becomes wrinkled and loose as subcutaneous fat disappears. Loss of fat from the sucking pads of the cheeks often occurs late.

KWASHIORKOR (Edematous malnutrition). It can occur initially as vague manifestations that include lethargy, apathy, and irritability. When kwashiorkor Is advanced, there is lack of growth. lack of stamina, loss of muscle tissue, increased susceptibility to infections, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, flabby subcutaneous tissues, and edema. Psychological changes. The edema usually develops early secondary to hypoalbum in emia. It is often present in internal organs before it is recognized in the face and limbs. Liver enlargement due to fatty liver can occur early or late in the course of disease. Dermatitis is common, with darkening of the skin in irritated areas, but in contrast to pellagra not in areas exposed to sunlight. Depigmentation can occur after desquamation in these areas, or it may be generalized. The hair is sparse and thin, and in dark-haired children, it can become streaky red or gray.
