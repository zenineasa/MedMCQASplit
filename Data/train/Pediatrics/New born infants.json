'Esophageal atresia: The diagnosis of esophageal atresia is e. ntertained in an infant with excessive salivation along with coughing or choking during the first oral feeding. Lung hypoplasia: The history may include poor fetal movement or amniotic fluid leakage and oligohydramnios. The neonate may be asymptomatic or may present with severe respiratory distress or apnea that requires extensive ventilatory support. In older children, dyspnea and cyanosis maybe present upon exertion, or a history of repeated respiratory infections maybe noted. Lung cyst: Found most often in young adults and are rare in infancy. The usual symptoms are the result of compression by the cyst, e. g., dyspnoea, dysphagia, cough and chest pain. Diaphragmatic hernia: Classic triad: Respiratory distress + Dextrocardia + Scaphoid abdomen. QThe MC presentation is respiratory distress due to severe hypoxemia. The infant appears dyspneic, tachypneic, and cyanotic, with severe retractions. The anteroposterior diameter of the chest maybe large and the abdomen may be scaphoidQ.",

Maintain normal body temperature of neonate during resuscitation, target temperature being 36. 5-37. 5degC in axilla.* Approx. 10% neonates need some assistance and upto 1% need active resuscitation.* Current evidence suggests that cord clamping should be delayed for at least 30-60 seconds for most vigorous term and pre-term neonates.* Most successful indicator of response to resuscitation is increase in heart rate. An electronic cardiac monitor is the preferred method for assessing heart rate.* Oxygen concentration method:# Resuscitation is gestational age at or above 35 weeks begins with 21% oxygen (room air)# In those < 35 weeks: Begin with 21 -30% oxygenation.

No role of routine tracheal suctioning.* To prevent hypoxic-ischemic tissue (brain, heart, and kidney) injury associated morbidity and mortality and reestablish adequate spontaneous respiration and cardiac output; neonatal resuscitation preferred.* The steps in neonatal resuscitation follow the TABCs:# T: Provide warmth, dry the baby and remove the wet linen.# A: Position the infant, clear the airway, and establish a patent airway by suctioning and if necessary, insert an endotracheal tube to ensure an open airway.# B: Tactile stimulation to initiate breathing or positive- pressure ventilation using either bag-and-mask or through an endotracheal tube as necessary.# C: Simulate and maintain the circulation of blood with chest compression and medications as indicated.* Flow-chart outlines the steps to follow for immediate neonatal evaluation and resuscitation. CPAP= continuous positive airway pressure; ET = endotracheal; HR= heart rate; IV= intravenous; PPV= positive pressure ventilation* If heart rate less than 60 beats/min with poor perfusion is an indication to begin chest compressions.* If the bradycardia exists, vascular access should be found; at that time resuscitative epinephrine should be administered in a repeatedly manner in every 3-5 min for persistent symptomatic bradycardia.* Atropine can also be given in such type of cases; if vagal tone increases (e. g., in the setting of head injury with raised intracranial pressure) or primary atrioventricular block is suspected.* Medications are rarely required but should be administered when the heart rate is <60 beats/min after 30 sec of combined ventilation and chest compressions or during asystole.* The umbilical vein can generally be readily cannulated and used for immediate administration of medications during neonatal resuscitation (See Extra mile).* If intravenous access is not available and/or for naloxone; the endotracheal tube is used for the administration of epinephrine* The dose of Epinephrine: 0. 1-0. 3mL/kgof a1: 10, 000 solution, given intravenously or intratracheally for asystole or for failure to respond to 30 sec of combined resuscitation.

Mongolian spots, which are blue or slate-gray macular lesions, have variably defined margins; they occur most commonly in the presacral area but may be found over the posterior thighs, legs, back, and shoulders. They may be solitary or numerous and often involve large areas. More than 80% of black, Asian, and East Indian infants have these lesions, whereas the incidence in white infants is <10%. The peculiar hue of these macules is due to the dermal location of melanin- containing melanocytes (mid-dermal melanocytosis) that are presumably arrested in their migration from neural crest to epidermis. Mongolian spots usually fade during the first few years of life as a result of darkening of the overlying skin. Malignant degeneration does not occur. The characteristic appearance and congenital onset distinguish these spots from the bruises of child abuse. Although regarded as benign, recent data suggest that MS may be associated with inborn errors of metabolism and neurocristopathies. Mongolian spots usually resolve by early childhood and hence no treatment is generally needed if they are located in the sacral area.

You may hear this sound when your child breathes in. Cause of Laryngomalacia Laryngomalacia means \"soft larynx. \" It is caused by floppiness of the tissue above the vocal cords (called the supraglottic larynx). When a person breathes in (inspiration), these tissues fall in towards the airway and cause the airway to be paly blocked. This blockage at the area of the voice box creates noisy breathing (called stridor). Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of noisy breathing in infants. More than half of infants have noisy breathing during the first week of life. Most other babies have it within 2 to 4 weeks of bih.

In neonates, jaundice tends to develop because of two factors - the breakdown of fetal hemoglobin as it is replaced with adult hemoglobin and the relatively immature hepatic metabolic pathways which are unable to conjugate and so excrete bilirubin as quickly as an adult. This causes an accumulation of bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia), leading to the symptoms of jaundice. If the neonatal jaundice does not clear up with simple phototherapy, other causes such as biliary atresia, PFIC, bile duct paucity, Alagille syndrome, alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, and other pediatric liver diseases should be considered.

NEONATAL JAUNDICE / HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA* Approximately 60% of-term and 80% of preterm babies develop jaundice during the first week of life, usually multifocal* In majority early neonatal jaundice is due to rise in unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin*** Yellow colour usually results from the accumulation of unconjugated, non polar, lipid soluble bilirubin in the skin* Most common cause of neonatal hyper bilirubinemia is physiological jaundice* Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is always pathological and expert help should be sought early to identy biliary atresia* The neonatal production rate of bilirubin is 6-8 mg 1kg /24 hour (In contrast to 3-4 mg/kg/24hr in adults). Unconjugated hyper bilirubinemia may be caused or increased by any factor1. Increases the load of bilirubin to be metabolized by the liver (Hemolytic anemias, polycythemia, bruising or internal hemorrhage, shortened red blood cell life as a result of immaturity or transfusion of cells, increased enterohepatic circulation, infections)2. Damages or reduces the activity of the transferase enzyme or other related enzymes (Genetic deficiency, hypoxia, infection, thyroid deficiency. 3. Competes for or blocks the transferase enzyme(Drugs- oxytocin, phenolic detergents and other substances requiring glucuronic acid conjugation)4. Leads to an absence or decreased amounts of the enzyme or to reduction of bilirubin uptake by liver cells ('Genetic defects and prematurity)* Early and frequent feeding decreases, whereas breast feeding and dehydration increases serum levels of bilirubin* Delay in passage of meconium which contains lmg bilirubin/ dL may contribute to jaundice by enterohepatic reciruculation after deconjugation by intestinal glucuronidase cell* The toxic effects of elevated serum concentration of unconjugated bilirubin are increased by factors that reduce the retension of bilirubin in the circulation (Hypoproteinemia, displacement of bilirubin from its binding sites on albumin by competitive binding of drugs such as sulfisoxazole and moxalactam, acidosis and inceased free fatty acids concentration secondary to hypoglycemia, starvation or hypothermia)* Neurotoxic effects are adversely influenced by - Asphyxia, prematurity, hyperosmolality and infections* Bilirubin toxicity or kernicterus can cause permanent sequalae characterized by Tetrad of* Choreo athetoid cerebral palsy* High frequency central hearing loss* Vertical gaze palsy* Dental enamel hypoplasia",

The clinical picture mimics neonatal septicemia because of the presence of abdominal distension, apnea, bradycardia, instability of temperature, cyanosis and lethargy. NEC is believed to result from interaction of several factors such as gut immaturity, mucosal injury due to hypoxia-ischemia, milk feeding and infection. Antenatal steroids and breastfeeding protect against NEC. Delaying enteral feeding does not prevent NEC. The illness usually develops after the first week of life. The course may be very fulminant with death occurring in a few hours, moality rate being around 40-50%. Clinical manifestations may be described in three stages: Stage 1. Suspected NEC: Unstable temperature, apnea, bradycardia, lethargy, mild abdominal distension, vomiting. Frank or occult, blood may be present in stools. X-ray shows mild intestinal distension. Stage 2. Clinical signs as similar to stage 1. Bowel sounds are diminished with or without abdominal tenderness. Pneumatosis intestinalis (gas in intestinal wall) and dilatation of intestines are seen on abdominal X-ray. Stage 3. In addition to the above, the infant is severely sick with hemodynamic instability. There are frank signs of peritonitis with abdominal wall redness. Pneumoperitoneum may occur due to intestinal perforation. Management Oral feeding should be withheld. A nasogastric tube is inseed to relieve distension and to aspirate stomach contents. Fluids and electrolytes in adequate quantities should be administered. Parenteral nutrition may be administered. Shock is managed by replacement of fluids and the use of vasopressor agents. Sequelae Intestinal strictures may develop in survivors. These manifest with bloody stools, vomiting and abdominal distention. Shoened bowel leads to malabsorption. Ref: Paediatrics; O. P.

Emergency chest x-ray is shown (A) along with an x-ray 2 hours later (B) Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this infant's condition?",
        "exp": "Diaphragmatic hernia occurs with the movement of abdominal contents across a congenital or traumatic defect in the diaphragm. In the newborn, this condition results in profound respiratory distress with significant mortality. Prenatal diagnosis is common and, when found, necessitates that the birth take place at a tertiary-level center. In the neonate, respiratory failure in the first hours of life, a scaphoid abdomen, and presence of bowel sounds in the chest are common findings. Intensive respiratory support, including high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), has increased survival. Mortality can be as high as 50% despite aggressive treatment. While surgery may correct the diaphragmatic defect, the lung on the affected side remains hypoplastic and continues to contribute to morbidity. Several fetal surgery centers are investigating surgical techniques to repair the hernia in utero to allow the affected lung adequate time to develop prior to delivery. Pneumonia and pneumothorax may cause respiratory distress with decreased breath sounds, but the radiograph in diaphragmatic hernia shows the nasogastric tube curving into the left thorax, clearly an abnormal placement. A congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation will frequently look like a diaphragmatic hernia on radiographs, but the nasogastric tube would be in the correct location. Choanal atresia is an upper airway abnormality and does not cause these radiographic changes; it would have been difficult to place the nasogastric tube in the first place with this condition, in which there is a bony or membranous septum between the nose and pharynx.",

        "exp": "Congenital heart disease, neural tube defects, small left colon, and metabolic derangements are all more common in infants of diabetic mothers. Hypoglycemia in these infants is usually seen in the first 24 hours of life. In utero exposure to the mother's hyperglycemia leads to fetal islet cell hypertrophy and beta cell hyperplasia, resulting in increased insulin production. After the umbilical cord is severed, that glucose supply is abruptly terminated and the elevated insulin levels cause hypoglycemia. Between 48 and 96 hours of life, these infants have usually achieved glycemic control. However, many now develop hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. Hypocalcemia is thought to result from delayed parathormone (PTH) synthesis and/or responsiveness in the infant of a diabetic mother. Symptoms of hypocalcemia may include irritability, sweating, tremors, twitches, seizures, and arrhythmias. In the vignette, the child was showing symptoms of hypocalcemia in the appropriate time frame after delivery. Treatment of symptomatic infants is intravenous calcium gluconate.",

It is caused by mutation of UGT1. A1 gene.* UDP glucuronyl transferase is involved in conjugating bilirubin to form bilirubin diglucuronide. Hence it presents as unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.* Total bilirubin is mildly increased. But the ratio of unconjugated to conjugated bilirubin is high.* It presents as a milder form of jaundice. It is not life threatening* Starvation and stress are found to cause aggravation of the milder jaundice* If jaundice is disturbing, treatment can be tried with enzyme inducers like phenobarbitone. Phenobarbitone induces UDP glucuronyl transferase and helps in the reduction of bilirubin levels.* As some drugs also get metabolised by UDP glucuronyl transferase, detection of this condition is of clinical significance. For example, an antineoplastic drug, irinotecan is metabolised by UDP glucuronyl transferase. Hence in Gilbert's syndrome, Irinotecan has to be avoided. As UDP glucuronyl transferase defect increases the half-life of Irinotecan, it results in life threatening neutropenia.",

Meconium is greeny-black in colour, and has a sticky, tar-like texture. It is made up of mucus, amniotic fluid, and everything baby has ingested while she was in mothers womb (uterus). Meconium may be difficult to wipe off baby's tiny bottom, but its appearance is a good sign that her bowels are working normally. In the early weeks, baby may poo during or after every feed. On average, she will do four poos a day in the first week. This will slowly settle down and her bowels will work out their own routine. One then find that she poos at a similar time each day. A newborn can have as many as eight to ten bowel movements a day, but as long as she is having at least one, she's probably all right. One day without a bowel movement is usually no cause for concern. As long as baby is feeding well and wetting her diaper five or six times a day, then she's most likely getting enough to eat. If she starts to become uncomfortable or has a persistently swollen abdomen, then she may need some help with pooping, and one should speak to pediatrician about how to facilitate this. In the early days, a newborn's bowel movements are thick and dark green in color. This is due to a substance called meconium that has been building up in her intestines during pregnancy. As the baby starts to feed and have bowel movements, she will finish expelling the meconium and her stools will start to turn yellowish. It is not uncommon for an infant's bowel movements to vary in color from day to day.

Williams Obstetrics 22nd/Ch. 29)INTRAVENTRICULAR HEMORRHAGEThere are four major categories of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage: subdural hemorrhage is usually the result of trauma. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebellar hemorrhage usually result from trauma in term infants but in preterm infants are commonly due to hypoxia. Periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage results from either trauma or asphyxia in half of term infants but has no discernible cause in 25 percent of cases. In preterm neonates, the pathogenesis of periventricular hemorrhage is multifactorial and includes hypoxic-ischemic events, anatomical factors, coagulopathy, and many others. The severity of intraventricular hemorrhage can be assessed by ultrasound and computed tomography. Papile and colleagues (1978) devised the most widely used grading scheme to quantify the extent of the lesion and estimate prognosis.# Grade I--hemorrhage limited to the germinal matrix.# Grade II--intraventricular hemorrhage.# Grade III--hemorrhage with ventricular dilatation.# Grade IV--parenchymal extension of hemorrhage. Prevention and Treatment# Administration of corticosteroids at least 24 hours before delivery appears to prevent or reduce the incidence and severity of intraventricular hemorrhage.# The type of corticosteroid administered may be important. Although both betamethasone and dexamethasone cross the placenta in their active form, betamethasone has a longer half-life. This is because it has a larger volume of distribution and is cleared more slowly than dexamethasone# The efficacy of phenobarbital, vitamin K, vitamin E, or indomethacin in diminishing the frequency and severity of intracranial hemorrhage, when administered either to the neonate or to the mother during labor, remains controversial.# Magnesium sulfate may prevent the sequelae of periventricular hemorrhage.# It is generally agreed that avoiding significant hypoxia both before and after preterm delivery is of paramount importance. There is presently no convincing evidence, however, that routine cesarean delivery for the preterm fetus presenting cephalic will decrease the incidence of periventricular hemorrhage.",

A subgaleal hemorrhage will feel like a cephalohematoma that crosses the midline. Careful monitoring is essential. Subdural hematomas are commonly seen as part of abusive head trauma, formerly known as shaken baby syndrome. This lesion occurs when the bridging cortical veins that drain the cerebral cortex have been ruptured, leading to a collection of blood between the dura and the cerebral mantle. Repeated trauma can lead to additional collections of blood. In many children, additional findings of abuse such as broken bones, bruises, and retinal hemorrhages are found. Caput succedaneum is soft-tissue swelling of the scalp involving the presenting delivery portion of the head. This lesion is sometimes ecchymotic and can extend across the suture lines. The edema may be pitting, and resolves in the first few days of life. Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), also known as germinal matrix hemorrhage, is commonly seen in very small, preterm infants. The incidence of IVH increases with smaller-size infants and in those with perinatal complications. It occurs in the gelatinous subependymal germinal matrix of the brain and can lead to progressive posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus in these children can present with enlarging head circumference, apnea and bradycardia, lethargy, bulging fontanelle, widely split sutures, or no signs at all. Therapy can include ventricular- peritoneal shunting. Cephalohematomas do not cross the suture line, since they are subperiosteal hemorrhages. No discoloration of the scalp is seen, and the swelling usually progresses over the first few hours of life. Occasionally, skull fractures are present as well. Most cephalohematomas resolve within the first few weeks or months of life without residual findings.",

However, the vignette describes a cold infant. A room temperature of 24degC (approximately 75degF) provides a cold environment for newborn infants. Aside from the fact that these infants emerge from a warm, 37. 6degC (99. 5degF) intrauterine environment, at birth, infants (and especially preterm infants) are wet, have a relatively large surface area for their weight, and have little subcutaneous fat. Within minutes of delivery, the infants are likely to become pale or blue and their body temperatures will drop. In order to bring body temperature back to normal, they must increase their metabolic rate; ventilation, in turn, must increase proportionally to ensure an adequate oxygen supply. Because a preterm infant is likely to have respiratory problems and be unable to oxygenate adequately, lactate can accumulate and lead to a metabolic acidosis. Infants rarely shiver in response to a need to increase heat production.

An underlying skull fracture, usually linear and not depressed, may be associated with 10-25% of cases. A sensation of central depression suggesting but not indicative of an underlying fracture or bony defect is usually encountered on palpation of the organized rim of a cephalohematoma. Cephalohematomas require no treatment, although phototherapy may be necessary to treat hyperbilirubinemia. Infection of the hematoma is a very rare complication.

Diaphragmatic hernia occurs with the movement of abdominal contents across a congenital or traumatic defect in the diaphragm. In the newborn, this condition results in profound respiratory distress with significant mortality. Prenatal diagnosis is common and, when found, necessitates that the birth take place at a tertiary-level center. In the neonate, respiratory failure in the first hours of life, a scaphoid abdomen, and presence of bowel sounds in the chest are common findings. Intensive respiratory support, including high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), has increased survival. Mortality can be as high as 50% despite aggressive treatment. While surgery may correct the diaphragmatic defect, the lung on the affected side remains hypoplastic and continues to contribute to morbidity. Several fetal surgery centers are investigating surgical techniques to repair the hernia in utero to allow the affected lung adequate time to develop prior to delivery. Pneumonia and pneumothorax may cause respiratory distress with decreased breath sounds, but the radiograph in diaphragmatic hernia shows the nasogastric tube curving into the left thorax, clearly an abnormal placement. A congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation will frequently look like a diaphragmatic hernia on radiographs, but the nasogastric tube would be in the correct location. Choanal atresia is an upper airway abnormality and does not cause these radiographic changes; it would have been difficult to place the nasogastric tube in the first place with this condition, in which there is a bony or membranous septum between the nose and pharynx.",

        "exp": "Ans. a. Start total enteral feeding and IV feeding not required (Ref: AIIMS NICU Protocol; Ghai 8/e p132-133)A 32-week, 1400 g neonate is born to a primigravida. The baby did not require resuscitation and showed stable vitals. The baby teas transferred to the NICU. For this patient, start total enteral feeding and IV feeding is not required. Enteral Feeding in Sick Premature or LBW Infants. The optimal time to introduce enteral feeding to a sick premature or LBW infant is controversial. Trophic feeding is the practice of feeding very small amounts of enteral nourishment to VLBW preterm infants to stimulate development of the immature gastrointestinal tract. The benefits of trophic feeding include enhanced gut motility, improved growth, decreased need for parenteral nutrition, fewer episodes of sepsis, and shortened hospital stay. Once the infant is stable, small-volume feedings are given in addition to intravenous fluids/nutrition. Feeding is gradually advanced, and parenteral nutrition decreased. This approach may reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis. The main principle in feeding premature infants is to proceed cautiously and gradually. Careful early feeding of breast milk of formula tends to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, dehydration, and hyperbilirubinemia without the additional risk of aspiration, provided that there is no indication for withholding oral feedings, such as the presence of respiratory distress or other disorders. If an infant is well, is making sucking movements, and is in no distress, oral feeding may be attempted, although most infants weighing < 1, 500 g require tube feeding because they are unable to coordinate breathing, sucking, and swallowing. Intestinal tract readiness for feeding may be determined by active bowel sounds, passage of meconium, absence of abdominal distention, bilious gastric aspirates, and emesis. For infants < 1, 000 g, the initial trophic feedings can be given at 10-20 mL/kg/24 hr as a continuous nasogastric tube drip (or given by intermittent gavage every 2-3 hr) for 5-10 days. If the initial feedings are tolerated, the volume is increased by 20-30 mL/kg/24 hr. Once a volume of 150 mL/kg/24 hr has been achieved, the caloric content may be increased to 24 or 27 kcal/oz.",

Early nasal CPAP has shown to lower mortality and risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

The relatives of persons with diseases of multifactorial origin have an increased risk of having similar abnormalities. The recurrence risk for most single primary defects of multifactorial inheritance (eg, neural tube defects) is increased with each child affected.

KMC was first suggested in 1978 by Dr Edgar Rey in Bogota, Colombia. The term kangaroo care is derived from practical similarities to marsupial caregiving, i. e. the infant is kept warm in the maternal pouch and close to the breasts for unlimited feeding. Components. Kangaroo position. The kangaroo position consists of skin-to-skin contact between the mother and the infant in a veical position, between the mother&; s breasts and under her clothes. The provider must keep herself in a semi-reclining position to avoid the gastric reflux in the infant. The kangaroo position is maintained until the infant no longer tolerates it, as indicated by sweating in the baby or baby refusing to stay in KMC position. Kangaroo nutrition: Kangaroo nutrition is exclusive breastfeeding. Kangaroo discharge and followup: Early home discharge in the kangaroo position from the neonatal unit is one of the original components of the KMC intervention. Physiological Benefits. KMC results in keeping neonates warm and cozy. Babies get protected against cold stress and hypothermia. Physiological parameters such as hea and respiratory rates, oxygenation, sleep patterns get stabilized. Clinical Benefits. KMC significantly increases milk production in mothers and exclusive breastfeeding rates. KMC improves weight gain in the infants and improves thermal protection. It reduces incidence of respiratory tract and nosocomial infections, improves emotional bonding between the infant and mothers and results in earlier discharge from the hospital.

It is based on the principle that fetal Hb is more resistant to alkali denaturation. Thus, when eater and the blood are mixed with sodium hydroxide, it remains pink for longer if foetal in origin. If it is maternal blood, it turns yellow brown in 2 min, as adult Hb is denatured easily. Kleihaur Betke test is performed on maternal blood to assess the amount of fetomaternal bleed. The osmotic fragility test (OFT) is used to measure erythrocyte resistance to hemolysis while being exposed to varying levels of dilution of a saline solution. Conditions associated with increased osmotic fragility include Hereditary spherocytosis, Autoimmune spherocytosis, Poisoning, Severe burns. Conditions associated with decreased fragility: Thalassemias, Iron deficiency anemia, Sickle cell anemia. Reference: page 138 and 311 Textbook of Obstetrics Sheila Balakrishnan 2nd edition",

Weight: It is recommended to weigh children using a scale with the following features: Solidly built and durable. Electronic (digital reading). Measures up to 150 kg. Measures to a precision of 0. 1 kg (100 g). Allows tared weighing\"Tared weighing\" means that the scale can be re-set to zero (\"tared\") with the person just weighed still on it. Thus, a mother can stand on the scale, be weighed, and the scale tared. While remaining on the scale, if she is given her child to hold, the child's weight alone appears on the scale. Tared weighing has two clear advantages: There is no need to subtract weights to determine the child's weight alone (reducing the risk of error). The child is likely to remain calm when held in the mother's arms for weighing, Bathroom scales are not recommended as they tend to be unreliable. Hanging scales are also not reliable when weighing agitated babies, Precision describes the smallest exact unit that the scale can measure. Points to Remember: Birth weight of Indian children 2. 8 Kg. Term neonate regains lost birth weight by 7 to 10 days, preterm by 10 to 14 days. Birth weight double by 6 months, triples by 1 year, quadruples by 2 years and increases 5 times by 3 years. Age in months. Rate of weight gain (gm/day)10 days to 3 months25-304 to 6 months207 to 9 months1510 to 12 months12. Formula for calculating expected weight: Infants of age 3 to 12 months weight (Kg)=(Age in months +9)/2. For 1 to 6 years weight (Kg)=(Age in years x2) +8. For 7 to 12 years weight (Kg)=/2 or Age in years x3. Length: If a child is less than 2 years old, measure recumbent length. If the child is aged 2 years or older and able to stand, measure standing height. In general, standing height is about 0. 7 cm less than recumbent length. If a child less than 2 years old will not lie down for measurement of length, measure standing height and add 0. 7 cm to convert it to length. If a child aged 2 years or older cannot stand, measure recumbent length and subtract 0. 7 cm to convert it to height. Equipment needed to measure length is a length board (sometimes called an infantometer) which should be placed on a flat, stable surface such as a table. To measure height, use a height board (sometimes called a stadiometer) mounted at a right angle between a level floor and against a straight, vertical surface such as a wall or pillar. Child should directly look forwards (in stadiometer) or child should be looking straight up (in infantometer) so that the head is positioned in line with FRANKFURT PLANE (the line joining the floor of external auditory meatus to the lower margin of orbit). Expected height between 2 and 12 years in cm (Weech formula)=(Age in years. Mid-Parental Target Height. In girl (cm)=(mother's height in cm+father's height in cm-13)/2.
