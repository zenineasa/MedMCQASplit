Mongolian spots, which are blue or slate-gray macular lesions, have variably defined margins; they occur most commonly in the presacral area but may be found over the posterior thighs, legs, back, and shoulders. They may be solitary or numerous and often involve large areas. More than 80% of black, Asian, and East Indian infants have these lesions, whereas the incidence in white infants is <10%. The peculiar hue of these macules is due to the dermal location of melanin- containing melanocytes (mid-dermal melanocytosis) that are presumably arrested in their migration from neural crest to epidermis. Mongolian spots usually fade during the first few years of life as a result of darkening of the overlying skin. Malignant degeneration does not occur. The characteristic appearance and congenital onset distinguish these spots from the bruises of child abuse. Although regarded as benign, recent data suggest that MS may be associated with inborn errors of metabolism and neurocristopathies. Mongolian spots usually resolve by early childhood and hence no treatment is generally needed if they are located in the sacral area. However, sometimes it may be required for extrasacral lesions for cosmesis.",

It results from a weakness of pas of the voice box (larynx) that is present at bih. This condition can cause a high-pitched sound called stridor (STRI der). You may hear this sound when your child breathes in. Cause of Laryngomalacia Laryngomalacia means \"soft larynx. \" It is caused by floppiness of the tissue above the vocal cords (called the supraglottic larynx). When a person breathes in (inspiration), these tissues fall in towards the airway and cause the airway to be paly blocked. This blockage at the area of the voice box creates noisy breathing (called stridor). Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of noisy breathing in infants. More than half of infants have noisy breathing during the first week of life. Most other babies have it within 2 to 4 weeks of bih. It is rare, but laryngomalacia can happen in older children or adults, usually those with other medical problems. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",

Emergency chest x-ray is shown (A) along with an x-ray 2 hours later (B) Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this infant's condition?",
        "exp": "Diaphragmatic hernia occurs with the movement of abdominal contents across a congenital or traumatic defect in the diaphragm. In the newborn, this condition results in profound respiratory distress with significant mortality. Prenatal diagnosis is common and, when found, necessitates that the birth take place at a tertiary-level center. In the neonate, respiratory failure in the first hours of life, a scaphoid abdomen, and presence of bowel sounds in the chest are common findings. Intensive respiratory support, including high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), has increased survival. Mortality can be as high as 50% despite aggressive treatment. While surgery may correct the diaphragmatic defect, the lung on the affected side remains hypoplastic and continues to contribute to morbidity. Several fetal surgery centers are investigating surgical techniques to repair the hernia in utero to allow the affected lung adequate time to develop prior to delivery. Pneumonia and pneumothorax may cause respiratory distress with decreased breath sounds, but the radiograph in diaphragmatic hernia shows the nasogastric tube curving into the left thorax, clearly an abnormal placement. A congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation will frequently look like a diaphragmatic hernia on radiographs, but the nasogastric tube would be in the correct location. Choanal atresia is an upper airway abnormality and does not cause these radiographic changes; it would have been difficult to place the nasogastric tube in the first place with this condition, in which there is a bony or membranous septum between the nose and pharynx.",

One day without a bowel movement is usually no cause for concern. As long as baby is feeding well and wetting her diaper five or six times a day, then she's most likely getting enough to eat. If she starts to become uncomfortable or has a persistently swollen abdomen, then she may need some help with pooping, and one should speak to pediatrician about how to facilitate this. In the early days, a newborn's bowel movements are thick and dark green in color. This is due to a substance called meconium that has been building up in her intestines during pregnancy. As the baby starts to feed and have bowel movements, she will finish expelling the meconium and her stools will start to turn yellowish. It is not uncommon for an infant's bowel movements to vary in color from day to day. The color of the stools can depend on a variety of things, including what a breastfeeding mom is eating, how hydrated the baby is, and the type and frequency of formula the infant is being fed, if applicable* Most sensitive indicator of intravascular volume depletion in infants- Heart rate *** Probiotics have been shown to have beneficial effects in prevention of Necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants* Rota virus is the single most common cause (MCC) of diarrhea amonget children in both developed and developing world* Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is the MCC of bacterial diarrhea amongs children in developing world* ETEC is the MC bacterial cause for Traveler's diarrhea **",

Williams Obstetrics 22nd/Ch. 29)INTRAVENTRICULAR HEMORRHAGEThere are four major categories of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage: subdural hemorrhage is usually the result of trauma. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebellar hemorrhage usually result from trauma in term infants but in preterm infants are commonly due to hypoxia. Periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage results from either trauma or asphyxia in half of term infants but has no discernible cause in 25 percent of cases. In preterm neonates, the pathogenesis of periventricular hemorrhage is multifactorial and includes hypoxic-ischemic events, anatomical factors, coagulopathy, and many others. The severity of intraventricular hemorrhage can be assessed by ultrasound and computed tomography. Papile and colleagues (1978) devised the most widely used grading scheme to quantify the extent of the lesion and estimate prognosis.# Grade I--hemorrhage limited to the germinal matrix.# Grade II--intraventricular hemorrhage.# Grade III--hemorrhage with ventricular dilatation.# Grade IV--parenchymal extension of hemorrhage. Prevention and Treatment# Administration of corticosteroids at least 24 hours before delivery appears to prevent or reduce the incidence and severity of intraventricular hemorrhage.# The type of corticosteroid administered may be important. Although both betamethasone and dexamethasone cross the placenta in their active form, betamethasone has a longer half-life. This is because it has a larger volume of distribution and is cleared more slowly than dexamethasone# The efficacy of phenobarbital, vitamin K, vitamin E, or indomethacin in diminishing the frequency and severity of intracranial hemorrhage, when administered either to the neonate or to the mother during labor, remains controversial.# Magnesium sulfate may prevent the sequelae of periventricular hemorrhage.# It is generally agreed that avoiding significant hypoxia both before and after preterm delivery is of paramount importance. There is presently no convincing evidence, however, that routine cesarean delivery for the preterm fetus presenting cephalic will decrease the incidence of periventricular hemorrhage.",

Indications of chest compressions are absence of signs of circulation after delivering rescue breaths (no spontaneous breathing, coughing, movment or pulse). Child is pale or cyanosed. Heart rate / pulse rate < 60 beats per minute with signs of poor perfusion after rescue breaths. Chest compressions provide circulation as a result of increase in intrathoracic pressure and / or directed compression of the heart and should be provided with ventilation in infants and children at a rate at least 100 compressions per minute in infants and 80 per minute in children. Bag and Mask ventilation - for full term neonates, infants and children <8 years of age, ventilation bags of minimum volume 450-500 ml should be used to deliver adequate amount of tidal volume. Neonatal size bags (250ml) may be useful for preterm neonates. Sellick Maneuver (Compression of the cricoid cartilage backward, compressing the esophagus against the vertebral column) should be used to prevent aspiration of gastric contents* If ventilation and chest compression do not restore the circulation and spontaneous respiration, medications may be needed. If there is ECG evidence of potentially perfusing rhythm. But no pulse is palpated, one should consider the causes of pulseless electrical activity (electrical mechanical dissociation) these include hypothermia, hypoxia, hypovolemia, hyperkalemia, tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, toxins and pulmonary thromboembolism, Acidosis, Hypoglycemia, Trauma. If there is bradycardia, asystole, venticualar tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation, the patient requires drug therapy and when indicated defibrillation (400-Nelson 18th). Tracheal Intubation for ventilation - 4 major1. Suspected diaphragmatic hernia2. Tracheal suctioning for meconium aspiration3. Bag and mask is ineffective4. Prolong IPPV is required. Administration of epinephrine is not recommended unless the heart rate remains <60 bpm after a minimum of 30 seconds of adequate ventilation and chest compression. Heimlich manoeuvre - used for management of airway obstruction due to foreign body* Manual thrust with the patients standing, rescuer behind the patiet and compressing the abdomen 6 to 10 times. Assisted ventilation (112-Suraj Gupta). Indication - Assisted ventilation should be initiated after stimulation if the infant remains apneic, is gasping or the heart rate remains <100 bpm**The assisted ventilation rate should be 40 to 60 inflations per minute - Lower rates allow longer inflation times and better coordinaton with chest compressions higher rate permit higher minute ventilation.",

A subgaleal hemorrhage will feel like a cephalohematoma that crosses the midline. Careful monitoring is essential. Subdural hematomas are commonly seen as part of abusive head trauma, formerly known as shaken baby syndrome. This lesion occurs when the bridging cortical veins that drain the cerebral cortex have been ruptured, leading to a collection of blood between the dura and the cerebral mantle. Repeated trauma can lead to additional collections of blood. In many children, additional findings of abuse such as broken bones, bruises, and retinal hemorrhages are found. Caput succedaneum is soft-tissue swelling of the scalp involving the presenting delivery portion of the head. This lesion is sometimes ecchymotic and can extend across the suture lines. The edema may be pitting, and resolves in the first few days of life. Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), also known as germinal matrix hemorrhage, is commonly seen in very small, preterm infants. The incidence of IVH increases with smaller-size infants and in those with perinatal complications. It occurs in the gelatinous subependymal germinal matrix of the brain and can lead to progressive posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus in these children can present with enlarging head circumference, apnea and bradycardia, lethargy, bulging fontanelle, widely split sutures, or no signs at all. Therapy can include ventricular- peritoneal shunting. Cephalohematomas do not cross the suture line, since they are subperiosteal hemorrhages. No discoloration of the scalp is seen, and the swelling usually progresses over the first few hours of life. Occasionally, skull fractures are present as well.

The majority of EIT systems apply small alternating currents at a single frequency, however, some EIT systems use multiple frequencies to better differentiate between normal and suspected abnormal tissue within the same organ (multifrequency-EIT or electrical impedance spectroscopy).

There are two possibilities in this neonate i. e. hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia.* Hypoglycemia in first 18-36 hrs is usually due to transient neonatal hypoglycemia and after 36 hrs metabolic and other causes are likely.* Hypoglycemia develops in about 25-50% of infants of diabetic mothers and 15-25% of infants of mothers with gestational diabetes, but only a small percentage of these infants become symptomatic. The probability of hypoglycemia developing in the infant increases, and glucose levels are likely to be lower at higher cord or maternal fasting blood glucose levels.* In those infants with HIE who have seizures, onset of seizures is generally within the first 24 hours after birth. However, the timing of onset is not a reliable indicator of the timing of the neurologic injury.* Seizures due to intracranial hemorrhage may also be associated with hypoxic-ischemic or traumatic injury since these events are frequently associated with each other.* Onset of seizures due to subarachnoid hemorrhage or subdural hemorrhage is usually the second or third day of life, while those due to germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage present after the third day.",

Intensive respiratory support, including high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), has increased survival. Mortality can be as high as 50% despite aggressive treatment. While surgery may correct the diaphragmatic defect, the lung on the affected side remains hypoplastic and continues to contribute to morbidity. Several fetal surgery centers are investigating surgical techniques to repair the hernia in utero to allow the affected lung adequate time to develop prior to delivery. Pneumonia and pneumothorax may cause respiratory distress with decreased breath sounds, but the radiograph in diaphragmatic hernia shows the nasogastric tube curving into the left thorax, clearly an abnormal placement. A congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation will frequently look like a diaphragmatic hernia on radiographs, but the nasogastric tube would be in the correct location. Choanal atresia is an upper airway abnormality and does not cause these radiographic changes; it would have been difficult to place the nasogastric tube in the first place with this condition, in which there is a bony or membranous septum between the nose and pharynx.",

        "exp": "Ans. a. Start total enteral feeding and IV feeding not required (Ref: AIIMS NICU Protocol; Ghai 8/e p132-133)A 32-week, 1400 g neonate is born to a primigravida. The baby did not require resuscitation and showed stable vitals. The baby teas transferred to the NICU. For this patient, start total enteral feeding and IV feeding is not required. Enteral Feeding in Sick Premature or LBW Infants. The optimal time to introduce enteral feeding to a sick premature or LBW infant is controversial. Trophic feeding is the practice of feeding very small amounts of enteral nourishment to VLBW preterm infants to stimulate development of the immature gastrointestinal tract. The benefits of trophic feeding include enhanced gut motility, improved growth, decreased need for parenteral nutrition, fewer episodes of sepsis, and shortened hospital stay. Once the infant is stable, small-volume feedings are given in addition to intravenous fluids/nutrition. Feeding is gradually advanced, and parenteral nutrition decreased. This approach may reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis. The main principle in feeding premature infants is to proceed cautiously and gradually. Careful early feeding of breast milk of formula tends to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, dehydration, and hyperbilirubinemia without the additional risk of aspiration, provided that there is no indication for withholding oral feedings, such as the presence of respiratory distress or other disorders. If an infant is well, is making sucking movements, and is in no distress, oral feeding may be attempted, although most infants weighing < 1, 500 g require tube feeding because they are unable to coordinate breathing, sucking, and swallowing. Intestinal tract readiness for feeding may be determined by active bowel sounds, passage of meconium, absence of abdominal distention, bilious gastric aspirates, and emesis. For infants < 1, 000 g, the initial trophic feedings can be given at 10-20 mL/kg/24 hr as a continuous nasogastric tube drip (or given by intermittent gavage every 2-3 hr) for 5-10 days. If the initial feedings are tolerated, the volume is increased by 20-30 mL/kg/24 hr. Once a volume of 150 mL/kg/24 hr has been achieved, the caloric content may be increased to 24 or 27 kcal/oz.",

KMC was first suggested in 1978 by Dr Edgar Rey in Bogota, Colombia. The term kangaroo care is derived from practical similarities to marsupial caregiving, i. e. the infant is kept warm in the maternal pouch and close to the breasts for unlimited feeding. Components. Kangaroo position. The kangaroo position consists of skin-to-skin contact between the mother and the infant in a veical position, between the mother&; s breasts and under her clothes. The provider must keep herself in a semi-reclining position to avoid the gastric reflux in the infant. The kangaroo position is maintained until the infant no longer tolerates it, as indicated by sweating in the baby or baby refusing to stay in KMC position. Kangaroo nutrition: Kangaroo nutrition is exclusive breastfeeding. Kangaroo discharge and followup: Early home discharge in the kangaroo position from the neonatal unit is one of the original components of the KMC intervention. Physiological Benefits. KMC results in keeping neonates warm and cozy. Babies get protected against cold stress and hypothermia. Physiological parameters such as heart and respiratory rates, oxygenation, sleep patterns get stabilized. Clinical Benefits. KMC significantly increases milk production in mothers and exclusive breastfeeding rates. KMC improves weight gain in the infants and improves thermal protection. It reduces incidence of respiratory tract and nosocomial infections, improves emotional bonding between the infant and mothers and results in earlier discharge from the hospital.

        "exp": "Silverman Anderson Score (SAS) are widely used for the categorization of respiratory distress in neonates. It consists of five items: (1) chest retraction as compared with abdominal retraction during inhalation; (2) retraction of the lower intercostal muscles; (3) xiphoid retraction; (4) flaring of the nares with inhalation; and (5) grunting on exhalation. Chest movement- synchronized(0) vs. minimal lag(1) or sinking of the upper chest as the abdomen rises. In the most extreme instances, a seesaw-like movement of the chest and abdomen is observed and would be given a score of 2. Intercostal retractions- retraction between the ribs is rated as none(0), minimal(1)or marked(2). Xiphoid retractions- retraction below the xiphoid process are rated as none(0), minimal(1) or marked(2). Nasal flaring- no nasal flaring: 0. Minimal flaring is scored 1 and marked flaring is scored 2. Expiratory grunting- no grunting: 0, grunting that is audible with a stethoscope is scored 1, and grunting that is audible without using a stethoscope is scored 2. Adequate ventilation is indicated by a 0, severe respiratory distress is indicated by a score of 10. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",

You note large anterior and posterior fontanelles, a distended abdomen, and an umbilical hernia. This clinical presentation is likely a result of which of the following?",
        "exp": "The clinical findings of congenital hypothyroidism are subtle, and may not be present at all at birth; this is thought to be a result of passage of some maternal T4 transplacentally. Infants with examination findings will usually have an umbilical hernia and a distended abdomen. The head may be large, and the fontanelles will be large as well. The child may be hypothermic and have feeding difficulties; constipation and jaundice may be persistent. Skin may be cold and mottled, and edema may be found in the genitals and extremities. The heart rate may be slow, and anemia may develop. As these findings may be subtle or nonexistent, neonatal screening programs are extremely important for early diagnosis of these infants. Sepsis can cause hypothermia and poor feeding, but the 2-week course makes this choice unlikely.
