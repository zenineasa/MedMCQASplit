Glioblastoma multiforme (grave iv) is an aggressive form of astrocytoma with poor prognosis. Esophageal Ca and cholangiocarcinoma usually remain asymptomatic for a very long time. By the time they are detected these would have already spread. So the only treatment that can be offered is palliation.",

AKI / acute uric acid nephropathy (rapid accumulation of uric acid derived from the breakdown of nucleic acids) is central to the development of TLS. Renal failure then limits the clearance of potassium, phosphorus, and uric acid leading to hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and secondary hypocalcemia (phosphate chelation with calcium). Hypocalcemia of TLS may persist even after phosphate levels normalize, presumably because of acute deficiencies of 1, 25-vitamin D. Diagnosis by Cairo-Bishop Criteria. Cairo-Bishop criteria. Laboratory TLS>= 2 among. Clinical TLSUric acid>= 476 umol/LLaboratory TLSPotassium>= 6 mmol/L Phosphorus>=2. 1 mmol/L (children)>= 1. 5 mmol/L (adults). And >=1 among. Calcium<= 1. 75 mmol/L* Acute kidney injury* Seizure* Arrhythmia* Sudden death. Laboratory alterations should be measured within the same 24 hours and must occur within 3 days before and 7 days after therapy. TLS = tumour lysis syndrome. Cancers Associated with TLSHigh - large-volume, highly metabolic malignancies such as B-cell ALL and Burkitt's lymphoma. Low risk - slow-growing hematologic malignancies (such as multiple myeloma). Prevention. Methods to increase GFR and urine output are appropriate regardless of risk category. Prophylactic use of recombinant urate oxidase before chemotherapy. Management. Volume Expansion and Diuretics. Augmenting potassium, phosphate and uric acid excretion. A robust urine flow rate will decrease the calcium-phosphate product in the renal tubules. Decreasing the risk of crystal formation and micro-obstruction. Allopurinol. Structural isomer of hypoxanthine. It is metabolized by xanthine oxidase to oxypurinol (inhibits the conversion of xanthine to uric acid). Treatment can elevate serum and urine xanthine levels. Allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome--a constellation of rash, acute hepatitis and eosinophilia. Febuxostat is a novel xanthine oxidase inhibitor that does not have the hypersensitivity profile of allopurinol. Urinary Alkalinization. The solubility of uric acid is highly pH dependent. At a typical acidic urine pH of 5. 0, the solubility of uric acid is 15 mg/dL vs 200 mg/dL at a pH of 7. 0. A neutral urine pH may be achievable via the administration of bicarbonate with or without a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Rasburicase. Approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration in 2002 in children. It is an aspergillus-derived recombinant urate oxidase and catalyzes the conversion of uric acid to allantoin, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen peroxide. The latter can lead to devastating methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia in individuals with glucose- 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.",

It is a form of radiotherapy used primarily as part of the preparative regimen for haema-topoietic stem cell (or bone marrow) trans-plantation. As the name implies, TBI involves irradiation of the entire body. though in modern practice the lungs are often partially shielded to lower the risk of radiation - induced lung injury.

Total body irradiation in the setting of bone marrow transplantation serves to destroy or suppress the recipient's immune system. preventing immunologic rejection of transplanted donor bone marrow or blood stem cells. Additionally, high doses of total body irradiation can eradicate residual cancer cells in the transplant recipient, increasing the likelihood that the transplant will be successful. Doses of total body irradiation used in bone marrow transplantation typically range from 10 to >12 Gv. For reference, a dose of 4. 5 Gy is fatal in 50% of exposed individuals without aggressive medical care. Such high total body doses are made possible by spreading the total dose out between several sessions, or fractions, \" with an interval of time in between allowing other normal tissues some time to repair some of the damage caused. However, at these doses, total body irradiation both destroys the patient's bone marrow (allowing donor marrow to engraft) and kills residual cancer cells. Non-myeloablative bone marrow transplantation uses lower doses of total body irradiation, typically about 2 Gy, which do not destroy the host bone marrow but do suppress the host immune system sufficiently to promote donor engraftment. Protocols for allogeneic HSCT consist of 2 parts:- The preparative regimen- Transplantation itself. During the preparative conditioning regimen, chemotherapy, often associated with irradiation. is administered to destroy the patient's hematopoietic system and to suppress the immune system, especially T cells, so that graft rejection is prevented. In patients with malignancies, the preparative regimen also serves to significantly reduce the tumor burden.",
