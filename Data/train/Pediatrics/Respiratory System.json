The vast majority of children with croup recover without consequences or sequelae. Croup manifests as hoarseness, a seal-like barking cough, inspiratory stridor, and a variable degree of respiratory distress. However, morbidity is secondary to narrowing of the larynx and trachea below the level of the glottis (subglottic region), causing the characteristic audible inspiratory stridor. Parainfluenza viruses (types 1, 2, 3) are responsible for about 80% of croup cases. Urgent care or emergency department treatment of croup depends on the patient's degree of respiratory distress.

Etiology. Basic abnormality is the surfactant | (SP-B & SP-C) that helps reducing surface tension in the alveoli. In the absence of surfactant surface tension | and alveoli tend to collapse during expiration. Surfactant production starts around 20 weeks gestation. It appears in amniotic fluid between 28 and 32 weeks and peaks at 35 weeks Clinical features. The infant is almost always preterm but has weight appropriate for gestational age. Signs of HMD usually appear within minutes of birth. Hypoxemia and acidosis result in pulmonary vasoconstriction and R-L shunt across the foramen ovale. Characteristically, tachypnea, prominent (often audible) grunting, intercostal and subcostal retractions, nasal flaring, and duskiness are noted. Cyanosis increases and is often relatively unresponsive to oxygen administration. Mixed respiratory-metabolic acidosis, edema, ileus, and oliguria are other features. Death is rare on the 1st day of illness, usually occurs between days 2 and 7, and is associated with alveolar air leaks (interstitial emphysema, pneumothorax) and pulmonary hemorrhage or IVH. Diagnosis. Characteristic histological manifestation is diffuse alveolar damageX-ray shows reticulo-granular pattern, ground glass opacity, low lung volume, air bronchogram (more prominent early in the left lower lobe)and white out lungs in severe disease. Prenatal diagnosis - lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio in the amniotic fluid. Ratio > 2 - adequate lung maturity. Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) levels are low in amniotic fluid. Simple bedside test, the shake test can be done on the amniotic fluid or the gastric aspirate mixed with absolute alcohol. Bubbles formation indicates lung maturity.

        "exp": "Maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are large enough to harbor infections from infancy. Frontal sinuses are rarely large enough to harbor infections until the sixth to tenth year of life. Sphenoid sinuses do not become large until about the third to fifth year of life. In general, a \"cold\" lasting longer than 10 to 14 days with fever and facial pain is suggestive of rhinosinusitis. Examination of the nose can reveal pus draining from the middle meatus in maxillary, frontal, or anterior ethmoid sinusitis. Pus in the superior meatus indicates sphenoid or posterior ethmoid sinuses. Diagnosis is on clinical grounds and can be difficult. Positive findings on plain sinus films in a symptomatic child are supportive of sinusitis. CT scans are more sensitive, but are usually reserved for the more complicated cases. The treatment is usually oral antibiotics for 10 to 14 days. Decongestants and antihistamines have not been shown to be helpful or necessary. Brain abscess is unlikely in this patient who demonstrates no neurologic symptoms. A streptococcal throat infection should present with acute onset of sore throat without other signs and symptoms of upper respiratory infection.

Four hours ago, his cough became much worse. On physical examination in the ED, he is in moderate respiratory distress with tachypnea and nasal flaring. Upon auscultation, he has easily audible wheezing with scattered crackles bilaterally. His arterial blood gas on room air revealed a pH of 7. 46, a Pa. CO2 of 34 mm Hg, and a Pa. O2 of 75 mm Hg.

Of the choices given and with the findings on the radiograph (patchy infiltrates with flat diaphragms), monitoring oxygenation and hydration status is the most appropriate course of action as bronchiolitis is the most likely diagnosis. Bronchodilators and a short course of steroids are treatments for asthma, a less likely diagnosis in this patient without previous wheezing episodes and without a family history of atopy. A single dose of short-acting b-agonist might be tried in this patient but would be expected to be of limited benefit. A single dose of steroids would be an appropriate treatment for viral croup; intubation and antibiotics would be the approach to a patient with epiglottitis. Chest tube placement for a pneumothorax may be required if unilateral breath sounds were absent or if the radiograph demonstrated collapse; neither is noted in this case. The most likely cause of the illness is infection by respiratory syncytial virus, which causes outbreaks of bronchiolitis of varying severity, usually in the winter and spring. Other viruses, such as parainfluenza and the adeno-viruses, have also been implicated in producing bronchiolitis. Treatment is generally supportive in this usually self-limited condition.",

Routine inspiratory films are likely to appear normal or near normal (as outlined in the question and noted in the first radiograph). Expiratory films will identify air trapping behind the foreign body (as noted on the second radiograph). It is uncommon for the foreign body to be visible on the plain radiograph; a high index of suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis. Suspected foreign bodies in the airway are potentially diagnosed with fluoroscopy, but rigid bronchoscopy is not only diagnostic but also the treatment of choice for removal of the foreign body.",

Clinical Manifestations. Most boys afflicted with XLA remain well during the 1st 6-9 mo of life by viue of maternally transmitted IgG antibodies. Thereafter, they acquire infections with extracellular pyogenic organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, unless they are given prophylactic antibiotics or immunoglobulin therapy. Infections include sinusitis, otitis media, pneumonia, or, less often, sepsis or meningitis. Infections with Mycoplasma are also paicularly problematic. Chronic fungal infections are seen; Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia rarely occurs. Viral infections are usually handled normally with the exceptions of hepatitis viruses and enteroviruses.
