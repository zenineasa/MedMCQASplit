The vast majority of children with croup recover without consequences or sequelae. Croup manifests as hoarseness, a seal-like barking cough, inspiratory stridor, and a variable degree of respiratory distress. However, morbidity is secondary to narrowing of the larynx and trachea below the level of the glottis (subglottic region), causing the characteristic audible inspiratory stridor. Parainfluenza viruses (types 1, 2, 3) are responsible for about 80% of croup cases. Urgent care or emergency department treatment of croup depends on the patient's degree of respiratory distress.

In the absence of surfactant surface tension | and alveoli tend to collapse during expiration. Surfactant production starts around 20 weeks gestation. It appears in amniotic fluid between 28 and 32 weeks and peaks at 35 weeks Clinical features. The infant is almost always preterm but has weight appropriate for gestational age. Signs of HMD usually appear within minutes of birth. Hypoxemia and acidosis result in pulmonary vasoconstriction and R-L shunt across the foramen ovale. Characteristically, tachypnea, prominent (often audible) grunting, intercostal and subcostal retractions, nasal flaring, and duskiness are noted. Cyanosis increases and is often relatively unresponsive to oxygen administration. Mixed respiratory-metabolic acidosis, edema, ileus, and oliguria are other features. Death is rare on the 1st day of illness, usually occurs between days 2 and 7, and is associated with alveolar air leaks (interstitial emphysema, pneumothorax) and pulmonary hemorrhage or IVH. Diagnosis. Characteristic histological manifestation is diffuse alveolar damageX-ray shows reticulo-granular pattern, ground glass opacity, low lung volume, air bronchogram (more prominent early in the left lower lobe)and white out lungs in severe disease. Prenatal diagnosis - lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio in the amniotic fluid. Ratio > 2 - adequate lung maturity. Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) levels are low in amniotic fluid. Simple bedside test, the shake test can be done on the amniotic fluid or the gastric aspirate mixed with absolute alcohol. Bubbles formation indicates lung maturity.

Pus in the superior meatus indicates sphenoid or posterior ethmoid sinuses. Diagnosis is on clinical grounds and can be difficult. Positive findings on plain sinus films in a symptomatic child are supportive of sinusitis. CT scans are more sensitive, but are usually reserved for the more complicated cases. The treatment is usually oral antibiotics for 10 to 14 days. Decongestants and antihistamines have not been shown to be helpful or necessary.

In preterm neonates it occurs in 2-5 th day of life and is because of the immaturity of the developing brain. Central apnea can also occur due to pathological causes like sepsis, metabolic problems, temperature instability, respiratory distress, anemia, polycytemia.

Clinical Manifestations. Most boys afflicted with XLA remain well during the 1st 6-9 mo of life by viue of maternally transmitted IgG antibodies. Thereafter, they acquire infections with extracellular pyogenic organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, unless they are given prophylactic antibiotics or immunoglobulin therapy. Infections include sinusitis, otitis media, pneumonia, or, less often, sepsis or meningitis. Infections with Mycoplasma are also paicularly problematic. Chronic fungal infections are seen; Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia rarely occurs. Viral infections are usually handled normally with the exceptions of hepatitis viruses and enteroviruses.
