Another possibility would be epididymitis, especially if there is a possible antecedent history of sexual activity or urinary tract infection. Prehn sign, although not totally reliable, is elicited by gently lifting the scrotum toward the symphysis. Relief of the pain points to epididymitis; its worsening, to torsion. Doppler ultrasound (or surgical consultation) is a logical first step in this man's evaluation, demonstrating absence of flow in torsion and increased flow in epididymitis. Alternatively, a radionuclide scan will show diminished uptake in torsion and increased uptake in epididymitis.Treatment for torsion is surgical exploration and detorsion and scrotal orchiopexy. Causative organisms for epididymitis include Neisseria gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, and other bacteria. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics and rest is indicated. However, treating this patient with antibiotics without first excluding testicular torsion is ill-advised; loss of the testis can be expected after 4 to 6 hours of absent blood flow if the testis has torsioned.

This is followed by an appearance of pubic hair and lengthening of the penis. Spermarche( sperm production) stas during mid-adolescence. Laryngeal growth, manifesting as cracking of voice, begins in boys in mid-pubey, deepening of voice is complete by end of pubey. During pubey, boys gain 20-30 cm and girls 16-28 cm of height.

Which of the following history or physical examination findings is usually considered a contraindication to playing contact sports?",
        "exp": "The preparticipation sports physical examination is important in that it allows the physician to screen patients for potential risks associated with the sport they intend to play. That said, there are few real contraindications to sports participation. Having one eye is typically seen as a contraindication to playing contact sports like football or soccer. There are eye shields available, but in general these children are advised to avoid contact sports. Stable, repaired congenital heart disease; obesity; girls with a single ovary; and controlled diabetics are routinely allowed to participate. Other reasons to recommend against contact sports participation include hemophilia, single kidney, and unexplained syncope (until evaluated).",
