        "exp": "When an adolescent shows evidence of declining school performance or truancy, a change for the worse in personal habits and grooming, exaggerated mood swings, change in friends to an older and unacceptable group, and frequent hostile reactions in relationships with others, the possibility that he or she is abusing drugs or alcohol, or both, should be considered strongly. Dependence on drugs is a progressive disorder; therefore, prompt identification and intervention are required if serious complications are to be avoided. Routine health assessment of adolescents should include inquiry about the use of cigarettes, alcohol, and other drugs, and about school performance and family and peer relationships.",

Absence of menarche by the age of 16 years or 5 years after pubertal onset also indicates pubertal delay.

Defects in the hypothalamic- pituitary axis are associated with low gonadotropin levels (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism).
