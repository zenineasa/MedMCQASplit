        "exp": "Absolute contraindications to any peussis vaccination (including DTwP vaccine) are: - Anaphylaxis after previous dose. - Development of encephalopathy within 7 days following previous DTwP vaccination. - Progressive neurological disease - Relative contraindication. - Precautions: Previous dose associated with Persistent inconsolable crying of > 3 hrs, < 48hrs Hyperpyrexia (fever > 40. 5degC) hypotonic hyporesponsive episodes (HHE) within 48 hours of DTwP administration seizures with or without fever within 72 hours of administration of DTwP - These are considered as precautions but not contraindications to future doses of DTwP because these events generally do not reoccur with the next dose and they haven't been proven to cause permanent sequelae. But in case an event recurs with a subsequent dose, then fuher doses are contraindicated.",
