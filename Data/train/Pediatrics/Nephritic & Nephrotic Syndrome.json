The potential side effects of the drug (neutropenia, disseminated varicella, hemorrhagic cystitis, alopecia, sterility, increased risk of future malignancy) should be carefully reviewed with the family before initiating treatment. The dose of cyclophosphamide is 2-3 mg/kg/24 hr given as a single oral dose, for a total duration of 8-12 wk. Alternate-day prednisone therapy is often continued during the course of cyclophosphamide administration.
