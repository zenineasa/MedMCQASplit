        "exp": "(A) Marfan's syndrome # MARFAN'S SYNDROME is a disorder of connective tissue (elastin). The gene called fibrillin is on chromosome 15. Inheritance is autosomal ominant. Sporadic cases may occur. The patients are tall and slender. Extremities especially the fingers and toes are long and thin. The muscles are markedly hypotonic and joints are hyperextendible. At times the disorder may be associated with arthrogryposis (contraction of joints in flexion due to fibrous ankylosis). There may be subluxation of the lens and other ocular abnormalities e.g., cataract, coloboma, squint, nystagmus and megalocornea. Deformities of the chest and spine may be present. Other associated anomalies include aortic cystic medionecrosis leading to aortic dilatation and other valvular deformities. Intelligence is normal. It should be distinguished from cases of homocystinuria, which also may present with ectopia lentis and similar bone changes, but has associated mental retardation. The basic manifestations are joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, dystrophic scarring of the skin and easy bruising, and connective tissue fragility. Wound healing is delayed and there are freely movable subcutaneous nodules. Molecular genetics has helped to characterize 11 different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Homocystinuria is a relatively common metabolic error with autosomal recessive inheritance. In the most common situation, Type 1, cystathionine is not synthesized from homocysteine and serine because the enzyme cystathionine synthetase in the liver is deficient. Although the precursor, homocysteine accumulates in the tissues, it is rapidly oxidized to homocystine. The usual age of presentation is 3-4 years. The patients develop subluxation of the lens, recurrent thromboembolic episodes and have marfanoid features. Klinefelter syndrome is characterized by tall thin stature, small testes and small phallus, with the chromosomal karyotype of 47 XXY. Behavioral and psychiatric disorders and mental retardation are common.",

Wilm's tumour is the second most common type of all childhood solid tumours. Average age of diagnosis is between 2 and 3 years when the disease affects only one kidney, but often diagnosed at a younger age when both kidneys are involved.> Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma: affects the lymph nodes that are found deep within the body and is the third most common childhood cancer.

        "exp": "(B) 50% # Duchenne muscular dystrophy is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern.> Male children, who have an XY chromosome pair, receive one of their mother's two X chromosomes and their father's Y chromo- some. Women DMD carriers who have an abnormal X chromosome have a one-in-two chance of passing that abnormality on to their male children.> Unlike most female children, a male child with an inherited defective Xp21 gene does not have a second X chromosome to provide correct genetic instructions, and the disease manifests.> Sons of carrier females each have a 50% chance of having the disease, and the daughters each have a 50% chance of being carriers.> Daughters of men with Duchenne will always be carriers, since they will inherit an affected X chromosome from their father (note that the diagram only shows the results from an unaffected father).> Some females will also have very mild degrees of muscular dystrophy, and this is known as being a manifesting carrier. In one-third of the cases, the disease is a result of an unspontaneous or new mutation.",

(a) Cystic hygroma.* Cystic hygroma is a form of Lymphangioma caused by benign aberrant development of lymphatics and presents at birth with airway obstruction.* Imaging with USG, CT scan or MRI can identify the extent of lesion and surgery is required.

Doxycycline, ethanol and sildenafil are Sclerosants and sclerotherapy can be done.* Sternocleidomastoid tumor is seen after a traumatic birth and leads to lump in neck with torticollis.* Brachial cyst is small and located on anterior border of sternocleidomastoid and does not cause respiratory compromise.Image source. style=\"font-size: 1.04761904761905em; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif; margin: 0\">",
