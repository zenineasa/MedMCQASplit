IMS November 2006 Repeat)\"On exposure to cold and wet environment, the neonate tries to generate heat by increased activity (crying with agitated movement) and a sympathetic surge that causes vasoconstriction and non-shivering thermogenesis in the brown fat. Babies attempt to conserve heat by peripheral vasoconstriction. \"\"Brown fat is a well-vascularized, sympathetically innervated lipid collection located in the axillae, groin, nape of the neck, interscapular area and perineal area. Cold stress causes the release of norepinephrine that uncouples beta-oxidation in fat with resultant heat generation. Preterm and small-for-gestational age inf ants have immature thermogenic response because of scanty brown fat stores. \"Role of Brown Fat in Thermogenesis* A newborn baby is more prone to develop hypothermia because of large surface area per unit of body weight.* In infants, brown fat is an important site of thermogenesis. It results in the so-called non-shivering thermogenesis.* Brown fat is located around the adrenal glands, kidney, nape of neck, interscapular and axillary region.* Metabolism of brown fat leads to heat production.* Blood floiving through the brown fat becomes warm and through circulation, transfers heat to other parts of the body.

When the infant has to swallow, the soft palate rapidly moves upward to close off the back of the back of nasal air tube. At the same time, the epiglottis closes off the larynx and guides the milk into the esophagus. Because of these factors, infant can breath and swallow in quick succession.

Pediatric Advanced Life Support Provider Manual (A Modification of the Pediatric Assessment Triangle in the 2006 edition of the PALS textbook). Explanation: Consciousness, breathing, colour are seen in initial evaluation. Then Pulse and airway are seen according to PALS. PALS Systematic Approach Algorithm of the 2010 Edition. Initial Impression. Consciousness, breathing, and color are assessed initially. Consciousness\"The level of consciousness may be characterized as unresponsive, irritable, or alert. Decreased level of consciousness may result from inadequate 02 or substrate delivery or brain trauma, 'dysfunction. \"Breathing\"Abnormal breathing includes use of accessory muscles, extra sounds of breathing or abnormal breathing patterns. ''Color\"Pale, modeled, or bluis. IVgray skin color suggests poor perfusion, poor oxygenation, or both. A flushed appearance suggests fever or the presence of a toxin. \"T1. CLSConsciousness in the newborn and infant can be assessed using the TICLS mneumonic. T stands for tone. And the tone can be from vigorous to limp. Every child including newborns should have good muscle tone, that is, they should not be floppy. I stands for interactive. The infant normally should be interested in his or her surroundings. C stands for consolability. The normal infant should be able to be consoled. L stands for look meaning gaze. The normal infant should follow with his or her eyes interesting objects. A glassy eyed stare is abnormal. S stands for speech or cry. The normal infant should have a normal cry.
