Compensatory mechanisms will usually attempt to restore normothermia at body temperatures above 32deg C; below this temperature, thermoregulation fails and spontaneous rewarming will not occur.

When the infant has to swallow, the soft palate rapidly moves upward to close off the back of the back of nasal air tube. At the same time, the epiglottis closes off the larynx and guides the milk into the esophagus. Because of these factors, infant can breath and swallow in quick succession. 'As the person grow older, the larynx moves down to a lower position, this leaves a lorge gap between the back of mouth and the top of the larynx.
