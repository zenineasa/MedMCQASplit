        "question": "A new bom child developed respiratory depression in neonatal ward. Which of the following drug is the cause -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Opioids Epidural opioid (fentanyl) analgesia is commonly employed as a therapeutic modality in the management of pain during labour. The general perception is that administered drugs remain in the maternal epidural space and do not compromise the respiratory status of the newborn. Contrary to the widely held belief fentanyl diffuses freely from the epidural space into the maternal blood because of its high lipid solubility. Equilibrium is reached within 10-30 min. The drug is freely transported across the placenta with a slightly higher concentration in the fetal compartment because of a comparative acidic pH. There is no consensus on the dose of fentanyl causing respiratory depression in the newborn period. However, it appears that neonates are prone to respiratory depression at a lower concentration because of the immaturity of the respiratory centre. According to the Cochrane analysis. Morphine, meperidine and fentanyl are the opioids that have been studied the most in labour analgesia research. These opioids as well as newer alternatives, such as nalbuphine have been associated with newborn respiratory depression at birth. Opioids are known for their high lipid solubility which allows rapid transfer of the drug through the placenta and into the fetus. The risk of respiratory depression is highest if birth occurs at the time of peak fetal uptake between 1-4 hours after administration of drug to the mother. Repeated doses of opioids results in significant fetal exposure and neonatal respiratory depression. Opioids are also used in neonates for pain management. They are the mainstay of pain management in newborn. In newborns the clearance is diminished and elimination half-lives are prolonged as compared to adults because of the immaturity of hepatic cytochrome system of the neonates. Therefore opioid administration may result in opioid accumulation and respiratory depression.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Air bronchogram in chest X- Ray Age of onset of infant Respiratory distress syndrome. Infant respiratory distress syndrome presents immediately or soon after birth. Incidence and severity of RDS is inversely related to gestational age. Approximately 50% of the neonates born at 26 - 28 weeks gestation develops respiratory distress syndrome where as less than 30% of premature neonates born at 30-31 weeks gestation develop respiratory distress syndrome. Administration of antenatal corticosteroid reduces the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome Administration of single dose of corticosteroid reduces the incidence and severity of respiratory distress syndrome if delivery occurs within one week of administration of corticosteroid. Administration of corticosteroid cause 50% reduction in the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome.

Air bronchogram. Air bronchogram refers to the visualization of air filled bronchus when the surrounding alveoli are opacified. Normally, the lung fields are radiolucent and the bronchi are not separately visualized. But in certain conditions there is opacification of the alveoli due to various reasons. Due to this reason, the bronchus stands out as \"radiolucent\" in contrast to the adjacent alveoli, that are\" radiopaque\"These changes can be due to pneumonic consolidation, collapse of a part of the lung, or inflammatory edema in the lung tissue.
