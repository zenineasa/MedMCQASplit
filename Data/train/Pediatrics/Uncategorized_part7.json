Physiological pubeal gynecomastia o Development of gynecomastia in early to mid pubey in some boys o It can be both unilateral and bilateral o The breast may present with transitory tenderness o The breast regresses spontaneously and rarely persists for more than 2 years Mean concentration of all the Sex hormones such as FSH, LH, Prolactin, Testosterone, Estrone and Estradiol are normal. About other options: ? Testicular tumour - The sexual maturity rating of the boy will be altered because of the alteration in the level of the sexual hormone level . Chronic liver disease - Chronic liver disease can also cause gynecomastia, but the patient will present with signs and symptoms of Chronic liver disease along with Gynecomastia. Prolactinoma - Prolactinoma are more common in adolescent females but can also present in adolescent males. Most of the patients will present with loss of libido and signs of visual field defects.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Intubate and ventilate Management of unconscious child o Unconsciousness (coma) is usually graded according to a standard scale so that changes in the level of consciousness can be evaluated accurately. o Glasgow coma scale is commonly used evaluation system. In this scale : ? Total score = Eye opening + motor response + verbal response o The best response is scored. The lowest score is 3, and the highest is 15 (fully conscious child). A score of 8 or less suggests severe brain dysfunction, a score of 9-12 moderate brain dysfunction and a score of 13-15 minor brain dysfunction. Investigations o If the cause of coma is unknown, following investigations may be required : - i) Lumbar puncture ECG iii) Skull radiography/CT/MR' iv) Cervical spine imaging o Blood is drawn for a CBC, electrolyte determination, toxicology tests, blood gas analysis, BUN and cross matching. Management o Care of the child in coma is directed towards maintaining body function in optimal state until the child regains consciousness. Management includes : ? 1) Airway As a general rule, place the child on his/her side to reduce the risk of aspiration. Oral suctioning to remove mucus from the mouth and pharynx may be necessary. If Glassgow score is 8 or less and clinical circumstances do not suggests improvement then intubation is indicated to secure airway. 2) Breathing Oxygen is given especially when oxygen saturation is low. 3) Circulation Venous access is obtained. Signs of shock are assessed and treated as indicated. 4) Drugs and specific therapy After maintenance of breathing and circulation, specific therapy is given e.g., antibiotics for infection, dextrose in hypoglycemia, naloxone in opiates poisoning etc.",

When the effective area of the defect is large, there is viually no resistance to flow, and systemic systolic pressure is present in the right ventricle and the pulmonary aery. At bih, pulmonary vascular resistance is high, with little if any left-to-right shunt, despite the presence of a large defect. This resistance gradually falls over the first few weeks of life, permitting a progressively greater amount of blood to flow through the defect, to the pulmonary aeries and back to the left atrium and left ventricle. In many infants, the left ventricular volume overload eventually leads to left ventricular \"failure,\" with elevated left ventricular end-diastolic and left atrial pressures and pulmonary congestion. With a large VSD and a high pulmonary vascular resistance, the systolic murmur becomes soft and sho because there is little left-to-right shunt across a large defect, and a right-to-left shunt across the VSD causes little or no murmur.

        "exp": "Poal venous gas is seen in association with pneumatosis intestinalis, most commonly with necrotizing enterocolitis. The physiology of this is that the poal vein, the mesenteric veins, drains nutrient-rich blood from the gut to the liver. In the case of necrosis with air in the bowel wall, air migrates into the poal venous system and to the liver. On CT, this has the characteristic appearance of peripheral lucencies following the poal venous system intrahepatically. In cases of more severe pneumatosis, the bowel may rupture and lead to pneumoperitoneum. Also Know: Pneumobilia, or air in the biliary tract, would be seen after instrumentation of the biliary system, such as after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP). Other causes include a gas-forming infection within the biliary tree or previous sphincterotomy (endoscopic opening of the sphincter of Oddi). Pneumobilia has a distinct appearance on CT: there is gas located centrally in the liver within the ducts. Hemobilia, or blood in the biliary tract, would be seen after instrumentation of the biliary system, such as after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP), from a biliary or hepatic tumor, or secondary to a hypocoagulable state. Hemobilia is found at endoscopy, and is generally not visible on plain radiographs. High attenuation material may be seen within the bile ducts on a CT scan, suggesting hemobilia. Hepatic venous gas would not be seen with pneumatosis because the hepatic veins drain the liver into the inferior vena cava (IVC). Gas from the bowel wall gets trapped in the poal veins and does not traverse the liver to get into the hepatic veins. Ref: Thilo E.H., Rosenberg A.A. (2012). Chapter 2. The Newborn Infant. In W.W.

Thus, this option is also excluded. o Coming to hypoparathyroidism: As the name suggests, PTH is low in hypoparathyroidism. But, sometimes PTH may be in normal range (10-60 Pg/ml) and this is inappropriately normal PTH. However it is generally believed that 'Normal' levels of PTH in a patient with hypocalcemia indicate 'inappropriately normal PTH' and relative Hypoparathyroidism should always be considered as the initial diagnosis. `Serum PTH levels should be related to the concurrent serum calcium. High PTH is the normal response to hypocalcemia and therefore 'normal' PTH in a patient with Hypocalcemia indicates relative Hypoparathyroidism' -Practical Algorithms in Pediatric Endocrinology' by Hochberg (2007)/71. 'Because normally hypocalemia is a potent stimulus for secretion of PTH, patients with intact parathyroid gland function should be expected to have high circulating levels of PTH, during hypocalcemic episodes. Low levels of serum PTH and in some assays even inapropriately 'normal' levels despite hypocalcemia should prompt consideration of various form of hypoparathyroidism' - Principles and Practice of Endocrinology & Metabolism' by Beeker.",

Underactive thyroid problems, diabetes and problems with the intestinal and digestive tract are also seen in people with Down's syndrome, especially duodenal atresia. Patient may have conductive hearing loss. Most children with Down's syndrome experience respiratory tract problems, due to the small nasal bridge and the shoer lung capacity. There is some evidence to suggest that people with Down's syndrome have an increased probability of developing Alzheimer's disease. People with Down's syndrome have a characteristic facial appearance. For example, Their eyes appear to slant upwards and outwards. The head is usually flatter at the back and people with Down's syndrome often have a low hairline. The face often appears flatter with a flat nasal bridge and the tongue is often larger than usual. Iv.The ears often appear small and low set and there is often a distinctive fold of loose skin on the back of the neck. This increased thickness on the back of the neck may be detected in pregnancy (nuchal translucency) and can contribute to a diagnosis of Down's syndrome. People with Down's syndrome often have broad hands with sho fingers. Other common features associated with Down's syndrome include floppiness or poor muscle tone (hypotonia), and loose or bendy joints.

Ilemolysis associated with ABO incompatibility exclusively occurs in type \"0\" mothers with fetuses who have type A or type B blood. - The naturally occurring antibodies in ABO blood group (A, B, AB) is of the \"IgM class\" and it cannot cross the placenta. - As compared with the other ABO blood groups that have predo- minantly IgM antibodies group 0 mothers also have significant amount of naturally occurring \"IgG antibody\". -These IgG antibodies can easily cross the placenta and produce hemolysis in,fetus. ABO incompatibility usually causes mild hemolysis and anemia. The lack of severity of hemolytic disease can be attributed to the following factors. - There is wide expression of A and B antigens not only on red cells but also in plasma and other cells which will paially neutralize maternally derived ABO antibodies. - In addition, fetal RBC's are not .fully developed in the infant and they express less number of A and B antigenic sites, hence the low incidence of significant hemolysis in affected neonates. Therefore in ABO incompatibility, hyperbilirubinemia is the predo- minaret manifestation of incompatibility (rather than anemia). The peripheral blood picture in these patients show Micro.spherocytesQ Reticulocytosis Polychromasia (not as characteristically seen as in other hemolytic anemias) Microspherocytes Spherocytes are associated with allt0i117177Une hemolytic anemias as the cell membrane of antibody coated RBC is lost .following interaction of RBC's with splenic macrophages. The slow. .flow of blood through the spleen provides an ample oppounity for the macrophage to come in contact with coated RBC's. The macrophages subsequently removes a poion of the RBC membrane and release the RBC in the spherocy- tic form with a typically decreased surface area to volume ratio. Note : Microspherocytes are characteristically seen in of ABO incompati- bility but in the other hemolytic disease of the newborn, i.e. erythroblastosis fetalis, they are characteristically absent. Polychromasia Polychromasia can be seen in ABO incompatibility but is not characteristic as in any other hemolytic anemia Polychromasia refers to variation in erythrocyte coloration - This variation is largely related to be maturation of the erythrocytes - The younger form owing to the presence of nucleus or RNA, stains blue, with Romanowsky stains where as mature forms due to the absence of nuclear material will stain uniformly orange pink. - Polychromasia is usually seen when RBC is released prematurely from the bone 111(1i-row to compensate for the blood loss. They are usually associated with hemolysis - In these conditions there is an increased erythroid response from the bone marrow - Immature RBC's or reticulocytes move into the circulation from the bone marrow. These RBC's have nucleus (if they are upto normoblast stage, or RNA's (as in reticulocytes) - These immature BBC's stain blue with Romanowsky stains. In ABO incompatibility in the newborn hemolysis is mild, the compensatory erythroid response from the bone marrow too would be mild.

The papules may join together to form large areas of palpable purpura or ecchymoses (bruises). Gums may swell and become red, soft and spongy. Any slight friction may cause the gums to bleed. Often this results in poor oral hygiene and dental diseases. Bleeding in the joints causes extreme discomfo and pain. Joints may be swollen and tender and the pain can be so severe that patients cannot walk. Patients may complain of dryness, irritation, light intolerance, transient visual blurring and stickiness. Haemorrhaging (bleeding) beneath the conjunctiva and within the optic nerve sheath may also occur.

In addition to hemorrhages these patients may have poor wound healing a high incidence of infeility among males and aboion among affected females and a high incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. About other options : Von Willebrand disease Patients with Von-Willebrand disease rarely presents in the neonatal period because plasma concentration of Von Willebrand factor is high in neonatal period. Platelet function disorders Genetic disorders that result in deficient platelet function are rare causes of bleeding in infants. Most patients with these platelet disorders do not present in neonatal period but rather later in life. They are not recognized as a problem during the neonatal period. (1) Glanzman's thromboasthenia This is an extremely rare disorder of the blood in which the platelets lack the glycoprotein Hence platelet aggregation cannot occur and bleeding time is significantly prolonged and there is increased bleeding. (ii) Bernard soulier syndrome It is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and large platelets (giant platelets) There is absence of the platelet membrane Gplb/IX complex. Symptoms are consistent with low or dysfunctional platelets and include easy bruising, nosebleeds, mucosal bleeding, menorrhagia and occasionally G.1. bleeding Factor XII deficiency It is not associated with clinical bleeding.",

Management of necrotizing enterocolitis Medical treatment of NEC include Cessation of feeding Nasogastric decompression Administration of i.v. fluids Systemic antibiotic against both gram +ve as well as gram -ye bacteria (after taking samples for blood culture). Ventilation should be assisted if distention is contributing to hypoxia. Early surgery consultation Surgical interventions in NEC Evidence of perforation is an indication for laparotomy and resection of necrotic bowel. Failure to respond to medical management, a single fixed bowel loop, erythema of the abdominal wall and a palpable mass are additional indications of exploratory laparotomy, resection of necrotic bowel and external ostomy diveion. Peritoneal drainage may be helpful for patients with peritonitis who are too unstable to withstand surgery. It is more successful in patients with isolated intestinal perforation. In many patients, no fuher surgical procedure is required. Peritoneal drainage is performed under local anaesthesia. A penrose drain is placed in the right lower quadrant and permitted to drain peritoneal contents and decompress the abdomen. This procedure is employed predominantly in infants less than 1000g who have severe SIRS and are viewed as too unstable to be transpoed or to undergo laparotomy. In experienced hands, one third of the patients require only drain placement. A primary anastomosis at the time of initial surgery is indicated in patients with limited localized disease who have no distal bowel involvement and in patients who have demonstrated a walled-off perforation who are no longer manifesting the SIRS. From this discussion, we choose the answer to be peritoneal drainage because : Patients is on ventilator (too unstable).

        "question": "Deep white matter lesion with bilateral deep bright thalamic appearance is suggestive of which disease?",
        "exp": "Deep white matter lesion along with the involvement of thalamus suggests Krabbe's disease. The deficient lysosomal enzyme in Krabbe disease is galactocerebrosidase (GALC; also called galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase); it normally degrades galactocerebroside to ceramide and galactose. The deficiency results in the accumulation of galactocerebroside; a toxic metabolite, psychosine, leads to the early destruction of oligodendrocytes and depletion of lipids in the cerebral white matter. The EEG shows nonspecific slowing without spikes, and the CSF protein is usually elevated (70 to 450 mg/dL). CT scanning and MRI reveal symmetrical nonenhancing areas of increased density in the internal capsules and basal ganglia. C.T. shows diffuse symmetric attenuation of the cerebellar and cerebral white matter in Alexander's disease. The onset is in infancy with a failure to thrive, psychomotor retardation, spasticity of the craniospinal musculature, and seizures. An early and progressive macrocephaly has been a consistent feature.Pathologically, there are severe destructive changes in the cerebral white matter, most intense in the frontal lobes. Distinctive eosinophilic hyaline bodies, most prominent just below the pia and around blood vessels, are seen throughout the cerebral coex, brainstem, and spinal cord. These have been identified as Rosenthal fibers and probably represent glial degradation products. C.T. scan demonstrates degeneration of the white matter most prominent in the frontal lobes. Canavan's disease. C.T. scan shows diffuse white matter degeneration primarily in the cerebral hemispheres with less involvement in the cerebellum and brainstem in Metachromatic leukodystrophy. This is another of the lysosomal (sphingolipid) storage diseases. The abnormality is the mutation of the gene for enzyme arylsulfatase A, which prevents the conversion of sulfatide to cerebroside (a major component of myelin) and results in an accumulation of the former.

Scores 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low, 4 to 6 fairly low, and 7 to I 0 generally normal. o A low score on the one-minute test may show that the neonate requires medical attention (e.g. resuscitation) but is not necessarily an indication that there will be long-term problems, paicularly if there is an improvement by the stage of the five-minute test. If the Apgar score remains below 3 at later times such as 10, 15 or 30 mintues, there is a risk that the child will suffer longer-term neurological damage. There is also a small but significant increase of the risk of cerebral palsy. However, the purpose of the Apgar test is to determine quickly whether a newborn needs immediate medical care; it was not designed to make long-term predicitions on a child's health. CO2 transpo across placenta o CO2 is cleared by placenta by simple diffusion. CO2 is produced abundantly in the fetus, and the PCO2 of fetal blood is higher than maternal blood. CO2 therefore diffuses from fetal blood, through the placenta, into the maternal circulation, and is disposed by expiration from mother's lung. Anaerobic metabolism causes acidemia due to lactate (lactic acid) production o Anoxic perfusion causes an increase in glucose consumption which is more than two fold higher than that seen in the oxygenated perfusion, resulting finally in placental uptake of glucose not only from the maternal but also from the fetal circulation. o Lactate production is increased during the anoxic perfusion, while the final tissue energy value lies between the values observed for fresh tissue and for the oxygenated perfusion. The shift to anerobic metabolism shown by placental tissue in anoxic conditions enables continued functioning of the tissue over the 2-h perfusion period but it appear that under anoxic conditions the tissue may incur an energy debt not observed in oxygenated perfusions.",

Even if you do not remember all of the details of the presentation of these genetic diseases, you should be able to narrow the choices: Gaucher's disease and Niemann-Pick disease are lipid storage diseases, and would not be expected to produce hypoglycemia.

However, you should keep in mind that this fact is true when we are comparing the spontaneous closure of PDA between term and pre-term neonate. Overall, the percentage of spontaneous closure of PDA in preterm neonate is very low. To avoid confusion, I am explaining following facts in brief :-\n\n\n\nNormal neonate :- Ductus arteriosus closes functionally within about 15 hours of birth.\nFDA in term (mature) neonate :- The persistence of ductus arteriosus beyond 24 hours after birth is considered as PDA in term neonate. Spontaneous closure of PDA does not usually occur because PDA results from structural abnormality.\nFDA in pre-term (pre-mature) neonate :- The ductus arteriosus in pre-term neonate is not as responsive to increased oxygen content as it is in term neonate. However, there is no structural abnormality.\n\n\nChances of spontaneous closure are very less (compared to normal term neonate).\nChances of spontaneous closure are more than the term-neonate with PDA. However, in premature neonate, where hypoxic pulmonary disease is common place, the ductus being sensitive to hypoxia, remains open.\n\n\nSo, it is very unlikely that spontaneous closure of PDA will occur in pre-term neonate. But chances are more when compared to term neonate with PDA (not nonnal term neonate in which ductus arteriosus closes within 15 hours of birth).\n\nManifestations of PDA in pre-term neonate\n\nApnea for unexplained reasons in an infant recovering from RDS;\nA hyperdynamic precordium, bounding peripheral pulses, wide pulse pressure, and a continuous or systolic murmur with or without extension into diastole or an apical diastolic murmur, multiple clicks resembling the shaking of dice;\nCarbon 'oxide retention;\nIncreasing oxygen dependence;\nX-ray evidence of cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings; and\nHepatomegaly\n\n\nIncreased pulmonary blood flow and compromised ventricular function accompanying dropping pulmonary resistance in the setting of a P A is a significant risk factor for pulmonary hemorrhage.\nThe greatest risk factor for NEC is prematurity. Any etiology which leads on to hemodynamic or hypoxic insult predisposes to NEC. PDA is common in preteen infants and it definitely causes hemodynamic stress and is a risk factor for development of NEC.",

It is a neuroendocrine\u00a0tumor, arising from any neural crest element of the sympathetic nervous system.\nNeuroblastoma is a disease of early childhood with approximately 90% of patients presenting before 5-years of age and almost 50% within the first 2-years of life.\nIn childhood, about 40% of neuroblastomas arise in the adrenal medullae. The remainder occurs anywhere along the sympathetic chain, with the most common locations being the paravertebral region of the abdomen (25%) and posterior mediastinum (15%).\u00a0Tumors\u00a0may arise in numerous other sites, including the pelvis and neck and within the brain (cerebral neuroblastomas).\nIt is the second most common solid malignancy of childhood.\nIn young children, under age 2 years, neuroblastomas generally present with large abdominal masses, fever, and possibly weight loss. In older children, they may not come to attention until metastases produce manifestations, such as hone pain, respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints.\nNeuroblastomas may metastasize widely (Present in 60-70%- O.P. Ghai 7th/5990) through the hematogenous and lymphatic systems, particularly to liver, lungs, and bones, in addition to the bone marrow.\nProptosis and ecchymosis may also be present because the periorbital region is a common metastatic site. Bladder and bowel dysfunction may be caused by paraspinal neuroblastomas that impinge on nerves.\nIn neonates, disseminated neuroblastomas may present with multiple cutaneous metastases with deep blue discolora\u00adtion to the skin (earning the rather unfortunate designation of \"blueberry muffin baby)\"\nAbout 90% of neuroblastomas, regardless of location, produce catecholamines (similar to the catecholamines associ\u00adated with pheochromocytomas), which are an important diagnostic feature (i.e., elevated blood levels of catecholamines and elevated urine levels of metabolites, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and homovanillic acid (HVA)\nChildren older than age 5 years usually have extremely poor outcomes irrespective of the stage (Robbins 7th/500-503)\nNB can present as a paraneoplastic syndrome of autoimmune origin manifesting as ataxia or\u00a0opsomyoclonus\u00a0(\"dancing eye & dancing feet\").",

Thelarche (breast development) is the first sign of pubey (Tanner stage B2). It usually begins between 8 and 10 years of age and is associated with increased estrogen production. Pubarche (development of pubic and axillary hair) is the second stage in maturation and typically occurs between 11 and 12 years of age. Axillary hair usually appears after the growth of pubic hair is complete. Menarche (onset of menstruation) usually occurs 2-3 years after thelarche at an average age of 11-13 years.

        "exp": "Volvulus neonatorum \n\nThe fetal alimentary canal returns from the extraembryonic coelom into the abdomen at 8-10 weeks and the bowel undergoes rotation and fixation at certain points by the attachment of its mesentery to the posterior abdominal wall.\nWhen the process is incomplete or deviates from the normal plan, the result is malfixation or malrotation.\nCommonly, the normal oblique attachment of the mesentery from duodenojejunal flexure of the caecum is absent, and the small bowel is attached to the posterior abdominal wall by a narrow stalk based around superior mesenteric vessels. The caecum is undescended, i.e., situated in the right hypochondrium and abnormally fixed by peritoneal bands running laterally across the second part of the duodenum.\nThe poorly attached small bowel undergoes volvulus around the axis of the 'universal mesentery', which is twisted so that the flow of blood is cut off, producing a strangulating obstruction of the small bowel. This typically occurs in the newborn, hence the term `Volvulus neonatorum'. The terminal ileum and caecum are drawn into the volvulus and are wrapped around the stalk of the mesentery in two or three tight coils.\n\nClinical feature \n\nA young infant, previously healthy, starts bile-stained vomiting during the first few days of the live. The abdomen is soft and non-distended; however, abdominal distension may occur which is limited to upper abdomen (epigastrium).\nNo obstruction may occur in the first day or two after birth and meconium may be passed normally. Then, with variable suddenness, bowel actions cease with onset of obstruction.\nThe signs vary, depending on the degree of intestinal obstruction versus ischemia. When strangulation occurs there are signs of shock, especially pallor and a vague mass of congested bowel may be palpable in the centre of the abdomen. Blood or blood-tinged mucus may be passed rectally.\nIschemia may result in gangrene and perforation.\n\nInvestigations \u00a0\n\nBarium contrast studies with fluoroscopy (Barium meal follow through) is the investigation of choice as X-ray is not reliable in early stages of volvulus.\nHowever, if the perforation is suspected, barium contrast should not be used because of the risk of peritonitis. Water-soluble contrast studies (iodine based) should be used. Plain X-ray of abdomen/chest is the initial investigation to demonstrate free air under the diaphragm in suspected cases of perforation.",

In the absence of continuous oxygen saturation monitoring, it is reasonable to give nasopharyngeal oxygen (0.5 litre/min) until the baby recovers. If monitoring is available, oxygen is given as appropriate. Thermal control. Baby's body temperature should be kept in the normal range of 36.5-37.2degC (sometimes the babies become hyperpyrexic). Correction of shock, If peripheral perfusion is poor, it is reasonable to give 20 ml/kg of normal saline initially. If perfusion remains poor, the use of dopamine should be considered. Fluid balance. Give IV fluids at 2/3 maintenance. Use 10% dextrose. Monitor blood glucose with dextrostix and do not let it fall below 2.2 mmol (explains glucose administration) Prevent/control convulsions. In less severely affected babies, phenobarbitone should be given when there is anyuspicion of actual or impending convulsions (phenobarbitone loading dose 20 mg/kg IM or 10mg/kg slowly IV, then 5 mg/kg daily orally). Treat hvpocaleaemia if it occurs (or more practically, if the baby has uncontrollable fitting with anormal dextrostix). (explains calcium gluconate administration) Notes I.

Myoclonic jerks, especially in the morning, are of variable intensity ranging from simple twitching (\"flying saucer syndrome\") to falls; consciousness is not impaired in it. It is precipitated by alcohol and sleep deprivation. Patients will have normal intelligence. The typical interictal EEG abnormality consists of a generalized 4- to 6-Hz spike or polyspike and slow-wave discharges lasting 1-20 seconds. Usually, 1-3 spikes precede each slow wave. Also know: In Generalized tonic clonic seizure EEG shows a normal background with generalized epileptiform discharges such as spike or polyspike wave complexes at 2.5 to 4 Hz. During absence seizures there is an abrupt onset of bilaterally synchronous and symmetrical 3 Hz spike-wave discharge, irrespective of whether typical absences are simple or complex. Ictal recordings from patients with typical temporal lobe epilepsy usually exhibit 5-7 Hz, rhythmic, sharp theta activity, maximal in the sphenoidal and the basal temporal electrodes on the side of seizure origin.

The purpose of this receptor is the binding of the granulocyte to the cytokine (GCSF) in order to give the signal to the cell to mature and multiply.\nPatients with Kostamann's syndrome produce GCSF but because of the defect in GCSF receptor the response of neutrophils to normal amounts of GCSF in the blood is reduced: However, they can respond if the amount of GCSF is increased \u2192 These patients will respond to a higher dose of GCSE",

Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA are located in different places in the cell. During feilization, the sperm and egg cell nuclei fuse to form an embryo. The egg cell is very large compared to the sperm, so although the cells' nuclei fuse, the rest of the cell mass in the embryo comes from the egg only. Nuclear DNA is therefore co-inherited but the mitochondrial DNA, which is located outside of the nucleus, is always maternally inherited because all mitochondria in a foetus and later adult are derived from the mitochondria in the mother's egg.
