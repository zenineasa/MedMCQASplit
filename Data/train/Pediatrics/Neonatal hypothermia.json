Training and awareness rising Hypothermia Prevention Newborn Infants The bihing room should have ambient temperature of at least 25degC and should be free from drafts of air (keep windows and doors closed). After delivery, the baby should be dried immediately, put in skin-to-skin contact on mother's abdomen and covered by warm and dry linen. The wet towel should be discarded. The baby should be capped and dressed adequately (Fig. 9. 19). Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is an effective way to keep LBW baby warm. Frequent breastfeeding is critical to provide energy to keep the baby warm. Bathingandweighingarepostponed. Termbabiescan be sponged after 24 hours of life in summer months. Bathing should be postponed during winters and in sick or LBW babies until the umbilical cord falls off (end of first week). Dressing the baby in multiple layers of warm and light clothes provides better thermal protection than a single layer of heavy woolen clothing. Mother and baby should be kept on the same bed (co- bedding/rooming in). * Warm transpoation: This is the weakest link in the warm chain with greatest possibility of severe and undetected hypothermia. * Training/awareness of healthcare providers: Unless persons involved in the care of newborns realize the implications of hypothermia, it cannot be detected or managed effectively. Evidence shows that KMC:* Is as good as incubator care in terms of safety andthermal protection",
