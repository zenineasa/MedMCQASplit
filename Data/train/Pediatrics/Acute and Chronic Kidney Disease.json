        "exp": "Best treatment of atypical HUS is- Plasmapheresis Repeated plasma exchange with infusion of fresh frozen plasma is recommended for atypical HUS & performed daily until hematological remission. Atypical HUS Often lacks the prodromal history of diarrhoea or dysentery. Predisposing factors include mutations in regulators of the complement pathway (factors H, I and B, C3, membrane cofactor protein and thrombomodulin), and antibodies against complement factor H. The diagnosis is made by the combination of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes, thrombocytopenia, and kidney involvement. Renal biopsy is rarely required. Treatment includes management of complications of renal failure, treatment of hypeension and correction of anemia. Proper nutrition must be ensured. Repeated plasma exchange with infusion of fresh frozen plasma is recommended for atypical HUS & performed daily until hematological remission.",

IVP (Intravenous pyelography) gives valuable information about renal anatomy and function. But due to the risk of anaphylaxis with the contrast material use of IVP has declined following the availability of radionuclide imaging. d. 24 hrs creatinine clearance can be calculated by collecting a timed urinary specimen and taking a blood sample around the mid-collection period. In children, in addition to problem with urine collection, this overestimates the actual GFR and can't be used to assess isolated kidney function.",
