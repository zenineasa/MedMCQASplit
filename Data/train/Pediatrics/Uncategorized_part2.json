The valves are mucosal folds that look like thin membranes; they may cause varying degrees of obstruction when the child attempts to void. Children with posterior urethral valves may present with mild, moderate, or severe symptoms of obstruction. Urinary infection and sepsis occur frequently. Severe obstruction may cause hydronephrosis, which is apparent as a palpable abdominal mass. A palpable midline mass in the lower abdomen is typical of a distended bladder. Voiding cystourethrography is the best radiographic study available to establish the diagnosis of posterior urethral valves. Treatment consists of destruction of the valves. Ref: Mc. Aninch J. W.

Mild exercise i. e., running for 1-2 minutes caused bronchodilation in asthmatic patients and can reduce wheezing (wheezing is produced due to obstruction in bronchi). Severe exercise will cause bronchoconstriction in viually all asthmatic patients and will aggravate wheezing. Prognosis of Asthma? The prognosis of young asthmatic children is generally good. Longitudinal studies indicate that in patients who have mild asthma the remission rate is about 50% i. e., 50% of them will be asthma free in their adulthood.

The systolic murmur is classified into: - Ejection systolic murmur Pansystolic murmur Pansystolic murmur is always abnormal no matter what is its intesity. Only three lesions produce pansystolic murmur i) VSD ii) MR iii) TR Ejection systolic murmur, on the other hand, may be organic or functional. an If ejection systolic murmur is associated with thrill, it is always organic. If ejection systolic murmur is more than grade III intensity -> It is organic. Grade III or less ejection systolic murmur of a functional type may be heard in anemia or high fever in otherwise normal children. 2) Diastolic murmur Presence of diastolic murmur always indicates the presence of organic heart disease. There are two exceptions. Severe hypertension -> Reduction of BP may cause an AR murmur to disappear. Anemia -> May result in delayed diastolic murmur across the tricuspid and mitral area. 3) Cyanosis Central cyanosis indicates the presence of heart disease if lung disease has been excluded. 4) CHF Presence of CHF indicates the presence of heart disease except in neonates and infants who get CHF from causes such as hypoglycemia and anemia. B) Minor criteria Systolic murmur less than grade III in intensity. Abnormal second heart sound Abnormal S2 always indicates the presence of heart disease. It has been included as a minor criterion only because auscultation is an individual and subjective finding 3) Abnormal ECG The main value of ECG lies in determining the: - Mean QRS axis Right or left atrial hypertrophy Right or left ventricular hypertrophy 4) Abnormal X-ray If there is cardiomegaly in a good inspiratory film, it is highly suggestive for the presence of heart disease. 5) Abnormal BP",

A patent ductus aeriosus (PDA) occurs when the ductus aeriosus fails to close after bih. With a PDA, congestive heart failure (CHF) can occur because of chronic left heart volume overload. In patients with death related to PDA, CHF is the most common cause. Development of right-left shunt is also a poor prognostic indicator. Risk factors for PDA include maternal rubella infection, bih at high altitude, premature bih, female sex, and genetic factors. In infants born at less than 28 weeks of gestation, there is 60% incidence of PDA. Impoant Note In the fetus, the ductus aeriosus is maintained open by low aerial oxygen content and placental prostaglandins. Ref: Manual of Cardiovascular Medicine edited by Brian P. Griffin, Eric J.

Heavy proteinuria( more than 1g/metre square/day) is the underlying abnormality leading to hypoalbuminemia ( serum albumin below 2. 5g/dl). The resultant fall in plasma oncotic pressure leads to interstitial edema and hypovolemia. This stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and ADH secretion that enhances sodium and water retention. Hypoalbuminemia also induces hepatic synthesis of beta-lipoproteins resulting in hypercholesterolemia. Main cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is associated with minimal change disease.

Lipiduria (lipids in urine) can also occur, but is not essential for the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Hyponatremia also occurs with a low fractional sodium excretion.

        "exp": "ASD is associated with an enlarged right atrium & right ventricle to accommodate large volume of blood. The left atrium is not enlarged because it decompresses itself by shunting blood to the right atrium at a minor difference in pressure. The left atrium may enlarge once Eisenmenger's syndrome develops and a reversal of shunt is seen across the defect. All congenital heart diseases given in option cause left to right shunt. Size of left atrium in left to right shunts In left to right shunt, blood enters from left side of heart (Lt. atrium, Lt ventricle or aorta) to right side of heart (Rt atrium, Rt ventricle or pulmonary artery) depending on the site of abnormal communication. This blood then flows through pulmonary circulation and again enters the left atrium. The path of blood is then depending on the defect. In all these defects, left atrium recieves larger volume of blood which comes through pulmonary circulation -> Blood from right side of heart plus some blood from left side of heart because of shunt enter into pulmonary circulation and then into left atrium. So left atrium recieve blood volume larger than normal. But the effect of larger volume on left atrium will be different in ASD and other left to right shunts. 1). In ASD Left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, but fortunate for the left atrium, it also has an extra exit for blood, i. e., septal defect. So, larger volume of blood is decompressed through left atrium. Amount, which is normally exits through AV valve (mitral valve) into left ventricle. Extra amount, which left atrium recieves, exits through septal defect into right atrium. 2) Other left to right shunts (VSD, FDA, Aortopulmonary window). In these defects also, left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, But there is no extra exit. So, left atrium can pump out only normal amount of blood through mitral valve, and extra volume remains in the left atrium -> Volume over load -> Left atrial enlargement.",

Prostaglandin inhibitors Management of PDA o After bih ductus arieriosus constricts within a few hours producing functional closure. o Permanent anatomic closure follows in the next 10-21 days due to extensive intimal thickening. o The mechanism producing the initial constriction is not completely understood, but the increase in aerial 02 tension plays an impoant role. o One more factor which helps in closure of the ductus aeriosus is the decrease in concentration of prostaglandins at the time of bih o In the intrauterine period the concentration of prostaglandin PGF2 a is very high. This prostaglandin has a vasodilatory effect which keeps the ductus open. o The synthesis of these vasodilator is inhibited at bih by the inhibition of the enzyme cycloxygenase at bih. o Cycloxygenase is an impoant enzyme in the synthetic pathway of prostaglandin. o In many premature infants the ductus fail to close spontaneously. In these cases the closure can be produced by infusion of drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase. o Indomethacin is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme cvclooxvgenase. o Indomethacin is routinely used to close the PDA in premature infants, it does not close the PDA of full term infants or children. The success of indomethacin therapy is as high as 80-90% in premature infants with bih weight over 1200 g. o If indomethacin is not successful and the ductus remains hemodynamically significant, surgical ligation should be performed without hesitation. o Recent studies from Europe indicate that ibuprofen may be as effective as indomethacin for the medical closure of preterm PDA.",

        "exp": "Ans. is `d' i. e., Bronchiolitis obliterans Bronchiolitis obliterans o Bronchiolitis obliterans. is a rare chronic lung disease of the bronchioles and smaller airways. o Bronchiolitis obliterans most commonly occurs inpediatric population after respiratory infections (i. e. adenovirus, mycoplasma, measles, influenza, peussis). o Other causes include connective tissue disease (i. e. juvenile rheumatoid ahritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, scleroderma) o Bronchiolitis occurs in all age groups. Pathogenesis o After the initial insult, inflammation affecting terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts may result in obliteration of the airway lumen. o Epithelial damage resulting in abnormal repair is characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans. Complete or paial obstruction of the airway lumen may result in air trapping or atelactasis. Clinical manifestations Cough, fever, cyanosis and respiratory distress followed by initial improvement may be the initial signs of bronchiolitis obliterans. o Progression of the disease may ensue with increasing dyspnoea, cough, sputum production and wheezing. o Chest radiographs may be relatively normal compared with the extent of physical findings but may demonstrate hyperluscency and patchy infiltrates (occasionally, a swyer James syndrome, i. e. a unilateral hyperluscent lung has developed). o Pulmonary function tests demonstrate varaible findings but typically shows signs of airway obstruction. o Ventilation perfusion scan shows a typical motheaten appearance of multiple matched defects in ventilation and perfusion. o CT scan demonstrates patchy areas of hyperluscency. o Open lung biopsy or transbronchial biopsy remains the best means of establishing the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans. Treatment o No definite therapy exists for bronchiolitis obliterans. o Administration of coicosteroids may be beneficial About other options Follicular bronchitis o It is a lymphoproliferative lung disorder characterized the presence of lymphoid follicles, coursing along the airways (bronchi or bronchioles) o It is rare in children. o Although the cause is unknown, an infectious aetiology has been proposed. o Onset of symptoms generally occurs by 6 weeks of age and peaks between 6 and 18 months. o Cough, moderate fever and fine crackles are common clinical findings. o Fine crackles generally, persist over time and recurrence of symptoms is common. o Chest radiographs may be relatively benign initially but evolve into the typical interstitial pattern. o Pulmonary function tests show restrictive pattern o Chest CT shows fine reticular pattern. Open lung biopsy is used to make definitive diagnosis. Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis o This is a rare disorder. o Although the underlying cause of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is unknown, the disease is characterized by the formation of lamellar concretions of calcium phosphate or \"microlith\", within the alveoli, creating a classic pattern on the radiograph. o Chest radiography typically reveal bilateral infiltrates with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance. o Although the mean age at the time of diagnosis is in the mid 30s the onset of the disease can occur during childhood. When symptomatic, individuals with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis usually complain of dyspnoea on exeion and non productive cough. o Physical examinations of the lungs may reveal fine inspiratory crackles and diminished breath sounds. Clubbing occurs, although this is usually a more advanced sign. o Children are often asymptomatic on initial presentation. Diagnosis o Chest radiography typically reveals b/L infiltrate with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance or \"Sandstorm\" appearance. o CT scan shows diffuse micronodular calcified densities. o Open lung biopsy reveals laminated calcific ioncretions within the alceoli.",

Shock is an acute dramatic syndrome characterized by inadequate circulatory supply of oxygen so that the metabolic demands of vital organs and tissues are not met. Shock has been categorized into series of recognizable stage:? Compensated Uncompensated Irreversible An initial insult triggers shock, thus disrupting blood flow to end organs leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. The body's compensatory mechanism is initiated to maintain perfusion to vital organs. If treatment is not introduced during this period, decompensated shock develops causing tissue damage that leads to multisystem organ dysfunction and death. Compensatory shock In the early phases of shock, multiple compensatory physiologic mechanisms act to maintain blood pressure and preserve tissue perfusion. - Blood pressure remains normal, initially, because of peripheral vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance. - Thus hypotension occurs late and is more a characteristic of uncompensated stage of shock. - Patients in compensated shock have relatively normal cardiac output and normal blood pressures but they have alteration in microcirculation that increase flow to some organs and reduce flow to other. - In infants compensatory increases in cardiac output are achieved primarily by \"tachycardia\" rather than by increase in stroke volume. - Heart rates of 190-210/min are common in infants with compensated shock. - On the other hand in older patients cardiac contractility (stroke volume) and (heart rate) increase to improve cardiac output.",

Reading disorder Mathematic disorder Disorder in written expression Another subtyping is language-based LD commonly known as dyslexia (problem in reading, spelling and written expression) and nonverbal LD (deficits in arthmetic and spacial cognition). Dyslexia is the most common type of learning disability. Children with dyslexia have a problem in reading, spelling and written expression. The important clues to dyslexia in school-age children include delayed language, trouble rhymic words, mispronunciation, hesitation, word-finding difficulties and poor spellings with the presence of letter reversal. Reading is slow, inaccurate and laboured.

Patient is also having shock, so she requires treatment of shock and intussusception. Diagnosis of intussusception The clinical history and physical findings are usually sufficiently typical for diagnosis. Plain abdominal radiographs may show a density in the area of the intussusception. A barium enema shows a filling defect or cupping in the head of barium where its advance is obstructed by the intussusceptum. A central linear column of barium may be visible in the compressed lumen of the intussusceptum, and a thin rim of barium may be seen traped around the invaginating intestine in the folds of mucosa within the intussuscipiens (coiled-spring sign), especially after evacuation. Retrogression of the intussusceptum under the pressure of the enema and gaseous distention of the small intestine from obstruction are also useful radiographic signs. Ileoileal intussusuception is usually not demonstrable by barium enema but is suspected because of gaseous disten\u00adtion of the intestine above the lesion. The use of \"air\" enemas in the diagnosis and treatment of intussusception has supplanted hydrostatic reduction. Reflux of air into the terminal ileum and the disappearance of the mass at the ileocecal valve document successful reduction. Air reduction is associated with fewer complications and lower radia\u00adtion exposure than traditional hydrostatic techniques. Ultrasonography is a sensitive diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of intussusception. Treatment of Intussusception The child should be first stabilized. A tube should be passed into the stomach through nose (nasogastric tube). An intravenous line should be placed and fluids should be given to prevent dehydration. Reduction of an acute intussusception is an emergency procedure and performed immediately after diagnosis in preparation for possible surgery. The reduction can be achieved by installation of barium, saline or air. \"In patients with prolonged intussusception with signs of shock, peritoneal irritation, intestinal perforation or pneumatosis intestinal, reduction (with barium, saline or air) should not be attempted\". In the above cases and in cases where reduction by barium/saline/air fails, surgery is required, i. e., manual operative reduction. If the manual operative reduction is not possible or the bowel is not viable, resection of the intussusception is necessary, with an end to end anastomosis. Treatment of shock (e. g. O2 IV fluid etc) should be given first if it is present. About option a & b As the patient is in shock, reduction by air or barium is contraindicated. However, a barium enema can be used as a diagnostic modality.",

        "exp": "Bronchiolitis obliterans Bronchiolitis obliterans. are a rare chronic lung disease of the bronchioles and smaller airways Bronchiolitis obliterans most commonly occurs in a pediatric population after respiratory infections (i. e. adenovirus, mycoplasma, measles, influenza, pertussis). Other causes include connective tissue disease (i. e. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma) Bronchiolitis occurs in all age groups. Pathogenesis After the initial insult, inflammation affecting terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts may result in obliteration of the airway lumen. Epithelial damage resulting in abnormal repair is characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans. Complete or partial obstruction of the airway lumen may result in air trapping or atelectasis. Clinical manifestations A cough, fever, cyanosis and respiratory distress followed by initial improvement may be the initial signs of bronchiolitis obliterans. Progression of the disease may ensue with increasing dyspnoea, cough, sputum production and wheezing. Chest radiographs may be relatively normal compared with the extent of physical findings but may demonstrate hyper lucency and patchy infiltrates (occasionally, a lawyer James syndrome, i. e. a unilateral hyper lucency lung has developed). Pulmonary function tests demonstrate variable findings but typically shows signs of airway obstruction. Ventilation-perfusion scan shows a typical motheaten appearance of multiple matched defects in ventilation and perfusion. CT scan demonstrates patchy areas of hyper lucency. Open lung biopsy or transbronchial biopsy remains the best means of establishing the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans. Treatment No definite therapy exists for bronchiolitis obliterans. Administration of corticosteroids may be beneficial About other options Follicular bronchitis It is a lymphoproliferative lung disorder characterized the presence of lymphoid follicles, coursing along the airways (bronchi or bronchioles) It is rare in children. Although the cause is unknown, an infectious aetiology has been proposed. The onset of symptoms generally occurs by 6 weeks of age and peaks between 6 and 18 months. A cough, moderate fever and fine crackles are common clinical findings. Fine crackles generally, persist over time and recurrence of symptoms is common. Chest radiographs may be relatively benign initially but evolve into the typical interstitial pattern. Pulmonary function tests show a restrictive pattern Chest CT shows a fine reticular pattern. An open lung biopsy is used to make a definitive diagnosis. Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis This is a rare disorder. Although the underlying cause of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is unknown, the disease is characterized by the formation of lamellar concretions of calcium phosphate or \"inicrolith\", within the alveoli, creating a classic pattern on the radiograph. Chest radiography typically reveals bilateral infiltrates with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance. Although the mean age at the time of diagnosis is in the mid-30s the onset of the disease can occur during childhood. When symptomatic, individuals with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis usually complain of dyspnoea on exertion and non-productive cough. Physical examinations of the lungs may reveal fine inspiratory crackles and diminished breath sounds. Clubbing occurs, although this is usually a more advanced sign. Children are often asymptomatic on initial presentation. Diagnosis Chest radiography typically reveals b/L infiltrate with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance or \"Sandstorm\" appearance. CT scan shows diffuse micronodular calcified densities. Open lung biopsy reveals laminated calcific ioncretions within the alveoli.",

Rest of them either present late in childhood or do not give the symptoms. Polyhydramnios and decreased fetal movements can occur in any neuromuscular disorder which present during intrauterine life. Lets see each option one by one. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) SMA is a degenerative disease of motor neurons that begin in fetal life and continue to progress in infancy and childhood. The cardinal features are: Hypotonia Generalized weakness Absent tendon stretch reflexes Involvement of tongue face and jaw muscle but sparing of extraocular muscle and sphincters. Congenital myotonia Congenital myotonia or myotonia congenita is a chloride channel defect of skeletal muscle. There are weakness and generalized hypertrophy of muscles. Its ruled out as Presents in early childhood (2-3 years age) Deep tendon reflexes are preserved. Congenital myasthenia It's a disease of neuromuscular junction similar to myasthenia gravis except that its not autoimmune but rather due to genetic mutations. It presents in infancy and childhood with symptom similar to myasthenia gravis. It can be ruled out as- It does not present in the intrauterine life (so does not cause polyhydramnios). DTRs are preserved Muscular dystrophies Muscular dystrophy refers to a group of hereditary progressive diseases. It includes Duchene's muscular dystrophy Limb-girdle Congenital myopathies Becker Myotonic dystrophic All of these except congenital myopathies are easily ruled out as they present in childhood age. some may rarely present in infancy but never in the intrauterine life. Congenital myopathies are the most difficult one to rule out. They present with hypotonia in infancy. It may also present in intrauterine life. The only reason I'm with 'Spinal muscular atrophy' is that congenital myopathy is a very rare disease.",

Permanent anatomic closure follows in the next 10-21 days due to extensive intimal thickening. The mechanism producing the initial constriction is not completely understood, but the increase in arterial 02 tension plays an important role. One more factor which helps in closure of the ductus arteriosus is the decrease in concentration of prostaglandins at the time of birth In the intrauterine period the concentration of prostaglandin PGF2 a is very high. This prostaglandin has a vasodilatory effect which keeps the ductus open. The synthesis of these vasodilator is inhibited at birth by the inhibition of the enzyme cycloxygenase at birth. Cycloxygenase is an important enzyme in the synthetic pathway of prostaglandin. In many premature infants the ductus fail to close spontaneously. In these cases the closure can be produced by infusion of drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase. Indomethacin is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase. Indomethacin is routinely used to close the PI A in premature infants, it does not close the P I. A of full term infants or children. The success of indomethacin therapy is as high as 80-90% in premature infants with birth weight over 1200 g. If indomethacin is not successful and the ductus remains hemodynamically significant, surgical ligation should be performed without hesitation. Recent studies from Europe indicate that ibuprofen may be as effective as indomethacin for the medical closure of pretenn PDA.",

The main purpose of growth surveillance is to identify those children who are not growing normally. Surveillance for physical growth can be done in the following ways. 1) Weight for age Measurement of weight and rate of gain in weight are the best single parameters for assessing physical growth. The weight should be carefully repeated at intervals: Birth -1 year -> Monthly The second-year -> Every two months 2-5 years -> Every 3 months These measurements when compared with the reference standards of the weight of children of the same age, the trend of growth becomes obvious. Weight for age can be used to classify malnutrition and determine its prevalence. 80 % of the median weight for age of the reference is cut off point below which children should be considered malnourished. 2) Weight for age Height is a stable measurement of growth as opposed to body weight. Whereas weight reflects only the present health status of the child, height indicates the events in the past also. Low height for age: This is also known as nutritional stunting or dwarfing. It reflects past or chronic malnutrition. The cutoff point commonly taken for the diagnosis of stunting is 90 percent of the united states NCHS height for age. 3) Weight for height Weight in relation to height is now considered more important than weight alone. It helps to determine whether a child is within range of normal weight for his height. Low weight for height This is also known as nutritional wasting or emaciation (Acute malnutrition). It is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. A child who is less than 70% of the expected weight for height is classed as severely wasted. 4) Head and chest circumference Chest circumference At birth -> Less than 2 cm from head circumference 6-9 months -> Two measurements become equal > 6-9 months -> Overtakes head circumference In severely malnourished children this overtaking may be delayed by 3 to 4 years.",

The red cells which escape death in bone marrow are prone to splenic sequestration and destruction due to cell membrane damage and decreased deformability, leading to extravascular hemolysis. The second mechanism is more important in producing anemia.

Poor impulse control and decreased self-inhibitory capacity Motor overactivity and motor restlessness. Dyslexia is characterized by an unexpected difficulty in reading in children and adults who otherwise possess the intelligence, motivation, and oppounities to learn considered necessary for accurate and fluent reading. Dyslexia is the most common and most comprehensively studied of the learning disabilities",

Combination of these measurements have been suggested sometimes to distinguish 'type' of malnutrition. For example, water low proposed that weight/height allows one to distinguish between children who have suffered malnutrition in the past front those who are currently experiencing malnutrition. In chronic malnutrition, the child is stunted i. e. his weight for age and height for age are low. Therefore, weight for height cannot diagnose chronic malnutrition as chronic malnutrition affects both weight gain (weight for age) and linear growth (height for age) -> Weight deficit is proportionate to the deficit in height. In acute malnutrition however his height for age is appropriate but he is wasted (low weight for height and age). Thus weight and height measurements together are useful to understand the dynamics of malnutrition, distinguishing between current malnutrition and long-term or chronic malnutrition. Wasting (deficit in weight for height) usually signifies acute onset malnutrition. Stunting (deficit in height for age) usually signifies a chronic course of malnutrition. Wasting and stunting -> Acute on chronic malnutrition. Underweight (low weight for age) -> Combined indicator to reflect both acute and chronic malnutrition",

A) Left to right shunts. (ASD, VSD, PDA) B) Obstructive lesions (PS, AS, Coarctation of aoa). A) Left to right shunts Patients with left to right shunts have following features:? 1. Frequent respiratory tract infection --4 Because pulmonary circulation is overloaded which may result in pulmonary edema, CHF and infection. 2. No cyanosis --> Most of the blood is in pulmonary circulation. So there is no impairment in oxygenation of blood. 3. Precardial buldge --> Frequent chest infections with tachypnea causes the soft rib cage being drawn inward at the diaphragmetic attachments of the ribs. This combined with cardioamegaly gives them a precordial buldge. 4. Hyperkinetic precordium 5. Delayed diastolic murmur in tricuspid or mitral area --> Due to increased flow through these areas depending on the type of CHDs. 6. Cardiomegaly with plethoric pulmonary vasculature on chest X-ray Due to increased flow through pulmonary circulation (plethoric lung) there is increased volume overload to left side of heart ---> Cardiomegaly. B) Obstructive lesions o Obstructive congenital diseases have following features. 1) Absence offrequent chest infection --> Pulmonary circulation is not overloaded. 2) Absence of cyanosis ---> No defect in pulmonary oxygenation and there is no shunt where aerial and venous blood can mix. 3) Absence of precardial buldge There is no chest infection or Cardiomegaly. 4) Heaving (forcible) cardiac impulse --> Obstructive lesions cause concentric hyperophy of ventricles that produce forcible contraction. 5) Systolic thrill due to systolic ejection murmur --4 When hyperophied ventricles forcibly pump the blood through stenotic pulmonary or aoic valve, systolic thrill and systolic ejection murmur are produced. 6). Absence of delayed diastolic murmur in mitral or tricuspid area --> Blood flow through these area is not increased. 7). Presence of delayed corresponding second sound (A2 in AS and P2 in PS) --> Because prolonged flow through these area results in delayed closure of that valve. 8). Normal sized heart and pulmonary vasculature in chest x-ray --> There is concentric hyperophy, i. e., hyperophy without dilatation. So, heart size is normal on x-ray.",

        "exp": "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked condition characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and repeated infections. Affected children may present with bleeding and often succumb to complications of bleeding, infection, or lymphoreticular malignancy. The platelets are small, have a shoened half-life, and appear to be deficient in surface sialophorin (CD43). Splenectomy can correct the thrombocytopenia, but not the immune defect. Serum IgM is usually decreased, while IgE is frequently increased. Mutations in the Wiskott-Aldrich serum protein (WASP) gene on the sho arm of the X chromosome are responsible for this disease. Acquired hypogammaglobulinemia is a disease of adults characterized by normal numbers of B cells but low immunoglobulin production. Di. George syndrome is a developmental malformation leading to thymic aplasia and, sometimes, hypoparathyroidism.

In the adult, gas exchange occurs in the lungs, while in the fetus placenta provides the exchange of gases and nutrients. The course of fetal circulation A) Blood returning to the heart Blood oxygenated in the placenta returns by way of the umbilical vein, which enter the fetus at the umbilicus and course through to join the portal vein. The ductus venous is a bypass shunt between the portal vein and IVC. Most of the umbilical venous blood shunt through the ductus venosus to the IVC. Blood from IVC (which carries the blood drained from lower extremities, umbilical veins, hepatic veins and renal veins) enters the right atrium. On reaching the right atrium, about 1/3rd of total inferior vena caval return of blood enters the left atrium through formen oval. The rest two third mixes with the venous return from SVC (which carries the blood drained from head, neck and upper limbs) to enter the right ventricles. B) Blood coming out of the heart 1. Right side The right ventricle pumps out the blood into pulmonary trunk very small amount of this blood enters the pulmonary circulation because the lungs are collapsed and pulmonary vascular resistance is high. Most of this blood passes to descending aorta through ductus arteriosus, a shunt between pulmonary trunk and descending Aorta. The descending aorta carries blood to umbilicus through the umbilical artery, for oxygenation. Descending aorta also supplies the blood to lower limbs, kidney and abdominal viscera. 2. Left side The left ventricle pumps blood into the ascending aorta for distribution in the coronary circulation, head and upper limbs.",
