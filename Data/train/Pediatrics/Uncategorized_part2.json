Glycogen storage diseases Glycogen storage diseases result from a hereditary deficiency of one of the enzymes involved in the synthesis or sequential degradation of glycogen. Clinical features depend on the type of enzyme deficiency and organ involvement. Glycogen storage diseases can be divided into:- 1) Hepatic form (Liver glycogenolysis) The liver is the key player in glycogen metabolism. It contains enzymes that synthesize glycogen for storage and ultimately break it down into free glucose, which is then released into the blood. So, An inherited deficiency of hepatic enzymes that are involved in glycogen metabolism leads to i) Storage of glycogen in liver -> Hepatomegaly. ii) Reduction in blood glucose -> Hypoglycemia. Examples of liver glycogenoses are - Type I glycogenosis -> Glucose - 6 - phosphatase deficiency (Von Gierke disease). Type III glycogenosis -> Debranching enzyme def Type IV glycogenesis -> Branching enzyme def Type VI glycogenosis -> Liver phosphorylase def 2) Myopathic form (Muscular glycogenoses) In skeletal muscle, as opposed to the liver, glycogen is used predominantly as a source of energy. This is derived from glycolysis, which leads ultimately to the formation of lactate. So, enzyme deficiency leads to - Glycogen deposition in muscle Muscle cramp after exercise The exercise-induced rise in blood lactate levels owing to block in glycolysis There may be myoglobinuria Examples are - Type V glycogenosis -> phosphorylase deficiency (Mc. Ardle disease). Type VII glycogenosis -> phosphofructokinase def 3) Miscellaneous types Associated with glycogen storage in many organs and death in early life. Examples - i) Type II glycogenosis -> Acid maltase deficiency (Pompe's disease)",

This condition is associated with a defect in the ability of hepatocytes to secrete conjugated bilirubin into the bile. The conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a result of defective endogenous and exogenous transfer of anionic conjugates from hepatocytes into the bile. Pigment deposition in lysosomes causes the liver to turn black. Other causes of conjugated/direct hyperbilirubinemia: Hepatocellular diseases: - Hepatitis: Neonatal idiopathic hepatitis Viral (Hepatitis B, C, TORCH infections) Bacterial (E. colt, urinary tract infections) - Total parenteral nutrition - Hepatic ischemia (post-ischemic damage) - Erythroblastosis fetalis (late, \"Inspissated Bile Syndrome\") Metabolic disorders: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Galactosemia, tyrosinemia, fructosemia Glycogen storage disorders Cystic fibrosis Biliary tree abnormalities: - Extrahepatic biliary atresia: In first 2 weeks, unconjugated bilirubin predominates; elevated conjugated bilirubin is late. - Paucity of bile ducts - Choledochal cyst - Bile plug syndrome Causes of unconjugated/indirect hyperbilirubinemia: Increased lysis of RBCs (i. e., increased hemoglobin release) - Isoimmunization (blood group incompatibility: Rh, ABO and minor blood groups) - RBC enzyme defects (e. g., G6. PD deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency) - RBC structural abnormalities (hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis) - Infection (sepsis, urinary tract infections) - Sequestered blood (e. g., cephalohematoma, bruising, intracranial hemorrhage) - Neonatal Jaundice - Polycythemia - Shoened life span of fetal RBCs Decreased hepatic uptake and conjugation of bilirubin - Immature glucuronyl transferase activity in all newborns: term infants have 1% of adult activity, preterm infants have 0. 1%. - Gilbe Syndrome - Crigler Najjar Syndrome (Non-hemolytic Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia): inherited conjugation defect (very rare) - Breastmilk Jaundice (pregnanediol inhibits glucuronyl transferase activity) Increased enterohepatic reabsorption - Breastfeeding jaundice (due to dehydration from inadequate milk supply)",

Coming back to question Sorry guys i could not find any reference which clearly mention the answer of this question. o According to me the best answer is 4 months because renal involvement may be seen up to 3 months after the onset of other symptoms (examiner is asking about the renal involvement after onset of disease, not after the onset of other symptoms). \"Renal manifestations usually sta at the onset or within 3 months of the onset of other symptoms\" - Pediatric nephrology o Other symptoms, e. g. rash, will also take some time to appear after the onset of disease.

Pink color (look at tougue and lips) Term gestation (delivery between 37-42 weeks of pregnancy). o If all signs are positive no active resuscitation is required. o If any of the 5 signs is absent, baby requires resuscitation. o The baby should be placed under the heat source (radiant warmer) and subjected to a set of intervention known as initial steps. Initial steps of resuscitation 1. Positioning The neonate should be placed on her back or side with the neck slightly extended. This can be achieved by putting a rolled blanket or towel under the shoulders, elevating them 3/4 or 1 inch off the mattress. 2. Suctioning The mouth and nose should be suctioned The mouth is suctioned first to ensure that there is nothing for the infant to aspirate when the nose is suctioned. One should not inse the catheter very deep in mouth or nose for suction -4 Stimulation of posterior pharynx during the first few minutes after bih can produce a vagal responce, causing severe bradycardia or apnea. 3. Dry, stimulate and reposition After suctioning, the baby should be dried by using pre-warmed linen to prevent heat loss. A brief tactile stimulation in the form of flicking the soles or rubbing the back may be provided in case of non-establishment of good respiratory effos. 4. Free flow of oxygen If the baby continues to be depressed, provide free flow of oxygen using a facemask. After providing initial steps, the baby should be evaluated for three signs?

        "exp": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common life-threatening emergency of the GIT in the newborn period. Management of necrotizing enterocolitis Medical treatment of NEC include Cessation of feeding Nasogastric decompression Administration of i. v. fluids Systemic antibiotic against both gram +ve as well as gram -ye bacteria (after taking samples for blood culture). Ventilation should be assisted if distention is contributing to hypoxia. Early surgery consultation Surgical interventions in NEC Evidence of perforation is an indication for laparotomy and resection of necrotic bowel. Failure to respond to medical management, a single fixed bowel loop, erythema of the abdominal wall and a palpable mass are additional indications of exploratory laparotomy, resection of necrotic bowel and external ostomy diversion. Peritoneal drainage may be helpful for patients with peritonitis who are too unstable to withstand surgery. It is more successful in patients with isolated intestinal perforation. In many patients, no further surgical procedure is required. Peritoneal drainage is performed under local anaesthesia. Alpenrose drain is placed in the right lower quadrant and permitted to drain peritoneal contents and decompress the abdomen. This procedure is employed predominantly in infants less than 1000g who have severe SIRS and are viewed as too unstable to be transported or to undergo laparotomy. In experienced hands, one-third of the patients require only drain placement. A primary anastomosis at the time of initial surgery is indicated in patients with limited localized disease who have no distal bowel involvement and in patients who have demonstrated a walled-off perforation who are no longer manifesting the SIRS. From this discussion, we choose the answer to be peritoneal drainage because: Patients are on a ventilator (too unstable). Surgery for NEC is resection and creation of an ileostomy, which is not given in the options. Primary anastomosis is done only in stable patients with walled-off perforation.",

The papules may join together to form large areas of palpable purpura or ecchymoses (bruises). Gums may swell and become red, soft and spongy. Any slight friction may cause the gums to bleed. Often this results in poor oral hygiene and dental diseases. Bleeding in the joints causes extreme discomfo and pain. Joints may be swollen and tender and the pain can be so severe that patients cannot walk. Patients may complain of dryness, irritation, light intolerance, transient visual blurring and stickiness. Haemorrhaging (bleeding) beneath the conjunctiva and within the optic nerve sheath may also occur. Anemia develops in 75% of patients as a result of blood loss into tissue, altered absorptions and metabolism of iron and folate, gastrointestinal bleeding and intravascular haemolysis.

        "exp": "Patent ductus aeriosus represents persistent patency of the vessel. The ductus aeriosus usually closes within 2 or 3 days after bih and becomes the ligamentum aeriosum. Constriction of the ductus postnatally involves a complex interaction of increased paial pressure of oxygen, decreased circulating prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), decreased PGE2 ductal receptors, and decreased pressure within the ductus. Subsequent vessel-wall hypoxia of the ductus promotes fuher closure through inhibition of prostaglandin and nitric oxide within the ductal wall. For premature infants, treatment with indomethacin, a prostaglandin inhibitor, is usually the first-line therapy. Ibuprofen has achieved closure rates equivalent to those of indomethacin with less renal toxicity. When PDA fails to close with indomethacin or for term infants with a persistent PDA, surgical or interventional closure is recommended. Ref: Brown D. W., Fulton D. R. (2011). Chapter 83.

The patient has developed normally in all other aspects and will be staing kindergarden in three months. Both her mother and father are extremely frustrated and have been losing sleep, as the girl wakes up at night 4 to 5 times per week. Physical examination is unremarkable.

Most children have achieved normal bladder control by that time, girls earlier than boys. At age six years, 10% have enuresis. It is impoant to rule out other possible causes of enuresis, but usually, investigation will reveal only normal results. It is believed that up to 50% of cases are caused by delayed maturation of the nervous system or intrinsic myo neurogenic bladder dysfunction. 30% are of psychologic origin and 20% are secondary to more obvious organic disease. The bladder capacity of bed wetters and non-bedwetters is the same. The difference is that the non-bed wetters are able to hold their urine in their bladders throughout the night. When compared with normal children, the majority of children with bedwetting problems score just as well on tests of intelligence and school achievement. These children are no more likely to suffer from permanent neurological abnormalities, poor school achievement, low IQs, or severe learning disability. It is true that bed-wetting children are more likely to get urinary tract infections if their personal hygiene is poor; it is not true that such infections are the main cause of bedwetting.",

Bronchiolitis during infancy. Sensitization to allergenes (dust mite, animal danders, cockroaches and alternaria) during childhood. Passive smoking Response of Asthmatic patients to exercise? Mild exercise i. e., running for 1-2 minutes caused bronchodilation in asthmatic patients and can reduce wheezing (wheezing is produced due to obstruction in bronchi). Severe exercise will cause bronchoconstriction in viually all asthmatic patients and will aggravate wheezing. Prognosis of Asthma? The prognosis of young asthmatic children is generally good. Longitudinal studies indicate that in patients who have mild asthma the remission rate is about 50% i. e., 50% of them will be asthma free in their adulthood. In severe asthma characterized by chronic steroid dependent disease, the remission rate is very less. About 95% of them will develop into asthmatic adults.",

The greatest risk associated with hyperbilirubinemia is the development of kernicterus (bilirubin encephalopathy) at high indirect serum bilirubin levels. The level of serum bilirubin associated with kernicterus is dependent in pa on the cause of the jaundice. Kernicterus has developed when bilirubin levels exceed 30 mg/dL, although the range is wide (21-50 mg/dL). Its onset is usually in the 1st wk of life, but it may_be delayed to the 2nd-3rd wk. Kernicterus develops at lower bilirubin levels in preterm infants and in the presence of asphyxia, intraventricular hemorrhage, hemolysis, or drugs that displace bilirubin from albumin. The exact serum bilirubin level that is harmful for VLBW infants is unclear. Kernicterus does occur in patients with breast milk jaundice but is very uncommon. The surface of the brain is usually pale yellow. On cutting, ceain regions are characteristically stained yellow by unconjugated bilirubin Ove neurologic signs have a grave prognosis; 75% or more of such infants die, and 80% of affected survivors have bilateral choreoathetosis with involuntary muscle spasms.

Heavy proteinuria( more than 1g/metre square/day) is the underlying abnormality leading to hypoalbuminemia ( serum albumin below 2. 5g/dl). The resultant fall in plasma oncotic pressure leads to interstitial oedema and hypovolemia. This stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and ADH secretion that enhances sodium and water retention. Hypoalbuminemia also induces hepatic synthesis of beta-lipoproteins resulting in hypercholesterolemia. The main cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is associated with minimal change disease. Other causes include amyloidosis, vasculitis, SLE, postinfectious glomerulonephritis, and hepatitis B nephropathy. Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome:- MCNS accounts for 80% cases of nephrotic syndrome. Electron microscopy shows non-specific obliteration of epithelial foot processes. Immunofluorescence studies show deposits of occasional mesangial IgM. Lab findings- urine examination shows heavy proteinuria. Hyaline and granular casts are present. Serum albumin is low. Hypercholesterolemia imparts a milky appearance to plasma. Blood urea and creatinine values within normal range. Blood levels if IgG low and IgM elevated. Low serum calcium level.

The systolic murmur is classified into: - Ejection systolic murmur Pansystolic murmur Pansystolic murmur is always abnormal no matter what is its intesity. Only three lesions produce pansystolic murmur i) VSD ii) MR iii) TR Ejection systolic murmur, on the other hand, may be organic or functional. an If ejection systolic murmur is associated with thrill, it is always organic. If ejection systolic murmur is more than grade III intensity -> It is organic. Grade III or less ejection systolic murmur of a functional type may be heard in anemia or high fever in otherwise normal children. 2) Diastolic murmur Presence of diastolic murmur always indicates the presence of organic heart disease. There are two exceptions. Severe hypertension -> Reduction of BP may cause an AR murmur to disappear. Anemia -> May result in delayed diastolic murmur across the tricuspid and mitral area. 3) Cyanosis Central cyanosis indicates the presence of heart disease if lung disease has been excluded. 4) CHF Presence of CHF indicates the presence of heart disease except in neonates and infants who get CHF from causes such as hypoglycemia and anemia. B) Minor criteria Systolic murmur less than grade III in intensity. Abnormal second heart sound Abnormal S2 always indicates the presence of heart disease. It has been included as a minor criterion only because auscultation is an individual and subjective finding 3) Abnormal ECG The main value of ECG lies in determining the: - Mean QRS axis Right or left atrial hypertrophy Right or left ventricular hypertrophy 4) Abnormal X-ray If there is cardiomegaly in a good inspiratory film, it is highly suggestive for the presence of heart disease. 5) Abnormal BP",

Ecchymoses, muscle hematomas, prolonged bleeding following trauma and hemahroses also are characteristic. PT and a. PTT are normal in factor XIII deficiency.

AT deficiency was first described in the late 1960s in patients with severe pulmonary disease. Sholy thereafter it was discovered to be a cause of neonatal liver disease, and now it is known to be a cause of liver disease in infancy, early childhood, adolescence, and in adults. The natural history of liver disease in al. AT deficiency is quite variable. Many individuals with the ZZ genotype never develop disease throughout their entire lives. a1. AT deficiency becomes apparent in adults because of screening for liver disease in individuals who have liver function test abnormalities. The only hint to diagnosis may be coexistent lung disease at a relatively young age or a family history of liver and/or lung disease. Diagnosis is established by determining a reduced serum level of al. AT as well as the performance of a1. AT genotyping. Liver biopsy in a1. AT disease shows characteristic PAS-positive diastase-resistant globules in the periphery of the hepatic lobule. Treatment Treatment of a1. AT is nonspecific and suppoive. Liver transplantation is curative. Recombinant AT administered IV has been used in patients with chronic lung disease due to 1. AT deficiency but is of no benefit in patients with a1.

In its most severe form, the cystic kidneys are nonfunctional in utero, and, therefore, newborns can have Potter facies and other complications of oligohydramnios. In infancy and childhood, kidney enlargement by cysts may initially be recognized by abdominal palpation of renal masses. Hypertension is an early problem. The rate of the progression of renal insufficiency varies, as does growth failure and other complications of chronic renal failure. Two genes (ADPKD1 and ADPKD2) account for 80% and 10% of cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, respectively.

A patent ductus aeriosus (PDA) occurs when the ductus aeriosus fails to close after bih. With a PDA, congestive heart failure (CHF) can occur because of chronic left hea volume overload. In patients with death related to PDA, CHF is the most common cause. Development of right-left shunt is also a poor prognostic indicator.

Because oxygenated blood is not available for systemic circulation, survival depends on the mixing available between the two circulation. So, patients with TGA can be divided into: - TGA with intact ventricular septum TGA with VSD. i) TGA with intact septum The mixing of blood depends on atrial communication. Most of the time atrial communication is a patent foramen ovale. As patent foramen ovale is very small communication, mixing of oxygenated blood with deoxygenated blood is inadequate -> Patients are symptomatic and cyanotic at birth, and CHF may develop during first week. ii) TGA with VSD Presence of VSD of adequate size results in good mixing of blood. a Patients become symptomatic, at 4-8 weeks when fetal pulmonary vasculature regresses maximally -> CHF develops at this time. The failing left ventricle and large pulmonary blood flow cause increase in left atrial pressure -> T back pressure Pulmonary venous hypertension and pulmonary plethora.

Heavy proteinuria( more than 1g/metre square/day) is the underlying abnormality leading to hypoalbuminemia ( serum albumin below 2. 5g/dl). The resultant fall in plasma oncotic pressure leads to interstitial edema and hypovolemia. This stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and ADH secretion that enhances sodium and water retention. Hypoalbuminemia also induces hepatic synthesis of beta-lipoproteins resulting in hypercholesterolemia. Main cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is associated with minimal change disease. Other causes include amyloidosis, vasculitis, SLE, postinfectious glomerulonephritis, and hepatitis B nephropathy. Steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome:- MCNS accounts for 80% cases of nephrotic syndrome. Electron microscopy shows non-specific obliteration of epithelial foot processes.

If monitoring is available, oxygen is given as appropriate. Thermal control. Baby's body temperature should be kept in the normal range of 36. 5-37. 2\u00b0C (sometimes the babies become hyperpyrexic). Correction of shock, If peripheral perfusion is poor, it is reasonable to give 20 ml/kg of normal saline initially. If perfusion remains poor, the use of dopamine should be considered. Fluid balance. Give IV fluids at 2/3 maintenance. Use 10% dextrose. Monitor blood glucose with dextrostix and do not let it fall below 2. 2 mmol (explains glucose administration) Prevent/control convulsions. In less severely affected babies, phenobarbitone should be given when there is anyuspicion of actual or impending convulsions (phenobarbitone loading dose 20 mg/kg IM or 10mg/kg slowly IV, then 5 mg/kg daily orally). Treat hvpocalcaemia if it occurs (or more practically, if the baby has uncontrollable fitting with anormal dextrostix). (explains calcium gluconate administration) Notes: Corticosteroids should not be used, and although many paediatricians use mannitol, there is no evidence for its effectiveness.

Most patients initially have an upper respiratory tract infection with some combination of rhinorrhoea, pharyngitis and mild cough and low grade fever for 1-3 days. After this upper airway obstruction becomes apparent. The child then develops the characteristic barking cough, hoarseness and inspiratory stridor. Symptoms are characteristically worse at night and often recur with decreasing intensity for several days and resolve completely within a week. Agitation and crying greatly aggravates the signs and symptoms. The child may prefer to sit up in bed or be held upright.

Most infants with trisomy 13 have congenital anomalies that are incompatible with survival. Surviving children demonstrate failure to thrive, cognitive disabilities, apneic spells, seizures, and deafness. The symptoms and signs include characteristic features, often a normal bih weight, CNS malformations, eye malformations, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly or syndactyly, and congenital heart disease. The incidence of trisomy 18 syndrome is about 1: 4000 live bihs, and the ratio of affected males to females is approximately 1: 3. Trisomy 18 is characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth retardation that is often severe, and hypeonicity. Complications are related to associated bih defects. Death is often caused by heart failure or pneumonia and usually occurs in infancy or early childhood, although a small percentage of patients reach adulthood. Characteristic features of Trisomy 21 include upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, midface hypoplasia, and small, dysplastic pinnae. Characteristic features of Turner syndrome (Monosomy X) include webbed neck, triangular facies, sho stature, wide-set nipples, amenorrhea, and absence of secondary sex characteristics. Ref: Tsaic A.

Wilson disease is caused by mutations in the gene ATP7B on chromosome 13 coding for a specific P-type adenosine triphosphatase involved in copper transpo. This results in impaired bile excretion of copper and incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin by the liver. The disease should be considered in all children older than age 2 years with evidence of liver disease (especially with hemolysis) or with suggestive neurologic signs. Serum ceruloplasmin levels (measured by the oxidase method) are usually less than 20 mg/dL. (Normal values are 23-43 mg/dL.) Low values, however, occur normally in infants younger than 3 months, and in at least 10%-20% of homozygotes the levels may be within the lower end of the normal range (20-30 mg/dL), paicularly if immunoassays are used to measure ceruloplasmin. Rare patients with higher ceruloplasmin levels have been repoed. Serum copper levels are low, but the overlap with normal is too great for satisfactory discrimination. Urine copper excretion in children older than 3 years is normally less than 30 mcg/d; in Wilson disease, it is generally greater than 100 mcg/d although recent repos suggest it can be as low as > 40 mcg/d.

The left atrium may enlarge once Eisenmenger's syndrome develops and a reversal of shunt is seen across the defect. All congenital heart diseases given in option cause left to right shunt. Size of left atrium in left to right shunts In left to right shunt, blood enters from left side of heart (Lt. atrium, Lt ventricle or aorta) to right side of heart (Rt atrium, Rt ventricle or pulmonary artery) depending on the site of abnormal communication. This blood then flows through pulmonary circulation and again enters the left atrium. The path of blood is then depending on the defect. In all these defects, left atrium recieves larger volume of blood which comes through pulmonary circulation -> Blood from right side of heart plus some blood from left side of heart because of shunt enter into pulmonary circulation and then into left atrium. So left atrium recieve blood volume larger than normal. But the effect of larger volume on left atrium will be different in ASD and other left to right shunts. 1). In ASD Left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, but fortunate for the left atrium, it also has an extra exit for blood, i. e., septal defect. So, larger volume of blood is decompressed through left atrium. Amount, which is normally exits through AV valve (mitral valve) into left ventricle. Extra amount, which left atrium recieves, exits through septal defect into right atrium. 2) Other left to right shunts (VSD, FDA, Aortopulmonary window). In these defects also, left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, But there is no extra exit.

The diagnosis of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is strongly suggested by bilateral papable flank masses in an infant with pulmonary hypoplasia, oligohydramnios and hypertension and the absence of renal cysts in the parents. On imaging and biopsy the kidney shows innumerable cysts radiating from medulla to the coex. The other most notable feature of ARPKD is liver involvement disease in the liver is typically diffuse presenting as poal and interlobular fibrosis. More on autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease Also known as infantile polycystic disease, it is an autosomal recessive disorder. Pathology Both kidneys are markedly enlarged and grossly show innumerable cysts throughout the coex and medulla. Microscopic studies demonstrate cysts elongated and radially arranged from medulla to the coex located primarily within the collecting tubules and the ducts. Development of progressive interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy during advanced stages of disease eventually leads to renal failure. Liver involvement is characterized by bile duct proliferation and ectasia as well as by hepatic fibrosis. Clinical manifestations The typical child presents with bilateral flank masses during the neonatal period or early infancy. In the neonates oligohydramnios results from intrauterine renal failure. Oligohydramnios results in insufficient lung development and the typical potter. facies which is characterized by low set ears, a flat nose and retracted chin. Postnatally the typical child presents with bilateral flank masses, renal insufficiency and hypertension. Hypertension is usually noted within the first few weeks of life and is often severe. Urine output is usually not diminished although oliguria and acute renal failure may be seen. 30% of the patient dies in neonatal period due to pulmonary hypoplasia. Diagnosis The diagnosis of ARPKD is strongly suggested by bilateral palpable flank masses in infant with pulmonary hypoplasia, oligohydramnios, and hypertension and the absence of renal cysts in the parents. Ultrasound demonstrates markedly enlarged and uniformly hyperechogenic kidneys with poor coicomedullary distinction. The diagnosis is also suppoed by clinical/laboratory signs of hepatic fibrosis, pathological findings of ductal plate abnormalities seen on liver biopsy, anatomical and pathological proof of ARPKD in a sibling or parental consanguinity.

This prostaglandin has a vasodilatory effect which keeps the ductus open. o The synthesis of these vasodilator is inhibited at bih by the inhibition of the enzyme cycloxygenase at bih. o Cycloxygenase is an impoant enzyme in the synthetic pathway of prostaglandin. o In many premature infants the ductus fail to close spontaneously. In these cases the closure can be produced by infusion of drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase. o Indomethacin is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme cvclooxvgenase. o Indomethacin is routinely used to close the PDA in premature infants, it does not close the PDA of full term infants or children. The success of indomethacin therapy is as high as 80-90% in premature infants with bih weight over 1200 g. o If indomethacin is not successful and the ductus remains hemodynamically significant, surgical ligation should be performed without hesitation. o Recent studies from Europe indicate that ibuprofen may be as effective as indomethacin for the medical closure of preterm PDA.",

Diagnosis o Is usually suspected because of peculiar odour of maple syrup found in the body fluids - urine, sweat, cerumen etc. o Diagnosis is confirmed by amino acid analysis showing marked elevation in plasma level of leucine, isoleucine, valine and alloisoleucine (a steroisomer of isoleucine not normally found in blood) and depression of alanine. Leucine levels are usually higher than those of other three amino acids. o Urine contain high levels of leucine, isoleucine and valine and their respective ketoacids. o The keto acids may be detected by adding a few drops 2-4 dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) reagent which produces a yellow precipitate in positive test. o Ferric chloride gives navy blue colour with the patients urine.",
