Staphylococcus aureus is seen on blood culture within 24 hours. Suddenly the child's condition acutely worsened over the past few minutes, with markedly increased work of breathing, increasing oxygen requirement, and hypotension. On examination there was decreased air entry in left hemithorax and heart sounds were more audible on the right side of chest as compared to left. What could be the possible reason?",
