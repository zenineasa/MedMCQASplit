X-linked recessive deletion of dystrophin gene ( Xp 21)- one of the largest gene C/F: More common in males. Family history present Pseudohyperophy of calf muscles Cardiac involvement Recurrent respiratory infection Proximal muscle weakness in limbs Intellectual disability 'GOWER SIGN' is positive- Gower's sign indicates weakness of the proximal muscles, esp of the lower limbs. Other options Polymyositis: It is a subacute inflammatory myopathy affecting adults, without rash, involvement of eye, family history of neuromuscular disease. GBS: The first symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, alone or in combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. Neuropathy is damage or dysfunction of one or more nerves that typically results in numbness, tingling, muscle weakness and pain in the affected area.",
