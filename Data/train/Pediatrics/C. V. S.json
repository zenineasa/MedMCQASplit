        "exp": "Transposition of great vessels (TGA) is defined as aoa arising from the right ventricle and pulmonary aery from the left ventricle. In patients with TGA, the oxygenated pulmonary venous blood recirculates in the lungs whereas the systemic venous blood recirculates in the systemic circulation. The pulmonary aery saturation is thus always higher than the aoic saturation. Survival depends on the mixing available between the two circulations. Patients of complete TGA with intact ventricular septum are cyanotic at bih. Since the interatrial communication results in poor mixing, the neonates present with rapid breathing and congestive failure secondary to hypoxemia within the first week of life. Physical examination shows severe cyanosis, congestive failure, normal first sound, single second sound and an insignificant grade one to two ejection systolic murmur. The electrocardiogram shows right axis detion and right ventricular hyperophy. The thoracic roentgenogram shows cardiomegaly with a narrow base and plethoric lung fields. The cardiac silhouette can have an \"egg on side\" appearance: The right upper lung fields appear more plethoric than other areas. The thymic shadow is often absent. Patients of TGA with VSD have increased pulmonary blood flow; mixing at the ventricular level determines the severity of cyanosis. They develop congestive failure around 4-10 weeks of age. Physical findings consist of cyanosis, cardiomegaly, congestive failure, normal first sound, single or normally split second sound and grade II-IV ejection systolic murmur. Apical third sound gallop or a mid-diastolic rumble may be present. Electrocardiogram shows right axis detion with biventricular, right ventricular or left ventricular hyperophy. Chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly, plethoric lung fields and features of pulmonary venous hypertension. The aerial switch operation is now established as the treatment of choice for TGA, Prostaglandin El can help reduce cyanosis in selected cases by keeping the PDA open. Interim palliation can be accomplished through a balloon atrial septostomy. Reference: Essential Paediatrics; O. P. Ghai; Page no: 425",

Although the disease is generally benign and self-limited, it is associated with coronary aery aneurysms in approximately 25% of cases. There is typical intimal proliferation and infiltration of the vessel wall with mononuclear cells. Beadlike aneurysms and thromboses may be seen along the aery. Other manifestations include pericarditis, myocarditis, myocardial ischemia and infarction, and cardiomegaly. High-dose IV g-globulin (2 g/kg as a single infusion over 10 h) together with aspirin (100 mg/kg per day for 14 days followed by 3-5 mg/kg per day for several weeks) have been shown to be effective in reducing the prevalence of coronary aery abnormalities when administered early in the course of the disease. Surgery may be necessary for Kawasaki disease patients who have giant coronary aery aneurysms or other coronary complications. Surgical treatment most commonly includes thromboendaerectomy, thrombus clearing, aneurysmal reconstruction, and coronary aery bypass grafting.

In this operation, the pulmonary aery and aoa are transected. The distal aoa is anastomosed to the proximal pulmonary stump (neo-aoic root) and the pulmonary aery to the proximal aoic stump (neopulmonary aery). The coronary aeries are moved along to the neo-aoic root along with a cuff of aoic tissue to allow suturing without compromise of coronary blood flow. There is a limited window of time for performing the aerial switch for TGA. Infants with TGA and intact septum should ideally undergo this procedure within the first 2-4 weeks of life. As pulmonary vascular resistance falls after bih the left ventricle regresses rapidly. In 1-2 months the left ventricle has the ability to adjust to the elevated systemic vascular resistance after the aerial switch through hyperplasia of the available muscle. After this, it is difficult for the left ventricle to adapt to an aerial switch. Later in infancy, the atrial switch operation (Senning operation) is the only option for TGA with intact ventricular septum. This is not an ideal long-term option because the right ventricle remains as the systemic ventricle for life. Over time, right ventricle dysfunction and severe tricuspid regurgitation sets in. Additionally, extensive restructuring of atria predisposes to atrial rhythm disturbances. Reference: Essential Paediatrics; O. P. Ghai; Page no: 426",

        "exp": "The definition of hypertension in adults is BP >=140/90 mm Hg, regardless of body size, sex, or age. This is a functional definition that relates level of BP elevation with the likelihood of subsequent cardiovascular events. Because hypertension-associated cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke, usually do not occur in childhood, the definition of hypertension in children is statistical rather than functional. The National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents published the Fouh Repo on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents (Fouh Repo) in 2004. This repo established normal values based on the normative distribution of BP in healthy children and included tables with systolic and diastolic values for the 50th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentile by age, sex, and height percentile. The Fouh Repo defined hypertension as average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=95th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=3 occasions. Prehypertension was defined as average SBP or diastolic BP that is >=90th percentile but <95th percentile. In adolescents beginning at age 12 yr, prehypertension is defined as BP between 120/80 mm Hg and the 95th percentile. A child with BP levels >=95th percentile in a medical setting but normal BP outside of the office has white coat hypertension. The Fouh Repo fuher recommended that if BP is >=95th percentile, then hypertension should be staged. Children with BP between the 95th and 99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg are categorized as stage 1 hypertension, and children with BP above the 99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg have stage 2 hypertension. Stage 1 hypertension, if asymptomatic and without target organ damage, allows time for evaluation before staing treatment, whereas stage 2 hypertension calls for more prompt evaluation and pharmacologic therapy.
