Associated chromosomal anomalies occur in 30% cases and include trisomies 21, 18, 13 and 22q11 microdeletion, especially in pulmonary atresia and absent pulmonary valve syndrome (APVS). There is also a high association with extra - cardiac anomalies in paicular, abdominal and thoracic abnormalities. When a TOF is diagnosed during fetal life, karyotyping and targeted morphologic ultrasound examination should be offered. Isolated TOF - Good prognosis in TOF with pulmonary stenosis (>90% survival after surgery). However, other forms of TOF such as pulmonary atresia and absent pulmonary valve syndrome do not have a good prognosis (moderate prognosis for pulmonary atresia and bad prognosis for APVS).",

        "question": "What is the pathology of edema in nephrotic syndrome",
        "exp": "Ans. b. Sodium and water retention Sodium and water retention is the pathology of edema in nephrotic syndrome. The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria, edema, and hypoalbuminemia. Renal sodium retention and changes in variables of the Starling equation are fundamental to the pathophysiology of nephrotic edema. There is evidence for both intravascular volume expansion (overfilling) and intravascular volume depletion (under filling) in patients with nephrosis. Microvascular fluid exchange is described using a formulation of the Starling driving forces (DP and Dp) and it is through this equation that nephrotic edema is conceptualized. Previous theories have focused on abnormalities in DP and Dp to explain nephrotic edema. Studies have shown that hypoalbuminemia (and thus Dp) is not a likely cause of edema formation in most nephrotic patients owing to a parallel decrease in interstitial fluid albumin and an increase in interstitial fluid pressure, both of which serve to maintain edema driving forces constant. There is limited evidence suggesting that abnormalities in vascular permeability (Kf and s) may contribute to edema formation. A major advance in our understanding of the pathophysiologic basis of edema formation in the nephrotic syndrome is the discovery that proteinuria can cause primary renal sodium retention through ENaC activation. This mechanism is likely active in all patients with nephrotic syndrome, regardless of their intravascular volume status. Other causes of primary renal sodium retention include increased renal efferent sympathetic nerve activity, ANPase, and in the expression and activity of the Ne--le in the collecting duct in animal models. Fuhermore, excess serum vasopressin levels have been found to contribute to free water retention in some patients with the nephrotic syndrome. \"- Eric Siddall and Jai Radhakrishnan. The pathophysiology of edema formation in the nephrotic syndrome Nephrotic Syndrome Manifestations of Nephrotic Syndrome 1. Massive proteinuria, with the daily loss of 3. 5 gm or more of proteinQ 2. Hypoalbuminemia, with plasma albumin levelsQ 3. Generalized edemaQ 4. Hyperlipidemia and lipiduriaQ Pathophysiology: Renal sodium retention and changes in variables of the Starling equation are fundamental to the pathophysiology of nephrotic edema. There is evidence for both intravascular volume expansion (overfilling) and intravascular volume depletion (under filling) in patients with nephrosis. Nephrotic Syndrome Mechanisms of Sodium Retention in the Nephrotic Syndrome Increased angiotensin 11-independent afferent and efferent aeriolar tone because of increased efferent sympathetic nerve activity. Tubular resistance to atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Increased number of open epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) channels in the coical collecting duct due to proteolytic activation of ENaC by plasmin. Increased number and activity of coical collecting duct Na/K ATPase channels Most impoant facts about Nephrotic syndrome The lipid appears in the urine either as free fat or as oval fat bodies, representing lipoprotein resorbed by tubular epithelial cells and then shed along with the degenerated cells.

Topics covered in this section This section covers the basic aspects of the general developmental assessment for young children with suspected developmental problems including possible autism. This section focuses on the general approach to the developmental assessment, including some specific components of such an assessment, but does not review information on specific autism assessment instruments. Basis for guideline recommendations about the general developmental assessment In the previous section on the use of autism assessment instruments, the guideline recommendations are based on the panel's interpretation of an extensive and systematic review of the scientific literature. The panel did not attempt to systematically evaluate the research evidence on effectiveness of the general developmental assessment methods discussed in this section as this was considered outside the specific scope of the guideline. Therefore, guideline recommendations in this section are based on the consensus opinion of the panel, using its collective knowledge and experience in assessing children with autism. In the panel's opinion, these recommendations reflect appropriate practices for assessing children with possible autism and are generally consistent with the scientific knowledge in this field.",

Since sperm motility is dependent on the functioning of cilia, infeility frequently accompanies this disorder. Situs inversus occurs because ciliary function is necessary for cell migration during embryonic development.

Because left ventricle starts contracting before Right ventricle, pansystolic murmur starts early -> Masking of Si. This pressure gradient is maintained throughout the systole pansystolic murmur lasts long -> Masking of S2. Towards the end of systole, the declining left ventricular pressure becomes lower than aortic -> Early closure of A2. Left to right shunt occurs during systole at a time when the right ventricle is also contracting, therefore left to right shunt streams to pulmonary artery more or less directly -> No volume overload > Right ventricle size remains normal. Increased blood flow through pulmonary valve -> Pulmonary ejection systolic murmur and delay & accentuated P2. Early closure of A2 and delayed closure of P2 cause -> Widely split S2 (But this is usually masked by pansystolic murmur). Larger volume reaches the left atrium -> Left atrial hypertrophy Increased blood flow through mitral valve -> Accentuated S1 (But it is masked by pansystolic murmur) and delayed diastolic murmur. Note: Ejection systolic murmur of pulmonary valve can not be separated from pansystolic murmur. The effect of ejection systolic murmur is a selective transmission of pansystolic murmur to the upper left sternal border (pulmonary valve area) -> In this area ejection characteristic of this murmur can be recognized since it does not mask the aortic component of S2.

        "exp": "Typical absence seizures are characterized by sudden, brief lapses of consciousness without loss of postural control. The seizure typically lasts for only seconds, consciousness returns as suddenly as it was lost, and there is no postictal confusion. Although the brief loss of consciousness may be clinically inapparent or the sole manifestation of the seizure discharge, absence seizures are usually accompanied by subtle, bilateral motor signs such as rapid blinking of the eyelids, chewing movements, or small-amplitude, clonic movements of the hands. Typical absence seizures are associated with a group of genetically determined epilepsies with onset usually in childhood (ages 4-8 years) or early adolescence and are the main seizure type in 15-20% of children with epilepsy. Since the clinical signs of the seizures are subtle, especially to parents who may not have had previous experience with seizures, it is not surprising that the first clue to absence epilepsy is often unexplained \"daydreaming\" and a decline in school performance recognized by a teacher. Hyperventilation tends to provoke these electrographic discharges and even the seizures themselves and is routinely used when recording the EEG. Ref: Lowenstein D. H. (2012). Chapter 369.

        "question": "HPV vaccine is?",
        "exp": "Both bivalent and Quadrivalent Currently, there are two types of cervical cancer vaccines available Gardasil vaccine (quadrivalent vaccine) Cervavarix vaccine (Bivalent vaccine) Gardasil vaccine Gardasil is a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine. Gardasil is the only vaccine that helps protect against 4 types - types 6, 11, 16, 18 - of HPV. - The vaccine helps prevent diseases such as cervical cancer, abnormal and precancerous cervical lesions, vaginal lesions, vulvar lesions, and genital was, caused by these strains of HPV. Gardasil contains recombinant virus like paicle (VLPs) assembled from the Ll proteins of HPVs 6, 11, 16 and 18. - Since VLPs lack the viral DNA, they cannot induce cancer. They do, however, trigger an antibody response that protects vaccine recipients from becoming infected with the HPV Ives represented in the vaccine. Gardasil is recommended to be given to females aged between 9 to 26 years Gardasil provides 98% protection against cervical pre-cancers caused by HPV types 16 & 18, which are responsible for 70% of all cervical cancer cases worldwide. Similarly, in large placebo controlled, double blind, randomized, multicentric studies, the vaccine has also been proven to be 90% effective in the prevention of genital was caused by HPV types 6 and 11, which are responsible for 90% of all genital was cases worldwide. According to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics Committee of Immunization (L4. PC01) 2008 recommendations: \"This vaccine has a. orable tolerability profile and the IAP-001 recommends offering HPV vaccine to all females as per label. The recommended age for initiation of vaccination is 10-12 years and catch up vaccination is permitted up to the age of 26 years. It is recommended to be given in three doses at 0, 2 and 6 months\". Gardasil is usually given in the arm muscle. Three shots are given on the following schedule: - Dose 1 -? - Dose 2 --4 2 months after Dose 1 - Dose 3 -4 6 months after Dose 1 Cervarix Cervarix is a vaccine against HPV types 16 and 18, which currently cause about 70% of cervical cancer cases. - Cervarix is a preventative cervical cancer vaccine, not therapeutic; Cervarix vaccine will not block infection. from cervical cancer-causing HPV strains other than HPV 16, 18, 31 and 45. Cervarix is using the \"L1 protein\" of the viral capsid. The viral proteins induce the. fonnation of neutralizing antibodies. The vaccine contains no live virus and no DNA, so it cannot infect the patient. Cervari data from patients show that at 18 months after the first of a three-dose regimen, 100 percent of women up to age 55 vaccinated with cervarix vaccine had antibodies present against the two most common cancer-causing human papillomavirus types, 16 and 18. Cervarix Vs. Gardasil: which is the better cervical cancer vaccine? Cervarix is \"bivalent\" -effective against only two strains of the virus-vaccine. While Gardasil is \"quadrivalent\" vaccine (effective against four common strains of HPV). The question now arises which vaccine to be the vaccine of choice?? On the face of it a quadrivalent vaccine seems to be the better choice. In reality that is not so - The vaccine protects against the HPV viruses 16, 18, 6, 11, of which only the. first two are responsible for cervical cancer, while the other two are responsible for genital was. On the other hand cervarix gives protection against 16 and 18. It is better because, there is cross-reactive protection against the virus strains 45 and 31, two other viruses causing cervical cancer. Cervarix is formulated with ASO4, a propriety adjuvant that boosts the immune system response. for a longer period of time. Both vaccines are against the human papillom virus but cervarix seems to be more effective against cancer cervix. Cervarix can be given to females between 10 to 45 yrs old whereas Gardasil can be given to females between 10 to 26 yrs only. Both the vaccines are given in the schedule of 0, 1, 6 months, Cervarix is the costlier one being priced at Rs. 3200 per dose. \"Cervarix seems to win against Gardasil because of its stronger immune response and broader protection\".",

Cyanosis may be present Progression of the symptoms and signs is rapid. Diagnosis- The diagnosis of staphylococcal pneumonia is suspected in a newborn or an infant with respiratory infection who has evidence of staphylococcal infection elsewhere in the body (here it is pyoderma). Complications such as pyopneumothorax and pericarditis are highly suggestive of diagnosis (Empyeina in a child below 2 yrs of age is nearly always staphylococcal in etiology) Presence of Pneumatoceles is considered pathognomic for staphylococcal pneumonia (It can also be seen in pneumonia due to Klebsiella) Note: Pyoderma or impetigo is a superficial infection of the skin caused primarily by group A streptococci and occasionally by other streptococci and staphylococci.

In neural tube defects, the skin of the fetus is not intact and so larger amounts of AFP is measured in the mother's blood. In Down syndrome, the AFP is decreased in the mother's blood, presumably because the yolk sac and fetus are smaller than usual. Estriol is a hormone produced by the placenta, using ingredients made by the fetal liver and adrenal gland. Estriol is decreased in the Down syndrome pregnancy. This test may not be included in all screens, depending on the laboratory. Human chorionic gonadotropin hormone is produced by the placenta, and is used to test for the presence of pregnancy. A specific smaller pa of the hormone, called the beta subunit, is increased in Down syndrome pregnancies. Inhibin A is a protein secreted by the ovary, and is designed to inhibit the production of the hormone FSH by the pituitary gland. The level of inhibin A is increased in the blood of mothers of fetuses with Down syndrome. PAPP-A, which stands for pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, is produced by the covering of the newly feilized egg. In the first trimester, low levels of this protein are seen in Down syndrome pregnancies. It is impoant to keep in mind that even the best combination of ultrasound findings and other variables is only predictive and not diagnostic. For true diagnosis, the chromosomes of the fetus must be examined. Amniocentesis is usually carried out between the 14th and 18th week of pregnancy. CVS is usually carried out between the 10th and 12th weeks of pregnancy.",

        "exp": "Bronchiolitis obliterans is a rare chronic obstructive lung disease characterized by complete obliteration of the small airways following a severe insult. The most common form in children is postinfectious, following a lower airway tract infection with adenovirus, although influenza, rubeola, Bordetella, and Mycoplasma are also implicated. Persons with bronchiolitis obliterans usually experience dyspnea, coughing, and exercise intolerance. This diagnosis should be considered in children with persistent cough, wheezing, crackles, or hypoxemia persisting longer than 60 days following a lower respiratory tract infection. Chest X-ray shows hyperlucency and patchy infiltrates. PFT shows airway obstruction. Ventilation-perfusion scans show a pattern of ventilation and perfusion mismatch. Classic findings on chest high-resolution CT include a mosaic perfusion pattern, vascular attenuation, and central bronchiectasis. This finding along with pulmonary function testing showing airway obstruction unresponsive to bronchodilators may be diagnostic in some patients with the appropriate clinical history. Diagnosis is by open lung biopsy or transbronchial biopsy. No specific treatment is required. Administaion of coicosteroids may be benifical. Ref: Federico M. J., Stillwell P., Deterding R.

Severe recurrent hypoglycemia associated with an inappropriate elevation of serum insulin, C-peptide and proinsulin defines this disorder. The disorder later was called persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI); currently many authors prefer the term congenital hyperinsulinism (CI). PHHI is the most common cause of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in neonates. usually affects the infants and children. Adults can also be affected but at a much lower incidence. Histopathology Microscopically, pheochromocytomas are composed of polygonal to spindle-shaped chromaffin cells and their supporting cells, compartmentalized into small nests or \"Zellballen, \" by a rich vascular network. The cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells often has a finely granular appearance, highlighted by a variety of silver stains, because of the presence of granules containing catecholamines. Electron microscopy reveals variable numbers of membrane-bound, electron-dense granules, representing catecholamines and sometimes other peptides. The nuclei of the neoplastic cells are often quite pleomorphic. Presentation Most patients with PHHI present shortly after birth with symptoms of hypoglycemia (e. g. hunger, jitteriness, lethargy, apnea, seizures). Older children, in addition to above symptoms, may also show diaphoresis, confusion, or unusual mood or behaviour changes. The symptoms may be exacerbated by fasting and may improve after eating. Treatment Immediate treatment of hypoglycemia is essential. Patients may require continuous IV glucose infusion. Glucagon may also be administered.

C: Maternal alpha feto-protein level The two earliest tests that were introduced in the 1970's to assess fetal lung maturity were: The lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio Detection of phosphatidylyglycerol Originally, both of these tests were performed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), a technique that required considerable expeise and was both time-consuming and expensive to perform. In the early 1990's another test was developed. The TDx-FLM assay: This test employs fluorescence polarization to measure the ratio of surfactant to albumin (S/ A) in uncentrifuged amniotic fluid. It is simple, quantitative, can be performed in 60 minutes or less and is highly reproducible. TDx-FLM results correlate well with the L/S ratio and PG and with clinical outcomes. Another simple, rapid, and accurate test that can be performed on amniotic fluid to assess fetal lung maturity is the lamellar body (LB) count. LB are made by the type II cells in the alveoli that produce surfactant and, indeed, they are the packages in which surfactant is stored. They are released into the amniotic fluid from the lungs in increasing quantities that parallel surfactant production. Another test actually measures the functional capacity of the surfactants that are present in the amniotic fluid. This test is called the foam stability index (FSI). It too is simple, inexpensive, and can be rapidly performed.",

Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA is located in different places in the cell. During fertilization, the sperm and egg cell nuclei fuse to form an embryo. The egg cell is very large compared to the sperm, so although the cells' nuclei fuse, the rest of the cell mass in the embryo comes from the egg only. Nuclear DNA is therefore co-inherited but the mitochondrial DNA, which is located outside of the nucleus, is always maternally inherited because all mitochondria in a foetus and later adult are derived from the mitochondria in the mother's egg.

Coical tubers or subependymal glial nodules, often calcified. Renal angiomyolipomas. Seizures are the most common presenting symptom. Up to 20% of patients with infantile spasms (a serious epileptic syndrome) have tuberous sclerosis. Ninety-six percent of patients have one or more hypomelanotic macules, facial angiofibromas, ungual fibromas, or shagreen patches. Adenoma sebaceum, the facial skin hamaomas, may first appear in early childhood, often on the cheek, chin, and dry sites of the skin where acne is not usually seen. Mental retardation occurs in up to 50% of patients referred to teiary care centers; the incidence is probably much lower in randomly selected patients. Patients with seizures are more prone to mental retardation or learning disabilities. Diagnostic studies: More helpful is MRI or CT scanning; the latter can show the viually pathognomonic subependymal nodular calcifications and sometimes widened gyri or tubers and brain tumors. Contrast material may show the often classically located tumors near the interventricular foramen. Hypomyelinated lesions may be seen with MRI. Ref: Bernard T. J., Knupp K., Yang M.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., CO2 washout PDA in preterm neonate o In previous explanations I have explained that chances of spontaneous closure of PDA are higher in premature infants as there is no structural abnormality. However, you should keep in mind that this fact is true when we are comparing the spontaneous closure of PDA between term and pre-term neonate. Overall, the percentage of spontaneous closure of PDA in preterm neonate is very low. To avoid confusion, I am explaining following facts in brief:? 1) Normal neonate:- Ductus aeriosus closes functionally within about 15 hours of bih. 2) PDA in term (mature) neonate:- The persistence of ductus aeriosus beyond 24 hours after bih is considered as PDA in term neonate. Spontaneous closure of PDA does not usually occur because PDA results from structural abnormality. 3) PDA in pre-term (pre-mature) neonate:- The ductus aeriosus in pre-term neonate is not as responsive to increased oxygen content as it is in term neonate. However, there is no structural abnormality. i) Chances of spontaneous closure are very less (compared to normal term neonate). ii). Chances of spontaneous closure are more than the term-neonate with PDA. However, in premature neonate, where hypoxic pulmonary disease is commonplace, the ductus being sensitive to hypoxia, remains open. o So, it is very unlikely that spontaneous closure of PDA will occur in pre-term neonate. But chances are more when compared to term neonate with PDA (not normal term neonate in which ductus aeriosus closes within 15 hours of bih). Manifestations of PDA in pre-term neonate 1) Apnea for unexplained reasons in an infant recovering from RDS; 2) A hyperdynamic precordium, bounding peripheral pulses, wide pulse pressure, and a continuous or systolic murmur with or without extension into diastole or an apical diastolic murmur, multiple clicks resembling the shaking of dice; 3) Carbon dioxide retention; 4) Increasing oxygen dependence; 5) X-ray evidence of cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings; and 6) Hepatomegaly o Increased pulmonary blood flow and compromised ventricular function accompanying dropping pulmonary resistance in the setting of a PDA is a significant risk factor for pulmonary hemorrhage. o The greatest risk factor for NEC is prematurity. Any etiology which leads on to hemodynamic or hypoxic insult predisposes to NEC. PDA is common in preterm infants and it definitely causes hemodynamic stress and is a risk factor for development of NEC.",

        "exp": "Neuroblastoma is a childhood tumor of the sympathetic nerves, which most commonly arises along the paraveebral chain or within the adrenal medulla. Neuroblastoma has two characteristic genetic markers: a 1p deletion and an N-myc translocation. N-myc is an oncogene that resides on chromosome 2p, and is amplified up to 300 times in neuroblastoma. Amplification of this gene is associated with a poorer prognosis. Cellular aneuploidy and hyperdiploidy reflect a better prognosis for neuroblastoma, whereas diploid and tetraploid tumors have an intermediate or poor prognosis. Tumor presentation at a younger age predicts a better outcome for neuroblastoma. Children under one year of age have an excellent prognosis, regardless of tumor stage. Ganglion cells within the tumor are a reflection of focal differentiation of the neuroblastoma into ganglioneuroma. Better differentiated tumors have a more orable outcome. Ref: Graham D.

The diagnosis is made by elevated sodium and chloride level in the sweat > 60 meoll. Two tests on different days are required. for accurate diagnosis. A normal sweat chloride dose not exclude the diagnosis. Genotyping and other tests such as measurement of nasal membrane potential difference, pancreatic. function should be done if there is high clinical suspicion of cystic fibrosis. Nasal potential difference Measurement of nasal transepithelial potential difference in vivo can be useful adjunct in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Individuals with cystic fibrosis demonstrate a significantly more negative baseline nasal potential difference, with the topical application of amiloride there is loss of this potential difference. Nasal potential difference is a sensitive test of electrolyte transpo (CFTR) function that can be used to suppo or refute a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Genetic analysis Cystic. fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder. It is caused due to defect in CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein. Cystic fibrosis is associated with large number of mutations. More than 1500 CFTR polymoiphisms are associated with cystic fibrosis syndrome. The most prevalent mutation of CFTR is the deletion of single phenylalanine residue at amino acid 4. 508 This mutation is responsible for high incidence of cystic fibrosis in nohern European populations. Approximately 50% of individuals with CF who are of nohern European ancestry are homozygous for 4. 508 and > 70% carry at least one 4. 508 gene. The remainder of patients has an extensive array of mutation, none of which has prevalence of more than several percent. Testing for cystic. fibrosis mutation was not possible because of the large no. of mutations associated with the disease. Now days commercial laboratories test for 30-80 of the most common CFTR mutations. This testing identifies > 90% individuals who carry 2 CF mutations. No where it is mentioned in the texts that testing only for 4508 is enough for diagnosis. Detection of atleast 2 CF mutations are necessary for making the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The patient has features of cystic fibrosis but sweat chloride levels are normal. - To diagnose cystic. fibrosis in this patient, another laboratory evidence demonstrating CFTR dysfunction is required. This can be done by two methods:? - Demonstrating abnormal potential difference - Demonstrating abnormal CF mutations. But the diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis requires. - Demonstration of two CF mutations (demonstration of single abnormal F508 mutation is not enough) So we are left with abnormal nasal potential difference. - It is an established laboratory evidence for CFTR dysfunction and is accepted as a diagnostic criteria to establish the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

S. D. Explanation for the presence of left axis detion in A. S. D. o Atrial septal defects are of two types Ostium primum atrial septal defect Ostium secundum atrial septal defect o This division depends upon the development of interatrial septum and related structures. o Ostium secundum type atrial septal defect is the classical atrial septum defect. o Presence of interatrial septum is the only developmental anomaly in ostium secundum type and associated with right axis detion. In contrast the ostium primum defects are characterized by presence of ceain other developmental abnormalities, besides the interatrial septum. o Once such abnormality is the malformation or lack of development of the anterosuperior division of the left bundle branch. o Maldevelopment of antero superior division of the left bundle branch is responsible for abnormal left axis detion.",

The ducts of the mucus-secreting glands are obstructed due to an increase in viscosity of these secretions leading to glandular dilatation and destruction. CF patients are prone to chronic bacterial colonization and infections. The sweat glands are not obstructed in CF patients because in serous glands such as sweat glands there are abnormal concentrations of inorganic ions, rather than glandular obstruction with thick mucus. The quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat test is a uniformly accepted method for diagnosing CF. The sweat gland ducts must be patent for this test. Obstruction of airways leads to bronchiectasis and atelectasis; pancreatic duct obstruction leads to pancreatitis and malabsorption; and plugging of bile ducts leads to obstructive jaundice.",

Gastroesophagial reflux disease (GERD) in infants o Gastroesophagial reflux refers to the passage of gastric contents into the esophagus or orpharynx. o GERD is one of the most frequent problems among infants. o Reflux in infants usually develops when they are between two to four weeks old. Within 6-9 months, the acid reflux stas subsiding and it resolves in most of the cases. Clinical features o Post-prandial regurgitation is the most common and probably the earliest syptom of GERD. However, the presence of postprandial regurgitation does not suggest pathological nature of reflux process as regurgitation is also seen in normal infants. (optiopn b is not correct) o Pathological reflux or GERD is said to be present when frequency and/or duration of reflux episodes results in troublesome symptoms and complications (esophagitis or pulmonary). Symptoms of GERD are failure to thrive, poor weight gain, feeding refusal, recurrent vomiting, generalized irritability, respiratory symptoms and arching/bradycardia. Treatment o Conservative measures may be adequate to treat uncomplicated, mild GERD in infants, however, when therapy is necessary for 2 weeks or longer, proton-pump inhibitors are the treatment of choice in children. Remember Most common and earliest symptom of GERD in infant --> Regurgitation. For diagnosing pathological GERD regurgitation alone is not enough as there is physiological reflux (regurgitation)in normal infants. Regurgitation plus one or more troublesome symptoms (Respiratory symptoms, failure to thrive, poor weight gain, etc) are required to indicate pathological GERD.",

Hyponatremic dehydration Sodium loss is more than ECF loss It occurs in 40-45% of diarrheal case Because of low osmolality (due to reduced sodium) water moves from extracellular to intracellular compartment -> signs of dehydration (wrinkled skin due to loss of elasticity).

The number of Barr bodies is thus one less than the number of X-chromosomes. Note - Barr body is found in female But - Kleinefelter syndrome is male with Barr body. Turner syndrome is female without Barr body.",

Most common type of seizures is newborn are subtle seizures and they constitute 50% of all seizures. Subtle seizures are usually mild paroxysmal alterations in motor behaviour or autonomic function that are not clearly clonic, tonic or myoclonic. Newborns rarely have well-organized tonic-clonic seizures because of their incomplete coical organization and a preponderance of inhibitory synapses. The most common type of seizure is characterized by a constellation of findings, including horizontal detion of the eyes with or without jerking; eyelid blinking or fluttering; sucking, smacking, drooling, and other oral-buccal movements; swimming, rowing, or paddling movements; and apneic spells.

Remember that overall mucosal thickness remains same in celiac sprue Celiac ds. is associated with dermatitis herpetiformis. Pathological features Celiac disease is caused by the action of acidic peptides containing the gliadin fraction of wheat. The basic abnormality is thought to be an increased rate of loss of epithelial cells. Crypt cells show increased activity. This causes hypertrophy of crypt. But even this increased activity cannot keep pace with the loss of cells, resulting in a progressive decrease in height of villi causing villous atrophy The epithelial cells show decreased cytoplasm and mucus The intestinal biopsy shows decreases in the villus: crypt ratio. Normally the villi are 3-4 times the height of the crypts (ratio of 3-4: 1); in celiac disease, the ratio decreases progressively (partial, subtotal and total villous atrophy). Total villous atrophy is seen in severe celiac ds and is quite characteristic of celiac ds (partial villous atrophy may be seen in many other conditions).",

        "question": "Child with PDA will not have a. EUR'",
        "exp": "CO. washout During intrauterine life the fetus does not breathe. The. fetus does not require. functioning lung to oxygenate its blood. The fetus receives oxygenated blood from the mother through the umbilical vein. The lungs remains collapsed during the fetal life and the pulmonary circulation is a high pressure circuit. So, the fetal blood does not pass through the lungs. Instead, it requires a duct that can bypass the lung and can carry the blood straight way to systemic circulation i. e., Aoa. This function is carried out by ductus aeriosus. During intrauterine life only 10% of the cardiac output passes through the lungs the remaining 90% is shunted through the ductus aeriosus to the Aoa and the systemic circulation. After bih, the umbilical vein is cut off The blood must now pass through the lungs for oxygenation. Soon, after bih fetus stas breathing, the lung is filled with air and it expands. The pulmonary vasculature changes from high pressure circuit to low pressure circuit. Now, the fetal blood must pass through the lungs to facilitate proper gas exchange. In order to make this possible, the ductus aeriosus undergoes constriction, and functional closure occur soon after bih in term neonates. Eighty percent of the ductus aeriosus in term infants close by 48 hours and nearly 100% by 96 hours. Oxygen and endothelins are very strong vasoconstrictors and pro- staglandins E2 and 12 are strong vasodilator of the ductus aeriosus. During fetal life, the 02 concentration is Low and PGE2 and PGI2 level in high. This keeps the ductus aeriosus patent. Soon after bih there is sudden elevation in circulating oxygen tension and fall in prostaglandin levels. This results in strong vasoconstriction and functional closure of the ductus aeriosus soon after the delivery. The functional closure is followed by anatomic closure in the next 1-3 months. But in ceain infants the ductus aeriosus does not close after the bih it remains open and is called patent ductus aeriosus. Since after bih the systemic circulation has higher pressure than the pulmonary circulation the blood flows from Aoa to the pulmonary aery through the patent ductus aeriosus. Hemodynamic consequences of the PDA Shunting of blood from the systemic circulation to the pulmonary circulation results in congestive cardiac failure, which manifests clinically \"with wide pulse pressure\" and \"bounding pulses\". Overloading of the pulmonary vasculature leads to pulmonary edema/hemorrhage which predisposes the neonate to \"chronic lung\" disease (CO2 retention may occur). Blood flow to the kidney and gastrointestinal tract is compromised due to shunting of blood front systemic circulation, predisposing to acute renal failure (ARE) and \"necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and metabolic acidosis\". Hypoperfusion followed by reperfusion increases the risk of \"Intraventricular hemorrhage\" (1. VH). Clinical features:- Hyperdynamic circulation A wide pulse pressure (> 25 mm Hg), prominent precordial pulsations and \"bounding pulses\"Q.

Now, we are left with Pseudohypoparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism both of which have hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphatemia. In Pseudohypoparathyroidism, there is an increased concentration of parathyroid most of the times. Thus, this option is also excluded. Coming to hypoparathyroidism: As the name suggests, PTH is low in hypoparathyroidism. But, sometimes PTH may be in normal range (10-60 Pg/ml) and this is inappropriately normal PTH. However, it is generally believed that 'Normal' levels of PTH in a patient with hypocalcaemia indicate 'inappropri\u00adately normal PTH' and relative Hypoparathyroidism should always be considered as the initial diagnosis. `Serum PTH levels should be related to the concurrent serum calcium.

The medication acts at V2 receptors, which are found on renal tubule cells, and mediates an anti-diuretic effect by increasing water permeability and water reabsorption in the collecting tubules, leading to decreased urine output. It is effective in 70% of patients with increased nocturnal urine output. Detrusor muscle tone is under control of the parasympathetic system. DDAVP does not affect this system. Some sympathomimetic drugs may cause enough wakefulness so that the child perceives the urge to void. Dextroamphetamine sulfate is one such medication. The external sphincter is under somatic nervous control. This medication does not contribute to this system. Ref: Goldson E., Reynolds A. (2012). Chapter 3. Child Development & Behavior. In W. W.

Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma is a peculiar astrocytic tumor that grows from the walls of the lateral ventricles. It is pathognomonic of tuberous sclerosis, which is caused by mutations of TS1 or TS2 genes. Tuberous sclerosis manifests with multiple hamaomatous lesions in the skin, CNS, and visceral organs. Coical tubers are malformed (hamaomatous) nodules of the coex, probably resulting from faulty coical development. Other lesions include shagreen patches and ash-leaf spots on the skin, cardiac myxomas, and renal angiomyolipomas. Cafe-au-lait spots are found in both types of neurofibromatosis. Lisch nodules are small pigmented nodular lesions of hamaomatous nature that are present in the iris of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. Hemangioblastoma is a vascular tumor of unknown histologic origin that frequently develops in the cerebellum of patients with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Renal cell carcinomas are also common in this disease. Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is caused by autosomal dominant mutations of the VHL gene, a tumor suppressor gene. You may recall that mutations of VHL gene are also found in the majority of sporadic renal cell carcinomas. Ref: Bernard T. J., Knupp K., Yang M. L., Kedia S., Levisohn P. M., Moe P. G. (2012).

Together, these cancers account for 63 percent of cases Early in the disease, leukemia may cause nonspecific symptoms similar to those of a viral infection. Leukemia should be suspected if persistent vague symptoms are accompanied by evidence of abnormal bleeding, bone pain, lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. The presenting symptoms of a brain tumor may include elevated intracranial pressure, nerve abnormalities and seizures. A spinal tumor often presents with signs and symptoms of spinal cord compression. In children, lymphoma may present as one or more painless masses, often in the neck, accompanied by signs and symptoms resulting from local compression, as well as signs and symptoms of systemic disturbances, such as fever and weight loss. A neuroblastoma may arise from sympathetic nervous tissue anywhere in the body, but this tumor most often develops in the abdomen. The presentation depends on the local effects of the solid tumor and any metastases. An abdominal mass in a child may also be due to Wilms' tumor.

        "exp": "CPAP The symptoms suggest neonatal respiratory distress syndrome / hyaline membrane disease. Respiratory distress syndrome / hyaline membrane disease occur because of inadequate production of surfactant. Since surfactant deficiency is the basis of RDS, exogenous surfactant is now recommended as the treatment of choice in neonates with RDS. - It is given to all neonates less than 28 weeks irrespective of presence or absence of RDS (Rescue treatment). -Beyond this age surfactant therapy is given according to the clinical condition of the patient. - If the distress is severe surfactant is required. - In the question the neonate is 32 weeks old and presents with moderate respiratory distress. - Surfactant is not necessary in such patient. Remember \"Surfactant is not universally indicated in all cases of respiratory distress syndrome\". Management of Respiratory distress syndrome Management of respiratory distress syndrome begins with admi-nistration of warm humidified oxygen. - This should maintain the aerial levels between 50 and 70 mm Hg (85-95% saturation) to maintain normal tissue oxygenation. If Pa02 cannot be maintained above 50 mm Hg at inspired 02 concentration of 60% or greater CPAP should be applied. - If the patient is VLBW (very low bih weight) then CPAP is used early (t/t begins with CPAP instead of oxygen). - Another approach in VLBW infant is to intuhate the infant, administer intracheal surfactant, then extubutate the patient and put him on CPAP. (In the question the infant is 1. 5 kg at 32 weeks, his weight, for age is adequate). Infants with severe RDS require mechanical ventilation. According to Indian Journal of pediatrics Early c. PAP in respiratory distress syndrome It is impoant to note that c. PAP helps mainly by preventing the alveolar collapse in infants with surfactant deficiency. Once atelactasis and collapse have occurred c. PAP might not help much. - Therefore all preterm infants < 35 weeks with any sign of respiratory distress should be staed immediately on c. PAP. Prophylactic c. PAP Extending the above logic some have advocated the use of prophylactic c. PAP before the onset of respiratory distress in preterm VLBW infants as majority of them would eventually develop respiratory distress. However there is no evidence for any additional benefits with this approach, indeed there are concerns regarding increased adverse effect such as intraventricular hemorrhage. \"Hence prophylactic c. PAP is not recommended at present\". Beneficial effects of c. PAP Increase in functional residual capacity Increased pulmonary compliance Prevents alveolar collapse Increases airway diameter Conserves surfactant Decrease in alveolar aerial 02 pressure gradiant. More on c. PAP Continuous positive airway pressure is a modality in which increased pulmonary pressure is provided during the expiratory phase of respiration in spontaneously breathing neonates. The mechanism by which CPAP produces its beneficial effects includes:? - Increased alveolar recruitment and stability - Redistribution of lung vvater This results in improved V/Q matching The administration of CPAP:? - Decreases oxygen requirements - Decreased need for mechanical ventilation and - Reduces moality and duration of respiratory assistance Indications of CPAP Inadequate aerial blood gas values - Inability to maintain a Pa02 greater than 50 mm. Hg with Fi02. 60. c. PAP is initiated in newborns with RDS when Pa02 is approximately less than 50 mm. Hg on a Fi02 of. 40. Abnormalities on physical examination - the presence of increased work of breathing as indicated by an increase in respiratory rate of >30% of normal, substernal and suprasternal retractions grunting and nasal flaring, the presence of pale or cyanotic skin colour and agitation. In treatment of RDS in both term and preterm infants. Prolonged and recurrent apneic attacks of prematurity. The presence of poorly expanded and / or infiltrated lung fields on chest radiograph.
