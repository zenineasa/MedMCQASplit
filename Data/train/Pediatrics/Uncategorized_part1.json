        "question": "What is the pathology of edema in nephrotic syndrome",
        "exp": "Ans. b. Sodium and water retention Sodium and water retention is the pathology of edema in nephrotic syndrome. The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria, edema, and hypoalbuminemia. Renal sodium retention and changes in variables of the Starling equation are fundamental to the pathophysiology of nephrotic edema. There is evidence for both intravascular volume expansion (overfilling) and intravascular volume depletion (under filling) in patients with nephrosis. Microvascular fluid exchange is described using a formulation of the Starling driving forces (DP and Dp) and it is through this equation that nephrotic edema is conceptualized. Previous theories have focused on abnormalities in DP and Dp to explain nephrotic edema. Studies have shown that hypoalbuminemia (and thus Dp) is not a likely cause of edema formation in most nephrotic patients owing to a parallel decrease in interstitial fluid albumin and an increase in interstitial fluid pressure, both of which serve to maintain edema driving forces constant. There is limited evidence suggesting that abnormalities in vascular permeability (Kf and s) may contribute to edema formation. A major advance in our understanding of the pathophysiologic basis of edema formation in the nephrotic syndrome is the discovery that proteinuria can cause primary renal sodium retention through ENaC activation. This mechanism is likely active in all patients with nephrotic syndrome, regardless of their intravascular volume status. Other causes of primary renal sodium retention include increased renal efferent sympathetic nerve activity, ANPase, and in the expression and activity of the Ne--le in the collecting duct in animal models. Fuhermore, excess serum vasopressin levels have been found to contribute to free water retention in some patients with the nephrotic syndrome. \"- Eric Siddall and Jai Radhakrishnan.

Hypoalbuminemia, with plasma albumin levelsQ 3. Generalized edemaQ 4. Hyperlipidemia and lipiduriaQ Pathophysiology: Renal sodium retention and changes in variables of the Starling equation are fundamental to the pathophysiology of nephrotic edema. There is evidence for both intravascular volume expansion (overfilling) and intravascular volume depletion (under filling) in patients with nephrosis. Nephrotic Syndrome Mechanisms of Sodium Retention in the Nephrotic Syndrome Increased angiotensin 11-independent afferent and efferent aeriolar tone because of increased efferent sympathetic nerve activity. Tubular resistance to atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Increased number of open epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) channels in the coical collecting duct due to proteolytic activation of ENaC by plasmin. Increased number and activity of coical collecting duct Na/K ATPase channels Most impoant facts about Nephrotic syndrome The lipid appears in the urine either as free fat or as oval fat bodies, representing lipoprotein resorbed by tubular epithelial cells and then shed along with the degenerated cells.

Topics covered in this section This section covers the basic aspects of the general developmental assessment for young children with suspected developmental problems including possible autism. This section focuses on the general approach to the developmental assessment, including some specific components of such an assessment, but does not review information on specific autism assessment instruments. Basis for guideline recommendations about the general developmental assessment In the previous section on the use of autism assessment instruments, the guideline recommendations are based on the panel's interpretation of an extensive and systematic review of the scientific literature. The panel did not attempt to systematically evaluate the research evidence on effectiveness of the general developmental assessment methods discussed in this section as this was considered outside the specific scope of the guideline. Therefore, guideline recommendations in this section are based on the consensus opinion of the panel, using its collective knowledge and experience in assessing children with autism. In the panel's opinion, these recommendations reflect appropriate practices for assessing children with possible autism and are generally consistent with the scientific knowledge in this field.",

Since sperm motility is dependent on the functioning of cilia, infeility frequently accompanies this disorder.

        "exp": "Typical absence seizures are characterized by sudden, brief lapses of consciousness without loss of postural control. The seizure typically lasts for only seconds, consciousness returns as suddenly as it was lost, and there is no postictal confusion. Although the brief loss of consciousness may be clinically inapparent or the sole manifestation of the seizure discharge, absence seizures are usually accompanied by subtle, bilateral motor signs such as rapid blinking of the eyelids, chewing movements, or small-amplitude, clonic movements of the hands. Typical absence seizures are associated with a group of genetically determined epilepsies with onset usually in childhood (ages 4-8 years) or early adolescence and are the main seizure type in 15-20% of children with epilepsy. Since the clinical signs of the seizures are subtle, especially to parents who may not have had previous experience with seizures, it is not surprising that the first clue to absence epilepsy is often unexplained \"daydreaming\" and a decline in school performance recognized by a teacher. Hyperventilation tends to provoke these electrographic discharges and even the seizures themselves and is routinely used when recording the EEG. Ref: Lowenstein D. H. (2012). Chapter 369.

Grade III or less ejection systolic murmur of a functional type may be heard in anemia or high fever in otherwise normal children. 2) Diastolic murmur Presence of diastolic murmur always indicates the presence of organic heart disease. There are two exceptions. i) Severe hypertension --> Reduction of BP may cause an AR murmur to disappear. ii) Anemia --> May result in delayed diastolic murmur across the tricuspid and mitral area. 3) Cyanosis Central cyanosis indicates presence of heart disease if lung disease has been excluded. 4) CHF Presence of CHF indicates presence of heart disease except in neonates and infants who get CHF from causes such as hypoglycemia and anemia. B) Minor criteria 1) Systolic murmur less than grade III in intensity. 2) Abnormal second heart sound Abnormal S2 always indicates presence of heart disease. It has been included as a minor criterian only because auscultation is an individual and subjective finding. 3) Abnormal ECG Main value of ECG lies in determining the:? i) Mean QRS axis ii) Right or left atrial hyperophy iii) Right or left ventricular hyperophy 4) Abnormal X-ray If there is cardiomegaly in a good inspiratory film, it is highly suggestive for the presence of heart disease. 5) Abnormal BP",

Many other purpoed risk factors have also been cited but seem to have a lesser effect, including perinatal asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome, umbilical catheterization, hypothermia, shock, patent ductus aeriosus, cyanotic congenital heart disease, polycythemia, thrombocytosis, anemia, exchange transfusion, congenital GI anomalies, chronic diarrhea, non-breast milk formula, nasojejunal feedings, hypeonic formula, and colonization with necrogenic bacteria. It may simply be that any already fragile baby, paicularly if premature, who has other significant underlying disease, is at increased risk for developing necrotizing enterocolitis. Ref: Thilo E.

In neural tube defects, the skin of the fetus is not intact and so larger amounts of AFP is measured in the mother's blood. In Down syndrome, the AFP is decreased in the mother's blood, presumably because the yolk sac and fetus are smaller than usual. Estriol is a hormone produced by the placenta, using ingredients made by the fetal liver and adrenal gland. Estriol is decreased in the Down syndrome pregnancy. This test may not be included in all screens, depending on the laboratory. Human chorionic gonadotropin hormone is produced by the placenta, and is used to test for the presence of pregnancy. A specific smaller pa of the hormone, called the beta subunit, is increased in Down syndrome pregnancies. Inhibin A is a protein secreted by the ovary, and is designed to inhibit the production of the hormone FSH by the pituitary gland. The level of inhibin A is increased in the blood of mothers of fetuses with Down syndrome. PAPP-A, which stands for pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, is produced by the covering of the newly feilized egg. In the first trimester, low levels of this protein are seen in Down syndrome pregnancies. It is impoant to keep in mind that even the best combination of ultrasound findings and other variables is only predictive and not diagnostic. For true diagnosis, the chromosomes of the fetus must be examined. Amniocentesis is usually carried out between the 14th and 18th week of pregnancy. CVS is usually carried out between the 10th and 12th weeks of pregnancy.",

        "exp": "Bronchiolitis obliterans is a rare chronic obstructive lung disease characterized by complete obliteration of the small airways following a severe insult. The most common form in children is postinfectious, following a lower airway tract infection with adenovirus, although influenza, rubeola, Bordetella, and Mycoplasma are also implicated. Persons with bronchiolitis obliterans usually experience dyspnea, coughing, and exercise intolerance. This diagnosis should be considered in children with persistent cough, wheezing, crackles, or hypoxemia persisting longer than 60 days following a lower respiratory tract infection. Chest X-ray shows hyperlucency and patchy infiltrates. PFT shows airway obstruction. Ventilation-perfusion scans show a pattern of ventilation and perfusion mismatch. Classic findings on chest high-resolution CT include a mosaic perfusion pattern, vascular attenuation, and central bronchiectasis. This finding along with pulmonary function testing showing airway obstruction unresponsive to bronchodilators may be diagnostic in some patients with the appropriate clinical history. Diagnosis is by open lung biopsy or transbronchial biopsy. No specific treatment is required. Administaion of coicosteroids may be benifical. Ref: Federico M. J., Stillwell P., Deterding R.

Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA is located in different places in the cell. During fertilization, the sperm and egg cell nuclei fuse to form an embryo. The egg cell is very large compared to the sperm, so although the cells' nuclei fuse, the rest of the cell mass in the embryo comes from the egg only. Nuclear DNA is therefore co-inherited but the mitochondrial DNA, which is located outside of the nucleus, is always maternally inherited because all mitochondria in a foetus and later adult are derived from the mitochondria in the mother's egg.

        "exp": "Essentials of Diagnosis & Typical Features of Tuberous sclerosis: Facial angiofibromas or subungual fibromas. Often hypomelanotic macules, gingival fibromas. Retinal hamaomas. Coical tubers or subependymal glial nodules, often calcified. Renal angiomyolipomas. Seizures are the most common presenting symptom. Up to 20% of patients with infantile spasms (a serious epileptic syndrome) have tuberous sclerosis. Ninety-six percent of patients have one or more hypomelanotic macules, facial angiofibromas, ungual fibromas, or shagreen patches. Adenoma sebaceum, the facial skin hamaomas, may first appear in early childhood, often on the cheek, chin, and dry sites of the skin where acne is not usually seen. Mental retardation occurs in up to 50% of patients referred to teiary care centers; the incidence is probably much lower in randomly selected patients. Patients with seizures are more prone to mental retardation or learning disabilities. Diagnostic studies: More helpful is MRI or CT scanning; the latter can show the viually pathognomonic subependymal nodular calcifications and sometimes widened gyri or tubers and brain tumors. Contrast material may show the often classically located tumors near the interventricular foramen. Hypomyelinated lesions may be seen with MRI. Ref: Bernard T. J., Knupp K., Yang M.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., CO2 washout PDA in preterm neonate o In previous explanations I have explained that chances of spontaneous closure of PDA are higher in premature infants as there is no structural abnormality. However, you should keep in mind that this fact is true when we are comparing the spontaneous closure of PDA between term and pre-term neonate. Overall, the percentage of spontaneous closure of PDA in preterm neonate is very low. To avoid confusion, I am explaining following facts in brief:? 1) Normal neonate:- Ductus aeriosus closes functionally within about 15 hours of bih. 2) PDA in term (mature) neonate:- The persistence of ductus aeriosus beyond 24 hours after bih is considered as PDA in term neonate. Spontaneous closure of PDA does not usually occur because PDA results from structural abnormality. 3) PDA in pre-term (pre-mature) neonate:- The ductus aeriosus in pre-term neonate is not as responsive to increased oxygen content as it is in term neonate. However, there is no structural abnormality. i) Chances of spontaneous closure are very less (compared to normal term neonate). ii). Chances of spontaneous closure are more than the term-neonate with PDA. However, in premature neonate, where hypoxic pulmonary disease is commonplace, the ductus being sensitive to hypoxia, remains open. o So, it is very unlikely that spontaneous closure of PDA will occur in pre-term neonate. But chances are more when compared to term neonate with PDA (not normal term neonate in which ductus aeriosus closes within 15 hours of bih). Manifestations of PDA in pre-term neonate 1) Apnea for unexplained reasons in an infant recovering from RDS; 2) A hyperdynamic precordium, bounding peripheral pulses, wide pulse pressure, and a continuous or systolic murmur with or without extension into diastole or an apical diastolic murmur, multiple clicks resembling the shaking of dice; 3) Carbon dioxide retention; 4) Increasing oxygen dependence; 5) X-ray evidence of cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings; and 6) Hepatomegaly o Increased pulmonary blood flow and compromised ventricular function accompanying dropping pulmonary resistance in the setting of a PDA is a significant risk factor for pulmonary hemorrhage. o The greatest risk factor for NEC is prematurity. Any etiology which leads on to hemodynamic or hypoxic insult predisposes to NEC. PDA is common in preterm infants and it definitely causes hemodynamic stress and is a risk factor for development of NEC.",

In moderate or mild cases of metabolic acidosis i. e., when the pH is > 7. 2 metabolic acidosis needs no specific t/t. T/T of the underlying cause is sufficient. (it will correct the acidosis) Once the underlying cause (here tissue perfusion) is corrected the pH will return to normal But when the pH is < 7. 2 specific bicarbonate therapy is warranted because this degree of acidosis may depress cardiac contractility. According to Harrison \"In general severe acidosis (pH < 7. 20) warrant the intravenous administration of 50-100 meq of Na. HCO3 over 30-45 minutes during the initial, 1 to 2 hours of therapy\". So here, besides fluid administration to correct tissue perfusion, HCO3 transfusion is also required because pH is 7. The question is which complication should be first attended to, peripheral circulatory failure or severe metabolic acidosis.

The diagnosis is made by elevated sodium and chloride level in the sweat > 60 meoll. Two tests on different days are required. for accurate diagnosis. A normal sweat chloride dose not exclude the diagnosis. Genotyping and other tests such as measurement of nasal membrane potential difference, pancreatic. function should be done if there is high clinical suspicion of cystic fibrosis. Nasal potential difference Measurement of nasal transepithelial potential difference in vivo can be useful adjunct in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Individuals with cystic fibrosis demonstrate a significantly more negative baseline nasal potential difference, with the topical application of amiloride there is loss of this potential difference. Nasal potential difference is a sensitive test of electrolyte transpo (CFTR) function that can be used to suppo or refute a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Genetic analysis Cystic. fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder. It is caused due to defect in CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein. Cystic fibrosis is associated with large number of mutations. More than 1500 CFTR polymoiphisms are associated with cystic fibrosis syndrome. The most prevalent mutation of CFTR is the deletion of single phenylalanine residue at amino acid 4. 508 This mutation is responsible for high incidence of cystic fibrosis in nohern European populations. Approximately 50% of individuals with CF who are of nohern European ancestry are homozygous for 4. 508 and > 70% carry at least one 4. 508 gene. The remainder of patients has an extensive array of mutation, none of which has prevalence of more than several percent. Testing for cystic. fibrosis mutation was not possible because of the large no. of mutations associated with the disease. Now days commercial laboratories test for 30-80 of the most common CFTR mutations. This testing identifies > 90% individuals who carry 2 CF mutations. No where it is mentioned in the texts that testing only for 4508 is enough for diagnosis. Detection of atleast 2 CF mutations are necessary for making the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The patient has features of cystic fibrosis but sweat chloride levels are normal. - To diagnose cystic. fibrosis in this patient, another laboratory evidence demonstrating CFTR dysfunction is required. This can be done by two methods:? - Demonstrating abnormal potential difference - Demonstrating abnormal CF mutations. But the diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis requires. - Demonstration of two CF mutations (demonstration of single abnormal F508 mutation is not enough) So we are left with abnormal nasal potential difference. - It is an established laboratory evidence for CFTR dysfunction and is accepted as a diagnostic criteria to establish the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis Presence of typical clinical features (respiratory, G. LT, genitourinary) OR A history of CF in a sibling OR A positive newborn screening test PLUS Laboratory evidence for CFTR Dysfunction Two elevated sweat chloride concentrations obtained on separate days OR Identification of two CF mutations OR An abnormal nasal potential difference",

Gastroesophagial reflux disease (GERD) in infants o Gastroesophagial reflux refers to the passage of gastric contents into the esophagus or orpharynx. o GERD is one of the most frequent problems among infants. o Reflux in infants usually develops when they are between two to four weeks old. Within 6-9 months, the acid reflux stas subsiding and it resolves in most of the cases. Clinical features o Post-prandial regurgitation is the most common and probably the earliest syptom of GERD. However, the presence of postprandial regurgitation does not suggest pathological nature of reflux process as regurgitation is also seen in normal infants. (optiopn b is not correct) o Pathological reflux or GERD is said to be present when frequency and/or duration of reflux episodes results in troublesome symptoms and complications (esophagitis or pulmonary). Symptoms of GERD are failure to thrive, poor weight gain, feeding refusal, recurrent vomiting, generalized irritability, respiratory symptoms and arching/bradycardia. Treatment o Conservative measures may be adequate to treat uncomplicated, mild GERD in infants, however, when therapy is necessary for 2 weeks or longer, proton-pump inhibitors are the treatment of choice in children. Remember Most common and earliest symptom of GERD in infant --> Regurgitation. For diagnosing pathological GERD regurgitation alone is not enough as there is physiological reflux (regurgitation)in normal infants. Regurgitation plus one or more troublesome symptoms (Respiratory symptoms, failure to thrive, poor weight gain, etc) are required to indicate pathological GERD.",

        "exp": "Types of Dehydration in diarrhoea A large amount of water and water-soluble nutritive substances such as electrolytes, metabolites and vitamins are lost from the body during diarrhoea episodes. Loss of water from the body causes a reduction or shrinkage in the volume of ECF. Depending on the concentration of sodium, this ECF reduction can be classified into - Isonatremic dehydration Sodium loss is parallel to water loss so that sodium concentration in ECF or plasma remains normal (; 140 meq/L). It occurs in about 50% of diarrheal cases. Hyponatremic dehydration Sodium loss is more than ECF loss It occurs in 40-45% of diarrheal case Because of low osmolality (due to reduced sodium) water moves from extracellular to intracellular compartment -> signs of dehydration (wrinkled skin due to loss of elasticity). Hypernatremic dehydration In about 5% of cases, especially in a child who has been given fluids with more salts, serum level may be elevated (> 150 m. Eq/L). Water moves from inside the cells to the extracellular compartment. This may mask the physical findings of dehydration and the patients may be undertaken as mild dehydration even in the presence of severe dehydration -> complications of severe dehydration may occur due to delay in management. So, hypernatremic dehydration is more dangerous.",

Glycogen storage diseases o Glycogen storage diseases result from a hereditary deficiency of one of the enzymes involved in the synthesis or sequential degradation of glycogen. o Clinical features depend on type of enzyme deficiency and organ involvement. o Glycogen storage diseases can be divided into:? 1) Hepatic form (Liver glycogenoses) Liver is the key player in glycogen metabolism. It contains enzymes that synthesize glycogen for storage and ultimately break it down into free glucose, which is then released into blood. So, An inherited deficiency of hepatic enzymes that are involved in glycogen metabolism leads to i) Storage of glycogen in liver Hepatomegaly. it) Reduction in blood glucose --) Hypoglycemia. Examples of liver glycogenoses are - i) Type I glycogenosis Glucose - 6 - phosphatase deficiency (Von Gierke disease). ii) Type III glycogenosis ----> Debranching enzyme def iii) Type IV glycogenesis ----> Branching enzyme def iv) Type VI glycogenosis --> Liver phosphorylase def 2) Myopathic form (Muscular glycogenoses) In skeletal muscle, as apposed to the liver, glycogen is used predominantly as a source of energy. This is derived by glycolysis, which leads ultimately to the formation of lactate. So, enzyme deficiency leads to? i) Glycogen deposition in muscle Muscle cramp after exercise iii) Exercise - induced rise in blood lactase levels owing to block in glycolysis iv) There may be myoglobinemia Examples are? i) Type V glycogenosis --> phosphorylase deficiency (Mc.

Seizure types include subtle (characterized by variable findings), tonic, and multifocal clonic. Most common causes include hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intracranial bleeds, and infection. Most common type of seizures is newborn are subtle seizures and they constitute 50% of all seizures. Subtle seizures are usually mild paroxysmal alterations in motor behaviour or autonomic function that are not clearly clonic, tonic or myoclonic. Newborns rarely have well-organized tonic-clonic seizures because of their incomplete coical organization and a preponderance of inhibitory synapses. The most common type of seizure is characterized by a constellation of findings, including horizontal detion of the eyes with or without jerking; eyelid blinking or fluttering; sucking, smacking, drooling, and other oral-buccal movements; swimming, rowing, or paddling movements; and apneic spells.

        "question": "Child with PDA will not have a. EUR'",
        "exp": "CO. washout During intrauterine life the fetus does not breathe. The. fetus does not require. functioning lung to oxygenate its blood. The fetus receives oxygenated blood from the mother through the umbilical vein. The lungs remains collapsed during the fetal life and the pulmonary circulation is a high pressure circuit. So, the fetal blood does not pass through the lungs. Instead, it requires a duct that can bypass the lung and can carry the blood straight way to systemic circulation i. e., Aoa. This function is carried out by ductus aeriosus. During intrauterine life only 10% of the cardiac output passes through the lungs the remaining 90% is shunted through the ductus aeriosus to the Aoa and the systemic circulation. After bih, the umbilical vein is cut off The blood must now pass through the lungs for oxygenation. Soon, after bih fetus stas breathing, the lung is filled with air and it expands. The pulmonary vasculature changes from high pressure circuit to low pressure circuit. Now, the fetal blood must pass through the lungs to facilitate proper gas exchange. In order to make this possible, the ductus aeriosus undergoes constriction, and functional closure occur soon after bih in term neonates. Eighty percent of the ductus aeriosus in term infants close by 48 hours and nearly 100% by 96 hours. Oxygen and endothelins are very strong vasoconstrictors and pro- staglandins E2 and 12 are strong vasodilator of the ductus aeriosus. During fetal life, the 02 concentration is Low and PGE2 and PGI2 level in high. This keeps the ductus aeriosus patent. Soon after bih there is sudden elevation in circulating oxygen tension and fall in prostaglandin levels. This results in strong vasoconstriction and functional closure of the ductus aeriosus soon after the delivery. The functional closure is followed by anatomic closure in the next 1-3 months. But in ceain infants the ductus aeriosus does not close after the bih it remains open and is called patent ductus aeriosus. Since after bih the systemic circulation has higher pressure than the pulmonary circulation the blood flows from Aoa to the pulmonary aery through the patent ductus aeriosus. Hemodynamic consequences of the PDA Shunting of blood from the systemic circulation to the pulmonary circulation results in congestive cardiac failure, which manifests clinically \"with wide pulse pressure\" and \"bounding pulses\". Overloading of the pulmonary vasculature leads to pulmonary edema/hemorrhage which predisposes the neonate to \"chronic lung\" disease (CO2 retention may occur). Blood flow to the kidney and gastrointestinal tract is compromised due to shunting of blood front systemic circulation, predisposing to acute renal failure (ARE) and \"necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and metabolic acidosis\". Hypoperfusion followed by reperfusion increases the risk of \"Intraventricular hemorrhage\" (1. VH). Clinical features:- Hyperdynamic circulation A wide pulse pressure (> 25 mm Hg), prominent precordial pulsations and \"bounding pulses\"Q. An ejection systolic murmurQ heard best at the 2nd left parasternal area. Metabolic acidosis not attributable to hypoperfusion and sepsis.

        "exp": "This child has:- Hypocalcemia Hyperphosphatemia Normal PTH levels Option b & d can be ruled out because:- In Vitamin D deficiency:- serum calcium is normal or slightly reduced (7. 5 \u00ad 8 mg/dl); serum P043 is normal or slightly reduced, and parathormone levels are increased. hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is not related to calcium and phosphate metabolism. Now, we are left with Pseudohypoparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism both of which have hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphatemia. In Pseudohypoparathyroidism, there is an increased concentration of parathyroid most of the times. Thus, this option is also excluded. Coming to hypoparathyroidism: As the name suggests, PTH is low in hypoparathyroidism. But, sometimes PTH may be in normal range (10-60 Pg/ml) and this is inappropriately normal PTH. However, it is generally believed that 'Normal' levels of PTH in a patient with hypocalcaemia indicate 'inappropri\u00adately normal PTH' and relative Hypoparathyroidism should always be considered as the initial diagnosis. `Serum PTH levels should be related to the concurrent serum calcium. High PTH is the normal response to hypocalcaemia and therefore 'normal' PTH in a patient with Hypocalcaemia indicates relative Hypoparathyroidism' \u00adPractical Algorithms in Pediatric Endocrinology' by Hochberg (2007)/71. Because normally hypocalemia is a potent stimulus for secretion of PTH, patients with intact parathyroid gland function should be expected to have high circulating levels of PTH, during hypocalcaemia episodes. Low levels of serum PTH and in some assays even inappropriately 'normal' levels despite hypocalcaemia should prompt consider\u00adation of various form of hypoparathyroidism' - Principles and Practice of Endocrinology & Metabolism ' by Beeker.",

The medication acts at V2 receptors, which are found on renal tubule cells, and mediates an anti-diuretic effect by increasing water permeability and water reabsorption in the collecting tubules, leading to decreased urine output. It is effective in 70% of patients with increased nocturnal urine output. Detrusor muscle tone is under control of the parasympathetic system. DDAVP does not affect this system. Some sympathomimetic drugs may cause enough wakefulness so that the child perceives the urge to void. Dextroamphetamine sulfate is one such medication. The external sphincter is under somatic nervous control. This medication does not contribute to this system. Ref: Goldson E., Reynolds A. (2012). Chapter 3. Child Development & Behavior. In W. W.

It is a mitochondrial, enzyme complex consisting of \u03b1-ketoacid decarboxylase Dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase and Transacylase The early steps in the metabolism of these three amino-acids are similar. One of the steps - decarboxylation is accomplished by a complex enzyme system i. e. branched chain \u03b1-keto acid dehydrogenase using thiamine pyrophosphate (vitamin B1) as a coenzyme. Deficiency of this enzyme system causes the disease, named after the sweet odour of maple syrup found in the body fluids - urine, sweat etc. Clinical features Affected infants are initially normal at birth but develop poor feeding and vomiting during the Pt week of life; lethargy and coma may ensue within a few days. Physical examination reveals hypertonicity and muscular rigidity with opisthotonos (spasm in which the body forms a bow like a figure) Periods of hypertonicity may alternate with bouts of flaccidity. Convulsion occurs in most infants, and hypoglycemia is common (However in contrast to most hypoglycemic states, correction of the blood glucose level does not improve the clinical condition).",

Glycogen storage diseases Glycogen storage diseases result from a hereditary deficiency of one of the enzymes involved in the synthesis or sequential degradation of glycogen. Clinical features depend on the type of enzyme deficiency and organ involvement. Glycogen storage diseases can be divided into:- 1) Hepatic form (Liver glycogenolysis) The liver is the key player in glycogen metabolism. It contains enzymes that synthesize glycogen for storage and ultimately break it down into free glucose, which is then released into the blood. So, An inherited deficiency of hepatic enzymes that are involved in glycogen metabolism leads to i) Storage of glycogen in liver -> Hepatomegaly. ii) Reduction in blood glucose -> Hypoglycemia. Examples of liver glycogenoses are - Type I glycogenosis -> Glucose - 6 - phosphatase deficiency (Von Gierke disease). Type III glycogenosis -> Debranching enzyme def Type IV glycogenesis -> Branching enzyme def Type VI glycogenosis -> Liver phosphorylase def 2) Myopathic form (Muscular glycogenoses) In skeletal muscle, as opposed to the liver, glycogen is used predominantly as a source of energy. This is derived from glycolysis, which leads ultimately to the formation of lactate. So, enzyme deficiency leads to - Glycogen deposition in muscle Muscle cramp after exercise The exercise-induced rise in blood lactate levels owing to block in glycolysis There may be myoglobinuria Examples are - Type V glycogenosis -> phosphorylase deficiency (Mc. Ardle disease). Type VII glycogenosis -> phosphofructokinase def 3) Miscellaneous types Associated with glycogen storage in many organs and death in early life.

Management of necrotizing enterocolitis Medical treatment of NEC include Cessation of feeding Nasogastric decompression Administration of i. v. fluids Systemic antibiotic against both gram +ve as well as gram -ye bacteria (after taking samples for blood culture). Ventilation should be assisted if distention is contributing to hypoxia. Early surgery consultation Surgical interventions in NEC Evidence of perforation is an indication for laparotomy and resection of necrotic bowel. Failure to respond to medical management, a single fixed bowel loop, erythema of the abdominal wall and a palpable mass are additional indications of exploratory laparotomy, resection of necrotic bowel and external ostomy diversion. Peritoneal drainage may be helpful for patients with peritonitis who are too unstable to withstand surgery. It is more successful in patients with isolated intestinal perforation. In many patients, no further surgical procedure is required. Peritoneal drainage is performed under local anaesthesia. Alpenrose drain is placed in the right lower quadrant and permitted to drain peritoneal contents and decompress the abdomen. This procedure is employed predominantly in infants less than 1000g who have severe SIRS and are viewed as too unstable to be transported or to undergo laparotomy. In experienced hands, one-third of the patients require only drain placement. A primary anastomosis at the time of initial surgery is indicated in patients with limited localized disease who have no distal bowel involvement and in patients who have demonstrated a walled-off perforation who are no longer manifesting the SIRS. From this discussion, we choose the answer to be peritoneal drainage because: Patients are on a ventilator (too unstable). Surgery for NEC is resection and creation of an ileostomy, which is not given in the options. Primary anastomosis is done only in stable patients with walled-off perforation.",

In PSGN hematuria occurs 7-21 days after respiratory infection. o Can also present with nephritic or nephrotic syndrome. o Mild to moderate hypertension. Pathology o Focal and segmental mesangial proliferation. o IgA deposition in mesangium. o Serum complement level is normal. This feature also differentiates it from PSGN. In PSGN complement (C3) level is decreased. o Whereas IgA nephropathy is an isolated renal disease, similar IgA deposits are also found in systemic disorders of children like Henoch shonlein purpura, which also have renal vasculitis as a component In view of the high frequency of IgA nephropathy in children, IgA can be used as marker for renal vasculitis.",

Constriction of the ductus postnatally involves a complex interaction of increased paial pressure of oxygen, decreased circulating prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), decreased PGE2 ductal receptors, and decreased pressure within the ductus. Subsequent vessel-wall hypoxia of the ductus promotes fuher closure through inhibition of prostaglandin and nitric oxide within the ductal wall. For premature infants, treatment with indomethacin, a prostaglandin inhibitor, is usually the first-line therapy. Ibuprofen has achieved closure rates equivalent to those of indomethacin with less renal toxicity. When PDA fails to close with indomethacin or for term infants with a persistent PDA, surgical or interventional closure is recommended. Ref: Brown D. W., Fulton D. R. (2011). Chapter 83.

A classic feature of CD is the sharp demarcation of diseased bowel segments from adjucent uninvolved bowel. When multiple bowel segments are involved, the intervening bowel is normal to skip lesions. There is serpentine linear ulcer along the axis of the bowel. As the intervening mucosa tends to be relatively spared, the mucosa acquires a coarsely textured -> Cobblestone appearance. Narrow fissures develop between the folds of the mucosa. Fissures can penetrate deeply through the bowel wall and leading to bowel adhesions and serositis. Further extension of fissures leads to fistula or sinus tract formation. There is transmural inflammation affecting all layers of the bowel wall. Sarcoid-like noncaseating granulomas may be present in all tissue layers. Neutrophilic infiltration into the crypts results in the formation of crypt abscess. Fibrosis of the submucosa, muscular propria, and mucosa eventually leads to stricture formatting.
