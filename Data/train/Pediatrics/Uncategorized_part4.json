Heart failure within the first 12 to 18 hours of life is usually a result of malformations that involve pressure or volume overload independent of pulmonary flow, as occurs with severe valvular regurgitation or a systemic aeriovenous fistula. Full-term infants presenting with severe heart failure during the remainder of the first week have critical obstruction to systemic aerial flow. Examples are aoic atresia, coarctation of the aoa, interruption of the aoic arch, and critical aoic stenosis. During the second week of life, aoic atresia and coarctation remain the most common causes of heart failure.

Causes of Vitamin A deficiency include causes of Vitamin A deficiency are inadequate intake, fat malabsorption, or liver disorders The ocular manifestations of vitamin A are collectively called xerophthalmia. It can affect any age group, but its most severe blinding complications affect children aged 6 months to 3 years. The WHO classification of vitamin A deficiency is as follows: XNNight blindness: Night blindness is the earliest clinical symptom X1A Conjunctival xerosis XIB Bitot's spot: Bitot's spots are the buildup of keratin located superficially in the conjunctiva, which are oval, triangular or irregular in shape. X2 Corneal xerosis X3A Corneal ulceration/keratomalacia involving one-third or less of the cornea X3B Corneal ulceration/keratomalacia involving one-half or more of the cornea XS Corneal scar Treatment Oral therapy: The oral regimen of vitamin A is 200, 000 IU on day of presentation, next day, and 2-4 weeks later. Children less than 1 year of age or less than 8 kg should receive half the dose of the above dose. Repeat 200, 000 IU every 6 months up to 6 years of age to prevent recurrence. Parenteral therapy: If the patient has severe disease, is unable to take oral feeds, or has malabsorption, the preferable dose is 100, 000 IU of vitamin A given intramuscularly. Children with severe measles should also receive vitamin A as they are very likely to be benefited from such therapy both in terms of saving sight and reducing case fatality. Prevention Prophylaxis consists of periodic administration of Vitamin A supplements. WHO recommended schedule, which is universally recommended is as follows: Infants 6-12 months old and any older children weighing less than 8 kg - 100, 000 IU orally every 3-6 months Children over 1 year and under 6 years of age - 200, 000 IU orally every 6 months Infants less than 6 months old, who are not being breastfed - 50, 000 IU orally should be given before they attain the age of 6 months",

These lesions have following components: - a) Obstruction to pulmonary blood flow at tricuspid right ventricular or pulmonary valve level. b) A pathway by which systemic venous blood enters the systemic circulation via a patent foramen ovale or ASD or VSD. The degree of cyanosis depends on the degree of obstruction to pulmonary blood flow: - Mild obstruction -> Cyanosis is precipitaed by stress, but may be absent at rest. Severe obstruction -> Pulmonary blood flow is dependent on patency of the ductus arteriosus. When the ductus closes (10-21 days), the neonate experience profound hypoxemia, cyanosis and shock. 2) Cyanotic CBD with increased pulmonary blood flow. This group of lesions is not associated with obstruction to pulmonary blood flow. Cyanosis caused by any of the following mechanisms. Abnormal ventricular-arterial connection (e. g., Transposition of great vessels) -> In this, aorta arises from rt ventricle, So that systemic venous blood returning to the right atrium is pumped directly back to the body, and oxygenated blood returning from lung is pumped back into the lungs. Total mixing of systemic venous and pulmonary venous blood (e. g., total anomalous pulmonary venous return, truncus arteriosus, a common atrium or ventricle) -> Deoxygenated systemic venous blood and oxygenated pulmonary venous blood mix completely in the heart and, as a result, oxygen saturation is equal in the pulmonary artery and aorta. lf pulmonary blood flow is not obstructed, these infants have a combination of Cyanosis and heart failure.

This group includes TOF, Pulmonary atresia with intact septum, tricuspid atresia, total anomalous pulmonary venous return with obstruction. These lesions have following components: - a). Obstruction to pulmonary blood flow at tricuspid right ventricular or pulmonary valve level. b)A pathway by which systemic venous blood enters the systemic circulation a patent foramen ovale or ASD or VSD. Degree of cyanosis depends on the degree of obstruction to pulmonary blood flow: - i) Mild obstruction Cyanosis is precipitaed by stress, but may be absent at rest. ii) Severe obstruction Pulmonary blood flow is dependent on patency of the ductus aeriosus. When the ductus closes (10-21 days), the neonate experience profound hypoxemia, cyanosis and shock. 2) Cyanotic CHD with increased pulmonary blood flow. This group of lesions is not associated with obstruction to pulmonary blood flow. Cyanosis caused by any of the following mechanisms. i) Abnormal ventricular-aerial connection (e. g., Transposition of great vessels) In this, aoa arises from ventricle, So that systemic venous blood returning to the right atrium is pumped directly back to the body, and oxygenated blood returning from lung is pumped back into the lungs. ii) Total mixing of systemic venous and pulmonary venous blood (e. g., total anomalous pulmonary venous return, truncus aeriosus, a common atrium or ventricle) Deoxygenated systemic venous blood and oxygenated pulmonary venous blood mix completely in the heart and, as a result, oxygen saturation is equal in the pulmonary aery and aoa.

If the vascular ring produces compression of the trachea and esophagus, symptoms are frequently present during infancy. Chronic wheezing is exacerbated by crying, feeding, and flexion of the neck. Extension of the neck tends to relieve the noisy respiration. Vomiting may also be a component. Affected infants may have a brassy cough, pneumonia, or sudden death from aspiration. Others can present in later childhood or even as teenagers or young adults with a history of respiratory symptoms that mimic asthma or exercise-induced asthma.

Osteolytic lesions can lead to pathological fractures. Skin: Commonly seen are a rash which varies from scaly erythematous lesions to red papules pronounced in interiginous areas. Up to 80% of LCH patients have extensive eruptions on the scalp. Bone marrow: Pancytopenia with superadded infection usually implies a poor prognosis.

Chronic hemolysis Irreversible sickle cells have rigid, nondeformable cell membranes that lead to difficulty in negotiating the splenic sinusoids, sequestration, and rapid phagocytosis. This results in extra-vascular hemolysis. Some intravascular hemolysis may also occur because of increased mechanical fragility of severely damaged cells. 2. Vasoocclnsive symptoms Reversible sickle cells express higher than normal levels of adhesion molecules and are abnormally sticky that is responsible for occlusion of microcirculation especially of bones, lungs, spleen and penis. Vasoocclusive symptoms are the most common manifestations of sickle cell anemia. They commonly manifest as - Painful bone crisis Hand-foot syndrome -> Dactylitis of bones of hands/feet. Autosplenectomy -> Predisposes to infection by encapsulated bacteria. Acute chest syndrome Sequestration crisis -> Acute painful enlargement of spleen. Aplastic crisis -> due to infection by parvovirus - B19 CNS symptoms -> Seizure, stroke Priapism and infarction of penis Leg ulcers Remember Sickle cell trait (heterozygous state) is almost always asymptomatic and the only significant manifestation is the renal concentrating defect presenting with isosthenuria.",

Congenital neutropenia is usually very severe and neutrophils are often completely absent in the blood of these patients at the time of diagnosis. These patients usually show arrest of maturation of neutrophils at the promyelocyte stage. - This means that their neutrophils rarely. fully mature into the cells that are capable of fighting infections. - As a result these patients usually suffer from severe infections? - Omphalitis (infection of the navel) - Pneumonia - Skin abscesses - Otitis media during their first few years of life. Pathogenesis Kostmann's syndrome or severe congenital neutropenia is believed to he caused by defect in a gene on chromosome (in p35-p34. 3) that codes for granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF). This disease is believed to be caused due to defect in receptor in granulocyte colony stimulator factor. - This receptor is located on granulocytes or neutrophils. The purpose of this receptor is the binding of the granulocyte to the cytokine (GCSF) in order to give signal to the cell to mature, to multiply, and enhance. function. GCSF is a natural cytokine produced by the human body. - Patients with congenital neutropenia also produce GCSF hut because of the defect in GCSF receptor the response of their neutrophils to the normal amounts of GCSF in the blood is reduced. - These patients will respond to higher dose of GCSF (This is the basis of tit of disease). In some patients the GCSF receptor develops changes that could also indicate progression towards leukemia. Treatment Patients with congenital neutropenia respond to administration of GCSF. - As soon as congenital neutropenia is diagnosed, patients should sta treatment with GCSF. - This treatment usually stabilizes the neutrophil count of the patient. - The response of these patients to GCSF treatment is different. There is a big variation in the dose of GCSF that different people receive. - A small group of patient does not respond to even very high doses of GCSF. In patients who do not respond to GCSF doses of 100 mcg/kg within foueen days, a search for bone marrow donor should be staed immediately and bone marrow transplantation should be performed as soon as matching donor is identified.",

(Panniculitis Inflammation of the subcutaneous, fat) Physical panniculitis Panniculitis that occurs. from physical factors Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn - It is a lobular panniculitis - It occurs in full term or post term healthy infants typically at 1-6 weeks of life or soon thereafter. - The lesion consists of one or small number of finn, nontender, erythematous nodules or plaques on the face buttocks, and or extremities. - The nodules may often break down and discharge oily material. - Over the next. few weeks or month the nodules resolve spontaneously. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is complicated by hypercalcemia - Hypercalcemia is the only significant complication and founately it occurs in minority of patients. - Manifestations of hypercalcemia include irritability. failure to thrive, hypeonia, nausea, vomiting. Pathogenesis is unknown with several hypotheses -The etiology of subcutaneous. fat necrosis is unknown but in some patients., bih trauma, asphyxia, difficult labour or hypothermia have been noted. - Perhaps diffuse tissue hypoxia predisposes to these conditions. Some believe that it occurs because of the differences in the composition of fatty acids. - In contrast to adult. fat, the subcutaneous fat of infants is thought to prone to crystal formation because of a higher content of saturated fatty acid including palmitic acid and stearic acid, and lower content of unsaturated fatty acid such as oleic acid. - The increased saturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio results in higher melting point for stored fat and promotes crystallization.

Histologically the changes are identical to those seen in subcu- taneous fat necrosis of the newborn -There is a lobular panniculitis with necrosis of adipocytes and needle shaped clefts in both adipocytes and histiocytes. Foamy histiocytes are also present. - It was believed that the withdrawl of coicosteroids therapy leads to abnormal lipid metabolism resulting in the elevation of saturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio. Sclerema Neonataram Sclerema neonatarum is much less common than subcutaneous fat necrosis but much serious and life threatening. It affects preteen and term baby. In this entity premature or term babies, develop, rapidly progressive diffuse nonedematous hardening of subcutaneous tissue beginning on the trunk or buttocks and extending to the entire body surface area. These infants have difficulty in maintaining body temperature with recurrent or persistent hypothermia. The newborns are usually sick.

        "exp": "A child with glycosuria, polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss despite increased appetite is likely to have type 1 diabetes mellitus. This form of diabetes has an impoant autoimmune component to its etiology. As many as 85% of patients have islet cell autoantibodies in their blood in the first few weeks after onset of the disease. Most of these antibodies are directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase, an enzyme that is present in b cells. Insulin deficiency leads to decreased glucose uptake and hyperglycemia. The increase in blood glucose results in increased glycosylation of hemoglobin in red blood cells. Hence, the hemoglobin A1c concentration will be increased, not decreased, reflecting long-standing hyperglycemia. Another consequence of the increased blood glucose is increased serum osmolarity (not decreased). If the osmolarity exceeds 330 m. Osm/L, consciousness begins to be impaired. beta; cell destruction in type 1 diabetes leads to decreased secretion of insulin. Since insulin and C-peptide are released on a 1: 1 ratio by the beta; cells, the secretion of C-peptide is also decreased. Insulin is first synthesized as preproinsulin, with an initial leader sequence of hydrophobic amino acids that allows the developing protein to be extruded from the ribosomes into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The \"pre\" segment is then cleaved off, leaving proinsulin. Proinsulin is packaged into secretory granules within the Golgi, and as the granules bud off, enzymes cleave the precursor into insulin and C-peptide. Ref: Klein U. (2012). Chapter 17.

It does not indicate if the rate of growth of child was normal in the recent past. The point to stress here is that it is very difficult to recognize a recent disturbance in growth by comparing weight or height with the reference standards because a clearly abnormal percentile position on the growth chart becomes evident only when the factors retarding growth are profound or if they have persisted for a considerable time.

Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome Usually begins as prodrome. The acute phase stas with the onset of erythematous rash in the periorbital and perioral area and is tender. o These erythematous rashes are soon (within hrs or days) followed by wrinkling or sloughing of the skin. o The sloughing can be provoked by stroking of the skin (Nikolsky's sign). In later stage, large flaccid bullae may develop. These bullae can cause loss of water and electrolyte. o Fever irritability and lethargy are common but systemic toxicity is not seen. o The entire illness resolves within about 10 days. Toxic epidermal necrolvsis? It is a severe form of drug reaction. Toxemia is characteristic. It is characterized by bullae that arise on widespread areas of erythema and then they slough leaving behind raw ulcerated skin. Oral mucosa especially the lips, genital mucosa and conjunctiva are ofter involved. In some cases cornea is also involved leading to corneal opacities. o Drugs commonly involved in TEN are --> Thioacetazone, INH, Sulphonamides, Phenolphthalein Stevens Jhonson syndrome? It is also a severe form of drug eruption. o Toxemia is characteristically present. o It is less severe than toxic epidermal necrolysis. In Steven's Jhonson's syndrome bullaes and epidermal detachment is seen in > 10% of total surface area.

S. usually have a primary infection at sites other than skin eg - Nasopharynx, conjunctiva, throat middle ear (otitis media). Now, about the individual diseases - Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome Usually begins as prodrome. The acute phase starts with the onset of erythematous rash in the periorbital and perioral area and is tender. These erythematous rashes are soon (within hrs or days) followed by wrinkling or sloughing of the skin. The sloughing can be provoked by stroking of the skin (Nikolsky's sign). In a later stage, large flaccid bullae may develop. These bullae can cause loss of water and electrolyte. Fever irritability and lethargy are common but systemic toxicity is not seen. The entire illness resolves within about 10 days. Toxic epidermal necrolysis - It is a severe form of drug reaction. Toxaemia is characteristic It is characterized by bullae that arise on widespread areas of erythema and then they slough leaving behind raw ulcerated skin. Oral mucosa especially the lips, genital mucosa and conjunctiva are often involved. In some cases, the cornea is also involved leading to corneal opacities. Drugs commonly involved in TEN are -> Thioacetazone, INH, Sulphonamides, Phenolphthalein Stevens Jhonson syndrome - It is also a severe form of drug eruption. Toxaemia is characteristically present. It is less severe than toxic epidermal necrolysis. In Steven's Jhonson's syndrome bullies and epidermal detachment is seen in > 10% of the total surface area.

Ilemolysis associated with ABO incompatibility exclusively occurs in type \"0\" mothers with fetuses who have type A or type B blood. - The naturally occurring antibodies in ABO blood group (A, B, AB) is of the \"IgM class\" and it cannot cross the placenta. - As compared with the other ABO blood groups that have predo- minantly IgM antibodies group 0 mothers also have significant amount of naturally occurring \"IgG antibody\". -These IgG antibodies can easily cross the placenta and produce hemolysis in, fetus. ABO incompatibility usually causes mild hemolysis and anemia. The lack of severity of hemolytic disease can be attributed to the following factors. - There is wide expression of A and B antigens not only on red cells but also in plasma and other cells which will paially neutralize maternally derived ABO antibodies. - In addition, fetal RBC's are not. fully developed in the infant and they express less number of A and B antigenic sites, hence the low incidence of significant hemolysis in affected neonates. Therefore in ABO incompatibility, hyperbilirubinemia is the predo- minaret manifestation of incompatibility (rather than anemia). The peripheral blood picture in these patients show Micro. spherocytesQ Reticulocytosis Polychromasia (not as characteristically seen as in other hemolytic anemias) Microspherocytes Spherocytes are associated with allt0i117177. Une hemolytic anemias as the cell membrane of antibody coated RBC is lost. following interaction of RBC's with splenic macrophages. The slow.. flow of blood through the spleen provides an ample oppounity for the macrophage to come in contact with coated RBC's. The macrophages subsequently removes a poion of the RBC membrane and release the RBC in the spherocy- tic form with a typically decreased surface area to volume ratio. Note: Microspherocytes are characteristically seen in of ABO incompati- bility but in the other hemolytic disease of the newborn, i. e. erythroblastosis fetalis, they are characteristically absent. Polychromasia Polychromasia can be seen in ABO incompatibility but is not characteristic as in any other hemolytic anemia Polychromasia refers to variation in erythrocyte coloration - This variation is largely related to be maturation of the erythrocytes - The younger form owing to the presence of nucleus or RNA, stains blue, with Romanowsky stains where as mature forms due to the absence of nuclear material will stain uniformly orange pink. - Polychromasia is usually seen when RBC is released prematurely from the bone 111(1i-row to compensate for the blood loss. They are usually associated with hemolysis - In these conditions there is an increased erythroid response from the bone marrow - Immature RBC's or reticulocytes move into the circulation from the bone marrow. These RBC's have nucleus (if they are upto normoblast stage, or RNA's (as in reticulocytes) - These immature BBC's stain blue with Romanowsky stains. In ABO incompatibility in the newborn hemolysis is mild, the compensatory erythroid response from the bone marrow too would be mild. That means few immature RBC's move into the circulation from bone marrow therefore polychromasia is not so prominent.",

(Note, that factor XIII is used, once the clot has formed.) Test used for evaluation of factor XIII Test used in qualitative evaluation of factor XIII is evaluation of clot stability in 5M urea.

Management of necrotizing enterocolitis Medical treatment of NEC include Cessation of feeding Nasogastric decompression Administration of i. v. fluids Systemic antibiotic against both gram +ve as well as gram -ye bacteria (after taking samples for blood culture). Ventilation should be assisted if distention is contributing to hypoxia. Early surgery consultation Surgical interventions in NEC Evidence of perforation is an indication for laparotomy and resection of necrotic bowel. Failure to respond to medical management, a single fixed bowel loop, erythema of the abdominal wall and a palpable mass are additional indications of exploratory laparotomy, resection of necrotic bowel and external ostomy diveion. Peritoneal drainage may be helpful for patients with peritonitis who are too unstable to withstand surgery. It is more successful in patients with isolated intestinal perforation. In many patients, no fuher surgical procedure is required. Peritoneal drainage is performed under local anaesthesia. A penrose drain is placed in the right lower quadrant and permitted to drain peritoneal contents and decompress the abdomen. This procedure is employed predominantly in infants less than 1000g who have severe SIRS and are viewed as too unstable to be transpoed or to undergo laparotomy. In experienced hands, one third of the patients require only drain placement. A primary anastomosis at the time of initial surgery is indicated in patients with limited localized disease who have no distal bowel involvement and in patients who have demonstrated a walled-off perforation who are no longer manifesting the SIRS. From this discussion, we choose the answer to be peritoneal drainage because: Patients is on ventilator (too unstable).

The deficient lysosomal enzyme in Krabbe disease is galactocerebrosidase (GALC; also called galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase); it normally degrades galactocerebroside to ceramide and galactose. The deficiency results in the accumulation of galactocerebroside; a toxic metabolite, psychosine, leads to the early destruction of oligodendrocytes and depletion of lipids in the cerebral white matter. The EEG shows nonspecific slowing without spikes, and the CSF protein is usually elevated (70 to 450 mg/dL). CT scanning and MRI reveal symmetrical nonenhancing areas of increased density in the internal capsules and basal ganglia. C. T. shows diffuse symmetric attenuation of the cerebellar and cerebral white matter in Alexander's disease. The onset is in infancy with a failure to thrive, psychomotor retardation, spasticity of the craniospinal musculature, and seizures. An early and progressive macrocephaly has been a consistent feature. Pathologically, there are severe destructive changes in the cerebral white matter, most intense in the frontal lobes. Distinctive eosinophilic hyaline bodies, most prominent just below the pia and around blood vessels, are seen throughout the cerebral coex, brainstem, and spinal cord. These have been identified as Rosenthal fibers and probably represent glial degradation products. C. T. scan demonstrates degeneration of the white matter most prominent in the frontal lobes. Canavan's disease. C. T. scan shows diffuse white matter degeneration primarily in the cerebral hemispheres with less involvement in the cerebellum and brainstem in Metachromatic leukodystrophy. This is another of the lysosomal (sphingolipid) storage diseases. The abnormality is the mutation of the gene for enzyme arylsulfatase A, which prevents the conversion of sulfatide to cerebroside (a major component of myelin) and results in an accumulation of the former.

Neonates with a positive bleeding history, particularly with features such as delayed bleeding, umbilical stump bleeding or miscarriages and in whom the initial panel of screening test is negative should be tested for factor XIII deficiency. The normal screening tests such as PT and PTT are normal in factor XIII deficiency because factor XIII is needed to stabilize the clot after a fibrin clot has formed, so tests used for evaluating the extrinsic or intrinsic pathways are not affected. (Note, that factor XIII is used, once the clot has formed.) Test used for evaluation of factor XIII Test used in qualitative evaluation of factor XIII is evaluation of clot stability in 5M urea. Clots formed from normal individuals remain stable in 5M urea, while clots from factor XIII deficient patient dissolve in urea. This assay detects only the most severely affected patients with 1% to 2% factor XIII deficieincy or tests. A quantitative chromogenic assay has been developed but is not yet readily available. In addition to hemorrhages these patients may have poor wound healing a high incidence of infertility among males and abortion among affected females and a high incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage.",

Other causes include ureteric folds & extrinsic obstruction by crossing lower pole vessels. Presentation o Hydronephrois revealed by maternal USG (Dilated renal pelvis but normal ureter). o Palpable renal mass in new borns or infants. o Abdominal flank or back pain typically exacerbated by drinking large volumes of liquid. o UTI/Haematuria after minimal trauma. Epidemiology Left side more commonly involved than right (Bilateral = 10%). Male more commonly involved than females (M: F = 2: 1). Initial Diagnosis by Ultrasonography o Hydronephrosis with dilated renal pelvis. Ureter i f visualized is of normal caliber (not dilated). Renal Differential function Nuclear Renography is used to determine Renal Differential function o A differential function of < 40% is considered significant and often an indication for surgical management. Management Management depends on the differential renal function and AP diameter of PUJ: - 1). Differential renal function > 40% especially when AP diameter of PUJ < 30 mm --> Conservative treatment. 2). Differential renal function < 40% especially when AP diameter of PUJ > 30 MM Surgical treatment is indicated. Pyeloplasty is the surgical procedure of choice.

Gout may develop later because of the derangement of glucose metabolism. Even if you do not remember all of the details of the presentation of these genetic diseases, you should be able to narrow the choices: Gaucher's disease and Niemann-Pick disease are lipid storage diseases, and would not be expected to produce hypoglycemia.

        "exp": "PDA in preterm neonate In previous explanations I have explained that chances of spontaneous closure of PDA are higher in premature infants as there is no structural abnormality. However, you should keep in mind that this fact is true when we are comparing the spontaneous closure of PDA between term and pre-term neonate. Overall, the percentage of spontaneous closure of PDA in preterm neonate is very low. To avoid confusion, I am explaining following facts in brief:- Normal neonate:- Ductus arteriosus closes functionally within about 15 hours of birth. FDA in term (mature) neonate:- The persistence of ductus arteriosus beyond 24 hours after birth is considered as PDA in term neonate. Spontaneous closure of PDA does not usually occur because PDA results from structural abnormality. FDA in pre-term (pre-mature) neonate:- The ductus arteriosus in pre-term neonate is not as responsive to increased oxygen content as it is in term neonate. However, there is no structural abnormality. Chances of spontaneous closure are very less (compared to normal term neonate). Chances of spontaneous closure are more than the term-neonate with PDA. However, in premature neonate, where hypoxic pulmonary disease is common place, the ductus being sensitive to hypoxia, remains open. So, it is very unlikely that spontaneous closure of PDA will occur in pre-term neonate. But chances are more when compared to term neonate with PDA (not nonnal term neonate in which ductus arteriosus closes within 15 hours of birth). Manifestations of PDA in pre-term neonate Apnea for unexplained reasons in an infant recovering from RDS; A hyperdynamic precordium, bounding peripheral pulses, wide pulse pressure, and a continuous or systolic murmur with or without extension into diastole or an apical diastolic murmur, multiple clicks resembling the shaking of dice; Carbon 'oxide retention; Increasing oxygen dependence; X-ray evidence of cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings; and Hepatomegaly Increased pulmonary blood flow and compromised ventricular function accompanying dropping pulmonary resistance in the setting of a P A is a significant risk factor for pulmonary hemorrhage. The greatest risk factor for NEC is prematurity. Any etiology which leads on to hemodynamic or hypoxic insult predisposes to NEC. PDA is common in preteen infants and it definitely causes hemodynamic stress and is a risk factor for development of NEC.",

Subsequently changes of pubey occur including breast development (thelarche), development of pubic and axillary hair (pubarche), the growth spu (peak height velocity), and onset of menstruation (menarche). Thelarche (breast development) is the first sign of pubey (Tanner stage B2). It usually begins between 8 and 10 years of age and is associated with increased estrogen production. Pubarche (development of pubic and axillary hair) is the second stage in maturation and typically occurs between 11 and 12 years of age. Axillary hair usually appears after the growth of pubic hair is complete. Menarche (onset of menstruation) usually occurs 2-3 years after thelarche at an average age of 11-13 years.

Dystrophin is `subsarcolemmal protein' localized to the inner surface of the sarcolemma of the muscle fibre. Dystrophin is part of Dystrophin - Glycoprotein sarcolenzmal complex and this protein deficiency leads to secondary loss of sarcoglycans and dystroglycans resulting in weakness of sarcolemma, causing membrane tears and muscle fibre necrosis. Clinical manifestations: Gower's sign is positive Pseudohypertrophy of the calf is seen (muscle is replaced by fat & connective tissue) Loss of muscle strength is progressive. Proximal muscles and neck flexors are involved more Leg involvement is more severe than arm involvement. Contractures of heel cords and iliotibial band occurs (by age of 6 years) progressive scoliosis develops. Complications: Chest deformity (scoliosis): Impairs pulmonary function By age of 16 and 18 years patients are predisposed to serious pulmonary fatal infections.

        "exp": "Circulatory adjustments at birth These are brought about because of a shift from placental dependance for gas exchange in the fetus to pulmonary gas exchange in the neonate. 1) Pulmonary circulation Immediately after birth lungs expand due to the first few breaths of the neonate. This causes a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance (O2 causes pulmonary vasodilatation). This results in increased flow into pulmonary trunk and arteries. The pulmonary artery pressure falls due to lowering of pulmonary vascular resistance. The pressure relations between the aorta and pulmonary trunk are reversed so that the blood flow through the ductus arteriosus is reversed -> Instead of blood flowing from the pulmonary artery to aorta, the direction of flow through ductus, is from the aorta to pulmonary trunk. Increasing oxygen saturation causes the muscle of ductus to constrict -> In full term neonates, the ductus arteriosus closes within 10 to 25 days. 2) System circulation and circulation through the heart Loss of placental circulation and clamping of the cord after birth results in an increase in systemic vascular resistance. This tends to increase the aortic blood pressure and the left ventricular systolic pressure. The loss of placental circulation results in a sudden reduction of flow through ductus venosus which closes off -> Flow through ductus venosus disappears by the 7th day of postnatal life. The loss of placental flow results in a decrease in the volume of blood returning to right atrium -> Right atrial pressure decreases. The left atrial pressure becomes higher than right atrial pressure and the septum primum which ats as a valve of fossa ovalis, approximates with the septum secundum to close off formen ovale. Functional closure of foramen ovale occurs very quickly. Over a period of months, the septum primtun and septum secundum become firmly adherent resulting in anatomical closure of the foramen ovale. After closure of ductus arteriosus, there is establishment of postnatal circulation: - The blood reaching the right atrium through IVC and SVC is emptied into the right ventricle from where it is pumped into pulmonary trunk. After coursing through lungs for gas exchange, it reaches the left atrium and ventricle. The left ventricle pumps it out for distribution in the body for oxygenation of the tissues. The venous return again comes back to right atrium through IVC and SVC. All of the blood leaving the right ventricle, after coursing through lungs, reaches the left ventricle -> The two ventricles are connected in series and therefore, the output of right and left ventricles are same (in contrast to fetal circulation, where right ventricular output is more).",

Myoclonic jerks, especially in the morning, are of variable intensity ranging from simple twitching (\"flying saucer syndrome\") to falls; consciousness is not impaired in it. It is precipitated by alcohol and sleep deprivation. Patients will have normal intelligence. The typical interictal EEG abnormality consists of a generalized 4- to 6-Hz spike or polyspike and slow-wave discharges lasting 1-20 seconds. Usually, 1-3 spikes precede each slow wave. Also know: In Generalized tonic clonic seizure EEG shows a normal background with generalized epileptiform discharges such as spike or polyspike wave complexes at 2. 5 to 4 Hz. During absence seizures there is an abrupt onset of bilaterally synchronous and symmetrical 3 Hz spike-wave discharge, irrespective of whether typical absences are simple or complex. Ictal recordings from patients with typical temporal lobe epilepsy usually exhibit 5-7 Hz, rhythmic, sharp theta activity, maximal in the sphenoidal and the basal temporal electrodes on the side of seizure origin.

Because of neutropenia, these patients suffer from severe infections e. g., omphalitis (infection of the navel), Pneumonia, Skin abscesses, otitis media. Kostmann's syndrome is believed to be caused due to defect in the receptor of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) on neutrophils (granulocytes). The purpose of this receptor is the binding of the granulocyte to the cytokine (GCSF) in order to give the signal to the cell to mature and multiply. Patients with Kostamann's syndrome produce GCSF but because of the defect in GCSF receptor the response of neutrophils to normal amounts of GCSF in the blood is reduced: However, they can respond if the amount of GCSF is increased -> These patients will respond to a higher dose of GCSE",
