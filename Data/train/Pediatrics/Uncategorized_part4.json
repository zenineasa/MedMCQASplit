Treatment o First line treatment for enuresis is behavioral therapy. It consists of rewarding the child for being dry at night, child should void before retiring and the use of conditioning devices (e.g. bed alarm that rings when the child wets a special sheet). o Consistent dry bed training with positive reinforcement has a success rate of 85% and bed and pad alarm systems have a success rate of approximately 75% with relapse rate that are lower than those with pharmacotherapy. o Pharmacotherapy is second line treatment and should be reserved for those patients who have failed behavioural therapy.

        "question": "2 days after bih, child developed respiratory distress and had scaphoid abdomen. Breath sounds were decreased on the left side. After bag and mask ventilation, ET tube was put and the maximal cardiac impulse shifted to the right side. What should be the next step in management?",
        "exp": "Confirm the position of endotracheal tube This is a case of congenital diaphragmatic hernia The clinical features suggesting this are:? - Respiratory distress after bih with decreased air entry on the left side - Scaphoid abdomen - Mediastinal shift A diaphragmatic hernia is defined as a communication between the abdominal and thoracic cavities with or without abdominal content in the thorax. The most common form of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is the posterolateral (Bockdalek) type, which occurs through a defect in the pleuroperitoneal membrane. These hernias are found on the left side in over 80%. Right sided hernias are less common and less severe because the liver prevents the bowel from passing into the thorax. They rarely occur through an anterior defect in the foramen of Morgagni. The stomach, small bowel, colon, spleen and left hepatic lobe may all enter the pleural cavity through a left sided diaphragmatic defect. The most serious defect associated with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia is hypoplasia of the ipsilateral lung. This results from compression of the pulmonary parenchyma by the visceral contents of the hernia and the contralateral displacement of the mediastinum. Postnatally, infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia develop dyspnea and cyanosis which worsens as swallowed air fuher distends the herniated stomach. Respiratory distress manifests as gasping respirations and cyanosis. Infants with respiratory distress within 6 hours of bih are most likely to have severe lung hypoplasia and lower chance of survival. These infants have minimal normal lung tissue and decreased pulmonary reserve, hence their respiratory insufficiency manifests rapidly. Dextrocardia and lack of breath sounds on the left side are strong indications of diaphragmatic hernia. Instead of the normally rounded abdominal appearance, there is often a scaphoid or flattened abdomen because of diminished intraabdominal contents. Management of congenital diaphragmatic hernia Historically the management of hernia focussed on the actual repair of the diaphragmatic hernia but the contemporary management of diaphragmatic hernia places emphasis on the management of pulmonary hypoplasia and persistent pulmonary hypeension. Now the initial management consists of aggressive respiratory suppo. Stabilization of the respiratory system is the first and most impoant goal in the treatment. This is accomplished by immediate postnasal endotracheal intubation and assissted ventilation (But bag and mask ventilation is contraindicated in congential diaphragmatic hernia because it causes gaseous distension of bowel). Conventional mechanical ventilation, high frequency oscillation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are the three main strategies to suppo respiratory failure. These therapies maintain oxygenation. Attempts at lung re-expansion with mechanical ventilation must be gentle since excessive force will overdistend the hypoplastic lung and cause rupture and tension pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube is immediately placed in the stomach to aspirate the swallowed air Surgical repair The ideal time to repair the diaphragmatic defect is under the debate. Most centres will wait at least 48 hr after stabilization and resolution of pulmonary hypeension. Now coming back to the Question Mediastinum shifted to the right after endotracheal intubation. This suggests the possibility of incorrect placement of the tube into the esophagus. - Intubation in esophagus will result in fuher distension of the stomach and bowel loops in the left hemithorax which would consequently shift the mediastinum and apical impulse to the right. The ideal step in this situation would be to remove the tube and do the intubation again. Some says that option 'd' was \"confirmation of the position of endotracheal tube by chest X-ray\". Method for confirmation of position of tube Chest X-ray (PA view) cannot confirm the position of the endotracheal tube because esophagus is situated immediately behind the trachea. X-ray (PA) view cannot distinguish b/w them. CDH is an acute emergency and there is no time for chest X-ray to be done to confirm the position of the endotracheal. If clinical features suggest misplacement of the tube it is better to remove the tube and attempt the intubation again. Confirmation of the position of the endotracheal tube can be done by capnography as it would take no time, because the patient is already in I. C. U. setting.",

Selective mutism is defined as a failure to speak in specific social situations, despite speaking in other situations; it is typically a symptom of an underlying anxiety disorder. Children with selective mutism can speak normally in ceain settings, such as within their home or when they are alone with their parents, but do not speak in other social settings, such as at school or at other places outside their home.

Infant CPR guidelines apply to victims less than approximately 1 year of age.\nChild CPR guidelines for the lay rescuer apply to children about 1 to 8 years of age, and adult guidelines for the lay rescuer apply to victims about 8 years of age and older.

A) Left to right shunts. (ASD, VSD, PDA) B) Obstructive lesions (PS, AS, Coarctation of aoa). A) Left to right shunts Patients with left to right shunts have following features : ? 1. Frequent respiratory tract infection --4 Because pulmonary circulation is overloaded which may result in pulmonary edema, CHF and infection. 2. No cyanosis --> Most of the blood is in pulmonary circulation. So there is no impairment in oxygenation of blood. 3. Precardial buldge --> Frequent chest infections with tachypnea causes the soft rib cage being drawn inward at the diaphragmetic attachments of the ribs. This combined with cardioamegaly gives them a precordial buldge. 4. Hyperkinetic precordium 5. Delayed diastolic murmur in tricuspid or mitral area --> Due to increased flow through these areas depending on the type of CHDs. 6. Cardiomegaly with plethoric pulmonary vasculature on chest X-ray Due to increased flow through pulmonary circulation (plethoric lung) there is increased volume overload to left side of hea ---> Cardiomegaly. B) Obstructive lesions o Obstructive congenital diseases have following features. 1) Absence offrequent chest infection --> Pulmonary circulation is not overloaded. 2) Absence of cyanosis ---> No defect in pulmonary oxygenation and there is no shunt where aerial and venous blood can mix. 3) Absence of precardial buldge There is no chest infection or Cardiomegaly. 4) Heaving (forcible) cardiac impulse --> Obstructive lesions cause concentric hyperophy of ventricles that produce forcible contraction. 5) Systolic thrill due to systolic ejection murmur --4 When hyperophied ventricles forcibly pump the blood through stenotic pulmonary or aoic valve, systolic thrill and systolic ejection murmur are produced. 6)Absence of delayed diastolic murmur in mitral or tricuspid area --> Blood flow through these area is not increased. 7)Presence of delayed corresponding second sound (A2 in AS and P2 in PS) --> Because prolonged flow through these area results in delayed closure of that valve. 8)Normal sized hea and pulmonary vasculature in chest x-ray --> There is concentric hyperophy, i.e., hyperophy without dilatation.

It is a neuroendocrine tumor, arising from any neural crest element of the sympathetic nervous system. o Neuroblastoma is a disease of early childhood with approximately 90% of patients presenting before 5-years of age and almost 50% within the first 2-years of life. o In childhood, about 40% of neuroblastomas arise in the adrenal medulla0. The remainder occur anywhere along the sympathetic chain, with the most common locations being the paraveebral region of the abdomen (25%) and posterior mediastinum (15%). Tumours may arise in numerous other sites, including the pelvis and neck and within the brain (cerebral neuroblastomas). o It is the second most common solid malignancy of childhood. o In young children, under age 2 years, neuroblastomas generally present with large abdominal masses, fever, and possibly weight loss. In older children, they may not come to attention until metastases produce manifestations, such as bone pain, respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints. o Neuroblastomas may metastasize widely (Present in 60-70%- Ghai 7th/5990) through the hematogenous and lymphatic systems, paicularly to liver, lungs, and bones, in addition to the bone marrow. o Proptosis and ecchymosis may also be present because the periorbital region is a common metastatic site. Bladder and bowel dysfunction may be caused by paraspinal neuroblastomas that impinge on nerves. o In neonates, disseminated neuroblastomas may present with multiple cutaneous metastases with deep blue discoloration to the skin (earning the rather unfounate designation of \"blueberry muffin baby)\" About 90% of neuroblastomas, regardless of location, produce catecholamines (similar to the catecholamines associated with pheochromocytomas), which are an impoant diagnostic feature (i.e., elevated blood levels of catecholamines and elevated urine levels of metabolites, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and homovanillic acid (HVA) Children older than age 5 years usually have extremely poor outcomes irrespective of stage (Robbins 7\"/500-503) o NB can present as a parenoplastic syndrome of autoimmune origin manifesting as ataxia or opsomyoclonus (\"dancing eye & dancing feet\").",

        "exp": "Premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome present with progressively worsening retractions, tachypnea, and oxygen requirements because their lungs are too immature to synthesize surfactant. This disease has a characteristic radiographic pattern that includes \"ground glass\" opacities in the lung parenchyma and prominent air bronchograms. Initial therapy for respiratory distress syndrome involves using CPAP to stent open the airways, thereby reducing the collapse of the alveoli and limiting fuher damage. For intubated infants with respiratory distress syndrome, the second intervention involves surfactant administration through the ET tube. This procedure can result in rapid changes in pulmonary compliance. Ref: Wood K.S., Gordon P.V. (2011). Chapter 4. Neonatal and Pediatric Transpo. In J.E. Tintinalli, J.S. Stapczynski, D.M.

Shivering On exposure to cold and wet environment, the neonate tries to generate heat by increased activity (crying with agitated movement) and a sympathetic surge that causes vasoconstriction and non-shivering thermogenesis in the brown fat. Babies attempt to conserve heat by peripheral vasoconstriction.\" \"Brown fat is a well-vascularized, sympathetically innervated lipid collection located in the axillae, groin, nape of the neck, interscapular area and perinea! area. Cold stress causes the release of norepinephrine that uncouples beta-oxidation in fat with resultant heat generation. Preterm and small-for-gestational age infants have immature thermogenic response because of scanty brown fat stores.\" Role of Brown Fat in Thermogenesis A newborn baby is more prone to develop hypothermia because of large surface area per unit of body weight. In infants, brown fat is an impoant site of thermogenesis. It results in the so-called non-shivering thermogenesis. Brown fat is located around the adrenal glands, kidney, nape of neck, interscapular and axillary region. Metabolism of brown fat leads to heat production. Blood flowing through the brown fat becomes warm and through circulation, transfers heat to other pas of the body. This mechanism oh heat production is known as non-shivering thermogenesise.Q",

As the intervening mucosa tends to be relatively spared, the mucosa acquires a coarsely textured Cobblestone appearance. o Narrow fissures develop between the folds of the mucosa. Fissures can penetrate deeply through the bowel wall and leading to bowel adhesions and serositis. o Fuher extension of fissures leads to fistula or sinus tract formation. o There is transmural inflammation affecting all layers of bowel wall. Sarcoid like noncaseating granulomas may be present in all tissue layers. o Neutrophilic infiltration into the crypts results in formation of crypt abscess. o Fibrosis of the submucosa, muscularis propria, and mucosa eventually leads to stricture formation.

Three clinical subtypes are recognized: SMA I: The most devastating.

        "exp": "Type 3 hypersensitivity Immunologically mediated adverse drug been reactions have AND classified according to the GELL COOMBS CLASSIFICATION. The 4 types are: Immediate hypersensitivity - It occurs when the drug or drug metabolite interacts with preformed drug specific IgE antibodies that are bound to the surfaces of tissue mast cells and/or circulating basophils. Clinically manifests with uicaria, bronchospasm and anaphylaxis Cytotoxic reactions - Involve IgG or IgM antibodies that recognize drug antigen on cell membrane. In the presence of serum complement, the antibody coated cell is either cleared by the monocytes or macrophage system or is destroyed. Examples include drug induced hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia. Immune complex reactions (Type /I hypersensitivity) - It is caused by soluble complexes of drug or metabolite in slight antigen excess with IgG or IgM antibodies. The immune complex is deposited in blood vessel walls and causes injury by activating the complement cascade as seen in serum sickness. Clinical manifestations include fever, uicaria, rash, lymphadenopathy, and ahralgias. Symptoms typically appear 1-3 weeks after the last dose of an offending drug and subside when the drug and/or its metabolites are cleared from the body. Delayed hypersensitivity - These are mediated by drug specific T lymphocytes. Commonly implicated drugs include neomycin and local anesthetics in topical formulations. \"Serum sickness like reactions in which immune complexes have not been documented, which occur most commonly with cefaclor, may result from an inherited propensity for hepatic biotransformation of drugs into toxic or immunogenic metabolites.\"",

Presentation and course depends on size of the ductus and the pulmonary vascular resistance. Clinical features of a large ductus are failure to thrive, tachypnea, and diaphoresis with feeds. Left-to-right shunt with normal pulmonary vascular resistance. PDA is the persistence of the normal fetal vessel joining the pulmonary aery to the aoa. It closes spontaneously in normal-term infants at 1-5 days of age. PDA accounts for 10% of all congenital hea disease. It is twice as common in females as in males. The clinical findings and course depend on the size of the shunt and the degree of pulmonary hypeension. Moderate to Large Patent Ductus Aeriosus: Pulses are bounding, and pulse pressure is widened due to diastolic runoff through the ductus. S1 is normal and S2 is usually narrowly split.The murmur is characteristic. It is a rough machinery murmur maximal at the second left intercostal space. Patent Ductus Aeriosus with Increased Pulmonary Vascular Resistance: Flow across the ductus is diminished. S2 is single and accentuated, and no significant hea murmur is present.

Haemodynamics : The inflow poion of R.V. is hypoplastic The systemic venous blood coming to R.A. exits by way of a patent foramen ovale or an ASD. A VSD provides communication between L.V. and outflow poion of R.V. o The L.V. thus maintains both the systemic and pulmonary circulation. The saturation of blood in the pulmonary aery and aoa is identical --> Because unoxygenated blood from right atrium mixes with oxygenated blood into left atrium. The pulmonary blood flow is dependent on size of VSD --> Smaller the VSD, less the pulmoanry blood flow. Clinical features : Child is cyanotic from bih Anoxic spells and squatting may be present.

        "exp": "Galactose Characteristic symptom i.e., vomiting, distended abdomen and diarrhea along with the presence of reducing substance in the urine suggests the diagnosis of galactosemia Benedict's Test Benedict's test is a biochemical test to detect reducing sugars. -Benedicts test detects the presence of aldehydes except (aromatic ones) and alpha hydroxyketones in a compound. All monosaccharides are reducing sugars i.e., they all have a free reactive aldehyde group and are positive on Benedicts. Some disaccharides such as fructose have alpha hydroxyl ketones and can reduce sugars. All other disaccharides are non reducing sugars and will not react with Benedict's solution Galactosemia Galactosemia is a group of inherited metabotic disorders in which an enzyme deficiency affects the normal metabolism of the sugar galactose Galactose is a monosaccharide Most of the galactose originates from the dairy products that contain lactose or milk sugar Lactose is a disaccharide that is catalyzed by the enzyme lactase into two monosaccharides i.e. lactose and glucose From the intestine the galactose is transpoed to liver where it is conveed to glucose phosphate, which can be used in several metabolic pathway. Conversion of Galactose to Gulose I phosphate occurs in several successive steps. A specific enzyme is required at each step Galactosemia occurs because of the deficiency of any of the enzymes involved in the metabolism of Galactose. The most common enzyme associated with galactosemia is the deficiency of the enzyme galactose -1- phosphate uridyl trans-ferase. The deficiency of the enzyme or the defect in the metabolism results in an accumulation of galactose -1- PO4 and galacticol that are thought to have direct toxic effect on the liver and other organs. Clinical features Infants with galactosemia appear normal at bih, however symptomsusually appear a few days to weeks after initiating galactose containing .feeds The early clinical features of severe galactosemia include liver dysfunction, manifested by jaundice and hypoglycemia, The accompanying gastrointestinal.findings are poor feeding, vomiting and diarrhoea. Due to the effect of galacticol toxicity on brain it may cause C.N.S symptoms to predominate which are irritability and seizures Diagnosis If galactosemia is suspected, urine should be tested simultaneously with Benedicts reagent and with Glucose oxidase method. - The Glucose oxidase method is specific for glucose, whereas - Benedict's reagent can detect any reducing substance -A negative glucose oxidase test with positive benedicts test suggests that a non glucose reducing substance is present. - With appropriate clinical findings this is most likely to be galactose Confirmatory diagnosis The confirmatory diagnosis is made by the enzyme assay.",

The caecum is undescended, i.e., situated in the right hypochondrium and abnormally fixed by peritoneal bands running laterally across the second pa of duodenum. o The poorly attached small bowel undergoes volvulus around the axis of the 'universal mesentery', which is twisted so that the flow of blood is cut off, producing a strangulating obstruction of the small bowel. This typically occurs in the newborn, hence the term Volvulus neonatorum'. The terminal ileum and caecum are drawn into the volvulus and are wrapped around the stalk of the mesentery in two or three tight coils. Clinical feature o A young infant, previously healthy, stas bile-stained vomiting during the first few days of the live. Abdomen is soft and non-distended; however, abdominal distension may occur which is limited to upper abdomen (epigastrium). o No obstruction may occur in the first day or two after bih and meconium may be passed normally. Then, with variable suddenness, bowel actions cease with onset of obstruction. o The signs vary, depending on the degree of intestinal obstruction versus ischemia. When strangulation occurs there are signs of schock, especially pallor and a vague mass of congested bowel may be palpable in the centre of abdomen. Blood or blood-tinged mucus may be passed rectally. o Ischemia may result in gangrene and perforation. Investigations o Barium contrast studies with fluoroscopy (Barium meal follow through) is the investigation of choice as X-ray is not reliable in early stages of volvulus. o However, if the perforation is suspected, barium contrast should not be used because of risk of perotinitis. Water soluble contrast studies (iodine based) should be used.
