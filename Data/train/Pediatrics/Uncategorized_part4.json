TAPVC Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) is characterized by abnormal drainage of pulmonary veins into the right hea either by direct connection into the right atrium or into its tributaries. According to the site or level of connection of the pulmonary veins to the systemic venous system TAPVC has been classified into four types:-Type I (most common: 45%): Anomalous connection at supracardiac level (PV drains into left innominate vein or SVC). Type II (25%): Anomalous connection at cardiac level (PV joins the coronary sinus or enter right atrium directly). Type III (25%): Anomalous connection at infracardiac level (PV drain into poal vein). Type IV (5%): Anomalous connection at multiple levels. Infracardiac type of TAPVC is always obstructive whereas cardiac and supracardiac type may be obstructive or nonobstructive. X-ray findings of TAPVCCardiomegaly. Plethoric lung fields.

For pretenn infants of more than 34 weeks of gestation, it is possible that breast or bottle feeding can be adopted as they should be able to coordinate sucking, swallowing and breathing. But for those younger infants who may have compromised respiration or be neurologically less well developed, this may not be advisable and nutrients may need to be passed into the stomach through a fine tube either through the mouth (oro-gastric tube) or the nose (naso-gastric tube). Nasogastric tube increases the airway impedance and work of breathing, therefore, the orogastric tube is preferred over nasogastric tube. Breast milk is the food of choice as it is best tolerated and includes other benefits as well as nutrition.

Clinically manifests with uicaria, bronchospasm and anaphylaxis Cytotoxic reactions - Involve IgG or IgM antibodies that recognize drug antigen on cell membrane. In the presence of serum complement, the antibody coated cell is either cleared by the monocytes or macrophage system or is destroyed. Examples include drug induced hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia. Immune complex reactions (Type /I hypersensitivity) - It is caused by soluble complexes of drug or metabolite in slight antigen excess with IgG or IgM antibodies. The immune complex is deposited in blood vessel walls and causes injury by activating the complement cascade as seen in serum sickness. Clinical manifestations include fever, uicaria, rash, lymphadenopathy, and ahralgias. Symptoms typically appear 1-3 weeks after the last dose of an offending drug and subside when the drug and/or its metabolites are cleared from the body. Delayed hypersensitivity - These are mediated by drug specific T lymphocytes. Commonly implicated drugs include neomycin and local anesthetics in topical formulations. \"Serum sickness like reactions in which immune complexes have not been documented, which occur most commonly with cefaclor, may result from an inherited propensity for hepatic biotransformation of drugs into toxic or immunogenic metabolites. \"",

Presentation and course depends on size of the ductus and the pulmonary vascular resistance. Clinical features of a large ductus are failure to thrive, tachypnea, and diaphoresis with feeds. Left-to-right shunt with normal pulmonary vascular resistance. PDA is the persistence of the normal fetal vessel joining the pulmonary aery to the aoa. It closes spontaneously in normal-term infants at 1-5 days of age. PDA accounts for 10% of all congenital heart disease. It is twice as common in females as in males. The clinical findings and course depend on the size of the shunt and the degree of pulmonary hypertension. Moderate to Large Patent Ductus Aeriosus: Pulses are bounding, and pulse pressure is widened due to diastolic runoff through the ductus. S1 is normal and S2 is usually narrowly split. The murmur is characteristic. It is a rough machinery murmur maximal at the second left intercostal space. Patent Ductus Aeriosus with Increased Pulmonary Vascular Resistance: Flow across the ductus is diminished. S2 is single and accentuated, and no significant heart murmur is present.

It is recommended to continue with the same treatment. o Moderate weight gain is 5-10 g/kg/day; food intake should be checked and the children should be screened for systemic infection. Poor weight gain is < 5g/kg/day, screening for inadequate feeding, untreated infection, tuberculosis and psychological problems is recommended. Indicators of failure to respond Primary failure to respond is indicated by: Failure to regain appetite by day 4. Failure to sta losing edema by day 4. o Presence of edema on day 10. Failure to gain at least 5. g/kg/day by day 10. o Secondary failure to respond is indicated by failure to gain at least 5g/kg/day for 3 consecutive days during the rehabilitation phase. Criteria for discharge o Severely malnourished children are ready for discharge when the following criteria have been fulfilled: (i) Absence of infection. (ii) The child is eating at least 120-130 cal/kg/day and receiving adequate micronutrients. (iii) There is consistent weight gain (of at least 5 g/kg/day for 3 consecutive days) on exclusive oral feeding.

All monosaccharides are reducing sugars i. e., they all have a free reactive aldehyde group and are positive on Benedicts. Some disaccharides such as fructose have alpha hydroxyl ketones and can reduce sugars. All other disaccharides are non reducing sugars and will not react with Benedict's solution Galactosemia Galactosemia is a group of inherited metabotic disorders in which an enzyme deficiency affects the normal metabolism of the sugar galactose Galactose is a monosaccharide Most of the galactose originates from the dairy products that contain lactose or milk sugar Lactose is a disaccharide that is catalyzed by the enzyme lactase into two monosaccharides i. e. lactose and glucose From the intestine the galactose is transpoed to liver where it is conveed to glucose phosphate, which can be used in several metabolic pathway. Conversion of Galactose to Gulose I phosphate occurs in several successive steps. A specific enzyme is required at each step Galactosemia occurs because of the deficiency of any of the enzymes involved in the metabolism of Galactose. The most common enzyme associated with galactosemia is the deficiency of the enzyme galactose -1- phosphate uridyl trans-ferase. The deficiency of the enzyme or the defect in the metabolism results in an accumulation of galactose -1- PO4 and galacticol that are thought to have direct toxic effect on the liver and other organs. Clinical features Infants with galactosemia appear normal at bih, however symptomsusually appear a few days to weeks after initiating galactose containing. feeds The early clinical features of severe galactosemia include liver dysfunction, manifested by jaundice and hypoglycemia, The accompanying gastrointestinal. findings are poor feeding, vomiting and diarrhoea. Due to the effect of galacticol toxicity on brain it may cause C. N.

The caecum is undescended, i. e., situated in the right hypochondrium and abnormally fixed by peritoneal bands running laterally across the second pa of duodenum. o The poorly attached small bowel undergoes volvulus around the axis of the 'universal mesentery', which is twisted so that the flow of blood is cut off, producing a strangulating obstruction of the small bowel. This typically occurs in the newborn, hence the term Volvulus neonatorum'. The terminal ileum and caecum are drawn into the volvulus and are wrapped around the stalk of the mesentery in two or three tight coils. Clinical feature o A young infant, previously healthy, stas bile-stained vomiting during the first few days of the live. Abdomen is soft and non-distended; however, abdominal distension may occur which is limited to upper abdomen (epigastrium). o No obstruction may occur in the first day or two after bih and meconium may be passed normally. Then, with variable suddenness, bowel actions cease with onset of obstruction. o The signs vary, depending on the degree of intestinal obstruction versus ischemia. When strangulation occurs there are signs of schock, especially pallor and a vague mass of congested bowel may be palpable in the centre of abdomen. Blood or blood-tinged mucus may be passed rectally. o Ischemia may result in gangrene and perforation. Investigations o Barium contrast studies with fluoroscopy (Barium meal follow through) is the investigation of choice as X-ray is not reliable in early stages of volvulus. o However, if the perforation is suspected, barium contrast should not be used because of risk of perotinitis. Water soluble contrast studies (iodine based) should be used.

        "exp": "Ans. is `b' i. e., ASD ASD is associated with an enlarged right atrium & right ventricle to accommodate large volume of blood. The left atrium is not enlarged because it decompresses itself by shunting blood to the right atrium at a minor difference in pressure. The left atrium may enlarge once Eisenmenger 's syndrome develops and a reversal of shunt is seen across the defect. All congenital heart diseases given in option cause left to right shunt. Size of left atrium in left to right shunts o In left to right shunt, blood enters from left side of hea (Lt. atrium, Lt ventricle or aoa) to right side of hea (Rt atrium, Rt ventricle or pulmonary aery) depending on the site of abnormal communication. o This blood then flows through pulmonary circulation and again enters the left atrium. o The path of blood is then depending on the defect. o In all these defects, left atrium recieves larger volume of blood which comes through pulmonary circulation --> Blood from right side of hea plus some blood from left side of hea because of shunt enter into pulmonary circulation and then into left atrium. So left atrium recieve blood volume larger than normal. o But the effect of larger volume on left atrium will be different in ASD and other left to right shunts. 1). In ASD Left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, but founate for the left atrium, it also has an extra exit for blood, i. e., septal defect. So, larger volume of blood is decompressed through left atrium. i) Amount, which is normally exits through AV valve (mitral valve) into left ventricle. ii) Extra amount, which left atrium recieves, exits through septal defect into right atrium. 2) Other left to right shunts (VSD, PDA, Aoopulmonary window). In these defects also, left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, But there is no extra exit. So, left atrium can pump out only normal amount of blood through mitral valve, and extra volume remains in the left atrium --> Volume over load --> Left atrial enlargement.",

        "exp": "Before comparing the symptoms of PDA & Aortopulmonary window let me discuss the C/F of PDA. Patent ductus arteriosus is a communication between pulmonary artery and Aorta after fetal life. PDA results in left to right shunt from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. The flow occurs both during systole and diastole as a pressure gradient is present throughout the cardiac cycle between the 2 great arteries. This flow of blood results in continuous murmur it is usually heard at 2nd left interspace. In patients with large left to right shunt a low pitched mitral mid diastolic murmur is audible at the apex, owing to the increased volume of blood flow across the mitral valve. There are other conditions which can produce systolic and diastolic murmur in the pulmonary area such as Aortopulmonary window defect. In Aortopulmonary window defect there is communication between the ascending aorta and main pulmonary artery. Usually the defect is large therefore the pressure between the two great arteries tends to equalize and flow is established only during systole when left ventricular contraction increases the aortic pressure. So the murmur in Aortopulmonary window defect is systolic with mid diastolic rumble due to increased blood flow through mitral valve. Sometimes when the Aortopulmonary window defect is small, there is continuous blood flow from Aorta to pulmonary artery resulting in continuous murmur. In this condition symptoms of Aorticopulmonary window defect mimics the symptoms of PDA (Continuous murmur, wide pulse pressure, mid diastolic murmur). It is very difficult to distinguish between the 2 condition. Chances of spontaneous closure in PDA in term infant is rare (chances of spontaneous closure of PDA is more in preterm infants.) If diagnosis of PDA can be made within the first - two weeks, indomethacin can be given to close the defect. (But since the child is one year old Indomethacin is of no help). In PDA there is increased risk of infective endocarditis.",

The test will also see how baby's heart rate is affected by your contraction.

        "exp": "Bronchiolitis obliterans Bronchiolitis obliterans. is a rare chronic lung disease of the bronchioles and smaller airways Bronchiolitis obliterans most commonly occurs in pediatric population after respiratory infections (i. e. adenovirus, mycoplasma, measles, influenza, pertussis). Other causes include connective tissue disease (i. e. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, scleroderma) Bronchiolitis occurs in all age groups. Pathogenesis After the initial insult, inflammation affecting terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts may result in obliteration of the airway lumen. Epithelial damage resulting in abnormal repair is characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans. Complete or partial obstruction of the airway lumen may result in air trapping or atelactasis. Clinical manifestations Cough, fever, cyanosis and respiratory distress followed by initial improvement may be the initial signs of bronchiolitis obliterans. Progression of the disease may ensue with increasing dyspnoea, cough, sputum production and wheezing. Chest radiographs may be relatively normal compared with the extent of physical findings but may demonstrate hyperluscency and patchy infiltrates (occasionally, a swyer James syndrome, i. e. a unilateral hyperluscent lung has developed). Pulmonary function tests demonstrate varaible findings but typically shows signs of airway obstruction. Ventilation perfusion scan shows a typical motheaten appearance of multiple matched defects in ventilation and perfusion. CT scan demonstrates patchy areas of hyperluscency. Open lung biopsy or transbronchial biopsy remains the best means of establishing the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans. Treatment No definite therapy exists for bionchiolitis obliterans. Administration of corticosteroids may be beneficial About other options Follicular bronchitis It is a lyinphoproliferative lung disorder characterized the presence of lymphoid follicles, coursing along the airways (bronchi or bronchioles) It is rare in children. Although the cause is unknown, an infectious aetiology has been proposed. Onset of symptoms generally occurs by 6 weeks of age and peaks between 6 and 18 months. Cough, moderate fever and fine crackles are common clinical findings. Fine crackles generally, persist over time and recurrence of symptoms is common. Chest radiographs may be relatively benign initially but evolve into the typical interstitial pattern. Pulmonary function tests show restrictive pattern Chest CT shows fine reticular pattern. Open lung biopsy is used to make definitive diagnosis. Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis This is a rare disorder. Although the underlying cause of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is unknown, the disease is characterized by the formation of lamellar concretions of calcium phosphate or \"inicrolith\", within the alveoli, creating a classic pattern on the radiograph. Chest radiography typically reveal bilateral infiltrates with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance. Although the mean age at the time of diagnosis is in the mid 30s the onset of the disease can occur during childhood. When symptomatic, individuals with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis usually complain of dyspnoea on exertion and non productive cough. Physical examinations of the lungs may reveal fine inspiratory crackles and diminished breath sounds. Clubbing occurs, although this is usually a more advanced sign. Children are often asymptomatic on initial presentation. Diagnosis Chest radiography typically reveals b/L infiltrate with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance or \"Sandstorm\" appearance. CT scan shows diffuse micronodular calcified densities. Open lung biopsy reveals laminated calcific ioncretions within the alceoli.",

        "exp": "Bronchiolitis obliterans is a rare chronic obstructive lung disease characterized by complete obliteration of the small airways following a severe insult. The most common form in children is postinfectious, following a lower airway tract infection with adenovirus, although influenza, rubeola, Bordetella, and Mycoplasma are also implicated. Persons with bronchiolitis obliterans usually experience dyspnea, coughing, and exercise intolerance. This diagnosis should be considered in children with persistent cough, wheezing, crackles, or hypoxemia persisting longer than 60 days following a lower respiratory tract infection. Chest radiograph abnormalities include evidence of heterogeneous air trapping and airway wall thickening. Ventilation-perfusion scans show a pattern of ventilation and perfusion mismatch. Pulmonary angiograms reveal decreased vasculature in involved lung, and bronchograms show marked pruning of the bronchial tree. Classic findings on chest high-resolution CT include a mosaic perfusion pattern, vascular attenuation, and central bronchiectasis. Suppoive care including supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia, routine vaccination, avoidance of environmental irritant exposure, exercise, and nutritional suppo should be provided. Ongoing airway damage due to problems such as aspiration should be prevented. Inhaled bronchodilators may reverse airway obstruction if the disease has a reactive component. Coicosteroids (inhaled, daily, or pulse dosing) may help reverse the obstruction or prevent ongoing damage. Ref: Federico M. J., Stillwell P., Deterding R. R., Baker C.

Leucine levels are usually higher than those of other three amino acids. Urine contains high levels of leucine, isoleucine and valine and their respective ketoacids.

Signs and symptoms of LCHAD deficiency typically appear during infancy or early childhood and can include feeding difficulties, lethargy, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, liver problems, and abnormalities in the light-sensitive tissue at the retina. Later in childhood, people with this condition may experience muscle pain, breakdown of muscle tissue, and peripheral neuropathy.

Loss in weight can be seen in both acute and chronic malnutrition. Indicators of malnutrition Indicator Interpretation * Stunting Low height for age Indicator for chronic malnutrition, the result of prolonged food deprivation and/or disease or illness * Wasting Low weight for height Suggests acute malnutrition, the result of more recent food deficit or illness * Under weight Low weight for age Combined indicator to reflect both acute and chronic malnutrition More explanation is needed for weight for height. Weight for height is the ratio of the patients actual weight to ideal weight for the patients height. When acute medical condition results in sho term nutritional deprivement the body weight is depleted out of propoional to the length for height and the weight for height value is low. Conversely chronic malnutrition affects both weight gain and linear growth resulting in a small child with a body weight that is more propoional to length, So weight Jar height cannot diagnose chronic malnutrition. Weight for age If there is acute malnutrition there will be weight loss. Weight loss will occur in chronic malnutrition to. So weight for age decreases in both acute and chronic malnutrition.

T. system are involved & produce abnormal visid mucous. The gene is located on the chromosome-7. Most patients with CF present in childhood. Approx 18% of patients present within the first 24 hr of life with Gastrointestinal obstruction, termed Meconium ileus. Other systems dysfunctions are not present at birth, they may manifest within the first year or two of life including respiratory tract system. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of a high sweat chloride (>60 m. Eq/L) on repeated measurements. Pathophysiology of high sweat chloride Cystic fibrosis patients secrete nearly normal volumes of sweat in the sweat acinus. However, CF patients are not able to absorb Na. C1 from sweat as it moves through the sweat duct due to the inability to absorb Cl- across the ductal epithelial cells. This dysfunction in the sweat gland is typically measured by collecting sweat after iontophoresing a cholinergic agonist into the forearm.",

        "exp": "Amongst the given options, hypoplastic left heart syndrome causes CHF in First week. Different congenital diseases have different time of onset of CHF: - 1) Left to right shunt At birth, pulmonary vascular resistance is high, i. e., the pressure on rt side of circulation is high -> Pulmonary pressure is almost equal to systemic pressure. So, left to right shunt is small, whether the communication is atrial, ventricular or pulmonary artery level. As the neonate grows, pulmonary vascular resistance falls with maximum fall at the age of six to eight weeks (Note - In normal neonate, maximum fall is between 1 to 3 weeks). This is the time (six to eight weeks) when the size of shunt is maximum as pulmonary vascular resistance is least at this time. So, patients with left to right shunts tend to develop CCF around six to eight weeks of life. 2) Right to left shunt Patients with right to left shunt may have: - a) Shunt at the ventricular or pulmonary artery level. b). Shunt at atrial level Patients with shunt at the ventricular or pulmonary artery level do not develop CCF because the right ventricle is dompressed by the shunt. Patients with shunt at atrial level may have. i) Obstruction at right ventricular outlet (Pulmonary stenosis or atresia) CCF develops in the first few days of life as rt ventricle does not decompress fully because shunt is at atrial level. Obstruction at right ventricular inlet (Tricuspid atresia) ---> CCF usually does not occur as there is no volume overload to right ventricle. But these patients develop congestive symptoms when the shunt is small. 3). Obstructive lesions If the stenosis is critical (e. g., in aortic or pulmonary atresia), CCF may develop early because of impaired ventricular decompression. Coarctation of aorta may develop CCF with in 1-4 weeks of life. However, if these patients do not manifest CCF in the first year of life, collaterals develop and prevent onset of failure by decompressing the obstruction. 4) Transposition Patients with transposition of great arteries, develop CCF within first week of life, when there is no ventricular communication and the only mixing site is at the atrial level ---> Hypoxemia along with anoxic myocardium results in tachycardia that causes CCF. Patients with transposition of great arteries with an adequate ventricular defect and patients with transposition of pulmonary veins develop CCF somewhat later, usually by the age of six to eight weeks, following the fall in pulmonary vascular resistance as in patient with left to right shunt.",

It results from reflex changes in vagal influence on the normal pacemaker and disappears with breath holding, or increase of heart rate. It has no clinical significance. It is common in both the young and the elderly. ASD is found in approximately 6% of children with congenital heart disease who survive beyond the first year of life. After bicuspid aoic valve, it is the most common form of congenital heart disease among adults. ASDs have a female-to-male ratio of approximately 2: 1. The mode of transmission is best explained in most instances on a multifactorial basis, in which the risk would be approximately 2. 5% for first-degree relatives of a single affected family member In a child with Large ASD the filling of the two ventricles remains constant throughout the respiration cycle.

D Atrial septal defects are of two types Ostium primum atrial septal defect Ostium secundum atrial septal defect This division depends upon the development of interatrial septum and related structures.

Presence of interatrial septum is the only developmental anomaly in ostium secundum type and associated with right axis deviation. In contrast, the ostium primum defects are characterized by the presence of certain other developmental abnormalities, besides the interatrial septum.

The most common age group is 6 months to 4 years. Most common foreign body aspirated is nuts (peanuts). Most airway foreign bodies lodge in a bronchus (right more than left). Clinical manifestions Three stages of symptoms may results: - Stage I - Initial event -> Violent paroxysm of coughing (a most common symptom), choking, gagging and wheeze immediately after aspiration. If the obstruction is complete, child may be unable to vocalize (aphonia) and there may be cyanosis. If the obstruction is incomplete drooling and stridor may occur. Stage II Asymptomatic -> The foreign body becomes lodged, reflex fatigue and immediate irritating symptoms subside. This stage is most treacherous and account for a large percentage of delayed diagnosis and overlooked foreign bodies.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Hypoplastic left hea syndrome o Amongst the given options, hypoplastic left hea syndrome causes CHF in First week. o Different congenital diseases have different time of onset of CHF: - 1). Left to right shunt o At bih, pulmonary vascular resistance is high, i. e., the pressure on side of circulation is high --> Pulmonary pressure is almost equal to systemic pressure. So, left to right shunt is small, whether the communication is atrial, ventricular or pulmonary aery level. As the neonate grows, pulmonary vascular resistance falls with maximum fall at the age of six to eight weeks (Note - In normal neonate, maximum fall is between 1 to 3 weeks). o This is the time (six to eight weeks) when the size of shunt is maximum as pulmonary vascular resistance is least at this time. So, patients with left to right shunts tend to develop CCF around six to eight weeks of life. 2). Right to left shunt Patients with right to left shunt may have:? a) Shunt at the ventricular or pulmonary aery level. b). Shunt at atrial level o Patients with shunt at the ventricular or pulmonary aery level do not develop CCF because the right ventricle is dompressed by the shunt. o Patients with shunt at atrial level may have. i) Obstruction at right ventricular outlet (Pulmonary stenosis or atresia) --> CCF develops in the first few days of life as ventricle does not decompress fully because shunt is at atrial level. ii) Obstruction at right ventricular inlet (Tricuspid atresia) CCF usually does not occur as there is no volume overload to right ventricle. But these patients develop congestive symptoms when the shunt is small. 3) Obstructive lesions o If the stenosis is critical (e. g., in aoic or pulmonary atresia), CCF may develop early because of impaired ventricular decompression. o Coarctation of aoa may develop CCF with in 1-4 weeks of life. However, if these patients do not manifest CCF in the first year of life, collaterals develop and prevent onset of failure by decompressing the obstruction. 4) Transposition o Patients with transposition of great aeries, develop CCF within first week of life, when there is no ventricular communication and the only mixing site is at the atrial level --> Hypoxemia along with anoxic myocardium results in tachycardia that causes CCF. o Patients with transposition of great aeries with an adequate ventricular defect and patients with transposition of pulmonary veins develop CCF somewhat later, usually by the age of six to eight weeks, following the fall in pulmonary vascular resistance as in patient with left to right shunt.",

A) Left to right shunts Patients with a left to right shunts have following features: - Frequent respiratory tract infection -> Because pulmonary circulation is overloaded which may result in pulmonary edema, CHF and infection. No cyanosis -> Most of the blood is in pulmonary circulation. So there is no impairment in oxygenation of blood. Pericardial bulge -4 Frequent chest infections with tachypnea causes the soft rib cage being drawn inward at the diaphragmetic attachments of the ribs.

Cardiomegaly with plethoric pulmonary vasculature on chest X-ray -> Due to increased flow through pulmonary circulation (plethoric lung) there is increased volume overload to left side of heart -> Cardiomegaly. B) Obstructive Lesions Obstructive congenital diseases have following features. Absence offrequent chest infection -> Pulmonary circulation is not overloaded. The absence of cyanosis -> No defect in pulmonary oxygenation and there is no shunt where arterial and venous blood can mix. The absence of precordial buldge -> There is no chest infection or Cardiomegaly.

Absence of delayed diastolic murmur in mitral or tricuspid area -> Blood flow through these area is not increased.

Depending on the severity of clitoral enlargement and labial fusion, the diagnosis may be established at birth. However such patients may present in early childhood. (C) Non-classic (acquired/late) from Patients with non-classical form or late-onset form produce a normal amount of cortisol and/or aldosterone but at the expense of producing excess androgens. These usually present in childhood or early adulthood with premature pubarche & symptoms/signs of PCOD. Hirsutism, Acne and Oligomenorrhea are the most common presenting features.",

Clinical manifestations: o Gower's sign is positive o Pseudohyperophy of calf is seen (muscle is replaced by fat & connective tissue) o Loss of muscle strength is progressive. o Proximal muscles and neck flexors are involved more o Leg involvement is more severe than arm involvement. o Contractures of heel cords and iliotibial band occurs (by age of 6 years) o progressive scoliosis develops.",
