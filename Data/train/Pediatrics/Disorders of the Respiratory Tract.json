Harrison, 16/e and Nelson, 17/e, say that - H. influenzae was the most common etiological agent of epiglottitis but because of widespread use of the HIB vaccine, diseases d/t H. influenzae have reduced drastically and \"therefore, other agents such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumaniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, now represent a larger proportion of pediatric cases of epiglottitis. \" So far fine. But the trouble is that both of them mention this change for US only. Harrison writes - 'After the introduction of Hib vaccine, disease incidence among children in the United States declined dramatically. \" Nelson writes - \"Since the widespread use of the Hib vaccine in the United States, invasive disease due to H. influenzae type b in pediatric patients has been reduced by 80-90%. Therefore other agents, such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, now represent a larger proportion of pediatric cases of epiglottitis. \" Apart from Nelson and Harrison, all other books consulted (mentioned in References above) write H. influenzae to be the most common etiological agent. They also mention that it has reduced considerably in US d/t extensive use of Hib vaccine. CPDT writes - \"In published case series, it is almost always caused by H. influenzae type B\" O. P. Ghai writes - \"H. influenzae type B is the most frequent causative agent. \" I consulted specifically book by UK authors who also endorse the same fact Furfare and Ameils Textbook of Pediatrics, 6/e p 777 write - \"Epiglottitis is caused primarily by H. influenzae type B. The introduction of the conjugate vaccine in the UK in October 1992 has substantially reduced the incidence of epiglottitis, however, there has been a recent resurgence of cases d/t vaccine failure. \" Also, read these lines from Harrison - \"Nevertheless, lack of vaccination or vaccine failure has meant that many pediatric cases seen today are still due to Hib\" So we conclude that- in India - H. influenzae in U. S. - Group A Streptococcus in World as a whole - Not sure but I would go for H. influenzae Most common etiological agent of epiglottitis As far as this question is concerned, it is being asked by an Indian institution, so I would go for the most common etiological agent in India (or may be in the world but definitely not in US)",

Genetic analysis* The sweat test is the standard approach to diagnosis.* The diagnosis is made by elevated sodium and chloride level in the sweat >60 m. Eq/l.* Two tests on different days are required for accurate diagnosis.* A normal sweat chloride dose not exclude the diagnosis.* Genotyping and other tests such as measurement of nasal membrane potential difference, pancreatic function should be done if there is high clinical suspicion of cystic fibrosis.* Measurement of nasal transepithelial potential difference in vivo can be useful adjunct in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.* Individual with cystic fibrosis demonstrate a significantly more negative baseline nasal potential difference, with the topical application of amiloride there is loss of this potential difference. Nasal potential difference is a sensitive test of electrolyte transport (CFTR) function that can be used to support or refute a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.* It is caused due to defect in CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein.* Cystic fibrosis is associated with large number of mutations.* More than 1500 CFTR polymorphisms are associate with cystic fibrosis syndrome. * The most prevalent mutation of CFTR is the deletion of single phenylalanine residue at amino acid D508. This mutation is responsibly for high incidence of cystic fibrosis in northern European populations.* Now days commercial laboratories test for 30- 80 of the most common CFTR mutations. Detection of atleast 2 CF mutations are necessary for making the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Diagnostic Criteria for Cystic Fibrosis.

        "exp": "Ans. is (a > b) Streptococcus pneumoniae In recent days because of vaccination, cases of Epiglottitis due to Haemophilus influenzae type b have gone down drastically and thus change in option from B to A. In the past, epiglottitis was most common in children 2 to 5 years old and was usually caused by the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae type b. Now that most children are vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae type b, the disease is quite rare and is more common among adults. In adults, and also in children now, it is typically caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, and staphylococci. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (see Etiology) can colonize the pharynges of otherwise healthy children through respiratory transmission from intimate contact. These bacteria may penetrate the mucosal barrier, invading the bloodstream and causing bacteremia and seeding of the epiglottis and surrounding tissues. Bacteremia may also lead to infection of the meninges, skin, lungs, ears, joints, and other structures. Hib infection of the epiglottis leads to acute onset of inflammatory edema, beginning on the lingual surface of the epiglottis where the submucosa is loosely attached. Swelling significantly reduces the airway aperture. Edema rapidly progresses to involve the aryepiglottic folds, the arytenoids, and the entire supraglottic larynx. The tightly bound epithelium on the vocal cords halts edema spread at this level. Frank airway obstruction, aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, or distal mucous plugging can cause respiratory arrest. Noninfectious inflammation of any of the structures around the epiglottis may also result from thermal or chemical injury or from local trauma, including blunt trauma to the neck.",

Abdominal distention, emesis, and failure to pass meconium appear in the 1st 24-48 hr of life. Abdominal radiographs show dilated loops of bowel with air-fluid levels and. frequently, a collection of granular, \"ground-glass\" material in the lower central abdomen. Rarely, meconium peritonitis results from intrauterine rupture of the bowel wall and can be detected radiographically as the presence of peritoneal or scrotal calcifications. Meconium plug syndrome occurs with increased frequency in infants with CF but is less specific than meconium ileus.

        "exp": "Ans. c. Congenital lobar emphysema (Ref: Nelson 19/e p1461-1462). The most likely diagnosis in a neonate presenting with respiratory distress with enlargement of left upper lobe of lung and mediastinal shift towards the right is congenital lobar emphysema. Congenital Lobar Emphysema (CLE). Congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) may result in severe respiratory distress in early infancy and may be caused by localized obstruction. Familial occurrence has been reported. In 50% of cases, a cause of CLE can be identified. Congenital deficiency of the bronchial cartilage, external compression by aberrant vessels, bronchial stenosis, redundant bronchial mucosal flaps, and kinking of the bronchus caused by herniation into the mediastinum have been described as leading to bronchial obstruction and subsequent CLE. Clinical Features: Clinical manifestations usually become apparent in the neonatal period but may be delayed for as long as 5-6 months in 5% of patients. Signs range from mild tachypnea and wheeze to severe dyspnea with cyanosis. CLE affects the upper and middle lobes, with the left upper lobe the most common site. The affected lobe is essentially nonfunctional because of the over distention, and atelectasis of the ipsilateral normal lung may ensue. With further distention, the mediastinum is shifted to the contralateral side with impaired function seen as well. Diagnosis: A radiolucent lobe and a mediastinal shift are often revealed by radiographic examination. Treatment: Treatment by immediate surgery and excision of the lobe may be lifesaving when cyanosis and severe respiratory distress are present, but some patients respond to medical treatment. Some children with apparent congenital lobar emphysema have reversible over inflation, without the classic alveolar septal rupture implied in the term emphysema.",

PEDIATRIC TUBERCULOSIS: Prevelance of childhood TB is between 10 to 20% of all TB cases and between 5 to 15% overall. Frequency of childhood Tb depends upon: number of infectious cases, closeness of contacts, age of child when exposed, age structure of population. Children are rarely sputum positive and non infective to others. Childhood tuberculosis is rarely contagious because; of low bacterial load and rarity of cavitating disease. Childhood TB is common due to failure of control in adult and risk of infection to child depends upon extent of exposure to droplet nuclei. An infant with sputum positive mother has high chances of developing TBRisk of developing disease is greatest shortly after infection. Children below 5 years of age are most susceptible because of poor immune system, therefore most common in age group of 1-4 years. Young age is a risk factor for dissemination to other body parts. Children (especially below 5 years of age) usually cannot expectorate sputum to allow a definite diagnosis. As there are no specific symptoms and findings on clinical examination in children, the diagnosis is usually made after taking history of close contact with an adult with TB, failure to thrive, and persistent cough > 3weeks if the child has received broad spectrum antibiotics. Tuberculin test may have supportive evidence. Chest X ray is a common investigation, especially in military TBA Symptomatic child with tuberculin positive 10 mm, is considered as case regardless of BCG administration. For infants, if mother or any house hold member is smear positive, chemoprophylaxis is given for 3 months.

In a patient with V/Q mismatch, there will most likely be some areas of the lungs, which are better perfused that ventilated and some areas which are better ventilated than perfused. While this occurs to some degree in the normal lung, in V/Q mismatch, it is increased significantly to the point of being pathological. In asthma, bronchospasm, mucus plugs, inflammation and airway obstruction in general worsen ventilation disrupting the balance between ventilation and perfusion",

Kief'iciency (SCID). Both cellular and humoral immunity affected. MC type is X-linked SCID (X-SCD) due to mutation in Common Cytokine Receptor g Chain (gC). Second most common form of SCID is absence of the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA)(15% patients). All patients with SCID have very small thymuses (<1 g). Thymus fail to descend from the neck, contain no thymocytes, and lack corticomeduliary distinction or Hassall corpuscles. The thymic epithelium appears histologically normal. Both the follicular and paracorticai areas of the spleen are depleted of lymphocytes. Lymph nodes, tonsils, adenoids, and Peyer patches are absent or extremely underdeveloped. Clinical Manifestations. Affected infants present within the 1st few months of life with Recu rrent or persistent diarrhea. Pneumonia. Otitis media Sepsis. Cutaneous infections. Growth failure. Persistent infections with opportunistic organisms including lead to death. Candida albicans. Pneumocystis jiroveci. Parainfluenza 3 virus. Adenovirus. Respiratory syncytial virus. Rotavirus vaccine virus Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Varicella-zoster virus. Measles virus. MMR-V vaccine virus. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). Affected infants also lack the ability to reject foreign tissue and are therefore at risk for severe or fatal graft versus host disease (GVHD) from T lymphocytes in non irradiated blood products or in allogeneic stem cell transplants or less severe GVHD from maternal immunocompetent T cells that crossed the placenta while the infant was in utero.* These infants also have an absence of lymphocyte proliferative responses to mitogens, antigens, and allogeneic cells in vitro. Patients with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency have the lowest absolute lymphocyte counts, usually <500/mm3. Serum immunoglobulin concentrations are low or absent. No antibodies are formed after immunizations. T cells are extremely low or absent. Treatment. SCID is a true pediatric emergency. Unless immunologic reconstitution is achieved through stem cell transplantation, death usually occurs during the 1st yr of life and almost invariably before 2 yr of age.",
