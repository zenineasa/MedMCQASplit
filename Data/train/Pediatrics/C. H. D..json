        "exp": "Ans. c. TOF (Ref. Myong K. Park 5/e p238). Natural History of TOF: (Myong K. Park 5/e p238). Infants with acvanotic gradually become cyanotic as a result of worsening condition of the infundinular stenosis and polycythemia. Polycythemia develop secondary to cyanosis. Hypoxic spells may develop in infants. Growth retardation may be present if cyanosis is severe. Brain abscess and cerebrovascular accidents rarely occur. SABE is occasionally a complication. Some patients, particularly those with severe TOF develop ARCoagulopathy is a late complication of longstanding cyanosis. Eisenmenger syndrome.

Vasopressors: Methoxamine (Vasoxy1) IM or IV drip (Phenylephrine is a vasopressor)QCorrect anemia. Consider surgery. Tetralogy of Fallot. Commonest congenital cyanotic congenital heart diseaseQ in children above the age of 2 years constituting almost 75 percent of all blue patients. Hemodynamics: Physiologically the pulmonary stenosis causes concentric right ventricular hypertrophy without cardiac enlargementQ and an increase in right ventricular pressure. Severity of cyanosis is directly proportional to the severity of pulmonic stenosis, but the intensity of the systolic murmur is inversely proportional to the severity of pulmonic stenosisQ. Since the right ventricle is e. ffectively decompressed by the ventricular septal defect, congestive failure never occurs in TOFQ. The late and soft P2 is generally inaudible in TOF. The S2 is therefore single and the audible sound is A2. On auscultation, the diastolic interval is completely clear in TOF as there is no third or fourth sound or diastolic murmur. Clinical Features: MC symptoms are dyspnoea on exertion and exercise intoleranceQ. Squatting is not specific for TOF, TOF is the commonest congenital lesion in which squatting is notedQ. Characteristic features: Normal sized heart with upturned apexQ (suggestive of RVH). Absence of main pulmonary artery segment gives it the shape described as 'Cor-en Sabot'Q Pulmonary fields are oligaemic. QAortic-mitral valve continuity is maintainedQ.

        "question": "Which of the following is true about patent ductus arteriosus?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Indomethacin is used in medical management Patent ductus arteriosuso Patent ductus arteriosus is a communication between the pulmonary artery and aorta. The ductus arteriosus is present in fetal life which connects pulmonary trunk to aorta. It closes functionally and anatomically soon after birth. o 'Functional closure1 takes place within 15 hours of birth. r. Anatomic closure' of ductus arteriosus occurs 10-21 days after birth. o Prostaglandins maintain the patency of ductus. The persistence of function of ductus arteriosus beyond 24 hours after birth is considered as PDA in term neonate, i. e. if functional closure does not take place in 24 hours after birth, it is considered as PDA. o The aortic attachment of ductus arteriosus is just distal to subclavian artery. PDA is more common in females than in males. Hemodynamics of PDAo In PDA blood flows from aorta to pulmonary artery because aortic pressure is higher than pulmonary artery pressure - Left to right shunt. o Pressure gradient between aorta and pulmonary artery is maintained throughout the cardiac cycle (during systole and diastole) - Continous murmur, i. e., murmur starts in systole after S1 and reaches a peak at S2. It then diminishes and audible only a part of diastole. o Larger blood volume passes through pulmonary circulation (blood from right side of heart plus some blood from aorta) - Pulmonary plethora which may cause pulmonary hypertension, o Increased flow after passing through lung reaches the left atrium and causes volume overload - Left atrial dilatation and hypertrophy. o Increased blood volume passes from left atrium to left ventricle through mitral valve, i. e., increased flow through mitral valve - Accentuation of SI and delayed diastolic murmur. o Left ventricle recieves larger amount of blood that results in volume overload. Left ventricle enlargemento Extra volume passes through aortic area cause delayed closure of aortic valve which may close even after pulmonary valve (normal pulmonary valves close after aortic valves). - Paradoxical spliting of S2, i. e., A2 occurs after P2 (Normally A2 occurs before P2). o Large left ventricular volume ejected into the aorta results in dilatation of the ascending aorta. Aortic ejectionclick. o Large volume of blood passes through normal aortic valve Aortic ejection systolic murmur (but it is masked by continuous murmur). Clinical manifestations of PDAo Patient may be asymptomatico Symptoms develop early and CHF may develop at 6 to 8th weeks of age. o Common symptoms - Dysnea on exertion, palpitation and frequent chest infections. Signso Tachypnea & Tachycardiao Bounding pulse with wide pulse pressure (with elevated systolic and lower diastolic pressure)o Hyperkinetic cardiac impulseo Systolic or continuous thrillo Accentuated S1o Narrow or paradoxical split of S2 (But it may be masked by continuous murmur since maximum intensity of continuous murmur occurs at S2). o Continous (machinery) murmur - Murmur starts after SI and reaches the peak at S2. It then diminishes and is audible only during a part of the diastole. Murmur is best heard at second left intercostal space and is also heard below left clavicle. o S3 may occur at apex followed by a delayed diastolic murmur. Management of PDAo NSAIDs (most commonly indomethacin) are used to induce closure of PDA, as these drugs inhibit synthesis of prostaglandins (Prostaglanding are involved in maintainance of patency of ductus arteriosus). o If indomethacin is not successful and the ductus remains hemodynamically significant, surgical ligation with or without division of ductus should be performed.",

        "exp": "ANSWER: (B) Right atrial dilatation. REF: Nelsons 18thed ch: 430. 7. Ebstien's anomaly is a cyanotic heart disease with decreased pulmonary flow Pathophysiology: Characterized by a downward displacement of the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, due to anomalous attachment of the tricuspid leaflets, the Ebstein tricuspid valve tissue is dysplastic and results in tricuspid regurgitation. The abnormally situated tricuspid orifice produces an \"atrialized1' portion of the right ventricle lying between the atrioventricular ring and the origin of the valve, which is continuous with the RA chamber. EBSTEIN ANOMALYThe right ventricle is thus divided into two parts by the abnormal tricuspid valve: the 1st, a thin-walled \"atrialized\" portion, is continuous with the cavity of the right atrium; the 2nd, often smaller portion consists of normal ventricular myocardium. Often the right ventricle is hypoplastic. The right atrium is huge, and the tricuspid valve is generally regurgitant, although the degree is extremely variable. At times, right ventricular function is so compromised that it is unable to generate enough force to open the pulmonary valve in systole, thus producing \"functional\" pulmonary atresia. Some infants have true anatomic pulmonary atresia. The increased volume of right atrial blood shunts through the foramen ovale to the left atrium and produces cyanosis. Clinical manifestations: Although the clinical manifestations are variable, some patients come to initial attention because of either. Progressive cyanosis from right-to-left atrial shunting. Symptoms due to tricuspid regurgitation and RV dysfunction. Paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmias with or without atrioventricular bypass tracts (\"WPW\" syndrome). Diagnostic findings by two-dimensional echocardiography include the abnormal positional relation between the tricuspid and mitral valves with abnormally increased apical displacement of the septal tricuspid leaflet. Tricuspid regurgitation is quantitated by Doppler examination. Surgical approaches include prosthetic replacement of the tricuspid valve when the leaflets are tethered or repair of the native valve.",

So they require prompt management\"- Ghai 7/e p406. Patent Ductus Arteriosus. PDA is a communication between pulmonary artery and aorta. The aortic attachment to the ductus arteriosus is just distal toQ the left subclavian artery. Hemodynamics: PDA results in a left to right shuntQ from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. Flow occurs during systole and diastole as the pressure gradient is present throughout the cardiac cycle between the two great arteries, if the pulmonary artery pressure is normal, the flow of blood results in murmur, hence it is a continuous murmurQ. Clinical Features: Clinical presentation depends on PDA sizeQ and gestational age at deliveryQ. Infants and children with a small PDA are generally asymptomatic: infants with a large PDA present with signs of heart failureQ (e. g. failure to thrive, poor feeding, tachypnea, dyspnea with feeding, tachycardia). Premature newborns can't tolerate PDA, so it results in heart failure, respiratory distress or necrotizing enterocolitisQ. Premature infants may present with respiratory distress, apnea, worsening mechanical ventilation requirement or other serious complications (e. g. necrotizing enterocolitisQ). Signs of heart failure occur earlier in premature infants than in full-term infants and may be more severe. A large ductal shunt in a premature infant often is a major contributor to the severity of the lung disease of prematurity. Patients of PDA may become symptomatic in early life and develop CCF around 6-10 weeks of ageQ. Older children give history of effort intolerance, palpitations and frequent chest infectionsQ. The flow from the aorta to the pulmonary artery is a leak from the systemic flow. This results in a wide pulse pressure and many of the signs of wide pulse pressure seen in patient with aortic regurgitation. Differential Cyanosis (characteristic of PDA). Since the right to left shunt through the PDA, blood flows down the descending aorta, cyanosis is present in toes, but not in fingers.
