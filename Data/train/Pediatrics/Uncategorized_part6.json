Phenylketonuria It is an autosomal recessive condition. There is a deficiency of enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Pathophysiology Because phenylalanine is not metabolised by hydroxylase, metabolism is shifted to the alternative pathway (see above explanation) and there is an increased concentration of - Phenylalanine Phenylpuruvic acid Phenylacetic acid Phenylacetic acid Because phenylalanine is not converted into tyrosine, tyrosine becomes an essential amino acid. Treatment: The goal of therapy is to reduce phenylalanine and its metabolites in body fluids in order to minimize or prevent brain damage. Administration of low phenylalanine levels is the mainstay of treatment. Dietary treatment should be started as soon as after birth as the diagnosis is established. Because phenylalanine is not synthesized in the body, Tyrosine becomes an essential A. A. in this disorder, and its adequate intake must be ensured.",

Chest X ray cannot differentiate whether ET tube is inseed in trachea or esophagus as esophagus is situated just behind trachea. Treatment of CDH includes endotracheal intubation followed by ventilation with a rate of 40 to 60 breaths/min and lowest peak inspiratory pressures that allow for normal chest rise which inturn help to avoid pneumothoraces due to barotrauma to the hypoplastic lungs.

        "exp": "A child with glycosuria, polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss despite increased appetite is likely to have type 1 diabetes mellitus. This form of diabetes has an impoant autoimmune component to its etiology. As many as 85% of patients have islet cell autoantibodies in their blood in the first few weeks after onset of the disease. Most of these antibodies are directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase, an enzyme that is present in b cells. Insulin deficiency leads to decreased glucose uptake and hyperglycemia. The increase in blood glucose results in increased glycosylation of hemoglobin in red blood cells. Hence, the hemoglobin A1c concentration will be increased, not decreased, reflecting long-standing hyperglycemia. Another consequence of the increased blood glucose is increased serum osmolarity (not decreased). If the osmolarity exceeds 330 m. Osm/L, consciousness begins to be impaired. beta; cell destruction in type 1 diabetes leads to decreased secretion of insulin. Since insulin and C-peptide are released on a 1: 1 ratio by the beta; cells, the secretion of C-peptide is also decreased. Insulin is first synthesized as preproinsulin, with an initial leader sequence of hydrophobic amino acids that allows the developing protein to be extruded from the ribosomes into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The \"pre\" segment is then cleaved off, leaving proinsulin. Proinsulin is packaged into secretory granules within the Golgi, and as the granules bud off, enzymes cleave the precursor into insulin and C-peptide. Ref: Klein U. (2012). Chapter 17.

The Fi02 being given is in the higher normal range, and also the paial pressure of 0, in the neonates blood is acceptable. So we will avoid increasing the Fi0,, as this carries a risk of blindness by ROP (Retinopathy of Prematurity).

        "exp": "Tetralogy of Fallot and transposition of great aeries are cyanotic heart diseases and rheumatic fever will not occur in this age group. So the answer is ventricular septal defect. When the effective area of the defect is large, there is viually no resistance to flow, and systemic systolic pressure is present in the right ventricle and the pulmonary aery. At bih, pulmonary vascular resistance is high, with little if any left-to-right shunt, despite the presence of a large defect. This resistance gradually falls over the first few weeks of life, permitting a progressively greater amount of blood to flow through the defect, to the pulmonary aeries and back to the left atrium and left ventricle. In many infants, the left ventricular volume overload eventually leads to left ventricular \"failure, \" with elevated left ventricular end-diastolic and left atrial pressures and pulmonary congestion. With a large VSD and a high pulmonary vascular resistance, the systolic murmur becomes soft and sho because there is little left-to-right shunt across a large defect, and a right-to-left shunt across the VSD causes little or no murmur.

Lactoferrin -> Inhibits growth of E. coli. Bile stimulated lipase -> kills Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia. Bifidus factor -> Inhibits growth of E. coli Para-amino-benzoic acid (PABA) -> Provides protection against malaria Phagocytic macrophages and lymphoid cells 3. Lower pH of the stool of breastfed infants contributes to the favourable intestinal flora more bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, fewer E. coli.",

Treatment of hyperleukocytosis includes: - 1. Immediate leukoreduction (cytoreduction) Immediate leukoreduction is required to lower the blast cells. This can be achieved by leukopharesis or by administration of hydroxyurea. 2. Induction chemotherapy Induction chemotherapy is initiated early, but only after attempts at leukoreduction (not immediately) as immediate administration of induction chemotherapy carries a high risk of acute tumor lysis syndrome.

        "exp": "Poal venous gas is seen in association with pneumatosis intestinalis, most commonly with necrotizing enterocolitis. The physiology of this is that the poal vein, the mesenteric veins, drains nutrient-rich blood from the gut to the liver. In the case of necrosis with air in the bowel wall, air migrates into the poal venous system and to the liver. On CT, this has the characteristic appearance of peripheral lucencies following the poal venous system intrahepatically. In cases of more severe pneumatosis, the bowel may rupture and lead to pneumoperitoneum. Also Know: Pneumobilia, or air in the biliary tract, would be seen after instrumentation of the biliary system, such as after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP). Other causes include a gas-forming infection within the biliary tree or previous sphincterotomy (endoscopic opening of the sphincter of Oddi). Pneumobilia has a distinct appearance on CT: there is gas located centrally in the liver within the ducts. Hemobilia, or blood in the biliary tract, would be seen after instrumentation of the biliary system, such as after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP), from a biliary or hepatic tumor, or secondary to a hypocoagulable state. Hemobilia is found at endoscopy, and is generally not visible on plain radiographs. High attenuation material may be seen within the bile ducts on a CT scan, suggesting hemobilia. Hepatic venous gas would not be seen with pneumatosis because the hepatic veins drain the liver into the inferior vena cava (IVC). Gas from the bowel wall gets trapped in the poal veins and does not traverse the liver to get into the hepatic veins. Ref: Thilo E. H., Rosenberg A. A. (2012). Chapter 2. The Newborn Infant. In W. W.

The comparison of a child's height and weight with the standard growth chart helps to determine if the particular child is within the expected normal range for his age, sex and socioeconomic status. It does not indicate if the rate of growth of child was normal in the recent past. The point to stress here is that it is very difficult to recognize a recent disturbance in growth by comparing weight or height with the reference standards because a clearly abnormal percentile position on the growth chart becomes evident only when the factors retarding growth are profound or if they have persisted for a considerable time. Measurement of the velocity of growth or increment in unit time is a better tool for early identification of factors affecting growth and also for assessment of the usefulness of social and remedial measures.",

Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome Usually begins as prodrome. The acute phase stas with the onset of erythematous rash in the periorbital and perioral area and is tender. o These erythematous rashes are soon (within hrs or days) followed by wrinkling or sloughing of the skin. o The sloughing can be provoked by stroking of the skin (Nikolsky's sign). In later stage, large flaccid bullae may develop. These bullae can cause loss of water and electrolyte. o Fever irritability and lethargy are common but systemic toxicity is not seen. o The entire illness resolves within about 10 days. Toxic epidermal necrolvsis? It is a severe form of drug reaction. Toxemia is characteristic. It is characterized by bullae that arise on widespread areas of erythema and then they slough leaving behind raw ulcerated skin. Oral mucosa especially the lips, genital mucosa and conjunctiva are ofter involved. In some cases cornea is also involved leading to corneal opacities. o Drugs commonly involved in TEN are --> Thioacetazone, INH, Sulphonamides, Phenolphthalein Stevens Jhonson syndrome?

No loss of posture No breathing difficulty No incontinence of urine or stool May be accompanied by subtle bilateral motor signs such as Rapid blinking of eyelids Small amplitude clonic movements of the hands Chewing movements Absence seizures may occur in multiple every day (can occur hundreds of times per day) The electrophysiological hallmark of typical absence seizure is a generalized symmetric 3 Hz spike and slow wave discharge that begins and ends suddenly on a normal EEG background. Hyperventilation tends to provoke these electrographic discharge and even the seizure themselves and is routinely used when recording the EEG. Hyperventilation often precipitates the attacks. Drug of choice for absence seizures is Valproate (Previously it was ethosuxamide).",

Management Care of the child in coma is directed towards maintaining body function in optimal state until the child regains consciousness. Management includes: - 1) Airway As a general rule, place the child on his/her side to reduce the risk of aspiration. Oral suctioning to remove mucus from the mouth and pharynx may be necessary.

They are partially obstructive and thus lead to variable degrees of back pressure damage to the urinary bladder and upper urinary tract. Dilation and obstruction of the prostatic urethra are always present. Spontaneous urinary ascites from the kidneys is often seen in neonates. This clear when the obstruction is relieved. About one-third of children with posterior urethral valves are now diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. Another one-third are diagnosed in the first year of life, with the remaining third presenting later. Clinical manifestations consist of difficult voiding, a weak urinary stream, and a midline lower abdominal mass that represents a distended bladder. In some cases, the kidneys are palpable and the child may have signs and symptoms of uremia and acidosis. Urinary incontinence and urinary tract infection may occur. Laboratory findings include elevated serum urea nitrogen and creatinine and evidence of urinary infection. Ultrasound shows evidence of bladder thickening and trabeculation, hydroureter, and hydronephrosis. Demon\u00adstration of urethral valves on a voiding cystourethrogram establishes the diagnosis, as does endoscopic identifica\u00adtion of valves. Up to 70% of children with valves may have vesicoureteral reflux.

Now, about the individual diseases - Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome Usually begins as prodrome. The acute phase starts with the onset of erythematous rash in the periorbital and perioral area and is tender. These erythematous rashes are soon (within hrs or days) followed by wrinkling or sloughing of the skin. The sloughing can be provoked by stroking of the skin (Nikolsky's sign). In a later stage, large flaccid bullae may develop. These bullae can cause loss of water and electrolyte. Fever irritability and lethargy are common but systemic toxicity is not seen. The entire illness resolves within about 10 days. Toxic epidermal necrolysis - It is a severe form of drug reaction. Toxaemia is characteristic It is characterized by bullae that arise on widespread areas of erythema and then they slough leaving behind raw ulcerated skin. Oral mucosa especially the lips, genital mucosa and conjunctiva are often involved. In some cases, the cornea is also involved leading to corneal opacities. Drugs commonly involved in TEN are -> Thioacetazone, INH, Sulphonamides, Phenolphthalein Stevens Jhonson syndrome - It is also a severe form of drug eruption. Toxaemia is characteristically present.

Underactive thyroid problems, diabetes and problems with the intestinal and digestive tract are also seen in people with Down's syndrome, especially duodenal atresia. Patient may have conductive hearing loss. Most children with Down's syndrome experience respiratory tract problems, due to the small nasal bridge and the shoer lung capacity. There is some evidence to suggest that people with Down's syndrome have an increased probability of developing Alzheimer's disease. People with Down's syndrome have a characteristic facial appearance. For example, Their eyes appear to slant upwards and outwards. The head is usually flatter at the back and people with Down's syndrome often have a low hairline. The face often appears flatter with a flat nasal bridge and the tongue is often larger than usual. Iv. The ears often appear small and low set and there is often a distinctive fold of loose skin on the back of the neck. This increased thickness on the back of the neck may be detected in pregnancy (nuchal translucency) and can contribute to a diagnosis of Down's syndrome. People with Down's syndrome often have broad hands with sho fingers. Other common features associated with Down's syndrome include floppiness or poor muscle tone (hypotonia), and loose or bendy joints.

Ilemolysis associated with ABO incompatibility exclusively occurs in type \"0\" mothers with fetuses who have type A or type B blood. - The naturally occurring antibodies in ABO blood group (A, B, AB) is of the \"IgM class\" and it cannot cross the placenta. - As compared with the other ABO blood groups that have predo- minantly IgM antibodies group 0 mothers also have significant amount of naturally occurring \"IgG antibody\". -These IgG antibodies can easily cross the placenta and produce hemolysis in, fetus. ABO incompatibility usually causes mild hemolysis and anemia. The lack of severity of hemolytic disease can be attributed to the following factors. - There is wide expression of A and B antigens not only on red cells but also in plasma and other cells which will paially neutralize maternally derived ABO antibodies. - In addition, fetal RBC's are not. fully developed in the infant and they express less number of A and B antigenic sites, hence the low incidence of significant hemolysis in affected neonates. Therefore in ABO incompatibility, hyperbilirubinemia is the predo- minaret manifestation of incompatibility (rather than anemia).

The papules may join together to form large areas of palpable purpura or ecchymoses (bruises). Gums may swell and become red, soft and spongy. Any slight friction may cause the gums to bleed. Often this results in poor oral hygiene and dental diseases. Bleeding in the joints causes extreme discomfo and pain. Joints may be swollen and tender and the pain can be so severe that patients cannot walk. Patients may complain of dryness, irritation, light intolerance, transient visual blurring and stickiness. Haemorrhaging (bleeding) beneath the conjunctiva and within the optic nerve sheath may also occur.

(Note, that factor XIII is used, once the clot has formed.) Test used for evaluation of factor XIII Test used in qualitative evaluation of factor XIII is evaluation of clot stability in 5M urea.

Management of necrotizing enterocolitis Medical treatment of NEC include Cessation of feeding Nasogastric decompression Administration of i. v. fluids Systemic antibiotic against both gram +ve as well as gram -ye bacteria (after taking samples for blood culture). Ventilation should be assisted if distention is contributing to hypoxia. Early surgery consultation Surgical interventions in NEC Evidence of perforation is an indication for laparotomy and resection of necrotic bowel. Failure to respond to medical management, a single fixed bowel loop, erythema of the abdominal wall and a palpable mass are additional indications of exploratory laparotomy, resection of necrotic bowel and external ostomy diveion. Peritoneal drainage may be helpful for patients with peritonitis who are too unstable to withstand surgery. It is more successful in patients with isolated intestinal perforation. In many patients, no fuher surgical procedure is required. Peritoneal drainage is performed under local anaesthesia. A penrose drain is placed in the right lower quadrant and permitted to drain peritoneal contents and decompress the abdomen. This procedure is employed predominantly in infants less than 1000g who have severe SIRS and are viewed as too unstable to be transpoed or to undergo laparotomy. In experienced hands, one third of the patients require only drain placement. A primary anastomosis at the time of initial surgery is indicated in patients with limited localized disease who have no distal bowel involvement and in patients who have demonstrated a walled-off perforation who are no longer manifesting the SIRS. From this discussion, we choose the answer to be peritoneal drainage because: Patients is on ventilator (too unstable). Surgery for NEC is resection and creation of ileostomy, which is not given in the options. Primary anastomosis is done only in stable patients with walled-off perforation.",

        "question": "Deep white matter lesion with bilateral deep bright thalamic appearance is suggestive of which disease?",
        "exp": "Deep white matter lesion along with the involvement of thalamus suggests Krabbe's disease. The deficient lysosomal enzyme in Krabbe disease is galactocerebrosidase (GALC; also called galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase); it normally degrades galactocerebroside to ceramide and galactose. The deficiency results in the accumulation of galactocerebroside; a toxic metabolite, psychosine, leads to the early destruction of oligodendrocytes and depletion of lipids in the cerebral white matter. The EEG shows nonspecific slowing without spikes, and the CSF protein is usually elevated (70 to 450 mg/dL). CT scanning and MRI reveal symmetrical nonenhancing areas of increased density in the internal capsules and basal ganglia. C. T. shows diffuse symmetric attenuation of the cerebellar and cerebral white matter in Alexander's disease. The onset is in infancy with a failure to thrive, psychomotor retardation, spasticity of the craniospinal musculature, and seizures. An early and progressive macrocephaly has been a consistent feature. Pathologically, there are severe destructive changes in the cerebral white matter, most intense in the frontal lobes. Distinctive eosinophilic hyaline bodies, most prominent just below the pia and around blood vessels, are seen throughout the cerebral coex, brainstem, and spinal cord. These have been identified as Rosenthal fibers and probably represent glial degradation products. C. T. scan demonstrates degeneration of the white matter most prominent in the frontal lobes. Canavan's disease. C. T. scan shows diffuse white matter degeneration primarily in the cerebral hemispheres with less involvement in the cerebellum and brainstem in Metachromatic leukodystrophy. This is another of the lysosomal (sphingolipid) storage diseases. The abnormality is the mutation of the gene for enzyme arylsulfatase A, which prevents the conversion of sulfatide to cerebroside (a major component of myelin) and results in an accumulation of the former. The disease is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. Ref: Ropper A. H., Samuels M. A. (2009). Chapter 37. Inherited Metabolic Diseases of the Nervous System. In A. H. Ropper, M. A.

APGAR Score The test is generally done at one and five minutes after bih, and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low. Scores 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low, 4 to 6 fairly low, and 7 to I 0 generally normal. o A low score on the one-minute test may show that the neonate requires medical attention (e. g. resuscitation) but is not necessarily an indication that there will be long-term problems, paicularly if there is an improvement by the stage of the five-minute test. If the Apgar score remains below 3 at later times such as 10, 15 or 30 mintues, there is a risk that the child will suffer longer-term neurological damage. There is also a small but significant increase of the risk of cerebral palsy. However, the purpose of the Apgar test is to determine quickly whether a newborn needs immediate medical care; it was not designed to make long-term predicitions on a child's health. CO2 transpo across placenta o CO2 is cleared by placenta by simple diffusion. CO2 is produced abundantly in the fetus, and the PCO2 of fetal blood is higher than maternal blood. CO2 therefore diffuses from fetal blood, through the placenta, into the maternal circulation, and is disposed by expiration from mother's lung. Anaerobic metabolism causes acidemia due to lactate (lactic acid) production o Anoxic perfusion causes an increase in glucose consumption which is more than two fold higher than that seen in the oxygenated perfusion, resulting finally in placental uptake of glucose not only from the maternal but also from the fetal circulation. o Lactate production is increased during the anoxic perfusion, while the final tissue energy value lies between the values observed for fresh tissue and for the oxygenated perfusion. The shift to anerobic metabolism shown by placental tissue in anoxic conditions enables continued functioning of the tissue over the 2-h perfusion period but it appear that under anoxic conditions the tissue may incur an energy debt not observed in oxygenated perfusions.",

Overall, the percentage of spontaneous closure of PDA in preterm neonate is very low. To avoid confusion, I am explaining following facts in brief:- Normal neonate:- Ductus arteriosus closes functionally within about 15 hours of birth. FDA in term (mature) neonate:- The persistence of ductus arteriosus beyond 24 hours after birth is considered as PDA in term neonate. Spontaneous closure of PDA does not usually occur because PDA results from structural abnormality. FDA in pre-term (pre-mature) neonate:- The ductus arteriosus in pre-term neonate is not as responsive to increased oxygen content as it is in term neonate. However, there is no structural abnormality. Chances of spontaneous closure are very less (compared to normal term neonate). Chances of spontaneous closure are more than the term-neonate with PDA. However, in premature neonate, where hypoxic pulmonary disease is common place, the ductus being sensitive to hypoxia, remains open. So, it is very unlikely that spontaneous closure of PDA will occur in pre-term neonate. But chances are more when compared to term neonate with PDA (not nonnal term neonate in which ductus arteriosus closes within 15 hours of birth). Manifestations of PDA in pre-term neonate Apnea for unexplained reasons in an infant recovering from RDS; A hyperdynamic precordium, bounding peripheral pulses, wide pulse pressure, and a continuous or systolic murmur with or without extension into diastole or an apical diastolic murmur, multiple clicks resembling the shaking of dice; Carbon 'oxide retention; Increasing oxygen dependence; X-ray evidence of cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings; and Hepatomegaly Increased pulmonary blood flow and compromised ventricular function accompanying dropping pulmonary resistance in the setting of a P A is a significant risk factor for pulmonary hemorrhage. The greatest risk factor for NEC is prematurity. Any etiology which leads on to hemodynamic or hypoxic insult predisposes to NEC. PDA is common in preteen infants and it definitely causes hemodynamic stress and is a risk factor for development of NEC.",

        "exp": "Neuroblastoma is a malignant tumor of the autonomic nervous system. It is a neuroendocrine tumor, arising from any neural crest element of the sympathetic nervous system. Neuroblastoma is a disease of early childhood with approximately 90% of patients presenting before 5-years of age and almost 50% within the first 2-years of life. In childhood, about 40% of neuroblastomas arise in the adrenal medullae. The remainder occurs anywhere along the sympathetic chain, with the most common locations being the paravertebral region of the abdomen (25%) and posterior mediastinum (15%). Tumors may arise in numerous other sites, including the pelvis and neck and within the brain (cerebral neuroblastomas). It is the second most common solid malignancy of childhood. In young children, under age 2 years, neuroblastomas generally present with large abdominal masses, fever, and possibly weight loss. In older children, they may not come to attention until metastases produce manifestations, such as hone pain, respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints. Neuroblastomas may metastasize widely (Present in 60-70%- O. P. Ghai 7th/5990) through the hematogenous and lymphatic systems, particularly to liver, lungs, and bones, in addition to the bone marrow. Proptosis and ecchymosis may also be present because the periorbital region is a common metastatic site. Bladder and bowel dysfunction may be caused by paraspinal neuroblastomas that impinge on nerves. In neonates, disseminated neuroblastomas may present with multiple cutaneous metastases with deep blue discolora\u00adtion to the skin (earning the rather unfortunate designation of \"blueberry muffin baby)\" About 90% of neuroblastomas, regardless of location, produce catecholamines (similar to the catecholamines associ\u00adated with pheochromocytomas), which are an important diagnostic feature (i. e., elevated blood levels of catecholamines and elevated urine levels of metabolites, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and homovanillic acid (HVA) Children older than age 5 years usually have extremely poor outcomes irrespective of the stage (Robbins 7th/500-503) NB can present as a paraneoplastic syndrome of autoimmune origin manifesting as ataxia or opsomyoclonus (\"dancing eye & dancing feet\").",

Neonatal hepatitis is the prototype of intrahepatic cholestasis Biliary atresia is the prototype of extrahepatic biliary atresia Enzymes that reflect cholestasis: There are three enzymes that are usually elevated in cholestasis Alkaline phosphatase -> Found in or near bile canalicular membrane of hepatocytes 5' nucleotidase Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase -> Located in the endoplasmic reticulum and in bile duct epithelial cells. Because GGT is more diffusely localized in the liver, its elevation in serum is less specific than are the elevation of Alkaline phosphatase & 5' nucleotidase. Nevertheless, the following distinction is worthwhile. \"GGT levels are commonly elevated to values more than 10 times normal in biliary atresia while in hepatic causes it is raised to about three times normal. \" Normal values for GGT is about 5-40 IU/L and thus a value of 600 IU/L in the patient in question reflects an elevation of more than ten times the normal value.

Respiratory Rate settings in the ventilator is 50/min: Normal for that age. Now, we have the complete picture here: The premature baby is having HMD, and so has been put on Artificial respiration. The Fi. O2 being given is in the higher normal range, and also the partial pressure of 0, in the neonates blood is acceptable. So we will avoid increasing the Fi0\u201e as this carries a risk of blindness by ROP (Retinopathy of Prematurity). As a rule, we avoid tampering with the ventilator rate settings, because it causes changes in the CO, levels of the blood, and consequent disturbances in the acid - base balance.

Weaning from ventilator will start once the baby shows hyper - oxygenation with the currect settings, i. e. the p0, in the range of 120.

Thelarche (breast development) is the first sign of pubey (Tanner stage B2). It usually begins between 8 and 10 years of age and is associated with increased estrogen production. Pubarche (development of pubic and axillary hair) is the second stage in maturation and typically occurs between 11 and 12 years of age. Axillary hair usually appears after the growth of pubic hair is complete. Menarche (onset of menstruation) usually occurs 2-3 years after thelarche at an average age of 11-13 years.

        "exp": "Volvulus neonatorum The fetal alimentary canal returns from the extraembryonic coelom into the abdomen at 8-10 weeks and the bowel undergoes rotation and fixation at certain points by the attachment of its mesentery to the posterior abdominal wall. When the process is incomplete or deviates from the normal plan, the result is malfixation or malrotation. Commonly, the normal oblique attachment of the mesentery from duodenojejunal flexure of the caecum is absent, and the small bowel is attached to the posterior abdominal wall by a narrow stalk based around superior mesenteric vessels. The caecum is undescended, i. e., situated in the right hypochondrium and abnormally fixed by peritoneal bands running laterally across the second part of the duodenum. The poorly attached small bowel undergoes volvulus around the axis of the 'universal mesentery', which is twisted so that the flow of blood is cut off, producing a strangulating obstruction of the small bowel. This typically occurs in the newborn, hence the term `Volvulus neonatorum'. The terminal ileum and caecum are drawn into the volvulus and are wrapped around the stalk of the mesentery in two or three tight coils. Clinical feature A young infant, previously healthy, starts bile-stained vomiting during the first few days of the live. The abdomen is soft and non-distended; however, abdominal distension may occur which is limited to upper abdomen (epigastrium). No obstruction may occur in the first day or two after birth and meconium may be passed normally. Then, with variable suddenness, bowel actions cease with onset of obstruction. The signs vary, depending on the degree of intestinal obstruction versus ischemia. When strangulation occurs there are signs of shock, especially pallor and a vague mass of congested bowel may be palpable in the centre of the abdomen. Blood or blood-tinged mucus may be passed rectally. Ischemia may result in gangrene and perforation. Investigations Barium contrast studies with fluoroscopy (Barium meal follow through) is the investigation of choice as X-ray is not reliable in early stages of volvulus. However, if the perforation is suspected, barium contrast should not be used because of the risk of peritonitis. Water-soluble contrast studies (iodine based) should be used. Plain X-ray of abdomen/chest is the initial investigation to demonstrate free air under the diaphragm in suspected cases of perforation.",

Dystrophin is `subsarcolemmal protein' localized to the inner surface of the sarcolemma of the muscle fibre. Dystrophin is part of Dystrophin - Glycoprotein sarcolenzmal complex and this protein deficiency leads to secondary loss of sarcoglycans and dystroglycans resulting in weakness of sarcolemma, causing membrane tears and muscle fibre necrosis. Clinical manifestations: Gower's sign is positive Pseudohypertrophy of the calf is seen (muscle is replaced by fat & connective tissue) Loss of muscle strength is progressive.

        "exp": "Circulatory adjustments at birth These are brought about because of a shift from placental dependance for gas exchange in the fetus to pulmonary gas exchange in the neonate. 1) Pulmonary circulation Immediately after birth lungs expand due to the first few breaths of the neonate. This causes a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance (O2 causes pulmonary vasodilatation). This results in increased flow into pulmonary trunk and arteries. The pulmonary artery pressure falls due to lowering of pulmonary vascular resistance. The pressure relations between the aorta and pulmonary trunk are reversed so that the blood flow through the ductus arteriosus is reversed -> Instead of blood flowing from the pulmonary artery to aorta, the direction of flow through ductus, is from the aorta to pulmonary trunk. Increasing oxygen saturation causes the muscle of ductus to constrict -> In full term neonates, the ductus arteriosus closes within 10 to 25 days. 2) System circulation and circulation through the heart Loss of placental circulation and clamping of the cord after birth results in an increase in systemic vascular resistance. This tends to increase the aortic blood pressure and the left ventricular systolic pressure. The loss of placental circulation results in a sudden reduction of flow through ductus venosus which closes off -> Flow through ductus venosus disappears by the 7th day of postnatal life. The loss of placental flow results in a decrease in the volume of blood returning to right atrium -> Right atrial pressure decreases. The left atrial pressure becomes higher than right atrial pressure and the septum primum which ats as a valve of fossa ovalis, approximates with the septum secundum to close off formen ovale. Functional closure of foramen ovale occurs very quickly. Over a period of months, the septum primtun and septum secundum become firmly adherent resulting in anatomical closure of the foramen ovale. After closure of ductus arteriosus, there is establishment of postnatal circulation: - The blood reaching the right atrium through IVC and SVC is emptied into the right ventricle from where it is pumped into pulmonary trunk. After coursing through lungs for gas exchange, it reaches the left atrium and ventricle. The left ventricle pumps it out for distribution in the body for oxygenation of the tissues. The venous return again comes back to right atrium through IVC and SVC. All of the blood leaving the right ventricle, after coursing through lungs, reaches the left ventricle -> The two ventricles are connected in series and therefore, the output of right and left ventricles are same (in contrast to fetal circulation, where right ventricular output is more).",

In the absence of continuous oxygen saturation monitoring, it is reasonable to give nasopharyngeal oxygen (0. 5 litre/min) until the baby recovers. If monitoring is available, oxygen is given as appropriate. Thermal control. Baby's body temperature should be kept in the normal range of 36. 5-37. 2degC (sometimes the babies become hyperpyrexic). Correction of shock, If peripheral perfusion is poor, it is reasonable to give 20 ml/kg of normal saline initially. If perfusion remains poor, the use of dopamine should be considered. Fluid balance. Give IV fluids at 2/3 maintenance. Use 10% dextrose. Monitor blood glucose with dextrostix and do not let it fall below 2. 2 mmol (explains glucose administration) Prevent/control convulsions. In less severely affected babies, phenobarbitone should be given when there is anyuspicion of actual or impending convulsions (phenobarbitone loading dose 20 mg/kg IM or 10mg/kg slowly IV, then 5 mg/kg daily orally). Treat hvpocaleaemia if it occurs (or more practically, if the baby has uncontrollable fitting with anormal dextrostix). (explains calcium gluconate administration) Notes I.

Myoclonic jerks, especially in the morning, are of variable intensity ranging from simple twitching (\"flying saucer syndrome\") to falls; consciousness is not impaired in it. It is precipitated by alcohol and sleep deprivation. Patients will have normal intelligence. The typical interictal EEG abnormality consists of a generalized 4- to 6-Hz spike or polyspike and slow-wave discharges lasting 1-20 seconds. Usually, 1-3 spikes precede each slow wave. Also know: In Generalized tonic clonic seizure EEG shows a normal background with generalized epileptiform discharges such as spike or polyspike wave complexes at 2. 5 to 4 Hz. During absence seizures there is an abrupt onset of bilaterally synchronous and symmetrical 3 Hz spike-wave discharge, irrespective of whether typical absences are simple or complex. Ictal recordings from patients with typical temporal lobe epilepsy usually exhibit 5-7 Hz, rhythmic, sharp theta activity, maximal in the sphenoidal and the basal temporal electrodes on the side of seizure origin.

Because of neutropenia, these patients suffer from severe infections e. g., omphalitis (infection of the navel), Pneumonia, Skin abscesses, otitis media. Kostmann's syndrome is believed to be caused due to defect in the receptor of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) on neutrophils (granulocytes). The purpose of this receptor is the binding of the granulocyte to the cytokine (GCSF) in order to give the signal to the cell to mature and multiply. Patients with Kostamann's syndrome produce GCSF but because of the defect in GCSF receptor the response of neutrophils to normal amounts of GCSF in the blood is reduced: However, they can respond if the amount of GCSF is increased -> These patients will respond to a higher dose of GCSE",
