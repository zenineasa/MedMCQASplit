The son or the daughter inherits two identical copies of the chromosome with the mutation (isodisomy) and so develops the disease. Uniparental disomy (UPD) occurs when a person receives two copies of a chromosome, or pa of a chromosome, from one parent and no copies from the other parent.

But this method is not helpful in case of neonates because all neonates born to HIV infected mothers will have IgG antibody in their blood, regardless of infection status in them. These antibodies are passively transferred to the newborns from their mothers (IgG can cross placenta). These infants continue to test positive for IgG antibodies for upto 18 months. At the end of 18 month they will lose these antibodies so uptil 18 month of age this method of diagnosis cannot be used.\nThe presence of IgA or IgM anti HIV in the infant's blood can indicate HIV infection, because these classes of antibodies do not cross the placenta. However detectable quantities of IgA antibodies are detected only after 3 months of life and detection of IgM antibodies is very unreliable (both insensitive and nonspecific).\nSo direct viral detection assays are used for the diagnoses of HIV in newborn. These are\n\n\ndetection of HIV DNA or RNA by PCR. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nHIV culture\nHIV p24 antigen\nImmune complex dissociated p24 antigen\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese are very useful in young infants allowing a definitive diagnosis in most infected infants by 1\u2014 6 months of age.

Edwards syndrome or trisomy 18, has features of small palpebral fissures, low-set ears, low bih weight, microcephaly, rocker-bottom feet, cleft lip, hypotonia, and clenched hands. Fetal alcohol syndrome is characterized by growth retardation, small palpebral fissures, smooth philtrum, a thin upper lip, microcephaly, and a sho nose.

        "exp": "Ans. is `c' i.e., 10th day Circulatory adjustments at bih o These are brought about because of a shift from placental dependance for gas exchange in the fetus to pulmonary gas exchange in neonate. I) Pulmonary circulation Immediatly after bih lungs expand due to first few breaths of neonate. This causes a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance (02 causes pulmonary vasodilatation). This results in increased flow into pulmonary trunk and aeries. The pulmonary aery pressure falls due to lowering of pulmonary vascular resistance. The pressure relations between aoa and pulmonary trunk are reversed so that the blood flow through the ductus aeriosus is reversed --> Instead of blood flowing from the pulmonary aery to aoa, the direction of flow through ductus, is from aoa to pulmonary trunk. Increasing oxygen saturation causes the muscle of ductus to constrict --> In full term neonates the ductus aeriosus closes within 10 to 25 days. 2) System circulation and circulation through hea Loss of placental circulation and clamping of the cord after bih results in increase in systemic vascular resistance. This tends to increase the aoic blood pressure and the left ventricular systolic pressure. The loss of placental circulation results in sudden reduction of flow through ductus venosus which closes off --> Flow through ductus venosus disappears by the 7th day of posnatal life. The loss of placental flow results in a decrease in the volume of blood returning to right atrium --> Right atrial pressure decreases. The left atrial pressure becomes higher than right atrial pressure and the septum primum which ats as a valve of fossa ovalis, approximates with the septum secundum to close off formen ovale. Functional closure of foramen ovale occurs very quickly. Over a period of months, the septum primum and septum secundum become firmly adherent resulting in anatomical closure of the foramen ovale. o After closure of ductus aeriosus, there is establishment of postnatal circulation : - The blood reaching the right atrium through IVC and SVC is emptied into the right ventricle from where it is pumped into pulmonary trunk. After coursing through lungs for gas exchange, it reaches the left atrium. and ventricle. The left ventricle pumps it out for distribution in the body for oxygenation of the tissues. The venous return again comes back to right atrium through IVC and SVC. All of the blood leaving the right ventricle, after coursing through lungs, reaches the left ventricle --> The two ventricles are connected in series and therefore, the output of right and left ventricles are same (in contrast to fetal circulation, where right ventricular output is more).",

The anemia of b thalassemia is microcytic and hypochromic with anisocytosis. Amino acid substitutions in b globin lead to hemoglobinopathies, of which sickle cell anemia is the archetype. Homozygotes with these hemoglobin variants do not produce any HbA, but rather mutant types, such as HbS, HbC and HbM. Antibodies against fetal blood cells are generally produced by a mother who has been sensitized to fetal blood antigens by transfusion or a previous pregnancy. Such immune-mediated hemolysis leads to intrauterine anemia and hydrops fetalis.

Hea failure within the first 12 to 18 hours of life is usually a result of malformations that involve pressure or volume overload independent of pulmonary flow, as occurs with severe valvular regurgitation or a systemic aeriovenous fistula. Full-term infants presenting with severe hea failure during the remainder of the first week have critical obstruction to systemic aerial flow. Examples are aoic atresia, coarctation of the aoa, interruption of the aoic arch, and critical aoic stenosis. During the second week of life, aoic atresia and coarctation remain the most common causes of hea failure.

Causes of Vitamin A deficiency include causes of Vitamin A deficiency are inadequate intake, fat malabsorption, or liver disorders The ocular manifestations of vitamin A are collectively called xerophthalmia .It can affect any age group, but its most severe blinding complications affect children aged 6 months to 3 years. The WHO classification of vitamin A deficiency is as follows: XNNight blindness:Night blindness is the earliest clinical symptom X1A Conjunctival xerosis XIB Bitot's spot : Bitot's spots are the buildup of keratin located superficially in the conjunctiva, which are oval, triangular or irregular in shape. X2 Corneal xerosis X3A Corneal ulceration/keratomalacia involving one-third or less of the cornea X3B Corneal ulceration/keratomalacia involving one-half or more of the cornea XS Corneal scar Treatment Oral therapy: The oral regimen of vitamin A is 200,000 IU on day of presentation, next day, and 2-4 weeks later. Children less than 1 year of age or less than 8 kg should receive half the dose of the above dose. Repeat 200,000 IU every 6 months up to 6 years of age to prevent recurrence. Parenteral therapy: If the patient has severe disease, is unable to take oral feeds, or has malabsorption, the preferable dose is 100,000 IU of vitamin A given intramuscularly. Children with severe measles should also receive vitamin A as they are very likely to be benefited from such therapy both in terms of saving sight and reducing case fatality. Prevention Prophylaxis consists of periodic administration of Vitamin A supplements. WHO recommended schedule, which is universally recommended is as follows: Infants 6-12 months old and any older children weighing less than 8 kg - 100,000 IU orally every 3-6 months Children over 1 year and under 6 years of age - 200,000 IU orally every 6 months Infants less than 6 months old, who are not being breastfed - 50,000 IU orally should be given before they attain the age of 6 months",

Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, due to lack of the enzyme gulonolactone oxidase and therefore depend on dietary sources. Vitamin C is not stored in the body, but is taken up by all tissues; the highest levels are found in the pituitary and adrenal glands. This disorder occurs more frequently in children (paicularly infants) than in adults, and for the most pa, results from a diet of pasteurized or boiled milk. (This type of milk is deficient in vitamin C because the vitamin is inactivated by heat). For scurvy to develop, the deficiency must be present for a long time of approx. 4 to 6 months. Therefore it is unlikely that the disorder will be seen before the age of 4-6 months. The occurrence of scurvy in adults is rare, being seen mostly in patients suffering from chronic severe malnutrition. Vitamin C is essential for the hydroxylation of lysine and proline in collagen formation. The defect in collagen synthesis results in inadequate suppo of the walls of capillaries and venules leading to bleeding in the skin and in the gingival mucosa, haemahroses, and subperiosteal hemorrhages. The gums are swollen and bleed easily. Bleeding in the skin causes petechiae, eccyhmoses, perifollicular hemorrhages. Skeletal changes may also develop in infants and children. The pritnaly disturbance is in the formation of osteoid matrix, rather than in mineralization or calcification. (Rickets is characterized by the presence of excess osteoid and lack of calcification; whereas scurvy is associated with deficient osteoid and much calcified cailage). The potential for skeletal lesions diminish with increasing age. The skeletal changes are most pronounced in regions of active endochondral bone growth and therefore are best seen in the distal end of the long bones paicularly of the lower extremity. Changes at the sternal ends of the ribs cause scorbutic rosary formation. Key imaging features of scurvy or Vit. \"C\" Def Osteoporosis White line of Frank!

        "exp": "Septic shock in children\n\nSeptic shock is an inflammatory state resulting from a systemic response to bacterial infection.\nThe decrease in peripheral resistance (vasodilatation) is the hallmark of early (hyper dynamic) stage of septic shock, this feature distinguishes it from other types of shock. Decreased peripheral resistance (vasodilatation) leads to a compensatory increase in cardiac output; therefore, cardiac output is maintained or some time increased despite of shock.\nDecreased peripheral resistance and increased cardiac output lead to increased blood flow and total oxygen delivery to the tissue. But, still, the tissues lack O2 due to local microcirculatory changes produced as a result of sepsis which causes decrease tissue extraction of oxygen. So, increased blood flow and cardiac out are still inadequate to meet the total metabolic needs of the tissue which are increased in sepsis.\nAs sepsis progresses, hypo dynamic stage supervenes in which there is decreased cardiac output and increased peripheral resistance.\nSo, hemodynamic changes in septic shock occur in two characteristic patterns, Early hyperdynamic and late hypo dynamic shock\n\n1) Early hyperdynamic shock\n\nHypotension is a late feature of septic shock and early hyperdynamic stage is characterized by normal or increased BR\nOther features are : -\nTachycardia \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nNormal or increased cardiac output \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nTachypnea\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWarm extremities\u00a0\nDecreased systemic vascular resistance\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIncreased pulmonary vascular resistance\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n2) Late hypo dynamic stage\n\nDecreased cardiac output \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nHypotension \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nIncreased vascular resistance\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCool, mottled and often cyanotic extremities\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOliguria, renal failure\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nHypothermia",

Although bihs of LBW infants make up only about 6% to 7% of all bihs, they account for greater than 70% of neonatal deaths. IUGR is the most common cause of LBW in developing countries, whereas most LBW in infants in developed countries is secondary to prematurity.

In atrial septal defect , left-to-right shunting causes volume overloading of the right ventricle, the increased flow across the pulmonic valve producing a mid systolic pulmonary ejection murmur. The second hea sound is widely split. A diastolic murmur may also be heard, reflecting increased flow from the right atrium into the right ventricle. Pulmonic stenosis typically produces a harsh systolic ejection murmur best heard at the upper left sternal border, often preceded by a systolic ejection sound. Tetralogy of Fallot is a form of cyanotic congenital hea disease characterized by ventricular septal defect, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, an overriding aoa, and right ventricular hyperophy. The hea is often described as \"boot-shaped\" on chest x- ray. Ref: Darst J.R., Collins K.K., Miyamoto S.D. (2012). Chapter 20. Cardiovascular Diseases. In W.W. Hay, Jr., M.J. Levin, R.R.

Central or true precocious pubey Results from excessive GnRH, gonadotropins and target sex hormone elaborated by premature activation of hypothlamic pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. 2. Peripheral or pseudo-precocious pubey Due to increased sex steroid secretion from either the adrenal gland or the gonads. It is independent of HPG axis activation Causes of Precocious pubey A. Central precocious pubey 1. Idiopathic : Sporadic or familial. 2. Central nervous system abnormalities i) Congenital anomalies of CNS: Hypothalamic hamaoma, hydrocephalus, porencephaly, arachnoid cysts. ii) Acquired lesions of CNS : Inflammation, granuloma, trauma, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy. iii) Tumors of CNS : Pineal tumors, optic glioma, ependymoma, camiopharyngioma. iv) Hypothyroidism B. Peripheral precocious pubey : Isosexual Girls 1. Ovarian causes : McCune-Albright syndrome, benign follicular cysts, granulosa-theca cell tumors; Gonadoblastoma 2. Adrenal causes : Feminizing adrenal neoplasia 3. Exogenous estrogen administration Boys 1. Testis : Leydig cell tumor, adrenal rest tumor, testotoxicosis. 2. Adrenal: CAH (21 or 11-(3 hydroxylase deficiency), virilizing tumors. 3. hCG secreting tumors : Hepatoma, hepatoblastoma, choriocarcinoma, chorionepithelioma, teratoma, dysgerminoma. Exogenous testosterone C. Heterosexual precocity 1. Girls : Virilization in girls due to virilizing CAH, ovarian or adrenal neoplasia, polycystic ovarian disease. 2. Boys : Feminization due to estogen producing adrenal tumors, exogenous estrogen, marijuana smoking.

Osteolytic lesions can lead to pathological fractures. Skin: Commonly seen are a rash which varies from scaly erythematous lesions to red papules pronounced in interiginous areas. Up to 80% of LCH patients have extensive eruptions on the scalp. Bone marrow: Pancytopenia with superadded infection usually implies a poor prognosis. Anemia can be due to a number of factors and does not necessarily imply bone marrow infiltration.

        "exp": "Early in sickle cell anemia, affected children usually have an enlarged spleen. The spleen enlarges because the children are in a state of hypersplenism, in which the spleen vigorously phagocytizes any abnormally shaped erythrocytes. During the first decade of life, sickling within the spleen occludes its blood flow, causing repeated small infarctions, leading to \"autosplenectomy.\" The autosplenectomy is actually helpful to the patient hematologically, as it may ameliorate the chronic anemia. Unfounately, the lack of a functional spleen renders the patients susceptible to infections with Salmonella and encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Patients with sickle cell anemia are not paicularly vulnerable to chronic infection, although acute infections can trigger painful crises. Patients with sickle cell anemia do not have an increased incidence of either Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Ref: Natarajan K., Townes T.M., Kutlar A. (2010). Chapter 48.

The fontanelle allows the skull to deform during bih to ease its passage through the bih canal and for expansion of the brain after bih. While the posterior and lateral fontanelles are obliterated by about six months after bih, the anterior is not completely closed until about the middle of the second year.

Congenital neutropenia is usually very severe and neutrophils are often completely absent in the blood of these patients at the time of diagnosis. These patients usually show arrest of maturation of neutrophils at the promyelocyte stage. - This means that their neutrophils rarely. fully mature into the cells that are capable of fighting infections. - As a result these patients usually suffer from severe infections ? - Omphalitis (infection of the navel) - Pneumonia - Skin abscesses - Otitis media during their first few years of life. Pathogenesis Kostmann's syndrome or severe congenital neutropenia is believed to he caused by defect in a gene on chromosome (in p35-p34.3) that codes for granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF). This disease is believed to be caused due to defect in receptor in granulocyte colony stimulator factor. - This receptor is located on granulocytes or neutrophils. The purpose of this receptor is the binding of the granulocyte to the cytokine (GCSF) in order to give signal to the cell to mature, to multiply, and enhance .function. GCSF is a natural cytokine produced by the human body. - Patients with congenital neutropenia also produce GCSF hut because of the defect in GCSF receptor the response of their neutrophils to the normal amounts of GCSF in the blood is reduced. - These patients will respond to higher dose of GCSF (This is the basis of tit of disease). In some patients the GCSF receptor develops changes that could also indicate progression towards leukemia. Treatment Patients with congenital neutropenia respond to administration of GCSF. - As soon as congenital neutropenia is diagnosed, patients should sta treatment with GCSF. - This treatment usually stabilizes the neutrophil count of the patient. - The response of these patients to GCSF treatment is different. There is a big variation in the dose of GCSF that different people receive. - A small group of patient does not respond to even very high doses of GCSF. In patients who do not respond to GCSF doses of 100 mcg/kg within foueen days, a search for bone marrow donor should be staed immediately and bone marrow transplantation should be performed as soon as matching donor is identified.",

(Panniculitis Inflammation of the subcutaneous, fat) Physical panniculitis Panniculitis that occurs. from physical factors Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn - It is a lobular panniculitis - It occurs in full term or post term healthy infants typically at 1-6 weeks of life or soon thereafter. - The lesion consists of one or small number of finn, nontender, erythematous nodules or plaques on the face buttocks, and or extremities. - The nodules may often break down and discharge oily material. - Over the next.few weeks or month the nodules resolve spontaneously. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is complicated by hypercalcemia - Hypercalcemia is the only significant complication and founately it occurs in minority of patients. - Manifestations of hypercalcemia include irritability. failure to thrive, hypeonia, nausea, vomiting. Pathogenesis is unknown with several hypotheses -The etiology of subcutaneous .fat necrosis is unknown but in some patients., bih trauma, asphyxia, difficult labour or hypothermia have been noted. - Perhaps diffuse tissue hypoxia predisposes to these conditions. Some believe that it occurs because of the differences in the composition of fatty acids. - In contrast to adult. fat, the subcutaneous fat of infants is thought to prone to crystal formation because of a higher content of saturated fatty acid including palmitic acid and stearic acid, and lower content of unsaturated fatty acid such as oleic acid. - The increased saturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio results in higher melting point for stored fat and promotes crystallization. Treatment - Treatment will not he required as the lesion will resolve - Most infants have resolution of the lesion within 1-2 in - Parents should be reassured of the benign nature of this - They should be educated about the sign and symptoms o - Serum calcium should be measured whenever symptoms Post setorid panniculitis It is rare .form of panniculitis, occurs predominantly coicosteroids during rapid coicosteroid withdraw'. coicosteroid therapy. Firm subcutaneous nodules begin to appear within a month of tapering of the coicosteroids. Areas of abundant subcutaneous fat are oured i.e. cheek, trunks, proximal extremities. Most cases resolve spontaneously but if severe, the steroids must be reinstituted and tapered more slowly. Histologically the changes are identical to those seen in subcu- taneous fat necrosis of the newborn -There is a lobular panniculitis with necrosis of adipocytes and needle shaped clefts in both adipocytes and histiocytes. Foamy histiocytes are also present. - It was believed that the withdrawl of coicosteroids therapy leads to abnormal lipid metabolism resulting in the elevation of saturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio. Sclerema Neonataram Sclerema neonatarum is much less common than subcutaneous fat necrosis but much serious and life threatening. It affects preteen and term baby. In this entity premature or term babies, develop, rapidly progressive diffuse nonedematous hardening of subcutaneous tissue beginning on the trunk or buttocks and extending to the entire body surface area. These infants have difficulty in maintaining body temperature with recurrent or persistent hypothermia. The newborns are usually sick.

The growth spu stas at about age 9 years in girls and peaks at age 111/2 years, usually at SMR 3-4 breast development and stage 3 pubic hair development. The spu usually ends by age 14 years.

In this patient, the shifting of the site of maximal cardiac impulse to right side after ET tube inseion and ventilation, suggest that ET tube was wrongly inseed into esophagus instead of trachea. SO the most appropriate next step is to confirm ET tube position and reinse it. Chest X ray cannot differentiate whether ET tube is inseed in trachea or esophagus as esophagus is situated just behind trachea. Treatment of CDH includes endotracheal intubation followed by ventilation with a rate of 40 to 60 breaths/min and lowest peak inspiratory pressures that allow for normal chest rise which inturn help to avoid pneumothoraces due to barotrauma to the hypoplastic lungs.

        "exp": "A child with glycosuria, polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss despite increased appetite is likely to have type 1 diabetes mellitus. This form of diabetes has an impoant autoimmune component to its etiology. As many as 85% of patients have islet cell autoantibodies in their blood in the first few weeks after onset of the disease. Most of these antibodies are directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase, an enzyme that is present in b cells. Insulin deficiency leads to decreased glucose uptake and hyperglycemia. The increase in blood glucose results in increased glycosylation of hemoglobin in red blood cells. Hence, the hemoglobin A1c concentration will be increased, not decreased, reflecting long-standing hyperglycemia. Another consequence of the increased blood glucose is increased serum osmolarity (not decreased). If the osmolarity exceeds 330 mOsm/L, consciousness begins to be impaired.beta; cell destruction in type 1 diabetes leads to decreased secretion of insulin. Since insulin and C-peptide are released on a 1:1 ratio by the beta; cells, the secretion of C-peptide is also decreased . Insulin is first synthesized as preproinsulin, with an initial leader sequence of hydrophobic amino acids that allows the developing protein to be extruded from the ribosomes into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The \"pre\" segment is then cleaved off, leaving proinsulin. Proinsulin is packaged into secretory granules within the Golgi, and as the granules bud off, enzymes cleave the precursor into insulin and C-peptide. Ref: Klein U. (2012). Chapter 17.

Fi02 : Fractional Inspiratory 02, here in the ventilator settings, is 75% well above the normal. Respiratory Rate settings in the ventilator is 50/min : Normal for that age. Now, we have the complete picture here : The premature baby is having HMD, and so has been put on Aificial respiration. The Fi02 being given is in the higher normal range, and also the paial pressure of 0, in the neonates blood is acceptable . So we will avoid increasing the Fi0,, as this carries a risk of blindness by ROP (Retinopathy of Prematurity). As a rule, we avoid tampering with the ventilator rate settings, because it causes changes in the CO, levels of the blood, and consequent disturbances in the acid - base balance.

Weaning from ventilator will sta once the baby shows hyper - oxygenation with the currect settings, i.e. the p02 in the range of 120 .
