Symptomaticcongenital disease usually occurs when a mother has a primary CMV infection in the first trimester of pregnancy. Many of these babies die, and those who survive are severely affected. In case of reactivation of CMV infection during pregnancya maternal IgG passed transplacentally, protects the baby against infection. Most infants infected during this secondary maternal infection are asymptomatic but about 10% of them eventually manifest hearing and neurologic problems. Some recommend keeping a child with congenital CMV infection away from susceptible pregnant women because CMV excretion can persist for months to years.
