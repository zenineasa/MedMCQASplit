        "exp": "Ref: Nelson's Textbook of Pediatrics. 19th Edition. Explanation: Weak femoral pulse is indicative of Coarctation of aorta. Normally, the femoral pulse occurs slightly before the radial pulse. Weak femoral pulse or femoral pulse felt after radial pulse is a characteristic feature of COACoarctation of aorta (COA). Constrictions of the aorta of varying degrees may occur at any point from the transverse arch to the iliac bifurcation, hut 98% occur just below the origin of the left subclavian artery at the origin of the ductus arteriosus i juxtaductal coarctation). The anomaly occurs twice as often in males as in females. Coarctation of the aorta may be a feature of Turner syndrome and is associated with a bicuspid aortic valve in more than 70% of patients. Mitral valve abnormalities (a supravalvular mitral ring or parachute mitral valve) and subaortic stenosis are potential associated lesions. When this group of left-sided obstructive lesions occurs together, they are referred to as the Shone complex. Clinical Manifestations. Mostly asymptomatic. Some children or adolescents complain about weakness or pain in the legs after exercise. Silent hypertension diagnosed on routine physical examination. Disparity in pulsation and blood pressure in the arms and legs. The femoral, popliteal, posterior tibia], and dorsalis pedis pulses are weak (or absent in up to 40%' of patients), in contrast to the bounding pulses of the arms and carotid vessels. The radial and femoral pulses should always be palpated simultaneously for the presence of a radial-femora] delay. Normally, the femoral pulse occurs slightly before the radial pulse. A radial-femoral delay occurs when blood flow to the descending aorta is dependent on collaterals, in which case the femora] pulse is felt after the radial pulse. In normal persons, systolic blood pressure in the legs obtained by the cuff method is 10-20 mm Hg higher than that in the arms. In coarctation of the aorta, blood pressure in the legs is lower than that in the arms. The precordial impulse and heart sounds are usually normal. The presence of a systolic ejection click or thrill in the suprasternal notch suggests a bicuspid aortic valve (present in 709c of cases). A short systolic murmur is often heard along the left sternal border at the 3rd and 4th intercostal spaces. In older patients with well-developed collateral blood flow, systolic or continuous murmurs may be heard over the left and right sides of the chest laterally and posteriorly. (SUZMAN SIGN). In these patients, a palpable thri 11 can occasionally be appreciated in the intercostal spaces on the back. Diagnosis. Cardiac enlargement and pulmonary congestion are noted in infants with severe coarctation. The enlarged left subclavian artery commonly produces a prominent shadow in the left superior mediastinum. Notching of the inferior border of the ribs from pressure erosion by enlarged collateral vessels is common by late childhood. In most instances, the descending aorta has an area of poststenotic dilatation.",

In most adults with PDA, pulmonary pressures are normal and a gradient and shunt from aorta to pulmonary artery persist throughout the cardiac cycle, resulting in a characteristic thrill and a continuous \"machinery\" murmur with late systolic accentuation at the upper left sternal edge. PATENT DUCTUS ARTERIOSUSThe ductus arteriosus is a vessel leading from the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery to the aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery. Normally, the vascular channel is open in the fetus but closes immediately after birth. The flow across the ductus is determined by the pressure and resistance relationships between the systemic and pulmonary circulations and by the cross-sectional area and length of the ductus. In adults who were bom with a large left-to-right shunt through the ductus arteriosus, pulmonary vascular obstruction (Eisenmenger syndrome) with pulmonary hypertension, right-to- left shunting, and cyanosis have usually developed. Severe pulmonary vascular disease results in reversal of flow through the ductus; unoxygenated blood is shunted to the descending aorta; and the toes-but not the fingers-become cyanotic and clubbed, a finding termed differential cyanosis. The leading causes of death in adults with patent ductus are cardiac failure and infective endocarditis. Treatment: Patent Ductus Arteriosus. In the absence of severe pulmonary vascular disease and predominant left-to-right shunting of blood, the patent ductus should be surgically ligated or divided.

THE NEONATAL CIRCULATION# At birth, the fetal circulation must immediately adapts to extrauterine life as gas exchange is transferred from the placenta to the lung.- After an initial slight fall in systemic blood pressure, a progressive rise occurs with increasing age. 0- The heart rate slows as a result of a baroreceptor response to an increase in systemic vascular resistance when the placental circulation is eliminated.- The average central aortic pressure in a term neonate is 75/50 mm Hg.- The onset of ventilation, pulmonary vascular resistance is markedly decreased as a consequence of both active (PO2 related) and passive (mechanical related) pulmonary vasodilation.* The major decline in pulmonary resistance from the high fetal levels to the low \"adult\" levels in the human infant at sea level usually occurs within the 1st 2-3 days but may be prolonged for 7 days or more.* Over the 1st several weeks of life, pulmonary vascular resistance decreases even further, secondary to remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature, including thinning of the vascular smooth muscle and recruitment of new vessels. Significant differences between the neonatal circulation and that of older infants include:- right-to-left or left-to-right shunting may persist across the patent foramen ovale;- in the presence of cardiopulmonary disease, continued patency of the ductus arteriosus may allow left-to-right, right-to-left, or bidirectional shunting;- the neonatal pulmonary vasculature constricts more vigorously in response to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis;- the wall thickness and muscle mass of the neonatal left and right ventricles are almost equal; and- newborn infants at rest have relatively high oxygen consumption, which is associated with relatively high cardiac output.# The newborn cardiac output is about 350 mL/kg/min.# CO falls in the 1st 2 months of life to about 150 mL/kg/min# Then more gradually to the normal adult cardiac output of about 75 mL/kg/min.# The foramen ovale is functionally closed by the 3rd mo of life.# Functional closure of the ductus arteriosus is usually complete by 10--15 hr in a normal neonate0# The normal ductus arteriosus differs morphologically from the adjoining aorta and pulmonary artery in that the ductus has a significant amount of circularly arranged smooth muscle in its medial layer.# During fetal life, patency of the ductus arteriosus appears to be maintained by the combined relaxant effects of low oxygen tension and endogenously produced prostaglandins, specifically prostaglandin E2# In a full-term neonate, orygen is the most important factor controlling ductal closure. 0# 'When the PO2 of the blood passing through the ductus reaches about 50 mm Hg, the ductal wall constricts.",

The ECG pattern in the figure shows the configuration of preexcitation, the pattern seen in the WPW syndrome. These patients have an aberrant atrioventricular conduction pathway, which causes the early ventricular depolarization appearing on the ECG as a shortened PR interval. The initial slow ventricular depolarization wave is referred to as the delta wave. Seventy percent of patients with WPW syndrome have single or repeated episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, which can cause the symptoms described in the question. The preexcitation ECG pattern and WPW syndrome can occur in Ebstein malformation, but this is unlikely in the absence of cyanosis and with a normal echocardiogram. If ventricular tachycardia were present, the symptoms would likely be more profound. Active play and exposure to over-the-counter medications containing sympathomimetics in a healthy 4- year-old child can cause symptoms such as those described in the question in children with WPW syndrome by precipitating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.",

When pulmonary vascular resistance is relatively high immediately after birth, pulmonary blood flow may be normal; as pulmonary resistance drops in the 1st mo of life, blood flow to the lungs is greatly increased and heart failure ensues.* Truncus arteriosus is a total mixing lesion with complete admixture of pulmonary and systemic venous return.* Because of the large volume of pulmonary blood flow, clinical cyanosis is usually mild. If the lesion is left untreated, pulmonary resistance eventually increases, pulmonary blood flow decreases, and cyanosis becomes more prominent.* The clinical signs of truncus arteriosus vary with age and depend on the level of pulmonary vascular resistance. In the immediate newborn period, signs of heart failure are usually absent; a murmur and minimal cyanosis may be the only initial findings.* Over the next 1-2 month of life, pulmonary blood flow begins to become torrential and the clinical picture is dominated by heart failure, with still mild cyanosis.",

In older children, exercise intolerance can be noted if the lesion is of significant size. On examination, the pulses are normal, a right ventricular systolic lift at the left sternal border is palpable, and a fixed splitting of the second heart sound is audible. For lesser degrees of ASD, surgical treatment is controversial. VSD commonly presents as a harsh or blowing holosystolic murmur best heard along the left lower sternum, often with radiation throughout the precordium. The auscultatory finding of tricuspid regurgitation is typically a blowing holosystolic murmur, augmented during inspiration, and best heard at the left lower sternal border; a middiastolic rumble may also be heard. A history of birth asphyxia or findings of other cardiac lesions may be present. Tetralogy of Fallot is a common form of congenital heart disease. The four abnormalities include right ventricular outflow obstruction, VSD, dextroposition of the aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy; the cyanosis presents in infants and in young children. Mitral valve prolapse occurs with the billowing into the atria of one or both mitral valve leaflets at the end of systole. It is a congenital abnormality that frequently manifests only during adolescence or later. It is more common in girls than in boys and seems to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. On clinical examination, an apical murmur is noted late in systole, which can be preceded by a midsystolic click. The diagnosis is confirmed with an echocardiogram that shows prolapse of the mitral leaflets during mid to late systole.",

PGE1 and PGE2 keep the DA open via involvement of specific PGE-sensitive receptors (such as EP2 or EP4). o EP4 is the major receptor associated with PGE2-induced dilation of the DA and can be found across the DA in smooth muscle cells. o Immediately after birth, the levels of both PGE2 and the EP4 receptors reduce significantly, allowing for closure of the DA and establishment of normal postnatal circulation. Ductus arteriosuso Ductus arteriosus is a shunt between pulmonary trunk and desending Aorta. o Functional closure of ductus occurs within 15 hours after birth. Increasing oxygen saturation causes the muscle of ductus to constrict -In full term neonates the ductus arteriosus closes within 10 to 25 days (Anatomic closure).

Neonatal seizures or neonatal convulsions are epileptic fits occurring from birth to the end of the neonatal periodQ. The neonatal period is the most vulnerable of all periods of life for developing seizures, particularly in the first 1-2 days to the first week from birthQ. Etiology: MC cause is hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, responsible for 80% of all seizures in the first 2 days of lifeQ. Brain damage due to prenatal distress and malformations of cortical developmentQ. Intracranial haemorrhage and infarction, stroke. Prenatal and neonatal infections. Acute metabolic disturbances such as electrolyte and glucose abnormalities. Inborn errors of metabolism. Pathophysiology. Early postnatal development time is a period of increased susceptibility to seizures in relation to other ages, due to a combination of factors specific to the developing brain that enhance excitation and diminish inhibitionQ. Diagnostic Procedures: Polygraphic video-EEG recording of suspected events is probably mandatory for an incontrovertible seizure diagnosis. Brain Imaging: Cranial ultrasonograghy is the main imaging modality of premature neonates and well suited for the study of neonates in generalQ. It is performed at the bedside and provides effective assessment of ventricular size and other fluid-containing lesions as well as effective viewing of haemorrhagic and ischaemic lesions and their evolution. CT brain scan is often of secondary or adjunctive importance to ultrasound. Last-generation CT brain scan images are of high resolution, can be generated within seconds and can accurately detect haemorrhage, infarction, gross malformations and ventricular and other pathological conditions.

NOTE: Most congenital defects are well tolerated in the fetus because of the parallel nature of the fetal circulation. Even the most severe cardiac defects (hypoplastic left heart syndrome) can usually be well compensated for by the fetal circulation. It is only after birth when the fetal pathways (ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale) are closed that the full hemodynamic impact of an anatomic abnormality becomes apparent. One notable exception is the case of severe regurgitant lesions, most commonly of the tricuspid valve. In these lesions (Ebstein anomaly), the parallel fetal circulation cannot compensate for the volume load imposed on the right side of the heart. In utero heart failure, often with fetal pleural and pericardial effusions, and generalized ascites (nonimmune hydrops fetalis) may occur.",
