Chloroquine, quinine, quinidine, halofantrine, and aemisinin compounds are the rapidly acting drugs that can terminate an acute malaria attack. While chloroquine acts rapidly, resistance is widespread, and an accurate travel history should be obtained before choosing the antimalarial drug.

P falciparummalaria incurred in Southeast Asia may be quinine and mefloquine resistant as well; a combination of aesunate and mefloquine, or aesunate and lumefantrine, is recommended.
