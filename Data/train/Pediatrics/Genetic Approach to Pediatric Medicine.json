(Other variants can have 48 XXXY, rarely 49 XXXXY or mosaics can be there with some cells containing normal 46, XY and others 47, XXY). Classically, it results from meiotic non-dysjunction of sex chromosomes (40% during spermatogenesis and 60% during oogenesis). Mostly, non-dysjunction occur during 1st meiotic divisiono The patient has male phenotype with feminizing features due to extra X-chromosome (note : presence of one Y chromosome is sufficient for male phenotype. Thus XY, XXY, XXXY all are males). Extra inactive chromosome appears as Barr body.o Important clinical features include microorchidism with nonnal external genitalia, mental retardation, gynecomastia, lack of secondary sexual characteristics with eunuchoid(PGI 01) body habits, disproportionately long arms and legs, hypogonadism, increased incidence of tumors (breast carcinoma, germ cell tumors), increased incidence of autoimmune disorders (e.g. SLE), and cardiac problems (most common is mitral valve prolapse).

Phenylketonuria o Autosomal recessive o Deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. o Defect in conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. o This leads to increase level of phenylalanine, o This increase phenlylalanine converted into phenylpyruvate and phenyl acetate, o This phenyl acetate gives mousy or musty odour in urine/body.",
