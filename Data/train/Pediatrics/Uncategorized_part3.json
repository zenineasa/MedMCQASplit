After this upper airway obstruction becomes apparent. The child then develops the characteristic barking cough, hoarseness and inspiratory stridor. Symptoms are characteristically worse at night and often recur with decreasing intensity for several days and resolve completely within a week. Agitation and crying greatly aggravates the signs and symptoms. The child may prefer to sit up in bed or be held upright. Croup is a disease of the upper airway and alveolar gas exchange is usually normal. It is a clinical diagnosis and does not require a radiograph of the neck. Radiographs of the neck may show the typical subglottic narrowing or \"steeple sign\" of croup on the posteroanterior view. Croup Mild disease Occasional barking cough No stridor at rest Mild or nonexistent suprasternal or subcostal retractions Moderate disease Frequent cough Audible stridor at rest Visible retractions Little distress or agitation Severe disease Frequent cough Prominent inspiratory (and occasionally, expiratory) stridor Conspicuous retractions Decreased entry on auscultations Treatment of Croup Cornerstone of treatment Glucocoicoids Nebulized epinephrine Glucocoicoids are useful in -- Mild - Moderate and - Severe croup Dexamethasone is the most effective coicosteroid Nebulized epinephrine Useful in Moderate to severe distress (works by adrenergic stimulation, which causes constriction of the precapillary aerioles, thereby decreasing capillary hydrostatic pressure. This leads to fluid resorption from the interstitium and improvement in laryngeal mucosal edema). Antibiotics are not indicated cool mist (used earlier) Heliox (mixture of oxygen and helium. It has low viscosity and low specific gravity which allow for greater laminar airflow through the respiratory tract. Complete blood counts and culture - Is of no use in croup because it is a clinical diagnosis, this would be helpful in case of acute epiglotitis but not croup. Nasal washing for influenza & respiratory syncitial virus - Is not required since the time we would get the repo the condition would have been taken care off.",

The symptoms and signs include characteristic features, often a normal bih weight, CNS malformations, eye malformations, cleft lip and palate, polydactyly or syndactyly, and congenital hea disease. The incidence of trisomy 18 syndrome is about 1:4000 live bihs, and the ratio of affected males to females is approximately 1:3. Trisomy 18 is characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth retardation that is often severe, and hypeonicity. Complications are related to associated bih defects. Death is often caused by hea failure or pneumonia and usually occurs in infancy or early childhood, although a small percentage of patients reach adulthood. Characteristic features of Trisomy 21 include upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, midface hypoplasia, and small, dysplastic pinnae. Characteristic features of Turner syndrome (Monosomy X) include webbed neck, triangular facies, sho stature, wide-set nipples, amenorrhea, and absence of secondary sex characteristics.

Wilson disease is caused by mutations in the gene ATP7B on chromosome 13 coding for a specific P-type adenosine triphosphatase involved in copper transpo. This results in impaired bile excretion of copper and incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin by the liver. The disease should be considered in all children older than age 2 years with evidence of liver disease (especially with hemolysis) or with suggestive neurologic signs. Serum ceruloplasmin levels (measured by the oxidase method) are usually less than 20 mg/dL. (Normal values are 23-43 mg/dL.) Low values, however, occur normally in infants younger than 3 months, and in at least 10%-20% of homozygotes the levels may be within the lower end of the normal range (20-30 mg/dL), paicularly if immunoassays are used to measure ceruloplasmin. Rare patients with higher ceruloplasmin levels have been repoed. Serum copper levels are low, but the overlap with normal is too great for satisfactory discrimination. Urine copper excretion in children older than 3 years is normally less than 30 mcg/d; in Wilson disease, it is generally greater than 100 mcg/d although recent repos suggest it can be as low as > 40 mcg/d.

The diagnosis of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is strongly suggested by bilateral papable flank masses in an infant with pulmonary hypoplasia, oligohydramnios and hypeension and the absence of renal cysts in the parents. On imaging and biopsy the kidney shows innumerable cysts radiating from medulla to the coex. The other most notable feature of ARPKD is liver involvement disease in the liver is typically diffuse presenting as poal and interlobular fibrosis. More on autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease Also known as infantile polycystic disease, it is an autosomal recessive disorder. Pathology Both kidneys are markedly enlarged and grossly show innumerable cysts throughout the coex and medulla. Microscopic studies demonstrate cysts elongated and radially arranged from medulla to the coex located primarily within the collecting tubules and the ducts. Development of progressive interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy during advanced stages of disease eventually leads to renal failure. Liver involvement is characterized by bile duct proliferation and ectasia as well as by hepatic fibrosis. Clinical manifestations The typical child presents with bilateral flank masses during the neonatal period or early infancy. In the neonates oligohydramnios results from intrauterine renal failure. Oligohydramnios results in insufficient lung development and the typical potter .facies which is characterized by low set ears, a flat nose and retracted chin. Postnatally the typical child presents with bilateral flank masses, renal insufficiency and hypeension. Hypeension is usually noted within the first few weeks of life and is often severe. Urine output is usually not diminished although oliguria and acute renal failure may be seen. 30% of the patient dies in neonatal period due to pulmonary hypoplasia. Diagnosis The diagnosis of ARPKD is strongly suggested by bilateral palpable flank masses in infant with pulmonary hypoplasia, oligohydramnios, and hypeension and the absence of renal cysts in the parents. Ultrasound demonstrates markedly enlarged and uniformly hyperechogenic kidneys with poor coicomedullary distinction. The diagnosis is also suppoed by clinical/laboratory signs of hepatic fibrosis, pathological findings of ductal plate abnormalities seen on liver biopsy, anatomical and pathological proof of ARPKD in a sibling or parental consanguinity.

This prostaglandin has a vasodilatory effect which keeps the ductus open. o The synthesis of these vasodilator is inhibited at bih by the inhibition of the enzyme cycloxygenase at bih. o Cycloxygenase is an impoant enzyme in the synthetic pathway of prostaglandin. o In many premature infants the ductus fail to close spontaneously. In these cases the closure can be produced by infusion of drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase. o Indomethacin is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme cvclooxvgenase. o Indomethacin is routinely used to close the PDA in premature infants, it does not close the PDA of full term infants or children. The success of indomethacin therapy is as high as 80-90% in premature infants with bih weight over 1200 g. o If indomethacin is not successful and the ductus remains hemodynamically significant, surgical ligation should be performed without hesitation. o Recent studies from Europe indicate that ibuprofen may be as effective as indomethacin for the medical closure of preterm PDA.",

Chest X ray shows hyperluscency and PFT shows obstructive pattern. Most probable diagnosis is ?",
        "exp": "Ans. is `d' i.e., Bronchiolitis obliterans Bronchiolitis obliterans o Bronchiolitis obliterans. is a rare chronic lung disease of the bronchioles and smaller airways. o Bronchiolitis obliterans most commonly occurs inpediatric population after respiratory infections (i.e. adenovirus, mycoplasma, measles, influenza, peussis). o Other causes include connective tissue disease (i.e. juvenile rheumatoid ahritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, scleroderma) o Bronchiolitis occurs in all age groups. Pathogenesis o After the initial insult, inflammation affecting terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts may result in obliteration of the airway lumen. o Epithelial damage resulting in abnormal repair is characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans. Complete or paial obstruction of the airway lumen may result in air trapping or atelactasis. Clinical manifestations Cough, fever, cyanosis and respiratory distress followed by initial improvement may be the initial signs of bronchiolitis obliterans. o Progression of the disease may ensue with increasing dyspnoea, cough, sputum production and wheezing. o Chest radiographs may be relatively normal compared with the extent of physical findings but may demonstrate hyperluscency and patchy infiltrates (occasionally, a swyer James syndrome, i.e. a unilateral hyperluscent lung has developed). o Pulmonary function tests demonstrate varaible findings but typically shows signs of airway obstruction. o Ventilation perfusion scan shows a typical motheaten appearance of multiple matched defects in ventilation and perfusion. o CT scan demonstrates patchy areas of hyperluscency. o Open lung biopsy or transbronchial biopsy remains the best means of establishing the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans. Treatment o No definite therapy exists for bronchiolitis obliterans. o Administration of coicosteroids may be beneficial About other options Follicular bronchitis o It is a lymphoproliferative lung disorder characterized the presence of lymphoid follicles, coursing along the airways (bronchi or bronchioles) o It is rare in children. o Although the cause is unknown, an infectious aetiology has been proposed. o Onset of symptoms generally occurs by 6 weeks of age and peaks between 6 and 18 months. o Cough, moderate fever and fine crackles are common clinical findings. o Fine crackles generally, persist over time and recurrence of symptoms is common. o Chest radiographs may be relatively benign initially but evolve into the typical interstitial pattern. o Pulmonary function tests show restrictive pattern o Chest CT shows fine reticular pattern. Open lung biopsy is used to make definitive diagnosis. Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis o This is a rare disorder. o Although the underlying cause of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is unknown, the disease is characterized by the formation of lamellar concretions of calcium phosphate or \"microlith\", within the alveoli, creating a classic pattern on the radiograph. o Chest radiography typically reveal bilateral infiltrates with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance. o Although the mean age at the time of diagnosis is in the mid 30s the onset of the disease can occur during childhood. When symptomatic, individuals with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis usually complain of dyspnoea on exeion and non productive cough. o Physical examinations of the lungs may reveal fine inspiratory crackles and diminished breath sounds. Clubbing occurs, although this is usually a more advanced sign. o Children are often asymptomatic on initial presentation. Diagnosis o Chest radiography typically reveals b/L infiltrate with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance or \"Sandstorm\" appearance. o CT scan shows diffuse micronodular calcified densities. o Open lung biopsy reveals laminated calcific ioncretions within the alceoli.",

Shock is an acute dramatic syndrome characterized by inadequate circulatory supply of oxygen so that the metabolic demands of vital organs and tissues are not met. Shock has been categorized into series of recognizable stage: ? Compensated Uncompensated Irreversible An initial insult triggers shock, thus disrupting blood flow to end organs leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. The body's compensatory mechanism is initiated to maintain perfusion to vital organs. If treatment is not introduced during this period, decompensated shock develops causing tissue damage that leads to multisystem organ dysfunction and death. Compensatory shock In the early phases of shock, multiple compensatory physiologic mechanisms act to maintain blood pressure and preserve tissue perfusion. - Blood pressure remains normal, initially, because of peripheral vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance. - Thus hypotension occurs late and is more a characteristic of uncompensated stage of shock. - Patients in compensated shock have relatively normal cardiac output and normal blood pressures but they have alteration in microcirculation that increase flow to some organs and reduce flow to other. - In infants compensatory increases in cardiac output are achieved primarily by \"tachycardia\" rather than by increase in stroke volume. - Hea rates of 190-210/min are common in infants with compensated shock. - On the other hand in older patients cardiac contractility (stroke volume) and (hea rate) increase to improve cardiac output.",

        "exp": "PR bleed, vomiting, mass in right lumbar region, colicky pain and masked liver dullness in a 9-month infant suggest the diagnosis of intussusception.\nPatient is also having shock, so she requires treatment of shock and intussusception.\n\nDiagnosis of intussusception \n\nThe clinical history and physical findings are usually sufficiently typical for diagnosis. Plain abdominal radiographs may show a density in the area of the intussusception. A barium enema shows a filling defect or cupping in the head of barium where its advance is obstructed by the intussusceptum. A central linear column of barium may be visible in the compressed lumen of the intussusceptum, and a thin rim of barium may be seen traped around the invaginating intestine in the folds of mucosa within the intussuscipiens (coiled-spring sign), especially after evacuation.\nRetrogression of the intussusceptum under the pressure of the enema and gaseous distention of the small intestine from obstruction are also useful radiographic signs.\nIleoileal intussusuception is usually not demonstrable by barium enema but is suspected because of gaseous disten\u00adtion of the intestine above the lesion. The use of \"air\" enemas in the diagnosis and treatment of intussusception has supplanted hydrostatic reduction. Reflux of air into the terminal ileum and the disappearance of the mass at the ileocecal valve document successful reduction. Air reduction is associated with fewer complications and lower radia\u00adtion exposure than traditional hydrostatic techniques.\nUltrasonography is a sensitive diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of intussusception.\n\nTreatment of Intussusception \n\nThe child should be first stabilized. A tube should be passed into the stomach through nose (nasogastric tube). An intravenous line should be placed and fluids should be given to prevent dehydration.\nReduction of an acute intussusception is an emergency procedure and performed immediately after diagnosis in preparation for possible surgery. The reduction can be achieved by installation of barium, saline or air.\n\n\"In patients with prolonged intussusception with signs of shock, peritoneal irritation, intestinal perforation or pneumatosis intestinal, reduction (with barium, saline or air) should not be attempted\".\n\nIn the above cases and in cases where reduction by barium/saline/air fails, surgery is required, i.e., manual operative reduction.\nIf the manual operative reduction is not possible or the bowel is not viable, resection of the intussusception is necessary, with an end to end anastomosis.\nTreatment of shock (e.g. O2 IV fluid etc) should be given first if it is present.\n\nAbout option a & b\n\nAs the patient is in shock, reduction by air or barium is contraindicated. However, a barium enema can be used as a diagnostic modality.",

Large pseudomembranes are associated with severe disease and a poor prognosisQ. A few patients develop swelling of the tonsils and present with \"bull-neck\" diphtheria, which results from massive edema of the submandibular and paratracheal region and is fuher characterized by foul breath, thick speech, and stridorous breathingQ Unlike the exudative lesion associated with streptococcal pharyngitis, the pseudomembrane in diphtheria is tightly adherent to the underlying tissues Diagnosis: Attempts to dislodge the membrane may cause bleeding.

This prostaglandin has a vasodilatory effect which keeps the ductus open.\nThe synthesis of these vasodilator is inhibited at birth by the inhibition of the enzyme cycloxygenase at birth.\nCycloxygenase is an important enzyme in the synthetic pathway of prostaglandin.\nIn many premature infants the ductus fail to close spontaneously. In these cases the closure can be produced by infusion of drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase.\nIndomethacin is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase. \nIndomethacin is routinely used to close the PI A in premature infants, it does not close the P I.A of full term\u00a0 infants or children. The success of indomethacin therapy is as high as 80-90% in premature infants with birth\u00a0 weight over 1200 g. \nIf indomethacin is not successful and the ductus remains hemodynamically significant, surgical ligation should be performed without hesitation.\nRecent studies from Europe indicate that ibuprofen may be as effective as indomethacin for the medical closure of pretenn PDA.",
