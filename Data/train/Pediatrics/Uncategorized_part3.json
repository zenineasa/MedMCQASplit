        "exp": "Ans. is `d' i. e., Bronchiolitis obliterans Bronchiolitis obliterans o Bronchiolitis obliterans. is a rare chronic lung disease of the bronchioles and smaller airways. o Bronchiolitis obliterans most commonly occurs inpediatric population after respiratory infections (i. e. adenovirus, mycoplasma, measles, influenza, peussis). o Other causes include connective tissue disease (i. e. juvenile rheumatoid ahritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, scleroderma) o Bronchiolitis occurs in all age groups. Pathogenesis o After the initial insult, inflammation affecting terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts may result in obliteration of the airway lumen. o Epithelial damage resulting in abnormal repair is characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans. Complete or paial obstruction of the airway lumen may result in air trapping or atelactasis. Clinical manifestations Cough, fever, cyanosis and respiratory distress followed by initial improvement may be the initial signs of bronchiolitis obliterans. o Progression of the disease may ensue with increasing dyspnoea, cough, sputum production and wheezing. o Chest radiographs may be relatively normal compared with the extent of physical findings but may demonstrate hyperluscency and patchy infiltrates (occasionally, a swyer James syndrome, i. e. a unilateral hyperluscent lung has developed). o Pulmonary function tests demonstrate varaible findings but typically shows signs of airway obstruction. o Ventilation perfusion scan shows a typical motheaten appearance of multiple matched defects in ventilation and perfusion. o CT scan demonstrates patchy areas of hyperluscency. o Open lung biopsy or transbronchial biopsy remains the best means of establishing the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans. Treatment o No definite therapy exists for bronchiolitis obliterans. o Administration of coicosteroids may be beneficial About other options Follicular bronchitis o It is a lymphoproliferative lung disorder characterized the presence of lymphoid follicles, coursing along the airways (bronchi or bronchioles) o It is rare in children. o Although the cause is unknown, an infectious aetiology has been proposed. o Onset of symptoms generally occurs by 6 weeks of age and peaks between 6 and 18 months. o Cough, moderate fever and fine crackles are common clinical findings. o Fine crackles generally, persist over time and recurrence of symptoms is common. o Chest radiographs may be relatively benign initially but evolve into the typical interstitial pattern. o Pulmonary function tests show restrictive pattern o Chest CT shows fine reticular pattern. Open lung biopsy is used to make definitive diagnosis. Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis o This is a rare disorder. o Although the underlying cause of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is unknown, the disease is characterized by the formation of lamellar concretions of calcium phosphate or \"microlith\", within the alveoli, creating a classic pattern on the radiograph. o Chest radiography typically reveal bilateral infiltrates with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance. o Although the mean age at the time of diagnosis is in the mid 30s the onset of the disease can occur during childhood. When symptomatic, individuals with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis usually complain of dyspnoea on exeion and non productive cough. o Physical examinations of the lungs may reveal fine inspiratory crackles and diminished breath sounds. Clubbing occurs, although this is usually a more advanced sign. o Children are often asymptomatic on initial presentation. Diagnosis o Chest radiography typically reveals b/L infiltrate with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance or \"Sandstorm\" appearance. o CT scan shows diffuse micronodular calcified densities. o Open lung biopsy reveals laminated calcific ioncretions within the alceoli.",

Shock is an acute dramatic syndrome characterized by inadequate circulatory supply of oxygen so that the metabolic demands of vital organs and tissues are not met. Shock has been categorized into series of recognizable stage:? Compensated Uncompensated Irreversible An initial insult triggers shock, thus disrupting blood flow to end organs leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. The body's compensatory mechanism is initiated to maintain perfusion to vital organs. If treatment is not introduced during this period, decompensated shock develops causing tissue damage that leads to multisystem organ dysfunction and death. Compensatory shock In the early phases of shock, multiple compensatory physiologic mechanisms act to maintain blood pressure and preserve tissue perfusion. - Blood pressure remains normal, initially, because of peripheral vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance. - Thus hypotension occurs late and is more a characteristic of uncompensated stage of shock. - Patients in compensated shock have relatively normal cardiac output and normal blood pressures but they have alteration in microcirculation that increase flow to some organs and reduce flow to other. - In infants compensatory increases in cardiac output are achieved primarily by \"tachycardia\" rather than by increase in stroke volume. - Heart rates of 190-210/min are common in infants with compensated shock. - On the other hand in older patients cardiac contractility (stroke volume) and (heart rate) increase to improve cardiac output.",

CNS therapy Most children with leukemia have subclinical CNS involvement at the time of diagnosis.

So, treatment to keep leukemia cells from spreading to the CNS is often started with induction. Treatment include -> Intrathecal methotrexate plus cranial radiation. 3. Intensification If the patient goes into remission, the next step is to intensify the therapy for a short period. Drugs used are -> Methotrexate, L - Asparginase, Epipodophyllotoxin, Cyclophosphamide, Cytarabine 4.

Some people with Prader-Willi syndrome, paicularly those with obesity, also develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (the most common form of diabetes). People with Prader-Willi syndrome typically have mild to moderate intellectual impairment and learning disabilities. o Behavioral problems are common, including temper outbursts, stubbornness, and compulsive behavior such as picking at the skin. Sleep abnormalities can also occur. Additional features of this condition include distinctive facial features such as a narrow forehead, almond-shaped eyes, and a triangular mouth; sho stature; and small hands and feet. Some people with Prader-Willi syndrome have unusually fair skin and light-colored hair. Both affected males and affected females have underdeveloped genitals.

Learning disability is suspected when there is unexpected underachievement in adequate educational settings. The DSM-IV defines three academic skill specific learning disorders. Reading disorder Mathematic disorder Disorder in written expression Another subtyping is language-based LD commonly known as dyslexia (problem in reading, spelling and written expression) and nonverbal LD (deficits in arthmetic and spacial cognition). Dyslexia is the most common type of learning disability. Children with dyslexia have a problem in reading, spelling and written expression. The important clues to dyslexia in school-age children include delayed language, trouble rhymic words, mispronunciation, hesitation, word-finding difficulties and poor spellings with the presence of letter reversal. Reading is slow, inaccurate and laboured.

Patient is also having shock, so she requires treatment of shock and intussusception. Diagnosis of intussusception The clinical history and physical findings are usually sufficiently typical for diagnosis. Plain abdominal radiographs may show a density in the area of the intussusception. A barium enema shows a filling defect or cupping in the head of barium where its advance is obstructed by the intussusceptum. A central linear column of barium may be visible in the compressed lumen of the intussusceptum, and a thin rim of barium may be seen traped around the invaginating intestine in the folds of mucosa within the intussuscipiens (coiled-spring sign), especially after evacuation. Retrogression of the intussusceptum under the pressure of the enema and gaseous distention of the small intestine from obstruction are also useful radiographic signs. Ileoileal intussusuception is usually not demonstrable by barium enema but is suspected because of gaseous disten\u00adtion of the intestine above the lesion. The use of \"air\" enemas in the diagnosis and treatment of intussusception has supplanted hydrostatic reduction. Reflux of air into the terminal ileum and the disappearance of the mass at the ileocecal valve document successful reduction. Air reduction is associated with fewer complications and lower radia\u00adtion exposure than traditional hydrostatic techniques. Ultrasonography is a sensitive diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of intussusception. Treatment of Intussusception The child should be first stabilized. A tube should be passed into the stomach through nose (nasogastric tube). An intravenous line should be placed and fluids should be given to prevent dehydration. Reduction of an acute intussusception is an emergency procedure and performed immediately after diagnosis in preparation for possible surgery. The reduction can be achieved by installation of barium, saline or air. \"In patients with prolonged intussusception with signs of shock, peritoneal irritation, intestinal perforation or pneumatosis intestinal, reduction (with barium, saline or air) should not be attempted\". In the above cases and in cases where reduction by barium/saline/air fails, surgery is required, i. e., manual operative reduction. If the manual operative reduction is not possible or the bowel is not viable, resection of the intussusception is necessary, with an end to end anastomosis. Treatment of shock (e. g. O2 IV fluid etc) should be given first if it is present. About option a & b As the patient is in shock, reduction by air or barium is contraindicated. However, a barium enema can be used as a diagnostic modality.",

        "exp": "Bronchiolitis obliterans Bronchiolitis obliterans. are a rare chronic lung disease of the bronchioles and smaller airways Bronchiolitis obliterans most commonly occurs in a pediatric population after respiratory infections (i. e. adenovirus, mycoplasma, measles, influenza, pertussis). Other causes include connective tissue disease (i. e. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma) Bronchiolitis occurs in all age groups. Pathogenesis After the initial insult, inflammation affecting terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts may result in obliteration of the airway lumen. Epithelial damage resulting in abnormal repair is characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans. Complete or partial obstruction of the airway lumen may result in air trapping or atelectasis. Clinical manifestations A cough, fever, cyanosis and respiratory distress followed by initial improvement may be the initial signs of bronchiolitis obliterans. Progression of the disease may ensue with increasing dyspnoea, cough, sputum production and wheezing. Chest radiographs may be relatively normal compared with the extent of physical findings but may demonstrate hyper lucency and patchy infiltrates (occasionally, a lawyer James syndrome, i. e. a unilateral hyper lucency lung has developed). Pulmonary function tests demonstrate variable findings but typically shows signs of airway obstruction. Ventilation-perfusion scan shows a typical motheaten appearance of multiple matched defects in ventilation and perfusion. CT scan demonstrates patchy areas of hyper lucency. Open lung biopsy or transbronchial biopsy remains the best means of establishing the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans. Treatment No definite therapy exists for bronchiolitis obliterans. Administration of corticosteroids may be beneficial About other options Follicular bronchitis It is a lymphoproliferative lung disorder characterized the presence of lymphoid follicles, coursing along the airways (bronchi or bronchioles) It is rare in children. Although the cause is unknown, an infectious aetiology has been proposed. The onset of symptoms generally occurs by 6 weeks of age and peaks between 6 and 18 months. A cough, moderate fever and fine crackles are common clinical findings. Fine crackles generally, persist over time and recurrence of symptoms is common. Chest radiographs may be relatively benign initially but evolve into the typical interstitial pattern. Pulmonary function tests show a restrictive pattern Chest CT shows a fine reticular pattern. An open lung biopsy is used to make a definitive diagnosis. Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis This is a rare disorder. Although the underlying cause of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is unknown, the disease is characterized by the formation of lamellar concretions of calcium phosphate or \"inicrolith\", within the alveoli, creating a classic pattern on the radiograph. Chest radiography typically reveals bilateral infiltrates with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance. Although the mean age at the time of diagnosis is in the mid-30s the onset of the disease can occur during childhood. When symptomatic, individuals with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis usually complain of dyspnoea on exertion and non-productive cough. Physical examinations of the lungs may reveal fine inspiratory crackles and diminished breath sounds. Clubbing occurs, although this is usually a more advanced sign. Children are often asymptomatic on initial presentation. Diagnosis Chest radiography typically reveals b/L infiltrate with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance or \"Sandstorm\" appearance. CT scan shows diffuse micronodular calcified densities. Open lung biopsy reveals laminated calcific ioncretions within the alveoli.",

        "exp": "Management of PDA After birth ductus arieriosus constricts within a few hours producing functional closure. Permanent anatomic closure follows in the next 10-21 days due to extensive intimal thickening. The mechanism producing the initial constriction is not completely understood, but the increase in arterial 02 tension plays an important role. One more factor which helps in closure of the ductus arteriosus is the decrease in concentration of prostaglandins at the time of birth In the intrauterine period the concentration of prostaglandin PGF2 a is very high. This prostaglandin has a vasodilatory effect which keeps the ductus open. The synthesis of these vasodilator is inhibited at birth by the inhibition of the enzyme cycloxygenase at birth. Cycloxygenase is an important enzyme in the synthetic pathway of prostaglandin. In many premature infants the ductus fail to close spontaneously. In these cases the closure can be produced by infusion of drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase. Indomethacin is a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase. Indomethacin is routinely used to close the PI A in premature infants, it does not close the P I. A of full term infants or children. The success of indomethacin therapy is as high as 80-90% in premature infants with birth weight over 1200 g. If indomethacin is not successful and the ductus remains hemodynamically significant, surgical ligation should be performed without hesitation. Recent studies from Europe indicate that ibuprofen may be as effective as indomethacin for the medical closure of pretenn PDA.",

        "exp": "SURVEILLANCE OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT Surveillance of growth and development is an important component of the routine anticipatory care of children. The main purpose of growth surveillance is to identify those children who are not growing normally. Surveillance for physical growth can be done in the following ways. 1) Weight for age Measurement of weight and rate of gain in weight are the best single parameters for assessing physical growth. The weight should be carefully repeated at intervals: Birth -1 year -> Monthly The second-year -> Every two months 2-5 years -> Every 3 months These measurements when compared with the reference standards of the weight of children of the same age, the trend of growth becomes obvious. Weight for age can be used to classify malnutrition and determine its prevalence. 80 % of the median weight for age of the reference is cut off point below which children should be considered malnourished. 2) Weight for age Height is a stable measurement of growth as opposed to body weight. Whereas weight reflects only the present health status of the child, height indicates the events in the past also. Low height for age: This is also known as nutritional stunting or dwarfing. It reflects past or chronic malnutrition. The cutoff point commonly taken for the diagnosis of stunting is 90 percent of the united states NCHS height for age. 3) Weight for height Weight in relation to height is now considered more important than weight alone. It helps to determine whether a child is within range of normal weight for his height. Low weight for height This is also known as nutritional wasting or emaciation (Acute malnutrition). It is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. A child who is less than 70% of the expected weight for height is classed as severely wasted. 4) Head and chest circumference Chest circumference At birth -> Less than 2 cm from head circumference 6-9 months -> Two measurements become equal > 6-9 months -> Overtakes head circumference In severely malnourished children this overtaking may be delayed by 3 to 4 years.",

P, acute and chronic both are autoimmune disorders in which platelet destruction results from the formation of antiplatelet antibodies. Pathology The principal morphologic lesions of thrombocytopenic purpura are found in the spleen and bone marrow but they are not diagnostic. The point to stress is that despite the increased destruction of platelets in spleen the spleen size remains normal. Bone Marrow Bone marrow reveals a modestly increased number of megakaryocytes. These findings are not specific for autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura but merely reflect accelerated thrombopoiesis, being found in most forms of thrombocytopenia resulting from increased platelet destruction. The importance of bone marrow examination is to rule out thrombocytopenias resulting from bone marrow failure. A decrease in the number of megakaryocytes goes against the diagnosis of I. T. P. Clinical Features Chronic ITP occurs most commonly in adult women, younger than age 40 years. Female to male ratio is 4: 1. The clinical signs and symptoms associated with I. T. P are non-specific for this condition but they are rather reflective of thrombocytopenia. The disease is often insidious in onset and is characterized by bleeding into the skin and mucosal surfaces. Cutaneous bleeding occurs in the form of pinpoint haemorrhages, petechiae or ecchymoses. Often there will be a history of easy bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums and haemorrhages into soft tissues from relatively minor trauma. Sometimes disease may first manifest with melena, hematuria or excessive menstrual flow.

The hallmark of CMV infection on histologic examination is a large cell containing a large basophilic intranuclear \"owl's eye\" and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013).

Treatment o First line treatment for enuresis is behavioral therapy. It consists of rewarding the child for being dry at night, child should void before retiring and the use of conditioning devices (e. g. bed alarm that rings when the child wets a special sheet). o Consistent dry bed training with positive reinforcement has a success rate of 85% and bed and pad alarm systems have a success rate of approximately 75% with relapse rate that are lower than those with pharmacotherapy. o Pharmacotherapy is second line treatment and should be reserved for those patients who have failed behavioural therapy. Imipramine and desmopressin are two impoant drugs useful for enuresis. o Fast action of desmopressin (orally or intranasaly) suggests a role for special occass ons when rapid control of enuresis is required.

        "question": "2 days after bih, child developed respiratory distress and had scaphoid abdomen. Breath sounds were decreased on the left side. After bag and mask ventilation, ET tube was put and the maximal cardiac impulse shifted to the right side. What should be the next step in management?",
        "exp": "Confirm the position of endotracheal tube This is a case of congenital diaphragmatic hernia The clinical features suggesting this are:? - Respiratory distress after bih with decreased air entry on the left side - Scaphoid abdomen - Mediastinal shift A diaphragmatic hernia is defined as a communication between the abdominal and thoracic cavities with or without abdominal content in the thorax. The most common form of congenital diaphragmatic hernia is the posterolateral (Bockdalek) type, which occurs through a defect in the pleuroperitoneal membrane. These hernias are found on the left side in over 80%. Right sided hernias are less common and less severe because the liver prevents the bowel from passing into the thorax. They rarely occur through an anterior defect in the foramen of Morgagni. The stomach, small bowel, colon, spleen and left hepatic lobe may all enter the pleural cavity through a left sided diaphragmatic defect. The most serious defect associated with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia is hypoplasia of the ipsilateral lung. This results from compression of the pulmonary parenchyma by the visceral contents of the hernia and the contralateral displacement of the mediastinum. Postnatally, infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia develop dyspnea and cyanosis which worsens as swallowed air fuher distends the herniated stomach. Respiratory distress manifests as gasping respirations and cyanosis. Infants with respiratory distress within 6 hours of bih are most likely to have severe lung hypoplasia and lower chance of survival. These infants have minimal normal lung tissue and decreased pulmonary reserve, hence their respiratory insufficiency manifests rapidly. Dextrocardia and lack of breath sounds on the left side are strong indications of diaphragmatic hernia. Instead of the normally rounded abdominal appearance, there is often a scaphoid or flattened abdomen because of diminished intraabdominal contents. Management of congenital diaphragmatic hernia Historically the management of hernia focussed on the actual repair of the diaphragmatic hernia but the contemporary management of diaphragmatic hernia places emphasis on the management of pulmonary hypoplasia and persistent pulmonary hypertension. Now the initial management consists of aggressive respiratory suppo. Stabilization of the respiratory system is the first and most impoant goal in the treatment. This is accomplished by immediate postnasal endotracheal intubation and assissted ventilation (But bag and mask ventilation is contraindicated in congential diaphragmatic hernia because it causes gaseous distension of bowel). Conventional mechanical ventilation, high frequency oscillation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are the three main strategies to suppo respiratory failure. These therapies maintain oxygenation. Attempts at lung re-expansion with mechanical ventilation must be gentle since excessive force will overdistend the hypoplastic lung and cause rupture and tension pneumothorax. Nasogastric tube is immediately placed in the stomach to aspirate the swallowed air Surgical repair The ideal time to repair the diaphragmatic defect is under the debate. Most centres will wait at least 48 hr after stabilization and resolution of pulmonary hypertension. Now coming back to the Question Mediastinum shifted to the right after endotracheal intubation. This suggests the possibility of incorrect placement of the tube into the esophagus. - Intubation in esophagus will result in fuher distension of the stomach and bowel loops in the left hemithorax which would consequently shift the mediastinum and apical impulse to the right. The ideal step in this situation would be to remove the tube and do the intubation again. Some says that option 'd' was \"confirmation of the position of endotracheal tube by chest X-ray\". Method for confirmation of position of tube Chest X-ray (PA view) cannot confirm the position of the endotracheal tube because esophagus is situated immediately behind the trachea. X-ray (PA) view cannot distinguish b/w them. CDH is an acute emergency and there is no time for chest X-ray to be done to confirm the position of the endotracheal. If clinical features suggest misplacement of the tube it is better to remove the tube and attempt the intubation again. Confirmation of the position of the endotracheal tube can be done by capnography as it would take no time, because the patient is already in I. C. U. setting.",

This loss of enteric neural coordination leads to functional obstruction and intestinal dilation proximal to the affected segment. Histological findings are? i) Absence of ganglion cells and ganglia in the muscle wall and submucosa of the affected segment. Thickening and hyperophy of nerve trunk. ii) Rectum is always affected with involvement of more proximal colon to variable extent --> most cases involve the rectum and sigmoid only. o Proximal to the aganglionic segment, the colon undergoes progressive dilation and hyperophy. o With time, the proximal innervated colon may become massively distended --> megacolon.",

It develops and is typically diagnosed before 36 mo of age. It is characterized by a behavioral phenotype that includes qualitative impairment in the areas of language development or communication skills, social interactions and reciprocity, and imagination and play. Selective mutism is defined as a failure to speak in specific social situations, despite speaking in other situations; it is typically a symptom of an underlying anxiety disorder. Children with selective mutism can speak normally in ceain settings, such as within their home or when they are alone with their parents, but do not speak in other social settings, such as at school or at other places outside their home. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder of childhood, 1 of the most prevalent chronic health conditions affecting school-aged children. ADHD is characterized by: Inattention, including increased distractibility and difficulty sustaining attention. Poor impulse control and decreased self-inhibitory capacity Motor overactivity and motor restlessness.

Combination of these measurements have been suggested sometimes to distinguish 'type' of malnutrition. For example, water low proposed that weight/height allows one to distinguish between children who have suffered malnutrition in the past front those who are currently experiencing malnutrition. In chronic malnutrition, the child is stunted i. e. his weight for age and height for age are low. Therefore, weight for height cannot diagnose chronic malnutrition as chronic malnutrition affects both weight gain (weight for age) and linear growth (height for age) -> Weight deficit is proportionate to the deficit in height. In acute malnutrition however his height for age is appropriate but he is wasted (low weight for height and age). Thus weight and height measurements together are useful to understand the dynamics of malnutrition, distinguishing between current malnutrition and long-term or chronic malnutrition. Wasting (deficit in weight for height) usually signifies acute onset malnutrition. Stunting (deficit in height for age) usually signifies a chronic course of malnutrition. Wasting and stunting -> Acute on chronic malnutrition. Underweight (low weight for age) -> Combined indicator to reflect both acute and chronic malnutrition",

But in ceain conditions there is opaification of the alveoli due to various reasons. Due to this reason, the bronchus stands out as \"radioluscent\" in contrast to the adjacent alveoli, that are\" radioopaque\" These changes can be due to pneumonic consolidation, collapse of a pa of the lung, or inflammatory edema in the lung tissue.

        "exp": "Age delineation according to AHA guidelines for CPR and ECC Differences in the etiology of cardiac arrest between child and adult victims necessitate some differences in the recommended resuscitation sequence for infant and child victims compared with the sequence used for adult victims. Because there is no single anatomic or physiologic characteristic that distinguishes a \"child\" victim from an \"adult\" victim and no scientific evidence that identifies a precise age to initiate adult rather than child CPR techniques, the ECC scientists made a consensus decision for age delineation that is based largely on practical criteria and ease of teaching. In these 2005 guidelines, the recommendations for newborn CPR apply to newborns in the first hours after birth until the newborn leaves the hospital. Infant CPR guidelines apply to victims less than approximately 1 year of age. Child CPR guidelines for the lay rescuer apply to children about 1 to 8 years of age, and adult guidelines for the lay rescuer apply to victims about 8 years of age and older. To simplify learning for lay rescuers retraining in CPR and AED apropos the 2005 guidelines, the same age divisions for children are used in the 2005 guidelines as in the ECC guidelines 2000. Child CPR guidelines for healthcare providers apply to victims from about 1 year of age to the onset of adolescence or puberty (about 12 to 14 years of age) as defined by the presence of secondary sex characteristics. Hospitals (particularly children's hospitals) or pediatric intensive care units may choose to extend the use of Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) guidelines to pediatric advanced of all ages (generally up to about 16 to 18 years of age) rather than use onset of puberty for the application of ACLS versus PALS guidelines.",

Frequent respiratory tract infection --4 Because pulmonary circulation is overloaded which may result in pulmonary edema, CHF and infection. 2. No cyanosis --> Most of the blood is in pulmonary circulation. So there is no impairment in oxygenation of blood. 3. Precardial buldge --> Frequent chest infections with tachypnea causes the soft rib cage being drawn inward at the diaphragmetic attachments of the ribs. This combined with cardioamegaly gives them a precordial buldge. 4. Hyperkinetic precordium 5. Delayed diastolic murmur in tricuspid or mitral area --> Due to increased flow through these areas depending on the type of CHDs. 6. Cardiomegaly with plethoric pulmonary vasculature on chest X-ray Due to increased flow through pulmonary circulation (plethoric lung) there is increased volume overload to left side of heart ---> Cardiomegaly. B) Obstructive lesions o Obstructive congenital diseases have following features. 1) Absence offrequent chest infection --> Pulmonary circulation is not overloaded. 2) Absence of cyanosis ---> No defect in pulmonary oxygenation and there is no shunt where aerial and venous blood can mix. 3) Absence of precardial buldge There is no chest infection or Cardiomegaly. 4) Heaving (forcible) cardiac impulse --> Obstructive lesions cause concentric hyperophy of ventricles that produce forcible contraction. 5) Systolic thrill due to systolic ejection murmur --4 When hyperophied ventricles forcibly pump the blood through stenotic pulmonary or aoic valve, systolic thrill and systolic ejection murmur are produced. 6). Absence of delayed diastolic murmur in mitral or tricuspid area --> Blood flow through these area is not increased. 7).

Weight (gm) x 100 Ponderal index - _____________________________ Length (cm)3 o A ponderal index below the 10th percentile may be used to identify IUGR infants correctly. o A low neonatal ponderal index is defined as less than 1 SD below a mean 2. 0. o PI is usually less than 2 in assymmetric growth retarded baby and 2 or more in a baby who has either normal growth or has symmetrical growth retardation. o The PI of the baby in question is 2000 x 100 PI -________________________________________________________________________________ -1. 6 (50) o That means the baby is having assymetic IUGR (PI < 2). o Fetal ponderal index can also be calculated by USG examination and compared with neonatal PI.

Blood from left ventricle passes to Aorta and then to innominate, left carotid and left subclavian artery. If constriction (coarctation) is proximal to ductus arteriosus (preductal or infantile coarctation), there is no obstruction to flow because constriction is not obstructing the flow of upper limb and lower limb --> Collaterals are not formed. If the constriction is distal to ductus arteriosus (post ductal or adult type coarctation of aorta), it causes obstruction of flow of desending aorta, and parts of body that are supplied by descending aorta, have impaired circulation -> This stimulates formation of collaterals in fetal life. Hemodynamics after birth After birth, ductus arteriosus closes, so that blood flow to descending aorta from right ventricle does not occur and descending aorta must receive its total supply from left ventricle via ascending aorta. But there is obstruction due to coarctation. In preductal coarctation, there are no collaterals Neonates become symptomatic immediatly --> Hypertension results in CHF.

The rest two third mixes with the venous return from SVC (which carries the blood drained from head, neck and upper limbs) to enter the right ventricles. B) Blood coming out of the heart 1. Right side The right ventricle pumps out the blood into pulmonary trunk very small amount of this blood enters the pulmonary circulation because the lungs are collapsed and pulmonary vascular resistance is high. Most of this blood passes to descending aorta through ductus arteriosus, a shunt between pulmonary trunk and descending Aorta. The descending aorta carries blood to umbilicus through the umbilical artery, for oxygenation. Descending aorta also supplies the blood to lower limbs, kidney and abdominal viscera. 2. Left side The left ventricle pumps blood into the ascending aorta for distribution in the coronary circulation, head and upper limbs.",

Infection is marked by low - grade fever, mild cough, malaise and u - like symptoms. A) Primary pulmonary disease the lung is the portal of entry in > 98% of cases. The primary complex of tuberculosis includes local infection at the portal of entry and regional lymph nodes that drain the area. The combination of the parenchymal pulmonary - lesion and corresponding lymph node is called Ghon complex. Asymptomatic pleural effusion is so frequent in primary - tuberculosis that it is basically a component of the primary complex. Nelson, It may have one of the following course: - Heating by brosis and calcification. Progressive primary > tuberculosis. Cavity Obstructive emphysema If the incomplete obstruction is caused by lymph nodes. Resorption atelectasis If the complete obstruction is caused by lymph nodes. Tubercular bronchitis & bronchiectasis Hematogenous dissemination During early bacteremia seeding may occur at apex Simon's focus. Miliary tuberculosis Collapse consolidation (segmental lesion) A combination of pneumonitis and atelectasis. B) Chronic pulmonary tuberculosis: Infrequent in young children. Children above the age of seven years, especially girls are more vulnerable. The commonest site of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis is the apex of lung Puhl's lesion. Infraclavicular lesion of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis is called Assman's focus. Regional lymph nodes are not involved in chronic pulmonary TB (in contrast to primary TB). Lab investigations of pediatric TB. ESR and blood counts: No value in diagnosis or follow up of TB. Demonstration of AFB. Children don't expectorate out sputum, but swallow it. Therefore sputum is not available for examination. A laryngeal swab may be obtained for smear and culture examination for mycobacteria. It is customer to examine the gastric lavage in children for bacteriological examination on 3 consecutive days, Aspiration of early morning gastric contents (before breakfast) is done with a Ryle's tube and sent for bacteriological examination. Adding vancomycin to the sample improves the yield of mycobacterium. The CSF, Pleural did or bronchial aspirate, urine and discharges from tuberculous sinuses are examined for tubercle bacilli. Histopathology: Material for histopathology may be obtained by biopsy or FNAC. PCR: High sensitivity and specificity for pleural uid and low for gastric aspirate. CXR and CT may show characteristic features. USG may be helpful for the detection of enlarged abdominal lymph nodes, Serology: Elisa or other methods have no utility in pediatric TB.

Under any circumstances, breast milk is the ideal food for the infant -> Human breast milk is the best source of nourishment for human infants. No other food is required by the baby until the age of 6 months after birth. So, exclusive breast feeding should be given to infant for first 6 months of life. Benefits of breast feeding Among the benefits of breast feeding are the following - Superior nutrition Carbohydrates Lactose is in a high concentration in breast milk which helps in the absorption of calcium and enhances the growth of lactobacilli in the intestine. Proteins The protein content of breast milk is low which causes lower solute load on the kidney. Most of the protein is whey proteins (lactalbumin and lactoglobulin), which can be digested easily (In contrast cow milk contains more casein). Breast milk contains the ideal ratio of the amino acids cysteine, taurine and methionine to support the development of the central and peripheral nervous system. Fats Breast milk is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, necessary for the myelination of the nervous system and brain growth. Active lipase in the breast milk promotes digestion of fats and provides FFA. The pattern of fats facilitates the absorption of calcium. Minerals Breast milk protects against neonatal hypocalcemia and tetany due to ideal calcium phosphorus ratio (2: 1) and better calcium absorption. Iron of breast milk is very well absorbed -> breast feeding prevents against iron deficiency anemia. Breast milk also prevents deficiencies of vitamin A, C, D, E and zinc. Breast milk has a water content of 88% and hence a breastfed baby does not require additional water in the first 6 months of life even in summer months. Breast milk has a low mineral and sodium content -> low osmolality presents a low solute load to the kidney. Lower risk of infection The breast milk is clean and uncontaminated with several anti-infective factors -> protect the baby from infection and diarrhoea Protection from allergy (atopy) Low protein contents of breast milk along with a higher concentration of secretory IgA decreases the absorption of protein macromolecules -> less chances of allergy and asthma. Emotional bonding Breast feeding promotes close physical and emotional bonds between the mother and the baby. Others Breast feeding lowers the risk of ovarian and breast cancer in mother. Breastfed babies have a higher IQ and have less chances of developing hypertension, obesity, coronary artery disease and diabetes in their adulthood. The other diseases which are less common in breastfed babies include inflammatory bowel disease, Hodgkin's lymphoma, necrotizing enterocolitis and sudden infant death syndrome.",

Cold stress causes the release of norepinephrine that uncouples beta-oxidation in fat with resultant heat generation. Preterm and small-for-gestational age infants have immature thermogenic response because of scanty brown fat stores. \" Role of Brown Fat in Thermogenesis A newborn baby is more prone to develop hypothermia because of large surface area per unit of body weight. In infants, brown fat is an impoant site of thermogenesis. It results in the so-called non-shivering thermogenesis. Brown fat is located around the adrenal glands, kidney, nape of neck, interscapular and axillary region. Metabolism of brown fat leads to heat production.
