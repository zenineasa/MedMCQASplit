TAPVC Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) is characterized by abnormal drainage of pulmonary veins into the right heart either by direct connection into the right atrium or into its tributaries. According to the site or level of connection of the pulmonary veins to the systemic venous system TAPVC has been classified into four types:-Type I (most common: 45%): Anomalous connection at supracardiac level (PV drains into left innominate vein or SVC). Type II (25%): Anomalous connection at cardiac level (PV joins the coronary sinus or enter right atrium directly). Type III (25%): Anomalous connection at infracardiac level (PV drain into poal vein). Type IV (5%): Anomalous connection at multiple levels.

But for those younger infants who may have compromised respiration or be neurologically less well developed, this may not be advisable and nutrients may need to be passed into the stomach through a fine tube either through the mouth (oro-gastric tube) or the nose (naso-gastric tube). Nasogastric tube increases the airway impedance and work of breathing, therefore, the orogastric tube is preferred over nasogastric tube.

TPN is given to VLBW infants who cannot tolerate gastric tube feeds, have the gastric disease; enteral feeding (by tube) is not possible or just while enteral nutrition is being established. Another important indication for TPN is sick premature/LBW infants which include Infants with: Significant respiratory distress required assisted ventilation. Shock requiring isotropic support. Seizures, renal/cardiac failure Symptomatic hypoglycemia/hypocalcemia, electrolyte abnormalities. The surgical condition of GIT, NEC, hydrops Even in these sick infants, enteral feed should be started as early as possible.",

All monosaccharides are reducing sugars i. e., they all have a free reactive aldehyde group and are positive on Benedicts. Some disaccharides such as fructose have alpha hydroxyl ketones and can reduce sugars. All other disaccharides are non reducing sugars and will not react with Benedict's solution Galactosemia Galactosemia is a group of inherited metabotic disorders in which an enzyme deficiency affects the normal metabolism of the sugar galactose Galactose is a monosaccharide Most of the galactose originates from the dairy products that contain lactose or milk sugar Lactose is a disaccharide that is catalyzed by the enzyme lactase into two monosaccharides i. e. lactose and glucose From the intestine the galactose is transpoed to liver where it is conveed to glucose phosphate, which can be used in several metabolic pathway. Conversion of Galactose to Gulose I phosphate occurs in several successive steps. A specific enzyme is required at each step Galactosemia occurs because of the deficiency of any of the enzymes involved in the metabolism of Galactose. The most common enzyme associated with galactosemia is the deficiency of the enzyme galactose -1- phosphate uridyl trans-ferase. The deficiency of the enzyme or the defect in the metabolism results in an accumulation of galactose -1- PO4 and galacticol that are thought to have direct toxic effect on the liver and other organs. Clinical features Infants with galactosemia appear normal at bih, however symptomsusually appear a few days to weeks after initiating galactose containing. feeds The early clinical features of severe galactosemia include liver dysfunction, manifested by jaundice and hypoglycemia, The accompanying gastrointestinal. findings are poor feeding, vomiting and diarrhoea. Due to the effect of galacticol toxicity on brain it may cause C. N. S symptoms to predominate which are irritability and seizures Diagnosis If galactosemia is suspected, urine should be tested simultaneously with Benedicts reagent and with Glucose oxidase method. - The Glucose oxidase method is specific for glucose, whereas - Benedict's reagent can detect any reducing substance -A negative glucose oxidase test with positive benedicts test suggests that a non glucose reducing substance is present. - With appropriate clinical findings this is most likely to be galactose Confirmatory diagnosis The confirmatory diagnosis is made by the enzyme assay.",

Situs ambiguous or situs indeterminus is generally expressed in two major forms based on the position of spleen and whether the body resembles the normal right side or normal left side of the body. (i) Right isomerism (Asplenia) The spleen is typically absent and hence either side of midline resembles right side. Therefore, it is also called bilateral right sidedness. It is usually associated with severe complex cardiac abnormalities and has poor prognosis. (ii) Left isomerism (Polysplenia) There are multiple small spleens placed on either side of midline, therefore, either side of the midline resembles the left (splenic) side. Thus, it is also called bilateral left sideness. It is associated with less severe cardiac abnormalities and has relatively better prognosis.",

        "exp": "Ans. is `b' i. e., ASD ASD is associated with an enlarged right atrium & right ventricle to accommodate large volume of blood. The left atrium is not enlarged because it decompresses itself by shunting blood to the right atrium at a minor difference in pressure. The left atrium may enlarge once Eisenmenger 's syndrome develops and a reversal of shunt is seen across the defect. All congenital heart diseases given in option cause left to right shunt. Size of left atrium in left to right shunts o In left to right shunt, blood enters from left side of heart (Lt. atrium, Lt ventricle or aoa) to right side of heart (Rt atrium, Rt ventricle or pulmonary aery) depending on the site of abnormal communication. o This blood then flows through pulmonary circulation and again enters the left atrium. o The path of blood is then depending on the defect. o In all these defects, left atrium recieves larger volume of blood which comes through pulmonary circulation --> Blood from right side of heart plus some blood from left side of heart because of shunt enter into pulmonary circulation and then into left atrium. So left atrium recieve blood volume larger than normal. o But the effect of larger volume on left atrium will be different in ASD and other left to right shunts. 1). In ASD Left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, but founate for the left atrium, it also has an extra exit for blood, i. e., septal defect. So, larger volume of blood is decompressed through left atrium. i) Amount, which is normally exits through AV valve (mitral valve) into left ventricle. ii) Extra amount, which left atrium recieves, exits through septal defect into right atrium. 2) Other left to right shunts (VSD, PDA, Aoopulmonary window). In these defects also, left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, But there is no extra exit. So, left atrium can pump out only normal amount of blood through mitral valve, and extra volume remains in the left atrium --> Volume over load --> Left atrial enlargement.",

        "exp": "Bronchiolitis obliterans Bronchiolitis obliterans. is a rare chronic lung disease of the bronchioles and smaller airways Bronchiolitis obliterans most commonly occurs in pediatric population after respiratory infections (i. e. adenovirus, mycoplasma, measles, influenza, pertussis). Other causes include connective tissue disease (i. e. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, scleroderma) Bronchiolitis occurs in all age groups. Pathogenesis After the initial insult, inflammation affecting terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts may result in obliteration of the airway lumen. Epithelial damage resulting in abnormal repair is characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans. Complete or partial obstruction of the airway lumen may result in air trapping or atelactasis. Clinical manifestations Cough, fever, cyanosis and respiratory distress followed by initial improvement may be the initial signs of bronchiolitis obliterans. Progression of the disease may ensue with increasing dyspnoea, cough, sputum production and wheezing. Chest radiographs may be relatively normal compared with the extent of physical findings but may demonstrate hyperluscency and patchy infiltrates (occasionally, a swyer James syndrome, i. e. a unilateral hyperluscent lung has developed). Pulmonary function tests demonstrate varaible findings but typically shows signs of airway obstruction. Ventilation perfusion scan shows a typical motheaten appearance of multiple matched defects in ventilation and perfusion. CT scan demonstrates patchy areas of hyperluscency. Open lung biopsy or transbronchial biopsy remains the best means of establishing the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans. Treatment No definite therapy exists for bionchiolitis obliterans. Administration of corticosteroids may be beneficial About other options Follicular bronchitis It is a lyinphoproliferative lung disorder characterized the presence of lymphoid follicles, coursing along the airways (bronchi or bronchioles) It is rare in children. Although the cause is unknown, an infectious aetiology has been proposed. Onset of symptoms generally occurs by 6 weeks of age and peaks between 6 and 18 months. Cough, moderate fever and fine crackles are common clinical findings. Fine crackles generally, persist over time and recurrence of symptoms is common. Chest radiographs may be relatively benign initially but evolve into the typical interstitial pattern. Pulmonary function tests show restrictive pattern Chest CT shows fine reticular pattern. Open lung biopsy is used to make definitive diagnosis. Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis This is a rare disorder. Although the underlying cause of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is unknown, the disease is characterized by the formation of lamellar concretions of calcium phosphate or \"inicrolith\", within the alveoli, creating a classic pattern on the radiograph. Chest radiography typically reveal bilateral infiltrates with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance. Although the mean age at the time of diagnosis is in the mid 30s the onset of the disease can occur during childhood. When symptomatic, individuals with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis usually complain of dyspnoea on exertion and non productive cough. Physical examinations of the lungs may reveal fine inspiratory crackles and diminished breath sounds. Clubbing occurs, although this is usually a more advanced sign. Children are often asymptomatic on initial presentation. Diagnosis Chest radiography typically reveals b/L infiltrate with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance or \"Sandstorm\" appearance. CT scan shows diffuse micronodular calcified densities. Open lung biopsy reveals laminated calcific ioncretions within the alceoli.",

This diagnosis should be considered in children with persistent cough, wheezing, crackles, or hypoxemia persisting longer than 60 days following a lower respiratory tract infection. Chest radiograph abnormalities include evidence of heterogeneous air trapping and airway wall thickening. Ventilation-perfusion scans show a pattern of ventilation and perfusion mismatch. Pulmonary angiograms reveal decreased vasculature in involved lung, and bronchograms show marked pruning of the bronchial tree. Classic findings on chest high-resolution CT include a mosaic perfusion pattern, vascular attenuation, and central bronchiectasis. Suppoive care including supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia, routine vaccination, avoidance of environmental irritant exposure, exercise, and nutritional suppo should be provided. Ongoing airway damage due to problems such as aspiration should be prevented. Inhaled bronchodilators may reverse airway obstruction if the disease has a reactive component. Coicosteroids (inhaled, daily, or pulse dosing) may help reverse the obstruction or prevent ongoing damage. Ref: Federico M. J., Stillwell P., Deterding R. R., Baker C.

Leucine levels are usually higher than those of other three amino acids. Urine contains high levels of leucine, isoleucine and valine and their respective ketoacids. The keto acids may be detected by adding a few drops 2-4 dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) reagent which produces a yellow precipitate in a positive test. Ferric chloride gives navy blue colour with the patient's urine.",

T. system are involved & produce abnormal visid mucous. The gene is located on the chromosome-7. Most patients with CF present in childhood. Approx 18% of patients present within the first 24 hr of life with Gastrointestinal obstruction, termed Meconium ileus. Other systems dysfunctions are not present at birth, they may manifest within the first year or two of life including respiratory tract system. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of a high sweat chloride (>60 m. Eq/L) on repeated measurements. Pathophysiology of high sweat chloride Cystic fibrosis patients secrete nearly normal volumes of sweat in the sweat acinus. However, CF patients are not able to absorb Na. C1 from sweat as it moves through the sweat duct due to the inability to absorb Cl- across the ductal epithelial cells. This dysfunction in the sweat gland is typically measured by collecting sweat after iontophoresing a cholinergic agonist into the forearm.",

The most common age group is 6 months to 4 years. Most common foreign body aspirated is nuts (peanuts). Most airway foreign bodies lodge in a bronchus (right more than left). Clinical manifestions Three stages of symptoms may results: - Stage I - Initial event -> Violent paroxysm of coughing (a most common symptom), choking, gagging and wheeze immediately after aspiration. If the obstruction is complete, child may be unable to vocalize (aphonia) and there may be cyanosis. If the obstruction is incomplete drooling and stridor may occur. Stage II Asymptomatic -> The foreign body becomes lodged, reflex fatigue and immediate irritating symptoms subside. This stage is most treacherous and account for a large percentage of delayed diagnosis and overlooked foreign bodies.

A) Left to right shunts Patients with a left to right shunts have following features: - Frequent respiratory tract infection -> Because pulmonary circulation is overloaded which may result in pulmonary edema, CHF and infection. No cyanosis -> Most of the blood is in pulmonary circulation. So there is no impairment in oxygenation of blood. Pericardial bulge -4 Frequent chest infections with tachypnea causes the soft rib cage being drawn inward at the diaphragmetic attachments of the ribs. This combined with cardioamegaly gives them a precordial buldge. Hyperkinetic precordium Delayed diastolic murmur in tricuspid or mitral area -> Due to increased flow through these areas depending on the type of CHDs. Cardiomegaly with plethoric pulmonary vasculature on chest X-ray -> Due to increased flow through pulmonary circulation (plethoric lung) there is increased volume overload to left side of heart -> Cardiomegaly. B) Obstructive Lesions Obstructive congenital diseases have following features. Absence offrequent chest infection -> Pulmonary circulation is not overloaded. The absence of cyanosis -> No defect in pulmonary oxygenation and there is no shunt where arterial and venous blood can mix. The absence of precordial buldge -> There is no chest infection or Cardiomegaly. Heaving (forcible) cardiac impulse -> Obstructive lesions cause concentric hypertrophy of ventricles that produce forcible contraction. Systolic thrill due to systolic ejection murmur -> When hypertrophied ventricles forcibly pump the blood through stenotic pulmonary or aortic valve, systolic thrill and systolic ejection murmur are produced. Absence of delayed diastolic murmur in mitral or tricuspid area -> Blood flow through these area is not increased. Presence of delayed corresponding second sound (A2 in AS and P2 in PS) -> Because prolonged flow through these area results in delayed closure of that valve. Normal sized heart and pulmonary vasculature in chest x-ray -> There is concentric hypertrophy, i. e., hypertrophy without dilatation. So, heart size is normal on x-ray.",

The primary defect is the abnormal sensing of the blood calcium by the parathyroid gland and renal tubule. The calcium sensor responds to ECF calcium concentration by suppressing PTH secretion through negative feed back. The mutations lower the capacity of sensors to bind calcium and the mutant receptors functions as though blood calcium levels are low. As a result of the false perception that calcium level are low in the body, the parathyroid gland stas secreting greater amount of parathyroid hormone and renal tubule stas reabsorbing greater amount of calcium in the tubule. o Comparison of hyper parathyroidism and familial hypercalcemic hypocalciuria These two disorders have almost similar features, they differ only in the following aspect 1) Urinary renal calcium reabsorption o FHH --> > 99% of renal calcium reabsorption in the kidney (This causes decrease in urine calcium) o Hyperparathyroidism ---*< 99% of renal calcium reabsorption in the kidney (This causes increase in urine calcium) 2) Age of patient o FIIH --> Hypercalcemia is detected in affected members in first decade of life o Hyper parathyroidism --> Hypercalcemia rarely detected in patient with primary hyperparathyrcidism or MEN syndrome who are less than 20 year of age. 3) Level ofparathvroid hormone o PTH can be elevated in FHH, but the values are usually normal or lower for the same degree of calcium elevation than in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.",

The general perception is that administered drugs remain in the maternal epidural space and do not compromise the respiratory status of the newborn. Contrary to the widely held belief fentanyl diffuses freely from the epidural space into the maternal blood because of its high lipid solubility. Equilibrium is reached within 10-30 min. The drug is freely transpoed across the placenta with a slightly higher concentration in the, fetal compament because of a comparative acidic pH. There is no consensus on the dose of fentanyl causing respiratory depression in the newborn period. However, it appears that neonates are prone to respiratory depression at a lower concentration because of the immaturity of the respiratory centre. According to the Cochrane analysis Morphine, meperidine and fentanyl are the opioids that have been studied the most in labour analgesia research. These opioids as well as newer alternatives, such as nalbuphine have been associated with newborn respiratory depression at bih. - Opioids are known for their high lipid solubility which allows rapid transfer of the drug through the placenta and into the fetus. - The risk of respiratory depression is highest if bih occurs at the time of peak fetal uptake between 1-4 hours after administration of drug to the mother. - Repeated doses of opioids results in significant. fetal exposure and neonatal respiratory depression. Opioids are also used in neonates for pain management - They are the mainstay of pain management in newborn. - In newborns the clearance is diminished and elimination half lives are prolonged as compared to adults because of the immaturity of hepatic cytochrome system of the neonates. - Therefore opioid administration may result in opioid accumulation and respiratory depression.",

Neuroectoderm forms invagination ---> Neural groove. This neural groove separates from overlying surface ectoderm and becomes neural tube.

Neonatal cholestasis can be divided into extrahepatic and intrahepatic disease and clinical features of any form of cholestasis are more or less similar. Neonatal hepatitis is the prototype of intrahepatic cholestasis Biliary atresia is the prototype of extrahepatic biliary atresia Enzymes that reflect cholestasis: There are three enzymes that are usually elevated in cholestasis Alkaline phosphatase -> Found in or near bile canalicular membrane of hepatocytes 5' nucleotidase Gamma glutainyl transpeptidase -> Located in the endoplasmic reticulum and in bile duct epithelial cells. Because GGT is more diffusely localized in the liver, its elevation in serum is less specific than are the elevation of Alkaline phosphatase & 5' nucleotidase. Nevertheless, the following distinction is worthwhile. \"GGT levels are commonly elevated to values more than 10 times normal in biliary atresia while in hepatic causes it is raised to about three times normal. \" Normal values for GGT is about 5-40 IU/L and thus a value of 600 IU/L in the patient in question reflects an elevation of more than ten times the normal value. The patient is thus likely suffering from `biliary atresia'.",

        "exp": "Ans. is `c' i. e., 10th day Circulatory adjustments at bih o These are brought about because of a shift from placental dependance for gas exchange in the fetus to pulmonary gas exchange in neonate. I) Pulmonary circulation Immediatly after bih lungs expand due to first few breaths of neonate. This causes a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance (02 causes pulmonary vasodilatation). This results in increased flow into pulmonary trunk and aeries. The pulmonary aery pressure falls due to lowering of pulmonary vascular resistance. The pressure relations between aoa and pulmonary trunk are reversed so that the blood flow through the ductus aeriosus is reversed --> Instead of blood flowing from the pulmonary aery to aoa, the direction of flow through ductus, is from aoa to pulmonary trunk. Increasing oxygen saturation causes the muscle of ductus to constrict --> In full term neonates the ductus aeriosus closes within 10 to 25 days. 2) System circulation and circulation through heart Loss of placental circulation and clamping of the cord after bih results in increase in systemic vascular resistance. This tends to increase the aoic blood pressure and the left ventricular systolic pressure. The loss of placental circulation results in sudden reduction of flow through ductus venosus which closes off --> Flow through ductus venosus disappears by the 7th day of posnatal life. The loss of placental flow results in a decrease in the volume of blood returning to right atrium --> Right atrial pressure decreases. The left atrial pressure becomes higher than right atrial pressure and the septum primum which ats as a valve of fossa ovalis, approximates with the septum secundum to close off formen ovale. Functional closure of foramen ovale occurs very quickly. Over a period of months, the septum primum and septum secundum become firmly adherent resulting in anatomical closure of the foramen ovale. o After closure of ductus aeriosus, there is establishment of postnatal circulation: - The blood reaching the right atrium through IVC and SVC is emptied into the right ventricle from where it is pumped into pulmonary trunk.
