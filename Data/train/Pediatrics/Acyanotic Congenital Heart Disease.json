        "exp": "Ans. D. (Coarctation of aorta) Stepwise approach toward answer. Acyanotic Heart ds: VSD, PDACyanotic heart ds. TOFIn coarctation of aorta there is late ejection systolic murmui to O. P. Ghai 7th/420. Coarctation of Aorta Harrison 17th/1562. Narrowing or constriction of the lumen of the aorta most common distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery near the insertion of the Hgamentum arteriosum. Indentation of the aorta at the site of coarctation and pre- and poststenotic dilatation (the \"3\" sign) along the left paramediastinal shadow are almost pathognomonic. Murmurs O. P. Ghai 7th/420. Late ejection systolic. Continuous. Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) O. P. Ghai 7th/408-10 - Examination findings. Cyanosis and clubbing. Single second heart sound (S2). Since the pulmonary artery pressure is reduced, P2, is reduced in intensity. The late and soft P2 is generally inaudible in TOF. The S2 is, therefore, single and the audible sound is A2. Slightly prominent \"a\" waves in JVP or normal JVP. Mild parasternal impulse. Normal first heart sound. Ejection systolic murmur in 2nd intercostals space which ends before A2. Remember. TOF is the commonest congenital lesion where squatting is noted. Thorax X-ray reveal Cor-en sabot or boot shapedheart because of the absence of main pulmonary artery segment",
