        "exp": "ANSWER: (C) Less than 2500 g. REF: Nelson essentials of pediatrics, 17th edition. Low birth weight (LBW) infants, defined as infants having birth weights of less than 2500 gt represent a disproportionately large component of the neonatal and infant mortality rates. Although births of LBW infants make up only about 6% to 7% of all births, they account for greater than 70% of neonatal deaths. IUGR is the most common cause of LBW in developing countries, whereas most LBW in infants in developed countries is secondary to prematurity. Very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, weighing less than 1500 g at birth, represent about 1% of all births, but account for 50% of neonatal deaths. Compared with infants weighing 2500 g or more, LBW infants are 40 times more likely to die in the neonatal period; VLBW infants have a 200-fold higher risk of neonatal death. Extremely low birth weight, weighing less than 1000 g at birth.",

There is always the confusion between pre-maturity (less gestation age) and O2 toxicity, as the predisposing factor (Some are also confused with low birth weight). Read these lines from Nelson. They will clear away most of your doubts. \"Retinopathy of prematurity occurs almost exclusively in pre-term infants. \"The risk factor's associated with ROP are not fully known, but prematurity and the associated retinal immaturity at birth represents the major factors. Hyperoxia is also a major factor but other problems, such as respiratory distress, apnea, bradycardia, heart disease, infection, hypoxia, hypercarbia, acidosis, anemia and the need for transfusion are thought by some to be contributory factors\".
