The incidence of Down syndrome in live births is approximately 1 in 750. The occurrence of trisomy 21 as well as other autosomal trisomies increases with advanced maternal age (> 35 yr). In approximately 95% of the cases of Down syndrome there are 3 copies of chromosome 21. The parental origin of the supernumerary chromosome 21 is maternal in 97% of the cases. Approximately 1 % of individuals are mosaics with some cells having 46 chromosomes, while another 4% of individuals have a translocation that involves chromosome 21. The majority of translocations in Down syndrome are fusions at the centromere between chromosomes 13, 14, 15, or 21, known as Robertsonian translocations. The translocations can be de novo or inherited. Down syndrome patients without a visible chromosome abnonnality are the least common.

        "question": "If baby of XX or XY genotype has normal internal gonads but ambiguous external genitalia, it is called as?",
        "exp": "Ans. A. Pseudohermaphrodite. (Ref Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics. 19th ed. chap 582). Persons with intersex states can be classified as a true hermaphrodite, a female pseudohermaphrodite, or a male pseudoher- maphrodite. This is determined by examining the internal and external structures of the child. True hermaphrodites are bom with both ovaries and testicles. They also have mixed male and female external genitals. This condition is extremely rare. In the female pseudohermaphrodite. the genotype is 46, XX, and the gonads are ovaries, but the external genitalia are virilized. In the male pseudohermaphrodite, the genotype is 46, XY, and the external genitalia are undervirilized. Intersex can be divided into four categories:# 46, XX Intersex# 46, XY Intersex# True Gonadal Intersex# Complex or Undetermined Intersex46. XX Intersex. The person has the chromosomes of a woman, the ovaries of a woman, but external (outside) genitals that appear male. This usually is the result of a female fetus having been exposed to excess male hormones before birth. The labia (\"lips\" or folds of skin of the external female genitals) fuse, and the clitoris enlarges to appear like a penis. Usually this person has a normal uterus and Fallopian tubes. This condition is also called 46, XX with virilization. It used to be called female pseudohermaphroditism. There are several possible causes: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (the most common cause). Male hormones (such as testosterone) taken or encountered by the mother during pregnancy. Male hormone-producing tumors in the mother. These are most -often ovarian tumors. Mothers who have children with 46, XX intersex should be checked unless there is another clear cause. Aromatase deficiency. This one may not be noticeable until puberty. Aromatase is an enzyme that normally converts male hormones to female hormones. Too much aromatase activity can lead to excess estrogen (female hormone); too little to 46, XX intersex. At puberty these XX children, who had been raised as girls, may begin to take on male characteristics. 46. XY Intersex. The person has the chromosomes of a man, but the external genitals are incompletely formed, ambiguous, or clearly female. Internally, testes may be normal, malformed, or absent. This condition is also called 46, XY with undervirilization. It used to be called male pseudohermaphroditism. Forming normal male external genitals depends on the appropriate balance between male and female hormones; therefore, it requires the adequate production and function of male hormones. 46, XY intersex has many possible causes:# Problems with the testes and testetosterone production. The testes normally produce male hormones. If the testes do not form properly, it will lead to undervirilization. There are a number of possible causes for this, including XY pure gonadal dysgenesis.# Problems with using testosterone. Some people have normal testes and make adequate amounts of testosterone, but still have 46, XY intersex.# 5-alpha-reductase deficiency. People with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency lack the enzyme needed to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). There are at least five different types of 5-alpha-reductase deficiency. Some of the babies have normal male genitalia, some have normal female genitalia, and many have something in between. Most change to external male genitalia around the time of puberty.# Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). This is the most common cause of 46, XY intersex. Here the hormones are all normal, but the receptors to male hormones don't function properly. There are over 150 different defects that have been identified so far, and each causes a different type of AIS. AIS has also been called testicular feminization. True Gonadal Intersex. Here the person must have both ovarian and testicular tissue. This might be in the same gonad (an ovotestis), or the person might have one ovary and one testis. The person may have XX chromosomes, XY chromosomes, or both. The external genitals may be ambiguous or may appear to be female or male. This condition used to be called true hermaphroditism. In most people with true gonadal intersex, the underlying cause is unknown, although in some animal studies it has been linked to exposure to common agricultural pesticides. Complex or Undetermined Intersex Disorders of Sexual Development. Many chromosome configurations other than simple 46, XX or 46, XY can result in disorders of sex development. These include 45, XO (only one X chromosome), and 47, XXY, 47, XXX -- both cases have an extra sex chromosome, either an X or a Y. These disorders do not result in an intersex condition where there is discrepancy between internal and external genitalia. However, there may be problems with sex hormone levels, overall sexual development, and altered numbers of sex chromosomes.",

Other Options[?]. Testing on Maternal Tissue: For many inborn errors the metabolic defect is generalised and both amniotic and chorion villus cells can be used as a diagnostic tissue[?]. Amniocentesis for evaluation of fetal chromosomal anomalies: A procedure performed usually in the beginning of pregnancy to detect chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. Usually done when a woman is between 16 and 22 weeks pregnant. During this procedure a sample of amniotic fluid is taken from the amniotic sac (amnion) surrounding the unbornbaby and its DNA is examined for genetic abnormalities. The amniotic fluid - has cells that the skin of the developing baby has shed, as well as his/her waste products. Each cell from the baby in the fluid contains their complete set of DNA (genetic information). Analyzing these cells helps the doctors assess the fetus' health and detect any potential problems. The entire amniocentesis appointment lasts approximately 45 minutes- most of which involves a detailed ultrasound examination. Nearly ail chromosome disorders, including Down's Syndrome as well as sex chromosome abnormalities (such as Turner syndrome & Klinefelter syndrome). Several hundred genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. The test is not used to look for all of them, but if your baby is at increased risk for one or more of these disorders, in most cases amniocentesis can usually tell you whether he has the disease.

In adults, the episodes of hypertension are more paroxysmal than in children, where the hypertension is more sustained.

Pheochromocytoma can be associated with tuberous sclerosis, Sturge-Weber syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, and it can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. All of the other answers are possibilities in an adolescent-age child, but the concurrent finding of hypertension suggests an alternative diagnosis. Pregnancy would be unusual because of her age, but the diagnosis must be considered for practically all complaints in an adolescent of childbearing age. Brain tumors or migraine headache would be unlikely to produce the cardiac finding of \"racing heart\" reported in this child. Diabetes can produce a variety of findings, but important clues missing from this case include frequency of urination, weight loss, and other classically seen symptoms.

Galactosemia, fructosemia, tyrosinosis, and glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency represent diseases in which a congenital deficiency of enzyme causes an interruption of a normal metabolic pathway and an accumulation of metabolic precursors that damage vital organs. Galactose (found in milk) and fructose (found in fruit juices) produce urinary-reducing substances in their respective disorders. The mode of inheritance of galactosemia, fructosemia, and most forms of glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency is autosomal recessive. In galactosemia and fructosemia, errors in carbohydrate metabolism cause the accumulation of toxic metabolites when specific dietary sugars are introduced (lactose in galactosemia; fructose and sucrose in fructosemia). Exclusion of the offending carbohydrate from the diet will prevent liver damage. In tyrosinemia type I, or tyrosinosis, the accumulation of tyrosine and its metabolites is associated with severe involvement of the liver, kidney, and CNS. Manifestations of acute liver failure can appear in infancy. A chronic form of the disorder presents as progressive cirrhosis and leads to liver failure or hepatoma. Dietary management does not prevent liver disease. Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency often presents at 3 to 4 months of age with failure to thrive, hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and acidosis. a1-Antitrypsin deficiency causes liver disease through accumulation of an abnormal protein, caused by a single amino acid substitution on chromosome 14. It has a variable presentation, but the following are common in infancy: cholestasis; bleeding into the CNS, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or at the umbilical stump; and elevation of transaminase concentrations.

        "exp": "a. X-linked recessive(Ref: Nelson's 20/e p 595, Ghai 8/e p 640). In a X-linked recessive disease; affected male transmits the disorder to all his daughters (carriers). Sons get their X chromosome from their mother & not from their father. Hence sons of a diseased father are unaffected in X-linked diseases. In an X-linked dominant disorder all the daughters of an affected father would be diseased and not carriers.",
