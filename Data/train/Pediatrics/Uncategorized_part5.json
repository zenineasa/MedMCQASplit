The left atrium is not enlarged because it decompresses itself by shunting blood to the right atrium at a minor difference in pressure. The left atrium may enlarge once Eisenmenger 's syndrome develops and a reversal of shunt is seen across the defect. All congenital hea diseases given in option cause left to right shunt. Size of left atrium in left to right shunts o In left to right shunt, blood enters from left side of hea (Lt. atrium, Lt ventricle or aoa) to right side of hea (Rt atrium, Rt ventricle or pulmonary aery) depending on the site of abnormal communication. o This blood then flows through pulmonary circulation and again enters the left atrium. o The path of blood is then depending on the defect. o In all these defects, left atrium recieves larger volume of blood which comes through pulmonary circulation --> Blood from right side of hea plus some blood from left side of hea because of shunt enter into pulmonary circulation and then into left atrium. So left atrium recieve blood volume larger than normal. o But the effect of larger volume on left atrium will be different in ASD and other left to right shunts. 1)In ASD Left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, but founate for the left atrium, it also has an extra exit for blood, i.e., septal defect. So, larger volume of blood is decompressed through left atrium. i) Amount, which is normally exits through AV valve (mitral valve) into left ventricle. ii) Extra amount, which left atrium recieves, exits through septal defect into right atrium. 2) Other left to right shunts (VSD, PDA, Aoopulmonary window). In these defects also, left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, But there is no extra exit. So, left atrium can pump out only normal amount of blood through mitral valve, and extra volume remains in the left atrium --> Volume over load --> Left atrial enlargement.",

        "exp": "Before comparing the symptoms of PDA & Aortopulmonary window let me discuss the C/F of PDA.\n\nPatent ductus arteriosus is a communication between pulmonary artery and Aorta after fetal life.\n\nPDA results in left to right shunt from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. The flow occurs both during systole and diastole as a pressure gradient is present throughout the cardiac cycle between the 2 great arteries. This flow of blood results in continuous murmur it is usually heard at 2nd left interspace.\nIn patients with large left to right shunt a low pitched mitral mid diastolic murmur is audible at the apex, owing to the increased volume of blood flow across the mitral valve.\nThere are other conditions which can produce systolic and diastolic murmur in the pulmonary area such as Aortopulmonary window defect.\n\n\n\nIn Aortopulmonary window defect there is communication between the ascending aorta and main pulmonary artery. Usually the defect is large therefore the pressure between the two great arteries tends to equalize and flow is established only during systole when left ventricular contraction increases the aortic pressure. So the murmur in Aortopulmonary window defect is systolic with mid diastolic rumble due to increased blood flow through mitral valve.\nSometimes when the Aortopulmonary window defect is small, there is continuous blood flow from Aorta to pulmonary artery resulting in continuous murmur. In this condition symptoms of Aorticopulmonary window defect mimics the symptoms of PDA (Continuous murmur, wide pulse pressure,mid diastolic murmur). It is very difficult to distinguish between the 2 condition.\nChances of spontaneous closure in PDA in term infant is rare (chances of spontaneous closure of PDA is more in preterm infants.)\nIf diagnosis of PDA can be made within the first - two weeks, indomethacin can be given to close the defect. (But since the child is one year old Indomethacin is of no help).\nIn PDA there is increased risk of infective endocarditis.",

        "exp": "Bronchiolitis obliterans is a rare chronic obstructive lung disease characterized by complete obliteration of the small airways following a severe insult. The most common form in children is postinfectious, following a lower airway tract infection with adenovirus, although influenza, rubeola, Bordetella, and Mycoplasma are also implicated. Persons with bronchiolitis obliterans usually experience dyspnea, coughing, and exercise intolerance. This diagnosis should be considered in children with persistent cough, wheezing, crackles, or hypoxemia persisting longer than 60 days following a lower respiratory tract infection. Chest radiograph abnormalities include evidence of heterogeneous air trapping and airway wall thickening.Ventilation-perfusion scans show a pattern of ventilation and perfusion mismatch. Pulmonary angiograms reveal decreased vasculature in involved lung, and bronchograms show marked pruning of the bronchial tree. Classic findings on chest high-resolution CT include a mosaic perfusion pattern, vascular attenuation, and central bronchiectasis. Suppoive care including supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia, routine vaccination, avoidance of environmental irritant exposure, exercise, and nutritional suppo should be provided. Ongoing airway damage due to problems such as aspiration should be prevented. Inhaled bronchodilators may reverse airway obstruction if the disease has a reactive component. Coicosteroids (inhaled, daily, or pulse dosing) may help reverse the obstruction or prevent ongoing damage.

Leucine levels are usually higher than those of other three amino acids.\nUrine contains high levels of leucine, isoleucine and valine and their respective ketoacids.\nThe keto acids may be detected by adding a few drops 2-4 dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) reagent which produces a yellow precipitate in a positive test.\nFerric chloride gives navy blue colour with the patient's urine.",

Ghai pedia 7thle p. 62 (confirmed by WHO book on malnutrition)] Height is affected only in chronic malnutrition. \"A child can loose weight but not height\". Loss in weight can be seen in both acute and chronic malnutrition. Indicators of malnutrition Indicator Interpretation * Stunting Low height for age Indicator for chronic malnutrition, the result of prolonged food deprivation and/or disease or illness * Wasting Low weight for height Suggests acute malnutrition, the result of more recent food deficit or illness * Under weight Low weight for age Combined indicator to reflect both acute and chronic malnutrition More explanation is needed for weight for height. Weight for height is the ratio of the patients actual weight to ideal weight for the patients height. When acute medical condition results in sho term nutritional deprivement the body weight is depleted out of propoional to the length for height and the weight for height value is low. Conversely chronic malnutrition affects both weight gain and linear growth resulting in a small child with a body weight that is more propoional to length, So weight Jar height cannot diagnose chronic malnutrition. Weight for age If there is acute malnutrition there will be weight loss. Weight loss will occur in chronic malnutrition to. So weight for age decreases in both acute and chronic malnutrition. But it can not distinguish between acute and chronic malnutrition. B.M.I I don't have much information regarding BMI. I am not sure if BM1 is used in children below 12 years.

Muscular dystrophies are a group of inherited myopathic disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting. CPK is the preferred muscle enzyme to measure in the evaluation of myopathies. Damage to muscle causes the CPK to leak from the muscle fiber to the serum. The MM isoenzyme predominates in skeletal muscle, while creatine phosphokinase-myocardial bound (CPK-MB) is the marker for cardiac muscle.

It results from reflex changes in vagal influence on the normal pacemaker and disappears with breath holding, or increase of hea rate. It has no clinical significance. It is common in both the young and the elderly. ASD is found in approximately 6% of children with congenital hea disease who survive beyond the first year of life. After bicuspid aoic valve, it is the most common form of congenital hea disease among adults. ASDs have a female-to-male ratio of approximately 2:1. The mode of transmission is best explained in most instances on a multifactorial basis, in which the risk would be approximately 2.5% for first-degree relatives of a single affected family member In a child with Large ASD the filling of the two ventricles remains constant throughout the respiration cycle. Hence sinus arrhythmia is absent or slight and this therefore is a sign of ASD. Ref: rown D.W., Fulton D.R. (2011). Chapter 83. Congenital Hea Disease in Children and Adolescents. In V. Fuster, R.A.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., Hypoplastic left hea syndrome o Amongst the given options, hypoplastic left hea syndrome causes CHF in First week. o Different congenital diseases have different time of onset of CHF : - 1)Left to right shunt o At bih, pulmonary vascular resistance is high, i.e., the pressure on side of circulation is high --> Pulmonary pressure is almost equal to systemic pressure. So, left to right shunt is small, whether the communication is atrial, ventricular or pulmonary aery level. As the neonate grows, pulmonary vascular resistance falls with maximum fall at the age of six to eight weeks (Note - In normal neonate, maximum fall is between 1 to 3 weeks). o This is the time (six to eight weeks) when the size of shunt is maximum as pulmonary vascular resistance is least at this time. So, patients with left to right shunts tend to develop CCF around six to eight weeks of life. 2)Right to left shunt Patients with right to left shunt may have : ? a) Shunt at the ventricular or pulmonary aery level. b)Shunt at atrial level o Patients with shunt at the ventricular or pulmonary aery level do not develop CCF because the right ventricle is dompressed by the shunt. o Patients with shunt at atrial level may have. i) Obstruction at right ventricular outlet (Pulmonary stenosis or atresia) --> CCF develops in the first few days of life as ventricle does not decompress fully because shunt is at atrial level. ii) Obstruction at right ventricular inlet (Tricuspid atresia) CCF usually does not occur as there is no volume overload to right ventricle. But these patients develop congestive symptoms when the shunt is small. 3) Obstructive lesions o If the stenosis is critical (e.g., in aoic or pulmonary atresia), CCF may develop early because of impaired ventricular decompression. o Coarctation of aoa may develop CCF with in 1-4 weeks of life. However, if these patients do not manifest CCF in the first year of life, collaterals develop and prevent onset of failure by decompressing the obstruction. 4) Transposition o Patients with transposition of great aeries, develop CCF within first week of life, when there is no ventricular communication and the only mixing site is at the atrial level --> Hypoxemia along with anoxic myocardium results in tachycardia that causes CCF. o Patients with transposition of great aeries with an adequate ventricular defect and patients with transposition of pulmonary veins develop CCF somewhat later, usually by the age of six to eight weeks, following the fall in pulmonary vascular resistance as in patient with left to right shunt.",

        "exp": "This is impetigo, which is typically seen in preschool children with poor hygiene, paicularly in the summer in warm climates. The characteristic lesion has a large golden crust. Most cases are caused by Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus pyogenes is occasionally implicated. Impetigo is highly infectious, and mini-epidemics can occur in daycare settings. The initial treatment is typically with penicillins and topical preparations. Methicillin-resistant strains are presently rare in this setting, but can occur. Aphthous ulcers commonly known as \"canker sores,\" are painful, shallow ulcers of the oral cavity. Erysipelas is a different type of skin infection, often caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (also sometimes others including Staphylococcus), and is characterized by large erythematous patches. Herpes simplex I causes tiny oral and perioral vesicles, but not large golden crusts. Ref: Morelli J.G., Prok L.D. (2012). Chapter 15. Skin. In W.W. Hay, Jr., M.J. Levin, R.R. Deterding, J.J.

The primary defect is the abnormal sensing of the blood calcium by the parathyroid gland and renal tubule. The calcium sensor responds to ECF calcium concentration by suppressing PTH secretion through negative feed back. The mutations lower the capacity of sensors to bind calcium and the mutant receptors functions as though blood calcium levels are low. As a result of the false perception that calcium level are low in the body, the parathyroid gland stas secreting greater amount of parathyroid hormone and renal tubule stas reabsorbing greater amount of calcium in the tubule. o Comparison of hyper parathyroidism and familial hypercalcemic hypocalciuria These two disorders have almost similar features, they differ only in the following aspect 1) Urinary renal calcium reabsorption o FHH --> > 99% of renal calcium reabsorption in the kidney (This causes decrease in urine calcium) o Hyperparathyroidism ---*< 99% of renal calcium reabsorption in the kidney (This causes increase in urine calcium) 2) Age of patient o FIIH --> Hypercalcemia is detected in affected members in first decade of life o Hyper parathyroidism --> Hypercalcemia rarely detected in patient with primary hyperparathyrcidism or MEN syndrome who are less than 20 year of age. 3) Level ofparathvroid hormone o PTH can be elevated in FHH, but the values are usually normal or lower for the same degree of calcium elevation than in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.",

The purpose of this receptor is binding of the granulocyte to the cytokine (GCSF) in order to give signal to the cell to mature and multiply. Patients with Kostamann's syndrome produce GCSF but because of the defet in GCSF receptor the response of neutrophils to normal amounts of GCSF in the blood is reduced.

        "question": "Acute malnutrition in a child is clinically assessed by: September 2005",
        "exp": "Ans. D: Weight for height An indicator known as weight-for-height is used to determine whether a child is acutely malnourished or not. The child's weight is compared to the 'normal' weight for that height. Based on this information, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has developed chas known as international standards for expected growth. If a child's weight falls within the range considered normal for his/her height, the child is found to be well-nourished. If the weight is less than the international standards, the child is considered acutely malnourished or wasted. WHO has created cut-off points to indicate the severity of the malnutrition. If a child's weight-for-height is less than -2 z-scores (or standard detions) of normal children, s/he is considered to suffer from moderate acute malnutrition or wasting. If the child's weight-for-height is less than -3 z-scores (standard detions) of normal children s/he suffers from severe acute malnutrition and is considered to be severely wasted. Another measurement used to determine a child's nutritional status is the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measurement. Because MUAC measurements require a simple, colour-coded measuring band rather than weighing scales and height boards, they are often used during crisis situations. Useful for children between six months and five years of age, a MUAC measurement of less than 12.5 cm indicates that a child is suffering from moderate acute malnutrition. If the MUAC measurement is under 11.0 cm, however, the under-five child's life may be in danger as he or she is suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Although no anthropometric measure is a perfect marker of acute malnutrition, in the past, there has been a tendency to view W/H measures as the gold-standard anthropometric measure to diagnose acute malnutrition in emergencies. Discrepancies between MUAC and W/H have therefore been explained by MUAC being a poor indicator of nutritional status. A third way of diagnosing acute malnutrition is by testing for the presence of oedema. Oedema affects a child's appearance, giving him or her a puffy, swollen look in either lower limbs and feet or face. It can be detected by small pits or indentations remaining in the child's lower ankles or feet, after pressing lightly with the thumbs. The presence of oedema in both feet and lower legs is always considered a sign of severe acute malnutrition.",

Positioning\n\nThe neonate should be placed on her back or side with the neck slightly extended.\nThis can be achieved by putting a rolled blanket or towel under the shoulders, elevating them 3/4 or 1 inch off the mattress.\n\n2. Suctioning\n\nThe mouth and nose should' be suctioned\nThe mouth is suctioned first to ensure that there is nothing for the infant to aspirate when the nose is suctioned.\nOne should not insert the catheter very deep in mouth or nose for suction ---> Stimulation of posterior\n\npharynx during the first few minutes after birth can produce a vagal responce, causing severe bradycardia or apnea.\n3.Dry, stimulate and reposition\na After suctioning, the baby should be dried by using pre-warmed linen to prevent heat loss.\n\nA brief tactile stimulation in the form of flicking the soles or rubbing the back may be provided in case of non-establishment of ood res irator efforts.\n\n4. Free flow of oxygen\n\nIf the baby continues to be depressed, provide free flow of oxygen using a facemask.\nAfter providing initial steps, the baby should be evaluated for three signs -\n\n\nRespiration\nHeart rate (HR)\nColor\n\n\nIf baby has good breathing, HR >100 and pink color, he should be given supportive care.\nIf the baby is not breathing well or HR <100 then bag and mask ventilation is needed.\nAfter the infant has received 30 seconds of ventilation with 100% oxygen by bag and mask, evaluation of heart rate should be done -\n\nHR>100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 --->\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Discontinue ventilation if spontaneous respiration is present\nHR 60 to 100 -->\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Continue ventilation\nBelow 60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -->\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Continue ventilation + chest compressions\n\nAfter 30 seconds of chest compressions, the heart rate is checked.\n\nBR< 60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -p\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Continue chest compression and bag & mask ventilation + initiate medications.\nBR > 60 Discontinue chest compression but continue bag & mask ventilation until the heart rate is above 100.",

The general perception is that administered drugs remain in the maternal epidural space and do not compromise the respiratory status of the newborn. Contrary to the widely held belief fentanyl diffuses freely from the epidural space into the maternal blood because of its high lipid solubility. Equilibrium is reached within 10-30 min. The drug is freely transpoed across the placenta with a slightly higher concentration in the, fetal compament because of a comparative acidic pH. There is no consensus on the dose of fentanyl causing respiratory depression in the newborn period. However, it appears that neonates are prone to respiratory depression at a lower concentration because of the immaturity of the respiratory centre. According to the Cochrane analysis Morphine, meperidine and fentanyl are the opioids that have been studied the most in labour analgesia research. These opioids as well as newer alternatives, such as nalbuphine have been associated with newborn respiratory depression at bih. - Opioids are known for their high lipid solubility which allows rapid transfer of the drug through the placenta and into the fetus. - The risk of respiratory depression is highest if bih occurs at the time of peak fetal uptake between 1-4 hours after administration of drug to the mother. - Repeated doses of opioids results in significant .fetal exposure and neonatal respiratory depression. Opioids are also used in neonates for pain management - They are the mainstay of pain management in newborn. - In newborns the clearance is diminished and elimination half lives are prolonged as compared to adults because of the immaturity of hepatic cytochrome system of the neonates. - Therefore opioid administration may result in opioid accumulation and respiratory depression.",
