The primary defect is the abnormal sensing of the blood calcium by the parathyroid gland and renal tubule. The calcium sensor responds to ECF calcium concentration by suppressing PTH secretion through negative feed back. The mutations lower the capacity of sensors to bind calcium and the mutant receptors functions as though blood calcium levels are low. As a result of the false perception that calcium level are low in the body, the parathyroid gland stas secreting greater amount of parathyroid hormone and renal tubule stas reabsorbing greater amount of calcium in the tubule. o Comparison of hyper parathyroidism and familial hypercalcemic hypocalciuria These two disorders have almost similar features, they differ only in the following aspect 1) Urinary renal calcium reabsorption o FHH --> > 99% of renal calcium reabsorption in the kidney (This causes decrease in urine calcium) o Hyperparathyroidism ---*< 99% of renal calcium reabsorption in the kidney (This causes increase in urine calcium) 2) Age of patient o FIIH --> Hypercalcemia is detected in affected members in first decade of life o Hyper parathyroidism --> Hypercalcemia rarely detected in patient with primary hyperparathyrcidism or MEN syndrome who are less than 20 year of age. 3) Level ofparathvroid hormone o PTH can be elevated in FHH, but the values are usually normal or lower for the same degree of calcium elevation than in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.",

The purpose of this receptor is binding of the granulocyte to the cytokine (GCSF) in order to give signal to the cell to mature and multiply.

        "question": "Acute malnutrition in a child is clinically assessed by: September 2005",
        "exp": "Ans. D: Weight for height An indicator known as weight-for-height is used to determine whether a child is acutely malnourished or not. The child's weight is compared to the 'normal' weight for that height. Based on this information, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has developed chas known as international standards for expected growth. If a child's weight falls within the range considered normal for his/her height, the child is found to be well-nourished. If the weight is less than the international standards, the child is considered acutely malnourished or wasted. WHO has created cut-off points to indicate the severity of the malnutrition. If a child's weight-for-height is less than -2 z-scores (or standard detions) of normal children, s/he is considered to suffer from moderate acute malnutrition or wasting. If the child's weight-for-height is less than -3 z-scores (standard detions) of normal children s/he suffers from severe acute malnutrition and is considered to be severely wasted. Another measurement used to determine a child's nutritional status is the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measurement. Because MUAC measurements require a simple, colour-coded measuring band rather than weighing scales and height boards, they are often used during crisis situations. Useful for children between six months and five years of age, a MUAC measurement of less than 12. 5 cm indicates that a child is suffering from moderate acute malnutrition. If the MUAC measurement is under 11. 0 cm, however, the under-five child's life may be in danger as he or she is suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Although no anthropometric measure is a perfect marker of acute malnutrition, in the past, there has been a tendency to view W/H measures as the gold-standard anthropometric measure to diagnose acute malnutrition in emergencies. Discrepancies between MUAC and W/H have therefore been explained by MUAC being a poor indicator of nutritional status. A third way of diagnosing acute malnutrition is by testing for the presence of oedema. Oedema affects a child's appearance, giving him or her a puffy, swollen look in either lower limbs and feet or face. It can be detected by small pits or indentations remaining in the child's lower ankles or feet, after pressing lightly with the thumbs. The presence of oedema in both feet and lower legs is always considered a sign of severe acute malnutrition.",

Pink color (look at tougue and lips) Term gestation (delivery between 37-42 weeks of pregnancy). If all signs are positive no active resuscitation is required. If any of the 5 signs is absent, baby requires resuscitation. The baby should be placed under the heat source (radiant warmer) and subjected to a set of intervention known as initial steps. Initial steps of resuscitation 1. Positioning The neonate should be placed on her back or side with the neck slightly extended. This can be achieved by putting a rolled blanket or towel under the shoulders, elevating them 3/4 or 1 inch off the mattress. 2. Suctioning The mouth and nose should' be suctioned The mouth is suctioned first to ensure that there is nothing for the infant to aspirate when the nose is suctioned. One should not insert the catheter very deep in mouth or nose for suction ---> Stimulation of posterior pharynx during the first few minutes after birth can produce a vagal responce, causing severe bradycardia or apnea. 3. Dry, stimulate and reposition a After suctioning, the baby should be dried by using pre-warmed linen to prevent heat loss. A brief tactile stimulation in the form of flicking the soles or rubbing the back may be provided in case of non-establishment of ood res irator efforts. 4. Free flow of oxygen If the baby continues to be depressed, provide free flow of oxygen using a facemask. After providing initial steps, the baby should be evaluated for three signs - Respiration Heart rate (HR) Color If baby has good breathing, HR >100 and pink color, he should be given supportive care. If the baby is not breathing well or HR <100 then bag and mask ventilation is needed. After the infant has received 30 seconds of ventilation with 100% oxygen by bag and mask, evaluation of heart rate should be done - HR>100 ---> Discontinue ventilation if spontaneous respiration is present HR 60 to 100 --> Continue ventilation Below 60 --> Continue ventilation + chest compressions After 30 seconds of chest compressions, the heart rate is checked.

The general perception is that administered drugs remain in the maternal epidural space and do not compromise the respiratory status of the newborn. Contrary to the widely held belief fentanyl diffuses freely from the epidural space into the maternal blood because of its high lipid solubility. Equilibrium is reached within 10-30 min. The drug is freely transpoed across the placenta with a slightly higher concentration in the, fetal compament because of a comparative acidic pH. There is no consensus on the dose of fentanyl causing respiratory depression in the newborn period. However, it appears that neonates are prone to respiratory depression at a lower concentration because of the immaturity of the respiratory centre. According to the Cochrane analysis Morphine, meperidine and fentanyl are the opioids that have been studied the most in labour analgesia research. These opioids as well as newer alternatives, such as nalbuphine have been associated with newborn respiratory depression at bih. - Opioids are known for their high lipid solubility which allows rapid transfer of the drug through the placenta and into the fetus. - The risk of respiratory depression is highest if bih occurs at the time of peak fetal uptake between 1-4 hours after administration of drug to the mother. - Repeated doses of opioids results in significant. fetal exposure and neonatal respiratory depression. Opioids are also used in neonates for pain management - They are the mainstay of pain management in newborn. - In newborns the clearance is diminished and elimination half lives are prolonged as compared to adults because of the immaturity of hepatic cytochrome system of the neonates. - Therefore opioid administration may result in opioid accumulation and respiratory depression.",

It results from failure of neural tube to close spontaneously between the 3rd and 4th week of in utero development. Lumbo-sacrol region is the most common site Etiology NTDs have multiple etiological factors - Maternal diabetes Zinc and folate deficiency Maternal exposure to alcohol, radiation, valproate, carbamazepine Trisomy 13 and 15 Maternal malnutrition is an important risk factor for development of NTD. There is decreased maternal folate levels in NTD affected pregnancies --> Periconceptional folic acid supplementation decreases the occurrence of NTD Pathogenesis The human nervous system develops from neuroectoderm. During development, behind neuroectoderm lies the mesoderm that encloses the notochord which is derived from endoderm. Vertebral bodies develop from the mesoderm around the notochord. Neuroectoderm forms invagination ---> Neural groove. This neural groove separates from overlying surface ectoderm and becomes neural tube. From developing vertebral bodies, two dorsal projection extends, which grow around the neural tube and form vertebral arch (pedicle and lamina). Failure of these vertebral arches to fuse give rise to Neural tube defect.",

But this method is not helpful in case of neonates because all neonates born to HIV infected mothers will have IgG antibody in their blood, regardless of infection status in them. These antibodies are passively transferred to the newborns from their mothers (IgG can cross placenta). These infants continue to test positive for IgG antibodies for upto 18 months. At the end of 18 month they will lose these antibodies so uptil 18 month of age this method of diagnosis cannot be used. The presence of IgA or IgM anti HIV in the infant's blood can indicate HIV infection, because these classes of antibodies do not cross the placenta. However detectable quantities of IgA antibodies are detected only after 3 months of life and detection of IgM antibodies is very unreliable (both insensitive and nonspecific). So direct viral detection assays are used for the diagnoses of HIV in newborn. These are detection of HIV DNA or RNA by PCR. HIV culture HIV p24 antigen Immune complex dissociated p24 antigen These are very useful in young infants allowing a definitive diagnosis in most infected infants by 1- 6 months of age.

Neonatal hepatitis is the prototype of intrahepatic cholestasis Biliary atresia is the prototype of extrahepatic biliary atresia Enzymes that reflect cholestasis: There are three enzymes that are usually elevated in cholestasis Alkaline phosphatase -> Found in or near bile canalicular membrane of hepatocytes 5' nucleotidase Gamma glutainyl transpeptidase -> Located in the endoplasmic reticulum and in bile duct epithelial cells. Because GGT is more diffusely localized in the liver, its elevation in serum is less specific than are the elevation of Alkaline phosphatase & 5' nucleotidase. Nevertheless, the following distinction is worthwhile. \"GGT levels are commonly elevated to values more than 10 times normal in biliary atresia while in hepatic causes it is raised to about three times normal. \" Normal values for GGT is about 5-40 IU/L and thus a value of 600 IU/L in the patient in question reflects an elevation of more than ten times the normal value.

        "exp": "Ans. is `c' i. e., 10th day Circulatory adjustments at bih o These are brought about because of a shift from placental dependance for gas exchange in the fetus to pulmonary gas exchange in neonate. I) Pulmonary circulation Immediatly after bih lungs expand due to first few breaths of neonate. This causes a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance (02 causes pulmonary vasodilatation). This results in increased flow into pulmonary trunk and aeries. The pulmonary aery pressure falls due to lowering of pulmonary vascular resistance. The pressure relations between aoa and pulmonary trunk are reversed so that the blood flow through the ductus aeriosus is reversed --> Instead of blood flowing from the pulmonary aery to aoa, the direction of flow through ductus, is from aoa to pulmonary trunk. Increasing oxygen saturation causes the muscle of ductus to constrict --> In full term neonates the ductus aeriosus closes within 10 to 25 days. 2) System circulation and circulation through hea Loss of placental circulation and clamping of the cord after bih results in increase in systemic vascular resistance. This tends to increase the aoic blood pressure and the left ventricular systolic pressure. The loss of placental circulation results in sudden reduction of flow through ductus venosus which closes off --> Flow through ductus venosus disappears by the 7th day of posnatal life. The loss of placental flow results in a decrease in the volume of blood returning to right atrium --> Right atrial pressure decreases. The left atrial pressure becomes higher than right atrial pressure and the septum primum which ats as a valve of fossa ovalis, approximates with the septum secundum to close off formen ovale. Functional closure of foramen ovale occurs very quickly. Over a period of months, the septum primum and septum secundum become firmly adherent resulting in anatomical closure of the foramen ovale. o After closure of ductus aeriosus, there is establishment of postnatal circulation: - The blood reaching the right atrium through IVC and SVC is emptied into the right ventricle from where it is pumped into pulmonary trunk. After coursing through lungs for gas exchange, it reaches the left atrium. and ventricle. The left ventricle pumps it out for distribution in the body for oxygenation of the tissues.

It is highly soluble in water and can be administered very safely IV or IM, without causing injury to tissues Lorazepam The initial drug used to control acute seizure is usually Lorazepam Can be use either as the initial drug or as a 2\"d line treatment in a newborn who does not respond to the treatment with Phenobarbital and Phenytoin. Lorazepam is distributed to brain very quickly and exes its anticonvulsants action in minutes. Diazepam and Midazolam Highly lipophilic, so it distributes very rapidly into the brain and then is cleared very quickly out, carrying the risk of recurrence of seizures Carries the risk of apnea and hypotension However, the IV preparation contains sodium benzoate and benzoic acid, it is currently not recommended as a first line agent.

The anemia of b thalassemia is microcytic and hypochromic with anisocytosis. Amino acid substitutions in b globin lead to hemoglobinopathies, of which sickle cell anemia is the archetype. Homozygotes with these hemoglobin variants do not produce any HbA, but rather mutant types, such as HbS, HbC and HbM. Antibodies against fetal blood cells are generally produced by a mother who has been sensitized to fetal blood antigens by transfusion or a previous pregnancy. Such immune-mediated hemolysis leads to intrauterine anemia and hydrops fetalis.

Heart failure within the first 12 to 18 hours of life is usually a result of malformations that involve pressure or volume overload independent of pulmonary flow, as occurs with severe valvular regurgitation or a systemic aeriovenous fistula. Full-term infants presenting with severe heart failure during the remainder of the first week have critical obstruction to systemic aerial flow. Examples are aoic atresia, coarctation of the aoa, interruption of the aoic arch, and critical aoic stenosis. During the second week of life, aoic atresia and coarctation remain the most common causes of heart failure.

Causes of Vitamin A deficiency include causes of Vitamin A deficiency are inadequate intake, fat malabsorption, or liver disorders The ocular manifestations of vitamin A are collectively called xerophthalmia. It can affect any age group, but its most severe blinding complications affect children aged 6 months to 3 years. The WHO classification of vitamin A deficiency is as follows: XNNight blindness: Night blindness is the earliest clinical symptom X1A Conjunctival xerosis XIB Bitot's spot: Bitot's spots are the buildup of keratin located superficially in the conjunctiva, which are oval, triangular or irregular in shape. X2 Corneal xerosis X3A Corneal ulceration/keratomalacia involving one-third or less of the cornea X3B Corneal ulceration/keratomalacia involving one-half or more of the cornea XS Corneal scar Treatment Oral therapy: The oral regimen of vitamin A is 200, 000 IU on day of presentation, next day, and 2-4 weeks later. Children less than 1 year of age or less than 8 kg should receive half the dose of the above dose. Repeat 200, 000 IU every 6 months up to 6 years of age to prevent recurrence. Parenteral therapy: If the patient has severe disease, is unable to take oral feeds, or has malabsorption, the preferable dose is 100, 000 IU of vitamin A given intramuscularly. Children with severe measles should also receive vitamin A as they are very likely to be benefited from such therapy both in terms of saving sight and reducing case fatality. Prevention Prophylaxis consists of periodic administration of Vitamin A supplements. WHO recommended schedule, which is universally recommended is as follows: Infants 6-12 months old and any older children weighing less than 8 kg - 100, 000 IU orally every 3-6 months Children over 1 year and under 6 years of age - 200, 000 IU orally every 6 months Infants less than 6 months old, who are not being breastfed - 50, 000 IU orally should be given before they attain the age of 6 months",

Severe obstruction -> Pulmonary blood flow is dependent on patency of the ductus arteriosus. When the ductus closes (10-21 days), the neonate experience profound hypoxemia, cyanosis and shock. 2) Cyanotic CBD with increased pulmonary blood flow. This group of lesions is not associated with obstruction to pulmonary blood flow. Cyanosis caused by any of the following mechanisms. Abnormal ventricular-arterial connection (e. g., Transposition of great vessels) -> In this, aorta arises from rt ventricle, So that systemic venous blood returning to the right atrium is pumped directly back to the body, and oxygenated blood returning from lung is pumped back into the lungs.

Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, due to lack of the enzyme gulonolactone oxidase and therefore depend on dietary sources. Vitamin C is not stored in the body, but is taken up by all tissues; the highest levels are found in the pituitary and adrenal glands. This disorder occurs more frequently in children (paicularly infants) than in adults, and for the most pa, results from a diet of pasteurized or boiled milk. (This type of milk is deficient in vitamin C because the vitamin is inactivated by heat). For scurvy to develop, the deficiency must be present for a long time of approx. 4 to 6 months. Therefore it is unlikely that the disorder will be seen before the age of 4-6 months. The occurrence of scurvy in adults is rare, being seen mostly in patients suffering from chronic severe malnutrition. Vitamin C is essential for the hydroxylation of lysine and proline in collagen formation. The defect in collagen synthesis results in inadequate suppo of the walls of capillaries and venules leading to bleeding in the skin and in the gingival mucosa, haemahroses, and subperiosteal hemorrhages. The gums are swollen and bleed easily. Bleeding in the skin causes petechiae, eccyhmoses, perifollicular hemorrhages. Skeletal changes may also develop in infants and children. The pritnaly disturbance is in the formation of osteoid matrix, rather than in mineralization or calcification. (Rickets is characterized by the presence of excess osteoid and lack of calcification; whereas scurvy is associated with deficient osteoid and much calcified cailage). The potential for skeletal lesions diminish with increasing age. The skeletal changes are most pronounced in regions of active endochondral bone growth and therefore are best seen in the distal end of the long bones paicularly of the lower extremity. Changes at the sternal ends of the ribs cause scorbutic rosary formation. Key imaging features of scurvy or Vit. \"C\" Def Osteoporosis White line of Frank!

The decrease in peripheral resistance (vasodilatation) is the hallmark of early (hyper dynamic) stage of septic shock, this feature distinguishes it from other types of shock. Decreased peripheral resistance (vasodilatation) leads to a compensatory increase in cardiac output; therefore, cardiac output is maintained or some time increased despite of shock. Decreased peripheral resistance and increased cardiac output lead to increased blood flow and total oxygen delivery to the tissue. But, still, the tissues lack O2 due to local microcirculatory changes produced as a result of sepsis which causes decrease tissue extraction of oxygen. So, increased blood flow and cardiac out are still inadequate to meet the total metabolic needs of the tissue which are increased in sepsis. As sepsis progresses, hypo dynamic stage supervenes in which there is decreased cardiac output and increased peripheral resistance. So, hemodynamic changes in septic shock occur in two characteristic patterns, Early hyperdynamic and late hypo dynamic shock 1) Early hyperdynamic shock Hypotension is a late feature of septic shock and early hyperdynamic stage is characterized by normal or increased BR Other features are: - Tachycardia Normal or increased cardiac output Tachypnea Warm extremities Decreased systemic vascular resistance Increased pulmonary vascular resistance 2) Late hypo dynamic stage Decreased cardiac output Hypotension Increased vascular resistance Cool, mottled and often cyanotic extremities Oliguria, renal failure Hypothermia",

Decreased peripheral resistance (vasodilatation) leads to compensatory increase in cardiac output; therefore, cardiac output is maintained or some time increased despite of shock. o Decreased peripheral resistance and increased cardiac output leads to increased blood flow and total oxygen delivery to the tissue. But, still the tissues lack 02 due to local microcirculatory changes produced as a result of sepsis which causes decrease tissue extraction of oxygen. So, increased blood flow and cardiac out are still inadequate to meet the total metabolic needs of the tissue which are increased in sepsis. o As sepsis progresses, hypodynamic stage supervenes in which there is decreased cardiac output and increased peripheral resistance. So, hemodynamic changes in septic shock occur in two characteristic patterns, Early hyperdynamic and late hypodynamic shock 1) Early hyperdynamic shock Hypotension is a late feature of septic shock and early hyperdynamic stage is characterized by normal or increased BP Other features are:? o Tachycardia o Warm extremities o Normal or increased cardiac output o Decreased systemic vascular resistance o Tachypnea o Increased pulmonary vascular resistance 2) Late hypodynamic stage o Decreased cardiac output o Cool, mottled and often cyanotic extremities o Hypotension o Oliguria, renal failure o Increased vascular resistance o Hypothermia",

Echocardiographic studies demonstrate volume-overloading of the left ventricle. Cardiac auscultation reveals the presence of a continuous \"machinery\" murmur. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Patent ductus aeriosus (PDA) is a congenital cardiac disorder in which blood traveling in the aoa is shunted through the ductus aeriosus to the pulmonary aeries. On x-ray, the left ventricle and left atrium may be enlarged, and pulmonary hypertension may be observed. PDA is characterized by a continuous \"machinery\" murmur on auscultation. If the ductus is widely patent, pulmonary hypertension may eventually develop, and the initially left-to-right shunt is reversed, sending deoxygenated blood through the descending aoa, and producing cyanosis (Eisenmenger syndrome). Since the deoxygenated blood enters the descending aoa, the toes can be cyanotic, but the fingers are generally not. In atrial septal defect, left-to-right shunting causes volume overloading of the right ventricle, the increased flow across the pulmonic valve producing a mid systolic pulmonary ejection murmur. The second hea sound is widely split. A diastolic murmur may also be heard, reflecting increased flow from the right atrium into the right ventricle. Pulmonic stenosis typically produces a harsh systolic ejection murmur best heard at the upper left sternal border, often preceded by a systolic ejection sound. Tetralogy of Fallot is a form of cyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by ventricular septal defect, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, an overriding aoa, and right ventricular hyperophy. The hea is often described as \"boot-shaped\" on chest x- ray. Ref: Darst J. R., Collins K. K., Miyamoto S. D. (2012). Chapter 20. Cardiovascular Diseases. In W. W. Hay, Jr., M. J. Levin, R. R.

The spleen enlarges because the children are in a state of hypersplenism, in which the spleen vigorously phagocytizes any abnormally shaped erythrocytes. During the first decade of life, sickling within the spleen occludes its blood flow, causing repeated small infarctions, leading to \"autosplenectomy. \" The autosplenectomy is actually helpful to the patient hematologically, as it may ameliorate the chronic anemia. Unfounately, the lack of a functional spleen renders the patients susceptible to infections with Salmonella and encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Patients with sickle cell anemia are not paicularly vulnerable to chronic infection, although acute infections can trigger painful crises. Patients with sickle cell anemia do not have an increased incidence of either Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Ref: Natarajan K., Townes T. M., Kutlar A. (2010). Chapter 48.

Congenital neutropenia is usually very severe and neutrophils are often completely absent in the blood of these patients at the time of diagnosis. These patients usually show arrest of maturation of neutrophils at the promyelocyte stage. - This means that their neutrophils rarely. fully mature into the cells that are capable of fighting infections. - As a result these patients usually suffer from severe infections? - Omphalitis (infection of the navel) - Pneumonia - Skin abscesses - Otitis media during their first few years of life. Pathogenesis Kostmann's syndrome or severe congenital neutropenia is believed to he caused by defect in a gene on chromosome (in p35-p34. 3) that codes for granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF). This disease is believed to be caused due to defect in receptor in granulocyte colony stimulator factor. - This receptor is located on granulocytes or neutrophils. The purpose of this receptor is the binding of the granulocyte to the cytokine (GCSF) in order to give signal to the cell to mature, to multiply, and enhance. function. GCSF is a natural cytokine produced by the human body. - Patients with congenital neutropenia also produce GCSF hut because of the defect in GCSF receptor the response of their neutrophils to the normal amounts of GCSF in the blood is reduced. - These patients will respond to higher dose of GCSF (This is the basis of tit of disease). In some patients the GCSF receptor develops changes that could also indicate progression towards leukemia. Treatment Patients with congenital neutropenia respond to administration of GCSF. - As soon as congenital neutropenia is diagnosed, patients should sta treatment with GCSF. - This treatment usually stabilizes the neutrophil count of the patient. - The response of these patients to GCSF treatment is different. There is a big variation in the dose of GCSF that different people receive. - A small group of patient does not respond to even very high doses of GCSF. In patients who do not respond to GCSF doses of 100 mcg/kg within foueen days, a search for bone marrow donor should be staed immediately and bone marrow transplantation should be performed as soon as matching donor is identified.",

(Panniculitis Inflammation of the subcutaneous, fat) Physical panniculitis Panniculitis that occurs. from physical factors Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn - It is a lobular panniculitis - It occurs in full term or post term healthy infants typically at 1-6 weeks of life or soon thereafter. - The lesion consists of one or small number of finn, nontender, erythematous nodules or plaques on the face buttocks, and or extremities. - The nodules may often break down and discharge oily material. - Over the next. few weeks or month the nodules resolve spontaneously. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is complicated by hypercalcemia - Hypercalcemia is the only significant complication and founately it occurs in minority of patients. - Manifestations of hypercalcemia include irritability. failure to thrive, hypeonia, nausea, vomiting. Pathogenesis is unknown with several hypotheses -The etiology of subcutaneous. fat necrosis is unknown but in some patients., bih trauma, asphyxia, difficult labour or hypothermia have been noted. - Perhaps diffuse tissue hypoxia predisposes to these conditions. Some believe that it occurs because of the differences in the composition of fatty acids. - In contrast to adult. fat, the subcutaneous fat of infants is thought to prone to crystal formation because of a higher content of saturated fatty acid including palmitic acid and stearic acid, and lower content of unsaturated fatty acid such as oleic acid. - The increased saturated to unsaturated fatty acid ratio results in higher melting point for stored fat and promotes crystallization.

Sclerema Neonataram Sclerema neonatarum is much less common than subcutaneous fat necrosis but much serious and life threatening. It affects preteen and term baby. In this entity premature or term babies, develop, rapidly progressive diffuse nonedematous hardening of subcutaneous tissue beginning on the trunk or buttocks and extending to the entire body surface area.
