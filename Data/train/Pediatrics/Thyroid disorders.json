Based on mother's findings, baby is most likely at risk for development of which of the following?",
        "exp": "Neonate is probably at risk for neonatal thyrotoxicosis. Neonatal thyrotoxicosis: Occurs due of maternally acquired thyrotropin receptor-stimulating antibody (TRSAb). Usually disappears within 2 to 4 months as the concentration of TRSAb falls. Unlike TRSAb, TSH does not cross the placenta. All forms of thyrotoxicosis are more common in females, except for neonatal thyrotoxicosis, which has an equal sex distribution. C/F: Tachycardia, tachypnea, irritability, low bih weight with microcephaly, severe vomiting and diarrhoea, thrombocytopenia, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly and heart failure. Eye signs are not commonly seen in children Third-degree heart block is sometimes seen in infants born to mothers with SLE.",
