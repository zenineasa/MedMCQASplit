        "question": "A mother gave bih to a male baby in her home 2 days ago. The mother complaints that she is anxious, unable to tolerate heat and is fatigued most of the time, and repos that she has not gained much weight despite having an increased appetite. She also told that before pregnancy too she had similar complaints. On examination, she has a tremor, her HR is 100 bpm and has bulging eyes. Based on mother's findings, baby is most likely at risk for development of which of the following?",
        "exp": "Neonate is probably at risk for neonatal thyrotoxicosis. Neonatal thyrotoxicosis: Occurs due of maternally acquired thyrotropin receptor-stimulating antibody (TRSAb). Usually disappears within 2 to 4 months as the concentration of TRSAb falls. Unlike TRSAb, TSH does not cross the placenta. All forms of thyrotoxicosis are more common in females, except for neonatal thyrotoxicosis, which has an equal sex distribution. C/F: Tachycardia, tachypnea, irritability, low bih weight with microcephaly, severe vomiting and diarrhoea, thrombocytopenia, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly and heart failure. Eye signs are not commonly seen in children Third-degree heart block is sometimes seen in infants born to mothers with SLE.",
