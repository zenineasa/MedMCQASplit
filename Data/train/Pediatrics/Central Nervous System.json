Presentation Symptoms symmetric flaccid paralysis most affected infants are hypotonic at bih proximal muscle involvement lower extremity greater than upper extremity sparing of upper cranial nerves e. g., normal eye movements Physical exam absent or decreased deep tendon reflexes tongue and finger fasciculatons infants have flaccid \"frog-like\" posture restrictive respiratory insufficiency ALS appears to be increasing in incidence. In 5% to 10% of cases, there is an autosomal dominant pattern with strong age-dependent penetrance. Proposed etiologies include oxidative stress, viral infection, immunologic disease, or some unknown environmental factor. Currently, the oxidative stress theory is ored because a defect in the zinc-copper binding superoxide dismutase (5001) coded on chromosome 21 was discovered. Because SO 01 is an antioxidant that conves the superoxide free radical into peroxide and oxygen, reduced activity causes apoptosis (individual cell necrosis) of spinal motor neurons. Inhibition of glutamate transpo potentiates the toxicity associated with the reduced SODllevels. ALS most commonly presents with both upper motor neuron signs (e. g., spastic paralysis) and, eventually, lower motor neuron signs (e. g., muscle atrophy, fasciculations). Atrophy of the intrinsic muscles of the hand and forearms with hand weakness and spastic changes in the lower legs are early signs. Antioxidant cocktails have now been developed, which offer some symptomatic improvement. Werdnig- Hoffmann disease is a progressive muscular atrophy noted in infants.

        "exp": "Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare form of blood cancer. JMML predominately affects young children, most often developing in children under the age of 4. The male/female ratio of affected children is 2-3: 1. The disorder is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of an immature form of a specific type of white blood cell known as monocytes. These abnormal cells accumulate in the bone marrow crowding out other healthy cells. The bone marrow produces specialized cells (hematopoietic stem cells) that grow and eventually develop into red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. These cells are released into the bloodstream to travel throughout the body and perform specific functions. Red blood cells deliver oxygen to the body; white blood cells help the body to fight infection; and platelets allow the body to form clots to stop bleeding. When abnormal cells accumulate in the bone marrow, they can affect the production and function of these healthy blood cells. JMML cells can accumulate in other organs of the body including the lungs, skin, liver, and intestines. JMML is an aggressive and difficult to treat disease but is currently cured in about 50% of cases. Currently, the only effective treatment for most patients is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The exact, underlying causes of JMML are unknown, but nearly all patients will have a mutation that changes the DNA inside their blood cells in a RAS gene or in a gene that controls the activation levels of Ras proteins. With an incidence of 1 in 3000, NF1 is the most common familial cancer syndrome. Affected persons develop multiple noncancerous (benign) tumors of the nerves and skin (neurofibromas) and areas of decreased or increased coloration of the skin.

This blockade suppresses thalamic excitability, which is thought to be necessary for sustaining the characteristic spike-wave discharge of absence seizures. Serious adverse events linked to ethosuximide include agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and systemic lupus erythematosus; however, these occur rarely and the medication is generally well tolerated.

Epidemiologyo Moyamoya is a disease of children and young people, with a bi-modal age distribution: 1) Early childhood: peak ~4 years of age (two-thirds)2) Middle age: 30-40 years of age (one-third)o The condition was initially described in Japanese patients, where it is still most common, in which 7-10% of cases are familial. Clinical presentationo Presentation is to some degree age dependent. In children hemispheric ischaemic strokes are most pronounced, whereas in adults haemorrhage from the abnormal vessels is more common. Watershed infarcts are also very commonly identified. Radiographic featureso Moyamoya disease affects the bilateral distal ICAs and circle of Willis. Up to 18% of patients with moyamoya may present with unilateral angiography-documented disease8. o Small abnormal net-like vessels proliferate giving the characteristic \"puff of smoke\" appearance on direct angiography. CTA and MRA is not always able to demonstrate this appearance on account of lower flow and spatial resolution. o Although classically described affecting the ICA, over 50% of patients also have involvement of the posterior cerebral arteries. Treatment and prognosiso Bypassing the occlusive segments is the aim of most surgical therapy. o In adults external carotid artery to middle cerebral artery (ECA-MCA) anastomoses can be performed as the vessels are larger. One of the surgical option is superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass. o Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis is the treatment of choice in paediatric patients as their vessels are too small to allow direct anastomosis.",

        "exp": "Avoiding precipitating events such as alcohol use and sleep deprivation may be useful. However, medical therapy with anti-convulsants is typically needed and well tolerated. The majority of patients can be well-controlled on a single drug, most commonly valproic acid. Other medications that might be used separately or in combination include lamotrigine, levetiracetam, clonazepam, and topiramate. Drug of choice for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is Sodiumvalproate, benzodiazepines, ACTH. Newer antiepileptics such as topiramate, zonisamide, lamotrigine can be used. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is an epilepsy syndrome characterized by myoclonic jerks (quick jerks of the arms or legs), generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCSs), and sometimes, absence seizures. The seizures of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy often occur when people first awaken in the morning. Seizures can be triggered by lack of sleep, extreme fatigue, stress, or alcohol consumption. Onset typically occurs around adolesence in otherwise healthy children. The causes of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy are very complex and not completely understood. Mutations in one of several genes, including the GABRA1 and the EFHC1 genes, can cause or increase susceptibility to this condition. Although patients usually require lifelong treatment with anticonvulsants, their overall prognosis is generally good. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",

        "exp": "Focal seizures have the best prognosis when compared with other. Neonatal seizure classification Clonic seizures These movements most commonly are associated with electrographic seizures. They often involve 1 extremity or 1 side of the body. The rhythm of the clonic movements is usually slow, at 1-3 movements per second. Tonic seizures These may involve 1 extremity or the whole body. Focal tonic seizures involving 1 extremity often are associated with electrographic seizures. Generalized tonic seizures often manifest with tonic extension of the upper and lower limbs and also may involve the axial musculature in an opisthotonic fashion. Generalized tonic seizures mimic decoicate posturing; the majority are not associated with electrographic seizures. Myoclonic seizures These may occur focally in 1 extremity or in several body pas (in which case they are described as multifocal myoclonic seizures). Focal and multifocal myoclonic seizures typically are not associated with electrographic correlates. These movements are thought to be non-epileptic in nature and a reflection of severe encephalopathy. Prognosis Prognosis is determined by the etiology of the neonatal seizures. If the EEG background is normal, the prognosis is excellent for seizures to resolve; normal development is likely. Severe EEG background abnormalities indicate poor prognosis; such patients frequently have cerebral palsy and epilepsy. The presence of spikes on EEG is associated with a 30% risk of developing future epilepsy. The prognosis following neonatal seizures that result from isolated subarachnoid hemorrhage is excellent, with 90% of children not having residual neurologic deficits.

The seizure affects people&; s awareness and may cause them to lose consciousness. A complex paial seizure stas focally within the brain and causes impairment of consciousness. This definition is based on both clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) data. A complex paial seizure is most commonly a manifestation of temporal lobe epilepsy, but the term is so broadly defined (le, as any focal seizure with Impairment of consciousness) that it is very nonspecific. For this reason, many clinicians make a point of distinguishing between temporal and extratemporal complex paial seizures. Complex paial seizures are paial seizures that are associated with an alteration of consciousness ( Complex-Paial Seizures with Automatisms). The term psychomotor describes a paicular semiology characterized by automatisms and impairment of consciousness, usually of temporal lobe origin. Automatisms: Automatisms are nonpurposeful, stereotyped, and repetitive behaviors that commonly accompany complex paial seizures (In the sem lologic classification, they define automotor seizures). The behavior Is Inappropriate for the situation. Verbal automatisms range from simple vocalizations, such as moaning, to more complex, comprehensible, stereotyped speech.

Febrile seizures are frequently genetically determined. The convulsions are not related to the degree of temperature, but are frequent if temperature rises abruptly. Febrile convulsions may be (i) simple, benign; or (ii) atypical, complex. Lumbar puncture should be performed in the first episode of febrile seizure, in infants below 1 yr who are not immunized with Hib and pneumococcal vaccine, In all patients with febrile convulsions, a lumbar puncture is not required routinely.

The Neurocritical Care Society's guideline states that benzodiazepines remain the \"emergent initial therapy\" of choice based both on available evidence and expe consensus. When possible, intravenous benzodiazepine administration is preferred. However, formulations exist for buccal, intranasal, intramuscular, and rectal administration, and these should be administered if intravenous access cannot be rapidly established. The American Epilepsy Society's guideline concludes that intravenous lorazepam and diazepam are efficacious at stopping seizures lasting at least five min and that rectal diazepam, intramuscular midazolam, intranasal midazolam, and buccal midazolam are probably effective at terminating seizures lasting at least five minutes.

Ultrasound imaging, which uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images, is often used for an initial assessment for infants because it&; s a relatively simple, low-risk procedure. The ultrasound device is placed over the soft spot (fontanel) on the top of a baby&; s head. Ultrasound may also detect hydrocephalus prior to bih when the procedure is used during routine prenatal examinations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses radio waves and a magnetic field to produce detailed 3D or cross-sectional images of the brain. This test is painless, but it is noisy and requires lying still. MRI scans can show enlarged ventricles caused by excess cerebrospinal fluid. They may also be used to identify underlying causes of hydrocephalus or other conditions contributing to the symptoms. Children may need mild sedation for some MRI scans. However, some hospitals use a very fast version of MRIthat generally doesn&; t require sedation. Computerized tomography (CT) scan is a specialized X-ray technology that can produce cross-sectional views of the brain. Scanning is painless and quick. But this test also requires lying still, so a child usually receives a mild sedative. Drawbacks to CT scanning include less detailed images than an MRI, and exposure to a small amount of radiation. CT scans for hydrocephalus are usually used only for emergency exams. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",
