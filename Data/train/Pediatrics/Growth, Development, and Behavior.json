        "exp": "Human bites can pose a significant problem. They can become infected with oropharyngeal bacteria, including S aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Eikenella corrodens, and anaerobes. A patient with an infected human bite of the hand requires hospitalization for appropriate drainage procedures, Gram stain and culture of the exudate, vigorous cleaning, debridement, and appropriate antibiotics. The infected wound should be left open and allowed to heal by secondary intention (healing by granulation tissue rather than closure with sutures). Empiric antibiotic therapy for an infected bite should be penicillinase-resistant; amoxicillin-clavulanate orally, or ticarcillin-clavulanate or ampicillin-sulbactam IV are good choices. Antibiotic prophylaxis for noninfected bite wounds remains controversial, but some experts recommend prophylaxis for all significant human bites.",

        "question": "An 8-hour-old term infant develops increased respiratory distress, hypothermia, and hypotension. A complete blood count (CBC) demonstrates a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2500/mL with 80% bands. The chest radiograph is shown below. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "(c) Source: (Hay et al, pp 1163-1166. Kliegman et al, pp 925-928. McMillan et al, pp 482-483, 501-506. Rudolph et al, pp 1097-1099.) The radiograph shows diffuse that infiltrates bilaterally; this can be seen with neonatal pneumonia or primary surfactant deficiency. The rapid onset of the symptoms, the low WBC count with left shift, and the depicted chest x-ray findings, however, are typical of a patient with group B streptococcus (GBS) pneumonia. Appropriate management would include rapid recognition of symptoms, cardiorespiratory support, and prompt institution of antibiotics. Despite these measures, mortality from this infection is not uncommon. The other infectious causes listed do not present so early, and the noninfectious causes listed do not cause elevations in the band count. GBS disease in the infant is decreasing in incidence with better prevention strategies in the perinatal period; early screening in pregnancy and treatment with antibiotics just prior to delivery to eliminate GBS colonization markedly decreases the risk to the infant. Congenital syphilis can cause pneumonia, but it is diagnosed at birth along with other features including hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, rashes, hemolytic anemia, and others. Diaphragmatic hernia presents with early respiratory distress, but the diagnosis is confirmed clinically with bowel sounds heard in the chest and a radiograph that has loops of bowel located above the normal placement of the diaphragm. Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) causes an increase in respiratory rate and occasionally a low oxygen requirement; the history is often positive for a cesarean delivery, and the radiograph shows retained fluid in the fissures. TTN does not cause temperature instability nor an abnormal CBC. Chlamydial pneumonia is not a condition that occurs in an 8-hour-old infant; it is generally a mild pneumonia that can develop in an exposed infant at several weeks of life.",

        "exp": "(b) Source: (Hay et al, p 397. Kliegman et al, p 2262. McMillan et al, pp 839-840. Rudolph et al, p 1262.) Pityriasis rosea is a benign condition that usually presents with a herald patch, a single round or oval lesion appearing anywhere on the body. Usually about 5 to 10 days after the appearance of the herald patch, a more diffuse rash involving the upper extremities and trunk appears. These lesions are oval or round, slightly raised, and pink to brown in color. The lesion is covered in a fine scale with some central clearing possible. The rash can appear in a Christmas tree pattern on the back, identified by the aligning of the long axis of the lesions with the cutaneous cleavage lines. The rash lasts 2 to 12 weeks and can be pruritic. This rash is commonly mistaken for tinea corporis, and the consideration of secondary syphilis is important.Treatment is usually unnecessary but can consist of topical emollients and oral antihistamines, as needed. More uncommonly, topical steroids can be helpful if the itching is severe. Lichen planus is rare in children. It is intensely pruritic, and additional lesions can be induced with scratching. The lesion is commonly found on the flexor surfaces of the wrists, forearms, inner thighs, and occasionally on the oral mucosa. Seborrheic dermatitis can begin anytime during life; it frequently presents as cradle cap in the newborn period. This rash is commonly greasy, scaly, and erythematous and, in smaller children, involves the face, neck, axilla, and diaper area. In older children, the rash can be localized to the scalp and intertriginous areas. Pruritus can be marked. Contact dermatitis is characterized by redness, weeping, and oozing of the affected skin. The pattern of distribution can be helpful in identification of the offending agent. The rash can be pruritic; removal of the causative agent and use of topical emollients or steroids is curative. Psoriasis consists of red papules that coalesce to form plaques with sharp edges. A thick, silvery scale develops on the surface and leaves a drop of blood upon its removal (Auspitz sign). Additional lesions develop upon scratching older lesions. Commonly affected sites include scalp, knees, elbows, umbilicus, and genitalia.",

Abundant evidence showss that the linguistic abilities related to learning to read involve phonology, with deficits in phonologic awareness best predicting dyslexia.# Theories of dyslexia that implicate the visual system or deficits in the temporal processing of auditory and visual stimuli have not been usufficiently substantiated b research.# Dyslexia is both familial and heritable.# Family history in one of the most important risk factorsl about half of children who have a parent with dyslexia as well as half of the siblings of dyslexics and half of the parents of dyslexics may have the disorder.# These data suggest that in dyslexic readers disruption of posterior reading systems underlies the failure of skilled reading to develop, while a shift to ancillary systems supports accurate, but not automatic, word reading.Epidemiology# Dyslexia may be the most common neurobehavioral disorder affecting children, with prevalence rates ranging from 5-10% in clinic-and school-identified samples to 17.5% in unselected population-based samples.# Several studies indicate similar numbers of affected males and females.# Both prospective and retrospective longitudinal studies indicate dyslexia is a persistent, chronic condition rather than a transient developmental lag.Clinical Manifestations# Difficulties in decoding and word recognition may vary according to age and developmental level. However the cardinal signs of dyslexia observed in school-aged children and adults are in inaccurate and labored approach to decoding, word recognition, and text reading.# Listening comprehension is typically robust.# In several studies, oder children have been found to improve reading accuracy over time, albeit without commensurate gains in reading fluency; they remain slow readers.# Difficulties in spelling typically reflect the phonologically based difficulties observed in oral reading.# A parental history frequently identifies early subtle language difficulties in dyslexic children.# Many children identified as dyslexic during the primary grades displayed difficulties playing rhyming games and learning the names for letters and numbers during the preschool and kindergarten years. Indeed, recent longitudinal studies demonstrate that kindergarten assessments of these language skills are highly predictive of latler reading skill.# Parents also frequently report that although their child relishes the opportunity to be read to, reading aloud to the parent or reading independently is resisted.# Dyslexia may co-occur with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Diagnosis# At all ages, dyslexia is a clinical diagnosis.# The clinician seeks to determine through history, observation, and psychometric assessment if there are (1) unexpected difficulties in reading (i.e., difficulties in reading that are unexpected for the person's cognitive capacity as shown by his or her age, intelligence, level of education, or professional status( and (2) associated linguistic problems at the level of phonologic processing. There is no single test score that is patho9gnomonic of dyslexia.# The diagnosis should reflect a thoughtful synthesis of all the clinical data available.# Dyslexia is distinguished from other disorders that may prominently features reading difficulties, by the unique, circumscribed nature of the phonologic deficit, one not intruding into other linguistic or cognitive domains.# Family history, teacher/classroom observation, and tests of language (particularly phonology), reading, and spelling represent a core assessment for the diagnosis of dyslexia in children; additional tests of intellectual ability, attention, memory, general language skills, and mathematrics may be administered as part of a more comprehensive evaluation of cognitive, linguistic, and academic function.Treatment# The management of dyslexia demands a life-span perspective; early on, the focus is on remediation of the reading problems.# Newer knowledge of the importance of early language and phonologic skills may lead to the prevention of significant reading problems, even in predisposed children.# As a child matures and enters the more time-demanding setting of secondary school, the emphasis shifts to the important role of providing accommodations.# Until very recently school reading intervention was not based on rigorous scientific evidence; overall, it was too little too general, and too unsystematic.# Effective intervention programs are balanced; they provide systematic instruction in phonemic awareness, phonic fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension strategiles and provide ample opportunities for writing, reading, and discussing literature.# Taking each component of the reading process in turn, effective interventions improve phonemic awareness (PA): ability to focus on and manipulate phonemes (speech sounds) in spoken syllables and words.# The elements found to be most effective in enhancing PA, reading, and spelling skills include teaching children manipulate phonemes with letters; focusing the instruction on one or two types of phoneme manipulations rather than multiple types; teasching children in small groups; and providing systematic, explicit instruction rather than incidental instruction in PA. Providing instruction in PA is necessary buyt not sufficient to teach children to read.# Effective intervention programs include teaching phonics, that is, making sure that the begilnning reader understands how letters are letters are linked to sounds (phonemes) to form letter-sound correspondences and spelling patters.# Often overlooked, and critical to effectively teaching phonics, is to make sure that the instruction is explicit and systematic; phonics instruction enhances children's success in learning to read and systematic phonics instruction is more effective than instruction that teaches little or no phonics or teaches phonics haphazardly or in a \"by-the-way approach.# The treatment of dyslexia in students in high school, college, and graduate school is typically based on accommodation rather than remediation.# College students with a childhood history of dyslexia requiree extra time in reading and writing assigments as well as examinations.# Many adolescent and adult students have been able to improve their reading accuracy, though without commensurate gains in reading speed. Other helpful accommodations include the use of laptop computers with spelling checkers, tape recorders in the classroom, recorded books, access to lecture notes, tutorial services, alternatives to multiple choice tests, and a separate quiet room for taking tests.",

Encopresis is defined as the passage of feces in inappropriate locations after bowel control would be expected (usually older than 4 years). Encopresis is seen both with chronic constipation and overflow incontinence (retentive encopresis), and without constipation (nonretentive encopresis). Retentive encopresis is more common, and is the source of this child's problem. There is leakage of liquid stool around a large fecal impaction, resulting in fecal soiling. The radiograph demonstrates a dilated, stool-filled colon consistent with retentive encopresis. Treatment involves clearing the fecal mass, maintaining soft stools for a short period of time with mineral oil or stool softeners (3-6 months), and behavioral modification. Most children will grow out of this condition. Timeout would be ineffective, because these children usually have dysfunctional anal sphincters and little control over the problem; they do not know they are soiling their clothes until it is too late.

        "exp": "Sleep disturbances are fairly common in childhood. Many children resist going to bed, and parents frequently give in just to get the child to sleep by allowing the child to sleep in the parents' bed or allowing them to stay up late. Unfortunately, children learn remarkably well how to get what they want, and the parents' concessions only make the problem worse. Learned behavior (behavioral insomnia, dyssomnia) is the root of many sleep disturbances in young children.Other types of sleep disturbance in children fall into the category of sleep disruptions, such as nightmares and night terrors.A nightmare is a scary or disturbing dream that usually awakens the child and causes agitation about the content of the dream. Nightmares occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Many children and adults have an occasional nightmare; recurrent or frequent nightmares, however, may be indicative of an ongoing stress in the child's life. Night terrors (pavor nocturnus) are non-REM phenomena seen less commonly than nightmares, occurring in 1% to 6% of all children. The child will be described as apparently awake but unresponsive; they can have evidence of autonomic arousal such as tachycardia, sweating, and tachypnea, and appear frightened and agitated. Attempts at calming the child are usually not effective, and the child will eventually go back to sleep. Although usually a problem in early childhood, night terrors can sometimes continue through adolescence.Somnambulism, or sleepwalking, occurs in 15% of children and is described as recurrent episodes of rising from bed and walking around. The child is typically hard to arouse and will have amnesia after the event. This usually happens in the first third of the sleep cycle, during stage 4 non- REM sleep. Somniloquy, or sleep talking, can occur at any sleep stage and is seen in all ages.",

Macrocephaly can result from enlargement of the skull bones or an increase in the volume of the intracranial structures like cerebrospinal fluid, blood, or the brain parenchyma itself (megalencephaly).

Only 4% of dog bites become infected (and therefore do not necessarily need antibiotic prophylaxis), compared with 35% of cat bites and 50% of monkey bites (which require antibiotics in most cases). Cat bites are usually deep punctures. Human bites almost invariably become infected.The etiologies of these infections are polymicrobial. Pasteurella multocida is a common organism in infected cat and dog bites. Infected human bites tend to have positive cultures for S viridans, S aureus, and Eikenella corrodens. Treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate orally or ampicillin- sulbactam IV is recommended. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for any bite sustained by an infant, a diabetic, or an immunocompromised patient because of the higher risk of infection in these persons.

There are various intelligence tests that have been devised. Few of them are Phataak adaptation of Bayley scale, Kulshrestha adaptation of Standford Binet test.",

Nelson, Textbook of Paediatrics, 18th/131)BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS in children (noted around 2-4 year age)# Include : Lying, Impulsiveness, Breathe holding, Decence and Temper tantrums.# Oppositionalism, temper tantrums, and breath holding spells are not unusual during the 1st years of life and are age- typical expressions of frustration or anger. Parental and caregiver response to these behaviors is very important.# Pharmacotherapy for aggression or disruptive and antisocial behavior is generally used as an adjunct to family-based therapy, parent training, or multisystemic therapy.Lying:# 2 - 4 year old children often use lying as a method of playing with language.# By observing reaction of parents preschoolers born about expectations for honesty in communicator.# It is also a form of fantasy for them.# In school goers lying is most often to cover up something that child does not want to accept in behavior.# Lie is also to protect against loss of self-esteem.# As with other antisocial behaviors, lying may be used as a method of rebellion.Tantrums:They are also prone to lose internal control, that is, to have temper tantrums. Fear, over-tiredness, inconsistent expectations, or physical discomfort can also evoke tantrums. Tantrums normally appear towards the end of the 1st yr of life and peak in prevalence between 2 and 4 yr of age. Tantrums lasting more than 15min or regularly occurring more than 3 times day may reflect underlying medical, emotional, or social problems.",

        "question": "A 5-year-old child refuses to sleep in his bed, claiming there are monsters in his closet and that he has bad dreams. The parents allow him to sleep with them in their bed to avoid the otherwise inevitable screaming fit. The parents note that the child sleeps soundly, waking only at sunrise. Choose the sleep disturbance most consistent with the history",
        "exp": "Sleep disturbances are fairly common in childhood. Many children resist going to bed, and parents frequently give in just to get the child to sleep by allowing the child to sleep in the parents' bed or allowing them to stay up late. Unfortunately, children learn remarkably well how to get what they want, and the parents' concessions only make the problem worse. Learned behavior (behavioral insomnia, dyssomnia) is the root of many sleep disturbances in young children.Other types of sleep disturbance in children fall into the category of sleep disruptions, such as nightmares and night terrors.A nightmare is a scary or disturbing dream that usually awakens the child and causes agitation about the content of the dream. Nightmares occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Many children and adults have an occasional nightmare; recurrent or frequent nightmares, however, may be indicative of an ongoing stress in the child's life. Night terrors (pavor nocturnus) are non-REM phenomena seen less commonly than nightmares, occurring in 1% to 6% of all children. The child will be described as apparently awake but unresponsive; they can have evidence of autonomic arousal such as tachycardia, sweating, and tachypnea, and appear frightened and agitated. Attempts at calming the child are usually not effective, and the child will eventually go back to sleep. Although usually a problem in early childhood, night terrors can sometimes continue through adolescence.Somnambulism, or sleepwalking, occurs in 15% of children and is described as recurrent episodes of rising from bed and walking around. The child is typically hard to arouse and will have amnesia after the event. This usually happens in the first third of the sleep cycle, during stage 4 non- REM sleep. Somniloquy, or sleep talking, can occur at any sleep stage and is seen in all ages.",
