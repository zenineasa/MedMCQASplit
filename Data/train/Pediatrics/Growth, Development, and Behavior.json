        "question": "An 8-hour-old term infant develops increased respiratory distress, hypothermia, and hypotension. A complete blood count (CBC) demonstrates a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2500/mL with 80% bands. The chest radiograph is shown below. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "(c) Source: (Hay et al, pp 1163-1166. Kliegman et al, pp 925-928. Mc. Millan et al, pp 482-483, 501-506. Rudolph et al, pp 1097-1099.) The radiograph shows diffuse that infiltrates bilaterally; this can be seen with neonatal pneumonia or primary surfactant deficiency. The rapid onset of the symptoms, the low WBC count with left shift, and the depicted chest x-ray findings, however, are typical of a patient with group B streptococcus (GBS) pneumonia. Appropriate management would include rapid recognition of symptoms, cardiorespiratory support, and prompt institution of antibiotics. Despite these measures, mortality from this infection is not uncommon. The other infectious causes listed do not present so early, and the noninfectious causes listed do not cause elevations in the band count. GBS disease in the infant is decreasing in incidence with better prevention strategies in the perinatal period; early screening in pregnancy and treatment with antibiotics just prior to delivery to eliminate GBS colonization markedly decreases the risk to the infant. Congenital syphilis can cause pneumonia, but it is diagnosed at birth along with other features including hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, rashes, hemolytic anemia, and others. Diaphragmatic hernia presents with early respiratory distress, but the diagnosis is confirmed clinically with bowel sounds heard in the chest and a radiograph that has loops of bowel located above the normal placement of the diaphragm. Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) causes an increase in respiratory rate and occasionally a low oxygen requirement; the history is often positive for a cesarean delivery, and the radiograph shows retained fluid in the fissures. TTN does not cause temperature instability nor an abnormal CBC. Chlamydial pneumonia is not a condition that occurs in an 8-hour-old infant; it is generally a mild pneumonia that can develop in an exposed infant at several weeks of life.",

Infact, breath-holding occurs during expiration and is reflexive (not volitional) in nature.* There are two major types of breath holding spellsA) Cyanotic form (cyanotic spells)# This is more common and is provoked in response to frustration and anger precipitated by upsetting or scolding infant/child.# Cyanotic spells are due to central sympathetic overactivity.# Clinical features include generalized cyanosis, apnea, forced expiration, opisthotonus, shrill cry and bradycardia. Crying stops during forced expiration. Seizures may occur due to cerebral hypoxia, but antiepileptics are not required.# The only treatment is support and reassurance to parents. B) Pallid form (Pallid spells)# These are initiated by painful experience, e. g falling and striking the head.# Pallid spells are due to excessive central parasympethetic activity.# Clinical features include pallor, apnea, loss of consciousness, hypotonia, seizures and bradycarda.# Treatment includes support and reassurance of parents. Atropine may be used in refractory cases.* Iron supplementation may be useful in some children with breath holding spells.",

Pityriasis rosea is a benign condition that usually presents with a herald patch, a single round or oval lesion appearing anywhere on the body. Usually about 5 to 10 days after the appearance of the herald patch, a more diffuse rash involving the upper extremities and trunk appears. These lesions are oval or round, slightly raised, and pink to brown in color. The lesion is covered in a fine scale with some central clearing possible. The rash can appear in a Christmas tree pattern on the back, identified by the aligning of the long axis of the lesions with the cutaneous cleavage lines. The rash lasts 2 to 12 weeks and can be pruritic. This rash is commonly mistaken for tinea corporis, and the consideration of secondary syphilis is important. Treatment is usually unnecessary but can consist of topical emollients and oral antihistamines, as needed. More uncommonly, topical steroids can be helpful if the itching is severe. Lichen planus is rare in children. It is intensely pruritic, and additional lesions can be induced with scratching. The lesion is commonly found on the flexor surfaces of the wrists, forearms, inner thighs, and occasionally on the oral mucosa. Seborrheic dermatitis can begin anytime during life; it frequently presents as cradle cap in the newborn period. This rash is commonly greasy, scaly, and erythematous and, in smaller children, involves the face, neck, axilla, and diaper area. In older children, the rash can be localized to the scalp and intertriginous areas. Pruritus can be marked. Contact dermatitis is characterized by redness, weeping, and oozing of the affected skin. The pattern of distribution can be helpful in identification of the offending agent. The rash can be pruritic; removal of the causative agent and use of topical emollients or steroids is curative. Psoriasis consists of red papules that coalesce to form plaques with sharp edges. A thick, silvery scale develops on the surface and leaves a drop of blood upon its removal (Auspitz sign). Additional lesions develop upon scratching older lesions. Commonly affected sites include scalp, knees, elbows, umbilicus, and genitalia.",

Temper tantrums are a normal part of childhood development and as the question states, there is no common cause given clearly in the textbooks, but out of the options, most probable answer would be bad parenting. Temper tantrums are normal part of child development. Characterizing the type of tantrum may help the parents to understand and so that different approaches can be used to deal with the condition. Types of tantrumsa) Frustration or fatigue relatedb) Attention seeking or demandingc) Refusald) Disruptive. Even though temper tantrums are normal part of childhood and parenting, it is important to asses families to determine if there are contributing factors such as parental depression or family violence. Tantrums normally appear towards the first year of life and peak in prevalence between 2 year and 4 year of age. Tantiums lasting more than 15 minutes or regularly occurring more than 3 times a day may reflect underlying medical, emotional or social problems. Frequent tantiums after 5 years of age tend to persist throughout childhood. The rule of thumb for the length of time out in managing tantrum is approximately 1 minute per year of age. Most toddlers respond with tantrums as parents impose limits that restrict their autonomy. (Same question was asked in Kerala, 2006 but the choice \"bad parenting was not there, instead \"improper teaching habits \"was given in the choice, which was the answer.)",

Encopresis is defined as the passage of feces in inappropriate locations after bowel control would be expected (usually older than 4 years). Encopresis is seen both with chronic constipation and overflow incontinence (retentive encopresis), and without constipation (nonretentive encopresis). Retentive encopresis is more common, and is the source of this child's problem. There is leakage of liquid stool around a large fecal impaction, resulting in fecal soiling. The radiograph demonstrates a dilated, stool-filled colon consistent with retentive encopresis. Treatment involves clearing the fecal mass, maintaining soft stools for a short period of time with mineral oil or stool softeners (3-6 months), and behavioral modification. Most children will grow out of this condition. Timeout would be ineffective, because these children usually have dysfunctional anal sphincters and little control over the problem; they do not know they are soiling their clothes until it is too late. Daily enemas could potentially be harmful. A rectal biopsy would help diagnose Hirschsprung disease, but the story presented is not consistent with that diagnosis.",

Option (A) Play increases in complexity and imagination, from simple imitation of common experiences, such as shopping and putting baby to bed (2 or 3 yr of age), to more extended scenarios involving singular events, such as going to the zoo or going on a trip (3 or 4 yr of age), to the creation of scenarios that have only been imagined, such as flying to the moon (4 or 5 yr of age). By age 3 yr, cooperative play is seen inactivities such as building a tower of blocks together; later, more structured role-play activity, as in playing house, is seen. Play also becomes increasingly governed by rules, from early rules about asking (rather than taking) and sharing (2 or 3 yr of age), to rules that change from moment to moment, according to the desires of the players (4 and 5 yr of age), to the beginning of the recognition of rules as relatively immutable (5 yr of age and beyond). Option (B) By 6 years of age a child should be able to write the alphabet. Option (C) Child starts speaking short sentences from 19 months onwards.

Parental and caregiver response to these behaviors is very important.# Pharmacotherapy for aggression or disruptive and antisocial behavior is generally used as an adjunct to family-based therapy, parent training, or multisystemic therapy. Lying:# 2 - 4 year old children often use lying as a method of playing with language.# By observing reaction of parents preschoolers born about expectations for honesty in communicator.# It is also a form of fantasy for them.# In school goers lying is most often to cover up something that child does not want to accept in behavior.# Lie is also to protect against loss of self-esteem.# As with other antisocial behaviors, lying may be used as a method of rebellion. Tantrums: They are also prone to lose internal control, that is, to have temper tantrums. Fear, over-tiredness, inconsistent expectations, or physical discomfort can also evoke tantrums. Tantrums normally appear towards the end of the 1st yr of life and peak in prevalence between 2 and 4 yr of age. Tantrums lasting more than 15min or regularly occurring more than 3 times day may reflect underlying medical, emotional, or social problems.",
