Gross hematuria is seen in 20-30% of cases.o All changes result from the deposition of circulating immune complexes, containing IgA and complement on the endothelium of the blood vessels throughout the body and within the glomerular mesangial regionso Diagnosis is confirmed by presence of palpable purpura with normal platelet count along with one or more of the following : abdominal pain, arthralgia/arthritis and mesangial deposition of IgA.o Renal manifestations usually start at the onset or within 3 months of onset of other symptoms.",
