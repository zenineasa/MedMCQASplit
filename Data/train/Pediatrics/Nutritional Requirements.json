Ghai says (may become a future question)\"For optimum catch tip growth of severely malnourished children, therapeutic diet should contain fluids (150mL/kg/day), energy (175-200 Kcal/kg/day) and protein (4-5g/kg/day). Energy, rather than protein is the principal determinant of catch up growth rate.\"",
