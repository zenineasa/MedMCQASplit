        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Fenoldopam Summary And Recommendations for prevention of contrast induced nephropathy (uptodate recommendation )o Optimal therapy to prevent contrast-induced acute renal failure remains uncertain. Patients with near-normal renal function are at little risk and few precautions are necessary other than avoidance of volume depletion. o We recommend the following preventive measures for patients at increased risk of contrast nephropathy, which is defined a serum creatinine >1. 5 mg/dL (132 micromol/L) or an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/l 73 m2, particularly in those with diabetes. o Use, if possible, ultrasonography, MRI without gadolinium contrast, or CT scanning without radiocontrast agents. o We recommend NOT using high osmolal agents is not recommendedo We recommend the use of iodixanol or nonionic low osmolal agems such as iopamidol or ioversol rather than iohexol. o Use lower doses of contrast and avoid repetitive, closely spaced studies. o Avoid volume depletion and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. o If there are no contra indications to volume expansion, we recommend isotonic intravenous fluids prior to and continued for several hours after contrast administration. The optimal type offluid and timing of administration are not well established. We suggest isotonic bicarbonate rather than isotonic saline. o Despite conflicting data, we suggest that acetylcysteine be administered the day before and the day of the procedure, based upon its potentialfor benefit and low toxicity and cost. If acetylcysteine is administered, we suggest giving 1200 mg orally twice daily rather than 600 mg twice daily the day before and the day of the procedure. o Based upon the lack of convincing evidence of benefit and ihe potential risk of anaphylactoid reactions, we suggest not using intravenous acetylcysteine for the prevention of contrast nephropathy. (Note: Oral acetylcysteine is used)o We recommend NOT using mannitol or other diuretics prophytactically. o Among patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD, we recommend NOTperforming prophylactic hemofiltration or hemodialysis after contrast exposure. o Among patients with stage 5 CKD, we suggest prophylactic hemodialysis after contrast exposure if there is already a functioning hemodialysis access.",

Harrison 18th/ p 476, 607)# Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, which regenerates reduced folates from the oxidized folates produced when thymidine monophosphate is formed from deoxyuridine monophosphate.# Without reduced folates, cells die a \"thymineless\" death.# N-5 tetrahydrofolate or N-5 formyltetrahydrofolate (leucovorin) can bypass this block and rescue cells from methotrexate, which is maintained in cells by polyglutamylation. METHOTREXATE - Side Effects:# In addition to bone marrow suppression and mucosal irritation, methotrexate can cause renal failure itself at high doses owing to crystallization in renal tubules; therefore high-dose regimens REQUIRE ALKALINIZATION OF URINE with increased flow by hydration. 6# Less frequent adverse effects include reversible increases in transaminases and hypersensitivity-like pulmonary syndrome.# Chronic low-dose methotrexate can cause hepatic fibrosis.# When administered to the intrathecal space, methotrexate can cause chemical arachnoiditis and CNS dysfunction.# Trimetrexate is a methotrexate derivative that is not polyglutamylated and does not use the reduced folate carrier.# The effects of folate antagonists that inhibit dihydrofolate reductase can be counteracted by folinic acid (5-formyl tetrahydrofolate ) in a dose of 100 to 200 mg/d, which circumvents the block in folate metabolism by providing a form of folate that can be converted to 5, 10-methylene THF.

Preoperative medical therapy is aimed at: o Controlling hypertension (including preventing a hypertensive crisis during surgery)o Volume expansiono In patients with undiagnosed pheochromocytomas who undergo surgery for other reasons (and who therefore have not undergone preoperative medical therapy), surgical mortality: rates are high due to lethal hypertensive crises, malignant arrhythmias, and multiorgan failure. Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockadeo Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade is the most common approach to control blood pressure and prevent intraoperative hypertensive crises. Alpha-adrenergic blockadeo An alpha-adrenergic blocker is given 10 to 14 days preoperatively to normalize blood pressure and expand the contracted blood volume. o Phenoxvbenzamine is the preferred drug for preoperative preparation to control blood pressure and arrhythmia in most centers in the United States. It is an irreversible, long-acting, nonspecific alpha-adrenergic blocking agent. o The initial dose is 10 mg once or twice daily, and the dose is increased by 10 to 20 mg in divided doses every two to three days as needed to control blood pressure and spells. o The final dose of phenoxvbenzamine is typically between 20 and 100 mg daily. Beta-adrenergic blockadeo After adequate alpha-adrenergic blockade has been achieved, beta-adrenergic blockade is initiated, which typically occurs two to three days preoperatively. o The beta-adrenergic blocker should never be started first because blockade of vasodilator)' peripheral beta- adrenergic receptors with unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation can lead to a further elevation in blood pressure. The alternatives to a and b adrenergic agents are calcium channel blockers and metyrosine. Calcium channel blockerso Although perioperative alpha-adrenergic blockade is widely recommended, a second regimen that has been utilized involves the administration of a calcium channel blocker. o Nicardipine is the most commonly used calcium channel blocker in this setting; the starting dose is 30 mg twice daily of the sustained release preparation.

Explanation: The antibiotic prophylactic regimens below are recommended by the American Heail Association (AHA) only for patients with underlying cardiac conditions associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from infective endocarditis. High-Risk Cardiac Conditions. Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated for the following high-risk cardiac conditions: Prosthetic cardiac valve. History of infective endocarditis. Congenital heart disease (CHD) {except for the conditions listed, antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended for any other form of CHD). Unrepaired cyanotic CHD, including palliative shunts and conduits; Completely repaired congenital heart defect with prosthetic material or device, whether placed by surgery or by catheter intervention, during the first 6 months after the procedure; and (3) Repaired CHD with residual defects at the site or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device (which inhibits endothelialization). Cardiac transplantation recipients with cardiac valvular disease. Dental Procedures. For patients with high cardiac risk, antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for all dental procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissue or the periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa. The following dental procedures do not require endocarditis prophylaxis: Routine anesthetic injections through noninfected tissue. Taking dental radiographs. Placement of removable prosthodontic or orthodontic appliances. Adjustment of orthodontic appliances. Placement of orthodontic brackets. Shedding of deciduous teeth. Bleeding from trauma to the lips or oral mucosa. Respiratory Tract. Infected Skin, Skin Structures, or Musculoskeletal Tissue Procedures. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for. Invasive respiratory tract procedures that involve incision or biopsy of the respiratory mucosa (eg, tonsillecto my, adenoidectomy). Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended tor. Bronchoscopy unless the procedure involves Incision of the respiratory tract mucosa. For invasive respiratory tract procedures to treat an established infection (eg, drainage of abscess, empyema), administer an antibiotic that is active against Streptococcus viridans. Patients with high cardiac risk who undergo a surgical procedure that involves infected skin, skin structure, or musculoskeletal tissue should receive an agent active against staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci (eg. anti staphylococcal penicillin, cephalosporin). If the causative organism of respiratory, skin, skin structure, or musculoskeletal infection is known or suspected to be Staphylococcus aureus. administer an antistaphylococcal penicillin or cephalosporin, or vancomycin (if patient is unable to tolerate beta-lactam antibiotics). Vancomycin is recommended for known or suspected methicillin-resistant strains of S aureus. Genitourinary or GI Tract Procedures. Antibiotics are no longer recommended for endocarditis prophylaxis for patients undergoing genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract procedures. All doses shown below are administered once as a single dose 30-60 min before the procedure. Standard general prophylaxis. Amoxicillin. Adult dose: 2 g POPediatric dose: 50 mg/kg PO; not to exceed 2 g/ dose. Unable to take oral medication. Ampicillin. Adult dose: 2 g IV7. IMPediatric dose: 50 mg/kg IV/IM; not to exceed 2 g/dose. Allergic to penicillin. Clindamycin. Adult dose: 600 mg POPediatric dose: 20 mg/kg PO: not to exceed 600 mg/dose. Allergic to penicillin. Cephalexin or other first- or second-generation oral cephalosporin in equivalent dose (do not use cephalosporins in patients with a history of immediate-type hypersensitivity penicillin allergy, such as urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis).
