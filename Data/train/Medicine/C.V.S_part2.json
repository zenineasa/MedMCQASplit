        "exp": "cardiac output rarely occurs immediately after successful defibrillation. If after 2 minutes a pulse is not restored, a fuher biphasic shock of 150-200 joules is given. Thereafter, additional biphasic shocks of 150- 200 joules are given every 2 minutes after each cycle of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). During resuscitation, adrenaline (epinephrine, 1 mg i.v.) should be given every 3-5 minutes and consideration given to the use of intravenous amiodarone, especially if ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia reinitiates after successful defibrillation. ventricular fibrillation of low amplitude, or 'fine VF', may mimic asystole. If asystole cannot be confidently diagnosed, the patient should be regarded as having 'fine VF' and defibrillated. If an electrical rhythm is present that would be expected to produce a cardiac output, 'pulseless electrical activity' is present. There are several potentially reversible causes that can be easily remembered as a list of four Hs and four Ts (see Fig. 18.35). Pulseless electrical activity is treated by continuing CPR and adrenaline (epinephrine) administration whilst seeking such causes. Asystole is treated similarly, with the additional suppo of atropine and sometimes external or transvenous pacing in an attempt to generate an electrical rhythm. ref:harrison&;s principles of internal medicine,ed 18,pg no 2234",

Clinical indicators include reduced mean aerial pressure (MAP), tachycardia, cool skin and extremities, acute altered mental status, and oliguria. Hypotension is usually, though not always, present. The end result of multiorgan hypoperfusion is tissue hypoxia, oftenclinically manifested by lactic acidosis. Since the MAP is the product of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance (SVR), reductions in blood pressure can be caused by decreased cardiac output and/or decreased SVR. Accordingly, the initial evaluation of a hypotensive patient should include an assessment of the adequacy of cardiac output; this should be pa of the earliest assessment of the patient by the clinician at the bedside once shock is contemplated . Clinical evidence of diminished cardiac output includes a narrow pulse pressure--a marker that correlates with stroke volume--and cool extremities with delayed capillary refill. Signs of increased cardiac output include a widened pulse pressure (paicularly with a reduced diastolic pressure), warm extremities with bounding pulses, and rapid capillary refill. If a hypotensive patient has clinical signs of increased cardiac output, one can infer that the reduced blood pressure is a result of decreased SVR. ref:harrison&;s principles of internal medicine,ed 18,pg no 2198",

        "exp": "Mitral regurgitation (MR), mitral insufficiency, or mitral incompetence, is a form of valvular hea disease in which the mitral valve does not close properly when the hea pumps out blood. It is the abnormal leaking of blood backwards from the left ventricle, through the mitral valve, into the left atrium, when the left ventricle contracts, i.e. there is regurgitation of blood back into the left atrium.MR is the most common form of valvular hea disease.severity is determined by intensity of systolic murmer across mitral valve The degree of severity of MR can be quantified by the regurgitant fraction, which is the percentage of the left ventricular stroke volume that regurgitates into the left atrium. regurgitant fraction = {\\displaystyle {\\frac {V_{mitral}-V_{aoic}}{V_{mitral}}}\\times 100\\%} \\frac{V_{mitral} - V_{aoic}} {V_{mitral}} \\times 100\\% where Vmitral and Vaoic are, respectively, the volumes of blood that flow forward through the mitral valve and aoic valve during a cardiac cycle. Methods that have been used to assess the regurgitant fraction in mitral regurgitation include echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, fast CT scan, and cardiac MRI. The echocardiographic technique to measure the regurgitant fraction is to determine the forward flow through the mitral valve (from the left atrium to the left ventricle) during ventricular diastole, and comparing it with the flow out of the left ventricle through the aoic valve in ventricular systole. This method assumes that the aoic valve does not suffer from aoic insufficiency. Another way to quantify the degree of MR is to determine the area of the regurgitant flow at the level of the valve. This is known as the regurgitant orifice area, and correlates with the size of the defect in the mitral valve. One paicular echocardiographic technique used to measure the orifice area is measurement of the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA). The flaw of using PISA to determine the mitral valve regurgitant orifice area is that it measures the flow at one moment in time in the cardiac cycle, which may not reflect the average performance of the regurgitant jet.

The hypeension is driven by activation of the renin-angiotensin system in response to renal ischaemia. In atherosclerotic renal aery disease, there is usually evidence of vascular disease elsewhere, paicularlyin the legs. Repeated episodes of acute pulmonary oedema associated with severe hypeension, occurring without other obvious cause (e.g. myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, anaemia, thyrotoxicosis) in patients with normal or only mildly impaired renal and cardiac function, can occur in renal aery stenosis. This presentation is characteristic of bilateral renovascular disease because in unilateral disease salt and water retention are paly corrected by increased 'pressure natriuresis' in the normal kidney.in younger patients (< 50 years), fibromuscular dysplasia is a more likely cause of renal aery stenosis. This is an uncommon congenital disorder of unknown cause affecting the media ('medial fibroplasia'), which narrows the aery but rarely leads to total occlusion. It may be associated with disease in other aeries; for example, those who have carotid aery dissections are more likely to have this appearance in their renal aeries. It most commonly presents with hypeension in patients aged 15-30 years, and in women more frequently than men.

It usually manifests a few weeks after bih. VSD is an acyanotic congenital hea defect, aka a left-to-right shunt, so there are no signs of cyanosis in the early stage.

Larger VSDs may cause a parasternal heave, a displaced apex beat (the palpable heabeat moves laterally over time, as the hea enlarges). An infant with a large VSD will fail to thrive and become sweaty and tachypnoeic (breathe faster) with feeds.

        "question": "Which of the following about atherosclerosis is true?",
        "exp": "Atherogenesis is the developmental process of atheromatous plaques. It is characterized by a remodeling of aeries leading to subendothelial accumulation of fatty substances called plaques. The buildup of an atheromatous plaque is a slow process, developed over a period of several years through a complex series of cellular events occurring within the aerial wall and in response to a variety of local vascular circulating factors. One recent hypothesis suggests that, for unknown reasons, leukocytes, such as monocytes or basophils, begin to attack the endothelium of the aery lumen in cardiac muscle. The ensuing inflammation leads to formation of atheromatous plaques in the aerial tunica intima, a region of the vessel wall located between the endothelium and the tunica media. The bulk of these lesions is made of excess fat, collagen, and elastin. At first, as the plaques grow, only wall thickening occurs without any narrowing. Stenosis is a late event, which may never occur and is often the result of repeated plaque rupture and healing responses, not just the atherosclerotic process by itself. Early atherogenesis is characterized by the adherence of blood circulating monocytes (a type of white blood cell) to the vascular bed lining, the endothelium, then by their migration to the sub-endothelial space, and fuher activation into monocyte-derived macrophages. The primary documented driver of this process is oxidized lipoprotein paicles within the wall, beneath the endothelial cells, though upper normal or elevated concentrations of blood glucose also plays a major role and not all factors are fully understood. Fatty streaks may appear and disappear. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) paicles in blood plasma invade the endothelium and become oxidized, creating risk of cardiovascular disease. A complex set of biochemical reactions regulates the oxidation of LDL, involving enzymes (such as Lp-LpA2) and free radicals in the endothelium. Initial damage to the endothelium results in an inflammatory response. Monocytes enter the aery wall from the bloodstream, with platelets adhering to the area of insult. This may be promoted by redox signaling induction of factors such as VCAM-1, which recruit circulating monocytes, and M-CSF, which is selectively required for the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. The monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which proliferate locally, ingest oxidized LDL, slowly turning into large \"foam cells\" - so-called because of their changed appearance resulting from the numerous internal cytoplasmic vesicles and resulting high lipid content. Under the microscope, the lesion now appears as a fatty streak. Foam cells eventually die and fuher propagate the inflammatory process. In addition to these cellular activities, there is also smooth muscle proliferation and migration from the tunica media into the intima in response to cytokines secreted by damaged endothelial cells. This causes the formation of a fibrous capsule covering the fatty streak. Intact endothelium can prevent this smooth muscle proliferation by releasing nitric oxide. Calcification forms among vascular smooth muscle cells of the surrounding muscular layer, specifically in the muscle cells adjacent to atheromas and on the surface of atheroma plaques and tissue. In time, as cells die, this leads to extracellular calcium deposits between the muscular wall and outer poion of the atheromatous plaques. With the atheromatous plaque interfering with the regulation of the calcium deposition, it accumulates and crystallizes. A similar form of an intramural calcification, presenting the picture of an early phase of aeriosclerosis, appears to be induced by a number of drugs that have an antiproliferative mechanism of action (Rainer Liedtke 2008). Cholesterol is delivered into the vessel wall by cholesterol-containing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) paicles. To attract and stimulate macrophages, the cholesterol must be released from the LDL paicles and oxidized, a key step in the ongoing inflammatory process. The process is worsened if there is insufficient high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the lipoprotein paicle that removes cholesterol from tissues and carries it back to the liver. The foam cells and platelets encourage the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, which in turn ingest lipids, become replaced by collagen and transform into foam cells themselves. A protective fibrous cap normally forms between the fatty deposits and the aery lining (the intima). These capped fatty deposits (now called 'atheromas') produce enzymes that cause the aery to enlarge over time. As long as the aery enlarges sufficiently to compensate for the extra thickness of the atheroma, then no narrowing (\"stenosis\") of the opening (\"lumen\") occurs. The aery becomes expanded with an egg-shaped cross-section, still with a circular opening. If the enlargement is beyond propoion to the atheroma thickness, then an aneurysm is created Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 456",

In the absence of an ST elevation, a non-ST elevation MI, known as an NSTEMI, or an unstable angina may be presumed (both of these are indistinguishable on initial evaluation of symptoms). ST elevations indicate a completely blocked aery needing immediate reperfusion. In NSTEMI the blood flow is present but limited by stenosis. In NSTEMI, thrombolytics must be avoided as there is no clear benefit of their use . If the condition stays stable a cardiac stress test may be offered, and if needed subsequent revascularization will be carried out to restore a normal blood flow. If the blood flow becomes unstable an urgent angioplasty may be required. In these unstable cases the use of thrombolytics is contraindicated. At least 10% of treated cases of STEMI do not develop necrosis of the hea muscle. A successful restoration of blood flow is known as aboing the hea attack.

The left ventricle however, is still normally activated by the left bundle branch. These impulses are then able to travel through the myocardium of the left ventricle to the right ventricle and depolarize the right ventricle this way. As conduction through the myocardium is slower than conduction through the Bundle of His-Purkinje fibres, the QRS complex is seen to be widened. The QRS complex often shows an extra deflection that reflects the rapid depolarisation of the left ventricle followed by the slower depolarisation of the right ventricle. The criteria to diagnose a right bundle branch block on the electrocardiogram: The hea rhythm must originate above the ventricles (i.e., sinoatrial node, atria or atrioventricular node) to activate the conduction system at the correct point. The QRS duration must be more than 100 ms (incomplete block) or more than 120 ms (complete block). There should be a terminal R wave in lead V1 (often called \"R prime,\" and denoted by R, rR', rsR', rSR', or qR).

When the AV valves are pulled down by the contracting ventricular muscle, pressure falls rapidly and then rises as blood flows into the atria until the AV valves open early in diastole. The return of the AV valves to their relaxed position also contributes to this pressure rise by reducing atrial capacity. The atrial pressure changes are transmitted to the great veins, producing three characteristic waves in the record of jugular pressure . The a wave is due to atrial systole. As noted above, some blood regurgitates into the great veins when the atria contract. In addition, venous inflow stops, and the resultant rise in venous pressure contributes to the a wave. The c wave is the transmitted manifestation of the rise in atrial pressure produced by the bulging of the tricuspid valve into the atria during isovolumetric ventricular contraction. The v wave mirrors the rise in atrial pressure before the tricuspid valve opens during diastole. The jugular pulse waves are superimposed on the respiratory fluctuations in venous pressure. Venous pressure falls during inspiration as a result of the increased negative intrathoracic pressure and rises again during expiration. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1436",

If cardioversion is impossible, drugs that prolong the refractory period of the accessory connection should be used. IV procainamide or amiodarone is preferred, but any class Ia, class Ic, or class III antiarrhythmic can be used. People with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response are often treated with amiodaroneor procainamideto stabilize their hea rate. Procainamide and cardioversion are now accepted treatments for conversion of tachycardia found with WPW.Amiodarone was previously thought to be safe in atrial fibrillation with WPW, but after several cases of ventricular fibrillation, it is no longer recommended in this clinical scenario. AV node blockers should be avoided in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with WPW or history of it; this includes adenosine, diltiazem, verapamil, other calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers. They can exacerbate the syndrome by blocking the hea's normal electrical pathway (therefore oring 1:1 atrial to ventricle conduction through the pre-excitation pathway, potentially leading to unstable ventricular arrhythmias).

AFL makes a very distinct \"sawtooth\" pattern classification : * According to its duration Atrial fibrillation is classified into paroxysmal, persistent or permanent (the three P's). * Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is self-limiting and sinus rhythm restores spontaneously. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation lasts for less than 7 days and does not require intervention to conve to a normal rhythm such as electrical or chemical cardioversion. * Persistent atrial fibrillation lasts for greater than 7 days. The term persistent is used when there is a plan to use a rhythm control strategy and return the patient to sinus rhythm. * Permanent atrial fibrillation is present when atrial fibrillation is present 100% of the time for greater than 7 days and there are no interventions planned to restore sinus rhythm. * Typical Atrial Flutter (Common, or Type | Atrial Flutter) * Involves the IVC(Idioventricular Rhythm) & tricuspid isthmus in the reentry circuit.

        "exp": "Left-to-right shunts occur in all types of atrial and ventricular septal defects but generally do not result in cyanosis, whereas large right-to-left shunts frequently do. The magnitude of the shunt depends on the size of the defect, the diastolic propeies of both ventricles, and the relative impedance of the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Defects of the sinus venosus type occur high in the atrial septum near the entry of the superior vena cava or lower near the orifice of the inferior vena cava and may be associated with the anomalous connection of the right inferior pulmonary vein to the right atrium. In the case of anomalous origin of the left coronary aery from the pulmonary aery, as pulmonary vascular resistance declines immediately after bih, perfusion of the left coronary aery from the pulmonary trunk ceases and the direction of flow in the anomalous vessel reverses. Twenty percent of patients with this defect can survive to adulthood because of myocardial blood supply flowing totally through the right coronary aery. In the absence of pulmonary hypeension, blood will flow from the aoa to the pulmonary aery throughout the cardiac cycle, resulting in a \"continuous\" murmur at the left sternal border. In total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, all the venous blood returns to the right atrium; therefore, an interatrial communication is required and right-to-left shunts with cyanosis are common.

        "exp": "Bundle branch block Damage to the right or left bundle branch of the conducting system can occur as a result of many pathologies, including ischaemic hea disease, hypeensive hea disease and cardiomyopathy. However, right bundle branch block (RBBB) can occur as a normal variant in healthy individuals . In left bundle branch block (LBBB) and RBBB, depolarisation proceeds through a slow myocardial route in the affected ventricle rather than through the rapidly conducting Purkinje tissues that constitute the bundle branches. This causes delayed conduction into the LV or RV, broadens the QRS complex (>=0.12 sec) and produces characteristic alterations in QRS morphology loss of consciousness that occurs without warning and results in collapse. A brief anoxic seizure (due to cerebral ischaemia) may occur if there is prolonged asystole. There is pallor and a death-like appearance during the attack, but when the hea stas beating again there is a characteristic flush. In distinction to epilepsy, recovery is rapid. Sinoatrial disease and neurocardiogenic syncope may cause similar symptoms. Management This depends on the clinical circumstances. Acute inferior MI is often complicated by transient AV block because the right coronary aery (RCA) supplies the AV node. There is usually a reliable escape rhythm and, if the patient remains well, no treatment is required. Symptomatic second- or third-degree AV block may respond to atropine (0.6 mg IV, repeated as necessary) or, if this fails, a temporary pacemaker. In most cases, the AV block will resolve within 7-10 days. Second- or third-degree AV hea block complicating acute anterior MI indicates extensive ventricular damage involving both bundle branches and carries a poor prognosis. Asystole may ensue and a temporary pacemaker should be inseed promptly. If the patient presents with asystole, intravenous atropine (3 mg) or intravenous isoprenaline (2 mg in 500 mL 5% dextrose, infused at 10-60 mL/hr) may help to maintain the circulation until a temporary pacing electrode can be inseed. Temporary pacing can provide effective rhythm suppo in the sho term. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1536",

        "question": "CCF is associated with Increase in all of the following except-'",
        "exp": "Right-sided hea failure is often caused by pulmonary hea disease (cor pulmonale), which is typically caused by difficulties of the pulmonary circulation, such as pulmonary hypeension or pulmonic stenosis. Physical examination may reveal pitting peripheral edema, ascites, liver enlargement, and spleen enlargement. Jugular venous pressure is frequently assessed as a marker of fluid status, which can be accentuated by eliciting hepatojugular reflux. If the right ventricular pressure is increased, a parasternal heave may be present, signifying the compensatory increase in contraction strength. Backward failure of the right ventricle leads to congestion of systemic capillaries. This generates excess fluid accumulation in the body. This causes swelling under the skin (termed peripheral edema or anasarca) and usually affects the dependent pas of the body first (causing foot and ankle swelling in people who are standing up, and sacral edema in people who are predominantly lying down). Nocturia (frequent nighttime urination) may occur when fluid from the legs is returned to the bloodstream while lying down at night. In progressively severe cases, ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity causing swelling) and liver enlargement may develop. Significant liver congestion may result in impaired liver function (congestive hepatopathy), and jaundice and even coagulopathy (problems of decreased or increased blood clotting) may occur. Biventricular failure Edit Dullness of the lung fields to finger percussion and reduced breath sounds at the bases of the lung may suggest the development of a pleural effusion (fluid collection between the lung and the chest wall). Though it can occur in isolated left- or right-sided hea failure, it is more common in biventricular failure because pleural veins drain into both the systemic and pulmonary venous systems. When unilateral, effusions are often right sided. If a person with a failure of one ventricle lives long enough, it will tend to progress to failure of both ventricles. For example, left ventricular failure allows pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypeension to occur, which increase stress on the right ventricle. Right ventricular failure is not as deleterious to the other side, but neither is it harmless. Hea failure symptoms are traditionally and somewhat arbitrarily divided into \"left\" and \"right\" sided, recognizing that the left and right ventricles of the hea supply different poions of the circulation. However, hea failure is not exclusively backward failure (in the pa of the circulation which drains to the ventricle). There are several other exceptions to a simple left-right division of hea failure symptoms. Additionally, the most common cause of right-sided hea failure is left-sided hea failure. The result is that people commonly present with both sets of signs and symptoms. Left-sided failure Edit The left side of the hea receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it forward to the systemic circulation (the rest of the body except for the pulmonary circulation). Failure of the left side of the hea causes blood to back up (be congested) into the lungs, causing respiratory symptoms as well as fatigue due to insufficient supply of oxygenated blood. Common respiratory signs are increased rate of breathing and increased work of breathing (non-specific signs of respiratory distress). Rales or crackles, heard initially in the lung bases, and when severe, throughout the lung fields suggest the development of pulmonary edema (fluid in the alveoli). Cyanosis which suggests severe low blood oxygen, is a late sign of extremely severe pulmonary edema. Additional signs indicating left ventricular failure include a laterally displaced apex beat (which occurs if the hea is enlarged) and a gallop rhythm (additional hea sounds) may be heard as a marker of increased blood flow or increased intra-cardiac pressure. Hea murmurs may indicate the presence of valvular hea disease, either as a cause (e.g. aoic stenosis) or as a result (e.g. mitral regurgitation) of the hea failure. Backward failure of the left ventricle causes congestion of the lungs' blood vessels, and so the symptoms are predominantly respiratory in nature. Backward failure can be subdivided into the failure of the left atrium, the left ventricle or both within the left circuit. The person will have dyspnea (shoness of breath) on exeion and in severe cases, dyspnea at rest. Increasing breathlessness on lying flat, called ohopnea, occurs. It is often measured in the number of pillows required to lie comfoably, and in ohopnea, the person may reso to sleeping while sitting up. Another symptom of hea failure is paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea: a sudden nighttime attack of severe breathlessness, usually several hours after going to sleep. Easy fatigability and exercise intolerance are also common complaints related to respiratory compromise. \"Cardiac asthma\" or wheezing may occur. Compromise of left ventricular forward function may result in symptoms of poor systemic circulation such as dizziness, confusion and cool extremities at rest There is mounting evidence that chronic kidney disease itself is a major contributor to severe cardiac damage and, conversely, that congestive hea failure is a major cause of progressive chronic kidney disease. .

An electrocardiogram (ECG) is routinely done on people with chest pain to quickly diagnose myocardial infarctions (hea attacks), an impoant differential diagnosis in an individual with chest pain. While ceain ECG changes may occur with PE, none are specific enough to confirm or sensitive enough to rule out the diagnosis. An ECG may show signs of right hea strain or acute cor pulmonale in cases of large PEs -- the classic signs are a large S wave in lead I, a large Q wave in lead III, and an inveed T wave in lead III (S1Q3T3), which occurs in 12-50% of people with the diagnosis, yet also occurs in 12% without the diagnosis. This is occasionally present (occurring in up to 20% of people), but may also occur in other acute lung conditions, and, therefore, has limited diagnostic value. The most commonly seen signs in the ECG are sinus tachycardia, right axis detion, and right bundle branch block.Sinus tachycardia, however, is still only found in 8-69% of people with PE. ECG findings associated with pulmonary emboli may suggest worse prognosis since the six findings identified with RV strain on ECG (hea rate > 100 beats per minute, S1Q3T3, inveed T waves in leads V1-V4, ST elevation in aVR, complete right bundle branch block, and atrial fibrillation) are associated with increased risk of circulatory shock and death. Cases with inveed T in leads V1-3 are suspected with PE or inferior myocardial infarction.

The host is also primed for a secondary antibody response when viral antigens are released and immune complexes lead to activation of the classic complement pathway, with consequent phlogistic effects. Cross-reactivity at the T cell level results in the release of physiologically active cytokines, including interferon g and tumor necrosis factor a. The induction of vascular permeability and shock depends on multiple factors, Dengue HF is identified by the detection of bleeding tendencies (tourniquet test, petechiae) or ove bleeding in the absence of underlying causes such as preexisting lesions. Dengue shock syndrome, usually accompanied by hemorrhagic signs, is much more serious and results from increased vascular permeability leading to shock. In mild DHF/DSS, restlessness, lethargy, thrombocytopenia (<100,000/mL), and hemoconcentration are detected 2-5 days after the onset of typical dengue fever, usually at the time of defervescence. The maculopapular rash that often develops in dengue fever may also appear in DHF/DSS. In more severe cases, frank shock is apparent, with low pulse pressure, cyanosis, hepatomegaly, pleural effusions, ascites, and in some cases severe ecchymoses and gastrointestinal bleeding. The period of shock lasts only 1 or 2 days, and most patients respond promptly to close monitoring, oxygen administration, and infusion of crystalloid or--in severe cases--colloid. ref:harrison&;s principles of internal medicine,ed 18,pg no 1913",

Risk factors include alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, psychological stress, and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome which often is inherited from a person's parents.

Diagnosis is typically by an electrocardiogram (ECG) which shows narrow QRS complexes and a fast hea rhythm typically between 150 and 240 beats per minute. Vagal maneuvers, such as the Valsalva maneuver, are often used as the initial treatment.If not effective and the person has a normal blood pressure the medication adenosine may be tried.If adenosine is not effective a calcium channel blockers or beta blocker may be used.[Otherwise synchronized cardioversion is the treatment. Future episodes can be prevented by catheter ablation.

Most commonly used during open hea procedures, if the patient&;s status warrants it, TEE can be used in the setting of any operation. TEE is very useful during many cardiac surgical procedures (e.g., mitral valve repair). It is actually an essential monitoring tool during this procedure. It helps to detect and quantify the disease preoperatively as well as to assess the results of surgery immediately after the procedure. If the repair is found to be inadequate, showing significant residual regurgitation, the surgeon can decide whether to go back to cardiopulmonary bypass to try to correct the defect. Aoic dissections are another impoant condition where TEE is very helpful. TEE can also help the surgeon during the inseion of a catheter for retrograde cardioplegia.

Then, when cardiac muscle relaxes, the energy captured by compressed elements releases, driving the recoil of ventricular wall until a new balanced equilibrium state is reached. During diastole, the ventricle of hea must remain elastic or compliant enough and have capacity to hold incoming blood to guarantee effectiveness of the filling phase.

Progressive mechanical obstruction - either rapidly advancing coronary atherosclerosis or restenosis following percutaneous coronary intervention. 3. Increased discrepancy between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. Management Immediately assess the following: * Clinical evaluation - history and physical examination * 12 - lead ECG recording * Measurement of cardiac specific markers - troponin and CK-MB. All ACS patients should be placed on aspirin, b-blocker, nitrate and clopidogrel immediately. Low risk patients - On observation if the patient remains pain-free with normal ECG and normal levels of cardiac markers, submit them for stress ECG.

These stents have lower rates of restenosis. They act by inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia (antiproliferative action). 16. Assessment of ischaemic burden: A sub-maximal stress testing is done at the end of first week and a maximal exercise stress test at the end of 6 weeks. Stress testing aids in assessing the patient's ischaemic burden and planning fuher line of management. 17.

However, this has been shown to cause little, if any, of the sound, because the blood between the leaflets cushions the slapping effect and prevents significant sound. Instead, the cause is vibration of the taut valves immediately after closure, along with vibration of the adjacent walls of the hea and major vessels around the hea. That is, in generating the first hea sound, contraction of the ventricles first causes sudden backflow of blood against the A-V valves (the tricuspid and mitral valves), causing them to close and bulge toward the atria until the chordae tendineae abruptly stop the back bulging. Myocardial inflammation may affect electrical conduction pathways, leading to P-R interval prolongation (firstdegree AV block or rarely higher-level block) and softening of the first hea sound.

        "exp": "Davidsons Principles and practice of medicine_22Edition page no 623-624 Aoic regurgitation Aetiology and pathophysiology This condition is due to disease of the aoic valve cusps or dilatation of the aoic root (Box 18.109). The LV dilates and hyperophies to compensate for the regurgitation. The stroke volume of the LV may eventually be doubled or trebled, and the major aeries are then conspicuously pulsatile. As the disease progresses, left ventricular diastolic pressure rises and breathlessness develops. Clinical features Until the onset of breathlessness, the only symptom may be an awareness of the hea beat . paicularly when lying on the left side, which results from the increased stroke volume. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea is sometimes the first symptom, and peripheral oedema or angina may occur. The characteristic murmur is best heard to the left of the sternum during held expiration. a thrill is rare. A systolic murmur due to the increased stroke volume is common and does not necessarily indicate stenosis. The regurgitant jet causes fluttering of the mitral valve and, if severe, causes paial closure of the anterior mitral leaflet, leading to functional mitral stenosis and a soft mid-diastolic (Austin Flint) murmur. In acute severe regurgitation (e.g. perforation of aoic cusp in endocarditis), there may be no time for compensatory left ventricular hyperophy and dilatation to develop and the features of hea failure may predominate. In this situation, the classical signs of aoic regurgitation may be masked by tachycardia and an abrupt rise in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure; thus, the pulse pressure may be near normal and the diastolic murmur may be sho or even absent. Investigations Regurgitation is detected by Doppler echocardiography . In severe acute aoic regurgitation, the rapid rise in left ventricular diastolic pressure may cause premature mitral valve closure. Cardiac catheterisation and aoography can help in assessing the severity of regurgitation, and dilatation of the aoa and the presence of coexisting coronary aery disease. MRI is useful in assessing the degree and extent of aoic dilatation. Management Treatment may be required for underlying conditions, such as endocarditis or syphilis. Aoic valve replacement is indicated if aoic regurgitation causes symptoms, and this may need to be combined with aoic root replacement and coronary bypass surgery. Those with chronic aoic regurgitation can remain asymptomatic for many years because compensatory ventricular dilatation and hyperophy occur, but should be advised to repo the development of any symptoms of breathlessness or angina. Asymptomatic patients should also be followed up annually with echocardiography for evidence of increasing ventricular size. If this occurs or if the end-systolic dimension increases to 55 mm or more, then aoic valve replacement should be undeaken. Systolic BP should be controlled with vasodilating drugs, such as nifedipine or ACE inhibitors. There is conflicting evidence regarding the need for aoic valve replacement in asymptomatic patients with severe aoic regurgitation. When aoic root dilatation is the cause of aoic regurgitation (e.g. Marfan's syndrome), aoic root replacement is usually necessary. <img alt=\"\" src=\" />",

Therefore, elevated filling pressures are frequently required to maintain adequate ventricular performance.

Surgery (coronary angioplasty, coronary aery bypass grafting) if medical management fails or if there is severe compromise of coronary circulation. 15. Drug eluting stents - Many drugs have been considered for drug eluting stents. The main drugs used are paclitaxel (Taxol), sirolimus and their derivatives (tacrolimus, everolimus). These stents have lower rates of restenosis. They act by inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia (antiproliferative action). 16. Assessment of ischaemic burden: A sub-maximal stress testing is done at the end of first week and a maximal exercise stress test at the end of 6 weeks. Stress testing aids in assessing the patient's ischaemic burden and planning fuher line of management. 17.

        "question": "In CCF there Is-",
        "exp": "Hea failure symptoms are traditionally and somewhat arbitrarily divided into \"left\" and \"right\" sided, recognizing that the left and right ventricles of the hea supply different poions of the circulation. However, hea failure is not exclusively backward failure (in the pa of the circulation which drains to the ventricle). There are several other exceptions to a simple left-right division of hea failure symptoms. Additionally, the most common cause of right-sided hea failure is left-sided hea failure. The result is that people commonly present with both sets of signs and symptoms. Left-sided failure The left side of the hea receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it forward to the systemic circulation (the rest of the body except for the pulmonary circulation). Failure of the left side of the hea causes blood to back up (be congested) into the lungs, causing respiratory symptoms as well as fatigue due to insufficient supply of oxygenated blood. Common respiratory signs are increased rate of breathing and increased work of breathing (non-specific signs of respiratory distress). Rales or crackles, heard initially in the lung bases, and when severe, throughout the lung fields suggest the development of pulmonary edema (fluid in the alveoli). Cyanosis which suggests severe low blood oxygen, is a late sign of extremely severe pulmonary edema. Additional signs indicating left ventricular failure include a laterally displaced apex beat (which occurs if the hea is enlarged) and a gallop rhythm (additional hea sounds) may be heard as a marker of increased blood flow or increased intra-cardiac pressure. Hea murmurs may indicate the presence of valvular hea disease, either as a cause (e.g. aoic stenosis) or as a result (e.g. mitral regurgitation) of the hea failure. Backward failure of the left ventricle causes congestion of the lungs' blood vessels, and so the symptoms are predominantly respiratory in nature. Backward failure can be subdivided into the failure of the left atrium, the left ventricle or both within the left circuit. The person will have dyspnea (shoness of breath) on exeion and in severe cases, dyspnea at rest. Increasing breathlessness on lying flat, called ohopnea, occurs. It is often measured in the number of pillows required to lie comfoably, and in ohopnea, the person may reso to sleeping while sitting up. Another symptom of hea failure is paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea: a sudden nighttime attack of severe breathlessness, usually several hours after going to sleep. Easy fatigability and exercise intolerance are also common complaints related to respiratory compromise. \"Cardiac asthma\" or wheezing may occur. Compromise of left ventricular forward function may result in symptoms of poor systemic circulation such as dizziness, confusion and cool extremities at rest Right-sided hea failure is often caused by pulmonary hea disease (cor pulmonale), which is typically caused by difficulties of the pulmonary circulation, such as pulmonary hypeension or pulmonic stenosis. Physical examination may reveal pitting peripheral edema, ascites, liver enlargement, and spleen enlargement. Jugular venous pressure is frequently assessed as a marker of fluid status, which can be accentuated by eliciting hepatojugular reflux. If the right ventricular pressure is increased, a parasternal heave may be present, signifying the compensatory increase in contraction strength. Backward failure of the right ventricle leads to congestion of systemic capillaries. This generates excess fluid accumulation in the body. This causes swelling under the skin (termed peripheral edema or anasarca) and usually affects the dependent pas of the body first (causing foot and ankle swelling in people who are standing up, and sacral edema in people who are predominantly lying down). Nocturia (frequent nighttime urination) may occur when fluid from the legs is returned to the bloodstream while lying down at night. In progressively severe cases, ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity causing swelling) and liver enlargement may develop. Significant liver congestion may result in impaired liver function (congestive hepatopathy), and jaundice and even coagulopathy (problems of decreased or increased blood clotting) may occur. Biventricular failure Dullness of the lung fields to finger percussion and reduced breath sounds at the bases of the lung may suggest the development of a pleural effusion (fluid collection between the lung and the chest wall). Though it can occur in isolated left- or right-sided hea failure, it is more common in biventricular failure because pleural veins drain into both the systemic and pulmonary venous systems. When unilateral, effusions are often right sided. If a person with a failure of one ventricle lives long enough, it will tend to progress to failure of both ventricles. For example, left ventricular failure allows pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypeension to occur, which increase stress on the right ventricle. Right ventricular failure is not as deleterious to the other side, but neither is it harmless. There is mounting evidence that chronic kidney disease itself is a major contributor to severe cardiac damage and, conversely, that congestive hea failure is a major cause of progressive chronic kidney disease(oligouria).. The anemia is associated with worsening cardiac and renal status and often with signs of malnutrition Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 478",

Pulsus paradoxus is measured by noting the difference between the systolic pressure at which the Korotkoff sounds are first heard (during expiration) and the systolic pressure at which the Korotkoff sounds are heard with each heabeat, independent of the respiratory phase. Between these two pressures, the Korotkoff sounds are heard only intermittently and during expiration. The cuff pressure must be decreased slowly to appreciate the finding. It can be difficult to measure pulsus paradoxus in patients with tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or tachypnea. A pulsus paradoxus may be palpable at the brachial aery or femoral aery level when the pressure difference exceeds 15 mmHg.

        "exp": "WPW is commonly diagnosed on the basis of the electrocardiogram in an asymptomatic individual. In this case, it is manifested as a delta wave, which is a slurred upstroke in the QRS complex that is associated with a sho PR interval. The sho PR interval and slurring of the QRS complex are reflective of the impulse making it to the ventricles early ( the accessory pathway) without the usual delay experienced in the AV node. If a person with WPW experiences episodes of atrial fibrillation, the ECG shows a rapid polymorphic wide-complex tachycardia (without torsades de pointes). This combination of atrial fibrillation and WPW is considered dangerous, and most antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1546 When an individual is in normal sinus rhythm, the ECG characteristics of WPW are a sho PR interval (less than 120 milliseconds in duration), widened QRS complex (greater than 120 milliseconds in duration) with slurred upstroke of the QRS complex, and secondary repolarization changes (reflected in ST segment-T wave changes). In individuals with WPW, electrical activity that is initiated in the SA node travels through the accessory pathway, as well as through the AV node to activate the ventricles both pathways. Since the accessory pathway does not have the impulse slowing propeies of the AV node, the electrical impulse first activates the ventricles the accessory pathway, and immediately afterwards the AV node. This gives the sho PR interval and slurred upstroke of the QRS complex known as the delta wave. In case of type A pre-excitation (left atrioventricular connections), a positive R wave is seen in V1 (\"positive delta\") on the precordial leads of the electrocardiogram, while in type B pre-excitation (right atrioventricular connections), a predominantly negative delta wave is seen in lead V1 (\"negative delta\" Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 468",

        "exp": "PVC prevalence increases with age Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are extra heabeats that begin in one of your hea's two lower pumping chambers (ventricles). These extra beats disrupt your regular hea rhythm, sometimes causing you to feel a fluttering or a skipped beat in your chest If PVCs are frequent or troublesome, medication (beta blockers or ceain calcium channel blockers) may be used. Very frequent PVCs in people with dilated cardiomyopathy may be treated with radiofrequency ablation Although there are many possible symptoms associated with PVCs, PVCs may also have no symptoms at all. PVCs may be perceived as a skipped hea beat, a strong beat, palpitations, lightheadedness. They may also cause chest pain, a faint feeling, fatigue, or hyperventilation after exercise.Symptoms may be more pronounced at times of stress. Women may be more aware of PVCs at the time of the menstrual period. Premature ventricular contractions may be associated with underlying hea disease, and ceain characteristics are therefore elicited routinely: the presence of signs of hea disease or a known history of hea disease (e.g. previous myocardial infarction), as well as hea disease or sudden cardiac death in close relatives. PVCs and palpitation associated with syncope (transient loss of consciousness) or provoked by exeion are also concerning. Physical examination is focused on identifying evidence of underlying hea disease Premature ventricular contractions can occur in a healthy person of any age, but are more prevalent in the elderly and in men. In a very significant propoion of people they occur spontaneously with no known cause. Some possible underlying causes of PVCs include: Adrenaline excess High blood calcium Cardiomyopathy, hyperophic or dilated Ceain medicines such as digoxin, which increases hea contraction or tricyclic antidepressants Chemical (electrolyte) problems in the blood Contact with the carina (trachea/bronchi) when performing medical suctioning stimulates vagus nerve Drugs such as: Alcohol Caffeine Cocaine Theobromin Myocardial infarction Hypercapnia (CO2 poisoning) Hypeension (high blood pressure) Hypokalemia--low blood levels of potassium.

During expiration, the pulmonic valve closes at nearly the same time as the aoic, and splitting of S2 cannot be heard Exercise increases the intensity of both the aoic and pulmonic components of S2, whereas deep inspiration increases the intensity of the pulmonic component only.

The main indications for digoxin in atrial fibrillation are restoration of sinus rhythm, prevention of recurrence and slowing of the ventricular rate Other common dysrhythmias associated with digoxin toxicity include: Frequent PVCs (the most common abnormality), including ventricular bigeminy and trigeminy. Regularised AF = AF with complete hea block and a junctional or ventricular escape rhythm. Ventricular tachycardia, including polymorphic and bidirectional VT Adenosine can, at times, terminate the rhythm, but not always. Ablation of atrial tachycardia is also an option, especially when medical therapy fails.

Symptoms typically include those of cardiogenic shock including shoness of breath, weakness, lightheadedness, and cough. Other s relate to the underlying cause Cardiac tamponade is caused by a large or uncontrolled pericardial effusion, i.e. the buildup of fluid inside the pericardium.This commonly occurs as a result of chest trauma (both blunt and penetrating), but can also be caused by myocardial rupture, cancer, uremia, pericarditis, or cardiac surgery, and rarely occurs during retrograde aoic dissection,or while the person is taking anticoagulant therapy.The effusion can occur rapidly (as in the case of trauma or myocardial rupture), or over a more gradual period of time (as in cancer). The fluid involved is often blood, but pus is also found in some circumstances. Causes of increased pericardial effusion include hypothyroidism, physical trauma (either penetrating trauma involving the pericardium or blunt chest trauma), pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium), iatrogenic trauma (during an invasive procedure), and myocardial rupture. Surgery One of the most common settings for cardiac tamponade is in the first 24 to 48 hours after hea surgery. After hea surgery, chest tubes are placed to drain blood. These chest tubes, however, are prone to clot formation. When a chest tube becomes occluded or clogged, the blood that should be drained can accumulate around the hea, leading to tamponade Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 460",
