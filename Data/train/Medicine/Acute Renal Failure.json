Contrast nephropathy leads to a rise in serum creatinine within 24-48 hours, peak within 3-5 days, and resolution within 5-7 days. 'Contrast nephropathy leads to a rise in sent in creatinine within 24-48 hours, peak within 3-5 days, and resolution within 5-7 days. - Harrison 18/e p2298. Contrast Nephropathylodinated contrast agents used for cardiovascular and CT imaging are a leading cause of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury). The risk of AKI, or 'contrast nephropathy, ' is negligible in those with normal renal function but increases markedly in the setting of chronic kidney disease, particularly diabetic nephropathyQ. The most common clinical course of contrast nephropathy is characterized by a rise in SCr beginning 24-48 hours following exposure, peaking within 3-5 days, and resolving within 1 weekQ. More severe, dialysis-requiring AKI is uncommon except in the setting of significant preexisting chronic kidney disease, often in association with congestive heart failure or other coexisting causes for ischemia-associated AKI. Patients with multiple myeloma and renal disease are particularly susceptibleQ. Low fractional excretion of sodium and relatively benign urinary sediment without features of tubular necrosis are common findings. Contrast nephropathy is thought to occur from a combination of factors1. Hypoxia in the renal outer medulla due to perturbations in renal microcirculation and occlusion of small vessels. Q2. Cytotoxic damage to the tubules directly or via the generation of oxygen free radicalsQ, especially since the concentration of the agent within the tubule is markedly increased3. Transient tubule obstruction with precipitated contrast materialQ",
