When the concentration of LDH-1 is observed to be greater than LDH2. It is referred to as flipped LDH and is indicative of Myocardial infarction. LDH has five isoenzymes: LDH-1 LDH-1 is found primarily in heart muscle 17% to 27% LDH-2 LDH-2 is primarily found in Red blood cells 27% to 37% LDH-3 LDH-3 is highest in the lung 18% to 25% LDH-4 LDH-4 is highest in the kidney, placenta, and pancreas 3% to 8% LDH-5 LDH-5 is highest in the liver and skeletal muscle 0% to 5% The LDH test helps determine the location of tissue damage.

        "exp": "Even severe AS may exist for many years without producing any symptoms because of the ability of the hyperophied LV to generate the elevated intraventricular pressures required to maintain a normal stroke volume. Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exeional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

Pathophysiology 1. Cross reactivity of host antistreptococcal antibodies to cardiac antigens 2. Microbe initiated autoimmune reactivity. Jones Criteria for Diagnosis of Rheumatic Fever Major Criteria Carditis Pancarditis, seen in 50-60% of patients, develops within the first 2 weeks of rheumatic fever. Pericarditis is evidenced by presence of a pericardial rub, myocarditis by tachycardia, soft S1, presence of S3 and CCF and endocarditis by the presence of Carey-Coombs' murmur (mitral diastolic murmur). Ahritis (60-75%) Flitting and fleeting type of polyahritis involving large joints with no residual deformity is seen in 60-75% of patients and occurs early in rheumatic fever. Jaccod's ahritis: Ulnar detion of 4th and 5th finger with flexion at metacarpophalangeal joints is the only residual deformity seen in rheumatic polyahritis. Subcutaneous Nodules Non-tender nodules are seen over bony prominences like elbows, shin, occiput, spine in 3-5% of patients and occur 3-6 weeks after onset of rheumatic fever. Patients who have subcutaneous nodules almost always have carditis. Erythema Marginatum (< 5% and evanescent) Macular lesions with an erythematous rim and central clearing in a bathing suit distribution are seen in < 5% of patients and occur early in rheumatic fever. Chorea (Sydenham's Chorea) (2-30%) A neurological disorder with rapid, involuntary and purposeless non-repetitive movements with a self limiting course of 2-6 weeks is more common in females and is a late manifestation of rheumatic fever. Minor Criteria Clinical 1. Fever 2. Ahralgia 3. Previous history of rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease. Laboratory 1. Acute phase reactants (leucocytosis, raised ESR, C-reactive protein) 2. Prolonged PR interval in ECG (> 0. 2 sec). WHO Criteria Jones major and pa of the minor criteria except prior history of rheumatic fever/rheumatic heart disease and C-reactive protein. Essential Criteria Evidence for recent streptococcal infection as evidenced by: 1. Increase in ASO titre a. > 333 Todd units (in children) b. > 250 Todd units (in adults). 2. Positive throat culture for streptococcal infection. 3. Recent history of scarlet fever. Two major (or) one major and two minor criteria, in the presence of essential criteria, is required to diagnose Acute Rheumatic Fever. A Positive Rheumatic Fever history is usually elicited in only 50% of patient with Rheumatic Heart Disease. Valve Involvement in Rheumatic Heart Disease Mitral valve alone 50% Aoic valve alone 15-20% Mitral and Aoic valves together 35-40% Mitral, Aoic and Tricuspid valves 2-3% Pulmonary valve is viually never involved. In RHD, mitral valve is most commonly involved followed by involvement of the aoic valve as the pressure gradient across the mitral valve is the greatest, followed by that across the aoic valve. So, the mitral valve is more susceptible to develop pathological changes than the aoic valve.",

        "exp": "Ventricular tachycardia can be classified based on its morphology: Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia means that the appearance of all the beats match each other in each lead of a surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Scar-related monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is the most common type and a frequent cause of death in patients having survived a heart attack, especially if they have weak heart muscle. RVOT tachycardia is a type of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia originating in the right ventricular outflow tract. RVOT morphology refers to the characteristic pattern of this type of tachycardia on an ECG. The source of the re-entry circuit can be identified by evaluating the morphology of the QRS complex in the V1 lead of a surface ECG. If the R wave is dominant (consistent with a right bundle branch block morphology), this indicates the origin of the VT is the left ventricle. Conversely, if the S wave is dominant (consistent with a left bundle branch block morphology, this is consistent with VT originating from the right ventricle or interventricular septum. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, on the other hand, has beat-to-beat variations in morphology. This may appear as a cyclical progressive change in cardiac axis, previously referred to by its French name torsades de pointes (\"twisting of the spikes\"). However, at the current time, the term torsades de pointes is reserved for polymorphic VT occurring in the context of a prolonged resting QT interval. Another way to classify ventricular tachycardias is the duration of the episodes: Three or more beats in a row on an ECG that originate from the ventricle at a rate of more than 120 beats per minute constitute a ventricular tachycardia Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1423",

In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e. g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e. g., captopril (6. 25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e. g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias.",

Maturation disorders are divided into two categories: nuclear maturation defects, associated with macrocytosis, and cytoplasmic maturation defects, associated with microcytosis and hypochromia usually from defects in hemoglobin synthesis. Nuclear maturation defects result from vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency, drug damage, or myelodysplasia. Cytoplasmic maturation defects result from a severe iron deficiency or abnormalities in globin or heme synthesis. Acquired abnormalities are usually associated with myelodysplasia, may lead to either a macro- or microcytic anemia, and are frequently associated with mitochondrial iron loading. In these cases, iron is taken up by the mitochondria of the developing erythroid cell but not incorporated into heme. The iron-encrusted mitochondria surround the nucleus of the erythroid cell, forming a ring. Based on the distinctive finding of so-called ringed sideroblasts on the marrow iron stain, patients are diagnosed as having a sideroblastic anemia--almost always reflecting myelodysplasia. Ceain medications, such as isoniazid, L-dopa, penicillamine, and cycloserine, interact with PLP due to a reaction with carbonyl groups.

With aoic regurgitation, the incisura diminished as the severity of regurgitation increased. With calcific aoic stenosis, the incisura was smaller or absent. These observations imply a valve mechanism productive of the incisura. In vitro studies of human aoic valves confirmed these observations. Additional in vitro studies with high speed cinematography (2, 000 frames/sec) of a stented normal porcine valve also showed that early diastolic stretch and recoil of the leaflets occurs. These results indicate that in the presence of a normal or diseased aoic valve the aoic incisura is produced primarily by valve distension or recoil, respectively. Distension and rebound of the aoic walls do not appear to contribute significantly in the presence of a normal or a diseased valve. Because acquired aoic valve disease affects the magnitude of the central aoic incisura, inspection of the incisura may be of ancillary valve in evaluating the pathologic state of the aoic valve.

Continuous exposure to nitroglycerin through use of a transdermal skin patch has frequently caused nitrate tolerance. A daily 10-to-14-hour drug-free period will prevent nitrate tolerance. Nitrate tolerance is a cellular tolerance caused by depletion of sulfhydryl groups required for receptor signal transduction. The drug-free interval allows time for these groups to replenish before the next period of drug exposure. Nitrates are metabolized by hepatic nitroreductase, and there is neither evidence of cytochrome P 450 involvement nor of induction of this enzyme by drugs. Although the patient's symptoms could be caused by increased physical activity or onset of vasospasm, these are less likely causes in a patient with continuous nitroglycerin exposure.

The bicycle ergometer or the treadmill is currently used for most exercise testing programs. There are various exercise protocols such as the Bruce protocol or the Naughton protocol to assess effo tolerance. In all these protocols the subject is made to exercise in stages of increasing workloads until the end points are achieved. During exercise, various parameters like occurrence of symptoms, fluctuations in blood pressure changes in the ST segment, and changes in cardiac rate and rhythm are closely monitored. Although the stress test is fairly safe, it has to be done only under close medical supervision. Currently the main indications for stress testing are: 1. As a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of symptoms like effo induced chest pain, or palpitation. 2. To assess the prognosis and in the risk stratification of patients with coronary aery disease, either after acute events like myocardial infarction or angina, or after therapeutic interventions like coronary angioplasty or by pass surgery. 3. To assess the functional capacity in patients with ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy and patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 4. As a screening test for ischemic heart disease in subjects with an intermediate or high probability for the disease. The test is considered positive if there is flat or down sloping ST segment depression of 1 mm or more, ST segment elevation, inversion of U waves, fall in blood pressure and ischemic symptoms associated with ECG changes. Standard contraindications to exercise testing include acute myocardial infarction, high risk unstable angina pectoris, severe aoic stenosis, congestive cardiac failure, acute pulmonary embolism or infarction, acute myocarditis or pericarditis, aoic dissection, uncontrolled severe systemic hypertension > 200/100 mm Hg, high grade heart blocks, uncontrolled symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias, any acute systemic illness or an unwilling patient. The indications to terminate exercise testing includes inappropriate drop in blood pressure or deceleration of the heart rate with increasing workload and exercise, moderate to severe angina, sustained VT, ST depression more than 3 mm or ST elevation in non Q leads, hypeensive response > 250/115 mm Hg, patient exhaustion, fatigue, leg cramps or claudication pain and subject's desire to stop the test.

ST elevation in two contiguous leads or new LBBB) and appropriateness of reperfusion therapy, which reduces infarct size, LV dysfunction, and moality. * Primary PCI is generally more effective than fibrinolysis and is preferred at experienced centers capable of performing procedure rapidly, especially when diagnosis is in doubt, cardiogenic shock is present, bleeding risk is increased, or if symptoms have been present for \u00013 h. * Proceed with IV fibrinolysis if PCI is not available or if logistics would delay PCI \u00011 h longer than fibrinolysis could be initiated (Fig. 123-1). Dooo- needle time should be \u0005 30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK; maintain a. PTTT at 1. 5-2. 0 control (\u000150-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists \u000190 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI.

In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop; (2) nitroglycerin 0. 3 mg SL if systolic bp \u0001 100 mm. Hg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation \u0001 90%). * Mild sedation (e. g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e. g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypertension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp \u0005 95 mm. Hg, heart rate \u0005 50 beats/min, AV block, or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e. g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e. g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e. g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e. g., captopril (6. 25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e. g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias.",

        "exp": "bilateral upper limb pulseless disease is caused by aooaeritis Takayasu's aeritis (also known as, \"aoic arch syndrome, \" \"nonspecific aooaeritis, \" and \"pulseless disease) is a form of large vessel granulomatous vasculitis with massive intimal fibrosis and vascular narrowing, most commonly affecting often young or middle-age women of Asian descent, though anyone can be affected. It mainly affects the aoa (the main blood vessel leaving the heart) and its branches, as well as the pulmonary aeries. Females are about 8-9 times more likely to be affected than males. Those with the disease often notice symptoms between 15 and 30 years of age. In the Western world, atherosclerosis is a more frequent cause of obstruction of the aoic arch vessels than Takayasu's aeritis. Takayasu's aeritis is similar to other forms of vasculitis, including giant cell aeritis which typically affects older individuals. Due to obstruction of the main branches of the aoa, including the left common carotid aery, the brachiocephalic aery, and the left subclan aery, Takayasu's aeritis can present as pulseless upper extremities (arms, hands, and wrists with weak or absent pulses on the physical examination) which may be why it is also commonly referred to as the \"pulseless disease. \" Involvement of renal aeries may lead to a presentation of renovascular hypertension.

Specifically, the damaged pa of a heart valve forms a local blood clot, a condition known as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). The platelet and fibrin deposits that form as pa of the blood clotting process allow bacteria to take hold and form vegetations. As previously mentioned, the body has no direct methods of combating valvular vegetations because the valves do not have a dedicated blood supply. This combination of damaged valves, bacterial growth, and lack of a strong immune response results in infective endocarditis. Damage to the valves and endocardium can be caused by: Altered, turbulent blood flow. The areas that fibrose, clot, or roughen as a result of this altered flow are known as jet lesions. Altered blood flow is more likely in high pressure areas, so ventricular septal defects or patent ductus aeriosus can create more susceptibility than atrial septal defects. Catheters, electrodes, and other intracardiac prosthetic devices. Solid paicles from repeated intravenous injections. Chronic inflammation. Examples include auto-immune mechanisms and degenerative valvular lesions. The risk factors for infective endocarditis provide a more extensive list of conditions that can damage the heart.

        "exp": "A hepatojugular reflux indicates liver congestion caused by the backup of blood into the venous circulation, secondary to problems in the right heart (e. g., right-sided heart failure, tricuspid stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation) An S3 heart sound occurs during the rapid-filling phase of the ventricle in early diastole. In mitral valve incompetence and increased preload in the left ventricle, an S3 heart sound is an excellent indicator of ventricular failure. The increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure is reflected back into the left atrium, with a subsequent increase in the hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary veins. When pulmonary venous pressure is greater than the pulmonary capillary onco tic pressure, a transudate leaks first into the interstitium (Kerley lines on a chest radiograph) and eventually into the alveoli, resulting in pulmonary edema and congestion. Dyspnea, or the sensation of difficult or uncomfoable breathing, is the most common symptom of left sided heart failure. When a patient with left-sided heart failure lies down, the reduced gravitational force increases venous return to the heart. Because the left ventricle cannot handle the increased load, the blood backs up into the lungs, producing dyspnea. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea specifically refers to a choking sensation that wakens the patient at night. It usually subsides) to 20 minutes after the patient stands up, opens the window, and takes deep breaths. Another finding associated with left-sided heart failure is reduced renal perfusion, which occurs during the day due to the decreased cardiac output. Reduced cardiac output decreases the effective aerial blood volume and the glomerular filtration rate, allowing a greater reabsorption of urea in the proximal tubule. Because creatinine is neither reabsorbed nor secreted in the tubules, a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate causes a minor increase in serum creatinine. The dispropoionate increase in the blood urea nitrogen level over that of the serum creatinine is called prerenal azotemia. Ref - Harrison's principles of internal medicine 20e / pubmed. com",

Between these two pressures, the Korotkoff sounds are heard only intermittently and during expiration. The cuff pressure must be decreased slowly to appreciate the finding.

A pulsus paradoxus may be palpable at the brachial aery or femoral aery level when the pressure difference exceeds 15 mm. Hg.

Skin involvement is observed in 80% of patients and includes folliculitis, erythema nodosum, an acne-like exanthem, and, infrequently, vasculitis, Sweet syndrome, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Nonspecific skin inflammatory reactivity to any scratches or intradermal saline injection (pathergy test) is a common and specific manifestation. Eye involvement with scarring and bilateral panuveitis is the most dreaded complication since it occasionally progresses rapidly to blindness. In addition to iritis, posterior uveitis, retinal vessel occlusions, and optic neuritis can be seen in some patients with the syndrome. Nondeforming ahritis or ahralgias are seen in 50% of patients and affect the knees and ankles. Superficial or deep peripheral vein thrombosis is seen in 30% of patients. Aerial involvement occurs in less than 5% of patients and presents with aoitis or peripheral aerial aneurysm and aerial thrombosis. Mucous membrane involvement may respond to topical glucocoicoids in the form of mouthwash or paste. In more serious cases, thalidomide (100 mg/d) is effective. Colchicine can be beneficial for the mucocutaneous manifestations and ahritis. Uveitis and CNS-Behcet's syndrome require systemic glucocoicoid therapy (prednisone, 1mg/kg per day) and azathioprine (2-3 mg/kg per day).

        "question": "All of the following are causes of giant a wave in JVP except-",
        "exp": "Aoic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the narrowing of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aoa begins), such that problems result. It may occur at the aoic valve as well as above and below this level. It typically gets worse over time. Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first. If heart failure, loss of consciousness, or heart related chest pain occur due to AS the outcomes are worse. Loss of consciousness typically occurs with standing or exercise. Signs of heart failure include shoness of breath especially when lying down, at night, or with exercise, and swelling of the legs. Thickening of the valve without narrowing is known as aoic sclerosis. Causes include being born with a bicuspid aoic valve, and rheumatic fever; a normal valve may also harden over the decades. A bicuspid aoic valve affects about one to two percent of the population. As of 2014 rheumatic heart disease mostly occurs in the developing world. Risk factors are similar to those of coronary aery disease and include smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and being male. The aoic valve usually has three leaflets and is located between the left ventricle of the heart, and the aoa. AS typically results in a heart murmur. Its severity can be divided into mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, distinguishable by ultrasound scan of the heart Aoic stenosis is typically followed using repeated ultrasound scans. Once it has become severe, treatment primarily involves valve replacement surgery, with transcatheter aoic valve replacement (TAVR) being an option in some who are at high risk from surgery. Valves may either be mechanical or bioprosthetic, with each having risks and benefits. Another less invasive procedure, balloon aoic valvuloplasty (BAV), may result in benefit, but for only a few months. Complications such as heart failure may be treated in the same way as in those with mild to moderate AS. In those with severe disease a number of medications should be avoided, including ACE inhibitors, nitroglycerin, and some beta blockers. Nitroprusside or phenylephrine may be used in those with decompensated heart failure depending on the blood pressure Aoic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease in the developed world. It affects about 2% of people who are over 65 years of age. Estimated rates were not known in most of the developing world as of 2014. In those who have symptoms, without repair the chance of death at five years is about 50% and at 10 years is about 90%. Symptoms related to aoic stenosis depend on the degree of stenosis. Most people with mild to moderate aoic stenosis do not have symptoms. Symptoms usually present in individuals with severe aoic stenosis, though they may also occur in those with mild to moderate aoic stenosis. The three main symptoms of aoic stenosis are loss of consciousness, anginal chest pain and shoness of breath with activity or other symptoms of heart failure such as shoness of breath while lying flat, episodes of shoness of breath at night, or swollen legs and feet. It may also be accompanied by the characteristic \"Dresden china\" appearance of pallor with a light flush. Angina Angina in setting of heart failure also increases the risk of death. In people with angina, the 5-year moality rate is 50% if the aoic valve is not replaced. Angina in the setting of AS occurs due to left ventricular hyperophy (LVH) that is caused by the constant production of increased pressure required to overcome the pressure gradient caused by the AS. While the muscular layer of the left ventricle thickens, the aeries that supply the muscle do not get significantly longer or bigger, so the muscle may not receive enough blood supply to meet its oxygen requirement. This ischemia may first be evident during exercise when the heart muscle requires increased blood supply to compensate for the increased workload. The individual may complain of anginal chest pain with exeion. At this stage, a cardiac stress test with imaging may be suggestive of ischemia. Eventually, however, the heart muscle will require more blood supply at rest than can be supplied by the coronary aery branches. At this point there may be signs of ventricular strain pattern (ST segment depression and T wave inversion) on the EKG, suggesting subendocardial ischemia. The subendocardium is the region that is most susceptible to ischemia because it is the most distant from the epicardial coronary aeries. syncope Syncope (fainting spells) from aoic valve stenosis is usually exeional. In the setting of heart failure it increases the risk of death. In people with syncope, the three-year moality rate is 50% if the aoic valve is not replaced. It is unclear why aoic stenosis causes syncope. One theory is that severe AS produces a nearly fixed cardiac output. When a person with aoic stenosis exercises, their peripheral vascular resistance will decrease as the blood vessels of the skeletal muscles dilate to allow the muscles to receive more blood to allow them to do more work. This decrease in peripheral vascular resistance is normally compensated for by an increase in the cardiac output. Since people with severe AS cannot increase their cardiac output, the blood pressure falls and the person will faint due to decreased blood perfusion to the brain. A second theory is that during exercise the high pressures generated in the hyperophied left ventricle cause a vasodepressor response, which causes a secondary peripheral vasodilation that, in turn, causes decreased blood flow to the brain resulting in loss of consciousness. Indeed, in aoic stenosis, because of the fixed obstruction to blood flow out from the heart, it may be impossible for the heart to increase its output to offset peripheral vasodilation. A third mechanism may sometimes be operative. Due to the hyperophy of the left ventricle in aoic stenosis, including the consequent inability of the coronary aeries to adequately supply blood to the myocardium (see \"Angina\" below), abnormal heart rhythms may develop. These can lead to syncope. Finally, in calcific aoic stenosis at least, the calcification in and around the aoic valve can progress and extend to involve the electrical conduction system of the heart. If that occurs, the result may be heart block, a potentially lethal condition of which syncope may be a symptom. congestive heart failure Congestive heart failure (CHF) carries a grave prognosis in people with AS. People with CHF attributable to AS have a 2-year moality rate of 50% if the aoic valve is not replaced. CHF in the setting of AS is due to a combination of left ventricular hyperophy with fibrosis, systolic dysfunction (a decrease in the ejection fraction) and diastolic dysfunction (elevated filling pressure of the LV).

        "question": "True about Septic shock",
        "exp": "The hallmark of septic shock is a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance that occurs despite increased levels of vasopressor catecholamines. Before this vasodilatory phase, many patients experience a period during which oxygen delivery to tissues is compromised by myocardial depression, hypovolemia, and other factors. During this \"hypodynamic\" period, the blood lactate concentration is elevated and central venous oxygen saturation is low. Fluid administration is usually followed by the hyperdynamic, vasodilatory phase during which cardiac output is normal (or even high) and oxygen consumption declines despite adequate oxygen delivery. The blood lactate level may be normal or increased, and normalization of central venous oxygen saturation may reflect either improved oxygen delivery or left-to-right shunting. Prominent hypotensive molecules include nitric oxide, b-endorphin, bradykinin, platelet-activating factor, and prostacyclin. Agents that inhibit the synthesis or action of each of these mediators can prevent or reverse endotoxic shock in animals. However, in clinical trials, neither a platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist nor a bradykinin antagonist improved survival rates among patients with septic shock, and a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-N G -methylarginine HCl, actually increased the moality rate. Remarkably, recent findings indicate that exogenous nitrite can protect mice from challenge with TNF or LPS. Nitrite provides a storage pool from which nitric oxide can be generated in hypoxicand/or acidic conditions. These findings should renew interest in the possibility of exploiting nitric oxide metabolism to improve no survival rates among septic patients. ref: harrison&; s principles of internal medicine, ed 18, pg no 2226",

The pathogenesis of this is not clearly understood. Many factors may contribute to its development, including renal dysfunction, resistance vessel tone, endothelial dysfunction, autonomic tone, insulin resistance and neurohumoral factors.~80-95% of hypeensive patients are diagnosed as having \"essential\" hypertension (also referred to as primary or idiopathic hypertension). Essential hypertension tends to be familial and is likely to be the consequence of an interaction between environmental and genetic factors. The prevalence of essential hypertension increases with age, and individuals with relatively high blood pressures at younger ages are at increased risk for the subsequent development of hypertension. It is likely that essential hypertension represents a spectrum disorders with different underlying pathophysiologies. In the majority of patients with established hypertension, peripheral resistance is increased and cardiac output is normal or decreased; however, in younger patients with mild or labile hypertension, cardiac output may be increased and peripheral resistance may be normal.

        "exp": "The peak incidence of aoic dissection is in the sixth and seventh decades. Men are more affected than women by a ratio of 2: 1. The presentations of aoic dissection and its variants are the consequences of intimal tear, dissecting hematoma, occlusion of involved aeries, and compression of adjacent tissues. Acute aoic dissection presents with the sudden onset of pain, which often is described as very severe and tearing and is associated with diaphoresis. The pain may be localized to the front or back of the chest, often the interscapular region, and typically migrates with propagation of the dissection. Other symptoms include syncope, dyspnea, and weakness. Physical findings may include hypertension or hypotension, loss of pulses, aoic regurgitation, pulmonary edema, and neurologic findings due to carotid aery obstruction (hemiplegia, hemianesthesia) or spinal cord ischemia (paraplegia). Bowel ischemia, hematuria, and myocardial ischemia have all been observed. These clinical manifestations reflect complications resulting from the dissection occluding the major aeries. Fuhermore, clinical manifestations may result from the compression of adjacent structures (e. g., superior cervical ganglia, superior vena cava, bronchus, esophagus) by the expanding dissection, causing aneurysmal dilation, and include Horner's syndrome, superior vena cava syndrome, hoarseness, dysphagia, and airway compromise. Hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade may complicate a type A lesion with retrograde dissection. Acute aoic regurgitation is an impoant and common (>50%) complication of proximal dissection. It is the outcome of either a circumferential tear that widens the aoic root or a disruption of the annulus by a dissecting hematoma that tears a leaflet(s) or displaces it, inferior to the line of closure. Signs of aoic regurgitation include bounding pulses, a wide pulse pressure, a diastolic murmur often radiating along the right sternal border, and evidence of congestive heart failure. The clinical manifestations depend on the severity of the regurgitation. ref: Harrison&; s principles of internal medicine, ed 18, pg no 2057",

The bicycle ergometer or the treadmill is currently used for most exercise testing programs. There are various exercise protocols such as the Bruce protocol or the Naughton protocol to assess effo tolerance. In all these protocols the subject is made to exercise in stages of increasing workloads until the end points are achieved. During exercise, various parameters like occurrence of symptoms, fluctuations in blood pressure changes in the ST segment, and changes in cardiac rate and rhythm are closely monitored. Although the stress test is fairly safe, it has to be done only under close medical supervision. Currently the main indications for stress testing are: 1. As a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of symptoms like effo induced chest pain, or palpitation. 2. To assess the prognosis and in the risk stratification of patients with coronary aery disease, either after acute events like myocardial infarction or angina, or after therapeutic interventions like coronary angioplasty or by pass surgery. 3. To assess the functional capacity in patients with ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy and patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 4. As a screening test for ischemic heart disease in subjects with an intermediate or high probability for the disease. The test is considered positive if there is flat or down sloping ST segment depression of 1 mm or more, ST segment elevation, inversion of U waves, fall in blood pressure and ischemic symptoms associated with ECG changes. Standard contraindications to exercise testing include acute myocardial infarction, high risk unstable angina pectoris, severe aoic stenosis, congestive cardiac failure, acute pulmonary embolism or infarction, acute myocarditis or pericarditis, aoic dissection, uncontrolled severe systemic hypertension > 200/100 mm Hg, high grade heart blocks, uncontrolled symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias, any acute systemic illness or an unwilling patient. The indications to terminate exercise testing includes inappropriate drop in blood pressure or deceleration of the heart rate with increasing workload and exercise, moderate to severe angina, sustained VT, ST depression more than 3 mm or ST elevation in non Q leads, hypeensive response > 250/115 mm Hg, patient exhaustion, fatigue, leg cramps or claudication pain and subject's desire to stop the test. Exercise stress testing has a sensitivity of about 80 to 85% and a specificity of 85 to 90% for the diagnosis of coronary aery disease. In patients with ischemic heart disease, positive stress test is an indication for fuher tests such as coronary angiography.",

        "exp": "in Aoic dissection Nitroprusside, esmolol, labetalol etc are those drugs which are more effective when given parenterally. Chronic aoic dissections are associated with weakening of the aoic wall that may lead to the development of aneurysmal dilatation. Aoic dissection is caused by a circumferential or, less frequently, transverse tear of the intima. It often occurs along the right lateral wall of the ascending aoa where the hydraulic shear stress is high. Another common site is the descendingthoracic aoa just below the ligamentum aeriosum. For acute dissection, unless contraindicated, b-adrenergic blockers should be administered parenterally, using intravenous propranolol, metoprolol, or the sho-acting esmolol to achieve a heart rate of approximately 60 beats/min. This should be accompanied by sodium nitroprusside infusion to lower systolic blood pressure to <=120 mm. Hg. Labetalol ( Chap. 247 ), a drug with both b- and a-adrenergic blocking propeies, also may be used as a parenteral agent in acute therapy for dissection. The calcium channel antagonists verapamil and diltiazem may be used intravenously if nitroprusside or b-adrenergic blockers cannot be employed. The addition of a parenteral angiotensinconveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitor such as enalaprilat to a b-adrenergic blocker also may be considered. Isolated use of a direct vasodilator such as hydralazine is contraindicated because these agents can increase hydraulic shear and may propagate the dissection. ref: Harrison&; s principles of internal medicine, ed 18, pg no 2064",

        "exp": "Constrictive pericarditis is a medical condition characterized by a thickened, fibrotic pericardium, limiting the heart's ability to function normally. In many cases, the condition continues to be difficult to diagnose and therefore benefits from a good understanding of the underlying cause The pathophysiological characteristics of constrictive pericarditis are due to a thickened, fibrotic pericardium that forms a non-compliant shell around the heart. This shell prevents the heart from expanding when blood enters it. This results in significant respiratory variation in blood flow in the chambers of the heart. During inspiration, pressure in the thoracic cavity decreases but is not relayed to the left atrium, subsequently a reduction in flow to the left atrium and ventricle happens. During diastole, less blood flow in left ventricle allows for more room for filling in right ventricle and therefore a septal shift occurs. During expiration, the amount of blood entering the right ventricle will decrease, allowing the interventricular septum to bulge towards the right ventricle, and increased filling of the [[left ventricle and subsequent increased pressure generated by the left ventricle during systole. This is known as ventricular interdependence, since the amount of blood flow into one ventricle is dependent on the amount of blood flow into the other ventricle. Signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis are consistent with the following: fatigue, swollen abdomen, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), swelling of legs and general weakness. Related conditions are bacterial pericarditis, pericarditis and pericarditis after a heart attack Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1436",

Comparison with old ECG helpful CARDIAC BIOMARKERS Time course is diagnostically useful; creatine phosphokinase (CK) level rises within 4-8 h, peaks at 24 h, returns to normal by 48-72 h. CK-MB isoenzyme is more specific for MI but may also be elevated with myocarditis or after electrical cardioversion. Total CK (but not CK-MB) rises (two- to threefold) after IM injection, vigorous exercise, or other skeletal muscle trauma. A ratio of CK-MB mass: CK activity \u0003 2. 5 suggests acute MI. CK-MB peaks earlier (about 8 h) following acute reperfusion therapy. Cardiac-specific troponin T and troponin I are highly specific for myocardial injury and are the preferred biochemical markers for diagnosis of acute MI. They remain elevated for 7-10 days. Serum cardiac markers should be measured at presentation, 6-9 h later, then at 12-24 h. NONINVASIVE IMAGING TECHNIQUES Useful when diagnosis of MI is not clear. Echocardiography detects infarct-associated regional wall motion abnormalities (but cannot distinguish acute MI from a previous myocardial scar). Echo is also useful in detecting RV infarction, LV aneurysm, and LV thrombus.

It may occur at the aoic valve as well as above and below this level. It typically gets worse over time. Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first.

Signs of heart failure include shoness of breath especially when lying down, at night, or with exercise, and swelling of the legs. Thickening of the valve without narrowing is known as aoic sclerosis Treatment is generally not necessary in people without symptoms. In moderate cases echocardiography is performed every 1-2 years to monitor the progression, possibly complemented with a cardiac stress test. In severe cases, echocardiography is performed every 3-6 months. In both moderate and mild cases, the person should immediately make a revisit or be admitted for inpatient care if any new related symptoms appear.

The signs and symptoms of nonhemorrhagic hypovolemic shock are the same as those of hemorrhagic shock, although they may have a more insidious onset. The normal physiologic response to hypovolemia is to maintain perfusion of the brain and heart while attempting to restore an effective circulating blood volume. There is an increase in sympathetic activity, hyperventilation, collapse of venous capacitance vessels, release of stress hormones, and an attempt to replace the loss of intravascular volume through the recruitment of interstitial and intracellular fluid and by reduction of urine output. Mild hypovolemia (<=20% of the blood volume) generates mild tachycardia but relatively few external signs, especially in a supine young patient ( Table 270-5 ). With moderate hypovolemia (~20-40% of the blood volume), the patient becomes increasingly anxious and although normal blood pressure may be maintained in the supine position, there may be significant postural hypotension and tachycardia. If hypovolemia is severe (>=40% of the blood volume), the classic signs of shock appear; the blood pressure declines and becomes unstable even in the supine position, and the patient develops marked tachycardia, oliguria, and agitation or confusion. Perfusion of the central nervous system is well maintained until shock becomes severe.

For people who cannot tolerate beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil can be used, but are potentially harmful in people who also have low blood pressure or severe shoness of breath at rest. These medications also decrease the heart rate, though their use in people with severe outflow obstruction, elevated pulmonary aery wedge pressure, and low blood pressures should be done with caution. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be avoided in people with evidence of obstruction. For people whose symptoms are not relieved by the above treatments, disopyramide can be considered for fuher symptom relief. Diuretics can be considered for people with evidence of fluid overload, though cautiously used in those with evidence of obstruction. People who continue to have symptoms despite drug therapy can consider more invasive therapies. Intravenous phenylephrine (or another pure vasoconstricting agent) can be used in the acute setting of low blood pressure in those with obstructive hyperophic cardiomyopathy who do not respond to fluid administration.

Such imaging is usually undeaken only in patients in whom intervention to improve renal perfusion would be contemplated; this is usually limited to young patients and those in whom blood pressure cannot be controlled with antihypeensive agents ('resistant hypertension'), those who have a history of 'flash' pulmonary oedema or accelerated phase ('malignant') hypertension, or those in whom renal function is deteriorating. CT and MRI angiographic techniques have largely replaced Doppler ultrasound or renal isotope scanning (including 'captopril renography') in diagnosing renal aery stenosis. Conventional renal aery cannulation and aeriography is now usually undeaken for therapeutic rather than diagnostic purposes. CT angiography entails large intravenously administered doses of contrast medium which may be nephrotoxic. ref: Harrison's principles of internal medicine, ed 18, pg no 2045",

The prevalence rises with age, affecting 1% of those aged 60-64 years, increasing to 9% of those aged over 80 years. It is associated with significant morbidity and a twofold increase in moality. This is mainly because of its association with underlying heart disease but also because of its association with systemic embolism and stroke. Pathogenesis AF is a complex arrhythmia characterised by both abnormal automatic firing and the presence of multiple interacting re-entry circuits looping around the atria. Episodes of AF are initiated by rapid bursts of ectopic beats arising from conducting tissue in the pulmonary veins or from diseased atrial tissue. It becomes sustained because of re-entrant conduction within the atria or sometimes because of continuous ectopic firing. Re-entry is more likely to occur in atria that are enlarged or in which conduction is slow, as is the case in many forms of heart disease. During episodes of AF, the atria beat rapidly but in an uncoordinated and ineffective manner. The ventricles are activated irregularly at a rate determined by conduction through the AV node. This produces the characteristic 'irregularly irregular' pulse. The ECG shows normal but irregular QRS complexes; there are no P waves but the baseline may show irregular fibrillation waves. Commonly, AF is classified as paroxysmal (intermittent episodes that self-terminate within 7 days) Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1534",

In addition to hemolysis, there is often pancytopenia and a distinct tendency to venous thrombosis. This triad makes PNH a truly unique clinical condition. Hemolysis in PNH is mainly intravascular and is due to an intrinsic abnormality of the red cell, which makes it exquisitely sensitive to activated C, whether it is activated through the alternative pathway or through an antigen-antibody reaction. The former mechanism is mainly responsible for chronic hemolysis in PNH; the latter explains why the hemolysis can be dramatically exacerbated in the course of a viral or bacterial infection. Hypersusceptibility to C is due to deficiency of several protective membrane proteins, of which CD59 is the most impoant because it hinders the inseion into the membrane of C9 polymers. The molecular basis for the deficiency of these proteins has been pinpointed not to a defect in any of the respective genes, but rather to the shoage of a unique glycolipid molecule, GPI, which, through a peptide bond, anchors these proteins to the surface membrane of cells. The shoage of GPI is due in turn to a mutation in an X-linked gene, called PIG-A, required for an early step in GPI biosynthesis.

Therefore, elevated filling pressures are frequently to maintain adequate ventricular performance. Volume resuscitation is initiated with the rapid infusion of either isotonic saline (although care must be taken to avoid hyperchloremic acidosis from loss of bicarbonate buffering capacity and replacement with excess chloride) or a balanced salt solution such as Ringer's lactate (being cognizant of the presence of potassium and potential renal dysfunction) through large-bore intravenous lines.

No distinct benefit from the use of colloid has been demonstrated, and in trauma patients it is associated with a higher moality, paicularly in patients with TBI. The infusion of 2-3 L of salt solution over 20-30 min should restore normal hemodynamic parameters. ref: harrison&; s principles of internal medicine, ed 18, pg no 2221",

Diagnosis is typically by electrocardiogram (ECG), however, the abnormalities may not be consistently present. About a quaer of those with Brugada syndrome have a family member who also has the condition. Some cases may be due to a new genetic mutation or ceain medications. The most commonly involved gene is SCN5A which encodes the cardiac sodium channel. Diagnosis is typically by electrocardiogram (ECG), however, the abnormalities may not be consistently present. Medications such as ajmaline may be used to reveal the ECG changes. Similar ECG patterns may be seen in ceain electrolyte disturbances or when the blood supply to the heart has been reduced. There is no cure for Brugada syndrome. Those at higher risk of sudden cardiac death may be treated using an implantable cardioveer defibrillator (ICD) In those without symptoms the risk of death is much lower, and how to treat this group is less clear. Isoproterenol may be used in the sho term for those who have frequent life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms, while quinidine may be used longer term. Testing people's family members may be recommended While many of those with Brugada syndrome do not have any symptoms, Brugada syndrome may cause fainting or sudden cardiac death due to serious abnormal heart rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Blackouts may be caused by brief abnormal heart rhythms that reve to a normal rhythm spontaneously. If a dangerous heart rhythm does not stop by itself and is left untreated, the person may have a fatal cardiac arrest. However, blackouts can occur in those with Brugada syndrome despite a normal heart rhythm due to a sudden drop in blood pressure, known as vasovagal syncope. The abnormal heart rhythms seen in Brugada syndrome often occur at rest, following a heavy meal, or even during sleep. These situations are linked to periods when the vagus nerve is activated, referred to as periods of high vagal tone. Abnormal heart rhythms may also occur during fever or following excessive alcohol. Ceain medications may also worsen the tendency to abnormal heart rhythms in patients with Brugada syndrome and should be avoided by these patients. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 440",

        "question": "Which of the following is the best inotrope agent for use in Right Heart Failure Secondary to pulmonary hypertension-",
        "exp": "Milrinone, commonly known and marketed under the brand name Primacor, is a medication used in patients who have heart failure. It is a phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor that works to increase the heart's contractility and decrease pulmonary vascular resistance. Milrinone also works to vasodilate which helps allete increased pressures (afterload) on the heart, thus improving its pumping action. While it has been used in people with heart failure for many years, studies suggest that milrinone may exhibit some negative side effects that have caused some debate about its use clinically Overall, milrinone suppos ventricular functioning of the heart by decreasing the degradation of c. AMP and thus increasing phosphorylation levels of many components in the heart that contribute to contractility and heart rate. Milrinone use following cardiac surgery has been under some debate because of the potential increase risk of postoperative atrial arrhythmias.] However, in the sho term milrinone has been deemed beneficial to those experiencing heart failure and an effective therapy to maintain heart function following cardiac surgeries. There is no evidence of any long term beneficial effects on survival. In critically ill patients with evidence of cardiac dysfunction there is limited good quality evidence to recommend its use Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (c. AMP) causes increased activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA is an enzyme that phosphorylates many elements of the contractile machinery within the heart cell. In the sho term this leads to an increased force of contraction. Phosphodiesterases are enzymes responsible for the breakdown of c. AMP. Therefore, when phosphodiesterases lower the level of c. AMP in the cell they also lower the active fraction of PKA within the cell and reduce the force of contraction. Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor. This drug inhibits the action of phosphodiesterase-3 and thus prevents degradation of c. AMP. With increased c. AMP levels there is an increase in the activation of PKA. This PKA will phosphorylate many components of the cardiomyocyte such as calcium channels and components of the myofilaments. Phosphorylation of calcium channels permits an increase in calcium influx into the cell. This increase in calcium influx results in increased contractility. PKA also phosphorylates potassium channels promoting their action. Potassium channels are responsible for repolarization of the cardiomyocytes therefore increasing the rate at which cells can depolarize and generate contraction. PKA also phosphorylates components on myofilaments allowing actin and myosin to interact more easily and thus increasing contractility and the inotropic state of the heart. Milrinone allows stimulation of cardiac function independently of b-adrenergic receptors which appear to be down-regulated in those with heart failure. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 467",

In many cases, the condition continues to be difficult to diagnose and therefore benefits from a good understanding of the underlying cause Signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis are consistent with the following: fatigue, swollen abdomen, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), swelling of legs and general weakness. Related conditions are bacterial pericarditis, pericarditis and pericarditis after a heart attack The pathophysiological characteristics of constrictive pericarditis are due to a thickened, fibrotic pericardium that forms a non-compliant shell around the heart. This shell prevents the heart from expanding when blood enters it. This results in significant respiratory variation in blood flow in the chambers of the heart. During inspiration, pressure in the thoracic cavity decreases but is not relayed to the left atrium, subsequently a reduction in flow to the left atrium and ventricle happens. During diastole, less blood flow in left ventricle allows for more room for filling in right ventricle and therefore a septal shift occurs During expiration, the amount of blood entering the right ventricle will decrease, allowing the interventricular septum to bulge towards the right ventricle, and increased filling of the [[left ventricle and subsequent increased pressure generated by the left ventricle during systole. This is known as ventricular interdependence, since the amount of blood flow into one ventricle is dependent on the amount of blood flow into the other ventricle. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1445",

The inhibition of ferrochelatase by lead may result in the appearance of a few ring sideroblasts, red cell precursors with iron-laden mitochondria that are detected with a Prussian blue stain. In the peripheral blood, the defect inhemoglobin synthesis appears as a microcytic, hypochromic anemia that is often accompanied by mild hemolysis. Even more distinctive is a punctate basophilic stippling of the red cells. Brain damage is prone to occur in children In young children, sensory, motor, intellectual, and psychologic impairments have been described, includingreduced IQ, learning disabilities, retarded psychomotor development, blindness, and, in more severe cases, psychoses, seizures and coma. In adults, the CNS is less often affected, but frequently a peripheral demyelinating neuropathy appears, typically involving the motor nerves of the mostcommonly used muscles. Thus, the extensor muscles of the wrist and fingers are often the first to be affected (causing wrist-drop), followed by paralysis of the peroneal muscles (causing foot-drop). Lead \"colic\" is characterized by extremely severe, poorly localized abdominal pain. Kidneys may develop proximal tubular damage associated with intranuclear inclusions consisting of protein aggregates.

Ventricular tachycardia Ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurs most commonly in the settings of acute MI, chronic coronary aery disease and cardiomyopathy. It is associated with extensive ventricular disease, impaired left ventricular function and ventricular aneurysm. In these settings, VT may cause haemodynamic compromise or degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. VT is caused by abnormal automaticity or triggered activity in ischaemic tissue, or by re-entry within scarred ventricular tissue. Patients may complain of palpitation or symptoms of low cardiac output, including dyspnoea, lightheadedness and syncope. The ECG shows tachycardia and broad, abnormal QRS complexes with a rate of more than 120/min. It may be difficult to distinguish VT from SVT with bundle branch block or pre-excitation (WPW syndrome) on ECG. A 12-lead ECG or electrophysiology study may help establish the diagnosis. When there is doubt, it is safer to manage the problem as VT. Patients recovering from MI sometimes have periods of idioventricular rhythm ('slow' VT) at a rate only slightly above the preceding sinus rate and below 120/min. These episodes often reflect reperfusion of the infarct territory and may be a good sign. They are usually self-limiting and asymptomatic, and do not require treatment.

About 40% of people with the electrical problem never develop symptoms. Symptoms can include an abnormally fast heabeat, palpitations, shoness of breath, lightheadedness, or syncope. Rarely, cardiac arrest may occur. The most common type of irregular heabeat that occurs is known as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia WPW is commonly diagnosed on the basis of the electrocardiogram in an asymptomatic individual. In this case, it is manifested as a delta wave, which is a slurred upstroke in the QRS complex that is associated with a sho PR interval. The sho PR interval and slurring of the QRS complex are reflective of the impulse making it to the ventricles early ( the accessory pathway) without the usual delay experienced in the AV node. If a person with WPW experiences episodes of atrial fibrillation, the ECG shows a rapid polymorphic wide-complex tachycardia (without torsades de pointes). This combination of atrial fibrillation and WPW is considered dangerous, and most antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated. When an individual is in normal sinus rhythm, the ECG characteristics of WPW are a sho PR interval (less than 120 milliseconds in duration), widened QRS complex (greater than 120 milliseconds in duration) with slurred upstroke of the QRS complex, and secondary repolarization changes (reflected in ST segment-T wave changes). In individuals with WPW, electrical activity that is initiated in the SA node travels through the accessory pathway, as well as through the AV node to activate the ventricles both pathways. Since the accessory pathway does not have the impulse slowing propeies of the AV node, the electrical impulse first activates the ventricles the accessory pathway, and immediately afterwards the AV node. This gives the sho PR interval and slurred upstroke of the QRS complex known as the delta wave. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1423",

ST elevation in two contiguous leads or new LBBB) and appropriateness of reperfusion therapy, which reduces infarct size, LV dysfunction, and moality. * Primary PCI is generally more effective than fibrinolysis and is preferred at experienced centers capable of performing procedure rapidly, especially when diagnosis is in doubt, cardiogenic shock is present, bleeding risk is increased, or if symptoms have been present for \u00013 h. * Proceed with IV fibrinolysis if PCI is not available or if logistics would delay PCI \u00011 h longer than fibrinolysis could be initiated (Fig. 123-1). Dooo- needle time should be \u0005 30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK; maintain a. PTTT at 1. 5-2. 0 control (\u000150-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists \u000190 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different. In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop; (2) nitroglycerin 0. 3 mg SL if systolic bp \u0001 100 mm. Hg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation \u0001 90%). * Mild sedation (e. g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e. g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypertension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp \u0005 95 mm. Hg, heart rate \u0005 50 beats/min, AV block, or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e. g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e. g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e. g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e. g., captopril (6. 25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e. g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias.",

Cardioversion is defined as a \"synchronized DC discharge, and does not apply to ventricular defibrillation or to the pharmacologic reversion of arrhythmias. \" It is typically used to terminate life-threatening or unstable tachycardic arrhythmia (unstable ventricular and supraventricular rhythms) in patients who still have a pulse but who are hemodynamically unstable. The DC electrical discharge is synchronized with the R or S wave of the QRS complex. Synchronization in the early pa of the QRS complex avoids energy delivery near the apex of the T wave in the surface electrocardiogram (ECG), which coincides with a vulnerable period for induction of ventricular fibrillation. The peak of the T wave represents the terminal poion of the refractory state when adjacent heart fibers are in differing states of repolarization. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1515",

        "exp": "Initial management in hospital is by pericardiocentesis. This involves the inseion of a needle through the skin and into the pericardium and aspirating fluid under ultrasound guidance preferably. This can be done laterally through the intercostal spaces, usually the fifth, or as a subxiphoid approach. A left parasternal approach begins 3 to 5 cm left of the sternum to avoid the left internal mammary aery, in the 5th intercostal space. Often, a cannula is left in place during resuscitation following initial drainage so that the procedure can be performed again if the need arises. If facilities are available, an emergency pericardial window may be performed instead] during which the pericardium is cut open to allow fluid to drain. Following stabilization of the person, surgery is provided to seal the source of the bleed and mend the pericardium. In people following heart surgery the nurses monitor the amount of chest tube drainage. If the drainage volume drops off, and the blood pressure goes down, this can suggest tamponade due to chest tube clogging. In that case, the person is taken back to the operating room for an emergency reoperation. If aggressive treatment is offered immediately and no complications arise (shock, AMI or arrhythmia, heart failure, aneurysm, carditis, embolism, or rupture), or they are dealt with quickly and fully contained, then adequate survival is still a distinct possibility.

Hg with inspiration that is seen in patients with pericardial tamponade but also is described in those with massive pulmonary embolism, hemorrhagic shock, severe obstructive lung disease, and tension pnuemothorax Pulsus paradoxus is measured by noting the difference between the systolic pressure at which the Korotkoff sounds are first heard (during expiration) and the systolic pressure at which the Korotkoff sounds are heard with each heabeat, independent of the respiratory phase. Between these two pressures, the Korotkoff sounds are heard only intermittently and during expiration. The cuff pressure must be decreased slowly to appreciate the finding. It can be difficult to measure pulsus paradoxus in patients with tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or tachypnea. A pulsus paradoxus may be palpable at the brachial aery or femoral aery level when the pressure difference exceeds 15 mm. Hg. This inspiratory fall in systolic pressure is an exaggerated consequence of interventricular dependence. ref: Harrison&; s principle of internal medicine, 20th edition, pg no. 1825",

The elements of CPR are the maintenance of ventilation of the lungs and compression of the chest. Mouth-to-mouth respiration may be used if no specific rescue equipment is immediately available (e. g., plastic oropharyngeal airways, esophageal obturators, masked Ambu bag). Conventional ventilation techniques during single-responder CPR require that the lungs be inflated twice in succession after every 30 chest compressions. Recent data suggest that interrupting chest compressions to perform mouth-to-mouth respiration may be less effective than a continuous chest compression strategy. Chest compression is based on the assumption that cardiac compression allows the heart to maintain a pump function by sequential filling and emptying of its chambers, with competent valves maintaining forward direction of flow. The palm of one hand is placed over the lower sternum, with the heel of the other resting on the dorsum of the lower hand. The sternum is depressed, with the arms remaining straight, at a rate of approximately100 per minute.

        "exp": "A pneumothorax is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shoness of breath. In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shoage and low blood pressure Unless reversed by effective treatment this can be fatal. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis A primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) tends to occur in a young adult without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms. Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features. People who are affected by a PSP are often unaware of the potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention. PSPs more commonly occur during changes in atmospheric pressure, explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax may happen in clusters. It is rare for a PSP to cause a tension pneumothorax. Secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, occur in individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs tend to be more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and - if very severe - may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax. Traumatic pneumothorax most commonly occurs when the chest wall is pierced, such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space, or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises the integrity of the involved structures. Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma, with only rib fractures being more common in this group. The pneumothorax can be occult (not readily apparent) in half of these cases, but may enlarge - paicularly if mechanical ventilation is required. They are also encountered in people already receiving mechanical ventilation for some other reason. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1456",

Hg with inspiration that is seen in patients with pericardial tamponade but also is described in those with massive pulmonary embolism, hemorrhagic shock, severe obstructive lung disease, and tension pneumothorax. Pulsus paradoxus is measured by noting the difference between the systolic pressure at which the Korotkoff sounds are first heard (during expiration) and the systolic pressure at which the Korotkoff sounds are heard with each heabeat, independent of the respiratory phase. Between these two pressures, the Korotkoff sounds are heard only intermittently and during expiration. The cuff pressure must be decreased slowly to appreciate the finding. It can be difficult to measure pulsus paradoxus in patients with tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, or tachypnea. A pulsus paradoxus may be palpable at the brachial aery or femoral aery level when the pressure difference exceeds 15 mm. Hg.

        "exp": "Constrictive pericarditis is a medical condition characterized by a thickened, fibrotic pericardium, limiting the heart&; s ability to function normally. In many cases, the condition continues to be difficult to diagnose and therefore benefits from a good understanding of the underlying cause The pathophysiological characteristics of constrictive pericarditis are due to a thickened, fibrotic pericardium that forms a non-compliant shell around the heart. This shell prevents the heart from expanding when blood enters it. This results in significant respiratory variation in blood flow in the chambers of the heart. During inspiration, pressure in the thoracic cavity decreases but is not relayed to the left atrium, subsequently a reduction in flow to the left atrium and ventricle happens. During diastole, less blood flow in left ventricle allows for more room for filling in right ventricle and therefore a septal shift occurs. During expiration, the amount of blood entering the right ventricle will decrease, allowing the interventricular septum to bulge towards the right ventricle, and increased filling of the left ventricle and subsequent increased pressure generated by the left ventricle during systole. This is known as ventricular interdependence, since the amount of blood flow into one ventricle is dependent on the amount of blood flow into the other ventricle. Signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis are consistent with the following: fatigue, swollen abdomen, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), swelling of legs and general weakness. Related conditions are bacterial pericarditis, pericarditis and pericarditis after a heart attack Diagnosis: The diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is often difficult to make. In paicular, restrictive cardiomyopathy has many similar clinical features to constrictive pericarditis, and differentiating them in a paicular individual is often a diagnostic dilemma. Chest X-Ray - pericardial calcification (common but not specific), pleural effusions are common findings. Echocardiography - the principal echographic finding is changes in cardiac chamber volume. CT and MRI - useful in select cases. BNP blood test - tests for the existence of the cardiac hormone brain natriuretic peptide, which is only present in RCMP but not in CP Conventional cardiac catheterization Physical examination - can reveal clinical features including Kussmaul&; s sign and a pericardial knock Treatment: The definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis is pericardial stripping, which is a surgical procedure where the entire pericardium is peeled away from the heart. This procedure has significant risk involved, with moality rates of 6% or higher in major referral centers. A poor outcome is almost always the result after a pericardiectomy is performed for constrictive pericarditis whose origin was radiation-induced, fuher some patients may develop heart failure post-operatively.

Based on Lundsgaard and Van Slyke&; s work, it is classically described as occurring if 5. 0 g/dL of deoxyhemoglobin or greater is present. This was based on an estimate of capillary saturation based on a mean of aerial versus peripheral venous blood gas measurements. Since estimation of hypoxia is usually now based either on aerial blood gas measurement or pulse oximetry, this is probably an overestimate, with evidence that levels of 2. 0 g/dL of deoxyhemoglobin may reliably produce cyanosis. Since, however, the presence of cyanosis is dependent upon there being an absolute quantity of deoxyhemoglobin, the bluish color is more readily apparent in those with high hemoglobin counts than it is with those with anemia. Also, the bluer the color, the more difficult it is to detect on deeply pigmented skin. When signs of cyanosis first appear, such as on the lips or fingers, intervention should be made within 3-5 minutes because a severe hypoxia or severe circulatory failure may have induced the cyanosis Approach to diagnosis: Inquire about duration (cyanosis since bih suggests congenital heart disease) and exposures (drugs or chemicals that result in abnormal hemoglobins). Differentiate central from peripheral cyanosis. Check for nail clubbing: Combination of clubbing and cyanosis suggests congenital heart disease and occasionally pulmonary disease.

Hypothermia also is used to treat newborns with perinatal asphyxia; however, this aicle focuses on its use in adults. Hypothermia counteracts neuroexcitation in brain cells by stabilizing calcium and glutamate release, reducing the degree of cell death. It also stabilizes the blood-brain barrier and suppresses the inflammatory process, reducing cerebral edema. Cerebral metabolism decreases 6% to 10% for every degree Celsius that body temperature drops. As cerebral metabolism declines, the brain needs less oxygen. In essence, hypothermia counteracts many of the destructive mechanisms of cardiac arrest. Its effects resemble those of cardiac defibrillation, which makes the heart stop and then reset itself to a normal rhythm. Similarly, hypothermia halts destructive brain mechanisms and lets the brain reset itself to normal functioning. Therapeutic hypothermia occurs in three phases--induction, maintenance, and rewarming. Clinicians must control hypothermia and rewarming to prevent potential adverse effects, such as arrhythmias and skin breakdown during the cold phases (induction and maintenance) and rapid electrolyte shifts during the rewarming phase. Temperature should be monitored with a method that measures core temperature, such as use of an esophageal, bladder, or pulmonary aery catheter. REF - pubmed. com, medlineplus. com",

        "exp": "Obstructive or non-obstructive Depending on whether the distoion of normal heart anatomy causes an obstruction of the outflow of blood from the left ventricle of the heart, HCM can be classified as obstructive or non-obstructive. The obstructive variant of HCM, hyperophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), has also historically been known as idiopathic hyperophic subaoic stenosis (IHSS) and asymmetric septal hyperophy (ASH). Another, non-obstructive variant of HCM is apical hyperophic cardiomyopathy, also called Yamaguchi Syndrome or Yamaguchi Hyperophy, first described in individuals of Japanese descent. Hyperophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which a poion of the heart becomes thickened without an obvious cause. This results in the heart being less able to pump blood effectively. Symptoms vary from none to feeling tired, leg swelling, and shoness of breath. It may also result in chest pain or fainting. Complications include heart failure, an irregular heabeat, and sudden cardiac death. It is often due to mutations in ceain genes involved with making heart muscle proteins. Other causes may include Fabry disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and ceain medications such as tacrolimus. It is a type of cardiomyopathy, a group of diseases that primarily affects the heart muscle. Diagnosis often involves an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and stress testing. Genetic testing may also be done Upon cardiac catheterization, catheters can be placed in the left ventricle and the ascending aoa, to measure the pressure difference between these structures. In normal individuals, during ventricular systole, the pressure in the ascending aoa and the left ventricle will equalize, and the aoic valve is open. In individuals with aoic stenosis or with HCM with an outflow tract gradient, there will be a pressure gradient (difference) between the left ventricle and the aoa, with the left ventricular pressure higher than the aoic pressure. This gradient represents the degree of obstruction that has to be overcome in order to eject blood from the left ventricle. The Brockenbrough-Braunwald-Morrow sign is observed in individuals with HCM with outflow tract gradient. This sign can be used to differentiate HCM from aoic stenosis. In individuals with aoic stenosis, after a premature ventricular contraction (PVC), the following ventricular contraction will be more forceful, and the pressure generated in the left ventricle will be higher. Because of the fixed obstruction that the stenotic aoic valve represents, the post-PVC ascending aoic pressure will increase as well. In individuals with HCM, however, the degree of obstruction will increase more than the force of contraction will increase in the post-PVC beat. The result of this is that the left ventricular pressure increases and the ascending aoic pressure decreases, with an increase in the LVOT gradient. While the Brockenbrough-Braunwald-Morrow sign is most dramatically demonstrated using simultaneous intra-cardiac and intra-aoic catheters, it can be seen on routine physical examination as a decrease in the pulse pressure in the post-PVC beat in individuals with HCM Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 456",

        "exp": "ACE inhibitors (lisinopril, captopril) Angiotensin conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce the amount of heart-damaging hormones your body produces. They also dilate blood vessels and lower blood pressure to lessen the workload of your heart Angiotensin receptor blockers (losaan) Angiotensin receptor blockers are similar to ACE inhibitors, but they don't cause the cough that some people have when taking ACE inhibitors. Common side effects of angiotensin receptor blockers: Dizziness Changes in kidney function Combination medicines (Entresto, or sacubitril/valsaan) Entresto is a medicine that combines the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsaan with a substance known as sacubitril that causes the heart to squeeze harder and can help your body eliminate excess fluid. The effect of this combination can be more powerful than either drug alone. Entresto is usually staed after a person has been able to tolerate target doses of either an angiotension conveing enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), so this is not usually the first medicine used to treat heart failure. It is currently only used if other medicines have not improved the heart's ability to pump effectively. If you are taking an ACEI (such as lisinopril or enalapril) you will need to stop that medication for 36 hours before staing Entresto. This is very impoant; not doing so could result in a serious reaction. Digoxin (Lanoxin) This medicine slows heart rate and might improve the pumping ability of your heart. You'll get a blood test to make sure the dose you're taking is right for you. Hydralazine and nitrates (Apresoline, Nitrobid, Imdur, Isordil) Hydralazine and nitrates are often used together to treat heart failure. They dilate blood vessels so it's easier for your heart to receive and pump blood.

The upward deflections are the \"a\" (atrial contraction), \"c\" (ventricular contraction and resulting bulging of tricuspid into the right atrium during isovolumetric systole) and \"v\" = venous filling The downward deflections of the wave are the \"x\" (the atrium relaxes and the tricuspid valve moves downward) and the \"y\" descent (filling of ventricle after tricuspid opening Differentiation from the carotid pulse: The JVP and carotid pulse can be differentiated several ways: multiphasic - the JVP \"beats\" twice (in quick succession) in the cardiac cycle. In other words, there are two waves in the JVP for each contraction-relaxation cycle by the heart. The first beat represents that atrial contraction (termed a) and second beat represents venous filling of the right atrium against a closed tricuspid valve (termed v) and not the commonly mistaken 'ventricular contraction'. These wave forms may be altered by ceain medical conditions; therefore, this is not always an accurate way to differentiate the JVP from the carotid pulse. The carotid aery only has one beat in the cardiac cycle. non-palpable - the JVP cannot be palpated. If one feels a pulse in the neck, it is generally the common carotid aery. occludable - the JVP can be stopped by occluding the internal jugular vein by lightly pressing against the neck. It will fill from above. The jugular venous pulsation has a biphasic waveform. The a wave corresponds to right atrial contraction and ends synchronously with the carotid aery pulse. The peak of the 'a' wave demarcates the end of atrial systole. The x descent follows the 'a' wave and corresponds to atrial relaxation and rapid atrial filling due to low pressure. The c wave corresponds to right ventricular contraction causing the tricuspid valve to bulge towards the right atrium during RV isovolumetric contraction. The x' descent follows the 'c' wave and occurs as a result of the right ventricle pulling the tricuspid valve downward during ventricular systole (ventricular ejection/atrial relaxation). (As stroke volume is ejected, the ventricle takes up less space in the pericardium, allowing relaxed atrium to enlarge). The x' (x prime) descent can be used as a measure of right ventricle contractility. The v wave corresponds to venous filling when the tricuspid valve is closed and venous pressure increases from venous return - this occurs during and following the carotid pulse. The y descent corresponds to the rapid emptying of the atrium into the ventricle following the opening of the tricuspid valve. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 456",
