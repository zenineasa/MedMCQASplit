        "question": "Mid diastolic murmur is seen in which of the following?",
        "exp": "ANSWER: (B) MSREF:Harrison 18th ed chapter 8See APPENDIX- 79 below HEART MURMURS APPENDIX- 79HEART MURMURSREF: Harrison 18th ed chapter 8Early diastolicTimeConditionDescriptionEarly diastolicAortic regurgitationThe murmur is low intensity, high-pitched, best heard over the left sternal border or over the right second intercostal space, especially if the patient leans forward and holds breath in full expiration. The radiation is typically toward the apex. The configuration is usually decrescendo and has a blowing character. The presence of this murmur is a good positive predictor for AR and the absence of this murmur strongly suggests the absence of AR. An Austin Flint murmur is usually associated with significant aortic regurgitation.Early diastolicPulmonaryregurgitationPulmonary regurgitation is most commonly due to pulmonaryhypertension (Graham-Steell murmur). It is a high-pitched and blowing murmur with a decrescendo configuration. It may increase in intensity during inspiration and best heard over left second and third intercostal spaces. The murmur usually does not extend to SI.Early diastolicLeft anterior descending artery stenosisThis murmur, also known as Dock s murmur, is similar to that of aortic regurgitation and is heard at the left second or third intercostal space. A Coronary artery bypass surgery can eliminate the murmur.Mid-diastolicTimeConditionDescriptionMid-diastolicMitral stenosisThe first heart sound (S,) is usually accentuated and slightly delayed. The pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P,,) also is often accentuated, and the two components of the second heart sound (S,,) are closely split. The opening snap(OS) of the mitral valve is most readily audible in expiration at, or just medial to the cardiac apex. This sound generally follows the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) by 0.05-0.12 s. The time interval between A2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent positionMid-diastolicTricuspid stenosisBest heard over the left sternal border with rumbling character and tricuspid opening snap with wide splitting SI. May increase in intensity with inspiration (Carvallos sign). Tricuspid stenosis often occurs in association with mitral stenosis. Isolated TS are often associated with carcinoid disease and right atrial myxoma.Mid-diastolicAtrial myxomaAtrial myxomas are benign tumors of the heart. Left myxomas are far more common than right myxomas and those may cause obstruction of the mitral valve producing a mid-diastolic murmur similar to that of mitral stenosis. An echocardiographic evaluation is necessary.Mid-diastolicIncreased flow across the atrioventricular valveThis can also produce a mid-diastolic murmur, such as in severe mitral regurgitation where a large regurgitant volume in the left atrium can lead to \"functional mitral stenosis.\"Mid-diastolicAustin Flint murmurAn apical diastolic rumbling murmur in patients with pure aortic regurgitation. This can be mistaken with the murmur in mitral stenosis and should be noted by the fact that an Austin Flint murmur does not have an opening snap that is found in mitral stenosis.Mid-diastolicCarey-CoombsmurmurA mid-diastolic murmur over the left ventricular impulse due to mitral valvulitis from acute rheumatic fever.Late diastolicTimeConditionDescriptionLate diastolic (presystolic)Complete heart blockA short late diastolic murmur can occasionally be heard (Rytand's murmur).Mid-systolic ejectionTimeConditionDescriptionMid-systolicejectionAortic outflow obstruction (Aortic Stenosis)Can be due to aortic valve stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with a harsh and rough quality.**Valvular aortic stenosis can produce a harsh, or even a musical murmur over the right second intercostal space which radiates into the neck over the two carotid arteries. The most common cause of AS (Aortic Stenosis) is calcified valves due to aging. The second most common cause is congenital bicuspid aortic valves (normal valve is tricuspid). In aortic stenosis, heaving apical impulse is present. The distinguishing feature between these two causes is that bicuspid AS has little or no radiation. It can be confirmed if it also has an aortic ejection sound, a short early diastolic murmur, and normal carotid pulse. The murmur in valvular AS decreases with standing and straining with Valsalva maneuver.** Supravalvular aortic stenosis is loudest at a point slightly higher than in that of valvular AS and may radiate more to the right carotid artery **Subvalvular aortic stenosis is usually due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with murmur loudest over the left sternal border or the apex. The murmur in HCM increases in intensity with a standing position as well as straining with Valsalva maneuver.Mid-systolic ejectionPulmonic outflow obstruction (Pulmonary Stenosis)A harsh murmur usually on left second intercostal space radiating to left neck and accompanied by palpable thrill. It can be distinguished from a VSD (Ventricular septal defect) by listening to the S2, which is normal in VSD but it is widely split in pulmonary stenosis. However, VSD is almost always pansystolic where the murmur of pulmonary stenosis is diamond-shaped and ends clearly before S2. Many innocent murmurs also arise from this location but SI and S2 must split normally.Mid-systolicejectionDilation of aortic root or pulmonary arteryProduces an ejection sound, with a short ejection systolic murmur and a relatively wide split S2. There is no hemodynamic abnormality. This is similar to pulmonary hypertension except the latter has hemodynamic instabilities.Mid-systolicejectionIncreased semilunar blood flowThis can occur in situations such as anemia, pregnancy, or hyperthyroidism.Mid-systolicejectionAortic valve sclerosisThis is due to degenerative thickening of the roots of the aortic cusps but produces no obstruction and no hemodynamic instability and thus should be differentiated from aortic stenosis. It is heard over right second intercostal space writh a normal carotid pulse and normal S2.Mid-systolicejectionInnocent midsystolic murmursThese murmurs are not accompanied by other abnormal findings. One example of a benign paediatric heart murmur is Still's murmur in children.Late systolicTimeConditionDescription This is the most common cause of late systolic murmurs. It can be heard best over the apex of the heart, usually preceded by clicks. The most common cause of mitral valve prolapse is \"floppy\" valve (Barlow's) syndrome. If the prolapse becomes severe enough, mitral regurgitation may occur. Any maneuver that decreases leftLate systolicMitral valve prolapseventricular volume -- such as standing, sitting, Valsalva maneuver, and amyl nitrate inhalation -- can produce earlier onset of dicks, longer murmur duration, and decreased murmur intensity'. Any maneuver that increases left ventricular volume -- such as squatting, elevation of legs, hand grip, and phenylephrine -- can delay the onset of clicks, shorten murmur duration, and increase murmur intensity.Late systolicTricuspid valve prolapseUncommon without concomitant mitral valve prolapse. Best heard over left lowrer sternal border.Late systolicPapillary muscle dysfunctionUsually due to acute myocardial infarction or ischemia, which causes mild mitral regurgitation.Holosystolic (pansystolic)TimeConditionDescriptionHolosystolic(pansystolic)TricuspidinsufficiencyIntensifies upon inspiration. Can be best heard over the fourth left sternal border. The intensity can be accentuated following inspiration (Carvallo's sign) due to increased regurgitant floiv in right ventricular volume. Tricuspid regurgitation is most often secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Primary tricuspid regurgitation is less common and can be due to bacterial endocarditis following IV drug use, Ebstein s anomaly, carcinoid disease, or prior right ventricular infarction.Holosystolic(pansystolic)Mitral regurgitationThe S1 is generally absent, soft, or buried in the holosystolic murmur of chronic MR. In patients with severe MR, the aortic valve may close prematurely, resulting in wide but physiologic splitting of S2. A lowT-pitched S.. occurring 0.12-0.17 s after the aortic valve closure sound. It may be followed by a short, rumbling, middiastolic murmur, even in the absence of MS. A fourth heart sound is often audible in patients with acute severe MR who are in sinus rhythm. A presystolic murmur is not ordinarily heard with isolated MR. A systolic murmur of at least grade III/VI intensity is the most characteristic auscultatory finding in chronic severe MR. It is usually holosystolic, but as previously noted it is decrescendo and ceases in mid- to late systole in patients with acute severe MR. The systolic murmur of chronic MR not due to MVP is intensified by isometric exercise (handgrip) but is reduced during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver.Holosystolic (pan systolic)Ventricular septal defectNo intensification upon inspiration. VSD is a defect in the ventricular wall, producing a shunt between the left and right ventricles. Since the L ventricle has a higher pressure than the R ventricle, flow during systole occurs from the L to R ventricle, producing the holosystolic murmur. It can be best heard over the left third and fourth intercostal spaces and along the sternal border. It is associated with normal pulmonary artery pressure and thus S2 is normal. This fact can be used to distinguish from pulmonary stenosis, which has a wide splitting S2. When the shunt becomes reversed (\"Eisenmenger syndrome7'), the murmur may be absent and S2 can become markedly accentuated and single.

This phenomenon is characteristic of the murmur of AR. Murmurs of right-sided origin, such as tricuspid or pulmonic regurgitation, increase in intensity during inspiration. The intensity of left-sided murmurs either remains constant or decreases with inspiration. Normal Physiologic Splitting Wkide physiologic splittingPhysiologic but wide splitting diving the respiratory cycle implies either premature aortic valve closure, as can occur with severe MR, or delayed pulmonic valve closure due to PS or right bundle branch block.Reversed splittingReversed splitting can be a feature of severe AS, HOCM, left bundle branch block, right ventricular apical pacing, or acute myocardial ischemia.Narrow physiologic splitting (|P2)Narrow physiologic splitting occurs in pulmonary hypertension, and both A2 and P2 are heard during expiration at a narrow splitting interval because of the increased intensity and high - frequency composition of P2Mild Vs Severe MSMild MSIn mild MS, the dtastoiic gradient across the valve is limited to the phases of rapid ventneutar filling in early diastole and presystole. The rumble may occur during either or both periods.In severe MS, a large pressure gradient exists across the valve during the entire diastolic filling, and the rumble persists throughout diastole. As the left atrial pressure becomes greater, the Interval between A2 [or P2) and the opening snap (O.S.) shortens. Secondary pulmonary hypertension develops and results In a loud P? and the splitting Interval usually narrows.ECGSevere MS",

The radiation is typically toward the apex. The configuration is usually decrescendo and has a blowing character. The presence of this murmur is a good positive predictor for AR and the absence of this murmur strongly suggests the absence of AR. An Austin Flint murmur is usually associated with significant aortic regurgitation.Early diastolicPulmonaryregurgitationPulmonary regurgitation is most commonly due to pulmonaryhypertension (Graham-Steell murmur). It is a high-pitched and blowing murmur with a decrescendo configuration. It may increase in intensity during inspiration and best heard over left second and third intercostal spaces. The murmur usually does not extend to SI.Early diastolicLeft anterior descending artery stenosisThis murmur, also known as Dock s murmur, is similar to that of aortic regurgitation and is heard at the left second or third intercostal space. A Coronary artery bypass surgery can eliminate the murmur.Mid-diastolicTimeConditionDescriptionMid-diastolicMitral stenosisThe first heart sound (S,) is usually accentuated and slightly delayed. The pulmonic component of the second heart sound (P,,) also is often accentuated, and the two components of the second heart sound (S,,) are closely split. The opening snap(OS) of the mitral valve is most readily audible in expiration at, or just medial to the cardiac apex. This sound generally follows the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) by 0.05-0.12 s. The time interval between A2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent positionMid-diastolicTricuspid stenosisBest heard over the left sternal border with rumbling character and tricuspid opening snap with wide splitting SI. May increase in intensity with inspiration (Carvallos sign). Tricuspid stenosis often occurs in association with mitral stenosis. Isolated TS are often associated with carcinoid disease and right atrial myxoma.Mid-diastolicAtrial myxomaAtrial myxomas are benign tumors of the heart. Left myxomas are far more common than right myxomas and those may cause obstruction of the mitral valve producing a mid-diastolic murmur similar to that of mitral stenosis. An echocardiographic evaluation is necessary.Mid-diastolicIncreased flow across the atrioventricular valveThis can also produce a mid-diastolic murmur, such as in severe mitral regurgitation where a large regurgitant volume in the left atrium can lead to \"functional mitral stenosis.\"Mid-diastolicAustin Flint murmurAn apical diastolic rumbling murmur in patients with pure aortic regurgitation. This can be mistaken with the murmur in mitral stenosis and should be noted by the fact that an Austin Flint murmur does not have an opening snap that is found in mitral stenosis.Mid-diastolicCarey-CoombsmurmurA mid-diastolic murmur over the left ventricular impulse due to mitral valvulitis from acute rheumatic fever.Late diastolicTimeConditionDescriptionLate diastolic (presystolic)Complete heart blockA short late diastolic murmur can occasionally be heard (Rytand's murmur).Mid-systolic ejectionTimeConditionDescriptionMid-systolicejectionAortic outflow obstruction (Aortic Stenosis)Can be due to aortic valve stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with a harsh and rough quality.**Valvular aortic stenosis can produce a harsh, or even a musical murmur over the right second intercostal space which radiates into the neck over the two carotid arteries. The most common cause of AS (Aortic Stenosis) is calcified valves due to aging. The second most common cause is congenital bicuspid aortic valves (normal valve is tricuspid). In aortic stenosis, heaving apical impulse is present. The distinguishing feature between these two causes is that bicuspid AS has little or no radiation. It can be confirmed if it also has an aortic ejection sound, a short early diastolic murmur, and normal carotid pulse. The murmur in valvular AS decreases with standing and straining with Valsalva maneuver.** Supravalvular aortic stenosis is loudest at a point slightly higher than in that of valvular AS and may radiate more to the right carotid artery **Subvalvular aortic stenosis is usually due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with murmur loudest over the left sternal border or the apex. The murmur in HCM increases in intensity with a standing position as well as straining with Valsalva maneuver.Mid-systolic ejectionPulmonic outflow obstruction (Pulmonary Stenosis)A harsh murmur usually on left second intercostal space radiating to left neck and accompanied by palpable thrill. It can be distinguished from a VSD (Ventricular septal defect) by listening to the S2, which is normal in VSD but it is widely split in pulmonary stenosis. However, VSD is almost always pansystolic where the murmur of pulmonary stenosis is diamond-shaped and ends clearly before S2. Many innocent murmurs also arise from this location but SI and S2 must split normally.Mid-systolicejectionDilation of aortic root or pulmonary arteryProduces an ejection sound, with a short ejection systolic murmur and a relatively wide split S2. There is no hemodynamic abnormality. This is similar to pulmonary hypertension except the latter has hemodynamic instabilities.Mid-systolicejectionIncreased semilunar blood flowThis can occur in situations such as anemia, pregnancy, or hyperthyroidism.Mid-systolicejectionAortic valve sclerosisThis is due to degenerative thickening of the roots of the aortic cusps but produces no obstruction and no hemodynamic instability and thus should be differentiated from aortic stenosis. It is heard over right second intercostal space writh a normal carotid pulse and normal S2.Mid-systolicejectionInnocent midsystolic murmursThese murmurs are not accompanied by other abnormal findings. One example of a benign paediatric heart murmur is Still's murmur in children.Late systolicTimeConditionDescription This is the most common cause of late systolic murmurs. It can be heard best over the apex of the heart, usually preceded by clicks. The most common cause of mitral valve prolapse is \"floppy\" valve (Barlow's) syndrome. If the prolapse becomes severe enough, mitral regurgitation may occur. Any maneuver that decreases leftLate systolicMitral valve prolapseventricular volume -- such as standing, sitting, Valsalva maneuver, and amyl nitrate inhalation -- can produce earlier onset of dicks, longer murmur duration, and decreased murmur intensity'. Any maneuver that increases left ventricular volume -- such as squatting, elevation of legs, hand grip, and phenylephrine -- can delay the onset of clicks, shorten murmur duration, and increase murmur intensity.Late systolicTricuspid valve prolapseUncommon without concomitant mitral valve prolapse. Best heard over left lowrer sternal border.Late systolicPapillary muscle dysfunctionUsually due to acute myocardial infarction or ischemia, which causes mild mitral regurgitation.Holosystolic (pansystolic)TimeConditionDescriptionHolosystolic(pansystolic)TricuspidinsufficiencyIntensifies upon inspiration. Can be best heard over the fourth left sternal border. The intensity can be accentuated following inspiration (Carvallo's sign) due to increased regurgitant floiv in right ventricular volume. Tricuspid regurgitation is most often secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Primary tricuspid regurgitation is less common and can be due to bacterial endocarditis following IV drug use, Ebstein s anomaly, carcinoid disease, or prior right ventricular infarction.Holosystolic(pansystolic)Mitral regurgitationThe S1 is generally absent, soft, or buried in the holosystolic murmur of chronic MR. In patients with severe MR, the aortic valve may close prematurely, resulting in wide but physiologic splitting of S2. A lowT-pitched S.. occurring 0.12-0.17 s after the aortic valve closure sound. It may be followed by a short, rumbling, middiastolic murmur, even in the absence of MS. A fourth heart sound is often audible in patients with acute severe MR who are in sinus rhythm. A presystolic murmur is not ordinarily heard with isolated MR. A systolic murmur of at least grade III/VI intensity is the most characteristic auscultatory finding in chronic severe MR. It is usually holosystolic, but as previously noted it is decrescendo and ceases in mid- to late systole in patients with acute severe MR. The systolic murmur of chronic MR not due to MVP is intensified by isometric exercise (handgrip) but is reduced during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver.Holosystolic (pan systolic)Ventricular septal defectNo intensification upon inspiration. VSD is a defect in the ventricular wall, producing a shunt between the left and right ventricles. Since the L ventricle has a higher pressure than the R ventricle, flow during systole occurs from the L to R ventricle, producing the holosystolic murmur. It can be best heard over the left third and fourth intercostal spaces and along the sternal border. It is associated with normal pulmonary artery pressure and thus S2 is normal. This fact can be used to distinguish from pulmonary stenosis, which has a wide splitting S2. When the shunt becomes reversed (\"Eisenmenger syndrome7'), the murmur may be absent and S2 can become markedly accentuated and single.

This phenomenon is characteristic of the murmur of AR. Murmurs of right-sided origin, such as tricuspid or pulmonic regurgitation, increase in intensity during inspiration. The intensity of left-sided murmurs either remains constant or decreases with inspiration. Normal Physiologic Splitting Wkide physiologic splittingPhysiologic but wide splitting diving the respiratory cycle implies either premature aortic valve closure, as can occur with severe MR, or delayed pulmonic valve closure due to PS or right bundle branch block.Reversed splittingReversed splitting can be a feature of severe AS, HOCM, left bundle branch block, right ventricular apical pacing, or acute myocardial ischemia.Narrow physiologic splitting (|P2)Narrow physiologic splitting occurs in pulmonary hypertension, and both A2 and P2 are heard during expiration at a narrow splitting interval because of the increased intensity and high - frequency composition of P2Mild Vs Severe MSMild MSIn mild MS, the dtastoiic gradient across the valve is limited to the phases of rapid ventneutar filling in early diastole and presystole. The rumble may occur during either or both periods.In severe MS, a large pressure gradient exists across the valve during the entire diastolic filling, and the rumble persists throughout diastole. As the left atrial pressure becomes greater, the Interval between A2 [or P2) and the opening snap (O.S.) shortens. Secondary pulmonary hypertension develops and results In a loud P? and the splitting Interval usually narrows.ECGSevere MS",

This can be mistaken with the murmur in mitral stenosis and should be noted by the fact that an Austin Flint murmur does not have an opening snap that is found in mitral stenosis.Mid-diastolicCarey-CoombsmurmurA mid-diastolic murmur over the left ventricular impulse due to mitral valvulitis from acute rheumatic fever.Late diastolicTimeConditionDescriptionLate diastolic (presystolic)Complete heart blockA short late diastolic murmur can occasionally be heard (Rytand's murmur).Mid-systolic ejectionTimeConditionDescriptionMid-systolicejectionAortic outflow obstruction (Aortic Stenosis)Can be due to aortic valve stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with a harsh and rough quality.**Valvular aortic stenosis can produce a harsh, or even a musical murmur over the right second intercostal space which radiates into the neck over the two carotid arteries. The most common cause of AS (Aortic Stenosis) is calcified valves due to aging. The second most common cause is congenital bicuspid aortic valves (normal valve is tricuspid). In aortic stenosis, heaving apical impulse is present. The distinguishing feature between these two causes is that bicuspid AS has little or no radiation. It can be confirmed if it also has an aortic ejection sound, a short early diastolic murmur, and normal carotid pulse. The murmur in valvular AS decreases with standing and straining with Valsalva maneuver.** Supravalvular aortic stenosis is loudest at a point slightly higher than in that of valvular AS and may radiate more to the right carotid artery **Subvalvular aortic stenosis is usually due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), with murmur loudest over the left sternal border or the apex. The murmur in HCM increases in intensity with a standing position as well as straining with Valsalva maneuver.Mid-systolic ejectionPulmonic outflow obstruction (Pulmonary Stenosis)A harsh murmur usually on left second intercostal space radiating to left neck and accompanied by palpable thrill. It can be distinguished from a VSD (Ventricular septal defect) by listening to the S2, which is normal in VSD but it is widely split in pulmonary stenosis. However, VSD is almost always pansystolic where the murmur of pulmonary stenosis is diamond-shaped and ends clearly before S2. Many innocent murmurs also arise from this location but SI and S2 must split normally.Mid-systolicejectionDilation of aortic root or pulmonary arteryProduces an ejection sound, with a short ejection systolic murmur and a relatively wide split S2. There is no hemodynamic abnormality. This is similar to pulmonary hypertension except the latter has hemodynamic instabilities.Mid-systolicejectionIncreased semilunar blood flowThis can occur in situations such as anemia, pregnancy, or hyperthyroidism.Mid-systolicejectionAortic valve sclerosisThis is due to degenerative thickening of the roots of the aortic cusps but produces no obstruction and no hemodynamic instability and thus should be differentiated from aortic stenosis. It is heard over right second intercostal space writh a normal carotid pulse and normal S2.Mid-systolicejectionInnocent midsystolic murmursThese murmurs are not accompanied by other abnormal findings. One example of a benign paediatric heart murmur is Still's murmur in children.Late systolicTimeConditionDescription This is the most common cause of late systolic murmurs. It can be heard best over the apex of the heart, usually preceded by clicks. The most common cause of mitral valve prolapse is \"floppy\" valve (Barlow's) syndrome. If the prolapse becomes severe enough, mitral regurgitation may occur. Any maneuver that decreases leftLate systolicMitral valve prolapseventricular volume -- such as standing, sitting, Valsalva maneuver, and amyl nitrate inhalation -- can produce earlier onset of dicks, longer murmur duration, and decreased murmur intensity'. Any maneuver that increases left ventricular volume -- such as squatting, elevation of legs, hand grip, and phenylephrine -- can delay the onset of clicks, shorten murmur duration, and increase murmur intensity.Late systolicTricuspid valve prolapseUncommon without concomitant mitral valve prolapse. Best heard over left lowrer sternal border.Late systolicPapillary muscle dysfunctionUsually due to acute myocardial infarction or ischemia, which causes mild mitral regurgitation.Holosystolic (pansystolic)TimeConditionDescriptionHolosystolic(pansystolic)TricuspidinsufficiencyIntensifies upon inspiration. Can be best heard over the fourth left sternal border. The intensity can be accentuated following inspiration (Carvallo's sign) due to increased regurgitant floiv in right ventricular volume. Tricuspid regurgitation is most often secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Primary tricuspid regurgitation is less common and can be due to bacterial endocarditis following IV drug use, Ebstein s anomaly, carcinoid disease, or prior right ventricular infarction.Holosystolic(pansystolic)Mitral regurgitationThe S1 is generally absent, soft, or buried in the holosystolic murmur of chronic MR. In patients with severe MR, the aortic valve may close prematurely, resulting in wide but physiologic splitting of S2. A lowT-pitched S.. occurring 0.12-0.17 s after the aortic valve closure sound. It may be followed by a short, rumbling, middiastolic murmur, even in the absence of MS. A fourth heart sound is often audible in patients with acute severe MR who are in sinus rhythm. A presystolic murmur is not ordinarily heard with isolated MR. A systolic murmur of at least grade III/VI intensity is the most characteristic auscultatory finding in chronic severe MR. It is usually holosystolic, but as previously noted it is decrescendo and ceases in mid- to late systole in patients with acute severe MR. The systolic murmur of chronic MR not due to MVP is intensified by isometric exercise (handgrip) but is reduced during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver.Holosystolic (pan systolic)Ventricular septal defectNo intensification upon inspiration. VSD is a defect in the ventricular wall, producing a shunt between the left and right ventricles. Since the L ventricle has a higher pressure than the R ventricle, flow during systole occurs from the L to R ventricle, producing the holosystolic murmur. It can be best heard over the left third and fourth intercostal spaces and along the sternal border. It is associated with normal pulmonary artery pressure and thus S2 is normal. This fact can be used to distinguish from pulmonary stenosis, which has a wide splitting S2. When the shunt becomes reversed (\"Eisenmenger syndrome7'), the murmur may be absent and S2 can become markedly accentuated and single.

This phenomenon is characteristic of the murmur of AR. Murmurs of right-sided origin, such as tricuspid or pulmonic regurgitation, increase in intensity during inspiration. The intensity of left-sided murmurs either remains constant or decreases with inspiration. Normal Physiologic Splitting Wkide physiologic splittingPhysiologic but wide splitting diving the respiratory cycle implies either premature aortic valve closure, as can occur with severe MR, or delayed pulmonic valve closure due to PS or right bundle branch block.Reversed splittingReversed splitting can be a feature of severe AS, HOCM, left bundle branch block, right ventricular apical pacing, or acute myocardial ischemia.Narrow physiologic splitting (|P2)Narrow physiologic splitting occurs in pulmonary hypertension, and both A2 and P2 are heard during expiration at a narrow splitting interval because of the increased intensity and high - frequency composition of P2Mild Vs Severe MSMild MSIn mild MS, the dtastoiic gradient across the valve is limited to the phases of rapid ventneutar filling in early diastole and presystole. The rumble may occur during either or both periods.In severe MS, a large pressure gradient exists across the valve during the entire diastolic filling, and the rumble persists throughout diastole. As the left atrial pressure becomes greater, the Interval between A2 [or P2) and the opening snap (O.S.) shortens. Secondary pulmonary hypertension develops and results In a loud P? and the splitting Interval usually narrows.",
