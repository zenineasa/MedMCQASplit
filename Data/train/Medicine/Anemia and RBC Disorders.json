Erythropoietin enhances the growth and differentiation of erythropoietin progenitors. With increasing renal dysfunction decreased level of erythropoietin are produced resulting in progressive anemia, o The primary therapeutic options for anemia of chronic kidney disease areo Red blood cell transfusionso Erythropoietin stimulating agentso Androgen (to a much lesser degree)o Erythropoietin administration is considered the mainstay of the treatment of anemia of chronic disease in renal failure. The administration of erythropoietin stimulating agent is particularly attractive because they have substantially reduced the need for red cell transfusion with an attendant decrease in and for risk for transfusion related complications.# The erythropoietin deficiency can be corrected by the exogenous administration of erythropoietin stimulating agents. Two such agents available in the united states. Epoetin afla (recombinant human erythropoietin). Darbepoetin alfa. Epoetin alfa (recombinant human erythropoietin E. P. O.)o Provides effective treatment for anemia in patients, when administered, once weekly Has become standard care. o However, one problem with epoeitin alfa is that the need for the weekly dose can place a considerable burden on both patients and healthcare staff. Darbepoetin alfao Another erythropoiesis stimulator i. e. darbepoeitin alfa can provide an alternative as it has three fold longer half life. o The dose of darbepoeitin can be scheduled once weekly or twice weekly or may be monthly. Peginasatideo It is a synthetic peptide that activates EPO receptor. Peginesatide stimulates erythroid colony growth, reticulocyte count and hematocrii. Red blood cell transfusionso RBC transfusion are universally sussessful in raising hemoglobin levels. o Transfusions often can ameliorate the patient s symptoms and improve health related quality of life. o However they may be associated with significant complications that include transfusion transmitted infection, immunological sensif cation, iron overload syndromes volume overload! transfusion reactions.

The response to iron therapy varies, depending on the erythropoietin stimulus and the rate of absorption. The reticulocyte count should begin to increase within 4-7 days after initiation of therapy and peak at 7-10 days. The absence of a response may be due to poor absorption, noncompliance {which is common}, or a confounding diagnosis. A useful test in the clinic to determine the patient's ability to absorb iron is the iron tolerance test. Two iron tablets are given to the patient on an empty stomach, and the serum iron is measured serially over the subsequent 2 hours.

        "question": "With regards to G6. PD deficiency, which of the following in false-",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., X-linked recessive disorder that does not affect heterozygous famaleso Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6. PD) deficiency, an X-linked disorder, is the most common enzymatic disorder of red blood cells in humans, affecting 400 million people worldwide. Clinical spectrumo The clinical expression of G6. PD variants encompasses a spectrum of hemolytic syndromes. o The four forms of symptomatic G6. PD deficiency: Acute hemolytic anemia. Favism. Congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemiao G6. PD deficiency is expressed in males carrying a variant gene that results in sufficient enzyme deficiency to lead to symptoms. Acute hemolytic anemiao Almost all individuals with the most prevalent G6. PD variants, G6. PD A- and G6. PD Mediterranean, are asymptomatic in the steady state. o They have neither anemia, evidence of increased red cell destruction, nor an alteration in blood morphology',. o However sudden destruction of enzyme deficient erythrocytes can be triggered by certain drugs or chemicals, by selected infections, and rarely by metabolic abnormalities (eg, diabetic ketoacidosis). Clinical course. At two to four days after drug ingestion, there is the sudden onset of jaundice, pallor, and dark urine, with or without abdominal and back pain. This is associated with an abrupt fall in the hemoglobin concentration of 3 to 4 g/dL, during which time the peripheral blood smear reveals red cell fragments, microspherocytes, and eccentrocytes or \"bite\" cells. The anemia induces an appropriate stimulation of erythropoiesis, characterized by an increase in reticulocytes that is apparent within five days and is maximal at 7 to 10 days after the onset of hemolysis. Even with continued drug exposure, the acute hemolytic process ends after about one week, with ultimate reversal of the anemia. Inciting eventso Patients with class II or III variants develop intermittent hemolysis only after one or more of the following inciting events. Infection. Oxidant drugs. Chemical agents (eg, moth balls, aniline dyes, henna compounds). Diabetic ketoacidosis. Ingestion of fava beans. Drugs and chemicals. Primaquine, dapsone, and a number of other drugs can precipitate hemolysis in G6. PD deficient subjects. Foods: fava beans and bitter melon. G6. PD deficiency can also be precipitated by the the ingestion offresh fava beans (favism). Manifestation of favism begins 5-24 hrs after fava bean ingestion and include headache, nausea, back pain. Congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. Patients with class I G6. PD variants have such severe G6. PD deficiency that lifelong hemolysis occurs in the absence of infection or drug exposure. Such patients fall under the category of having congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. These G6. PD variants have low in vitro activity and/or marked instability of the molecide, and most have DNA mutations at the glucose--6-phosphate or NADP binding sites. These sites are central to the function of G6. PD, which oxidizes glucose-6-phosphate and reduces NADP to NADPH. It is presumed that the functional defect is so severe that the red cells cannot withstand even the normal oxidative stresses encountered in the circulation. Anemia and jaundice are often first noted in the newborn period, and the degree of hyperbilirubinemia is frequently of sufficient severity to require exchange transfusion. After infancy, hemolytic manifestations are subtle and inconstant. Most individuals have mild to moderate anemia (hemoglobin 8 to 10 g/dL) with a reticulocyte count of 10 to 15 percent. Pallor is uncommon, scleral icterus is intermittent, splenomegaly is rare, and splenectomy generally is of little benefit. Hemolysis can be exaggerated by exposure to drugs or chemicals with oxidant potential or exposure to fava beans. Some drugs with relatively mild oxidant potential that are safe in patients with class II or class III G6. PD variants may increase hemolysis in patients with class I variants. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemiay The clinical picture of neonatal jaundice due to G6. PD deficiency differs from neonatal jaundice seen in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) associated with Rh(D) incompatibility in two main respects. G6. PD deficiency-related neonatal jaundice is rarely present at birth; the peak incidence of clinical onset is between days ftvo and three. There is more jaundice than anemia, and the anemia is rarely severe. The severity ofjaundice varies widely, from being subclinical to imposing the threat of kemicterus if not treated.",

Explanation:\"The common feature of all megaloblastic anemias is a defect in DNA synthesis that affects rapidly dividing cells in the hone marrow\" Ref: Harrison. Causes of Megaloblastic Anemia* Vitamin B12. Cobalamin deficiency or abnormalities of cobalamin metabolism. Folate deficiency or abnormalities of folate metabolism. Therapy with antifolate drugs (e. g., methotrexate). Independent of either cobalamin or folate deficiency and refractory to cobalamin and folate therapy: Acute myeloid leukemia. Myelodysplasia. Therapy with drugs interfering with synthesis of DNA Orotic aciduria (responds to uridine) Thiamine-responsive Megaloblastic anemia. Biochemical Basis of Megaloblastic Anemia. Folates (as the intracellular polyglutamate derivatives) aet as coenzymes in the transfer of single-carbon units. Two of these reactions are involved in purine synthesis and one in pyrimidine synthesis necessary for DNA and RNA replication. Folate is also a coenzyme for methionine synthesis, in which methylcohalamin is also involved and in which THE is regenerated. THF is the acceptor of single carbon units newly entering the active pool via conversion of serine to glycine. Methionine, the other produet of the methionine synthase reaction, is the precursor for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor involved in >100 methyltransferase reactions. The common feature of all megaloblastic anemias is a defect in DNA synthesis that affects rapidly dividing cells in the bone marrow. All conditions that give rise to megaloblastic changes have in common a disparity in the rate of synthesis or availability of the four immediate precursors of DNAIn deficiencies of either folate or cobalamin. there is failure to convert deoxyuridine monophosphate (d. UMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (d. TMP), the precursor of d. TTPThis is the ease because folate is needed as the coenzyme 5, 10-methylene-THE polyglutamate for conversion of d. UMP to d. TMP: the availability of 5, 10-methylene-THF is reduced in either cobalamin or folate deficiency.",

The most common aetiological agent that induces Aplastic Crisis in patients with Hereditary Spherocytosis is Parvovirus B19o Hereditary spherocytosis usually has autosomal dominant inheritance caused bv mutation in senes for proteins such as. spectrin, ankrin or handj, The genes responsible for HS include akyrin, b spectrin, band-3-protein, a-spectrin, and protein 4. 2. In approximately two-thirds to three-quarter of HS patients, inheritance is autosomal dominant. In the remaining patients, inheritance is non-dominant due to autosomal recessive inheritance of a de novo mutation. o In patients with hereditary spherocytosis Red blood cells are destroyed in the spleeny The spleen plays a critical role in the pathobiology of HS, as destruction of spherocytes in the spleen is the primary cause of hemolysis in HS patients. o Aplastic Crisis is an Uncommon Complication. Aplastic crisis following virally induced bone marrow suppression are uncommon, but may result in severe anemia with serious complications including congestive heart failure or even death. The most common aetiological agent in these cases is parvovirus BI9. Parvovirus selectively infects erythropoietic progenitor cells and inhibits their growth.",
