        "exp": "The treatment for hyperkalemia can be thought of in 3 distinct steps. First, antagonize the effects of hyperkalemia at the cellular level (membrane stabilization). Second, decrease serum potassium levels by promoting the influx of potassium into cells throughout the body. (insulin, beta2 agonist) Third, remove potassium from the body. (k+resins) In cells with calcium-dependent action potentials, such as SA and atrioventricular nodal cells, and in cells in which the sodium current is depressed, an increase in extracellular calcium concentration will increase the magnitude of the calcium inward current and the Vmax by increasing the electrochemical gradient across the myocyte. This would be expected to speed impulse propagation in such tissues, reversing the myocyte depression seen with severe hyperkalemia. The effects of intravenous calcium occur within 1 to 3 minutes but last for only 30 to 60 minutes. Therefore, fuher, more definitive treatment is needed to lower serum potassium levels. Calcium gluconate is the preferred preparation of intravenous calcium. The dose should be 10 mL of a 10% calcium gluconate solution infused over 2 to 3 minutes.",

Variation in amplitude of QRS complexes which indicates a diagnosis of polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia. In acute setting DC shock 200 J Biphasic should be given.
