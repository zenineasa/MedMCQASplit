        "question": "A 30 year old male was brought to the ER after a car crash. On admission, pulse is weak with BP=80/60 mm. Hg. ECG is shown below. Right heart catheter is placed. Which is the most consistent value with patient's diagnosis?",
        "exp": "The ECG shows HR of 125bpm with variation in amplitude of QRS. This occurs when there is large amount of fluid in pericardial sac, which in the setting of trauma is patient's own blood. The ECG and clinical history points to diagnosis of Cardiac Tamponade. It is characterised by diastolic collapse of ventricles. Hence the PCWP will be equal to pulmonary aery diastolic pressure. This in turn will be equal to right atrial pressure.",

        "question": "A 46 year old man presents with diffuse chest pain at rest and recent history of cough, fever and rhinorrhea lasting for 3 days. ECG shows?",
        "exp": "Sinus rhythm at approx. 75 beats/min. PR interval is prolonged to 200 msec. The QRS axis and intervals are normal. ST elevations with concave upward morphology are seen in I and a. VL, II and a. VF, and V2 through V6. The upward concavity of the ST segment, the PR-segment depression, the lack of Q waves, and the diffuse nature of the ST-segment elevation in more than one coronary aery distribution make pericarditis the likely etiology. Patients with pericarditis will complain of chest pain, typically described as sharp and pleuritic. Radiation of the pain is towards trapezius ridge. The pain is improved with sitting up and leaning forward and worsened by leaning backward.",
