For the majority of patients with ESRD, between 9 and 12 h of dialysis are required each week, usually divided into three equal sessions. Current Targets of Hemodialysis* Urea reduction ratio (the fractional reduction in blood urea nitrogen per hemodialysis session) of >65-70%.* Body water-indexed clearance x time product (KT/V) above 1. 2 or 1. 05. REMEMBERHypotension is the most common acute complication of hemodialysis. Since the introduction of bicarbonate- containing dialysate, dialysis-associated hypotension has become less common. The management of hypotension during dialysis consists of discontinuing ultrafiltration, the administration of 100-250 mL of isotonic saline or 10 mL of 23% saturated hypertonic saline, or administration of salt-poor albumin.",
