A considerable amount of evidence suppos this intensive treatment approach. As mentioned earlier, methotrexate is the DMADRD of the first choice for initial treatment of moderate to severe RA. Failure to achieve adequate improvement with methotrexate therapy calls for a change in DMARD therapy, usually a transition to an effective combination regimen. Effective combination include: methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine (oral triple therapy); methotrexate and leflunomide; and methotrexate plus a biological. The combination of methotrexate and an anti-TNF agent, for example, has been shown in randomized, controlled trails to be superior to methotrexate alone not only reducing signs and symptoms of disease, but also for retarding the progression of structural joint damage.",
