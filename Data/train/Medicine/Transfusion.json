Pauci immune glomerulonephritis. Poison elimination Treatment of T. T. PPlasmapheresis is the mainstay of therapy for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The therapy of Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is based on intensive plasmapheresis coupled with infusion of fresh frozen plasma. Therapy removes abnormal forms of VWF, lower the concentration of ADAMTS13 inhibitor and replenish the deficient enzyme. Overall mortality is markedly reduced and majority of patients with T. T. P recover. Most of the patients survive the acute illness, recover completely with no residual renal or neurologic disease. Plasmapheresis has also been used in hemolytic uremic syndrome but it not been as successful as T. T. P. Management of Hemolytic uremic syndrome early dialysis. For acute renal failure and general supportive care including t/t of hypertension. Refractory cases. Vincristine or cyclosporine Steroids and Antiplatelet agents.

        "question": "Transfusion of stored blood causes: (Repeat)",
        "exp": "Ref: Harrison's 18th edition. Explanation: The two important electrolyte disturbances caused by transfusion of stored blood are. Hyperkalemia. Hypocalcemia. RBC leakage during storage increases the concentration of potassium in the unit. Neonates and patients in renal failure are at risk for hyperkalemia. Preventive measures, such as using fresh or washed RBCs. are warranted for neonatal transfusions because this complication can be fatal. Citrate, commonly used to anticoagulate blood components, chelates calcium and thereby inhibits the coagulation cascade. Hypocalcemia, manifested by circumoral numbness and tingling sensation of the fingers and toes, may result from multiple rapid transfusions. Because citrate is quickly metabolized to bicarbonate, calcium infusion is seldom required in this setting. If calcium or any other intravenous infusion is necessary, it must be given through a separate tine.",
