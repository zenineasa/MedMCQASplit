        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Metabolic acidosis The question is most probably about complications of massive blood transfusion. Massive Blood Transfusion * Massive blood transfusion is generally defined as transfusion of one to two volumes of patient's own blood volumes (For most adults that is equivalent to 10-20 units.). Complications of Massive Blood Transfusion. Coagulopathy. The most common cause of bleeding following massive blood transfusion is dilutional thrombocytopenia. Clinically significant dilution of the coagulation factors is unusual in previously normal individuals. Citrate Toxicity. Citrate is used as an anticoagulant in the stored blood. Citrate has a property to bind calcium, this calcium binding by the citrate preservative can become significant following transfusion of large volumes of blood or blood products. Hypocalcemia results in some patients after massive transfusion, to prevent this, the transfusion rate should not exceed 1 unit every 5 minutes. Citrate also has an affinity for magnesium ion and the occurrence of hypomagnesemia in the setting of massive transfusion is seen (rarely). Hypothermia. Blood is stored at a temperature of 2degC-6degC. So massive blood transfusion can result in hypothermia. Massive blood transfusion is an absolute indication for warming all blood products and intravenous fluids to normal body temperature. Hypothermia due to massive transfusion can result in ventricular arrhythmia. Acid-Base Balance. The stored blood is acidic for two reasons. Due to the citric acid (the anticoagulants) Due to release of metabolic products by the anaerobic glycolysis of red cells (CO2 and Lactate). Despite the Stored Blood Being Acidic, Significant metabolic acidosis due to transfusion is not common.- Once the resuscitation is complete and normal perfusion is restored, any metabolic acidosis present, typically resolves, and progressive metabolic alkalosis supervenes as citrate and lactate contained in transfusion and resuscitation fluids are converted to bicarbonate by the liver. The most consistent acid base abnormality after massive blood transfusion is postoperative metabolic alkalosis. Serum Potassium Concentration. The extracellular concentration of Potassium in stored blood steadily increases with time due to lysis of RBC's. The amount of extracellular potassium transfused with each unit is typically less than 4m Eq per unit. Hyperkalemia can develop regardless of the age of the blood when transfusion rate exceeded 100ml/min. Oxygen Affinity Changes * 2, 3 DPG is greatly reduced in RBC's after about 3 weeks of storage, this increases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen and adversely affects oxygen delivery to tissues. Acute Respiration? Distress Syndrome. Coagulation Factor Depletion",

RBC leakage during storage increases the concentration of potassium in the unit. Neonates and patients in renal failure are at risk for hyperkalemia. Preventive measures, such as using fresh or washed RBCs. are warranted for neonatal transfusions because this complication can be fatal. Citrate, commonly used to anticoagulate blood components, chelates calcium and thereby inhibits the coagulation cascade. Hypocalcemia, manifested by circumoral numbness and tingling sensation of the fingers and toes, may result from multiple rapid transfusions. Because citrate is quickly metabolized to bicarbonate, calcium infusion is seldom required in this setting. If calcium or any other intravenous infusion is necessary, it must be given through a separate tine.",

Explanation: Allergic transfusion reactions occur on a continuum of severity ranging from mild (urticarial) to moderate (anaphylactoid) to severe (anaphylactic). Anaphylactic transfusion reactions are severe allergic reactions characterized by profound hypotension and shock. Causes of anaphylaxis include: Recipient IgE or IgG antibodies to IgA in patients who have complete or partial (i. e., lack an isotopic or allotypic) IgA determinant. Recipient IgE or IgG antibodies to polymorphic forms of other serum proteins (IgG. haptoglobin. C4, etc.) in transfused donor blood. Recipient sensitization to various compounds, including drugs in donor blood, chemicals used to produce or sterilize IV tubing and plastic bags, and foodstuffs. Coincidental reaction to drugs or food taken prior to transfusion. Ig A deficiency. In patients with IgA deficiency --Anti-IgA antibodies may develop after exposure to IgA in transfusions: anaphylactic reactions to IV immune globulin (IVIG) and other blood products that contain IgA may occur.
