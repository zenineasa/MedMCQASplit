Proliferative Lupus Nephritis CRDT2nd/490\"Several important trials conducted at the National Institutes of Health provided the rationale behind the current therapeutic regimens used to treat proliferative lupus nephritis. Key findings from these trials are as follows: (1) treatment with intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide (CYC) is superior to high-dose oral prednisone alone in preventing progression to end-stage renal disease, and (2) an extended course of CYC (six monthly pulses followed by quarterly pulses for 2 years) is more effective than pulse methylprednisolone and shorter courses of CYC in preserving renal function and preventing renal relapse. Thus the use of monthly intravenous pulse CYC (in conjunction with high-dose glucocorticoids) followed by quarterly pulse CYC became the standard of care in the community\"\"Data suggest that cyclophosphamide is effective in most patients with severe lupus nephritis over both the short and the long term; many experts believe that it should be included in initial therapeutic regimens in most SLEpatients with severe nephritis (or other life-threatening, rapidly progressive organ involvement). IV cyclophosphamide is effective in some patients with serious extra re nai manifestations of. SLE, including diffuse CSS disease, thrombocytopenia, and interstitial pulmonary inflam motion\"- Kelly Textbook of Rheumatology 7th/548. SLE Harrison 17th/2080-82. Cytotoxic/immunosiippressive agents added to glucocorticoids are recommended to treat serious SLE. Almost all prospective controlled trials in SLE involving cytotoxic agents have been conducted in patients with lupus nephritis, and always in combination with glucocorticoids. In patients whose renal biopsies show i. SN grade HI or IV disease, early treatment with combinations of glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide reduces progression to ESRD and improves survival. Prospective controlled trials in SLE but is nonetheless used by some clinicians. Since it has potential nephrotoxicity, but no hone marrow toxicity, the author uses it (in doses of 3-5 mg/kg per day PO) in patients with steroid-resistant cytopenias of SLE or in steroid-resistant patients who have developed bone marrow suppression from standard cytotoxic agents. it is important to note that there are few if any randomized, controlled, prospective studies of any agents in life- threatening SLE that does not include nephritis. Therefore, use of glucocorticoids plus cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate in other life-threatening conditions is based on studies in nephritis.",

It processes antigen and present it to T cells. Langerhans cells histiocytosis (LCH) is a clonal histiocytosis and the lesions are characterized by the presence of Langerhans cells, eosinophils and Lymphocytes in a variable number. The various features of Langerhans cells are: Presence of Birbeck granules (E/M - HX bodies). Presence of enzymes likea Naphthyl acetate esterasea Naphthyl butyrate esterase. Acid phosphatase.

A positive 1. GR. 4 result may not necessarily indicate active TB. and a negative IGRA result may not ride out active TB. o Because IGRAs are not affected by Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination status, IGRAs are useful for evaluation ofL TBI in BCG-vaccinated individuals, particularly in settings where BCG vaccination is administered after infancy or multiple (booster) BCG vaccinations are given. Assay antigenso M. tuberculosis-specific antigens include:-# Early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) and# Culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10). o These are encoded by genes located within the region of difference 1 (RD1) segment of the M. tuberculosis genome. o They are more specific for M. tuberculosis than purified protein derivative (PPD) because they are not shared with any BCG vaccine strains or most species of NTM other than M. marinum, M kansasii, M. szulgai, and M. flavescens. Types of assayso Two IGRAs are available in many countries:-The Quanti. FERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay, which has replaced the second-generation Quantiferon- TB Gold (QFT-G) assay, and the T-SPOT. TB assay. o The QFT-GIT assay is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based, whole-blood test that uses peptides from three TB antigens i. e., ESAT-6. CFP-10, and. TB 7. 7) in an in-tube formato The result is reported as quantification of interferon (IFN)-gamma in international units (IU) per mL. o A newer assay, the Quanti. FEROM-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus), became available in 2015. This test is available in Europe but not in North America. The QFT-Plus assay has m-o TB antigen tubes, unlike the QFT assay (which has a single TB antigen tube). Sensitivity and specificityo IGRAs have specificity >95 percent for diagnosis oflatent TB infection. The sensitivity for T-SPOT. TB appears to be higher than for QFT-GIT or TST (approximately 90, 80, and 80 percent, respectively). The higher sensitivity of T-SPOT. TB may be useful for evaluating individuals with immunosuppressive conditions. o TST specificity is high in populations not vaccinated with BCG (97 percent). Among populations where BCG is administered, it is much lower although variable (approximately 60 percent).",

        "question": "Heavy chain disease with kapppa light chains in urine-",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Mu chain disease o The heavy chain diseases are rare B cell proliferative disorders characterized by the production of a monoclonal (M) protein consisting of a portion of the immunoglobulin heavy chain without a bound light chain. The heavy chain in heavy chain disease is often incomplete or truncated and a sharp, localized peak may not be seen on the electrophoretic tracing of serum or urine. o Three types of heavy chain disease (HCD) are recognized, based upon the class of immunoglobulin heavy chain produced (eg, alpha, gamma, mu) by the malignant cell. o Alpha HCD is:# A form of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma that is also called immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (IPSID)# Mediterranean lymphoma or# Seligmann diseaseo Gamma HCD (Franklin's disease) is:# Typically associated with the presence of a systemic lymphoma# Often of mixed lymphoid-plasmacytic character. o Mu HCD has:# Clinical features resembling small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia, often with distinctive vacuolated lymphocytes/plasma cells in the bone marrow. Pathophysiologyo The normal immunoglobulin molecule:# The immunoglobulin molecule is composed of two heavy and two light chains Joined by disulfide bonds. The normal heavy chain constant region (CH region) has a number of domains, of which CH1 is responsible for light chain binding. In the absence of an associated light chain, the CHI domain binds to heat shock protein 78 (heavy chain binding protein, BiP), and the heavy chain undergoes proteasomal degradation rather than secretion. As a result, normal heavy chains without light chains are not detected in the serum. o The abnormal heavy chain in HCD:# In the heavy chain diseases, noncontiguous deletions in the switch-CHl region prevent binding of the abnormal heavy chain to light chains as well as to heat shock protein 78, thereby avoiding proteasomal degradation. The heavy chains are then secreted into the plasma (or jejunal fluid in the case of alpha HCD) and, if small enough, may appear in the urine. Alpha HCDo Alpha HCD (also called immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (IPSID), Mediterranean lymphoma, Seligmann disease) is a form of MALT lymphoma, with the same histologic features of MALT type gastrointestinal lymphomas with marked plasma cell differentiation. o It is the most common form of HCD and occurs in patients from the Mediterranean region or Middle East, usually young males, and is often associated with relatively poor sanitation. o The gastrointestinal tract is involved in alpha HCD, resulting in abdominal pain, severe malabsorption with chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, and loss of weight. o Growth retardation (in children), digital clubbing, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy may also be present. o Infiltration of the jejunal mucosa with plasmacytoid cells is the most frequent pathologic feature. The duodenum and ileum are less often affected. o The diagnosis depends upon the recognition of a monoclonal alpha heavy chain without an associated light chain in the serum, urine, intestinal secretions, or cells infiltrating the intestinal mucosa. o The serum protein electrophoretic pattern is normal in one-half of cases, and in the remainder an unimpressive broad band may appear in the alpha-2 or beta mobility regions. o The amount of alpha heavy chain in the urine is small. o In the absence of therapy, alpha HCD typically is progressive and fatal. o The usual treatment is with antibiotics such as tetracyclines and eradication of any concurrent infection (eg, parasites, viruses, Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter jejuni). Gamma HCDo Typically present with systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and/or anemia, and occasionally with palatal and uvular swelling. o Median age of patients with gamma HCD is 60 to 70 years. o The clinical findings ranged from an asymptomatic state (eg, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, MGUS) to an aggressive lymphoproliferative process. o Autoimmune manifestations are seen in about one-third of patients (eg, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, hemolytic anemia, vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis). o Typically associated with a polymorphous infiltrate, including admixtures of lymphocytes, plasmacytoid lymphocytes, plasma cells, immunoblasts, and eosinophils. o Electrophoretic pattern often shows a broad-based band more suggestive of a polyclonal increase but the gamma chains are monoclonal. o Diagnosis is established by immunofixation, which shows that the abnormal protein consists only of gamma heavy chains without associated light chains. o The monoclonal gamma chains have significant deletions of amino acids, including the CH 1 domain of the constant region. o Treatment is indicated only for symptomatic patients.# Therapy has consisted of chemotherapy with varying combinations such as cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP), or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP regimen) or, if the abnormal cells express CD20, the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP). Mu. HCDo Mu HCD is the least common of the HCDs and is characterized by a monoclonal mu chain fragment in the serum. It has features resembling chronic lymphocyticleukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (eg, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly), although peripheral adenopathy is less common than in CLL. Osteolytic lesions or pathologic fractures have been reported in occasional patients. o Unlike alpha and gamma HCD, some patients with mu HCD have increased free light chain secretion (Bence Jones proteinuria), and may develop cast nephropathy or amyloidosis, o Common features include characteristic vacuolated plasma cells or lymphoid cells in the bone marrow and panhypogammaglobulinemia. o The serum protein electrophoretic pattern is usually normal except for hypogammaglobulinemia. o The course of mu HCD is variable, and survival ranges from a few months to many years. o Asymptomatic patients are observed without therapyo Symptomatic patients are treated similar to patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",

Explanation: Dietary copper deficiency is relatively rare, although it has been described in premature infants wdio are fed milk diets and in infants with malabsorption. Copper-deficiency anemia has been reported in patients with malabsorptive diseases and nephrotic syndrome and in patients treated for Wilson's disease with chronic high doses of oral zinc, which can interfere with copper absorption. Menkes' kinky hair syndrome is an X-linked metabolic disturbance of copper metabolism characterized by mental retardation, hypo- cupremia and decreased circulating ceruloplasmin. It is caused by mutations in the copper-transporting ATP7A gene. Children with this disease often die within 5 years because of dissecting aneurysms or cardiac rupture. Aceruloplasminemia is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by tissue iron overload, mental deterioration, microcytic anemia, and low serum iron and copper concentrations. The diagnosis of copper deficiency is usually made on the basis of low serum levels of copper (<65 microg/dL) and low ceruloplasmin levels (<20 mg/dL). Serum levels of copper may be elevated in pregnancy or stress conditions since ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant and 90% of circulating copper is bound to ceruloplasmin.",

In the absence of symptoms or findings to suggest one of the other conditions, laboratory tests that show a mild anemia, a positive HLA-B27 (present in 90% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis), an elevated sedimentation rate, and symmetrical sacroiliitis on x-ray would all be very supportive of the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis. The prognosis in ankylosing spondylitis is generally good, with only 6% dying of the disease itself. While pulmonary fibrosis and restrictive lung disease can occur, they are rarely a cause of death (cervical fracture, heart block, and amyloidosis are leading causes of death as a result of ankylosing spondylitis). The MRI described in answer a would be more suggestive of spinal tuberculosis (Pott disease) or metastatic cancer. Rheumatoid factor is negative in all the spondyloarthropathies as would be the anti-CCP test, although the C-reactive protein level could be elevated in any inflammatory condition. Joint space narrowing and osteophytes are the hallmarks of osteoarthritis which would be unusual in a young man.

Most common joint involved in gout: Meta-Tarso-Phalangeal joints. QPrecipitation of monosodium urate crystalsQ into the joints is the underlying basis for these urate crystals is increased total body urate levels. Diagnosis in a 40 years old man, who presents with acute onset pain and swelling of left great toe and punched out lesion of phalanx and overhanging edges on X-ray is gout. (AIIMS November 2013 repeat). Gout is a metabolic disease that most often affects middle- aged to elderly men and postmenopausal women. It results from an increased body pool of urate with hyperuricemia. It typically is characterized by episodic acute and chronic arthritis caused by deposition of MSU crystals in joints and connective tissue tophi and the risk for deposition in kidney interstitium or uric acid nephrolithiasis. Usually, only one joint is affected initially and the metatarsophalangeal joint of the first toe is the most commonly involved joint. '- Harrison 18/e p2837'Radiographic Features of Gout: Early in the disease radiographic studies may only confirm clinically evident swelling. Cystic changes, well-defined erosions with sclerotic margins (often with overhanging bony edges), and soft tissue masses are characteristic features of advanced chronic tophaceous gout. Ultrasound, CT and MRI are being studied and are likely to become more sensitive for early changes. - Harrison 18/e p2837'Tophi appear as characteristic punched-out cysts or deep erosions in the para-articular bone ends. These excavations are larger and slightly further from the joint margin than the typical rheumatoid erosions. This punched out lesion in gouty arthritis is called Martel's sign, G sign or rat-bite erosion. ''Gout: X-ray of feet demonstrated soft tissue swelling, cystic changes, and well-defined 'punched-out' type lytic lesions with sclerotic margins and overhanging bony edges (Martel's sign, G sign or rat-bite erosion).

Late changes include cartilage degeneration, renal dysfunction and uric acid urolithiasis. MC joint involved in gout: Meta-Tarso-Phalangeal joints. QThe underlying basis of gouty arthritis is increased serum uric acid level. QSerum urate levels >7 mg/dL is defined as hyperuricemia. Epidemiology: Commoner in Caucasians. More common in menQ, age >30 years. QStereotype patient is obese, hypertensive and fond of alcohol and may be nudged into an attack by uncontrolled administration of diuretics or aspirin. QPathology: Precipitation of monosodium urate crystalsQ into the joints is the underlying basis for these urate crystals is increased total body urate levels. Tophi are nodular deposits of monosodium urate monohydrate crystals, with an associated foreign body reaction. Pathognomonic hallmark of gout: Tophi. QTophi evolve from repeated precipitation of urate crystals during attack. Clinical Feature: Acute attack is sudden onset of severe joint pain that lasts for a week or two. Usually comes out of blue but may be precipitated by minor trauma, illness, unaccustomed exercise, alcohol, ACTCH, steroid withdrawal, hypouricemic therapy and drugs. Diagnosis: Definitive diagnosis is made by examination of synovial fluid or tophaceous material with polarized light microscopy and identifying monosodium urate crystals. Crystals have following characteristics. During attack: Intracellular and needle shaped. QAfter the attack: Extracellular and blunted.

Treatment of Gout. Anti-inflammatory. Hypouricemics. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors* Mainstay of treatment during acute attack is administration of anti-inflammatory drugs such as colchicine, NSAIDs (except aspirin) or glucocorticoidsQ* Probenecid or sulfinpyrazone can be used if renal function is normal.* Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitorQ is usually preferred. These drugs should never be started in acute attack, and they should always be covered by an anti inflammatory preparations or colchicine; otherwise they may actually precipitate an acute attackQ. In chronic tophaceous gout and in all patients with renal complications, allopurinol is drug of choiceQ.",

The serum M component is IgG in 53% of patients, IgA in 25% and IgD in 1 %. IgE is very rare. The most common translocation is t( 11: 14). Myeloma is more commonly seen than expected among farmers, wood workers, leather workers, and those exposed to petroleum products. Bone pain is the most common symptom in multiple myeloma, effecting nearly 70% of patients. Hypercalcaemia is the most common cause of renal failure. The earliest manifestation of tubular damage is the adult Fanconi syndrome. Anemia in multiple myeloma is normocytic normochromic and occurs in about 80% of patients. The classical triad of multiple myeloma is: Marrowplasmacytosis (.>10%), Lytic lesions, and. Serum and/or urine M component. Diagnosis of multiple myeloma (The Dune and Salmon myeloma diagnostic criteria). The diagnosis of multiple myeloma requires a minimum of one major and one minor criteria or three minor criteria as defined in the Table below.
