Simultaneously, the decency of cortisol results in increased secretion of ACTH resulting in adrenal hyperplasia. Following enzymes are implicated in the congenital adrenal hyperplasia 21 \u03b1 hydroxylase decency (partial or complete) 17 \u03b1 hydroxylase deficiency 11\u03b2 hydroxylase deficiency 21 \u03b1 hydroxylase deficiency \u2022 Two forms of this deficiency include - A. Salt-wasting adrenogenital ism B. Simple Virilizing adrenogenital ism A) Salt-wasting syndrome (complete lack) The salt wasting syndrome results from complete lack of 21 hydroxylases. There is no synthesis of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids in the adrenal cortex. Decreased mineralocorticoids causes marked sodium loss in the urine, resulting in hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis and hypotension. Because of the enzyme block, there is increased formation of 17 - hydroxyprogesterone, which is then shunted into the production of testosterone. This may cause virilism (pseudo-hermaphroditism) in female infants. That is (XX) Female with 21 hydroxylase deficiency develops ovaries, female ductal structures and external male genitalia. But in the male child, the effect of increased testosterone will not be manifested at the time of birth. The complete21 hydroxylase deficiency or salt wasting syndrome usually comes to light only after the birth because in utero the electrolytes and uids can be maintained by maternal kidneys. Males with this disorder comes to clinical attention 5 to 15 days later because of salt losing crisis while females come to attention soon after the birth because of the virilization. B) Simple Virilizing adrenogenital syndrome (Partial deficiency) Occurs in individuals with partial deficiency of 21 hydroxylases Less severe deficiency of mineralocorticoid, is sufficient for salt reabsorption, but the lowered glucocorticoid fails to cause feedback inhibition of ACTH secretion. Thus level of aldosterone is mildly reduced, testosterone is increased and ACTH elevated with resultant adrenal hyperplasia. 11B hydroxylase deficiency-. Rare Leads to decreased cortisol and increased ACTH. This, in turn, leads to the accumulation of DOC (deoxycorticosterone) and 11 deoxycortisol both of which are strong mineralocorticoids. This results in increased sodium retention by the kidneys and hypertension, hypokalemia. Patients also develop virilization due to androgen excess. 17 \u03b1 hydroxylase deficiency - Patients with deficiency of 17 hydroxylases also have impaired cortisol production, increased ACTH and secondary increased DOC. These patients, however, cannot synthesize normal amount of androgens and estrogens. This is because the gene that codes for 17 \u03b1 hydroxylase is the same for the enzyme in the adrenal cortex and the gonads and the decency is same in both organs. Because of decreased sex hormones, genotypic females develop primary amenorrhoea and fail to develop secondary sex characteristics while genotypic males will present as pseudohermaphrodite. 3 \u03b2 hydroxylase deficiency 3-\u03b2 hydroxylase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder of steroid biosynthesis that results in decreased production of all three groups of adrenal steroids which include mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid and sex steroids. Decreased mineralocorticoid secretion results in varying degrees of salt wasting in both males and females. Decent androgen production results in ambiguous genitalia in males The usual presentation is a male child with ambiguous genitalia and severe salt wasting. Sometimes it may also occur in females",

Hb Production 1. Congenitally abnormal hemoglobin: Hemoglobin M Hemoglobin M is passed as an autosomal dominant trait affecting either the alpha or beta chain of hemoglobin; homozygous Hb M affecting both alpha and beta chains is incompatible with life. Amino acid substitution (often a tyrosine for histidine) near the heme iron facilitates iron oxidation. 2. Inherited enzyme deficiencies: NADH-dependent cytochrome b5 -reductase and cytochrome bc deficiency. Deficiency of either cytochrome b5 or its reducing enzyme, cytochrome b5-reductase, decreases reduction of Met. Hb back to Hb 3. Nitrite (NO2), other oxidants and oxygen-reducing compounds Nitrites are a common oxidizing source of Met. Hb production. Reducing agents paradoxically produce methemoglobinemia by reducing oxygen to a free radical or water to 1-1, O2, which then oxidizes hemoglobin. 4. \"Sensitive\" hemoglobin: Blue baby syndrome Bacteria in the immature gastrointestinal tracts of infants conve nitrate (NO3) to the powerful oxidant nitrite (NO, ).

This is a sex-linked recessive disorder presenting with the triad of thrombocytopenia, eczema, and recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Serum IgM levels are low but IgG, IgA, and IgE levels are increased. Patients have a defective response to polysaccharide antigens, which is due to a cytoskeletal defect in T cells that inhibits their binding to B cells. A CD4/CD8 ratio of < 1. 5: 1 is the pattern seen in AIDS due to selective tropism of the CD4+ T-helper cell population. Cerebellar ataxia is pa of the ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome. The ataxia develops between age 2 and 5. The defect is associated with a DNA repair enzyme deficiency. Elevated platelet count and increased serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgE is not associated with a paicular syndrome. Polyclonal gammopathies result in an increase in immunoglobulin of more than one class. This benign alteration is frequently seen in viral or bacterial infections.

As the kidney function decreases: Blood pressure is increased due to fluid overload and production of vasoactive hormones, increasing one's risk of developing hypertension and/or suffering from congestive heart failure. Urea accumulates, leading to azotemia and ultimately uremia (symptoms ranging from lethargy to pericarditis and encephalopathy). Urea is excreted by sweating and crystallizes on skin (\"uremic frost\"). Potassium accumulates in the blood (hyperkalemia with a range of symptoms including malaise and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias) Erythropoietin synthesis is decreased (potentially leading to anemia, which causes fatigue) Fluid volume overload - symptoms may range from mild edema to life-threatening pulmonary edema Hyperphosphatemia - due to reduced phosphate excretion, associated with hypocalcemia (due to vitamin D3 deficiency). The major sign of hypocalcemia is tetany.

        "question": "A 52 year old woman has long standing rheumatoid ahritis (RA) and is being treated with coicosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Which of the following cardiac complications may arise in this clinical setting?",
        "exp": "Long-standing inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid ahritis (RA) are associated with deposition of a form of amyloid known as AA (amyloid-associated protein), which may involve kidneys, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and skin, for example. Amyloid deposition in the myocardium results in decreased compliance and impaired diastolic filling, i. e., restrictive cardiomyopathy. The myocardium has a rigid and waxy texture. This form of amyloid, as well as any other biochemical form, can be visualized on tissue section by staining with Congo red, which acquires a characteristic apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Constrictive pericarditis is due to any pathologic process that results in fibrous thickening of the pericardium, with resultant impaired compliance. Clinically, therefore, this condition manifests with a picture similar to restrictive cardiomyopathy because of impaired diastolic filling. Constrictive pericarditis is usually caused by previous episodes of acute pericarditis, especially hemorrhagic, suppurative, and caseous pericarditis. Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by massive ventricular dilatation and may be caused by genetic alterations, myocarditis, toxic insults (alcohol), metabolic disorders (hemochromatosis), etc. Most cases are idiopathic. The main pathophysiologic alteration is impaired contractility. You may be tempted to think that this patient is prone to developing hypersensitivity myocarditis, but this form of myocardial disease has been repoed after treatment with some antihypeensive agents, antibiotics, diuretics and not with coicosteroids or NSAIDs. Fuhermore, myocarditis manifests acutely with arrhythmias and heart failure, and chronically with dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. Ref: Hoit B. D. (2011). Chapter 34.

        "exp": "The description given above is of an individual with Graves' disease. Hypersecretion of thyroid hormone because of stimulation of the TSH receptor by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins results in excessive movement of thyroglobulin from the colloid to the plasma. The presence of exophthalmos is thought to be pa of the autoimmune disorder in Graves' disease. It is postulated that the thyroid and orbital muscles may share a common antigen. Lymphocytic infiltration and inflammation of orbital muscle then produces the ophthalmopathy. Serum T4 is increased in Graves' disease. Because of excessive stimulation of the thyroid by the thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins, radioactive iodine uptake, which assesses iodine trapping, is increased. The increase in free T4 due to hypersecretion by the thyroid shifts the equilibrium between free and bound T4 toward an increase in thyroxine binding globulin (TBG)-bound hormone. Concomitantly, the concentration of unbound TBG falls. Hence, the radioactive T3 in the resin T3 uptake test would preferentially bind to the resin and resin uptake would be increased. Ref: Jaume J.

AIDS and HIV Infection with HIV-1 is associated with a progressive decrease of the CD4+ T cell count and an increase in viral load, the level of HIV in the blood. The stage of infection can be determined by measuring the patient's CD4+ T cell count and viral load. The stages of HIV infection are acute infection (also known as primary infection), latency and AIDS. Acute infection lasts for several weeks and may include symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, rash, myalgia, malaise, and mouth and esophageal sores. The latency stage involves few or no symptoms and can last anywhere from two weeks to twenty years or more, depending on the individual. AIDS, the final stage of HIV infection, is defined by low CD4+ T cell counts (fewer than 200 per microliter), various oppounistic infections, cancers and other conditions. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level of 200 cells per uL, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and infections with a variety of oppounistic microbes appear. The first symptoms often include moderate and unexplained weight loss, recurring respiratory tract infections (such as sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis media, pharyngitis), prostatitis, skin rashes, and oral ulcerations. Common oppounistic infections and tumors, most of which are normally controlled by robust CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity then sta to affect the patient. Typically, resistance is lost early on to oral Candida species and to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which leads to an increased susceptibility to oral candidiasis (thrush) and tuberculosis. Later, reactivation of latent herpes viruses may cause worsening recurrences of herpes simplex eruptions, shingles, Epstein-Barr virus-induced B-cell lymphomas, or Kaposi's sarcoma. Pneumonia caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii is common and often fatal. In the final stages of AIDS, infection with cytomegalovirus (another herpes virus) or Mycobacterium avium complex is more prominent.",

In addition HIV can also affect macrophages that bear CD4 on their surface. The first step in the HIV infection is the binding of envelope glycoprotein of HIV to the CD4 receptor on the T cells/macrophages. How ever this interaction alone is not sufficient for entry and infection of the virus. It needs a second receptor i. e a co-receptor. HIV has two coreceptors- CCR5 CXCR4. Therefore HIV must bind to CD4 receptor and one of the above coreceptor to enter into the cell. Any damage to these coreceptors will prevent HIV from entering the cell, thus leading to resistance to HIV infection. A well known example is a mutation of CCR5 which is called delta 32 mutation. Those persons with this mutation is resistant to HIV infection because HIV virus cannot bind to this mutated CCR5 and therefore cannot enter the cell.",

Hyperparathyroidism tends to be more common in women, and occurs in 25 out of every 100, 000 individuals. Hyperparathyroidism can be the result of all four parathyroid glands producing an excessive amount of parathyroid hyperplasia (PTH), or the result of just one gland specifically producing an excessive amount of PTH (usually the result of a parathyroid adenoma or benign tumor). Other conditions associated with hypercalcemia include: Cancers, paicularly multiple myeloma, breast cancer and lung cancer; Excessive levels of vitamin D from vitamins, excessive dietary calcium, or from diseases that may result in excess vitamin D production; Immobilization over a long period of time; Kidney failure; Overactive thyroid (hypehyroidism) or excessive thyroid hormone intake; and Use of ceain medications such as thiazide diuretics.

CK-MB rises within 4-8 hr after Acute MI and elevated CK-MB is accepted as a sensitive marker for diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction in healthy individuals. Individuals who train for long distance races (Athletes like marathan runners) however have been observed to have very high resting concentration of CK-MB in skeletal muscles. This may be owing to an adaptation by the athelete to produce a higher relative content of CKMB within skeletal muscles themselves. Studies of CK-MB levels in trained marathan runners have reveaked that total CK and percentage of MB isoenzyme is asymptomatic runners have been comparable to levels of CK and CKMB in patients with myocardial Infarction. Because of nonspecificity of CKMB fraction in runners (atheles) the measurement of this isoenzyme is of little value in making an early diagnosis of myocardial injury in athelets.

Low Erythropoetin levels, Thrombocytosis and increased LAP scores are all minor criteria for diagnosis of polycythemia Vera. JAK-2 Mutation and Polycythemia Vera JAK-2 is a member of an evolutionarily well conserved, non receptor tyrosine kinase family and serves as the cognate tyrosine kinase for the erythropoietin receptors A mutation in the tyrosine kinase JAK-2 appears to have a central role in the pathogenesis of PV by causing constitutive activation of the kinase The presence of JAK -2 mutation thus allows for the exclusion of a reactive erythrocytosis. The 2001 WHO criteria for diagnosis of PV were however developed prior to the discovery of this impoant mutation and hence revised WHO criteria have been developed that include presence of JAK-2 mutation as a major criterion for diagnosis of PV Note: Although presence of JAK-2 mutation is a major criterion for diagnosis of PV, the presence of JAK-2 mutation alone is not diagnostic of PV. JAK-2 mutations may also be seen in other myeloproliferative disorders such as Essential Thrombocytosis (ET) and Chronic Idiopathic Myelojlbrosis (CIMF).

A common sign is the growth of fat pads along the collar bone and on the back of the neck (buffalo hump) and a round face often referred to as a \"moon face\". Other symptoms include hyperhidrosis (excess sweating), telangiectasia (dilation of capillaries), thinning of the skin (which causes easy bruising and dryness, paicularly the hands) and other mucous membranes, purple or red striae (the weight gain in Cushing's syndrome stretches the skin, which is thin and weakened, causing it to hemorrhage) on the trunk, buttocks, arms, legs or breasts, proximal muscle weakness (hips, shoulders), and hirsutism (facial male-pattern hair growth), baldness and/or cause hair to become extremely dry and brittle. In rare cases, Cushing's can cause hypercalcemia, which can lead to skin necrosis Other signs include polyuria (and accompanying polydipsia), persistent hypertension (due to coisol's enhancement of epinephrine's vasoconstrictive effect) and insulin resistance (especially common in ectopic ACTH production), leading to hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) which can lead to diabetes mellitus. Cushing's syndrome due to excess ACTH may also result in hyperpigmentation, such as acanthosis nigricans in the axilla. This is due to Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone production as a byproduct of ACTH synthesis from Pro-opiomelanocoin (POMC). Coisol can also exhibit mineralcoicoid activity in high concentrations, worsening the hypertension and leading to hypokalemia (common in ectopic ACTH secretion). Fuhermore, gastrointestinal disturbances, oppounistic infections and impaired wound healing (coisol is a stress hormone, so it depresses the immune and inflammatory responses). Osteoporosis is also an issue in Cushing's syndrome",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Oesophageal varices Physical findings in esophageal varices: Pallor may suggest active internal bleeding. Low blood pressure, increased pulse rate, and postural drop of blood pressure may suggest blood loss. Parotid enlargement may be related to alcohol abuse and/or malnutrition. A hyperdynamic circulation with flow murmur over the pericardium may be present. Jaundice may be present because of impairment of liver function. Telangiectasis of the skin, lips, and digits may be present. Gynecomastia in males results from failure of the liver to metabolize estrogen, resulting in a sex hormone imbalance. Fetor hepaticus occurs in poosystemic encephalopathy of any cause (e. g., cirrhosis). Palmar erythema and leuconychia may be present in patients with cirrhosis. Ascites, abdominal distention due to accumulation of fluid, may be present.. Distended abdominal wall veins may be present, with the direction of venous flow away from the umbilicus. Splenomegaly occurs in poal hypertension. Testicular atrophy is common in males with cirrhosis, paicularly those with alcoholic liver disease or hemachromatosis. Venous hums, continuous noises audible in patients with poal hypertension, may be present as a result of rapid turbulent flow in collateral veins. During the rectal examination, a black, soft, tarry stool on the gloved examining finger suggests upper GI bleeding.",

Muscle pains, salivation and vomitting may follow. A few days following exposure the patient may experience a stage of excitement or muscle spasms initiated from the ingestion of of saliva or water. As a result these individuals have a tendency to drool and begin to fear water or hydrophobia. This excited phase continues for a few days until the patient lapses into a coma and dies. Dumb Rabies manifests itself in the opposite manner as Furious Rabies. Instead of demonstrating excitement the patient experiences depression and paralysis followed by a coma.

Phosphate retention begins early in the course of CKD, perhaps as early as in stage 2 and paicipates in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Central to the management of high-turnover bone disease is controlling the serum phosphate levels. This may be achieved by dietary phosphate restriction or by the use of phosphate binders. Phosphate-binder therapy is recommended when serum phosphate concentrations are elevated despite patient compliance with dietary phosphate restriction. Calcium-based phosphate binders are often recommended as the initial binder therapy. High Bone Turnover Disease Bone turnover (the formation and removal of bone) is increased due to a process called secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Secondary hyperparathyroidism represents a common disorder in patients with CKD.

Conditions with Abnormal Schilling's Test (Abnormal Cobalamine Absorption) Pernicious anemia Chronic Pancreatitis Achlorhydria Bacterial overgrowth syndrome Beal dysfunction Schilling Test: Schilling test is performed to determine the cause of cobalamine malabsorption (Vit B12 malabsorption). Since cobalamine absorption requires multiple steps including gastric, pancreatic and ileal processes, the Schilling test can also be used to assess the integrity of these other organs. The Schilling test is performed by administering Co58-labeled cobalamin orally and collecting urine for 24h 1 mg of cobabmine is administed intramuscularly one hour after ingestion of the Radiolabelled cobalamine. This is done to ensure saturation of cobalamine binding sites in the liver as urinary excretion of cobalamine will reflect cobalamine absorption only provided that intrahepatic binding sites of cobalamine are fully occupied. Once intrahepatic binding sites of cobalamine are saturated all absorbed radiolabelled cobalamine will be excreted in urine. The Schilling test may be abnormal (defined as less than 10 percent excretion in 241i) in conditions that affect cobalamine absorption including Pernicious anemia, Chronic Pancreatitis, Bacterial overgrowth syndrome and Heal dysfunction. The etiology for an abnormal Schilling test may be deduced by administering Co58-labeled cobalamin with intrinsic factor, pancreatic enzymes or after 5 day course of antibiotics. Differential Results of Schilling Test in various diseases associated with cobalamin malabsorption may thus help establish the diagnosis. Diagnosis 58.

        "exp": "Ans. D: Dark field microscopy Laboratory examinations for syphilis: In its primary and secondary stages, syphilis can often be diagnosed by dark-field examination of fresh exudate obtained from lesions. Because the exudates from non-syphilitic lesions may also contain spiral organisms, the result must be interpreted with care. T. pallidum may also be identified by immunfluorescent staining. Dark field microscopy is paicularly impoant in suspected early primary syphilis before serological tests become reactive. Specimens from genital ulcers or other lesions consistent with a chancre and from skin lesions of secondary syphilis, especially condylomata lata should be examined by dark field microscopy. Flocculation tests for Wasserman Abs are of great value in the presumptive diagnosis/ screening of syphilis or quantitation of syphilis antibody. The Wasserman antigen is a phospholipid known as cardiolipin which is a normal constituent of host tissue. The standard is the VDRL test. The RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) test is another widely used test. However, a wide variety of other diseases e. g. malaria, SLE, leprosy, and other infections may give a false-positive result. Wasserman antibody is usually detected 1 to 3 weeks after the primary lesion appears and reaches a maximum during the second stage of infection. Subsequently, this antibody may remain at an elevated level. However, it is only positive in 71% of patients with teiary syphilis and thus a negative VDRL test does not exclude late syphilis. Tests for treponemal antibody, such as the TPI (T. pallidum immobilisation) test, are more specific but are not generally available. The more widely performed fluorescent antibody (FTA) test is positive in 84% of patients with primary syphilis and in almost all patients with secondary or latent syphilis and 96% in teiary syphilis. It should therefore not be used as a screening test. The TPHA test is similar to the FTA test in its sensitivity and specificity. Antitreponemal antibodies decline more slowly than Wasserman antibody after treatment, and positive reactions may persist for years",

        "exp": "The process described is commonly called acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), even though the autoimmune basis has been clearly established (some authors use \"immune thrombocytopenic purpura, \" so that the initials still work). The thrombocytopenia in this disorder appears to be secondary to splenic destruction of opsonized platelets, and usually follows a viral upper respiratory tract infection or exanthem. The acute form of ITP is usually explosive, but self-limited; a chronic form in adults may respond to steroid therapy or splenectomy. In Bernard-Soulier syndrome, platelets are unable to adhere to collagen. Thrombasthenia is associated with a functional defect in platelets (they do not aggregate). In thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, platelets are consumed in intravascular platelet microthrombi. Ref: Alexandrescu D. T., Gallo R. L. (2010). Chapter 123. The Vascular Purpuras. In J. T.

The haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex is quickly cleared from the blood by the reticuloendothelial system, which allows the hemoglobin to be salvaged instead of lost into the urine. Intravascular hemolysis from any cause is rapidly followed by a dramatic drop in serum haptoglobin. Bilirubin is synthesized in the liver and spleen as an end-product of heme degradation. Serum bilirubin levels would not change until the haptoglobin in the blood was completely saturated, and free hemoglobin began to circulate. In this circumstance, serum bilirubin would increase, not decrease. C-reactive protein an acute phase reactant produced by the liver in increased quantity in response to inflammation. This patient's urinary tract infection would increase C-reactive protein levels, but the hemolysis would not fuher affect them. Serum free iron does not change appreciably in intravascular hemolysis.

The current evidence the primary bioactive form of Vitamin E is alfa-tocopherol. Serum vitamin E levels are strongly influenced by concentration of serum lipids, and do not accurately reflect tissue vitamin levels. Effective vitamin E levels are calculated as the ratio of serum alpha-tocopherol per gram total lipids. Absorption of dietary vitamin E requires effective pancreatic exocrine function and fat absorption, unless provided in a synthetic water-soluble form.
