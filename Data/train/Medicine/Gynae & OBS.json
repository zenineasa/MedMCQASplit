Ref: Chapter 96: Intra uterine diagnosis of fetal disease, Nelson 18th* All structural defects can be best picked up by antenatal ultrasound whereas chromosomal and genetic aberrations can be picked up by chorionic villus sampling.* Chorionic villi are tiny finger-shaped growths found in the placenta. The genetic material in chorionic villus cells is the same as that in the baby's cells.* During CVS, a sample of the chorionic villus cells is taken for biopsy. The chorionic villus cells are checked for problems. The procedure is generally done late in the first trimester, most often between the 10th and 12th weeks.",
