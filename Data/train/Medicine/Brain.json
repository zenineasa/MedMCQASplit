The Chang staging system is used for Medulloblastoma. Chang staging system is based on: Size and invasiveness of the primary tumor at surgery, denoted as the \"T stage\" or tumor stage. Evidence of spread outside the posterior fossa, marked as the \"M stage\" or metastatic stage. Chang staging system for medulloblastomaT stageM stage. T1. Tumor <3cm in diameter. M0. No evidence of subarachnoid or hematogenous metastasis. T2. Tumor >3cm in diameter, further invading one adjacent structure. Ml. Tumor cells found in cerebrospinal fluid. T3a. Tumor >3cm in diameter with invasion into 2 adjacent structures, or completely filling the 4th ventricle, causing marked hydrocephalus. M2. Intracranial tumor beyond primary site. T3btumor >3 cm and with unequivocal extension into brainstem. M3. Gross nodular seeding in spinal subarachnoid space. T4. Tumor >3cm in diameter with extension up past the aqueduct of Sylvius and/or down past the foramen magnum (ie. Beyond the posterior fossa)M4. Metastasis outside the cerebrospinal axis (especially to bone marrow, bone)(Source: Pediatric Radiation Oncology; Halperin, Constine, Tarbell, Kun). The M stage appears to be more significant prognostic factor in determining the intensity of therapy that is appropriate, as well as predicting the outcome for the patient. Names of some other staging systems: Ann Arbor staging- Lymphomas. Duke's staging- Colon cancer. Clark and Breslow staging- Melanoma. Butchart staging system- Mesothelioma. Child-Pugh classification system- Liver Cirrhosis. Durie-Salmon staging system- Multiple myeloma. Evans staging system- Neuroblastoma.
