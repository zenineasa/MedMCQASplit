        "exp": "Ans. a. Deletion of alpha genes. Cause of alpha thalassemia is deletion of alpha genes. \"The a-thalassemias are caused by inherited deletions that result in reduced or absent synthesis of a-globin chains. Normally, there are four a-globin genes, and the severity of a-thalassemia depends on how many a-globin genes are affected. As in b-thalassemias, the anemia stems both from a lack of adequate hemoglobin and the effects of excess unpaired non-a. chains (b, g, and d), which vary in type at different ages. In newborns with a-thalassemia, excess unpaired g-globin chains form g4 tetramers known as hemoglobin Barts, whereas in older children and adults excess b-glohin chains form b4 tetramers known as HbH. Since free b and g chains are more soluble than free a chains and form fairly stable homo tetramers, hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis are less severe than in b-thalassemias. A variety of molecular lesions give rise to a-thalassemia, but gene deletion is the most common cause of reduced a -chain synthesis. \"- Robbins 9/e p64. Ia-THALASSEMIASClinical Syndromes. Genotype.

P. L. C / Hemoglobin electrophoresis. Serum iron level is increased in Thalassemia because of increased intestinal absorption of iron and ongoing hemolysis. Hence choice A is ruled out. Due to low iron but normal ferritin iron deficiency is ruled out as serum ferritin is first to reduce in iron deficiency anemia. Choice B is ruled out. Since MCV is low it is a microcytic anemia. Choice C is ruled out. This is a likely case of anemia of chronic disease in which serum ferritin is normal to increased while the serum iron level is usually on the lower side.",
