It is typically a self-limited condition with fever and manifestation of acute inflammation lasting for an average of 12 days without therapy. However, cardiovascular complications particularly coronary artery (CA) aneurysms which lead to occlusion and ischemia may develop and lead to significant morbidity and mortality. The frequency of coronary artery aneurysm development and associated mortality and morbidity have been dramatically decreased as a result of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG)QThis therapy is most effective for preventing coronary artery abnormalities, but the benefit in children who have already developed coronary artery aneurysms are more equivocal. Thus expeditious diagnosis and timely treatment are critical to achieve the optimal clinical outcome. All children diagnosed with Kawasaki disease are treated at the time of diagnosis. The recommended initial therapy includes: -Intravenous immunoglobulin administered as single infection and. Aspirin. Intravenous immunoglobulin. Since the first report of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy, randomized controlled studies and meta analyses have confirmed that IVIG plus aspirin compared to aspirin alone reduces the risk of coronary artery aneurysm. Although aspirin does not appear to affect aneurysm formation all trials of IVIG treatment have included aspirin as well since it was treatment of choice at the time IVIG was introduced. The mechanism of beneficial effect of IVIG remains unknown. IVIG appears to have a generalized anti-inflammatory effect with reduction of fever and acute markers of inflammation. Possible mechanisms for these actions are cytokine level and production, neutralizing bacterial super antigens. Treatment of Kawasaki disease. Acute stage. Intravenous immunoglobulin with aspirin. Convalescent stage. Aspirin 3-5 mg/kg once daily orally until 6-8 week illness onset. Long-term therapy for those with coronary abnormalities. Aspirin 3-5 mg/kg once daily orally+- dipyridamole 4-6 mg/kg/24 hr, divided in two-three doses orally. Acute coronary thrombosis.

The illness occurs predominantly in young children, 80% of the patients are younger than 5 years. Pathogenesis. Kawasaki disease causes a severe vasculitis of all blood vessels but predominantly affecting the medium sized arteries with predilection for the coronary arteries. Inflammation (vasculitis) involves all three layers of the vessel wall. The vessel loses its structural integrity and weakens resulting in dilatation and aneurysm formation. Clinical manifestations and diagnosis. The diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is based on demonstration of characteristic clinical signs. Diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease*Fever lasting for at least 5 days. Presence of at least four of the following five signs. Bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection, generally non purulent. Changes in the mucosa of the Oropharynx, including injected pharynx, injected and/dry fissured lips, strawberry tongue. changes of the peripheral extremities, such as edema and or erythema of the hands or feet in the acute phase; or periungual desquamation in the acute phase. Rash, primarily truncal; polymorphous but nonvascular. Cervical adenopathy, >1. 5 cm, usually unilateral lymphadenopathy, illness not explained by other known disease process. Cardiac involvement is the most important manifestation of Kawasaki disease. These include. Myocarditis - seen in about 50% of the patients, manifested by tachycardia and decreased ventricular function. Pericarditis. Coronary artery aneurysm - Complications are rupture, thrombosis, stenosis, myocardial infarction. Laboratory findings. No specific diagnostic test exists for Kawasaki disease, but certain laboratory findings are characteristic: Elevated E. S. R. Elevation of acute phase reactants i. e. (C reactive protein). Normocytic anemia. Platelet count is normal in the first week and rapidly increases during 2nd and 3ld week. Treatment of Kawasaki disease. Acute stage. Intravenous immunoglobulin with aspirin. Convalescent stage. Aspirin 3-5 mg/kg once daily orally until 6-8 week after illness onset. Long term therapy for those with coronary abnormalities. Aspirin 3-5 mg/kg once daily orally + dipyridamole 4-6 mg/kg/24 hr, divided in two-three doses orally. Acute coronary thrombosis.
