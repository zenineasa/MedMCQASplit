This may cause symptomatic ischemia and infarction in ~30% of patients and is the major cause of delayed morbidity and death. Signs of DCI appear 4-14 days after the hemorrhage, most often at 7 days. The severity and distribution of vasospasm determine whether infarction will occur.DCI (DELAYED CEREBRAL ISCHEMIA)due to vasospasm remains the leading cause of morbidityand moality following aneurysmal SAH. 4)Hyponatremia OPTION A)MECHANISM OF XANTHOCHROMIC CSF-Lysis of the red blood cells subsequent conversion of hemoglobin to bilirubin stains the spinal fluid yellow within 6-12 h.The xanthochromic csf peaks in intensity at 48 h and lasts for 1-4 weeks, depending on the amount of subarachnoid blood. OPTION B)1)-frequently shows ST-segment and T-wave changes similar to those associated with cardiac ischemia. 2)A prolonged QRS complex,increased QT interval, and prominent\"peaked\" or deeply inveed symmetric T waves are usually secondary to the intracranial hemorrhage. There is evidence that circulating catecholamines and excessive discharge of sympathetic neurons may occur after SAH, causing structural myocardial lesions , these ECG changes and a reversible cardiomyopathy sufficient to cause shock or congestive hea failure.

Pathogenesis: 1) SENSORY SENSITIVITYthat is characteristic of migraine is due to dysfunction of monoaminergic sensory control system in brainstem and hypothalamus 2) TRIGEMINO VASCULAR SYSTEM-Release of vasoactive peptides- eg CGRP. Activation of cells in the trigeminal nucleus results in the release of vasoactive neuropeptides, paicularly calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), at vascular terminations of the trigeminal nerve and within the trigeminal nucleus Clinical application-CGRP receptor antagonists have now been shown to be effective in the acute treatment of migraine.Methysergide was found to antagonize ceain peripheral actions of 5-HT and having anti-inflammation propeies .it is used as the first drug capable of preventing migraine attacks. The triptans are potent agonists of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors.Triptans arrest nerve signaling in the nociceptive pathways of the trigeminovascular system, at least in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and trigeminal sensory thalamus, in addition to promoting cranial vasoconstriction, act by vascular target. 3)VASCULAR THEORY- Vasoconstriction of intracranial blood vessels & later on reflex vasodilation of extracranial blood vessels that causes pulsatile headache 4) DOPAMIN HYPERSENSITIVITY-There is dopamine receptor hypersensitivity in migraine patients .",
