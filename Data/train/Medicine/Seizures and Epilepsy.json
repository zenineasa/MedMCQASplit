Lamotrigine Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a generalized seizure disorder of unknown cause that appears in early adolescence. Characterized by bilateral myoclonic jerks that may be single or repetitive. Myoclonic seizures are most frequent in the morning after awakening and can be provoked by sleep deprivation. Consciousness is preserved unless the myoclonus is especially severe. Many patients also experience generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and up to one-third have absence seizures. Although complete remission is relatively uncommon, the seizures respond well to appropriate anticonvulsant medication. There is often a family history of epilepsy, and genetic linkage studies suggest a polygenic cause. Treatment: Valproate is often used to treat juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Other epilepsy drugs are effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy: Levetiracetam. Topiramate. Lamotrigine. For most people with JME, treatment is long-term, and often lifelong. However, treatment is effective, allowing most people with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy to go five years or more between seizures.",

She was previously alright. This patient is most probably suffering from viral encephalitis. Acyclovir is of benefit in the treatment of HSV and should be started empirically in patients with suspected viral encephalitis, especially if focal features are present, while awaiting viral diagnostic studies. Acyclovir is of benefit in the treatment of HSV and should be started empirically in patients with suspected viral encephalitis, especially if focal features are present, while awaiting viral diagnostic studies. Harrison 18/e. Viral Encephalitis. In encephalitis the brain parenchyma is involved. Many patients with encephalitis also have evidence of associated meningitis (meningoencephalitis) and, in some cases, involvement of the spinal cord or nerve roots (encephalomyelitis, encephalomyeloradiculitis). Clinical Features: In addition to the acute febrile illness with evidence of meningeal involvement, an altered level of consciousnessQ (confusion, behavioral abnormalities), or a depressed level of consciousness ranging from mild lethargy to coma, and evidence of either focal or diffuse neurologic signs and symptomsQ. Focal or generalized seizuresQ occur in many patients with encephalitis. MC encountered focal findings are aphasia, ataxia, upper or lower motor neuron patterns of weakness, involuntary movements (e. g., myoclonic jerks, tremor), and cranial nerve deficitsQ (e. g., ocular palsies, facial weakness). Diagnosis: CSF PCR has become the primary diagnostic test for CIVS infections caused by CMV, EBV. HHV-6. and enteroviruses. QThe sensitivity (~ 96%) and specificity (~ 99%) of HSV CSF PCR is equivalent to or exceeds that of brain biopsyQ. Patients with suspected encephalitis almost invariably undergo neuroimaging studies and often EEGQ. Focal findings in a patient with encephalitis should always raise the possibility of HSV encephalitisQ. Treatment: Specific antiviral therapy should be initiated when appropriateQ. Basic management and supportive therapy should include careful monitoring of ICP, fluid restriction, avoidance of hypotonic intravenous solutions, and suppression of fever. Seizures should be treated with standard anticonvulsant regimensQ, and prophylactic therapy should be considered in view of the high frequency of seizures in severe cases of encephalitis. Acyclovir is of benefit in the treatment of HSV and should be started empirically in patients with suspected viral encephalitis, especially if focal features are present, while awaiting viral diagnostic studies.",
