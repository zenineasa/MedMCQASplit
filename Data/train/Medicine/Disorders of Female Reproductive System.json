        "exp": "Ans. (c) P.C.O.DRef : Harrison 19th ed. /331, 332* Testosterone is the most important androgen in both men and women.* In women, testosterone is produced primarily through peripheral conversion of androstenedione (50 percent) with the remainder of production concentrated in the ovary (25 percent) and adrenal cortex (25 percent).* In women, abnormally high levels of testosterone have been associated with hirsutism and polycystic ovary syndrome.* Granulosa-theca cell tumors, more commonly known as granulosa cell tumors, belong to the sex cord-stromal category and include tumors composed of granulose cells, theca cells, and fibroblasts in varying degrees and combinations.* Both subtypes commonly produce estrogen, and estrogen production often is the reason for early diagnosis.",
