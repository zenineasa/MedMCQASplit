        "exp": "Chlorpropamide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating b cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic b cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Chlorpropamide is not recommended for the treatment of NIDDM as it increases blood pressure and the risk of retinopathy. Up to 80% of the single oral dose of chlorpropramide is metabolized, likely in the liver; 80-90% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. Renal and hepatic dysfunction may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Chlorpropamide (CPM) has been repoed to produce impaired water excretion due to the enhancement of renal vasopressin (ADH) action and/or due to centrally enhanced ADH release, but it is still unknown for sure whether CPM gives rise to ADH release with a subsequent hyponatremia in diabetes mellitus.

        "exp": "Pseudohyperaldosteronism is characterized by a clinical picture of hyperaldosteronism with suppression of plasma renin activity and aldosterone. Pseudohyperaldosteronism can be due to a direct mineralocoicoid effect, as with desoxycoicosterone, fluorohydrocoisone, fluoroprednisolone, estrogens, and the ingestion of high amounts of glycyrrhetinic acid. A block of 11-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type 2 (11. HSD2), the enzyme that conves coisol into coisone, at the level of epithelial target tissues of aldosterone, is involved in other cases. This mechanism is related either to a mutation of the gene, which encodes 11. HSD2 (apparent mineralocoicoid excess syndrome and some cases of low renin hypertension) or to an acquired reduction of the activity of the enzyme due to glycyrrhetinic acid, carbenoxolone, and grapefruit juice. In other cases saturation of 11. HSD2 may be involved as in severe Cushing's syndrome and chronic therapy with some coicosteroids. Recently, an activating mutation of the mineralocoicoid receptor gene has been described. Another genetic cause of pseudohyperaldosteronism is the syndrome of Liddle, which is due to a mutation of the gene encoding for beta and gamma subunits of the sodium channels.

        "exp": "Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption by binding to hydroxyapatite crystals on the bone surface. When osteo clasts attempt to resorb bone that contains bisphos phonate, the drug is released within the cell, where it inhibits key signalling pathways that are essential for osteoclast function. Although bisphosphonates prima rily target the osteoclast, bone formation is also sup pressed because of coupling between bone formation and bone resorption and an inhibitory effect on osteo blasts. However, the balance of effect on bone turnover is ourable, resulting in a gain in bone density due paly to increased mineralisation of bone. Bisphospho nate treatment typically leads to an increase in spine BMD of about 5-8% and in hip BMD of 2-4% during the f irst 3 years of treatment and plateaus thereafter. Alendronic acid is the bisphosphonate used most fre quently. It reduces risk of veebral fractures by 40% and nonveebral fractures by about 25% in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Risedronate is an alternative with similar efficacy, but may be better tolerated in patients with a history of gastrointestinal upset.

Cune-Albright syndrome develop areas of abnormal scar-like (fibrous) tissue in their bones, a condition called polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. Polyostotic means the abnormal areas (lesions) may occur in many bones; often they are confined to one side of the body. Replacement of bone with fibrous tissue may lead to fractures, uneven growth, and deformity. When lesions occur in the bones of the skull and jaw it can result in uneven (asymmetric) growth of the face. Asymmetry may also occur in the long bones; uneven growth of leg bones may cause limping. Abnormal curvature of the spine may also occur. In addition to bone abnormalities, affected individuals usually have light brown patches of skin called cafe-au-lait spots, which may be present from bih. Girls with Mc. Cune-Albright syndrome may reach pubey early. These girls often have menstrual bleeding by age 2. This early onset of menstruation is believed to be caused by excess estrogen, About 50 percent of affected individuals produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormone (hypehyroidism), resulting in a fast heart rate, high blood pressure, weight loss, tremors, sweating, and other symptoms. Excess growth hormone secretion may also lead to increased expansion of the fibrous dysplasia in the bones, most visibly in the skul Rarely, affected individuals develop Cushing syndrome and it causes weight gain in the face and upper body, slowed growth in children, fragile skin, fatigue, and other health problems. In people with Mc. Cune-Albright syndrome, Cushing syndrome occurs only before age 2. Ref - <a style=\"font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\" href=\"",

        "question": "The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone is characterized by the following-",
        "exp": "Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a condition in which the body makes too much antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This hormone helps the kidneys control the amount of water your body loses through the urine. SIADH causes the body to retain too much water. Actions of ADH Osmoregulation The most impoant and primary function of ADH is to maintain the plasma tonicity, primarily by an alteration in water balance. Osmoreceptors detect the change in effective plasma osmolality in the hypothalamus. A decrease in tonicity prevents ADH release and prevents water retention. An increase in tonicity causes ADH release, which acts on V2 receptors on the luminal surface of coical and medullary collecting tubular cells. Under the influence of ADH, unique aquaporin-2 water channels are formed by the fusion of pre-formed cytoplasmic vesicles in the tubular cells and water is absorbed down the concentration gradient. Once the water is absorbed, these channels are removed by endocytosis and returned to the cytoplasm. In patients with SIADH, levels of ADH are high even in the presence of decreased plasma osmolality and/or hyponatremia. Excess water absorption keeps the blood volume high or normal. Volume Regulation An acute drop in blood pressure as sensed by \" volume receptors\" rather then \"osmoreceptors\" causes ADH release (along with other hormones like rennin and epinephrine) which generates free water absorption from the kidneys. This can potentially lead to hyponatremia and a decrease in effective ECF osmolality. So, the main focus in rapid and/or substantial decrease in blood volume is \"volume regulation, \" even at the cost of osmolality. This affect is more prominent in patients with liver disease or cardiac disease, and hyponatremia in such patients is the direct predictor of a worse prognosis Clinical manifestations of SIADH can be due to hyponatremia and decreased ECF osmolality which causes the water to move into the cells causing cerebral edema. Signs and symptoms depend upon the rate and severity of hyponatremia and the degree of cerebral edema. The earliest clinical manifestations of acute hyponatremia include nausea and malaise, which may be seen when the serum sodium concentration falls below 125 to 130 m. Eq/L (normal 135 to 145m. Eq/L). Vomiting is an ominous sign for patients with acute hyponatremia. With a more severe and acute fall in sodium concentration, headache, lethargy, obtundation, and eventually, seizures can occur. Coma and respiratory arrest can occur if the serum sodium level falls below 115 to 120 m. Eq/L. Acute hyponatremic encephalopathy may be reversible, but permanent neurologic damage or death can occur, paicularly in premenopausal women. Chronic hyponatremia allows cerebral adaptation, and the patients remain asymptomatic despite a serum sodium concentration below 120mmol/L. Nonspecific symptoms like nausea, vomiting, gait disturbances, memory and cognitive problems, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, and muscle cramps can occur with chronic hyponatremia. Sign and symptoms or mild and chronic hyponatremia are often subtle and missed during history and physical examination. Nausea and vomiting effect approximately one-third of patients with chronic hyponatremia who have a serum sodium concentration less then 120 mmol/L. The Idiopathic SIADH is more common in patients over 65 years of age, and mild to moderate hyponatremia in such patients may contribute to fractures in addition to a higher risk of falls and gait problems.

It is characterised by florid new bone formation along the anterolateral aspect of at least four contiguous veebral bodies. DISH is distinguished from lumbar spondylosis by the absence of disc space narrowing and marginal veebral body sclerosis, and from ankylosing spondylitis by the absence of sacroiliitis or apophyseal joint fusion. The exact cause is unknown. Mechanical, dietary factors and use of some medications ( vit A derivatives) may be of significance. There is a correlation between these factors but not a cause or effect. The distinctive radiological feature of DISH is the continuous linear calcification along the antero-medial aspect of the thoracic spine. DISH is usually found in people in their 60s and above, and is extremely rare in people in their 30s and 40s. The disease can spread to any joint of the body, affecting the neck, shoulders, ribs, hips, pelvis, knees, ankles, and hands. Although DISH manifests in a similar manner to Ankylosing spondylitis, they are separate diseases. Ankylosing spondylitis is a genetic disease with identifiable marks, tends to sta showing signs in adolescence or young adulthood, is more likely to affect the lumbar spine, and affects organs. DISH has no indication of a genetic link, and does not affect organs other than the lungs, which is only indirect due to the fusion of the rib cage.

        "question": "Growth factors promote cell growth by acting on-",
        "exp": "Growth factors can act on specific cell surface receptors that subsequently transmit their growth signals to other intracellular components and eventually result in altered gene expression. The general process of transmitting an external molecular signal to a cell to evoke a cellular response is called signal transduction. The receptor binding site for peptide/protein growth factors is on the outer cell membrane surface, in other words, the extracellular domain. Most cell surface receptors for growth factors show tyrosine kinase activity, meaning they put a phosphate group on a downstream protein tyrosine residue. An exception is the surface receptors for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of cytokines. When activated by the binding of TGF-beta cytokines, this receptor can phosphorylate downstream proteins on serine and threonine residues. \"Downstream\" here means an event triggered after TGF-beta binding to its receptor. Some growth factors are small peptides called cytokines. While all cytokines affect signal transduction pathways, only those cytokines affecting cell growth/differentiation signaling pathways are considered growth factors. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an example of a cytokine growth factor since it promotes the production of white blood cells by stem cells. Examples of protein growth factors are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Ref - Harrison 17/e p 2190, <a href=\"",

This can include activities such as walking, gardening, swimming or cycling. Supervised and structured exercise programmes may be of paicular benefit to people with type 2 diabetes. Various guidelines exist for physical activity in the general population. Those from the US Depament of Health and Human services (2008) suggest that adults (18-64 years) should build up to achieve a weekly minimum of 2. 5 hours of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise, or a combination thereof. The aerobic (moderate-intensity) activity should be performed for at least 10 minutes each time and spread throughout the week, with at least 30 minutes on at least 5 days of the week. Older adults should also follow these guidelines as far as their abilities allow. Recently, it has also been suggested that a combination of both aerobic and resistance exercise may lead to greater improvements in glycaemic control. In type 1 diabetes, exercise can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia, so patients should seek specialist advice on taking extra carbohydrate, reducing insulin doses and choosing an injection site.

Gestational Gestational DI occurs only during pregnancy and the postpaum period. During pregnancy, women produce vasopressinase in the placenta, which breaks down antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Gestational DI is thought to occur with excessive production and/or impaired clearance of vasopressinase. Most cases of gestational DI can be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP), but not vasopressin. In rare cases, however, an abnormality in the thirst mechanism causes gestational DI, and desmopressin should not be used. Diabetes insipidus is also associated with some serious diseases of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. These cause DI by impairing hepatic clearance of circulating vasopressinase. It is impoant to consider these diseases if a woman presents with diabetes insipidus in pregnancy, because their treatments require delivery of the baby before the disease will improve. Failure to treat these diseases promptly can lead to maternal or perinatal moality. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 887",

        "question": "Following are features of Paget's disease except -",
        "exp": "Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is a common condition characterised by focal areas of increased and disorgan ised bone remodelling. It mostly affects the axial skele ton, and bones that are commonly involved include the pelvis, femur, tibia, lumbar spine, skull and scapula. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY-Diseases of bone The primary abnormality is increased osteoclastic bone resorption, accompanied by marrow fibrosis, increased vascularity of bone and increased osteoblast activity. Bone in PDB is architecturally abnormal and has reduced mechanical strength. Osteoclasts in PDB are increased in number, are unusually large and contain characteristic nuclear inclusion bodies. Genetic factors are impoant and mutations in the SQSTM1 gene are a common cause of classical PDB. The presence of nuclear inclusion bodies in osteoclasts has fuelled speculation that PDB might be caused by a slow virus infection with measles or distemper but the evidence is conflicting. Biomechani cal factors may help determine the pattern of involve ment, since PDB often stas at sites of muscle inseions into bone and, in some cases, localises to bones or limbs that have been subjected to repetitive trauma or overuse. Involvement of subchondral bone can compromise the joint and predispose to OA ('Pagetic ahropathy'). CLINICAL FEATURES -The classic presentation is with bone pain, deformity, deafness and pathological fractures, but many patients are asymptomatic and diagnosed from an abnormal Xray or blood test performed for another reason. Cli nical signs include bone deformity and expansion, increased warmth over affected bones, and pathological fracture. Bone deformity is most evident in weight bearing bones such as the femur and tibia, but when the skull is affected the patient may complain that hats no longer fit due to cranial enlargement. Neurological problems, such as deafness, cranial nerve defects, nerve root pain, spinal cord compression and spinal stenosis, are recognised complications due to enlargement of affected bones and encroachment upon the spinal cord and nerve foraminae. Surprisingly, deafness seldom results from compression of the auditory nerve, but is conductive due to osteosclerosis of the temporal bone. The increased vascularity of Pagetic bone makes opera tive procedures difficult and, in extreme cases, can precipitate highoutput cardiac failure in elderly patients with limited cardiac reserve. Osteosarcoma is a rare but serious complication that presents with subacute onset of increasing pain and swelling of an affected site. INVESTIGATIONS -The characteristic features are an elevated serum ALP and bone expansion on Xray, with alternating areas of radiolucency and osteosclerosis (Fig. 25. 57B). ALP is normal in about 5% of cases, usually because of mono stotic involvement. Radionuclide bone scanning is useful to define the presence and extent of disease (Fig. 25. 57A). If the bone scan is positive, Xrays should be taken of an affected bone to confirm the diagnosis. Bone biopsy is not usually required but may help to exclude osteo sclerotic metastases in cases of diagnostic unceainty. MANAGEMENT-The main indication for treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption is bone pain thought to be due to increased metabolic activity (Box 25. 82). It is often difficult to dif ferentiate this from pain due to complications such as bone deformity, nerve compression symptoms and OA. If there is doubt, it can be wohwhile giving a therapeu tic trial of antiresorptive therapy to determine whether the symptoms improve. A positive response indicates that the pain was due to increased metabolic activity. The aminobisphosphonates pamidronate, zoledronate and risedronate are more effective than simple bisphos phonates such as etidronate and tiludronate at suppress ing bone turnover in PDB, but their effects on pain are similar. Although bisphosphonates suppress bone turn over in PDB, there is no evidence to show that they alter the natural history or prevent complications. Calcitonin can be used as an alternative but is less convenient to administer and more expensive. Repeated courses of bisphosphonates or calcitonin can be given if symptoms recur. If symptoms do not respond to antiresorptive therapy, it is likely that the pain is due to a complication of the disease and this should be managed according to the principles described on page 1085.

Explanation: The patient with type 1 or type 2 DM should receive education about nutrition, exercise, care of diabetes during illness, and medications to lower the plasma glucose. Exercise. It has multiple positive benefits including: Cardiovascular risk reduction. Reduced blood pressure. Maintenance of muscle mass. Reduction in body fat. Weight loss. Lowering plasma glucose (during and following exercise). Increasing insulin sensitivity. In patients with diabetes, the ADA recommends 150 min. Aveek (distributed over at least 3 days) of moderate aerobic physical activity. The exercise regimen should also include resistance training. To avoid exercise-related hyper- or hypoglycemia. individuals with type 1 DM should: Monitor blood glucose before, during, and after exercise. Delay exercise if blotxl glucose is >14 mmoi/L (250 mg/dL) and ketones are present. If the blood glucose is <5. 6 mmol/L (100 mg/ dL). ingest carbohydrate before exercising. Monitor glucose during exercise and ingest carbohydrate to prevent hypoglycemia. Decrease insulin doses (based on previous experience) before exercise and inject insulin into a non-exercising area. Learn individual glucose responses to different types of exercise and increase food intake for up to 24 h after exercise, depending on intensity and duration of exercise. In individuals with type 2 DM. exercise-related hypoglycemia is less common but can occur in individuals taking either insulin or insulin secretagogues. Untreated proliferative retinopathy is a relative contraindication to vigorous exercise, as this may lead to vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment. Nutritional Recommendations for Adults with Diabetes. Weight loss diet (in prediabetes and type 2 DM). Hypocaloric diet that is low-fat or low-carbohydrate. Fat in diet. Minimal trans fat consumption. Carbohydrate in diet. Monitor carbohydrate intake in regards to calories. Sucrose-containing foods may be consumed with adjustments in insulin dose. Amount of carbohydrate determined by estimating grams of carbohydrate in diet for (type 1 DM). Glycemic index reflects how consumption of a particular food affects the blood glucose.

Harrison's 17th / pg. 2289\"In DM, Subclinical neuropathy is much more common than clinical neuropathy. Distal symmetrical polyneuropathy is the most common type of neuropathy in DM, followed by carpal tunnel syndrome, other mononeuropathies, and autonomic neuropathy. \"Harrison's 17th / pg. 2653 \"By far the most common form of diabetic neuropathy is a length-dependent diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN). \"Diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN)# Proposed criteria for the diagnosis of DSPN are two or more of the following:- symptoms or signs of neuropathy, - abnormal EDx studies, quantitative sensation test abnormalities, - heart rate decrease with deep breathing or Valsalva maneuver.# The diagnosis of DSPN is usually straightforward, although other contributors to the neuropathy should be excluded, including nutritional (vitamins B1 and B12 and folate deficiencies), toxic (alcohol, vitamin B6 toxicity), immune- mediated (paraprotein), and inherited causes. An alternative diagnosis should be sought in patients with rapidly progressive or asymmetric weakness, a family history of neuropathy, exposure to toxins, or prior malignancy. A glucose tolerance test is indicated in all patients presenting with neuropathy. EDx studies show mixed findings of axonal loss and demyelination in a length-dependent pattern. Nerve biopsy and lumbar puncture are not necessary unless alternative diagnoses are being considered.# Various hypotheses have been invoked to account for DSPN. Increased neuronal concentrations of glucose induce the conversion of glucose to sorbitol by aldose reductase using NADPH as a coenzyme. Sorbitol decreases levels of myo-inositol and phosphoinositides, leading to a decrease in diacylglycerol, protein kinase C, and Na+, K+, ATPase activity.# Rx consists of strict glucose control, which prevents the neuropathy from worsening; established neuropathy does not usually reverse. Aldose reductase inhibitors to treat and prevent diabetic neuropathy have been studied in >30 trials. Although controlled trials of the aldose reductase inhibitors sorbinol and tolrestat were found to improve electrophysiologic or morphometric markers of DSPN, any clinically meaningful improvement in pain or sensation has been inconsistent. Rx with recombinant nerve growth factor was ineffective. Alpha lipoic acid (thioctic acid), an antioxidant, has been shown to improve experimental diabetic neuropathy, and a meta-analysis of clinical trials suggested that the Rx (600 mg/ d IV for 3 weeks) is safe and improves symptoms and signs of neuropathy. Pancreatic transplantation can halt progression of DSPN but is a realistic therapy only for patients who have renal failure and are undergoing combined kidney and pancreas transplantation.# Glycemic control is essential for the prevention of diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Once neuropathy is established, few effective Rxs exist. Classification of Neuropathy by Histopathology Demyelinating. Axonal. Neuronal. Pattern. Proximal = distal.

Biopsy typically reveals little inflammation and \"onion-bulb\" changes (imbricated layers of attenuated Schwann cell processes surrounding an axon) that result from recurrent demyelination and remyelination. The response to therapy suggests that CIDP is immune-mediated; CIDP responds to glucocorticoids, whereas GBS does not. Classification of Neuropathy by Fiber Type.

It is usually seen as a pa of the glucagonoma syndrome, a paraneoplastic syndrome which includes the triad of diabetes mellitus, NME, and weight loss. However, more rarely, NME can also be seen as a pa of other clinical entities such as liver disease and intestinal malabsorption; here it is termed the pseudoglucagonoma syndrome. The skin rash is characteristically extremely erythematous, shows superficial epidermal necrosis and often spreads in a centrifugal pattern. The condition is frequently misdiagnosed due in pa to its rarity and often is the presenting symptom of the pancreatic islet neoplasm. Thus, timely recognition and treatment can help prevent morbidity from the epidermal dysfunction and moality from the tumor burden itself, if the neoplasm is identified before metastasis.

Mild symptoms may include circumoral numbness, muscle cramps, or paresthesias of hands and feet. In severe cases, patients may present with laryngospasm, generalized muscle cramps, seizures, or even myocardial dysfunction. Trousseau sign and Chvostek sign are clinical tests to unmask latent tetany. The increased excitability of the peripheral nerves is due to either a low serum calcium (true hypocalcemia denotes a decrease in the ionized calcium level even though the total serum calcium level may be normal) or alkalosis in which the propoion of the serum calcium in the ionized form is decreased. The etiology of tetany in our patient was probably multifactorial. The hyperventilation causes alkalosis and decrease in the ionized fraction of serum calcium, which manifested as carpal spasm in the patient. Edmondson et al. have demonstrated that hypocalcemia in combination with alkalosis always produced tetany. Magnesium deficiency could have been a contributory factor but there was no clinical evidence to suspect magnesium deficiency. Magnesium deficiency is usually caused by long-standing etiological factors, which may include inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation. Hypomagnesemia may also be caused by malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract, loss from the kidneys during use of diuretics, or due to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. A Hypokalemia in the absence of alkalosis has also been repoed to cause tetany, Usually hypokalemia manifests as tetany in association with alkalosis.

It occurs due to either overactivation of the entire thyroid gland, or more commonly autonomous nodules within the gland after iodine repletion without adequate feedback control from the pituitary gland. Wolff-Chaikoff effect is a phenomenon where excess iodide transiently inhibits thyroid iodide organification leading to hypothyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis factitia is a condition in which patients induce thyrotoxicosis by consuming excessive amounts of a thyroid hormone preparation, most often levothyroxine. The exogenous thyroxine suppresses pituitary TSH secretion and hence iodine uptake, serum thyroglobulin and release of endogenous thyroid hormone. The circulating T3 is derived exclusively from peripheral monodeiodination of T4. de Quervain's (subacute) thyroiditis is a transient inflammation of the thyroid gland occuring after infection with Coxsackie, mumps or adenoviruses.

However, there are several diseases or conditions in which the body fails to maintain adequate levels of glucose in the blood after a period without food (fasting hypoglycemia). In people who drink heavily without eating, alcohol can block the formation of glucose in the liver. In people with advanced liver disease, such as viral hepatitits, cirrhosis, or cancer, the liver may not be able to store and produce sufficient glucose. Infants and children who have an abnormality of the enzyme systems that control glucose use (such as a glycogen storage disorder) also may have fasting hypoglycemia. A rare cause of fasting hypoglycemia is an insulinoma, which is an insulin-producing tumor in the pancreas. Disorders that lower hormone production by the pituitary and adrenal glands (most notably Addison disease) can cause hypoglycemia.

Factitious hypoglycemia results from exogenous self-administration of insulin or insulin secretagogues medications (e. g., sulfonylureas, meglitinides). Note that insulin-sensitizing drugs like metformin, do not cause hypoglycemia. Insulin synthesis occurs in the beta cells of the pancreas as proinsulin, which is then processed and cleaved into insulin, and C peptide held together by disulfide bonds and excreted into the circulation. Insulin will be then rapidly removed by the liver, whereas C peptide remains in the circulation for a more extended period till the kidneys clear it and the insulin to C peptide ratio in healthy individuals will be less than one. Some proinsulin molecules would also get excreted in the blood without processing, and this is still detectable in the plasma. Serum C-peptide is a marker of endogenous insulin secretion (a synthetic insulin does not contain C-peptide) and is paicularly useful if a patient is on exogenous (injected) insulin treatment, when insulin assays would simply detect the injected insulin. Serum C-peptide can help clarify the differential diagnosis of diabetes, as it is usually very low in long-standing type 1 diabetes and very high in severe insulin resistance.

The greatest disadvantage of urinary glucose measurement is the individual variation in renal threshold for glucose. The most frequent cause of glycosuria is a low renal threshold, which is common during pregnancy and in young people; the resulting 'renal glycosuria' is a benign condition unrelated to diabetes. Another disadvantage is that some drugs (such as b-lactam antibiotics, levodopa and salicylates) may interfere with urine glucose tests. Ketones -Ketone bodies can be identified by the nitroprusside reaction, which measures acetoacetate, using either tablets or dipsticks. Ketonuria may be found in normal people who have been fasting or exercising strenuously for long periods, who have been vomiting repeatedly, or who have been eating a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrate. Ketonuria is therefore not pathognomonic of diabetes but, if associated with glycosuria, the diagnosis of diabetes is highly likely. In diabetic ketoacidosis (p. 811), ketones can also be detected in plasma using test sticks (see below). Protein -Standard dipstick testing for albumin detects urinary albumin at concentrations above 300 mg/L, but smaller amounts (microalbuminuria, see Box 17. 13, p. 476) can only be measured using specific albumin dipsticks or by quantitative biochemical laboratory measurement. Microalbuminuria or proteinuria, in the absence of urinary tract infection, is an impoant indicator of diabetic nephropathy and/or increased risk of macrovascular disease (p. 830). Blood testing Glucose- Laboratory glucose testing in blood relies upon an enzymatic reaction (glucose oxidase) and is cheap, usually automated and highly reliable. However, blood glucose levels depend on whether the patient has eaten recently, so it is impoant to consider the circumstances in which the blood sample was taken. Blood glucose can also be measured with colorimetric or other testing sticks, which are often read with a poable electronic meter. These are used for capillary (fingerprick) testing to monitor diabetes treatment (p. 810). There is some debate as to whether selfmonitoring in people with type 2 diabetes improves glycaemic control. Many countries now only offer selfmonitoring to people with type 2 diabetes taking blood glucose concentration should be estimated using an accurate laboratory method rather than a poable technique. Glucose concentrations are lower in venous than aerial or capillary (fingerprick) blood. Whole blood glucose concentrations are lower than plasma concentrations because red blood cells contain relatively little glucose. Venous plasma values are usually the most reliable for diagnostic purposes (Boxes 21. 10 and 21. 11). Ketones -Blood ketone monitoring is increasingly available. Urinary ketone measurements described above are semi-quantitative, difficult to perform and retrospective (i. e. the urine has accumulated over several hours), and do not measure the major ketone in blood during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (b. OHB). Whole blood ketone monitoring detects b-OHB and is useful in assisting with insulin adjustment during intercurrent illness or sustained hyperglycaemia to prevent or detect DKA. Blood ketone monitoring is also useful in monitoring resolution of DKA in hospitalised patients (Box 21. 7). Glycated hemoglobin Glycated hemoglobin provides an accurate and objective measure of glycaemic control integrated over a period of weeks to months. In diabetes, the slow non-enzymatic covalent attachment of glucose to hemoglobin (glycation) increases the amount in the Hb. A1 (Hb. A1c) fraction relative to nonglycated adult hemoglobin (Hb. A0). These fractions can be separated by chromatography; laboratories may repo glycated hemoglobin as total glycated hemoglobin (GHb), Hb. A1 or Hb. A1c. In most countries, Hb. A1c is the preferred measurement. The rate of formation of Hb. A1c is directly propoional to the ambient blood glucose concentration; a rise of 1% in Hb. A1c corresponds to an approximate average increase of 2 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) in blood glucose. Although Hb. A1c concentration reflects the integrated blood glucose control over the lifespan of erythrocytes (120 days), Hb. A1c is most sensitive to changes in glycaemic control occurring in the month before measurement. DAVIDSONS PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE 22. ND EDITION PAGE NO-807, 808",

        "exp": "Despite all the treatments now available, the outcome for patients with diabetes remains disappointing. Longterm complications of diabetes still cause significant morbidity and moality (Boxes 21. 31 and 21. 32). Excess moality in diabetes is caused mainly by large blood vessel disease, paicularly myocardial infarction and stroke. Macrovascular disease also causes substantial morbidity from myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, cardiac failure and intermittent claudication. The pathological changes of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients are similar to those in the non-diabetic population but occur earlier in life and are more extensive and severe. Diabetes amplifies the effects of the other major cardiovascular risk factors: smoking, hypertension and dyslipidaemia (Fig. 21. 11). Moreover, patients with type 2 diabetes are more likely to have additional cardiovascular risk factors, which co-segregate with insulin resistance in the metabolic syndrome (p. 805). Disease of small blood vessels is a specific complication of diabetes and is termed diabetic microangiopathy. It contributes to moality through renal failure caused by diabetic nephropathy, and is responsible for substantial morbidity and disability: for example, blindness from diabetic retinopathy, difficulty in walking, chronic ulceration of the feet from peripheral neuropathy, and bowel and bladder dysfunction from autonomic neuropathy. The risk of microvascular disease is positively correlated with the duration and degree of sustained hyperglycaemia, however caused and at whatever age it develops.

        "exp": "<p>The causes of hypocalcemia can be differentiated according to whether serum PTH levels are low (hypoparathyroidism) or high (secondary hyperparathyroidism). Although there are many potential causes of hypocalcemia, impaired PTH or vitamin D production are the most common etiologies. Because PTH is the main defense against hypocalcemia, disorders associated with deficient PTH production or secretion may be associated with profound, life-threatening hypocalcemia. In adults, hypoparathyroidism most commonly results from inadveent damage to all four glands during thyroid or parathyroid gland surgery. Hypoparathyroidism is a cardinal feature of autoimmune endocrinopathies; rarely, it may be associated with infiltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis. Impaired PTH secretion may be secondary to magnesium deficiency or to activating mutations in the Ca. SR, which suppress PTH, leading to effects that are opposite to those that occur in FHH. Vitamin D deficiency, impaired 1, 25(OH) 2 D production (primarily secondary to renal insufficiency), or vitamin D resistance also cause hypocalcemia. However, the degree of hypocalcemia in these disorders is generally not as severe as that seen with hypoparathyroidism because the parathyroids are capable of mounting a compensatory increase in PTH secretion. Hypocalcemia may also occur in conditions associated with severe tissue injury such as burns, rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis, or pancreatitis. The cause of hypocalcemia in these settings may include a combination of low albumin, hyperphosphatemia, tissue deposition of calcium, and impaired PTH secretion. \u0002 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Patients with hypocalcemia may be asymptomatic if the decreases in serum calcium are relatively mild and chronic, or they may present with life-threatening complications. Moderate to severe hypocalcemia is associated with paresthesias, usually of the fingers, toes, and circumoral regions, and is caused by increased neuromuscular irritability. On physical examination, a Chvostek's sign (twitching of the circumoral muscles in response to gentle tapping of the facial nerve just anterior to the ear) may be elicited, although it is also present in ~10% of normal individuals. Carpal spasm may be induced by inflation of a blood pressure cuff to 20 mm. Hg above the patient's systolic blood pressure for 3 min (Trousseau's sign). Severe hypocalcemia can induce seizures, carpopedal spasm, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, and prolongation of the QT interval(harrison 18 pg 362)</p>",

Tuberculosis can involve the adrenal glands and result in adrenal insufficiency. Measurement of serum cortisol baseline and then stimulation with cosyntropin (a synthetic ACTH analogue) will confirm the clinical suspicion. The cosyntropin stimulation test is used to determine the adrenal reserve capacity for steroid production. Cortisol response is measured 30 and 60 minutes after cosyntropin is given intramuscularly or intravenously; a value of 18 mg/dL or above effectively excludes adrenal insufficiency. ACTH level (drawn before cosyntropin administration) will demonstrate whether the problem is based in the adrenal gland (primary) or hypothalamus/pituitary axis (secondary). Hemochromatosis can cause hyperpigmentation but not the weight loss and hypotension. Bacteremia would not cause the gradually increasing symptoms or the hyperpigmentation. In some patients with weight loss and nausea, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) may be warranted; however, the clinical features of adrenal insufficiency in conjunction with poorly treated tuberculosis would first direct attention toward adrenal status.",

In people who drink heavily without eating, alcohol can block the formation of glucose in the liver. In people with advanced liver disease, such as viral hepatitis, or cancer, the liver may not be able to store and produce sufficient glucose. Infants and children who have an abnormality of the enzyme systems that control glucose use (such as a glycogen storage disease) also may have fasting hypoglycemia.

The most frequent cause of iron overload is the common genetic disorder, idiopathic hemochromatosis. Secondary iron storage problems can occur after multiple transfusions in a variety of anemias. The most practical screening test is the determination of serum iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin.

        "question": "SIADH - all are features except -",
        "exp": "Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a condition in which the body makes too much antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This hormone helps the kidneys control the amount of water your body loses through the urine. SIADH causes the body to retain too much water. Actions of ADH Osmoregulation The most impoant and primary function of ADH is to maintain the plasma tonicity, primarily by an alteration in water balance. Osmoreceptors detect the change in effective plasma osmolality in the hypothalamus. A decrease in tonicity prevents ADH release and prevents water retention. An increase in tonicity causes ADH release, which acts on V2 receptors on the luminal surface of coical and medullary collecting tubular cells. Under the influence of ADH, unique aquaporin-2 water channels are formed by the fusion of pre-formed cytoplasmic vesicles in the tubular cells and water is absorbed down the concentration gradient. Once the water is absorbed, these channels are removed by endocytosis and returned to the cytoplasm. In patients with SIADH, levels of ADH are high even in the presence of decreased plasma osmolality and/or hyponatremia. Excess water absorption keeps the blood volume high or normal. Volume Regulation An acute drop in blood pressure as sensed by \" volume receptors\" rather then \"osmoreceptors\" causes ADH release (along with other hormones like rennin and epinephrine) which generates free water absorption from the kidneys. This can potentially lead to hyponatremia and a decrease in effective ECF osmolality. So, the main focus in rapid and/or substantial decrease in blood volume is \"volume regulation, \" even at the cost of osmolality. This affect is more prominent in patients with liver disease or cardiac disease, and hyponatremia in such patients is the direct predictor of a worse prognosis Clinical manifestations of SIADH can be due to hyponatremia and decreased ECF osmolality which causes the water to move into the cells causing cerebral edema. Signs and symptoms depend upon the rate and severity of hyponatremia and the degree of cerebral edema. The earliest clinical manifestations of acute hyponatremia include nausea and malaise, which may be seen when the serum sodium concentration falls below 125 to 130 m. Eq/L (normal 135 to 145m. Eq/L). Vomiting is an ominous sign for patients with acute hyponatremia. With a more severe and acute fall in sodium concentration, headache, lethargy, obtundation, and eventually, seizures can occur. Coma and respiratory arrest can occur if the serum sodium level falls below 115 to 120 m. Eq/L. Acute hyponatremic encephalopathy may be reversible, but permanent neurologic damage or death can occur, paicularly in premenopausal women. Chronic hyponatremia allows cerebral adaptation, and the patients remain asymptomatic despite a serum sodium concentration below 120mmol/L. Nonspecific symptoms like nausea, vomiting, gait disturbances, memory and cognitive problems, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, and muscle cramps can occur with chronic hyponatremia. Sign and symptoms or mild and chronic hyponatremia are often subtle and missed during history and physical examination. Nausea and vomiting effect approximately one-third of patients with chronic hyponatremia who have a serum sodium concentration less then 120 mmol/L. The Idiopathic SIADH is more common in patients over 65 years of age, and mild to moderate hyponatremia in such patients may contribute to fractures in addition to a higher risk of falls and gait problems.

Individuals with Type IB diabetes lack immunologic markers indicative of autoimmune destructive process of beta cells. However they develop insulin deficiency and are ketosis prone. Type I diabetes develops as a result of synergestic effects of genetic, environmental and immunological factors that ultimately destroy pancreatic beta cells. The important dietary factors responsible are, bovine serum albumin (BSA) a major constituent of cow milk. It has been implicated in triggering type I diabetes. Various nitrosamines (found in smoked and cured meats) and coffee have been proposed as potentially diabetogenic factors. In susceptible animals such as diabetes prone BB rat, various dietary protein (e. g., gluten) may be essential for expression of clinical type I diabetes. Other environmental triggers for Type I DM include viruses, coxsackie and rubella most prominently. Notes: The major susceptibility gene for Type IA DM is located in HLA region in chromosome 6.

She recalls having a tremor and mild palpitations for a few weeks, beginning 3 months after delivery. On examination, her BP is 126/84 and her pulse rate is 56. The thyroid gland is two times normal in size and nontender. The rest of the physical examination is normal. Laboratory studies reveal a free T4 level of 0. 7 ng/mL (normal 0. 9-2. 4) and an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at 22 microU/mL (normal 0. 4-4). What is the likely course of her illness?",
        "exp": "This patient has postpartum thyroiditis, a condition that follows 5% to 8% of all pregnancies. Like other forms of destructive thyroiditis (including subacute or de Quervain thyroiditis), this illness is triphasic. Initially there is hyperthyroidism due to inflammation and release of preformed thyroid hormone from the inflamed follicles; this phase usually lasts 2 to 4 weeks. In subacute thyroiditis, the initial phase is usually noticed because of pain and tenderness over the thyroid gland, but in postpartum thyroiditis the thyroid is usually painless, and the hyperthyroid phase may be overlooked. This phase is then followed by transient hypothyroidism, usually lasting 1 to 3 months. The third phase is resolution and euthyroidism. Whereas Hashimoto thyroiditis usually leads to permanent autoimmune hypothyroidism, most patients with destructive thyroiditis have a full recovery. Some will be symptomatic enough to require thyroid supplementation for 1 to 3 months until the process resolves. Although the initial hyperthyroid phase can suggest Graves' disease, in thyroiditis the absence of infiltrative ophthalmopathy and a suppressed radioiodine uptake will make the distinction. Antithyroid drug treatment of thyroiditis is ineffective and puts the patient at unnecessary risk of toxicity such as agranulocytosis. Although hypothyroidism can cause amenorrhea and hence impair fertility, the hypothyroid phase of postpartum thyroiditis is transient. Low-level radiation exposure, but not thyroiditis, increases the risk of subsequent development of thyroid cancer. Interestingly, therapeutic radioactive iodine, such as is given for Graves' disease, does not increase the long-term risk of cancer, probably because the thyroid cells are destroyed.",

Hypocalcemia is more likely to be symptomatic after second parathyroid explorations, paicularly when normal parathyroid tissue was removed at the initial operation and when the manipulation and/or biopsy of the remaining normal glands are more extensive in the search for the missing adenoma(Harrison 17 pg 2384)",

Hence, the detection of substances that are more specific for carcinoid tumours can facilitate a more exact diagnosis. Two markers are primarily used to diagnose and follow carcinoid tumours: 5-hydroxy-indole-acetic acid (5-hiaa) and chromogranin A (CgA). Serotonin released by carcinoid tumours is metabolized by monoamine oxidases in the liver, lungs, and brain to 5-hiaa. When measured in a 24-hour urine sample, 5-hiaa level has a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 100% for diagnosing carcinoid. The normal range for urinary 5-hiaa is 3-15 mg/24 h, but the figure may vary depending on the laboratory. Chromogranin A is found in the wall of synaptic vesicles that store serotonin and glucagons. Levels of CgA tend to correlate with tumour bulk but not with symptoms. In general, CgA levels are elevated in 85%-100% of patients with carcinoid tumour, regardless of whether the tumour is functional or nonfunctional. Ref - pubmed. com",

The elevation of circulating hormone usually leads to hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. There is great variation in the manifestations. Patients may present with multiple signs and symptoms, including recurrent nephrolithiasis, peptic ulcers, mental changes, and, less frequently, extensive bone resorption. However, with greater awareness of the disease and wider use of multiphasic screening tests, including measurements of blood calcium, the diagnosis is frequently made in patients who have no symptoms and minimal, if any, signs of the disease other than hypercalcemia and elevated levels of PTH. The manifestations may be subtle, and the disease may have a benign course for many years or a lifetime. This milder form of the disease is usually termed asymptomatic HPT. Rarely, hyperparathyroidism develops or worsens abruptly and causes severe complications such as marked dehydration and coma, so-called hypercalcemic parathyroid crisis. The annual incidence of the disease is calculated to be as high as 0. 2% in patients >60, with an estimated prevalence, including undiscovered asymptomatic patients, of >=1%; some repos suggest the incidence may be declining. If confirmed, these changing estimates may reflect less frequent routine testing of serum calcium in recent years, earlier overestimates in incidence, or unknown factors.

The elevation of circulating hormone usually leads to hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Hypercalcemia in vitamin D intoxication is due to an excessive biologic action of the vitamin, perhaps the consequence of increased levels of 25(OH)D rather than merely increased levels of the active metabolite 1, 25(OH) 2 D (the latter may not be elevated in vitamin D intoxication). 25(OH)D has definite, if low, biologic activity in the intestine and bone. The production of 25(OH)D is less tightly regulated than is the production of 1, 25(OH) 2 D. Hence concentrations of 25(OH)D are elevated severalfold in patients with excess vitamin D intake. The diagnosis is substantiated by documenting elevated levels of 25(OH)D >100 mg/mL. Hypercalcemia is usually controlled by restriction of dietary calcium intake and appropriate attention to hydration. These measures, plus discontinuation of vitamin D, usually lead to resolution of hypercalcemia. However, vitamin D stores in fat may be substantial, and vitamin D intoxication may persist for weeks after vitamin D ingestion is terminated. Such patients are responsive to glucocoicoids, which in doses of 100 mg/d of hydrocoisone or its equivalent usually return serum calcium levels to normal over several days; severe intoxication may require intensive therapy(harrison 18 pg 3108)</p>",

Early on there may be no symptoms. Over time the thyroid may enlarge forming a painless goitre. Some people eventually develop hypothyroidism with its accompanying weight gain, feeling tired, constipation, depression, and general pains. After many years the thyroid typically shrinks in size. Potential complications include thyroid lymphoma. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include a family history of the condition and having another autoimmune disease. Diagnosis is confirmed with blood tests for TSH, T4, and antithyroid antibodies. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include Graves' disease and nontoxic nodular goiter. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, regardless of whether or not hypothyroidism is present, can be treated with levothyroxine. If hypothyroidism is not present some may recommend no treatment while others may treat to try to reduce the size of the goitre. Those affected should avoid eating large amounts of iodine; however, sufficient iodine is required especially during pregnancy. Surgery is rarely required to treat the goitre.",

Spider telangietasia occur in up to 10-15% of normal individuals and may also be seen in pregnant women (3rd trimester). They may also be seen in thyrotoxicosis, patients with rheumatoid ahritis, receiving estrogen therapy and women on oral contraceptives. In adults, spider nevi are usually seen over the face, neck, and upper pa of the trunk, and arms (vascular territory of the superior vena cava). It is unusual to find them below a line joining the nipples. They vary in size from 1 to 2 mm in diameter. It comprises a central aeriole represented by a red point from which numerous, small, twisted vessels radiate. Application of pressure on the central aeriole with the head of a pin or a match stick causes blanching of the whole lesion. Vascular spiders have been attributed to excessive levels of estrogen which cause blood vessels to enlarge and dilate. The presence of spider nevi is accompanied by an increased serum estradiol/free testosterone ratio in male cirrhotics.

Steps that may help include eating dinner earlier in the evening, avoiding carbohydrate intake at bedtime, doing something active after dinner (such as going for a walk), moving the long-acting insulin from before the evening meal to bedtime, switch to a different medication, use an insulin pump to administer extra insulin during early-morning hours.

Plasmaglucose +2(Na++K+)+2. 8bloodureanitrogen This patient's serum osmolarity is as follows: 181100 +(126+4)+2. 884 =61+260+30=351. Thus, the serum osmolarity is greater than 350 m. Osm/L. Although the serum sodium is usually the main determinant of osmolarity, extreme hyperglycemia contributes significantly to this patient's hypertonicity. Osmotically active particles in the extracellular fluid space pull water out of the intracellular space. This causes cellular dehydration in the brain and consequently the patient's CNS changes. Diabetic ketoacidosis would be associated with a much lower serum bicarbonate level and with an elevated anion gap. This patient's anion gap is 9 m. Eq/L (126-), which is well within the normal range. This patient's hyponatremia is minimal and is related to the osmotic effects of hyperglycemia. Patients with SIADH have an inappropriate production of ADH, leading to water retention and consequent hypotonicity (not hypertonicity, as in this case). The diagnosis of SIADH or drug-induced hyponatremia cannot be made in the setting of severe hypovolemia. Although the oral hypoglycemic chlorpropamide can cause drug-induced hyponatremia, this patient was not taking a sulfonylurea. Although meningitis can be associated with hyponatremia, this patient's hypertonicity and lack of meningeal signs point toward hyperosmolar nonketotic state as the cause of her illness.",

        "question": "An 80-year-old woman is admitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis due to a urinary tract infection. While in the ICU she develops atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is treated with a loading dose of amiodarone. She converts to sinus rhythm and is sent home on amiodarone to prevent recurrences of atrial fibrillation. In the following weeks she develops increasing fatigue, dry skin, and constipation and her internist finds her TSH to be 25. She is in sinus rhythm. What is the best approach in this situation?",
        "exp": "Amiodarone is a widely used antiarrhythmic drug. It is related structurally to thyroid hormone and is stored in adipose tissue. The drug has a high iodine content as well. Taking amiodarone on an ongoing basis can lead to hypothyroidism by inhibiting deiodinase activity and by acting as a direct antagonist to T4. In some cases, amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism resolves within a few months; however, in many, especially when accompanying anti-TPO antibodies are present, treatment with levothyroxine is needed. This can be easily monitored and adjusted. While answer a is a consideration, the patient likely needs the amiodarone given her tendency toward paroxysms of atrial fibrillation and the attendant risk of stroke. While starting a beta-blocker may prevent episodes of rapid ventricular response, this decision would be made with the help of her cardiologist, which is not mentioned. Anti-TPO antibodies increase the risk of hypothyroidism but are not necessary to guide therapy in this patient. Although prednisone may be used for treatment of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism, this patient has hypothyroidism, and prednisone is not indicated.",

In patients with known ischaemic heart disease, thyroid hormonereplacement should be introduced at low dose and increased veryslowly under specialist supervision. It has been suggested that T3 has an advantage over T4, since T3 has a shoer half-life and any adverse effect will reverse more quickly, but the more distinct peak in hormone levels after each dose of T3 is a disadvantage.

Selenium is an integral component of these monodeiodinases. T4 can be regarded as a prohormone, since it has a longer half-life in blood than T3 (approximately 1 week compared with approximately 18 hours), and binds and activates thyroid hormone receptors less effectively than T3. T4 can also be conveed to the inactive metabolite, reverse T3. T3 and T4 circulate in plasma almost entirely (> 99%) bound to transpo proteins, mainly thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). It is the unbound or free hormones that diffuse into tissues and exe diverse metabolic actions. Some laboratories use assays that measure total T4 and T3 in plasma but it is increasingly common to measure free T4 and free T3free hormone measurements is that they are not influenced by changes in the concentration of binding proteins. For example, TBG levels are increased by oestrogen (such as in the combined oral contraceptive pill) and this will result in raised total T3 and T4, although free thyroid hormone levels are normal.

If it is low, diagnostic tests are done including measuring blood and urinary aldosterone levels and blood renin levels. In Conn's syndrome, the aldosterone is elevated and the renin is suppressed. If these tests are diagnostic then imaging studies are done to see if a tumor can be localized. Since these tumors are small they can be hard to find even with the best CT or CT with contrast or MRI scan. Some patients may have no obvious radiographic tumor but one adrenal is affected (unilateral primary adrenal hyperplasia) and they can benefit from surgical removal. Other patients may have both adrenals affected with no visible tumor (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism) and surgery will not help. In these situations blood has to be drawn from each adrenal vein (so called adrenal venous sampling) in order to measure aldosterone levels to be sure which adrenal has the tumor. The symptoms of hyperaldosteronism may resemble other conditions or medical problems. Always consult your physician for a diagnosis. the diagnostic procedures for aldosteronoma may include: Blood and urine tests to measure potassium and hormone levels Computed tomography (CT or CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - are non-invasive procedures that take cross-sectional images of the adrenal or other internal organs; to detect any abnormalities that may not show up on an ordinary x-ray Adrenal venous sampling- an invasive test performed by a radiologist where a catheter is placed in the adrenal veins to measure the hormone level and confirms the tumor location.
