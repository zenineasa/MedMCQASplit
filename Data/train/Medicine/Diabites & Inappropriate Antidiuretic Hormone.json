        "question": "An obese, diabetic patient with hypertension who is also a smoker, currently on anti-hypertensive and OHA drugs presents with complains of apnea during night. Polysomnography reveals 5 apneic episodes and 1 hypoapneic episode in one hour. What will be best next line of management is: (E. REPEAT 2007)",
        "exp": "Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. 18th edition, Page 2188. Explanation: OSAHS is defined as the coexistence of unexplained excessive daytime sleepiness with at least five obstructed breathing events (apnea or hypopnea) per hour of sleep. EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCOREHow often are you likely to doze off or fail asleep in the following situations, in contrast to feeling just tired'* This refers to your usual way of life in recent times. Even if you have not done some of these things recently, fry to work out how they would have affected you. Use the following scale to choose the most appropriate number for each situation:= would never doze.= slight chance of dozing.= moderate chance of dozing.= high chance of dozing.* Sitting and reading--* Watching TV--* Sitting, inactive in a public place (e. g., a theater or a meeting)--* As a passenger in a car for an hour without a break--* Lying down to rest in the afternoon when circumstances permit--* Sitting and talking to someone--* Sitting quietly after lunch without alcohol--* In a car, while stopped for a few minutes in traffic--TOTAL--Diagnosis. Sleep history from the patient and partner, with both completing. Sleep questionnaires. Epworth Sleepiness Score. Assessment of: o Obesity. o Jaw structureo Upper airwayo Blood pressureo Hypothyroidismo Acromegaly. Polysomnography. The apnea-hypopnea index or apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI). It is an index of sleep apnea severity that combines apneas and hvpopneas. The apneas (pauses in breathing) must last for at least 10 seconds and are associated with a decrease in blood oxygenation. Combining these gives an overall sleep apnea severity score that evaluates both number sleep disruptions and degree of oxygen desaturation (low blood level). The AHI is calculated by dividing the number of events by the number of hours of sleep. AHI values are typically categorized as: o Mild = 5-15/hro Moderate = 15-30/hro Severe = > 30/h. TREATMENT: OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEAWhom to Treat-Indications for Treatment. Group IPatients who have an: o Epworth Score >1. Lo Troublesome sleepiness while driving or working. o >15 apneas + hypopneas per hour of sleep. Treatment is definitely indicated in this group- Maximum benefit. Treatment improves: o Symptomso Sleepinesso Drivingo Cognitiono Moodo Quality of lifeo Blood pressure. Group 2. Patient who have: o Similar degrees of sleepiness as Group Io 5-15 events per hour of sleep. Treatment is indicated-But benefit is less than Group 1. Treatment improves: o Symptomso Subjective sleepiness. No significant improvement in cognition and quality of life. No improvements in Blood pressure. Group 3. Patients who are/have: o Nonsleepy subjects. o Less than 5 events per hour of sleep. Treatment is not indicated. No benefit with treatment. Life style modifications advised. MANAGEMENT OPTIONSLifestyle Modifications. Weight loss. Alcohol Reduction-Alcohol acutely decreases URT dilating muscle tone. CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (CPAP). Blowing the airway open during sleep, usually with pressures of 5-20 mmllg. CPAP improves the following in patients with OSAHS: o Breathing during sleepo Sleep qualityo Sleepinesso Blood pressureo Vigilanceo Cognitiono Driving abilityo Moodo Quality of life. The main side effect of CPAP is airway drying (decreased by using heated humidifier). CPAP is effective for both Moderate and Severe disease. Most common treatment modality used in OS A. MANDIBULAR REPOSITIONING SPLINT (MRS). Also called oral devices. Holds lower jaw and tongue forward causing widening the pharyngeal airway. MRSs improve the follow ing in OSAHS patients: o Breathing during sleep. o Daytime somnolenceo Blood pressure. There are many devices with differing designs with unknown relative efficacy. Self-reports of the use of devices long-term suggest high dropout rates. Surgery. Bariatric surgery can be curative in the morbidly obese. Tonsillectomy can be highly effective in children but rarely in adults. Tracheostomy is curative but rarely used because of the associated morbidity rate but should nor be overlooked in severe cases. Jaw advancement surgery--particularly maxillomandibular osteotomy--is effective in young and thin patients with retrognathia (posterior displacement of the mandible). There is no clear evidence that pharyngeal surgery, including uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (whether by scalpel, laser, or thermal techniques) helps OSAHS patients. Drugs. No drugs are clinically useful in the prevention or reduction of apneas and hypopneas. In CPAP refractory patients. Modafinil can be tried with limited success. Choice of Treatment. CPAP and MRS are the two most widely used and best evidence-based therapies. CPAP is the current treatment of choice. MRSs are evidence-based second-line therapy in those who fail CPAP. In younger. thinner patients, maxillomandibular advancement should be considered. Note: In the given case, patient has 5 events/hour of sleep. He is also obese, diabetic, smoker and hypertensive. So the next step in management is to advocate life style modifications to treat obesity advise smoking cessation and follow-up.",

Demeclocycline is a tetracycline and is used in the t/t of chronic hyponatremia due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) when water restriction therapy has failed. Demeclocycline produces a state of unresponsiveness to ADH, probably by inhibiting the formation and action of cyclic AMP in the renal tubule. It is effective and convenient to use in SIADH because this action is both dose-dependent and reversible. Role of Frusemide in SIADHSIADH may be treated with frusemide if there is a dangerous degree of volume overload. Also go through the following text from Harrison which discusses the future drug therapy for SIADH. \"One or more nonpeptide AVP antagonists that block the antidiuretic effect of AVP may soon be approved for use in United States. Preliminary studies with these antagonists in acute or chronic SIADH indicate that they produce a dose dependent increase in urinary free water excretion, which, if combined with a modest restriction of fluid intake, gradually reduces body water and corrects the hyponatremia without any recognized adverse effect. Thus they may become the t/t of choice for those forms of SIADH in which there is inappropriate secretion of AVP that cannot be corrected by other more specific therapy",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e.. Intraabdominal fat {Ref: Harrison 18th/e p. 2968-2975; IT^/e p. 2279]. Risk factors for type 2 Diabetes mellitus. Obesityo The risk of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes rises with increasing body weight. o The NHS demonstrated an approximately 100-fold increased risk of incident diabetes over 14 years in nurses whose baseline BMI was >35 kg/m2 compared with those with BMI < 22. o Obesity acts at least in part by inducing resistance to imidin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake, which is an important component of type 2 diabetes. o Reversal of obesity decreases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and, in patients with established disease, improves glycemic control. Fat distributiono The distribution of excess adipose tissue is another important determinant ofthe risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. o The degree of insulin resistance and the incidence of type 2 diabetes are highest in those subjects with centra/ or abdominal obesity, as measured bv waist circumference or waist-to-hio circumference ratio. o Intra-abdominal {visceral) fat rather than subcutaneous or retroperitoneal fat appears to be of primary- importance in this regard. o This 'male'type obesity is different from the typical female' type, which primarily affects the gluteal and femoral regions and is not as likely to be associated with glucose intolerance or cardiovascular disease, o Why the pattern of fat distribution is important and the relative roles of genetic and environmental factors in its development are not known. Other important risk factors. Birth weieht. There is an apparent U-shaped relationship between birth weight and risk of type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle factors# Although insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes have a substantial genetic component, they> can also be influencedr both positively and negatively, by behavioral factors, such as physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, body weight, and sleep duration. Improving these lifestyle factors can reduce the risk of diabetes mellitus. ExerciseA sedentary' lifestyle lowers energy- expenditure and promotes weight gain and increases the risk of ty! pe 2 diabetes. Among sedentary' behaviors, prolonged television watching is consistently associated with the development of obesity and diabetes. Physical activity ofmoderate intensity reduces the incidence of new cases of type 2 diabetes, regardless of thepresence or absence of IGT. Smoking. Several large prospective studies have raised the possibility' that cigarette smoking increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. While a definitive causal association has not been established, a relationship between cigarette smoking and diabetes mellitus is biologically possible based upon a number of observations: Smoking increases the blood glucose concentration after an oral glucose challenge. Smoking may impair insulin sensitivity. Cigarette smoking has been linked to increased abdominal fat distribution and greater waist-to-hip ratiothat, as mentioned above, may have an impact upon glucose tolerance. Sleep durationo Quantity and quality-# of sleep may predict the risk of development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. o Difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep were also associated with an increased incidence. Dietary Patternso Dietary patterns affect the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. o Consumption of red meat, processed meat and sugar sweetened beverages is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, whereas consumption of a diet high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, and olive oil is associated with a reduced risk. Increased risko Western versus prudent diet, A western diet (characterized by high consumption of red meat, processed meat, high fat dairy! products, sweets, and desserts) was associated with an increased risk of diabetes independent of BMI, physical activity, age, or family history. o Sugar-sweetened beverages. Sugar-sweetened beverages, in particular soft drinks, have been associated with obesity in children. Most, but not all, studies report an increased risk of diabetes with consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. o Vitamin D deficiency. Several prospective observational studies have shown an inverse relationship between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and risk of type 2 diabetes. o Selenium. Although animal models suggest that low doses of the antioxidant selenium may improve glucose metabolism, these findings have not been demonstrated in humans. o Iron intake An association between serum ferritin lex-els, high iron intake,, and type 2 diabetes has been reported, but the association is not well understood. Low iron diets are not recommended. o Chromium deficiency Chromium deficiency is generally limited to hospitalized patients with increased catabolism and metabolic demands in the setting of malnutrition. Other patients at risk for chromium deficiency include patients with short bowel syndrome, burns, traumatic injuries, or those on parenteral nutrition without appropriate trace mineral supplementation.
