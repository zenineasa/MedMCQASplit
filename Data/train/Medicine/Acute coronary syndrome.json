        "exp": "In hypertension with Concomitant heart disease, cardio-selective beta blockers are used and not non -selective beta blocker Propranolol. The Beta blockers used are like Nebivolol, Carvedilol or Metoprolol. ACEIs attenuate the development of left ventricular hyperophy(VENTRICULAR REMODELING ), improve symptoms and risk of death from C. H. F, and reduce morbidity and moality rates in post-myocardial infarction patients. Similar benefits in cardiovascular morbidity and moality rates in patients with C. H. F have been observed with the use of ARBs. ACEIs provide better coronary protection than do calcium channel blockers, whereas calcium channel blockers provide more stroke protection than do either ACEI or beta blockers.",
