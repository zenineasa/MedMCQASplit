The Beta blockers used are like Nebivolol, Carvedilol or Metoprolol. ACEIs attenuate the development of left ventricular hyperophy(VENTRICULAR REMODELING ), improve symptoms and risk of death from C. H. F, and reduce morbidity and moality rates in post-myocardial infarction patients. Similar benefits in cardiovascular morbidity and moality rates in patients with C. H.
