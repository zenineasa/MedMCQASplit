        "exp": "Hypertension due to an occlusive lesion of a renal aery is renovascular hypertension. In the initial stages, the mechanism of hypertension generally is related to activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Obstruction of the renal aery leads to decreased renal perfusion pressure, thereby stimulating renin secretion. Over time, possibly as a consequence of secondary renal damage, this form of hypertension may become less renin-dependent. As a screening test, renal blood flow may be evaluated with a radionuclide -ohoiodohippurate (OIH) scan, or glomerular filtration rate may be evaluated with a - diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) scan before and after a single dose of captopril (or another ACE inhibitor). Contrast aeriography remains the \"gold standard\" for evaluation and identification of renal aery lesions. Harrison 19e pg: 1618",

The A2 - OS interval is inversely propoional to the height of the left atrial-left ventricular diastolic pressure gradient. The intensity of both S1 and the OS of MS decreases with progressive calcification and rigidity of the anterior mitral leaflets. The pericardial knock (PK) is also high\u0002pitched and occurs slightly later than the OS, corresponding in timing to the abrupt cessation of ventricular expansion after tricuspid valve opening and to an exaggerated y descent seen in the jugular venous waveform in patients with constrictive pericarditis. A tumor plop is a lower-pitched sound that rarely can be heard in patients with atrial myxoma. It may be appreciated only in ceain positions and arises from the diastolic prolapse of the tumor across the mitral valve. The third heart sound (S3) occurs during the rapid filling phase of ventricular diastole. It can be a normal finding in children, adolescents, and young adults; however, in older patients, it signifies heart failure. A left-sided S3 is a low-pitched sound best heard over the LV apex. A right-sided S3 is usually better heard over the lower left sternal borderand becomes louder with inspiration. A left-sided S3 in patients with chronic heart failure is predictive of cardiovascular morbidity and moality. Interestingly, an S3 is equally prevalent among heart failure patients with and without LV systolic dysfunction. The fouh heart sound (S4) occurs during the atrial filling phase of ventricular diastole and indicates LV presystolic expansion. An S4 is more common among patients who derive significant benefit from the atrial contribution to ventricular filling, such as those with chronic LV hyperophy or active myocardial ischemia.

Management * Treat underlying cause -- e. g. COPD and pulmonary infections * Treat respiratory failure -- in the acute situation give 24% oxygen if pa02 <8k Pa. Monitor ABG and gradually increase oxygen concentration if P, C0_ is stable. In COPD patients, long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) for 15h/d increases survival. Patients with chronic hypoxia when clinically stable should be assessed for LTOT. ref: harrisons 21st ed",

        "exp": "Early dumping takes place 15-30 min after meals and consists of crampy abdominal discomfo, nausea, diarrhea, belching, tachycardia, palpitations, diaphoresis, light-headedness, and, rarely, syncope. These signs and symptoms arise from the rapid emptying of hyper\u0002osmolar gastric contents into the small intestine, resulting in a fluid shift into the gut lumen with plasma volume contraction and acute intestinal distention. Release of vasoactive GI hormones (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, neurotensin, motilin) is also theorized to play a role in early dumping. Treatment Dietary modification is the cornerstone of therapy for patients with dumping syndrome. Small, multiple (six) meals devoid of simple carbohydrates coupled with elimination of liquids during meals is impoant. Antidiarrheals and anticholinergic agents are complementary to diet. Guar and pectin, which increase the viscos\u0002ity of intraluminal contents, may be beneficial in more symptomatic individuals. Acarbose, an a-glucosidase inhibitor that delays diges\u0002tion of ingested carbohydrates, has also been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of the late phases of dumping. The somatostatin analogue octreotide has been successful in diet-refractory cases. This drug is administered subcutaneously (50 mg tid), titrated according to clinical response. A long-acting depot formulation of octreotide can be administered once every 28 days and provides symptom relief comparable to the sho-acting agent. In addition, patient weight gain and quality of life appear to be superior with the long-acting form. Ref - Harrison's internal medicine 20e pg 2237",

E1 of the cytochrome P-450 mixed function oxidase enzyme system to form a reactive, potentially toxic, intermediate metabolite. The toxic metabolite preferentially conjugates with hepatic glutathione to form nontoxic cysteine and mercapturic acid derivatives, which are then excreted by the kidney. However, following ingestion of a large overdose, the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways are saturated resulting in a larger fraction of the drug being metabolized the cytochrome P-450 pathway and therefore, the amount of acetaminophen metabolized to the reactive intermediate increases. The increased formation of the reactive metabolite may deplete the hepatic stores of glutathione with subsequent binding of the metabolite to protein molecules within the hepatocyte resulting in cellular necrosis. N-acetylcysteine replenishes the glutathione stores of liver and prevents binding of the toxic metabolite to other cellular constituents(ref: Goodman Gilman 11/e p694)",

        "question": "Which of the following is true about fouh heart sound 'S4'?",
        "exp": "Precordial vibrations resulting from atrial contraction are normally neither palpable nor audible. Under pathologic conditions, forceful atrial contraction generates a low-frequency sound (S4) just before the first heart sound (S1). S4 is also termed the atrial diastolic gallop or the presystolic gallop. Atrial contraction must be present for the production of S4. It is absent in atrial fibrillation. The S4 follows the onset of the P wave of the ECG by approximately70 ms. S 4 has a very low frequency--usually 20 cycles/sec or less. (Guyton and Hall). Audibility of the S4 depends not only on its intensity and frequency but also on its separation from S1. A loud S1 also can mask the audibility of a preceding softer S4. The S4 is best heard at the apex impulse with the patient turned in the left lateral position. It varies considerably with respiration, usually being heard best during expiration. Both the intensity and timing of the S4 are closely related to the end-diastolic volume of the ventricle. Audible fouh heart sounds are usually accompanied by a palpable presystolic apical impulse in the absence of obesity, emphysema, and so foh. The S4 generated by a forceful right atrial contraction is usually heard best at the lower left sternal border. Unlike the left-sided S4, it tends to be accentuated with inspiration. It is also accompanied by prominent 'a waves' in the JVP. An audible S4 with a palpable presystolic impulse is common in patients with ischemic heart disease during an acute episode of angina and in the early phases of transmural MI. In patients with LV an aneurysm or idiopathic or ischemic cardiomyopathy, abnormal fouh heart sounds are commonly present and are often associated with an S3, producing a quadruple rhythm.

ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS * Viually all pulmonary embolisms develop from thrombi(clots), most of which originate in the deep calf, femoral, popliteal, or iliac veins. * Other sources of emboli include tumours, fat, air, bone marrow, amniotic fluid, septic thrombi, and vegetations on heart valves that develop with endocarditis. * Major operations, especially hip, knee, abdominal and extensive pelvic procedures predispose the client to thrombus formation because of reduced flow of blood through pelvis. * Travelling in cramped quaers for a long time or sitting for long periods is also associated with stasis and clotting of blood. The best treatment for a pulmonary embolus is prevention. Minimizing the risk of deep vein thrombosis is key in preventing a potentially fatal illness. The initial decision is whether the patient requires hospitalization. Recent studies suggest that those patients with a small pulmonary embolus, who are hemodynamically stable (normal vital signs) may be treated at home with close outpatient care. ref: harrisons 21st ed",

Valsalva decreases ventricular filling and leads to a narrower HOCM outlet. So, HOCM murmur becomes louder. Valsalva also allows more laxity in the chordae tendinae due to the less ventricular filling. This allows the mitral valve prolapsed and its murmur to become more prominent. In a case of aoic stenosis, when the Valsalva is performed, there is less volume in ventricle to be ejected. Hence the flow across the AS is less. So it softens.

PTE must be differentiated from posttraumatic seizures (PTS), which is a broader-spectrum term and signifies seizures that occur as a sequel to brain injury. Seizures that occur within 24 hours after brain injury are called immediate PTS. PTS that occur within 1 week after injury are termed early PTS, and seizures that occur more than 1 week after injury are termed late PTS. About 20% of people who have a single late posttraumatic seizure never have any fuher seizures, and these people should not be labeled as having PTE. The former definition of epilepsy required 2 unprovoked seizures, but the updated definition of epilepsy can be met with 1 unprovoked seizure and high likelihood of another. This blurrs the definition of PTS and PTE, but it is impoant to differentiate between the two.

A rapid, high-frequency diastolic fluttering of the anterior mitral leaflet produced by the impact of the regurgitant jet is a characteristic finding. The echocardiogram is also useful in determining the cause of AR, by detecting dilation of the aoic annulus and root, aoic dissection or primary leaflet pathology. With severe AR, the central jet width assessed by color flow Doppler imaging exceeds 65% of the left ventricular outflow tract, the regurgitant volume is >=60 mL/beat, the regurgitant fraction is >=50%, and there is diastolic flow reversal in the proximal descending thoracic aoa. Surveillance transthoracic echocardiography forms the cornerstone of follow-up and allows for the early detection of changes in LV size and/or function. On auscultation, in patients with severe AR, a low-pitched, rumbling mid-to-late diastolic murmur is heard at the apex. This is called the Austin Flint murmur. It is probably produced by the diastolic displacement of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve by the AR stream. It may be mistaken for MS but can be differentiated from MS murmur because the Austin Flint murmur is not intensified in presystole and becomes softer with the administration of amyl nitrite.

In 1916, Hans Reiter described the triad of nongonococcal urethritis, conjunctivitis, and ahritis in a young German officer with bloody dysentery. The classic triad of the disease, namely urethritis, ahritis, and conjunctivitis, is present in only one third of the patients. Reactive ahritis is frequently associated with the human leukocyte antigen B27 (1-ILA-B27) haplotype. The etiology of reactive ahritis remains unceain. The most accepted theory about the pathophysiology of reactive ahritis involves initial activation by a microbial antigen, followed by an autoimmune reaction that involves the skin, eyes, and joints. Two forms are recognized: a sexually transmitted form and a dysenteric form. Gastrointestinal infections with Shigella, Salmonella, and Campylobacter species and other microorganisms, and genitourinary infections especially with Chlamydia trachomatis have been found to trigger reactive ahritis. Young children tend to have the post dysenteric form, whereas adolescents and young men are most likely to acquire reactive ahritis after they have urethritis.",

The onset of rheumatic fever usually occurs about two to four weeks after a strep throat infection.

In some cases, the inflammation causes long-term complications. Rheumatic fever can cause permanent damage to the heart (rheumatic heart disease). It usually occurs 10 to 20 years after the original illness, but severe cases of rheumatic fever can cause damage to the heart valves while your child still has symptoms. Problems are most common with the valve between the two left chambers of the heart (mitral valve), but the other valves can be affected. The damage can result in: Narrowing of the valve. This decreases blood flow. Leak in the valve. A leaky valve causes blood to flow in the wrong direction. Damage to heart muscle. The inflammation associated with rheumatic fever can weaken the heart muscle, affecting its ability to pump. Damage to the mitral valve, other heart valves or other heart tissues can cause problems with the heart later in life.

In patients with mild AR, this murmur is brief, but as the severity increases, it generally becomes louder and longer, indeed holodiastolic. When the murmur is soft, it can be heard best with the diaphragm of the stethoscope and with the patient sitting up, leaning forward, and with the breath held in forced expiration. In patients in whom the AR is caused by primary valvular disease, the diastolic murmur is usually louder along the left than the right sternal border. \"Cooing\" or musical diastolic murmurs suggest eversion of an aoic cusp vibrating in the regurgitant stream. A mid-systolic ejection murmur is frequently audible in isolated AR. It is generally heard best at the base of the heart and is transmitted along the carotid aeries. This murmur may be quite loud without signifying aoic obstruction. A third murmur sometimes heard in patients with severe AR is the Austin Flint murmur, a soft, low-pitched, rumbling mid-to-late diastolic murmur. It is probably produced by the diastolic displacement of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve by the AR stream and is not associated with hemodynamically significant mitral obstruction.

They include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). TTP and HUS have common features of thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, fever, renal failure, and neurologic disturbances; When patients, paicularly children, have more evidence of renal injury, their condition tends to be called HUS; In adults with the neurologic disease, it is considered to be TTP; In adults, there is often a mixture of both, hence called TTP/HUS. Renal biopsy showing glomerular capillary endotheliosis associated with platelet thrombi, damage to the capillary wall, and formation of fibrin material in and around glomeruli; similar lesions occur in preeclampsia/HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome), malignant hypertension, and the antiphospholipid syndrome. Causes of TTP/HUS: Pregnancy. Drugs like oral contraceptives, quinine; in renal transplant patients given OKT3 for rejection. Calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus. Antiplatelet agents, ticlopidine, and clopidogrel. HIV infection. In DIC, while thrombocytopenia and microangiopathy are seen, a coagulopathy predominates - with consumption of clotting factors and fibrinogen resulting in an elevated prothrombin time (PT) & activated paial thromboplastin time (a. PTT); The PT and a. PTT are characteristically normal in TTP or HUS. Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS): Characterized by acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia. It is seen predominantly in children; most of the cases preceded by an episode of hemorrhagic diarrhea; Escherichia coli O157: H7 is the most frequent etiologic serotype, followed by Shigella dysenteriae This Shiga toxin (verotoxin) inhibits the endothelial production of ADAMTS13(normally ADAMTS13 metalloprotease cleaves large multimers of von Willebrand&; s factor). Absent ADAMTS13, these large multimers cause platelet clumping and intravascular hemolysis. Some children with complement protein deficiencies express atypical HUS (a. HUS), which can be treated with the liver transplant. Treatment of adult TTP/HUS is daily plasmapheresis; Patients with childhood HUS from infectious diarrhea are not given antibiotics, as antibiotics are thought to accelerate the release of the toxin and the diarrhea is usually self-limited.

The d-xylose test is usually performed by administering 25 g of d-xylose and collecting urine for 5 h. An abnormal test (excretion of <4. 5 g) primarily reflects duodenal/jejunal mucosal disease. The d-xylose test can also be abnormal in patients with blind loop syndrome (as a consequence primarily of an abnormal intestinal mucosa) and, as a false-positive study, in patients with large collections of fluid in a third space (i. e., ascites, pleural fluid). The ease of obtaining a mucosal biopsy of the small intestine by endoscopy and the false-negative rate of the d-xylose test has led to its diminished use.

Brain stores of glucose provide energy for 2 minutes after blood flow is interrupted, and oxygen stores last 8-10 seconds after the cessation of blood flow. Simultaneous hypoxia and ischemia exhaust glucose more rapidly. The electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythm in these circumstances becomes diffusely slowed, typical of metabolic encephalopathies, and as conditions of substrate delivery worsen, eventually brain electrical activity ceases. The presence of complexes occurring with a regular repetition rate (so-called periodic complexes) suppos a diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. The EEG generally slows in metabolic encephalopathies, and triphasic waves may be present. The findings do not permit differentiation of the underlying metabolic disturbance but help to exclude other encephalopathic processes by indicating the diffuse extent of cerebral dysfunction.

As such, it depends on sodium intake, effective intravascular volume, GFR, diuretic intake, and intact tubular reabsorptive mechanisms. With prerenal azotemia, the Fe. Na may be <1%, suggesting avid tubular sodium reabsorption. In patients with CKD, a Fe. Na significantly >1% can be present despite a superimposed prerenal state. The Fe. Na may also be >1% despite hypovolemia due to treatment with diuretics. Low Fe. Na is often seen early in glomerulonephritis and other disorders and, hence, should not be taken as prima facie evidence of prerenal azotemia. Low Fe. Na is therefore suggestive, but not synonymous, with effective intravascular volume depletion, and should not be used as the sole guide for volume management. The response of urine output to crystalloid or colloid fluid administration may be both diagnostic and therapeutic in pre\u0002renal azotemia. In ischemic AKI, the Fe. Na is frequently >1% because of tubular injury and resultant inability to reabsorb sodium. Several causes of ischemia-associated and nephrotoxin-associated AKI can present with Fe.
