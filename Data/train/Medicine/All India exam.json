        "exp": "Hypeension due to an occlusive lesion of a renal aery is renovascular hypeensionIn the initial stages, the mechanism of hypeension generally is related to activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Obstruction of the renal aery leads to decreased renal perfusion pressure, thereby stimulating renin secretion. Over time, possibly as a consequence of secondary renal damage, this form of hypeension may become less renin-dependent.As a screening test, renal blood flow may be evaluated with a radionuclide -ohoiodohippurate (OIH) scan, or glomerular filtration rate may be evaluated with a - diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) scan before and after a single dose of captopril (or another ACE inhibitor).Contrast aeriography remains the \"gold standard\" for evaluation and identification of renal aery lesions.Harrison 19e pg: 1618",

The A2 - OS interval is inversely propoional to the height of the left atrial-left ventricular diastolic pressure gradient. The intensity of both S1 and the OS of MS decreases with progressive calcification and rigidity of the anterior mitral leaflets. The pericardial knock (PK) is also high\u0002pitched and occurs slightly later than the OS, corresponding in timing to the abrupt cessation of ventricular expansion after tricuspid valve opening and to an exaggerated y descent seen in the jugular venous waveform in patients with constrictive pericarditis. A tumor plop is a lower-pitched sound that rarely can be heard in patients with atrial myxoma. It may be appreciated only in ceain positions and arises from the diastolic prolapse of the tumor across the mitral valve. The third hea sound (S3) occurs during the rapid filling phase of ventricular diastole. It can be a normal finding in children, adolescents, and young adults; however, in older patients, it signifies hea failure. A left-sided S3 is a low-pitched sound best heard over the LV apex. A right-sided S3 is usually better heard over the lower left sternal borderand becomes louder with inspiration. A left-sided S3 in patients with chronic hea failure is predictive of cardiovascular morbidity and moality. Interestingly, an S3 is equally prevalent among hea failure patients with and without LV systolic dysfunction. The fouh hea sound (S4) occurs during the atrial filling phase of ventricular diastole and indicates LV presystolic expansion. An S4 is more common among patients who derive significant benefit from the atrial contribution to ventricular filling, such as those with chronic LV hyperophy or active myocardial ischemia. An S4 is not present with atrial fibrillation Ref - Harrison's internal medicine 20e pg 1672",

These signs and symptoms arise from the rapid emptying of hyper\u0002osmolar gastric contents into the small intestine, resulting in a fluid shift into the gut lumen with plasma volume contraction and acute intestinal distention. Release of vasoactive GI hormones (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, neurotensin, motilin) is also theorized to play a role in early dumping . Treatment Dietary modification is the cornerstone of therapy for patients with dumping syndrome. Small, multiple (six) meals devoid of simple carbohydrates coupled with elimination of liquids during meals is impoant. Antidiarrheals and anticholinergic agents are complementary to diet. Guar and pectin, which increase the viscos\u0002ity of intraluminal contents, may be beneficial in more symptomatic individuals. Acarbose, an a-glucosidase inhibitor that delays diges\u0002tion of ingested carbohydrates, has also been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of the late phases of dumping. The somatostatin analogue octreotide has been successful in diet-refractory cases. This drug is administered subcutaneously (50 mg tid), titrated according to clinical response. A long-acting depot formulation of octreotide can be administered once every 28 days and provides symptom relief comparable to the sho-acting agent. In addition, patient weight gain and quality of life appear to be superior with the long-acting form. Ref - Harrison's internal medicine 20e pg 2237",

The toxic metabolite preferentially conjugates with hepatic glutathione to form nontoxic cysteine and mercapturic acid derivatives, which are then excreted by the kidney.However, following ingestion of a large overdose, the glucuronide and sulfate conjugation pathways are saturated resulting in a larger fraction of the drug being metabolized the cytochrome P-450 pathway and therefore, the amount of acetaminophen metabolized to the reactive intermediate increases. The increased formation of the reactive metabolite may deplete the hepatic stores of glutathione with subsequent binding of the metabolite to protein molecules within the hepatocyte resulting in cellular necrosis.N-acetylcysteine replenishes the glutathione stores of liver and prevents binding of the toxic metabolite to other cellular constituents(ref: Goodman Gilman 11/e p694)",

Under pathologic conditions, forceful atrial contraction generates a low-frequency sound (S4) just before the first hea sound (S1).S4 is also termed the atrial diastolic gallop or the presystolic gallop.Atrial contraction must be present for the production of S4. It is absent in atrial fibrillation.The S4 follows the onset of the P wave of the ECG by approximately70 ms.S 4 has a very low frequency--usually 20 cycles/sec or less. (Guyton and Hall)Audibility of the S4 depends not only on its intensity and frequency but also on its separation from S1. A loud S1 also can mask the audibility of a preceding softer S4.The S4 is best heard at the apex impulse with the patient turned in the left lateral position. It varies considerably with respiration, usually being heard best during expiration.Both the intensity and timing of the S4 are closely related to the end-diastolic volume of the ventricle.Audible fouh hea sounds are usually accompanied by a palpable presystolic apical impulse in the absence of obesity, emphysema, and so foh.The S4 generated by a forceful right atrial contraction is usually heard best at the lower left sternal border. Unlike the left-sided S4, it tends to be accentuated with inspiration. It is also accompanied by prominent 'a waves' in the JVP.An audible S4 with a palpable presystolic impulse is common in patients with ischemic hea disease during an acute episode of angina and in the early phases of transmural MI.In patients with LV an aneurysm or idiopathic or ischemic cardiomyopathy, abnormal fouh hea sounds are commonly present and are often associated with an S3, producing a quadruple rhythm.Ref: Hurst's The Hea 13/e p288, Guyton & Hall's Textbook of Medical Physiology 12/e p266",

        "exp": "DEFINITION * Pulmonary embolism is the blockage of 1 pulmonary aeries by thrombus,fat or air emboli and tumour tissue. * It is the most common complication in hospitalised patients. * An embolus is a clot or plug that is carried by the bloodstream from its point of origin to a smaller blood vessel, where it obstructs circulation. ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS * Viually all pulmonary embolisms develop from thrombi(clots),most of which originate in the deep calf,femoral,popliteal,or iliac veins. * Other sources of emboli include tumours, fat, air, bone marrow, amniotic fluid, septic thrombi, and vegetations on hea valves that develop with endocarditis. * Major operations ,especially hip, knee, abdominal and extensive pelvic procedures predispose the client to thrombus formation because of reduced flow of blood through pelvis. * Travelling in cramped quaers for a long time or sitting for long periods is also associated with stasis and clotting of blood. The best treatment for a pulmonary embolus is prevention. Minimizing the risk of deep vein thrombosis is key in preventing a potentially fatal illness. The initial decision is whether the patient requires hospitalization. Recent studies suggest that those patients with a small pulmonary embolus, who are hemodynamically stable (normal vital signs) may be treated at home with close outpatient care. ref : harrisons 21st ed",

Valsalva decreases ventricular filling and leads to a narrower HOCM outlet. So, HOCM murmur becomes louder. Valsalva also allows more laxity in the chordae tendinae due to the less ventricular filling. This allows the mitral valve prolapsed and its murmur to become more prominent. In a case of aoic stenosis, when the Valsalva is performed, there is less volume in ventricle to be ejected. Hence the flow across the AS is less. So it softens. When the Valsalva is performed in a case of MR, backflow in MR ( without MVP ) is less. So it softens. Ref: Harrison; 20th edition",

This injury may be due to multiple types of head insults often labled traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an increase in PTE due to increasing TBI. PTE must be differentiated from posttraumatic seizures (PTS), which is a broader-spectrum term and signifies seizures that occur as a sequel to brain injury. Seizures that occur within 24 hours after brain injury are called immediate PTS. PTS that occur within 1 week after injury are termed early PTS, and seizures that occur more than 1 week after injury are termed late PTS. About 20% of people who have a single late posttraumatic seizure never have any fuher seizures, and these people should not be labeled as having PTE. The former definition of epilepsy required 2 unprovoked seizures, but the updated definition of epilepsy can be met with 1 unprovoked seizure and high likelihood of another. This blurrs the definition of PTS and PTE, but it is impoant to differentiate between the two.

With severe AR, the central jet width assessed by color flow Doppler imaging exceeds 65% of the left ventricular outflow tract, the regurgitant volume is >=60 mL/beat, the regurgitant fraction is >=50%, and there is diastolic flow reversal in the proximal descending thoracic aoa. Surveillance transthoracic echocardiography forms the cornerstone of follow-up and allows for the early detection of changes in LV size and/or function. On auscultation, in patients with severe AR, a low-pitched, rumbling mid-to-late diastolic murmur is heard at the apex. This is called the Austin Flint murmur. It is probably produced by the diastolic displacement of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve by the AR stream.It may be mistaken for MS but can be differentiated from MS murmur because the Austin Flint murmur is not intensified in presystole and becomes softer with the administration of amyl nitrite.Ref: Harrison's 18/e p1944, 1931",

In 1916, Hans Reiter described the triad of nongonococcal urethritis, conjunctivitis, and ahritis in a young German officer with bloody dysentery.The classic triad of the disease, namely urethritis, ahritis, and conjunctivitis, is present in only one third of the patients. Reactive ahritis is frequently associated with the human leukocyte antigen B27 (1-ILA-B27) haplotype. The etiology of reactive ahritis remains unceain. The most accepted theory about the pathophysiology of reactive ahritis involves initial activation by a microbial antigen, followed by an autoimmune reaction that involves the skin, eyes, and joints.

The onset of rheumatic fever usually occurs about two to four weeks after a strep throat infection. Rheumatic fever signs and symptoms -- which result from inflammation in the hea, joints, skin or central nervous system -- can include: Fever Painful and tender joints -- most often in the knees, ankles, elbows and wrists Pain in one joint that migrates to another joint Red, hot or swollen joints Small, painless bumps beneath the skin Chest pain Hea murmur Fatigue Flat or slightly raised, painless rash with a ragged edge Jerky, uncontrollable body movements (Sydenham chorea) -- most often in the hands, feet and face Outbursts of unusual behavior, such as crying or inappropriate laughing, that accompanies Sydenham chorea Complications Inflammation caused by rheumatic fever can last a few weeks to several months. In some cases, the inflammation causes long-term complications. Rheumatic fever can cause permanent damage to the hea (rheumatic hea disease). It usually occurs 10 to 20 years after the original illness, but severe cases of rheumatic fever can cause damage to the hea valves while your child still has symptoms. Problems are most common with the valve between the two left chambers of the hea (mitral valve), but the other valves can be affected. The damage can result in: Narrowing of the valve. This decreases blood flow. Leak in the valve. A leaky valve causes blood to flow in the wrong direction. Damage to hea muscle. The inflammation associated with rheumatic fever can weaken the hea muscle, affecting its ability to pump. Damage to the mitral valve, other hea valves or other hea tissues can cause problems with the hea later in life.

Stasis also can result from compression and kinking of the renal veins from retroperitoneal processes such as retroperitoneal fibrosis and abdominal neoplasms.

Renal vein thrombosis can also be sec\u0002ondary to nephrotic syndrome, paicularly membranous nephropathy.

When the murmur is soft, it can be heard best with the diaphragm of the stethoscope and with the patient sitting up, leaning forward, and with the breath held in forced expiration.In patients in whom the AR is caused by primary valvular disease, the diastolic murmur is usually louder along the left than the right sternal border.\"Cooing\" or musical diastolic murmurs suggest eversion of an aoic cusp vibrating in the regurgitant stream.A mid-systolic ejection murmur is frequently audible in isolated AR.

This murmur may be quite loud without signifying aoic obstruction.A third murmur sometimes heard in patients with severe AR is the Austin Flint murmur, a soft, low-pitched, rumbling mid-to-late diastolic murmur.

As such, it depends on sodium intake, effective intravascular volume, GFR, diuretic intake, and intact tubular reabsorptive mechanisms. With prerenal azotemia, the FeNa may be <1%, suggesting avid tubular sodium reabsorption. In patients with CKD, a FeNa significantly >1% can be present despite a superimposed prerenal state. The FeNa may also be >1% despite hypovolemia due to treatment with diuretics. Low FeNa is often seen early in glomerulonephritis and other disorders and, hence, should not be taken as prima facie evidence of prerenal azotemia. Low FeNa is therefore suggestive, but not synonymous, with effective intravascular volume depletion, and should not be used as the sole guide for volume management. The response of urine output to crystalloid or colloid fluid administration may be both diagnostic and therapeutic in pre\u0002renal azotemia. In ischemic AKI, the FeNa is frequently >1% because of tubular injury and resultant inability to reabsorb sodium. Several causes of ischemia-associated and nephrotoxin-associated AKI can present with FeNa <1%, however, including sepsis (often early in the course), rhabdomyolysis, and contrast nephropathy ref - Harrison's 20e pg 2107",
