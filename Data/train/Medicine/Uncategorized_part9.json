If the mother had circulating IgG anti-Rh, it would bind to the Rh antigen on the Rh-positive red blood cells, fixing the complement and lysing the target cells. A titer of greater than or equal to 1:8 is considered diagnostic. The direct Coombs test would be used to determine if anti-IgG or anti-C3 antisera can agglutinate the baby's RBCs. This would not be useful for determining whether circulating IgG antibody to the Rh factor is present in the serum from the mother.

Because of this slow turnover, it is not a good indicator of acute or mild hepatic dysfunction, only minimal changes in the serum albumin are seen in acute liver conditions. Hypoalbuminemia is more common in chronic liver disorders such as cirrhosis and usually reflects severe liver damage and decreased albumin synthesis. So it is useful in differentiating acute and chronic liver disease. Albumin levels are increased in dehydration, shock and hemoconcentration. It is decreased in chronic liver disease, malnutrition, malabsorption, malignancy (decreased production), nephrotic syndrome, burns, trauma, hemorrhage with fluid replacement, fistulas, enteropathy, acute or chronic glomerulonephritis (increased loss), pregnancy and CHF (hemodilution).

Preload: Is defined as the previous stretching of ventricular myocardial fibrils just about to begin a new systole. It is equal to the ventricular wall stress at end-diastole. In clinical practice, ventricular volumes appear to most closely approximate muscle fiber length. Afterload: Is the impedance that the ventricles are submitted at the onset of contraction. Impedance is considered to be the sum of extracardiac forces present in the systemic circulation opposing ventricular ejection and pulsating flow. Clinically, it is assumed to be the systemic vascular resistance, if there is no obstruction between the LV and aoa. Contractility: This is an intrinsic propey of the cardiac cell. It defines the work that the hea can perform at a given load. Contractility is primarily determined by the availability of intracellular calcium. Hea rate: Tachycardia reduces diastole period and consequently, the subendocardial blood flow, thereby reducing myocardial oxygen supply.",

The major indication for carotid sinus massage is the diagnosis of tachyarrhythmias in which the atrial activity is either absent or intermittently present. Carotid sinus massage is also useful in altering conduction within the AV node. Vagal stimulation,such as occurs with the Vasalva maneuver or carotid sinus massage can slow conduction in the AV Node sufficiently to terminate AVN/ PSVT (aerioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia). It is also helpful in some patients with normal hea rates; increased vagal tone may normalize a bundle branch block or localize the site of type I second-degree atrioventricular block and can be used for evaluation of the sensing function of permanent pacemakers. Carotid sinus massage is also an impoant diagnostic procedure in patients with suspected hypersensitivity of the carotid sinus. Massage of the carotid sinus is contraindicated in patients with diseased carotid aeries because of the risk of cerebrovascular accident.

Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) SSPE is a chronic complication of measles with a delayed onset and an outcome that is nearly always fatal This is considered a 'slow virus infection' and is believed to result from persistant infection with an altered measles virus that is harboured intracellularly in CNS for several years. Stage I (initial stage) * Subacute changes in behaviour or school performance including irritability, reduced attention, temper outbursts. Stage II (Second stage) * Outbursts believed to result from extension of inflammatory process to deeper structures in the brain Massive Myoclonus is the hallmark of this stage. Involuntary movements and repetitive mycoclonic jerks are seen Consciousness is maintained Stage III (Third state) : Believed to result from damage/destruction of deeper centres in blood ganglia Involuntary movements disappears and are replaced by choreoathetosis, immobility, dystonia and lead pipe rigidity.

Lewy bodies are filamentous inclusions that appear brightly eosinophilic on hematoxylin and eosin stain and accumulate in the cytoplasm of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in Parkinson disease. All the other inclusions listed in the answer choices have different pathologic significance. Granulovacuolar degeneration and Hirano bodies are intracytoplasmic inclusions found in hippocampal pyramidal neurons of Alzheimer patients and intellectually intact elderly people.

It is usually rapidly metabolised by the liver. Rapid administration of large quantities of stored blood may cause hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia when citrate binds calcium and magnesium. This can result in myocardial depression or coagulopathy. Patients most at risk are those with liver dysfunction or neonates with immature liver function having rapid large volume transfusion. Potassium Effects: Stored red cells leak potassium propoionately throughout their storage life. Irradiation of red cells increases the rate of potassium leakage. Clinically significant hyperkalaemia can occur during rapid, large volume transfusion of older red cell units in small infants and children Iron accumulation: Iron accumulation is a predictable consequence of chronic RBC transfusion. Organ toxicity begins when reticuloendothelial sites of iron storage become saturated.

        "question": "Hyponatremia results in: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Increased secretion of aldosterone All ion transpo processes in the late distal tubule and collecting ducts are stimulated by the steroid hormone aldosterone. This can increase the sodium reabsorption in this segment to a maximum of 2-3% of the filtered sodium loss Hyponatremia Sodium concentration in the serum is lower than normal. Sodium is the dominant extracellular cation and cannot freely cross the cell membrane. Its homeostasis is vital to the normal physiologic function of cells. Normal serum sodium levels are between 135-145 mEq/L. Hyponatremia is defined as a serum level of less than 135 mEq/ L and is considered severe when the serum level is below 125 mEq/L. In the vast majority of cases, hyponatremia occurs as a result of excess body water diluting the serum sodium and is not due to sodium deficiency. Hyponatremia is most often a complication of other medical illnesses in which excess water accumulates in the body at a higher rate than can be excreted (for example in congestive hea failure, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, SIADH, or polydipsia). Lack of sodium is viually never the cause of hyponatremia although it can promote hyponatremia indirectly. In paicular, sodium loss can lead to a state of volume depletion, with volume depletion serving as signal for the release of ADH (anti-diuretic hormone). As a result of ADH-stimulated water retention, blood sodium becomes diluted and hyponatremia results. Decrease in plasma sodium increases aldosterone secretion Renin-angiotensin system and direct stimulation of adrenal coex The etiology of hyponatremia can be categorized pathophysiologically in three primary ways, based on the patient's plasma osmolality. Hypeonic hyponatremia, caused by resorption of water drawn by osmols such as glucose (hyperglycemia or diabetes) or mannitol (hypeonic infusion). Isotonic hyponatremia, more commonly called \"pseudohyponatremia,\" is caused by lab error due to hyperiglyceridemia (most common) or hyperparaproteinemia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is by far the most common type, and is often used interchangeably with \"hyponatremia.\" (Hypotonic hyponatremia is categorized in 3 ways based on the patient's blood volume status. Each category represents a different underlying reason for the increase in ADH that led to the water retention and thence hyponatremia): - Hypervolemic hyponatremia, wherein there is decreased effective circulating volume even though total body volume is increased (by the presence of edema). The decreased effective circulating volume stimulates the release of ADH, which in turn leads to water retention. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is most commonly the result of congestive hea failure, liver failure (cirrhosis), or kidney disease (nephrotic syndrome). - Euvolemic hyponatremia, wherein the increase in ADH is secondary to either physiologic but excessive ADH release (as occurs with nausea or severe pain) or is due to inappropriate and non-physiologic secretion of ADH, i.e. syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion (SIADH). - Hypovolemic hyponatremia, wherein ADH secretion is stimulated by volume depletion. Chronic hyponatremia Sodium levels drop gradually over several days or weeks and symptoms and complications are typically moderate. Chronic hyponatremia is often called asymptomatic hyponatremia in clinical settings because it is thought to have no symptoms Acute hyponatremia Sodium levels drop rapidly Resulting in potentially dangerous effects, such as rapid brain swelling, which can result in coma and death.",

MR typically occurs 7-10 days after an AMI, though this onset may vary according to the mechanism of MR. Papillary muscle rupture resulting in MR occurs within 1-14 days. Mild-to-moderate MR is often clinically silent and detected on doppler echocardiography performed during the early phase of AMI. In this case, MR rarely causes hemodynamic compromise. Severe acute MR that results from the rupture of papillary muscles or chordae tendineae results in abrupt hemodynamic deterioration with cardiogenic shock.

C: ABVD In 1964, researchers at the National Cancer Institute developed the first combination chemotherapy that cured a number of patients who had relapsed following a standard radiation therapy regimen. This drug combination was called MOPP and was, for a long time, the standard treatment for Hodgkin's disease: Mustargen (mechlorethamine, nitrogen mustard) Oncovin (Vincristine, VCR) Procarbazine (Matulane) Prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone) MOPP has been mostly replaced by another combination chemotherapy called ABVD (Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine), which is now the standard chemotherapy regimen for Hodgkin's disease. However, MOPP may be used if there are lung or hea conditions present or allergies to any of the medications in the ABVD combination. Additionally, 30% to 40% of people will relapse after treatment with ABVD, which will require 'salvage' treatment with MOPP. VAD combination chemotherapy is used for multiple myeloma and CHOP combination chemotherapy is used for B cell chronic lymphoid leukemia",

The most common mutation is the three-base deletion removing a phenylalanine residue at position 508 of CFTR, called the F508 mutation. The basic defect is due to a defect in chloride permeability, which can result in the accumulation of mucus and can lead to stasis and obstruction. Both the upper and lower airways can be involved, and they can lead to frequent bronchial infections predominated early by Staphylococcus aureus and Hemophilus influenzae and in late disease by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Pulse deficit refers to the difference between the radial pulse rate and the hea rate counted by auscultation (Apical Ventricular Rate). Pulse deficit is produced when ventricular contractions are preceded by sho diastoles such that poor ventricular filling results in insufficient stroke volume to transmit the pressure wave out to the radial pulse. The radial pulse rate is always lower than the ventricular pulse rate. The most common cause ofpulse deficit is atrial fibrillationand pulse deficit has traditionally been believed to be a classical bedside sign for diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Pulse deficit may however be produced by any tachyarrhythmia (fast hea rate) or Extra-systoles (Premature Ventricular Contractions). Typically Pulse deficits generated by Multifocal PVC or PAC are small (<10/min) while those generated by Atrial Fibrillation are larger (>10/ min).

The prevalence of primary Sjogren's syndrome is approximately 0.5-1%, while 30% of patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases suffer from secondary Sjogren's syndrome The majority of Sjogren's syndrome patients have symptoms related to diminished lacrimal and salivary gland function. The principal oral symptom of Sjogren's syndrome is dryness (xerostomia). Ocular involvement is the other major manifestation of Sjogren's syndrome. Lymphoma is a well-known manifestation of Sjogren's syndrome that usually presents later in the illness. Persistent parotid gland enlargement, purpura, leukopenia, cryoglobulinemia, and low C4 complement levels are manifestations suggesting the development of lymphoma. Most lymphomas are extranodal, low-grade marginal zone B cell lymphomas and are usually detected incidentally upon evaluating the labial biopsy. Granulomas in salivary glands is seen in sarcoidosis.

The typical/most common variant of GBS is Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (AIDP). Diagnostic Features of Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (AIDP) I. Required for Diagnosis 1. Progressive weakness of variable degree from mild paresis to complete paralysis 2. Generalized hyporeflexia or areflexiae II. Suppoive of Diagnosis 1. Clinical Features a) Symptom progression: Motor weakness rapidly progresses initially but ceases by 4 weeks. Nadir attained by 2 weeks in 50%, 3 weeks 80%, and 90% by 4 weeks. b) Demonstration of relative limb symmetry regarding paresis. c) Mild to moderate sensory signs. d) Frequent cranial nerve involvement: Facial (cranial nerve VII) 50% and typically bilateral but asymmetric; occasional involvement of cranial nerves XII, X, and occasionally III, IV, and VI as well as Xl. e) Recovery typically begins 2-4 weeks following plateau phase. 0 Autonomic dysfunction can include tachycardia, other an-hythmias, postural hypotension, hypeension, other vasomotor symptoms. g) A preceding gastrointestinal illness (e.g., diarrhea) or upper respiratory tract infection is common. 2. Cerebrospinal Fluid Features Suppoing Diagnosis a. Elevated or serial elevation of CSF protein. b. CSF cell counts are <10 mononuclear cell/mm'. 3. Electrodiagnostic Medicine Findings Suppoive of Diagnosis a) 80% of patients have evidence of NCV slowing/conduction block at some time during disease process. b) Patchy reduction in NCV attaining values less than 60% of normal. c) Distal motor latency increase may reach 3 times normal values. d) F-waves indicate proximal NCV slowing. e) About 15-20% of patients have normal NCV findings. f) No abnormalities on nerve conduction studies may be seen for several weeks. III. Findings Reducing Possibility of Diagnosis 1. Asymmetric weakness 2. Failure of bowel/bladder symptoms to resolve 3. Severe bowel/bladder dysfunction at initiation of disease 4. Greater than 50 mononuclear cells/mm3 in CSF 5. Well-demarcated sensory level IV. Exclusionary Criteria 1. Diagnosis of other causes of acute neuromuscular weakness (e.g., myasthenia gravis, botulism, poliomyelitis, toxic neuropathy). 3. Abnormal CSF cytology suggesting carcinomatous invasion of the nerve roots NCV, nerve conduction velocity.",

        "question": "The mother of a child with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is very worried about whether her child will develop serious bleeding. When reassuring this mother, it might be helpful if the physician informs her that the threshold for generalized bleeding is about how many platelets/mm3?",
        "exp": "Normal platelet counts are in the 150,000-450,000/mm3 range. It is useful to know that peripheral blood platelet counts less than about 15,000-20,000/mm3 are required before generalized bleeding usually occurs. Few physicians choose to actively treat patients who are not currently bleeding and whose platelet counts are greater than 100,000/mm3. Clearly, patients with counts less than 15,000/mm3 probably require active therapy, possibly with platelet transfusions. However, there is more disagreement about how to handle patients with counts in the 20,000-50,000/mm3 range, and you may encounter some physicians who will attempt to transfuse these patients. (However, this practice is no longer recommended by the American Blood Bank Association unless the patients is actively bleeding.) Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is due to an autoimmune attack on the platelets, leading to their clearing by the spleen. Splenectomy may be helpful in refractory cases. A count of 5,000 platelets/mm3 dangerously low, and platelet transfusion should have been considered earlier. Some physicians will give platelet transfusions for actively bleeding patients with counts of 50,000/mm3. Platelet counts of 100,000/mm3 do not usually require platelet transfusion, even when bleeding. Ref: Diz-Kucukkaya R., Chen J., Geddis A., Lopez J.A. (2010). Chapter 119. Thrombocytopenia. In J.T.

A prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor (indomethacin) may be added. Thiazide diuretics and salt restriction can reduce urinary output by inducing a state of mild volume contraction thereby promoting increased proximal reabsorption of isotonic fluid and inhibiting the delivery of free water to the collecting duct. A combination of thiazide - amiloride formulation will avoid thiazide induced hypokalemia. Addition of Indomethacin may fuher reduce urinary output by inhibiting prostaglanding synthesis-Harrison Thiazide diuretics in combination with amiloride and indomethacin are the most useful pharmacological agents in the treatment of Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus'- Pediatric Endocrinology (CDC Press) 2007/668 Desmopressin is usually ineffective in Congenital Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus.

Resetting a pheochromocytoma is a high-risk surgical procedure and an experienced surgeon/anesthesiologist team is required. Some form of preoperative pharmacologic preparation is indicated for all patients with catecholamine-secreting neoplasms. Preoperative medical therapy is aimed at: Controlling hypeension (including preventing a hypeensive crisis during surgery) o Volume expansion In patients with undiagnosed pheochromocytomas who undergo surgery for other reasons (and who therefore have not undergone preoperative medical therapy), surgical moality rates are high due to lethal hypeensive crises, malignant arrhythmias, and multiorgan failure. Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade is the most common approach to control blood pressure and prevent intraoperative hypeensive crises. Alpha-adrenergic blockade An alpha-adrenergic blocker is given 10 to 14 days preoperatively to normalize blood pressure and expand the contracted blood volume. Phenoxybenzamine is the preferred drug for preoperative preparation to control blood pressure and arrhythmia in most centers in the United States. It is an irreversible, long-acting, nonspecific alpha-adrenergic blocking agent. The initial dose is 10 mg once or twice daily, and the dose is increased by 10 to 20 mg in divided doses every two to three days as needed to control blood pressure and spells. The final dose of phenoxybenzamine is typically between 20 and 100 mg daily. Beta-adrenergic blockade After adequate alpha-adrenergic blockade has been achieved, beta-adrenergic blockade is initiated, which typically occurs two to three days preoperatively. The beta-adrenergic blocker should never be staed first because blockade of vasodilatory peripheral betaadrenergic receptors with unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation can lead to a fuher elevation in blood pressure. The alternatives to a and 13 adrenergic agents are calcium channel blockers and metyrosine. Calcium channel blockers Although perioperative alpha-adrenergic blockade is widely recommended, a second regimen that has been utilized involves the administration of a calcium channel blocker. Nicardipine is the most commonly used calcium channel blocker in this setting; the staing dose is 30 mg twice daily of the sustained release preparation. Metyrosine Another approach involves the administration of metyrosine (alpha-methyl Para-tyrosine), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis.",

This test is most often performed as a screening test for kidney disease. Normally, protein is not appears in urine when a routine dipstick test is performed. Normal values for a random urine sample are approximately 0 to 8 mg/ dL. If higher may be due to diabetic nephropathy. Microalbuminuria test measures for small quantities of protein commonly albumin in the urine sample. The amount of water in urine can vary and affect the concentration of albumin. Thus amount of creatinine is also measured and the result is repoed as the ratio of albumin to creatinine. This test is earliest sensitive test to diagnose diabetic nephropathy as albuminuria is the earliest manifestation of diabetic nephropathy. Abnormal levels of the protein (mostly albumin) in the urine signal the beginning of a condition called microalbuminuria, often noted in diabetic nephropathy. 30 to 300 mgs of albumin in 2 different 24 hour urine samples is diagnosed as microalbuminuria. More than 300 mgs of albumin is diagnosed as albuminuria. BUN (Blood urea nitrogen), Urea nitrogen is formed when protein are breaks down. The normal value will be in the range of 7 - 20 mg/ dl. Higher than normal level may be an indication for kidney disease. Serum creatinine test measures creatinine level in blood. Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine, an impoant pa of muscle. This test is done to examine kidney function. If kidney function is abnormal, blood has increased level of creatinine, due to decreased excretion of creatinine in the urine. Creatinine levels will vary depends on the person's size and muscle mass. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), which is the best way to find how well the kidney functions. GFR can be calculated from the blood creatinine, age, race, gender and other factors. GFR value is helpful to determine the stage of kidney disease and helps to plan fuher treatment. Ultrasound or CT scan is helpful to find any physical structural abnormalities, that is the kidney is larger or smaller than normal. Kidney biopsy",

D: Protruding jaw Predisposing factors to the sleep apnea/ hypoapnea syndrome include being male, which doubles the risk probably due to a testosterone effect on the upper airway, and obesity, found in about half of the patients, because parapharyngeal fat deposits tend to narrow the pharynx.
