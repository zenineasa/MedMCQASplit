Aim: o Assessment ofproximal small intestinal mucosal function6. Principle: o D - Xylose is a carbohydrate absorbed almost exclusively in the small intestineQ. o It does not require pancreatic enzymes for its digestion. So. if there is any decrease in its level in urine. It indicates abnormalityQ in carbohydrate absorption in proximal intestine. Procedure: o 25g of D - xylose is given to the patient, then urine is collected after 5 hours Xylose le\\>el is measured in the urine. Result: o Presence of D- xylose less than 4. 5g reflects the presence of duodenal jejunal mucosal disease. Clinical implication of D - Xylose Test. Urine D - Xylose is decreased inD - Xylose Test is normal in the following conditionso Intestinal malabsorption. Qo Impaired renal function. Qo Small bowel ischemia. Qo Whipple s diseaseo Viral gastroenteritiso Bacterial overgrowthQ in small intestineo Malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency. Qo Post gastrectomy. Qo Malnutrition",

Irritable bowel syndrome is a gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by altered bowel habits and abdominal pain in the absence of detectable structural abnormalities. No clear diagnostic markers exist for IBS, thus all the definitions of the disease are based on the clinical presentation. Abdominal pain. It is a prerequisite clinical feature of IBS. Abdominal pain in IBS is highly variable in intensity and location. Most commonly it is localized to hypogastrium. Altered bowel habits. Alteration in bowel habit is the most consistent clinical feature The most common pattern is constipation alternating with diarrhoea. Gas and flatulence. Patients with IBS frequently complain of abdominal distension and increased belching or flatulence, all of which they attribute to increased gas. Upper Gastrointestinal Symptoms. Between 25-50% of patients with IBS complain of dyspepsia, heart burns, nausea and vomiting. Remember that no anatomic, microbiological or biochemical abnormality has been demonstrated in these patients. Also know. Rome II criteria for diagnosis of IBSAt least 12 weeks, which need not be consecutive in the preceding 12 months of abdominal discomfort or pain that has two of following three features. Relieved by defecation. Onset associated with changes in stool frequency. Onset associated with changes in stool form.

Small intestinal biopsy in celiac sprueo The small intestinal biopsy is characteristic but not specific. o Similar features are observed in tropical sprue. The characteristic features areo Findings are localized to the mucosa. o Overall mucosal thickness remains sameo Surface epithelium shows vacuolar degenerationo Flattening or blunting of the villio Hypertrophy of intestinal cryptso Infiltration of lamina propria with# Plasma cells# Lymphocytes# Eosinophils# Macrophages.

Clinical features-o The onset of Whipple s disease is insiduous and it is characterized by# Diarrhoea# Steatorrhea# Abdominal pain# Weight loss# Migratory large joint arthropathy# Fever# Ophthalmologic and central nervous system symptoms.# Dementia is a relatively late symptom and is an extremely poor prognostic sign. o CNS symptoms have been reported in 10% to 43% of patients with intestinal whipples.

Two signs that are characteristic of C. N. S. whipples disease are:# Occulomasticatory myorhythmia# Oculofacial skeletal myorhythmia. o Each consisting of slow rhythm & synchronised contraction (~l/sec) of ocular, facial or other muscles. o They occur in < 20 % of cases. o They have not been documented in other CNS diseases. Diagnosiso The diagnosis of Whipple's disease is suggested by a multisystem disease in a man with diarrhoea and steatorrhoea. o The primary approach to establish diagnosis in these cases is to obtain tissue biopsies from small intestine. o On biopsy the hallmark of Whipple's disease is the presence of distended macrophages within the small intestine mucosa. These macrophages contains PAS positive diastase resistant granules (which are lysosomes stuffed with partially digested microorganisms) and rod shaped micro organism. o Earlier the diagnosis was entirely based on demonstration of these PAS positive macrophages with organisms but it is now recognized that PAS positive macrophages may also be seen in AIDS patients with mycobacterium avium complex.# So, now PCR testing of infected tissue is the optimal way to confirm the diagnosis and monitor the t/t.",
