Compliance (stretchabilitv) = 1/ elasticity(stiffness). Greater the compliance = easier for the lungs to expand. Compliance depends upon = tissue elasticity (25%) + surface tension (75%). Surfactant synthesized by alveolar type 2 cells. Increased collagen= decrease compliance. Restrictive lung disease (fibrosis) = increases collagen= decreases compliance. Obstructive lung disease (emphysema) = collagen and elasticity decrease = increases compliance. Compliance increases with age. Laplaces law states collapsing pressure is inversely proportional to the radius of the alveoli. Emphysema: Increased RV & FRCRestrictive lung: Decreased FRC & TLC",
