        "exp": "The formation of a clot in the body is a complex process that involves multiple substances called clotting factors. Warfarin decreases the body's ability to form blood clots by blocking the formation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Vitamin K is needed to make clotting factors and prevent bleeding. Therefore, by giving a medication that blocks the clotting factors, your body can stop harmful clots from forming and prevent clots from getting larger. The goal of warfarin therapy is to decrease the clotting tendency of blood, not to prevent clotting completely. Therefore, the effect of warfarin must be monitored carefully with blood testing. On the basis of the results of the blood test, your daily dose of warfarin will be adjusted to keep your clotting time within a target range. The blood test used to measure the time it takes for blood to clot is referred to as a prothrombin time test, or protime (PT). The PT is repoed as the International Normalized Ratio (INR). The INR is a standardized way of expressing the PT value. The INR ensures that PT results obtained by different laboratories can be compared. It is impoant to monitor the INR (at least once a month and sometimes as often as twice weekly) to make sure that the level of warfarin remains in the effective range. If the INR is too low, blood clots will not be prevented, but if the INR is too high, there is an increased risk of bleeding. This is why those who take warfarin must have their blood tested so frequently. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg963",

Similarly, outcomes are poor in children with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with monosomy 7 treated by chemotherapy, immunosuppressive drugs or suppoive measures Myelodysplastic syndrome AML arising from a pre-existing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloproliferative disease (so-called secondary AML) has a worse prognosis, as does treatment-related AML arising after chemotherapy for another previous malignancy. Both of these entities are associated with a high rate of unorable cytogenetic abnormalities Cytogenetics The single most impoant prognostic factor in AML is cytogenetics, or the chromosomal structure of the leukemic cell. Ceain cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with very good outcomes (for example, the (15;17) translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia). About half of people with AML have \"normal\" cytogenetics; they fall into an intermediate risk group. A number of other cytogenetic abnormalities are known to associate with a poor prognosis and a high risk of relapse after treatment. Genotype A large number of molecular alterations are under study for their prognostic impact in AML. However, only FLT3-ITD, NPM1, CEBPA and c-KIT are currently included in validated international risk stratification schema. These are expected to increase rapidly in the near future. FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITDs) have been shown to confer a poorer prognosis in AML with normal cytogenetics. Several FLT3 inhibitors have undergone clinical trials, with mixed results. Two other mutations - NPM1 and biallelic CEBPA are associated with improved outcomes, especially in people with normal cytogenetics and are used in current risk stratification algorithms. Researchers are investigating the clinical significance of c-KIT mutations in AML. These are prevalent, and potentially clinically relevant because of the availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c-KIT pharmacologically. It is expected that additional markers (e.g., RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53) that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations. The prognostic impoance of other mutated genes (e.g., DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2) is less clear. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 789",

        "exp": "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare X-linked recessive disease characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), immune deficiency, and bloody diarrhea (secondary to the thrombocytopenia). The microthrombocytes seen in WAS patients have only been observed in one other condition, ARPC1B deficiency. In both conditions the defective platelets are thought to be removed from circulation by the spleen and/or liver, leading to low platelet counts. WAS patients have increased susceptibility to infections, paicularly of the ears and sinuses, and this immune deficiency has been linked to decreased antibody production and the inability of immune T cells to effectively combat infection. Genetics WAS is associated with mutations in a gene on the sho arm of the X chromosome (Xp11.23) that was originally termed the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein gene and is officially known as WAS (Gene ID: 7454).X-linked thrombocytopenia is also linked to WAS mutations, although they differ from those that cause full-blown WAS. The rare disorder X-linked neutropenia has also been linked to a specific subset of WAS mutations. The protein product of WAS is known as WASp. It contains 502 amino acids and is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells (the cells in the bone marrow that develop into blood cells). The main function of WASp is to activate actin polymerization by serving as a nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) for the Arp2/3 complex, which generates branched actin filaments. Several proteins can serve as NPFs, and it has been observed that in WAS platelets the Arp2/3 complex functions normally, indicating that WASp is not required for its activation in platelets. In T-cells, WASp is impoant because it is known to be activated T-cell receptor signaling pathways to induce coical actin cytoskeleton rearrangements that are responsible for forming the immunological synapse. The severity of the symptoms produced by WAS mutations correlate with their effects on WASp. Alleles that produce no or truncated protein have more severe effects than missense mutations. Although autoimmune disease and malignancy may occur with both types of mutations, patients with truncated WASp carry a higher risk. A defect in the CD43 molecule has also been found in WAS patients.

        "exp": "Richter's Syndrome (RS), also known as Richter's Transformation, is a rare complication of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL) and/or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL). It is characterised by the sudden transformation of the CLL/SLL into a significantly more aggressive form of large cell lymphoma. Richter's Syndrome occurs in approximately 2-10% of all CLL/SLL patients during the course of their disease. In the most cases the normally slow growing, or indolent, CLL transforms into a common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) known as Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). Rarer cases transform into Hodgkin lymphoma(HL)/Hodgkin Disease (HD), and some types of T-cell lymphomas also have been repoed The most common symptoms of Richter's Syndrome arise from a sudden and dramatic increase in the size of lymph nodes (also known as 'lymphadenopathy') characterised by usually painless areas of swelling in the neck, axilla, abdomen (most commonly in the spleen, also known as 'splenomegaly') or groin. Patients also often experience a dramatic increase in unexplained weight loss, fevers and night sweats (often collectively referred to as 'B-symptoms'). Other signs and symptoms may include low haemoglobin (anaemia) characterised by: increasing fatigue shoness of breath dizziness and possible palpitations low platelets (thrombocytopaenia) characterised by excessive bruising or bleeding an increase in serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or elevated serum calcium (hypercalcaemia) on routine blood tests. It is impoant to note that whilst some of these signs and symptoms may already be present to a lesser degree in people with previously diagnosed CLL/SLL, the possibility of Richter's Syndrome needs to be considered if there is a sudden and dramatic increase in these symptoms, which is not generally considered to be a typical feature of normally relatively indolent CLL/SLL disease. Richter's syndrome is a serious complication of CLL/SLL and unfounately is often fatal. If Richter's syndrome is diagnosed, it is advised that the person should seek recommended treatments, but also to get their lives in order to prepare for any outcome. You may wish to discuss an advanced health directive with your treatment team, to let them and your family know how you would like your health to be managed if your treatments are not successful Richter's Syndrome affects approximately 2-10% of patients with a prior diagnosis of CLL/SLL and can occur at any time throughout the course of the disease.

Bence Jones proteins are present in 2/3 of multiple myeloma cases. The proteins are immunoglobulin light chains (paraproteins) and are produced by neoplastic plasma cells. They can be kappa (most of the time) or lambda. The light chains can be immunoglobulin fragments or single homogeneous immunoglobulins. They are found in urine as a result of decreased kidney filtration capabilities due to renal failure, sometimes induced by hypercalcemia from the calcium released as the bones are destroyed or from the light chains themselves. The light chains have historically been detected by heating a urine specimen (which causes the protein to precipitate) and now by electrophoresis of concentrated urine. More recently, serum free light chain assays have been utilised in a number of published studies which have indicated superiority over the urine tests, paicularly for patients producing low levels of monoclonal free light chains, as seen in nonsecretory multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 789",

        "exp": "Anemia of chronic disease, is a form of anemia seen in chronic infection, chronic immune activation, and malignancy. These conditions all produce massive elevation of Interleukin-6, which stimulates hepcidin production and release from the liver, which in turn reduces the iron carrier protein ferropoin so that access of iron to the circulation is reduced. Other mechanisms may also play a role, such as reduced erythropoiesis Anemia is considered when RBCs count : < 4.5 million in males < 3.9 million in females Or Hemoglobin ( Hb ) content : < 13.5 gm % in males < 11.5 gm % in females In response to inflammatory cytokines, increasingly IL-6, the liver produces increased amounts of hepcidin. Hepcidin in turn causes increased internalisation of ferropoin molecules on cell membranes which prevents release from iron stores. Inflammatory cytokines also appear to affect other impoant elements of iron metabolism, including decreasing ferropoin expression, and probably directly blunting erythropoiesis by decreasing the ability of the bone marrow to respond to erythropoietin. Before the recent discovery of hepcidin and its function in iron metabolism, anemia of chronic disease was seen as the result of a complex web of inflammatory changes. Over the last few years, however, many investigators have come to feel that hepcidin is the central actor in producing anemia of chronic inflammation. Hepcidin offers an attractive Occam's Razor (parsimonious) explanation for the condition, and more recent descriptions of human iron metabolism and hepcidin function reflect this view. In addition to effects of iron sequestration, inflammatory cytokines promote the production of white blood cells. Bone marrow produces both white blood cells and red blood cells from the same precursor stem cells. Therefore, the upregulation of white blood cells causes fewer stem cells to differentiate into red blood cells. This effect may be an impoant additional cause for the decreased erythropoiesis and red blood cell production seen in anemia of inflammation, even when erythropoietin levels are normal, and even aside from the effects of hepcidin. Nonetheless, there are other mechanisms that also contribute to the lowering of hemoglobin levels during inflammation: (i) Inflammatory cytokines suppress the proliferation of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow.;(ii) inflammatory cytokines inhibit the release of erythropoietin (EPO) from the kidney; and (iii) the survival of circulating red cells is shoened Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 845",

There are two major subgroups of systemic sclerosis based on the extent of skin involvement: limited and diffuse. The limited form affects areas below, but not above, the elbows and knees with or without involvement of the face. The diffuse form affects also the skin above the elbows and knees and can spread also to the torso. Visceral organs, including the kidneys, hea, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract can also be affected by the fibrotic process. Prognosis is determined by the form of the disease and the extent of visceral involvement. Patients with limited systemic sclerosis have a 10-year survival rate of 75%; less than 10% develop pulmonary aerial hypeension after 10 to 20 years. Patients with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis have a 10-year survival rate of 55%. Death is most often caused by lung, hea, and kidney involvement.

        "question": "1750. Viral infection with haemolysis is seen in -",
        "exp": "The hepatitis B virus consists of a core containing DNA and a DNA polymerase enzyme needed for virus replication. The core of the virus is surrounded by surface protein (Fig. 22.24). The virus, also called a Dane paicle, and an excess of its surface protein (known as hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg) circulate in the blood. Humans are the only source of infection. Hepatitis B is one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Approximately one-third of the world's population have serological evidence of past or current infection with hepatitis B and approximately 350-400 million people are chronic HBsAg carriers. Hepatitis B may cause an acute viral hepatitis; however, acute infection is often asymptomatic, paicularly when acquired at bih. Many individuals with chronic hepatitis B are also asymptomatic. The risk of progression to chronic liver disease depends on the source and timing of infection (Box 22.36). Veical transmission from mother to child in the perinatal period is the most common cause of infection worldwide and carries the highest risk of ongoing chronic infection. In this setting, adaptive immune responses to HBV may be absent initially, with apparent immunological tolerance. Several mechanisms contribute towards this: * Firstly, the introduction of antigen in the neonatal period is tolerogenic. * Secondly, the presentation of such antigen within the liver, as described above, promotes tolerance; this is paicularly evident in the absence of a significant innate or inflammatory response. * Finally, very high loads of antigen may lead to so-called 'exhaustion' of cellular immune responses. The state of tolerance is not permanent, however, and may be reversed as a result of therapy, or through spontaneous changes in innate responses, such as interferon alpha (IFN-a) and NK cells, accompanied by host-mediated immunopathology. Chronic hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis or hepatocellular , haemolysis carcinoma, usually after decades of infection (Fig. 22.25). Chronic HBV infection is a dynamic process that can be divided into five phases (Box 22.37); these are not necessarily sequential, however, and not all patients will go through all phases. It is impoant to remember that the virus is not directly cytotoxic to cells; rather, it is an immune response to viral antigens displayed on infected hepatocytes that initiates liver injury. This explains why there may be very high levels of viral replication but little hepatocellular damage during the 'immune- tolerant' phase Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 875",

The two Coombs tests are the direct Coombs test (DCT, also known as direct antiglobulin test or DAT), and the indirect Coombs test (also known as indirect antiglobulin test or IAT). The direct Coombs test detects antibodies that are stuck to the surface of the red blood cells. Since these antibodies sometimes destroy red blood cells, a person can be anemic and this test can help clarify the condition. The indirect Coombs detects antibodies that are floating freely in the blood.. These antibiodies could act against ceain red blood cells and the test can be done to diagnose reactions to a blood transfusion The direct Coombs test is used to test for autoimmune hemolytic anemia--that is, a condition where the immune system breaks down red blood cells, leading to anemia. The direct Coombs test is used to detect antibodies or complement proteins attached to the surface of red blood cells. To perform the test, a blood sample is taken and the red blood cells are washed (removing the patient's own plasma and unbound antibodies from the red blood cells) and then incubated with anti-human globulin (\"Coombs reagent\"). If the red cells then agglutinate, the direct Coombs test is positive, a visual indication that antibodies or complement proteins are bound to the surface of red blood cells and may be causing destruction of those cells. The indirect Coombs test is used in prenatal testing of pregnant women and in testing prior to a blood transfusion. The test detects antibodies against foreign red blood cells. In this case, serum is extracted from a blood sample taken from the patient. The serum is incubated with foreign red blood cells of known antigenicity. Finally, anti-human globulin is added.

        "question": "Which of the following is true about CML in children?",
        "exp": "small percentage of patients diagnosed with CML are children and young adults. CML represents about 3 percent of newly diagnosed childhood leukemias. The treatment of children with CML is not standardized. It often follows guidelines developed for adults, even though there are differences between CML in children and adults in terms of disease presentation and progression. Some studies indicate that children and young adult patients have lower rates of complete cytogenetic and major molecular responses compared with older adults. Children and young adults might have a slightly higher risk of transformation to accelerated and blast phase. Children with CML should be treated by pediatric hematologist-oncologists (doctors who specialize in treating pediatric patients with blood cancer). The following TKI drugs are approved to treat CML in children: Imatinib (Gleevec(r)) Dasatinib (Sprycel(r)) Nilotinib (Tasigna(r)) Since children with CML may receive TKI therapy for much longer than adults and during periods of active growth, follow-up care is very impoant. In addition to testing their pediatric patients' responses to therapy, doctors should also monitor children's Height and weight--Doctors should consider a bone scan and a bone density scan if there is evidence of abnormal growth. Pubey--Doctors should refer patients to an endocrinologist if there is a delay in pubey. Thyroid function Hea--Patients should have an annual echocardiogram. Poor adherence to therapy, paicularly in adolescents and young adults, is an additional concern. With oral TKIs, it is impoant to follow the doctor's directions and keep taking the medication for as long as prescribed. Nonadherence to TKI treatment is known to increase the risk of lower response or possibly treatment failure. Taking into account the potential concerns of lifelong TKI treatment, researchers are studying stopping TKIs after a period of deep molecular response. Treatment-free remission is now considered a goal of treatment for selected patients and is a focus of study in various ongoing clinical trials. Intermittent TKI dosing is another potential method to reduce long-term side effects in pediatric CML patients, but more studies are needed to evaluate this approach. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is another treatment option. Because there have been no randomized controlled trials comparing stem cell transplantation and imatinib in children due to the small number of pediatric patients, the decision on how to treat CML has been individualized. Stem cell transplantation should be evaluated against the complications associated with lifelong TKI use. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 922",

It is diagnosed at an average age of 4.5 plus or minus 3.5 years, and it is twice as common in females. The clinical course of IPH is exceedingly variable, and most of the patients continue to have episodes of pulmonary haemorrhage despite therapy. Death may occur suddenly from acute pulmonary haemorrhage or after progressive pulmonary insufficiency resulting in chronic respiratory failure. There are several methods available for diagnosing and monitoring hemosiderosis including: Serum ferritin Liver biopsy MRI Serum ferritin is a low cost, readily available, and minimally invasive method for assessing body iron stores. However, the major problem with using it as an indicator of hemosiderosis is that it can be elevated in a range of other medical conditions unrelated to iron levels including infection, inflammation, fever, liver disease, renal disease and cancer. While liver biopsies provide a direct measure of liver iron concentration, the small sample size relative to the size of the liver can lead to sampling errors given the heterogeneity of iron concentration within the liver. Fuhermore, the invasive nature of liver biopsy and the associated risks of complications (which can range from pain, haemorrhage, gallbladder perforation and other morbidities through to death in approx 1 in 10,000 cases) prevent it being used as a regular monitoring tool. MRI is emerging as an alternative method for measuring liver iron loading because it is non-invasive, safer and generally cheaper to perform than liver biopsy; does not suffer from problems with sampling variability; and can be used more frequently than performing liver biopsies.

Patients with APS often possess antibodies recognizing Treponema pallidum PL/cholesterol complexes, which are detected as biologic false-positive serologic tests for syphilis (BFP-STS) and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) tests. Lupus anticoagulant (LA) Antibodies recognize b2GPI or prothrombin (PT) and elongate aPTT, implying that they interfere with the generation of thrombin by prothrombin .

Depending on the size of these proteins, they may be excreted through the kidneys. Kidneys can be damaged by the effects of proteins or light chains. Increased bone resorption leads to hypercalcemia and causes nephrocalcinosis, thereby contributing to the kidney failure. Amyloidosis is a distant third in the causation. People with amyloidosis have high levels of amyloid protein that can be excreted through the kidneys and cause damage to the kidneys and other organs. Light chains produce myriad effects that can manifest as the Fanconi syndrome (type II kidney tubular acidosis).

It causes a characteristic red or purple bruise-like rash and an increased tendency to bleed. Two distinct clinical syndromes manifest as an acute condition in children and a chronic condition in adults. The acute form often follows an infection and spontaneously resolves within two months. Chronic immune thrombocytopenia persists longer than six months with a specific cause being unknown ITP is an autoimmune disease with antibodies detectable against several platelet surface structures. ITP is diagnosed by identifying a low platelet count on a complete blood count (a common blood test). However, since the diagnosis depends on the exclusion of other causes of a low platelet count, additional investigations (such as a bone marrow biopsy) may be necessary in some cases. In mild cases, only careful observation may be required but very low counts or significant bleeding may prompt treatment with coicosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, anti-D immunoglobulin, or immunosuppressive medications. Refractory ITP (not responsive to conventional treatment) may require surgical removal of the spleen. Platelet transfusions may be used in severe cases with very low platelet counts in people who are bleeding. Sometimes the body may compensate by making abnormally large platelets. Signs include the spontaneous formation of bruises (purpura) and petechiae (tiny bruises), especially on the extremities, bleeding from the nostrils and/or gums, and menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding), any of which may occur if the platelet count is below 20,000 per ml. A very low count (<10,000 per ml) may result in the spontaneous formation of hematomas (blood masses) in the mouth or on other mucous membranes. Bleeding time from minor lacerations or abrasions is usually prolonged. Serious and possibly fatal complications due to extremely low counts (<5,000 per ml) include subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding inside the skull or brain), lower gastrointestinal bleeding or other internal bleeding. An ITP patient with an extremely low count is vulnerable to internal bleeding caused by blunt abdominal trauma, as might be experienced in a motor vehicle crash. These complications are not likely when the platelet count is above 20,000 per ml. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 676",

        "question": "The most effective treatment of CML is",
        "exp": "Therapies using medication Systemic therapy is the use of medication to destroy cancer cells. This type of medication is given through the bloodstream to reach cancer cells throughout the body. Systemic therapies are generally prescribed by a medical oncologist or a hematologist. Common ways to give systemic therapies include an intravenous (IV) tube placed into a vein using a needle or in a pill or capsule that is swallowed (orally). The types of systemic therapies used for CML include: Targeted therapy Chemotherapy Immunotherapy There currently 5 TKIs available for CML: Imatinib (Gleevec). Imatinib was the first targeted therapy approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for CML in 2001. It is taken as a pill once or twice a day. It works better than chemotherapy to treat CML and causes fewer side effects (see below). Nearly all patients with chronic phase CML have their blood counts return to healthy levels and their spleen shrink after receiving this drug. Most impoantly, 80% to 90% of patients newly diagnosed with chronic phase CML who receive imatinib no longer have detectable levels of cells with the Philadelphia chromosome. Imatinib may also be used to treat other types of cancer, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome. Dasatinib (Sprycel). Dasatinib is approved by the FDA as an initial treatment for patients with newly-diagnosed chronic phase CML and when other drugs are not working. It is a pill that is usually taken once a day, or sometimes twice a day depending on the dose. The side effects include anemia, a low level of white blood cells called neutropenia, a low level of platelets called thrombocytopenia, and lung problems that include fluid around the lung and/or pulmonary hypeension. The doctor will monitor a patient's blood counts frequently after staing dasatinib and may adjust the dose or stop giving the drug temporarily if the patient's blood counts drop too low. Dasatinib may also cause bleeding, fluid retention, diarrhea, rash, headache, fatigue, and nausea. Dasatinib requires stomach acid in order to be absorbed so patients should not take any anti-acid medications. Nilotinib (Tasigna). Nilotinib is also approved by the FDA as an initial treatment for patients with newly-diagnosed chronic phase CML and when other drugs are not working. It is a capsule that patients take by mouth twice a day on an empty stomach. Common side effects include low blood counts, rash, headache, nausea, diarrhea, and itching. Other possible but uncommon serious side effects include high blood sugar levels, fluid build-up, and inflammation of the pancreas or liver. The most serious side effect of nilotinib includes possibly life-threatening hea and blood vessel problems that can lead to an irregular heabeat, narrowing of the blood vessels, stroke, and possible sudden death. These side effects are very rare, but patients may need testing to check their hea health during treatment. There can be interactions with other medications that may increase these risks, so be sure to talk with your doctor about all medications you are taking. Bosutinib (Bosulif). In 2012, bosutinib was approved by the FDA to treat CML when 1 of the other TKIs was not effective or if a patient experienced too many side effects. The most common side effects include diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, low levels of blood cells, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, allergic reactions, and liver problems. Ponatinib (Iclusig). Ponatinib was also approved by the FDA in 2012 for patients when 1 of the other TKIs was not effective or if a patient experienced too many side effects. Ponatinib also targets CML cells that have a paicular mutation, known as T315I, which makes these cells resistant to other currently approved TKIs. The most common side effects include high blood pressure, rash, abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, dry skin, constipation, fever, joint pain, and nausea. Ponatinib may also cause hea problems, severe narrowing of blood vessels, blood clots, stroke, or liver problems. For CML, the target is the unique protein called the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase enzyme. Drugs that target the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase enzyme are called tyrosine kinase inhibitors or TKIs. These types of drugs can stop the BCR-ABL enzyme from working, which causes the CML cells to die quickly Bone marrow transplantation/stem cell transplantation A bone marrow transplant is a medical procedure in which bone marrow that contains leukemia is replaced by highly specialized cells, called hematopoietic stem cells, that develop into healthy bone marrow. Hematopoietic stem cells are blood-forming cells found both in the bloodstream and in the bone marrow. Today, this procedure is more commonly called a stem cell transplant, rather than bone marrow transplant, because it is the stem cells in the blood that are typically being transplanted, not the actual bone marrow tissue. Before recommending transplantation, doctors will talk with the patient about the risks of this treatment. They will also consider several other factors, such as the phase of CML, results of any previous treatment, and patient's age and general health. Although a bone marrow transplant is the only treatment that can cure CML, it is used less often now. This is because bone marrow transplants have a lot of side effects, while TKIs are very effective for CML and have fewer side effects. There are 2 types of stem cell transplantation depending on the source of the replacement blood stem cells: allogeneic (ALLO) and autologous (AUTO). ALLO uses donated stem cells, while AUTO uses the patient's own stem cells. In both types, the goal is to destroy cancer cells in the marrow, blood, and other pas of the body using chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and then allow replacement blood stem cells to create healthy bone marrow. Only ALLO transplants are used to treat CML. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 786",

        "exp": "An adult with fever and a white blood cell count of 20,000 cells/l with a left shift has an infection, which is not an indication for a bone marrow examination. Pancytopenia; documenting a myeloproliferative disease; ruling out multiple myeloma as the cause of a monoclonal spike; and evaluating a child with the fever, bone pain, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and an increased lymphocyte count for possible acute lymphoblastic leukemia are all valid indications for a bone marrow examination. Other indications include the work-up of metastatic disease to bone and staging for Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. As a general rule, bone marrow aspirates/biopsies are not usually necessary in: Diagnosing iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease, because iron studies are adequate Thalassemia syndromes, because hemoglobin electrophoresis is the gold standard test B12 or folate deficiency, because Bib red blood cell folate, and serum folate levels are usually sufficient Hemolytic anemias, because the reticulocyte count (marker for all hemolytic anemias), the direct and indirect Coombs test (autoimmune anemias), osmotic fragility (congenital spherocytosis), Heinz body preparations (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency), and hemoglobin electrophoresis (sickle cell and its variants) are sufficient in most cases Most bone marrow examinations are performed on the posterior iliac crest, since both a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy may be obtained in this area. A \"dry tap\" means that nothing was obtained on the bone marrow aspirate. A \"dry tap\" may be due to faulty positioning of the needle (most common cause), a marrow packed with cells (leukemia), a marrow replaced by fibrous tissue (agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and myelofibrosis secondary to metastatic disease), or anaplastic marrow. Normal components of a bone marrow examination and repo include: An evaluation of cellularity. Normally, there is an approximately 30% fat to 70% cell ratio (varies with age). Calculation of the myeloid to erythroid ratio, which is normally 3: 1 An evaluation of hematopoietic cell morphology and adequacy of numbers of megakaryocytes (platelet production) An estimate of the status of marrow iron stores with the Prussian blue stain. Absent iron characterizes iron deficiency; excess iron the anemia of chronic inflammation; and ringed sideroblasts, a sideroblastic anemia.

        "exp": "Mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) with B/T cell type is very rare. A 24-year-old male presented with fever, generalized body ache, cough and breathlessness, bleeding per rectum, epistaxis, and hepatosplenomegaly. His hemoglobin, total leukocyte count, and platelet count were 6.2 g/dL, 29.06 x 103/mL, and 20 x 103/mL respectively. Peripheral blood smear & bone marrow revealed > 80% blasts that were morphologically lymphoid. The blasts were negative for all cytochemical staining. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping was performed on peripheral blood using a 6- color flow cytometer Navios (Beckman Coulter) using CD1a, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD33, CD34, CD38, HLA-DR, CD45, CD56, CD61, CD64, Glycophorin A, CD117, cytoplasmicCD3, cytoplasmic CD79a, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). The blast cells on CD45 vs SSC exhibited two distinct populations, one (45.9%) with weak and another (23.7%) with moderate expression of CD45 and low side scatter. The population of blasts with weak CD45 expression was positive for CD19 (strong), CD10 (strong), cCD79a (moderate), HLA-DR (moderate), CD38 (weak) and TdT. The population of blasts moderately positive for CD45 was positive for cytoplasmic CD3 (moderate), cCD79a, CD7 (strong), CD1a (moderate), CD4 (strong), TdT, CD5 (moderate), and CD38 (strong), and negative for surface CD3, HLA-DR, CD8, and CD2 The final diagnosis of MPAL -B/T cell type was established. The diagnostic criteria of MPAL are based on expression of strictly T-lymphoid (cytoplasmic CD3)- and myeloid (MPO)-specific antigens, the latter demonstrated by either flow cytometry (FCM) or cytochemistry, and/or evidence of monocytic differentiation. B-cell lineage assignment in MPAL relies on strong expression of CD19 together with another B-cell-associated marker or, in cases with weak CD19, on the strong expression of at least 2 B-lineage markers.1 MPAL is very rare and constitutes <4% of all cases of acute leukemia. The most common type is MPAL- Myeloid/B cell type. The leukemic blasts very rarely exhibit clear evidence of both T and B lineage commitment. However, as CD79a and CD10 are frequently repoed in T-ALL, B/T MPAL should be differentially diagnosed.2 The precursor status of T lymphoblasts can be established by TdT, CD99, CD34, and/or CD1a positivity.3 The panel of antibodies used is impoant in the identification of the \"mixed\" phenotype. TdT and CD1a should be included in the panel when immaturity markers like CD34 are negative. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 933",

        "exp": "APL is unique among leukemias due to its sensitivity to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; tretinoin), the acid form of vitamin A.Treatment with ATRA dissociates the NCOR-HDACL complex from RAR and allows DNA transcription and differentiation of the immature leukemic promyelocytes into mature granulocytes by targeting the oncogenic transcription factor and its aberrant action. Unlike other chemotherapies, ATRA does not directly kill the malignant cells. ATRA induces the terminal differentiation of the leukemic promyelocytes, after which these differentiated malignant cells undergo spontaneous apoptosis on their own. ATRA alone is capable of inducing remission but it is sho-lived in the absence of concurrent \"traditional\" chemotherapy.As of 2013 the standard of treatment for concurrent chemotherapy has become arsenic trioxide, which combined with ATRA is referred to ATRA-ATO; before 2013 the standard of treatment was anthracycline (e.g. daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin or mitoxantrone)-based chemotherapy. Both chemotherapies result in a clinical remission in approximately 90% of patients with arsenic trioxide having a more orable side effect profile. ATRA therapy is associated with the unique side effect of retinoic acid syndrome. This is associated with the development of dyspnea, fever, weight gain, peripheral edema and is treated with dexamethasone. The etiology of retinoic acid syndrome has been attributed to capillary leak syndrome from cytokine release from the differentiating promyelocytes Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 922",

        "exp": "Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML, APL) is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a cancer of the white blood cells. In APL, there is an abnormal accumulation of immature granulocytes called promyelocytes. The disease is characterized by a chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARa or RARA) gene and is distinguished from other forms of AML by its responsiveness to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; also known as tretinoin) therapy. Acute promyelocytic leukemia was first characterized in 1957 by French and Norwegian physicians as a hyperacute fatal illness,with a median survival time of less than a week.Today, prognoses have drastically improved; 10-year survival rates are estimated to be approximately 80-90% according to one study Acute promyelocytic leukemia is characterized by a chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor-alpha gene on chromosome 17 (RARA). In 95% of cases of APL, retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA) gene on chromosome 17 is involved in a reciprocal translocation with the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) on chromosome 15, a translocation denoted as t(15;17)(q24;q21). The RAR receptor is dependent on retinoic acid for regulation of transcription. Eight other rare gene rearrangements have been described in APL fusing RARA to promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF also known as ZBTB16), nucleophosmin(NPM1), nuclear matrix associated (NUMA1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5B), protein kinase A regulatory subunit 1a (PRKAR1A), factor interacting with PAPOLA and CPSF1 (FIP1L1), BCL6 corepressor (BCOR) or oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold containing 2A (OBFC2A also known as NABP1) genes. Some of these rearrangements are ATRA-sensitive or have unknown sensitivity to ATRA because they are so rare; STAT5B/RARA and PLZF/RARA are known to be resistant to ATRA. The fusion of PML and RARA results in expression of a hybrid protein with altered functions. This fusion protein binds with enhanced affinity to sites on the cell's DNA, blocking transcription and differentiation of granulocytes. It does so by enhancing interaction of nuclear co-repressor (NCOR) molecule and histone deacetylase (HDAC). Although the chromosomal translocation involving RARA is believed to be the initiating event, additional mutations are required for the development of leukemia. RAR-a/PLZF gene fusion produces a subtype of APL that is unresponsive to tretinoin therapy and less responsive to standard anthracycline chemotherapy hence leading to poorer long-term outcomes in this subset of patients Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 922",
