        "exp": "CHEYNE-STOKES RESPIRATION It is also referred to as periodic respiration or cyclic respiration It is present in patients with advanced HF and low cardiac output. Etiology: Lengthy circulatory time and increased sensitivity to aerial PCO2 of respiratory center are causitive. During apneic phase, aerial PO2 falls and the aerial PCO2 increases. Such changes in the ABG content are responsible for the stimulation of respiratory center, thus resulting in hyperventilation and hypocapnia which is followed by recurrence of apnea.",
