Long term dietary compliance with a low protein, low salt diet has been shown to be superior to a low calcium diet in prevention of nephrolithiasis. A low calcium diet may increase the intestinal absorption of oxalate reducing the effectiveness of this therapy. Therefore low calcium diets are not recommended.

        "exp": "Pathophysiology of Graves\u2019 thyrotoxicosis\nThe thyrotoxicosis results from the production of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies directed against the TSH receptor on the thyroid follicular cell, which stimulate thyroid hormone production and proliferation of follicular cells, leading to goitre in the majority of patients. These antibodies are termed thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins or TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) and can be detected in the serum of 80\u201395% of patients with Graves\u2019 disease.\u00a0\nThe concentration of TRAb in the serum is presumed to \ufb02uctuate to account for the natural history of Graves\u2019 thyrotoxicosis. Thyroid failure seen in some patients may result from the presence of blocking antibodies against the TSH receptor, and from tissue destruction by cytotoxic antibodies and cell-mediated immunity.\nHashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis is characterised by destructive lymphoid in\ufb01ltration of the thyroid, ultimately leading to a varying degree of \ufb01brosis and thyroid enlargement. Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis increases in incidence with age and affects approximately 3.5 per 1000 women and 0.8 per 1000 men each year.\nIn the vast majority of cases, hypothyroidism results from an intrinsic disorder of the thyroid gland (primary hypothyroidism). In this situation, serum T 4\u00a0 is low and TSH is elevated, usually in excess of 20 mIU/L. Measurements of serum T 3\u00a0 are unhelpful since they do not discriminate reliably between euthyroidism and\u00a0hypothyroidism.\nReference: : Davidson P R I N C I P L E S\u00a0 \u00a0and Practice O F M E D I C I N E 23rd edition page no\u00a0 643,646, 640",

Clinical presentation can be hepatic, neurologic and psychiatric. Hepatic involvement results in hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatic decompensation. Neurologic involvement result in dystonia, incoordination and tremor. Psychiatric manifestations include behavioral disturbances, depression, hyperactivity or loss of sexual inhibition. Investigations show low ceruloplasmin, increased free copper levels and KF rings. The gold standard for diagnosis is liver biopsy with quantitative copper assays.

Hemolysis regularly produces in the serum an increase in unconjugated bilirubin and aspaate transaminase (AST); urobilinogen will be increased in both urine and stool. If hemolysis is mainly intravascular, the telltale sign is hemoglobinuria (often associated with hemosiderinuria); in the serum there is increased hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is increased, and haptoglobin is reduced. In contrast, the bilirubin level may be normal or only mildly elevated. The main sign of the erythropoietic response by the bone marrow is an increase in reticulocytes.

Pulse Deficit in Atrial Fibrillation Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of pulse deficit (Pulse deficit has traditionally been believed to be a classical bedside sign for diagnosis of atrial fibrillation) Pulse deficit in Atrial Fibrillation is often more than 10 per minute. Pulse deficit in atrial fibrillation is greater when the ventricular rate is high Pulse deficit in atrial fibrillation may be absent in patients with slow ventricular rate (<50) If a digitalized patient with a prior diagnosis of chronic atrial fibrillation presents with a perfectly regular pulse, one should suspect digitalis intoxication with a regular nodal rhythm and atrioventricular dissociation.

Severe intravascular hemolysis may lead to a similar syndrome. Hyperphosphatemia alters calcium and phosphate ion solubility products, and calcium deposition in soft tissue may occur. The lower circulating concentrations of 1, 25 (OH)2D may fuher aggravate the hypocalcemia by impairing intestinal absorption of calcium. Hyperphosphatemic-induced hypocalcemia inhibits vitamin D synthesis and results in an increase in PTH secretion. Secondary hyperparathyroidism from long-term hyperphosphatemia is usually associated with renal insufficiency. Treatment should be directed towards the hyperphosphatemia in order to correct the hypocalcemia. Hypophosphatemia is more severe than hypocalcemia in vitamin D deficiency states because of the increased secretion of PTH, which is only paly active in elevating blood calcium but is capable of phosphaturia.",

Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN) is pure axonal neuropathy characterized by normal motor conduction velocity. Demyelinating neuropathies are typically associated with reduced conduction velocities. AIDP, HSMN and MMN are all demyelinating neuropathies characterized by reduced conduction velocity on nerve conduction studies. Demyelinating Versus Axonal Neuropathies The primary function of myelin is to increase axonal conduction velocity without a significant increase in axonal diameter. This function is achieved by a process of saltatory conduction, in which nerve impulses jump between electrically excitable regions of the axon, called nodes of Ranvier located between elctrically insulated areas ensheathed by myelinating Schwann cells. A demyelinating process disrupts the normal saltatory conduction along some axons within the nerve slowing the conduction velocity of these axons. As demyelination becomes more profound, conduction through some areas is blocked completely (conduction block), functionally disconnecting the motor neuron from the innervated muscle resulting in weakness. In axonal neuropathies the conduction velocity is typically either preserved or only midly reduced.

Tuberculosis is unlikely as it usually present with productive cough and the patient in question has a non productive dry cough. Also, bilateral diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates are not charachteristic of Tuberculosis. Interstitial Luna Diseases is unlikely as these disorders usually do not present with fever and weight loss, although bilateral reticulonodular infiltrates may be seen on chest x-Ray.

These oral agents, but not PEG IFN, should be used for interferon-refractory/intolerant and immunocompromised patients. PEG IFN is administered weekly by subcutaneous injection for a year; the oral agents are administered daily for at least a year and continued indefinitely or until at least 6 months after HBeAg seroconversion. Because the emergence of resistance can lead to loss of antiviral benefit and fuher deterioration in decompensated cirrhosis, a low-resistance regimen is recommended-entecavir or tenofovir monotherapy or combination therapy with the more resistance-prone lamivudine (or telbivudine) plus adefovir. Therapy should be instituted urgently. Because HBeAg seroconversion is not an option, the goal of therapy is to suppress HBV DNA and maintain a normal ALT. PEG IFN is administered by subcutaneous injection weekly for a year; caution is warranted in relying on a 6-month posttreatment interval to define a sustained response, because the majority of such responses are lost thereafter. Oral agents, entecavir or tenofovir, are administered daily, usually indefinitely or, until as very rarely occurs, virologic and biochemical responses are accompanied by HBsAg seroconversion.",

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) should be given to all patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with haemoglobin levels consistently below II g/dl. This applies equally to: Patients with CKD (stages 1-5) developing anaemia Patients with CKD stage 5 treated with haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) Transplant patients with chronic renal insufficiency and anaemia. Strategies for treatment of Anemia in Chronic Renal Failure Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have emerged as the treatment of choice for anemia in chronic renal disease. They should be given to all patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with haemoglobin (Hb) levels consistently below 11 g/dl All chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with renal anaemia undergoing treatment with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) should be given supplementary iron to maintain adequate bone marrow iron stores Intravenous administration is the optimum route for the delivery of iron to patients with CKD, as oral iron is poorly absorbed in uremic individuals. Blood Transfusion Red blood cell transfusions should be avoided, if at all possible, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those awaiting kidney transplantation. Transfusions should not be given unless patients have one or more of the following: Symptomatic anaemia (fatigue, angina, dyspnoea) and/or associated risk factors (diabetes, hea failure, coronary aery disease, aeriopathy ) Acute worsening of anaemia due to blood loss (haemorrhage or surgery) or haemolysis Severe resistance to, or hyporesponsiveness to ESA therapy, e.g. due to the presence of a haematological disease or severe inflammatory systemic disease. Androgens Prior to the introduction of ESA therapy, androgens were widely used in the treatment of renal anaemia. There is evidence that androgens may potentiate the effect of exogenous erythropoietic protein and also stimulate erythropoiesis by enhancing erythrocyte stemcell differentiation The risk of liver disease and malignancy, virilisation and hirsutism in women, priapism in men and disfiguring acne in patients of both sexes may outweigh the benefits of androgen therapy in most anaemic patients.

It should be distinguished from secondary hyperparathyroidism, in which there is a physiological increase in PTH secretion to compensate for prolonged hypocalcaemia (such as in vitamin D de\ufb01ciency), and from tertiary hyperparathyroidism, in which continuous stimulation of the parathyroids over a prolonged period of time results in adenoma formation and autonomous PTH secretion. This is most commonly seen in individuals with advanced chronic kidney disease.\nThe prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism is about 1 in 800 and it is 2\u20133 times more common in women than men; 90% of patients are over 50 years of age. It also occurs in the familial MEN syndromes, in which case hyperplasia or multiple adenomas of all four parathyroid glands are more likely than a solitary adenoma.\nCarcinomas of parathyroid glands are also associated with hyperparathyroidism.\n\u00a0\nReference: : Davidson P R I N C I P L E S\u00a0 \u00a0and Practice O F M E D I C I N E 23rd edition page no\u00a0 663",

The pseudoseizures frequently are triggered by bizarre stimuli, and the pattern of the seizure changes often. The patient actually is awake and aware of his or her surroundings and events and can recall them later. Pseudoseizures usually can be distinguished both clinically and by the electroencephalogram (EEG) findings. In patients with pseudoseizures resembling tonic-clonic attacks, there may be warning and preparation before the attack; there is usually no tonic phase, and the clonic phase consists of wild thrashing movements during which the patient rarely comes to harm or is incontinent. Ictal eye closure is common.

There is no postictal confusion or abnormal clinical signs after the attack. The EEG, if recorded during an episode, does not show organized seizure activity, and postictal slowing does not occur.

If the tumor extends outside the sella, visual field defects or other mass effects can occur. Diagnosis of prolactinoma is likely with a PRL level >200mg/L. Oral dopamine agonists (cabergoline and bromocriptine) are the mainstay of therapy for patient with micro or macroprolactinomas. They suppress PRL secretion and synthesis as well as lactotrope cell proliferation. Indications for surgical adenoma debulking include dopamine resistance or intolerance, presence of an invasive macroadenoma with compromised vision that fails to improve after drug treatment.

        "exp": "Answer is A (Narrow QRS complexes) WPW syndrome is characteristically associated with a wide QRS complex. WPW Syndrome : Features Wolf Parkinson White syndrome is caused by the presence of on additional / accessory pathway (connection) between the atria and ventricle. Normally the AV node is the only pathway that allows electrical connection between atria and ventricles and allows some delay in conduction of impulses from atrial to ventricles. Accessory bundles do not have an AV node to delay conduction and form such a direct connection between atrium and ventricle -- This constitutes WPW syndrome. A depolarization wave reaches the ventricle early and causes premature excitation of ventricles -- preexcitation.Q Paroxysmal tachycardias Q are produced as a result of such preexcitation. The acessary pathway (called bundle of Kent) may be present as a connection between the left atrium and left ventricle (Left sided) or as a connection between the right atrium and right ventricle (Right sided). Pre excitation resulting from left sided accessory pathways is called Type A Pre-excitation Pre excitation resulting from right sided accessory pathway is called Type B Pre-excitation The most common accessary pathways leading to pre-excitation syndromes (WPW) are left sided (connecting left atrium to left ventricle)e Left free wall accessory pathways are most common. `Left free wall accessary pathways are most common followed by posteroseptal, right free wall and anteroseptal locations' -Braunwald Hea Diseases: Review & Assessment' by Lilly (2012)/Q249 The most common macro-reentrant tachycardia associated WPW syndrome is ohodromic AV reentry.

        "question": "LBBB is seen with all except",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Hypokalemia Causes of LBBB are :- Aoic stenosis Ischaemic hea disease Hypeension Dilated cardiomyopathy Anterior MI Primary degenerative disease (fibrosis) of the conducting system (Lenergre disease) Hyperkalaemia Digoxin toxicity Ashmann phenomenon (has both LBBB and RBBB) Atrial fibrillation has a narrow complex qRS but Ashmann phenomenon seen in atrialfibrillation is characterized by broad complex qRS with usually a RBBB morphology. Thus if an impulse lands on the bundle of HIS and finds the right bundle refractory then RBBB will occur. Also remember that the refractory period of right fascicle ix more than that of the left fascicle resulting in RBBB mostly in these patients. ECG findings of LBBB Normally the septum is activated from left to right, producing small Q waves in the lateral leads. In LBBB, the normal direction of septal depolarisation is reversed (becomes right to left), as the impulse spreads first to the RV the right bundle branch and them to the LV the septum. This sequence of activation extends the qRS duration to > 120 ms and eliminates the normal septal Q waves in the lateral leads. The overall direction of depolarisation (from right to left) produces tall R waves in the lateral leads (IaVLV5V6) deep S waves in the right precordial leads (V4 R) and usually leads to left axis detion. As the ventricles are activated sequentially (right, then left) rather than simultaneously, this produces a broad or notched (`W-shaped) R wave in the lateral leads. Non-concordance in ST segment and T wave changes. The point is that the two fasciles of bundle of his have different refractory periods with the right fascicle having higher refractory period than the left. This means that if an impulse lands on the bundle of HIS and finds the right bundle refractory then RBBB will occur. In atrial fibrillation because of faster conduction, normally we see narrow complex qRS but sometimes we may see broad complex qRS also which is technically called Ashmann phenomenon. Mostly in Ashmann phenomenon RBBB is seen based on the physiological principle of refractory period of right fascicle more than the left one. However, rarely LBBB can also be seen if the impulse lands to find the left fascicle refractory. Irrespective of RBBB or LBBB, broad complex qRS will occur in case of atrial fibrillation and Ashmann phenomenon is occurrence of broad complex qRS in atrial fibrillation and not the occurrence of RBBB as is the popular perception. Hyperkalemia can cause defective repolarization and hence cause Bundle branch block that culminates in sine wave pattern. In acute MI, ischemia can damage the left bundle leading to LBBB.",

Membrane skeleton consists :? Spectrin - The chief protein component responsible for biconcave shape. Ankyrin and band 4-2 - Binds spectrin to band 3 Band 3 - A transmembrane ion transpo protein. Band 4.1 - Binds spectrin to glycophorin A, atransmembrane protein. Hereditary spherocytosis is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by intrinsic defects in red cell membrane. This results in production of red cells that are sphere (spherocytes) rather than biconcave. The mutation most commonly involves the gene coding for ankyrin, followed by Band-3 (anionic transpo channel), spectrin, and Band 4.2 (also called palladin). Also know Most common, defect in hereditary elliptocytosis is in spectrin Pathogensis of Hereditary spherocytosis Loss of membrane cytoskeleton proteins (ankyrin, spectrin, Band 3, 4.2) results in reduced membrane stability. Reduced membrane stability leads to spontaneous loss of membrane fragments during exposure to shear stresses in the circulation. The loss of membrane relative to cytoplasm forces the cells to assume the smallest possible diameter for a given volume cells become microspherocytes. Because of their spheroidal shape and reduced membrane plasticity, red cells become less deformable and are trapped in to spleen as they are unable to pass through the interendothelial fenestrations of the venous sinusoids. In the splenic sinusoides, red cells are phagocytosed by RE cells Extravascular hemolysis. Clinical features of Hereditory spherocytosis The clinical features are those of extravascular hemolysis : Anemia - Mild to moderate Jaundice (Mainly indirect bilirubin) - Splenomegaly Gall stones - Elevated excretion of bilirubin promotes formation of pigment stone. Leg ulcer - Rare clinical manifestation. Aplastic crisis - Triggered by parvo-virus infection.

Spinal meningiomas are primarily intradural tumors, although extradural meningiomas have been repoed in 3-15% of cases. Majority of spinal meningiomas are extramedullary intradural tumors.Q Spinal meningiomas are the second most common spinal intradural tumors after nerve sheath tumors (Schwannomas) Schwannomas are the most common intradural spinal tumors. Spinal meningiomas are rare in children and are primarily believed to be tumors of Adults. Spinal meningiomas can be found at any age but they are most commonly seen in the 5th to 7th decade. The mean age of diagnosis is -50 years. Most spinal meningiomas occur in woman (75-85%) Spinal meningiomas are most commonly seen in middle aged femalese Spinal meningiomas may be seen in the cervical spine, thoracic spine or the lumbar spine, but are most frequently seen in the thoracic spine. Within the spinal axis, meningiomas are most frequently seen in the thoracic/dorsal spine (70-80%) Most meningiomas are slow growing benign tumors, however higher grade tumors with more aggressive behaviour compose as many as 10% of all meningiomas. The most common and initial symptom of intraspinal meningiomas is pain'. This is followed by variable degree of neurological deterioration, causing defecits depending on tumor location. Impairment of Autonomic pathways are generally uncommon but bowel or bladder involvement can occur as late findings with meningiomas MRI is the investigation of choice for diagnosis of spinal meningiomas At MRI the tumor typically appears as a well-circumscribed lesion iso-intense or slightly hypo-intense to the spinal cord on T I and T2 weighted images. MRI typically shows intense and near homogenous enhancement after contrast (homogenous gadolinium enhancement) The 'dural tail sign ' consisting of dural enhancement adjacent to dural attachment may he seen in spinal meningiomas but this is not specific to meningiomas and may be seen in other conditions like metastasis, sarcoidosis, lymphomas etc.",

Data to suppo the use of Gefitinib in NSCCL are however diminishing and Gefitinib is most effective in females who have never smoked with adenocarcinoma on histology. Single agent cgemotherapy is prefered for elderly patients (> 70 years) American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends the use of single agent chemotherapy for elderly patients (> 70 years) with a poor performance status (2003 Guidelines) It has however now been stressed (2009 Guidelines) that age alone should not be used to select chemotherapy for patients with advanced NSCLC. Physiological Age (not chronological age) and performance status should be considered when selecting the chemotherapy regimen. Chemotherapy for Advanced (Stage IV) NSCLC Young patient Good performance status (PS < 2) Double agent chemotherapy is preferred for first line therapy Platinum based combinations are preferred over non platinum based combinations Elderly patient Poor performance status (PS 2) Single Agent Chemotherapy is preferred to reduce potential toxicity from chemotherapeutic agents. Vinorelbine or docetexal are often used for single agent chemotherapy in the elderly with a poor PS. Gefitinib is most effective for females with adenocarcinoma histology who have never smoked Gefitinib is an acceptable second line agent for treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC with adequate performance status when the disease has progressed during or after first line platinum based chemotherapy.

Consciousness returns as suddenly as it was lost i.e. Inset and termination of attack, both are abrupt. Usually accompanied by subtle bilateral motor signs such as - Rapid blinking of eye lids - Chewing movements - Small amplitude, clonic movements of hands There is no postictal confusion The seizure can occur hundreds of times per day. First clued to absence seizure is often unexplained 'day dreaming' and a decline in school performance recognized by a teacher.

He has been compliant with his medications, which are metaproterenol and inhaled betamethasone. Over the past 6 hours, his wheezing and shoness of breath have become increasingly severe. At present, his blood pressure is 136/84 mm Hg and with deep inspiration falls to 116/56 mm Hg. His pulse is 126/min, and respirations are 32/min and labored. There is retraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscles with inspiration. There are soft wheezes and poor air movement diffusely throughout both lung fields. His peak expiratory flow rate is 60 L/min, and he is immediately staed on an albuterol nebulizer and given IV hydrocoisone. His aerial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.55, pCO2 of 21 mm Hg, and a pO2 of 60 mm Hg. Twenty minutes later, a repeat peak flow rate is still 60 L/min. A repeat aerial blood gas reveals that his pH is now 7.46, his pCO2 is now 34 mm Hg, and his pO2 is 64 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
        "exp": "This patient is having a very severe asthmatic attack, as demonstrated by his severe shoness of breath, use of accessory muscles of respiration, and variation in blood pressure with breathing (due to establishing a very negative intrathoracic pressure with forced attempts at inspiration). The initial pO2 is markedly decreased at 60 (compared to the normal 100) mm Hg. His pCO2 is also decreased at 21 mm Hg initially, due to \"blowing off CO2\" with his increased respirations while trying to get enough oxygen. This causes his respiratory alkalosis with pH 7.55. He is then treated, but the treatment improves his pO2 only slightly. Despite this, his pCO2 rises, and his pH returns toward normal. This does not mean he is getting better. Instead, we are seeing worsening respiratory failure as his ability to ventilate decreases, causing the inappropriate rise in pCO2 even though he is still very badly hypoxic. This patient should therefore be prepared for possible intubation if there is not immediate improvement. Epinephrine no longer is used in the management protocols of acute asthma because of its high rate of toxicity. Administering 100% oxygen may be an adjunctive therapy, but at this point the patient is probably saturating above 90% anyway. Ref: Corbridge T., Hall J.B. (2005). Chapter 40. Status Asthmaticus.

The MCA supplies most of the outer convex brain surface, nearly all the basal ganglia, and the posterior and anterior internal capsules. Patients with middle cerebral aery stroke syndrome (MCA stroke syndrome) may have some basic physical findings, as follows: Main trunk occlusion of either side yields contralateral hemiplegia, eye detion toward the side of the MCA infarct, contralateral hemianopia, and contralateral hemianesthesia. Trunk occlusion involving the dominant hemisphere causes global aphasia, whereas involvement of the nondominant hemisphere causes impaired perception of deficits (anosognosia) resulting from the stroke and more qualitative deficits of speech. Superior division infarcts lead to contralateral deficits with significant involvement of the upper extremity and face and paial sparing of the contralateral leg and foot. Inferior division infarcts of the dominant hemisphere lead to Wernicke's aphasia. Such infarcts on either side yield a superior quadrantanopsia or homonymous hemianopia, depending on the extent of infarction. Right inferior branch infarcts also may lead to a left visual neglect.

Thus p24 Ag assay has its greatest use as a screening test for HIV infection in patients suspected of having the acute HIV syndrome as high levels of p24 Ag are present prior to the development of antibody.\n\nDetection of HIV RNA\n\nMeasurement of HIV RNA in the plasma of patients with HIV infection is also useful in conditions where measurement of anti-HIV antibodies is not possible e.g. in acute infections and in neonatal infections.\n\nCurrently, three assays are available for the diagnosis of HIV RNA.\n\nHIV RNA by PCR\nHIV RNA by bDNA\nHIV RNA by NASBA\n\nNote: In neonates, there is the passive transmission of antibodies from the mother. Thus the antibodies cannot be used for the diagnosis in this condition as it would be impossible to tell whether the antibodies detected are acquired from the mother or they have developed as a result of infection.\nWith the use of direct detection techniques, there is a decrease in the interval between infection and detection of (window period).\nWindow period for\n\nAntibody testing \u2192 22 days approximately\np24 Ag Assay \u2192 16 days\nHIV RNA \u2192 12 days.",

        "exp": "Cardiac cycle \n\nBy convention, the mechanical cycle is considered to begin at ventricular end diastole, the instant just before systole, when the ventricle begins to actively generate tension as signalled by a sudden rapid rise in intraventricular pressure.\nSoon after the ventricular systolic pressure begins to rise, it exceeds atrial pressure, the time when A. V (mitral and Tricuspid) \"close producing S1\u201d\nVentricular pressure then continues to rise rapidly until Aortic and pulmonary artery pressures are exceeded, resulting in the opening of the Aortic and pulmonary valve and the onset of a period of ejection of blood into the systemic and pulmonary circulation.\nNote, in the phase between A.V valve closure and Aortic pulmonary valve opening, the ventricular volume is constant. This phase of the cycle is termed isovolumetric contraction.\nAs the ejection proceeds, ventricular and AO/PA rise and then fall together. When ventricular pressure falls below Aortic pressure the Aortic and pulmonary valve close and ejection end. The closure of Aortic and pulmonary valve produce the \"second heart sound\".\nThe left ventricle continues to relax and its pressure falls rapidly until it drops below left atrial pressure when the mitral valve opens. Since Aortic and mitral valve was closed during this period, the ventricular volume is constant - this is called \"isovolumetric relaxation\".\nThe time when ventricular pressure falls below atrial pressure signals the onset of the ventricular filling period i.e. immediately after the A. V valve opens, there is a rapid inflow of blood into the ventricles (rapid filling phase).\nThis occurs due to A.V pressure gradient. This phase is characterized by (y wave) of the .I. VP\nFollowing the rapid filling phase, the A. V gradient diminishes markedly the filling slows and actually may come to a halt. This period when blood trickless down in ventricle is called diastasis.\nThe slow filling is immediately followed by the final filling event contraction of atria; which results in a second\nincrease in the A.V gradient and injection of an additional bolus of blood into the ventricle. (`a' wave of the JVP.)\n\nComing back to the question\nOption 'a'\n\nAt the end of ventricular diastole, the atria is almost empty pouring all its blood into the ventricle.\n\nOption 'c'\n\nDuring the ventricular diastole, the aortic valve is closed so naturally the Aortic flow is decreased.\n\nOption 'b'\n\n\"Phasic changes in coronary blood flow\"\nThe blood flow in the coronary artery falls during systole. The reason for this is the strong compression of the left ventricular muscle around the intramuscular vessels during systole.\nNote that it is opposite to other vessels of the body where blood flow increases during systole.\nDuring diastole, the cardiac muscle relaxes and no longer obstructs the blood flow through the left ventricular muscle capillaries, so that blood flows rapidly increases during all of diastole.",

The bacterium grows best at 37degC (human body temperature). Typhoid fever is characterized by a sustained fever as high as 40degC (104degF), profuse sweating, gastroenteritis, and nonbloody diarrhea. Less commonly a rash of flat, rose-colored spots may appear. In the first week, there is a slowly rising temperature with relative bradycardia. There is leukopenia with eosinopenia and relative lymphocytosis, a positive diazo reaction and blood cultures are positive for Salmonella Typhi or Paratyphi. The classic Widal test is negative in the first week. In the second week of the infection, the patient lies prostrated with high fever in plateau around 104degF (40degC) and bradycardia (Sphygmo-thermic dissociation), classically with a dicrotic pulse wave. Delirium is frequent. This delirium gives to typhoid the nickname of \"nervous fever\". Rose spots appear on the lower chest and abdomen in around 1/3 patients. There are rhonchi in lung bases. Diarrhea can occur in this stage: green with a characteristic smell, comparable to pea-soup. The spleen and liver are enlarged (hepatosplenomegaly). The Widal reaction is strongly positive with anti 0 and anti H antibodies. Blood cultures are sometimes still positive at this stage. In the third week of typhoid fever a number of complications can occur: Intestinal hemorrhage due to bleeding in congested Peyer's patches; this can be very serious but is usually non-fatal. Intestinal perforation in distal ileum: this is a very serious complication and is frequently fatal. Encephalitis Metastatic abscesses, cholecystitis, endocarditis and osteitis The yield of blood cultures is variable; sensitivity is as high as 90% during the first week of infection and decreases to 50% by the third week.",
