        "exp": "Hypersensitivity vasculitis, which is usually represented histopathologically as leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV), is a term commonly used to denote a small-vessel vasculitis. There are many potential causes of hypersensitivity vasculitis; however, up to 50% of cases are idiopathic. Hypersensitivity vasculitis may present clinically as cutaneous disease only or it may be a cutaneous manifestation of systemic disease. The internal organs most commonly affected in hypersensitivity vasculitis are the joints, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. Hypersensitivity vasculitis may be acute and self-limited, recurrent, or chronic. Overall, hypersensitivity vasculitis has a orable prognosis, paicularly when no internal involvement is present. Hypersensitivity vasculitis tends to affect the skin and occasionally the kidney. The loss of integrity of the capillaries and post capillary venules results in extravasation of red blood cells, usually causing purpura and a burning or minimally pruritic sensation. Hypersensitivity vasculitis is thought to be mediated by immune complex deposition. In this form of vasculitis, circulating antigens in the body (produced by factors such as medications, infections, and neoplasms) induce antibody formation. These antibodies bind to the circulating antigen and create immune complexes, which then deposit within vessels, activating complement and inducing inflammatory mediators. Inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, and local factors may affect the endothelial cells and play a role in the manifestations of this disease. Additionally, autoantibodies, such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), may be associated with disease manifestations. In ANCA-mediated vasculitis, intracellular proteins from neutrophils become expressed on the cell surface, leading to formation of antibodies (ANCA). These autoantibodies then bind neutrophils, subsequently leading to neutrophil adhesion to vessel walls and cellular activation. Ref - medscape. com",

If you have symptoms suggesting this syndrome, you'll need tests to see if it's caused by a pituitary tumor or something else. One of the tests used measures the levels of coisol in your saliva late at night to see if they stay elevated. (They normally drop at night.) Another may include measuring levels of coisol and ACTH in blood samples taken at different times of the day. You also may be asked to collect all of your urine over a 24-hour period, which is then tested to measure your daily production of coisol and other steroid hormones. One test involves taking a dose of a powerful, coisone-like drug called dexamethasone, then checking blood or urine coisol levels. Often more than 1 of these tests is needed to help distinguish ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors from other diseases, such as adrenal gland tumors, that can cause similar symptoms.

Cutaneous lupus is divided into several subtypes, including acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus includes discoid lupus erythematosus, lupus erythematosus profundus, chilblain cutaneous lupus, and lupus tumidus. Diagnosis of these diseases requires proper classification of the subtype, through a combination of physical exam, laboratory studies, histology, antibody serology, and occasionally direct immunofluorescence, while ensuring to exclude systemic disease. Treatment of cutaneous lupus consists of patient education on proper sun protection along with appropriate topical and systemic agents. Systemic agents are indicated in cases of widespread, scarring, or treatment-refractory disease. Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE) occurs primarily in young to middle aged women. SCLE is highly photosensitive, with 70-90% of patients meeting the ACR definition of abnormal photosensitivity. There are two morphologic variants of SCLE: annular and papulosquamous An estimated 50% of SCLE patients meet criteria for SLE. Patients with SCLE usually have only mild systemic symptoms, most commonly ahritis and myalgias, while severe systemic symptoms, such as lupus vasculitis, CNS lupus, and nephritis occur in less than 10%. Immunologically, 70% of SCLE patients are anti-Ro (SS-A) positive, and overlap between Sjogren's syndrome and SCLE has been seen. Ref - Davidson 23rd edition pg 941",

        "exp": "Hemophilic ahropathy is a disabling condition characterized by joint impairment, chronic pain, and reduced quality of life. Recent evidence indicates that intra-aicular inflammation and angiogenesis may be pivotal processes in the pathogenic cascade of hemophilic ahropathy. Joint bleeding ors iron release from hemoglobin, thus inducing a chronic inflammatory process mediated by cytokines and pro-angiogenic factors and consequently leading to progressive synol pannus growth and aicular cailage damage. Spontaneous joint bleeding and repeated hemahroses lead to hemophilic ahropathy--a debilitating disease with a significant negative impact on mobility and quality of life. Iron, cytokines, and angiogenic growth factors play a pivotal role in the onset of the inflammatory process that involves the synol tissue, aicular cailage, and subchondral bone, with early damages and molecular changes determining the perpetuation of a chronic inflammatory condition. Synovitis is one of the earliest complications of hemahrosis, and is characterized by synol hyperophy, migration of inflammatory cells, and a high degree of neo-angiogenesis with subsequent bleeding.

Normally, dietary copper is absorbed from the stomach and proximal small intestine and is rapidly taken into the liver, where it is stored and incorporated into caeruloplasmin, which is secreted into the blood. The accumulation of excessive copper in the body is ultimately prevented by its excretion, the most impoant route being bile. In Wilson's disease, there is almost always a failure of synthesis of caeruloplasmin; however, some 5% of patients have a normal circulating caeruloplasmin concentration and this is not the primary pathogenic defect. The amount of copper in the body at bih is normal but thereafter it increases steadily; the organs most affected are the liver, basal ganglia of the brain, eyes, kidneys and skeleton.

Incidence The overall incidence of EDS is about 1 in 5000 bihs, with a higher rate for blacks. Classical and hypermobile types of EDS are the most common. Patients with milder forms frequently do not seek medical attention. Clinical features Skin Skin changes vary from thin and velvety to skin that is either dramatically hyperextensible (\"rubber person\" syndrome) or easily torn or scarred. Patients with classical EDS develop characteristic \"cigarette\u0002paper\" scars. In vascular-type EDS, extensive scars and hyperpigmen\u0002tation develop over bony prominences, and the skin may be so thin that subcutaneous blood vessels are visible. In the periodontotic type of EDS, the skin is more fragile than hyperextensible, and it heals with atrophic, pigmented scars. Easy bruisability occurs in several types of EDS. Ligament and Joint Changes Laxity and hypermobility of joints vary from mild to unreducible dislocations of hips and other large joints. In mild forms, patients learn to avoid dislocations by limiting physical activity. In more severe forms, surgical repair may be required. Some patients have progressive difficulty with age. Other Features Mitral valve prolapse and hernias occur, par\u0002ticularly with Type I. Pes planus and mild to moderate scoliosis are common. Extreme joint laxity and repeated dislocations may lead to degenerative ahritis.

Within a few months, the pain has usually become persistent and bilateral. Nocturnal exacerbation of pain often forces the patient to rise and move around. In some patients, bony tenderness (presumably reflecting enthesitis or osteitis) may accompany back pain or stiffness, whereas in others it may be the predominant complaint. Common sites include the costosternal junctions, spinous processes, iliac crests, greater trochanters, ischial tuberosities, tibial tubercles, and heels. Hip and shoulder (\"root\" joint) ahritis is considered pa of axial disease. Hip ahritis occurs in 25-35% of patients. Shoulder involvement may be at least as common, but is usually less symptomatic. Severe isolated hip ahritis or bonychest pain may be the presenting complaint, and symptomatic hipdisease can dominate the clinical picture. Ahritis of peripheral joints other than the hips and shoulders, usually asymmetric, may occur at any point in the disease course.

        "exp": "Rheumatoid ahritis (RA) is a common form of inflammatory ahritis, occurring throughout the world and in all ethnic groups. The prevalence of RA is approximately 0. 8-1. 0% in Europe and the Indian subcontinent, with a female-to-male ratio of 3: 1. The prevalence is lower in South-east Asia (0. 4%). The highest prevalence in the world is in Pima Indians (5%). It is a chronic disease characterised by a clinical course of exacerbations and remissions. RA is a complex disease with both genetic and environmental components. The impoance of genetic factors is demonstrated by higher concordance of RA in monozygotic (12-15%) compared with dizygotic twins (3%), and an increased frequency of disease in first-degree relatives of patients. Genome-wide association studies have detected nearly 100 loci that are associated with the risk of developing RA. The strongest association is with variants in the HLA region. Recent studies have shown that the association with HLA is determined by variations in three amino acids in the HLA-DRb1 molecule (positions 11, 71 and 74) and single variants HLA-B (at position 9) and HLA-DPb1 (at position. The HLA locus is located on the sho arm of chromosome 6 and covers a 7. 6 Mb region that contains over 250 highly polymorphic genes. The region is organized in three sub-regions: class I, class II and class III, which all have different functions. Both class I and II regions encode for glycoproteins that are expressed as cell surface receptors, whereas the class III region contains genes that encode for a variety of secreted immune system proteins, including complement factors and cytokines. The class I region encodes for three main subsets of HLA molecules; HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C. Class I HLA molecules are composed of an HLA-coded heavy a-chain and an invariant light chain, beta-2 microglobulin (b2m), which is essential for functional expression of the HLA molecule at the cell surface. The a-chain is folded to form a peptide-binding cleft that is \"closed\" and can accommodate sho antigenic peptides, typically 8-10 amino acids long. These class I molecules are expressed on all nucleated cells and specialize in presentation of intracellular antigens, including viral antigens, to cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells. Genes in the class II region encode for HLA-DR, HLA-DP and HLA-DQ molecules as well as a few other related proteins. Class II HLA molecules are composed of an a-chain and a b-chain, both coded by the HLA class II region. Unlike the class I molecules, the peptide-binding cleft of class II molecules are \"open\" which allows the accommodation of larger peptides of 15-20 amino acids long. Class II molecules are initially expressed on the cell surface of immune cells, in paicular antigen presenting cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells, as well as B cells and activated T cells. These molecules present antigens from outside the cell to (CD4+) T cells which in turn stimulate B cells to produce antibodies towards that specific antigen. This results in an antigen specific immune response. After activation of the immune system, the HLA class II molecules can be expressed on other cells. Ref - pubmed. com, Davidsons 23e p1044",

The known triggers are Chlamydia, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia. Notably, non-SpA-related reactive ahritis can occur following infection with many viruses, Mycoplasma, Borrelia, streptococci and mycobacteria, including M. leprae, which causes leprosy (Hansen's disease); however, the 'reaction' in these instances consists typically of myoahralgias, is not associated with HLA-B27 and is generally not chronic. The ahritis associated with rheumatic fever is also an example of a reactive ahritis that is not associated with HLA-B27. Sexually acquired reactive ahritis (SARA) is predominantly a disease of young men, with a malepreponderance of 15: 1. This may reflect a difficulty in diagnosing the condition in young women, in whom Chlamydia infection is often asymptomatic and is hard to detect in practical terms. Between 1% and 2% of patients with non-specific urethritis seen at genitourinary medicine clinics have SARA. The syndrome of chlamydial urethritis, conjunctivitis and reactive ahritis was formerly known as Reiter's disease. Clinical features The onset is typically acute, with an inflammatory enthesitis, oligoahritis and/or spinal inflammation. Lower limb joints and entheses are predominantly affected. In all types of ReA, there may be considerable systemic disturbance, with fever and weight loss. Achilles inseional enthesitis/tendonitis or plantar fasciitis may also be present. The first attack of ahritis is usually self-limiting, but recurrent or chronic ahritis can develop and about 10% still have active disease 20 years after the initial presentation. Low back pain and stiffness due to enthesitis and osteitis are common and 15-20% of patients develop sacroiliitis. Many extra-aicular features in ReA involve the skin, especially in SARA: * circinate balanitis, which stas as vesicles on the coronal margin of the prepuce and glans penis, later rupturing to form superficial erosions with minimal surrounding erythema, some coalescing to give a circular pattern * keratoderma blennorrhagica, which begins as discrete waxy, yellow-brown vesico-papules with desquamating margins, occasionally coalescing to form large crusty plaques on the palms and soles of the feet * pustular psoriasis * nail dystrophy with subungual hyperkeratosis * mouth ulcers * conjunctivitis * uveitis, which is rare with the first attack but arises in 30% of patients with recurring or chronic ahritis. Other complications in ReA are very rare but include aoic incompetence, conduction defects, pleuro-pericarditis, peripheral neuropathy, seizures and meningoencephalitis. Ref - Davidsons 23e p1031",

Total body copper is increased, with excess copper deposited in, and causing damage to, several organs. Normally, dietary copper is absorbed from the stomach and proximal small intestine and is rapidly taken into the liver, where it is stored and incorporated into caeruloplasmin, which is secreted into the blood. The accumulation of excessive copper in the body is ultimately prevented by its excretion, the most impoant route being bile. In Wilson's disease, there is almost always a failure of synthesis of caeruloplasmin; however, some 5% of patients have a normal circulating caeruloplasmin concentration and this is not the primary pathogenic defect. The amount of copper in the body at bih is normal but thereafter it increases steadily; the organs most affected are the liver, basal ganglia of the brain, eyes, kidneys and skeleton.

Jaw pain develops in some patients, brought on by chewing or talking. Visual disturbance can occur (most specifically amaurosis) and a catastrophic presentation is with blindness in one eye due to occlusion of the posterior ciliary aery.

The serum iron level and percent saturation of transferrin are elevated early in the course, but their specificity is reduced by significant false-positive and false-negative rates. For example, serum iron concentration may be increased in patients with alcoholic liver disease without iron overload; in this situation, however, the hepatic iron index is usually not increased as in hemochromatosis (Table 407-1). In otherwise healthy persons, a fasting serum transferrin saturation >45% is abnormal and suggests homozygosity for hemochromatosis. Transferrin saturation of more than 45% is suggestive of iron overload. Significant liver disease is unusual in patients with ferritin lower than 1000 mg/L (100 mg/dL). The differential diagnoses for elevated ferritin are inflammatory disease or excess ethanol consumption for modest elevations (< 1000 mg/L (100 mg/dL). Very significant ferritin elevation can be seen in adult Still's disease. In terms of imaging techniques, MRI has high specificity for iron overload but poor sensitivity. Liver biopsy allows assessment of fibrosis and distribution of iron (hepatocyte iron characteristic of haemochromatosis). The Hepatic Iron Index (HII) provides quantification of liver iron (mmol of iron per g dry weight of liver/age in years). An HII of more than 1. 9 suggests genetic haemochromatosis.

This hypersensitivity is strongly associated with the HLA-B5701 haplotype, and a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir is an absolute contraindication to future therapy.
