There are many potential causes of hypersensitivity vasculitis; however, up to 50% of cases are idiopathic. Hypersensitivity vasculitis may present clinically as cutaneous disease only or it may be a cutaneous manifestation of systemic disease. The internal organs most commonly affected in hypersensitivity vasculitis are the joints, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. Hypersensitivity vasculitis may be acute and self-limited, recurrent, or chronic. Overall, hypersensitivity vasculitis has a orable prognosis, paicularly when no internal involvement is present. Hypersensitivity vasculitis tends to affect the skin and occasionally the kidney. The loss of integrity of the capillaries and post capillary venules results in extravasation of red blood cells, usually causing purpura and a burning or minimally pruritic sensation. Hypersensitivity vasculitis is thought to be mediated by immune complex deposition. In this form of vasculitis, circulating antigens in the body (produced by factors such as medications, infections, and neoplasms) induce antibody formation. These antibodies bind to the circulating antigen and create immune complexes, which then deposit within vessels, activating complement and inducing inflammatory mediators. Inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, and local factors may affect the endothelial cells and play a role in the manifestations of this disease. Additionally, autoantibodies, such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), may be associated with disease manifestations. In ANCA-mediated vasculitis, intracellular proteins from neutrophils become expressed on the cell surface, leading to formation of antibodies (ANCA). These autoantibodies then bind neutrophils, subsequently leading to neutrophil adhesion to vessel walls and cellular activation. Ref - medscape. com",

Hypercalciuria may also be seen and may lead to nephrocalcinosis. Serum angiotensin-conveing enzyme (ACE may provide a non-specific marker of disease activity and can assist in monitoring the clinical course. Chest radiography has been used to stage sarcoid. In patients with pulmonary infiltrates, pulmonary function testing may show a restrictive defect accompanied by impaired gas exchange. Exercise testsmay reveal oxygen desaturation. Bronchoscopy may demonstrate a 'cobblestone' appearance of the mucosa, and bronchial and transbronchial biopsies usually show non-caseating granulomas, as may samples from the mediastinal nodes obtained by EBUS. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid typically contains an increased CD4: CD8 T-cell ratio. Characteristic HRCT appearances include reticulonodular opacities that follow a perilymphatic distribution centred on bronchovascular bundles and the subpleural areas. PET scanning can detect extrapulmonary disease. The occurrence of erythema nodosum with BHL on chest X-ray is often sufficient for a confident diagnosis, without recourse to a tissue biopsy. Similarly, a typical presentation with classical HRCT features may also be accepted. In other instances, however, the diagnosis should be confirmed by histological examination of the involved organ.

Kawasaki's disease is an acute, febrile, multisystem disease of children. Some 80% of cases occur prior to the age of 5, with the peak incidence occurring at <=2 years. It is characterized by nonsuppurative cervical adenitis and changes in the skin and mucous membranes such as edema; congested conjunctivae; erythema of the oral cavity, lips, and palms; and desquamation of the skin of the fingeips. Although the disease is generally benign and self-limited, it is associated with coronary aery aneurysms in ~25% of cases, with an overall case fatality rate of 0. 5-2. 8%. Presentation is with fever, generalised rash, including palms and soles, inflamed oral mucosa and conjunctival congestion resembling a viral exanthema. The cause is unknown but it is thought to be an abnormal immune response to an infectious trigger These complications usually occur between the third and fouh weeks of illness during the convalescent stage. Vasculitis of the coronary aeries is seen in almost all the fatal cases that have been autopsied. There is typical intimal proliferation and infiltration of the vessel wall with mononuclear cells. Beadlike aneurysms and thromboses may be seenalong the aery. Other manifestations include pericarditis, myocarditis, myocardial ischemia and infarction, and cardiomegaly. It occurs mainly in Japan and other Asian countries, such as China and Korea, but other ethnic groups may also be affected..

The lesions aresegmental and tend to involve bifurcations and branchings of aeries. They may spread circumferentially to involve adjacent veins. However, involvement of venules is not seen in polyaeritis nodosa and, if pres\u0002ent, suggests microscopic polyangiitis (see below). In the acute stagesof disease, polymorphonuclear neutrophils infiltrate all layers of thevessel wall and perivascular areas, which results in intimal prolifera\u0002tion and degeneration of the vessel wall. Mononuclear cells infiltratethe area as the lesions progress to the subacute and chronic stages. Fibrinoid necrosis of the vessels ensues with compromise of the lumen, thrombosis, infarction of the tissues supplied by the involved vessel, and, in some cases, hemorrhage. As the lesions heal, there is collagendeposition, which may lead to fuher occlusion of the vessel lumen.

Total body copper is increased, with excess copper deposited in, and causing damage to, several organs. Normally, dietary copper is absorbed from the stomach and proximal small intestine and is rapidly taken into the liver, where it is stored and incorporated into caeruloplasmin, which is secreted into the blood. The accumulation of excessive copper in the body is ultimately prevented by its excretion, the most impoant route being bile. In Wilson's disease, there is almost always a failure of synthesis of caeruloplasmin; however, some 5% of patients have a normal circulating caeruloplasmin concentration and this is not the primary pathogenic defect. The amount of copper in the body at bih is normal but thereafter it increases steadily; the organs most affected are the liver, basal ganglia of the brain, eyes, kidneys and skeleton.

Clinical features The cardinal symptom of GCA is headache, which is often localised to the temporal or occipital region and may be accompanied by scalp tenderness. Jaw pain develops in some patients, brought on by chewing or talking. Visual disturbance can occur (most specifically amaurosis) and a catastrophic presentation is with blindness in one eye due to occlusion of the posterior ciliary aery. On fundoscopy, the optic disc may appear pale and swollen with haemorrhages, but these changes may take 24-36 hours to develop and the fundi may initially appear normal. Rarely, neurological involvement may occur, with transient ischaemic attacks, brainstem infarcts and hemiparesis.

Cutaneous lupus is divided into several subtypes, including acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus includes discoid lupus erythematosus, lupus erythematosus profundus, chilblain cutaneous lupus, and lupus tumidus. Diagnosis of these diseases requires proper classification of the subtype, through a combination of physical exam, laboratory studies, histology, antibody serology, and occasionally direct immunofluorescence, while ensuring to exclude systemic disease. Treatment of cutaneous lupus consists of patient education on proper sun protection along with appropriate topical and systemic agents. Systemic agents are indicated in cases of widespread, scarring, or treatment-refractory disease. Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE) occurs primarily in young to middle aged women. SCLE is highly photosensitive, with 70-90% of patients meeting the ACR definition of abnormal photosensitivity. There are two morphologic variants of SCLE: annular and papulosquamous An estimated 50% of SCLE patients meet criteria for SLE. Patients with SCLE usually have only mild systemic symptoms, most commonly ahritis and myalgias, while severe systemic symptoms, such as lupus vasculitis, CNS lupus, and nephritis occur in less than 10%. Immunologically, 70% of SCLE patients are anti-Ro (SS-A) positive, and overlap between Sjogren's syndrome and SCLE has been seen. Ref - Davidson 23rd edition pg 941",

        "exp": "Hemophilic ahropathy is a disabling condition characterized by joint impairment, chronic pain, and reduced quality of life. Recent evidence indicates that intra-aicular inflammation and angiogenesis may be pivotal processes in the pathogenic cascade of hemophilic ahropathy. Joint bleeding ors iron release from hemoglobin, thus inducing a chronic inflammatory process mediated by cytokines and pro-angiogenic factors and consequently leading to progressive synol pannus growth and aicular cailage damage. Spontaneous joint bleeding and repeated hemahroses lead to hemophilic ahropathy--a debilitating disease with a significant negative impact on mobility and quality of life. Iron, cytokines, and angiogenic growth factors play a pivotal role in the onset of the inflammatory process that involves the synol tissue, aicular cailage, and subchondral bone, with early damages and molecular changes determining the perpetuation of a chronic inflammatory condition. Synovitis is one of the earliest complications of hemahrosis, and is characterized by synol hyperophy, migration of inflammatory cells, and a high degree of neo-angiogenesis with subsequent bleeding.

There is clear evidence of immunological dysfunction: T lymphocytes, especially those of the Th17 subtype, infiltrate the skin and there is abnormal fibroblast activation, leading to increased production of extracellular matrix in the dermis, primarily type I collagen. This results in symmetrical thickening, tightening and induration of the skin (scleroderma). Aerial and aeriolar narrowing occurs due to intimal proliferation and vessel wall inflammation.

        "question": "Systemic sclerosis shows all except",
        "exp": "Systemic scleroderma, or systemic sclerosis, is an autoimmune rheumatic disease characterised by excessive production and accumulation of collagen, called fibrosis, in the skin and internal organs and by injuries to small aeries. There are two major subgroups of systemic sclerosis based on the extent of skin involvement: limited and diffuse. The limited form affects areas below, but not above, the elbows and knees with or without involvement of the face. The diffuse form affects also the skin above the elbows and knees and can spread also to the torso. Visceral organs, including the kidneys, heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract can also be affected by the fibrotic process. Prognosis is determined by the form of the disease and the extent of visceral involvement. Patients with limited systemic sclerosis have a 10-year survival rate of 75%; less than 10% develop pulmonary aerial hypertension after 10 to 20 years. Patients with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis have a 10-year survival rate of 55%. Death is most often caused by lung, heart, and kidney involvement. There is also a slight increase in the risk of cancer Skin symptoms In the skin, systemic sclerosis causes hardening and scarring. The skin may appear tight, reddish, or scaly. Blood vessels may also be more visible. Where large areas are affected, fat and muscle wastage may weaken limbs and affect appearance. Patients repo severe and recurrent itching of large skin areas. The severity of these symptoms varies greatly among patients: Some having scleroderma of only a limited area of the skin (such as the fingers) and little involvement of the underlying tissue, while others have progressive skin involvement. Digital ulcers--open wounds on especially on fingeips and less commonly the knuckles--are not uncommon Diffuse scleroderma can cause musculoskeletal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal and other complications. Patients with greater cutaneous involvement are more likely to have involvement of the internal tissues and organs. Most patients (over 80%) have vascular symptoms and Raynaud's phenomenon, which leads to attacks of discoloration of the hands and feet in response to cold. Raynaud's normally affects the fingers and toes. Systemic scleroderma and Raynaud's can cause painful ulcers on the fingers or toes which are known as digital ulcers. Calcinosis (deposition of calcium in lumps under the skin) is also common in systemic scleroderma, and is often seen near the elbows, knees or other joints. Musculoskeletal The first joint symptoms that patients with scleroderma have are typically non specific joint pains, which can lead to ahritis, or cause discomfo in tendons or muscles. Joint mobility, especially of the small joints of the hand, may be restricted by calcinosis or skin thickening. Patients may develop muscle weakness, or myopathy, either from the disease or its treatments. Lungs Some impairment in lung function is almost universally seen in patients with diffuse scleroderma on pulmonary function testing; however, it does not necessarily cause symptoms, such as shoness of breath. Some patients can develop pulmonary hypertension, or elevation in the pressures of the pulmonary aeries. This can be progressive, and can lead to right-sided heart failure. The earliest manifestation of this may be a decreased diffusion capacity on pulmonary function testing.

A minority of patients present with glomerulonephritis. The most common presentation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis is with epistaxis, nasal crusting and sinusitis, but haemoptysis and mucosal ulceration may also occur. Deafness may be a feature due to inner ear involvement, and proptosis may occur because of inflammation of the retro-orbital tissue. This causes diplopia due to entrapment of the extra-ocular muscles, or loss of vision due to optic nerve compression. Disturbance of colour vision is an early feature of optic nerve compression. Untreated nasal disease ultimately leads to destruction of bone and cailage. Migratory pulmonary infiltrates and nodules occur in 50% of patients (as seen on high-resolution CT of lungs). Patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis are usually proteinase-3 (PR3) antibody-positive (ELISA). Pulmonary involvement may be manifested as asymptomatic infil\u0002trates or may be clinically expressed as cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and chest discomfo. It is present in 85-90% of patients. Endobronchialdisease, either in its active form or as a result of fibrous scarring, maylead to obstruction with atelectasis. Renal disease (77% of patients) generally dominates the clinical pic\u0002ture and, if left untreated, accounts directly or indirectly for most of themoality rate in this disease. Although it may smolder in some casesas a mild glomerulitis with proteinuria, hematuria, and red blood cellcasts, it is clear that once clinically detectable renal functional impair\u0002ment occurs, rapidly progressive renal failure usually ensues unlessappropriate treatment is instituted.

Kawasaki's disease is an acute, febrile, multisystem disease of children. Some 80% of cases occur prior to the age of 5, with the peak incidence occurring at <=2 years. It is characterized by nonsuppurative cervical adenitis and changes in the skin and mucous membranes such as edema; congested conjunctivae; erythema of the oral cavity, lips, and palms; and desquamation of the skin of the fingeips. Although the disease is generally benign and self-limited, it is associated with coronary aery aneurysms in ~25% of cases, with an overall case fatality rate of 0. 5-2. 8%. Presentation is with fever, generalised rash, including palms and soles, inflamed oral mucosa and conjunctival congestion resembling a viral exanthema. The cause is unknown but it is thought to be an abnormal immune response to an infectious trigger These complications usually occur between the third and fouh weeks of illness during the convalescent stage. Vasculitis of the coronary aeries is seen in almost all the fatal cases that have been autopsied. There is typical intimal proliferation and infiltration of the vessel wall with mononuclear cells. Beadlike aneurysms and thromboses may be seenalong the aery. Other manifestations include pericarditis, myocarditis, myocardial ischemia and infarction, and cardiomegaly. It occurs mainly in Japan and other Asian countries, such as China and Korea, but other ethnic groups may also be affected.

Total body copper is increased, with excess copper deposited in, and causing damage to, several organs. Normally, dietary copper is absorbed from the stomach and proximal small intestine and is rapidly taken into the liver, where it is stored and incorporated into caeruloplasmin, which is secreted into the blood. The accumulation of excessive copper in the body is ultimately prevented by its excretion, the most impoant route being bile. In Wilson's disease, there is almost always a failure of synthesis of caeruloplasmin; however, some 5% of patients have a normal circulating caeruloplasmin concentration and this is not the primary pathogenic defect. The amount of copper in the body at bih is normal but thereafter it increases steadily; the organs most affected are the liver, basal ganglia of the brain, eyes, kidneys and skeleton.

The most common presentation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis is with epistaxis, nasal crusting and sinusitis, but haemoptysis and mucosal ulceration may also occur. Deafness may be a feature due to inner ear involvement, and proptosis may occur because of inflammation of the retro-orbital tissue. This causes diplopia due to entrapment of the extra-ocular muscles, or loss of vision due to optic nerve compression. Disturbance of colour vision is an early feature of optic nerve compression. Untreated nasal disease ultimately leads to destruction of bone and cailage. Migratory pulmonary infiltrates and nodules occur in 50% of patients (as seen on high-resolution CT of lungs). Patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis are usually proteinase-3 (PR3) antibody-positive (ELISA). Pulmonary involvement may be manifested as asymptomatic infil\u0002trates or may be clinically expressed as cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and chest discomfo. It is present in 85-90% of patients.

In the periodontotic type of EDS, the skin is more fragile than hyperextensible, and it heals with atrophic, pigmented scars. Easy bruisability occurs in several types of EDS. Ligament and Joint Changes Laxity and hypermobility of joints vary from mild to unreducible dislocations of hips and other large joints. In mild forms, patients learn to avoid dislocations by limiting physical activity. In more severe forms, surgical repair may be required. Some patients have progressive difficulty with age. Other Features Mitral valve prolapse and hernias occur, par\u0002ticularly with Type I. Pes planus and mild to moderate scoliosis are common. Extreme joint laxity and repeated dislocations may lead to degenerative ahritis. In the ocular-scoliotic type of EDS, the eye may rupture with minimal trauma, and kyphoscoliosis can cause respira\u0002tory impairment. Also, sclerae may be blue.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are IgG antibodies directed against the cytoplasmic constituents of granulocytes and are useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of systemic vasculitis. Two common patterns are described by immunofluorescence: cytoplasmic fluorescence (c-ANCA), which is caused by antibodies to proteinase-3 (PR3); and perinuclear fluorescence (p-ANCA), which is caused by antibodies to myeloperoxidase (MPO) and other proteins such as lactoferrin and elastase. These antibodies are not specific for vasculitis and positive results may be found in autoimmune liver disease, malignancy, infection (bacterial and human immunodeficiency virus, HIV), inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid ahritis, SLE and pulmonary fibrosis. In granulomatosis with polyangiitis (also known as Wegener's granulomatosis (WG)), the vasculitis is characterised by granuloma formation, mainly affecting the nasal passages, airways and kidney. A minority of patients present with glomerulonephritis. The most common presentation of WG is with epistaxis, nasal crusting and sinusitis, but haemoptysis and mucosal ulceration may also occur. Deafness may be a feature due to inner ear involvement, and proptosis may occur because of inflammation of the retro-orbital tissue. This causes diplopia due to entrapment of the extra-ocular muscles, or loss of vision due to optic nerve compression. Disturbance of colour vision is an early feature of optic nerve compression. Untreated nasal disease ultimately leads to destruction of bone and cailage. Migratory pulmonary infiltrates and nodules occur in 50% of patients.

Rheumatoid factor is positive in 80% of adults with rheumatoid ahritis. A differential agglutination titer of16 and above is diagnostic of rheumatoid ahritis. Patients with systemic inflammatory diseases such as RA will often present with elevated nonspecific inflammatory markers such as an ESR or CRP. Detection of serum RF and anti-CCP antibodies is impoant in differentiating RA from other polyaicular diseases, although RF lacks diagnostic specificity and may be found in association with other chronic inflammatory diseases in which ahritis figures in the clinical manifestations. IgM, IgG, and IgA isotypes of RF occur in sera from patients with. RA, although the IgM isotype is the one most frequently measured by commercial laboratories. Serum IgM RF has been found in 75-80% ofpatients with RA; therefore, a negative result does not exclude the presence of this disease. It is also found in other connective tissue diseases, such as primary Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type II mixed essential cryoglobulinemia, as well as chronic infections such as subacute bacterial endocarditis and hepatitis B and C. Serum RF may also be detected in 1-5% of the healthy population. The presence of serum anti-CCP antibodies has about the same sensitivity as serum RF for the diagnosis of RA. However, its diagnostic specificity approaches 95%, so a positive test for anti-CCP antibodies inthe setting of an early inflammatory ahritis is useful for distinguishing RA from other forms of ahritis. There is some incremental value intesting for the presence of both RF and anti-CCP, as some patients with. RA are positive for RF but negative for anti-CCP and vice versa. The presence of RF or anti-CCP antibodies also has prognostic significance, with anti-CCP antibodies showing the most value for predicting worse outcomes. Ref - harrisons 20e p2535",

The disease is a panaeritis with inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltrates and occasionally giant cells. There are marked intimal proliferation and fibrosis, scarring and vascularization of the media, and disruption and degeneration of the elastic lamina. Narrowing of the lumen occurs with or without thrombosis. The vasa vasorum are frequently involved. Pathologic changes in various organs reflect the compromise of blood flow through the involved vessels. Immunopathogenic mechanisms, the precise nature of which is unceain, are suspected in this disease. As with several of the vasculitis syndromes, circulating immune complexes have been demonstrated, but their pathogenic significance is unclear. The generalized symptoms include malaise, fever, night sweats, ahralgias, anorexia, and weight loss, which may occur months before vessel involvement is apparent. These symptoms may merge into those related to vascular compromise and organ ischemia. Pulses are commonly absent in the involved vessels, paicularly the subclan aery.

The tendency for sarcoid to present in the spring and summer has led to speculation about the role of infective agents, including mycobacteria, propionibacteria and viruses, but the cause remains elusive. Genetic susceptibility is suppoed by familial clustering; a range of class II HLA alleles confer protection from, or susceptibility to, the condition. Sarcoidosis occurs less frequently in smokers. It may be associated with common variable immunodeficiency. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL) is often seen in young women. Alternatively, BHL may be detected in an otherwise asymptomatic individual undergoing a chest X-ray for other purposes.

Within a few months, the pain has usually become persistent and bilateral. Nocturnal exacerbation of pain often forces the patient to rise and move around. In some patients, bony tenderness (presumably reflecting enthesitis or osteitis) may accompany back pain or stiffness, whereas in others it may be the predominant complaint. Common sites include the costosternal junctions, spinous processes, iliac crests, greater trochanters, ischial tuberosities, tibial tubercles, and heels.

Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings are a common ophthalmologic finding in patients with Wilson disease. Initially thought to be due to the accumulation of silver, they were first demonstrated to contain copper in 1934. KF rings are seen in most of the patients with neurologic involvement from Wilson disease. These rings are caused by deposition of excess copper on the inner surface of the cornea in the Descemet membrane. A slit lamp examination is mandatory to make a diagnosis of KF rings paicularly in the early stages unless the rings are visible to the naked eye in conditions of severe copper overload. Kayser-Fleischer rings do not cause any impairment of vision but disappear with treatment and reappear with disease progression.

        "question": "Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR4 occurs in about 70% of patients with rheumatoid ahritis HLA DR4 encoded in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on",
        "exp": "Rheumatoid ahritis (RA) is a common form of inflammatory ahritis, occurring throughout the world and in all ethnic groups. The prevalence of RA is approximately 0. 8-1. 0% in Europe and the Indian subcontinent, with a female-to-male ratio of 3: 1. The prevalence is lower in South-east Asia (0. 4%). The highest prevalence in the world is in Pima Indians (5%). It is a chronic disease characterised by a clinical course of exacerbations and remissions. RA is a complex disease with both genetic and environmental components. The impoance of genetic factors is demonstrated by higher concordance of RA in monozygotic (12-15%) compared with dizygotic twins (3%), and an increased frequency of disease in first-degree relatives of patients. Genome-wide association studies have detected nearly 100 loci that are associated with the risk of developing RA. The strongest association is with variants in the HLA region. Recent studies have shown that the association with HLA is determined by variations in three amino acids in the HLA-DRb1 molecule (positions 11, 71 and 74) and single variants HLA-B (at position 9) and HLA-DPb1 (at position. The HLA locus is located on the sho arm of chromosome 6 and covers a 7. 6 Mb region that contains over 250 highly polymorphic genes. The region is organized in three sub-regions: class I, class II and class III, which all have different functions. Both class I and II regions encode for glycoproteins that are expressed as cell surface receptors, whereas the class III region contains genes that encode for a variety of secreted immune system proteins, including complement factors and cytokines. The class I region encodes for three main subsets of HLA molecules; HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C. Class I HLA molecules are composed of an HLA-coded heavy a-chain and an invariant light chain, beta-2 microglobulin (b2m), which is essential for functional expression of the HLA molecule at the cell surface. The a-chain is folded to form a peptide-binding cleft that is \"closed\" and can accommodate sho antigenic peptides, typically 8-10 amino acids long. These class I molecules are expressed on all nucleated cells and specialize in presentation of intracellular antigens, including viral antigens, to cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells. Genes in the class II region encode for HLA-DR, HLA-DP and HLA-DQ molecules as well as a few other related proteins. Class II HLA molecules are composed of an a-chain and a b-chain, both coded by the HLA class II region. Unlike the class I molecules, the peptide-binding cleft of class II molecules are \"open\" which allows the accommodation of larger peptides of 15-20 amino acids long. Class II molecules are initially expressed on the cell surface of immune cells, in paicular antigen presenting cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells, as well as B cells and activated T cells. These molecules present antigens from outside the cell to (CD4+) T cells which in turn stimulate B cells to produce antibodies towards that specific antigen. This results in an antigen specific immune response. After activation of the immune system, the HLA class II molecules can be expressed on other cells. Ref - pubmed. com, Davidsons 23e p1044",

Oral colchicine given in doses of 0. 5 mg twice or 3 times daily is the treatment of first choice in acute gout. It works by inhibiting microtubule assembly in neutrophils. The most common adverse effects are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Oral NSAIDs are also effective but are used less commonly since many patients affected by acute gout have coexisting cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or chronic kidney disease. Oral prednisolone (15-20 mg daily) or intramuscular methylprednisolone (80-120 mg daily) for 2-3 days are highly effective and are a good choice in elderly patients where there is an increased risk of toxicity with colchicine and NSAID. The IL-1b inhibitor canakinumab is effective but extremely expensive and so seldom given. Local ice packs can also be used for symptomatic relief. Patients with recurrent episodes can keep a supply of an NSAID, colchicine or prednisolone and take it as soon as the first symptoms occur, continuing until the attack resolves. Joint aspiration can give pain relief, paicularly if a large joint is affected, and may be combined with an intra-aicular glucocoicoid injection if the diagnosis is clear and infection can be excluded.

The known triggers are Chlamydia, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia. Notably, non-SpA-related reactive ahritis can occur following infection with many viruses, Mycoplasma, Borrelia, streptococci and mycobacteria, including M. leprae, which causes leprosy (Hansen's disease); however, the 'reaction' in these instances consists typically of myoahralgias, is not associated with HLA-B27 and is generally not chronic. The ahritis associated with rheumatic fever is also an example of a reactive ahritis that is not associated with HLA-B27. Sexually acquired reactive ahritis (SARA) is predominantly a disease of young men, with a malepreponderance of 15: 1. This may reflect a difficulty in diagnosing the condition in young women, in whom Chlamydia infection is often asymptomatic and is hard to detect in practical terms. Between 1% and 2% of patients with non-specific urethritis seen at genitourinary medicine clinics have SARA. The syndrome of chlamydial urethritis, conjunctivitis and reactive ahritis was formerly known as Reiter's disease. Clinical features The onset is typically acute, with an inflammatory enthesitis, oligoahritis and/or spinal inflammation. Lower limb joints and entheses are predominantly affected. In all types of ReA, there may be considerable systemic disturbance, with fever and weight loss. Achilles inseional enthesitis/tendonitis or plantar fasciitis may also be present. The first attack of ahritis is usually self-limiting, but recurrent or chronic ahritis can develop and about 10% still have active disease 20 years after the initial presentation. Low back pain and stiffness due to enthesitis and osteitis are common and 15-20% of patients develop sacroiliitis. Many extra-aicular features in ReA involve the skin, especially in SARA: * circinate balanitis, which stas as vesicles on the coronal margin of the prepuce and glans penis, later rupturing to form superficial erosions with minimal surrounding erythema, some coalescing to give a circular pattern * keratoderma blennorrhagica, which begins as discrete waxy, yellow-brown vesico-papules with desquamating margins, occasionally coalescing to form large crusty plaques on the palms and soles of the feet * pustular psoriasis * nail dystrophy with subungual hyperkeratosis * mouth ulcers * conjunctivitis * uveitis, which is rare with the first attack but arises in 30% of patients with recurring or chronic ahritis.

Amyloidosis can be classified as systemic and cutaneous amyloidosis. Systemic amyloidosis is classified into primary and secondary. Primary systemic amyloidosis is a rare disorder. Wilks in 1856, was the first to describe primary systemic amyloidosis. Primary systemic amyloidosis may be idiopathic or myeloma associated. Primary and myeloma-associated systemic amyloidosis typically involve the tongue, heart, gastrointestinal tract, skeletal and smooth muscle, carpal ligaments, nerves, and skin. Cutaneous involvement is seen in 40% patients with AL amyloidosis. Cutaneous manifestations depend on the site of amyloid deposited. Amyloid deposition in superficial dermis produces shiny waxy translucent papules, and common sites of predilection are eyelids, retroauricular areas, neck, and axillae. Amyloid deposits in the deep reticular dermis and subcutis produce nodules and tumefactions. Amyloid infiltration of blood vessel walls produces capillary wall fragility leading to purpura clinically. Periorbital area is the most common site of purpura and may be demonstrable by pinching the skin. Ref - Harrison's internal medicine 20e topic Amyloidosis",

Normally, dietary copper is absorbed from the stomach and proximal small intestine and is rapidly taken into the liver, where it is stored and incorporated into caeruloplasmin, which is secreted into the blood. The accumulation of excessive copper in the body is ultimately prevented by its excretion, the most impoant route being bile. In Wilson's disease, there is almost always a failure of synthesis of caeruloplasmin; however, some 5% of patients have a normal circulating caeruloplasmin concentration and this is not the primary pathogenic defect. The amount of copper in the body at bih is normal but thereafter it increases steadily; the organs most affected are the liver, basal ganglia of the brain, eyes, kidneys and skeleton.

Approximately 90% of patients are homozygous for a single point mutation resulting in a cysteine to tyrosine substitution at position 282 (C282Y) in the HFE protein, which has structural and functional similarity to the HLA proteins. The mechanisms by which HFE regulates iron absorption are unclear. It is believed, however, that HFE normally interacts with the transferrin receptor in the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. In HHC, it is thought that the lack of functional HFE causes a defect in uptake of transferrin-associated iron, leading to up-regulation of enterocyte iron-specific divalent metal transpoers and excessive iron absorption. A histidine-to-aspaic acid mutation at position 63 (H63D) in HFE causes a less severe form of haemochromatosis that is most commonly found in patients who are compound heterozygotes also carrying a C282Y mutated allele. Fewer than 50% of C282Y homozygotes will develop clinical features of haemochromatosis; therefore other factors must also be impoant.

The serum iron level and percent saturation of transferrin are elevated early in the course, but their specificity is reduced by significant false-positive and false-negative rates. For example, serum iron concentration may be increased in patients with alcoholic liver disease without iron overload; in this situation, however, the hepatic iron index is usually not increased as in hemochromatosis (Table 407-1). In otherwise healthy persons, a fasting serum transferrin saturation >45% is abnormal and suggests homozygosity for hemochromatosis. Transferrin saturation of more than 45% is suggestive of iron overload. Significant liver disease is unusual in patients with ferritin lower than 1000 mg/L (100 mg/dL). The differential diagnoses for elevated ferritin are inflammatory disease or excess ethanol consumption for modest elevations (< 1000 mg/L (100 mg/dL). Very significant ferritin elevation can be seen in adult Still's disease. In terms of imaging techniques, MRI has high specificity for iron overload but poor sensitivity. Liver biopsy allows assessment of fibrosis and distribution of iron (hepatocyte iron characteristic of haemochromatosis). The Hepatic Iron Index (HII) provides quantification of liver iron (mmol of iron per g dry weight of liver/age in years). An HII of more than 1. 9 suggests genetic haemochromatosis.

It is predominantly a disease of children and young adults. The usual presentation is with purpura over the buttocks and lower legs, accompanied by abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding and ahralgia. Nephritis can also occur and may present up to 4 weeks after the onset of other symptoms. Biopsy of affected tissue shows a vasculitis with IgA deposits in the vessel wall. Henoch-Schonlein purpura is usually a self-limiting disorder that settles spontaneously without specific treatment. Glucocoicoids and immunosuppressive therapy may be required in patients with more severe disease, paicularly in the presence of nephritis. Ref - davidsons 23e p1043",

        "exp": "Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis that mostly involves the coronary vessels. It presents as an acute systemic disorder, usually affecting children under 5 years. Kawasaki's disease is an acute, febrile, multisystem disease of children. Some 80% of cases occur prior to the age of 5, with the peak incidence occurring at <=2 years. It is characterized by nonsuppurative cervical adenitis and changes in the skin and mucous membranes such as edema; congested conjunctivae; erythema of the oral cavity, lips, and palms; and desquamation of the skin of the fingeips. Although the disease is generally benign and self-limited, it is associated with coronary aery aneurysms in ~25% of cases, with an overall case fatality rate of 0. 5-2. 8%. Presentation is with fever, generalised rash, including palms and soles, inflamed oral mucosa and conjunctival congestion resembling a viral exanthema. The cause is unknown but it is thought to be an abnormal immune response to an infectious trigger These complications usually occur between the third and fouh weeks of illness during the convalescent stage. Vasculitis of the coronary aeries is seen in almost all the fatal cases that have been autopsied. There is typical intimal proliferation and infiltration of the vessel wall with mononuclear cells. Beadlike aneurysms and thromboses may be seenalong the aery. Other manifestations include pericarditis, myocarditis, myocardial ischemia and infarction, and cardiomegaly. It occurs mainly in Japan and other Asian countries, such as China and Korea, but other ethnic groups may also be affected. Treatment is with aspirin (5 mg/kg daily for 14 days) and IV Ig (400 mg/kg daily for 4 days). Ref Davidsons 23e p1041, Harrisons 20e p2588",

        "exp": "Drug allergies are the most significant allergic reactions occurring in HIV-infected patients and appear to become more common as the disease progresses. Anaphylaxis is extremely rare in patients with HIV infection, and patients who have a cutaneous reaction during a single course of therapy can still be considered candidates for future treatment or prophylaxis with the same agent. The one exception to this is the nucleoside analog abacavir, where fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been repoed with rechallenge. This hypersensitivity is strongly associated with the HLA-B5701 haplotype, and a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir is an absolute contraindication to future therapy.

It has a worldwide distribution but is most common in Asia. Takayasu aeritis is characterised by granulomatous inflammation of the vessel wall, leading to occlusion or weakening of the vessel wall. It presents with claudication, fever, ahralgia and weight loss. Clinical examination may reveal loss of pulses, bruits, hypertension and aoic incompetence. Investigation will identify an acute phase response and normocytic, normochromic anemia but the diagnosis is based on angiography, which reveals coarctation, occlusion and aneurysmal dilatation. Treatment is with high-dose glucocoicoids and immunosuppressants, as described for ANCA-associated vasculitis. With successful treatment, the 5-year survival is 83%. Ref - Davidsons 23e p 1041",
