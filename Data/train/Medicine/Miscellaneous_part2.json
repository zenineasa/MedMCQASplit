The majority of patients enjoy spontaneous remission and so, if there is no evidence of organ damage, systemic glucocoicoid therapy can be withheld for 6 months. However, prednisolone (at a staing dose of 20-40 mg/day) should be commenced immediately in the presence of hypercalcaemia, pulmonary impairment, renal impairment and uveitis. Topical glucocoicoids may be useful in cases of mild uveitis, and inhaled glucocoicoids have been used to shoen the duration of systemic glucocoicoid use in asymptomatic parenchymal sarcoid. Patients should be warned that strong sunlight may precipitate hypercalcaemia and endanger renal function. Features suggesting a less ourable outlook include age over 40, Afro-Caribbean ethnicity, persistent symptoms for more than 6 months, the involvement of more than three organs, lupus pernio and a stage III/IV chest X-ray. In patients with severe disease, methotrexate (10-20 mg/week), azathioprine (50-150 mg/day) and specific tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) inhibitors have been effective. Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and low-dose thalidomide may be useful in cutaneous sarcoid with limited pulmonary involvement. Selected patients may be referred for consideration of single lung transplantation. The overall moality is low (1-5%) and usually reflects cardiac involvement or pulmonary fibrosis. ref - Davidsons 23e p608-610",

        "exp": "Sydenham chorea (SC) is a neurological disorder of childhood resulting from infection Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), the bacterium that causes rheumatic fever. SC is characterized by rapid, irregular, and aimless involuntary movements of the arms and legs, trunk, and facial muscles. Sydenham's chorea is characterized by the abrupt onset (sometimes within a few hours) of neurologic symptoms, classically chorea, usually affecting all four limbs. Other neurologic symptoms include behavior change, dysahria, gait disturbance, loss of fine and gross motor control with resultant deterioration of handwriting, headache, slowed cognition, facial grimacing, fidgetiness and hypotonia. Also, there may be tongue fasciculations (\"bag of worms\") and a \"milk sign\", which is a relapsing grip demonstrated by alternate increases and decreases in tension, as if hand milking. Non-neurologic manifestations of acute rheumatic fever are carditis, ahritis, erythema marginatum, and subcutaneous nodules. The PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) syndrome is similar, but is not characterized by Sydenham's motor dysfunction. PANDAS presents with tics and/or a psychological component (e. g., OCD) and occurs much earlier, days to weeks after GABHS infection rather than 6-9 months later. It may be confused with other conditions such as lupus and Tourette syndrome. Movements cease during sleep, and the disease usually resolves after several months. Unlike in Huntington's disease, which is generally of adult onset and associated with an unremitting autosomal dominant movement disorder and dementia, neuroimaging in Sydenham's chorea is normal and other family members are unaffected. Other disorders that may be accompanied by chorea include abetalipoproteinemia, ataxia-telangiectasia, biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease, Fahr disease, familial dyskinesia-facial myokymia (Bird-Raskind syndrome) due to an ADCY5 gene mutation, glutaric aciduria, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, mitochondrial disorders, Wilson disease, hypehyroidism, lupus erythematosus, pregnancy (chorea gravidarum), and side effects of ceain anticonvulsants or psychotropic agent Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 1025",

        "exp": "Antiphospholipid syndrome or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS or APLS), is an autoimmune, hypercoagulable state caused by antiphospholipid antibodies. APS provokes blood clots (thrombosis) in both aeries and veins as well as pregnancy-related complications such as miscarriage, stillbih, preterm delivery, and severe preeclampsia. The diagnostic criteria require one clinical event (i. e. thrombosis or pregnancy complication) and two antibody blood tests spaced at least three months apa that confirm the presence of either lupus anticoagulant or anti-b2-glycoprotein-I (since b2-glycoprotein-I antibodies are a subset of anti-cardiolipin antibodies, an anti-cardiolipin assay can be performed as a less specific proxy) Antiphospholipid syndrome can be primary or secondary. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome occurs in the absence of any other related disease. Secondary antiphospholipid syndrome occurs with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In rare cases, APS leads to rapid organ failure due to generalised thrombosis; this is termed \"catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome\" (CAPS or Asherson syndrome) and is associated with a high risk of death. Antiphospholipid syndrome often requires treatment with anticoagulant medication such as heparin to reduce the risk of fuher episodes of thrombosis and improve the prognosis of pregnancy. Warfarin/Coumadin is not used during pregnancy because it can cross the placenta, unlike heparin, and is teratogenic. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (a. PL) in the absence of blood clots or pregnancy-related complications does not indicate APS (see below for the diagnosis of APS). Antiphospholipid syndrome can cause aerial or venous blood clots, in any organ system, or pregnancy-related complications. In APS patients, the most common venous event is deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities, and the most common aerial event is stroke. In pregnant women affected by APS, there is an increased risk of recurrent miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, and preterm bih. A frequent cause of such complications is placental infarctions. In some cases, APS seems to be the leading cause of mental and/or development retardation in the newborn, due to an a. PL-induced inhibition of trophoblast differentiation. The antiphospholipid syndrome responsible for most of the miscarriages in later trimesters seen in concomitant systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy. Other common findings, although not pa of the APS classification criteria, are low platelet count, heart valve disease, and livedo reticularis. There are also associations between antiphospholipid antibodies and headaches, migraines, and oscillopsia. Some studies have shown the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in the blood and spinal fluid of patients with psychological symptoms. Very few patients with primary APS go on to develop SLE.

Acute distal lower limb weakness occurs occasionally from an acute toxic polyneuropathy or cauda equina syndrome. Distal symmetric weakness usually develops over weeks, months, or years and is due to metabolic, toxic, hereditary, degenerative, or inflammatory diseases of peripheral nerves. Drugs that inhibit the enzyme AChE allow ACh to interact repeatedly with the limited number of ACh. Rs, producing improvement in the strength of myasthenic muscles. Edrophonium is used most commonly for diagnostic testing because of the rapid onset (30 s) and short duration (about 5 min) of its effect. An objective endpoint must be selected to evaluate the effect of edrophonium. Examiner should focus on one or more unequivocally weak muscle groups and evaluate their strength objectively For example, weakness of extraocular muscles, impairment of speech, or the length of time that the patient can maintain the arms in forward abduction may be useful measures. An initial dose of 2 mg of edrophonium is given intravenously. If definite improvement occurs, the test is considered positive and is terminated. If there is no change, the patient is given an additional 8 mg intravenously. The dose is administered in two parts because some patients react to edrophonium with unpleasant sideeffects such as nausea, diarrhea, salivation, fasciculations, and rarely with severe symptoms of syncope or bradycardia. Atropine (0. 6 mg)should be drawn up in a syringe, ready for intravenous administration if these symptoms become troublesome.",

The swelling may occur in the face, tongue, larynx, abdomen, or arms and legs. Often it is associated with hives, which are swelling within the upper skin. Onset is typically over minutes to hours The underlying mechanism typically involves histamine or bradykinin. The version related to histamine is due to an allergic reaction to agents such as insect bites, foods, or medications. The version related to bradykinin may occur due to an inherited problem known as C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, medications known as angiotensin-conveing enzyme inhibitors, or a lymphoproliferative disorder. Effos to protect the airway may include intubation or cricothyroidotomy. Histamine-related angioedema can be treated with antihistamines, coicosteroids, and epinephrine. In those with bradykinin-related disease a C1 esterase inhibitor, ecallantide, or icatibant may be used. Fresh frozen plasma may be used instead.

There are different types of nicotine replacement products e. g. Nicotine patch - transdermally. Nasal spray - nasal mucosa. Nicotine chewing gum, lozenge or inhaler - oral mucosao Nicotine replacement products differ in their pharmacokinetics and delivery of nicotine to circulation# But no product delivers nicotine as rapidely as cigarette smoking, a factor that contributes specifically to dependence producing properties of cigarettes. Bupropiono It is believed to act by enhancing central nervous system noradrenergic and dopaminergic release, o It is given as sustained release formulation. o The sustained release bupropion takes five to seven days to reach steady state blood levels. Therefore it is started one week before a smoker s target quit date, o Bupropion monotherapy doubles the likelihood of smoking cessation compared to placebo. Varenicilineo Vareniciline is a partial agonist at the alpha-4 beta-2 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The receptor that appears to produce the reinforcing effects of nicotine and leads to nicotine dependence. It aids smoking cessation in two ways# Firstly, as a partial agonist it binds to and produces the partial stimulation of the alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic receptor thereby reducing the symptoms of nicotine withdrawl.# Secondly since vareniciline binds to the alpha 4 beta 2 receptor subunit with high affinity it blocks the nicotine in tobacco smoking from binding to the receptor.; there????",

The most common indication is ascites that has developed in people with cirrhosis Indications It is used for a number of reasons: to relieve abdominal pressure from ascites to diagnose spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and other infections (e. g. abdominal TB) to diagnose metastatic cancer to diagnose blood in peritoneal space in trauma For ascites The procedure is often performed in a doctor's office or an outpatient clinic. In an expe's hands it is usually very safe, although there is a small risk of infection, excessive bleeding or perforating a loop of bowel. These last two risks can be minimized greatly with the use of ultrasound guidance. The patient is requested to urinate before the procedure; alternately, a Foley catheter is used to empty the bladder. The patient is positioned in the bed with the head elevated at 45-60 degrees to allow fluid to accumulate in lower abdomen. After cleaning the side of the abdomen with an antiseptic solution, the physician numbs a small area of skin and inses a large-bore needle with a plastic sheath 2 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) in length to reach the peritoneal (ascitic) fluid. The needle is removed, leaving the plastic sheath to allow drainage of the fluid. The fluid is drained by gravity, a syringe or by connection to a vacuum bottle. Several litres of fluid may be drained during the procedure; however, if more than two litres are to be drained it will usually be done over the course of several treatments. After the desired level of drainage is complete, the plastic sheath is removed and the puncture site bandaged. The plastic sheath can be left in place with a flow control valve and protective dressing if fuher treatments are expected to be necessary. If fluid drainage in cirrhotic ascites is more than 5 litres, patients may receive intravenous serum albumin (25% albumin, 8g/L) to prevent hypotension (low blood pressure). There has been debate as to whether albumin administration confers benefit, but recent reviews repo that it can reduce moality after large volume paracentesis significantly. The procedure generally is not painful and does not require sedation. The patient is usually discharged within several hours following post-procedure observation provided that blood pressure is otherwise normal and the patient experiences no dizziness.

In the United States, about 20% of HCC cases are thought to be related to chronic hepatitis B infection.> Chronic infection in the setting of cirrhosis increases the risk of HCC 1000-fold.> The mechanism by which the hepatitis B virus causes HCC is thought to be from a combination of chronic inflammation and integration of the viral genome into the host DNA.# Hepatitis C virus> HCV is a global pandemic affecting 170 million persons. HCV infection results in a higher rate of chronic infection compared to HBV infection (approximately 80% of infected subjects).> Co-infection with HBV further increases the risk; many patients are co-infected with both viruses. Alcohol use in the setting of chronic HCV doubles the risk of HCC compared with HCV infection alone.> Recent studies suggest that antiviral treatment of chronic HCV infections may reduce the risk of HCC significantly.# Hemochromatosis:> Patients with hemochromatosis, especially in the presence of cirrhosis, are at an increased risk of developing HCC. HCC accounts for about 30% of all iron-related deaths in hemochromatosis.# Aflatoxin:> This hepatic carcinogen is a by-product of fungal contamination of foodstuffs in sub-Saharan Africa and East and Southeast Asia. It causes DNA damage and mutations of the p53 gene. Humans are exposed to aflatoxin through the ingestion of moldy foods found in susceptible grains.# Lab Studies:> Expect total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time to show results consistent with cirrhosis.# Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is elevated in 75% of cases.> The level of elevation correlates inversely with prognosis> An elevation of greater than 400 ng/mL predicts for HCC with specificity greater than 95%.

Prazosin is an a1-blocker. It works to decrease blood pressure by dilating blood vessels and helps with an enlarged prostate by relaxing the outflow of the bladder. How it works in PTSD is not entirely clear. Prazosin is orally active and has a minimal effect on cardiac function due to its alpha-1 receptor selectivity. When prazosin is staed, however, heart rate and contractility go up in order to maintain the pre-treatment blood pressures because the body has reached homeostasis at its abnormally high blood pressure. The blood pressure lowering effect becomes apparent when prazosin is taken for longer periods of time. The heart rate and contractility go back down over time and blood pressure decreases. The antihypeensive characteristics of prazosin make it a second-line choice for the treatment of high blood pressure. Prazosin is also useful in treating urinary hesitancy associated with prostatic hyperplasia, blocking alpha-1 receptors, which control constriction of both the prostate and urethra. Although not a first line choice for either hypertension or prostatic hyperplasia, it is a choice for patients who present with both problems concomitantly. There is some evidence that this medication is effective in treating nightmares, based on mixed results in randomized controlled trials. Prazosin was, however, shown to be more effective when treating nightmares related to PTSD.

The most frequent disturbances of cardiac rhythm are ventricular premature beats, bigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, and, rarely, ventricular fibrillation. Atrioventricular block and nonparoxysmal atrial tachycardia with variable atrioventricular block are characteristic of digitalis intoxication; withdrawal of the drug and treatment with li-adrenocepior blocker or lidocaine are indicated. If hypokalemia is present, potassium should be administered cautiously by the oral route. Fab fragments of purified, intact digitalis antibodies are a potentially lifesaving approach to the treatment of severe intoxication.> The administration of quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, and propafenone to patients receiving digoxin raises the serum concentration of the latter, increasing the propensity to digitalis intoxication.> The dose of digitalis should be reduced by half in patients receiving these drugs.",

NMDA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, which composed of multiple subunits, and each has distinct cellular and regional patterns of expression. Amantadine is a NMDA receptor Antagonist that is used in early Parkinson's disease to help tremor. In recent years, amantadine has also been found useful in reducing dyskinesia that occur with dopamine medication. Amantadine is well-tolerated, but its side effects include dry mouth, constipation, bladder problems, ankle swelling and skin rash.# COMT inhibitors such as Entacapone and Tolcapone represent the newest class of Parkinson's medications.

COMT inhibitors are useful primarily to help with problem of wearing-off (effect of levodopa becomes short-lived).# Dopamine agonists: These are drugs that stimulate the parts of the human brain influenced by dopamine. In effect, the brain is tricked into thinking it is receiving the dopamine it needs. Dopamine agonists are not as potent as Carbidopa/Levodopa.

        "exp": "The function of brown adipose tissue is to transfer energy from food into heat; physiologically, both the heat produced and the resulting decrease in metabolic efficiency can be of significance. Both the acute activity of the tissue, i. e., the heat production, and the recruitment process in the tissue (that results in a higher thermogenic capacity) are under the control of norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves. In thermoregulatory thermogenesis, brown adipose tissue is essential for classical nonshivering thermogenesis (this phenomenon does not exist in the absence of functional brown adipose tissue), as well as for the cold acclimation-recruited norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis. Heat production from brown adipose tissue is activated whenever the organism is in need of extra heat, e. g., postnatally, during entry into a febrile state, and during arousal from hibernation, and the rate of thermogenesis is centrally controlled a pathway initiated in the hypothalamus. Feeding as such also results in activation of brown adipose tissue; a series of diets, apparently all characterized by being low in protein, result in a leptin-dependent recruitment of the tissue; this metaboloregulatory thermogenesis is also under hypothalamic control. When the tissue is active, high amounts of lipids and glucose are combusted in the tissue. The development of brown adipose tissue with its characteristic protein, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), was probably determinative for the evolutionary success of mammals, as its thermogenesis enhances neonatal survival and allows for active life even in cold surroundings.

        "exp": "During intense, intermittent exercise and throughout prolonged physical activity, muscle glycogen paicles are broken down, freeing glucose molecules that muscle cells then oxidize through anaerobic and aerobic processes to produce the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules required for muscle contraction. The rate at which muscle glycogen is degraded depends primarily upon the intensity of physical activity; the greater the exercise intensity, the greater the rate at which muscle glycogen is degraded. As a result, high-intensity activity, such as repeated sprinting, can quickly lower glycogen stores in active muscle cells, even though the total time of activity might be relatively brief (eg, 10 x 30-s sprints with sho recovery intervals). In comparison, an endurance athlete who trains for hours at a time will also experience a marked decline in muscle glycogen, although at a slower rate of degradation than the sprinter.

        "exp": "Black hairy tongue is a condition of the tongue in which the small bumps on the tongue elongate with black or brown discoloration, giving a black and hairy appearance. The appearance may be alarming, but it is a harmless condition. Predisposing factors include smoking, xerostomia (dry mouth), soft diet, poor oral hygiene and ceain medications. Management is by improving oral hygiene, especially scraping or brushing the tongue Hairy tongue largely occurs in the central pa of the dorsal tongue, just anterior (in front) of the circumvallate papillae, although sometimes the entire dorsal surface may be involved. Discoloration usually accompanies hairy tongue, and may be yellow, brown or black. Apa from the appearance, the condition is typically asymptomatic, but sometimes people may experience a gagging sensation or a bad taste. There may also be associated oral malodor (intra-oral halitosis). The term \"melanoglossia' is also used to refer to there being black discolorations on the tongue without \"hairs\", which are also harmless and unrelated to black hairy tongue Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 714",

Presence of both immunoglobulin and complements on red blood cells is usually associated with some degree of hemolysis, while presence of complements alone (C3 and /or C4) is often not associated with hemolysis AIHA responds to steroids (1 mg/kg per day prednisone or its equivalent in divided doses) in 75 to 96% of patients.

Prevalence of lymphopenia in SLE ranges from 20 to 81% and its degree may correlate with disease activity. Both T and B lymphocytes are reduced, while natural killer cells are typically increased. Reduced surface expression of complement regulatory proteins CD55 and CD59 has been found in leucopenic patients with SLE. Deficiency of these proteins may make these cells susceptible to complement-mediated lysis. There is increasing evidence that endogenous production of type 1 interferons (IFNs) is implicated in the pathogenesis of neutropenia and lymphopenia in SLE. Elevated serum levels of IFN-a in SLE correlate inversely with leucocyte numbers# Neutropenia It is a common feature of SLE, with a prevalence rate of 47%, it may be mediated by anti-neutrophil antibodies. Increased levels of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in SLE and may contribute to Neutropenia (through excessive neutrophil apoptosis mediated neutropenia).# Thrombocytopenia It has a reported prevalence ranging from 7 to 30% in large series of patients with SLE. Increased peripheral destruction of platelets and presence of anti-platelet antibodies, is the most likely pathogenic mechanism.

It can cause life-threatening complications, particularly if the breathing muscles are affected or if there is dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. The disease is usually triggered by an acute infection. Guillain-Barre syndrome is a form of peripheral neuropathy. Rarely in Sarcoidosis, multiple lesions occur that mimic multiple sclerosis, spinal cord abnormalities, and peripheral neuropathy. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1, also known as hereditary motor sensory neuropathy type 1, is an uncommon autosomal dominant disease that causes destruction of peripheral nerves with a varied clinical course, but often leads to muscle weakness.

Various factors can favour renal cast formation in myeloma patients. Dehydration, sometimes due to diuretics, reduces the glomerular filtaration rate (GFR) and causes an increase in the plasma concentration of light chains which then exceeds the capacity for reabsorption and catabolism of light chains in the proximal tubuli.> Hypercalcaemia may induce vasoconstriction followed by a decrease in GFR. Several drugs, in particular non- steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), reduce renal blood flow. Radiographic contrast agents may induce acute renal failure in myeloma patients, particularly if patients are dehydrated and ionic contrast media are used.> The osteoclasts respond to osteoclast activating factors (OAF) made by the myeloma cells. leading to hypercaicaemia. Renal failure occurs in nearly 25% of myeloma patients, and some renal pathology is noted in over half. Hypercalcemia is the most common cause of renal failure. Glomerular deposits of amyloid, hyperuricemia, recurrent infections, and occasional infiltration of the kidney by myeloma cells all may contribute to renal dysfunction. However, tubular damage associated with the excretion of light chains is almost always present. Normally, light chains are filtered, reabsorbed in the tubules, and catabolized. With the increase in the amount of light chains presented to the tubule, the tubular cells become overloaded with these proteins, and tubular damage results either directly from light chain toxic effects or indirectly from the release of intracellular lysosomal enzymes. The earliest manifestation of this tubular damage is the adult Fanconi syndrome (a type 2 proximal renal tubular acidosis), with loss of glucose and amino acids, as well as defects in the ability of the kidney to acidify and concentrate the urine. The proteinuria is not accompanied by hypertension, and the protein is nearly all light chains. Generally, very little albumin is in the urine because glomerular function is usually normal.",

The paradox is that if the thesis linking saturated fats to CHD is valid, the French ought to have a higher rate of CHD than comparable countries where the per capita consumption of such fats is lower. The French paradox implies two impoant possibilities. The first is that the hypothesis linking saturated fats to CHD is not completely valid (or, at the extreme, is entirely invalid). The second possibility is that the link between saturated fats and CHD is valid, but that some additional factor in the French diet or lifestyle mitigates this risk--presumably with the implication that if this factor can be identified, it can be incorporated into the diet and lifestyle of other countries, with the same lifesaving implications observed in France. Both possibilities have generated considerable media interest, as well as some scientific research. It has also been suggested that the French paradox is an illusion, created in pa by differences in the way that French authorities collect health statistics, as compared to other countries, and in pa by the long-term effects, in the coronary health of French citizens, of changes in dietary patterns which were adopted years earlier.
