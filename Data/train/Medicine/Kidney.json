        "exp": "Ans: C (Isotope renogram) Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th edn. Explanation: Imaging Studies in Chronic Kidney Disease. The most useful imaging study is a Renal ultrasound. Advantages of Renal Ultrasoundo Verify the presence of two kidneyso Determine if they are symmetrico Provide an estimate of kidney sizeo Rule out renal masseso Evidence of obstruction. Since it takes time for kidneys to shrink as a result of chronic disease, the finding of bilaterally small kidneys supports the diagnosis of CKD of long-standing duration, with an irreversible component of scarring. If the kidney size is normal, it is possible that the renal disease is acute or subacute. The exceptions are diabetic nephropathy {where kidney size is increased at the onset of diabetic nephropathy before CKD with loss of GFR supervenes). Amyloidosis and HIV nephropathy, where kidney size may be normal in the face of CKD. Polycystic kidney disease that has reached some degree of renal failure will almost always present with enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts. A discrepancy >1 cm in kidney length suggests either a unilateral developmental abnormality or disease process or renovascular disease with arterial insufficiency affecting one kidney more than the other. The diagnosis of renovascular disease can be undertaken with different techniques, including Doppler sonography, nuclear medicine studies, or CT or. MRI studies. If there is a suspicion of reflux nephropathy (recurrent childhood urinary tract infection, asymmetric renal size with scars on the renal poles), a voiding cystogram may be indicated. However, in most cases by the time the patient has CKD, the reflux has resolved, and even if still present, repair does not improve renal function. Radiographic contrast imaging studies are NOT particularly helpful in the investigation of CKD. Intravenous or intraarterial dye should be avoided where possible in the CKD patient, especially with diabetic nephropathy, because of the risk of radiographic contrast dye- induced renal failure. When unavoidable, appropriate precautionary measures include avoidance of hypovolemia at the time of contrast exposure, minimization of the dye load, and choice of radiographic contrast preparations with the least nephrotoxic potential. Additional measures thought to attenuate contrast-induced worsening of renal function include judicious administration of sodium bicarbonate-containing solutions and W-acetyl-cysteine. A retrograde pyelogram may be indicated if a high index of clinical suspicion for obstruction exists despite a negative finding on renal ultrasonography. Intravenous pyelography is not commonly performed, because of the potential for renal toxicity from the intravenous contrast; however, this procedure is often used to diagnose renal stones. A renal radionuclide scan can be used to screen for renal artery stenosis when performed with captopril administration; it also quantitates differential renal contribution to total glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, radionuclide scans are unreliable in patients with a GFR of less than 30 mL/min/1. 73 m2. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is becoming more useful for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis, although renal arteriography remains the criterion standard. However, MR! contrast is problematic in patients with existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) because they have a low, but potentially fatal, risk of developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.",

        "exp": "Bater syndrome is a mineralocoicoid excess state caused by a defect in chloride reabsorption in the kidneys. The defect in chloride reabsorption in the ascending tubule also affects the reabsorption of sodium; therefore, there is an augmented distal delivery of sodium with increased exchange of sodium for potassium and hydrogen ions in the distal tubule, producing a hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Hypokalemia is a stimulus of renin release from the juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus, which results in JG apparatus hyperplasia. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system increases the production of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Hypokalemia also increases the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and 12 in the kidneys. Both of these chemical mediators are potent vasodilators. Angiotensin II and aldosterone stimulate the synthesis of renal kallikrein, which is then conveed into bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. Because of this sequence of events, patients with Bater syndrome do not develop hypertension, even in the presence of the excess aldosterone and angiotensin II, because their hypeensive effects are offset by the vasodilatation induced by the prostaglandins and bradykinin. In addition, for unexplained reasons, these patients are resistant to the effects of infused angiotensin II. Ref - Harrison's principles of internal medicine 20e pg 294, 306, 2096, 2938",

RTA includes autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms with a broad spectrum of clinical expression.# RX: Early initiation of alkali replacement at doses equivalent to 1 - 3 mmol/kg/day of bicarbonate in divided doses will usually correct the acidosis, hypokalemia, and hypocitraturia, maintaining growth and preventing bone disease in early-onset d. RTA. Type 2 (Proximal) RTA# Proximal RTA (p. RTA) is the result of impaired bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubular where the bulk of filtered bicarbonate is recovered.# It is most often secondary to various autoimmune, drug-induced, infiltrative, or other tubulopathies or a result of tubular injury from inherited diseases like Wilson's disease, cystinosis, tyrosinemia, galactosemia, hereditary fructose intolerance, glycogen storage disease type I, and Lowe's syndrome.# In this situation p. RTA is but one of several abnormalities that constitute Fanconi syndrome.# Other features are hyperphosphaturia, hyperuricosuria, hypercalciuria, nonselective amino aciduria and glycosuria. In addition to hyperchloremic acidosis, rickets or osteomalacia are the predominant effects of Fanconi syndrome.# RX: of p.

Urinary casts and their characteristic features. Hvaline casts* These are the most common type of casts and they can be found in normal urine samples.* They consists almost entirely of Tamm Horsfall protein.* Zero-to Two hyaline casts per low power field is considered normal.* Increased numbers of Hyaline casts can occur with exercise, heat exposure, dehydration, fever, congestive heart failure and diuretic. Renal tubular epithelial cell casts* These casts results when the epithelial cells of the renal tubules are being excreted along with the casts.* These are rarer casts, can in theory indicate a serious situation involving the possible breaking down of the lining of the renal tubules themselves.* Renal tubular epithelial casts are most suggestive of tubular injury as in acute tubular necrosis.* They are also found in other disorders including eclampsia, heavy metal poisoning, ethyleneglycol intoxication (most of these cases lead to acute tubular necrosis). Granular casts* These casts are fairly common and occur in both pathological and non pathological condition.* Granular casts can result either from the breakdown of cellular casts to a point where the cells that once were within them are no longer distinguishable or they can result from the inclusion of aggregates of plasma proteins, fibrinogen or immune complexes within the cast upon formation.* They can be further divided into coarse granular casts and fine granular casts.* Fine granular casts can appear in non pathological conditions such as vigorous exercise, but the presence of coarse granular cast is abnormal and presents in wide variety of clinical diseases.* They are common in renal parenchymal disease. Broad casts* These casts originate from dilated chronically damaged tubules or the collecting ducts therefore thev are called renal failure casts.* These are formed in collecting duct as a result of urinary stasis.* Broad casts are two to six times the size of other types of casts.* Broad casts or renal failure casts are usually seen in patients with advanced renal failure. Waxv casts* Waxy casts are cylinders of smooth highly refractive material.* Waxy aists are seen in final stages of degeneration of fine granular casts. Since the granules need time to degrade, this implies nephron obstruction.* Waxy casts are seen in chronic renal diseases associated with renal failure seen in diabetic nephropathy, malignant hypertension, glomerulonephritis.",

It is caused by reversible dysfunction of podocytes. On light microscopy, the glomeruli appear normal, but fusion of podocyte foot processes is observed on electron microscopy. The presentation is with nephrotic syndrome, which typically is severe; it remits with high-dose glucocoicoid therapy (1 mg/kg prednisolone for 6 weeks), though the response to therapy is often less satisfactory in older patients. Some patients who respond incompletely (glucocoicoid-resistant) or relapse frequently need maintenance glucocoicoids (glucocoicoid dependence), cytotoxic therapy or other agents. Glucocoicoid resistance in children warrants a biopsy to exclude an alternative diagnosis, but if minimal change is confirmed, a genetic cause should be considered. Minimal change disease typically does not progress to CKD but can present with problems related to the nephrotic syndrome and complications of treatment.

Most cases arise from a mutation or deletion of the COL4. A5 gene on the X chromosome, which encodes type IV collagen, resulting in inheritance as an X-linked recessive disorder. Mutations in COL4. A3 or COL4. A4 genes are less common and cause autosomal recessive disease. The accumulation of abnormal collagen results in a progressive degeneration of the GBM. Affected patients progress from haematuria to ESRD in their late teens or twenties. Female carriers of COL4. A5 mutations usually have haematuria but less commonly develop significant renal disease. Some other basement membranes containing the same collagen isoforms are similarly involved notably in the cochlea, so that Alpo's syndrome is associated with sensorineural deafness and ocular abnormalities. Angiotensin-conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may slow but not prevent loss of kidney function. Patients with Alpo's syndrome are good candidates for renal replacement therapy (R), as they are young and usually otherwise healthy.

In both cases, circulating immune complexes are present and activation of the complement system promotes consumption of complement factors, resulting in low serum C3 and C4 concentration, as observed in many causes of glomerulonephritis. Post-infectious glomerulonephritis is observed most commonly in children and young adults, and typically presents 10 days after a streptococcal throat infection or longer after a skin infection. The clinical presentation ranges from mild abnormalities on urinalysis to RPGN with severe AKI. The anti-streptolysin (ASO) test is positive in up to 95% of patients with streptococcal throat infections. Treatment is suppoive, with control of blood pressure and fluid overload with salt restriction, diuretics and dialysis if required. Antibiotic therapy is rarely needed, as the renal disease occurs after the infection has subsided. The medium-term prognosis for children and most adults is good, with recovery of renal function typical even in those requiring dialysis therapy. Some patients may develop CKD 20-30 years after the original presentation. However, An immune complex-mediated disease may also be observed during an infection, typically a staphylococcal infection such as endocarditis, skin infection or pneumonia, but also with subacute endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans. This occurs more commonly in older adults and the presentation tends not to be as fulminant as with post-streptococcal disease. In addition to suppoive measures, antibiotic therapy is required, as infection is usually concurrent with renal disease. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 267",

Most cases arise from a mutation or deletion of the COL4. A5 gene on the X chromosome, which encodes type IV collagen, resulting in inheritance as an X-linked recessive disorder (p. 48). Mutations in COL4. A3 or COL4. A4 genes are less common and cause autosomal recessive disease. The accumulation of abnormal collagen results in a progressive degeneration of the GBM (Fig. 15. 14). Affected patients progress from haematuria to ESRD in their late teens or twenties. Female carriers of COL4. A5 mutations usually have haematuria but less commonly develop significant renal disease. Some other basement membranes containing the same collagen isoforms are similarly involved, notably in the cochlea, so that Alpo's syndrome is associated with sensorineural deafness and ocular abnormalities. Angiotensin-conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may slow but not prevent loss of kidney function. Patients with Alpo's syndrome are good candidates for renal replacement therapy (R), as they are young and usually otherwise healthy. They can develop an immune response to the normal collagen antigens present in the GBM of the donor kidney and, in a small minority, anti-GBM disease develops and destroys the allograft.

It is commonly drug-induced, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) fast becoming the most common cause, but can be caused by other toxins, and can complicate` a variety of systemic diseases and infections. Clinical features The clinical presentation is typically with renal impairment but, in some patients with drug-induced AIN, there may be signs of a generalised drug hypersensitivity reaction with fever, rash and eosinophilia. Proteinuria is generally modest (PCR < 100 mg/mmol) and tubular in type ). The urine may contain white blood cells and white cell casts but is sterile on culture. Eosinophils are present in up to 70% of patients but this is a non-specific finding. AIN should` always be considered in patients with non-oliguric AKI. There` `may be a rapid deterioration of renal function in some cases of drug-induced AIN, causing the condition to be mistaken for RPGN. Investigations Renal biopsy is usually required to confirm the diagnosis. This typically shows evidence of intense inflammation, with infiltration of the tubules and interstitium by polymorphonuclear leucocytes and lymphocytes. Eosinophils may also be observed, especially in drug-induced AIN. Often granulomas may be evident, especially in drug-induced AIN or sarcoidosis. The degree of chronic inflammation in a biopsy is a useful predictor of long-term renal function. Eosinophiluria may be present but is not a good discriminator for AIN. Management Some patients with drug-induced AIN recover following withdrawal of the drug alone, but high-dose glucocoicoids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day) may accelerate recovery and prevent long-term scarring. Other specific causes should be treated, if possible. Chronic interstitial nephritis Chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN) is characterised by renal dysfunction with fibrosis and infiltration of the renal parenchyma by lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages, in association with tubular damage.

Diabetic nephropathy complicates about one third of cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a smaller propoion of type 2 cases. One of the problems is that diabetic nephropathy tends to be asymptomatic until end-stage disease develops, so there has been considerable interest in identifying early markers for significant renal disease. The spilling of albumin into the urine and, more specifically, the spilling of very small levels of albumin (\"microalbuminuria\") are the best markers to date for significant diabetic nephropathy. Hypertension often coexists with, and apparently ors the development of, microalbuminuria, but is not a specific marker for renal damage. Rising blood urea nitrogen and rising creatinine occur a little later, when there is already a very significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate. Urinary tract infection can permanently damage the kidneys but does not always do so. Ref - Harrison's principles of internal medicine 20e pg 2877",

The diseases that cause nephrotic syndrome all affect the glomerulus (see Fig. 15. 9), either directly, by damaging podocytes, or indirectly, by causing scarring or deposition of exogenous material such as amyloid into the glomerulus. Investigation of nephrotic syndrome usually involves renal biopsy, although non-invasive tests may also be helpful in suggesting the underlying cause. In children, minimal change disease is by far the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome and therefore renal biopsy is not usually required unless the patient fails to respond to high-dose glucocoicoid therapy. Similarly, most patients with diabetes presenting with nephrotic syndrome will have diabetic nephropathy, and so renal biopsy is usually not performed unless the course of the disease is atypical (rapidly increasing proteinuria or rapid decline in renal function;). Management of nephrotic syndrome should be directed at the underlying cause. In addition, nephrotic syndrome is associated with a number of complications, which may require suppoive management unless the nephrosis is expected to resolve rapidly, such as in glucocoicoid-responsive minimal change disease.

The scarring of FSGS only takes place in small sections of each glomerulus (filter), and only a limited number of glomeruli are damaged at first Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis Primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) can occur in all age groups but is paicularly common in people of West African descent, who, compared with other ethnicities, have a much higher carriage rate of an apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene variant that is associated with increased risk of FSGS. Histological analysis shows sclerosis initially limited to segments of the glomeruli, which may also show positive staining for deposits of C3 and IgM on immunofluorescence. Since FSGS is a focal process, abnormal glomeruli may not be seen on renal biopsy if only a few are sampled, leading to an initial diagnosis of minimal change nephropathy. In most cases the underlying cause is unknown (primary FSGS) and these patients typically present with abrupt onset of severe nephrotic syndrome. Primary FSGS may respond to high-dose glucocoicoid therapy (0. 5-2. 0 mg/ kg/day) but the response is rarely as rapid or complete as for minimal change disease. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil, have also been used but their efficacy is unceain. Progression to CKD is common in patients who do not respond to glucocoicoids and the disease frequently recurs after renal transplantation. FSGS may also be secondary to other diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) renal disease (paicularly in African Americans), morbid obesity or chronic hypertension. In addition, it may reflect scarring from previous focal glomerular injury resulting from HUS, cholesterol embolism or vasculitis. Patients with secondary FSGS typically present with more modest proteinuria than those with primary disease and rarely exhibit full-blown nephrotic syndrome. Management of secondary FSGS is focused on treating the underlying cause and reducing proteinuria by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 277",

In both cases, circulating immune complexes are present and activation of the complement system promotes consumption of complement factors, resulting in low serum C3 and C4 concentration, as observed in many causes of glomerulonephritis. Post-infectious glomerulonephritis is observed most commonly in children and young adults, and typically presents 10 days after a streptococcal throat infection or longer after a skin infection. The clinical presentation ranges from mild abnormalities on urinalysis to RPGN with severe AKI. The anti-streptolysin (ASO) test is positive in up to 95% of patients with streptococcal throat infections. Treatment is suppoive, with control of blood pressure and fluid overload with salt restriction, diuretics and dialysis if required. Antibiotic therapy is rarely needed, as the renal disease occurs after the infection has subsided. The medium-term prognosis for children and most adults is good, with recovery of renal function typical even in those requiring dialysis therapy. Some patients may develop CKD 20-30 years after the original presentation, however. An immune complex-mediated disease may also be observed during an infection, typically a staphylococcal infection such as endocarditis, skin infection or pneumonia, but also with subacute endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans. This occurs more commonly in older adults and the presentation tends not to be as fulminant as with post-streptococcal disease.

        "question": "Azotemia occurs when-",
        "exp": "Prerenal azotemia is caused by a decrease in blood flow (hypoperfusion) to the kidneys. However, there is no inherent kidney disease. It can occur following hemorrhage, shock, volume depletion, congestive heart failure, adrenal insufficiency, and narrowing of the renal aery among other things. The BUN: Cr in prerenal azotemia is greater than 20. The reason for this lies in the mechanism of filtration of BUN and creatinine. Renal Plasma Flow (RPF) is decreased due to hypoperfusion which results in a propoional decrease in GFR. In turn, the decreased flow and pressure to the kidney will be sensed by baroreceptors in the Juxtaglomerular (JG) Cells of the afferent aeriole. If the decrease in blood pressure is systemic (rather than occlusion of the renal aery) baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aoic arch will be stimulated. This leads to sympathetic nerve activation, resulting in renin secretion through b 1 -receptors. Constriction of the afferent aerioles causes a decrease in the intraglomerular pressure, reducing GFR propoionally. Renin is the main effector of the juxtaglomerular baroreceptors. Renin is secreted from granules in the JG cells, and once in the blood stream, it acts as a protease to conve angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is conveed by angiotensin conveing enzyme, to angiotensin II, which, in turn, stimulates aldosterone release. Increased aldosterone levels results in salt and water absorption in the distal collecting tubule. GFR = 20-50 of normal GFR A decrease in volume or pressure is a nonosmotic stimulus for antidiuretic hormone production in the hypothalamus, which exes its effect in the medullary collecting duct for water reabsorption. Through unknown mechanisms, activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to enhanced proximal tubular reabsorption of salt and water, as well as urea (BUN), calcium, uric acid, and bicarbonate. The net result of these 4 mechanisms of salt and water retention is decreased output and decreased urinary excretion of sodium (< 20 m. Eq/L). The increased reabsorption of Na leads to increased water and urea reabsorption from the proximal tubules of the kidney back into the blood. In contrast, creatinine is actually secreted in the proximal tubule. This generally leads to a BUN: Cr ratio > 20 and a fractional excretion of Na of < 1% and an elevated urine osmolarity Ref Harrison20th edition pg 277",

It is essentially a disease of childhood that accounts for approximately 90% of renal disorders in children Infection-related glomerulonephritis RPGN may occur either during or following an infection. In both cases, circulating immune complexes are present and activation of the complement system promotes consumption of complement factors, resulting in low serum C3 and C4 concentration, as observed in many causes of glomerulonephritis. Post-infectious glomerulonephritis is observed most commonly in children and young adults, and typically presents 10 days after a streptococcal throat infection or longer after a skin infection. The clinical presentation ranges from mild abnormalities on urinalysis to RPGN with severe AKI. The anti-streptolysin (ASO) test is positive in up to 95% of patients with streptococcal throat infections. Treatment is suppoive, with control of blood pressure and fluid overload with salt restriction, diuretics and dialysis if required. Antibiotic therapy is rarely needed, as the renal disease occurs after the infection has subsided. The medium-term prognosis for children and most adults is good, with recovery of renal function typical even in those requiring dialysis therapy. Some patients may develop CKD 20-30 years after the original presentation, however. An immune complex-mediated disease may also be observed during an infection, typically a staphylococcal infection such as endocarditis, skin infection or pneumonia, but also with subacute endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans. This occurs more commonly in older adults and the presentation tends not to be as fulminant as with post-streptococcal disease. In addition to suppoive measures, antibiotic therapy is required, as infection is usually concurrent with renal disease. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 401",

Most cases arise from a mutation or deletion of the COL4. A5 gene on the X chromosome, which encodes type IV collagen, resulting in inheritance as an X-linked recessive disorder (p. 48). Mutations in COL4. A3 or COL4. A4 genes are less common and cause autosomal recessive disease. The accumulation of abnormal collagen results in a progressive degeneration of the GBM (Fig. 15. 14). Affected patients progress from haematuria to ESRD in their late teens or twenties. Female carriers of COL4. A5 mutations usually have haematuria but less commonly develop significant renal disease.

        "exp": "Acute interstitial nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an immune-mediated disorder, characterised by acute inflammation affecting the tubulo- interstitium of the kidney. It is commonly drug-induced, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) fast becoming the most common cause, but can be caused by other toxins, and can complicate a variety of systemic diseases and infections. Causes Clinical features The clinical presentation is typically with renal impairment but, in some patients with drug-induced AIN, there may be signs of a generalised drug hypersensitivity reaction with fever, rash and eosinophilia. Proteinuria is generally modest (PCR < 100 mg/mmol) and tubular in type. The urine may contain white blood cells and white cell casts but is sterile on culture. Eosinophils are present in up to 70% of patients but this is a non-specific finding. AIN should always be considered in patients with non-oliguric AKI. There may be a rapid deterioration of renal function in some cases of drug-induced AIN, causing the condition to be mistaken for RPGN. Investigations Renal biopsy is usually required to confirm the diagnosis. This typically shows evidence of intense inflammation, with infiltration of the tubules and interstitium by polymorphonuclear leucocytes and lymphocytes. Eosinophils may also be observed, especially in drug-induced AIN. Often granulomas may be evident, especially in drug-induced AIN or sarcoidosis. The degree of chronic inflammation in a biopsy is a useful predictor of long-term renal function. Eosinophiluria may be present but is not a good discriminator for AIN. Management Some patients with drug-induced AIN recover following withdrawal of the drug alone, but high-dose glucocoicoids (prednisolone1 mg/kg/day) may accelerate recovery and prevent long-term scarring. Other specific causes should be treated, if possible. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 278",

Affected people are usually asymptomatic until later life but hypertension usually occurs from the age of 20 onwards. One or both kidneys may be palpable and the surface may feel nodular. About 30% of patients with PKD also have hepatic cysts (see Fig. 22. 39, p. 893) but disturbance of liver function is rare. Sometimes (almost always in women) this causes massive and symptomatic hepatomegaly, usually concurrent with renal enlargement but occasionally with only minor renal involvement. Berry aneurysms of cerebral vessels are an associated feature in about 5% of patients with PKD. This feature appears to be largely restricted to ceain families (and presumably specific mutations). Mitral and aoic regurgitation is frequent but rarely severe, and colonic diveicula and abdominal wall hernias may occur. Investigations The diagnosis is usually based on family history, clinical findings and ultrasound examination. Ultrasound demonstrates cysts in approximately 95% of affected patients over the age of 20 and is the screening method of choice, but may not detect small developing cysts in younger subjects. Cysts may also be identified by other imaging modalities, such as MRI (Fig. 15. 15). Simple renal cysts may occur in normal individuals but are uncommon below the age of 30. The following criteria exist for an ultrasound diagnosis of PKD in patients with a family history but unknown genotype: * 15-39 years of age: at least three unilateral or bilateral kidney cysts * 40-59 years of age: at least two cysts in each kidney * 60 years or older: at least four cysts in each kidney. It is now possible to make a molecular diagnosis by mutation screening of PDK1 or PDK2 but this is seldom used in routine clinical practice because the PKD1 gene is so large and has many possible mutations. Next-generation sequencing allows faster and simpler genetic screening for PKD1 and PKD2. This is likely to be used in cases with an unceain diagnosis (young patients, few cysts, lack of family history), for workup of living kidney donors, or for screening for mutations associated with a worse prognosis (see below). Screening for intracranial aneurysms is not generally indicated but can be done by MR angiography in families with a history of subarachnoid haemorrhage. The yield of screening is low, however, and the risk: benefit ratio of intervention in asymptomatic aneurysms in this disease is not clear. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 288",

It is named after Max Wilms, the German surgeon (1867-1918) who first described it Wilms' tumor has many causes, which can broadly be categorized as syndromic and non-syndromic. Syndromic causes of Wilms' tumor occur as a result of alterations to genes such as the Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) or Wilms Tumor 2 (WT2) genes, and the tumor presents with a group of other signs and symptoms. Non-syndromic Wilms' tumor is not associated with other symptoms or pathologies. Many, but not all, cases of Wilms' tumor develop from nephrogenic rests, which are fragments of tissue in or around the kidney that develop before bih and become cancerous after bih. In paicular, cases of bilateral Wilms' tumor, as well as cases of Wilms' tumor derived from ceain genetic syndromes such as Denys-Drash syndrome, are strongly associated with nephrogenic rests. Most nephroblastomas are on one side of the body only and are found on both sides in less than 5% of cases, although people with Denys-Drash syndrome mostly have bilateral or multiple tumors. They tend to be encapsulated and vascularized tumors that do not cross the midline of the abdomen. In cases of metastasis it is usually to the lung. A rupture of Wilms' tumor puts the patient at risk of bleeding and peritoneal dissemination of the tumor. In such cases, surgical intervention by a surgeon who is experienced in the removal of such a fragile tumor is imperative. Pathologically, a triphasic nephroblastoma comprises three elements: blastema mesenchyme (stroma) epithelium Wilms' tumor is a malignant tumor containing metanephric blastema, stromal and epithelial derivatives. Characteristic is the presence of aboive tubules and glomeruli surrounded by a spindled cell stroma. The stroma may include striated muscle, cailage, bone, fat tissue, and fibrous tissue. Dysfunction is caused when the tumor compresses the normal kidney parenchyma. The mesenchymal component may include cells showing rhabdomyoid differentiation or malignancy (rhabdomyosarcomatous Wilms). Wilms' tumors may be separated into 2 prognostic groups based on pathologic characteristics: Favorable - Contains well developed components mentioned above Anaplastic - Contains diffuse anaplasia (poorly developed cells) Mutations of the WT1 gene on chromosome 11p13 are observed in approximately 20% of Wilms' tumors. At least half of the Wilms' tumors with mutations in WT1 also carry mutations in CTNNB1, the gene encoding the proto-oncogene beta-catenin Typical signs and symptoms of Wilms' tumor include the following: a painless, palpable abdominal mass loss of appetite abdominal pain fever nausea and vomiting blood in the urine (in about 20% of cases) high blood pressure in some cases (especially if synchronous or metachronous bilateral kidney involvement) Rarely as varicocele Ref Harrison20th edition pg 277",

In the early morning spot urine, a ratio of albumin (mg/L) to creatinine (mg/L) of < 30 mg/mg creatinine is normal and a ratio of 30-300 mg/mg creatinine suggests abnormal microalbuminuria.* Increased microalbuminuria correlates with increased levels of blood pressure and increased LDL cholesterol, and this may explain why increased proteinuria in diabetic patients is associated with an increase in cardiovascular deaths even in the absence of renal failure (1186-CMDT-05)",

A renal scan is also known as a renal scintigraphy, renal imaging, or a renogram. During this procedure, a technician injects a radioactive material called a radioisotope into your vein. The radioisotope releases gamma rays. A gamma camera or scanner can detect gamma rays from outside your body. The gamma camera scans the kidney area. It tracks the radioisotope and measures how the kidneys process it. The camera also works with a computer to create images. These images detail the structure and functioning of the kidneys based on how they interact with the radioisotope. Images from a renal scan can show both structural and functional abnormalities. This helps doctors diagnose a kidney problem in its earlier stages without invasive techniques or surgery Ref Harrison20th edition pg 223",
