        "exp": "Secondary MCD wherein the extraglomerular disease process evokes, directly or indirectly, the characteristic changes in permselectivity and morphology. In this circumstance the morphology is similar, if not identical, to primary or 'idiopathic' MCD. Moreover, it is possible, even likely, that similar or identical pathogenetic mechanisms are operative. In this scenario, a distinct etiologic link is presumed to exist between the extraglomerular disease process and the occurrence of MCD. Such a linkage would be strongly suppoed if cure of the extraglomerular disease lead to the eradication of MCD and if recurrence of the extraglomerular disorder was associated with relapse. While an attempt has been made to be comprehensive, it is possible that individual repos describing an association between the specific extra-glomerular disease and MCD may have been overlooked. The majority of the instances in which MCD has been associated with an extraglomerular disease involve neoplastic processes and idiosyncratic, hyper-sensitivity or toxic reactions to drugs. Neoplasia A variety of neoplastic processes have been repoed in association with MCD (Table 2). In some, the association is rare enough to suspect that chance alone may have been the operational mechanism underlying the association. In others, the association is clearly contemporaneous and likely causal. Among patients with glomerular disease associated with neoplasia, 40% have MCD on renal biopsy. As mentioned previously it is possible that some of the described associations between neoplasia and MCD may be the consequence of treatment of MCD (especially cytotoxic drug therapy) predisposing to the emergence of a malignancy. Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are among the most frequently repoed neoplastic processes associated with MCD. Interestingly, repos describing the concurrence of MCD and Hodgkin's disease have decreased in recent years, perhaps due to the more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies available for this and related diseases. MCD is a rare complication of Hodgkin's ppdisease occurring in from 1: 2000 to 1: 10 000 cases. MCD has been associated with both limited (Stage 1) and disseminated (Stage 4) forms of Hodgkin's disease. Therapy of Hodgkin's disease, either by local radio- therapy to regional lymph nodes or by systemic chemotherapy, has often resulted in remission of MCD and recurrences of Hodgkin's disease have been associated with recurrence of MCD. These observations strongly imply a causal relationship between the tumour (or a product of the abnormal neoplastic cells) and the pathophysiological abnormalities involved in MCD. Indeed, it is quite possible that the same clone of cells which are involved in the development of Hodgkin's disease are also involved in the pathogenesis of MCD in both the primary and secondary forms. Such an explanation is more difficult to conjecture for the association of MCD with theother tumours listed in Table 2, except for mycosis fungoides, angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphatic leukaemia. Perhaps, in these instances, the peurbations for MCD have also triggered the oncogenic potential of cells predisposed to neoplastic transformation (e. g. lack of a wild type tumour suppressor gene). Alternatively, lymphocytes infiltrating neoplastic growths could be induced to elaborate factors responsible for abnormal permeability. Whatever the case may be, it is wohwhile to consider potential underlying neoplasia in patients with MCD when atypical features are present such as weight loss, anorexia, lymphadenopathy, haematuria, fever, pleural effusions or skin lesions. Overall, the occurrence of MCD as a complication of neoplastic disorders is quite uncommon. MCD may precede the diagnosis of neoplasia by months or years or may follow the diagnosis of neoplasia by months or years. Some repos have suggested that NK-cell deficiency is associated with the development of MCD in patients with Hodgkin's disease Ref Harrison20th edition pg 299",

Goodpasture syndrome may quickly result in permanent lung and kidney damage, often leading to death. It is treated with medications that suppress the immune system such as coicosteroids and cyclophosphamide, and with plasmapheresis, in which the antibodies are removed from the blood. The antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies primarily attack the kidneys and lungs, although, generalized symptoms like malaise, weight loss, fatigue, fever, and chills are also common, as are joint aches and pains. 60 to 80% of those with the condition experience both lung and kidney involvement; 20-40% have kidney involvement alone, and less than 10% have lung involvement alone. Lung symptoms usually antedate kidney symptoms and usually include: coughing up blood, chest pain (in less than 50% of cases overall), cough, and shoness of breath. Kidney symptoms usually include blood in the urine, protein in the urine, unexplained swelling of limbs or face, high amounts of urea in the blood, and high blood pressure GPS is caused by abnormal plasma cell production of anti-GBM antibodies The anti-GBM antibodies attack the alveoli and glomeruli basement membranes.

        "exp": "Ans: C (Isotope renogram) Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th edn. Explanation: Imaging Studies in Chronic Kidney Disease. The most useful imaging study is a Renal ultrasound. Advantages of Renal Ultrasoundo Verify the presence of two kidneyso Determine if they are symmetrico Provide an estimate of kidney sizeo Rule out renal masseso Evidence of obstruction. Since it takes time for kidneys to shrink as a result of chronic disease, the finding of bilaterally small kidneys supports the diagnosis of CKD of long-standing duration, with an irreversible component of scarring. If the kidney size is normal, it is possible that the renal disease is acute or subacute. The exceptions are diabetic nephropathy {where kidney size is increased at the onset of diabetic nephropathy before CKD with loss of GFR supervenes). Amyloidosis and HIV nephropathy, where kidney size may be normal in the face of CKD. Polycystic kidney disease that has reached some degree of renal failure will almost always present with enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts. A discrepancy >1 cm in kidney length suggests either a unilateral developmental abnormality or disease process or renovascular disease with arterial insufficiency affecting one kidney more than the other. The diagnosis of renovascular disease can be undertaken with different techniques, including Doppler sonography, nuclear medicine studies, or CT or. MRI studies. If there is a suspicion of reflux nephropathy (recurrent childhood urinary tract infection, asymmetric renal size with scars on the renal poles), a voiding cystogram may be indicated. However, in most cases by the time the patient has CKD, the reflux has resolved, and even if still present, repair does not improve renal function. Radiographic contrast imaging studies are NOT particularly helpful in the investigation of CKD. Intravenous or intraarterial dye should be avoided where possible in the CKD patient, especially with diabetic nephropathy, because of the risk of radiographic contrast dye- induced renal failure. When unavoidable, appropriate precautionary measures include avoidance of hypovolemia at the time of contrast exposure, minimization of the dye load, and choice of radiographic contrast preparations with the least nephrotoxic potential. Additional measures thought to attenuate contrast-induced worsening of renal function include judicious administration of sodium bicarbonate-containing solutions and W-acetyl-cysteine. A retrograde pyelogram may be indicated if a high index of clinical suspicion for obstruction exists despite a negative finding on renal ultrasonography. Intravenous pyelography is not commonly performed, because of the potential for renal toxicity from the intravenous contrast; however, this procedure is often used to diagnose renal stones. A renal radionuclide scan can be used to screen for renal artery stenosis when performed with captopril administration; it also quantitates differential renal contribution to total glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, radionuclide scans are unreliable in patients with a GFR of less than 30 mL/min/1. 73 m2. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is becoming more useful for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis, although renal arteriography remains the criterion standard. However, MR! contrast is problematic in patients with existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) because they have a low, but potentially fatal, risk of developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.",

        "exp": "Bater syndrome is a mineralocoicoid excess state caused by a defect in chloride reabsorption in the kidneys. The defect in chloride reabsorption in the ascending tubule also affects the reabsorption of sodium; therefore, there is an augmented distal delivery of sodium with increased exchange of sodium for potassium and hydrogen ions in the distal tubule, producing a hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Hypokalemia is a stimulus of renin release from the juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus, which results in JG apparatus hyperplasia. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system increases the production of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Hypokalemia also increases the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and 12 in the kidneys. Both of these chemical mediators are potent vasodilators. Angiotensin II and aldosterone stimulate the synthesis of renal kallikrein, which is then conveed into bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. Because of this sequence of events, patients with Bater syndrome do not develop hypertension, even in the presence of the excess aldosterone and angiotensin II, because their hypeensive effects are offset by the vasodilatation induced by the prostaglandins and bradykinin. In addition, for unexplained reasons, these patients are resistant to the effects of infused angiotensin II. Ref - Harrison's principles of internal medicine 20e pg 294, 306, 2096, 2938",

The typical presentation is with proteinuria and haematuria. It can be classified into two main subtypes. The first is characterised by deposition of immunoglobulins within the glomeruli. This subtype is associated with chronic infections, autoimmune diseases and monoclonal gammopathy. The second is characterised by deposition of complement in the glomeruli and is associated with inherited or acquired abnormalities in the complement pathway. This category comprises 'dense deposit disease', which is typified by electron-dense deposits within the GBM, and C3 glomerulonephritis that shows deposits similar to immunoglobulin-type MCGN. Treatment of MCGN associated with immunoglobulin deposits consists of the identification and treatment of the underlying disease, if possible, and the use of immunosuppressive drugs such as mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide. There are few specific treatments for MCGN associated with complement dysregulation, although eculizumab, the anti-C5 inhibitor that prevents formation of the membrane attack complex, has shown promise.

        "exp": "AIpo's syndrome A number of uncommon diseases may involve the glomerulus in childhood but the most impoant one affecting adults is Alpo's syndrome. Most cases arise from a mutation or deletion of the COL4. A5 gene on the X chromosome, which encodes type IV collagen, resulting in inheritance as an X-linked recessive disorder (p. 48). Mutations in COL4. A3 or COL4. A4 genes are less common and cause autosomal recessive disease. The accumulation of abnormal collagen results in a progressive degeneration of the GBM (Fig. 15. 14). Affected patients progress from haematuria to ESRD in their late teens or twenties. Female carriers of COL4. A5 mutations usually have haematuria but less commonly develop significant renal disease. Some other basement membranes containing the same collagen isoforms are similarly involved, notably in the cochlea, so that Alpo's syndrome is associated with sensorineural deafness and ocular abnormalities. Angiotensin-conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may slow but not prevent loss of kidney function. Patients with Alpo's syndrome are good candidates for renal replacement therapy (R), as they are young and usually otherwise healthy. They can develop an immune response to the normal collagen antigens present in the GBM of the donor kidney and, in a small minority, anti-GBM disease develops and destroys the allograft.

Granular casts* These casts are fairly common and occur in both pathological and non pathological condition.* Granular casts can result either from the breakdown of cellular casts to a point where the cells that once were within them are no longer distinguishable or they can result from the inclusion of aggregates of plasma proteins, fibrinogen or immune complexes within the cast upon formation.* They can be further divided into coarse granular casts and fine granular casts.* Fine granular casts can appear in non pathological conditions such as vigorous exercise, but the presence of coarse granular cast is abnormal and presents in wide variety of clinical diseases.* They are common in renal parenchymal disease. Broad casts* These casts originate from dilated chronically damaged tubules or the collecting ducts therefore thev are called renal failure casts.* These are formed in collecting duct as a result of urinary stasis.* Broad casts are two to six times the size of other types of casts.* Broad casts or renal failure casts are usually seen in patients with advanced renal failure. Waxv casts* Waxy casts are cylinders of smooth highly refractive material.* Waxy aists are seen in final stages of degeneration of fine granular casts. Since the granules need time to degrade, this implies nephron obstruction.* Waxy casts are seen in chronic renal diseases associated with renal failure seen in diabetic nephropathy, malignant hypertension, glomerulonephritis.",

It is caused by reversible dysfunction of podocytes. On light microscopy, the glomeruli appear normal, but fusion of podocyte foot processes is observed on electron microscopy. The presentation is with nephrotic syndrome, which typically is severe; it remits with high-dose glucocoicoid therapy (1 mg/kg prednisolone for 6 weeks), though the response to therapy is often less satisfactory in older patients. Some patients who respond incompletely (glucocoicoid-resistant) or relapse frequently need maintenance glucocoicoids (glucocoicoid dependence), cytotoxic therapy or other agents. Glucocoicoid resistance in children warrants a biopsy to exclude an alternative diagnosis, but if minimal change is confirmed, a genetic cause should be considered. Minimal change disease typically does not progress to CKD but can present with problems related to the nephrotic syndrome and complications of treatment.

Most cases arise from a mutation or deletion of the COL4. A5 gene on the X chromosome, which encodes type IV collagen, resulting in inheritance as an X-linked recessive disorder. Mutations in COL4. A3 or COL4. A4 genes are less common and cause autosomal recessive disease. The accumulation of abnormal collagen results in a progressive degeneration of the GBM. Affected patients progress from haematuria to ESRD in their late teens or twenties. Female carriers of COL4. A5 mutations usually have haematuria but less commonly develop significant renal disease. Some other basement membranes containing the same collagen isoforms are similarly involved notably in the cochlea, so that Alpo's syndrome is associated with sensorineural deafness and ocular abnormalities. Angiotensin-conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may slow but not prevent loss of kidney function. Patients with Alpo's syndrome are good candidates for renal replacement therapy (R), as they are young and usually otherwise healthy.

In both cases, circulating immune complexes are present and activation of the complement system promotes consumption of complement factors, resulting in low serum C3 and C4 concentration, as observed in many causes of glomerulonephritis. Post-infectious glomerulonephritis is observed most commonly in children and young adults, and typically presents 10 days after a streptococcal throat infection or longer after a skin infection. The clinical presentation ranges from mild abnormalities on urinalysis to RPGN with severe AKI. The anti-streptolysin (ASO) test is positive in up to 95% of patients with streptococcal throat infections. Treatment is suppoive, with control of blood pressure and fluid overload with salt restriction, diuretics and dialysis if required. Antibiotic therapy is rarely needed, as the renal disease occurs after the infection has subsided. The medium-term prognosis for children and most adults is good, with recovery of renal function typical even in those requiring dialysis therapy. Some patients may develop CKD 20-30 years after the original presentation. However, An immune complex-mediated disease may also be observed during an infection, typically a staphylococcal infection such as endocarditis, skin infection or pneumonia, but also with subacute endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans. This occurs more commonly in older adults and the presentation tends not to be as fulminant as with post-streptococcal disease. In addition to suppoive measures, antibiotic therapy is required, as infection is usually concurrent with renal disease. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 267",

Most cases arise from a mutation or deletion of the COL4. A5 gene on the X chromosome, which encodes type IV collagen, resulting in inheritance as an X-linked recessive disorder (p. 48). Mutations in COL4. A3 or COL4. A4 genes are less common and cause autosomal recessive disease. The accumulation of abnormal collagen results in a progressive degeneration of the GBM (Fig. 15. 14). Affected patients progress from haematuria to ESRD in their late teens or twenties. Female carriers of COL4. A5 mutations usually have haematuria but less commonly develop significant renal disease. Some other basement membranes containing the same collagen isoforms are similarly involved, notably in the cochlea, so that Alpo's syndrome is associated with sensorineural deafness and ocular abnormalities. Angiotensin-conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may slow but not prevent loss of kidney function. Patients with Alpo's syndrome are good candidates for renal replacement therapy (R), as they are young and usually otherwise healthy. They can develop an immune response to the normal collagen antigens present in the GBM of the donor kidney and, in a small minority, anti-GBM disease develops and destroys the allograft.

        "exp": "Acute interstitial nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an immune-mediated disorder, characterised by acute inflammation affecting the tubulo- interstitium of the kidney. It is commonly drug-induced, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) fast becoming the most common cause, but can be caused by other toxins, and can complicate` a variety of systemic diseases and infections. Clinical features The clinical presentation is typically with renal impairment but, in some patients with drug-induced AIN, there may be signs of a generalised drug hypersensitivity reaction with fever, rash and eosinophilia. Proteinuria is generally modest (PCR < 100 mg/mmol) and tubular in type ). The urine may contain white blood cells and white cell casts but is sterile on culture. Eosinophils are present in up to 70% of patients but this is a non-specific finding. AIN should` always be considered in patients with non-oliguric AKI. There` `may be a rapid deterioration of renal function in some cases of drug-induced AIN, causing the condition to be mistaken for RPGN. Investigations Renal biopsy is usually required to confirm the diagnosis. This typically shows evidence of intense inflammation, with infiltration of the tubules and interstitium by polymorphonuclear leucocytes and lymphocytes. Eosinophils may also be observed, especially in drug-induced AIN. Often granulomas may be evident, especially in drug-induced AIN or sarcoidosis. The degree of chronic inflammation in a biopsy is a useful predictor of long-term renal function. Eosinophiluria may be present but is not a good discriminator for AIN. Management Some patients with drug-induced AIN recover following withdrawal of the drug alone, but high-dose glucocoicoids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day) may accelerate recovery and prevent long-term scarring. Other specific causes should be treated, if possible. Chronic interstitial nephritis Chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN) is characterised by renal dysfunction with fibrosis and infiltration of the renal parenchyma by lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages, in association with tubular damage.

She presents with respiratory distress for 2 days accompanied by increased thick, yellow sputum production, low grade fever, and increasing confusion. On examination she is mildly obtunded but arousable, BP 160/100, pulse 115/min, RR 30/min, O2 saturation 84% on her usual 3 L/min nasal cannula oxygen. She is using accessory muscles to breath, has diffuse wheezing and rhonchi bilaterally, a prolonged expiratory phase, distant but regular heart sounds, and no peripheral edema. Arterial blood gases (ABGs) on arrival are as follows: pH: 7. 20, PO2: 70 mm Hg. PCO2: 65 mm Hgcalculated HCO3 29 m. Eq/L. Electrolytes return shortly thereafter as follows: Na: 140 m. Eq/LK: 5. 1 m.

        "exp": "Patients with severe COPD often have a baseline chronic respiratory acidosis with a PCO2 in the 50 to 60 mm Hg range. They are unable to ventilate sufficiently to correct the acidotic situation this creates. The kidney then compensates by retaining HCO3. This results in a new steady state in which the patient has a near-normal pH on their blood gas despite the chronically elevated CO2. In this question the further deterioration in the patient's respiratory status due to COPD exacerbation has caused further CO2 retention and a superimposed acute respiratory acidosis on top of the chronic respiratory acidosis. Salicylate overdose normally causes an anion gap acidosis and the AG is normal here. Volume depletion, especially due to recurrent vomiting, can lead to a contraction alkalosis, but this patient's acidosis indicates that the elevated bicarbonate level is caused by renal compensation for her chronic CO2 retention.",

        "exp": "AIpo's syndrome A number of uncommon diseases may involve the glomerulus in childhood but the most impoant one affecting adults is Alpo's syndrome. Most cases arise from a mutation or deletion of the COL4. A5 gene on the X chromosome, which encodes type IV collagen, resulting in inheritance as an X-linked recessive disorder (p. 48). Mutations in COL4. A3 or COL4. A4 genes are less common and cause autosomal recessive disease. The accumulation of abnormal collagen results in a progressive degeneration of the GBM (Fig. 15. 14). Affected patients progress from haematuria to ESRD in their late teens or twenties. Female carriers of COL4. A5 mutations usually have haematuria but less commonly develop significant renal disease. Some other basement membranes containing the same collagen isoforms are similarly involved, notably in the cochlea, so that Alpo's syndrome is associated with sensorineural deafness and ocular abnormalities. Angiotensin-conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may slow but not prevent loss of kidney function. Patients with Alpo's syndrome are good candidates for renal replacement therapy (R), as they are young and usually otherwise healthy. They can develop an immune response to the normal collagen antigens present in the GBM of the donor kidney and, in a small minority, anti-GBM disease develops and destroys the allograft. Alpo syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by kidneydisease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. People with Alpo syndrome experience progressive loss of kidney function. Almost all affected individuals have blood in their urine (hematuria), which indicates abnormal functioning of the kidneys Ocular manifestations Anterior lenticonus, which occurs in approximately 25% of patients with XLAS, is the pathognomonic feature of Alpo syndrome. In this condition, the lens surface protrudes conically into the anterior chamber of the eye because of a thin and fragile basement membrane of the lens capsule. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 277",

Diabetic nephropathy complicates about one third of cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a smaller propoion of type 2 cases. One of the problems is that diabetic nephropathy tends to be asymptomatic until end-stage disease develops, so there has been considerable interest in identifying early markers for significant renal disease. The spilling of albumin into the urine and, more specifically, the spilling of very small levels of albumin (\"microalbuminuria\") are the best markers to date for significant diabetic nephropathy. Hypertension often coexists with, and apparently ors the development of, microalbuminuria, but is not a specific marker for renal damage. Rising blood urea nitrogen and rising creatinine occur a little later, when there is already a very significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate.

Blood volume may be normal, reduced or increased. Renal sodium retention is an early and universal feature;. The diseases that cause nephrotic syndrome all affect the glomerulus, either directly, by damaging podocytes, or indirectly, by causing scarring or deposition of exogenous material such as amyloid into the glomerulus. Investigation of nephrotic syndrome usually involves renal biopsy, although non-invasive tests may also be helpful in suggesting the underlying cause. In children, minimal change disease is by far the most common cause of nephroticsyndrome and therefore renal biopsy is not usually required unless the patient fails to respond to high-dose glucocoicoid therapy. Similarly, most patients with diabetes presenting with nephrotic syndrome will have diabetic nephropathy, and so renal biopsy is usually not performed unless the course of the disease is atypical (rapidly increasing proteinuria or rapid decline in renal function; ). Management of nephrotic syndrome should be directed at the underlying cause. In addition, nephrotic syndrome is associated with a number of complications, which may require suppoive management unless the nephrosis is expected to resolve rapidly, such as in glucocoicoid-responsive minimal change disease fibrinogen increases on nephrotic syndrome.

        "exp": "Acute interstitial nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an immune-mediated disorder, characterised by acute inflammation affecting the tubulointerstitium of the kidney. It is commonly drug-induced, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) fast becoming the most common cause, but can be caused by other toxins, and can complicate a variety of systemic diseases and infections. Clinical features The clinical presentation is typically with renal impairment but, in some patients with drug-induced AIN, there may be signs of a generalised drug hypersensitivity reaction with fever, rash and eosinophilia. Proteinuria is generally modest (PCR < 100 mg/mmol) and tubular in type. The urine may contain white blood cells and white cell casts but is sterile on culture. Eosinophils are present in up to 70% of patients but this is a non-specific finding. AIN should always be considered in patients with non-oliguric AKI. There may be a rapid deterioration of renal function in some cases of drug-induced AIN, causing the condition to be mistaken for RPGN. Investigations Renal biopsy is usually required to confirm the diagnosis. This typically shows evidence of intense inflammation, with infiltration of the tubules and interstitium by polymorphonuclear leucocytes and lymphocytes. Eosinophils may also be observed, especially in drug-induced AIN. Often granulomas may be evident, especially in drug-induced AIN or sarcoidosis. The degree of chronic inflammation in a biopsy is a useful predictor of long-term renal function. Eosinophiluria may be present but is not a good discriminator for AIN. Management Some patients with drug-induced AIN recover following withdrawal of the drug alone, but high-dose glucocoicoids (prednisolone1 mg/kg/day) may accelerate recovery and prevent long-term scarring. Other specific causes should be treated, if possible. Chronic interstitial nephritis Chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN) is characterised by renal dysfunction with fibrosis and infiltration of the renal parenchyma by lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages, in association with tubular damage Pathophysiology This disease may follow on from AIN that does not resolve, or may be associated with ingestion of various toxins and drugs, or with metabolic and chronic inflammatory diseases. In many patients, CIN presents at a late stage and no underlying cause can be identified. Genetic causes may underlie many of these cases. Toxins that have been associated with CIN include those contained within the plant Aristolochia clematitis (bihwo). These are probably responsible for the severe nephrotoxicity that can be associated with treatment with herbal medicines in Asia and for Balkan nephropathy, which affects isolated rural communities in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Serbia, possibly through contaminated flour. The nephropathy is commonly linked with tumours of the collecting system and is probably due to the mutagenic effects of the plant toxin on the urothelial epithelium. Ingestion of mushrooms within the Coinarius genus can cause a devastating and irreversible renal tubular toxicity. It is encountered occasionally in Scandina and Scotland.

In the various glomerular diseases, the severity of disruption of the structural integrity of the glomerular capillary wall correlates with the area of the glomerular barrier being permeated by \"large\" pores, permitting the passage in the tubular lumen of high-molecular-weight (HMW) proteins, to which the barrier is normally impermeable. The increased load of such proteins in the tubular lumen leads to the saturation of the reabsorptive mechanism by the tubular cells, and, in the most severe or chronic conditions, to their toxic damage, that ors the increased urinary excretion of all proteins, including low-molecular-weight (LMW) proteins, which are completely reabsorbed in physiologic conditions. Recent clinical studies showed that in patients with glomerular diseases the urinary excretion of some HMW proteins and of some LMW proteins, a1-microglobulin, b2-microglobulin, correlates with the severity of the histologic lesions, and may predict, better than the quantity of proteinuria, the natural course, the outcome, and the response to treatment. It is suggested that some patients have already, at the time of clinical presentation, a structural damage of the glomerular capillary wall (injury of podocytes) and of the tubulointerstitium, the severity and scarce reversibility of which are reliably indicated by an elevated urinary excretion of HMW and LMW proteins.

The initial appearance may resemble hives, with small red spots or bumps on the lower legs, buttocks, knees, and elbows. But these change to appear more like bruises. The rash usually affects both sides of the body equally and does not turn pale on pressing. Kidney impairment. HSP can cause kidney problems, indicated by such signs as protein or blood in the urine. This is usually only discovered on urine testing, since it does not generally cause any discomfo. In most patients, the kidney impairment is mild and goes away without any long-term damage.

The scarring of FSGS only takes place in small sections of each glomerulus (filter), and only a limited number of glomeruli are damaged at first Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis Primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) can occur in all age groups but is paicularly common in people of West African descent, who, compared with other ethnicities, have a much higher carriage rate of an apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene variant that is associated with increased risk of FSGS. Histological analysis shows sclerosis initially limited to segments of the glomeruli, which may also show positive staining for deposits of C3 and IgM on immunofluorescence. Since FSGS is a focal process, abnormal glomeruli may not be seen on renal biopsy if only a few are sampled, leading to an initial diagnosis of minimal change nephropathy. In most cases the underlying cause is unknown (primary FSGS) and these patients typically present with abrupt onset of severe nephrotic syndrome. Primary FSGS may respond to high-dose glucocoicoid therapy (0. 5-2. 0 mg/ kg/day) but the response is rarely as rapid or complete as for minimal change disease. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as ciclosporin, cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil, have also been used but their efficacy is unceain. Progression to CKD is common in patients who do not respond to glucocoicoids and the disease frequently recurs after renal transplantation. FSGS may also be secondary to other diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) renal disease (paicularly in African Americans), morbid obesity or chronic hypertension. In addition, it may reflect scarring from previous focal glomerular injury resulting from HUS, cholesterol embolism or vasculitis. Patients with secondary FSGS typically present with more modest proteinuria than those with primary disease and rarely exhibit full-blown nephrotic syndrome. Management of secondary FSGS is focused on treating the underlying cause and reducing proteinuria by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 277",

In both cases, circulating immune complexes are present and activation of the complement system promotes consumption of complement factors, resulting in low serum C3 and C4 concentration, as observed in many causes of glomerulonephritis. Post-infectious glomerulonephritis is observed most commonly in children and young adults, and typically presents 10 days after a streptococcal throat infection or longer after a skin infection. The clinical presentation ranges from mild abnormalities on urinalysis to RPGN with severe AKI. The anti-streptolysin (ASO) test is positive in up to 95% of patients with streptococcal throat infections. Treatment is suppoive, with control of blood pressure and fluid overload with salt restriction, diuretics and dialysis if required. Antibiotic therapy is rarely needed, as the renal disease occurs after the infection has subsided. The medium-term prognosis for children and most adults is good, with recovery of renal function typical even in those requiring dialysis therapy. Some patients may develop CKD 20-30 years after the original presentation, however. An immune complex-mediated disease may also be observed during an infection, typically a staphylococcal infection such as endocarditis, skin infection or pneumonia, but also with subacute endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans. This occurs more commonly in older adults and the presentation tends not to be as fulminant as with post-streptococcal disease. In addition to suppoive measures, antibiotic therapy is required, as infection is usually concurrent with renal disease. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 233",

        "question": "Azotemia occurs when-",
        "exp": "Prerenal azotemia is caused by a decrease in blood flow (hypoperfusion) to the kidneys. However, there is no inherent kidney disease. It can occur following hemorrhage, shock, volume depletion, congestive heart failure, adrenal insufficiency, and narrowing of the renal aery among other things. The BUN: Cr in prerenal azotemia is greater than 20. The reason for this lies in the mechanism of filtration of BUN and creatinine. Renal Plasma Flow (RPF) is decreased due to hypoperfusion which results in a propoional decrease in GFR. In turn, the decreased flow and pressure to the kidney will be sensed by baroreceptors in the Juxtaglomerular (JG) Cells of the afferent aeriole. If the decrease in blood pressure is systemic (rather than occlusion of the renal aery) baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aoic arch will be stimulated. This leads to sympathetic nerve activation, resulting in renin secretion through b 1 -receptors. Constriction of the afferent aerioles causes a decrease in the intraglomerular pressure, reducing GFR propoionally. Renin is the main effector of the juxtaglomerular baroreceptors. Renin is secreted from granules in the JG cells, and once in the blood stream, it acts as a protease to conve angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is conveed by angiotensin conveing enzyme, to angiotensin II, which, in turn, stimulates aldosterone release. Increased aldosterone levels results in salt and water absorption in the distal collecting tubule. GFR = 20-50 of normal GFR A decrease in volume or pressure is a nonosmotic stimulus for antidiuretic hormone production in the hypothalamus, which exes its effect in the medullary collecting duct for water reabsorption. Through unknown mechanisms, activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to enhanced proximal tubular reabsorption of salt and water, as well as urea (BUN), calcium, uric acid, and bicarbonate. The net result of these 4 mechanisms of salt and water retention is decreased output and decreased urinary excretion of sodium (< 20 m. Eq/L). The increased reabsorption of Na leads to increased water and urea reabsorption from the proximal tubules of the kidney back into the blood. In contrast, creatinine is actually secreted in the proximal tubule. This generally leads to a BUN: Cr ratio > 20 and a fractional excretion of Na of < 1% and an elevated urine osmolarity Ref Harrison20th edition pg 277",

It is essentially a disease of childhood that accounts for approximately 90% of renal disorders in children Infection-related glomerulonephritis RPGN may occur either during or following an infection. In both cases, circulating immune complexes are present and activation of the complement system promotes consumption of complement factors, resulting in low serum C3 and C4 concentration, as observed in many causes of glomerulonephritis. Post-infectious glomerulonephritis is observed most commonly in children and young adults, and typically presents 10 days after a streptococcal throat infection or longer after a skin infection. The clinical presentation ranges from mild abnormalities on urinalysis to RPGN with severe AKI. The anti-streptolysin (ASO) test is positive in up to 95% of patients with streptococcal throat infections. Treatment is suppoive, with control of blood pressure and fluid overload with salt restriction, diuretics and dialysis if required. Antibiotic therapy is rarely needed, as the renal disease occurs after the infection has subsided. The medium-term prognosis for children and most adults is good, with recovery of renal function typical even in those requiring dialysis therapy. Some patients may develop CKD 20-30 years after the original presentation, however. An immune complex-mediated disease may also be observed during an infection, typically a staphylococcal infection such as endocarditis, skin infection or pneumonia, but also with subacute endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans. This occurs more commonly in older adults and the presentation tends not to be as fulminant as with post-streptococcal disease. In addition to suppoive measures, antibiotic therapy is required, as infection is usually concurrent with renal disease. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 401",

        "exp": "Urinary dipstick testing is a valuable screening tool for the detection of proteinuria; it is only semi-quantitative, however, as it is highly dependent on the concentration of the urine. Typically, standard dipsticks test positive for protein once the urinary protein exceeds approximately 0. 5 g/24 hrs, trace to 1+ on dipstick may be observed in very concentrated urine from individuals with no evidence of renal pathology. Hence all patients with persistent proteinuria on dipstick should have the amount of protein quantified to guide fuher investigations (Fig. 15. 10). When more than 1 g of protein per day is being excreted, glomerular disease is likely and this is an indication for renal biopsy. Since quantification by 24-hour urine collection is often inaccurate, the protein: creatinine ratio (PCR) in a spot sample of urine ispreferred. This makes an allowance for the variable degree of urinary dilution and can be used to extrapolate to 24-hour values. Changes in PCR also give valuable information about the progression of renal disease and response to therapy in CKD. It is possible to measure albumin: creatinine ratio (ACR), but this requires a more expensive immunoassay and is usually reserved for situations when high sensitivity is required, such as detection of the early stages of diabetic nephropathy. It is sometimes helpful to identify the type of protein in the urine. Large amounts of low-molecular-weight proteins, such as b2-microglobulin (molecular weight 12 k. Da), in the urine suggest renal tubular damage and are referred to as tubular proteinuria. This rarely exceeds 1. 5-2 g/24 hrs (maximum PCR 150-200 mg/ mmol; for conversion of mg/mmol to mg/dL).

It is commonly drug-induced, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) fast becoming the most common cause, but can be caused by other toxins, and can complicate a variety of systemic diseases and infections. Causes Clinical features The clinical presentation is typically with renal impairment but, in some patients with drug-induced AIN, there may be signs of a generalised drug hypersensitivity reaction with fever, rash and eosinophilia. Proteinuria is generally modest (PCR < 100 mg/mmol) and tubular in type. The urine may contain white blood cells and white cell casts but is sterile on culture. Eosinophils are present in up to 70% of patients but this is a non-specific finding. AIN should always be considered in patients with non-oliguric AKI. There may be a rapid deterioration of renal function in some cases of drug-induced AIN, causing the condition to be mistaken for RPGN. Investigations Renal biopsy is usually required to confirm the diagnosis. This typically shows evidence of intense inflammation, with infiltration of the tubules and interstitium by polymorphonuclear leucocytes and lymphocytes. Eosinophils may also be observed, especially in drug-induced AIN. Often granulomas may be evident, especially in drug-induced AIN or sarcoidosis. The degree of chronic inflammation in a biopsy is a useful predictor of long-term renal function. Eosinophiluria may be present but is not a good discriminator for AIN. Management Some patients with drug-induced AIN recover following withdrawal of the drug alone, but high-dose glucocoicoids (prednisolone1 mg/kg/day) may accelerate recovery and prevent long-term scarring. Other specific causes should be treated, if possible. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 278",

Affected people are usually asymptomatic until later life but hypertension usually occurs from the age of 20 onwards. One or both kidneys may be palpable and the surface may feel nodular. About 30% of patients with PKD also have hepatic cysts (see Fig. 22. 39, p. 893) but disturbance of liver function is rare. Sometimes (almost always in women) this causes massive and symptomatic hepatomegaly, usually concurrent with renal enlargement but occasionally with only minor renal involvement. Berry aneurysms of cerebral vessels are an associated feature in about 5% of patients with PKD. This feature appears to be largely restricted to ceain families (and presumably specific mutations). Mitral and aoic regurgitation is frequent but rarely severe, and colonic diveicula and abdominal wall hernias may occur. Investigations The diagnosis is usually based on family history, clinical findings and ultrasound examination. Ultrasound demonstrates cysts in approximately 95% of affected patients over the age of 20 and is the screening method of choice, but may not detect small developing cysts in younger subjects. Cysts may also be identified by other imaging modalities, such as MRI (Fig. 15. 15). Simple renal cysts may occur in normal individuals but are uncommon below the age of 30. The following criteria exist for an ultrasound diagnosis of PKD in patients with a family history but unknown genotype: * 15-39 years of age: at least three unilateral or bilateral kidney cysts * 40-59 years of age: at least two cysts in each kidney * 60 years or older: at least four cysts in each kidney. It is now possible to make a molecular diagnosis by mutation screening of PDK1 or PDK2 but this is seldom used in routine clinical practice because the PKD1 gene is so large and has many possible mutations. Next-generation sequencing allows faster and simpler genetic screening for PKD1 and PKD2. This is likely to be used in cases with an unceain diagnosis (young patients, few cysts, lack of family history), for workup of living kidney donors, or for screening for mutations associated with a worse prognosis (see below). Screening for intracranial aneurysms is not generally indicated but can be done by MR angiography in families with a history of subarachnoid haemorrhage. The yield of screening is low, however, and the risk: benefit ratio of intervention in asymptomatic aneurysms in this disease is not clear. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 288",

These changes are associated with various detrimental biochemical and morphological alterations. All of these pathological parameters are collectively termed uremic myopathy. Various interventions while helpful can't fully remedy the pathological phenotype. Complex mechanisms that stimulate muscle dysfunction in uremia have been proposed, and oxidative stress could be implicated. Skeletal muscles continuously produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) at rest and more so during contraction. The aim of this mini review is to provide an update on recent advances in our understanding of how ROS and RNS generation might contribute to muscle dysfunction in uremia. Thus, a systematic review was conducted searching Pub. Med and Scopus by using the Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. While few studies met our criteria their findings are discussed making reference to other available literature data. Oxidative stress can direct muscle cells into a catabolic state and chronic exposure to it leads to wasting. Moreover, redox disturbances can significantly affect force production per se. We conclude that oxidative stress can be in pa responsible for some aspects of uremic myopathy. Fuher research is needed to discern clear mechanisms and to help effos to counteract muscle weakness and exercise intolerance in uremic patients. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 234",

        "exp": "Wilms' tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is a cancer of the kidneys that typically occurs in children, rarely in adults. It is named after Max Wilms, the German surgeon (1867-1918) who first described it Wilms' tumor has many causes, which can broadly be categorized as syndromic and non-syndromic. Syndromic causes of Wilms' tumor occur as a result of alterations to genes such as the Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) or Wilms Tumor 2 (WT2) genes, and the tumor presents with a group of other signs and symptoms. Non-syndromic Wilms' tumor is not associated with other symptoms or pathologies. Many, but not all, cases of Wilms' tumor develop from nephrogenic rests, which are fragments of tissue in or around the kidney that develop before bih and become cancerous after bih. In paicular, cases of bilateral Wilms' tumor, as well as cases of Wilms' tumor derived from ceain genetic syndromes such as Denys-Drash syndrome, are strongly associated with nephrogenic rests. Most nephroblastomas are on one side of the body only and are found on both sides in less than 5% of cases, although people with Denys-Drash syndrome mostly have bilateral or multiple tumors. They tend to be encapsulated and vascularized tumors that do not cross the midline of the abdomen. In cases of metastasis it is usually to the lung. A rupture of Wilms' tumor puts the patient at risk of bleeding and peritoneal dissemination of the tumor. In such cases, surgical intervention by a surgeon who is experienced in the removal of such a fragile tumor is imperative. Pathologically, a triphasic nephroblastoma comprises three elements: blastema mesenchyme (stroma) epithelium Wilms' tumor is a malignant tumor containing metanephric blastema, stromal and epithelial derivatives. Characteristic is the presence of aboive tubules and glomeruli surrounded by a spindled cell stroma. The stroma may include striated muscle, cailage, bone, fat tissue, and fibrous tissue. Dysfunction is caused when the tumor compresses the normal kidney parenchyma. The mesenchymal component may include cells showing rhabdomyoid differentiation or malignancy (rhabdomyosarcomatous Wilms). Wilms' tumors may be separated into 2 prognostic groups based on pathologic characteristics: Favorable - Contains well developed components mentioned above Anaplastic - Contains diffuse anaplasia (poorly developed cells) Mutations of the WT1 gene on chromosome 11p13 are observed in approximately 20% of Wilms' tumors. At least half of the Wilms' tumors with mutations in WT1 also carry mutations in CTNNB1, the gene encoding the proto-oncogene beta-catenin Typical signs and symptoms of Wilms' tumor include the following: a painless, palpable abdominal mass loss of appetite abdominal pain fever nausea and vomiting blood in the urine (in about 20% of cases) high blood pressure in some cases (especially if synchronous or metachronous bilateral kidney involvement) Rarely as varicocele Ref Harrison20th edition pg 277",

In the early morning spot urine, a ratio of albumin (mg/L) to creatinine (mg/L) of < 30 mg/mg creatinine is normal and a ratio of 30-300 mg/mg creatinine suggests abnormal microalbuminuria.* Increased microalbuminuria correlates with increased levels of blood pressure and increased LDL cholesterol, and this may explain why increased proteinuria in diabetic patients is associated with an increase in cardiovascular deaths even in the absence of renal failure (1186-CMDT-05)",

As for the evaluation of hypercalcemia, determining the PTH level is central to the evaluation of hypocalcemia. A suppressed (or \"inappropriately low\") PTH level in the setting of hypocalcemia establishes absent or reduced PTH secretion (hypopar- athyroidism) as the cause of the hypocalcemia. Further history will often elicit the underlying cause (i. e., parathyroid agenesis vs. destruction). By contrast, an elevated PTH level (secondary hyperparathyroidism) should direct attention to the vitamin D axis as the cause of the hypocalcemia. Nutritional vitamin D deficiency is best assessed by obtaining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, which reflect vitamin D stores.

A renal scan is also known as a renal scintigraphy, renal imaging, or a renogram. During this procedure, a technician injects a radioactive material called a radioisotope into your vein. The radioisotope releases gamma rays. A gamma camera or scanner can detect gamma rays from outside your body. The gamma camera scans the kidney area. It tracks the radioisotope and measures how the kidneys process it. The camera also works with a computer to create images. These images detail the structure and functioning of the kidneys based on how they interact with the radioisotope. Images from a renal scan can show both structural and functional abnormalities.
