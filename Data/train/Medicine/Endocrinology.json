        "exp": "The synthesis and storage of thyroid hormones occurs between the follicular cells and the colloid. The storage form of thyroid hormone is thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin is a large glycoprotein synthesized in the follicular cells and has a molecular weight of around 650 000 with about 140 tyrosine residues, depending on the form of thyroglobulin. Approximately one quaer of these residues is iodinated at the apical-colloid interface. Once iodinated, thyroglobulin is taken up into the colloid of the follicle where, still incorporated in the protein, a coupling reaction between pairs of iodinated tyrosine molecules occurs. The coupling of two tyrosine residues each iodinated at two positions (di-iodotyrosine, DIT) produces tetra-iodothyronine or thyroxine (T4 ) whilst the combination of DIT with mono-iodotyrosine (MIT) produces tri-iodothyronine (T3 ). Such coupling can occur within a single molecule of thyroglobulin or between dimerized molecules of the protein. This coupling is catalyzed by TPO. Thyroid hormones are stored in this state and are only released when the thyroglobulin molecule is taken back up into the follicular cells. Stimulated by TSH, thyroglobulin droplets are captured by the follicular cells by a process of pinocytosis. Fusion of the droplets with lysosomes results in hydrolysis of the thyroglobulin molecules and release of T3 and T4. Reference: page 2285 Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 19th edition",

Similarly, glycosuria may have renal as well as endocrinologic causes. Therefore, these two conditions cannot be considered diagnostic of diabetes. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed in women between the twenty-fouh and twenty-eighth weeks of gestation, first using a 50-g oral glucose load if the I-h glucose level >7. 8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL); a 100-g oral glucose test is performed after an overnight fast.

Impaired production of 1, 25(OH) 2 D is now thought to be the principal factor that causes calcium deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone disease; hyperphosphatemia typically occurs only in the later stages of CKD. Low levels of 1, 25(OH) 2 D due to increased FGF23 production in bone are critical in the development of hypocalcemia. The uremic state also causes impairment of intestinal absorption by mechanisms other than defects in vitamin D metabolism. Nonetheless, treatment with supraphysiologic amounts of vitamin D or calcitriol corrects the impaired calcium absorption. Since increased FGF23 levels are seen even in early stages of renal failure in some patients, and have been repoed to correlate with increased moality, there is current interest in methods (lowering phosphate absorption) to lower FGF23 levels and concern as to whether vitamin D supplementation (known physiologically to increase FGF23) increases FGF23 in CKD. Hyperphosphatemia in renal failure lowers blood calcium levels by several mechanisms, including extraosseous deposition of calcium and phosphate, impairment of the bone-resorbing action of PTH, and reduction in 1, 25(OH) 2 D production by remaining renal tissue(harrison 18 pg 3116)</p>",

Later, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) studied over 5000 individuals with type 2 DM. Individuals receiving intensive glycemic control had a reduction in microvascular events but no significant change in macrovascular complications.

        "question": "In osteoporosis there is -",
        "exp": "Osteoporosis occurs because of a defect in attaining peak bone mass and/or because of accelerated bone loss. In normal individuals, bone mass increases during skeletal growth to reach a peak between the ages of 20 and 40 years but falls thereafter (see Fig. 25. 52). In women there is an accelerated phase of bone loss after the meno pause due to oestrogen deficiency, which causes uncou pling of bone resorption and bone formation, such that the amount of bone removed by osteoclasts exceeds the rate of new bone formation by osteoblasts. Agerelated bone loss is a distinct process that accounts for the gradual bone loss that occurs with advancing age in both genders. Bone resorption is not paicularly increased but bone formation is reduced and fails to keep pace with bone resorption. Accumulation of fat in the bone marrow space also occurs because of an agerelated decline in the ability of bone marrow stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts and an increase in their ability to differentiate into adipocytes. Peak bone mass and bone loss are regulated by both genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors account for up to 80% of the population variance in peak bone mass and other determinants of fracture risk, such as bone turnover and bone size. Polymorphisms have been identified in several genes that contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and many of these are in the RANK and Wnt signalling pathways, which play a critical role in regulating bone turnover (see Fig. 25. 2, p. 1061). However, these account for only a small propor tion of the genetic contribution to osteoporosis and many additional genetic variants remain to be discovered. Environmental factors, such as exercise and calcium intake during growth and adolescence, are impoant in maximising peak bone mass and in regulating rates of postmenopausal bone loss. Smoking has a detrimental effect on bone mineral density (BMD) and is associated with an increased fracture risk, paly because female smokers have an earlier menopause than nonsmokers. Heavy alcohol intake is a recognised cause of osteoporo sis and fractures, but moderate intake does not substan tially alter risk. DAVIDSON'S PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL MEDICINE 22.

Measurement of thyroid hormones: In is of no use as in medullary ca, the level of thyroid hormone is not altered. It secretes calcitonin*So the measurement of calcitonin level in serum after calcium or pentagastrin injection is done to diagnose this cancer. Note that the calcitonin level in serum is helpful in the diagnoses of MCT but it offers no specific advantage to the surgeons just before surgery. Serial determination of serum calcium, phosphorus, proteins and alkaline phosphatase: Hyperpara thyroidism is diagnosed by finding hyper calcemia, hypercalciuria, hypophosphatemia parathyroid hormone. But the diagnoses of hyperparathyroidism is not mandatory before performing surgery for MCT. 5 HIA A urinary estimation: has no value here as it is done for the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome*. Serial 24 hrs test for catecholamines, metanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid excretion: These are done for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Measurement of urinary catecholamine levels is of utmost importance before embarking upon thyroid surgery, because pheochromocytoma secretes large amount of catecholamine which cause hypertension, the secretion is further increased during surgery which causes large swings in B. P and arrhythmias. So if pheochromocytoma is diagnosed before surgery, the dangers may be minimised by preoperative preparation. The effect of catecholamines is blocked by giving a blockers and b blockers prior to surgery. Bailey says \"Pheochromocytoma must be excluded by measurement of urinary catecholamine levels in all cases before embracing upon thyroid surgery to avoid the potential hazards associated with this condition. \"",

Subacute thyroiditis may be responsible for 15-20% of patients presenting with thyrotoxicosis and 10% of patients presenting with hypothyroidism. Recognizing this condition is impoant; because it is self-limiting, no specific treatment, such as antithyroid or thyroid hormone replacement therapy, is necessary in most patients. In some cases antithyroids are used to allete the symptoms. In general, the following three forms of subacute thyroiditis are recognized: Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis - Also known as subacute painful or de Quervain thyroiditis Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis - Also known as subacute painless thyroiditis Subacute postpaum thyroiditis Treatment The treatment of subacute thyroiditis is generally suppoive to reduce the symptoms of thyrotoxicosis and to control neck pain in the setting of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. Because no new hormone is being made, antithyroid medications are not effective in these conditions. Although the abnormal thyroid levels are temporary, emotional suppo is often necessary. Patients are often dehydrated from thyrotoxicosis; encourage all patients to drink 6-8 cups per day of noncaffeinated fluids. Surgical care is almost never recommended for subacute thyroiditis.

        "exp": "Chlorpropamide belogs to class of sulphonylureas of anti diabetic drugs. The antabuse reaction, seen in patients imbibing alcohol while being treated with an antidiabetic sulfonylurea, is thought to be due to either an increase in acetaldehyde levels or an alteration in the metabolism of serotonin. Both can occur through an inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase. The oral antidiabetic sulfonylureas, chlorpropamide and tolbutamide, were found to be noncompetitive inhibitors of this enzyme. Acetaldehyde, a metabolite of ethanol, can competitively inhibit aldehyde dehydrogenase. Moreover, the oxidation of ethanol reverses the DPN/DPNH ratio so that the ored pathway of serotonin metabolism is altered, resulting in a decrease of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and an increase of 5-hydroxytryptophol. Thus, ethanol augments the action of the sulfonylureas. Whether the syndrome results from an accumulation of acetaldehyde due to a block in ethanol metabolism, or whether it is a result of an alteration in the metabolism of serotonin, the noncompetitive inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase by the sulfonylureas, coupled with the actions of ethanol, may be considered as a potential cause.

'Milk-Alkali Syndrome. The milk-alkali syndrome is due to excessive ingestion of calcium and absorbable antacids such as milk or calcium carbonateQ. It is much less frequent since proton-pump inhibitors and other treatments became available for peptic ulcer disease. For a time, the increased use of calcium carbonate in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism led to reappearance of the syndrome. Several clinical presentations-acute, subacute, and chronic-have been described, all of which feature hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal failureQ. The chronic form of the disease, termed Burnett's syndrome, is associated with irreversible renal damageQ. The acute syndromes reverse if the excess calcium and absorbable alkali are stoppedQ. Individual susceptibility is dependent on the fractional calcium absorption as a function of calcium intake. Some individuals absorb a high fraction of calcium, even with intakes > 2 g of elemental calcium per day, instead of reducing calcium absorption with high intake, as occurs in most normal individuals. Development of hypercalcemia causes increased sodium excretion and some depletion of total-body water. These phenomena and perhaps some suppression of endogenous PTH secretion due to mild hypercalcemia lead to increased bicarbonate resorption and to alkalosis in the face of continued calcium carbonate ingestion. Alkalosis per se selectively enhances calcium resorption in the distal nephron, thus aggravating the hypercalcemia. The cycle of mild hypercalcemia - bicarbonate retention - alkalosis - renal calcium retention - severe hypercalcemia perpetuates and aggravates hypercalcemia and alkalosis as long as calcium and absorbable alkali are ingestedQ.",

Major secretory pulses occur between 10 p. m. and 4 a. m., and the mean levels are approximately 1. 3-1. 4 m. IU/L, with a lower limit of 0. 3-0. 5 m. IU/L and an upper limit of 3. 9-5. 5 m. IU/L (10). Changes in serum TSH levels can be attributed to its pulsatile and nocturnal secretion Currently, the normal reference range of serum TSH for adults is 0. 4-4. 5 m. IU/L. Consistent studies confirm that serum TSH levels are age-dependent and that adult reference values do not correspond to those observed in pediatric patients; TSH levels continuously decrease from the neonatal period until the end of adolescence.

PITUITARY TUMORS# Pituitary adenomas are the most common cause of pituitary hormone hypersecretion and hyposecretion syndromes in adults. They account for -15% of all intracranial neoplasms. Pathogenesis:# Pituitary adenomas are benign neoplasms that arise from one of the five anterior pituitary cell types - tumors arising from lactotrope (PRL), somatotrope (GH), corticotrope (ACTH), thyrotrope (TSH), or gonadotrope (LH, FSH) cells hypersecrete their respective hormones, with prolactinomas being the most common variety.# Several familial syndromes are associated with pituitary tumors, like Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1, Carney syndrome, Me. Cline-Albright syndrome and Familial acromegaly. C/f: Features of Sellar Mass Lesions: Impacted Structure. Clinical Impact. Pituitary.

Opthalmoplegia with or without ptosis or diplopia, Facial numbness. Frontal lobe. Personality disorder, Anosmia. Brain. Headache, Hydrocephalus, Psychosis, Dementia, Laughing seizures. Investigations# MRI: Sagittal and coronal T1-weighted MRI imaging, before and after administration of gadolinium, allow precise visualization of the pituitary gland with clear delineation of the hypothalamus, pituitary stalk, pituitary tissue and surrounding suprasellar cisterns, cavernous sinuses, sphenoid sinus, and optic chiasm. Pituitary gland height ranges from 6 mm in children to 8 mm in adults; during pregnancy and puberty, the height may reach 10-12 mm. The upper aspect of the adult pituitary is flat or slightly concave, but in adolescent and pregnant individuals, this surface may be convex, reflecting physiologic pituitary enlargement. The stalk should be midline and vertical. CT scan is indicated to define the extent of bony erosion or the presence of calcification.- Anterior pituitary gland soft tissue consistency is slightly heterogeneous on MRI, and signal intensity resembles that of brain matter on T1-weighted imaging. Adenoma density is usually lower than that of surrounding normal tissue on T1 -weighted imaging, and the signal intensity increases with T2-weighted images. The high phospholipid content of the posterior pituitary results in a \"pituitary bright spot. \"Screening Tests for Functional Pituitary Adenomas Test. Comments. Acromegaly.

Rx:# MRI technology with gadolinium enhancement for pituitary visualization, new advances in transsphenoidal surgery and in stereotactic radiotherapy (including gamma-knife radiotherapy), and novel therapeutic agents have improved pituitary tumor management.# The goals of pituitary tumor Rx include normalization of excess pituitary secretion, amelioration of symptoms and signs of hormonal hypersecretion syndromes, and shrinkage or ablation of large tumor masses with relief of adjacent structure compression.# Residual anterior pituitary function should be preserved and can sometimes be restored by removing the tumor mass. Ideally, adenoma recurrence should be prevented. PROLACTINOMA# Introduction:- Tumors arising from lactotrope cells account for about half of all functioning pituitary tumors.- Hyperprolactinemia is the most common pituitary hormone hypersecretion syndrome in both men and women PRL-secreting pituitary adenomas (prolactinomas) are the most common cause of PRL levels >100 g/L. Less pronounced PRL elevation can also be seen with microprolactinomas but is more commonly caused by drugs, pituitary stalk compression, hypothyroidism, or renal failure.# C/f:- Amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and infertility are the hallmarks of hyperprolactinemia in women. If hyperprolactinemia develops prior to menarche, primary amenorrhea results.- If the tumor extends outside of the sella, visual field defects or other mass effects seen.- In men with hyperprolactinemia, diminished libido, infertility, or visual loss (from optic nerve compression) are the usual presenting symptoms. Gonadotropin suppression leads to reduced testosterone, impotence, and oligospermia.# Rx.:- As microadenomas rarely progress to become macroadenomas, no Rx may be needed if fertility is not desired. Estrogen replacement is indicated to prevent bone loss and other consequences of hypoestrogenemia and does not appear to increase the risk of tumor enlargement.- For symptomatic microadenomas, therapeutic goals include control of hyperprolactinemia, reduction of tumor size, restoration of menses and fertility, and resolution of galactorrhea.- Oral dopamine agonists (cabergoline or bromocriptine) are the mainstay of therapy for patients with micro- or macroprolactinomas.- Other Dopamine Agonists include pergolide mesylate, an ergot derivative with dopaminergic properties; lisuride, an ergot derivative; and quinagolide (CV 205-502, Norprolac), a nonergot oral dopamine agonist with specific D2 receptor activity.- Indications for surgical adenoma debulking include dopamine resistance or intolerance, or the presence of an invasive macroadenoma with compromised vision that fails to improve after drug Rx.",

In this context, aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) have received much attention worldwide. Decreased sorbitol flux through polyol pathway by ARIs could be an emerging target for the management of major complications of diabetes. The ARIs developed vary structurally, and representative structural classes of ARIs include i) carboxylic acid derivatives (such as Epalrestat, Alrestatin, Zopalrestat, Zenarestat, Ponalrestat, Lidorestat, and Tolrestat), ii) spirohydantoins and related cyclic amides (such as Sorbinil, Minalrestat, and Fidarestat), and iii) phenolic derivatives (related to Benzopyran-4-one and Chalcone). Among these inhibitors, Epalrestat is the only commercially available inhibitor till date. In addition, some other ARIs such as Sorbinil and Ranirestat had been advanced into late stage of clinical trials and found to be safe for human use. Adapting ARIs could prevent sepsis complications, prevent angiogenesis, ameliorate mild or asymptomatic diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy and appear to be a promising strategy for the treatment of endotoxemia and other ROS-induced inflammatory diseases.

The pituitary gland is physiologically enlarged in pregnancy and is therefore very sensitive to the decreased blood flow caused by massive hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock. The typical picture is failure of lactation (first sign often), amenorrhoea, hypothyroidism and adrenocoical insufficiency. Treatment of young women with Sheehan's syndrome usually includes replacement of hydrocoisone first and then replacement of thyroid hormone and estrogen with or without progesterone depending on whether she has a uterus. Hydrocoisone is replaced first because thyroxine therapy can exacerbate glucocoicoid deficiency and theoretically induce an adrenal crisis. The standard dose of hydrocoisone is 20 mg/d for an adult (15 mg every morning and 5 mg every evening). Reference: page 402 Textbook of Obstetrics Sheila Balakrishnan 2nd edition",

        "exp": "The clinical presentation of primary hyperparathyroidism is described on page 769. Parathyroid bone disease is now rare due to earlier diagnosis and treatment. Osteitis fibrosa results from increased bone resorption by osteoclasts with fibrous replacement in the lacunae. This may present as bone pain and tenderness, fracture and deformity. Chondrocalcinosis can occur due to deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals within aicular cailage. It typically affects the menisci at the knees and can result in secondary degenerative ahritis or predispose to attacks of acute pseudogout Skeletal X-rays are usually normal in mild primary hyperparathyroidism, but in patients with advanced disease characteristic changes are observed. In the early stages there is demineralisation, with subperiosteal erosions and terminal resorption in the phalanges. A 'pepper-pot' appearance may be seen on lateral X-rays of the skull. Reduced bone mineral density, resulting in either osteopenia or osteoporosis, is now the most common skeletal manifestation of hyperparathyroidism. This is usually not evident radiographically and requires assessment by DEXA (p. 1065). Primary hyperparathyroidism Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by autonomous secretion of PTH, usually by a single parathyroid adenoma, which can vary in diameter from a few millimetres to several centimetres. It should be distinguished from secondary hyperparathyroidism, in which there is a physiological increase in PTH secretion to compensate for prolonged hypocalcaemia (such as in vitamin D deficiency, p. 1126), and from teiary hyperparathyroidism, in which continuous stimulation of the parathyroids over a prolonged period of time results in adenoma formation and autonomous PTH secretion (Box 20. 39). This is most commonly seen in individuals with advanced chronic kidney disease (p. 483). The prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism is about 1 in 800 and it is 2-3 times more common in women than men; 90% of patients are over 50 years of age. It also occurs in the familial MEN syndromes (p. 795), in which case hyperplasia or multiple adenomas of all four parathyroid glands are more likely than a solitary adenoma. Clinical and radiological features The clinical presentation of primary hyperparathyroidism is described on page 769. Parathyroid bone disease is now rare due to earlier diagnosis and treatment. Osteitis fibrosa results from increased bone resorption by osteoclasts with fibrous replacement in the lacunae. This may present as bone pain and tenderness, fracture and deformity.

It typically affects the menisci at the knees and can result in secondary degenerative ahritis or predispose to attacks of acute pseudogout In nephrocalcinosis, scattered opacities may be visible within the renal outline. There may be soft tissue calcif ication in aerial walls and hands and in the cornea. DAVIDSONS PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE 22. ND EDITION PAGE NO-769",

Thin patient with hyperpigmented skin. Laboratory abnormalities: Hyponatremia (Normal Value: 135-145 m. Eq). Hyperkalemia (Normal Valve: 3. 5-5. 5 m. Eq) with a mild metabolic acidosis from the inability to excrete either H+ or K+ because of the loss of aldosterone. Hypoglycemia and neutropenia: Glucocorticoids increase glucose and white cell levels. Diagnostic Testing. Cosyntropin (synthetic ACTH) stimulation test: It measures the level of cortisol before and after the administration of cosyntropin. CT scan of the adrenal gland: Evidence of damage gland. Gene XPERT for MTB. Treatment. Steroid replacement is DOC in adrenal insufficiency (acute and chronic) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Hydrocortisone is the steroid of choice in Addison's disease. The doses of steroids:#Children: 10 mg/m2/day in three dived doses#Adults: 15-30 mg/m2/day in three dived doses. Drug of Choice for Addisonian crisis: IV hydrocortisone + Fluid resuscitation. Prednisone: For stable patients (non-hypotensive). Fludrocortisone: It promotes salt and water retention. It is used for patients with adrenal insufficiencies who are still hypotensive after initial replacement with prednisone. Dexamethasone: Cortisol like activity; but reduces hypoglycemic symptoms.",

Explanation:\"Notably absent are symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain and the Kussmaul respirations characteristic of DKA. \" Ref: Harrison. Nonketotic Hyperosmolar Coma. Aka Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State. This syndrome is characterized by. Severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose >800 mg/dL). Absence of or only slight ketosis. Nonketotic acidosis. Severe dehydration. Depressed sensorium or frank coma. Neurologic signs that may include grand mal seizures, hyperthermia, hemiparesis. and positive Babinski signs. Clinical Features. Classically, elderly individual with type 2 DM. with a several-week history of polyuria, weight loss, and diminished oral intake that culminates in mental confusion, lethargy, or coma. The physical examination reflects profound dehydration and hyperosmolality and reveals hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and Kussmaul respirations (characteristic of DKA) are ABSENTPrecipitated by a serious, concurrent illness such as myocardial infarction, stroke or Sepsis. Pathophysiology. Relative insulin deficiency and inadequate fluid intake are the underlying causes of HHS. Insulin deficiency increases hepatic glucose production (through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis) and impairs glucose utilization in skeletal muscle. Hyperglycemia induces an osmotic diuresis that leads to intravascular volume depletion, which is exacerbated by inadequate fluid replacement. The absence of ketosis in HHS is not well understood. Presumably, the insulin deficiency is only- relative and less severe than in DKA. Lower levels of counterregulatory hormones and free fatty acids have been found in HHS than in DKA. Liver is less capable of ketone body synthesis or that the insulin, ''glucagon ratio does not favor ketogenesis. Laboratory Abnormalities and Diagnosis. Most notable are the: Marked hyperglycemia, Hyperosmolality (>350 mosmol/L), and. Prerenal azotemia. The measured serum sodium may be normal or slightly low despite the marked hyperglycemia. The corrected serum sodium is usually increased ladd 1. 6 meq to measured sodium for each 5. 6- mmol/L (100 mg/dL) rise in the serum glucose]. In contrast to DKA. acidosis and ketonemia are absent or mild. A small anion-gap metabolic acidosis may be present secondary to increased lactic acid. Moderate ketonuria. if present, is secondary to starvation. Treatment: Volume depletion and hyperglycemia are prominent features of both HHS and DKA. In both disorders, careful monitoring of the patient's fluid status, laboratory values, and insulin infusion rate is crucial. Underlying or precipitating problems should be aggressively sought and treated. In HHS, fluid losses and dehydration are usually more pronounced than in DKAThe patient with HHS is usually older, more likely to have mental status changes, and more likely to have a life-threatening precipitating event with accompanying comorbidities. Even with proper treatment, HHS has a substantially higher mortality rate than DKA (up to 15%). Fluid replacement should initially stabilize the hemodynamic status of the patient (1-3 L of 0. 9% normal saline over the first 2-3 h). Because the fluid deficit in HHS is accumulated over a period of days to weeks, the rapidity of reversal of the hyperosmolar state must balance the need for free water repletion with the risk that too rapid a reversal may worsen neurologic function. If the serum sodium > 150 mmol/L (150 meq/ L), 0. 45% saline should be used. After hemodynamic stability is achieved, the IV tluid administration is directed at reversing the free water deficit using hypotonic fluids (0. 45% saline initially, then 5% dextrose in water, D5W). The calculated free water deficit (which averages 9-10 L) should be reversed over the next 1-2 days (infusion rates of 200-300 mL/h of hypotonic solution). Hypophosphatemia may occur during therapy and can be improved by using KPG4 and beginning nutrition. A reasonable regimen for HHS begins with an IV insulin bolus of 0. 1 units/kg followed by IV insulin at a constant infusion rate of 0. 1 units/ kg per hour. The insulin infusion should be continued until the patient has resumed eating and can be transferred to a SC insulin regimen.",

Hypercalcemia from any cause can result in fatigue, depression, mental confusion, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, reversible renal tubular defects, increased urination, a sho QT interval in the electrocardiogram, and, in some patients, cardiac arrhythmias. There is a variable relation from one patient to the next between the severity of hypercalcemia and the symptoms.

Similarly, intestinal malabsorption of dietary fats leads to vitamin D deficiency. The most specific screening test for vitamin D deficiency in oth- erwise healthy individuals is a serum 25(OH)D level. Although the normal ranges vary, levels of 25(OH)D <37 nmol/L (<15 ng/ mL) are associated with increasing PTH levels and lower bone density; optimal vitamin D levels are >80 nmol/L (>32 ng/mL). Vitamin D deficiency leads to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium, resulting in decreased serum total and ionized calcium val- ues. This hypocalcemia results in secondary hyperparathyroidism, a homeostatic response that initially maintains serum calcium levels at the expense of the skeleton. Due to the PTH-induced increase in bone turnover, alkaline phosphatase levels are often increased. In addition to increasing bone resorption, PTH decreases urinary calcium excretion while promoting phosphaturia. This results in hypophosphatemia, which exacerbates the mineralization defect in the skeleton. With prolonged vitamin D deficiency resulting in osteomalacia, calcium stores in the skeleton become relatively inaccessible, since osteoclasts cannot resorb unmineralized osteoid, and frank hypocalcemia ensues( Harrison 17 pg 2376)",

Bailey and Love 25th/108)BICALUTAMIDE# is an anti-androgenic drug used in prostatic cancer therapy for medical castration.# The addition of actual antagonists of androgens acting at the androgen receptor, including flutamide or bicalutamide, is of uncertain additional benefit in extending overall response duration, but it clearly prevents the activation of androgen receptors by adrenal androgens, and the combined use of orchiectomy or leuprolide plus flutamide is referred to as \"total androgen blockade. \"# Other hormones that may be active include estrogens, progestins, ketoconazole, and glucocorticoids.

Educational Points:# Prostate cancer is classically treated by diethylstilbesterol (DES) acting as an estrogen at the level of the hypothalamus to down-regulate hypothalamic LH production, resulting in decreased elaboration of testosterone by the testicle. For this reason, orchiectomy is equally as effective as moderate-dose DES.# In the event that orchiectomy is not accepted by the patient, testicular androgen suppression can also be effected by luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists such as leuprolide and goserelin.# Primary hormonal manipulation in prostate cancer one can choose orchiectomy or leuprolide, not both.",

Precipitating factors of DKA include insufficient or interrupted insulin therapy, infection, emotional stress, and excessive alcohol ingestion. The main problems in DKA stem from acidosis with increased anion gap and dehydration. Clinical findings: Anorexia, nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, rapid breathing (Kussmaul respiration), \"fruity\" breath odour of acetone, signs of dehydration (dry skin and mucous membranes and poor skin turgor), and altered consciousness to coma. Acidosis can result in fatal rhythm disturbance. Diagnosis: The diagnosis of DKA can be made by finding elevated blood glucose, increased serum levels of acetoacetate, acetone, and hydroxybutyrate, metabolic acidosis (low serum bicarbonate and low blood pH), and increased anion gap (sodium-). DKA is managed with insulin, fluids, and electrolyte replacement. Normal saline should be given in high volume with insulin replacement. Bolus with 5-10 units of regular insulin. Acutely, DKA is associated with hyperkalemia. The total body level of potassium is depleted because of the urinary loss of potassium. As soon as the potassium level falls to <5 m. Eq/L, potassium replacement should be given.

        "exp": "Chlorpropamide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating b cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic b cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Chlorpropamide is not recommended for the treatment of NIDDM as it increases blood pressure and the risk of retinopathy. Up to 80% of the single oral dose of chlorpropramide is metabolized, likely in the liver; 80-90% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. Renal and hepatic dysfunction may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Chlorpropamide (CPM) has been repoed to produce impaired water excretion due to the enhancement of renal vasopressin (ADH) action and/or due to centrally enhanced ADH release, but it is still unknown for sure whether CPM gives rise to ADH release with a subsequent hyponatremia in diabetes mellitus.

Pseudohyperaldosteronism can be due to a direct mineralocoicoid effect, as with desoxycoicosterone, fluorohydrocoisone, fluoroprednisolone, estrogens, and the ingestion of high amounts of glycyrrhetinic acid. A block of 11-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase type 2 (11. HSD2), the enzyme that conves coisol into coisone, at the level of epithelial target tissues of aldosterone, is involved in other cases. This mechanism is related either to a mutation of the gene, which encodes 11. HSD2 (apparent mineralocoicoid excess syndrome and some cases of low renin hypertension) or to an acquired reduction of the activity of the enzyme due to glycyrrhetinic acid, carbenoxolone, and grapefruit juice. In other cases saturation of 11. HSD2 may be involved as in severe Cushing's syndrome and chronic therapy with some coicosteroids. Recently, an activating mutation of the mineralocoicoid receptor gene has been described. Another genetic cause of pseudohyperaldosteronism is the syndrome of Liddle, which is due to a mutation of the gene encoding for beta and gamma subunits of the sodium channels.

When osteo clasts attempt to resorb bone that contains bisphos phonate, the drug is released within the cell, where it inhibits key signalling pathways that are essential for osteoclast function. Although bisphosphonates prima rily target the osteoclast, bone formation is also sup pressed because of coupling between bone formation and bone resorption and an inhibitory effect on osteo blasts. However, the balance of effect on bone turnover is ourable, resulting in a gain in bone density due paly to increased mineralisation of bone. Bisphospho nate treatment typically leads to an increase in spine BMD of about 5-8% and in hip BMD of 2-4% during the f irst 3 years of treatment and plateaus thereafter. Alendronic acid is the bisphosphonate used most fre quently. It reduces risk of veebral fractures by 40% and nonveebral fractures by about 25% in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

        "exp": "Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a condition in which the body makes too much antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This hormone helps the kidneys control the amount of water your body loses through the urine. SIADH causes the body to retain too much water. Actions of ADH Osmoregulation The most impoant and primary function of ADH is to maintain the plasma tonicity, primarily by an alteration in water balance. Osmoreceptors detect the change in effective plasma osmolality in the hypothalamus. A decrease in tonicity prevents ADH release and prevents water retention. An increase in tonicity causes ADH release, which acts on V2 receptors on the luminal surface of coical and medullary collecting tubular cells. Under the influence of ADH, unique aquaporin-2 water channels are formed by the fusion of pre-formed cytoplasmic vesicles in the tubular cells and water is absorbed down the concentration gradient. Once the water is absorbed, these channels are removed by endocytosis and returned to the cytoplasm. In patients with SIADH, levels of ADH are high even in the presence of decreased plasma osmolality and/or hyponatremia. Excess water absorption keeps the blood volume high or normal. Volume Regulation An acute drop in blood pressure as sensed by \" volume receptors\" rather then \"osmoreceptors\" causes ADH release (along with other hormones like rennin and epinephrine) which generates free water absorption from the kidneys. This can potentially lead to hyponatremia and a decrease in effective ECF osmolality. So, the main focus in rapid and/or substantial decrease in blood volume is \"volume regulation, \" even at the cost of osmolality. This affect is more prominent in patients with liver disease or cardiac disease, and hyponatremia in such patients is the direct predictor of a worse prognosis Clinical manifestations of SIADH can be due to hyponatremia and decreased ECF osmolality which causes the water to move into the cells causing cerebral edema. Signs and symptoms depend upon the rate and severity of hyponatremia and the degree of cerebral edema. The earliest clinical manifestations of acute hyponatremia include nausea and malaise, which may be seen when the serum sodium concentration falls below 125 to 130 m. Eq/L (normal 135 to 145m. Eq/L). Vomiting is an ominous sign for patients with acute hyponatremia. With a more severe and acute fall in sodium concentration, headache, lethargy, obtundation, and eventually, seizures can occur. Coma and respiratory arrest can occur if the serum sodium level falls below 115 to 120 m. Eq/L. Acute hyponatremic encephalopathy may be reversible, but permanent neurologic damage or death can occur, paicularly in premenopausal women. Chronic hyponatremia allows cerebral adaptation, and the patients remain asymptomatic despite a serum sodium concentration below 120mmol/L. Nonspecific symptoms like nausea, vomiting, gait disturbances, memory and cognitive problems, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, and muscle cramps can occur with chronic hyponatremia. Sign and symptoms or mild and chronic hyponatremia are often subtle and missed during history and physical examination. Nausea and vomiting effect approximately one-third of patients with chronic hyponatremia who have a serum sodium concentration less then 120 mmol/L. The Idiopathic SIADH is more common in patients over 65 years of age, and mild to moderate hyponatremia in such patients may contribute to fractures in addition to a higher risk of falls and gait problems.

The major cause of these hormonal changes is the release of cytokines such as IL-6. This is called Sick Euthyroid Syndrome (Nonthyroidal illness). The most common hormone pattern in sick euthyroid syndrome (SES) is a decrease in total and unbound T3 levels (low T3 syndrome) with normal levels of T4 and TSH. The magnitude of the fall in T3 correlates with the severity of the illness. T4 conversion to T3 peripheral 5' (outer ring) deiodination is impaired, leading to increased reverse T3 (r. T3). Since r. T3 is metabolized by 5' deiodination, its clearance is also reduced. Thus, decreased clearance rather than increased production is the major basis for increased r. T3.

        "exp": "Growth factors can act on specific cell surface receptors that subsequently transmit their growth signals to other intracellular components and eventually result in altered gene expression. The general process of transmitting an external molecular signal to a cell to evoke a cellular response is called signal transduction. The receptor binding site for peptide/protein growth factors is on the outer cell membrane surface, in other words, the extracellular domain. Most cell surface receptors for growth factors show tyrosine kinase activity, meaning they put a phosphate group on a downstream protein tyrosine residue. An exception is the surface receptors for the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of cytokines. When activated by the binding of TGF-beta cytokines, this receptor can phosphorylate downstream proteins on serine and threonine residues. \"Downstream\" here means an event triggered after TGF-beta binding to its receptor. Some growth factors are small peptides called cytokines. While all cytokines affect signal transduction pathways, only those cytokines affecting cell growth/differentiation signaling pathways are considered growth factors. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is an example of a cytokine growth factor since it promotes the production of white blood cells by stem cells. Examples of protein growth factors are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Ref - Harrison 17/e p 2190, <a href=\"",

Older adults should also follow these guidelines as far as their abilities allow. Recently, it has also been suggested that a combination of both aerobic and resistance exercise may lead to greater improvements in glycaemic control. In type 1 diabetes, exercise can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia, so patients should seek specialist advice on taking extra carbohydrate, reducing insulin doses and choosing an injection site.

Monitor glucose during exercise and ingest carbohydrate to prevent hypoglycemia. Decrease insulin doses (based on previous experience) before exercise and inject insulin into a non-exercising area. Learn individual glucose responses to different types of exercise and increase food intake for up to 24 h after exercise, depending on intensity and duration of exercise. In individuals with type 2 DM. exercise-related hypoglycemia is less common but can occur in individuals taking either insulin or insulin secretagogues. Untreated proliferative retinopathy is a relative contraindication to vigorous exercise, as this may lead to vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment. Nutritional Recommendations for Adults with Diabetes. Weight loss diet (in prediabetes and type 2 DM). Hypocaloric diet that is low-fat or low-carbohydrate. Fat in diet. Minimal trans fat consumption. Carbohydrate in diet. Monitor carbohydrate intake in regards to calories. Sucrose-containing foods may be consumed with adjustments in insulin dose. Amount of carbohydrate determined by estimating grams of carbohydrate in diet for (type 1 DM). Glycemic index reflects how consumption of a particular food affects the blood glucose. Protein in diet: as part of an optimal diet. Other components. Nonnutrient sweeteners. Routine supplements of vitamins, antioxidants, or trace elements not advised",

However, more rarely, NME can also be seen as a pa of other clinical entities such as liver disease and intestinal malabsorption; here it is termed the pseudoglucagonoma syndrome. The skin rash is characteristically extremely erythematous, shows superficial epidermal necrosis and often spreads in a centrifugal pattern. The condition is frequently misdiagnosed due in pa to its rarity and often is the presenting symptom of the pancreatic islet neoplasm.

It occurs due to either overactivation of the entire thyroid gland, or more commonly autonomous nodules within the gland after iodine repletion without adequate feedback control from the pituitary gland. Wolff-Chaikoff effect is a phenomenon where excess iodide transiently inhibits thyroid iodide organification leading to hypothyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis factitia is a condition in which patients induce thyrotoxicosis by consuming excessive amounts of a thyroid hormone preparation, most often levothyroxine. The exogenous thyroxine suppresses pituitary TSH secretion and hence iodine uptake, serum thyroglobulin and release of endogenous thyroid hormone. The circulating T3 is derived exclusively from peripheral monodeiodination of T4. de Quervain's (subacute) thyroiditis is a transient inflammation of the thyroid gland occuring after infection with Coxsackie, mumps or adenoviruses.

However, there are several diseases or conditions in which the body fails to maintain adequate levels of glucose in the blood after a period without food (fasting hypoglycemia). In people who drink heavily without eating, alcohol can block the formation of glucose in the liver. In people with advanced liver disease, such as viral hepatitits, cirrhosis, or cancer, the liver may not be able to store and produce sufficient glucose. Infants and children who have an abnormality of the enzyme systems that control glucose use (such as a glycogen storage disorder) also may have fasting hypoglycemia. A rare cause of fasting hypoglycemia is an insulinoma, which is an insulin-producing tumor in the pancreas.

Factitious hypoglycemia results from exogenous self-administration of insulin or insulin secretagogues medications (e. g., sulfonylureas, meglitinides). Note that insulin-sensitizing drugs like metformin, do not cause hypoglycemia. Insulin synthesis occurs in the beta cells of the pancreas as proinsulin, which is then processed and cleaved into insulin, and C peptide held together by disulfide bonds and excreted into the circulation. Insulin will be then rapidly removed by the liver, whereas C peptide remains in the circulation for a more extended period till the kidneys clear it and the insulin to C peptide ratio in healthy individuals will be less than one. Some proinsulin molecules would also get excreted in the blood without processing, and this is still detectable in the plasma. Serum C-peptide is a marker of endogenous insulin secretion (a synthetic insulin does not contain C-peptide) and is paicularly useful if a patient is on exogenous (injected) insulin treatment, when insulin assays would simply detect the injected insulin.

        "exp": "Urine testing Glucose -Testing the urine for glucose with dipsticks is a common screening procedure for detecting diabetes. If possible, testing should be performed on urine passed 1-2 hours after a meal to maximise sensitivity. Glycosuria always warrants fuher assessment by blood testing (see below). The greatest disadvantage of urinary glucose measurement is the individual variation in renal threshold for glucose. The most frequent cause of glycosuria is a low renal threshold, which is common during pregnancy and in young people; the resulting 'renal glycosuria' is a benign condition unrelated to diabetes. Another disadvantage is that some drugs (such as b-lactam antibiotics, levodopa and salicylates) may interfere with urine glucose tests. Ketones -Ketone bodies can be identified by the nitroprusside reaction, which measures acetoacetate, using either tablets or dipsticks. Ketonuria may be found in normal people who have been fasting or exercising strenuously for long periods, who have been vomiting repeatedly, or who have been eating a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrate. Ketonuria is therefore not pathognomonic of diabetes but, if associated with glycosuria, the diagnosis of diabetes is highly likely. In diabetic ketoacidosis (p. 811), ketones can also be detected in plasma using test sticks (see below). Protein -Standard dipstick testing for albumin detects urinary albumin at concentrations above 300 mg/L, but smaller amounts (microalbuminuria, see Box 17. 13, p. 476) can only be measured using specific albumin dipsticks or by quantitative biochemical laboratory measurement. Microalbuminuria or proteinuria, in the absence of urinary tract infection, is an impoant indicator of diabetic nephropathy and/or increased risk of macrovascular disease (p. 830). Blood testing Glucose- Laboratory glucose testing in blood relies upon an enzymatic reaction (glucose oxidase) and is cheap, usually automated and highly reliable. However, blood glucose levels depend on whether the patient has eaten recently, so it is impoant to consider the circumstances in which the blood sample was taken. Blood glucose can also be measured with colorimetric or other testing sticks, which are often read with a poable electronic meter. These are used for capillary (fingerprick) testing to monitor diabetes treatment (p. 810). There is some debate as to whether selfmonitoring in people with type 2 diabetes improves glycaemic control. Many countries now only offer selfmonitoring to people with type 2 diabetes taking blood glucose concentration should be estimated using an accurate laboratory method rather than a poable technique. Glucose concentrations are lower in venous than aerial or capillary (fingerprick) blood. Whole blood glucose concentrations are lower than plasma concentrations because red blood cells contain relatively little glucose. Venous plasma values are usually the most reliable for diagnostic purposes (Boxes 21. 10 and 21. 11). Ketones -Blood ketone monitoring is increasingly available. Urinary ketone measurements described above are semi-quantitative, difficult to perform and retrospective (i. e. the urine has accumulated over several hours), and do not measure the major ketone in blood during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (b. OHB). Whole blood ketone monitoring detects b-OHB and is useful in assisting with insulin adjustment during intercurrent illness or sustained hyperglycaemia to prevent or detect DKA. Blood ketone monitoring is also useful in monitoring resolution of DKA in hospitalised patients (Box 21. 7). Glycated hemoglobin Glycated hemoglobin provides an accurate and objective measure of glycaemic control integrated over a period of weeks to months. In diabetes, the slow non-enzymatic covalent attachment of glucose to hemoglobin (glycation) increases the amount in the Hb. A1 (Hb. A1c) fraction relative to nonglycated adult hemoglobin (Hb. A0). These fractions can be separated by chromatography; laboratories may repo glycated hemoglobin as total glycated hemoglobin (GHb), Hb. A1 or Hb. A1c. In most countries, Hb. A1c is the preferred measurement. The rate of formation of Hb. A1c is directly propoional to the ambient blood glucose concentration; a rise of 1% in Hb. A1c corresponds to an approximate average increase of 2 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) in blood glucose. Although Hb. A1c concentration reflects the integrated blood glucose control over the lifespan of erythrocytes (120 days), Hb. A1c is most sensitive to changes in glycaemic control occurring in the month before measurement. DAVIDSONS PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE 22. ND EDITION PAGE NO-807, 808",

        "exp": "Despite all the treatments now available, the outcome for patients with diabetes remains disappointing. Longterm complications of diabetes still cause significant morbidity and moality (Boxes 21. 31 and 21. 32). Excess moality in diabetes is caused mainly by large blood vessel disease, paicularly myocardial infarction and stroke. Macrovascular disease also causes substantial morbidity from myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, cardiac failure and intermittent claudication. The pathological changes of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients are similar to those in the non-diabetic population but occur earlier in life and are more extensive and severe. Diabetes amplifies the effects of the other major cardiovascular risk factors: smoking, hypertension and dyslipidaemia (Fig. 21. 11). Moreover, patients with type 2 diabetes are more likely to have additional cardiovascular risk factors, which co-segregate with insulin resistance in the metabolic syndrome (p. 805). Disease of small blood vessels is a specific complication of diabetes and is termed diabetic microangiopathy. It contributes to moality through renal failure caused by diabetic nephropathy, and is responsible for substantial morbidity and disability: for example, blindness from diabetic retinopathy, difficulty in walking, chronic ulceration of the feet from peripheral neuropathy, and bowel and bladder dysfunction from autonomic neuropathy. The risk of microvascular disease is positively correlated with the duration and degree of sustained hyperglycaemia, however caused and at whatever age it develops.

        "exp": "<p>The causes of hypocalcemia can be differentiated according to whether serum PTH levels are low (hypoparathyroidism) or high (secondary hyperparathyroidism). Although there are many potential causes of hypocalcemia, impaired PTH or vitamin D production are the most common etiologies. Because PTH is the main defense against hypocalcemia, disorders associated with deficient PTH production or secretion may be associated with profound, life-threatening hypocalcemia. In adults, hypoparathyroidism most commonly results from inadveent damage to all four glands during thyroid or parathyroid gland surgery. Hypoparathyroidism is a cardinal feature of autoimmune endocrinopathies; rarely, it may be associated with infiltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis. Impaired PTH secretion may be secondary to magnesium deficiency or to activating mutations in the Ca. SR, which suppress PTH, leading to effects that are opposite to those that occur in FHH. Vitamin D deficiency, impaired 1, 25(OH) 2 D production (primarily secondary to renal insufficiency), or vitamin D resistance also cause hypocalcemia. However, the degree of hypocalcemia in these disorders is generally not as severe as that seen with hypoparathyroidism because the parathyroids are capable of mounting a compensatory increase in PTH secretion. Hypocalcemia may also occur in conditions associated with severe tissue injury such as burns, rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis, or pancreatitis. The cause of hypocalcemia in these settings may include a combination of low albumin, hyperphosphatemia, tissue deposition of calcium, and impaired PTH secretion. \u0002 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS Patients with hypocalcemia may be asymptomatic if the decreases in serum calcium are relatively mild and chronic, or they may present with life-threatening complications. Moderate to severe hypocalcemia is associated with paresthesias, usually of the fingers, toes, and circumoral regions, and is caused by increased neuromuscular irritability. On physical examination, a Chvostek's sign (twitching of the circumoral muscles in response to gentle tapping of the facial nerve just anterior to the ear) may be elicited, although it is also present in ~10% of normal individuals. Carpal spasm may be induced by inflation of a blood pressure cuff to 20 mm. Hg above the patient's systolic blood pressure for 3 min (Trousseau's sign). Severe hypocalcemia can induce seizures, carpopedal spasm, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, and prolongation of the QT interval(harrison 18 pg 362)</p>",

Hence, the detection of substances that are more specific for carcinoid tumours can facilitate a more exact diagnosis. Two markers are primarily used to diagnose and follow carcinoid tumours: 5-hydroxy-indole-acetic acid (5-hiaa) and chromogranin A (CgA). Serotonin released by carcinoid tumours is metabolized by monoamine oxidases in the liver, lungs, and brain to 5-hiaa. When measured in a 24-hour urine sample, 5-hiaa level has a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 100% for diagnosing carcinoid. The normal range for urinary 5-hiaa is 3-15 mg/24 h, but the figure may vary depending on the laboratory. Chromogranin A is found in the wall of synaptic vesicles that store serotonin and glucagons. Levels of CgA tend to correlate with tumour bulk but not with symptoms. In general, CgA levels are elevated in 85%-100% of patients with carcinoid tumour, regardless of whether the tumour is functional or nonfunctional. Ref - pubmed. com",

The elevation of circulating hormone usually leads to hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. There is great variation in the manifestations. Patients may present with multiple signs and symptoms, including recurrent nephrolithiasis, peptic ulcers, mental changes, and, less frequently, extensive bone resorption. However, with greater awareness of the disease and wider use of multiphasic screening tests, including measurements of blood calcium, the diagnosis is frequently made in patients who have no symptoms and minimal, if any, signs of the disease other than hypercalcemia and elevated levels of PTH. The manifestations may be subtle, and the disease may have a benign course for many years or a lifetime. This milder form of the disease is usually termed asymptomatic HPT. Rarely, hyperparathyroidism develops or worsens abruptly and causes severe complications such as marked dehydration and coma, so-called hypercalcemic parathyroid crisis. The annual incidence of the disease is calculated to be as high as 0. 2% in patients >60, with an estimated prevalence, including undiscovered asymptomatic patients, of >=1%; some repos suggest the incidence may be declining. If confirmed, these changing estimates may reflect less frequent routine testing of serum calcium in recent years, earlier overestimates in incidence, or unknown factors. The disease has a peak incidence between the third and fifth decades but occurs in young children and in the elderly. (harrison 18 pg 3100)</p>",

The elevation of circulating hormone usually leads to hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Hypercalcemia in vitamin D intoxication is due to an excessive biologic action of the vitamin, perhaps the consequence of increased levels of 25(OH)D rather than merely increased levels of the active metabolite 1, 25(OH) 2 D (the latter may not be elevated in vitamin D intoxication). 25(OH)D has definite, if low, biologic activity in the intestine and bone. The production of 25(OH)D is less tightly regulated than is the production of 1, 25(OH) 2 D. Hence concentrations of 25(OH)D are elevated severalfold in patients with excess vitamin D intake. The diagnosis is substantiated by documenting elevated levels of 25(OH)D >100 mg/mL. Hypercalcemia is usually controlled by restriction of dietary calcium intake and appropriate attention to hydration. These measures, plus discontinuation of vitamin D, usually lead to resolution of hypercalcemia. However, vitamin D stores in fat may be substantial, and vitamin D intoxication may persist for weeks after vitamin D ingestion is terminated. Such patients are responsive to glucocoicoids, which in doses of 100 mg/d of hydrocoisone or its equivalent usually return serum calcium levels to normal over several days; severe intoxication may require intensive therapy(harrison 18 pg 3108)</p>",

They may also be seen in thyrotoxicosis, patients with rheumatoid ahritis, receiving estrogen therapy and women on oral contraceptives. In adults, spider nevi are usually seen over the face, neck, and upper pa of the trunk, and arms (vascular territory of the superior vena cava). It is unusual to find them below a line joining the nipples. They vary in size from 1 to 2 mm in diameter. It comprises a central aeriole represented by a red point from which numerous, small, twisted vessels radiate. Application of pressure on the central aeriole with the head of a pin or a match stick causes blanching of the whole lesion. Vascular spiders have been attributed to excessive levels of estrogen which cause blood vessels to enlarge and dilate.

Insulin glargine (15 units subcutaneously at bedtime) has recently been started because of a hemoglobin A1C level of 8. 4. Over the weekend, she develops nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea after exposure to family members with a similar illness. Afraid of hypoglycemia, the patient omits the insulin for 3 nights. Over the next 24 hours, she develops lethargy and is brought to the emergency room. On examination, she is afebrile and unresponsive to verbal command. Blood pressure is 84/52. Skin turgor is poor and mucous membranes dry. Neurological examination is nonfocal; she does not have neck rigidity. Laboratory results are as follows: Na: 126 m. Eq/LK: 4. 0 m. Eq/LCl: 95 m. Eq/LHCO3: 22 m. Eq/LGlucose: 1100 mg/d. LBUN: 84 mg/d. LCreatinine: 3. 0 mg/d. LWhich of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's coma?",
        "exp": "This woman with poorly controlled diabetes has developed hyperglycemia and lethargy during an episode suggestive of viral gastroenteritis. Her presentation is most consistent with hyperosmolar nonketotic state. This condition typically occurs in type 2 diabetics who become volume depleted and develop renal insufficiency. Glucose is no longer able to spill out into the urine, the blood glucose skyrockets, and severe hypertonicity leads to brain dysfunction and coma. Serum osmolarity is calculated by the formula: 18. Plasmaglucose +2(Na++K+)+2. 8bloodureanitrogen This patient's serum osmolarity is as follows: 181100 +(126+4)+2. 884 =61+260+30=351. Thus, the serum osmolarity is greater than 350 m. Osm/L. Although the serum sodium is usually the main determinant of osmolarity, extreme hyperglycemia contributes significantly to this patient's hypertonicity. Osmotically active particles in the extracellular fluid space pull water out of the intracellular space. This causes cellular dehydration in the brain and consequently the patient's CNS changes. Diabetic ketoacidosis would be associated with a much lower serum bicarbonate level and with an elevated anion gap. This patient's anion gap is 9 m. Eq/L (126-), which is well within the normal range. This patient's hyponatremia is minimal and is related to the osmotic effects of hyperglycemia. Patients with SIADH have an inappropriate production of ADH, leading to water retention and consequent hypotonicity (not hypertonicity, as in this case). The diagnosis of SIADH or drug-induced hyponatremia cannot be made in the setting of severe hypovolemia. Although the oral hypoglycemic chlorpropamide can cause drug-induced hyponatremia, this patient was not taking a sulfonylurea. Although meningitis can be associated with hyponatremia, this patient's hypertonicity and lack of meningeal signs point toward hyperosmolar nonketotic state as the cause of her illness.",

In the following weeks she develops increasing fatigue, dry skin, and constipation and her internist finds her TSH to be 25. She is in sinus rhythm. What is the best approach in this situation?",
        "exp": "Amiodarone is a widely used antiarrhythmic drug. It is related structurally to thyroid hormone and is stored in adipose tissue. The drug has a high iodine content as well. Taking amiodarone on an ongoing basis can lead to hypothyroidism by inhibiting deiodinase activity and by acting as a direct antagonist to T4. In some cases, amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism resolves within a few months; however, in many, especially when accompanying anti-TPO antibodies are present, treatment with levothyroxine is needed. This can be easily monitored and adjusted. While answer a is a consideration, the patient likely needs the amiodarone given her tendency toward paroxysms of atrial fibrillation and the attendant risk of stroke. While starting a beta-blocker may prevent episodes of rapid ventricular response, this decision would be made with the help of her cardiologist, which is not mentioned. Anti-TPO antibodies increase the risk of hypothyroidism but are not necessary to guide therapy in this patient. Although prednisone may be used for treatment of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism, this patient has hypothyroidism, and prednisone is not indicated.",

        "question": "Adrenal aldosteronoma is best diagnosed by -",
        "exp": "Ans is option 1 HRCT The usual screening test is to measure the serum potassium level. If it is low, diagnostic tests are done including measuring blood and urinary aldosterone levels and blood renin levels. In Conn's syndrome, the aldosterone is elevated and the renin is suppressed. If these tests are diagnostic then imaging studies are done to see if a tumor can be localized. Since these tumors are small they can be hard to find even with the best CT or CT with contrast or MRI scan. Some patients may have no obvious radiographic tumor but one adrenal is affected (unilateral primary adrenal hyperplasia) and they can benefit from surgical removal. Other patients may have both adrenals affected with no visible tumor (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism) and surgery will not help. In these situations blood has to be drawn from each adrenal vein (so called adrenal venous sampling) in order to measure aldosterone levels to be sure which adrenal has the tumor. The symptoms of hyperaldosteronism may resemble other conditions or medical problems. Always consult your physician for a diagnosis. the diagnostic procedures for aldosteronoma may include: Blood and urine tests to measure potassium and hormone levels Computed tomography (CT or CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - are non-invasive procedures that take cross-sectional images of the adrenal or other internal organs; to detect any abnormalities that may not show up on an ordinary x-ray Adrenal venous sampling- an invasive test performed by a radiologist where a catheter is placed in the adrenal veins to measure the hormone level and confirms the tumor location.
