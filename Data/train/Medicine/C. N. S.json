The facial nucleus, which is located within the pons, is divided in half, the upper neurons innervate the upper muscles of the face, while the lower neurons innervate the lower poion of the face. It is impoant to realize that each half receives input from the contralateral motor coex, while only the upper half receives input from the ipsilateral motor coex. Therefore an upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion will produce a defect involving only the contralateral lower half of the face. Causes of UMN lesions involving the facial nerve includes strokes that involve the coex or the internal capsule. In contrast, lesions that affect the facial nerve from the facial nucleus to the remaining length of the nerve result in LMN lesions.

Given case repos on liver injuries after ceain antiviral agent treatments, this study examined the effects of lamivudine on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin (TB) using a medical system database Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2675 Lamivudine has been used for treatment of chronic hepatitis B at a lower dose than for treatment of HIV/AIDS. It improves the seroconversion of e-antigen positive hepatitis B and also improves histology staging of the liver. Long-term use of lamivudine leads to emergence of a resistant hepatitis B virus (YMDD) mutant. Despite this, lamivudine is still used widely as it is well tolerated Lamivudine, commonly called 3. TC, is an antiretroviral medication used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. It is also used to treat chronic hepatitis B when other options are not possible. It is effective against both HIV-1 and HIV-2. It is typically used in combination with other antiretrovirals such as zidovudine and abacavir. Lamivudine may be included as pa of post-exposure prevention in those who have been potentially exposed to HIV. Lamivudine is taken by mouth as a liquid or tablet HIV, high level resistance is associated with the M184V/I mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene as repoed by Raymond Schinazi's group at Emory University. Glaxo. Smith. Kline claimed that the M184V mutation reduces \"viral fitness\", because of the finding that continued lamivudine treatment causes the HIV viral load to rebound but at a much lower level, and that withdrawal of lamivudine results in a higher viral load rebound with rapid loss of the M184V mutation; GSK therefore argued that there may be benefit in continuing lamivudine treatment even in the presence of high level resistance, because the resistant virus is \"less fit\". The COLATE study has suggested that there is no benefit to continuing lamivudine treatment in patients with lamivudine resistance. A better explanation of the data is that lamivudine continues to have a paial anti-viral effect even in the presence of the M184V mutation. In hepatitis B, lamivudine resistance was first described in the YMDD (tyrosine-methionine-aspaate-aspaate) locus of the HBV reverse transcriptase gene. The HBV reverse transcriptase gene is 344 amino acids long and occupies codons 349 to 692 on the viral genome. The most commonly encountered resistance mutations are M204V/I/S. The change in amino acid sequence from YMDD to YIDD results in a 3. 2 fold reduction in the error rate of the reverse transcriptase, which correlates with a significant growth disadvantage of the virus. Other resistance mutations are L80V/I, V173L and L180M Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 768",

A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically Connective tissue theory Various scientists and physicians have suggested that SCSFLS may be the result of an underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura It may also run in families and be associated with aoic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common connective tissue disorders associated with SCSFLS.] Roughly 20% of patients with SCSFLS exhibit features of Marfan syndrome, including tall stature, hollowed chest (pectus excavatum), joint hypermobility and arched palate. However, these patients do not exhibit any other Marfan syndrome presentations. Spinal drainage theory Some studies have proposed that issues with the spinal venous drainage system may cause a CSF leak. According to this theory, dural holes and intracranial hypotension are symptoms caused by low venous pressure in the epidural space. When inferior limb muscles pump blood towards the hea and pressure in the inferior vena cava vein becomes negative, the network of epidural veins is overdrained, causing CSF to be aspirated into the epidural space. True leaks can form at weak points in the spinal meninges. Therefore, the observed CSF hypotension is a result of CSF hypovolemia and reduced epidural venous pressure. Other causes Cranial CSF leaks result from intracranial hypertension in a vast majority of cases. The increased pressure causes a rupture of the cranial dura mater, leading to CSF leak and intracranial hypotension.] Patients with a nude nerve root, where the root sleeve is absent, are at increased risk for developing recurrent CSF leaks.] Lumbar disc herniation has been repoed to cause CSF leaks in at least one case.

        "exp": "The mitochondrial creatine kinase (CKm) is present in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where it regenerates phosphocreatine (PCr) from mitochondrially generated ATP and creatine (Cr) impoed from the cytosol. Apa from the two mitochondrial CK isoenzyme forms, that is, ubiquitous mt. CK (present in non-muscle tissues) and sarcomeric mt. CK (present in sarcomeric muscle), there are three cytosolic CK isoforms present in the cytosol, depending on the tissue. Whereas MM-CK is expressed in sarcomeric muscle, that is, skeletal and cardiac muscle, MB-CK is expressed in cardiac muscle, and BB-CK is expressed in smooth muscle and in most non-muscle tissues. Mitochondrial mt. CK and cytosolic CK are connected in a so-called PCr/Cr-shuttle or circuit. PCr generated by mt. CK in mitochondria is shuttled to cytosolic CK that is coupled to ATP-dependent processes, e. g. ATPases, such as acto-myosin ATPase and calcium ATPase involved in muscle contraction, and sodium/potassium ATPase involved in sodium retention in the kidney. The bound cytosolic CK accepts the PCr shuttled through the cell and uses ADP to regenerate ATP, which can then be used as energy source by the ATPases (CK is associated intimately with the ATPases, forming a functionally coupled microcompament). PCr is not only an energy buffer but also a cellular transpo form of energy between subcellular sites of energy (ATP) production (mitochondria and glycolysis) and those of energy utilization (ATPases). Thus, CK enhances skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle contractility, and is involved in the generation of blood pressure Finally, high CK in the blood may be an indication of damage to CK-rich tissue, such as in rhabdomyolysis, myocardial infarction, myositis and myocarditis. This means creatine kinase in blood may be elevated in a wide range of clinical conditions including the use of medication such as statins; endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism; and skeletal muscle diseases and disorders including malignant hypehermia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2567",

        "question": "Causes of acute flaccid paralysis",
        "exp": "The term acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) is often used to describe a sudden onset, as might be found with polio. AFP is the most common sign of acute polio, and used for surveillance during polio outbreaks. AFP is also associated with a number of other pathogenic agents including enteroviruses other than polio, echoviruses, West Nile virus, and adenoviruses, among others. Botulism The Clostridium botulinum bacteria are the cause of botulism. Vegetative cells of C. botulinum may be ingested. Introduction of the bacteria may also occur endospores in a wound. When the bacteria are in vivo, they induce flaccid paralysis. This happens because C. botulinum produces a toxin which blocks the release of acetylcholine. Botulism toxin blocks the exocytosis of presynaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine (ACh). When this occurs, the muscles are unable to contract. Other symptoms associated with infection from this neurotoxin include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. Botulism prevents muscle contraction by blocking the release of acetylcholine, thereby halting postsynaptic activity of the neuromuscular junction. If its effects reach the respiratory muscles, then it can lead to respiratory failure, leading to death. Curare Curare is a plant poison derived from - among other species - Chondrodendron tomentosum and various species belonging to the genus Strychnos, which are native to the rainforests of South America. Ceain peoples indigenous to the region - notably the Macusi - crush and cook the roots and stems of these and ceain other plants and then mix the resulting decoction with various other plant poisons and animal venoms to create a syrupy liquid in which to dip their arrow heads and the tips of their blowgun das. Curare has also been used medicinally by South Americans to treat madness, dropsy, edema, fever, kidney stones, and bruises. Curare acts as a neuromuscular blocking agent which induces flaccid paralysis. This poison binds to the acetylcholine (ACh) receptors on the muscle, blocking them from binding to ACh. As a result, ACh accumulates within the neuromuscular junction, but since ACh cannot bind to the receptors on the muscle, the muscle cannot be stimulated. This poison must enter the bloodstream for it to work. If curare affects the respiratory muscles, then its effects can become life-threatening, placing the victim at risk for suffocation. Other Flaccid paralysis can be associated with a lower motor neuron lesion. This is in contrast to an upper motor neuron lesion, which often presents with spasticity, although early on this may present with flaccid paralysis. Included in AFP's list are poliomyelitis (polio), transverse myelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, enteroviral encephalopathy] traumatic neuritis, Reye's syndrome, etc. An AFP surveillance programme is conducted to increase case yield of poliomyelitis. This includes collection of 2 stool samples within 14 days of onset of paralysis and identification of virus, and control of the outbreak and strengthening immunization in that area. Historical records from the 1950s, modern CDC repos, and recent analysis of patterns in India suggest that flaccid paralysis may be caused in some cases by oral polio vaccinations Venomous snakes that contain neurotoxic venom such as kraits, mambas, and cobras can also cause complete flaccid paralysis. Some chemical warfare nerve agents such as VX can also cause complete flaccid paralysis Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2234",

        "question": "Which of the following inhibits GH secretion from the anterior pituitary gland?",
        "exp": "Growth hormone, also known as somatotropin, is secreted by somatotroph cells, which account for 50% of the anterior pituitary glands. The release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary is pulsatile in nature, increasing after meals: with exercise, and during slow-wave sleep. Growth hormone, which is necessary for normal growth, exes its effects through mediators such as somatomedins and insulin-like growth factors. In addition to its involvement in growth, somatotropin is involved in stimulating the incorporation of amino acids into protein and inhibiting glucose uptake by tissues. By the latter effect, growth hormone helps restore low blood sugars to normal and is therefore a counterregulatory hormone to insulin. Both hypoglycemia and insulin stimulate growth hormone release, as does the presence of free amino acids such as arginine. Hypothalamic secretagogues also control growth hormone release. These molecules include the stimulatory hormone GHRH and the inhibitory hormone somatostatin (somatotropin release-inhibitory factor). The former is probably more impoant, since sectioning of the pathways between the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary results in inhibition of growth hormone release. Other neurotransmitters influence growth hormone release, including hypothalamus-derived dopamine, which stimulates GHRH. -Adrenergic agonists stimulate growth hormone release, and -adrenergic blockers inhibit growth hormone increases. Serotonin agonists stimulate growth hormone release; this perhaps accounts for the nocturnal surge in growth hormone secretion. Ref - Harrison's principles of internal medicine 20e pg 2666t",

Cerebrospinal fluid, which fills the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain, is normally clear and colorless. When there has been bleeding into the subarachnoid space, the initial appearance of the cerebrospinal fluid can range from barely tinged with blood to frankly bloody, depending on the extent of bleeding. Within several hours, the red blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid are destroyed, releasing their oxygen-carrying molecule heme, which is then metabolized by enzymes to bilirubin, a yellow pigment. The most common cause for bleeding into the subarachnoid space is a subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. The most frequently employed initial test for subarachnoid hemorrhage is a computed tomography scan of the head, but it detects only 98% of cases in the first 12 hours after the onset of symptoms, and becomes less useful afterwards. Therefore, a lumbar puncture (\"spinal tap\") is recommended to obtain cerebrospinal fluid if someone has symptoms of a subarachnoid hemorrhage (e. g., a thunderclap headache, vomiting, dizziness, new-onset seizures, confusion, a decreased level of consciousness or coma, neck stiffness or other signs of meningismus, and signs of sudden elevated intracranial pressure), but no blood is visible on the CT scan. According to one aicle, a spinal tap is not necessary if no blood is seen on a CT scan done using a third generation scanner within six hours of the onset of the symptoms. However, this is not standard of care. Heme from red blood cells that are in the cerebrospinal fluid because a blood vessel was nicked during the lumbar puncture (a \"traumatic tap\") has no time to be metabolized, and therefore no bilirubin is present. After the cerebrospinal fluid is obtained, a variety of its parameters can be checked, including the presence of xanthochromia.

Unsuppressed ADH causes an unrelenting increase in solute-free water being returned by the tubules of the kidney to the venous circulation non associated with thymoma The causes of SIADH are grouped into six categories: 1) central nervous system diseases that directly stimulate the hypothalamus, the site of control of ADH secretion; 2) various cancers that synthesize and secrete ectopic ADH; 3) various lung diseases; 4) numerous drugs that chemically stimulate the hypothalamus; 5) inherited mutations; and 6) miscellaneous largely transient conditions. ADH is derived from a preprohormone precursor that is synthesized in cells in the hypothalamus and stored in vesicles in the posterior pituitary. Appropriate ADH secretion is regulated by osmoreceptors on the hypothalamic cells that synthesize and store ADH: plasma hypeonicity activates these receptors, ADH is released into the blood stream, the kidney increases solute-free water return to the circulation, and the hypeonicity is alleted. Inappropriate (increased) ADH secretion causes an unrelenting increase in solute-free water (\"free water\") absorption by the kidneys, with two consequences. First, in the extracellular fluid (ECF) space, there is a dilution of blood solutes, causing hypoosmolality, including a low sodium concentration - hyponatremia. Then viually simultaneously, in the intracellular space, cells swell, i. e. intracellular volume increases. Swelling of brain cells causes various neurological abnormalities which in severe or acute cases can result in convulsions, coma, and death. Potential treatments of SIADH include restriction of fluid intake, correction of an identifiable reversible underlying cause, and/or medication which promotes solute-free water excretion by the kidney. The presence of cerebral edema may necessitate intravenous isotonic or hypeonic saline administration. SIADH was originally described in 1957 in two people with small-cell carcinoma of the lung.

Typically, patients present with severe pain in the low back, hip, and thigh in one leg. Rarely, the diabetic polyradiculoneuropathy begins in both legs at the same time. Atrophy and weakness of proximal and distal muscles in the affected leg become apparent within a few days or weeks. The neuropathy is often accompanied or heralded by severe weight loss. Weakness usually progresses over several weeks or months, but can continue to progress for 18 months or more. Subsequently, there is slow recovery but many are left with residual weakness, sensory loss, and pain. In contrast to the more typical lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy, some patients develop thoracic radiculopathy or, even less commonly, a cervical polyradiculoneuropathy. CSF protein is usually elevated, while the cell count is normal. ESR is often increased. EDx reveals evidence of active denervation in affected proximal and distal muscles in the affected limbs and in paraspinal muscles.

        "exp": "Amnesia is a deficit in memory caused by brain damage or disease, but it can also be caused temporarily by the use of various sedatives and hypnotic drugs. The memory can be either wholly or paially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused. There are two main types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a paicular date, usually the date of an accident or operation. In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from the sho-term store into the long-term store. People with this type of amnesia cannot remember things for long periods of time. These two types are not mutually exclusive; both can occur simultaneously People with amnesia can learn new information, paicularly non-declarative knowledge. However, some people with dense anterograde amnesia do not remember the episodes during which they previously learned or observed the information. Declarative information Some patients with anterograde amnesia can still acquire some semantic information, even though it might be more difficult and might remain rather unrelated to more general knowledge. H. M. could accurately draw a floor plan of the home in which he lived after surgery, even though he had not lived there in years. The reason patients could not form new episodic memories is likely because the CA1 region of the hippocampus was a lesion, and thus the hippocampus could not make connections to the coex. After an ischemic episode following surgery, an MRI of patient R. B. showed his hippocampus to be intact except for a specific lesion restricted to the CA1 pyramidal cells. Non-declarative information Some retrograde and anterograde amnesics are capable of non-declarative memory, including implicit learning and procedural learning. For example, some patients show improvement on the pseudorandom sequences experiment as healthy people do. Therefore, procedural learning can proceed independently of the brain system required for declarative memory. According to f. MRI studies, the acquisition of procedural memories activates the basal ganglia, the premotor coex and the supplementary motor area, regions which are not normally associated with the formation of declarative memories. This type of dissociation between declarative and procedural memory can also be found in patients with diencephalic amnesia such as Korsakoff's syndrome. Another example demonstrated by some patients, such as K. C. and H. M, who have medial temporal damage and anterograde amnesia, still have perceptual priming. Those patients did well in the word fragment completion test. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2134",

The onset is often asymmetric with dysesthesias and sensory loss in the limbs that soon progress to affect all limbs, the torso, and the face. Marked sensory ataxia, pseudoathetosis, and inability to walk, stand, or even sit unsuppoed are frequent features and are secondary to the extensive deafferentation. Subacute sensory neuronopathy may be idiopathic, but more than half of cases are paraneoplastic, primarily related to lung cancer, and most of those are small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Diagnosis of the underlying SCLC requires awareness of the association, testing for the paraneoplastic antibody, and often positron emission tomography (PET) scanning for the tumor. The target antigens are a family of RNA-binding proteins (HuD, HuC, and Hel-N1) that in normal tissues are only expressed by neurons. The same proteins are usually expressed by SCLC, triggering in some patients an immune response characterized by antibodies and cytotoxic T cells that cross-react with the Hu proteins of the dorsal root ganglion neurons, resulting in immune-mediated neuronal destruction",

        "exp": "Horner's syndrome, also known as oculosympathetic paresis] is a combination of symptoms that arises when a group of nerves known as the sympathetic trunk is damaged. The signs and symptoms occur on the same side (ipsilateral) as it is a lesion of the sympathetic trunk. It is characterized by miosis (a constricted pupil), paial ptosis (a weak, droopy eyelid), apparent anhydrosis (decreased sweating), with apparent enophthalmos (inseed eyeballs) Signs that are found in people with Horner's syndrome on the affected side of the face include the following: ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid) anhidrosis (decreased sweating) miosis (constriction of the pupil) sinking of the eyeball into the face inability to completely close or open the eyelid facial flushing headaches loss of ciliospinal reflex bloodshot conjunctiva, depending on the site of lesion. unilateral straight hair (in congenital Horner's syndrome); the hair on the affected side may be straight in some cases. heterochromia iridum (in congenital Horner's syndrome) Interruption of sympathetic pathways leads to several implications. It inactivates the dilator muscle and thereby produces miosis. It inactivates the superior tarsal muscle which produces ptosis. It reduces sweat secretion in the face. Patients may have apparent enophthalmos (affected eye looks to be slightly sunken in) but this is not the case. The ptosis from inactivation of the superior tarsal muscle causes the eye to appear sunken in, but when actually measured, enophthalmos is not present. The phenomenon of enophthalmos is seen in Horner's syndrome in cats, rats, and dogs. Sometimes there is flushing on the affected side of the face due to dilation of blood vessels under the skin. The pupil's light reflex is maintained as this is controlled the parasympathetic nervous system. In children, Horner's syndrome sometimes leads to heterochromia, a difference in eye color between the two eyes. This happens because a lack of sympathetic stimulation in childhood interferes with melanin pigmentation of the melanocytes in the superficial stroma of the iris. In veterinary medicine, signs can include paial closure of the third eyelid, or nictitating membrane. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2567",

Levodopa-induced motor complications consist of fluctuations in motor response and involuntary movements known as dyskinesias which typically complicate \"on\" periods. When patients initially take levodopa, benefits are long-lasting (many hours) even though the drug has a relatively sho half-life (60-90 min).

In most people with CJD, these symptoms are accompanied by involuntary movements and the appearance of an atypical, diagnostic electroencephalogram tracing. The duration of the disease varies greatly, but sporadic (non-inherited) CJD can be fatal within months or even weeks. Most victims die six months after initial symptoms appear, often of pneumonia due to impaired coughing reflexes. About 15% of people with CJD survive for two or more years. The symptoms of CJD are caused by the progressive death of the brain's nerve cells, which is associated with the build-up of abnormal prion protein molecules forming amyloids. When brain tissue from a person with CJD is examined under a microscope, many tiny holes can be seen where whole areas of nerve cells have died.

When it occurs, it is often three days into the withdrawal symptoms and lasts for two to three days. Physical effects may include shaking, shivering, irregular heart rate, and sweating. People may also see or hear things other people do not. Occasionally, a very high body temperature or seizures may result in death. Alcohol is one of the most dangerous drugs from which to withdraw The main symptoms of delirium tremens are nightmares, agitation, global confusion, disorientation, visual and auditory hallucinations, tactile hallucinations, fever, high blood pressure, heavy sweating, and other signs of autonomic hyperactivity (fast heart rate and high blood pressure). These symptoms may appear suddenly, but typically develop two to three days after the stopping of heavy drinking, being worst on the fouh or fifth day. Also, these \"symptoms are characteristically worse at night\". In general, DT is considered the most severe manifestation of alcohol withdrawal and occurs 3-10 days following the last drink. Other common symptoms include intense perceptual disturbance such as visions of insects, snakes, or rats. These may be hallucinations or illusions related to the environment, e. g., patterns on the wallpaper or in the peripheral vision that the patient falsely perceives as a resemblance to the morphology of an insect, and are also associated with tactile hallucinations such as sensations of something crawling on the subject--a phenomenon known as formication. Delirium tremens usually includes extremely intense feelings of \"impending doom\". Severe anxiety and feelings of imminent death are common DT symptoms. DT can sometimes be associated with severe, uncontrollable tremors of the extremities and secondary symptoms such as anxiety, panic attacks and paranoia. Confusion is often noticeable to onlookers as those with DT will have trouble forming simple sentences or making basic logical calculations. DT should be distinguished from alcoholic hallucinosis, the latter of which occurs in approximately 20% of hospitalized alcoholics and does not carry a significant moality. In contrast, DT occurs in 5-10% of alcoholics and carries up to 15% moality with treatment and up to 35% moality without treatment. DT is characterized by the presence of altered sensorium; that is, a complete hallucination without any recognition of the real world. DT has extreme autonomic hyperactivity (high pulse, blood pressure, and rate of breathing), and 35-60% of patients have a fever. Some patients experience seizures Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2345",

Oligodendrocytes are small, round, lymphocyte-size cells that produce and maintain CNS myelin, which is primarily located in the white matter. Ceain diseases, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, caused by a papovavirus, specifically attack oligodendrocytes and produce demyelination. Oligodendrogliomas are malignant tumors that are derived from oligodendrocytes. However, unlike Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes contribute segments of myelin sheaths to more than one axon. Gemistocytes are reactive astrocytes that have an eosinophilic cytoplasm. They are commonly seen along the periphery of cerebral infarctions. Some astrocytomas have a gemistocytic appearance. Astrocytes provide the structural framework for the neurons and are analogous to the fibroblasts in connective tissue. However, scarring in the brain is not associated with collagen synthesis but with filling in the defect with the cellular processes of astrocytes. A cerebral abscess is the only example of CNS repair with collagen, which is derived from the blood vessels. Microglial cells are derived from monocytes. They are the phagocytic cell of the CNS. Ependymal cells line the ventricles of the brain and the spinal canal. They do not produce CSF nor are they responsible for reabsorption of CSF, a function relegated to arachnoid cells.

Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is a diverse group of disorders with many subtypes categorized by disease gene and inheritance. LGMD usually manifests in the proximal muscles around the hips and shoulders. (The proximal muscles are those closest to the center of the body; distal muscles are faher away from the center -- for example, in the hands and feet). The shoulder girdle is the bony structure that surrounds the shoulder area, and the pelvic girdle is the bony structure surrounding the hips. Collectively, these are called the limb girdles, and it is the observed weakness and atrophy (wasting) of the muscles connected to the limb girdles that has given this group of disorders its name. Weakness in the shoulder area may make reaching over the head, holding the arms outstretched, or carrying heavy objects difficult. It may become increasingly hard to keep the arms above the head for such activities as combing one's hair or arranging things on a high shelf. Some people find it harder to type on a computer or other keyboard and may even have trouble feeding themselves. Some of the LGMD subtypes also are characterized by additional symptoms. For example, the hea can be affected in some types of LGMD, with weakness of the hea muscle (cardiomyopathy) and/or abnormal transmission of signals that regulate the heabeat (conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias). Some disease subtypes also involve the muscles used for breathing, and for that reason, respiratory function, along with cardiac function, should be monitored regularly.

Other impairments, though, can at first seem completely non-related to the limb weakness but are, in fact, a direct result of the damage to the affected side of the brain.

This makes performing everyday activities such as dressing, eating, grabbing objects, or using the bathroom more difficult.

An estimated 150, 000 people in the United States have a diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia at any given time. SCA is hereditary, progressive, degenerative, and often fatal. There is no known effective treatment or cure. SCA can affect anyone of any age. The disease is caused by either a recessive or dominant gene. In many cases people are not aware that they carry a relevant gene until they have children who begin to show signs of having the disorder The hereditary ataxias are categorized by mode of inheritance and causative gene or chromosomal locus. The hereditary ataxias can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked manner. Many types of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias for which specific genetic information is available are now known. Synonyms for autosomal-dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) used prior to the current understanding of the molecular genetics were Marie's ataxia, inherited olivopontocerebellar atrophy, cerebello-olivary atrophy, or the more generic term \"spinocerebellar degeneration. \" (Spinocerebellar degeneration is a rare inherited neurological disorder of the central nervous system characterized by the slow degeneration of ceain areas of the brain. There are three forms of spinocerebellar degeneration: Types 1, 2, 3. Symptoms begin during adulthood.) There are five typical autosomal-recessive disorders in which ataxia is a prominent feature: Friedreich ataxia, ataxia-telangiectasia, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (AOA), spastic ataxia.

        "exp": "The Watson-Schwaz test for porphobilinogen is an excellent, simple screening procedure for porphyria and ceainly its use should be considered in any patient with a history of abdominal pain, constipation, obscure neurological disorder, mental disturbance, multiple abdominal operations, or dark urine. The porphyrias are a group of inherited disorders of porphyrin metabolism manifested chemically by an increased excretion of the porphyrins and their precursors or both. Porphyrins are normally synthesized from glycine and succinic acid which combine to yield a-amino-b-ketoadiptic acid. Decarboxylation results in d-aminolevulinic acid. Two molecules of d-aminolevulinic acid condense, forming the monopyrolle, porphobilinogen. Four molecules of porphobilinogen condense producing the various tetrapyrolle porphyrinogens (copro-, uro-, protoporphyrinogen), the reduced, colorless precursors of the porphyrins. 1 Porphyrins linked to metal and protein constitute the impoant biological compounds: hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochrome, and catalase. Carbohydrate administration Often, empirical treatment is required if the diagnostic suspicion of a porphyria is high since acute attacks can be fatal. A high-carbohydrate diet is typically recommended; in severe attacks, a dextrose 10% infusion is commenced, which may aid in recovery by suppressing heme synthesis, which in turn reduces the rate of porphyrin accumulation. However, this can worsen hyponatraemia and should be done with extreme caution as it can prove fatal. Heme analogs Hematin (trade name Panhematin) and heme arginate (trade name Normo. Sang) are the drugs of choice in acute porphyria, in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. These drugs need to be given very early in an attack to be effective; effectiveness varies amongst individuals. They are not curative drugs but can shoen attacks and reduce the intensity of an attack. Side effects are rare but can be serious. These heme-like substances theoretically inhibit ALA synthase and hence the accumulation of toxic precursors. In the United Kingdom, supplies of Normo. Sang are kept at two national centers; emergency supply is available from St Thomas's Hospital, London. In the United States, Lundbeck manufactures and supplies Panhematin for infusion. Heme arginate (Normo. Sang) is used during crises but also in preventive treatment to avoid crises, one treatment every 10 days. Any sign of low blood sodium (hyponatremia) or weakness should be treated with the addition of hematin, heme arginate, or even tin mesoporphyrin, as these are signs of impending syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) or peripheral nervous system involvement that may be localized or severe, progressing to bulbar paresis and respiratory paralysis Cimetidine Cimetidine has also been repoed to be effective for acute porphyric crisis and possibly effective for long-term prophylaxis. Symptom control Pain is severe, frequently out of propoion to physical signs, and often requires the use of opiates to reduce it to tolerable levels. Pain should be treated as early as medically possible. Nausea can be severe; it may respond to phenothiazine drugs but is sometimes intractable. Hot baths and showers may lessen nausea temporarily, though caution should be used to avoid burns or falls. Early identification It is recommended that patients with a history of acute porphyria, and even genetic carriers, wear an ale bracelet or other identification at all times. This is in case they develop severe symptoms, or in case of accidents where there is a potential for drug exposure, and as a result they are unable to explain their condition to healthcare professionals. Some drugs are absolutely contraindicated for patients with any form of porphyria. Neurologic and psychiatric disorders Patients who experience frequent attacks can develop chronic neuropathic pain in extremities as well as chronic pain in the abdomen. Intestinal pseudo-obstruction, ileus, intussusception, hypoganglionosis, and encopresis in children have been associated with porphyrias. This is thought to be due to axonal nerve deterioration in affected areas of the nervous system and vagal nerve dysfunction. Pain treatment with long-acting opioids, such as morphine, is often indicated, and, in cases where seizure or neuropathy is present, Gabapentin is known to improve outcome. Seizures often accompany this disease. Most seizure medications exacerbate this condition. Treatment can be problematic: barbiturates especially must be avoided. Some benzodiazepines are safe and, when used in conjunction with newer anti-seizure medications such as gabapentin, offer a possible regimen for seizure control. Gabapentin has the additional feature of aiding in the treatment of some kinds of neuropathic pain. Magnesium sulfate and bromides have also been used in porphyria seizures; however, development of status epilepticus in porphyria may not respond to magnesium alone. The addition of hematin or heme arginate has been used during status epilepticus. Depression often accompanies the disease and is best dealt with by treating the offending symptoms and if needed the judicious use of antidepressants. Some psychotropic drugs are porphyrinogenic, limiting the therapeutic scope. Other psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, depression, mania, hallucinations, delusions, confusion, catatonia, and psychosis may occur. Underlying liver disease Some liver diseases may cause porphyria even in the absence of genetic predisposition. These include hemochromatosis and hepatitis C. Treatment of iron overload may be required. Patients with the acute porphyrias (AIP, HCP, VP) are at increased risk over their life for hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) and may require monitoring. Other typical risk factors for liver cancer need not be present. Hormone treatment Hormonal fluctuations that contribute to cyclical attacks in women have been treated with oral contraceptives and luteinizing hormones to shut down menstrual cycles. However, oral contraceptives have also triggered photosensitivity and withdrawal of oral contracetives has triggered attacks. Androgens and feility hormones have also triggered attacks.

        "exp": "Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system.] The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands] This often spreads to the arms and upper body, with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening, with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure The nerve dysfunction in Guillain-Barre syndrome is caused by an immune attack on the nerve cells of the peripheral nervous system and their suppo structures. The nerve cells have their body (the soma) in the spinal cord and a long projection (the axon) that carries electrical nerve impulses to the neuromuscular junction where the impulse is transferred to the muscle. Axons are wrapped in a sheath of Schwann cells that contain myelin. Between Schwann cells are gaps (nodes of Ranvier) where the axon is exposed. Different types of Guillain-Barre syndrome feature different types of immune attack. The demyelinating variant (AIDP, see below) features damage to the myelin sheath by white blood cells (T lymphocytes and macrophages); this process is preceded by activation of a group of blood proteins known as complement. In contrast, the axonal variant is mediated by IgG antibodies and complement against the cell membrane covering the axon without direct lymphocyte involvement. Various antibodies directed at nerve cells have been repoed in Guillain-Barre syndrome. In the axonal subtype, these antibodies have been shown to bind to gangliosides, a group of substances found in peripheral nerves. A ganglioside is a molecule consisting of ceramide bound to a small group of hexose-type sugars and containing various numbers of N-acetylneuraminic acid groups. The key four gangliosides against which antibodies have been described are GM1, GD1a, GT1a, and GQ1b, with different anti-ganglioside antibodies being associated with paicular features; for instance, GQ1b antibodies have been linked with Miller Fisher variant GBS and related forms including Bickerstaff encephalitis] The production of these antibodies after an infection is probably the result of molecular mimicry, where the immune system is reacting to microbial substances, but the resultant antibodies also react with substances occurring naturally in the body. [After a Campylobacter infection, the body produces antibodies of the IgA class; only a small propoion of people also produce IgG antibodies against bacterial substance cell wall substances (e. g. lipooligosaccharides) that crossreact with human nerve cell gangliosides. It is not currently known how this process escapes central tolerance to gangliosides, which is meant to suppress the production of antibodies against the body's own substances. Not all antiganglioside antibodies cause disease, and it has recently been suggested that some antibodies bind to more than one type of epitope simultaneously (heterodimeric binding) and that this determines the response. Fuhermore, the development of pathogenic antibodies may depend on the presence of other strains of bacteria in the bowel Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2234",

The secondary somatosensory coex (SII; area 40) is in the lower parietal lobe Somatosensory Coex Primary somatosensory coex (SI; areas 3, 1, 2) is located in the post central gyrus. This receives somatotopic input from the VPL and VPM of the thalamus. Histologically, this area would consist of granular coex. The sensory homunculus includes coical representation of the body based on the degree of sensory innervation. There are actually four submaps, one each in area 3a, 3b, 1 and 2. Very sensitive areas such as the lips and the fingeips have a huge representation. Neurons within each coical site (paicularly layer IV) are arranged in columns representing specific body regions. If a region is amputated (such as a finger) there is reorganization with neurons responding to stimulation of adjacent body pas. This can also happen as the result of increased use of a body pa. Damage to the sensory coex results in decreased sensory thresholds, an inability to discriminate the propeies of tactile stimuli or to identify objects by touch. but the pain sensation is less effected. The secondary somatosensory coex (SII; area 40) is in the lower parietal lobe. This receives connections from the primary sensory coex and also less specific thalamic nuclei. This responds to sensory stimuli bilaterally, although with much less precision than the primary coex. Nonetheless, lesions to this area may impair some elements of sensory discrimination. The somatosensory association coex (areas 5 and 7) is directly posterior to the sensory coex in the superior parietal lobes. This receives synthesized connections from the primary and secondary sensory coices. These neurons respond to several types of inputs and are involved in complex associations. Damage can affect the ability to recognize objects even though the objects can be felt (tactile agnosia). Coical damage, paicularly in the area of coex where the posterior parietal lobe meets the anterior occipital and the posterior, superior temporal lobe, can cause neglect of the contralateral side of the world. This typically happens with nondominant hemisphere lesions since this hemisphere appears necessary to distribute attention to both sides of the body. The dominant hemisphere appears to only \"pay attention\" to the associated (usually right) side of the world. Therefore, neglect usually involves the left side and can be so severe that the individual even denies that their left side belongs to them. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2456",

The VDRL test is used to screen for syphilis (it has high sensitivity), whereas other, more specific tests are used to diagnose the disease. The VDRL is a nontreponemal serological screening for syphilis that is also used to assess response to therapy, to detect central nervous system involvement, and as an aid in the diagnosis of congenital syphilis. The basis of the test is that an antibody produced by a patient with syphilis reacts with an extract of ox hea (diphosphatidyl glycerol). It therefore detects anti-cardiolipin antibodies (IgG, IgM or IgA), visualized through foaming of the test tube fluid, or \"flocculation\". The rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test uses the same antigen as the VDRL, but in that test, it has been bound to several other molecules, including a carbon paicle to allow visualization of the flocculation reaction without the need of a microscope. Many other medical conditions can produce false positive results, including some viruses (mononucleosis, hepatitis), drugs, pregnancy, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid ahritis, lupus, and leprosy. The syphilis anti-cardiolipin antibodies are beta-2 glycoprotein independent, whereas those that occur in the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (associated to lupus for example) are beta-2 glycoprotein dependent, and this can be used to tell them apa in an ELISA assay. This test is very useful as the trend of titres are correlated to disease activity (i. e. falling titres indicate successful treatment).

        "exp": ". Noncontrast head CT (NCCT) is the standard radiologic test for patients presenting with acute stroke. Early ischemic changes (EIC) are often overlooked on initial NCCT. We determine the sensitivity and specificity of improved EIC detection by a standardized method of image evaluation (Stroke Windows). Methods. We performed a retrospective cha review to identify patients with acute ischemic stroke who had NCCT at presentation. EIC was defined by the presence of hyperdense MCA/basilar aery sign; sulcal effacement; basal ganglia/subcoical hypodensity; and loss of coical gray-white differentiation. NCCT was reviewed with standard window settings and with specialized Stroke Windows. Specific features relevant to stroke assessment include hyperdense middle cerebral aery (MCA)/basilar signs, focal parenchymal hypoattenuation (notably of the insular ribbon or lenticular nuclei for MCA infarcts), and cerebral swelling manifested by sulcal or ventricular effacement or loss of coical grey-white differentiation. Decreases in CT attenuation accompanying early stroke are small; therefore, their conspicuity may be increased by using narrow window settings centered at approximately the mean attenuation in HUs of gray and white matter. We believe that the increase in lesion conspicuity achieved with this method can improve the accuracy of nonenhanced CT stroke detection. In most academic stroke centers, on-call residents, radiologists, and ED physicians are the first providers to interpret NCCT in the setting of suspected acute ischemic stroke. We hypothesize that detection of EIC can be improved by a standardized method of image evaluation that can be implemented by the treating physicians Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2234",

        "exp": "Glioblastoma, also known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most aggressive cancer that begins within the brain. Initially, signs and symptoms of glioblastoma are nonspecific. Uncommon risk factors include genetic disorders, such as neurofibromatosis and Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and previous radiation therapy. Glioblastomas represent 15% of brain tumors. They can either sta from normal brain cells or develop from an existing low-grade astrocytoma. The diagnosis typically is made by a combination of CT scan, MRI scan, and tissue biopsy. No clear way to prevent the disease is known. Typically, treatment involves surgery, after which chemotherapy and radiation therapy are used. The medication temozolomide is used frequently as pa of chemotherapy. High-dose steroids may be used to help reduce swelling and decrease symptoms. Whether trying to remove all or simply most of the cancer is better is unknown. Despite maximum treatment, the cancer usually recurs. The tumor may extend into the meninges or ventricular wall, leading to high protein content in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (> 100 mg/dl), as well as an occasional pleocytosis of 10 to 100 cells, mostly lymphocytes. Malignant cells carried in the CSF may spread (rarely) to the spinal cord or cause meningeal gliomatosis. However, metastasis of GBM beyond the central nervous system is extremely unusual. About 50% of GBMs occupy more than one lobe of a hemisphere or are bilateral. Tumors of this type usually arise from the cerebrum and may exhibit the classic infiltration across the corpus callosum, producing a butterfly (bilateral) glioma. The tumor may take on a variety of appearances, depending on the amount of hemorrhage, necrosis, or its age. A CT scan usually shows an inhomogeneous mass with a hypodense center and a variable ring of enhancement surrounded by edema. Mass effect from the tumor and edema may compress the ventricles and cause hydrocephalus. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2234 Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 1123",

This disorder has three general features: the fluctuating nature of muscle weakness, predominant involvement of ocular muscles (with diplopia and ptosis), and positive clinical response to administration of cholinergic agents. Crisis of weakness involving respiratory muscles was the most frequent cause of death before the advent of positive pressure respirators. The disease is autoimmune-mediated and results from autoantibodies to the muscular nicotinic receptors. Besides the pharmacologic test, a progressive decrease in the amplitude of muscle potential is the diagnostic feature of myasthenia gravis. Electromyography is therefore very useful in the diagnosis of this condition. Blood, urine, and CSF analysis are entirely within normal limits in myasthenia gravis, although they are indeed frequently performed in the initial screening. MRI of the head and EEG recording would be entirely useless in this setting. Since the disorder is due to impaired cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction, skeletal muscle biopsy is within normal limits at the light microscopic level.

A patient suffering from myasthenia gravis experiences improvement in muscle strength and endurance with repetitive movements, while normal persons do not feel any difference. The effects of edrophonium lasts around 10 minutes. The edrophonium allows accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh) in the neuromuscular junctions, and makes more ACh available to the muscle receptors, thereby increasing muscle strength in myasthenia gravis.

        "exp": "Dissociated sensory loss is a pattern of neurological damage caused by a lesion to a single tract in the spinal cord which involves preservation of fine touch and proprioception with selective loss of pain and temperature. Understanding the mechanisms behind these selective lesions requires a brief discussion of the anatomy involved. Loss of pain and temperature are due to damage to the lateral spinothalamic tracts, which cross the central pa of the cord close to the level where they enter it and travel up the spinal column on the opposite side to the one they innervate (i. e. they ascend contralaterally). Note that a lesion of the lateral spinothalamic tract at a given level will not result in sensory loss for the dermatome of the same level; this is due to the fibers of the tract of Lissauer which transmit the neuron one or two levels above the affected segment (thus bypassing the segmental lesion on the contralateral side). Loss of fine touch and proprioception are due to damage to the dorsal columns, which do not cross the cord until the brainstem, and so travel up the column on the same side to the one they innervate (i. e. they ascend ipsilaterally). This means that a lesion of the dorsal columns will cause loss of touch and proprioception below the lesion and on the same side as it, while a lesion of the spinothalamic tracts will cause loss of pain and temperature below the lesion and on the opposite side to it. Dissociated sensory loss always suggests a focal lesion within the spinal cord or brainstem. The location of cord lesions affects presentation--for instance, a central lesion (such as that of syringomyelia) will knock out second order neurons of the spinothalamic tract as they cross the centre of the cord, and will cause loss of pain and temperature without loss of fine touch or proprioception. Other causes of dissociated sensory loss include: Diabetes mellitus Syringomyelia Brown-Sequard syndrome Lateral medullary syndrome aka Wallenberg's syndrome Anterior spinal aery thrombosis Tangier disease Subacute combined degeneration Multiple sclerosis Tabes dorsalis Friedreich's ataxia (or other spinocerebellar degeneration) Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2756",

        "exp": "There is convincing evidence that GBS at least in some patients is caused by an infection-induced aberrant immune response that damages the peripheral nerves. Four key factors were identified that control this process Anti-ganglioside antibodies In up to 50% of patients, serum antibodies to various gangliosides present in human peripheral nerves, including GM1, GD1a, Gal. NAc-GD1a, and GQ1b, can be demonstrated. Other antibodies may bind to mixtures or complexes of different gangliosides instead of individual ones. Interestingly, most of these antibodies are related to defined clinical subgroups of GBS. Molecular mimicry and cross-reactivity C. jejuni isolates from GBS patients express lipooligosaccharides (LOS) that mimic the carbohydrates of gangliosides. The type of ganglioside mimic in C. jejuni seems to determine the specificity of the anti-ganglioside antibodies and the associated variant of GBS. Antibodies in these patients usually are cross-reactive; they recognize LOS as well as gangliosides or ganglioside complexes. GBS after Campylobacter infection in anti-GM1/GD1a/GQ1b antibody-related cases is considered to be true example of molecular mimicry-related disease. Complement activation Postmoem studies demonstrated that local complement activation occurs at the side of nerve damage. A mice model for GBS showed that some anti-ganglioside antibodies are toxic for peripheral nerves and can cause blockade of nerve transmission and paralysis of the nerve-muscle preparation. Additionally, there is destruction of the nerve terminal and perisynaptic Schwann cells. Antibodies to GM1 affect the sodium channels at the nodes of Ranvier of rabbit peripheral nerves All of these effects appear to be dependent on complement activation and formation of the membrane attack complex. The neurotoxic effects of these antibodies can be inhibited by IVIG and the complement inhibitor eculizumab Treatment for Gillian barre syndrome: IVIG is applied in a regimen of 2 g/kg bodyweight, usually as 0. 4 g/kg bodyweight per day for five consecutive days. IVIG has replaced PE as the preferred treatment in many centers, mainly because of its greater convenience and availability The combination of PE followed by IVIG was not significantly better than PE or IVIG alone. It appeared that oral steroids and, surprisingly, intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg/day for five consecutive days alone is not beneficial in GBS. The combination of IVIG and intravenous methylprednisolone was not significantly more effective than IVIG alone. Although when a correction was made for known prognostic factors, the combined treatment shows some sho-term effect These trials show that there is an effect of immunotherapy on the course of GBS, but new studies with different regimens or another therapy that is directed toward improving the prognosis and outcome of GBS are needed Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2345",

        "exp": "Approximately one-third of brain abscesses are associated with otitis media and mastoiditis, often with an associated cholesteatoma. Otogenic abscesses occur predominantly in the temporal lobe (55-75%) and cerebellum (20-30%). In some series, up to 90% of cerebellar abscesses are otogenic. The clinical presentation of a brain abscess depends on its location, the nature of the primary infection if present, and the level of the ICP. Hemiparesis is the most common localizing sign of a frontal lobe abscess. A temporal lobe abscess may present with a disturbance of language (dysphasia) or an upper homonymous quadrantanopia. Nystagmus and ataxia are signs of a cerebellar abscess. Signs of raised ICP--papilledema, nausea and vomiting, and drowsiness or confusion--can be the dominant presentation of some abscesses, paicularly those in the cerebellum. Meningismus is not present unless the abscess has ruptured into the ventricle or the infection has spread to the subarachnoid space. Ref Harrison 20th edition page 1013, 1014.",

        "exp": "The Neuropsychology of Autobiographical Memory The medial temporal lobe memory system includes the hippocampus formation and the adjacent parahippocampal and perirhinal coices. The hippocampus is not the place where the content of memories is stored, but rather appears to contain a set of neural links to the content, which is distributed widely throughout the coex. Memories of an episode in one's life typically contain information from more than one modality: vision, hearing, and even taste, touch, and smell. Each of these components is stored in a unimodal sensory area, for example, the visual components of an episodic memory are stored in the visual coex in the occipital lobe, while the auditory components are stored in the auditory coex in the temporal lobe. These distributed representations are linked to a central index in the hippocampus. When recent episodes are retrieved, the index is reactivated, causing activation to spread to each of the associated unimodal areas. This is more correct of recent episodes, however. Once a representation of an episode has been fully consolidated, activation can spread between the separate features themselves, so that hippocampal activation is no longer needed. We are also beginning to gain an understanding of the brain areas that comprise the frontal components of the medial temporal lobe memory system. Medial temporal and hippocampal regions tend to be more involved in spatial context memory, while the frontocoical region, the diencephalon, and the temporal lobes are involved in temporal context memory. Much has also been learned about the neural bases of sho-term memory systems located in the frontal lobes. Psychologists have had trouble determining whether there is one type of sho-term memory, or several. The time span involved - exactly what 'sho' means - is also not widely agreed upon. In the 1980s, however, neuroscientists began exploring a large area in the dorsolateral poion of the prefrontal lobes. This area seems to be responsible for a so of memory that has been called 'working memory' - a concept that at least overlaps with the psychologist's concept of sho-term memory.

Characteristic manifestations of acute pericarditis on ECG most commonly include diffuse ST-segment elevation. However, other conditions may have ECG features similar to those of acute pericarditis. Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium (the fibrous sac surrounding the hea). Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp chest pain. The pain may also be felt in the shoulders, neck, or back. It is typically better sitting up and worse when lying down or breathing deeply. Other symptoms may include fever, weakness, palpitations, and shoness of breath. Occasionally onset of symptoms is gradual. Substernal or left precordial pleuritic chest pain with radiation to the trapezius ridge (the bottom poion of scapula on the back) is the characteristic pain of pericarditis. The pain is usually relieved by sitting up or bending forward, and worsened by lying down (both recumbent and supine positions) or by inspiration (taking a breath in). The pain may resemble that of angina but differs in that pericarditis pain changes with body position, where hea attack pain is generally constant and pressure-like. Other symptoms of pericarditis may include dry cough, fever, fatigue, and anxiety. Due to its similarity to the pain of myocardial infarction (hea attack), pericarditis can be misdiagnosed as a hea attack. Acute myocardial infarction can also cause pericarditis, but the presenting symptoms often differ enough to warrant diagnosis. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2776",

Syringomyelia refers to a fluid-filled space within the cervical spinal cord that produces (1) cervical cord enlargement, best visualized with magnetic resonance imaging; (2) cape-like neurologic abnormalities involving the shoulders and upper extremities; (3) decreased pain and temperature sensation from involvement of the crossed lateral spinothalamic tracts, with preservation of light touch and proprioception; (4) atrophy of the small muscles of the hands from anterior horn cell involvement, simulating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; (5) involvement of the lateral coicospinal tract with upper motor neuron findings; (6) Horner's syndrome, consisting of pupillary constriction, lid lag, and anhidrosis; (7) and associations with Arnold-Chiari malformation and Dandy-Walker cysts. Regarding the other choices: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis involves motor neurons producing upper and lower motor neuron disease. Sensory findings are not present. Multiple sclerosis has sensory and motor deficits. Subacute combined degeneration occurs in vitamin B12 deficiency and involves the dorsal columns and the lateral coicospinal tract.

The MCA is the most common site for the occurrence of ischemic stroke. Depending upon the location and severity of the occlusion, signs and symptoms may vary within the population affected with MCA syndrome. More distal blockages tend to produce milder deficits due to more extensive branching of the aery and less ischemic response. In contrast, the most proximal occlusions result in widespread effects that can lead to significant cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, loss of consciousness and could even be fatal. In such occasions, mannitol (osmotic diuretic) or hypeonic saline are given to draw fluid out of the edematous cerebrum to minimise secondary injury. Hypeonic saline is better than mannitol, as mannitol being a diuretic will decrease the mean aerial pressure and since cerebral perfusion is mean aerial pressure minus intracranial pressure, mannitol will also cause a decrease in cerebral perfusion. Contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss of the face, upper and lower extremities is the most common presentation of MCA syndrome. Lower extremity function is more spared than that of the faciobrachial region. The majority of the primary motor and somatosensory coices are supplied by the MCA and the coical homunculus can, therefore, be used to localize the defects more precisely.
