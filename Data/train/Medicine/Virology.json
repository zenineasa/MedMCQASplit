In June 1996, blood banks in the United States added the p 24 antigen capture assay to the screening process to help identify the rare infected individuals who were donating blood in the time (up to 3 months) between infection and the development of antibodies. In 2002 the ability to detect early infection with HIV w. Tas further enhanced by the licensure of nucleic acid testing (NAT) as a routine part of blood donor screening. These refinements decreased the interval between infection and detection (window period) from 22 days for antibody testing to 16 days with p 24 antigen testing and subsequently to 12 days with nucleic acid testing. Also know: The standard blood screening test for HIV infection is the ELISACommercial EIA kit that contains antigens from both HIV-1 and HIV-2 and thus are able to detect either. The fourth generation EIA tests combine detection of antibodies to HrV with detection of the p 24 antigen of HIVThe most commonly used confirmatory test is the Western blot. While the Western blot is an excellent confirmatory test for HIV infection in patients with a positive or indeterminate EIA, it is a poor screening test. Separate western blot are done for HIV 1 and HIV 2. In addition, the tests detecting levels of HIV RNA can be used to determine prognosis and to assess the response to ARV therapies.",

This time interval, the serologic \"window period, \" is characterized by seronegativity, occasionally detectable antigenemia, viremia (as measured by RNA), and variable CD4 lymphocyte levels. Detection of specific antibody to HIV signals the end of the window period and labels the individual as seropositive.* The exact time when HIV RNA, antigen, and antibody can be detected depends on several factors, including the test used, individual host responses, and viral characteristics. Viral RNA can be detected within the first 2 weeks using the highly sensitive RT-PCR method.
