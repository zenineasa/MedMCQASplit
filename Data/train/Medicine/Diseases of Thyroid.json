It tends to be accompanied by delayed physical maturation so that bone maturation and pubey may be delayed by several years.

Some severely GH-deficient children have recognizable, cherubic facial features characterized by maxillary hypoplasia and forehead prominence. These children have a high pitched voice and are stunted. GH deficiency is associated with hypoglycemia. In contrast gigantism or acromegaly is associated with impaired glucose tolerance.",

        "exp": "The clinical setting of high TSH and T4 with tremors and diarrhea signifies hypehyroidism due to either a TSH secreting pituitary tumor (secondary hypehyroidism) or elevated TRH secretion from hypothalamus (teiary hypehyroidism). But the presence of \"Bi-temporal hemianopia\" localizes the lesion to Pituitary mass compressing the optic chiasma. Hence, the diagnosis is most likely TSH secreting Pituitary Adenoma. Radioiodine or anti-thyroid drugs can be used to control thyrotoxicosis and do urgent MRI to confirm the diagnosis. A combination of trans-sphenoidal surgery, sella irradiation, and octreotide may be required to normalize TSH, because many of these tumors are large and locally invasive at the time of diagnosis.",
