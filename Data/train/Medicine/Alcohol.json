Wernicke's encephalopathy is a condition that can produce nystagmus and a partial deficit of horizontal and vertical gaze that mimics a combined abducens and oculomotor nerve palsy. It occurs in malnourished or alcoholic patients and can be reversed by thiamine. Rx of ethylene glycol induced acidosis include prompt institution of a saline or osmotic diuresis, thiamine and pyridoxine supplements, fomepizole or ethanol, and hemodialysis. THIAMINE (VITAMIN B, ) - FUNCTIONSIn the decarboxylation of a-ketoacids, such as pyruvate a-ketoglutarate, and branched-chain amino acids. Coenzyme for a transketolase reaction that mediates the conversion of hexose and pentose phosphates.# Role in peripheral nerve conduction. Deficiency syndrome:# Wet beriberi (cardiovascular symptoms) can occur after 3 months of a thiamine-deficient diet. Patients present with an enlarged heart, tachycardia, high-output congestive heart failure, peripheral edema, and peripheral neuritis.# Dry beriberi presents with a symmetric peripheral neuropathy of the motor and sensory systems with diminished reflexes.# Alcoholic patients with chronic thiamine deficiency may also have CNS manifestations known as Wernicke's encephalopathy, consisting of:- Horizontal nystagmus, - Ophthalmoplegia +Loss of memory & confabulatory psychosis = Wernicke-Korsakoff synd.- Cerebellar ataxia, &- Mental impairment.# Transketolase activity measured before and after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate. A >25% stimulation by the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate (an activity coefficient of 1. 25) is taken as abnormal.# Rx: In acute thiamine deficiency with either cardiovascular or neurologic signs, 100 mg/d of thiamine should be given parenterally for 7 days, followed by 10 mg/d orally until there is complete recovery.
