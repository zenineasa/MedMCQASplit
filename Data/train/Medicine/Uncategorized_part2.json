        "exp": "Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a feared complication of many serious illnesses, including obstetric complications, sepsis, malignancies, and severe trauma. The most characteristic initiating event is formation (and often subsequent lysis) of microthrombi composed of platelets, fibrin, and coagulative factors. The consumption of coagulative factors leads to increased prothrombin time (PT) and paial thromboplastin time (PTT). The consumption of platelets leads to a decreased platelet count. A more specific confirmatory test is an increase in fibrin split products, such as \"D-dimers. \" Characteristically, DIC clinically produces a mix of hemorrhagic and coagulative complications, and is difficult to treat because correcting the coagulative tendency tends to worsen the hemorrhage, and correcting the hemorrhagic tendency tends to worsen thrombotic complications.

        "question": "NOT a feature of primary hyperaldosteronism is -",
        "exp": "\" Edema is not seen in primary aldosteronism, even though there is marked sodium and water retention. \" Lack of edema is due to the fact that increased atrial natriuretic factor secreted by cardiac tissues limits sodium retention. When the cause of hyperaldosteronism lies within the adrenal gland itself the condition is known as primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) The most common cause of primary hyperaldosteronism is unilateral adrenal adenoma. Clinical features of primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) In primary hyperaldosteronism there is excess secretion of mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) by adrenal cortex. Aldosterone is the major mineralocorticoid secreted by the adrenals. The major physiological effect of aldosterone is It increases absorption of sodium and simultaneously increases secretion ofpotassium by the renal tubular epithelial cells in the collecting tubules. Therefore aldosterone causes sodium to be conserved in the extracellular fluid while increasing potassium excretion in the urine. Now, The effect of excess aldosterone secretion. Excess aldosterone does not cause significant increase in serum sodium Excess aldosterone increases extracellular fluid volume and arterial pressure but has only a small effect on plasma sodium concentration. Although, aldosterone has a potent effect in decreasing the rate of sodium excretion by the kidneys, the concentration of sodium in the extracellular fluid rises only a few milliequivalents. The reason is that when sodium is reabsorbed by the tubules there is simultaneous osmotic absorption of almost equivalents amount of water. Also, small increase in extracellular fluid sodium concentration stimulates thirst and increased water intake, if water is available. Therefore the extracellular fluid volume increases almost as much as the retained sodium but without much change in sodium concentration. Therefore even though aldosterone is one of the body's most powerful sodium retaining hormones, only transient sodium retention occurs when excess amounts are secreted. \u200bExcess aldosterone does not produce edema Aldosterone mediated increase in extracellular fluid volume lasting more than 1-2 days also leads to increase in arterial pressure. Increase in extracellular fluid increase the B. P. to 15-20 mm Hg and this elevated B. P. in turn increases kidney excretion of both salt and water called pressure natriuresis and pressure diuresis. This return to normal of salt and water excretion by the kidneys as a result of pressure natriuresis and diuresis is called aldosterone escape (this mechanism does not allow edema to develop). Thereafter, the rate of gain of salt and water by the body is zero, and balance is maintained between salt and water intake and output by the kidneys despite continued excess aldosterone. In the meantime however the person has developed hypertension, which lasts as long as the person remains exposed to high levels of aldosterone. \u200bExcess aldosterone causes hypokalenzia and muscle weakness Normally aldosterone increases the secretion of potassium by renal tubular epithelial cells. Excess aldosterone further enhances this process. Excess aldosterone not only causes loss ofpotassium ions from the extracellular fluid but also stimulates transport of potassium from the extracellular fluid into intracellular fluid. Therefore, excessive secretion of aldosterone causes serious decrease in plasma potassium concentration. \u200bExcess aldosterone increases tubular hydrogen ion secretion, with resultant mild alkalosis Aldosterone not only causes potassium to be secreted into the tubule in exchange for sodium reabsorption in the cells of renal collecting tubules but also causes secretion of hydrogen ions in exchange for sodium in the intercalated cells of the cortical collecting tubules. The obvious effect of this is to decrease the hydrogen ion concentration in the extracellular fluid. This effect usually causes a mild degree of alkalosis",

Additional features include freezing of gait, postural instability, speech difficulty, autonomic disturbances, sensory alterations, mood disorders, sleep dysfunction, cognitive impairment and dementia. Pathologically, the hallmark features of PD are degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), reduced striatal dopamine, and intracytoplasmic proteinaceous inclusions known as Lewy bodies. Levodopa is routinely administered in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor to prevent its peripheral metabolism to dopamine and the development of nausea and vomiting due to activation of dopamine receptors in the area postrema that are not protected by the BBB.

B: Ankylosing spondylitis Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a chronic systemic inflammatory rheumatic disease, primarily affecting the axial skeleton of which sacroilitis is the hallmark.

Tumor necrosis factor has been identified as key regulatory cytokine. The age of onset is second or third decade of life and males are affected two to three times more than females. The risk factors for the disease are presence of HLA B27, male sex, positive family history, etc. Of them HLA B27 is most impoant as there is almost sixteen times increased chance of developing the disease amongst HLA B27 positive relatives. HLA B27 is present in almost 90%-95% cases. The clinical features are insidious onset, dull pain felt in lower lumber region, associated with morning stiffness lasting for few hours, there may be asymmetric ahritis of other joints mainly of lower limbs.

It represents the development offistulous connections between the lymphatic and the urinary system. Etiologically, Chyluria may be parasitic or nonparasitic. Parasitic chyluria is commoner in the tropics it occurs due to occlusion of the lymphatics usually from filarial infections, and rarely from other causes.

        "exp": "It is a case of Testicular feminisation syndrome. The characteristic features of these disorders are that they are genotypically male (X19 while phenotypically they are female. These cases usually present as a female with abdominal testis. Prepubertal children with this disorder are often detected when inguinal masses prove to be a testis or when a testis is unexpectedly found during herniorrhapy in phenotypically female. It is called testicular feminisation syndrome but the name is both stigmatising and inaccurate (the testes do not produce feminising factors). The preferred name, complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) reflects the underlying aetiology. The cause of androgen insensitivity syndrome is the abnormality of the androgen receptor. In the fetus with CAIS testes forms normally due to the presence of the (SRY gene) on chromosome Y. At the appropriate time, these testes secrete anti-Mullerian hormone leading to the regression of Mullerian ducts. Hence CAIS 'women' do not have a uterus. Testosterone is also produced at the appropriate time. However, due to the complete inability of the androgen receptor to respond, the external genitalia do not virilise and instead undergo female development. These patients have a vagina instead of a penis. Other areas where testosterone may have important fetal effects, such as the brain, will also develop along the female path. The result is a female (both physically and psychologically) with no uterus, testis present which is found at some point in their line of descent through the abdomen from the pelvis to the inguinal canal. During puberty, breast development will be normal; however, the effects of androgens will not be seen, so pubic and axillary hair growth will be minimal. Majority of women with CAIS have shortened vagina when compared with the normal average length of 10-12 cm. The cause of this lies in the embryological development of the vagina, The upper portion of vagina -> develops from Mullerian ducts The lower portion of vagina -> develops from urogenital sinus. In CAIS Mullerian duct regresses, under the effect of the mullerian inhibiting hormone, leaving just the part derived from the urogenital sinus.

        "question": "Osteogenesis imperfecta is a group of diseases characterized by genetic mutations which lead to?",
        "exp": "Collagen is a fibrous protein composed of 3 chains which form the collagen triple helix. Several different types of collagen exist which vary in the types and combinations of the 3 chains forming the collagen helix. Each collagen chain is the product of separate genes. For example, the type of collagen found in skin, aeries, bone, and tendons, Type I Collagen, is composed of 2 a1(I) chains and 1 a2(I) chain. Every third amino acid residue of all of the collagen chains is glycine. This allows the chains to intewine with glycine at the center. Osteogenesis imperfecta is a disease consisting of at least 4 clinically, genetically, and biochemically distinguishable disorders. All are characterized by multiple bone fractures which result in bone deformities. Mutations leading to shoened a1(I) chains cause many of these variants. The sho a1(I) chain associates with normal a1(I) chains and a2(I) chains which prevents normal helix formation. Defective molecules are degraded leading to weakened collagen structures. Other forms of osteogenesis imperfecta are due to mutations in which glycine residues are changed to other amino acids. This leads to destabilization of the collagen helix because of the larger amino acid forced to the center of the helix structure. A decrease in hydroxyproline occurs in scurvy. This occurs because ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is necessary to form the hydroxyproline. With decreased amounts of hydroxyproline in the collagen molecule, the helix is less stable. The result is deficient growth and poor wound healing in the individual with scurvy. The disease Ehlers-Danlos VI is characterized by a decrease in the enzyme lysyl hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the formation of hydroxylysine. The decrease in hydroxylysine in collagen results in less stable cross-linking of the collagen molecules. Ref: Prockop D. J., Bateman J. F. (2012). Chapter 363.

Surprisingly, a-1-antitrypsin disease specifically targets only the liver and the lungs. The liver disease, which can be mild to life-threatening (either due to cirrhosis or, rarely, massive acute hepatic failure), is related to retained a-1-antitrypsin with residual enzymatic activity. The lung disease seems to be the specific result of an inability to turn off elastase produced by neutrophils during lung infections. Neutrophil elastase is one of the few enzymes that can successfully destroy the heavily cross-linked, insoluble, elastin that is presented in the lung interstitium and contributes to its elasticity. With destruction of this lattice-like elastic tissue suppo structure, emphysema can develop in the lungs.

Marfan Syndrome: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a spectrum of disorders caused by a heritable genetic defect of connective tissue that has an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. The defect itself has been isolated to the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, which codes for the connective tissue protein fibrillin. Abnormalities in this protein cause a myriad of distinct clinical problems, of which the musculoskeletal, cardiac, and ocular system problems predominate. The skeleton of patients with MFS typically displays multiple deformities including arachnodactyly (ie, abnormally long and thin digits), dolichostenomelia (ie, long limbs relative to trunk length), pectus deformities (ie, pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum), and thoracolumbar scoliosis. Finally, blindness may result from unrecognized and untreated glaucoma, retinal detachment, and cataracts. In the cardiovascular system, aoic dilatation, aoic regurgitation, and aneurysms are the most worrisome clinical findings. Mitral valve prolapse that requires valve replacement can occur as well. Ocular findings include myopia, cataracts, retinal detachment, and superior dislocation of the lens. Takayasu aeritis is also known as pulseless disease because of frequent occlusion of aeries arising from the aoa. It may also occlude renal aeries. Polyaeritis nodosa is a multisystem necizing vasculitis of small and medium sized muscular aeries in which involvement of the renal and visceral aeries is characteristic.

The severity of hepatic lesion and moality correlates best with the extent to which plasma levels of liver derived coagulation factors are depressed. Prothrombin time which collectively measures factors II, VII, IX and X has not beenprovided amongst the options. Levels of coagulation Factor V have also been shown to predict prognosis in patients with acute liver failure. Accordingly perhaps 'Clinchy (France)' has use: factor V levels' as an isolated prognostic marker in his criteria i. e.

The drugs of choice for legionnairs's disease include Azithromycin and Respiratory Fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, Gemifloxacin and Moxifloxacin It is a case of legionnaire's disease. Legionnaires disease usually presents as atypical pneumoniae. The unique feature of legionnaires disease is that the clinical manifestation of this disease are usually more severe than those of most atypical pneumonias and the course and prognosis of legionella pneumonia more closely resemble those of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia than those ofpneumonia due to other organisms Think about the diagnosis as legionaire's disease whenever the question talks about a pneumonia like picture along with any of the following - Gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhoea. Neurological abnormalities such as confusion and headache altered sensorium. High fever (> 40degC or > 104degF) Numerous neutrophils, but no organisms revealed by gram's staining of respiratory secretions.

Achlorhydria in turn leads to pronounced hypergastrinemia (> 1000 pg/mL) due to loss of acid inhibition of gastrin G cells. Anti-parietal cell antibodies are present in over 90% cases and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies are present in 70% of patients. Decreased intrinsic factor secretion, leads to vitamin B12 malabsorption. Fundic histology in pernicious anemia is characterized by severe gland atrophy and intestinal metaplasia caused by autoimmune destruction of the gastric fundic mucosa. Complications: Hypergastrinemia may induce hyperplasia of gastric enterochromaffin-like cells that leads to the development of small, multicentric carcinoid tumors in 5% of patients and there is a three fold increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma.

Non small cell carcinomas Small cell carcinomas For non small cell carcinomas the primary modality depends on the extent of disease * Localized diseases: (Stage 1 & H) * * Small cell lung carcinomas behave as systemic disease. Most small cell carcinomas have already spread at the time of presentation beyond the bounds of surgery and they are managed primarily by chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. Primary modality of treatment is surgery -- pulmonary resection. * Advanced disease: Radiotherapy with curative intent is advocated (+- chemotherapy) * Metastatic disease (Stage IV) symptomatic/suppoive If we were to go by the information available in the question, The maximum tumor size (T) is = 5 cm ( 3), i. e. T2 There is no nodal involvement (No) There is no distal metastases (Mo) Thus it is T2 No Mo disease or stage I disease The treatment of choice for stage I disease is surgery i. e.

This insulin resistance is relative and supra normal levels of insulin are still capable of normalizing blood glucose. In NIDDM (type II DM) insulin secretion initially increases in response to insulin resistance to maintain normal glucose levels in blood. Thus increased levels of insulin in blood may be seen in patients with NIDDM or type II DM. Pancreatic 1 cells respond by an initial increase in insulin secretion. They are however unable to maintain there hyperinsulinemia for long and gradually as the disease progresses insulin levels decline. Secretion of insulin from )6' cells may thus decrease but it never stops completely. Ketosis or diabetic Ketoacidosis is an acute metabolic complication of diabetes mellitus.

The contractile function of the hibernating myocardium can be almost completely restored after reperfusion (revascularization)' Stunned Myocardium 'Stunned Myocardium refers to a state of postischemic 'reversible' myocardial contractile dysfunction that persists despite myocardial reperfusion. Myocardial stunning essentially describes the postischemic metabolic and contractile compromise in ble myocardium after a transient coronary occlusion (i. e. post successful reperfusion in AMI). In stunned myocardium contraction does not return to baseline for a prolonged period of time after restoration of blood supply and the eventual recovery of contractile dysfunction is believed to be 'spontaneous'. Stunned myocardium is typified by a normal or near normal regional blood flow and represents a mismatch between flow and function. Hibernating Myocardium Hibernating myocardium refers to a state of ischemic (chronic) reversible myocardial contractile dysfunction that is almost completely restored after myocardial reperfusion. Myocardial Hibernation essentially describes a chronic state of contractile dysfunction at rest in non-infarcted ble myocardium as a result of persistently reduced blood flow, which has the potential to improve function after restoration of myocardial blood supply. In Hibernating myocardium the eventual return of contractile dysfunction is believed to be directly related to myocardial reperfusion/revascularization.

The jugular venous pressure (JVP, sometimes referred to as jugular venous pulse) is the indirectly observed pressure over the venous system visualization of the internal jugular vein. The jugular venous pulsation has a biphasic waveform. The \" a \" wave corresponds to right Atrial contraction and ends synchronously with the carotid aery pulse. The peak of the 'a' wave demarcates the end of atrial systole. The \" c \" wave corresponds to right ventricular Contraction causing the tri. Cuspid valve to bulge towards the right atrium. The \" x' \" (x prime) descent follows the 'c' wave and occurs as a result of the right ventricle pulling the tricuspid valve downward during ventricular systole. (As stroke volume is ejected, the ventricle takes up less space in pericardium, allowing rela. Xed atrium to enlarge). The x' (x prime) descent can be used as a measure of right ventricle contractility. The \" x \" descent follows the 'a' wave and corresponds to atrial rela. Xation and rapid atrial filling due to low pressure. The \" v \" wave corresponds to Venous filling when the tricuspid valve is closed and venous pressure increases from venous return - this occurs during and following the carotid pulse.

Although none of the options appear to be appropriate, the best options amongst these should be AST or SGOT. In alcoholic hepatitis, in contrast to other causes of fatty liver, the AST and ALT are usually elevated two to seven fold. In general AST and ALT levels rise parallel to each other. In alcoholic liver disease the AST rises out of propoion to ALT such that the ratio of AST and ALT may become greater than 2. AST (SGOT) is therefore the single best answer. AST/ALT > 2: 1 is suggestive of alcoholic liver disease. AST/ALT > 3: 1 is highly suggestive of alcoholic liver disease. Laboratory dignosis of alcoholic fatty liver and alcoholic hepatitis Test Comments AST * Increase two to seven fold, less than 400U/L, greater than ALT ALT * Increased two to seven fold, less than 400 U/L AST/ALT * Usually less than I GGTP * Not specific to alcohol, easily inducible, elevated in all forms of fatty liver.

Usually develops within the first 2-5 days after acute exposure to altitudes above 2500-3000 metres. It occurs in both unacclamatized and acclamatized inividual who ascends to high altitude from low. An excessive rise in pulmonary aery pressure preceding oedema formation is the crucial pathophysiological factor. Milder forms are; Acute mountain sickness Retinal hemorrhages Peripheral edema High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life-threatening form of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema that occurs in otherwise healthy mountaineers at altitudes above 2, 500 meters (8, 200 feet). Predisposing factors: HAPE is seen in unacclamatized healthy persons. Acclamatized high altitude natives may also develop this syndrome upon return to high altitudes after a relatively brief visit at low altitudes. HAPE generally occurs 1-4 days after rapid ascent to altitudes. This is common under the age of 25 years. HAPE is rare in infants and small children. Cold weather and physical exeion at high altitude are other predisposing factors. Pathogenesis: HAPE belongs to a spectrum of High altitude illness. The initial insult that causes HAPE is excessive hypoxia caused by the lower air pressure at high altitudes. The mechanisms by which this shoage of oxygen causes HAPE are poorly understood, but two processes are believed to be impoant: Increased pulmonary aerial and capillary pressures (pulmonary hypertension) secondary to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. An idiopathic non-inflammatory increase in the permeability of the vascular endothelium. Clinical features: HAPE presents within 2-5 days of arrival at high altitude Early symptoms of HAPE include exeional dyspnoea, cough and reduced exercise performance. As pulmonary oedema progresses, cough worsens and breathlessness at rest and sometimes ohopnoea occur. Gurgling in the chest and pink frothy sputum indicate advanced cases. The clinical features are cyanosis, tachypnoea, tachycardia and elevated body temperature. Investigations: Chest radiographs and computed, tomographic scans of early HAPE show a patchy, peripheral distribution of edema. Prevention and treatment: Slow ascent is the most effective method of prevention, can often be prevented by use of dexamethasone, calcium channel blocking drugs, or long acting inhaled beta-2 adrenergic agonists. Treatment includes Descent from altitude, Bed rest Oxygen Inhaled nitric oxide Nifidipine.

        "exp": "Smokers with COPD are at high risk for development of lung cancer, which can be identified on a chest CT scan. In advanced COPD, CT scans can help determine the possible value of surgical therapy. The two main goals of therapy are to provide symptomatic relief (reduce respiratory symptoms, improve exercise tolerance, improve health status) and reduce future risk (prevent disease progression, prevent and treat exacerbations and reduce mortality). Only three interventions-smoking cessation, oxygen therapy in chronically hypoxemic patients, and lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) in selected patients with emphysema-have been demonstrated to improve survival of patients with COPD. There is suggestive, but not definitive evidence that the use of inhaled corticosteroids(ICS) and muscarinic antagonists may reduce the mortality rate. Smoking Cessation: It has been shown that middle-aged smokers who were able to successfully stop smoking, experienced a significant improvement in the rate of decline in pulmonary function, often returning to annual changes similar to that of non-smoking patients. In addition, smoking cessation improves survival. Thus, all patients with COPD should be strongly urged to quit smoking and educated about the benefits of quitting.

It is the most common sex chromosome abnormality in females. Features of Turner syndrome in children The most severely affected patients generally present during infancy with edema (owing to lymph stasis) of the dorsum of the hand and foot and sometimes swelling of the nape of the neck. Swelling of the neck is related to markedly distended lymphatic channels, producing so called cystic hygroma. As these infants develop, the swelling subsides but often leave bilateral neck webbing and persistent looseness of skin on the back of the neck. Congenital heart disease is also common, particularlypreductal coarctation of Aorta and bicuspid Aortic valve. C. V. S abnormalities are the most important cause of mortality in children with Turner's syndrome. Features of Turner's syndrome in Adolescents and Adult At puberty, there is a failure to develop normal secondary sex characteristics. The genitalia remains infantile, breast development is inadequate and there is little pubic hair. Nipples are widely spaced. Turner syndrome is the single most important cause of primary amenorrhoea accounting for approximately 1/3 of the cases. Short stature (height rarely exceeds 150 cm). The mental status of these patients is usually normal but subtle defects in nonverbal, visual-spatial information processing have been noted (Recall that mental retardation is associated with the presence of extra chromosome) not with the loss of X chromosome. About 50% of the patients develop autoantibodies directed to the thyroid gland and up to one-half of these patients develop hypothyroidism.

This technique demonstrates an inconstancy in the firing of fibres connected to the same motor unit or a blocking of successive discharges from single muscle fibre belonging to the same motor unit. Edrophonium and Neostigmine test/Tensilon test When edrophonium and neostigmine are given intravenously, it produces a transient improvement in strength in patients with myasthenia. Edrophonium and neostigmine are anticholinesterase so they prolong and exaggerate the effect of acetylcholine in the synapse and therefore provide an increment in muscle power in patient with myasthenia. Diagnosis is highly sensitive with 85% sensitivity inocular and 95% sensitivity in systemic myaesthenia. Measurement of receptor antibodies in the blood: Measurement of antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies provides a sensitive and highly specific test for the diagnosis of myasthenia. Presence of Ach antibodies is virtually diagnostic of Myaesthenia graves. Sensitivity is limited to about 50% in purely occular myasthenia and about 85% in generalized myasthenia.
