        "question": "Storage form of thyroid hormone-",
        "exp": "The synthesis and storage of thyroid hormones occurs between the follicular cells and the colloid. The storage form of thyroid hormone is thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin is a large glycoprotein synthesized in the follicular cells and has a molecular weight of around 650 000 with about 140 tyrosine residues, depending on the form of thyroglobulin. Approximately one quaer of these residues is iodinated at the apical-colloid interface. Once iodinated, thyroglobulin is taken up into the colloid of the follicle where, still incorporated in the protein, a coupling reaction between pairs of iodinated tyrosine molecules occurs. The coupling of two tyrosine residues each iodinated at two positions (di-iodotyrosine, DIT) produces tetra-iodothyronine or thyroxine (T4 ) whilst the combination of DIT with mono-iodotyrosine (MIT) produces tri-iodothyronine (T3 ). Such coupling can occur within a single molecule of thyroglobulin or between dimerized molecules of the protein. This coupling is catalyzed by TPO. Thyroid hormones are stored in this state and are only released when the thyroglobulin molecule is taken back up into the follicular cells. Stimulated by TSH, thyroglobulin droplets are captured by the follicular cells by a process of pinocytosis. Fusion of the droplets with lysosomes results in hydrolysis of the thyroglobulin molecules and release of T3 and T4. Reference : page 2285 Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 19th edition",

Impaired production of 1,25(OH) 2 D is now thought to be the principal factor that causes calcium deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone disease; hyperphosphatemia typically occurs only in the later stages of CKD. Low levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D due to increased FGF23 production in bone are critical in the development of hypocalcemia. The uremic state also causes impairment of intestinal absorption by mechanisms other than defects in vitamin D metabolism. Nonetheless, treatment with supraphysiologic amounts of vitamin D or calcitriol corrects the impaired calcium absorption. Since increased FGF23 levels are seen even in early stages of renal failure in some patients, and have been repoed to correlate with increased moality, there is current interest in methods (lowering phosphate absorption) to lower FGF23 levels and concern as to whether vitamin D supplementation (known physiologically to increase FGF23) increases FGF23 in CKD. Hyperphosphatemia in renal failure lowers blood calcium levels by several mechanisms, including extraosseous deposition of calcium and phosphate, impairment of the bone-resorbing action of PTH, and reduction in 1,25(OH) 2 D production by remaining renal tissue(harrison 18 pg 3116)</p>",

        "question": "SIADH true is all except -",
        "exp": "Water retention also occurs in the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH). In this condition, an endogenous source of ADH (either cerebral or tumour-derived) promotes water retention by the kidney in the absence of an appropriate physiological stimulus (Box 16.13). The clinical diagnosis requires the patient to be euvolaemic, with no evidence of cardiac, renal or hepatic disease potentially associated with hyponatraemia. Other non-osmotic stimuli that cause release of ADH (pain, stress, nausea) should also be excluded. Suppoive laboratory findings are shown in Box 16.13. In this situation, plasma concentrations of sodium, chloride, urea and uric acid are low with a correspondingly reduced osmolality. Urine osmolality, which should physiologically be maximally dilute (approximately 50 mmol/kg) in the face of low plasma osmolality, is higher than at least 100 mmol/kg and indeed is typically higher than the plasma osmolality. The urine sodium concentration is typically high (> 30 mmol/L), consistent with euvolaemia and lack of compensatory factors promoting sodium retention. Plasma and urine electrolytes and osmolality (Box 16.14) are usually the only tests required to classify the hyponatraemia. Doubt about clinical signs of ECF volume may be resolved with measurement of plasma renin activity. Measurement of ADH is not generally helpful in distinguishing between these categories of hyponatraemia. This is because ADH is activated both in hypovolaemic states and in most chronic hypervolaemic states, as the impaired circulation in those disorders activates ADH release through non-osmotic mechanisms. Indeed, these disorders may have higher circulating ADH levels than patients with SIADH. The only disorders listed in Box 16.12 in which ADH is suppressed are primary polydipsia and iatrogenic water intoxication, where the hypo-osmolar state inhibits ADH release from the pituitary. The treatment of hyponatraemia is critically dependent on its rate of development, severity and underlying cause. If hyponatraemia has developed rapidly (over hours to days), and there are signs of cerebral oedema such as obtundation or convulsions, sodium levels should be restored to normal rapidly by infusion of hypeonic (3%) sodium chloride. A common approach is to give an initial bolus of 100 mL, which may be repeated once or twice over the initial hours of observation, depending on the neurological response and rise in plasma sodium. On the other hand, rapid correction of hyponatraemia that has developed slowly (over weeks to months) can be hazardous, since brain cells adapt to slowly developing hypo-osmolality by reducing the intracellular osmolality, thus maintaining normal cell volume.

Patients may present with multiple signs and symptoms, including recurrent nephrolithiasis, peptic ulcers, mental changes, and, less frequently, extensive bone resorptionHypercalcemia in vitamin D intoxication is due to an excessive biologic action of the vitamin, perhaps the consequence of increased levels of 25(OH)D rather than merely increased levels of the active metabolite 1,25(OH) 2 D (the latter may not be elevated in vitamin D intoxication). 25(OH)D has definite, if low, biologic activity in the intestine and bone. The production of 25(OH)D is less tightly regulated than is the production of 1,25(OH) 2 D.

Both alleles are inactivated in all patients, and compound heterozygotes, harboring distinct mutations, are common. Clinical features include hypocalcemia, often with tetany or convulsions, hypophosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and osteomalacia, often associated with skeletal deformities and increased alkaline phosphatase. Treatment involves physiologic replacement doses of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 Vitamin D-dependent rickets type II Vitamin D-dependent rickets type II results from end-organ resistance to the active metabolite 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 .

        "question": "In osteoporosis there is -",
        "exp": "Osteoporosis occurs because of a defect in attaining peak bone mass and/or because of accelerated bone loss. In normal individuals, bone mass increases during skeletal growth to reach a peak between the ages of 20 and 40 years but falls thereafter (see Fig. 25.52). In women there is an accelerated phase of bone loss after the meno pause due to oestrogen deficiency, which causes uncou pling of bone resorption and bone formation, such that the amount of bone removed by osteoclasts exceeds the rate of new bone formation by osteoblasts. Agerelated bone loss is a distinct process that accounts for the gradual bone loss that occurs with advancing age in both genders. Bone resorption is not paicularly increased but bone formation is reduced and fails to keep pace with bone resorption. Accumulation of fat in the bone marrow space also occurs because of an agerelated decline in the ability of bone marrow stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts and an increase in their ability to differentiate into adipocytes. Peak bone mass and bone loss are regulated by both genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors account for up to 80% of the population variance in peak bone mass and other determinants of fracture risk, such as bone turnover and bone size. Polymorphisms have been identified in several genes that contribute to the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and many of these are in the RANK and Wnt signalling pathways, which play a critical role in regulating bone turnover (see Fig. 25.2, p. 1061). However, these account for only a small propor tion of the genetic contribution to osteoporosis and many additional genetic variants remain to be discovered. Environmental factors, such as exercise and calcium intake during growth and adolescence, are impoant in maximising peak bone mass and in regulating rates of postmenopausal bone loss. Smoking has a detrimental effect on bone mineral density (BMD) and is associated with an increased fracture risk, paly because female smokers have an earlier menopause than nonsmokers. Heavy alcohol intake is a recognised cause of osteoporo sis and fractures, but moderate intake does not substan tially alter risk.

Subacute thyroiditis may be responsible for 15-20% of patients presenting with thyrotoxicosis and 10% of patients presenting with hypothyroidism . Recognizing this condition is impoant; because it is self-limiting, no specific treatment, such as antithyroid or thyroid hormone replacement therapy, is necessary in most patients. In some cases antithyroids are used to allete the symptoms . In general, the following three forms of subacute thyroiditis are recognized: Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis - Also known as subacute painful or de Quervain thyroiditis Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis - Also known as subacute painless thyroiditis Subacute postpaum thyroiditis Treatment The treatment of subacute thyroiditis is generally suppoive to reduce the symptoms of thyrotoxicosis and to control neck pain in the setting of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. Because no new hormone is being made, antithyroid medications are not effective in these conditions. Although the abnormal thyroid levels are temporary, emotional suppo is often necessary. Patients are often dehydrated from thyrotoxicosis; encourage all patients to drink 6-8 cups per day of noncaffeinated fluids. Surgical care is almost never recommended for subacute thyroiditis.

        "exp": "Chlorpropamide belogs to class of sulphonylureas of anti diabetic drugs . The antabuse reaction, seen in patients imbibing alcohol while being treated with an antidiabetic sulfonylurea, is thought to be due to either an increase in acetaldehyde levels or an alteration in the metabolism of serotonin. Both can occur through an inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase. The oral antidiabetic sulfonylureas, chlorpropamide and tolbutamide, were found to be noncompetitive inhibitors of this enzyme. Acetaldehyde, a metabolite of ethanol, can competitively inhibit aldehyde dehydrogenase. Moreover, the oxidation of ethanol reverses the DPN/DPNH ratio so that the ored pathway of serotonin metabolism is altered, resulting in a decrease of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and an increase of 5-hydroxytryptophol. Thus, ethanol augments the action of the sulfonylureas. Whether the syndrome results from an accumulation of acetaldehyde due to a block in ethanol metabolism, or whether it is a result of an alteration in the metabolism of serotonin, the noncompetitive inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase by the sulfonylureas, coupled with the actions of ethanol, may be considered as a potential cause.

Progressive loss of b cell function takes place over a prolonged period (months to years), but marked hyperglycaemia, accompanied by the classical symptoms of diabetes, occurs only when 80-90% of the functional capacity of b cells has been lost. Metabolic disturbances in type 1 diabetes Patients with type 1 diabetes present when progressive b-cell destruction has crossed a threshold at which adequate insulin secretion and normal blood glucose levels can no longer be sustained. Above a ceain level, high glucose levels may be toxic to the remaining b cells, so that profound insulin deficiency rapidly ensues, causing the metabolic sequ elae shown in Figure 21.5. Hyperglycaemia leads to glycosuria and dehydration, causing fatigue, polyuria, nocturia, thirst and polydipsia, susceptibility to urinary and genital tract infections, and later tachycardia and hypotension. Unrestrained lipolysis and proteolysis result in weight loss. Ketoacidosis occurs when generation of ketone bodies exceeds the capacity for their metabolism. Elevated blood H+ ions drive K+ out of the intracellular compament, while secondary hyperaldosteronism encourages urinary loss of K+. Thus patients usually present with a sho history (typically a few weeks) of hyperglycaemic symptoms (thirst, polyuria, nocturia and fatigue), infections and weight loss, and may have developed ketoacidosis .

Calcitonin, after 24 hours of use, is no longer effective in lowering calcium. Tachyphylaxis, a known phenomenon with this drug, seems to explain the results, since the drug is often effective in the first 24 hours of use. Therefore, in life-threatening hypercalcemia, calcitonin can be used effectively within the first 24 hours in combination with rehydration and saline diuresis while waiting for more sustained effects from a simultaneously administered bisphosphonate such as pamidronate. Usual doses of calcitonin are 2-8 U/kg of body weight IV, SC, or IM every 6-12 hours. OTHER THERAPIES Plicamycin (formerly mithramycin), which inhibits bone resorption, has been a useful therapeutic agent but is now seldom used because of its toxicity and the effectiveness of bisphosphonates.

Typical features include a puffy face with edematous eyelids and nonpitting pretibial edema Other common features include constipation and weight gain (despite a poor appetite).

Libido is decreased in both sexes, and there may be oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea in long-standing disease, but menorrhagia may occur at an early stage. Feility is reduced, and the incidence of miscarriage is increased. Carpal tunnel and other entrapment syndromes are common, as is impairment of muscle function with stiffness, cramps, and pain.

H - 17th / pg. 2204)# Most common type of pituitary adenoma is Prolactinoma.PITUITARY TUMORS# Pituitary adenomas are the most common cause of pituitary hormone hypersecretion and hyposecretion syndromes in adults. They account for -15% of all intracranial neoplasms.Pathogenesis:# Pituitary adenomas are benign neoplasms that arise from one of the five anterior pituitary cell types - tumors arising from lactotrope (PRL), somatotrope (GH), corticotrope (ACTH), thyrotrope (TSH), or gonadotrope (LH, FSH) cells hypersecrete their respective hormones, with prolactinomas being the most common variety.# Several familial syndromes are associated with pituitary tumors, like Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1, Carney syndrome, MeCline-Albright syndrome and Familial acromegaly.C/f:Features of Sellar Mass Lesions:Impacted StructureClinical ImpactPituitaryHypogonadism, Hypothyroidism, Growth failure and adult hyposomatotropism, HypoadrenalismOptic chiasmLoss of red perception, Bitemporal hemianopia, Superior or bitemporal field defect, Scotoma, BlindnessHypothalamusTemperature dysregulation, Appetite and thirst disorders, Obesity, Diabetes insipidus, Sleep disorders, Behavioral dysfunction, Autonomic dysfunctionCavernous sinusOpthalmoplegia with or without ptosis or diplopia, Facial numbnessFrontal lobePersonality disorder, AnosmiaBrainHeadache, Hydrocephalus, Psychosis, Dementia,Laughing seizuresInvestigations# MRI: Sagittal and coronal T1-weighted MRI imaging, before and after administration of gadolinium, allow precise visualization of the pituitary gland with clear delineation of the hypothalamus, pituitary stalk, pituitary tissue and surrounding suprasellar cisterns, cavernous sinuses, sphenoid sinus, and optic chiasm. Pituitary gland height ranges from 6 mm in children to 8 mm in adults; during pregnancy and puberty, the height may reach 10-12 mm. The upper aspect of the adult pituitary is flat or slightly concave, but in adolescent and pregnant individuals, this surface may be convex, reflecting physiologic pituitary enlargement. The stalk should be midline and vertical. CT scan is indicated to define the extent of bony erosion or the presence of calcification.- Anterior pituitary gland soft tissue consistency is slightly heterogeneous on MRI, and signal intensity resembles that of brain matter on T1-weighted imaging. Adenoma density is usually lower than that of surrounding normal tissue on T1 -weighted imaging, and the signal intensity increases with T2-weighted images. The high phospholipid content of the posterior pituitary results in a \"pituitary bright spot.\"Screening Tests for Functional Pituitary Adenomas TestCommentsAcromegalySerum IGF-IInterpret IGF-I relative to age- and gender-matched controls Oral glucose tolerance test with GH obtained at 0, 30, and 60 min Serum PRLNormal subjects should suppress growth hormone to <1 g/LProlactinomaExclude medications MRI of the sella should be ordered if prolactin is elevatedCushing's disease24-h urinary free cortisolEnsure urine collection is total and accurateDexamethasone (1 mg) at 11 P.M. and fasting plasma cortisol measured at 8 A.M.Normal subjects suppress to <5 g/dL ACTH assayDistinguishes adrenal adenoma (ACTH suppressed) from ectopic ACTH or Cushing's disease (ACTH normal or elevated)Rx:# MRI technology with gadolinium enhancement for pituitary visualization, new advances in transsphenoidal surgery and in stereotactic radiotherapy (including gamma-knife radiotherapy), and novel therapeutic agents have improved pituitary tumor management.# The goals of pituitary tumor Rx include normalization of excess pituitary secretion, amelioration of symptoms and signs of hormonal hypersecretion syndromes, and shrinkage or ablation of large tumor masses with relief of adjacent structure compression.# Residual anterior pituitary function should be preserved and can sometimes be restored by removing the tumor mass.Ideally, adenoma recurrence should be prevented.PROLACTINOMA# Introduction:- Tumors arising from lactotrope cells account for about half of all functioning pituitary tumors.- Hyperprolactinemia is the most common pituitary hormone hypersecretion syndrome in both men and women PRL-secreting pituitary adenomas (prolactinomas) are the most common cause of PRL levels >100 g/L. Less pronounced PRL elevation can also be seen with microprolactinomas but is more commonly caused by drugs, pituitary stalk compression, hypothyroidism, or renal failure.# C/f:- Amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and infertility are the hallmarks of hyperprolactinemia in women. If hyperprolactinemia develops prior to menarche, primary amenorrhea results.- If the tumor extends outside of the sella, visual field defects or other mass effects seen.- In men with hyperprolactinemia, diminished libido, infertility, or visual loss (from optic nerve compression) are the usual presenting symptoms. Gonadotropin suppression leads to reduced testosterone, impotence, and oligospermia.# Rx.:- As microadenomas rarely progress to become macroadenomas, no Rx may be needed if fertility is not desired. Estrogen replacement is indicated to prevent bone loss and other consequences of hypoestrogenemia and does not appear to increase the risk of tumor enlargement.- For symptomatic microadenomas, therapeutic goals include control of hyperprolactinemia, reduction of tumor size, restoration of menses and fertility, and resolution of galactorrhea.- Oral dopamine agonists (cabergoline or bromocriptine) are the mainstay of therapy for patients with micro- or macroprolactinomas.- Other Dopamine Agonists include pergolide mesylate, an ergot derivative with dopaminergic properties; lisuride, an ergot derivative; and quinagolide (CV 205-502, Norprolac), a nonergot oral dopamine agonist with specific D2 receptor activity.- Indications for surgical adenoma debulking include dopamine resistance or intolerance, or the presence of an invasive macroadenoma with compromised vision that fails to improve after drug Rx.",

In this context, aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) have received much attention worldwide. Decreased sorbitol flux through polyol pathway by ARIs could be an emerging target for the management of major complications of diabetes. The ARIs developed vary structurally, and representative structural classes of ARIs include i) carboxylic acid derivatives (such as Epalrestat, Alrestatin, Zopalrestat, Zenarestat, Ponalrestat, Lidorestat, and Tolrestat), ii) spirohydantoins and related cyclic amides (such as Sorbinil, Minalrestat, and Fidarestat), and iii) phenolic derivatives (related to Benzopyran-4-one and Chalcone). Among these inhibitors, Epalrestat is the only commercially available inhibitor till date. In addition, some other ARIs such as Sorbinil and Ranirestat had been advanced into late stage of clinical trials and found to be safe for human use. Adapting ARIs could prevent sepsis complications, prevent angiogenesis, ameliorate mild or asymptomatic diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy and appear to be a promising strategy for the treatment of endotoxemia and other ROS-induced inflammatory diseases .

The typical picture is failure of lactation (first sign often), amenorrhoea, hypothyroidism and adrenocoical insufficiency. Treatment of young women with Sheehan's syndrome usually includes replacement of hydrocoisone first and then replacement of thyroid hormone and estrogen with or without progesterone depending on whether she has a uterus. Hydrocoisone is replaced first because thyroxine therapy can exacerbate glucocoicoid deficiency and theoretically induce an adrenal crisis.

Osteitis fibrosa results from increased bone resorption by osteoclasts with fibrous replacement in the lacunae. This may present as bone pain and tenderness, fracture and deformity. Chondrocalcinosis can occur due to deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals within aicular cailage. It typically affects the menisci at the knees and can result in secondary degenerative ahritis or predispose to attacks of acute pseudogout Skeletal X-rays are usually normal in mild primary hyperparathyroidism, but in patients with advanced disease characteristic changes are observed. In the early stages there is demineralisation, with subperiosteal erosions and terminal resorption in the phalanges. A 'pepper-pot' appearance may be seen on lateral X-rays of the skull. Reduced bone mineral density, resulting in either osteopenia or osteoporosis, is now the most common skeletal manifestation of hyperparathyroidism. This is usually not evident radiographically and requires assessment by DEXA (p. 1065). Primary hyperparathyroidism Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by autonomous secretion of PTH, usually by a single parathyroid adenoma, which can vary in diameter from a few millimetres to several centimetres. It should be distinguished from secondary hyperparathyroidism, in which there is a physiological increase in PTH secretion to compensate for prolonged hypocalcaemia (such as in vitamin D deficiency, p. 1126), and from teiary hyperparathyroidism, in which continuous stimulation of the parathyroids over a prolonged period of time results in adenoma formation and autonomous PTH secretion (Box 20.39). This is most commonly seen in individuals with advanced chronic kidney disease (p. 483). The prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism is about 1 in 800 and it is 2-3 times more common in women than men; 90% of patients are over 50 years of age. It also occurs in the familial MEN syndromes (p. 795), in which case hyperplasia or multiple adenomas of all four parathyroid glands are more likely than a solitary adenoma. Clinical and radiological features The clinical presentation of primary hyperparathyroidism is described on page 769. Parathyroid bone disease is now rare due to earlier diagnosis and treatment. Osteitis fibrosa results from increased bone resorption by osteoclasts with fibrous replacement in the lacunae. This may present as bone pain and tenderness, fracture and deformity.

MANAGEMENT-The main indication for treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption is bone pain thought to be due to increased metabolic activity (Box 25.82). It is often difficult Management The main indication for treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption is bone pain thought to be due to increased metabolic activity (Box 25.82). It is often difficult to dif ferentiate this from pain due to complications such as bone deformity, nerve compression symptoms and OA. If there is doubt, it can be wohwhile giving a therapeu tic trial of antiresorptive therapy to determine whether the symptoms improve. A positive response indicates that the pain was due to increased metabolic activity. The aminobisphosphonates pamidronate, zoledronate and risedronate are more effective than simple bisphos phonates such as etidronate and tiludronate at suppress ing bone turnover in PDB, but their effects on pain are similar. Although bisphosphonates suppress bone turn over in PDB, there is no evidence to show that they alter the natural history or prevent complications. Calcitonin can be used as an alternative but is less convenient to administer and more expensive. Repeated courses of bisphosphonates or calcitonin can be given if symptoms recur. If symptoms do not respond to antiresorptive therapy, it is likely that the pain is due to a complication of the disease and this should be managed according to the principles described on page 1085.

She has noticed gradually increasing coarse hair on her upper lip, chin, and lower abdomen for the past 3 years. She notices mild facial acne but denies frontal balding or deepening of voice. Her menses are irregular, occurring every 28 to 60 days. She and her husband use condoms for contraception. They have no children. She uses over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide for the acne but otherwise takes no medications or supplements. On examination, her BMI is 29.0 and her waist circumference is 36 in. Her voice is normal; she has mild facial acne. There is mild acanthosis nigricans of the axillae. Pelvic examination is normal without ovarian mass or clitoromegaly. Evaluation of her hirsutism should include which of the following?",
        "exp": "Abnormal growth of terminal hair in androgen-dependent areas in a woman is termed hirsutism. It is a common problem, affecting 5% to 10% of premenopausal women. Hirsutism should be distinguished from virilization, which includes frontal balding, deepening of the voice, and clitoromegaly in addition to hirsutism Virilization (especially of recent onset) is worrisome for an androgen producing tumor of the adrenal gland or ovary. Women with moderate hirsutism (as in this case) or any evidence of virilization should undergo endocrine testing with DHEA-S (to rule out adrenal androgen overproduction), testosterone (to rule out ovarian androgen overproduction), TSH, prolactin, and follicular phase 17-hydroxy progesterone (to rule out late-manifesting congenital adrenal hyperplasia).This woman likely has polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS and idiopathic hirsutism are the two most common causes of hirsutism in women. PCOS is classically diagnosed with any 2 of these 3 criteria: oligomenorrhea (with anovulatory bleeding), clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism (excluding other causes of hyperandrogenemia), and polycystic ovaries by ultrasound. Most women with PCOS will have elevated serum DHEA-S and testosterone concentrations; facial acne is common but full virilization is rare. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, seen clinically as acanthosis nigricans, are also common findings. Women with PCOS are at increased risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Exercise and weight loss are first-line recommendations and may restore normal ovulation without medications. Treatment for women not pursuing pregnancy includes oral contraceptives (which improve the hirsutism) or metformin (which improves insulin resistance and often restores ovulatory periods).Although checking fasting blood glucose is reasonable, glucose tolerance test is not part of the first-line workup for hirsutism. The overnight dexamethasone suppression test is sometimes used for the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome, but in the absence of other features of hypercortisolism (ecchymoses, purplish abdominal striae) it would not be recommended. In addition, 24-hour urine free cortisol should be the first test for suspected Cushing syndrome. Women with testosterone levels of >200 ng/dL or DHEA-S levels of >700 mg/dL should have imaging of the ovaries and adrenal glands but ordering a CT scan of the adrenals would be premature until the hormone levels are available. Spironolactone (which has antiandrogenic as well as anti-mineralocorticoid properties) is often used to treat idiopathic hirsutism, but by definition patients with this condition have normal menses and normal androgen levels. Starting spironolactone before ruling out other, more serious conditions would be premature.",

The calculated free water deficit (which averages 9-10 L) should be reversed over the next 1-2 days (infusion rates of 200-300 mL/h of hypotonic solution).Hypophosphatemia may occur during therapy and can be improved by using KPG4 and beginning nutrition.A reasonable regimen for HHS begins with an IV insulin bolus of 0.1 units/kg followed by IV insulin at a constant infusion rate of 0.1 units/ kg per hour.The insulin infusion should be continued until the patient has resumed eating and can be transferred to a SC insulin regimen.",

Accordingly, if an asymptomatic individual has had hypercalcemia or some manifestation of hypercalcemia such as kidney stones for >1 or 2 years, it is unlikely that malignancy is the cause.Hypercalcemia from any cause can result in fatigue, depression, mental confusion, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, reversible renal tubular defects, increased urination, a sho QT interval in the electrocardiogram, and, in some patients, cardiac arrhythmias. There is a variable relation from one patient to the next between the severity of hypercalcemia and the symptoms. Generally, symptoms are more common at calcium levels >2.9-3 mmol/L (11.5-12 mg/dL), but some patients, even at this level, are asymptomatic. When the calcium level is >3.2 mmol/L (13 mg/dL), calcification in kidneys, skin, vessels, lungs, hea, and stomach occurs and renal insufficiency may develop, paicularly if blood phosphate levels are normal or elevated due to impaired renal function.

        "question": "Inapproprite ADH secretion is characterised by the following except -",
        "exp": "Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a condition in which the body makes too much antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This hormone helps the kidneys control the amount of water your body loses through the urine. SIADH causes the body to retain too much water . Actions of ADH Osmoregulation The most impoant and primary function of ADH is to maintain the plasma tonicity, primarily by an alteration in water balance. Osmoreceptors detect the change in effective plasma osmolality in the hypothalamus. A decrease in tonicity prevents ADH release and prevents water retention. An increase in tonicity causes ADH release, which acts on V2 receptors on the luminal surface of coical and medullary collecting tubular cells. Under the influence of ADH, unique aquaporin-2 water channels are formed by the fusion of pre-formed cytoplasmic vesicles in the tubular cells and water is absorbed down the concentration gradient. Once the water is absorbed, these channels are removed by endocytosis and returned to the cytoplasm. The osmoreceptors are extremely sensitive, responding to alterations in the plasma tonicity of as little as 1%. The osmotic threshold for ADH release in humans is about 280 to 290 mOsmol/kg. Below this level, their is little circulating ADH, and the urine should be maximally diluted with an osmolality below 100 mOsmol/kg. Above the osmotic threshold, their is a relatively linear rise in ADH secretion. This system is so efficient that the plasma osmolality does not typically vary by more then 1% to 2%, despite wide water intake fluctuations. In patients with SIADH, levels of ADH are high even in the presence of decreased plasma osmolality and/or hyponatremia. Excess water absorption keeps the blood volume high or normal. Volume Regulation An acute drop in blood pressure as sensed by \" volume receptors\" rather then \"osmoreceptors\" causes ADH release (along with other hormones like rennin and epinephrine) which generates free water absorption from the kidneys. This can potentially lead to hyponatremia and a decrease in effective ECF osmolality. So, the main focus in rapid and/or substantial decrease in blood volume is \"volume regulation,\" even at the cost of osmolality. This affect is more prominent in patients with liver disease or cardiac disease, and hyponatremia in such patients is the direct predictor of a worse prognosis Clinical manifestations of SIADH can be due to hyponatremia and decreased ECF osmolality which causes the water to move into the cells causing cerebral edema. Signs and symptoms depend upon the rate and severity of hyponatremia and the degree of cerebral edema. The earliest clinical manifestations of acute hyponatremia include nausea and malaise, which may be seen when the serum sodium concentration falls below 125 to 130 mEq/L (normal 135 to 145mEq/L). Vomiting is an ominous sign for patients with acute hyponatremia. With a more severe and acute fall in sodium concentration, headache, lethargy, obtundation, and eventually, seizures can occur. Coma and respiratory arrest can occur if the serum sodium level falls below 115 to 120 mEq/L. Acute hyponatremic encephalopathy may be reversible, but permanent neurologic damage or death can occur, paicularly in premenopausal women. Chronic hyponatremia allows cerebral adaptation, and the patients remain asymptomatic despite a serum sodium concentration below 120mmol/L. Nonspecific symptoms like nausea, vomiting, gait disturbances, memory and cognitive problems, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, and muscle cramps can occur with chronic hyponatremia. Sign and symptoms or mild and chronic hyponatremia are often subtle and missed during history and physical examination. Nausea and vomiting effect approximately one-third of patients with chronic hyponatremia who have a serum sodium concentration less then 120 mmol/L. The Idiopathic SIADH is more common in patients over 65 years of age, and mild to moderate hyponatremia in such patients may contribute to fractures in addition to a higher risk of falls and gait problems. Schwaz and Bater made a clinical criterion in 1967 which is still valid up to the date. The Schwaz and Bater Clinical Criterion Serum sodium less then 135mEq/L Serum osmolality less then 275 mOsm/kg Urine sodium greater then 40 mEq/L (due to ADH-mediated free water absorption from renal collecting tubules) Urine osmolality greater then 100 mOsm/kg The absence of clinical evidence of volume depletion - normal skin turgor, blood pressure within the reference range The absence of other causes of hyponatremia - adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, cardiac failure, pituitary insufficiency, renal disease with salt wastage, hepatic disease, drugs that impair renal water excretion.

Similarly, intestinal malabsorption of dietary fats leads to vitamin D deficiency.The most specific screening test for vitamin D deficiency in oth- erwise healthy individuals is a serum 25(OH)D level. Although the normal ranges vary, levels of 25(OH)D <37 nmol/L (<15 ng/ mL) are associated with increasing PTH levels and lower bone density; optimal vitamin D levels are >80 nmol/L (>32 ng/mL). Vitamin D deficiency leads to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium, resulting in decreased serum total and ionized calcium val- ues. This hypocalcemia results in secondary hyperparathyroidism, a homeostatic response that initially maintains serum calcium levels at the expense of the skeleton. Due to the PTH-induced increase in bone turnover, alkaline phosphatase levels are often increased. In addition to increasing bone resorption, PTH decreases urinary calcium excretion while promoting phosphaturia. This results in hypophosphatemia, which exacerbates the mineralization defect in the skeleton. With prolonged vitamin D deficiency resulting in osteomalacia, calcium stores in the skeleton become relatively inaccessible, since osteoclasts cannot resorb unmineralized osteoid, and frank hypocalcemia ensues( Harrison 17 pg 2376)",

The nodule is a follicular adenoma, which autonomously secretes excess thyroid hormones and inhibits endogenous TSH secretion, with subsequent atrophy of the rest of the thyroid gland. The adenoma is usually greater than 3 cm in diameter. Most patients are female and over 40 years of age. Although many nodules are palpable, the diagnosis can be made with ceainty only by thyroid scintigraphy (see Fig. 20.4, p. 742). The thyrotoxicosis is usually mild and in almost 50% of patients the plasma T3 alone is elevated T3 thyrotoxicosis). 131I (400-800 MBq (10-20 mCi)) is highly effective and is an ideal treatment since the atrophic cells surrounding the nodule do not take up iodine and so receive little or no radiation.

This enzyme also paicipates in the breakdown of reverse T3 (rT3) by conveing it to 3,3'-diiodothyronine. Decreased activity of type I 5'-monodeiodinase will, therefore, decrease plasma levels of T3 and increase plasma levels of rT3 (by decreasing its breakdown). Type II 5'-monodeiodinase is present in the anterior pituitary and central nervous system. Conversion of T 4 to T 3 within the anterior pituitary by this enzyme is responsible for normal feedback inhibition of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion. With decreased type, I 5'-monodeiodinase activity, plasma levels ofT4 and TSH usually stay within normal limits because the type II enzyme continues to ensure normal feedback inhibition by anterior pituitary T 3.

Patients may present with multiple signs and symptoms, including recurrent nephrolithiasis, peptic ulcers, mental changes, and, less frequently, extensive bone resorptionHypercalcemia in vitamin D intoxication is due to an excessive biologic action of the vitamin, perhaps the consequence of increased levels of 25(OH)D rather than merely increased levels of the active metabolite 1,25(OH) 2 D (the latter may not be elevated in vitamin D intoxication). 25(OH)D has definite, if low, biologic activity in the intestine and bone. The production of 25(OH)D is less tightly regulated than is the production of 1,25(OH) 2 D. Hence concentrations of 25(OH)D are elevated severalfold in patients with excess vitamin D intake.In secondary adrenal insufficiency, only glucocoicoid deficiency is present, as the adrenal itself is intact and thus still amenable to regulation by the RAA system.

Acidosis can result in fatal rhythm disturbance.Diagnosis:The diagnosis of DKA can be made by finding elevated blood glucose, increased serum levels of acetoacetate, acetone, and hydroxybutyrate, metabolic acidosis (low serum bicarbonate and low blood pH), and increased anion gap (sodium-).DKA is managed with insulin, fluids, and electrolyte replacement.Normal saline should be given in high volume with insulin replacement.Bolus with 5-10 units of regular insulin. Acutely, DKA is associated with hyperkalemia. The total body level of potassium is depleted because of the urinary loss of potassium. As soon as the potassium level falls to <5 mEq/L, potassium replacement should be given.Fig. 5: Pathophysiology of DKAClinical points in the management of DKABegin management with IV insulin, and then switch to subcutaneous insulin when the anion gap normalizes and serum bicarbonate levels are normal.Do not stop the IV insulin before starting subcutaneous insulin; instead, overlap them both for 6-8 hours.Add 5% dextrose to the normal saline as blood glucose reaches 200-250 mg/dL, and continue IV insulin until the anion gap normalizes.",
