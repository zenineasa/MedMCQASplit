SIADH should be suspected in patients who have hyponatremia and concentrated urine (osmolality > 300 mmol/kg) in the absence of edema, ohostatic hypotension and features of dehydration. Diagnosis is suppoed by finding of blood urea nitrogen, serum uric acid, creatinine, etc. in low normal or subnormal range Q (as can be expected from hypervolumia).

        "exp": "Chronic pulmonary emphysema is characterized by distention of small air spaces distal to the respiratory bronchioles and destruction of alveolar septa. Long-term cigarette smoking is the usual cause. The marked loss of lung parenchyma associated with emphysema leads to a decrease in the diffusion capacity of the lungs, which reduces their ability to oxygenate blood and remove carbon dioxide. When aerial hypoxemia is persistent and severe, oxygen therapy should therefore be considered. Oxygen therapy is less effective for treating the hypoxia associated with anemia , edematous tissues , localized circulatory deficiencies , and right-to-left cardiac shunts , because in each case, there is already adequate oxygen available in the alveoli. The problem in each of these situations is inadequate transpo of oxygen to the tissues, blunting the effects of increasing the oxygen tension of the inspired air. Oxygen therapy will nonetheless increase the amount of dissolved oxygen carried in the blood, which may be life-saving in some instances. Ref:Smith D.A. (2011). Chapter 33. Pulmonary Emergencies.

Trigeminal Neuralgia is typically characterized by Paroxysmal attacks of brief electric shock-like pains, abrupt in onset and termination, limited to the distribution of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve lasting for a brief period from a fraction of a second to 2 minutes. The most common division of the trigeminal nerve involved in trigeminal neuralgia is the Maxillary division (V2) followed by the mandibular division (V3). The ophthalmic Division (VI) is rarely involved The pain often evokes spasm of the muscle of the face on the affected side. The clinical association between Trigeminal Neuralgia and hemifacial spasm is called Tic Douloureux. Typical Features of Trigeminal Neuralgia (Prosopalgia, Fothergill's disease) Sudden/ Abrupt onset and termination Sharp superficial, stabbing or burning in quality Severe in intensity Brief in duration (lasting for a brief period from a fraction of a second to 2 minutes) Intermittent (Between paroxysms the patient is usually asymptomatic. Following a painful paroxysm there is usually a refractory period during which pain cannot be triggered) Unilateral (The pain never crosses to the opposite side but it may rarely occur bilaterally in which case a central cause such as multiple sclerosis must be considered) Precipitated from trigger areas or by trigger factors in the trigeminal area such as eating or chewing, washing the face, shaving, smoking, talking or brushing the teeth There is no clinically evident neurological deficit Note : Trigeminal Neuralgia is More common with advancing age Trigeminal Neuralgia is More common in women Trigeminal Neuralgia is More common on right side Trigeminal Neuralgia attacks are most frequent during the day (but may awaken the patient at night) Trigeminal Neuralgia most frequently arises from the maxillary division of Trigeminal nerve (V2)",

This is caused by peripheral unresponsiveness to the biological action of PTH or PTH resistance. Although several subtypes of Pseudohypoparathyroidism are identified, the most common subtype of PHP (PHP la) is characterized by deficient urinary cyclic AMP response to administration of exogenous PTH. Failure of cAMP production in these patients after PTH infusion is believed to result from a defect in cyclic AMP mediated signal transduction from a Gsa Loss of function' mutation as depicted in the figure (previous heading) 'The measurement of cyclic AMP in urine following an infusion of synthetic PTH is now used to establish a diagnosis of PTH resistance' - William's Endocrinology 11'\"/1243 Pseudohypoparathyroidism is associated with a 'loss of function' inherited G sa mutation.

Decrease in hematocrit PCV in the early hours after acute hemorrhage is usually the result of volume resuscitation rather than ongoing blood loss. The body adjusts to severe hemorrhage by expanding the circulating volume at the expense of extravascular fluid. However, within several hours after hemorrhage plasma volume begins to increase due to shift of interstitial fluid into vascular space RBCs cannot be replaced quickly as the bone marrow takes approximately ten days to produce mature RBCs. As a result PCV done several hours after bleeding episode will show more accurate picture of the hematocrit (Le. decreased PCV).

Affected patients may initially experience hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, malaise, and weight loss. Fever does not occur and is uncharacteristic of chronic lymphocytic leukemia unless there is a superimposed infectious process. About one-fouh of patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, with the diagnosis having been made on the basis of abnormal peripheral CBC. The diagnosis often can be made from the peripheral blood smear alone without the need for a bone marrow biopsy or aspirate. This tends to be paicularly when greater than 15,000 mature lymphocytes are seen in the peripheral blood smear. The malignant lymphocytes are usually B-cells that demonstrate small amounts of monoclonal surface immunoglobulin, usually IgM. Hypogammaglobulinemia affects at least fifty percent of patients and, in combination with neutropenia, may eventually render these patients susceptible to infection. Survival in CLL is long, with a median range of between six and nine years. Treatment is non curative and is reserved for those patients who are symptomatic. Death is usually the result of infection, hemorrhage or inanition. Ref: Kipps T.J. (2010). Chapter 94. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Related Diseases. In J.T. Prchal, K.

Pathophysiology of different types of jaundice Normal blood contains unconjugated bilirubin only (no conjugated bilirubin) Unconjugated bilintbin is water insoluble (lipophilic, lipid soluble) and not filterable by the kidney. Unconjugated bilirubin is taken up from the systemic circulation by hepatocytes (1) Unconjugated bilirubin is then conjugated to bilirubin glucoronide by glucorony I transferase within the hepatocytes(2) Conjugated bilirubin is then excreted into the bile from where it reaches the GIT (3) This is the rate limiting step. Conjugated bilirubin is water soluble and filterable by the kidney Normally, there is no conjugated bilirubin in the systemic circulation and hence no bilirubin is filtered in the kidney or present in the urine. Abnormally When there is hepatocellular dysfunction or bile flow is totally obstructed, conjugated bilirubin -leaks\" into the systemic circulation This conjugated bilirubin may now be excreted by the kidney and be detected in urine. Bilirubin in urine (bilirubinurial Presence of bilirubin in urine suggests a diagnosis of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia either due to hepatocellular jaundice or obstructive jaundice. Within the GIT conjugated bilirubin is degraded/reduced to urobilinogen and then to stercobilinogen Urobilinogen is water soluble and filterable by the kidney Normally, a small poion of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed from the gut and excreted by the kidney (<4 mg/day) In non obstructive hyperbilirubinemia (hemolytic, hepatocellular) the amount of urobilinogen exreatcd by the kidney is increased as more urobilinogen is formed and reabsorbed. Elevated levels of urobilinogen suggest primarily an non obstructive hyperbilirubinemia In obstructive hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated bilirubin does not reach the GIT and hence no urobilinogen is formed Absent levels of urobilinogen suggest a diangnosis of obstructive hyperbilirubinentia Condition Serum Bilirubin Urine Urobilinogen Urine Bilirubin Fecal urobilinogen Normal Direct 0.1-0.4 mg/dl Indirect 0.2-0.7 mg/dl 0-4 mg/24 h Absent 40-280 mg/24h Hemolytic anemia T Indirect Increased Absent Increased Hepatitis \"i' Direct and indirect Decreased if micro- obstruction is present Present if microobstruction occurs Decreased Obstructive jaundice T Direct Absent Present Trace to absent",

Clinical Manifestations\n\u25a0 The onset of Bell\u2019s palsy is fairly abrupt, maximal weakness being attained by 48 h as a general rule.\n\u25a0 Pain behind the ear may precede the paralysis for a day or two.\n\u25a0 Taste sensation may be lost unilaterally, and hyperacusis may be present.\n\u25a0 In some cases there is mild cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis.\n\u25a0 MRI may reveal swelling and uniform enhancement of the geniculate ganglion and facial nerve, and, in some cases, entrapment of the swollen nerve in the temporal bone.\n\u25a0 Approximately 80% of patients recover within a few weeks or months.\n\u25a0 The presence of incomplete paralysis in the first week is the most favorable prognostic sign. Pathophysiology\n\u25a0 Bell\u2019s palsy is associated with the presence of herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA in endoneurial fluid and posterior auricular muscle,\nsuggesting that a reactivation of this virus in the geniculate ganglion may be responsible. However, a causal role for herpes simplex virus in Bell\u2019s palsy is unproven.\nDifferential Diagnosis\n\u25a0 Tumors that invade the temporal bone (carotid body, cholesteatoma, dermoid).\n\u25a0 The Ramsay Hunt syndrome, presumably due to herpes zoster of the geniculate ganglion, consists of a severe facial palsy associated with a vesicular eruption in the pharynx,\nexternal auditory canal, and other parts of the cranial integument; often the eighth cranial nerve is affected as well.\n\u25a0 Acoustic neuromas frequently involve the facial nerve by local compression.\n\u25a0 Infarcts, demyelinating lesions of multiple sclerosis, and tumors are the common pontine lesions that interrupt the facial nerve fibers; other signs of brainstem involvement are usually present.\n\u25a0 Bilateral facial paralysis (facial diplegia) occurs in Guillain-Barre' syndrome and also in a form of sarcoidosis known as uveoparotid fever (Heerfordt syndrome).\n\u25a0 Lyme disease is a frequent cause of facial palsies in endemic areas.\n\u25a0 The rare Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome consists of a triad of recurrent facial paralysis, recurrent\u2014and eventually permanent\u2014facial (particularly labial) edema, and less constantly,\nplication of the tongue;\n\u25a0 Leprosy frequently involves the facial nerve, and facial neuropathy may also occur in diabetes mellitus.\n\u25a0 All these forms of nuclear or peripheral facial palsy must be distinguished from the supranuclear type.\n\u25a0 In the latter, the frontalis and orbicularis oculi muscles are involved less than those of the lower part of the face, since the upper facial muscles are innervated by corticobulbar pathways from both motor cortices, whereas the lower facial muscles are innervated only by the opposite hemisphere. Treatment\n\u25a0 Symptomatic measures include use of paper tape to depress the upper eyelid during sleep and prevent corneal drying, and Massage of the weakened muscles.\n\u25a0 A course of glucocorticoids, given as prednisone 60 to 80 mg daily during the first 5 days and then tapered over the next 5 days,\nappears to shorten the recovery period and modestly improve the functional outcome.\n\u25a0 In one double-blind study, patients treated within 3 days of onset with both prednisone and acyclovir (400 mg five times daily for 10 days) had a better outcome than patients treated with\nprednisone alone.",

Despite thrombocytopenia bleeding is rare in HIT. On the contrary HIT is more related to thrombosis, which often leads to initial recognition of this condition (HIT). `Thrombosis often leads to initial recognition of HIT. Bleeding is rare despite thrombocytopenia' - Essentials of Emergency Medicine (2006)/286 Thrombocytopenia with Thrombosis DIC TTP HUS HIT Thrombosis in Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia is caused by the generation of prothrombotic platelet micropaicles that promote thrombin generation. HIT is an antibody - mediated process that is triggered by antibodies directed against neoantigens on PF4 that are exposed when heparin binds to this protein. These antibodies (usually IgG type) bind simultaneously to heparin PF4 complex and to platelet Fc receptors. Such binding activates the platelets and generates platelet micropaicles. Circulating micropaicles are prothrombotic because they express anionic phospholipids on their surface and can bind clotting factors and promote thrombin generation.

Interestingly, diseases that result in fibrosis of the interstitium (e.g., IPF) also result in crackles that sound like Velcro being ripped apart.\n\u00a0\nReference: Harrison\u2019s P R I N C I P L E S\u00a0 \u00a0O F I N T E R N A L M E D I C I N E 20th edition page no 1944",

Classification: They are based on Shape : saccular, fusiform or dissecting Size : non-giant or giant 4 2.5cm Location : anterior or posterior circulation Disease process: traumatic, non-traumatic, infectious Pathogenesis: The pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms is a combination of degenerative changes in the elastica, and acquired defects and progressive thinning in the muscular layer leading to funnel shaped dilatation. Location: Eighty percent of intracranial aneurysms are located in the anterior circulation (circle of Willis). Twenty-five percent of these are located at the origin of the posterior communicating aery on the internal carotid aery. Clinical features: Most unruptured intracranial aneurysms are completely asymptomatic. Symptoms are usually due to rupture and resultant subarachnoid hemorrhage. Occasionally neurological symptoms may arise due to mass effect of the aneurysm. Oculomotor nerve palsy is a presenting feature in 20% of patients with posterior communicating aery aneurysms Visual field deficits (contralateral homonymous hemianopia) in relation to compression of the optic tract, Mental derangements if the aneurysm compresses the mammillary bodies Pituitary insufficiency if the aneurysm grows into the sella turcica Diagnosis: Aneurysms can be incidental, asymptomatic, or symptomatic.

Elevated PCWP but with Pressure <25mm Hg is usually associated with interstitial pulmonary edema and not true alveolar pulmonary edema. Hydrostatic pulmonary edema is also known as cardiogenic pulmonary edema (since it typically arises from left hea failure). The inefficient left ventricle causes blood to back up in the *pulmonary circulation, increasing hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary capillaries (Increased PCWP). High capillary pressure progressively forces fluid first into the interstitium (Interstitial Pulmonary Edema) and then into the alveoli (Alveolar Pulmonary Edema). Three stages of pulmonary edema can be distinguished based on the degree of fluid accumulation Stage 1 is characterized by excess fluid that can still be cleared by lymphatic drainage. Stage 2 is characterized by the presence of interstitial edema. Stage 3 is characterized by alveolar pulmonary edema (fluid and proteins enter the alveolar space) PCWP Stage Interpretation in relation to Hydrostatic Pulmonary Edema 6-12 mm Hg Normal No Pulmonary Edema (Normal) 12-18mm Hg Stage I Usually not associated with pulmonary edema (Mild Increase) Excess fluid can still be cleared by lymphatic drainage No Physical or X-ray Findings are usually evident 18 - 25 mm Hg Stage 2 Characterized by the presence of interstitial edema (Moderate Increase) Some physical findings including some fine crackling breath sounds may be evident X-ray evidences of pulmonary edema in the form of engorged pulmonary vessels and appearance of infiltrates may be seen >25 mm Hg Stage 3 Characterized by alveolar pulmonary edema (fluid and proteins enter the alveolar (Severe Increase) space) Physical findings are prominent and include clinically significant hypoxemia, tachypnea, respiratory distress, diffuse crackles, and wheezing breath sounds Obvious x-ray evidence of pulmonary edema (greatly increased infiltrates and vascular engorgement)",

C: ASDFixed splitting denotes absence of significant variation of the splitting interval with respiration, such that the separation of A2, and P2, remains unchanged during inspiration and expiration.Atrial septal defect, with either normal or high pulmonary vascular resistance, is the classic example of fixed splitting of the second sound.The fixed nature of the split is due to approximately equal inspiratory delay of the aoic and pulmonic components, indicating that the two ventricles share a common venous reservoir. Respiratory splitting of the second sound immediately returns to normal following surgical repair of an atrial septa] defect, although the pulmonic closure sound may remain delayed for weeks or months.Severe right hea failure can lead to a relatively fixed split. This occurs because the right ventricle fails to respond to the increased volume produced by inspiration and because the lungs are so congested that impedance to forward flow from the right ventricle barely falls during inspiration.In anomalous pulmonary venous return without atrial septal defect, fixed splitting is not usually seen despite the simultaneous inspiratory delay in aoic and pulmonic closure",

In this, the function of E cadherin is lost either by mutational inactivation of E cadherin genes, by activation of beta catenin genes, or by inappropriate expression of the SNAIL and TWIST transcription factors which suppresses E cadherin expression.

'An unusual feature of CLL compared to other leukemias is that making the diagnosis is not necessarily an indication to initiate treatment' - DeVita Treatment need not be initiated as soon as diagnosis of CLL is established Early stage asymptomatic disease requires no treatment. CLL may be diagnosed in an asymptomatic patient and have a prolonged course. Meta-analysis has shown no survival advantage of initiating treatment in early stage disease. Active monitoring should however be pursued and treatment initiated only if and when the patient meets established 'criteria for treatment'. Criteria for treatment Progressive marrow failure Massive(>10cm)/progressive lymphadenopathy Massive (>6cm)/progressive splenomegaly Progressive lymphocytosis (doubling time <6 months) Systemic symptoms; Weight loss >10%in 6 months fever>38deg C for >2 weeks extreme fatigue or night sweats Autoimmune cytopenias (this may only require treatment of the autoimmune component not necessarily the leukaemia) Chlorambucil and Fludarabine are the most commonly used agents. The most common treatment for CLL are Chlorambucil or Fludarabine alone or in combination. Chlorambucil Can be administered orally and has few side effects Less active than Fludarabine and usually unsuccessful in achieving remission Most common agent chosen for treatment of elderly patients requiring therapy. (Majority of elderly patients have significant comorbid conditions associated with aging and may have an indolent disease) Fludarabine Administered intravenously and has significant side effects (Significant immune suppression) More active agent and by far the only drug associatedwith a significant incidence of complete remission Preferred agent for treatment of young patientsrequiring therapy Fludarabine is often used incombination with Cyclophosphamide (FC).Following theresults of LRF CC4 Trial many now consider FC to be thegold standard first Line treatment of CLL in the young Young patients are candidates for Bone marrow transplanatation Bendamustine is an alkylating agent structurally related to nitrogen mustards that is highly effective and is vying with fludarabine as the primary treatment of choice. Rituximab (AntiCD20) and Alemtuzumab (anti CD52) may also be used. `Young patients with CLL can be candidates for Allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Allogenic bone marrow transplantation can be urative but is associated with a significant treatment related moality rate' - Harrison",

Many patients also experience generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and up to one-third have absence seizures. Although complete remission is relatively uncommon, the seizures respond well to appropriate anticonvulsant medication.

Other epilepsy drugs are effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy: - LevetiracetamQ - TopiramateQ - LamotrigineQ For most people with JME, treatment is long-term, and often lifelongQ.

It usually affects middle-aged or elderly patients and most frequently arises in the cerebral white matter. GBM is a malignant astrocytoma; it is referred to as grade IV astrocytoma in the WHO classification and grade 4 astrocytoma in the St. Anne-Mayo grading system. This tumor is very aggressive; median survival is approximately 12-14 months following optimal treatment, ie, a combination of surgery and radiation therapy. Medulloblastoma, a much less frequent malignant tumor, affects children; it arises in the posterior fossa in this population. The histogenetic origin of this tumor is unceain, although it is thought to develop from immature cell precursors that give rise to glial and neuronal cells. Meningioma and pituitary adenoma are frequent but benign brain tumors that arise from meningothelial cells and endocrine cells of the adenohypophysis, respectively. Oligodendrogliomas constitute 5% of all primary brain tumors. Although most oligodendrogliomas have benign histologic features (e.g., low mitotic rate and mild nuclear atypia), their complete surgical excision is viually impossible owing to a diffuse, poorly circumscribed pattern of growth. This tumor allows a much longer survival (up to 7-10 years) than GBM, but eventually transforms into a malignant glioma indistinguishable from GBM. Ref: Ropper A.H., Samuels M.A. (2009). Chapter 31.

The gender ratio for Drug Induced Lupus mirrors the population receiving the drug in question whereas idiopathic SLE is typically more common in women. Differentiating Features Between Drug Induced Lupus and SLE The gender ratio for drug-induced LE is equal. Whereas for SLE it is clearly female predominant. Symptoms tend to be milder in Drug-Induced Lupus compared to SLE The clinical features of DIL are similar to those of late onset lupus Ahralgias, myalgias, fevers, and serositis are more common in DIL. In contrast, renal involvement, central nervous system disease, molar rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, and oral ulcers occur less frequently in DIL. Drug-induced LE is reversible after discontinuation of the drug . Presence of Renal or CNS disease is rare The presence of Hypocomplementemia is unusual (DIL tends to be characterized by normal complement levels -Dubois). The serological findings in Drug Induced Lupus are different and absence of Antibodies against Ds DNA is typical * Almost all patients with Drug Induced Lupus will test positive for Antinuclear Antibodies (Positive ANA Test) * The spectrum of Antinuclear antibodies in Drug Induced Lupus includes o Positive Antihistone antibodies (most common; not specific; also seen in SLE) o Positive autoantibodies against single stranded DNA (common ; not specific; also seen in SLE) o Negative (absence of) autoantibodies against double stranded DNA(dsDNA) * The presence of autoantibodies against dsDNA strongly suggests a diagnosis of SLE Drug Induced Lupus is typically associated with a Homogeneous ANA pattern due to the presence of Antihistone Antibodies",

Two dimensional electrophoresis, gene arrays (DNA chips), multidimensional protein identification technology (Mud PIT) employing successive rounds of chromatography are used to survey protein expression in proteomics. After 2D electrophoresis, individual polypeptides are extracted & analyzed by Edman sequencing or mass spectroscopy. Protein purity is most widely assessed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) - SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate). Isoelectric focusing (IEF) is used in conjunction with SDS-PAGE for 2D (two dimensional) electrophoresis, which seperates polypeptides based on pI on one dimension and molecular mass (Mr) in second. 2D electrophoresis is paicularly used for separating the components of complex mixtures of proteins.",

The lower circulating concentrations of 1, 25 (OH)2D may fuher aggravate the hypocalcemia by impairing intestinal absorption of calcium.Hyperphosphatemic-induced hypocalcemia inhibits vitamin D synthesis and results in an increase in PTH secretion. Secondary hyperparathyroidism from long-term hyperphosphatemia is usually associated with renal insufficiency. Treatment should be directed towards the hyperphosphatemia in order to correct the hypocalcemia.Hypophosphatemia is more severe than hypocalcemia in vitamin D deficiency states because of the increased secretion of PTH, which is only paly active in elevating blood calcium but is capable of phosphaturia.",

Benign vs. Malignant Nephrosclerosis Nephrosclerosis refers to the ischemic changes of the kidney arising from vascular diseases affecting the renal aeries, typically hypeension. Benign Nephrosclerosis represents a typical change in renal blood vessels as a consequence of chronic nonspecific hypeension. Pathological changes in Benign Nephrosclerosis are usually not significant enough to activate the Renin Angiotensin Pathway. Malignant nephrosclerosis is a more severe form of nephrosclerosis with unique lesions in the form of fibrinoid necrosis of the afferent aerioles that can lead to renal ischemia. This activates the renin angiotensin pathway which in turn raises the blood pressure even more. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system could be a critical step in the transition from benign to malignant nephrosclerosis. Malignant nephrosclerosis is accompanied by increased production of renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone Hypeension in Haemolytic Uremic Syndrome is often renin mediated (Increased Renin) Hypeension in the acute phase of HUS is usually volume related while in the later stages it is often produced as a result of increased renin levels Juxtaglomerular Cell Tumours are associated with high renin levels Juxtaglomerular cell tumours may produce excess renin directly and cause hypeension without affecting renal circulation",

Neveheless low dose aspirin is of definite benefit in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. SLE is thus the single best answer of exclusion here. Low dose aspirin therapy markedly decreases thromboxane production but only paially blocks prostocyclin and prostaglandin E2 production. Pre-ecalmpsia: In preeclamptic woman, thromboxane is increased and prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin are decreased, resulting in vasoconstriction and sensitivity to infused angiotensin II. Low dose aspirin as explained above enhances concentration of vasodilating prostanoids and restores refractoriness to infused angitensin II. Post MI: No confusions on this one. Low dose aspirin is advised to such patients. IUGR: Early antiplatelet therapy with low dose aspirin may prevent uteroplacental thrombosis, placental infarction, and idiopathic fetal growth retardation in women with a history of recurrent severe fetal growth restriction. -Williams 20`\"/ 849 Fuher Williams 21st/1212 says: \"Low dose aspirin & Dipyridamole are beneficial in reducing incidence of superimposed preeclampsia & growth restriction\". SLE: Ahralgias, ahritis, myalgias, fever and, mild serositis may improve on NSAID's including salicyclates. However there appears no rationale of using low dose aspirin therapy for the same.

D: 20 petechiae per square inch Dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are acute febrile diseases and caused by four closely related virus serotypes of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. Dengue is transmitted to humans by the Aedes aegypti (rarely Aedes albopictus) mosquito, which feeds during the day. This infectious disease is manifested by a sudden onset of fever, with severe headache, muscle and joint pains (myalgias and ahralgias -- severe pain gives it the name break-bone fever or bonecrusher disease) and rashes. The dengue rash is characteristically bright red petechiae and usually appears first on the lower limbs and the chest; in some patients, it spreads to cover most of the body. The classic dengue fever lasts about six to seven days, with a smaller peak of fever at the trailing end of the disease (the so-called \"biphasic pattern\"). Cases of DHF also show higher fever, haemorrhagic phenomena, thrombocytopenia, and haemoconcentration. A small propoion of cases lead to dengue shock syndrome (DSS) which has a high moality rate. The classic picture is high fever with no localising source of infection, a petechial rash with thrombocytopenia and relative leukopenia. The WHO criteria of dengue haemorrhagic fever; all four criteria must be fulfilled: Fever, bladder problem, constant headaches, severe dizziness and loss of appetite. Hemorrhagic tendency (positive tourniquet test, spontaneous bruising, bleeding from mucosa, gingiva, injection sites, etc.; vomiting blood, or bloody diarrhea) Thrombocytopenia (3or estimated as less than 3 platelets per high power field) Evidence of plasma leakage (hematocrit more than 20% higher than expected, or drop in haematocrit of 20% or more from baseline following IV fluid, pleural effusion, ascites, hypoproteinemia) A tourniquet test/ Rumpel-Leede Capillary-Fragility Test/capillary fragility test determines capillary fragility. The test is defined by the WHO as one of the necessary requisites for diagnosis of Dengue fever. A Mood pressure cuff is applied and inflated to a point between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures for five minutes. The test is positive if there are more than 20 petechiae per square inch.

This results in the formation of glycosylated hemoglobin. Since the half-life of an erythrocyte is typically 120 days, the level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reflects the mean blood glucose concentration over the preceding 2-3 months. Measurement of HbA1c therefore provides valuable information for management of diabetes mellitus.
