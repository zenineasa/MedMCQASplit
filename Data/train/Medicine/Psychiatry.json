        "exp": "Ans. c. Panic disorder. It is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks. Two to three times more common in women than in men. Agoraphobia is present in 30-50% of cases. The average age of onset is 25, but may occur at any age. HISTORY/PE: Panic attacks are defined as discrete periods of intense fear or discomfort in which at least four of the following symptoms develop abruptly and peak within 10 minutes: tachypnea, chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, nausea, trembling, dizziness, fear of dying or \"going crazy, \" depersonalization, or hot ashes. Perioral and/or acral paresthesias, when present, are fairly specific to panic attacks, which produce hyperventilation and low O2 saturation. Patients present with 1 or more months of concern about having additional attacks or significant behavior change as a result of the attacks--e. g., avoiding situations that may precipitate attacks. Determine whether a patient has panic disorder with or without agoraphobia so that agoraphobia can also be addressed in the treatment plan. TREATMENTShort-term therapy: Benzodiazepines (e. g., clonazepam) may be used for immediate relief, but long-term use should be avoided in light of the potential for addiction and tolerance. Taper benzodiazepines as soon as long-term treatment is initiated (eg, SSRIs). Long-term therapy: CBTMedications: SSRIs (First-line therapy), TCAs.",
