Treatment of an acute attack consists of simple analgesia with aspirin, paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Nausea may require an antiemetic such as metoclopramide or domperidone. Severe attacks can be aboed by one of the 'triptans' (e. g. sumatriptan), which are potent 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) agonists. These can be administered the oral, subcutaneous or nasal route. Caution is needed with ergotamine preparations because they may lead to dependence. Overuse of any analgesia, including triptans, may contribute to medication overuse headache. If attacks are frequent (more than two per month), prophylaxis should be considered. Many drugs can be chosen but the most frequently used are vasoactive drugs (b-blockers), antidepressants (amitriptyline, dosulepin) and antiepileptic drugs (valproate, topiramate).

Predisposing conditions include trauma, surgery, starvation, high intake of beer and hard liquor (not wine), or diets high in meat and seafood. Certain medications also increase the chances of acute gout including thiazide and loop diuretics and even the initiation of uric acid lowering drugs such as allopurinol and uricosuric agents. Appropriate initial treatment must be tailored to the patient and their comorbidities. The patient in this question has no contraindication, so a potent NSAID (indomethacin) can be used and is likely to be highly effective. Other acceptable alternatives would have been to start colchicine immediately or oral prednisone in relatively high doses. Since this patient is \"prediabetic, \" steroids may result in overt hyperglycemia and hence would not be the first choice. Allopurinol should not be started until the acute attack has been controlled by anti-inflammatory regimens. All agents that lower uric acid levels (either allopurinol or uricosuric agents) can cause worsening of joint pain, probably by mobilizing uric acid microcrystals previously deposited in the synovial membrane.

Porphura actually means \"purple pigment\", which, in suggestion, the color that the body fluid changes when a person has Gunther's disease. It is a rare, autosomal recessive metabolic disorder affecting heme, caused by deficiency of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen cosynthetase. It is extremely rare, with a prevalence estimated at 1 in 1, 000, 000 or less There have been times that prior to bih of a fetus, Gunther's disease has been shown to lead to anemia. In milder cases patients have not presented any symptoms until they have reached adulthood. In Gunther's disease, porphyrins are accumulated in the teeth and bones and an increased amount are seen in the plasma, bone marrow, feces, red blood cells, and urine. Though expressivity is varied depending on the mutation responsible for decrease in enzyme function, severe cutaneous sensitivity is present in most cases of this Porphyria. An estimated 30-40% of cases are due to the C73R mutation, which decreases stability of the enzyme and results in <1% of its activity. Exposure to long-wave ultraviolet light causes the affected skin to thicken and produce vesicles that are prone to rupture and infection; these secondary infections, along with bone resorption, can lead to disfigurement of the sun-exposed face and extremities. Enzyme dysfunction prevents the normal production of heme and hemolytic anemia is another common symptom, though a lack of hemolysis in this disease is possible. Porphyrins additionally accumulate in the bone and teeth, resulting in erythrodontia. When unexpected attacks occur, abdominal pain, as well as vomiting and constipation commonly follow the attacks.

X-linked dominant traits do not necessarily affect males more than females (unlike X-linked recessive traits). The exact pattern of inheritance varies, depending on whether the father or the mother has the trait of interest. All fathers that are affected by an X-linked dominant disorder will have affected daughters but not affected sons. However, if the mother is also affected then sons will have a chance of being affected, depending on whether a dominant or recessive X chromosome is passed on. When the son is affected, the mother will always be affected. Some scholars have suggested discontinuing the terms dominant and recessive when referring to X-linked inheritance due to the multiple mechanisms that can result in the expression of X-linked traits in females, which include cell autonomous expression, skewed X-inactivation, clonal expansion and somatic mosaicism the X chromosome is one of the sex chromosomes (the other being the Y chromosome), X-linked inheritance is determined by the sex of the parent carrying a specific gene and can often seem complex. This is due to the fact that, typically, females have two copies of the X-chromosome, while males have only one copy. The difference between dominant and recessive inheritance patterns also plays a role in determining the chances of a child inheriting an X-linked disorder from their parentage. Males can only get an X chromosome from their mother whilst females get an X chromosome from both parents. As a result, females tend to show higher prevalence of X-linked dominant disorders because they have more of a chance to inherit a faulty X chromosome Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 945",

        "exp": "Skeletal fluorosis is a bone disease caused by excessive accumulation of fluoride in the bones. In advanced cases, skeletal fluorosis causes painful damage to bones and joints. Symptoms are mainly promoted in the bone structure. Due to a high fluoride concentration in the body, the bone is hardened and thus less elastic, resulting in an increased frequency of fractures. Other symptoms include thickening of the bone structure and accumulation of bone tissue, which both contribute to impaired joint mobility. Ligaments and cailage can become ossified. Most patients suffering from skeletal fluorosis show side effects from the high fluoride dose such as ruptures of the stomach lining and nausea. Fluoride can also damage the parathyroid glands, leading to hyperparathyroidism, the uncontrolled secretion of parathyroid hormones. These hormones regulate calcium concentration in the body. An elevated parathyroid hormone concentration results in a depletion of calcium in bone structures and thus a higher calcium concentration in the blood. As a result, bone flexibility decreases making the bone more susceptible to fractures Mechanism of action The best way to view the mechanism of action by which fluorine breaks down bones and causes skeletal fluorosis is in a stepwise fashion. Fluoride enters the body by two paths: Ingestion or respiration. Both paths lead to corrosion of exposed tissue in high concentrations. Since the most likely form of fluoride to enter the body is hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas, this is what stas the process. Exposed tissues will be utilized by HF in neutralization reactions. This will leave F- free to pass fuher into the body. It reacts with the concentrated HCl in the stomach to form the weak acid, HF. This compound is then absorbed by the gastro-intestinal tract and passes into the liver the poal vein. Since elemental F is one of the strongest oxidizers currently known, the anion F- is immune to phase 1 metabolic reactions, which are generally oxidation reactions, in the liver. These reactions are the body's first line of defense to biotransform harmful compounds into something more hydrophilic and more easily excreted. The HF is now free to pass into the blood stream and be distributed to all tissues including bones. Bones are largely composed of Ca compounds, paicularly carbonated hydroxyapatite (Ca 5(PO 4) 3(OH)); the reaction of Ca2+ ions and HF forms an insoluble salt, CaF 2. This salt must be cleared by the body, which concomitantly leaches out some of the calcium that would be pa of the bone matrix. This process results in increased density, but decreased strength in bones As of now, there are no established treatments for skeletal fluorosis patients. However, it is reversible in some cases, depending on the progression of the disease. If fluorine intake is stopped, the amount in bone will decrease and be excreted urine. However, it is a very slow process to eliminate the fluorine from the body completely. Minimal results are seen in patients. Treatment of side effects is also very difficult. For example, a patient with a bone fracture cannot be treated according to standard procedures, because the bone is very brittle. In this case, recovery will take a very long time and a pristine healing cannot be guaranteed. However, fuher fluorosis can be prevented by drinking defluoridated water. It is recently suggested that drinking of defluoridated water from the ''calcium amended-hydroxyapatite'' defluoridation method may help in the fluorosis reversal. Defluoridated water from this suggested method provides calcium-enriched alkaline drinking water as generally fluoride contaminated water has a low amount of calcium mineral and drinking alkaline water helps in eliminating the toxic fluoride from the body Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 715",

Treatment interventions at early stages of diabetic retinopathy can reduce burden of blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. With the available cost-effective methods of early screening, appropriate strategies/models need to be developed.> Diabetic retinopathy has no early warning signs.> Macular edema, which can cause rapid vision loss, may not have any warning signs for some time. A person with macular edema is likely to have blurred vision, making it hard to do things like read or drive and in some cases, the vision will get better or worse during the day.> Diagnosis of Diabetic retinopathy is detected during an eye examination that includes: Visual acuity test: This test uses an eye chart to measure how well a person sees at various distances (i. e., visual acuity). Pupil dilation: The eye care professional places drops into the eye to dilate the pupil. This allows him or her to see more of the retina and look for signs of diabetic retinopathy. After the examination, close-up vision may remain blurred for several hours. Ophthalmoscopy:(1) Looks through a slit lamp biomicroscope with a special magnifying lens that provides a narrow view of the retina, or(2) Wearing a headset (indirect ophthalmoscope) with a bright light, looks through a special magnifying glass and gains a wide view of the retina. Hand-held ophthalmoscopy is insufficient to rule out significant and treatable diabetic retinopathy. Fundus photography generally captures considerably larger areas of the fundus, and has the advantage of photo documentation for future reference, as well as availing the image to be examined by a specialist at another location and/or time. Fundus Fluorescein angiography (FFA): This is an imaging technique which relies on the circulation of Fluorescein dye to show staining, leakage, or non-perfusion of the retinal and choroidal vasculature. Optical coherence tomography (OCT): This is an optical imaging modality based upon interference, and analogous to ultra- sound. It produces cross-sectional images of the retina (B-scans) which can be used to measure the thickness of the retina.",

Factitious disorder by proxy is a condition in which a person deliberately produces, feigns, or exaggerates symptoms in a person who is in their care. Munchausen syndrome is an older term for Factitious disorder. People with this condition may produce symptoms by contaminating urine samples, taking hallucinogens, injecting themselves with bacteria to produce infections, and other such similar behaviour. They might be motivated to perpetrate factitious disorders either as a patient or by proxy as a caregiver to gain any variety of benefits including attention, nurturance, sympathy, and leniency that are unobtainable any other way. Somatoform disorders are characterised by multiple somatic complaints. Conversion disorder is a condition in which you show psychological stress in physical ways. The condition was so named to describe a health problem that starts as a mental or emotional crisis -- a scary or stressful incident of some kind -- and converts to a physical problem. Malingering is a medical term that refers to fabricating or exaggerating the symptoms of mental or physical disorders for a variety of \"secondary gain\" motives, which may include financial compensation (often tied to fraud); avoiding school, work or military service; obtaining drugs; getting lighter criminal sentences; or simply to attract attention or sympathy. Dissociation is an altered state of consciousness characterized by partial or complete disruption of the normal integration of a person's normal conscious or psychological functioning.

The inflammation may affect blood supply to the eye and blurred vision or sudden blindness may occur. In 76% of cases involving the eye, the ophthalmic artery is involved causing arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Loss of vision in both eyes may occur very abruptly and this disease is therefore a medical emergency. Laboratory tests: LFTs, liver function tests, are abnormal particularly raised ALP- alkaline phosphatase> Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an inflammatory marker, >60 mm/hour (normal 10-40 mm/hour), but may be normal in approximately 20% of cases.> C-reactive protein, another inflammatory marker, is also commonly elevated.> Platelets may also be elevated. Biopsy: The gold standard for diagnosing temporal arteritis is biopsy, which involves removing a small part of the vessel and examining it microscopically for giant cells infiltrating the tissue. Treatment: Corticosteroids, typically high-dose prednisone (40-60 mg. once daily), must be started as soon as the diagnosis is suspected (even before the diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy) to prevent irreversible blindness secondary to ophthalmic artery occlusion.",

        "exp": "Alcoholism, also known as alcohol use disorder (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. The disorder was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions are present: a person drinks large amounts of alcohol over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex, among other things. Alcohol use can affect all pas of the body, but it paicularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, irregular heabeat, an impaired immune response, liver cirrhosis and increased cancer risk, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Women are generally more sensitive than men to the harmful physical and mental effects of alcohol. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0. 03-0. 12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria (a \"happy\" feeling), increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and hyperigycerdemia isnot a feature of alcoholism impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0. 09% to 0. 25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC of 0. 18% to 0. 30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e. g. slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0. 25% to 0. 40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0. 35% to 0. 80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. With all alcoholic beverages, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties for drunk driving.

        "exp": "Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins, known as amyloid fibrils, build up in tissue. Symptoms depend on the type and are often variable. They may include diarrhea, weight loss, feeling tired, enlargement of the tongue, bleeding, numbness, feeling faint with standing, swelling of the legs, or enlargement of the spleen There are about 30 different types of amyloidosis, each due to a specific protein misfolding. Some are genetic while others are acquired. They are grouped into localized and systemic forms. The four most common types of systemic disease are light chain (AL), inflammation (AA), dialysis (Ab2M), and hereditary and old age (ATTR). Diagnosis may be suspected when protein is found in the urine, organ enlargement is present, or problems are found with multiple peripheral nerves and it is unclear why. Diagnosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy. Due to the variable presentation, a diagnosis can often take some time to reach. Treatment is geared towards decreasing the amount of the involved protein. This may sometimes be achieved by determining and treating the underlying cause. AL amyloidosis occurs in about 3-13 per million people per year and AA amyloidosis in about 2 per million people per year. The usual age of onset of these two types is 55 to 60 years old. Without treatment, life expectancy is between six months and four years. In the developed world about 1 per 1, 000 people die from amyloidosis. Amyloidosis has been described since at least 1639 Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 936",

Left-right disorientation> Causes: This disorder is often associated with brain lesions in the dominant (usually left) hemisphere including the angular and supramarginal gyri near the temporal and parietal lobe junction. There is significant debate in the scientific literature as to whether Gerstmann Syndrome truly represents a unified, theoretically motivated syndrome. Thus its diagnostic utility has been questioned by neurologists and neuropsychologists alike. The angular gyrus is generally involved in translating visual patterns of letter and words into meaningful information, such as is done while reading.> In adults: the syndrome may occur after a stroke or in association with damage to the parietal lobe.> In addition to exhibiting the above symptoms, many adults also experience aphasia, which is a difficulty in expressing oneself when speaking, in understanding speech, or in reading and writing.> In children: There are few reports of the syndrome, sometimes called developmental Gerstmann syndrome, in children. The cause is not known. Most cases are identified when children reach school age, a time when they are challenged with writing and math exercises. Generally, children with the disorder exhibit poor handwriting and spelling skills, and difficulty with math functions, including adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. An inability to differentiate right from left and to discriminate among individual fingers may also be apparent. In addition to the four primary symptoms, many children also suffer from constructional apraxia, an inability to copy simple drawings. Frequently, there is also an impairment in reading. Children with a high level of intellectual functioning as well as those with brain damage may be affected with the disorder.> Treatment: There is no cure for Gerstmann syndrome. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Occupational and speech therapies may help diminish the dysgraphia and apraxia. In addition, calculators and word processors may help school children cope with the symptoms of the disorder.> Prognosis: In adults, many of the symptoms diminish over time. Although it has been suggested that in children symptoms may diminish over time, it appears likely that most children probably do not overcome their deficits, but learn to adjust to them.",

There are three investigations to consider: temporal aery biopsy, ultrasound of the temporal aeries and 19fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (19. FDG PET scan). Characteristic biopsy findings are fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina with necrosis of the media in combination with a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate. Diagnostic yield is highest with multiple biopsies and multiple section analysis (to detect 'skip' lesions). A negative biopsy does not exclude the diagnosis. On ultrasound examination, affected temporal aeries show a 'halo' sign. A strongly positive 19. FDG PET scan is highly specific but sensitivity is low.

        "exp": "Hypothermia is defined as a body core temperature below 35. 0 degC (95. 0 degF) in humans. Symptoms depend on the temperature. In mild hypothermia there is shivering and mental confusion In moderate hypothermia shivering stops and confusion increases. In severe hypothermia, there may be paradoxical undressing, in which a person removes their clothing, as well as an increased risk of the heart stopping Hypothermia has two main types of causes. It classically occurs from exposure to extreme cold. It may also occur from any condition that decreases heat production or increases heat loss. Commonly this includes alcohol intoxication but may also include low blood sugar, anorexia, and advanced age. Body temperature is usually maintained near a constant level of 36. 5-37. 5 degC (97. 7-99. 5 degF) through thermoregulation. Effos to increase body temperature involve shivering, increased voluntary activity, and putting on warmer clothing. Hypothermia may be diagnosed based on either a person's symptoms in the presence of risk factors or by measuring a person's core temperature. The treatment of mild hypothermia involves warm drinks, warm clothing, and physical activity. In those with moderate hypothermia, heating blankets and warmed intravenous fluids are recommended. People with moderate or severe hypothermia should be moved gently. In severe hypothermia, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass may be useful. In those without a pulse, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is indicated along with the above measures. Rewarming is typically continued until a person's temperature is greater than 32 degC (90 degF). If there is no improvement at this point or the blood potassium level is greater than 12 mmol/liter at any time, resuscitation may be discontinued As the temperature decreases, fuher physiological systems falter and heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure all decrease. This results in an expected heart rate in the 30s at a temperature of 28 degC (82 degF). There is often no shivering, cold, inflamed skin, hallucinations, lack of reflexes, fixed dilated pupils, low blood pressure, and pulmonary edema. Pulse and respiration rates decrease significantly, but fast heart rates (ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation) can also occur.

Low Ca2+ buffering in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) vulnerable hypoglossal MNs exposes mitochondria to higher Ca2+ loads compared to highly buffered cells. Linder normal physiological conditions, the neurotransmitter opens glutamate, NMDA and AMPA receptor channels, and voltage dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC) with high glutamate release, which is taken up again by EAAT1 and EAAT2.> This results in a small rise in intracellular calcium that can be buffered in the cell. In ALS, a disorder in the glutamate recep- tor channels leads to high calcium conductivity, resulting in high Ca2+ loads and increased risk for mitochondrial damage. This triggers the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which then inhibit glial EAAT2 function.> Excitotoxicity is the pathological process by which nerve cells are damaged and killed by glutamate and similar substances. This occurs when receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (glutamate receptors) such as the NMDA receptor and AMPA receptor are overactivated. Excitotoxins like NMDA and kainic acid which bind to these receptors, as we I as pathologically high levels of glutamate, can cause excitotoxicity by allowing high levels of calcium ions (Ca2+) to enter the cell. Ca2+ influx into cells activates a number of enzymes, including phospholipases, endonucleases, and proteases such as calpain. These enzymes go on to damage cell structures such as components of the cytoskeleton, membrane, and DNA.> Excitotoxicity may be involved in spinal cord injury, stroke, traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) such as Multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, Alcoholism or alcohol withdrawal and Huntington's disease.

Moreover, significant reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and moality has occurred. Recently, large randomized clinical studies suggested that administration of Epo targeting at complete anemia correction is accompanied by significant increase of morbidity and moality, compared to paial anemia correction. This observation has led to thorough investigation of the mechanisms of Epo actions and the possible contribution of other parameters including iron availability, comorbidities and resistance or hyporesponsiveness to Epo. In this context, it has been proposed that high doses of Epo are likely to exe toxic effects and pleiotropic systemic actions.

The cerebrospinal fluid is usually normal or may show increased protein with increased GABA levels.> The concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in peripheral venous blood were significantly elevated in patients with hepatic encephalopathy caused by cirrhosis> Ammonia is the substance most often incriminated in the pathogenesis of encephalopathy.> Many, but not all, patients with hepatic encephalopathy have elevated blood ammonia levels, and recovery from encephalopathy is often accompanied by declining blood ammonia levels.> Other compounds and metabolites that may contribute to the development of encephalopathy include mercaptans (derived from intestinal metabolism of methionine), short-chain fatty acids, and phenol.> False neurochemical transmitters (e. g., octopamine), resulting in part from alterations in plasma levels of aromatic and branched- chain amino acids, may also play a role.> An increase in the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to some of these substances may be an additional factor involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy.> Several observations suggest that excessive concentrations of y-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, in the CNS are important in the reduced levels of consciousness seen in hepatic encephalopathy.> Increased CNS GABA may reflect failure of the liver to extract precursor amino acids efficiently or to remove GABA produced in the intestine.",
