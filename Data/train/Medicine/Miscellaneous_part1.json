Treatment of an acute attack consists of simple analgesia with aspirin, paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Nausea may require an antiemetic such as metoclopramide or domperidone. Severe attacks can be aboed by one of the 'triptans' (e. g. sumatriptan), which are potent 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) agonists. These can be administered the oral, subcutaneous or nasal route. Caution is needed with ergotamine preparations because they may lead to dependence. Overuse of any analgesia, including triptans, may contribute to medication overuse headache. If attacks are frequent (more than two per month), prophylaxis should be considered.

Factors contributing to muscle weakness in adrenal insufficiency include circulatory insufficiency, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, impaired carbohydrate metabolism, and starvation. The etiologies of hyperadrenalism include pituitary or ectopic overproduction of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), adrenal tumors, or exogenous corticosteroid administration. Pituitary ACTH hypersecretion (i. e., Cushing's disease) is caused by a corticotroph macroadenomas in 90% of patients and by a macroadenoma in most of the rest.> Hypoparathyroidism causes tetany, with or without carpopedal spasm.> Pathophysiology of Hypoparathyroidism may involve either deficiency of parathyroid hormone or inability of the hormone to have an effect at end-receptors because of dysfunction of the hormone receptors.> Hyperparathyroidism does not cause tetany but results in muscle wasting and myopathy (i. e., proximal muscle weakness). The pathophysiology is over secretion of hormone, frequently from a parathyroid adenoma.> Myasthenia gravis: Fluctuating weakness of commonly used voluntary muscles, producing, symptoms such as diplopia ptosis and difficulty in swallowing. Weakness of affected muscle increased by activity. Associated with thymic tumor or thyrotoxicosis and rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus.

Pupil dilation: The eye care professional places drops into the eye to dilate the pupil. This allows him or her to see more of the retina and look for signs of diabetic retinopathy. After the examination, close-up vision may remain blurred for several hours. Ophthalmoscopy:(1) Looks through a slit lamp biomicroscope with a special magnifying lens that provides a narrow view of the retina, or(2) Wearing a headset (indirect ophthalmoscope) with a bright light, looks through a special magnifying glass and gains a wide view of the retina. Hand-held ophthalmoscopy is insufficient to rule out significant and treatable diabetic retinopathy.

        "exp": "Alcoholism, also known as alcohol use disorder (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. The disorder was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions are present: a person drinks large amounts of alcohol over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex, among other things. Alcohol use can affect all pas of the body, but it paicularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, irregular heabeat, an impaired immune response, liver cirrhosis and increased cancer risk, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Women are generally more sensitive than men to the harmful physical and mental effects of alcohol. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0. 03-0. 12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria (a \"happy\" feeling), increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and hyperigycerdemia isnot a feature of alcoholism impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0. 09% to 0. 25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC of 0. 18% to 0. 30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e. g. slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0. 25% to 0. 40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0. 35% to 0. 80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. With all alcoholic beverages, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties for drunk driving.

The mechanism of action for this agent, originally marketed as an antidepressant, is thought to be due to its capacity to block neural reuptake of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, reducing cravings for nicotine and symptoms of withdrawal. Patients should initiate bupropion therapy 1 to 2 weeks before their quit date, staing with 150 mg once a day for 2 days, then increasing to 150 mg twice a day.

        "exp": "Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins, known as amyloid fibrils, build up in tissue. Symptoms depend on the type and are often variable. They may include diarrhea, weight loss, feeling tired, enlargement of the tongue, bleeding, numbness, feeling faint with standing, swelling of the legs, or enlargement of the spleen There are about 30 different types of amyloidosis, each due to a specific protein misfolding. Some are genetic while others are acquired. They are grouped into localized and systemic forms. The four most common types of systemic disease are light chain (AL), inflammation (AA), dialysis (Ab2M), and hereditary and old age (ATTR). Diagnosis may be suspected when protein is found in the urine, organ enlargement is present, or problems are found with multiple peripheral nerves and it is unclear why. Diagnosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy. Due to the variable presentation, a diagnosis can often take some time to reach. Treatment is geared towards decreasing the amount of the involved protein. This may sometimes be achieved by determining and treating the underlying cause. AL amyloidosis occurs in about 3-13 per million people per year and AA amyloidosis in about 2 per million people per year. The usual age of onset of these two types is 55 to 60 years old. Without treatment, life expectancy is between six months and four years. In the developed world about 1 per 1, 000 people die from amyloidosis.

There are three investigations to consider: temporal aery biopsy, ultrasound of the temporal aeries and 19fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (19. FDG PET scan). Characteristic biopsy findings are fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina with necrosis of the media in combination with a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate. Diagnostic yield is highest with multiple biopsies and multiple section analysis (to detect 'skip' lesions). A negative biopsy does not exclude the diagnosis. On ultrasound examination, affected temporal aeries show a 'halo' sign. A strongly positive 19. FDG PET scan is highly specific but sensitivity is low.

The overall analysis showed an increased risk of cancer in patients with gout. As well, there was an increased risk of urological and of digestive cancers in gout. There was a moderate increased risk of lung cancer in patients with gout, but no increased risk of breast or of brain cancer was seen in patients with gout.

The drug is bactericidal to slowly metabolizing organisms located within the acidic environment of the phagocyte or caseous granuloma; it is active only at a pH of <6. 0. Pyrazinamide is considered a prodrug and is converted by the tubercle bacillus to the active form pyrazinoic acid. The target for this compound is thought to be a fatty acid synthase gene.

        "exp": "erythropoietin (Epo) in clinical practice, more than two decades ago, altered completely the management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The successful correction of anemia of CKD has resulted in reduction of associated morbidity and improvement of functionality, exercise tolerance, cognitive function and overall quality of life. Moreover, significant reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and moality has occurred. Recently, large randomized clinical studies suggested that administration of Epo targeting at complete anemia correction is accompanied by significant increase of morbidity and moality, compared to paial anemia correction. This observation has led to thorough investigation of the mechanisms of Epo actions and the possible contribution of other parameters including iron availability, comorbidities and resistance or hyporesponsiveness to Epo. In this context, it has been proposed that high doses of Epo are likely to exe toxic effects and pleiotropic systemic actions. Recognition of the extra-hematopoietic biologic actions of erythropoietin is a result of the better understanding of its interaction with Epo receptors in several tissues and organ systems, during fetal development as well as in the adult organism.
