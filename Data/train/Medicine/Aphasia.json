It is impoverished in function words but enriched in meaning-appropriate nouns. Abnormal word order and the inappropriate deployment of bound morphemes (word endings used to denote tenses, possessives, or plurals) lead to a characteristic agrammatism. Speech is telegraphic & pithy but quite informativeQ. In the following passage, a patient with Broca's aphasia describes his medical history: \"I see... the dotor, dotor sent me... Bosson. Go to hospital. Dotor... kept me beside. Two, tee days, doctor send me home. ''Output may be reduced to a grunt or single word (\"yes\" or \"no\"), which is emitted with different intonations in an attempt to express approval or disapproval. In addition to fluency, naming & repetition are impairedQ. Comprehension of spoken language is intact except for syntactically difficult sentences with a passive voice structure or embedded clauses, indicating that Broca's aphasia is not just an \"expressive\" or \"motor\" disorder and that it also may involve a comprehension deficit in decoding syntax. Even when spontaneous speech is severely dysarthric, the patient may be able to display a relatively normal articulation of words when singing. This dissociation has been used to develop specific therapeutic approaches (melodic intonation therapy) for Broca's aphasiaQ. Causes of Broca's Aphasia: The cause is most often infarction of Broca's area (inferior frontal convolution) & surrounding anterior perisylvian & insular cortex due to occlusion of superior division of middle cerebral arteryQ. Mass lesions, including tumor, intracerebral hemorrhage & abscess, also may be responsible. Associated features: Patients with Broca's aphasia can be tearful, easily frustrated & profoundly depressed. Additional neurologic deficits: Right facial weakness, hemiparesis or hemiplegia & buccofacial apraxia characterized by an inability to carry out motor commands involving orophary ngeal and facial musculature. Insight into their condition is preserved, in contrast to Wernicke's aphasiaQ. Prognosis: When the cause of Broca's aphasia is stroke, recovery of language function generally peaks within 2 to 6 months, after which time further progress is Limited. Speech therapy is more successful than in Wernicke's aphasia",
