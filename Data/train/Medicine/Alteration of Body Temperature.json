Such water feels warm but not hot to an unaffected hand. o Tetanus prophylaxis and early, aggressive treatment of possible infection should be provided. o In patients at high risk for life-altering amputation (eg, multiple digits, proximal amputation), without contraindications to the use of t. PA, who present within 24 hours of injury, we suggest treatment with intraarterial t. PA plus intra-arterial heparin in consultation with a center experienced in the use of such treatment for frostbite. Clinicians must discuss the relative risks and benefits of thrombolytic treatment with the patient and obtain informed consent. Treatment with thrombolytics assumes the patient is willing to accept a small risk of potentially catastrophic bleeding in return for a greater likelihood of retaining functional digits or limbs.",

Accidental hypothermia occurs when there is an unintentional drop in the body's core temperature below 35degC (95degF).
