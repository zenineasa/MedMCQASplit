Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare diffuse degenerative disease that usually affects people in their 50s, and the usual course is about one year. The terminal stage is characterized by severe dementia, generalized hypeonicity, and profound speech disturbances. It is one of several diseases presumably caused by prions. Huntington disease is a hereditary disease associated with progressive degeneration of the basal ganglia and the cerebral coex. It is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern. The onset of Huntington disease occurs between 35 and 50 years of age, or later in rare cases. This disease is characterized by progressive dementia, muscular hypeonicity, and bizarre choreiform movements. Parkinson disease is characterized primarily by motor dysfunction, but dementia may be a pa of the disorder.

Whereas older patients do better better with antithymocyte globulin given in combination with cyclosporine. In older patients transplantation is preferred if granulocytopenia is found. Increasing age and the severity of neutropenia are the most impoant factors weighing in the decision between transplant and immunosuppression in adults who have a matched family donor: For allogeneic transplant from fully matched siblings, long-term survival rates for children are approximately 90%. Transplant morbidity and moality are increased among adults, due mainly to the higher risk of chronic GVHD and serious infections. The standard regimen of ATG in combination with cyclosporine induces hematologic recovery in 60% of patients. Improvement in granulocyte number is generally apparent within 2 months of treatment.

Hemoglobin S is unstable and polymerizes during hypoxemia and acidosis, leading to sickling of red blood cells. Patients develops jaundice, pigmented gallstones, spleenomegaly, and poorly healing ulcers over the lower tibia. Acute painful episodes can occur due to acute vaso-occlusion by clusters of sickled red cells during infection, dehydration, or hypoxia. Common sites of acute painful episodes include the bones and the chest.

Other causes of lung cancer include the following: Passive smoking, or secondhand smoke, presents another risk for lung cancer. Air pollution from motor vehicles, factories, and other sources probably increase the risk for lung cancer. Asbestos exposure increases the risk of lung cancer nine times. A combination of asbestos exposure and cigarette smoking raises the risk to as much as 50 times. Another cancer known as mesothelioma (a type of cancer of the lining of the chest cavity called the pleura or of the lining of the abdominal cavity called the peritoneum) is also strongly associated with exposure to asbestos. Lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also create a risk for lung cancer. A person with COPD has a four to six times greater risk of lung cancer even when the effect of cigarette smoking is excluded. Radon exposure poses another risk. Radon is a by-product of naturally occurring radium, which is a product of uranium. Silicosis is associated with pulmonary fibrosis. X-ray of chest shows rounded opacities in the upper lobes after 15-20 years (simple silicosis). Calcification of hilar nodes may produce 'eggshell' pattern.

This leads to accumulation of copper initially in the liver and subsequently in plasma and other systems once liver is saturated. Serum ceruloplasmin is the main copper binding protein in the blood and once excess copper spills into the blood, levels of free ceruloplasmin are decreased.

Aerial blood gases lack diagnostic utility for PE, even though both PO2 and Pco2 often decrease. Ref: Harrisons Principles of Medicine, 18th Edition, Chapter 262, Pages 2172-73",

Radiographic studies show a tumor in the pancreas. Which of the following cells is responsible for this lesion?",
        "exp": "The symptoms described are typical for a patient with glucagon excess. Glucagon is secreted by alpha cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Increased levels are rare, usually due to carcinoma (70%) or adenoma (30%) of the islets. Two-thirds of patients with carcinoma have liver metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Increased glucagon causes a syndrome similar to diabetes mellitus, due to antagonism of insulin effects. Patients also have migratory skin rashes, alopecia, hyperpigmentation of the skin, and glossitis. Diagnosis is made by measuring glucagon. The acinar cell, the main exocrine cell of the pancreas, contains digestive enzymes. Increases in the release of these enzymes (especially amylase and lipase) occur with pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is considered an emergent medical condition. Chronic pancreatitis is associated with fibrosis and atrophy of the acinar structures. Beta cells are responsible for insulin release. An adenoma of beta cells (insulinoma) would cause hyperinsulinism. 70% are solitary and 10% are multiple. Insulinomas cause hypoglycemia, dizziness, confusion, and excessive sweating. Glucose needs to be given promptly to avoid coma and death. Diagnosis is made by finding increased insulin and hypoglycemia. Delta cells are islet cells that secrete somatostatin. Tumors producing increased somatostatin are usually malignant. Clinically, a diabetes mellitus-like syndrome occurs along with diarrhea. Diagnosis is made from elevated serum somatostatin levels, but can be difficult because of the hormone's sho half-life. Ref: German M. S. (2011). Chapter 17.

        "exp": "solated bicuspid aoic valve is a very common congenital anomaly, which may be completely asymptomatic or may cause modest noncyanotic obstruction related to stenosis. It is associated with an immediate diastolic murmur, related to some degree of aoic insufficiency that is often recognized in early childhood. Surgical correction of even mild to moderate stenosis or insufficiency is now recommended to prevent long-term damage to the hea muscle. The common pattern of transposition of the great vessels produces early cyanosis. Uncorrected patent ductus aeriosus produces a continuous (\"machinery\") murmur and late cyanosis. Tricuspid atresia, which is usually accompanied by an atrial septal defect, produces early cyanosis. Ref: Elefteriades J. A., Olin J. W., Halperin J. L. (2011). Chapter 106. Diseases of the Aoa.

PD deficiency: Acute hemolytic anemia Favism Congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia Congenital nonspherocvtic hemolytic anemia Patients with class I G6. PD variants have such severe G6. PD deficiency that lifelong hemolysis occurs in the absence of infection or drug exposure. Such patients fall under the category of having congenital nonspherocvtic hemolytic anemia. These G6. PD variants have low in vitro activity and/or marked instability of the molecule, and most have DNA mutations at the glucose-6-phosphate or NADP binding sites. These sites are central to the function of G6. PD, which oxidizes glucose-6-phosphate and reduces NADP to NADPH. It is presumed that the functional defect is so severe that the red cells cannot withstand even the normal oxidative stresses encountered in the circulation. Anemia and jaundice are often first noted in the newborn period, and the degree of hyperbilirubinemia is frequently of sufficient severity to require exchange transfusion. After infancy, hemolytic manifestations are subtle and inconstant. Most individuals have mild to moderate anemia (hemoglobin 8 to 10 g/dL) with a reticulocyte count of 10 to 15 percent. Pallor is uncommon, scleral icterus is intermittent, splenomegaly is rare, and splenectomy generally is of little benefit. Hemolysis can be exaggerated by exposure to drugs or chemicals with oxidant potential or exposure to a beans. Some drugs with relatively mild oxidant potential that are safe in patients with class II or class III G6. PD variants may increase hemolysis in patients with class I variants.

        "exp": "Cardiac-specific forms of troponin-T and troponin-I are not normally detectable in the blood, but may increase 20-fold following a myocardial infarction. Slight amino acid differences between cardiac and skeletal muscle forms of troponin allow specific association of the troponin with hea muscle damage, rather than skeletal muscle damage. Troponin is the best serum marker for myocardial infarction for the first eight hours, and because levels of the cardiac troponins remain elevated for 7-10 days, it may be useful for evaluation of small, CK-negative infarctions for several days after the event. AST is a nonspecific marker for cardiac, liver, and skeletal muscle. Due to its lack of specificity, it is much less useful as a marker of myocardial infarction than CK-MB or troponin. Both total creatine kinase and its more cardiac specific form CK-MB are most useful from 8 to 24 hours after infarction, typically with peaks at 12-18 hours. LDH1, the cardiac specific form of lactic dehydrogenase, is the test of choice 2 to 7 days after a suspected myocardial infarction. Ref: Green G. B., Hill P. M. (2011). Chapter 52.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Antigravity muscles are spared The following clinical features characterize a UMN lesion: Increased tone (spasticitv) Initially, UMN weakness may be flaccid, with absent or diminished deep tendon reflexes. There is little understanding of the reasons behind this initial flaccidity and it is often referred to as 'shock'. Increased tone of a UMN type is called spasticity. It may develop several hours, days or even weeks after the initial lesion has occurred. Spasticity is manifested by: Spastic catch': Mild spasticity may be detected as a resistance to passive movement or 'catch' in the pronators on passive supination of the forearm and in the flexors of the hand/forearm on extension of the wrist/elbow. The 'clasp-knife' phenomenon: In more severe lesions, following strong resistance to passive flexion of the knee or extension of the elbow, there is a sudden relaxation of the extensor muscles of the leg and flexor muscles in the arm. Clonus: Rhythmic involuntary muscular contractions follow an abruptly applied and sustained stretch stimulus, e. g. at the ankle following sudden passive dorsiflexion of the foot. `Pyramidal-pattern' weakness The antigravity muscles are preferentially spared and stronger The flexors of the upper limbs and the extensors of the lower limbs. The patient can develop a characteristic posture of flexed and pronated arms with clenched fingers, and extended and adducted legs with plantar flexion of the feet. In upper extremiteis Relative sparing of the flexors More involvement of the extensor In lower extremities Predominant invovlement of the flexors with Relative sparing of the extensor or Absence of muscle wasting and fasciculations Focal muscle wasting andjasciculations are features of an LMN lesion. With chronic disuse, some loss of muscle bulk can occur after a UMN lesion, but this is rarely severe or focal. Brisk tendon reflexes and extensor plantar responses The tendon reflexes are brisk. The cremasteric and abdominal or 'cutaneous' reflexes are depressed or absent. The plantar responses are extensor (upgoing toes' or 'positive' babinski sign). Anti-gravity muscles are typically spared in pyramidal tract lesions. Weakness, in pyramidal tract lesions is often termed as 'pyramidal' in distribution affecting extensors more than flexors in the upper limb, and flexors more than extensors in the lower limb (Anti-gravity muscles are spared). Pyramidal weakness - Loss of power most marked in the extensors muscles in the arms and flexors in the legs Proximal weakness - Shoulders, hips, trunks, neck and sometimes face. Associated with myopathy. Distal weakness - Affects hands and feets. Associated with peripheral motor neuropathy. Global weakness - Generalized weakness in limbs which may result from severe pathologies.",

        "exp": ". Ans. is 'a' i. e., Hypothyroidism Causes of Gynaecomastia Pubey During pubey, the serum oestradiol rises to adult levels before testosterone, causing transient gynaecomastia. This normally resolves within six months to two years. Cirrhosis Gynaecomastia occurs due to altered sex hormone metabolism, and an increase in the oestradiol; free testosterone ratio. Hypogonadism Primary hypogonadism causes a compensatory rise in LH, in turn causing increased peripheral aromatization of testosterone to oestradiol. Secondary hypogonadism, due to pituitary or hypothalamic disease (e. g. prolactin excess, Kallman's syndrome haemachromatosis), may also cause gynaecomastia despite LH deficiency, since the adrenal coex continues to produce oestrogen precursors, which are conveed to oestrogens in peripheral tissues. Tumours Testicular tumours: Germ cell tumours account for over 95% testicular tumours. Gynaecomatia occurs in 5% of patients, due to h. CG secretion stimulating oestradol production by the testes. Leydig cell tumours cause gynaecomastia in 20 - 30% of cases. These tumours present with precocious pubey in boys, or poot libido and gynaecomastia in young males. Approximately 10% of these tumours are malignant. Seoli cell turnours cause gynaecomastia through excess aromatization of androgents to oestrogens. These turnours may occur in Peutz- Jeger 's syndrome. Adrenocoical turnours may cause gynaecomastia through overproduction of androgens such as androstenedione, which are conveed to oestrogens in peripheral tissues. Ectopic h. CG-secreting tumours include lung, gastric, renal, and hepatocellular carcinomas. Hypogonadism from chemotherapy or radiotherapy may also cause gynaecomastia in patients with testicular tumours. Graves disease Gynaecomastia may occur due to increased sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and decreased free testosterone levels. Chronic renal failure: Half of patients receiving haemodialysis develop gynaecomastia due to decreased leydig cell function. Gynaecomastia may also occur following kidney transplantation due to ciclosporin use. Androgen insensitivity syndrome: Complete androgen insensitivity,. formerly termed 'testicular feminization syndrome', causes a femalephynotype in patients who are genotype males. These patients are regarded as female, and therefore present with infeility and amenorrhoea rather gynaecomastia. Paial androgen receptor defects maycause gynaecomastia in phenotypic males. Drugs cause gvnaecomastia Anti-androgens Cyproterone acetate Finasteride/dutasteride Gastrointestinal drugs Cimetidine / ranitidine Cancer chemotherapy Alkylating agents/vinca alkaloids (due to testicular damage and hypogonadism) Imatinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST).

When the transferin saturation and ferritin level become normal, phlebotomies are performed at appropriate intervals to maintain levels within the normal range. Chelating agents such as deferoxamine when given parenterally remove 10 to 20 mg iron per day, which is much less than that mobilized by once-weekly phlebotomy. Phlebotomy is also less expensive more convenient, and safer for most patients. However chelating agents are indicated when anemia or hypoproteinemia is severe enough to preclude phlebotomy. So chelating agents are not the first line of treatment for hemochromatosis and only indicated in special situations such as anemia or hypoproteinmeia. So the single best answer of choice for the question is desferoxamine is the treatment of choice. Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th Edition, Pages 2298-2303",

        "exp": "Jaundice, or icterus is a yellowish discoloration of tissue resulting from the deposition of bilirubin. Tissue deposition of bilirubin occurs only in the presence of serum hyperbilirubinemia and is a sign of either liver disease or a hemolytic disorder. Hyperbilirubinemia may result from:? Overproduction of bilirubin? Impaired uptake, conjugation, or excretion of bilirubin? Regurgitation of unconjugated or conjugated bilirubin from damaged hepatocytes or bile ducts The initial steps in evaluating the patient with jaundice are to determine whether the hyperbilirubinemia is predominantly conjugated or unconjugated in nature and whether other biochemical liver tests are abnormal. In obstructive jaundice there is a greater elevation of the alkaline phosphatase along with direct hyperbilirubinemia. Viral hepatitis and and drug induced hepatitis also causes cholestatic jaundice but does not increase alkaline phosphatase too much. Hemolytic jaundice causes indirect hyperbilirubinemia.

Visual field defects and optic atrophy suggest local mass effects which are associated with 'macroadenomas' and hence the most likely diagnosis is a pituitary macroadenoma. Note 'Pituitary adenomas are the most common cause of pituitary hormonal syndromes in adults - Harrison 'The functional tumors often produce clinical symptoms of endocrinopathies when they are still small (microadenomas) and restricted to sella. When a tumor grows outside the sella (macroadenoma) it compresses the optic chiasma and nerves and produces a variety of visual defects, the most common being a complete or incomplete bitemporal hemianopia'- API As the tumor progresses it may result in optic atrophy and blindness. Optic gliomas occur mainly in childhood and presentation is usually with visual loss and not endocrinal manifestations.

        "exp": "Systemic thromboembolism may develop in each of these patients. Vegetations associated with infective endocarditis may undergo fragmentation and result in systemic thromboembolism. Stasis develops in dilated ventricles, which predisposes to formation of thrombi attached to the ventricular walls (mural thrombi). Mural thrombi may also form within the left atrium in the presence of mitral valve prolapse. Thromboemboli may originate from mural thrombi. Decreased compliance is a pathophysiologic alteration present in a variety of cardiac disorders in which there is impediment to expansion or relaxation of ventricular walls, such as restrictive cardiomyopathy, hyperophic cardiomyopathy, and constrictive pericarditis. This feature is not present in any of the conditions described in the question. Depressed myocardial contractility results from conditions that impair myocardial inotropism, such as dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic heart disease. Depressed inotropism is not present in infective endocarditis or mitral valve prolapse. Of the three conditions in the question stem, only infective endocarditis is definitely related to an infectious etiology, usually bacteria. Recall that mitral valve prolapse is due to myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve, sometimes associated with Marfan syndrome. The etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy is heterogeneous, and most cases are idiopathic. Of the remaining cases, viral infections, toxic insults (especially alcohol), metabolic disorders (hemochromatosis), pregnancy, and genetic influences are the underlying causes.

BNP has scored over others in prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic values and has also a found place in the guidelines for the diagnosis of congestive heart failure. Assays of BNP are commercially available and used clinically for screening and diagnosis of heart failure, to predict severity of condition and estimate prognosis. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a neuro-hormone released from ventricular myocytes in response to myocytes stress. It is released as a pro-hormone and cleaved into N-terminal (NT) pro-BNP and BNP. It causes vasodilation, diuresis, and natriuresis and decreases activity of Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) and Renin-angiotensin. Aldosterone System (RAAS). Both BNP and NT-pro-BNP have prognostic value in heart failure. Those with higher values on admission do worse and those whose values decrease after treatment fare better. Out of BNP and NT-pro -BNP, NT-pro-BNP is superior to BNP in predicting hospitalisation and death in heart failure. BNP /NT-pro-BNP Assays: It helps in screening patients at risk of development of heart failure (Diabetics and asymptomatic coronary aery disease) It helps in deciding whether heart failure is the cause of dyspnoea in the emergency depament (A very low BNP or NT-pro-BNP helps exclude a cardiac cause of dyspnoea) It has prognostic value in heart failure (Those with higher values on admission do worse and those whose values decrease after treatment fare better) Out of BNP and NT-pro-BNP, NT-pro-BNP is superior to BNP in predicting hospitalisation and death in heart failure.

After the first 6 months, risk of infection is similar to the general population. CMV is the most common viral infection, occurring most commonly between the first and fouh post-transplant months. CMV is a herpes virus and infects between 25 and 85% of all liver transplant patients. CMV infection is rarely fatal. The viral infection may be primary or reactivated. Patients often present with fevers, malaise, ahralgias, atypical lymphocytes, thrombocytopenia, and mildly elevated transaminases levels. CMV pneumonitis often results in radiographic findings of bilateral infiltrates. Diagnosis is made serologically using an indirect immunofluorescence testing method. Treatment is effective when a diagnosis is made early and ganciclovir is beneficial. Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia may present with CMV infection or alone. Diagnosis sometimes requires a bronchoalveolar biopsy. Transplant recipients may be placed on long-term pneumocystic suppression therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.",

C: Diabetes Insipidus Many possible conditions and lifestyle factors can lead to hyponatremia, including: Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) - In this condition, high levels of the anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) are produced, causing the body to retain water instead of excreting it in urine. Cirrhosis - Liver disease can cause fluids to accumulate in the body. Kidney problems - Kidney failure and other kidney diseases can render the body unable to efficiently remove excess fluids from the body. Congestive heart failure - This condition causes the abdomen and lower extremities to retain fluids. Diuretics, especially thiazide diuretics- Diuretics work by making the body excrete more sodium in urine. Consuming excessive water during exercise (exeional hyponatremia or exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH)). Because sodium is lost through sweat, drinking too much water during endurance activities, such as marathons and triathlons, can dilute sodium content in blood. Hormonal changes due to adrenal gland insufficiency (Addison's disease). Adrenal glands produce hormones that help maintain the body's balance of sodium, potassium and water. Hormonal changes due to an under active thyroid (hypothyroidism). Primary polydipsia- In this condition, thirst increases significantly, causing a person to drink excessive amounts of fluid. Some medications, paicularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and some pain medications, cause a person to urinate or perspire more than normal. The recreational drug MDMA- This amphetamine causes a ripple effect on the body's ADH and water levels that-- especially in combination with heavy drinking--increases the risk of severe and even fatal cases of hyponatremia. Chronic, severe vomiting or diarrhea- This causes the body to lose fluids and electrolytes, including sodium. Dehydration- In dehydration, the body loses fluids and electrolytes. Diet- A low-sodium, high-water diet can disturb the proper balance between sodium and fluids in the blood",
