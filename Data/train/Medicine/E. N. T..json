Frey s syndrome also known as auriculotemporal syndrome or gustatory sweating is characterized by sweating and flushing of the facial skin over the parotid bed and neck during mastication. o Frey's syndrome is thought to be due to aberrant regeneration of cut parasympathetic fibres between the otic ganglion and salivary tissue which leads to innervation of sweat glands and subcutaneous tissue. o The auriculotemporal nerve is injured during sureen# of the parotid gland. This nerve when it heals attaches to sweat glands instead of the original salivary gland which was removed during surgery. This means that when a person is supposed to salivate he sweats instead. Redness and sweating appear when the affected person eats, sees, dreams thinks about or talks about foods which produce strong salivation. o Frey's syndrome is thought to occur in all patients who have parotid surgery* without reconstructive surgery.",
