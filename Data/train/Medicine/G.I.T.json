Loss of schooling and social contact, as well as frequent hospitalisation, can have impoant psychosocial consequences.Treatment is similar to that described for adults and may require glucocoicoids, immunosuppressive drugs, biological agents and surgery. Monitoring of height, weight and sexual development is crucial. Children with IBD should be managed by specialised paediatric gastroenterologists and transitioned to adult care in dedicated clinics . Pregnancy A women's ability to become pregnant is adversely affected by active IBD. Pre-conceptual counselling should focus on optimising disease control. During pregnancy, the rule of thirds applies: roughly one-third of women improve, one-third get worse and one-third remain stable with active disease. In the post-paum period, these changes sometimes reverse spontaneously. Drug therapy, including aminosalicylates, glucocoicoids Delayed growth and pubeal development: chronic active inflammation, malabsorption, malnutrition and long-term glucocoicoids contribute to sho stature and delayed development, with physical and psychological consequences. * Metabolic bone disease: more common with chronic disease beginning in childhood, resulting from chronic inflammation, dietary deficiency and malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D. * Drug side-effects and adherence issues: young people are more likely to require azathioprine or biological therapy than adults. Poor adherence to therapy is more common than with adults, as younger patients may feel well, lack self-motivation to adhere and believe that drugs are ineffective or cause side-effects. * Loss of time from education: physical illness, surgery, fatigue in chronic inflammatory bowel disease, privacy and dignity issues, and social isolation may all contribute. * Emotional difficulties: may result from challenges in coping with illness, problems with forming interpersonal relationships, and issues relating to body image or sexual function.

        "exp": "Hepatitis C This is caused by an RNA flavivirus. Acute symptomatic infection with hepatitis C is rare. Most individuals are unaware of when they became infected and are identified only when they develop chronic liver disease. Eighty per cent of individuals exposed to the virus become chronically infected and late spontaneous viral clearance is rare. There is no active or passive protection against hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis C infection is usually identified in asymptomatic individuals screened because they have risk factors for infection, such as previous injecting drug use , or have incidentally been found to have abnormal liver blood tests. Although most people remain asymptomatic until progression to cirrhosis occurs, fatigue can complicate chronic infection and is unrelated to the degree of liver damage. Hepatitis C is the most common cause of what used to be known as 'non-A, non-B hepatitis'. If hepatitis C infection is left untreated, progression from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis occurs over 20-40 years. Risk factors for progression include male gender, immunosuppression (such as co-infection with HIV), prothrombotic states and heavy alcohol misuse. Not everyone with hepatitis C infection will necessarily develop cirrhosis but approximately 20% do so within 20 years. Once cirrhosis has developed, the 5- and 10-year survival rates are 95% and 81%, respectively. One-quaer of people with cirrhosis will develop complications within 10 years and, once complications such as ascites develop, the 5-year survival is around 50%. Once cirrhosis is present, 2-5% per year will develop primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg877",

        "exp": "This may be caused by haemorrhage from the colon, anal canal or small bowel. It is useful to distinguish those patients who present with profuse, acute bleeding from those who present with chronic or subacute bleeding of lesser severity .Severe acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding .This presents with profuse red or maroon diarrhoea and with shock. Diveicular disease is the most common cause and is often due to erosion of an aery within the mouth of a diveiculum. Bleeding almost always stops spontaneously, but if it does not, the diseased segment of colon should be resected after confirmation of the site by angiography or colonoscopy. Angiodysplasia is a disease of the elderly, in which vascular malformations develop in the proximal colon. Bleeding can be acute and profuse; it usually stops spontaneously but commonly recurs. Diagnosis is often difficult. Colonoscopy may reveal characteristic vascular spots and, in the acute phase, visceral angiography can show bleeding into the intestinal lumen and an abnormal large, draining vein. In some patients, diagnosis is achieved only by laparotomy with on-table colonoscopy. The treatment of choice is endoscopic thermal ablation but resection of the affected bowel may be required if bleeding continues. Bowel ischaemia due to occlusion of the inferior mesenteric aery can present with abdominal colic and rectal bleeding. It should be considered in patients (paicularly the elderly) who have evidence of generalised atherosclerosis. The diagnosis is made at colonoscopy. Resection is required only in the presence of peritonitis. Meckel's diveiculum with ectopic gastric epithelium may ulcerate and erode into a major aery. The diagnosis should be considered in children or adolescents who present with profuse or recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. A Meckel's 99mTc-peechnetate scan is sometimes positive but the diagnosis is commonly made only by laparotomy, at which time the diveiculum is excised Primary prevention of variceal bleeding If non-bleeding varices are identified at endoscopy, b-adrenoceptor antagonist (b-blocker) therapy with propranolol (80-160 mg/day) or nadolol (40-240 mg/day) is effective in reducing poal venous pressure. Administration of these drugs at doses that reduce the hea rate by 25% has been shown to be effective in the primary prevention of variceal bleeding. In patients with cirrhosis, treatment with propranolol reduces variceal bleeding by 47% (number needed to treat for benefit (NNTB) 10), death from bleeding by 45% (NNTB 25) and overall moality by 22% (NNTB 16). The efficacy of b-blockers in primary prevention is similar to that of prophylactic banding, which may also be considered, paicularly in patients who are unable to tolerate or adhere to b-blocker therapy. Carvedilol, a non-cardioselective vasodilating b-blocker, is also effective and may be better tolerated at doses of 6.25-12.5 mg/day).

        "exp": "Neutropenic enterocolitis (NE) is also known as typhlitis, ileocecal syndrome, cecitis, or necrotizing enterocolitis. Despite the previous use of the term \"necrotizing enterocolitis\" to describe NE cases, necrotizing enterocolitis is a different inflammatory illness seen in newborns and is beyond the scope of this review. NE is a clinical entity initially described in leukemic pediatric patients. It has also been repoed in adults with hematologic malignancies such as leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, aplastic anemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes, as well as other immunosuppressive causes such as AIDS, therapy for solid tumors, and organ transplant. The true incidence of NE is unknown. One systematic review published in 2005 suggested a pooled incidence of 5.6% in hospitalized adults with hematological malignancies, chemotherapy for solid tumors, and aplastic anemia. The repoed moality also varies with rates as high as 50%. NE was repoed initially after the use of taxane drugs, but more recently an increasing number of chemotherapeutic drugs have been implicated. Other drugs linked to NE include cytosine arabinoside, gemcitabine, vincristine, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, leuvocorin, and daunorubicin. Immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplant, antibiotics, and sulfasalazine for the treatment of rheumatoid ahritis have also been considered causes of NE. PATHOGENESIS The exact pathogenesis of NE is not completely understood. The main elements in disease onset appear to be intestinal mucosal injury together with neutropenia and the immunocompromised state of the afflicted patients. These initial conditions lead to intestinal edema, engorged vessels, and a disrupted mucosal surface, which becomes more vulnerable to bacterial intramural invasion. Chemotherapeutic agents can cause direct mucosal injury (mucositis) or can predispose to distension and necrosis, thereby altering intestinal motility. Cytosine arabinoside (cytarabine) is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat leukemia and lymphoma that is paicularly associated with the development of NE. Intestinal leukemic infiltration is another potential factor in the pathogenesis of NE, which may explain the presence of acute myelogenous leukemia presenting as NE before the onset of chemotherapy regimens Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 836",

        "question": "The following are attributes of hepatitis B infection except -",
        "exp": "Hepatitis B may cause an acute viral hepatitis; however, acute infection is often asymptomatic, paicularly when acquired at bih. Many individuals with chronic hepatitis B are also asymptomatic. The risk of progression to chronic liver disease depends on the source and timing of infection . Veical transmission from mother to child in the perinatal period is the most common cause of infection worldwide and carries the highest risk of ongoing chronic infection. In this setting, adaptive immune responses to HBV may be absent initially, with apparent immunological tolerance. Several mechanisms contribute towards this: Firstly, the introduction of antigen in the neonatal period is tolerogenic. Secondly, the presentation of such antigen within the liver, as described above, promotes tolerance; this is paicularly evident in the absence of a significant innate or inflammatory response. Finally, very high loads of antigen may lead to so-called 'exhaustion' of cellular immune responses. The state of tolerance is not permanent, however, and may be reversed as a result of therapy, or through spontaneous changes in innate responses, such as interferon alpha (IFN-a) and NK cells, accompanied by host-mediated immunopathology. Chronic hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, usually after decades of infection . Chronic HBV infection is a dynamic process that can be divided into five phases ; these are not necessarily sequential, however, and not all patients will go through all phases. It is impoant to remember that the virus is not directly cytotoxic to cells; rather, it is an immune response to viral antigens displayed on infected hepatocytes that initiates liver injury. This explains why there may be very high levels of viral replication but little hepatocellular damage during the 'immune-tolerant' phase. Hepatitis B core antigen Hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) is not found in the blood, but antibody to it (anti-HBc) appears early in the illness and rapidly reaches a high titre, which subsides gradually but then persists. Anti-HBc is initially of IgM type, with IgG antibody appearing later. Anti-HBc (IgM) can sometimes reveal an acute HBV infection when the HBsAg has disappeared and before anti-HBs has developed Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 874",

The exception is in patients who have a mutation in the pre-core protein, which means they cannot secrete e antigen into serum . Such individuals will be anti-HBe-positive but have a high viral load and often evidence of chronic hepatitis. These mutations are common in the Far East, and those patients affected are classified as having e antigen-negative chronic hepatitis. They respond differently to antiviral drugs from those with classical e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis. Measurement of viral load is impoant in monitoring antiviral therapy and identifying patients with pre-core mutants. Specific HBV genotypes (A-H) can also be identified using PCR.

Pathophysiology Occasional episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux are common in healthy individuals. Reflux is normally followed by oesophageal peristaltic waves that efficiently clear the gullet, alkaline saliva neutralises residual acid and symptoms do not occur. Gastro- oesophageal reflux disease develops when the oesophageal mucosa is exposed to gastroduodenal contents for prolonged periods of time, resulting in symptoms and, in a propoion of cases, oesophagitis. Abnormalities of the lower oesophageal sphincter The lower oesophageal sphincter is tonically contracted under normal circumstances, relaxing only during swallowing (p. 766). Some patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease have reduced lower oesophageal sphincter tone, permitting reflux when intra-abdominal pressure rises. In others, basal sphincter tone is normal but reflux occurs in response to frequent episodes of inappropriate sphincter relaxation. Hiatus hernia Hiatus hernia causes reflux because the pressure gradient is lost between the abdominal and thoracic cavities, which normally pinches the hiatus. In addition, the oblique angle between the cardia and oesophagus disappears. Many patients who have large hiatus hernias develop reflux symptoms but the relationship between the presence of a hernia and symptoms is poor. Hiatus hernia is very common in individuals who have no symptoms, and some symptomatic patients have only a very small or no hernia. Neveheless, almost all patients who develop oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus or peptic strictures have a hiatus hernia. Delayed oesophageal clearance Defective oesophageal peristaltic activity is commonly found in patients who have oesophagitis. It is a primary abnormality, since it persists after oesophagitis has been healed by acid-suppressing drug therapy. Poor oesophageal clearance leads to increased acid exposure time.

It is associated with chronic atrophic gastritis, gastric mucosal atrophy and gastric cancer . It has been estimated that H. pylori infection may contribute to the occurrence of gastric cancer in 70% of cases. Although the majority of H. pylori-infected individuals have normal or increased acid secretion, a few become hypo- or achlorhydric and these people are thought to be at greatest risk. H. pylori-induced chronic inflammation with generation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of the normally abundant antioxidant ascorbic acid are also impoant. There is strong evidence that H. pylori eradication, especially if achieved before irreversible pre-neoplastic changes (atrophy and intestinal metaplasia) have developed, reduces the risk of cancer development in high-risk populations and is cost-effective. Diets rich in salted, smoked or pickled foods and the consumption of nitrites and nitrates may increase cancer risk. Carcinogenic N-nitroso-compounds are formed from nitrates by the action of nitrite-reducing bacteria that colonise the achlorhydric stomach. Diets lacking in fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as vitamins C and A, may also contribute. . No predominant genetic abnormality has been identified, although cancer risk is increased two- to threefold in first-degree relatives of patients, and links with blood group A have been repoed. Some host genetic factors related to inflammatory genes and prostate stem cell antigen have recently been associated with increased risk of gastric caner.

        "question": "Enlarged liver with Hepatocellular dysfunction seen In-",
        "exp": "Pathophysiology Normally, dietary copper is absorbed from the stomach and proximal small intestine and is rapidly taken into the liver, where it is stored and incorporated into caeruloplasmin, which is secreted into the blood. The accumulation of excessive copper in the body is ultimately prevented by its excretion, the most impoant route being bile. In Wilson's disease, there is almost always a failure of synthesis of caeruloplasmin; however, some 5% of patients have a normal circulating caeruloplasmin concentration and this is not the primary pathogenic defect. The amount of copper in the body at bih is normal but thereafter it increases steadily; the organs most affected are the liver, basal ganglia of the brain, eyes, kidneys and skeleton. The ATP7B gene encodes a member of the copper-transpoing P-type adenosine triphosphatase family, which functions to expo copper from various cell types. At least 200 different mutations have been described. Most cases are compound heterozygotes with two different mutations in ATP7B. Attempts to correlate the genotype with the mode of presentation and clinical course have not shown any consistent patterns. The large number of culprit mutations means that, in contrast to haemochromatosis, genetic diagnosis is not routine in Wilson's disease, although it may have a role in screening families following identification of the genotype in an index patient. Clinical features Symptoms usually arise between the ages of 5 and 45 years. Hepatic disease occurs predominantly in childhood and early adolescence, although it can present in adults in their fifties. Neurological damage causes basal ganglion syndromes and dementia, which tends to present in later adolescence. These features can occur alone or simultaneously. Other manifestations include renal tubular damage and osteoporosis, but these are rarely presenting features. Liver disease Episodes of acute hepatitis, sometimes recurrent, can occur, especially in children, and may progress to fulminant liver failure. The latter is characterised by the liberation of free copper into the blood stream, causing massive haemolysis and renal tubulopathy. Chronic hepatitis can also develop insidiously and eventually present with established cirrhosis; liver failure and poal hypeension may supervene. The possibility of Wilson's disease should be considered in any patient under the age of 40 presenting with recurrent acute hepatitis or chronic liver disease of unknown cause, especially when this is accompanied by haemolysis. Neurological disease Clinical features include a variety of extrapyramidal features, paicularly tremor, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism and dementia . Unusual clumsiness for age may be an early symptom. Neurological disease typically develops after the onset of liver disease and can be prevented by effective treatment staed following diagnosis in the liver disease phase. This increases the impoance of diagnosis in the liver phase beyond just allowing effective management of liver disease. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg896",

An enlarged, tender liver, cough and pain in the right shoulder are characteristic but symptoms may remain vague and signs minimal. A large abscess may penetrate the diaphragm, rupturing into the lung, and may be coughed up through a hepatobronchial fistula. Rupture into the pleural or peritoneal cavity, or rupture of a left lobe abscess in the pericardial sac, is less common but more serious. Investigations The stool and any exudate should undergo prompt microscopic examination for motile trophozoites containing red blood cells. Movements cease rapidly as the stool preparation cools.

Sigmoidoscopy may reveal typical flask-shaped ulcers, which should be scraped and examined immediately for E. histolytica. In endemic areas, one-third of the population are symptomless passers of amoebic cysts. An amoebic abscess of the liver is suspected on clinical grounds; there is often a neutrophil leucocytosis and a raised right hemidiaphragm on chest X-ray. Confirmation is by ultrasonic scanning.

All these viruses cause illnesses that have similar clinical and pathological features and are frequently anicteric or even asymptomatic.

Therapeutic developments for viral hepatitis, in paicular hepatitis C, are evolving veryrapidly, with several new classes of drugs entering clinicalpractice Clinical features of acute infection A non-specific prodromal illness characterised by headache, myalgia, ahralgia, nausea and anorexia usually precedes the development of jaundice by a few days to 2 weeks. Vomiting and diarrhoea may follow and abdominal discomfo is common. Dark urine and pale stools may precede jaundice. There are usually few physical signs. The liver is often tender but only minimally enlarged. Occasionally, mild splenomegaly and cervical lymphadenopathy are seen. These features are more frequent in children or those with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Symptoms rarely last longer than 3-6 weeks. Complications may occur but are rare . Investigations A hepatitic pattern of LFTs develops, with serum transaminases typically between 200 and 2000 U/L in an acute infection (usually lower and fluctuating in chronic infections). The plasma bilirubin reflects the degree of liver damage. The ALP rarely exceeds twice the upper limit of normal. Prolongation of the PT indicates the severity of the hepatitis but rarely exceeds 25 seconds, except in rare cases of acute liver failure. The white cell count is usually normal with a relative lymphocytosis. Serological tests confirm the aetiology of the infection. Management Most individuals do not need hospital care. Drugs such as sedatives and narcotics, which are metabolised in the liver, should be avoided. No specific dietary modifications are required. Alcohol should not be taken during the acute illness. Elective surgery should be avoided in cases of acute viral hepatitis, as there is a risk of post-operative liver failure. Liver transplantation is very rarely indicated for acute viral hepatitis complicated by liver failure, but is commonly performed for complications of cirrhosis resulting from chronic hepatitis B and C infection.

From an opposite perspective, the HBV carrier status has a critical impact on the clinical management of kidney transplant recipients and patients with renal diseases who are treated with immunosuppressive drugs. HBV is not directly cytopathic to hepatocytes. The host immune response, especially virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, is the basis for hepatocellular damage as well as viral clearance. Neonatal exposure to HBV when the immune system is immature results in minimal acute hepatitis, but this is followed by chronic infection in 90% of subjects, and contributes to the bulk of chronic HBV carriers. After entering hepatocytes by endocytosis, the paially double-stranded viral genomic DNA is transpoed into the nucleus, where it is conveed to covalently closed circular DNA, which serves as a template for transcription of viral mRNAs, which in turn are used for viral replication through reverse transcription and the production of viral DNA polymerase and other viral proteins. Intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA thus accounts for the persistence of infection. About 350 million people worldwide have chronic HBV infection Ref Davidson edition23rd pg876",

        "question": "Poor prognostic factor in a patient with pancreatitis includes-",
        "exp": "Clinical features The typical presentation is with severe, constant upper abdominal pain, of increasing intensity over 15-60 minutes, which radiates to the back. Nausea and vomiting are common. There is marked epigastric tenderness, but in the early stages (and in contrast to a perforated peptic ulcer), guarding and rebound tenderness are absent because the inflammation is principally retroperitoneal. Bowel sounds become quiet or absent as paralytic ileus develops. In severe cases, the patient becomes hypoxic and develops hypovolaemic shock with oliguria. Discoloration of the flanks (Grey Turner's sign) or the periumbilical region (Cullen's sign) is a feature of severe pancreatitis with haemorrhage. The differential diagnosis includes a perforated viscus, acute cholecystitis and myocardial infarction. A collection of fluid and debris may develop in the lesser sac, following inflammatory rupture of the pancreatic duct; this is known as a pancreatic fluid collection. It is initially contained within a poorly defined, fragile wall of granulation tissue, which matures over a 6-week period to form a fibrous capsule . pseudocysts' are common and usually asymptomatic, resolving as the pancreatitis recovers. Pseudocysts greater than 6 cm in diameter seldom disappear spontaneously and can cause constant abdominal pain and compress or erode surrounding structures, including blood vessels, to form pseudoaneurysms. Large pseudocysts can be detected clinically as a palpable abdominal mass. Pancreatic ascites occurs when fluid leaks from a disrupted pancreatic duct into the peritoneal cavity. Leakage into the thoracic cavity can result in a pleural effusion or a pleuro-pancreatic fistula. Investigations The diagnosis is based on raised serum amylase or lipase concentrations and ultrasound or CT evidence of pancreatic swelling. Plain X-rays should be taken to exclude other diagnoses, such as perforation or obstruction, and to identify pulmonary complications. Amylase is efficiently excreted by the kidneys and concentrations may have returned to normal if measured 24-48 hours after the onset of pancreatitis. A persistently elevated serum amylase concentration suggests pseudocyst formation. Peritoneal amylase concentrations are massively elevated in pancreatic ascites. Serum amylase concentrations are also elevated (but less so) in intestinal ischaemia, perforated peptic ulcer and ruptured ovarian cyst, while the salivary isoenzyme of amylase is elevated in parotitis. If available, serum lipase measurements are preferable to amylase, as they have greater diagnostic accuracy for acute pancreatitis. Ultrasound scanning can confirm the diagnosis, although in the earlier stages the gland may not be grossly swollen. The ultrasound scan is also useful because it may show gallstones, biliary obstruction or pseudocyst formation. Contrast-enhanced pancreatic CT performed 6-10 days after admission can be useful in assessing bility of the pancreas if persisting organ failure, sepsis or clinical deterioration is present, since these features may indicate that pancreatic necrosis has occurred. Necrotising pancreatitis is associated with decreased pancreatic enhancement on CT, following intravenous injection of contrast material. The presence of gas within necrotic material suggests infection and impending abscess formation, in which case percutaneous aspiration of material for bacterial culture should be carried out and appropriate antibiotics prescribed. Involvement of the colon, blood vessels and other adjacent structures by the inflammatory process is best seen by CT. Ceain investigations stratify the severity of acute pancreatitis and have impoant prognostic value at the time of presentation . In addition, serial assessment of CRP is a useful indicator of progress. A peak CRP of >210 mg/L in the first 4 days predicts severe acute pancreatitis with 80% accuracy. It is woh noting that the serum amylase concentration has no prognostic value. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 839",

Risk scoring systems have been developed to stratify the risk of needing endoscopic therapy or of having a poor outcome . The advantage of the Blatchford score is that it may be used before endoscopy to predict the need for intervention to treat bleeding. Low scores (2 or less) are associated with a very low risk of adverse outcome. Clinical assessment Haematemesis is red with clots when bleeding is rapid and profuse, or black ('coffee grounds') when less severe. Syncope may occur and is caused by hypotension from intravascular volume depletion. Symptoms of anaemia suggest chronic bleeding. Melaena is the passage of black, tarry stools containing altered blood; it is usually caused by bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract, although haemorrhage from the right side of the colon is occasionally responsible.

Triggers for this are many, including alcohol, gallstones and pancreatic duct obstruction . There is simultaneous activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB), leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy and a 21 vigorous inflammatory response. The normal pancreas has only a poorly developed capsule, and adjacent structures, including the common bile duct, duodenum, splenic vein and transverse colon, are commonly involved in the inflammatory process. The severity of acute pancreatitis is dependent on the balance between the activity of released proteolytic enzymes and antiproteolytic factors. The latter comprise an intracellular pancreatic trypsin inhibitor protein and circulating b2-macroglobulin, a1-antitrypsin and C1-esterase inhibitors. . Acute pancreatitis is often self-limiting, but in some patients with severe disease, local complications, such as necrosis, pseudocyst or abscess, occur, as well as systemic complications that lead to multi-organ failure.

The acid output may be so great that it reaches the upper small intestine, reducing the luminal pH to 2 or less. Pancreatic lipase is inactivated and bile acids are precipitated. Diarrhoea and steatorrhoea result. Around 90% of tumours occur in the pancreatic head or proximal duodenal wall. At least half are multiple and tumour size can vary from 1 mm to 20 cm. Approximately one-half to two-thirds are malignant but are often slow-growing. Between 20% and 60% of patients have multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 (p. 688). Clinical features The presentation is with severe and often multiple peptic ulcers in unusual sites, such as the post-bulbar duodenum, jejunum or oesophagus. There is a poor response to standard ulcer therapy. The history is usually sho, and bleeding and perforations are common. Diarrhoea is seen in one-third or more of patients and can be the presenting feature. Investigations Hypersecretion of acid under basal conditions, with little increase following pentagastrin, may be confirmed by gastric aspiration. Serum gastrin levels are grossly elevated (10- to 1000-fold). Injection of the hormone secretin normally causes no change or a slight decrease in circulating gastrin concentrations, but in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome it produces a paradoxical and dramatic increase in gastrin. Tumour localisation (and staging) is best achieved by a combination of CT and EUS; radio-labelled somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and 68gallium DOTATATE PET scanning may also be used for tumour detection and staging.

In 10% of cases, the cause of acute liver failure remains unknown and these patients are often labelled as having 'non-A-E viral hepatitis' or 'cryptogenic' acute liver failure Clinical assessment Cerebral disturbance (hepatic encephalopathy and/or cerebral oedema) is the cardinal manifestation of acute liver failure, but in the early stages this can be mild and episodic, and so its absence does not exclude a significant acute liver injury. The initial clinical features are often subtle and include reduced aleness and poor concentration, progressing through behavioural abnormalities, such as restlessness and aggressive outbursts, to drowsiness and coma . Cerebral oedema may occur due to increased intracranial pressure, causing unequal or abnormally reacting pupils, fixed pupils, hypeensive episodes, bradycardia, hyperventilation, profuse sweating, local or general myoclonus, focal fits or decerebrate posturing. Papilloedema occurs rarely and is a late sign. More general symptoms include weakness, nausea and vomiting. Right hypochondrial discomfo is an occasional feature.

T-cell activation and differentiation results in a Th1 T cell-mediated cytokine response with secretion of cytokines, including interferon gamma (IFN-g).

Affected children have growth and pubeal delay, leading to sho stature in adulthood. In adults, the disease usually presents during the third or fouh decade and females are affected twice as often as males. The presentation is highly variable, depending on the severity and extent of small bowel involvement. Some have florid malabsorption, while others develop non-specific symptoms, such as tiredness, weight loss, folate deficiency or iron deficiency anaemia. Other presentations include oral ulceration, dyspepsia and bloating. Unrecognised coeliac disease is associated with mild under-nutrition and osteoporosis. Coeliac disease is associated with other HLA-linked autoimmune disorders and with ceain other diseases (Box 21.42). In some centres, people at higher risk of developing coeliac disease, such as those with type 1 diabetes, may undergo periodic antibody screening.

Features include changes of intellect, personality, emotions and consciousness, with or without neurological signs.

These substances are normally metabolised by the healthy liver and excluded from the systemic circulation. Ammonia has traditionally been considered an impoant factor. Recent interest has focused on g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a mediator, along with octopamine, amino acids, mercaptans and fatty acids that can act as neurotransmitters.

        "exp": "H. pylori is Gram-negative and spiral, and has multiple flagella at one end, which make it motile, allowing it to burrow and live beneath the mucus layer adherent to the epithelial surface. It uses an adhesin molecule (BabA) to bind to the Lewis b antigen on epithelial cells. Here the surface pH is close to neutral and any acidity is buffered by the organism's production of the enzyme urease. This produces ammonia from urea and raises the pH around the bacterium and between its two cell membrane layers. H. pylori exclusively colonises gastric-type epithelium and is found in the duodenum only in association with patches of gastric metaplasia. It causes chronic gastritis by provoking a local inflammatory response in the underlying epithelium . This depends on numerous factors, notably expression of bacterial cagA and vacA genes. The CagA gene product is injected into epithelial cells, interacting with numerous cell-signalling pathways involved in cell replication and apoptosis. H. pylori strains expressing CagA (CagA+) are more often associated with disease than CagA- strains. Most strains also secrete a large pore-forming protein called VacA, which causes increased cell permeability, efflux of micronutrients from the epithelium, induction of apoptosis and suppression of local immune cell activity. Several forms of VacA exist and pathology is most strongly associated with the s1/ml form of the toxin. The distribution and severity of H. pylori-induced gastritis determine the clinical outcome. In most people, H. pylori causes a mild pangastritis with little effect on acid secretion and the majority develop no significant clinical outcomes.

The moality of patients admitted to hospital is about 10% but there is some evidence that outcome is better when individuals are treated in specialised units. Risk scoring systems have been developed to stratify the risk of needing endoscopic therapy or of having a poor outcome . The advantage of the Blatchford score is that it may be used before endoscopy to predict the need for intervention to treat bleeding. Low scores (2 or less) are associated with a very low risk of adverse outcome. Clinical assessment Haematemesis is red with clots when bleeding is rapid and profuse, or black ('coffee grounds') when less severe. Syncope may occur and is caused by hypotension from intravascular volume depletion. Symptoms of anaemia suggest chronic bleeding. Melaena is the passage of black, tarry stools containing altered blood; it is usually caused by bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract, although haemorrhage from the right side of the colon is occasionally responsible. The characteristic colour and smell are the result of the action of digestive enzymes and of bacteria on haemoglobin. Severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding can sometimes cause maroon or bright red stool.Management The principles of emergency management of non-variceal bleeding are discussed in detail below. . 1. Intravenous access -The first step is to gain intravenous access using at least one large-bore cannula. 2. Initial clinical assessment Define circulatory status. Severe bleeding causes tachycardia, hypotension and oliguria. The patient is cold and sweating, and may be agitated. Seek evidence of liver disease . Jaundice, cutaneous stigmata, hepatosplenomegaly and ascites may be present in decompensated cirrhosis. Identify comorbidity. The presence of cardiorespiratory, cerebrovascular or renal disease is impoant, both because these may be worsened by acute bleeding and because they increase the hazards of endoscopy and surgical operations. These factors can be combined using the Blatchford score , which can be calculated at the bedside. A score or 2 or less is associated with a good prognosis, while progressively higher scores are associated with poorer outcomes. 3. Basic investigations Full blood count. Chronic or subacute bleeding leads to anaemia but the haemoglobin concentration may be normal after sudden, major bleeding until haemodilution occurs. Thrombocytopenia may be a clue to the presence of hypersplenism in chronic liver disease. Urea and electrolytes. This test may show evidence of renal failure. The blood urea rises as the absorbed products of luminal blood are metabolised by the liver; an elevated blood urea with normal creatinine concentration implies severe bleeding. Liver function tests. These may show evidence of chronic liver disease. Prothrombin time. Check when there is a clinical suggestion of liver disease or patients are anticoagulated. Cross-matching. At least 2 units of blood should be cross-matched if a significant bleed is suspected. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg781",

Squamous cancer can occur in any pa of the oesophagus and almost all tumours in the upper oesophagus are squamous cancers. Adenocarcinomas typically arise in the lower third of the oesophagus from Barrett's oesophagus or from the cardia of the stomach. The incidence is increasing and is now approximately 5: 100 000 in the UK; this is possibly because of the high prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux and Barrett's oesophagus in Western populations. Despite modern treatment, the overall 5-year survival of patients presenting with oesophageal cancer is only 13%. Clinical features Most patients have a history of progressive, painless dysphagia for solid foods. Others present acutely because of food bolus obstruction. In the late stages, weight loss is often extreme; chest pain or hoarseness suggests mediastinal invasion. Fistulation between the oesophagus and the trachea or bronchial tree leads to coughing after swallowing, pneumonia and pleural effusion.

It is an autosomal recessive trait when caused by a mutation in the promoter region of the gene for UDP-glucuronyl transferase enzyme (UGT1A1), which leads to reduced enzyme expression. It can be inherited in a dominant fashion when there is a missense mutation in the gene. This results in decreased conjugation of bilirubin, which accumulates as unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. The levels of unconjugated bilirubin increase during fasting, as fasting reduces levels of UDP-glucuronyl transferase. Clinical features The typical presentation is with isolated elevation of bilirubin, typically, although not exclusively, in the setting of physical stress or illness. There are no stigmata of chronic liver disease other than jaundice. Increased excretion of bilirubin and hence stercobilinogen leads to normal-coloured or dark stools, and increased urobilinogen excretion causes the urine to turn dark on standing as urobilin is formed. In the presence of haemolysis, pallor due to anaemia and splenomegaly due to excessive reticulo-endothelial activity are usually present. Investigations The plasma bilirubin is usually less than 100 umol/L (~6 mg/ dL) and the LFTs are otherwise normal. There is no bilirubinuria because the hyperbilirubinaemia is predominantly unconjugated. Hepatic histology is normal and liver biopsy is not recommended for the investigation of patients with possible Gilbe's syndrome. The condition is not associated with liver injury and thus has an excellent prognosis, needs no treatment, and is clinically impoant only because it may be mistaken for more serious liver disease .

Once the ulcer has formed, it is more likely to cause complications and less likely to heal if the patient continues to smoke. Clinical features Peptic ulcer disease is a chronic condition with spontaneous relapses and remissions lasting for decades, if not for life. The most common presentation is with recurrent abdominal pain that has three notable characteristics: localisation to the epigastrium, relationship to food and episodic occurrence. Occasional vomiting occurs in about 40% of ulcer subjects; persistent daily vomiting suggests gastric outlet obstruction. In one-third, the history is less characteristic, especially in elderly people or those taking NSAIDs. In this situation, pain may be absent or so slight that it is experienced only as a vague sense of epigastric unease. Occasionally, the only symptoms are anorexia and nausea, or early satiety after meals. In some patients, the ulcer is completely 'silent', presenting for the first time with anaemia from chronic undetected blood loss, as abrupt haematemesis or as acute perforation; in others, there is recurrent acute bleeding without ulcer pain. The diagnostic value of individual symptoms for peptic ulcer disease is poor; the history is therefore a poor predictor of the presence of an ulcer. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 799",

Neuro-endocrine tumours also arise in the pancreas but tend to grow more slowly and have a better prognosis; these are discussed in detail on page 678. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma affects 10-15 per 100 000 in Western populations, rising to 100 per 100 000 in those over the age of 70. Men are affected twice as often as women. The disease is associated with increasing age, smoking and chronic pancreatitis. Between 5% and 10% of patients have a genetic predisposition: hereditary pancreatitis, HNPCC and familial atypical mole multiple melanoma syndrome (FAMMM). Overall survival is only 3-5%, with a median survival of 6-10 months for those with locally advanced disease and 3-5 months if metastases are present. Clinical features Many patients are asymptomatic until an advanced stage, when they present with central abdominal pain, weight loss and obstructive jaundice . The pain results from invasion of the coeliac plexus and is characteristically incessant and gnawing. It often radiates from the upper abdomen through to the back and may be eased a little by bending forwards. Almost all patients lose weight and many are cachectic. Around 60% of tumours arise from the head of the pancreas, and involvement of the common bile duct results in the development of obstructive jaundice, often with severe pruritus. A few patients present with diarrhoea, vomiting from duodenal obstruction, diabetes mellitus, recurrent venous thrombosis, acute pancreatitis or depression.Physical examination reveals clear evidence of weight loss. An abdominal mass due to the tumour itself, a palpable gallbladder or hepatic metastasis is commonly found.

        "question": "Which one of the following treatments is effective in primary biliary cirrhosis?",
        "exp": "Management The hydrophilic bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), at a dose of 13-15 mg/kg/day, improves bile flow, replaces toxic hydrophobic bile acids in the bile acid pool, and reduces apoptosis of the biliary epithelium. Clinically, UDCA improves LFTs, may slow down histological progression and has few side-effects; it is therefore widely used in the treatment of PBC and should be regarded as the optimal first-line treatment. Its use is recommended in all clinical guidelines. A significant minority of patients either fail to normalise their LFTs with UDCA or show an inadequate response, and such individuals have an increased risk of developing end-stage liver disease compared to those showing a full response. Obeticholic acid (OCA) is a second-generation bile acid therapeutic that acts as an agonist for the nuclear farnesoid X receptor. It reduces hepatocyte synthesis of bile acids and was approved in 2016 for use in patients showing an inadequate response to UDCA. Immunosuppressants, such as glucocoicoids, azathioprine, penicillamine and ciclosporin, have all been trialled in PBC. None shows overall benefit when given to unselected patients. It is unclear whether these drugs offer benefit to the specific subgroup of patients who do not respond to UDCA and require second-line approaches to treatment. Liver transplantation should be considered once liver failure has developed and may be indicated in patients with intractable pruritus. Serum bilirubin remains the most reliable marker of declining liver function. Transplantation is associated with an excellent 5-year survival of over 80%, although the disease will recur in over one-third of patients at 10 years. Pruritus This is the main symptom requiring treatment. The cause is unknown, but up-regulation of opioid receptors and increased levels of endogenous opioids may play a role. First-line treatment is with the anion-binding resin colestyramine, which probably acts by binding potential pruritogens in the intestine and increasing their excretion in the stool. A dose of 4-16 g/day orally is used. The powder is mixed in orange juice and the main dose (8 g) taken before and after breakfast, when maximal duodenal bile acid concentrations occur. Colestyramine may bind other drugs in the gut (most obviously UDCA) and adequate spacing should be used between drugs. Colestyramine is sometimes ineffective, especially in complete biliary obstruction, and can be difficult for some patients to tolerate. Alternative treatments include rifampicin (150 mg/day, titrated up to a maximum of 600 mg/day as required and contingent on there being no deterioration in LFTs), naltrexone (an opioid antagonist; 25 mg/day initially, increasing up to 300 mg/day), plasmapheresis and a liver suppo device (e.g. a molecular adsorbent recirculating system, MARS). Fatigue Fatigue affects about one-third of patients with PBC. The cause is unknown but it may reflect intracerebral changes due to cholestasis. Unfounately, once depression, hypothyroidism and coeliac disease have been excluded, there is currently no specific treatment. The impact on patients' lives can be substantial.

The microorganism is the first formally recognized bacterial carcinogen, leading to the development of various upper gastro-intestinal disorders including gastritis, gastro-duodenal ulcer diseases and gastric cancer . The latter was established to be the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide . Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that H. pylori infection is most prevalent in developing countries and among populations with low socioeconomic background . In addition to income and education level, living standards such as sanitation and hygiene, crowding index, and source of drinking water have been shown to be risk factors of H. pylori . Major variations in prevalence rates were observed among different ethnic groups, suggesting a possible genetic susceptibility . Lifestyle factors are also believed to contribute to H. pylori infection development. Studies on the association of smoking and alcohol consumption with the infection show conflicting results. While some have found that smoking was associated with an increased risk for H. pylori, and that alcohol consumption had no effect on it others have concluded that both smoking and alcohol consumption had a protective effect against the infection Previous studies worldwide have investigated the relationship between dietary patterns and H. pylori, with many being published over 20 years ago. Some studies have found that salty, pickled, fermented, or smoked foods increased the risk of H. pylori infection while another found no association between H. pylori and pickled food Also, high intake of fruits, vegetables or of antioxidants were found to be protective factors infection in some studies Ref Davidson edition23rd pg797",

        "exp": "Investigations Investigations aim to establish alcohol misuse, exclude alternative or additional coexistent causes of liver disease, and assess the severity of liver damage. The clinical history from patient, relatives and friends is impoant to establish alcohol misuse duration and severity. Biological markers, paicularly macrocytosis in the absence of anaemia, may suggest and suppo a history of alcohol misuse. A raised GGT is not specific for alcohol misuse and may also be elevated in the presence of other conditions, including NAFLD. The level may therefore not return to normal with abstinence if chronic liver disease is present, and GGT should not be relied on as an indicator of ongoing alcohol consumption. The presence of jaundice may suggest alcoholic hepatitis. Determining the extent of liver damage often requires a liver biopsy. In alcoholic hepatitis, PT and bilirubin are used to calculate a 'discriminant function' (DF), also known as the Maddrey score, which enables the clinician to assess prognosis (PT = prothrombin time; serum bilirubin in umol/L is divided by 17 to conve to mg/dL): DF Increase in PT Bilirubin mg/dL = x ( ) + A value over 32 implies severe liver disease with a poor prognosis and is used to guide treatment decisions (see below). A second scoring system, the Glasgow score, uses the age, white cell count and renal function, in addition to PT and bilirubin, to assess prognosis and has a cut-off of 9 . Biochemical tests There is no single diagnostic blood test for NAFLD. Elevations of serum ALT and AST are modest, and usually less than twice the upper limit of normal. ALT levels fall as hepatic fibrosis increases and the characteristic AST:ALT ratio of <1 seen in NASH reverses (AST:ALT >1) as disease progresses towards cirrhosis, meaning that steatohepatitis with advanced disease may be present even in those with normal-range ALT levels. 9Other laboratory abnormalities that may be present include non-specific elevations of GGT, low-titre antinuclear antibody (ANA) in 20-30% of patients and elevated ferritin levels.

        "exp": "Blind loop syndrome The normal duodenum and jejunum contain fewer than 104/mL organisms, which are usually derived from saliva. The count of coliform organisms never exceeds 103/mL. In bacterial overgrowth, there may be 108-1010/mL organisms, most of which are normally found only in the colon. Disorders that impair the normal physiological mechanisms controlling bacterial proliferation in the intestine predispose to bacterial overgrowth . The most impoant are loss of gastric acidity, impaired intestinal motility and structural abnormalities that allow colonic bacteria to gain access to the small intestine or provide a secluded haven from the peristaltic stream. Pathophysiology Bacterial overgrowth can occur in patients with small bowel diveiculi. Another cause is diabetic autonomic neuropathy , which reduces small bowel motility and affects enterocyte secretion. In systemic sclerosis, bacterial overgrowth arises because the circular and longitudinal layers of the intestinal muscle are fibrosed and motility is abnormal. In idiopathic hypogammaglobulinaemia , bacterial overgrowth occurs because the IgA and IgM levels in serum and jejunal secretions are reduced. Chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption occur because of bacterial overgrowth and recurrent gastrointestinal infections (paicularly giardiasis, ). Clinical features The patient presents with watery diarrhoea and/or steatorrhoea, and with anaemia due to B12 deficiency. These arise because of deconjugation of bile acids, which impairs micelle formation, an because of bacterial utilisation of vitamin B12. There may also be symptoms from the underlying intestinal cause. Investigations The diagnosis of blind loops or fistulae can often be made by barium small bowel meal and follow-through or small bowel MRI enterography. Endoscopic duodenal biopsies are useful in excluding coeliac disease. Jejunal contents for bacteriological examination can also be aspirated at endoscopy but laboratory analysis requires anaerobic and aerobic culture techniques. Bacterial overgrowth can also be diagnosed non-invasively using hydrogen breath tests, although they lack sensitivity. These simple, non-radioactive tests involve serial measurement of breath samples for hydrogen after oral ingestion of 50 g of glucose or lactulose. If bacteria are present within the small bowel, they rapidly metabolise the glucose, causing an early rise in exhaled hydrogen, in advance of that normally resulting from metabolism by colonic flora. Biochemical analysis may reveal low serum levels of vitamin B12, with normal or elevated folate levels because the bacteria produce folic acid. Hypogammaglobulinaemia can be diagnosed by measurement of serum immunoglobulins and by intestinal biopsy, which shows reduced or absent plasma cells and nodular lymphoid hyperplasia.

        "exp": "Clinical features of Ulcerative colitis The cardinal symptoms are rectal bleeding with passage of mucus and bloody diarrhoea. The presentation varies, depending on the site and severity of the disease , as well as the presence of extra-intestinal manifestations. The first attack is usually the most severe and is followed by relapses and remissions. Emotional stress, intercurrent infection, gastroenteritis, antibiotics or NSAID therapy may all provoke a relapse. Proctitis causes rectal bleeding and mucus discharge, accompanied by tenesmus. Some patients pass frequent, small-volume fluid stools, while others pass pellety stools due to constipation upstream of the inflamed rectum. Constitutional symptoms do not occur. Left-sided and extensive colitis causes bloody diarrhoea with mucus, often with abdominal cramps. In severe cases, anorexia, malaise, weight loss and abdominal pain occur and the patient is toxic, with fever, tachycardia and signs of peritoneal inflammation . Clinical features of Crohn's disease The major symptoms are abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. Ileal Crohn's disease subacute or even acute intestinal obstruction. The pain is often associated with diarrhoea, which is usually watery and does not contain blood or mucus. Almost all patients lose weight because they avoid food, since eating provokes pain. Weight loss may also be due to malabsorption and some patients present with features of fat, protein or vitamin deficiencies. Crohn's colitis presents in an identical manner to ulcerative colitis but rectal sparing and the presence of perianal disease are features that our a diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Many patients present with symptoms of both small bowel and colonic disease. A few patients present with isolated perianal disease, vomiting from jejunal strictures or severe oral ulceration. Physical examination often reveals evidence of weight loss, anaemia with glossitis and angular stomatitis. There is abdominal tenderness, most marked over the inflamed area. An abdominal mass may be palpable and is due to matted loops of thickened bowel or an intra-abdominal abscess. Perianal skin tags, fissures or fistulae are found in at least 50% of patients Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 816,817",

Investigations Serology and virology - The HCV genome encodes a large polypeptide precursor that is modified post-translationally to at least ten proteins, including several antigens that give rise to antibodies in an infected person; these are used in diagnosis. It may take 6-12 weeks for antibodies to appear in the blood following acute infection, such as a needlestick injury. In these cases, hepatitis C RNA can be identified in the blood as early as 2-4 weeks after infection. Active infection is confirmed by the presence of serum hepatitis C RNA in anyone who is antibody-positive. Anti-HCV antibodies persist in serum even after viral clearance, whether spontaneous or post-treatment. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg877",

Investigations The investigation of choice is upper gastrointestinal endoscopywith biopsy. A barium swallow demonstrates the site and length of the stricture but adds little useful information. Once a diagnosis has been made, investigations should be performed to stage the tumour and define operability. Thoracic and abdominal CT, often combined with positron emission tomography (PET-CT), should be carried out to identify metastatic spread and local invasion . Invasion of the aoa, major airways or coeliac axis usually precludes surgery, but patients with resectable disease on imaging should undergo EUS to determine the depth of penetration of the tumour into the oesophageal wall and to detect locoregional lymph node involvement .

        "exp": "This is a rare tumour, accounting for less than 5% of all gastric malignancies. The stomach is, however, the most common site for extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 60% of all primary gastrointestinal lymphomas occur at this site. Lymphoid tissue is not found in the normal stomach but lymphoid aggregates develop in the presence of H. pylori infection. Indeed, H. pylori infection is closely associated with the development of a low-grade lymphoma (classified as extranodal marginal-zone lymphomas of MALT type). EUS plays an impoant role in staging these lesions by accurately defining the depth of invasion into the gastric wall. The clinical presentation is similar to that of gastric cancer and endoscopically the tumour appears as a polypoid or ulcerating mass. While initial treatment of low-grade lesions confined to the superficial layers of the gastric wall consists of H. pylori eradication and close observation, 25% contain t(11:18) chromosomal translocations. In these cases, additional radiotherapy or chemotherapy is usually necessary. High-grade B-cell lymphomas should be treated by a combination of rituximab, chemotherapy , surgery and radiotherapy.

The prognosis depends on the stage at diagnosis. Features predicting a ourable prognosis are stage I or II disease, small resectable tumours, tumours with low-grade histology, and age below 60 years.

Phlegmonous means a diffuse spreading inflammation of or within the connective tissue. In the stomach, it implies infection of the deeper layers of the stomach (submucosa and muscularis). As a result, purulent bacterial infection may lead to gangrene. Phlegmonous gastritis is rare. The clinical diagnosis is usually established in the operating room, as these patients present with an acute abdominal emergency requiring immediate surgical exploration.

It can result in malabsorption and responds to a gluten-free diet. The condition occurs worldwide but is more common in nohern Europe. The prevalence in the UK is approximately 1%, although 50% of these people are asymptomatic. These include both undiagnosed 'silent' cases of the disease and cases of 'latent' coeliac disease - genetically susceptible people who may later develop clinical coeliac disease. Pathophysiology The precise mechanism of mucosal damage is unclear but immunological responses to gluten play a key role . There is a strong genetic component, with around 10% of first-degree relatives of an index case affected, and there is strong (approximately 75%) concordance in monozygotic twins. There is a strong association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2/DQ8. Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been identified but it is unclear if this is pathological or a response to the underlying mucosal changes Clinical features Coeliac disease can present at any age. In infancy, it occurs after weaning on to cereals and typically presents with diarrhoea, malabsorption and failure to thrive. In older children, it may present with non-specific features, such as delayed growth. Features of malnutrition are found on examination and mild abdominal distension may be present. Affected children have growth and pubeal delay, leading to sho stature in adulthood. In adults, the disease usually presents during the third or fouh decade and females are affected twice as often as males. The presentation is highly variable, depending on the severity and extent of small bowel involvement. Some have florid malabsorption, while others develop non-specific symptoms, such as tiredness, weight loss, folate deficiency or iron deficiency anaemia. Other presentations include oral ulceration, dyspepsia and bloating. Unrecognised coeliac disease is associated with mild under-nutrition and osteoporosis. Coeliac disease is associated with other HLA-linked autoimmune disorders and with ceain other diseases . In some centres, people at higher risk of developing coeliac disease, such as those with type 1 diabetes, may undergo periodic antibody screening. Such screening may identify people with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic disease; there is controversy about the optimum management strategy for such individuals.

        "exp": "Management of chronic hepatitis B Treatments are still limited, as no drug is consistently able to eradicate hepatitis B infection completely (i.e. render the patient HBsAg-negative). The goals of treatment are HBeAg seroconversion, reduction in HBV-DNA and normalisation of the LFTs. The indication for treatment is a high viral load in the presence of active hepatitis, as demonstrated by elevated serum transaminases and/or histological evidence of inflammation and fibrosis. The oral antiviral agents are more effective in reducing viral loads in patients with e antigen-negative chronic hepatitis B than in those with e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B, as the pre-treatment viral loads are lower. Most patients with chronic hepatitis B are asymptomatic and develop complications, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, only after many years . Cirrhosis develops in 15-20% of patients with chronic HBV over 5-20 years. This propoion is higher in those who are e antigen-positive. Two different types of drug are used to treat hepatitis B: direct-acting nucleoside/nucleotide analogues and pegylated interferon-alfa. Direct-acting nucleoside/nucleotide antiviral agents Orally administered nucleoside/nucleotide antiviral agents are the mainstay of therapy. These act by inhibiting the reverse transcription of pre-genomic RNA to HBV-DNA by HBV-DNA polymerase but do not directly affect the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) template for viral replication, and so relapse is common if treatment is withdrawn. One major concern is the selection of antiviral-resistant mutations with long-term treatment. This is paicularly impoant with some of the older agents, such as lamivudine, as mutations induced by previous antiviral exposure may also induce resistance to newer agents. Entecavir and tenofovir (see below) are potent antivirals with a high barrier to genetic resistance and so are the most appropriate first-line agents. Lamivudine Although effective, long-term therapy is often complicated by the development of HBV-DNA polymerase mutants (e.g. the 'YMDD variant'), which lead to viral resistance. These occur after approximately 9 months and are characterised by a rise in viral load during treatment. Outside resource-limited settings, this agent is now seldom used for the treatment of HBV but may be used to prevent reactivation of HBV in previously infected, HBsAg-negative patients if they are undergoing chemotherapy .

This is usually colicky or cramping in nature, felt in the lower abdomen and relieved by defecation. Abdominal bloating worsens throughout the day; the cause is unknown but it is not due to excessive intestinal gas. The bowel habit is variable. Most patients alternate between episodes of diarrhoea and constipation but it is useful to classify them as having predominantly constipation or predominantly diarrhoea. Those with constipation tend to pass infrequent pellety stools, usually in association with abdominal pain or proctalgia. Those with diarrhoea have frequent defecation but produce low-volume stools and rarely have nocturnal symptoms. Passage of mucus is common but rectal bleeding does not occur. Patients do not lose weight and are constitutionally well. Physical examination is generally unremarkable, with the exception of variable tenderness to palpation . Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 825",

        "exp": "Autoimmune hepatitis Autoimmune hepatitis is a disease of immune-mediated liver injury characterised by the presence of serum antibodies and peripheral blood T lymphocytes reactive with self-proteins, a strong association with other autoimmune diseases , and high levels of serum immunoglobulins - in paicular, elevation of IgG. Although most commonly seen in women, paicularly in the second and third decades of life, it can develop in either sex at any age. The reasons for the breakdown in immune tolerance in autoimmune hepatitis remain unclear, although cross-reactivity with viruses such as HAV and EBV in immunogenetically susceptible individuals (typically those with human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR3 and DR4, paicularly HLA-DRB3*0101 and HLA-DRB1*0401) has been suggested as a mechanism. Pathophysiology Several subtypes of this disorder have been proposed that have differing immunological markers. Although the different patterns can be associated with variation in disease aspects, such as response to immunosuppressive therapy, histological patterns are similar in the different settings and the basic approach to treatment (complete control of liver injury using immunosuppressive drugs and maintained with appropriate therapy) is the same. The formal classification into disease types has fallen out of our in recent years. The most frequently seen autoantibody pattern is high titre of antinuclear and anti-smooth muscle antibodies, typically associated with IgG hyperglobulinaemia (type I autoimmune hepatitis in the old classification), frequently seen in young adult females. Disease characterised by the presence of anti-liver-kidney microsomal (LKM) antibodies, recognising cytochrome P450-IID6 expressed on the hepatocyte membrane, is typically seen in paediatric populations and can be more resistant to treatment than ANA-positive disease. Adult onset of anti-LKM can be seen in chronic HCV infection. This was classified as type II disease in the old system. More recently, a pattern of antibody reactivity with anti-soluble liver antigen (anti-SLA) has been described in typically adult patients, often with aggressive disease and usually lacking autoantibodies of other specificities. Clinical features The onset is usually insidious, with fatigue, anorexia and eventually jaundice. The non-specific nature of the early features can lead to the diagnosis being missed in the early disease stages. In about one-quaer of patients the onset is acute, resembling viral hepatitis, but resolution does not occur. This acute presentation can lead to extensive liver necrosis and liver failure. Other features include fever, ahralgia, vitiligo and epistaxis. Amenorrhoea can occur. Jaundice is mild to moderate or occasionally absent, but signs of chronic liver disease, especially spider naevi and hepatosplenomegaly, can be present. Associated autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or rheumatoid ahritis, is often present and can modulate the clinical presentation. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 886",

        "exp": "Gastro-oesophageal reflux resulting in heaburn affects approximately 30% of the general population. Pathophysiology Occasional episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux are common in healthy individuals. Reflux is normally followed by oesophageal peristaltic waves that efficiently clear the gullet, alkaline saliva neutralises residual acid and symptoms do not occur. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease develops when the oesophageal mucosa is exposed to gastroduodenal contents for prolonged periods of time, resulting in symptoms and, in a propoion of cases, oesophagitis. Abnormalities of the lower oesophageal sphincter . The lower oesophageal sphincter is tonically contracted under normal circumstances, relaxing only during swallowing.Some patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease have reduced lower oesophageal sphincter tone, permitting reflux when intra-abdominal pressure rises. In others, basal sphincter tone is normal but reflux occurs in response to frequent episodes of inappropriate sphincter relaxation. Hiatus hernia Hiatus hernia causes reflux because the pressure gradient is lost between the abdominal and thoracic cavities, which normally pinches the hiatus. In addition, the oblique angle between the cardia and oesophagus disappears. Many patients who have large hiatus hernias develop reflux symptoms but the relationship between the presence of a hernia and symptoms is poor. Hiatus hernia is very common in individuals who have no symptoms, and some symptomatic patients have only a very small or no hernia. Neveheless, almost all patients who develop oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus or peptic strictures have a hiatus hernia. Delayed oesophageal clearance Defective oesophageal peristaltic activity is commonly found in patients who have oesophagitis. It is a primary abnormality, since it persists after oesophagitis has been healed by acid-suppressing drug therapy. Poor oesophageal clearance leads to increased acid exposure time. Gastric contents Gastric acid is the most impoant oesophageal irritant and there is a close relationship between acid exposure time and symptoms. Pepsin and bile also contribute to mucosal injury. Defective gastric emptying Gastric emptying is delayed in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The reason is unknown. Increased intra-abdominal pressure Pregnancy and obesity are established predisposing causes. Weight loss may improve symptoms. Dietary and environmental factors Dietary fat, chocolate, alcohol, tea and coffee relax the lower oesophageal sphincter and may provoke symptoms. The foods that trigger symptoms vary widely between affected individuals. Patient factors Visceral sensitivity and patient vigilance play a role in determining symptom severity and consulting behaviour in individual patients Clinical features The major symptoms are heaburn and regurgitation, often provoked by bending, straining or lying down. 'Waterbrash', which is salivation due to reflex salivary gland stimulation as acid enters the gullet, is often present. The patient is often overweight. Some patients are woken at night by choking as refluxed fluid irritates the larynx. Others develop odynophagia or dysphagia. A variety of other features have been described, such as atypical chest pain that may be severe and can mimic angina; it may be due to reflux-induced oesophageal spasm. Others include hoarseness ('acid laryngitis'), recurrent chest infections, chronic cough and asthma. The true relationship of these features to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease remains unclear Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 729",

        "exp": "Gilbe's syndrome Gilbe's syndrome is by far the most common inherited disorder of bilirubin metabolism (see Box 22.17, p. 860). It is an autosomal recessive trait when caused by a mutation in the promoter region of the gene for UDP-glucuronyl transferase enzyme (UGT1A1), which leads to reduced enzyme expression. It can be inherited in a dominant fashion when there is a missense mutation in the gene. This results in decreased conjugation of bilirubin, which accumulates as unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. The levels of unconjugated bilirubin increase during fasting, as fasting reduces levels of UDP-glucuronyl transferase. Clinical features The typical presentation is with isolated elevation of bilirubin, typically, although not exclusively, in the setting of physical stress or illness. There are no stigmata of chronic liver disease other than jaundice. Increased excretion of bilirubin and hence stercobilinogen leads to normal-coloured or dark stools, and increased urobilinogen excretion causes the urine to turn dark on standing as urobilin is formed. In the presence of haemolysis, pallor due to anaemia and splenomegaly due to excessive reticulo-endothelial activity are usually present. Investigations The plasma bilirubin is usually less than 100 umol/L (~6 mg/ dL) and the LFTs are otherwise normal. There is no bilirubinuria because the hyperbilirubinaemia is predominantly unconjugated. Hepatic histology is normal and liver biopsy is not recommended for the investigation of patients with possible Gilbe's syndrome. The condition is not associated with liver injury and thus has an excellent prognosis, needs no treatment, and is clinically impoant only because it may be mistaken for more serious liver disease Ref Davidson edition23rd pg ,807",

        "exp": "Hepatitis B may cause an acute viral hepatitis; however, acute infection is often asymptomatic, paicularly when acquired at bih. Many individuals with chronic hepatitis B are also asymptomatic. The risk of progression to chronic liver disease depends on the source and timing of infection . Veical transmission from mother to child in the perinatal period is the most common cause of infection worldwide and carries the highest risk of ongoing chronic infection. In this setting, adaptive immune responses to HBV may be absent initially, with apparent immunological tolerance. Several mechanisms contribute towards this: Firstly, the introduction of antigen in the neonatal period is tolerogenic. Secondly, the presentation of such antigen within the liver, as described above, promotes tolerance; this is paicularly evident in the absence of a significant innate or inflammatory response. Finally, very high loads of antigen may lead to so-called 'exhaustion' of cellular immune responses. The state of tolerance is not permanent, however, and may be reversed as a result of therapy, or through spontaneous changes in innate responses, such as interferon alpha (IFN-a) and NK cells, accompanied by host-mediated immunopathology. Chronic hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, usually after decades of infection . Chronic HBV infection is a dynamic process that can be divided into five phases ; these are not necessarily sequential, however, and not all patients will go through all phases. It is impoant to remember that the virus is not directly cytotoxic to cells; rather, it is an immune response to viral antigens displayed on infected hepatocytes that initiates liver injury. This explains why there may be very high levels of viral replication but little hepatocellular damage during the 'immune-tolerant' phase. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 873",

        "exp": "Bilirubin metabolism and bile The liver plays a central role in the metabolism of bilirubin and is responsible for the production of bile (Fig. 22.6). Between 425 and 510 mmol (250-300 mg) of unconjugated bilirubin is produced from the catabolism of haem daily. Bilirubin in the blood is normally almost all unconjugated and, because it is not water-soluble, is bound to albumin and does not pass into the urine. Unconjugated bilirubin is taken up by hepatocytes at the sinusoidal membrane, where it is conjugated in the endoplasmic reticulum by UDP-glucuronyl transferase, producing bilirubin mono- and diglucuronide. Impaired conjugation by this enzyme is a cause of inherited hyperbilirubinaemias . These bilirubin conjugates are water-soluble and are expoed into the bile canaliculi by specific carriers on the hepatocyte membranes. The conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the bile and passes into the duodenal lumen. Once in the intestine, conjugated bilirubin is metabolised by colonic bacteria to form stercobilinogen, which may be fuher oxidised to stercobilin. Both stercobilinogen and stercobilin are then excreted in the stool, contributing to its brown colour. Biliary obstruction results in reduced stercobilinogen in the stool, and the stools become pale. A small amount of stercobilinogen (4 mg/day) is absorbed from the bowel, passes through the liver and is excreted in the urine, where it is known as urobilinogen or, following fuher oxidisation, urobilin. The liver secretes 1-2 L of bile daily. Bile contains bile acids (formed from cholesterol), phospholipids, bilirubin and cholesterol. Several biliary transpoer proteins have been identified . Mutations in genes encoding these proteins have been identified in inherited intrahepatic biliary diseases presenting in childhood, and in adult-onset disease such as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and gallstone formation. Urine tests If the blood level of conjugated bilirubin becomes elevated, e.g. due to liver disease, excess conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the urine, indicating a pathological process.

        "exp": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by liver disease. As it progresses, delirium is followed by coma. Simple delirium needs to be differentiated from delirium tremens and Wernicke's encephalopathy, and coma from subdural haematoma, which can occur in alcoholics after a fall . Features include changes of intellect, personality, emotions and consciousness, with or without neurological signs. The degree of encephalopathy can be graded from 1 to 4, depending on these features, and this is useful in assessing response to therapy . When an episode develops acutely, a precipitating factor may be found . The earliest features are very mild and easily overlooked, but as the condition becomes more severe, apathy, inability to concentrate, delirium, disorientation, drowsiness, slurring of speech and eventually coma develop. Convulsions sometimes occur. Examination usually shows a flapping tremor (asterixis), inability to perform simple mental arithmetic tasks or to draw objects such as a star (constructional apraxia;), and, as the condition progresses, hyper-reflexia and bilateral extensor plantar responses. Hepatic encephalopathy rarely causes focal neurological signs; if these are present, other causes must be sought. Fetor hepaticus, a sweet musty odour to the breath, is usually present but is more a sign of liver failure and poosystemic shunting than of hepatic encephalopathy. Rarely, chronic hepatic encephalopathy (hepatocerebral degeneration) gives rise to variable combinations of cerebellar dysfunction, Parkinsonian syndromes, spastic paraplegia and dementia. Pathophysiology Hepatic encephalopathy is thought to be due to a disturbance of brain function provoked by circulating neurotoxins that are normally Some degree of liver failure is a key factor, as poosystemic shunting of blood alone hardly ever causes encephalopathy. The 'neurotoxins' causing encephalopathy are unknown but are thought to be mainly nitrogenous substances produced in the gut, at least in pa by bacterial action. These substances are normally metabolised by the healthy liver and excluded from the systemic circulation. Ammonia has traditionally been considered an impoant factor. Recent interest has focused on g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a mediator, along with octopamine, amino acids, mercaptans and fatty acids that can act as neurotransmitters. The brain in cirrhosis may also be sensitised to other factors, such as drugs that can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. Disruption of the function of the blood-brain barrier is a feature of acute hepatic failure and may lead to cerebral oedema. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 865",

Many individuals with chronic hepatitis B are also asymptomatic. The risk of progression to chronic liver disease depends on the source and timing of infection . Veical transmission from mother to child in the perinatal period is the most common cause of infection worldwide and carries the highest risk of ongoing chronic infection. In this setting, adaptive immune responses to HBV may be absent initially, with apparent immunological tolerance. Several mechanisms contribute towards this: Firstly, the introduction of antigen in the neonatal period is tolerogenic. Secondly, the presentation of such antigen within the liver, as described above, promotes tolerance; this is paicularly evident in the absence of a significant innate or inflammatory response. Finally, very high loads of antigen may lead to so-called 'exhaustion' of cellular immune responses.

The disease is a multisystem one and almost any organ can be affected, sometimes long before gastrointestinal involvement becomes apparent . Pathophysiology Whipple's disease is caused by infection with the Gram-positive bacillus Tropheryma whipplei, which becomes resident within macrophages in the bowel mucosa. Villi are widened and flattened, containing densely packed macrophages in the lamina propria, which obstruct lymphatic drainage and cause fat malabsorption. Clinical features Middle-aged Caucasian men are most frequently affected and presentation depends on the pattern of organ involvement. Low-grade fever is common and most patients have joint symptoms to some degree, often as the first manifestation. Occasionally, neurological manifestations may predominate and CNS involvement is the most serious consequence. Investigations Diagnosis is made by the characteristic features on small bowel biopsy, with characterisation of the bacillus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Management Whipple's disease is often fatal if untreated but responds well, at east initially, to intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g daily for 2 weeks), followed by oral co-trimoxazole for at least 1 year. Symptoms usually resolve quickly and biopsy changes reve to normal in a few weeks. Long-term follow-up is essential, as clinical relapse occurs in up to one-third of patients, often within the CNS; in this case, the same therapy is repeated or else treatment with doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine is necessary.

        "exp": "Gastro-oesophageal reflux resulting in heaburn affects approximately 30% of the general population. Pathophysiology -Occasional episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux are common in healthy individuals. Reflux is normally followed by oesophageal peristaltic waves that efficiently clear the gullet, alkaline saliva neutralises residual acid and symptoms do not occur. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease develops when the oesophageal mucosa is exposed to gastroduodenal contents for prolonged periods of time, resulting in symptoms and, in a propoion of cases, oesophagitis. Several factors are known to be involved in the development of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.The lower oesophageal sphincter is tonically contracted under normal circumstances, relaxing only during swallowing. Some patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease have reduced lower oesophageal sphincter tone, permitting reflux when intra-abdominal pressure rises. In others, basal sphincter tone is normal but reflux occurs in response to frequent episodes of inappropriate sphincter relaxation. Hiatus hernia Hiatus hernia causes reflux because the pressure gradient is lost between the abdominal and thoracic cavities, which normally pinches the hiatus. In addition, the oblique angle between the cardia and oesophagus disappears. Many patients who have large hiatus hernias develop reflux symptoms but the relationship between the presence of a hernia and symptoms is poor. Hiatus hernia is very common in individuals who have no symptoms, and some symptomatic patients have only a very small or no hernia. Neveheless, almost all patients who develop oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus or peptic strictures have a hiatus hernia. Delayed oesophageal clearance , Defective oesophageal peristaltic activity is commonly found in patients who have oesophagitis. It is a primary abnormality, since it persists after oesophagitis has been healed by acid-suppressing drug therapy. Poor oesophageal clearance leads to increased acid exposure time.

Accordingly, most affected patients have evidence of liver failure and poosystemic shunting of blood, but the balance between these varies from individual to individual. Some degree of liver failure is a key factor, as poosystemic shunting of blood alone hardly ever causes encephalopathy. The 'neurotoxins' causing encephalopathy are unknown but are thought to be mainly nitrogenous substances produced in the gut, at least in pa by bacterial action. These substances are normally metabolised by the healthy liver and excluded from the systemic circulation. Ammonia has traditionally been considered an impoant factor. Recent interest has focused on g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a mediator, along with octopamine, amino acids, mercaptans and fatty acids that can act as neurotransmitters.

        "exp": "Management Cessation of alcohol consumption is the single most impoant treatment and prognostic factor. Life-long abstinence is the best advice. General health and life expectancy are improved when this occurs, irrespective of the stage of liver disease. Abstinence is even effective at preventing progression, hepatic decompensation and death once cirrhosis is present. In the acute presentation of ALD it is impoant to identify and anticipate alcohol withdrawal and Wernicke's encephalopathy, which need treating in parallel with the liver disease and any complications of cirrhosis. Nutrition Good nutrition is very impoant, and enteral feeding a fine-bore nasogastric tube may be needed in severely ill patients. Drug therapy The optimum treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis (Maddrey's discriminative score >32) has been debated for some time. The STOPAH study was a large, multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial to evaluate the relative merits of glucocoicoids and/or a weak anti-TNF agent (pentoxifylline), alone or in combination. In a coho of 1103 patients, no significant benefit from pentoxifylline treatment was identified but treatment with prednisolone (40 mg daily for 28 days) led to a modest reduction in sho-term moality, from 17% in placebo-treated patients to 14% in the prednisolone group. These findings were consistent with earlier studies where an improvement in 28-day survival from 52% to 78% is seen when glucocoicoids are given to those with a Glasgow score of more than 9. Neither glucocoicoids nor pentoxifylline improved survival at 90 days or 1 year, however. Sepsis is the main side-effect of glucocoicoids, and existing sepsis and variceal haemorrhage are the main contraindications to their use. If the bilirubin has not fallen 7 days after staing glucocoicoids, the drugs are unlikely to reduce moality and should be stopped. Liver transplantation The role of liver transplantation in the management of ALD remains controversial. In many centres, ALD is a common indication for liver transplantation. The challenge is to identify patients with an unacceptable risk of returning to harmful alcohol consumption. Many programmes require a 6-month period of abstinence from alcohol before a patient is considered for transplantation. Although this relates poorly to the incidence of alcohol relapse after transplantation, liver function may improve to the extent that transplantation is no longer necessary. The outcome of transplantation for ALD is good and if the patient remains abstinent there is no risk of disease recurrence. Transplantation for alcoholic hepatitis has been thought to have a poorer outcome and is seldom performed due to concerns about recidivism; studies to quantify this are ongoing.

This often begins between six months and two years of age. Non-classic symptoms are more common, especially in people older than two years. There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms, a wide number of symptoms involving any pa of the body or no obvious symptoms.Coeliac disease was first described in childhood;however, it may develop at any age.It is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes mellitus type 1 and thyroiditis, among others. The classic symptoms of untreated coeliac disease include pale, loose, and greasy stool (steatorrhoea), and weight loss or failure to gain weight. Other common symptoms may be subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself.It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any of the classic symptoms at all.This has been shown to comprise at least 43% of presentations in children. Fuher, many adults with subtle disease may only present with fatigue or anaemia. Many undiagnosed individuals who consider themselves asymptomatic are in fact not, but rather have become accustomed to living in a state of chronically compromised health. Indeed, after staing a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease which they had mistakenly ignored.

Although most commonly seen in women, paicularly in the second and third decades of life, it can develop in either sex at any age. The reasons for the breakdown in immune tolerance in autoimmune hepatitis remain unclear, although cross-reactivity with viruses such as HAV and EBV in immunogenetically susceptible individuals (typically those with human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR3 and DR4, paicularly HLA-DRB3*0101 and HLA-DRB1*0401) has been suggested as a mechanism. Pathophysiology Several subtypes of this disorder have been proposed that have differing immunological markers. Although the different patterns can be associated with variation in disease aspects, such as response to immunosuppressive therapy, histological patterns are similar in the different settings and the basic approach to treatment (complete control of liver injury using immunosuppressive drugs and maintained with appropriate therapy) is the same. The formal classification into disease types has fallen out of our in recent years. The most frequently seen autoantibody pattern is high titre of antinuclear and anti-smooth muscle antibodies, typically associated with IgG hyperglobulinaemia (type I autoimmune hepatitis in the old classification), frequently seen in young adult females. Disease characterised by the presence of anti-liver-kidney microsomal (LKM) antibodies, recognising cytochrome P450-IID6 expressed on the hepatocyte membrane, is typically seen in paediatric populations and can be more resistant to treatment than ANA-positive disease. Adult onset of anti-LKM can be seen in chronic HCV infection. This was classified as type II disease in the old system. More recently, a pattern of antibody reactivity with anti-soluble liver antigen (anti-SLA) has been described in typically adult patients, often with aggressive disease and usually lacking autoantibodies of other specificities. Clinical features The onset is usually insidious, with fatigue, anorexia and eventually jaundice. The non-specific nature of the early features can lead to the diagnosis being missed in the early disease stages. In about one-quaer of patients the onset is acute, resembling viral hepatitis, but resolution does not occur. This acute presentation can lead to extensive liver necrosis and liver failure. Other features include fever, ahralgia, vitiligo and epistaxis. Amenorrhoea can occur. Jaundice is mild to moderate or occasionally absent, but signs of chronic liver disease, especially spider naevi and hepatosplenomegaly, can be present. Associated autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or rheumatoid ahritis, is often present and can modulate the clinical presentation. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 886",

        "exp": "Gilbe's syndrome Gilbe's syndrome is by far the most common inherited disorder of bilirubin metabolism . It is an autosomal recessive trait when caused by a mutation in the promoter region of the gene for UDP-glucuronyl transferase enzyme (UGT1A1), which leads to reduced enzyme expression. It can be inherited in a dominant fashion when there is a missense mutation in the gene. This results in decreased conjugation of bilirubin, which accumulates as unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. The levels of unconjugated bilirubin increase during fasting, as fasting reduces levels of UDP-glucuronyl transferase. Clinical features The typical presentation is with isolated elevation of bilirubin, typically, although not exclusively, in the setting of physical stress or illness. There are no stigmata of chronic liver disease other than jaundice. Increased excretion of bilirubin and hence stercobilinogen leads to normal-coloured or dark stools, and increased urobilinogen excretion causes the urine to turn dark on standing as urobilin is formed. In the presence of haemolysis, pallor due to anaemia and splenomegaly due to excessive reticulo-endothelial activity are usually present. Investigations The plasma bilirubin is usually less than 100 umol/L (~6 mg/ dL) and the LFTs are otherwise normal. There is no bilirubinuria because the hyperbilirubinaemia is predominantly unconjugated. Hepatic histology is normal and liver biopsy is not recommended for the investigation of patients with possible Gilbe's syndrome. The condition is not associated with liver injury and thus has an excellent prognosis, needs no treatment, and is clinically impoant only because it may be mistaken for more serious liver disease .

Simple delirium needs to be differentiated from delirium tremens and Wernicke's encephalopathy, and coma from subdural haematoma, which can occur in alcoholics after a fall . Features include changes of intellect, personality, emotions and consciousness, with or without neurological signs. The degree of encephalopathy can be graded from 1 to 4, depending on thesep features, and this is useful in assessing response to therapy . When an episode develops acutely, a precipitating factor may be found . The earliest features are very mild and easily overlooked, but as the condition becomes more severe, apathy, inability to concentrate, delirium, disorientation, drowsiness, slurring of speech and eventually coma develop. Convulsions sometimes occur. Examination usually shows a flapping tremor (asterixis), inability to perform simple mental arithmetic tasks or to draw objects such as a star (constructional apraxia; ), and, as the condition progresses, hyper-reflexia and bilateral extensor plantar responses. Hepatic encephalopathy rarely causes focal neurological signs; if these are present, other causes must be sought. Fetor hepaticus, a sweet musty odour to the breath, is usually present but is more a sign of liver failure and poosystemic shunting than of hepatic encephalopathy. Rarely, chronic hepatic encephalopathy (hepatocerebral degeneration) gives rise to variable combinations of cerebellar dysfunction, Parkinsonian syndromes, spastic paraplegia and dementia. Pathophysiology Hepatic encephalopathy is thought to be due to a disturbance of brain function provoked by circulating neurotoxins that are normally metabolised by the liver. Accordingly, most affected patients have evidence of liver failure and poosystemic shunting of blood, but the balance between these varies from individual to individual. Management The principles are to treat or remove precipitating causes and to suppress the production of neurotoxins by bacteria in the bowel. Dietary protein restriction is rarely needed and is no longer recommended as first-line treatment because it is unpalatable and can lead to a worsening nutritional state in already malnourished patients. Lactulose (15-30 mL 3 times daily) is increased gradually until the bowels are moving twice daily. It produces an osmotic laxative effect, reduces the pH of the colonic content, thereby limiting colonic ammonia absorption, and promotes the incorporation of nitrogen into bacteria. Rifaximin (400 mg 3 times daily) is a well-tolerated, non-absorbed antibiotic that acts by reducing the bacterial content of the bowel and has been shown to be effective. It can be used in addition, or as an alternative, to lactulose if diarrhoea becomes troublesome. Chronic or refractory encephalopathy is one of the main indications for liver transplantation.

There is a strong association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2/DQ8. Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been identified but it is unclear if this is pathological or a response to the underlying mucosal changes Clinical features Coeliac disease can present at any age. In infancy, it occurs after weaning on to cereals and typically presents with diarrhoea, malabsorption and failure to thrive. In older children, it may present with non-specific features, such as delayed growth. Features of malnutrition are found on examination and mild abdominal distension may be present. Affected children have growth and pubeal delay, leading to sho stature in adulthood. In adults, the disease usually presents during the third or fouh decade and females are affected twice as often as males. The presentation is highly variable, depending on the severity and extent of small bowel involvement. Some have florid malabsorption, while others develop non-specific symptoms, such as tiredness, weight loss, folate deficiency or iron deficiency anaemia. Other presentations include oral ulceration, dyspepsia and bloating. Unrecognised coeliac disease is associated with mild under-nutrition and osteoporosis. Coeliac disease is associated with other HLA-linked autoimmune disorders and with ceain other diseases (Box 21.42). In some centres, people at higher risk of developing coeliac disease, such as those with type 1 diabetes, may undergo periodic antibody screening. Such screening may identify people with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic disease; there is controversy about the optimum management strategy for such individuals.

        "exp": "Management of IBS The most impoant steps are to make a positive diagnosis and reassure the patient. Many people are concerned that they have developed cancer. A cycle of anxiety leading to colonic symptoms, which fuher heighten anxiety, can be broken by explaining that symptoms are not due to a serious underlying disease but instead are the result of behavioural, psychosocial, physiological and luminal factors. In individuals who fail to respond to reassurance, treatment is traditionally tailored to the predominant symptoms. Dietary management is effective for many patients. Up to 20% may benefit from a wheat-free diet, some may respond to lactose exclusion, and excess intake of caffeine or aificial sweeteners, such as sorbitol, should be addressed. A more restrictive, 'low-FODMAP' diet, supervised by a dietitian, with gradual re-introduction of different food groups, may help some patients, as may a trial of a gluten-free diet. Probiotics, in capsule form, can be effective if taken for several months, although the optimum combination of bacterial strains and dose have yet to be clarified. Patients with intractable symptoms sometimes benefit from several months of therapy with a tricyclic antidepressant, such as amitriptyline or imipramine (10-25 mg orally at night). Side-effects include dry mouth and drowsiness but these are usually mild and the drug is generally well tolerated, although patients with features of somatisation tolerate the drug poorly and lower doses should be used. It may act by reducing visceral sensation and by altering gastrointestinal motility. Anxiety and affective disorders may also require specific treatment . The 5-HT4 agonist prucalopride, the guanylate cyclase-C receptor agonist linaclotide, and chloride channel activators, such as lubiprostone, can be effective in constipation- predominant IBS. Trials of anti-inflammatory agents, such as ketotifen or mesalazine, and the antibiotic rifaximin may be considered in some patients with difficult symptoms but are best prescribed only after specialist referral. Psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, relaxation and gut-directed hypnotherapy, should be reserved for the most difficult cases. A range of complementary and alternative therapies exist; most lack a good evidence base but are popular and help some patients . Most patients have a relapsing and remitting course.

The stomach is, however, the most common site for extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 60% of all primary gastrointestinal lymphomas occur at this site. Lymphoid tissue is not found in the normal stomach but lymphoid aggregates develop in the presence of H. pylori infection. Indeed, H. pylori infection is closely associated with the development of a low-grade lymphoma (classified as extranodal marginal-zone lymphomas of MALT type). EUS plays an impoant role in staging these lesions by accurately defining the depth of invasion into the gastric wall. The clinical presentation is similar to that of gastric cancer and endoscopically the tumour appears as a polypoid or ulcerating mass. While initial treatment of low-grade lesions confined to the superficial layers of the gastric wall consists of H. pylori eradication and close observation, 25% contain t(11:18) chromosomal translocations. In these cases, additional radiotherapy or chemotherapy is usually necessary. High-grade B-cell lymphomas should be treated by a combination of rituximab, chemotherapy , surgery and radiotherapy. The choice depends on the site and extent of tumour, the presence of comorbid illnesses, and other factors, such as symptoms of bleeding and gastric outflow obstruction. The prognosis depends on the stage at diagnosis. Features predicting a ourable prognosis are stage I or II disease, small resectable tumours, tumours with low-grade histology, and age below 60 years.

The most common presentation is with recurrent abdominal pain that has three notable characteristics: localisation to the epigastrium, relationship to food and episodic occurrence. Occasional vomiting occurs in about 40% of ulcer subjects; persistent daily vomiting suggests gastric outlet obstruction. In one-third, the history is less characteristic, especially in elderly people or those taking NSAIDs. In this situation, pain may be absent or so slight that it is experienced only as a vague sense of epigastric unease. Occasionally, the only symptoms are anorexia and nausea, or early satiety after meals. In some patients, the ulcer is completely 'silent', presenting for the first time with anaemia from chronic undetected blood loss, as abrupt haematemesis or as acute perforation; in others, there is recurrent acute bleeding without ulcer pain. The diagnostic value of individual symptoms for peptic ulcer disease is poor; the history is therefore a poor predictor of the presence of an ulcer. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 799",
