Hyponatremia may be due to water excess, diabetes, lipidemia etc. Drugs known to release ADH will cause dilutional hyponatremia include morphine, tricyclics, nicotine, NSAIDs, etc. The individual present with confusion, anorexia, lethargy and cramps. When sodium drops abruptly, seizures, hemiparesis and coma can develop. CLINICAL FEATURES OF HYPONATREMIA# The clinical manifestations of hyponatremia are related to osmotic water shift leading to increased ICF volume, specifically brain cell swelling or cerebral edema.# The symptoms are primarily neurologic.# Patients may be asymptomatic or complain of nausea and malaise.# As the plasma Na+ concentration falls, the symptoms progress to include headache, lethargy, confusion, and obtundation.# Stupor, seizures, and coma do not usually occur unless the plasma Na+ concentration falls acutely below 120 mmol/L or decreases rapidly.# Loss of Na+ and K+, followed by organic osmolytes, from brain cells decreases brain swelling due to secondary transcellular water shifts (from ICF to ECF).# The net effect is to minimize cerebral edema and its symptoms.

Also know:*SLADH is characterized by hypotonic hyponatremia with euvolemia. Low plasma osmolality (<280 m. Osm/Kg) with high urine osmolality (>100-150 m. Osm/Kg) in suspected patients is diagnostic.* Pneumonia, hyponatremia and diarrhea are almost classic for Legionella.* Under most physiologic conditions, sodium, urea, and glucose generate the osmotic pressure of blood. Plasma osmolality is calculated according to the following expression: Posm = 2. Na+ + Glu + BUN (all in mmol/L), or, using conventional laboratory values in which glucose and BUN are expressed in milligrams per deciliter: Posm = 2. Na+ + Glu/18 + BUN/2. 8. The calculated and determined osmolality should agree within 10-15 mmol/kg H20. When the measured osmolality exceeds the calculated osmolality by >15-20 mmol/kg H20, one of two circumstances prevails. Either the serum sodium is spuriously low, as with hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia (pseudohyponatremia), or osmolytes other than sodium salts, glucose, or urea have accumulated in plasma.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Insulin + glucose Tall T waves on ECG indicate cardiac manifestation of hyperkalemia. Intravenous calcium gluconate is the first drug to be administered in a patient with hyperkalemia having E. C. G. abnormalities. - It stabilizes the myocardium immediately. - It acts within minutes and is characterized by improvement in E. C. G. appearance. But an important point to note. It does not affect transcellular movement of potassium. Thus it won't help in reducing the hyperkalemia. Among the agents which cause transcellular (intracellular) movement of potassium. \"Intravenous insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium levels. The goals of the therapy for the t/t of acute hyperkalemia in chronological order are as follows:-Antagonize the affect of K+ on excitable cell membranes. Redistribution of extracellular potassium into cells. Enhance elimination of potassium from the body. Antagonize the effect of potassium on excitable cell membrane. Calcium directly antagonizes the myocardial effect of hyperkalemia. It does so by reducing the threshold potential of cardiac myocytes. Calcium for injection is available as chloride or gluconate salt. The preferred agent is the gluconate salt since it is less likely than calcium chloride to cause tissue necrosis. The onset of action is < 3 minutes. The duration of action is 30-60 minutes during which time further measures may be undertaken to lower pK. Redistribution of potassium into cells Insulin. Insulin shifts potassium into cells. Potassium shift inside the cells is mediated by Na+ K+ ATPase. I. V. insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium level Q. The onset of action is < 15 minutes and the effect is maximal b/w 30-60 minutes. Dextrose is given along with insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. It was believed that administration of dextrose alone, can cause shift of potassium inside the cells by promoting insulin release. The administration of hypertonic dextrose alone for hyperkalemia is not recommended for two reasons. Endogenous insulin levels are unlikely to rise to the level necessary for a therapeutic effect. There is a risk of exacerbating hyperkalemia by inducing hypertonicity. b adrenoceptor agonists. These drugs can also cause movement of potassium inside the cell. High dose albuterol shows their effect in 30 minutes and persists for at least 2 hours, The effect of insulin is additive with that of albuterol. Patients taking nonselective b adrenoceptor blockers will be unlikely to manifest the hypokalemic effects of albuterol. Even among patient's not taking b blockers as many as 40% seem to be resistant to the hypokalemic effect of albuterol. The mechanism for this resistance is unknown and currently, there is no basis for predicting which patients will respond. For this reason albuterol should never be used as a single agent for the treatment of urgent hyperkalemia. Bicarbonate. Bicarbonate (as a bolus injection) was used in the emergency t/t of hyperkalemia. Ironically this dogma was based on studies using a prolonged (4-6 hrs) infusion of bicarbonate. It has now been demonstrated that short term bicarbonate infusion does not reduce pK in patients with dialysis dependent kidney failure, implying that it does not cause K+shift into cells. Sodium bicarbonate seems to have no effect to shift K+ into cells even after several hours. It is likely to be effective especially in combination with a diuretic drug in enhancing urinary K+ elimination in patients with some kidney function, although it use for this purpose has not been evaluated. Elimination of potassium from the body. Hyperkalemia occurs most often in patients with renal insufficiency. However renal potassium excretion may be enhanced even in patients with significant renal impairment by increasing the delivery of solute to the distal nephron. Sodium bicarbonateA sodium bicarbonate infusion administered during 4-6 hrs at a rate designed to alkalinize the urine may enhance urinary K+ excretion and would be desirable especially in patients with metabolic acidosis. The risk of volume expansion with the bicarbonate infusion can be mitigated by use of loop acting diuretics which would, be likely to enhance the kaliuresis. Exchange resin. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a cation exchange resin. In the lumen of intestine it exchanges sodium for secreted potassium. Most of this exchange takes place in the colon, the site of most potassium secretion in the gut. There are two concerns with the use of resin in the t/t of urgent hyperkalemia. The first is its slow effect. When given orally, the onset of action is at least 2 hrs and the maximum effect may not be seen for more than 6 hrs. The second is its adverse effect. It can cause intestinal necrosis Dialysis\"Hemodialysis is the method of choice for removing potassium from the body\". The rate of potassium removed with peritoneal dialysis is much slower than with hemodialysis.",

Metabolic acidosis is a condition that occurs when the body produces too much acid or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body. Those in metabolic acidosis may exhibit deep, rapid breathing called Kussmaul respirations which is classically associated with diabetic ketoacidosis. Rapid deep breaths increase the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled, Arterial blood gas sampling is essential for the diagnosis. If the pH is low (under 7. 35) and the bicarbonate levels are decreased (<24mmol/l), metabolic acidemia is present, and metabolic acidosis is presumed. Due to respiratory compensation (hyperventilation), carbon dioxide is decreased and conversely oxygen is increased, thus lowering the serum carbon dioxide levels, resulting in some degree of compensation. Compensatory mechanisms. Metabolic acidosis is either due to increased generation of acid or an inability to generate sufficient bicarbonate. The body regulates the acidity of the blood by four buffering mechanisms.* bicarbonate buffering system* intracellular buffering by absorption of hydrogen atoms by various molecules, including proteins, phosphates and carbonate in bone.* Respiratory compensation* Renal compensation. Buffer. The decreased bicarbonate that distinguishes metabolic acidosis is therefore due to two separate processes the buffer (from water and carbon dioxide) and additional renal generation.

E. G evolution correlates well with the severity of encephalopathy, o However EEG has little specificity in differentiating etiologies in metabolic encephalopathy.# For example, though triphasic waves are most frequently mentioned in hepatic encephalopathy, they can also he seen in uremic encephalopathy or even in aged psychiatric patients treated with lithium, o Spikes and waves may appear in hypo or hyperglycemia uremic encephalopathy or vitamin deficiencies. Common principles of EEG changes in metabolic encephalopathy are: -i) Varied degrees of slowingii). Associated mixtures of epileptic discharge. High incidence of triphasic waves. Reversibility after treatment of underlying causes. Metabolic encephalopathy. EEG rythm. Grade I (almost normal). Dominant activity is alpha rhythm with minimal teta activity.

        "exp": "Answer: b) Urine output (Merck manual & Handbook of Evidence based critical care). Treatment of shock is directed at maintaining. CVP of 8-12 mm Hg. Mean arterial pressure of >65 mm. Hg (systolic pressure >90 mm. Hg). Cardiac index of 2-4 L/min/m2. The urine output rate should be kept at >0. 5 mL/kg per hour. Adequate end-organ perfusion is best indicated by urine output of > 0. 5 to 1 mL/kg/h. Heart rate, mental status, and capillary refill may be affected by the underlying disease process and are less reliable markers. Because of compensatory vasoconstriction, mean arterial pressure (MAP) is only a rough guideline; organ hypoperfusion may be present despite apparently normal values. An elevated arterial blood lactate level reflects hypoperfusion; however, levels do not decline for several hours after successful resuscitation. HEMODYNAMIC SUPPORT IN SHOCKNS or RL (crystalloids) is the first choice for acute stage of resuscitation. When fluid requirements are high, colloids (Dextran, gelatin, 5% albumin) are of use. Packed RBC should be given at 10 mL/kg to maintain hematocrit at 30% or Hb 9 g/d. LBolus of 20ml/Kg given rapidly over 5-10 mins; if no response - repeat bolus. Patients who do not respond to rapid boluses of 40-60ml/Kg in the first hour are labeled as fluid refractory shock and inotrophic support (dopamine or dobutamine) should be given.

CO2 is expected to decrease 1. 25 mm of Hg for each mmol/L decrease in The normal values of PCO2 and HCO3-Arterial PC02 - 40 +- 2 mm Hg. Arterial - 24 +- mm Hg. Thus a patient with metabolic acidosis and of 12 mmol/L would be expected to have a Pa. CO2 between 24 and 28 mm Hg. (to compensate for the acidosis). Values of Pa. CO2 below 24 or greater than 28 mm Hg will mean mixed disturbance. If Pa. CO2 is < 24 it means metabolic acidosis + respiratory alkalosis (hyperventilation has led to excess CO2 washout causing respiratory alkalosis). If Pa. CO2 > 28 it means - metabolic acidosis respiratory acidosis. Here is a table giving predictions of compensatory response on simple acid base disturbance.

        "exp": "(A) Liddle syndrome[?]. Liddle's Syndrome: Autosomal dominant & is characterized by activating mutation of collecting duct Na+ channel with enhanced sodium reabsorption. o. Low renin, low aldosterone levels. o. Clinical picture mimics Primary Hyperaldosteronism: Hypertension, Hypokalemia & Alkalosis. o. Increased activity of the Epithelial Sodium Channel (E-Na Ch):-Activating kidneys to excrete potassium retaining excessive sodium & water, leading to hypertension.-Classically manifest severe hypertension with hypokalemia, unresponsive to spironolactone yet sensitive to amiloride. o. Hypertension & hypokalemia are, however, variable aspects of the Liddle's phenotype; more consistent features include a blunted aldosteirone response to ACTH & reduced urinary aldosterone excretion. o. It is a 'gain of function' mutation in the gene encoding ENaC of the collecting tubule resulting in autonomous function of these channel without the influence of aldosterone. o. Can be differentiated from Primary Hyperaldosteronism by normal Na+ level and low aldosterone and renin. Other Options. CONGENITAL HYPOKALEMIA ASSOCIATED SYNDROMES[?]. Bartter's Syndrome (BS):-Loss of the transport functions of the TALH nephron segments causes hereditary hypokalemic alkalosis.-Typically suffer from polyuria & polydipsia, due to the reduction in renal concentrating ability. May have an increase in urinary calcium excretion & 20% are hypomagnesemia-Marked activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis.-Antenatal patients suffer from marked electrolyte wasting, polyhydramnios, and hypercalciuria with nephrocalcinosis; renal prostaglandin synthesis and excretion are significantly increased, accounting for much of the systemic symptoms.-Presence of five disease genes for BS, all of them functioning in some aspect of regulated Na+, K+ & Cl- transport by the TALH. [?]. Gitelman's Syndrome (GS):-Loss of the transport functions of the DCT nephron segments causes hereditary hypokalemic alkalosis.-Genetically homogeneous, caused almost exclusively by loss-of-function mutations in thiazide-sensitive Na+-Cl- co transporter of DCT.-Uniformly hypomagnesemic & exhibit marked hypocalciuria, rather than the hypercalciuria typically seen in BS; urinary calcium excretion is thus a critical diagnostic test in GS.-May suffer from chondrocalcinosis, an abnormal deposition of Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate (CPPD) in joint cartilage. [?]. Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis:-Defects in multiple renal tubular transport pathways are associated with hypokalemia.-Loss-of-function mutations in subunits of the acidifying-H+-ATPase in alpha-intercalated cells cause hypokalemic distal renal tubular acidosis, as do many acquired disorders of the distal nephron. [?]. Cushing's Syndrome:-Hypokalemia may also occur with systemic increasing in glucocorticoids.-Increase in pituitary ACTH incidence of hypokalemia is only 10%, whereas, 60-100% in patients with ectopic secretion of ACTH.",
