Ch. 45).Hyponatremia may be due to water excess, diabetes, lipidemia etc. Drugs known to release ADH will cause dilutional hyponatremia include morphine, tricyclics, nicotine, NSAIDs, etc. The individual present with confusion, anorexia, lethargy and cramps. When sodium drops abruptly, seizures, hemiparesis and coma can develop.CLINICAL FEATURES OF HYPONATREMIA# The clinical manifestations of hyponatremia are related to osmotic water shift leading to increased ICF volume, specifically brain cell swelling or cerebral edema.# The symptoms are primarily neurologic.# Patients may be asymptomatic or complain of nausea and malaise.# As the plasma Na+ concentration falls, the symptoms progress to include headache, lethargy, confusion, and obtundation.# Stupor, seizures, and coma do not usually occur unless the plasma Na+ concentration falls acutely below 120 mmol/L or decreases rapidly.# Loss of Na+ and K+, followed by organic osmolytes, from brain cells decreases brain swelling due to secondary transcellular water shifts (from ICF to ECF).# The net effect is to minimize cerebral edema and its symptoms.Composition of World Health Organization Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) A,BConstituentConcentration, mmol/LNa+90K+20Cl-80Citrate10Glucose110Also know:*SLADH is characterized by hypotonic hyponatremia with euvolemia. Low plasma osmolality (<280 mOsm/Kg) with high urine osmolality (>100-150 mOsm/Kg) in suspected patients is diagnostic.* Pneumonia, hyponatremia and diarrhea are almost classic for Legionella.* Under most physiologic conditions, sodium, urea, and glucose generate the osmotic pressure of blood. Plasma osmolality is calculated according to the following expression: Posm = 2Na+ + Glu + BUN (all in mmol/L), or, using conventional laboratory values in which glucose and BUN are expressed in milligrams per deciliter: Posm = 2Na+ + Glu/18 + BUN/2.8. The calculated and determined osmolality should agree within 10-15 mmol/kg H20. When the measured osmolality exceeds the calculated osmolality by >15-20 mmol/kg H20, one of two circumstances prevails. Either the serum sodium is spuriously low, as with hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia (pseudohyponatremia), or osmolytes other than sodium salts, glucose, or urea have accumulated in plasma.",

        "question": "A girl presented with severe hyperkalemia and peaked T waves on ECG. Fastest way of shifting potassium intracellularly is -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Insulin + glucose Tall T waves on ECG indicate cardiac manifestation of hyperkalemia.Intravenous calcium gluconate is the first drug to be administered in a patient with hyperkalemia having E.C.G. abnormalities. - It stabilizes the myocardium immediately. - It acts within minutes and is characterized by improvement in E. C. G. appearance.But an important point to noteIt does not affect transcellular movement of potassium. Thus it won't help in reducing the hyperkalemia.Among the agents which cause transcellular (intracellular) movement of potassium.\"Intravenous insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium levelsThe goals of the therapy for the t/t of acute hyperkalemia in chronological order are as follows:-Antagonize the affect of K+ on excitable cell membranesRedistribution of extracellular potassium into cellsEnhance elimination of potassium from the bodyAntagonize the effect of potassium on excitable cell membraneCalcium directly antagonizes the myocardial effect of hyperkalemia.It does so by reducing the threshold potential of cardiac myocytes.Calcium for injection is available as chloride or gluconate salt.The preferred agent is the gluconate salt since it is less likely than calcium chloride to cause tissue necrosis.The onset of action is < 3 minutes.The duration of action is 30-60 minutes during which time further measures may be undertaken to lower pK.Redistribution of potassium into cells InsulinInsulin shifts potassium into cells.Potassium shift inside the cells is mediated by Na+ K+ ATPase.I. V. insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium level Q.The onset of action is < 15 minutes and the effect is maximal b/w 30-60 minutes.Dextrose is given along with insulin to prevent hypoglycemia.It was believed that administration of dextrose alone, can cause shift of potassium inside the cells by promoting insulin release.The administration of hypertonic dextrose alone for hyperkalemia is not recommended for two reasonsEndogenous insulin levels are unlikely to rise to the level necessary for a therapeutic effect.There is a risk of exacerbating hyperkalemia by inducing hypertonicity. b adrenoceptor agonistsThese drugs can also cause movement of potassium inside the cell.High dose albuterol shows their effect in 30 minutes and persists for at least 2 hours,The effect of insulin is additive with that of albuterol.Patients taking nonselective b adrenoceptor blockers will be unlikely to manifest the hypokalemic effects of albuterolEven among patient's not taking b blockers as many as 40% seem to be resistant to the hypokalemic effect of albuterol.The mechanism for this resistance is unknown and currently, there is no basis for predicting which patients will respond.For this reason albuterol should never be used as a single agent for the treatment of urgent hyperkalemia. BicarbonateBicarbonate (as a bolus injection) was used in the emergency t/t of hyperkalemia. Ironically this dogma was based on studies using a prolonged (4-6 hrs) infusion of bicarbonate.It has now been demonstrated that short term bicarbonate infusion does not reduce pK in patients with dialysis dependent kidney failure, implying that it does not cause K+shift into cells.Sodium bicarbonate seems to have no effect to shift K+ into cells even after several hours.It is likely to be effective especially in combination with a diuretic drug in enhancing urinary K+ elimination in patients with some kidney function, although it use for this purpose has not been evaluated.Elimination of potassium from the bodyHyperkalemia occurs most often in patients with renal insufficiency.However renal potassium excretion may be enhanced even in patients with significant renal impairment by increasing the delivery of solute to the distal nephron.Sodium bicarbonateA sodium bicarbonate infusion administered during 4-6 hrs at a rate designed to alkalinize the urine may enhance urinary K+ excretion and would be desirable especially in patients with metabolic acidosis.The risk of volume expansion with the bicarbonate infusion can be mitigated by use of loop acting diuretics which would, be likely to enhance the kaliuresis.Exchange resinSodium polystyrene sulfonate is a cation exchange resin.In the lumen of intestine it exchanges sodium for secreted potassium.Most of this exchange takes place in the colon, the site of most potassium secretion in the gut.There are two concerns with the use of resin in the t/t of urgent hyperkalemiaThe first is its slow effectWhen given orally, the onset of action is at least 2 hrs and the maximum effect may not be seen for more than 6 hrs.The second is its adverse effectIt can cause intestinal necrosis Dialysis\"Hemodialysis is the method of choice for removing potassium from the body\".The rate of potassium removed with peritoneal dialysis is much slower than with hemodialysis.",

Rapid deep breaths increase the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled,Arterial blood gas sampling is essential for the diagnosis. If the pH is low (under 7.35) and the bicarbonate levels are decreased (<24mmol/l), metabolic acidemia is present, and metabolic acidosis is presumed. Due to respiratory compensation (hyperventilation), carbon dioxide is decreased and conversely oxygen is increased, thus lowering the serum carbon dioxide levels, resulting in some degree of compensation.Compensatory mechanismsMetabolic acidosis is either due to increased generation of acid or an inability to generate sufficient bicarbonate.The body regulates the acidity of the blood by four buffering mechanisms.* bicarbonate buffering system* intracellular buffering by absorption of hydrogen atoms by various molecules, including proteins, phosphates and carbonate in bone.* Respiratory compensation* Renal compensationBufferThe decreased bicarbonate that distinguishes metabolic acidosis is therefore due to two separate processes the buffer (from water and carbon dioxide) and additional renal generation.

Neurological symptoms occur at different levels of low sodium, depending not only on the absolute value but also on the rate of fall.o In patients with hyponatremia that develops over hours, life-threatening seizures and cerebral edema may occur at values as high as 125 mmol/L.o In contrast, some patients with more chronic hyponatremia that has slowly developed over months to years may be asymptomatic even with serum levels <110 mmol.Acute or hyperacute hyponatremiao The hyponatremia developed within the previous 24 hours, it is called \"acute. \"o If the hyponatremia developed over just a few hours due to a marked increase in water intake (self-induced water intoxication, as may be seen in marathon runners, psychotic patients, and users of ecstasy), it is called \"hyperacute. \"Chronic hyponatremiao If it is known that the hyponatremia has been present for more than 48 hours, or if the duration is unknown (such as in patients who develop hyponatremia at home), it is called \"chronic. \"Mild to moderate hyponatremiao Mild hyponatremia is usually defined as a serum sodium concentration between 130 and 135 meq/L.o Moderate hyponatremia is often defined as a serum sodium concentration between 121 and 129 meq/L.Severe hyponatremiao Severe hyponatremia can be defined as a serum sodium of 120 meq/L or less.Symptoms of hyponatremia Absent symptomso Patients with hyponatremia are frequently asymptomatic, particularly if the hyponatremia is chronic and of mild or moderate severity (ie, serum sodium >120 meq/L).o However, such patients may have subclinical impairments in mentation and gait.Mild to moderate symptomso Mild to moderate symptoms of hyponatremia are relatively nonspecific and include headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, gait disturbances, and confusion.o In patients with chronic hyponatremia (ie, >48 hours duration), these findings are not associated with impending herniation; however, in patients with more acute hyponatremia, such symptoms should be considered ominous and may evolve without warning to seizures, respiratory arrest, and herniation.Severe symptomso Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include -# Seizures# Obtundation# Coma# Respiratory arrest.",

May have an increase in urinary calcium excretion & 20% are hypomagnesemia-Marked activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis.-Antenatal patients suffer from marked electrolyte wasting, polyhydramnios, and hypercalciuria with nephrocalcinosis; renal prostaglandin synthesis and excretion are significantly increased, accounting for much of the systemic symptoms.-Presence of five disease genes for BS, all of them functioning in some aspect of regulated Na+,K+ & Cl- transport by the TALH.[?]Gitelman's Syndrome (GS):-Loss of the transport functions of the DCT nephron segments causes hereditary hypokalemic alkalosis.-Genetically homogeneous, caused almost exclusively by loss-of-function mutations in thiazide-sensitive Na+-Cl- co transporter of DCT.-Uniformly hypomagnesemic & exhibit marked hypocalciuria, rather than the hypercalciuria typically seen in BS; urinary calcium excretion is thus a critical diagnostic test in GS.-May suffer from chondrocalcinosis, an abnormal deposition of Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate (CPPD) in joint cartilage.[?]Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis:-Defects in multiple renal tubular transport pathways are associated with hypokalemia.-Loss-of-function mutations in subunits of the acidifying-H+-ATPase in alpha-intercalated cells cause hypokalemic distal renal tubular acidosis, as do many acquired disorders of the distal nephron.[?]Cushing's Syndrome:-Hypokalemia may also occur with systemic increasing in glucocorticoids.-Increase in pituitary ACTH incidence of hypokalemia is only 10%, whereas, 60-100% in patients with ectopic secretion of ACTH.",
