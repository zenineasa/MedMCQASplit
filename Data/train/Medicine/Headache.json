        "question": "A 70-years-old retired military person with good previous medical record complains of bi-temporal headache which is decreased in lying down position. He states that he gets relief by giving pressure over bilateral temples. The patient also complains of loss of appetite with feeling feverish. Diagnosis is:",
        "exp": "Ans. a. Chronic tension headache (Ref: Harrison 19/e p107t, p2587t, 2593-2594, 18/e p122, 2849). Tension-type Headache: Tension-type headache (TTH) is commonly used to describe a chronic head-pain syndrome characterized by bilateral tight, bandlike discomfortQ. Pain typically builds slowly, fluctuates in severity, and may persist more or less continuously for many daysQ. Headache maybe episodic or chronic (present >15 days per month)Q. A useful clinical approach is to diagnose TTH in patients whose headaches are completely without accompanying features such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, osmophobia, throbbing, and aggravation with movementQ. Such an approach neatly separates migraine. Temporal arteritis: Women account for 65% of cases. Migraine: Pain often preceded by aura. QFibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain and tenderness. Patients with FM have an increased prevalence of other syndromes associated with pain and fatigueQ. More common in women. QCommon Causes of Headache. Primary Headache. Secondary Headache* Tension-type (69%)* Migraine (16%)* Idiopathic stabbing (2%)* Exertional (1%)* Cluster (0. 1%)* Systemic infection (63%)* Head injury (4%)* Vascular disorders (1%)* SAH (<1%)* Brain tumor (0. 1%). Tension-Type Headache (TTH). Tension-type headache (TTH) is commonly used to describe a chronic head-pain syndrome characterized by bilateral tight, handlike discomfortQ. Pathophysiology: Pathophysiology is incompletely understoodQ. It seems likely that TTH is due to a primary disorder of CNS pain modulation alone, unlike migraine, which involves a more generalized disturbance of sensory modulation. Clinical Features: TTH: Chronic head-pain syndrome characterized by bilateral tight, bandlike discomfortQ. Pain typically builds slowly, fluctuates in severity, and may persist more or less continuously for many daysQ. Headache maybe episodic or chronic (present > 15 days per month)Q. A useful clinical approach is to diagnose TTH in patients whose headaches are completely without accompanying features such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, osmophobia. throbbing, and aggravation with movementQ. Such an approach neatly separates migraine. Treatment: Tension-Type Headache. Analgesics (acetaminophen, aspirin, or NSAIDs). Behavioral approaches including relaxation can also be effective. Chronic TTH: Amitriptyline is the only proven treatment. QThere is no evidence for the efficacy of acupuncture. Migraine. Cluster Headache* LateralizedQ usually frontotemporal, can be generalized* All age groupsQ are affected* FemalesQ are affected more than males* Family history present. QPresentation:* Pain often preceded by auraQ* Builds up graduallyQ* May lasts for several hoursQ or longer* Usually throbbingQ but maybe dull* Onset is after awakeningQ and quietened by sleepQ* Lateralized, periorbitalQ or less commonly temporal* All ages >10 yearsQ with peak at 30-50 yrsQ* Male preponderanceQ (90%): Men affected 7-8 times more than females.* Hereditary factors usually absent. QPresentation:* Pain (periodic attacks 1-2/day)* Begins without warningQ* Reaches crescendo within 5 minutesQ* Lasts for 45 minutes. QAssociated symptoms:* Nausea, vomiting, diarrheaQ* Photophobia and visual disturbance in the form of photopsia and fortification spectraQ* Paraesthesia with tingling and numbnessQ* Other focal neurological symptoms such as clumsiness and weaknessQ.* Excruciating, deep, explosive pain but only rarely pulsatileQ* Commonly awakens patients from sleep. QAssociated symptoms:* Homolateral lacrimationQ* Reddening of eyeQ* Nasal stuffinessQ* PtosisQ* Nausea. QTemporal Arteritis. Average age of onset is 70 years. QWomen account for 65% of cases. Typical presenting symptoms: Headache, polymyalgia rheumatica, jaw claudication, fever, and weight lossQ. Headache is the dominant symptom, often appears in association with malaise and muscle achesQ. Head pain maybe unilateral or bilateralQ and is located temporally in 50% of patients but may involve any and all aspects of the cranium. Pain usually appears gradually over a few hours before peak intensity is reached; occasionally, it is explosive in onset. The quality of pain is only seldom throbbing; it is almost invariably described as dull and boring, with superimposed episodic stabbing pains similar to the sharp pains that appear in migraine. Most patients can recognize that the origin of their head pain is superficial, external to the skull, rather than originating deep within the cranium (the pain site for migraineurs). Scalp tenderness is present, often to a marked degree; brushing the hair or resting the head on a pillow maybe impossible because of painQ. Headache is usually worse at night and often aggravated by exposure to coldQ. Additional findings may include reddened, tender nodules or red streaking of the skin overlying the temporal arteriesQ, and tenderness of the temporal or, less commonly, the occipital arteries. ESR is often, though not always, elevatedQ; a normal ESR does not exclude giant cell arteritis. A temporal artery biopsy followed by immediate treatment with prednisone 80 mg dailyQ for the first 4-6 weeks should be initiated when clinical suspicion is high. Fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia (FM) is characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain and tenderness. Patients with FM have an increased prevalence of other syndromes associated with pain and fatigueQ. More common in women. QClinical Features: MC presenting complaint: \"Pain all over. \"QPain is typically above and below the waist on both sides of the body and involves the axial skeletonQ (neck, back, or chest). Pain is poorly localized, difficult to ignore, severe in its intensity, and associated with a reduced functional capacity. QFibromyalgia classification criteria. History of chronic widespread pain > 3 monthsQ>11 of 18 tender points. QNeuropsychological Symptoms: Fatigue, stiffness, sleep disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, and depressionQ.",

Traditional theories of mieraine# The once popular vascular theory of migraine, which suggested that migraine headache was caused by the dilatation of blood vessels, while the aura of migraine resulted from vasoconstriction, is no longer considered viable in its original form.# Vasodilatation itself is probably an epiphenomenon, resulting from instability in the central neurovascular control mechanism. Cortical spreading depressiono A causal association between migraine aura and headache is supported by evidence that both are linked to the phenomenon known as cortical spreading depression of Leao. o Cortical spreading depression is a self propagating wave of neuronal and glial depolarization that spreads across the cerebral cortex. o Cortical spreading depression is hypothesized to:# Cause the aura of migraine# Activate trigeminal nerve afferents# Alter blood-brain barrier permeability by matrix metalloproteinase activation and upregulationo The activation of trigeminal afferents by cortical spreading depression in turn causes inflammatory chanties in the pain-sensitive meninues that generate the headache of mieraine through central and peripheral reflex mechanisms, o It has been suggested that migraine without aura may be caused by the occurrence of cortical spreading depression in areas of the brain (eg, cerebellum) where depolarization is not consciously perceived.",
