(d) All of the aboveRef: Urologic emergencies-A Practical Approach, P 117- 118* Xantho-granulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is the end result of severe, chronic infection of the kidney, seen in ~ 0.6 to 1.4% of renal inflammations.* The combination of urinary obstruction, nephrolithiasis, and UTI are important elements in the development of XGP.* Infection is usually secondary to E.coli, or Proteus Mirabilis.* Most patients present with recurrent fevers and urosepsis, anemia, and a painful renal mass.* Microscopically, there are granulomas and lipid-laden macrophages around the abscess.",
