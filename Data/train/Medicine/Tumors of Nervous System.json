Meningiomas are amont the most frequent primary brain tumors. o Although most meningiomas ae benign, their location in the central nervous system can cause serious morbidity or mortality. Clinical presentationo Meningiomas can arise anywhere from the dura most commonly within the skull and at sites of dural reflection (Falx cerebri, fentorium cerebelli, venous sinuses). Other less common sites include the optic nerve sheath and choroid plexus; approximately 10 percent arise in the spine. Very rarely, menningiomas can arise at extradural sites. o Symptoms from a mengioma are determined by the location of the mass and by the time course over which the tumor develops. o Meningioma frequently are extremely slow growing and often are asymptomatic. Asymptomatic tumorso Many meningiomas are asymptomatic or minimally symtomatic, and are discovered incidentlally on a neutroimaging study or at autopsy. Seizureso Seizures are present preoperatively in 25 to 40 percent of patients who are diagnosed with an intracranial meningioma.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) or pseudotumor cerebri or benign intracranial hypertension is a disorder of unknown etiology that predominantly affects obese women of childbearing age. iavascriprishowrefcontentrrefrenceslayer'); The primary problem is chronically elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), and the most important neurologic manifestation is papilledema, which may lead to progressive optic atrophy and blindness. Although IIH, pseudotumor cerebri, and benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) are synonymous, IIH is the preferred term. Causes. Drugs: Amiodarone, antibiotics (eg, nalidixic acid, penicillin, and tetracycline), carbidopa, levodopa, chlordecone, corticosteroids (topical and systemic), cyclosporine, danazol, growth hormone, indomethacin, ketoprofen, lead, leuprolide acetate, levonorgestrel implants, lithium, oral contraceptives, oxytocin, perhexiline, phenytoin, and vitamin A (> 100, 000 U/day)/retinoic add. Systemic diseases: Familial Mediterranean fever. Hypertension. Anemia. Multiple sclerosis. Polyangiitis overlap syndrome. Psittacosis. Chronic renal disease. Reye syndrome. Sarcoidosis. Systemic lupus erythematosus. Thrombocytopenic purpura. Chronic respiratory insufficiency. Compression of cerebral veins by extravascular tumors, secondary thrombosis due to coagulopathy, or relative stenosis due to a venous flow anomaly can result in impaired absorption of CSF and, thus, IIH. Restriction of venous drainage from the head may be impaired with radical neck dissection, even if it is completed only on the right (drainage from the head takes place mainly via the right jugular vein). Endocrine risk factors. Female sex. Reproductive age group. Menstrual irregularity. Obesity. Recent weight gain. Adrenal insufficiency. Cushing disease. Hypoparathyroidism. Hypothyroidism. Excessive thyroxine replacement in children (ie, low thyrotropin levels)TREATMENT: Acetazolamide appears to be the most effective agent for lowering ICPIn the event of intolerance to acetazolamide, furosemide may be used as a replacement diuretic. Headache prophylaxis: headaches can often be controlled with amitriptyline, propranolol, or other commonly prescribed migraine prophylaxis agents. Topiramate is also an excellent choice, in that one of its side effects is weight loss. Corticosteroids are effective in lowering ICP in patients whose IIH has an inflammatory etiology. In addition, they may be used as a supplement to acetazolamide to hasten recovery in patients who present with severe papilledema. Because of their significant adverse effects, corticosteroids should not be considered as a long-term solution for IIH patients.",

Von Hippel-Lindau Disease: This is an autosomal dominant disease in which affected individuals develop hamangioblastomas and cysts involving the pancreas, liver, and kidneys, and have a propensity to develop renal cell carcinoma and pheochromocytoma. Hamangioblastomas are most common in the cerebellum and retina. The gene associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), a tumor suppressor gene, is located on chromosome 3p25-p26. It is the dysregulation of erythropoietin that is responsible for the polycythemia observed in association with hamangioblastomas in about 10% of cases. Hamangioblastomas are highly vascular neoplasms that occur as a mural nodule as sociated with a large fluid-filled cyst. On microscopic examination, the lesion consists of a mixture of variable proportions of capillary-size or somewhat larger thin-walled vessels with intervening stromal cells of uncertain histogenesis characterized by vacuolated, lightly PAS-positive, lipid-rich cytoplasm and an indefinite immunohistochemical phenotype; nonetheless, studies have shown that these cells are the neoplastic element of the hamangioblastomas based on the presence of a second \"hit\" in the previously normal VHL allele.",
