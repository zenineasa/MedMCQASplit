In other words the question is referring to the levels of sweat chloride in patients with cystic fibrosis. Diagnosis of Cystic fibrosis* The diagnosis of CF rests on the combination of clinical criteria and abnormal CFTR function as documented by sweat tests, nasal PD measurements, and CFTR mutation analysis.* Elevated sweat Cl values are nearly pathognomonic for CF.* The sweat concentration values for CL (and Na+) vary with age, but, typically, a Cl concentration of >70 meq/L in adults discriminates between CF and other diseases.* DNA analysis of the most common mutations identify' CF mutations in >90% of affected patients.* The nasal PD measurement can document CFTR dysfunction if the sweat Cl\" test is normal or borderline and two CF mutations are not identified.* DNA analysis is performed routinely in patients with CF, because pancreatic genotype-phenotype relationships have been identified and mutation class-specific treatments are being developed. Gastrointestinal effects of Cystic Fibrosis* The gastrointestinal effects of CF are diverse.* In the exocrine pancreas, the absence of the CFTR Cl- channel in the apical membrane of pancreatic ductal epithelia limits the function of an apical membrane Cl--HCO3- exchanger to secrete bicarbonate and Na+ (by a passive process) into the duct.* The failure to secrete Na+ HCO3- and water leads to retention of enzymes in the pancreas and destruction of virtually all pancreatic tissue.* Because of the lack of Cl- and water secretion, the CF intestinal epithelium fails to flush secreted mucins and other macromolecules from intestinal crypts.* The diminished CFTR-mediated liquid secretion may be exacerbated by excessive absorption of liquid, reflecting abnormalities of CFTR-mediated regulation of Na+ absorption (both mediated by Na+ channels and possibly other Na+ transporters, e. g., Na+-H+ exchangers).* Both dysfunctions lead to dehydrated intraluminal contents and intestinal obstruction.* In the hepatobiliary system, defective hepatic ductal salt (C1-) and water secretion causes thickened biliary secretions, focal biliary cirrhosis, and bile-duct proliferation in approximately 25-30% of patients with CF, * The inability of the CF gallbladder epithelium to secrete salt and water can lead to both chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis.",

Autosomal Dominant Disorder. Patients develop numerous colorectal adenomas as teenagers. It is caused by mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli, or APC gene (5q21). Some FAP patients without APC loss have mutations of the base-excision repair gene MUTYH. At least 100 polyps are necessary for a diagnosis of classic FAP, and as many as several thousand may be present. These growths are morphologically indistinguishable from sporadic adenomas. Colorectal adenocarcinoma develops in 100% of untreated FAP patients before age 30. Prophylactic colectomy is the standard therapy for individuals carrying APC mutations. Colectomy prevents colorectal cancer, but patients remain at risk for neoplasia at other sites. Adenomas may develop elsewhere in the Gl tract, particularly adjacent to the ampulla of Vater and in the stomach. FAP is associated with a variety of extra-intestinal manifestations including: Congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. Gardner syndrome, and. Turcot syndrome. Gardner Syndrome. Osteomas of mandible, skull, and long bones. Epidermal cysts. Desmoid tumors. Thyroid tumors. Dental abnormalities (Unerupted and supernumerary teeth). Turcot Syndrome. Intestinal adenomas. Tumors of the central nervous system. Two third patients have APC gene mutation and develop medulloblastomas. The remaining one third have mutations genes involved in DNA repair and develop glioblastomas. Associated Tumours. Colorectal cancer under the age of 25 years. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Cancer of the ampulla of Vater. Hepatoblastomas. Primary brain tumours (Turcot's syndrome). Osteomas of the jaw. CHRPE (congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium). Gardner's syndrome can cause the development of cutaneous pathology, such as multiple epidermoid cysts and lipomata. Clinical Features and Pathological Outlines. Patients may develop gastric fundic gland polyps, gastric or small bowel flat adenomas, and gastric/ duodenal carcinomas. Duodenal adenomas are very common. Extracolonic manifestations of classical FAP are less common in attenuated FAP. Classically reserved for patients with fewer than 100 colonic adenomatous polyps. Polyps are usually more proximal (i. e., right sided) than in classic FAP. Rectum often spared. Polyps are flat, slightly raised, or plaque-like. May have minute central depression or umbilication. Adenomatous polyps are microscopically similar to sporadic-type adenomas. Extra-colorectal polyps and cancers are important primarily for surveillance purposes. STRATEGIES FOR PREVENTION Clinical Testing of APC Gene. Flexible proctosigmoidoscopy at age 10-12 years; repeat every 1-2 years until age 35; after age 35 repeat every 3 years. Upper Gl endoscopy every 1-3 years starting when polyps first identified. Prophylactic panprotocolectomy. Here are the estimated cancer risks associated with classic FAP. Cancers. Incidence.

Testicular failure. Tanning of the skin. Joint pain and bone pain. Addison's disease. Also chronic adrenal insufficiency, hvpocortiso- lism, and hvpoadrenalism) is a rare, chronic endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce sufficient steroid hormones (glucocorticoids and often mineralocorticoids). The symptoms of Addison's disease develop insidiously. Fatigue, Lightheadedness. Muscle weakness. Fever. Weight loss. Anxiety. Nausea, vomiting. Diarrhea. Headache. Sweating. Changes in mood and personality. Joint and muscle pains. Marked cravings for salt or salty foods due to the urinary losses of sodium. Increased tanning in sun-exposed areas. Darkening of the palmar creases, sites of friction, recent scars, the vermilion border of the lips, and genital skin. Clinical signs. Low blood pressure that falls further when standing i. Orthostatic Hypotension). Most people with primary Addison's have darkening (hyperpignientation) of the skin, including areas not exposed to the sun. Characteristic sites are: Skin creases of the hands. Nipple. Inside of the cheek (buccal mucosa). Old scars may darken. This occurs because melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) share the same precursor molecule, proopiomelanocortin (POMC). After production in anterior pituitary gland. POMC gets cleaved into gamma-MSH. ACTH and beta-lipotropin.

Which people should be screened for hepatitis B.* Hemodialysis patients* Pregnant women* Infants bom mother who are HBSAg positive* Person known or suspected of having bean exposed to HBV - donors of blood, organ and tissue.* People bom in areas where HBSAg prevalence in found to be equal to or more than 2%.* Men who have had sex with man* Drug addicts using injectable drugs HIV positive individuals.* Patients likely to take immunosuppressive treatment or cancer chemotherapy.* Patients with increase liver enzyme of undetermined cause. The tests, called assays, for detection of hepatitis B virus infection involve serum or blood tests that detect either viral antigens (proteins produced by the virus) or antibodies produced by the host. Interpretation of these assays is complex. The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs. Ag) is most frequently used to screen for the presence of this infection. PCR tests have been developed to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in clinical specimens. These tests are used to assess a person's infection status and to monitor treatment. Individuals with high viral loads, characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy. For infections caused by agents such as Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other agents both viral or bacterial origin, commonly used tests determine the presence of specific antibodies produced by the patient's immune system in response to infectious agent. New generation of tests has been developed, which are based on measuring the presence of the infectious agent within the patient sample directly. These tests detect the presence of nucleic acids (the genetic material) of the infections agents in the blood or other samples from the patient. The most common is the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) which can detect 100 copies or more of an infectious agent in a single sample. PCR uses an enzymatic reaction to amplify specific nucleic acid sequences from the infectious agent if they are present in the sample. There are several problems with this method. PCR uses specific nucleic acid sequences (Primers) from an already known sequence of the infectious agent. Therefore, if the infectious agent has not been sequenced, PCR can not be used. Similarly, if the infectious agent mutates very rapidly, the Primers may not recognize the infectious agent and a false negative test will result... Another is a hybridization method where the amplified product is detected by hybridization to an infectious agent specific probe. The second method is based on direct hybridization of the infectious agent's nucleic acid to a synthetic nucleic acid probe. The hybridized infectious agent is then detected by amplifications using non-enzymatic methods. The major drawback of this method is that it is less sensitive (minimum 1, 000 copies must be present in a sample) and requires a larger amount of the patient's sample (minimum 1 ml blood compared with 0. 1 ml for PCR). Microchip assay. There is a need for a sensitive and rapid assay, which is easy to perform, can be used in laboratories with very little experience or no experience in molecular biological methods. The 'first generation' diagnostic microarray developed can detect thirteen infectious agents simultaneously, and can be expanded do detect several hundreds, and reduces the detection time to less than 30 minutes. Because it is based on a rapid hybridization and no enzymatic amplification is used, it is not affected by impurities in the sample. It can be adapted to any type of sample such as blood, stool or tissues. The size of the chip is less than one cm2and the active site is less than 1 mm2.",

HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY - TREATMENT: Sometimes hydration and correction of electrolyte imbalance is all that is necessary. Restriction of dietary protein is nowadays discouraged. There may be some benefit to replacing animal-based protein with vegetable-based protein. The mainstay of treatment for encephalopathy, in addition to correcting precipitating factors, is to use lactulose, a non- absorbable disaccharide, which results in colonic acidification. Catharsis ensues, contributing to the elimination of nitrogenous products in the gut that are responsible for the development of encephalopathy. The goal of lactulose therapy is to promote 2-3 soft stools per day. Poorly absorbed antibiotics are often used as adjunctive therapies for patients who have had a difficult time with lactulose. The alternating administration of neomycin and metronidazole has commonly been employed to reduce the individual side effects of each: neomycin for renal insufficiency and ototoxicity and metronidazole for peripheral neuropathy. More recently, rifaximin at 550 mg twice daily has been very effective in treating encephalopathy without the known side effects of neomycin or metronidazole. Zinc supplementation is sometimes helpful in patients with encephalopathy and is relatively harmless.",

The appearance of malignant tumors of the CNS accompanying polyposis coli defines Turcot's syndrome.# The colonic polyps in all these conditions are rarely present before puberty but are generally evident in affected individuals by age 25. If the polyposis is not treated surgically, colorectal cancer will develop in almost all patients before age 40.# Once the multiple polyps are detected, patients should undergo a total colectomy. Medical therapy with NSAIDs such as sulindac and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib can decrease the number and size of polyps in patients with polyposis coli; however only temporary, and NSAIDs are not proven to reduce the risk of cancer. Colectomy remains the primary therapy/prevention.# Proctosigmoidoscopy is a sufficient screening procedure because polyps tend to be evenly distributed from cecum to anus, making more-invasive and expensive techniques such as colonoscopy or barium enema unnecessary.

However universal precaution is not needed for breast milk (no occupational hazard), Human breast milk has been implicated in perinatal transmission of HIV, and HBs. Ag has been found in the milk of mothers infected with HBV (REF: JAMA 1988; 259: 1353-6. Lifson AR, Bond WW, Petersen NJ, Gravelle CR, Favero MS. Hepatitis B virus in peritoneal dialysis fluid: A potential hazard. Dialysis and Transplantation 1982; 11: 592-600.). Harrison says that's serum, semen and saliva are most infectious for hepatitis B transmission Robbin's 7th ed says that hepatitis B antigen is present in all body secretions except stools. CDC GUIDELINES: (REF: style=\"color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1); font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif\">). Extension of blood and body fluid precautions to all patients is referred to as \"Universal Blood and Body Fluid Precautions\" or \"Universal Precautions. \" Under universal precautions, blood and certain body fluids of all patients are considered potentially infectious for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and other bloodborne pathogens. BODY FLUIDS TO WHICH UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS APPLY: Universal precautions apply to blood and to other body fluids containing visible blood. Blood is the single most important source of HIV, HBV, and other bloodborne pathogens in the occupational setting. Universal precautions also apply to tissues and to the following fluids: semen and vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), synovial fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, and amnio tic fluid. BODY FLUIDS TO WHICH UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS DO NOT APPLY: Universal precautions do not apply to feces, nasal secretions, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, and vomitus unless they contain visible blood. The risk of transmission of HIV and HBV from these fluids and materials is extremely low or nonexistent. Human breast milk has been implicated in perinatal transmission of HIV, and HBs. Ag has been found in the milk of mothers infected with HBV (10, 13). However, occupational exposure to human breast milk has not been implicated in the transmission of HIV nor HBV infection to health-care workers. Whereas universal precautions do not apply to human breast milk, gloves may be worn by health-care workers in situations where exposures to breast milk might be frequent, for example, in breast milk banking.* Universal precautions do not apply to saliva. Saliva of some persons infected with HBV has been shown to contain HBV-DNA at concentrations 1/1, 000 to 1/10, 000 of that found in the infected person s serum. HBs.

        "question": "Hypergastrinemia with hypochlorhydria suggests",
        "exp": "Ans. b (Pernicious anemia) (Ref: Ganong's 22nd edition, p. 485; Harrison's 18th/ch. 105; 17th edition, p. 1869).# Parietal cell-containing gland is preferentially targeted in pernicious anemia, and achlorhydria results.# Achlorhydria, coupled with relative sparing of antral mucosa (site of G cells), leads to hypergastrinemia.# Gastrin levels can be markedly elevated (>500 pg/mL) in patients with pernicious anemia.# Fasting gastrin levels are usually <150 pg/mL. All gastrinoma patients have gastrin level >150-200 pg/mL. PERNICIOUS ANEMIA# Antibodies to parietal cells have been detected in >90% of patients with pernicious anemia and in up to 50% of patients with type A gastritis. The parietal cell antibody is directed against H+, K+-ATPase# These antibodies are observed in patients with vitiligo, Addison's disease and thyroid disease.# Anti-IF antibodies are more specific than parietal cell antibodies for type A gastritis, being present in -40% of patients with pernicious anemia.# Parietal cells are the source of IF, lack of which will lead to vitamin Bp deficiency.# HLA-B8 and -DR3 positive. Pernicious Anemia. Pernicious anemia (PA) may be defined as a severe lack of IF due to gastric atrophy. The ratio of incidence in men and women among whites is 1: 1. 6, and the peak age of onset is 60 years, with only 10% of patients being <40 years of age. The disease occurs more commonly than by chance in close relatives and in persons with other organ-specific autoimmune diseases, e. g., thyroid diseases, vitiligo, hypoparathyroidism, and Addison's disease. It is also associated with hypogammaglobulinemia, with premature graying or blue eyes, and persons of blood group A. An association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 3 has been reported in some but not all series and, in those with endocrine disease, with HLA-B8, -B12, and -BW15. Life expectancy is normal in women once regular treatment has begun. Men have a slightly subnormal life expectancy as a result of a higher incidence of carcinoma of the stomach than in control subjects. Gastric output of hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and IF is severely reduced. The serum gastrin level is raised, and serum pepsinogen I levels are low. Gastric Biopsy. This usually shows atrophy of all layers of the body and fundus, with loss of glandular elements, an absence of parietal and chief cells and replacement by mucous cells, a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate, and perhaps intestinal metaplasia. The infiltrate of plasma cells and lymphocytes contains an excess of CD4 cells. The antral mucosa is usually well preserved. Helicobacter pylori infection occurs infrequently in PA, but it has been suggested that H. pylori gastritis occurs at an early phase of atrophic gastritis and presents in younger patients as iron-deficiency anemia but in older patients as PA. H. pylori is suggested to stimulate an autoimmune process directed against parietal cells, with the H. pylori infection then being gradually replaced, in some individuals, by an autoimmune process. Serum Antibodies. Two types of IF immunoglobulin G antibody may be found in the sera of patients with PA. One, the \"blocking, \" or type I, antibody, prevents the combination of IF and cobalamin, whereas the \"binding, \" or type II, antibody prevents attachment of IF to ileal mucosa. Type I occurs in the sera of 55% of patients, and type II in 35%. IF antibodies cross the placenta and may cause temporary IF deficiency in a newborn infant. Patients with PA also show cell-mediated immunity to IF. Type I antibody has been detected rarely in the sera of patients without PA but with thyrotoxicosis, myxedema, Hashimoto's disease, or diabetes mellitus and in relatives of PA patients. IF antibodies also have been detected in gastric juice in 80% of PA patients. These gastric antibodies may reduce absorption of dietary cobalamin by combining with small amounts of remaining IF. Parietal cell antibody is present in the sera of almost 90% of adult patients with PA but is frequently present in other subjects. Thus, it occurs in as many as 16% of randomly selected female subjects age >60 years. The parietal cell antibody is directed against the end subunits of the gastric proton pump (H\\K+-ATPase). JUVENILE PERNICIOUS ANEMIAThis usually occurs in older children and resembles PA of adults. Gastric atrophy, achlorhydria, and serum IF antibodies are all present, although parietal cell antibodies are usually absent. About one-half of these patients show an associated endocrinopathy such as autoimmune thyroiditis, Addison's disease, or hypoparathyroidism; in some, mucocutaneous candidiasis occurs.# Multiple processes can lead to an elevated fasting gastrin level: gastric hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria (the most frequent), with or without pernicious anemia; retained gastric antrum; G cell hyperplasia; gastric outlet obstruction; renal insufficiency; massive small-bowel obstruction; and conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, vitiligo, diabetes mellitus, and pheochromocytoma. Although a fasting gastrin >10 times normal is highly sugg. of ZE, two-thirds of patients will have fasting gastrin levels that overlap with levels found in the more common disorders outlined above.# The next step in establishing a biochemical diagnosis of gastrinoma is to assess acid secretion. Nothing further needs to be done if decreased acid output is observed. In contrast, normal or elevated gastric acid output suggests a need for additional tests. Up to 12% of patients with common PUD may have comparable levels of acid secretion. A BAO/MAO ratio >0. 6 is highly suggestive of ZES, but a ratio <0. 6 does not exclude the diagnosis. Pentagastrin is no longer available in the United States, making measurement of MAO virtually impossible. An endoscopic method for measuring gastric acid output has been developed but requires further validation. If the technology for measuring gastric acid secretion is not available, a basal gastric pH =3 virtually excludes a gastrinoma.# Gastrin provocative tests are the secretin stimulation test and the calcium infusion study. The most sensitive and specific gastrin provocative test for the diagnosis of gastrinoma is the secretin study. An increase in gastrin of =200 pg within 15 min of secretin injection has a sensitivity and specificity of >90% for ZES.# The calcium infusion study is less sensitive and specific than the secretin test, with a rise of >400 pg/mL observed in -80% of gastrinoma patients. The lower accuracy, coupled with it being a more cumbersome study with greater potential for adverse effects, makes calcium infusion less useful. It is used in the rare cases where the patient's clinical characteristics are highly suggestive of ZES. but the secretin stimulation is inconclusive.",
