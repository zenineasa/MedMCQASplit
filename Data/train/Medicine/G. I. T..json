In other words the question is referring to the levels of sweat chloride in patients with cystic fibrosis. Diagnosis of Cystic fibrosis* The diagnosis of CF rests on the combination of clinical criteria and abnormal CFTR function as documented by sweat tests, nasal PD measurements, and CFTR mutation analysis.* Elevated sweat Cl values are nearly pathognomonic for CF.* The sweat concentration values for CL (and Na+) vary with age, but, typically, a Cl concentration of >70 meq/L in adults discriminates between CF and other diseases.* DNA analysis of the most common mutations identify' CF mutations in >90% of affected patients.* The nasal PD measurement can document CFTR dysfunction if the sweat Cl\" test is normal or borderline and two CF mutations are not identified.* DNA analysis is performed routinely in patients with CF, because pancreatic genotype-phenotype relationships have been identified and mutation class-specific treatments are being developed. Gastrointestinal effects of Cystic Fibrosis* The gastrointestinal effects of CF are diverse.* In the exocrine pancreas, the absence of the CFTR Cl- channel in the apical membrane of pancreatic ductal epithelia limits the function of an apical membrane Cl--HCO3- exchanger to secrete bicarbonate and Na+ (by a passive process) into the duct.* The failure to secrete Na+ HCO3- and water leads to retention of enzymes in the pancreas and destruction of virtually all pancreatic tissue.* Because of the lack of Cl- and water secretion, the CF intestinal epithelium fails to flush secreted mucins and other macromolecules from intestinal crypts.* The diminished CFTR-mediated liquid secretion may be exacerbated by excessive absorption of liquid, reflecting abnormalities of CFTR-mediated regulation of Na+ absorption (both mediated by Na+ channels and possibly other Na+ transporters, e. g., Na+-H+ exchangers).* Both dysfunctions lead to dehydrated intraluminal contents and intestinal obstruction.* In the hepatobiliary system, defective hepatic ductal salt (C1-) and water secretion causes thickened biliary secretions, focal biliary cirrhosis, and bile-duct proliferation in approximately 25-30% of patients with CF, * The inability of the CF gallbladder epithelium to secrete salt and water can lead to both chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis.",

Combination therapy (interferon + ribavirin) is the treatment of choice unless contraindication to the combination therapy exists. Monotherapy with interferon is the alternative regimen (primarily for pts. in whom combination therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated).

Testicular failure. Tanning of the skin. Joint pain and bone pain. Addison's disease. Also chronic adrenal insufficiency, hvpocortiso- lism, and hvpoadrenalism) is a rare, chronic endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce sufficient steroid hormones (glucocorticoids and often mineralocorticoids). The symptoms of Addison's disease develop insidiously. Fatigue, Lightheadedness. Muscle weakness. Fever. Weight loss. Anxiety. Nausea, vomiting. Diarrhea. Headache. Sweating. Changes in mood and personality. Joint and muscle pains. Marked cravings for salt or salty foods due to the urinary losses of sodium. Increased tanning in sun-exposed areas. Darkening of the palmar creases, sites of friction, recent scars, the vermilion border of the lips, and genital skin. Clinical signs. Low blood pressure that falls further when standing i. Orthostatic Hypotension). Most people with primary Addison's have darkening (hyperpignientation) of the skin, including areas not exposed to the sun. Characteristic sites are: Skin creases of the hands. Nipple. Inside of the cheek (buccal mucosa). Old scars may darken. This occurs because melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) share the same precursor molecule, proopiomelanocortin (POMC). After production in anterior pituitary gland. POMC gets cleaved into gamma-MSH. ACTH and beta-lipotropin. The subunit ACTH undergoes further cleavage to produce 'alpha-MSH', the most important MSH for skin pigmentation. Associated with. Type I diabetes.

        "exp": "(PCR) (948 - 52 Davidson 21st) (2540-50-H1 8th). Tests used for screaming hepatitis B are estimation of surface antigen (HBSAg) anti HBc and anti HBS antibodies. Which people should be screened for hepatitis B.* Hemodialysis patients* Pregnant women* Infants bom mother who are HBSAg positive* Person known or suspected of having bean exposed to HBV - donors of blood, organ and tissue.* People bom in areas where HBSAg prevalence in found to be equal to or more than 2%.* Men who have had sex with man* Drug addicts using injectable drugs HIV positive individuals.* Patients likely to take immunosuppressive treatment or cancer chemotherapy.* Patients with increase liver enzyme of undetermined cause. The tests, called assays, for detection of hepatitis B virus infection involve serum or blood tests that detect either viral antigens (proteins produced by the virus) or antibodies produced by the host. Interpretation of these assays is complex. The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs. Ag) is most frequently used to screen for the presence of this infection. PCR tests have been developed to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in clinical specimens. These tests are used to assess a person's infection status and to monitor treatment. Individuals with high viral loads, characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy. For infections caused by agents such as Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or other agents both viral or bacterial origin, commonly used tests determine the presence of specific antibodies produced by the patient's immune system in response to infectious agent. New generation of tests has been developed, which are based on measuring the presence of the infectious agent within the patient sample directly. These tests detect the presence of nucleic acids (the genetic material) of the infections agents in the blood or other samples from the patient. The most common is the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) which can detect 100 copies or more of an infectious agent in a single sample. PCR uses an enzymatic reaction to amplify specific nucleic acid sequences from the infectious agent if they are present in the sample. There are several problems with this method. PCR uses specific nucleic acid sequences (Primers) from an already known sequence of the infectious agent. Therefore, if the infectious agent has not been sequenced, PCR can not be used. Similarly, if the infectious agent mutates very rapidly, the Primers may not recognize the infectious agent and a false negative test will result... Another is a hybridization method where the amplified product is detected by hybridization to an infectious agent specific probe. The second method is based on direct hybridization of the infectious agent's nucleic acid to a synthetic nucleic acid probe. The hybridized infectious agent is then detected by amplifications using non-enzymatic methods. The major drawback of this method is that it is less sensitive (minimum 1, 000 copies must be present in a sample) and requires a larger amount of the patient's sample (minimum 1 ml blood compared with 0. 1 ml for PCR). Microchip assay. There is a need for a sensitive and rapid assay, which is easy to perform, can be used in laboratories with very little experience or no experience in molecular biological methods. The 'first generation' diagnostic microarray developed can detect thirteen infectious agents simultaneously, and can be expanded do detect several hundreds, and reduces the detection time to less than 30 minutes. Because it is based on a rapid hybridization and no enzymatic amplification is used, it is not affected by impurities in the sample. It can be adapted to any type of sample such as blood, stool or tissues. The size of the chip is less than one cm2and the active site is less than 1 mm2.",
