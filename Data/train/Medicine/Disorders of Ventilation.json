It is usually a feature of type 1 respiratory failure.* Type 1 respiratory failure is defined as a low level of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia) without an increased level of carbon dioxide in the blood (hypercapnia), and the Pa. CO2 may be normal or low.* It is typically caused by a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch; the volume of air flowing in and out of the lungs is not matched with the flow of blood to the lungs. The basic defect in Type 1 respiratory failure is failure of oxygenation characterized by: Pa. O2. Decreased (< 60 mm. Hg ). Pa. CO2. Normal or Decreased (<50 mm. Hg )PA-a. O2. Increased",

The central respiratory drive is maintained in patients with neuromuscular disorders. Thus, hypoventilation is secondary to respiratory muscle weakness. o Chest wall deformities such as kyphoscoliosis, fibrothorax, and those occurring post thoracoplasty are associated with alveolar hypoventilation leading to respiratory insufficiency and respiratory failure. o Hypoventilation is not uncommon in patients with severe COPD. Alveolar hypoventilation in COPD usually does not occur unless the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is less than IL or 35% of the predicted value. However, many patients with severe airflow obstruction do not develop hypoventilation.",
