The examiner was most probably asking about the highest levels of LDH. LDH is used in assessment of tissue breakdown in general or hemolysis. It is used to follow-up cancer (especially lymphoma) patients, as cancer cells have a high rate of turnover with destroyed cells leading to an elevated LDH activity. LDH in NHL patients with active disease is higher than in normal subjects. LDH is the same as in normal subjects in the How-grade\" and 'Intermediate-grade\" malignancies. I. e. LDH is more related to the spread of the lymphoma. (REF: style=\"color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1); font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif\">). In lymphomas the term \"bulky\" disease signifies a nodal mass whose greatest dimension is more than 10 centimeters in size, and/or a widening of the mediastinum by more than one-third. The above text clearly signifies that the highest levels of LDH are seen in bulky disease.
