An intradermal injection of specially prepared tissue derived from the spleen of a known sarcoidosis patient is biopsied 4-6 weeks after injection. If noncaseating granulomas are seen, this is highly specific for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Unfortunately, there is no commercially available Kviem-Siltzbach reagent, and some locally prepared batches have lower specificity. Thus, this test is of historic interest and is rarely used in current clinical practice.

Important points about clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis: The presentation of sarcoidosis ranges from patients who are asymptomatic to those with organ failure. Respiratory complaints including cough and dyspnea are the most common presenting symptoms. Lung involvement occurs in >90% of sarcoidosis patients. Symptoms related to cutaneous and ocular disease are the next two most common complaints. Skin involvement is eventually identified in over a third of patients with sarcoidosis. Although sarcoidosis can affect any organ of the body, rarely does it involve the breast, testes, ovary, or stomach. Nonspecific constitutional symptoms include fatigue, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Fatigue is perhaps the most common constitutional symptom that affects these patients. Given its insidious nature, patients are usually not aware of the association with their sarcoidosis until their disease resolves. FREQUENCY OF ORGAN INVOLVEMENTOrgan. Presentation, %Lung95. Skin24.
