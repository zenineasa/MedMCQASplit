        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Parkinson's disease Diseases of Basal gangliao Three distinct biochemical pathways in the basal ganglia normally operate in a balanced fashion: -1 ) Nigrostriatal dopaminergic system; 2) Intrastriatal cholinergic system; 3) GABAergic system which projects from the stratum to globus pallidus and substantia nigra. o When one or more of these pathways become dysfunctional, characteristic motor abnormalities occur. There may be two types of disorder: -Hyperkinetic: - There is excessive and abnormal movement, e. g., Chorea, athetosis and ballism. Hypokinetic: - There is paucity of movement, e. g., Akinesia and Bradykinesia. o The classical example of Basal ganglia disease is Parkinsonism in which there is degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The fibers to putamen are most severely affected. A patient with parkinsonism have both hypokinetic and hyperkinetic features: -Hypokinetic: - Bradykinesia, Akinesia. Hyperkinetic: - Cogwheel rigidity, Resting tremor. Disease. Part of Basal ganglia involvedo Parkinsonism. Substantia nigra pars compacta - Nigrastriatal pathwayo Huntington chorea. Striatum (mainly caudate nucleus; may be putamen)o Ballism. Subthalamic nucleio Athetosis. Globus pallidus (mainly) and Subthalamic nucleus. Pathologic Examination in Parkinsons shows: o Gross / Macroscopically: Pallor of the substantia nigra and locus ceruleuso Microscopic Examination: Loss of catecholaminergic neurons in these regions +# gliosis. Lewy bodies. o Lewy Bodies: are inclusion bodies found within neurons in Parkinsons disease. Lewy bodies are single or multiple, intra-cytoplasmic, eosinophilic, round and elongated inclusions that often have a dense core surrounded by a pale halo. Ultrastructurally These are composed of fine filaments, densely packed in the core but loose at the rim.",

Ref.: Harrison 19th ed. / 2609* In the early presentation, about 70 % patients experience a slight tremor in the hand or foot on one side of the body, or less commonly in the jaw or face. The tremor consists of a shaking or oscillating movement, and usually appears when a person's muscles are relaxed, or at rest, hence the term'resting tremor.* The tremor of PD can be exacerbated by stress or excitement, sometimes attracting unwanted notice. The tremor often spreads to the other side of the body as the disease progresses, but usually remains most apparent on the initially affected side.",

REF: Clinical Neurology for Psychiatrists 6th ed by David Myland Kaufman page 409 Pathophysiology of Parkinsonism:* The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease result from the death of dopamine generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain.* The pathology of the disease is characterized by the accumulation of a protein called alpha synuclein into inclusions called Lewy bodies in neurons, and from insufficient formation and activity of dopamine produced in certain neurons within parts of the midbrain. DOPAMINE SYNTHESISPhenylalanine. Phenylalanine hydroxylase-----------------------Tyrosine. Tyrosine. Tyrosine hydroxylase*-----------------------DOPADOPADOPA decarboxylase-----------------------Dopamine. The presynaptic nigrostraital tract neurons normally converts phenylalanine to dopamine. In Parkinsons disease however the nigrostraital neurons slowly degenerate and looses their Tyrosine hydroxylase. The loss of tyrosine hydroxylase represents the critical failure in Parkinsons disease because this enzyme is the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis",
