Spider nevi are caused due to vasodilatation of vessels and are usually associated with cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is associated with vasodilatation and hyperdynamic circulation. \"The cause of vasodilatation in cirrhosis is uncertain but it is believed to be related to the increased level of estrogen in the body. Estrogen is a female sex hormone which is metabolized by liver. Thus in liver diseases its level tends to increase which is believed to cause vasodilatation, resulting in spider naevi.",

When immune dysfunction affects two or more endocrine glands and other nonendocrine immune disorders are present, the polyglandular autoimmune (PGA) syndromes should be considered. The PGA syndromes are classified as two main types: Type I syndrome starts in childhood and is characterized by mucocutaneous candidiasis. hypoparathyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency. Type II, or Schmidt syndrome is more likely to present in adults and most commonly includes adrenal insufficiency, thyroiditis, or type / diabetes mellitus & Graves disease.
