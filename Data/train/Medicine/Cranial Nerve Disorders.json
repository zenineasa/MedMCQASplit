Following a lesion of the hypoglossal nucleus or nerve* ATROPHY of the muscles of the IPSILATERAL one-half of the tongue occurs.* FASCICULATIONS (tiny, spontaneous contractions) can be seen.* Upon protrusion, the tongue will deviate TOWARD the side of the lesion (i. e.} same side). This is due to the unopposed action of the genioglossus muscle on the normally innervated side of the tongue (the genioglossus pulls the tongue forward). The corticobulbar input to the hypoglossal nucleus arises from motor cortex and is predominantly CROSSED. Thus, a lesion in motor cortex will result in deviation of the tongue toward the opposite side or CONTRALATERAL to the lesion. In contrast to the atrophy and fasciculations seen in lesions of the hypoglossal nucleus and nerve (lower motor neuron), NO such signs are present after lesions of the corticobulbar tract.",

Neurologic disease is reported in 5-10%. Any part of the central or peripheral nervous system can be affected. The presence of granulomatous inflammation is often visible on MRI studies. The MRI with gadolinium enhancement may demonstrate space-occupying lesions, hut the MR! can be negative due to small lesions or the effect of systemic therapy in reducing the inflammation. The cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) findings include lymphocytic meningitis with a mild increase in protein. The CSF glucose is usually normal but can be iowr. Certain areas of the nervous system are more commonly affected in neurosarcoidosis. Cranial nerve involvement. Basilar meningitis. Myelopathy. Anterior hypothalamic disease with associated diabetes nsipidus. Seizures and cognitive changes also occur. Of ihe cranial nerves, seventh nerve paralysis can be transient and mistaken for Bell's palsy (idiopathic seventh nerve paralysis). Optic neuritis is another cranial nerve manifestation of sarcoidosis. This manifestation is more chronic and usually requires long-term systemic therapy, it can be associated with both anterior and posterior uveitis.",
