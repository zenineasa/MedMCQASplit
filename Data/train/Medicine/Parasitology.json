Both medicines are almost 100% effective in curing the disease if given soon after infection at the onset of the acute phase including the cases of congenital transmission. The efficacy of both diminishes, however, the longer a person has been infected. Treatment is also indicated for those in whom the infection has been reactivated (for example, due to immunosuppression), and for patients during the early chronic phase. Infected adults, especially those with no symptoms, should be offered treatment because antiparasitic treatment can also prevent or curb disease progression and prevent congenital transmission in pregnant women. In those cases the potential benefits of medication in preventing or delaying the development of Chagas disease should be weighed against the long duration of treatment (up to 2 months) and possible adverse reactions (occurring in up to 40% of treated patients). Benznidazole and nifurtimox should not be taken by pregnant women or by people with kidney or liver failure. Nifurtimox is also contraindicated for people with a background of neurological or psychiatric disorders. Additionally, specific treatment for cardiac or digestive manifestations may be required.",

Amoebic Liver Abscess. Caused by Entamoeba histolytica whose cysts are acquired through the feco-oral route. QTrophozoites reach the liver through portal venous systemQ. Solitary aand more common in right lobe of liverQ. Low incidence of invasive amoebiasis in menstruating women. QMajority of patients are young men (may be due to heavy alcohol consumption). Pathogenesis: MC form of invasive disease is colitis, frequently affects the cecum and ascending colon. QIn colon: Flask-shaped ulcersQ (MC site: Cecum and ascending colon)QSynchronous hepatic abscess is found in one third of patients with active amebic colitis. Clinical Features: MC symptom is abdominal pain. QTypical clinical picture: Patient of 20-40 years of age, with history of travel to endemic area, presents with fever, chills, anorexia, right upper quadrant painQ. Results from an obligatory colonic infection, a recent history of diarrhea are uncommonQ.\\Active colitis and amoebic liver abscess rarely occur simultaneously, as a rule colonic lesions are silent. QJaundice is rare. QRaised PT is MC LFT abnormalityQ. Diagnosis: USG and CT are the main diagnostic modalities. QDiagnosis is confirmed by serological testsQ (ELISA) for antiamoebic antibodies. Cultures of amoebic abscess are usually sterile or negativeQ. CXR: Elevated hemi diaphragm, right sided pleural effusion or atelectasis. ALA: Reddish-brown anchovy pasteQ; more reliable characteristic than color is the odour of the fluid. Treatment: Metronidazole (750 mg orally TDS X 10-14 days) is the mainstay of treatment and is curative in over 90% of patientsQ, clinical improvement is seen within 3 days. Luminal agents include iodoquinol, paromomycin and diloxanide furoateQ. The average time to radiologic resolution of abscess is 3-9 months. QIndications of Aspiration in ALA* Diagnostic uncertaintyQ* Failure to respond to therapy in 3-5 daysQ* Pyogenic superinfectionQ* High risk of rupture (size > 5 cm. left lobe abscess)Q* PregnancyQ (Therapeutic trial with high dose Metronidazole is deemed inappropriate). Complications: Most frequent complications: Rupture into the peritoneum (MC)Q, pleural cavity, or pericardium. Size of abscess appears to be the most important risk factor for rupture. Laparotomy is indicated in cases of doubtful diagnosis, hollow viscus perforation, fistulization resulting in hemorrhage or sepsis, and failure of conservative therapy.
