Ref: Maheshwari 5th ed. 169* In most cases of compressive radial neuropathy, the type of injury is a \"neuropraxia\" that does not involve damage to the axon.* Neuropraxia is classified as a transient conduction block of motor or sensory function without neuronal degeneration. Therefore, despite decreased motor function, patients with neuropraxia are able to regain normal neurologic function within several weeks to months.* Posture-induced radial neuropathy, known as Saturday night palsy, occurs because of compression of the radial nerve. The clinical symptoms of radial neuropathy are similar to stroke or a herniated cervical disk, which makes it difficult to diagnose. Neurotmesis. Axonotmesis. Neurapraxia.

Beevor's sign is characteristic of spinal cord injury b/w T6-T10 levels. This occurs because the upper abdominal muscles such as rectus abdominis are intact at the top of the abdomen but weak at the lower portion. Thus when the patient is asked to do a sit up only the upper muscles contract pulling the umbilicus towards the head in patients who are abnormal.
