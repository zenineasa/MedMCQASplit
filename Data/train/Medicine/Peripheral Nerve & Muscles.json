The usually pattern is an ascending paralysis and cranial nerve involvement is common. o The acute immune-mediated polyneuropathies are classified under the eponym Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). o GBS is an acute monophasic paralyzing illness, usually provoked by a preceding infection. o Guillain Barre syndrome is thought to result from an immune response to preceeding infection that cross reactss to peripheral nerve. o The triggerring events for GBS is# Campylobacter jejuni (most common)# Cytomegalovirus# Epstein Barr virus# HIVOt her trigering events: -# Immunisation# Surgery# Trauma# Bone marrow transplantationo Historically, the Gui. Uain-Barre syndrome (GBS) was considered a single disorder: o It now is recoginized as a heterogeneous syndrome with several variant forms. o The major forms are: -# Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP).# The Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS).# Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN)# Acute sensorimotor axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), Each form of GBS has distinguishing clinical, pathophysiologic and pathologic feature. Pathogenesiso One proposed mechanism for Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is that an antecedent infection evokes an immune response, which in turn cross-reacts with peripheral nerve components because of the sharing of cross-reactive epitopes \"molecular mimicry \"o The end result is an acute polyneuropathy. o This immune response is directed towards the mvelin or the axon ofperipheral nerve. o Immune reactions directed against epitopes in Schwann cell surface membrane or myelin cause acute inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (AIDP). o The pathology is that of multifocal inflammatory demyelination starting at the level of the nerve roots. o The earliest changes are frequently seen at the nodes of Ranvier. o Both the cellular and humoral immune responses participate in the process. o Invasion by activated T-cell is followed by macrophage-mediated demyelination with evidence of complement and immunoglobulin deposition on myelin and Schwann cell. o No specific myelin antigen have been identified. Symptomso The major clinical manifestations are motor manifestations i. e., weakness that evolves more or less symmetrically over a period of several days. o Weakness usually begins in the lower extremities and progressively involves the trunk, the upper limbs and finally the bulbar muscles a pattern known as landry ascending paralysisQ, o Proximal and distal muscles are involved relatively symmetricallyQ but asymmetry is seen in 9% of patientso Deep tendon reflexes usually disappearQ. o The weakness progresses in about 5% of patient to total motor paralysisQ with respiratory failureQ within few days. o Cranial nerve involvement can occur0.# The most common cranial nerve to be involved is facial nerveQ. Sometimes B/L facial nerve involvement can also occur. Other cranial nerves can be involved later on. o Disturbance of autonomicfunctionQ# (Sinus tachycardia and less often bradycardia, facial flushing, fluctuating hypertens ion and hypotension, loss of sweating or episodic profuse diaphoresis). o Urinary retention occurs in about 15% of patientsQ.# Bladder dysfunction usually occurs in severe cases. o Sensory involvement in case of Guillain Bar re svndrome-# Cutaneous sensory deficits e. g loss of pain and temperature sensation are usually relatively mild but function subserved by large sensory fibres such as deep tendon reflexes and proprioception are maximmally affected.",

        "question": "A 9-year-old boy presented with difficulty in climbing stairs and combing. On examination, bilateral calves are swollen and the child uses his feet to stand up on his legs. What is the next diagnostic step?",
        "exp": "Ans. a. Creatine kinase levels (Ref: Harrison 19/e p462e-6. 18/e p3490-3491). Symptoms of difficulty in climbing stairs and combing in a 9 years old boy, with swollen bilateral claves are highly suggestive of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Pseudohypertrophic Muscular Dystrophy). Another evidence is that child uses his feet to stand up on his legs (Gower's sign). Next diagnostic step is creatine kinase levels. \"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: By age 5 years, muscle weakness is obvious by muscle testing On getting up from the floor, the patient uses his hands to climb up himself (Gower's maneuver). Contractures of the heel cords and iliotibial bands become apparent by age 6 years, when toe walking is associated with a lordotic posture. Loss of muscle strength is progressive, with predilection for proximal limb muscles and the neck flexors; leg involvement is more severe than arm involvement. \"--Harrison 19/e p462e-6 \"Creatine kinase (CK) is the preferred muscle enzyme to measure in the evaluation of myopathies. Damage to muscle causes the CK to leak from the muscle fiber to the serum. \"''Serum CK levels are invariably elevated to between 20 and 100 times normal. The levels are abnormal at birth but decline late in the disease because of inactivity and loss of muscle mass. -- Harrison 19/e p462e-6. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (Pseudohypertrophic Muscular Dystrophy). Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the MC hereditary neuromuscular disease affecting all races & ethnic groups. Inheritance: X-linked recessive; Abnormal gene lies on chromosome 21 (Xp21)QAge on onset: 2-5 yearsQ (Doesn't present at birth or during infancyQ). Pathogenesis: Caused by mutation in the gene responsible for producing dystrophin. QDystrophin is subsarcolemmal protein localized to the inner surface of sarcotemma of the muscle fiber. Dystrophin is part of Dystrophin-Glycoprotein sarcolemmal complex and this protein deficiency leads to secondary loss of sarcoglycans & dystroglycans resulting in weakness of sarcolemma, causing membrane tears and muscle fiber necrosisQ. Clinical Features: Early development of child is normal, the disease begins to manifest when the child starts walkingQ. The child walks clumsily, has the difficulty in climbing stairs & the gait is waddlingQ. Hypertrophy of calf muscle is a characteristic sign & is visible by the age of 4-5 years, called pseudohypertrophyQ (not true hypertrophy because muscle is replaced by fat & connective tissue). Pelvic girdle involvement is very common and can be elicited by Gower's sign. QGower's sign: Patient using his arms to climb up the legs in attempting to get up from the floorQ. Hypertrophied Muscles. Atrophied Muscles* Calf, Glutei & DeltoidQ* BrachioradiaiisQ* Tongue muscles* Sternal head of pectoralis majorQ* Supraspinatus. QLoss of muscle strength is progressive; Proximal muscles & neck are involved more. QLeg involvement is more severe than arm involvement. QContracture of heel cords & iliotibial hand occursQ (by age of 6 years). Eventually all muscles are atrophied. QComplications of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Chest Deformity. Cardiac.

Management of Guillain Barre Syndromeo Supportive care is extremely important in Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) since up to 30 percent of patients develop neuromuscular respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.# In addition, severe autonomic dysfunction occurs in about 20percent and warrants intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring. Supportive managemento Close respiratory monitoring with frequent measurement of vital capacity and negative inspiratory force should be instituted in all patients with GBS on admission and continued while weakness is progressing, o Patients with a forced vital capacity <20 mL/kg, maximum inspiratory pressure <30 cm. H2O, or maximum expiratory pressure <40 cm. H2O are at high risk of impending respiratory failure and should undergo urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation. o In the absence of disease-modifying treatment, most patients with GBS show continued progression for up to two weeks, followed by a plateau phase of about two weeks, and then recovery offunction over several weeks to months. Disease modifying treatmento The main modalities of therapy for Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) include:# Plasma exchange (also called plasmapheresis)# Administration of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). o Plasmapheresis is thought to remove circulating antibodies, complementr and soluble biological response modifiers. o The precise mechanism of action for IVIG in GBS is unknown but may include providing anti-idiotypic antibodies, modulating expression and function of Fc receptors, interfering with activation of complement and production of cytokines, and interfering with activation and effector functions of T and B cells. Plasmapheresiso With plasma exchange there is early improvement in muscle strength and reduced need for mechanical ventilation and better recovery. Intravenous immune globulino IVIG is as effective as plasma exchange for the treatment of GBS. o Patients with more severe clinical disease may benefit from longer duration of IVIG treatment. Choice of therapyo Disease-modifying therapy with plasma exchange or IVIG is recommended for nonambulatory patients with GBS who present within four weeks of neuropathic symptom onset. o Therapy with plasma exchange or IVIG is suggested for ambulatory patients with GBS who present within the same timeframe, except for those who are mildly affected and already recovering. o Patients recover sooner when treated early. o The choice between plasma exchange and IVIG is dependent on local availability and on patient-related risk factors, contraindications, and preference.# Because of its ease of administration and wide availability; IVIG is frequently the preferred treatment. Guideline recommendations# Guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology IAA A) have made the following observations: o Treatment with plasma exchange or IVIG hastens recovery- from GBSo Tire beneficial effects of plasma exchange and IVIG are equivalento Combining the two treatments is not beneficialo Glucocorticoid treatment is not recommended. The AAN recommends plasma exchange or IVIG for GBS treatment as follows: o Plasma exchange is recommendedfor nonambulatory adult patients with GBS who start treatment within four weeks of the onset of neuropathic symptoms. Plasma exchange is also recommended for ambulatory patients who start treatment within two weeks of the onset of neuropathic symptoms. o IVIG is recommended for nonambulatory> adult patients with GBS who start treatment within two or possibly four weeks of the onset of neuropathic symptoms.",

GBS manifests as a rapidly evolving areflexic motor paralysis with or without sensory- disturbance. The usual pattern is an ascending paralysis that may be first noticed as rubbery legs. Weakness typically evolves over hours to a few days and is frequently accompanied by tingling dysesthesias in the extremities. The legs are usually more affected than the arms, and facial di pares is is present in 50%' of affected individuals. The lower cranial nerves are also frequently- involved. causing bulbar weakness with difficulty handling secretions and maintaining an airway; the diagnosis in these patients may initially he mistaken for brainstem ischemia. Pain in the neck, shoulder, back, or diffusely over the spine is also common in the early stages of GBS, occurring in 50% of patients. Most patients require hospitalization, and in different series upto 30% require ventilatory assistance at some time during the illness. Fever and constitutional symptoms are absent at the onset. Deep tendon reflexes attenuate or disappear within the first few days of onset. Cutaneous sensory deficits (e. g., loss of pain and temperature sensation) are usually relatively mild, but functions subserved by large sensory fibers, such as deep tendon reflexes and proprioception, are more severely affected. Bladder dysfunction may occur in severe cases hut is usually transient. If bladder dysfunction is a prominent feature and comes early in the course, diagnostic possibilities other than GBS should he considered, particularly spinal cord disease. Once clinical worsening stops and the patient reaches a plateau (almost always within 4 weeks of onset), further progression is unlikely. Autonomic involvement is common and may occur even in patients whose GBS is otherwise mild. The usual manifestations are loss of vasomotor control with wide fluctuation in blood pressure, postural hypotension and cardiac dysrhythmias. Pain is another common feature of GBS; in addition to the acute pain described above, a deep aching pain may be present in w eakened muscles that patients like to having overexercised the previous day. Other pains in GBS include dysesthetic pain in the extremities as a manifestation of sensory nerve fiber involvement. These pains are selflimited and often respond to standard analgesics.",
