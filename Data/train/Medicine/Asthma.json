Airflow obstruction in asthma is the result of numerous pathologic processes. In the small airways, airflow is regulated by smooth muscle encircling the airways lumens; bronchoconstriction of these bronchiolar muscular bands restricts or blocks airflow. A cellular inflammatory infiltrate and exudates distinguished by eosinophils, but also including other inflammatory cell types (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, mast cells, basophils), can fill and obstruct the airways and induce epithelial damage and desquamation into the airways lumen. Helper T lymphocytes and other immune cells that produce proallergic, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, 1L-13). and chemokines (eotaxin) mediate this inflammatory process. Pathogenic immune responses and inflammation may also result from a breach in normal immune regulatory processes (such as regulatory T lymphocytes that produce IL-10 and transforming growth factor -b) that dampen effector immunity and inflammation when they are no longer needed. Hypersensitivity or susceptibility to a variety of provocative exposures or triggers can lead to various processes that contribute to airflow obstruction. Airways inflammation. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Airway edema. Basement membrane thickening. Subepithelial collagen deposition Smooth muscle. Mucous gland hypertrophy. Mucus hypersecretion",
