        "exp": "ANSWER: (D) RASREF: HARRISON'S 18th ed ch: 274. The Anatomy and Physiology of Coma. Almost all instances of diminished alertness can be traced to widespread abnormalities of the cerebral hemispheres or to reduced activity of a special thalamocortical alerting system termed the reticular activating system (RAS). The proper functioning of this system, its ascending projections to the cortex, and the cortex itself are required to maintain alertness and coherence of thought. It follows that the principal causes of coma arelesions that damage the RAS in the upper midbrain or its projections: destruction of large portions of both cerebral hemispheres; andsuppression of reticulocerebral function by drugs, toxins, or metabolic derangementssuch as hypoglycemia, anoxia, uremia, and hepatic failure. The proximity of the RAS to midbrain structures that control pupillary function and eye movements permits clinical localization of the cause of coma in many cases. Pupillary enlargement with loss of light reaction and loss of vertical and adduction movements of the eyes suggests that the lesion is in the upper brainstem. Conversely, preservation of pupillary light reactivity and of eye movements absolves the upper brainstem and indicates that widespread structural lesions or metabolic suppression of the cerebral hemispheres is responsible for coma.",

The Blink Reflex Test (BRT) is a neurophysiological examination used for evaluation of brainstem reflex circuits.: In vertebrate anatomy the brainstem (or brain stem ) is the posterior part of the brain, adjoining and structurally continuous with the spinal cord. It is usually described as including the medulla oblongata (myelencephalon), pons (part of metencephalon), and midbrain (mesencephalon). Pons: The pons contains nuclei that relay signals from the forebrain to the cerebellum, along with nuclei that deal primarily with sleep, respiration, swallowing, bladder control, hearing, equilibrium, taste, eye movement, facial expressions, facial sensation, and postureA number of cranial nerve nuclei are present in the pons. Mid-pons: the 'chief' or 'pontine' nucleus of the trigeminal nerve sensory nucleus (V). Mid-pons: the motor nucleus for the trigeminal nerve (V). Lower down in the pons: abducens nucleus (VI). Lower down in the pons: facial nerve nucleus (VII). Lower down in the pons: vestibulocochlear nuclei (vestibular nuclei and cochlear nuclei) (VIII). The corneal eye blink reflex neural circuit consists of. Trigeminal 1deg afferent (free nerve endings in the cornea, trigeminal nerve, ganglion, root, and spinal trigeminal tract), which end on - Trigeminal 2deg afferent in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, some of which send their axons to - Reticular formation intemeurons, which send their axons bilaterally to - Facial motor neurons in the facial nucleus, which send their axons in the facial nerve to - Orbicularis oculi, which functions to lower the eyelid",
