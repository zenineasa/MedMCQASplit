If primary aldosteronism or Cushing's syndrome is present, correction of the underlying cause, when successful, will reverse the hypokalemia and alkalosis. loss by the stomach or kidneys can be mitigated by the use of proton pump inhibitors or the discontinuation of diuretics. The second aspect of treatment is to remove the factors that sustain the inappropriate increase in HCO3-reabsorption, such as ECFV contraction or K+deficiency. K+deficits should always be repaired. Isotonic saline is recommended to reverse the alkalosis when ECFV contraction is present. If associated conditions preclude infusion of saline, renal HCO3-loss can be accelerated by administration of acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (125-250 mg IV), which is usually effective in patients with adequate renal function but can worsen K+losses.
