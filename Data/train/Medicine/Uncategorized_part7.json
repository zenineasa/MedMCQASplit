Pathophysiology of different types of jaundice Normal blood contains unconjugated bilirubin only (no conjugated bilirubin) Unconjugated bilintbin is water insoluble (lipophilic, lipid soluble) and not filterable by the kidney. Unconjugated bilirubin is taken up from the systemic circulation by hepatocytes (1) Unconjugated bilirubin is then conjugated to bilirubin glucoronide by glucorony I transferase within the hepatocytes(2) Conjugated bilirubin is then excreted into the bile from where it reaches the GIT (3) This is the rate limiting step. Conjugated bilirubin is water soluble and filterable by the kidney Normally, there is no conjugated bilirubin in the systemic circulation and hence no bilirubin is filtered in the kidney or present in the urine. Abnormally When there is hepatocellular dysfunction or bile flow is totally obstructed, conjugated bilirubin -leaks\" into the systemic circulation This conjugated bilirubin may now be excreted by the kidney and be detected in urine. Bilirubin in urine (bilirubinurial Presence of bilirubin in urine suggests a diagnosis of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia either due to hepatocellular jaundice or obstructive jaundice. Within the GIT conjugated bilirubin is degraded/reduced to urobilinogen and then to stercobilinogen Urobilinogen is water soluble and filterable by the kidney Normally, a small poion of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed from the gut and excreted by the kidney (<4 mg/day) In non obstructive hyperbilirubinemia (hemolytic, hepatocellular) the amount of urobilinogen exreatcd by the kidney is increased as more urobilinogen is formed and reabsorbed. Elevated levels of urobilinogen suggest primarily an non obstructive hyperbilirubinemia In obstructive hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated bilirubin does not reach the GIT and hence no urobilinogen is formed Absent levels of urobilinogen suggest a diangnosis of obstructive hyperbilirubinentia Condition Serum Bilirubin Urine Urobilinogen Urine Bilirubin Fecal urobilinogen Normal Direct 0. 1-0. 4 mg/dl Indirect 0. 2-0. 7 mg/dl 0-4 mg/24 h Absent 40-280 mg/24h Hemolytic anemia T Indirect Increased Absent Increased Hepatitis \"i' Direct and indirect Decreased if micro- obstruction is present Present if microobstruction occurs Decreased Obstructive jaundice T Direct Absent Present Trace to absent",

        "exp": "Bell's palsy \u25a0 The most common form of facial paralysis is Bells palsy. Bell's palsy is idiopathic palsy of facial nerve. Clinical Manifestations \u25a0 The onset of Bell's palsy is fairly abrupt, maximal weakness being attained by 48 h as a general rule. \u25a0 Pain behind the ear may precede the paralysis for a day or two. \u25a0 Taste sensation may be lost unilaterally, and hyperacusis may be present. \u25a0 In some cases there is mild cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis. \u25a0 MRI may reveal swelling and uniform enhancement of the geniculate ganglion and facial nerve, and, in some cases, entrapment of the swollen nerve in the temporal bone. \u25a0 Approximately 80% of patients recover within a few weeks or months. \u25a0 The presence of incomplete paralysis in the first week is the most favorable prognostic sign. Pathophysiology \u25a0 Bell's palsy is associated with the presence of herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA in endoneurial fluid and posterior auricular muscle, suggesting that a reactivation of this virus in the geniculate ganglion may be responsible. However, a causal role for herpes simplex virus in Bell's palsy is unproven. Differential Diagnosis \u25a0 Tumors that invade the temporal bone (carotid body, cholesteatoma, dermoid). \u25a0 The Ramsay Hunt syndrome, presumably due to herpes zoster of the geniculate ganglion, consists of a severe facial palsy associated with a vesicular eruption in the pharynx, external auditory canal, and other parts of the cranial integument; often the eighth cranial nerve is affected as well. \u25a0 Acoustic neuromas frequently involve the facial nerve by local compression. \u25a0 Infarcts, demyelinating lesions of multiple sclerosis, and tumors are the common pontine lesions that interrupt the facial nerve fibers; other signs of brainstem involvement are usually present. \u25a0 Bilateral facial paralysis (facial diplegia) occurs in Guillain-Barre' syndrome and also in a form of sarcoidosis known as uveoparotid fever (Heerfordt syndrome). \u25a0 Lyme disease is a frequent cause of facial palsies in endemic areas. \u25a0 The rare Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome consists of a triad of recurrent facial paralysis, recurrent-and eventually permanent-facial (particularly labial) edema, and less constantly, plication of the tongue; \u25a0 Leprosy frequently involves the facial nerve, and facial neuropathy may also occur in diabetes mellitus. \u25a0 All these forms of nuclear or peripheral facial palsy must be distinguished from the supranuclear type. \u25a0 In the latter, the frontalis and orbicularis oculi muscles are involved less than those of the lower part of the face, since the upper facial muscles are innervated by corticobulbar pathways from both motor cortices, whereas the lower facial muscles are innervated only by the opposite hemisphere. Treatment \u25a0 Symptomatic measures include use of paper tape to depress the upper eyelid during sleep and prevent corneal drying, and Massage of the weakened muscles. \u25a0 A course of glucocorticoids, given as prednisone 60 to 80 mg daily during the first 5 days and then tapered over the next 5 days, appears to shorten the recovery period and modestly improve the functional outcome. \u25a0 In one double-blind study, patients treated within 3 days of onset with both prednisone and acyclovir (400 mg five times daily for 10 days) had a better outcome than patients treated with prednisone alone.",

Carcinoid Heart Disease Carcinoid heart disease is the cardiac manifestation of systemic syndrome caused by carcinoid tumors and results primarily from the bioactive products elaborated by carcinoid tumors at other sites. Cardiac involvement predominantly affects the endocardium and valves on the right side of headeg (because bioactive tumor substances are inactivated by the lung) and usually occurs in patients with hepatic metastasisQ (This bypasses the inactivation by the liver & exposes right heart to high levels of bioactive products) This consists of firm plaque like (endocardial) fibrous thickening of the right ventricle tricuspid and pulmonic valves composed predominantly of smooth muscle cells and sparse collagen fibresQ, embedded in an acid mucopolysacharide rich matrix material. Elastic fibres are not present. Right sided cardiac lesions are common and include involvement of the tricuspid valve, pulmoary valve and the right ventricular endocardium. Left sided cardiac lesions are uncommon but may be seen when blood containing the responsible mediator enters the left heart in ceain specific circumstances. - Incomplete inactivation in lung due to very high blood levels - Incomplete inactivation due to 'right to left' intra-cardiac shunt from a patent foramen ovale - Pulmonary carcinoid /pulmonary metastasis Note: Endocardial thickening of Tricuspid valve with Tricuspid stenosis may be seen, but is not a charachteristic feature of carcinoid heart disease.

Classification: They are based on Shape: saccular, fusiform or dissecting Size: non-giant or giant 4 2. 5cm Location: anterior or posterior circulation Disease process: traumatic, non-traumatic, infectious Pathogenesis: The pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms is a combination of degenerative changes in the elastica, and acquired defects and progressive thinning in the muscular layer leading to funnel shaped dilatation. Location: Eighty percent of intracranial aneurysms are located in the anterior circulation (circle of Willis). Twenty-five percent of these are located at the origin of the posterior communicating aery on the internal carotid aery. Clinical features: Most unruptured intracranial aneurysms are completely asymptomatic. Symptoms are usually due to rupture and resultant subarachnoid hemorrhage. Occasionally neurological symptoms may arise due to mass effect of the aneurysm. Oculomotor nerve palsy is a presenting feature in 20% of patients with posterior communicating aery aneurysms Visual field deficits (contralateral homonymous hemianopia) in relation to compression of the optic tract, Mental derangements if the aneurysm compresses the mammillary bodies Pituitary insufficiency if the aneurysm grows into the sella turcica Diagnosis: Aneurysms can be incidental, asymptomatic, or symptomatic.

C: ASDFixed splitting denotes absence of significant variation of the splitting interval with respiration, such that the separation of A2, and P2, remains unchanged during inspiration and expiration. Atrial septal defect, with either normal or high pulmonary vascular resistance, is the classic example of fixed splitting of the second sound. The fixed nature of the split is due to approximately equal inspiratory delay of the aoic and pulmonic components, indicating that the two ventricles share a common venous reservoir. Respiratory splitting of the second sound immediately returns to normal following surgical repair of an atrial septa] defect, although the pulmonic closure sound may remain delayed for weeks or months. Severe right heart failure can lead to a relatively fixed split. This occurs because the right ventricle fails to respond to the increased volume produced by inspiration and because the lungs are so congested that impedance to forward flow from the right ventricle barely falls during inspiration. In anomalous pulmonary venous return without atrial septal defect, fixed splitting is not usually seen despite the simultaneous inspiratory delay in aoic and pulmonic closure",

One-half of the 25 g (1000 mmol) of total body magnesium is located in bone, only one-half of which is insoluble in the mineral phase. Almost all extraskeletal magnesium is present within cells, where the total concentration is 5 mM, 95% of which is bound to proteins and other macromolecules. Because only 1% of body magnesium resides in the ECF, measurements of serum magnesium levels may not accurately reflect the level of total body magnesium stores. Regulation of serum magnesium concentrations is achieved mainly by control of renal magnesium reabsorption. Only 20% of filtered magnesium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, whereas 60% is reclaimed in the c. TAL and another 5-10% in the DCT. Magnesium reabsorption in the c. TAL occurs via a paracellular route that requires both a lumen-positive potential, created by Na. Cl reabsorption and tight-junction proteins encoded by members of the Claudin gene family. Magnesium reabsorption in the c. TAL is increased by PTH, but inhibited by hypercalcemia or hypermagnesemia, both of which activate the Ca. SR in this nephron segment.

Many patients also experience generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and up to one-third have absence seizures. Although complete remission is relatively uncommon, the seizures respond well to appropriate anticonvulsant medication. There is often a family history of epilepsy, and genetic linkage studies suggest a polygenic cause Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy Treatment: Valproate is often used to treat juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Other epilepsy drugs are effective in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy: - LevetiracetamQ - TopiramateQ - LamotrigineQ For most people with JME, treatment is long-term, and often lifelongQ.

It usually affects middle-aged or elderly patients and most frequently arises in the cerebral white matter. GBM is a malignant astrocytoma; it is referred to as grade IV astrocytoma in the WHO classification and grade 4 astrocytoma in the St. Anne-Mayo grading system. This tumor is very aggressive; median survival is approximately 12-14 months following optimal treatment, ie, a combination of surgery and radiation therapy. Medulloblastoma, a much less frequent malignant tumor, affects children; it arises in the posterior fossa in this population. The histogenetic origin of this tumor is unceain, although it is thought to develop from immature cell precursors that give rise to glial and neuronal cells. Meningioma and pituitary adenoma are frequent but benign brain tumors that arise from meningothelial cells and endocrine cells of the adenohypophysis, respectively. Oligodendrogliomas constitute 5% of all primary brain tumors. Although most oligodendrogliomas have benign histologic features (e. g., low mitotic rate and mild nuclear atypia), their complete surgical excision is viually impossible owing to a diffuse, poorly circumscribed pattern of growth. This tumor allows a much longer survival (up to 7-10 years) than GBM, but eventually transforms into a malignant glioma indistinguishable from GBM. Ref: Ropper A. H., Samuels M. A. (2009).

Severe intravascular hemolysis may lead to a similar syndrome. Hyperphosphatemia alters calcium and phosphate ion solubility products, and calcium deposition in soft tissue may occur. The lower circulating concentrations of 1, 25 (OH)2D may fuher aggravate the hypocalcemia by impairing intestinal absorption of calcium. Hyperphosphatemic-induced hypocalcemia inhibits vitamin D synthesis and results in an increase in PTH secretion. Secondary hyperparathyroidism from long-term hyperphosphatemia is usually associated with renal insufficiency. Treatment should be directed towards the hyperphosphatemia in order to correct the hypocalcemia. Hypophosphatemia is more severe than hypocalcemia in vitamin D deficiency states because of the increased secretion of PTH, which is only paly active in elevating blood calcium but is capable of phosphaturia.",

D: 20 petechiae per square inch Dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are acute febrile diseases and caused by four closely related virus serotypes of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. Dengue is transmitted to humans by the Aedes aegypti (rarely Aedes albopictus) mosquito, which feeds during the day. This infectious disease is manifested by a sudden onset of fever, with severe headache, muscle and joint pains (myalgias and ahralgias -- severe pain gives it the name break-bone fever or bonecrusher disease) and rashes. The dengue rash is characteristically bright red petechiae and usually appears first on the lower limbs and the chest; in some patients, it spreads to cover most of the body. The classic dengue fever lasts about six to seven days, with a smaller peak of fever at the trailing end of the disease (the so-called \"biphasic pattern\"). Cases of DHF also show higher fever, haemorrhagic phenomena, thrombocytopenia, and haemoconcentration. A small propoion of cases lead to dengue shock syndrome (DSS) which has a high moality rate. The classic picture is high fever with no localising source of infection, a petechial rash with thrombocytopenia and relative leukopenia. The WHO criteria of dengue haemorrhagic fever; all four criteria must be fulfilled: Fever, bladder problem, constant headaches, severe dizziness and loss of appetite. Hemorrhagic tendency (positive tourniquet test, spontaneous bruising, bleeding from mucosa, gingiva, injection sites, etc.; vomiting blood, or bloody diarrhea) Thrombocytopenia (3or estimated as less than 3 platelets per high power field) Evidence of plasma leakage (hematocrit more than 20% higher than expected, or drop in haematocrit of 20% or more from baseline following IV fluid, pleural effusion, ascites, hypoproteinemia) A tourniquet test/ Rumpel-Leede Capillary-Fragility Test/capillary fragility test determines capillary fragility. The test is defined by the WHO as one of the necessary requisites for diagnosis of Dengue fever. A Mood pressure cuff is applied and inflated to a point between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures for five minutes. The test is positive if there are more than 20 petechiae per square inch.

Ventrolateral Cordotomy Ventrolateral cordotomy is a surgical procedures in which the spinal anterolateral ascending system, for transmission of nociception (pain) known as the spinothalamic tract is interrupted for the relief of severe, intractible pain (cancer pain) not responding to any other conventional measures of pain control.

Ventrolateral cordotomy has been shown to be most effective in the treatment of intermittent shooting pain and evoked pain such as allodynia and hyperpathia, which is essentially mediated by the Lateral Spinothalamic Tract. The optimal candidate for such a procedure is a patient with unilateral severe pain (usually with malignant cancer) not adequately treated with less invasive measures.

The acute HIV syndrome represents the initial or primary response of an immunocompetent adult to the HIV infection.

During this phase, the virus can be rapidly isolated from the blood and there are high levels of HIV p. 24 Ag in the serum. Thus, this phase of HIV infection is detected by demonstrating p24 Ag of the HIV virus. The HIV antibody-based test such as ELISA and western blot cannot be used for diagnosing this phase of infection because the immune response has not yet developed. Soon, however, a virus-specific immune response develops evidenced by seroconversion (development of antibody). The seroconversion usually occurs within 3-7 weeks of presumed exposure.

        "question": "Which drug is given as a single dose to prevent mother to child HIV transmission: March 2007",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Nevirapine Majority of mother to child transmission of HIV-1 occurs during the intrapaum period. Mechanism of veical transmission include infection after rupture of the membranes and direct contact of the fetus with infected secretions of blood from the maternal genital tract. Nevirapine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNI) used to treat HIV-1 infection and AIDS. It target the reverse transcriptase enzyme, an essential viral enzyme which transcribes viral RNA into DNA. Nevirapine is not effective against HIV-2, as the pocket of the HIV-2 reverse transcriptase has a different structure, which confers intrinsic resistance to the NNI class. Adverse effects The most common adverse effect of nevirapine is the development of mild or moderate rash (13%). Severe or life-threatening skin reactions have been observed in 1. 5% of patients, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and hypersensitivity. Drug interactions Significant lowering of nevirapine levels occurs with the anti-tuberculosis drug, rifampicin. Nevirapine is an inducer of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. It reduces the levels of several co-administered drugs including the antiretrovirals eirenz, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir, as well as clarithromycin, ketoconazole, forms of hormonal contraception, and methadone. Preventing mother-to-child transmission A single dose of nevirapine given to both mother and child reduced the rate of HIV transmission by almost 50% compared with a very sho course of zidovudine (AZT) prophylaxis. (This 50% is the comparative reduction of HIV transmission between the two drugs) Zidovudine administered during pregnancy and labor and to the newborn reduces the risk of veical transmission by 70%. Cesarean section is associated with additional risk reduction compared to vaginal delivery.",

        "question": "In anklyosing spondylitis joint involvement is least in?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Wrist and hand Ankylosing spondylitis (marie - strumpell disease) Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease of the sacroiliac joints and the axial skeleton. Prototype of seronegative (absence of rheumatoid factor) spondyloahropathies. Inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. Usually begins in the second or third decade with a median age of 23, in 5% symptoms begin after 40. Male to female ratio is 2-3: 1 Strong correlation with HLA-B27 90-95% of cases are positive for HLA - B27. Joints involved in ankylosing spondylitis Primarily affects axial skeleton. The disease usually begins in the sacro-iliac joints and usually extends upwards to involve the lumbar, thoracic, and often cervical spine In the worst cases the hips or shoulders are also affected. o Hip joint is the most commonly affected peripheral joint. o Rarely knee and ankle are also involved. Pathology Enthesitis i. e. inflammation of the inseion points of tendons, ligaments or joint capsule on bone is one of the hallmarks of this entity of disease. Primarily affects axial (spinal) skeleton and sacroiliitis is often the earliest manifestation of A. S.. Involvement of costoveebral joints frequently occur, leading to diminished chest expansion (normal 5 cm) Peripheral joints e. g. shoulders, and hips are also involved in 1/3rd patients. Extraaicular manifestations like acute anterior uveitis (in 5%); rarely aoic valve disease, carditis and pulmonary fibrosis also occur. Pathological changes proceed in three stages? Inflammation with granulation tissue formation and erosion of adjacent bone. Fibrosis of granulation tissue Ossification of the fibrous tissue, leading to ankylosis of the joint. Inflammatory bowel disease (CD, UC) may also be seen. Clinicalfeatures (symptoms) Low back pain of insidious onset Duration usually less than 3 months Significant morning stiffness and improvement with exercise Limited chest expansion Diffuse tenderness over the spine and sacroiliac joints Loss of lumbar lordosis, increased thoracic kyphosis Decreased spinal movements (especially extension) in all directions. Radiological features of an kvlasing spondylitis Radiographic evidence of sacroiliac joint is the most consistent finding in ankylosing spondylitis and is crucial for diagnosis. The findings are:- D Sclerosis of the aiculating surfaces of SI joints Widening of the sacroiliac joint space Bony ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints Calcification of the sacroiliac ligament and sacro-tuberous ligaments Evidence of enthesopathy - calcification at the attachment of the muscles, tendons and ligaments, paicularly around the pelvis and around the heel. X-ray of lumbar spine may show:- Li Squaring of veebrae: The normal anterior concavity of the veebral body is lost because of calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament. Loss of the lumbar lordosis. Bridging 'osteophytes' (syndesmophytes) Bamboo spine appearance In the early disease process, plain x-rays may be read as normal. More accurate and early diagnosis can be done by using MR1 and/or CT scan. Dynamic MRI with fat saturation, either sho tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequnece or TI weighted images with contrast enhancement is highly sensitive and specific for identifying early intra-aicular inflammation, cailage changes, and underlying bone marrow edema in sacroilitis. Magnetic resonance imaging allows for visualization of acute sacroilitis, spondylitis, and spondylodiscitis, and can also detect acute inflammation of the entheses, bone and synovium. The ability to detect early inflammatiion and acurately visualize cailaginous and enthesal lesions makes magnetic resonance imaging a useful assessment tool in the spondyloahropathies.",

        "exp": "Pituitary adenomas are most commonest cause of pituitary hormone hypersecretion and hyposecretion syndromes, common in adults. Hyperprolactinemia is the most common pituitary hormone hypersecretion syndrome in both men and women. PRL-secreting pituitary adenomas (prolactinomas) are the most common cause of PRL levels >200microgram/L. Pituitary adenomas are a result of excessive secretion of prolactin, inhibiting hypothalamic release of LHRH resulting in defective LH and FSH secretion. This defective LH and FSH secretion results in decreased levels of estrogen in females and testosterone in males. This is a reason how excessive prolactin can cause hypogonadism. In men with hyperprolactinemia, diminished libido, infeility, and visual loss (from optic nerve compression) are the usual presenting symptoms. Amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and infeility are the hallmarks of hyperprolactinemia in women. If hyperprolactinemia develops before menarche, primary amenorrhea results. Basal, fasting morning PRL levels (normally <20micrograms/L) should be measured to assess hypersecretion. the diagnosis of prolactinoma is likely with a PRL level >200 micrograms/L. PRL levels <100micrograms/L may be caused by microadenomas. MRI should be performed in all patients with hyperprolactinemia. Dopamine agonists are effective for most causes of hyperprolactinemia. An ergoline derivative, cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine agonist with high D2 receptor affinity. The drug effectively suppresses PRL for >14 days after a single oral dose and induces prolactinoma shrinkage in most patients. The ergot alkaloid bromocriptine mesylate is a dopamine receptor agonist that suppresses prolactin secretion. Indications for surgical adenoma debulking include dopamine resistance or intolerance and the presence of an invasive macroadenoma with compromised vision that fails to improve after drug treatment.

G1 is the major form, and its deficiency leads to a deficiency of total IgG, and so, by definition, it is not considered a \"subclass\" deficiency.)

The net result is greatly decreased extracellular fluid volume. Fuhermore, hyponatremia!, hyperkalemiae and mild acidosise develop because of failure of potassium and hydrogen ions to be secreted in exchange for sodium reabsorption Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) Glucocoicoid deficiency Fatigue, lack of energy o Weight loss, anorexia o Myalgia, joint pain Fever Anemia, lymphocytosis, eosinophilia Slightly increased TSH (due to loss of feedback inhibition of TSH release) Hypoglycemia (more frequent in children) Low blood pressure, postural hypotension o. Hyponatremia (due to loss of feedback inhibition of AVP release) Mineralocoicoid deficiency Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting Dizziness, postural hypotension Salt craving Low blood pressure, postural hypotension Increased serum creatinine (due to volume depletion) Hyponatremiayperkalemia deficiency Lack of energy Dry and itchy skin (in women) Loss of libido (in women) o Loss of axillary and pubic hair (in women) Symptoms Hyperpigmentation (primary Al only) o. Alabaster-colored pale skin (secondary Al only) (due to deficiency of POMC-derived peptides) REMEMBER The clinical features and laboratory features described above are characteristically seen only in primary addison's disease because in primary addison's disease both aldosterone and glucocoicoid are deficient, whereas In secondary addison's disease only glucocoicoid deficiency is seen. ALSO KNOW The basis for acute adrenal deficiency or addisonian crisis During conditions of physical or mental stress, large amount of glucocoicoids are secreted to cope up with the situation. But in persons with addison: s. disease, the output of glucocoicoids does not increase during stress. Thus the deficiency of glucocoicoids, when a person actually has acute need for the excessive amount of glucocoicoids produces addisonian crisis. The manifestations are produced due to extracellular fluid dehydration and low blood volume leading to circulatory shock.",

Cases of high clinical probability combined with a high probability V/Q scan are viually diagnostic of Pulmonary Embolism (Philip A Karla 3rd edition). Lung scanning is a second-line diagnostic test for PE, used mostly for patients who cannot tolerate intravenous contrast. Perfusion scan is done by injecting small paiculate aggregates of albumin labeled with a gamma-emitting radionuclide. Ventilation scans, are obtained using radiolabelled inhaled gas such as xenon or krypton. When the V/P scan shows 2 or more segmental perfusion defects in presence of normal ventilation it is said to e a high probability scan.

D: Cardiac tamponade A positive Kussmaul sign is rare in cardiac tamponade Davidson's (21st ed., p-542) includes Kussmaul's sign as a clinical feature of pericardial/ cardiac tamponade Normal physiology: Ordinarily the JVP falls with inspiration due to reduced pressure in the expanding thoracic cavity. Kussmaul's sign suggests impaired filling of the right ventricle due to either fluid in the pericardial space or a poorly compliant myocardium or pericardium. This impaired filling causes the increased blood flow to back up into the venous system, causing the jugular distension. Causes of Kussmaul's sign: The differential diagnosis generally associated with Kussmaul's sign is constrictive pericarditis, along with restrictive cardiomyopathy and cardiac tamponade. With cardiac tamponade, jugular veins are distended and typically show a prominent x descent and an absent y descent as opposed to patients with constrictive pericarditis Right ventricular infarction - low ventricular compliance Right heart failure Cardiac tumours Tricuspid stenosis",

The mutation is detected in the tyrosine kinase proto-oncogene RET and can be identified in 98% of affected family members with appropriate screening. Also know: 6% of patients with sporadic medullary thyroid cancer carry a germline RET mutation. Genetic testing should, thus, be offered to all patients with newly diagnosed apparent sporadic disease. MEN 2B patients tend to exhibit more locally aggressive MTC, and screening with RET testing is recommended at age 6 months or prior; for familial MTC and MEN 2A screening is recommended by 5 years of age.

Although coarctation of aoa does not commonly present with seizures, these may be seen as a consequence of severe hypertension (BP = 200/140) or complications like intracranial haemorrhage (from Berry aneurysms which are more common in patients with coarctation. Coarctation of Aoa is the most likely diagnosis: Approach (Nelson/Hurst) The classic sign of coarctation of aoa is a disparity in pulsations and blood pressure in arms and legs. The femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses are weak (or absent in upto 40% of patients) in contrast to bounding pulses in the arms and carotid vessels. The blood pressure is the legs is lower than in the arms and 90% of patients with coarctation have hypertension in an upper extremity greater than 95\" perecentile for age Age (yrs) 95th percentile (mm Hg) > 1 yrs 110 60 I -- 5 yrs 115 /75 6-10 yrs 125 /85 11 -- 18 yrs 140 /90 A blood pressure of 200 /140 mm Hg in a 10 year old boy suggests severe hypertension (95\" percentile at 10 years -- 125/85) Severe hypertension may be seen as a consequence of persistant hypertension in an individual who has not undergone corrective surgery for coarctation, and this usually appears in the second or third decade of life (Hurst) Children with severe/malignant hypertension may develop headaches, seizures and stroke (haemorrhage from Berry aneurysms which are more common in patients with coarctation). Takayasu Aooaeritis may also present with severe hypertension and absent femoral pulses due to acquired midaoic coarctation but this is an uncommon presentation in Takavasu aooaeritis (and hence not the single best answer of choice) Takayasu aeritis (or non specific aooaeritis) is a chronic vasculitis disease of medium and large sized aeries with a strong predilection for aoic arch and its branches. This may lead to stenosis of the involved vessels and hence a picture of acquired coarctation. It may thus produce a clinical picture similar to that of coarctation with disparity in pulsations and blood pressure in arms & legs with hypertension depending on the site of the acquired stenosis. However, this condition is more common in women and most commonly affects the subclavican aery. Hence it more commonly presents with claudication, along with unequal and reduced pulses / BP in the upper extremity than the lower extremity. Also systemic symptoms are more common is Takayasu than in coarctation. Neveheless Takayasu aeritis may affect the Thoracic or Abdominal aoa and present with absent lower limb pulses and upper extremity hypertension like coarctation of aoa. Takayasu aeritis can be picked as the answer if Coarctation of aoa is not provided amongst the options",
