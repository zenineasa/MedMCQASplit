This genomic viral RNA can be measured by -PCR. HIV1 RNA detection assays are highly sensitive and specific for diagnosis of HIV1 infection. PCR is extremely sensitive but cross contamination can occur. The standard blood screening test for HIV infection is the ELISA. The most commonly used confirmatory test is the Western blot. Western blot demonstrates antibodies to products of all three of the major genes of HIV (gag, pol, and env). The CD4+T cell count is the laboratory test generally accepted as the best indicator of the immediate state of immunologic competence of the patient with HIV infection. The hallmark of HIV disease progression is decline in the absolute number and percentage of CD4 T lymphocytes and an increasing percentage of CD8 T lymphocytes. In the early weeks after acute HIV infection acquired by high-risk behaviors, HIV antibody may be absent. Most patients will seroconve by 6 weeks.

        "question": "Which of the following statements about Dawn phenomenon is true:",
        "exp": "Answer is C (Morning hyperglycemia due to insufficient insulin): Dawn phenomenon typically refers to early morning hyperglycemia with stable blood glucose levels all night (no Hypoglycemia at night) Although typically Dawn phenomenon is caused by early morning physiological surge of counter regulatory hormones such as coisol, and growth hormone, inadequate night time insulin may also contribute to the 'Dawn phenomenon' (Early morning hyperglycemia). What causes the \"dawn phenomenon\"? The term dawn phenomenon describes a rise in, blood glucose that occurs during the early morning hours (between 5: 00 and 8: 00 Am), paicularly among patients who have normal glucose levels throughout most of the night. The rise in glucose is thought to be due to several factors, including the following: The normal increase in the morning coisol level The cumulative effect of increased nocturnal growth hormone Insulinopenia as a result of the length of time since the last injection Strategies for managing the dawn phenomenon Shift more aggressive insulin use to the evening and pre-bedtime hours, using a type of insulin that has a longer duration or peak of action, initiating insulin pump therapy Not eating a carbohydrate snack at bedtime Increasing the amount of vigorous physical activity in the evening hours. The specific strategy or combination of strategies must be tailored to the individual. What is Somogyi phenomenon? The Somogyi phenomenon is rebound hyperglycemia after an incident of hypoglycemia. This rebound is secondary to the release of counterregulatory hormones, which is the natural response to hypoglycemia. As tighter glucose control is maintained, there is an increased likelihood of hypoglycemia and, therefore, of the Somogyi phenomenon. If the hypoglycemia is recognized and treated promptly, rebound hyperglycemia is less like to occur. Thus, the Somogyi phenomenon is commonly repoed more frequently at night because there is the greater likelihood of unrecognized and untreated hypoglycemia when the patient is asleep. When should the Somogyi phenomenon be suspected? The Somogyi phenomenon should be suspected when a person whose blood sugar is in excellent control begins to have intermittent high blood glucoses in the morning. If that pattern is noted, blood glucose should be checked between 2: 00 and 3: 00 AM on several nights to determine whether hypoglycemia is occurring. If night time hypoglycemia can be documented the likely diagnosis is Somogyi phenomenon. This may require the dose or type of evening insulin or the time that the dose is given to be altered.",

Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) It is the combined presence of Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) and Korsakoff's syndrome. The cause of the disorder is thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, which can cause a range of disorders including beriberi, Wernicke's encephalopathy, and Korsakoff's psychosis. WKS is usually secondary to alcohol abuse. WE is characterized by the presence of a triad of symptoms; Ocular disturbances (ophthalmoplegia) Changes in mental state (confusion) Unsteady stance and gait (ataxia) KS is described as an acute onset of severe memory impairment without any dysfunction in intellectual abilities. The DSM IV lists the following criteria for the diagnosis of Korsakoff's Syndrome: anterograde amnesia Variable presentation of retrograde amnesia One of: Aphasia Apraxia Agnosia A deficit in executive functions. Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in alcoholics paicularly is associated with atrophy/infarction of specific regions of the brain, especially the mamillary bodies.

Prototype of seronegative (absence of rheumatoid factor) spondyloahropathies. Inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. Usually begins in the second or third decade with a median age of 23, in 5% symptoms begin after 40. o Male to female ratio is 2-3: 1 Strong correlation with HLA-B27 90-95% of cases are positive for HLA B27. Joints involved in ankvlosing spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis primarily affects axial skeleton. The disease usually begins in the sacro-iliac joints and usually extends upwards to involve the lumbar, thoracic, and often cervical spine. In the worst cases the hips or shoulders are also affected. Hip joint is the most commonly affected peripheral joint. o Rarely knee (Ebenzar 4thie 593) and ankle (Apley's 9th/e 67) are also involved. Clinical features Low back pain of insidious onset Duration usually less than 3 months Significant morning stiffness and improvement with exercise o Limited chest expansion Diffuse tenderness over the spine and sacroiliac joints Loss of lumbar lordosis, increased thoracic kyphosis Decreased spinal movements (especially extension) in all directions. Radiological features of ankvlosing spondvlitis Radiographic evidence of sacroiliac joint is the most consistent finding in ankylosing spondylitis and is crucial for diagnosis. The findings are:? Sclerosis of the aiculating surfaces of SI joints Widening of the sacroiliac joint space Bony ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints Calcification of the sacroiliac ligament and sacro-tuberous ligaments Evidence of enthesopathy - calcification at the attachment of the muscles, tendons and ligaments, paicularly around the pelvis and around the heel. o X-ray of lumbar spine may show:- Squaring of veebrae: The normal anterior concavity of the veebral body is lost because of calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament.

There may be associated vestibular, GI, or neurological symptoms. Attacks are often precipitated by stress, fatigue, or foods that contain tyramine (eg, cheese, yogu, nuts) or phenylethylamine (wine, chocolate). Symptoms peak within an hour of onset and persist for hours to days. A positive family history is found in as many as 50% of cases. Tension headaches are more often bilateral and described as \"band-like\" or \"vise-like\" and are not usually associated with visual auras. TIAs more typically present as a transient monocular blindness without aura or headache. Cranial aeritis may present as painless loss of vision without aura. Meningoencephalitis is associated with nuchal rigidity and diffuse headache but not with visual auras. Acute treatment of migraine headache consists of ergotamine tarate, antiemetics, and analgesics. Prophylactic medications such as propranolol, dipyridamole, and methysergide are ineffective for acute attacks. Avoidance of known precipitants and control of stress are also impoant in prevention.

The diagnosis is usually based on presentation with a persistent chronic cough and sputum production accompanied by consistent radiographic features. Although chest radiographs lack sensitivity, the presence of \"tram tracks\" indicating dilated airways is consistent with bronchiectasis. Chest CT is more specific for bronchiectasis and is the imaging modality of choice for confirming the diagnosis. CT findings include airway dilation (detected as parallel \"tram tracks\" or as the \"signet-ring sign\") - a cross-sectional area of the airway with a diameter at least 1. 5 times that of the adjacent vessel), lack of bronchial tapering (including the presence of tubular structures within 1 cm from the pleural surface), bronchial wall thickening in dilated airways, inspissated secretions (e. g., the \"tree-in-bud\" pattern), or cysts emanating from the bronchial wall (especially pronounced in cystic bronchiectasis).",

        "question": "Which one of the following is true regarding HIV infection -",
        "exp": "Pathogenesis of HIV infection and AIDS Primary infection of cells through the blood and mucosa. The initial entry of the virus may be through a mucosal surface, as in sexual intercourse (via rectal or cervical mucosa) or via blood exposure e. g. (after intravenous drug abuse). From the mucosa the virus is carried to the regional lymph nodes by dendritic cells while the virus initially inoculated into the blood is rapidly cleared by the spleen and lymph nodes. Thus, with either mode of entry, the virus initially replicates in the lymphoid organs and then spills over into the blood. Infection established in lymphoid tissue e. g, lymph node After the infection is established in the lymph node the virus spills into the blood the patient will now experience the acute HIV syndrome. Acute HIV syndrome, the spread of infection throughout the body This phase is characterized initially by high levels of virus in plasma and widespread seeding of the virus in lymphoid tissues. Sometimes there is an abrupt reduction in CD4+ T cells. During this period, the HIV virus can be readily isolated from the blood, and there are high levels of HIV p24 antigen in serum. Soon, however virus specific immune response develops Immune response The viremia is readily controlled by the development of an antiviral immune response. It is estimated that 40% to 90% of individuals who acquire a primary infection develop the viral syndrome 3-6 weeks after infection and this resolves spontaneously in 2 to 4 weeks. The resolution of viremia occurs due to the immune response. Virus-specific antibodies develop evidenced by seroconversion (usually within 3-7 weeks of presumed exposure) and more importantly virus-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cells also develop. HIV specific CD8+ T cells are detected in the blood, at this time, viral titres begin to fall and are most likely responsible for containment of HIV infection. As viral replication stops CD4+ T cells return to near normal numbers, signalling the end of the acute phase. Clinical Latency The clinical latency or the middle chronic phase represents a stage of relative containment of the virus. Although the plasma viremia declines, there is widespread dissemination and seeding of the virus, especially in the lymphoid organs. The viral load at the end of the acute phase reflects the equilibrium reached between the virus and the host after the inital battle and in a given patient may remain fairly stable for several years. This level of steady state viremia, or the viral \"set point\" is a predictor of the rate of decline of CD4+ T cells and therefore progression of HIV disease. In one study, only 8% of patient with a viral load of less than 4350 copies of viral m. RNA/ 1 progressed to full blown AIDS in 5 years, where as 62% of those with a viral load of greater than 36, 270 copies had developed AIDS in the same period. From a practical standpoint, therefore the extent of viremia, measured as IIIV-t. RNA is a useful surrogate marker of HIV disease progression and is of clinical value in the management of people with HIV infection. However, in patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), clinical improvement is often greater than the decrease in plasma viremia and it is generally accepted that virenzia as well as the blood CD4+ T cell counts should be considered in the management. Regardless of the viral burden, during the middle or chronic phase, there is continuing battle between HIV and the host immune system. The CD8+ cytotoxic T cell response remains activated and extensive viral and CD4+ cell turnover continues. However, because of immune regenerative capacity of the immune system a large proportion of the lost CD4+ cells is replenished. Thus the decline in CD4+ cell count in blood is modest. After an extended variable period, there begins a gradual erosion of CD4+ T cell and full blown AIDS ensues AIDS In this phase the host defence begins to wane. There is loss of CD4+ T cells. Concomitant with this loss, the proportion of the HIV virus in the blood increases. It is characterized by a breakdown of the host defence, a dramatic increase in plasma virus and clinical disease. Typically the patient presents with long lasting fever (> 1 months), fatigue, weight loss and diarrhoea. After a variable period, serious opportunistic infections, secondary neoplasms or clinical neurological disease (grouped under the rubric AIDS indicator disease, discussed below), supervene and the patient is said to have developed AIDS. It should be evident from our discussion that in each of the three phases of HIV infection, viral replication continues to occur. Even in the chronic phase, before the severe decline in CD4+ cell count and the development of AIDS, there is extensive turnover of the virus. In other words HIV infection lacks a phase of true microbiologic latency, thus it is a phase during which all the HIV is in the form of proviral DNA and no cell is productively infected.",

Obstructive disease Restrictive disease FEV 1 / FVC is characteristically < 80% of predicted FVC is characteristically < 80% of predicted Interstitial lung disease does not present with a normal FVC Interstitial lung disease should present with a restrictive pattern on 'pulmonary function tests' with a reduced FVC to values less than 80% of predicted. A forced vital capacity of 90% (FVC = 90%) is normal and hence makes a diagnosis of interstitial lung disease unlikely Primary Alveolar Hvpoventilation does not present with dyspnea and exercise intolerance Patients with primary pulmonary hypoventilation may have normal pulmonary function test with a normal FEV1 and normal FVC/FEV 1. However, dyspnea or shoness of breath is remarkably absent or extremely uncommon despite severe aerial blood gas derangements presumably because of impaired chemoreceptor and ventilatory drive. Also exacerbation of hypoxemia or drop in oxygen saturation is characteristically seen during sleep and not on exercise. `Despite severe aerial blood gas derangements is uncommon' - Harrison `Dyspnea is remarkably absent' - Spiral Manual of pulmonary Medicine (Lippincott) 6th/444 Anxiety disorder: Hyperventilation does not present with exercise intolerance Patients with Anxiety associated Hyperventilation may also present with normal spirometry results with a normal FVC and FEV 1 /FVC. Dyspnea may also be a presenting feature; however such patients do not show features of exercise intolerance. 'Patients with psychogenic hyperventilation typically complain of dyspnea at rest, but not during mild exercise. During mild or moderate exercise their hyperventilation tends to disappear' - Harrison",

Treatment here involves resection or cryosurgical ablation of secondries, alongwith the management of the primary.

Charcot's triad of intermittent fever, pain and jaundice is characteristic of ascending cholangitis and indicates biliary obstruction. Hepatomegaly is present in most cases of obstructive jaundice and is due to congestion and stretching out of intrahepatic biliary spaces. A palpable gall bladder usually indicates obstruction of the distal CBD, due to other causes like underlying malignancy, than stone (Courvoisier's law). Hepatic bile flow suppression leads to jaundice accompanied by dark urine (bilirubinuria) and light coloured (alcoholic) stools. Bile salts and pigments in urine and absent urobilinogen also our the diagnosis of obstructive jaundice. Serum albumin and prothrombin time are good indicators of liver function derangement.

HBe Ag is typically negative and levels of HBV DNA are less than 103-104 virions/ml Such patients have minimal (if any) liver inflammation or damage, and usually live a normal life. However compared to the general population these patients remain at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma Treatment is currently not recommended for Inactive HBV carrier. However regular observation is advised as there is a risk for reactivation of virus. Chronic Hepatitis B (Active) Patients with active virus replication ( HBV DNA levels > 103 -104 virions/ml) and /or clinical signs and symptoms of liver damage or elevated liver enzyme levels are characterized as chronic hepatitis B patients. Depending on the presence or absence of HBe Ag two type of chronic (active) hepatitis B may be identified. HBe Ag positive chronic hepatitis B These HBs Ag positive, individuals are also positive for HBe Ag and show detectable HBV DNA levels. Such patients are in the replicative phase of chronic hepatitis B infection, have persistently or intermittently elevated liver enzymes and liver biopsy results typically reveals inflammation and damage Patients with chronic (active) hepatitis B may become inactive (relatively non replicative) over time (rate of L-10 % per year) by becoming negative for HBe Ag and HBV DNA (HBV DNA < 10' - 104) virions/ml) Liver injury tend to subside in such patients and these may then be characterized as 'inactive carriers' HBe Ag negative chronic hepatitis B (Precore mutant) Such HBs Ag positive individuals are negative for HBe Ag but show detectable HBV DNA levels. Such patients are also in the replicative phase of chronic hepatitis B (despite negative HBe Ag) and have persistently or intermittently elevated liver enzymes and liver biopsy results typically reveal severe inflammation and damage Negative HBe Ag Status results from a mutant strain of hepatitis B that is characterized by the. failure of the virus to make the hepatitis B 'e' antigen (HBe Ag). This mutation is called the `precore' mutation as it prevents the translation of a precore protein to prevent HBe antigen production.

Balance can thus be restored by suppression of the unopposed excitatory cholinergic system (Administration of central anticholinergics).",

Triclosan is an antibacterial and antifungal agent found in numerous consumer products, including soaps, detergents, toys, and surgical cleaning treatments. Its efficacy as an antimicrobial agent and the risk of antibacterial resistance remains controversial. Breath tests using 13 C-marked triglycerides are based on the principle that intestinal triglyceride absorption requires prior hydrolysis by lipase to produce free fatty acids and monoacylglycerol. These metabolites are incorporated into micelles, absorbed, resynthesized and transpoed to the liver. Lipolytic hepatic enzymes subsequently release 13 C-marked fatty acids. These undergo Beta-oxidation which results in formation of 13 CO2 that is absorbed into the bloodstream, transpoed to the lung and exhaled. The increase in 13 CO2 concentration in breath thus correlates with intestinal lipid digestion and absorption. 13C-marked triglycerides are nonradioactive and can be applied safely and repeatedly, also to children and pregnant women. Initially focused on investigating infants and pregnant women with their paicularly high risks of being exposed to energy rich radiation, breath tests using the stable isotope 13C instead of its radioactive counterpa 14C, nowadays have replaced 14C-breath tests almost completely. TRIPALMITIN BREATH The tripalmitin breath test is used for studying fat malabsorption and TEST aetiology of steatorrhea, paicularly with respect to long chain fatty acids.

Another sign of inflammation is the rise in blood level of number of proteins called as acute phase proteins. One of the proteins is C-reactive protein (CRP). Like ESR and other acute phase proteins, CRP also goes up in inflammation. In systemic lupus however the level does not rise unless there is infection associated. The normal response to active inflammatory disease is an increase in plasma CRP concentration. o For reasons that remain unclear tht response is either significantly lower in magnitude or entirely absent in a few inflammatory conditions. This has proven diagnostically useful because there are very few inflammatory conditions in which ESR is significantly raised (reflecting an inflammatory process) but plasma CRP is only slightly raised or even normal. One ofthese conditions is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), a relatively common chronic autoimmune disease that predominantly affects women of child-bearing age. When this inflammation occurs in the lupus patient it is accompanied as expected by a marked increase in ESR. However in contrst to most other inflammatory condition, the plasma CRP remains resolutely normal. The combination of raised ESR and normal CRP is a useful diagnostic feature of SLE.
