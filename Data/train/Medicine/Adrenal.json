Pheochromocytomas that develop in extra-adrenal paraganglia are designated paragangliomas. 10% of sporadic adrenal pheochromocytomas are bilateral; this figure may rise to as high as 50% in cases that are associated with familial syndromes10% of adrenal pheochromocytomas are biologically malignant, defined by the presence of metastatic disease. 10% of adrenal pheochromocytomas are not associated with hypertension.

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are catecholamine-producing tumors derived from the sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system. These tumors may arise sporadically or be inherited as features of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. The \"rule of tens\" for pheochromocytomas states that about 10% are bilateral, 10% are extraadrenal, and 10% are malignant. However, these percentages are higher in the inherited syndromes. The clinical presentation is so variable that Pheochromocytoma has been termed \"the great masquerader\". The dominant sign is hypertension. Classically, patients have episodic hypertension, but sustained hypertension is also frequent. CLINICAL FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH PHEOCHROMOCYTOMAHeadaches. Weight loss. Sweating attacks. Paradoxical response to antihypertensive drugs. Palpitation and tachycardia. Polyuria and polydipsia. Hypertension, sustained or paroxysmal. Constipation. Anxiety and panic attacks.

        "question": "Increased VMA found in?",
        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Pheochromocytoma. REF: Harrison's 18th ed ch: 343. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas synthesize and store catecholamines, which include norepinephrine (noradrenaline), epinephrine (adrenaline), and dopamine. Elevated plasma and urinary levels of catecholamines and the methylated metabolites, metanephrines, are the cornerstone for the diagnosis. Catecholamines and metanephrines can be measured by using different methods (e. g., high-performance liquid chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry). In a clinical context suspicious for pheochromocytoma, when values are increased three times the upper limit of normal, a pheochromocytoma is highly likely regardless of the assay used. Urinary tests for vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), metanephrines (total or fractionated), and catecholamines are widely available and are used commonly for initial testing. Among these tests, the fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines are the most sensitive. Plasma tests are more convenient and include measurements of catecholamines and metanephrines. Measurements of plasma metanephrine are the most sensitive and are less susceptible to false-positive elevations from stress, including venipuncture",

Draw blood for immediate serum electrolytes and glucose and routine measurement ofplasma cortisol and A CTH. Do not wait for lab results. Infuse 2 to 3 liters of isotonic saline or 5 precent dextrose in isotonic saline as quickly as possible. Frequent hemodynamic monitoring and measurement of serum electrolytes should be performed to avoid iatrogenic fluid overload. Give 4 mg dexamethasone as intravenous bolus over one to five minutes and every 12 hours thereafter Dexamethasone is the drug of choice because it does not interfere with the measurement ofplasma cortisol. If dexamethasone is unavailable, intravenous hydrocortisone, 100 mg immediately and every six hours thereafter, may be used. Use supportive measures as needed. Subacute measures after stabilization of the patient. Continue intravenous isotonic saline at a slower rate for next 24 to 48 hours. Search for and treat possible in fections precipitating causes of the adrenal crisis. Perform short ACTH stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, ifpatient does not have know adrenal insufficiency. Determine the type of adrenal insu fficiency and its cause if not already known. Taper parenteral glucocorticoid over one to three days, if precipitating or complicating illness permits, to oral glucocorticoid maintenance dose. Begin meneralocorticoid replacement with fludrocortisone, 0. 1 mg by mouth daily, when saline infusion is stopped.",
