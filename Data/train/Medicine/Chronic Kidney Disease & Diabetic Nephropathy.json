Presence of eosinophilia and mottling of toes and reduced kidney function confirm the diagnosis as Atheroembolic kidney disease. Hence Choice D is the answer. Lab findings include Rising serum creatinine Transient eosinophilia Elevated sedimentation rate Hypocomplementemia Definitive diagnosis by doing kidney biopsy:- Microvessel obstruction with cholesterol crystals that leave a cleft in the vessel. Contrast-induced nephropathy can occur in diabetics with chronic kidney disease.
