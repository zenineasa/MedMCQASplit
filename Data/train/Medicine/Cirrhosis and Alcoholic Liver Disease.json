More severe hypovolemia requires intravenous therapy.

Cirrhosis associated with virus is called postnecrotic cirrhosis. Postnecrotic cirrhosis is also called posthepatitis cirrhosis macronodular cirrhosis and coarsely nodular cirrhosis.Cirrhosis in hemochromatosis is typically micronodular (can be macronodular sometimes).Wilson's disease causes macronodular cirrhosis.Biliary cirrhosis whether primary or secondary is micronodular.",
