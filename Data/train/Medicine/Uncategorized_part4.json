Hemolysis regularly produces in the serum an increase in unconjugated bilirubin and aspaate transaminase (AST), urobilinogen will be increased in both urine and stool. So the most likely diagnosis in this patient is hemolytic jaundice. In Hemolytic Anemia the main clinical sign is jaundice. The spleen is enlarged because it is a preferential site of hemolysis. The laboratory features of HA are related to hemolysis and the erythropoietic response of the bone marrow. Hemolysis produces an increase in unconjugated bilirubin and aspaate transaminase (AST); urobilinogen will be increased in both urine and stool. The main sign of the erythropoietic response by the bone marrow is an increase in reticulocytes. The increased number of reticulocytes is associated with an increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in the blood count. On the blood smear, this is reflected in the presence of macrocytes. A bone marrow aspirate will show erythroid hyperplasia. Cholelithiasis is a complication of hemolytic anemia. Obstructive jaundice is unlikely in this case as the patient has anemia and a positive urine urobilinogen test. Reference: Harrison's Internal Medicine, 18th Edition, Page 326, 872-875, 3179-3180",

Sjogren's syndrome classically presents with keratoconjunctivitis (dry eyes) and xerostomia (dry mouth, often resulting in dental caries and fissures in the oral mucosa). These symptoms are due to autoimmune involvement with subsequent scarring of the salivary and lacrimal glands. Parotid gland enlargement is common, as is vasculitis, Raynaud's phenomenon, hyperviscosity syndrome, and peripheral neuropathy. The development of oral squamous cell carcinoma is not related to the presence of dental caries. Polyaeritis nodosa is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis. Patients typically present with low-grade fever, weakness, and weight loss. Abdominal pain, hematuria, renal failure, hypertension, and leukocytosis may occur. Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease characterized by vasculitis, rash, renal disease, hemolytic anemia, and neurologic disturbances. Ref: O'Dell J. R., Imboden J. B., Miller L. D.

It usually results from damage to upper motor neurons of the facial nerve. The facial motor nucleus has dorsal and ventral divisions that contain lower motor neurons supplying the muscles of the upper and lower face, respectively. The dorsal division receives bilateral upper motor neuron input (ie, from both sides of the brain). The ventral division receives only contralateral input (ie, from the opposite side of the brain). Thus, lesions of the coicobulbar tract between the cerebral coex and the facial motor nucleus destroy or reduce input to the ventral division, but ipsilateral input (ie, from the same side) to the dorsal division is retained. As a result, central facial palsy (damage to upper motor neurons of the facial nerve) is characterized by hemiparalysis or hemiparesis of the contralateral muscles of facial expression, but not the muscles of the forehead.",

Rupture typically occurs into a right heart chamber, and the murmur is indicative of a continuous pressure difference between the aoa and either the right ventricle or right atrium. A continuous murmur may also be audible along the left sternal border with a coronary aeriovenous fistula and at the site of an aeriovenous fistula used for hemodialysis access.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Marfan's syndrome. The most common cause of renal aery stenosis is an atheromatous plaque. Marfan Syndrome: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a spectrum of disorders caused by a heritable genetic defect of connective tissue that has an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. The defect itself has been isolated to the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, which codes for the connective tissue protein fibrillin. Abnormalities in this protein cause a myriad of distinct clinical problems, of which the musculoskeletal, cardiac, and ocular system problems predominate. The skeleton of patients with MFS typically displays multiple deformities including arachnodactyly (ie, abnormally long and thin digits), dolichostenomelia (ie, long limbs relative to trunk length), pectus deformities (ie, pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum), and thoracolumbar scoliosis. Finally, blindness may result from unrecognized and untreated glaucoma, retinal detachment, and cataracts. In the cardiovascular system, aoic dilatation, aoic regurgitation, and aneurysms are the most worrisome clinical findings. Mitral valve prolapse that requires valve replacement can occur as well. Ocular findings include myopia, cataracts, retinal detachment, and superior dislocation of the lens. Takayasu aeritis is also known as pulseless disease because of frequent occlusion of aeries arising from the aoa. It may also occlude renal aeries. Polyaeritis nodosa is a multisystem necizing vasculitis of small and medium sized muscular aeries in which involvement of the renal and visceral aeries is characteristic. There is fibrinoid necrosis with compromise of the lumen.",

The seizure discharge usually arises from the temporal lobe or medial frontal lobe but can originate elsewhere. These seizures sta focally and subsequently generalize with a loss of consciousness. The motor manifestations of complex paial seizures are characterized by coordinated involuntary motor activity, termed automatism, which takes the form of orobuccolingual movements in approximately 75% of patients and other facial or neck or hand movements in approximately 50%.

This genomic viral RNA can be measured by -PCR. HIV1 RNA detection assays are highly sensitive and specific for diagnosis of HIV1 infection. PCR is extremely sensitive but cross contamination can occur. The standard blood screening test for HIV infection is the ELISA. The most commonly used confirmatory test is the Western blot. Western blot demonstrates antibodies to products of all three of the major genes of HIV (gag, pol, and env). The CD4+T cell count is the laboratory test generally accepted as the best indicator of the immediate state of immunologic competence of the patient with HIV infection. The hallmark of HIV disease progression is decline in the absolute number and percentage of CD4 T lymphocytes and an increasing percentage of CD8 T lymphocytes. In the early weeks after acute HIV infection acquired by high-risk behaviors, HIV antibody may be absent. Most patients will seroconve by 6 weeks.

Usually begins in the second or third decade with a median age of 23, in 5% symptoms begin after 40. o Male to female ratio is 2-3: 1 Strong correlation with HLA-B27 90-95% of cases are positive for HLA B27. Joints involved in ankvlosing spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis primarily affects axial skeleton. The disease usually begins in the sacro-iliac joints and usually extends upwards to involve the lumbar, thoracic, and often cervical spine. In the worst cases the hips or shoulders are also affected. Hip joint is the most commonly affected peripheral joint. o Rarely knee (Ebenzar 4thie 593) and ankle (Apley's 9th/e 67) are also involved. Clinical features Low back pain of insidious onset Duration usually less than 3 months Significant morning stiffness and improvement with exercise o Limited chest expansion Diffuse tenderness over the spine and sacroiliac joints Loss of lumbar lordosis, increased thoracic kyphosis Decreased spinal movements (especially extension) in all directions. Radiological features of ankvlosing spondvlitis Radiographic evidence of sacroiliac joint is the most consistent finding in ankylosing spondylitis and is crucial for diagnosis. The findings are:? Sclerosis of the aiculating surfaces of SI joints Widening of the sacroiliac joint space Bony ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints Calcification of the sacroiliac ligament and sacro-tuberous ligaments Evidence of enthesopathy - calcification at the attachment of the muscles, tendons and ligaments, paicularly around the pelvis and around the heel. o X-ray of lumbar spine may show:- Squaring of veebrae: The normal anterior concavity of the veebral body is lost because of calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament.

There may be associated vestibular, GI, or neurological symptoms. Attacks are often precipitated by stress, fatigue, or foods that contain tyramine (eg, cheese, yogu, nuts) or phenylethylamine (wine, chocolate). Symptoms peak within an hour of onset and persist for hours to days. A positive family history is found in as many as 50% of cases. Tension headaches are more often bilateral and described as \"band-like\" or \"vise-like\" and are not usually associated with visual auras. TIAs more typically present as a transient monocular blindness without aura or headache. Cranial aeritis may present as painless loss of vision without aura. Meningoencephalitis is associated with nuchal rigidity and diffuse headache but not with visual auras. Acute treatment of migraine headache consists of ergotamine tarate, antiemetics, and analgesics. Prophylactic medications such as propranolol, dipyridamole, and methysergide are ineffective for acute attacks. Avoidance of known precipitants and control of stress are also impoant in prevention.

Physical findings often include crackles and wheezing on lung auscultation, and some patients with bronchiectasis exhibit clubbing of the digits. Mild to moderate airflow obstruction is often detected on pulmonary function tests, overlapping with that seen at presentation with other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The diagnosis is usually based on presentation with a persistent chronic cough and sputum production accompanied by consistent radiographic features. Although chest radiographs lack sensitivity, the presence of \"tram tracks\" indicating dilated airways is consistent with bronchiectasis. Chest CT is more specific for bronchiectasis and is the imaging modality of choice for confirming the diagnosis. CT findings include airway dilation (detected as parallel \"tram tracks\" or as the \"signet-ring sign\") - a cross-sectional area of the airway with a diameter at least 1. 5 times that of the adjacent vessel), lack of bronchial tapering (including the presence of tubular structures within 1 cm from the pleural surface), bronchial wall thickening in dilated airways, inspissated secretions (e. g., the \"tree-in-bud\" pattern), or cysts emanating from the bronchial wall (especially pronounced in cystic bronchiectasis).",

Serum complement components are normal, and IgA levels are elevated in about one-half of patients. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura is characterized by a pentad of findings that include microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, neurologic findings, and fever. Findings to suppo the TTP diagnosis include an increased lactate dehydrogenase and indirect bilirubin, decreased haptoglobin, and increased reticulocyte count, with a negative direct antiglobulin test. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation the common laboratory findings include the prolongation of PT and/or a. PTT; platelet counts 100, 000/L3, or a rapid decline in platelet numbers, the presence of schistocytes (fragmented red cells) in the blood smear and elevated levels of FDP (fibrin degradation products). The most sensitive test for DIC is the FDP level. In Cavernous angioma bleeding is usually of small volume, causing slight mass effect only. The bleeding risk for single cavernous malformations is 0. 7-1. 5% per year and may be higher for patients with prior clinical hemorrhage or multiple malformations.

Thus the whole picture respresents metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis. Explanation: Acid base disorders needlessly, confuse many people, but if a few simple rules are applied then interpretation and diagnosis are easy. pH < 7. 35 is acidosis; pH > 7. 45 is alkalosis If change in HCO3 is termed as metabolic If change in HCO3- is in keeping with the pH (i. e. if there is acidosis and HCO3- decreased) the problem is a Metabolic one. If change in HCO3 is opposite with the pH (if there is acidosis and HCO3 is increased or normal) the problem is compensatory metabolic. If change is CO2 is termed as respiratory If change in CO2 is in keeping with the pH (if in acidosis CO2 is raised) the problem is termed respiratory If change in CO2 is opposite with the pH (if there is acidosis and CO2 is decreased or normal) problem is termed as compensatory respiratory.

'Ingestion of Aspirin and other Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory drugs, significantly prolongs the bleeding time'. `Aspirin even in small doses irreversibly inhibits T x. A2 synthesis by platelets. Thus it interferes with platelet aggregation and bleeding time is prolonged to nearly twice the normal value'- Note: Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX -1 and COX - 2.

Triclosan is an antibacterial and antifungal agent found in numerous consumer products, including soaps, detergents, toys, and surgical cleaning treatments. Its efficacy as an antimicrobial agent and the risk of antibacterial resistance remains controversial. Breath tests using 13 C-marked triglycerides are based on the principle that intestinal triglyceride absorption requires prior hydrolysis by lipase to produce free fatty acids and monoacylglycerol. These metabolites are incorporated into micelles, absorbed, resynthesized and transpoed to the liver. Lipolytic hepatic enzymes subsequently release 13 C-marked fatty acids. These undergo Beta-oxidation which results in formation of 13 CO2 that is absorbed into the bloodstream, transpoed to the lung and exhaled. The increase in 13 CO2 concentration in breath thus correlates with intestinal lipid digestion and absorption. 13C-marked triglycerides are nonradioactive and can be applied safely and repeatedly, also to children and pregnant women. Initially focused on investigating infants and pregnant women with their paicularly high risks of being exposed to energy rich radiation, breath tests using the stable isotope 13C instead of its radioactive counterpa 14C, nowadays have replaced 14C-breath tests almost completely.

Another sign of inflammation is the rise in blood level of number of proteins called as acute phase proteins. One of the proteins is C-reactive protein (CRP). Like ESR and other acute phase proteins, CRP also goes up in inflammation. In systemic lupus however the level does not rise unless there is infection associated. The normal response to active inflammatory disease is an increase in plasma CRP concentration. o For reasons that remain unclear tht response is either significantly lower in magnitude or entirely absent in a few inflammatory conditions. This has proven diagnostically useful because there are very few inflammatory conditions in which ESR is significantly raised (reflecting an inflammatory process) but plasma CRP is only slightly raised or even normal. One ofthese conditions is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), a relatively common chronic autoimmune disease that predominantly affects women of child-bearing age. When this inflammation occurs in the lupus patient it is accompanied as expected by a marked increase in ESR. However in contrst to most other inflammatory condition, the plasma CRP remains resolutely normal. The combination of raised ESR and normal CRP is a useful diagnostic feature of SLE.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare diffuse degenerative disease that usually affects people in their 50s, and the usual course is about one year. The terminal stage is characterized by severe dementia, generalized hypeonicity, and profound speech disturbances. It is one of several diseases presumably caused by prions. Huntington disease is a hereditary disease associated with progressive degeneration of the basal ganglia and the cerebral coex. It is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern. The onset of Huntington disease occurs between 35 and 50 years of age, or later in rare cases. This disease is characterized by progressive dementia, muscular hypeonicity, and bizarre choreiform movements. Parkinson disease is characterized primarily by motor dysfunction, but dementia may be a pa of the disorder. The characteristic motor symptoms (bradykinesia, flat facies, resting tremor, shuffling gait, etc) are caused by degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic tract. Ref: Ropper A. H., Samuels M. A.

Other causes of lung cancer include the following: Passive smoking, or secondhand smoke, presents another risk for lung cancer. Air pollution from motor vehicles, factories, and other sources probably increase the risk for lung cancer. Asbestos exposure increases the risk of lung cancer nine times. A combination of asbestos exposure and cigarette smoking raises the risk to as much as 50 times. Another cancer known as mesothelioma (a type of cancer of the lining of the chest cavity called the pleura or of the lining of the abdominal cavity called the peritoneum) is also strongly associated with exposure to asbestos. Lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), also create a risk for lung cancer. A person with COPD has a four to six times greater risk of lung cancer even when the effect of cigarette smoking is excluded. Radon exposure poses another risk. Radon is a by-product of naturally occurring radium, which is a product of uranium. Silicosis is associated with pulmonary fibrosis. X-ray of chest shows rounded opacities in the upper lobes after 15-20 years (simple silicosis). Calcification of hilar nodes may produce 'eggshell' pattern.

More severe, dialysis-requiring AKI is uncommon except in the setting of significant preexisting chronic kidney disease, often in association with congestive heart failure or other coexisting causes for ischemiaassociated AKI. Patients with multiple myeloma and renal disease are particularly susceptible Q. Low fractional excretion of sodium and relatively benign urinary sediment without features of tubular necrosis are common findings. Contrast nephropathy is thought to occur from a combination of factors 1. Hypoxia in the renal outer medulla due to perturbations in renal microcirculation and occlusion of small vessels Q 2. Cytotoxic damage to the tubules directly or via the generation of oxygen free radicalsQ, especially since the concentration of the agent within the tubule is markedly increased 3. Transient tubule obstruction with precipitated contrast material Q",

Radiographic studies show a tumor in the pancreas. Which of the following cells is responsible for this lesion?",
        "exp": "The symptoms described are typical for a patient with glucagon excess. Glucagon is secreted by alpha cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Increased levels are rare, usually due to carcinoma (70%) or adenoma (30%) of the islets. Two-thirds of patients with carcinoma have liver metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Increased glucagon causes a syndrome similar to diabetes mellitus, due to antagonism of insulin effects. Patients also have migratory skin rashes, alopecia, hyperpigmentation of the skin, and glossitis. Diagnosis is made by measuring glucagon. The acinar cell, the main exocrine cell of the pancreas, contains digestive enzymes. Increases in the release of these enzymes (especially amylase and lipase) occur with pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is considered an emergent medical condition. Chronic pancreatitis is associated with fibrosis and atrophy of the acinar structures. Beta cells are responsible for insulin release. An adenoma of beta cells (insulinoma) would cause hyperinsulinism. 70% are solitary and 10% are multiple. Insulinomas cause hypoglycemia, dizziness, confusion, and excessive sweating. Glucose needs to be given promptly to avoid coma and death. Diagnosis is made by finding increased insulin and hypoglycemia. Delta cells are islet cells that secrete somatostatin. Tumors producing increased somatostatin are usually malignant. Clinically, a diabetes mellitus-like syndrome occurs along with diarrhea. Diagnosis is made from elevated serum somatostatin levels, but can be difficult because of the hormone's sho half-life. Ref: German M. S. (2011). Chapter 17.

PD deficiency: Acute hemolytic anemia Favism Congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia Congenital nonspherocvtic hemolytic anemia Patients with class I G6. PD variants have such severe G6. PD deficiency that lifelong hemolysis occurs in the absence of infection or drug exposure. Such patients fall under the category of having congenital nonspherocvtic hemolytic anemia. These G6. PD variants have low in vitro activity and/or marked instability of the molecule, and most have DNA mutations at the glucose-6-phosphate or NADP binding sites. These sites are central to the function of G6. PD, which oxidizes glucose-6-phosphate and reduces NADP to NADPH. It is presumed that the functional defect is so severe that the red cells cannot withstand even the normal oxidative stresses encountered in the circulation. Anemia and jaundice are often first noted in the newborn period, and the degree of hyperbilirubinemia is frequently of sufficient severity to require exchange transfusion. After infancy, hemolytic manifestations are subtle and inconstant. Most individuals have mild to moderate anemia (hemoglobin 8 to 10 g/dL) with a reticulocyte count of 10 to 15 percent. Pallor is uncommon, scleral icterus is intermittent, splenomegaly is rare, and splenectomy generally is of little benefit. Hemolysis can be exaggerated by exposure to drugs or chemicals with oxidant potential or exposure to a beans. Some drugs with relatively mild oxidant potential that are safe in patients with class II or class III G6. PD variants may increase hemolysis in patients with class I variants.

Slight amino acid differences between cardiac and skeletal muscle forms of troponin allow specific association of the troponin with heart muscle damage, rather than skeletal muscle damage. Troponin is the best serum marker for myocardial infarction for the first eight hours, and because levels of the cardiac troponins remain elevated for 7-10 days, it may be useful for evaluation of small, CK-negative infarctions for several days after the event. AST is a nonspecific marker for cardiac, liver, and skeletal muscle. Due to its lack of specificity, it is much less useful as a marker of myocardial infarction than CK-MB or troponin. Both total creatine kinase and its more cardiac specific form CK-MB are most useful from 8 to 24 hours after infarction, typically with peaks at 12-18 hours. LDH1, the cardiac specific form of lactic dehydrogenase, is the test of choice 2 to 7 days after a suspected myocardial infarction. Ref: Green G. B., Hill P. M. (2011). Chapter 52.
