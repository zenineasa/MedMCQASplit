        "exp": "Ans. (a) Cardiac Tamponade. Ref.: Harrison 18th edition, chapter 238. Becks triad is a collection of three medical signs associated with acute cardiac tamponade, an emergency condition wherein fluid accumulates around the heart and impairs its ability to pump blood. The signs are:* Low arterial blood pressure* Distended neck veins* Distant, muffled heart sounds. Constrictive pericarditis can present with hypotension and congested neck veins but muffled heart sounds are not present.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Pericardial Effusion o Auenbruger 's sign is an epicardial bulging due to massive pericardial effusion. Auenbrugeer frsieno It represents bulging of the epigastrium that may be seen in case of severe pericardial effusion. o The auenbrugger s sign is seen in large pericardial effusion. o During a large pericardial effusion an epigastric bulge is present, o This represents large pericardial effusion extending subxiphoid. o Compression of this bulge may cause hemodynamic compromise and cardiac tamponade. Signs in pericardial effusion: -Sign Presentation. Friedreich's sign-Sudden collapse inthe distended neck veins with diastole suggests pericardial tamponade. Pitres's sign-Anterior bidging of the lower sternum suggests pericardial effusion. Auenbrugger's sign-Protuberance/Bulging of the epigastrium suggests massive pericardial effusion (Sign on inspection). Sansom s sign-Percussible dullness in the left third intercostal space suggests large pericardial effusion. Greene's sign -Lateral displacement of the percussed cardiac border with expiration suggests a large pericardial effusions. Ebstein's sign A large pericardial effusion can blunt the percussible righ cardiomyopathic angle producing dullness along the lower right sternal border. Rotch's sign-Dullness at the right lower sternal border suggests large pericardial effusion. Moschcowitz s sign-In pericardial effusion, the transition on percussion from the lungs in the right heart border is abrupt. Ewart's sign-A large pericardial effusion produces egophony and bronchial breathing at the lower border of the left scapula. Ewart's second sign-A large pericardial effusion makes the first rib seen more prominent along the sternal border. Dressier 's sign-Is dullness to percussion of the lower one half of the sternum. The Dressier sound is aflat sound on percussion the lower half or two third of the sternum. In the absence of mitral stenosis, this finding 'should at once arouse suspicion of pericardial effusion '. Bamberger's sign-Dullness at the angle of the scapula that disappears when the patient leans forward is Bamberger s sign of pericardial effusion. Dullness at the left lower lung field is Ewart s sign ofpericardial effusion, while right-sided dullness is Conner s sign. Disappearance of Ewart s or Conner s signs when the patient sits up and leans forward is Bambeiger s sign of pericardial effusion.",
