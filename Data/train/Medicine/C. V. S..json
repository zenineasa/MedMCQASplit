        "exp": "Ans. D. 2: 1 block. Electrocardiography and Electrophysiology of AV conduction block. AV conduction block typically is diagnosed electrocardiographically, which characterizes the severity of the conduction disturbances and allows one to draw inferences about the location of the block. AV conduction block manifests as slow conduction in its mildest forms and failure to conduct, either intermittent of persistently, in more severe varieties. a. First degree AV block (PR interval >200ms) is a slowing of conduction through the AV junction. The site of delay is typically in the AV node but may be in the atria, bundle of his, or his Purkinje system. A wide QRS is suggestive of delay in the AV node proper or less commonly in the bundle of His. In second degree AV block there is an intermittent failure of electrical impulse conduction from atrium to ventricle. b. Second degree AV block is sub classified as Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) or Mobitz type II. The periodic failure of conduction in Mobitz, type I block is characterized by a progressively lengthening PR interval, shortening of the RR interval, and a pause that is less than the two times the immediately preceding RR interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG complex after the pause exhibits a shorter PR interval than that immediately preceding the pause. This ECG pattern most often arises because of decremental conduction of electrical impulses in the AV node.",

Patients with hypocalcemia may be asymptomatic if the decreases in serum calcium are relatively mild and chronic. Moderate to severe hypocalcemia is associated with paresthesias, usually of the fingers, toes, and circumoral regions due to increased neuromuscular irritability. Chvostek's sign (twitching of the circumoral muscles in response to gentle tapping of the facial nerve just anterior to the ear) may be elicited. Carpal spasm may be induced by inflation of a blood pressure cuff to 20 mm. Hg above the patient's systolic blood pressure for 3 min (Trousseau's sign). Severe hypocalcemia can induce seizures, carpopedal spasm, bronchospasm. laryngo- spasm, and. ECG: Prolongation of the QT interval. Clinical Manifestations of Hypercalcemia.

Fully evolved phase. Old infarction (resolution phase). Elevation of ST segment. Pathological Q ware. Pathogical Q wave. Tall wide (peaked) T wave. Elevated ST segment being to resolveT wave inverts. ST segment and T wave may be normal. ST segment elevation, unlike depression, will localize to the ECG lead of the affected myocardium. Note that 1mm of ST elevation in 2 contiguous leads is required to diagnose STEMI, however there are two major exceptions. a. Anterior STEMI requires 2mm of ST elevation in V2 and V3 in men > 40 years old or 1. 5mm in women according to the ACC/AHA definition. b. Posterior STEMI frequently has ST depression in V1-V3 instead of elevation since the vectors are completely reversed. Hence, this is an ECG of anterior STEMI.

The murmur is best heard at the lower left sternal border as well as at the apex, where it is often more holosystolic and blowing in quality, no doubt due to the mitral regurgitation that usually accompanies HOCM\"Some important points about apical impulse: Normal: visible in the midclavicular line at the fifth intercostal space.

III) Chronic pericarditis (> 6 months)a) Constrictiveb) Effusivec) Adhesive (nonconstrictive)* Serous pericarditis is characteristically produced by non- infectious inflammatory diseases, including rheumatic fever, SLE, and scleroderma, as well as tumors and uremia. An infection in the tissues contiguous to the pericardium-- for example, a bacterial pleuritis--may incite sufficient irritation of the parietal pericardial serosa to cause a sterile serous effusion that can progress to serofibrinous pericarditis and ultimately to a frank suppurative reaction.* Fibrinous and serofibrinous pericarditis are the most frequent types ofpericarditis; these are composed of serous fluid variably admixed with a fibrinous exudate. Common causes include acute MI, postinfarction (Dressier) syndrome (an autoimmune response appearing days-weeks after an MI), uremia, chest radiation, rheumatic fever, SLE, and trauma. A fibrinous reaction also follows routine cardiac surgery.* Purulent or suppurative pericarditis reflects an active infection caused by microbial invasion of the pericardial space.* Hemorrhagic pericarditis has an exudate composed of blood mixed with a fibrinous or suppurative effusion; it is most commonly caused by the spread of a malignant neoplasm to the pericardial space.* Caseous pericarditis is, until proved otherwise, tuber- culous in origin; infrequently, fungal infections evoke a similar reaction.",

This type of defect should not be confused with a patent foramen ovale. True atrial septal defects, that is, defects within the confines of the fossa ovalis.# Child is usually asymptomatic.# Physical signs include- Mild left precordial bulge, - Loud S1, - Wide and fixed S2 split, - Systolic ejection murmur due to increasing flow across RV outflow into pulmonary artery.- Short rumbling mid diastolic murmur proved increasing volume of blood across tricuspid V.# Left atrial enlargement does not occur early in the disease.# Right bundle branch block is common# CXR:- The heart in ASD is sometimes displaced to left (Bedford sign).- Ascending aorta and arch tend to appear smaller than normal, probably due to rotation of ascending aorta by enlarged RA-RV, causing saggital alignment of arch (Small knuckle).- The central pulmonary arteries are enlarged and there is a variable degree of pulmonary plethora, depending on the size of shunt.- Septal lines (Kerley B lines) in a patient of ASD should always suggest an associated mitral valve abnormality (ECD or Lutembacher syndrome).# The \"great hilar dance\" sign characterizes ASD on fluoroscopy.# The \"Goose-neck\" deformity is seen in ASD on cardioangiography. \"Hilar dance sign\" is seen on fluroscopy. Treatment of Atrial septal defect:# Most ostium secundum defects should be closed.# Optimal time for closure is a debated issue, however 2-5 yrs age is considered ideal for surgery.# A large percentage of isolated secundum defects are now closed using transluminal percutaneous devices especially in children who have attained 10 kg or more weight.# For the child in whom device closure is not an option, repair can easily be done on cardiopulmonary bypass using a patch of pericardium, polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex), or Dacron if primary closure is not feasible. Indications for surgery in ASD:# For secundum atrial ventricular defects (which contributes to approximately 70% of ASDs) that fail to spontaneously close and primum AV defects (which contributes to approximately 20% of ASDs), treatment is aimed at closing the defect if a LR shunt of 1. 5: 2 or more is present.# Closure is performed during the first decade, even in absence of symptoms to avoid late-onset RVF, endocarditis, and paradoxical emboli.# Without surgery, 50-60% of infants with complete AV canal defect die from CCF secondary to large L=> R shunting and/or AV valve incompetency by 1 year of age.",

'Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exertional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Often, there is a history of insidious progression of fatigue and dyspnea associated with gradual curtailment of activities. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability.: Exertional syncope may result from a decline in arterial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in non-exercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia. '- Harrison 18/e p1939. Aortic stenosis. Etiology: Congenital (bicuspid, unicuspid). Degenerative calcific. Rheumatic fever. Radiation. Symptoms: AS is rarely of clinical importance until the valve orifice has narrowed to approximately 1 cm2. Once symptoms occur, valve replacement is indicatedQ. Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasingQ obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decadesQ. Exertional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptomsQ. Often, there is a history of insidious progression of fatigue and dyspnea associated with gradual curtailment of activitiesQ. Because the CO at rest is usually well maintained until late in the course, marked fatigability, weakness, peripheral cyanosis, cachexia, and other clinical manifestations of a low CO are usually not prominent until this stage is reachedQ. Orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and pulmonary edema, i. e., symptoms of LV failure, also occur only in the advanced stages of the diseaseQ. Severe pulmonary hypertension leading to RV failure and systemic venous hypertension, hepatomegaly, AF, and TR are usually late findings in patients with isolated severe ASQ. Death in patients with severe AS occurs most commonly in the 7th and 8th decadesQ. Auscultation: An early systolic ejection sound is frequently audible in children, adolescents, and young adults with congenital BAV diseaseQ. Paradoxical splitting of S2. QS4: Audible at the apex. QS3 generally occurs late in the course. QEjection (mid) systolic murmur. QEjection (mid) systolic murmur in AS* Commences shortly after the S1* Increases in intensity to reach a peak toward the middle of ejectionQ* Ends just before aortic valve closureQ* Characteristically low-pitched, rough and rasping in character, and loudest at the base of the heart, most commonly in the 2nd right intercostal spaceQ.* Transmitted upward along the carotid arteries* Occasionally, transmitted downward and to the apex, where it may be confused with the systolic murmur of MR (Gallavardin effectQ).

Reperfusion therapy Medical managemento Initial therapy of cardiogenic shock with M. l. consists of early identification, optimally before frank hypotension is present, and rapid stabilization with correction of metabolic abnormalities. Antiplatelet agents. Beta blockerso Beta blockers and Calcium channel blockers should be withheld in patient with cardiogenic shock. Vasopressorso Vasopressors are recommended for patients with cardiogenic shock. o Although there is no definitive evidence of the superiority ofone vasopressor over another, begin with norepinephrine. IABP (Intra Aortic Balloon pump)o The recommendations for the use of an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) in patients with acute MI and cardiogenic shock are as follows. o For patients in whom mechanical complications (eg, acute mitral regurgitation or rupture of the ventricular septum) are not present and for whom revascularization is planned, intaaortic balloon pumping is not suggested. o However, for such patients whose hemodynamic parameters and clinical status are rapidly deteriorating while on vasopressor and inotropic support, placement of an IABP is suggested# Deterioration is considered present when the systolic blood pressure is persistently below 80 mm. Hg, there is a fall urine output or a worsening of mentation, the arterial oxygen saturation is falling, or cardiac arrhythmias (including heart block or ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation) develop or worsen. o The role of IABP is not well studied in the uncommon patient treated with fibrinolytic therapy whose hemodynamic parameters and clinical status are rapidly deteriorating while on vasopressor and inotropic support and for whom transfer to a facility capable of performing urgent revascularization is planned. Reperfusiono All patients with CS complication Ml should undergo an attempt at reoer fusion. o The recommendations for the use of reperfusion therapy in patients with MI complicated by CS are similar to those for most patients with Ml and differ principally in the level of evidence For patients with ST elevation MI, revascularization is recommended as opposed to fibrinolytic therapy. This recommendation requires that diagnostic coronary' angiography be performed within 90 minutes of initial hospital presentation. For those patients who cannot undergo timely coronary angiography fibrinolytic therapy rather than no immediate reperfusion. For patients with mechanical complications, immediate CABG is recommended and attempt at repair of the mechanical defect as opposed to PCI. Treatment options for cardiogenic shock due to left ventricular dysfunctiono General measures. Ventilation support to correct hypoxemia and, in part, acidosis. Optimize intravascular volume.

Their increased plasma concentration and reduced diameter favor sub endothelial accumulation of these lipoproteins. After oxidation, they are not cleared normally, trigger an inflammatory response. They are taken up by macrophages to form foam cells, which have abnormal effect on the endothelium.

The ECG does not support the other answers, since ventricular tachycardia is a regular wide complex rhythm, atrial flutter can be a regular narrow complex tachycardia but usually atrial flutter waves are seen, and finally atrial fibrillation is an irregular rhythm with no atrial activity. A wide QRS in PSVT can result from a preexisting bundle branch block, or a functional bundle branch block secondary to the tachycardia. This can make the distinction from a ventricular arrhythmia quite difficult.",

Non-paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with variable A V Block is characteristic of Digitalis intoxication. WPW syndrome# ST-segment elevation in leads V1 and V2 is consistent with the Brugada syndrome, QT interval changes are consistent with long or short QT syndromes, while short PR interval and delta wave consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.# The diagnostic triad of WPW consists of:- A wide QRS complex- Relatively short PR interval and- Slurring of the initial part of the QRS (delta wave), the latter effect due to aberrant activation of ventricular myocardium.# The presence of a bypass tract predisposes to reentrant supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (also AF).# Cryomapping can be used to confirm the location of a desired ablation target, such as an accessory pathway in WPW synd, or can be used to determine safety of ablation around AV node by monitoring AV conduction during cooling.# Ablation of bypass tract offers a permanent cure of supraventricular tachycardia.

        "exp": "Ans. a. Thrombolysis (Ref: Harrison 19/e p1603-1605, 18/e p2027-2029). Symptoms and ECG findings are suggestive of ST-elevation MI. Since the patient has come to the hospital 24 hours after onset of symptoms, there will be no benefit from thrombolysis. \"Management of Patients with ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: In the absence of contraindications. it is reasonable to administer fibrinolytic therapy to patients with symptoms of STEMI beginning within the prior 12 to 24 hours who have continuing ischemic symptoms and electrocardiographic evidence of STEMI. Fibrinolytic therapy should not be administered to asymptomatic patients whose initial symptoms of STEMI began more than 24 hours earlier nor to patients whose 12-lead ECG shows only ST-segment depression, except if a true posterior myocardial infarction (MI) is suspected. \"\"Aspirin is essential in the management of patients with suspected STEMI and is effective across the entire spectrum of acute coronary syndromes Rapid inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 in platelets followed by a reduction of thromboxane A levels is achieved by buccal absorption of a chewed 160-325-mg tablet in the Emergency Department. This measure should be followed by daily oral administration of aspirin in a dose of 75-162 mg. \"-- Harrison 19/e p1603\"Morphine is a very effective analgesic for the pain associated with STEMI. However, it may reduce sympathetically mediated arteriolar and venous constriction, and the resulting venous pooling may reduce cardiac output and arterial pressure These hemodynamic disturbances usually respond promptly to elevation of the legs, but in some patients, volume expansion with intravenous saline is required. The patient may experience diaphoresis and nausea, but these events usually pass and are replaced by a feeling of well-being associated with the relief of pain. Morphine also has a vagotonic effect and may cause bradycardia or advanced degrees of heart block, particularly in patients with inferior infarction. These side effects usually respond to atropine (0. 5 mg intravenously). Morphine is routinely administered by repetitive (every 5 min) intravenous injection of small doses (2--4 mg), rather than by the subcutaneous administration of a larger quantity; because absorption may be unpredictable by the latter route.-- Harrison 19/e p1603. Management of Patients with ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction. Prehospital, emergency medical service providers should administer aspirin (162 to 325 mg) to all patients not already taking aspirin, obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients suspected of having STEMIQ, review a reperfusion checklist, and relay this information to a medical facility. Patients with STEMI who have cardiogenic shock, those with contraindications to lytics. and those at high-risk of dying because of heart failure should be channeled immediately to a facility capable of cardiac catheterizationQ. Initial Recognition and Evaluation in the Emergency Department. Initial evaluation in the emergency department focuses on identification of STEMI, early therapy, and reperfusion strategy. Selection of reperfusion strategy' depends on hospital and patient characteristics. Time to reperfusion therapy strongly influences outcomes in STEMI. Patients presenting to a hospital with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) capability should undergo PCI within 90 minutes of first medical contact as a systems goalQ. Patients with STEMI presenting to a non-PCI-capable hospital should be considered for transfer to a PCI-capable hospital based on patient characteristics time from symptom onset, and time to available PCI therapy. STEMI patients presenting to a hospital without PCI capability and who cannot be transferred to a PCI center and undergo PCI within 90 minutes of first medical contact should receive fibrinolytic therapy within 30 minutes of hospital presentation as a systems goat in the absence of contraindications. If pharmacologic reperfusion is selected, fibrinolytic therapy should be administered to STEMI patients with symptom onset within the prior 12 hoursQ. In the absence of contraindications, it is reasonable to administer fibrinolytic therapy to patients with symptoms of STEMI beginning within the prior 12 to 24 hours who have continuing ischemic symptoms & electrocardiographic evidence of STEMIQ. Fibrinolytic therapy should not be administered to asymptomatic patients whose initial symptoms of STEMI began more than 24 hours earlier nor to patients whose 12-lead ECG show s only ST- segment depression, except if a true posterior myocardial infarction (MI) is suspectedQ. Patients should be evaluated for contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy such as a history of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), significant closed head or facial trauma within the past 3 months, uncontrolled hypertension, or ischemic stroke within the past 3 months. STEMI patients at substantial (4%) risk of ICH should be treated with PCI rather than with fibrinolytic therapyQ.",

Produces high-resolution tomographic images of cardiac structures and their movements. Qualitative and quantitative measurements of cardiac dimensions, area, and volume are derived from two- dimensional images or M-mode recordings derived from two-dimensional images. Principle: Ultrasound reflection of cardiac structures to produce images of the heart. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE)* In selected patients, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be performed, in which an ultrasound transducer is mounted on the tip of an endoscope placed in the esophagus and directed toward the cardiac structures.* Clinical Uses of TEE:* Inadequate transthoracic imagesQ* Aortic disease* Infective endocarditisQ* Source of embolismQ* Valve prosthesisQ* IntraoperativeQ* For a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), the imaging is performed with a handheld transducer placed directly on the chest wall.* A limitation of TTE is the inability to obtain high- quality images in all patients, especially those with a thick chest wall or severe lung disease, as ultrasound waves are poorly transmitted through lung parenchyma. Clinical Uses of 2D Echocardiography. Chamber Size and Function* Ideal imaging modality for assessing left ventricular (LV) size and function.* Useful in the diagnosis of LV hypertrophy* Imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Valve Abnormalities* Gold standard for imaging valve morphology and motion* Gold standard for the diagnosis of mitral stenosis. Pericardial Disease* Imaging modality of choice for the detection of pericardial effusion. Intracardiac Masses* LV thrombus appears as an echo-dense structure, usually in the apical region associated with regional wall motion abnormalities* Vegetations appear as mobile linear echo densities attached to valve leaflets.* Atrial myxoma can be diagnosed by the appearance of a well-circumscribed mobile mass with attachments to the atrial septum* The high-resolution images provided by TEE may be required for further delineation of myocardial masses, especially those <1 cm in diameter. Aortic Disease* Definitive diagnosis of a suspected aortic dissection usually requires a TEECongenital Heart Disease* Congenital stenotic or regurgitant valve lesions can be assessed.* Detection of intracardiac shunts* Patency of surgical shunts and conduits. Echocardiography has become an ideal imaging modality for cardiac emergencies. The high-resolution images provided by TEE may be required for further delineation of myocardial masses (tumour or thrombus), especially those <1 cm in diameter.

Angina pectoris About other options: Mitral stenosis -In mitral stenosis symptoms are attributed to increased left atrial pressure which is transmitted to pulmonary veins as well. The increased pulmonary venous pressure results in pulmonary capillary engorgement and pulmonary congestion which produces dyspnea the commonest symptom of mitral stenosis. Other symptoms of mitral stenosis are. Cough. Hemoptysis. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. Attacks of acute pulmonary edema Tricuspid regurgitation. In TR the symptoms are attributed to increase in right ventricular overload.

There is no change in his urine output and he gets a good diuretic response every time he takes his furosemide. Select the characteristic ECG findings.",
        "exp": "Hypokalemia results in prolongation of the QU interval. The delayed repolarization in hypokalemia is best expressed at QU rather than QT prolongation since it can be difficult to separate the T wave from the U wave. In severe cases, the ST segments become depressed. Quinidine, even in therapeutic doses, can cause similar ECG findings. This is felt to be a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias, including Torsades des pointes.",

The right atrium chronic overload is indicated by a P wave of more than 2. 5 mm. \"Normal atrial depolarization vector is oriented downward and towards the subject's left, reflecting the spread of depolarization from the sinus node to the right and then the left atrial myocardium. This vector points toward the positive pole of lead II and toward the negative pole of lead a. VR. Normal P wave is less than 2. 5 mm in lead II. If it is more than 2. 5 mm, this indicate right atrial overload. \"- Harrison 19/e p1453, 18/e p1832. Right Atrial Enlargement (P Pulmonale): Peaked, tall and narrow P waves in leads II, III and a. VF in lung disease are called 'P pulmonale'. The presence of P pulmonale is taken as P wave of more than 2. 5 mm in leads, II, III and a. VF. Though many factors such as verticalization of the heart, increased residual volume and impaired lung function have been reported to be correlated with these changes in the P wave, right atrial overload (right atrial enlargement or increased right atrial pressure or both) is still thought to be responsible for P pulmonale in lung disease. \"- Maeda S, Katsura H.

Br Heart J. 1991; 65: 132-6. \"Right Atrial Enlargement (P Pulmonale): As the activation of the right atrium begins earlier than that of the left atrium, an increase of the right atrial (RA) vector does not prolong the P duration. P pulmonale is characterized by tall and sometimes pointed P waves in leads II, a. VF and III. The amplitude of the P waves is 2. 5 mm in at least one of these leads. In the opposite 'lead a. VL, the P wave is completely negative. The P wave may be higher than normal and pointed in leads V1/V2 rarely in the other precordial leads. \"- Marc Gertsch's 'The ECG: A Two-Step Approach to Diagnosis';- Ch-4",
