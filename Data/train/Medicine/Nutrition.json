Craniotabes is the ear liest manifestation of rickets. Anterior fontanel is large and its closure is delayed beyond 18 months. Bossing of frontal and parietal bones becomes evident after the age of 6 months. Costo chondral junction becomes prominent giving the appearance of a rosary (rachitic rosary). Sternum projects forwards- pigeon chest. Horizontal depression (Harrison's groove) is seen along the lower border of chest corresponding to the insertion of diaphragm. Eruption of primary teeth is delayed. Scoliosis, kyphosis or lordosis may occur. Epiphysis of long bones are widened and appear clinically as broadening of wrists around the age of 6 months. Anterior bowing of legs, knock knee and coxa vara are also seen. Abdomen become protuberant- pot belly. Radiological features: Early radiological features are observed at lower end of radius and ulna. A cup shaped depression is seen at the growing end of the bone(cupping & fraying of metaphysis). Epiphyseal plate is widened. The earliest sign of healing rickets is a dense metaphyseal line. X- linked hypophosphatemia rickets (vitamin - D resistant) occurs due to reduced renal phosphate reabsorption. Calcium and vitamin D and PTH levels are normal, phosphate decreased, alkaline phosphate and osteocalcin increased. Vitamin D-Dependent Rickets. Vitamin D-dependent rickets exists in two forms that manifest with hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia, elevated PTH levels, and the skeletal abnormalities of rickets and osteomalacia. Tetany may be present in severe cases. Vitamin D-dependent rickets Type 1 is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from decreased lalpha - hydroxylase enzyme levels in the proximal tubule that catalyzes the hydroxylation and activation of 25(OH)D3 into l, 25(OH), D3. It can be treated with physiologic replacement doses of l, 25(OH)2. D3. In contrast, vitamin D-dependent rickets type II is due to end-organ resistance to 1, 25(OH ), D3 as a result of mutations in the vitamin D receptor.

Thiamine deficiency produces a diffuse decrease in cerebral glucose utilization and results in mitochondrial damage. Glutamate accumulates owing to impairment of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity and, in combination with the energy deficiency, may result in excitotoxic cell damage.# CEMRI: reveals abnormal enhancement of the mammillary bodies, typical of acute Wernicke's encephalopathy.# TREATMENT: It is a medical emergency. It requires immediate administration of thiamine, in a dose of 100 mg either IV or IM. The dose should be given daily until the patient resumes a normal diet and should be begun prior to treatment with IV glucose solutions. Glucose infusions may precipitate Wernicke's disease in a previously unaffected patient or cause a rapid worsening of an early form of the disease. For this reason, thiamine should be administered to all alcoholic patients requiring parenteral glucose.

Poor diet, impaired absorption, storage and phosphorylation of thiamin in the liver, and the increased requirements for thiamin to metabolise ethanol all contribute. In the developing world, deficiency usually arises as a consequence of a diet based on polished rice. The body has very limited stores of thiamin, so deficiency is manifest after only 1 month on a thiamine-free diet. There are two forms of the disease in adults: * Dry (or neurological) beri-beri manifests with chronic peripheral neuropathy and with wrist and/or foot drop, and may cause Korsakoff's psychosis and Wernicke's encephalopathy Wet (or cardiac) beri-beri causes generalised oedema due to biventricular heart failure with pulmonary congestion. In dry beri-beri, response to thiamin administration is not uniformly good. Multivitamin therapy seems to produce some improvement, however, suggesting that other vitamin deficiencies may be involved. Wernicke's encephalopathy and wet beri-beri should be treated without delay with intravenous vitamin B and C mixture. Korsakoff's psychosis is irreversible and does not respond to thiamin treatment.

Since cobalamin absorption requires multiple steps, including gastric, pancreatic, and ileal processes, the Schillingtest also can be used to assess the integrity of those other organs. Dietary cobalamin is bound in the stomach to a glycoprotein called R-binder protein, which is synthesized in both the stomach and the salivary glands. This cobalamin-R binder complex is formed in the acid milieu of the stomach. Cobalamin absorption has an absolute requirement for intrinsic factor, another glycoprotein synthesized and released by gastric parietal cells, to promote its uptake by specific cobalamin receptors on the brush border of ileal enterocytes. Pancreatic protease enzymes split the cobalamin-R binder complex to release cobalamin in the proximal small intestine, where cobalamin then is bound by intrinsic factor. Cobalamin absorption may be abnormal in the following: Pernicious anemia, a disease in which immunologically mediated atrophy of gastric parietal cells leads to an absence of both gastric acid and intrinsic factor secretion. Chronic pancreatitis as a result of deficiency of pancreatic proteases to split the cobalamin-R binder complex. Achlorhydria, or absence of another factor secreted with acid that is responsible for splitting cobalamin away from the proteins in food to which it is bound. Bacterial overgrowth syndromes, which are most often secondary to stasis in the small intestine, leading to bacterial utilization of cobalamin (often referred to as stagnant bowel syndrome). Ileal dysfunction. Procedure: The Schilling test is performed by administering 58. Co-labeled cobalamin orally and collecting urine for 24 h, and it is dependent on normal renal and bladder function. Urinary excretion of cobalamin will reflect cobalamin absorption provided that intrahepatic binding sites for cobalamin are fully occupied. To ensure saturation of hepatic cobalamin binding sites so that all absorbed radiolabeled cobalamin will be excreted in urine, 1 mg of cobalamin is administered intramuscularly 1 h after ingestion of the radiolabeled cobalamin. The Schilling test may be abnormal (usually defined as <10% excretion in 24 h) in pernicious anemia, chronic pancreatitis, blind loop syndrome, and ileal disease. Whenever an abnormal Schilling test is found, 58. Co-labeled cobalamin should be administered on another occasion bound to intrinsic factor, with pancreatic enzymes, or after a 5-day course of antibiotics (often tetracycline).

        "exp": "*Niacin encompasses nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. *Niacin deficiency causes pellagra - diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, death Niacin encompasses nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. Nicotinamide is an essential pa of the two pyridine nucleotides, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which play a key role as hydrogen acceptors and donors for many enzymes. Niacin can be synthesised in the body in limited amounts from the amino acid tryptophan. Deficiency - pellagra Pellagra was formerly endemic among poor people who subsisted chiefly on maize, which contains niacytin, a form of niacin that the body is unable to utilise. Pellagra can develop in only 8 weeks in individuals eating diets that are very deficient in niacin and tryptophan. It remains a problem in pas of Africa, and is occasionally seen in alcoholics and in patients with chronic small intestinal disease in developed countries. Pellagra can occur in Hanup's disease, a genetic disorder characterised by impaired absorption of several amino acids, including tryptophan. It is also seen occasionally in carcinoid syndrome (p. 678), when tryptophan is consumed in the excessive production of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin). Pellagra has been called the disease of the three Ds: * Dermatitis. Characteristically, there is erythema resembling severe sunburn, appearing symmetrically over the pas of the body exposed to sunlight, paicularly the limbs and especially on the neck but not the face (Casal's necklace, Fig. 19. 13). The skin lesions may progress to vesiculation, cracking, exudation and secondary infection. * Diarrhoea. This is often associated with anorexia, nausea, glossitis and dysphagia, reflecting the presence of a non-infective inflammation that extends throughout the gastrointestinal tract. * Dementia. In severe deficiency, delirium occurs acutely and dementia develops in chronic cases. Treatment is with nicotinamide, given in a dose of 100 mg 3 times daily orally or parenterally. The response is usually rapid. Within 24 hours the erythema diminishes, the diarrhoea ceases and a striking improvement occurs in the patient's mental state. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 98e",

Acute zinc deficiency has been repoed in patients receiving prolonged zinc-free parenteral nutrition and causes diarrhoea, mental apathy, a moist, eczematoid dermatitis, especially around the mouth, and loss of hair. Chronic zinc deficiency occurs in dietary deficiency, malabsorption syndromes, alcoholism and its associated hepatic cirrhosis. It causes the clinical features seen in the very rare congenital disorder known as acrodermatitis enteropathica (growth retardation, hair loss and chronic diarrhoea). Zinc deficiency is thought to be responsible for one-third of the world's population not reaching their optimal height. In the Middle East, chronic deficiency has been associated with dwarfism and hypogonadism. In starvation, zinc deficiency causes thymic atrophy; zinc supplements may accelerate the healing of skin lesions, promote general well-being, improve appetite and reduce the morbidity associated with the under-nourished state, and lower the moality associated with diarrhoea and pneumonia in children.

Positive nitrogen balance means that the body is adding protein; growing children, pregnant women, or people recovering from protein deficiency or illness should be in positive nitrogen balance.* If nitrogen output exceeds nitrogen intake the body is in negative nitrogen balance.
