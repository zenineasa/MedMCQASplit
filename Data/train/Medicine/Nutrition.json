Patients live into adulthood with serum bilirubin levels of 103-428 mmol/L (6-25 mg/dL).In these patients, mutations in the bilirubin UDPGT gene cause the reduction--but not the complete eradication--of the enzyme's activity.

Thiamine deficiency produces a diffuse decrease in cerebral glucose utilization and results in mitochondrial damage. Glutamate accumulates owing to impairment of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity and, in combination with the energy deficiency, may result in excitotoxic cell damage.# CEMRI :reveals abnormal enhancement of the mammillary bodies, typical of acute Wernicke's encephalopathy.# TREATMENT: It is a medical emergency. It requires immediate administration of thiamine, in a dose of 100 mg either IV or IM. The dose should be given daily until the patient resumes a normal diet and should be begun prior to treatment with IV glucose solutions.

Multivitamin therapy seems to produce some improvement, however, suggesting that other vitamin deficiencies may be involved. Wernicke's encephalopathy and wet beri-beri should be treated without delay with intravenous vitamin B and C mixture . Korsakoff's psychosis is irreversible and does not respond to thiamin treatment.

The diagnosis is established by two of the following three criteria: (1) typical abdominal pain in the epigastrium that may radiate to the back, (2) threefold or greater elevation in serum lipase and/or amylase, and (3) confirmatory findings of acute pancreatitis on cross-sectional abdominal imaging.Patients also have associated nausea, emesis, fever, tachycardia, and abnormal findings on abdominal examination. Laboratory studies may reveal leukocytosis, hypocalcemia, and hyperglycemia.Computed tomography (CT) is the best imaging study for initial evaluation of a suspected pancreatic disorder and for the assessment of complications of acute and chronic pancreatitis. It is especially useful for the detection of pancreatic and peripancreatic acute fluid collections, fluid-containing lesions such as pseudocysts, walled-off necrosis, calcium deposits and pancreatic neoplasms. Acute pancreatitis is characterized by (1) enlargement of the pancreatic outline, (2) distoion of the pancreatic contour, and/or (3) a pancreatic fluid that has a different attenuation coefficient than normal pancreas.Ref: Harrison&;s Principles of Internal Medicine; 19th edition; Chapter 370; Approach to the Patient with Pancreatic Disease; Page no: 2093",

        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Vitamin B12 deficiencyREF: Harrison's 18th ed ch: 105The Schilling test is performed to determine the cause for cobalamin malabsorptionSince cobalamin absorption requires multiple steps, including gastric, pancreatic, and ileal processes, the Schillingtest also can be used to assess the integrity of those other organs.Dietary cobalamin is bound in the stomach to a glycoprotein called R-binder protein, which is synthesized in both the stomach and the salivary glands. This cobalamin-R binder complex is formed in the acid milieu of the stomach.Cobalamin absorption has an absolute requirement for intrinsic factor, another glycoprotein synthesized and released by gastric parietal cells, to promote its uptake by specific cobalamin receptors on the brush border of ileal enterocytes.Pancreatic protease enzymes split the cobalamin-R binder complex to release cobalamin in the proximal small intestine, where cobalamin then is bound by intrinsic factor.Cobalamin absorption may be abnormal in the following:Pernicious anemia, a disease in which immunologically mediated atrophy of gastric parietal cells leads to an absence of both gastric acid and intrinsic factor secretion.Chronic pancreatitis as a result of deficiency of pancreatic proteases to split the cobalamin-R binder complexAchlorhydria, or absence of another factor secreted with acid that is responsible for splitting cobalamin away from the proteins in food to which it is boundBacterial overgrowth syndromes, which are most often secondary to stasis in the small intestine, leading to bacterial utilization of cobalamin (often referred to as stagnant bowel syndrome)Ileal dysfunctionProcedure:The Schilling test is performed by administering 58Co-labeled cobalamin orally and collecting urine for 24 h, and it is dependent on normal renal and bladder function.Urinary excretion of cobalamin will reflect cobalamin absorption provided that intrahepatic binding sites for cobalamin are fully occupied. To ensure saturation of hepatic cobalamin binding sites so that all absorbed radiolabeled cobalamin will be excreted in urine, 1 mg of cobalamin is administered intramuscularly 1 h after ingestion of the radiolabeled cobalamin.The Schilling test may be abnormal (usually defined as <10% excretion in 24 h) in pernicious anemia, chronic pancreatitis, blind loop syndrome, and ileal disease.Whenever an abnormal Schilling test is found, 58Co-labeled cobalamin should be administered on another occasion bound to intrinsic factor, with pancreatic enzymes, or after a 5-day course of antibiotics (often tetracycline).Differential Results of Schilling Test in Several Diseases Associated with Cobalamin (Cbl) Malabsorption 58Co-CblWith Intrinsic FactorWith Pancreatic EnzymesAfter 5 Days of AntibioticsPernicious anemia Chronic pancreatitis Bacterial over growth Ileal diseaseReducedReducedReducedReducedNormalReducedReducedReducedReducedNormalReducedReducedReducedReducedNormalReduced",

There is no evidence of toxicity from niacin that is derived from food sources. Flushing always stas in the face and may be accompanied by skin dryness, itching, paresthesia, and headache. Flushing is subject to tachyphylaxis and often improves with time; premedication with aspirin may allete these symptoms. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain also occur at similar doses of niacin. Hepatic toxicity is the most serious toxic reaction caused by sustained-release niacin and may present as jaundice with elevated aspaate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. A few cases of fulminant hepatitis requiring liver transplantation have been repoed at doses of 3-9 g/d. Other toxic reactions include glucose intolerance, hyperuricemia, macular edema, and macular cysts .

        "exp": "*Niacin encompasses nicotinic acid and nicotinamide . *Niacin deficiency causes pellagra - diarrhea,dermatitis, dementia,death Niacin encompasses nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. Nicotinamide is an essential pa of the two pyridine nucleotides, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which play a key role as hydrogen acceptors and donors for many enzymes. Niacin can be synthesised in the body in limited amounts from the amino acid tryptophan. Deficiency - pellagra Pellagra was formerly endemic among poor people who subsisted chiefly on maize, which contains niacytin, a form of niacin that the body is unable to utilise. Pellagra can develop in only 8 weeks in individuals eating diets that are very deficient in niacin and tryptophan. It remains a problem in pas of Africa, and is occasionally seen in alcoholics and in patients with chronic small intestinal disease in developed countries. Pellagra can occur in Hanup's disease, a genetic disorder characterised by impaired absorption of several amino acids, including tryptophan. It is also seen occasionally in carcinoid syndrome (p. 678), when tryptophan is consumed in the excessive production of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin). Pellagra has been called the disease of the three Ds: * Dermatitis. Characteristically, there is erythema resembling severe sunburn, appearing symmetrically over the pas of the body exposed to sunlight, paicularly the limbs and especially on the neck but not the face (Casal's necklace, Fig. 19.13). The skin lesions may progress to vesiculation, cracking, exudation and secondary infection. * Diarrhoea. This is often associated with anorexia, nausea, glossitis and dysphagia, reflecting the presence of a non-infective inflammation that extends throughout the gastrointestinal tract. * Dementia. In severe deficiency, delirium occurs acutely and dementia develops in chronic cases. Treatment is with nicotinamide, given in a dose of 100 mg 3 times daily orally or parenterally. The response is usually rapid. Within 24 hours the erythema diminishes, the diarrhoea ceases and a striking improvement occurs in the patient's mental state. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 98e",

Zinc Zinc is present in most foods of vegetable and animal origin. It is an essential component of many enzymes, including carbonic anhydrase, alcohol dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase. Acute zinc deficiency has been repoed in patients receiving prolonged zinc-free parenteral nutrition and causes diarrhoea, mental apathy, a moist, eczematoid dermatitis, especially around the mouth, and loss of hair. Chronic zinc deficiency occurs in dietary deficiency, malabsorption syndromes, alcoholism and its associated hepatic cirrhosis. It causes the clinical features seen in the very rare congenital disorder known as acrodermatitis enteropathica (growth retardation, hair loss and chronic diarrhoea). Zinc deficiency is thought to be responsible for one-third of the world's population not reaching their optimal height. In the Middle East, chronic deficiency has been associated with dwarfism and hypogonadism. In starvation, zinc deficiency causes thymic atrophy; zinc supplements may accelerate the healing of skin lesions, promote general well-being, improve appetite and reduce the morbidity associated with the under-nourished state, and lower the moality associated with diarrhoea and pneumonia in children.

Positive nitrogen balance means that the body is adding protein; growing children, pregnant women, or people recovering from protein deficiency or illness should be in positive nitrogen balance.* If nitrogen output exceeds nitrogen intake the body is in negative nitrogen balance. This means that the body is losing proteins. People who are starving or who are in extreme weight loss diets, or who suffer from fever, severe illness, or infections are in a state of negative nitrogen balance.",
