        "exp": "Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a cardiac anomaly that refers to a combination of four related hea defects that commonly occur together. The four defects are: Ventricular septal defect (VSD) Tetralogy of Fallot results in low oxygenation of blood. This is due to: Mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the left ventricle the ventricular septal defect (VSD) Preferential flow of the mixed blood from both ventricles through the aoa because of the obstruction to flow through the pulmonary valve. This is known as a right-to-left shunt. Infants with TOF -a cyanotic heart disease- have low blood oxygen saturation. Blood oxygenation varies greatly from one patient to another depending on the severity of the anatomic defects. Typical ranges vary from 60% to around 90%. [Depending on the degree of obstruction, symptoms vary from no cyanosis or mild cyanosis to profound cyanosis at bih. If the baby is not cyanotic then it is sometimes referred to as a \"pink tet\". Other symptoms include a heart murmur which may range from almost imperceptible to very loud, difficulty in feeding, failure to gain weight, retarded growth and physical development, labored breathing (dyspnea) on exeion, clubbing of the fingers and toes, and polycythemia. The baby may turn blue with breast feeding or crying. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 453",
