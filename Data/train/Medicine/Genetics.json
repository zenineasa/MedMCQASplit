        "question": "Locus heterogeneity is feature of",
        "exp": "Ans. c (Muscular dystrophies) (Ref. H - 18th/Ch. 63; 16th/pg. 360). Many disorders exhibit the feature of locus heterogeneityf which refers to the fact that mutations in different genes can cause phenotypicaily similar disorders. For example, osteogenesis imperfecta, long QT syndrome, muscular dystrophy, homocystinuria, retinitis pigmentosa, and hereditary predisposition to colon cancer or breast cancer can each be caused by mutations in distinct genes. In these cases, the choice of which genes to test is often determined by unique clinical and family history features, the relative prevalence of mutations in various genes, or test avail- ability. ALLELIC HETEROGENEITY# Allelic heterogeneity refers to the fact that different mutations in the same genetic locus can cause an identical or similar phenotype.# For example, many different mutations of the (3-globin locus can cause b-thalassemia.# Exceptions include: 1) A founder effect, in which a particular mutation that does not affect reproductive capacity can be traced to a single individual; 2) \"Hot spots\" for mutations, in which the nature of the DNA sequence predisposes to a recurring mutation; and3) Localization of mutations to certain domains that are particularly critical for protein function. Allelic heterogeneity creates a practical problem for genetic testing because one must often examine the entire genetic locus for mutations, as these can differ in each patient. Phenotypic Heterogeneity# Phenotypic heterogeneity occurs when more than one phenotype is caused by allelic mutations (e. g., different mutations in the same gene).# For example, mutations in the myosin VIIIA gene can result in four distinct clinical disorders: 1) Autosomal recessive deafness DFNB2, 2) Autosomal dominant nonsyndromic deafness DFNA11, 3) Usher IB syndrome (congenital deafness, retinitis pigmentosa) and4) An atypical variant of Usher's syndrome, # Similarly, identical mutations in the FGFR2 gene can result in very distinct phenotypes: Crouzon syndrome (craniofacial synostosis), or Pfeiffer syndrome (acrocephalopolysyndactyly). Locus or Nonallelic Heterogeneity and Phenocopies# Nonallelic or locus heterogeneity refers to the situation in which a similar disease phenotype results from mutations at different genetic loci.# This often occurs when more than one gene product produces different subunits of an interacting complex or when different genes are involved in the same genetic cascade or physiologic pathway.# For example, osteogenesis imperfecta can arise from mutations in two different procollagen genes (COL1. A1 or COL1. A2) that are located on different chromosomes. The effects of inactivating mutations in these two genes are similar because the protein products comprise different subunits of the helical collagen fiber.# Similarly, muscular dystrophy syndromes can be caused by mutations in various genes, consistent with the fact that it can be transmitted in an X-linked (Duchenne or Becker), autosomal dominant (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1), or autosomal recessive (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2) manner. Mutations in the X-linked DMD gene, which encodes dystrophin, are the most common cause of muscular dystrophy.# Recognition of nonallelic heterogeneity is important for several reasons: (1) the ability to identify disease loci in linkage studies is reduced by including patients with similar phenotypes but different genetic disorders; (2) genetic testing is more complex because several different genes need to be considered along with the possibility of different mutations in each of the candidate genes; and (3) novel information is gained about how genes or proteins interact, providing unique insights into molecular physiology. Genetic terms1. Locus heterogenicity. Mutations at different loci can produce the same phenotype (e. g., albinism)2. Variable expression. Nature and severity of the phenotype varies from one individual to another. 3. Incomplete penetrance. Not all individuals with a mutant genotype show the mutant phenotype. 4. Pleiotrophy. One gene has > one effect on an individual's phenotype5. Imprinting. Differences in phenotype depend on whether the mutation is of maternal or paternal origin (e. g., Angelman's syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome )6. Anticipation. Severity of disease worsens as age of onset of disease is earlier in succeeding generation (e. g., Huntington's disease)7. Loss of heterozygosity. If patient inherits or develops mutation in a tumor suppressor gene, complementary allele must be deleted/mutated before cancer develops. This is not true of oncogenes. 8. Dominant negative mutation. Exerts a dominant effect. A heterozygote produces a nonfunctional altered protein that prevents the normal gene product from functioning. 9. Linkage disequilibrium. Tendency for certain alleles at 2 linked loci to occur together often than expected by chance. Measured in a population, not in family; and often varies in different populations. 10. Mosaicism. Occurs when cells have different genetic makeup (e. g. Lyonization-random X-inactivation in females)",

        "question": "A young, tall, thin male with arachnodactyly has ectopia lentis in both eyes. The most likely diagnosis is",
        "exp": "Marfan Syndrome Marfan syndrome is a disorder of connective tissues, manifested principally by changes in the skeleton, eyes, and cardiovascular system. Its prevalence is estimated to be 1 in 5000. Approximately 70% to 85% of cases are familial and transmitted by autosomal dominant inheri- tance. The remainder are sporadic and arise from new mutations. Pathogenesis. Marfan syndrome results from an inherited defect in an extracellular glycoprotein called fibrillin 1. There are two fundamental mechanisms by which loss of fibrillin leads to the clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome: loss of structural suppo in microfibril rich connective tissue and excessive activation of TGF-b signaling. Each of these is discussed below. * Fibrillin is the major component of microfibrils found in the extracellular matrix. These fibrils provide a scaffolding on which tropoelastin is deposited to form elastic fibers. Although microfibrils are widely distributed in the body, they are paicularly abundant in the aoa, ligaments, and the ciliary zonules that suppo the lens; these tissues are prominently affected in Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin occurs in two homologous forms, fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, encoded by two separate genes, FBN1 and FBN2, mapped on chromo- somes 15q21. 1 and 5q23. 31, respectively. Mutations of FBN1 underlie Marfan syndrome; mutations of the related FBN2 gene are less common, and they give rise to congenital contractural arachnodactyly, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities. Mutational analysis has revealed more than 600 distinct mutations of the FBN1 gene in individuals with Marfan syndrome. Most of these are missense mutations that give rise to abnormal fibrillin-1. These can inhibit polymerization of fibrillin fibers (dominant negative effect). Alternatively, the reduction of fibrillin content below a ceain threshold weakens the connective tissue (haploinsufficiency). * While many clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome can be explained by changes in the mechanical propeies of the extracellular matrix resulting from abnormalities of fibrillin, several others such as bone overgrowth and myxoid changes in mitral valves cannot be attributed to changes in tissue elasticity. Recent studies indicate that loss of microfibrils gives rise to abnormal and excessive activation of transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), since normal microfibrils sequester TGF-b and thus control the bioavailability of this cytokine. Excessive TGF-b signaling has deleterious effects on vascular smooth muscle development and it also increases the activity of metalloproteases, causing loss of extracellular matrix. This schema is suppoed by two sets of observations. First, in a small number of individuals with clinical features of Marfan syndrome (MFS2), there are no mutations in FBN1 but instead gain-of-function mutations in genes that encode TGF-b receptors. Second, in mouse models of Marfan syndrome generated by mutations in Fbn1, administrationof antibodies to TGF-b prevents alterations in the aoa and mitral valves. Clinical Features. Although mitral valve lesions are more frequent, they are clinically less impoant than aoic lesions. Loss of connective tissue suppo in the mitral valve leaflets makes them soft and billowy, creating a so-called floppy valve. Valvular lesions, along with lengthening of the chordae tendineae, frequently give rise to mitral regurgitation. Similar changes may affect the tricuspid and, rarely, the aoic valves. Echocardiography greatly enhances the ability to detect the cardiovascular abnormalities and is therefore extremely valuable in the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. The great majority of deaths are caused by rupture of aoic dissections, followed in impoance by cardiac failure. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 145",

In some patients the testicular tubules are totally atrophied and replaced by pink, hyaline, collagenous ghosts. In others, apparently normal tubules are interspersed with atrophic tubules. In some patients all tubules are primitive and appear embryonic, consisting of cords of cells that never developed a lumen or progressed to mature spermatogenesis. Leydig cells appear prominent, as a result of the atrophy and crowding of the tubules and elevation of gonadotropin concentrations. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome have a higher risk for breast cancer (20 times more common than in normal males), extragonadal germ cell tumors, and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. The classic pattern of Klinefelter syndrome is associated with a 47, XXY karyotype (90% of cases). This complement of chromosomes results from nondisjunction during the meiotic divisions in the germ cells of one of the parents. Maternal and paternal nondisjunction at the first meiotic division are roughly equally involved. There is no phenotypic difference between those who receive the extra X chromosome from their father and those who receive it from their mother. Maternal age is increased in the cases associated with errors in oogenesis. In addition to this classic karyotype, approximately 15% of patients with Klinefelter syndrome have been found to have a variety of mosaic patterns, most of them being 46, XY/47, XXY. Other patterns are 47, XXY/48, XXXY and variations on this theme. As is the case with normal females, all but one X chromosome undergoes inactivation in patients with Klinefelter syndrome. Why then, do the patients with this disorder have hypogonadism and associated features? The explanation for this lies in genes on the X chromosome that escape lyonization and in the pattern of X inactivation. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 165",

        "exp": "These benign tumors usually develop in or under the skin, but can also grow inside the body. Sometimes, a growth will involve multiple nerves (plexiform neurofibroma). Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase with age. Bone deformities Neurofibromas arise from nonmyelinating Schwann cells that only express the inactive version of the NF1 gene, which leads to a complete loss of expression of functional neurofibromin. While one defective allele may be inherited, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) must occur before a neurofibroma can form; this is called the 'two-hit hypothesis'. This LOH happens by the same mechanisms, such as oxidative DNA damage, that causes mutations in other cells. Once a nonmyelinating Schwann cell has suffered inactivation of its NF1 genes, it begins to proliferate rapidly. This condition is called hyperplasia, which is cell growth beyond what is normally seen. However, despite increased numbers of nonmyelinating Schwann cells, there is no neurofibroma yet. In order for the neurofibroma to develop, cells that are heterozygous for the NF1 gene must be recruited to the site. It has been hypothesized that the proliferating nonmyelinating Schwann cells secrete chemoattractants such as the KIT ligand, and angiogenic factors such as the heparin-binding growth factor midkine. These chemicals promote the migration of different kinds of cells that are heterozygous for the NF1 gene into the hyperplastic lesions created by the nonmyelinating Schwann cells. These cell types include fibroblasts, perineurial cells, endothelial cells, and mast cells. The mast cells then secrete mitogens or survival factors that alter the developing tumor microenvironment and result in neurofibroma formation. it has multifactorial inheritance Ref Robbins 9/e pg 174",

        "exp": "Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) The MPSs are a group of closely related syndromes that result from genetically determined deficiencies of enzymes involved in the degradation of mucopolysaccharides (glycosaminoglycans). Chemically, mucopolysaccharides are long-chain complex carbohydrates that are linked with proteins to form proteoglycans. They are abundant in the ground substance of connective tissue. The glycosaminoglycans that accumulate in MPSs are dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, keratan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate. The enzymes involved in the degradation of these molecules cleave terminal sugars from the polysaccharide chains disposed along a polypeptide or core protein. In the absence of enzymes, these chains accumulate within lysosomes in various tissues and organs of the body. Several clinical variants of MPS, classified numerically from MPS I to MPS VII, have been described, each resulting from the deficiency of one specific enzyme. All the MPSs except one are inherited as autosomal recessive traits; the exception, Hunter syndrome, is an X-linked recessive trait. Within a given group (e. g., MPS I, characterized by a deficiency of a-l-iduronidase), subgroups exist that result from different mutant alleles at the same genetic locus. Thus, the severity of enzyme deficiency and the clinical picture even within subgroups are often different. In general, MPSs are progressive disorders, characterized by coarse facial features, clouding of the cornea, joint stiffness, and mental retardation. Urinary excretion of the accumulated mucopolysaccharides is often increased. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 154",

        "exp": "ANSWER: (C) Somatomedin. REF: Harrison's Internal Medicine 17th edition chapter 333. Symptoms are suggestive of Acromegaly & GH effects are mediated via Somatomedins. Principal Somatomedins are IGF-I, IGF-II. CLINICAL FEATURES OF ACROMEGALY: Protean manifestations of GH and IGF-I hypersecretion are indolent and often are not clinically diagnosed for 10 years or more. Acral bony overgrowth results in frontal bossing, increased hand and foot size, mandibular enlargement with prognathism, and widened space between the lower incisor teeth. In children and adolescents, initiation of GH hypersecretion prior to epiphyseal long bone closure is associated with development of pituitary gigantism. Soft tissue swelling results in increased heel pad thickness, increased shoe or glove size, ring tightening, characteristic coarse facial features, and a large fleshy nose. Other commonly encountered clinical features include hyperhidrosis, deep and hollow- sounding voice, oily skin, arthropathy, kyphosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, proximal muscle weakness and fatigue, acanthosis nigricans, and skin tags. Generalized visceromegaly occurs, including cardiomegaly, macroglossia, and thyroid gland enlargement. The most significant clinical impact of G H exces s occurs with respect to the cardiovascular system. Coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy with arrhythmias, left ventricular hypertrophy, decreased diastolic function, and hypertension occur in about 30% of patients. Upper airway obstruction with sleep apnea occurs in more than 60% of patients and isassociated with both soft tissue laryngeal airway obstruction and central sleep dysfunction. Diabetes mellitus develops in 25% of patients with acromegaly, and most patients are intolerant of a glucose load (as GH counteracts the action of insulin). Laboratory Investigation. Age- and gender-matched serum IGF-I (somatomedin) levels are elevated in acromegaly. Consequently, an IGF-I level provides a useful laboratory screening measure when clinical features raise the possibility of acromegaly. Due to the pulsatility of GH secretion, measurement of a single random GH level is not useful for the diagnosis or exclusion of acromegaly and does not correlate with disease severity. The diagnosis of acromegaly is confirmed by demonstrating the failure of GH suppression to <1 ug/L within 1-2 h of an oral glucose load (75 g).",

        "exp": "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia are any of several autosomal recessive diseases resulting from mutations of genes for enzymes mediating the biochemical steps of production of mineralocoicoids, glucocoicoids or sex steroids from cholesterol by the adrenal glands (steroidogenesis). Most of these conditions involve excessive or deficient production of sex steroids and can alter development of primary or secondary sex characteristics in some affected infants, children or adults hypokalemia alkalosis is not seen Each form of CAH is associated with a specific defective gene. The most common type (90-95% of cases) involves the gene for 21-hydroxylase, which is found on 6p21. 3 as pa of the HLA complex. 21-Hydroxylase deficiency results from a unique mutation with two highly homologous near-copies in series consisting of an active gene (CYP21. A2) and an inactive pseudogene (CYP21. A1P). Mutant alleles result from recombination between the active and pseudogenes (gene conversion). About 5% of cases of CAH are due to defects in the gene encoding 11b-hydroxylase and consequent 11b-hydroxylase deficiency. Other, more rare forms of CAH are caused by mutations in genes including HSD3. B2 (3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2), CYP17. A1 (17a-hydroxylase/17, 20-lyase), CYP11. A1 (P450scc; cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme), STAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; St. AR), CYB5A (cytochrome b5), and CYPOR (cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase; POR).

        "exp": "Ans. c (Trisomy). (Ref Harrison, Medicine, 18th/Ch. 62. Chromosome Disorders). Clinically, the most important of numerical abnormality is trisomy 21, the most frequent cause of Down syndrome. Depending on the maternal age structure of the population and the utilization of prenatal testing, the incidence of trisomy 21 ranges from 1/600 to 1/1000 livebirths, making it the most common chromosome abnormality in live-bom individuals. Like most trisomies, the incidence of trisomy 21 is highly correlated with maternal age, increasing from about 1/1500 livebirths for women 20 years of age to 1/30 for women 45 years. In addition to trisomy 21, only two other autosomal trisomies, 13 and 18, occur with any frequency in livebirths. Incidence rates for trisomies 13 and 18 in livebirths are 1/20, 000 and 1/10, 000, respectively. Unlike trisomy 21 that is associated with near-normal life expectancy, both trisomies 13 and 18 are associated with death in infancy, typically occurring during the first year of life. Three sex chromosome trisomies the 47, XXX, 47, XXY (Klinefelter's syndrome), and 47, XYY conditions are quite common, with each occurring in about 1/2000 newborns. Of all the trisomic conditions, three have fewest phenotypic complications. In fact, with the exception of infertility in klinefelter's sundrome, it is likely that most individuals with such trisomies may go undetected. Table. Numerical chromosomal abnormalities include.

X)# PATHOPHYSIOLOGY- Approximately one-half of individuals with Turner's syndrome have a 45, X karyotype, about 20% have 45, X/46, XX mosaicism, and the remainder have structural abnormalities of the X chromosome such as X fragments, isochromosomes, or rings. The clinical features of TS result from haploinsufficiency of multiple X chromosomal genes (e. g., short stature homeobox, SHOX). However, imprinted genes also may be affected when the inherited X has different parental origins.# CLINICAL FEATURES- TS is characterized by bilateral streak gonads, primary amenorrhea, short stature, and multiple congenital anomalies in phenotypic females. It affects 1 in 2500 women and is diagnosed at different ages depending on the dominant clinical features. Prenatally, a diagnosis of TS usually is made incidentally after chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis for unrelated reasons such as advanced maternal age. Prenatal ultrasound findings include increased nuchal translucency. The postnatal diagnosis of TS should be considered in female neonates or infants with lymphedema, nuchal folds, low hairline, or left-sided cardiac defects and in girls with unexplained growth failure or pubertal delay. The vast majority of women with TS develop complete ovarian failure.# Treatment:- Individuals with congenital heart defects (CHDs) (30%) (bicuspid aortic valve, 30-50%; coarctation of the aorta, 30%; aortic root dilation, 5%) require long-term follow, antibiotic prophylaxis for dental or surgical procedures, and serial imaging of aortic root dimensions, as progressive aortic root dilation is associated with increased risk of aortic dissection.- Individuals found to have congenital renal and urinary tract malformations (30%) are at risk for urinary tract infections, hypertension, and nephrocalcinosis. Hypertension can occur independently.- Clitoral enlargement or other evidence of virilization suggests the presence of covert, translocated Y chromosomal material and is associated with increased risk of gonadoblastoma, apparently as a consequence of Y chromosomal genes distinct from SRY. Autoimmune hypothyroidism (15-30%) can occur in childhood.- The treatment of short stature in children with TS remains a challenge, as untreated final height rarely exceeds 150 cm in nonmosaic 45, X TS. High-dose recombinant growth hormone stimulates growth rate in children with TS and may be used alone or in combination with low doses of the nonaromatizable anabolic steroid oxandrolone (up to 0. 05 mg/kg per d) in an older child (>9 years).- Most physicians now choose to initiate low-dose estrogen therapy.",

        "question": "Disecting hematoma is a clinical complication occurring in",
        "exp": "Marfan Syndrome Marfan syndrome is a disorder of connective tissues, manifested principally by changes in the skeleton, eyes, and cardiovascular system. Its prevalence is estimated to be 1 in 5000. Approximately 70% to 85% of cases are familial and transmitted by autosomal dominant inheritance. The remainder are sporadic and arise from new mutations. Pathogenesis. Marfan syndrome results from an inherited defect in an extracellular glycoprotein called fibrillin- 1. There are two fundamental mechanisms by which loss of fibrillin leads to the clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome: loss of structural suppo in microfibril rich connective tissue and excessive activation of TGF-b signaling. Each of these is discussed below. * Fibrillin is the major component of microfibrils found in the extracellular matrix. These fibrils provide a scaffolding on which tropoelastin is deposited to form elastic fibers. Although microfibrils are widely distributed in the body, they are paicularly abundant in the aoa, ligaments, and the ciliary zonules that suppo the lens; these tissues are prominently affected in Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin occurs in two homologous forms, fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, encoded by two separate genes, FBN1 and FBN2, mapped on chromosomes 15q21. 1 and 5q23. 31, respectively. Mutations of FBN1 underlie Marfan syndrome; mutations of the related FBN2 gene are less common, and they give rise to congenital contractural arachnodactyly, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities. Mutational analysis has revealed more than 600 distinct mutations of the FBN1 gene in individuals with Marfan syndrome. Most of these are missense mutations that give rise to abnormal fibrillin-1. These can inhibit polymerization of fibrillin fibers (dominant negative effect). Alternatively, the reduction of fibrillin content below a ceain threshold weakens the connective tissue (haploinsufficiency). * While many clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome can be explained by changes in the mechanical propeies of the extracellular matrix resulting from abnormalities of fibrillin, several others such as bone overgrowth and myxoid changes in mitral valves cannot be attributed to changes in tissue elasticity. Recent studies indicate that loss of microfibrils gives rise to abnormal and excessive activation of transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), since normal microfibrils sequester TGF-b and thus control the bioavailability of this cytokine. Excessive TGF-b signaling has deleterious effects on vascular smooth muscle development and it also increases the activity of metalloproteases, causing loss of extracellular matrix. This schema is suppoed by two sets of observations. First, in a small number of individuals with clinical features of Marfan syndrome (MFS2), there are no mutations in FBN1 but instead gain-of-function mutations in genes that encode TGF-b receptors. Second, in mouse models of Marfan syndrome generated by mutations in Fbn1, administration of antibodies to TGF-b prevents alterations in the aoa and mitral valves. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 144",
