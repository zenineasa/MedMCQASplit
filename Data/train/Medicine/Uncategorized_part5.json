AIVR is also the most charachteristic arrhythmia seen after reperfusion has begun and hence Myocardial Reperfusion is the single best answer of choice. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR) AIVR is an automatic rhythm originating within the ventricle with rates between 40 to, 120 beats / min AIVR is believed to be caused by abnormal automaticity and is considered to be a brief self limiting arrhythmia, that does not usually require any specific treatment unless the patient is symptomatic The onset of this arrhythmia is gradual (non paroxysmal) and occurs when the rate of ventricular tachycardia exceeds the sinus rate because of sinus slowing or SA / AV block AIVR is a characteristic feature of myocardial reperfusion, and when it occurs in the setting of myocardial infarction and coronary reperfusion it is also called Reperfusion Arrhythmia' or Reperfusion Rhythm'. `It commonly occurs at the moment of reperfusion of an occluded coronaryaery' - Braunwald AIVR can be seen in the absence of any structural heart disease but is usually seen in patients who have an underlying structure heart disease. 0. 12 sec) (Bizzare) * Fusion beats * Capture beats * AV dissociation * Rhythm: Regular \" align=\"left\" height=\"94\" width=\"226\">Treatment of Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm No specific treatment is usually required (No treatment in Asymptomatic patients) Since the ventricular rate usually ranges the same as sinus rhythm, hemodynamic compromise does not occur Also the condition is self limiting and transient and does not appear to affect the patients clinical course or prognosis.

He was managed by prompt Endotracheal intubation. After ET tube placement the maximal cardiac impulse shifted fuher to the right side. What should be the next step in management?",
        "exp": "Answer is B (Remove tube and Reattempt intubation): The ideal next step is to confirm the position of ET tube and / or Remove the tube and reattempt intubation, if the tube is not in the trachea. As none of the options provided in the question can confirm the true position of the ET tube in the trachea the best course of action is to remove the tube and reattempt intubation. The patient in question is presenting with characteristic features of left sided diaphragmatic hernia. Incorrect placement of the tube into the esophagus (Esophageal intubation) will result in distension of stomach and bowel loops in the left hemithorax which would inturn shift the mediastinum and apical impulse to the right. The apical cardiac impulse in this patient has been observed to shift fuher to the right after attempted ET intubation. This raises doubt about the correct positioning of ET tube in the trachea and suggests the possibility of improper placement of the ET tube into the esophagus. The best next step in such a scenario is to confirm the position of ET tube. None of the options provided in the question however allow us to confirm the position of the ET tube in the trachea An X- ray chest cannot distinguish between tracheal and esophageal intubation and cannot confirm the position of the ET tube in the trachea. Hence option (A) can be excluded. A postero- anterior chest X-Ray (PA chest) can not confirm the position of tube in the trachea, as the oesophagus is situated immediately behind the trachea. A chest x-ray taken following intubation is done to confirm correct length of the tube rather than to find out whether it is sited in the trachea. This leaves us still in doubt regarding the correct position of the ET tube and when in doubt, the best course of action is to remove the tube and reattenzpt intubation. When in doubt take it out'. It is easy to wrongly intubate the esophagus. This must be recognized immediately. If the clinical state of the patient deteriorates after intubation or if there is any doubt about tube placement, the tube should be removed' - Lee",

        "exp": "Answer is C (Nifedipine): Presence of accelerated hypertension with blood pressures in excess of 200/100 mm Hg in a patient with high thoracic spinal cord injury (above T6) suggests a diagnosis of Autonomic Dysreflexia. Urgent management of the hypeensive crisis is paramount to prevent complications such as retinal haemorrhage, seizures, hypeensive encephalopathy or an intracerebral haemorrhage. Oral Clonidine and/or Nifedipine are the most commonly used pharmacological agents to control hypeensive crisis in patients with autonomic dysreflexia Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) (Hypeensive Crisis following Spinal Cord injury above T6) What is Autonomic Dysreflexia Autonomic Dysretlexia (AD) is a syndrome of sympathetic overactivity that typically affects patient with spinal cord injury above or proximal to the upper thoracic level (T6 or above) due to unopposed sympathetic nervous system impulses. This is an acute medical emergency that occurs in patients whose spinal cord injury lies above the greater splanchnic outflow from thoracolumbar preganglionic sympathetic neurons (T6 or above). This results from interruption of normal feedback mechanism in the sympathetic pathway. Patients with spinal cord injury below T8 are rarely affected by this condition. When does Autonomic Dysreflexia occur Autonomic Dysreflexia is traditionally/historically believed to occur 4-6 months after the spinal cord injury (After the phase of spinal shock resolves) However recently AD has also been repoed in early phases after SCI How does Autonomic Dysreflexia Present The most characteristic presentation of AD is sudden increase in Blood Pressure (Accelerated Hypertension) often in excess 200mm Hg systolic and 100 mm Hg diastolic. It is impoant to note that normal resting Blood Pressure in patients with spinal cord injury is often 80 to 90 mm. Hg, and a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Kg may he an early sign of autonomic dysreflexia Bradvcardia in association with hypertension is another typical feature of AD and this results primarily from vagal compensation. Bradvcardia is however present in only 50% of the cases. What are the Triggering factors for AD Autonomic Dysreflexia can be triggered by any painful/noxious stimulus in the clermatomes (skin), muscles or viscera below the level of cord injury. Bladder Distension is the single most common inciting stimuli Trigger Stimuli / Inciting stimuli for AD * Distension of Bladder (Due to obstructed urine outflow from spasm/kinked Foley's catheter) * Bowel impaction (Constipation) * Irritation from skin lesions (Dermatomes) Insect bites, pressure sores, constrictive clothing, localized wounds or ingrowing toe nails * Labour and pregnancy * Gynecological instrumentation and/or patients with SCI undergoing surgery What is the treatment of AD Treatment of Autonomic Dysreflexia Prevention of Trigger Factors Prevention of Trigger Factors Avoid Bladder Distension (leading cause) (prompt catheterization) Avoid Fecal Impaction (Second leading cause) (Manual evacuation, anal sphincter block, bowel programs) Anti-cholinergic Medicines are recommended Management of Hypeensive crisis Management of Hypeensive crisis Patient should be brought in a sitting position with legs dangling to take advantage of natural ohostosis. Pharmacological management with oral/transdermal medicine should be initiated - Transdermal Nitroglycerine - Oral Clonidine - Oral Nifedipine - Oral Phenoxybenzamine - Oral Prazocin Pharmacological management with intravenous medicines may be considered in cases of hypeensive crises or encephalopathy or intraoperative hypertension - Nitroprusside - Diazoxide - Trimethaphan - Fenoldopam",

It can be distinguished from atrial flutter, which is a more organized electrical circuit usually in the right atrium that produces characteristic saw-toothed p-waves on the ECG; in atrial flutter, the discharges circulate rapidly at a rate of 260300 beats per minute (bpm) around the atrium; in AF, there is no regularity of this kind at all.

Dengue stas with chills, headache, pain upon moving the eyes, and low backache. Painful aching in the legs and joints occurs during the first hours of illness (breakbone fever). The temperature rises quickly as high as 104deg F (40deg C), with relative low heart rate and low blood pressure. The eyes become reddened. A flushing or pale pink rash comes over the face and then disappears. Fever and other signs of dengue last for two to four days, followed by rapid drop in temperature (defervescence) with profuse sweating.

The first hea sound is made by the mitral and tricuspid hea valves closing. These are normally synchronous, and the sounds are termed M1 and T1, respectively. M1 becomes louder in mitral stenosis. It may be the most prominent sign. If pulmonary hypertension secondary to mitral stenosis is severe, the P2 (pulmonic) component of the second hea sound (S2) will become loud. An opening snap that is a high-pitch additional sound may be heard after the A2 (aoic) component of the second hea sound (S2), which correlates to the forceful opening of the mitral valve. A mid-diastolic rumbling murmur with presystolic accentuation will be heard after the opening snap. The murmur is best heard at the apical region and is not radiated. Since it is a low-pitch sound, it is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope. Its duration increases with worsening disease. Rolling the patient toward left as well as isometric exercise will accentuate the murmur. A thrill might be present when palpating at the apical region of the precordium.",

Omalizumab is indicated for treatment of 'moderate to severe' persistent asthma in patients who react to perennial allergens (Allergic Asthma). Treatment with Omalizumab has shown to reduce the number of exacerbations in patients with severe asthma and may improve asthma control. However this treatment is very expensive and is only suitable for highly selected patients who are not controlled on maximal doses of inhaler therapy and have a high circulating IgE (within a specified range).

They are heard just after the first hea sound. The sounds occur in the presence of a dilated aoa or pulmonary aery or in the presence of a bicuspid or flexible stenotic aoic or pulmonary valve. The diastolic correlate of the ejection click is the opening snap, which occurs at maximal opening of a flexibly stenotic mitral or tricuspid valve. Non ejection clicks/ midsystolic clicks occurring with or without a late systolic murmur (crescendo-decrescendo), often denotes prolapse of one/both leaflets of the mitral valve. They are best heard along the lower left sternal border and at the left ventricular apex. ECG is normal commonly in MVP, but may show biphasic/ inveed T waves inleads II, III and a. VF.

Bronchial breath sounds The bronchial breath sound originates in the larger airways and are transmitted directly to the chest wall without passing through the alveoli. The sound passing through the lung tissue is not modified and auscultated like bronchial sounds from the chest walls. This sound resembles the sound obtained by listening over the trachea (directly placing a stethoscope on the trachea). The characteristics of these sounds are: Duration of expiration is equal to or longer than that of inspiration. Intensity of expiration is more than that of inspiration. There is a definite gap between inspiration and expiration. Sounds are harsh or aspirate in nature. They are high-pitched with frequencies above 600. Hz Bronchial Breath Sounds Bronchial breath sounds are of three types: tubular, cavernous, and amphoric. Tubular Bronchial Breath sound The tubular bronchial breath sound is a high pitched sound resulting from the passage of vibrations produced in the small bronchi directly to the chest wall through a solid lung tissue. This is seen when the lung parenchyma becomes a solid mass, as in consolidation. Cavernous Bonchial Breath sound The cavernous bronchial breath sounds is a low pitched bronchial breath sound heard over a cavity, which is situated superficially and communicated to a patent bronchus. The size of the cavity should be more than 2 cm in diameter to produce a cavernous breath sound. Amphoric Bronchial Breath sound The amphoric bronchial breath sounds is a high pitched bronchial sound that resembles the sound produced by blowing air into a wide-mouthed bottle. This is heard over a very large cavity communicating pneumothorax. It is also seen in large pulmonary cysts having communication with a patent bronchus.",

It is much less frequent since proton-pump inhibitors and other treatments became available for peptic ulcer disease.

' Milk-Alkali Syndrome The milk-alkali syndrome is due to excessive ingestion of calcium and absorbable antacids such as milk or calcium carbonateQ. It is much less frequent since proton-pump inhibitors and other treatments became available for peptic ulcer disease. For a time, the increased use of calcium carbonate in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism led to reappearance of the syndrome. Several clinical presentations-acute, subacute, and chronic-have been described, all of which feature hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal failureQ. The chronic form of the disease, termed Burnett's syndrome, is associated with irreversible renal damageQ. The acute syndromes reverse if the excess calcium and absorbable alkali are stoppedQ. Individual susceptibility is dependent on the fractional calcium absorption as a function of calcium intake. Some individuals absorb a high fraction of calcium, even with intakes >2 g of elemental calcium per day, instead of reducing calcium absorption with high intake, as occurs in most normal individuals. Development of hypercalcemia causes increased sodium excretion and some depletion of total-body water. These phenomena and perhaps some suppression of endogenous PTH secretion due to mild hypercalcemia lead to increased bicarbonate resorption and to alkalosis in the face of continued calcium carbonate ingestion Alkalosis per se selectively enhances calcium resorption in the distal nephron, thus aggravating the hypercalcemia. The cycle of mild hypercalcemia -4 bicarbonate retention alkalosis renal calcium retention -4 severe hypercalcemia perpetuates and aggravates hypercalcemia and alkalosis as long as calcium and absorbable alkali are ingestedQ.",

The body has very limited stores of thiamine, so deficiency manifest after only 1 month on a thiamine-free diet. There are two forms of the disease in adults: Dry (or neurological) beri-beri manifests with chronic peripheral neuropathy and with wrist and/or foot drop, and may cause Korsakoff's psychosis and Wernicke's encephalopathy. Wet (or cardiac) beri-beri causes generalised oedema, due to biventricular heart failure with pulmonary congestion. In dry beri-beri, response to thiamine administration is not uniformly good. Multivitamin therapy seems to produce some improvement, however, suggesting that other vitamin deficiencies may be involved.

A diagnosis of Intrinsic factor deficiency can be established if radiolabelled cobalamine (Vitamin B12) appears in urine after administration of Intrinsic factor. Since cobalamine absorption requires multiple steps including gastric, pancreatic and ileal processes, the Schilling test can also be used to assess the integrity of these other organs. Dietary vitamin B 12 is bound in the stomach to an endogenous protein called R protein. Pancreatic enzymes degrade the R protein in the proximal small bowel and lower its affinity for vitamin B12 resulting in the rapid transfer of B 12 to IF; The IF-B12 Complex continues to the terminal ileum, where it binds to specific receptors on the surface of the epithelial cells. Thus lack of intrinsic factor, lack of sufficient pancreatic enzymes (pancreatic exocrine dysfunction) or presence of terminal heal mucosal disease may all result in abnormal vitamin B12 excretion.",

Mentzer index The Mentzer index is used to help in differentiating iron deficiency anemia from beta thalassemia. The index is calculated as the quotient of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV, in fL) divided by the red blood cell count (RBC, in millions per microleter). If the Mentzer index is less than 13, thallassemia is said to be more likely. If the Mentzer Index is greater than 13, Then iron-deficiency anemia is said to be more likely. Principle In iron deficiency, the marrow cannot produce as many RBCs and they are small (imcrocytic), so the RBC count and the MCV will both be low, and as a result, the index will be greater than 13. Conversely, in thalassemia, which is a disorder of globin synthesis, the number of RBCs produced is normal, but the cells are smaller and more fragile. Therefore, the RBC count is normal, but the MCV is low, so the index will be less than 13. In practice, the Mentzer index is not a reliable indicator and should not, by itself be used to differentiate the two conditions. Index Formula Value for iron deficiency anemia Value for iron thalassemia Mentzer index MC V/RBC count > 13 < 13 Shine and Lal index MCV2 x MCH x 0. 01 > 1530 < 1530 England and Fraser index MCV - RBC - (5 x Hb) 5. 19 > 0 < 0 Srivastava index MCH/RBC > 3. 8 < 3. 8 Green and king index MCV2 x RDW x Hb/100 > 65 < 65 Red cell distribution width index MCV x RDW/RBC > 220 < 220",

Pulse deficit refers to the difference between the radial pulse rate and the heart rate counted by auscultation (Apical Ventricular Rate). Pulse deficit is produced when ventricular contractions are preceded by sho diastoles such that poor ventricular filling results in insufficient stroke volume to transmit the pressure wave out to the radial pulse. The radial pulse rate is always lower than the ventricular pulse rate. The most common cause of pulse deficit is atrial fibrillation and pulse deficit has traditionally been believed to be a classical bedside sign for diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Pulse deficit may however be produced by any tachyarrhythrnia (fast heart rate) or Extra-systoles (Premature Ventricular Contractions). Multifocal Premature atrial contractions (PAC) may also produce small pulse deficits. Typically Pulse deficits generated by Multifocal PVC or PAC are small (<10/min) while those generated by Atrial Fibrillation are larger (>10). Pulse deficits of more than 10 per minute are frequent in Atrial Fibrillation with a fast heart rate.

        "exp": "Sudden, painless monocular blindness is a sign of carotid disease. The symptom is also called amaurosis fugax. The patient may describe a shade dropping in front of the eye or describe vision like looking through ground glass. If a thrombus propagates up the carotid to the middle cerebral aery, then symptoms seen in middle cerebral aery occlusion or embolization (hemiparesis with sensory symptoms, aphasia depending on hemispheric dominance) will also occur. Midbasilar aery disease produces weakness and sensory loss with diplopia, loss of facial sensation or movement, and ataxia. Branches of the basilar aery supply the base of the pons and superior cerebellum. The symptoms described suggest disease in the posterior circulation, whichincludes paired veebral aeries, the basilar aery, and the paired posterior cerebral aeries. The basilar aery divides into two posterior cerebral aeries that provide branches to the cerebellum, medulla, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and temporal and occipital lobes. A midbasilar aery occlusion could cause ataxia of limbs by involving pontine nuclei; paralysis of the face, arm, and leg by involving coicospinal tracts; and impairment of facial sensation by involvement of fifth nerve nucleus. Occlusion of the entire middle cerebral aery results in contralateral hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, and homonymous hemianopsia. When the dominant hemisphere is involved, aphasia is present. When the nondominant hemisphere is involved, apraxia and neglect are produced. When only a penetrating branch of the middle cerebral aery is affected, the syndrome of pure motor hemiplegia is produced, as the infarct involves only the posterior limb of the internal capsule, involving only motor fibers to the face, arm, and leg (lacunar infarct).",

The primary Pharmacological agents included in the ACLS Algorithm for management of cardiac arrest include Epinephrine, Vasopressin and Amiodarone. The primary goal of pharmacologic therapy is to assist the achievement and maintenance of spontaneous circulation. The mainstay of pharmacologic interventions is vasopressor agents. Epinephrine ( I mg) is recommended by IV or the intraosseous (10) route every 3 to 5 minutes during resuscitative effos until spontaneous circulation is restored. If IV/10 access cannot be established, epinephrine can be administered an endotracheal tube at a higher dose (2 to 2. 5mg). Vasopressin (40 mg iv/I0) could be substituted for the first or second dose of epinephrine if desired. The preferred antiarrhythmic agent for resuscitation is Amiodarone. Amiodarone is recommended in patients with VF/VT that does not respond to CPR, defibrillation, and vasopressor therapy. (first dose; 300mg 1V/I0; second dose; 150mg IV/10). It should be noted that The use of atropine far PEA/Asystole was recently removed from the ACLS algorithm. Evidence is insufficient to recommend routine administration of sodium bicarbonate during resuscitation. First dose; 300 mg bolus second dose; 150 mg Lidocaine is not pa of the ACLS 2010 Algorithm but may be used. The AHA recommends its administration after epinephrine; vasopressin and Amiodarone have been tried. But in clinical studies Lidocaine has not been demonstrated to improve rates of ROSC and hospital admission compared with Amiodarone. It is given in a bolus of ling/kg. A second loading dose of I mg/kg can be given in 10-15 minutes alter the first one.

        "exp": "Choice of glucocorticoid in patient with acute adrenal insufficiency In a patient without a previous diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. - Dexamethasone 4 mg i. v. is preferred because in contrast to hydrocortisone it is not measured in serum cortisol assays so it does not interfere with the measurement. For patients with known diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. - Dexamethasone, i. v. hydrocortisone or any intravenous glucocorticoid preparation may be used. This can rapidly decrease the inappropriate vasopressin production with increased clearance of free water and correction of hyponatremia. In contrast to glucocorticoid replacement, mineralocorticoid replacement is not necessary acutely because it takes several days for its sodium retaining effects to appear and adequate sodium replacement can be achieved by intravenous saline alone. However in patients with known primary adrenal insufficiency with potassium > 6. 0 meq./L hydrocortisone is preferred because of its mineralocorticoid activity. Treatment of acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal crisis) in adults Emergency measures Establish intravenous access with a large-gauge needle. Draw blood for immediate serum electrolytes and glucose and routine measurement of plasma cortisol and ACTH. Do not wait for lab results. Infuse 2 to 3 liters of isotonic saline or 5 percent dextrose in isotonic saline as quickly as possible. Frequent hemodynamic monitoring and measurement of serum electrolytes should be performed to avoid iatrogenic fluid overload. Give 4 mg dexamethasone as intravenous bolus over one to five minutes and every 12 hours thereafter. Dexamethasone is the drug of choice because it does not interfere with the measurement of plasma cortisol. If dexamethasone is unavailable, intravenous hydrocortisone, 100 mg immediately and every six hours thereafter, may be used. Use supportive measures as needed. Subacute measures after stabilization of the patient Continue intravenous isotonic saline at a slower rate for next 24 to 48 hours. Search for and treat possible infections precipitating causes of the adrenal crisis. Perform short ACTH stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, if patient does not have know adrenal insufficiency. Determine the type of adrenal insufficiency and its cause if not already known. Taper parenteral glucocorticoid over one to three days, if precipitating or complicating illness permits, to oral glucocorticoid maintenance dose. Begin meneralocorticoid replacement with fludrocortisone, 0. 1 mg by mouth daily, when saline infusion is stopped. Pheochromocytoma",
