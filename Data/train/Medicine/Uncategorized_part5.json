        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Antigravity muscles are spared The following clinical features characterize a UMN lesion: Increased tone (spasticitv) Initially, UMN weakness may be flaccid, with absent or diminished deep tendon reflexes. There is little understanding of the reasons behind this initial flaccidity and it is often referred to as 'shock'. Increased tone of a UMN type is called spasticity. It may develop several hours, days or even weeks after the initial lesion has occurred. Spasticity is manifested by: Spastic catch': Mild spasticity may be detected as a resistance to passive movement or 'catch' in the pronators on passive supination of the forearm and in the flexors of the hand/forearm on extension of the wrist/elbow. The 'clasp-knife' phenomenon: In more severe lesions, following strong resistance to passive flexion of the knee or extension of the elbow, there is a sudden relaxation of the extensor muscles of the leg and flexor muscles in the arm. Clonus: Rhythmic involuntary muscular contractions follow an abruptly applied and sustained stretch stimulus, e. g. at the ankle following sudden passive dorsiflexion of the foot. `Pyramidal-pattern' weakness The antigravity muscles are preferentially spared and stronger The flexors of the upper limbs and the extensors of the lower limbs. The patient can develop a characteristic posture of flexed and pronated arms with clenched fingers, and extended and adducted legs with plantar flexion of the feet. In upper extremiteis Relative sparing of the flexors More involvement of the extensor In lower extremities Predominant invovlement of the flexors with Relative sparing of the extensor or Absence of muscle wasting and fasciculations Focal muscle wasting andjasciculations are features of an LMN lesion. With chronic disuse, some loss of muscle bulk can occur after a UMN lesion, but this is rarely severe or focal. Brisk tendon reflexes and extensor plantar responses The tendon reflexes are brisk. The cremasteric and abdominal or 'cutaneous' reflexes are depressed or absent. The plantar responses are extensor (upgoing toes' or 'positive' babinski sign). Anti-gravity muscles are typically spared in pyramidal tract lesions. Weakness, in pyramidal tract lesions is often termed as 'pyramidal' in distribution affecting extensors more than flexors in the upper limb, and flexors more than extensors in the lower limb (Anti-gravity muscles are spared). Pyramidal weakness - Loss of power most marked in the extensors muscles in the arms and flexors in the legs Proximal weakness - Shoulders, hips, trunks, neck and sometimes face. Associated with myopathy. Distal weakness - Affects hands and feets. Associated with peripheral motor neuropathy. Global weakness - Generalized weakness in limbs which may result from severe pathologies.",

Overproduction of bilirubin? Impaired uptake, conjugation, or excretion of bilirubin?

In obstructive jaundice there is a greater elevation of the alkaline phosphatase along with direct hyperbilirubinemia. Viral hepatitis and and drug induced hepatitis also causes cholestatic jaundice but does not increase alkaline phosphatase too much. Hemolytic jaundice causes indirect hyperbilirubinemia.

Advantages in adults and children have included the identification of other causes for the clinical presentation when pulmonary embolism is not present. Thrombi within the pulmonary vessels can be demonstrated. It is considered to be more cost-effective because fewer indeterminate and nondiagnostic studies are needed.

BNP has scored over others in prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic values and has also a found place in the guidelines for the diagnosis of congestive heart failure. Assays of BNP are commercially available and used clinically for screening and diagnosis of heart failure, to predict severity of condition and estimate prognosis. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a neuro-hormone released from ventricular myocytes in response to myocytes stress. It is released as a pro-hormone and cleaved into N-terminal (NT) pro-BNP and BNP. It causes vasodilation, diuresis, and natriuresis and decreases activity of Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) and Renin-angiotensin. Aldosterone System (RAAS). Both BNP and NT-pro-BNP have prognostic value in heart failure. Those with higher values on admission do worse and those whose values decrease after treatment fare better. Out of BNP and NT-pro -BNP, NT-pro-BNP is superior to BNP in predicting hospitalisation and death in heart failure. BNP /NT-pro-BNP Assays: It helps in screening patients at risk of development of heart failure (Diabetics and asymptomatic coronary aery disease) It helps in deciding whether heart failure is the cause of dyspnoea in the emergency depament (A very low BNP or NT-pro-BNP helps exclude a cardiac cause of dyspnoea) It has prognostic value in heart failure (Those with higher values on admission do worse and those whose values decrease after treatment fare better) Out of BNP and NT-pro-BNP, NT-pro-BNP is superior to BNP in predicting hospitalisation and death in heart failure.

After the first 6 months, risk of infection is similar to the general population. CMV is the most common viral infection, occurring most commonly between the first and fouh post-transplant months. CMV is a herpes virus and infects between 25 and 85% of all liver transplant patients. CMV infection is rarely fatal. The viral infection may be primary or reactivated. Patients often present with fevers, malaise, ahralgias, atypical lymphocytes, thrombocytopenia, and mildly elevated transaminases levels. CMV pneumonitis often results in radiographic findings of bilateral infiltrates. Diagnosis is made serologically using an indirect immunofluorescence testing method. Treatment is effective when a diagnosis is made early and ganciclovir is beneficial. Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia may present with CMV infection or alone. Diagnosis sometimes requires a bronchoalveolar biopsy. Transplant recipients may be placed on long-term pneumocystic suppression therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.",

Preload: Is defined as the previous stretching of ventricular myocardial fibrils just about to begin a new systole. It is equal to the ventricular wall stress at end-diastole. In clinical practice, ventricular volumes appear to most closely approximate muscle fiber length. Afterload: Is the impedance that the ventricles are submitted at the onset of contraction. Impedance is considered to be the sum of extracardiac forces present in the systemic circulation opposing ventricular ejection and pulsating flow. Clinically, it is assumed to be the systemic vascular resistance, if there is no obstruction between the LV and aoa. Contractility: This is an intrinsic propey of the cardiac cell. It defines the work that the heart can perform at a given load. Contractility is primarily determined by the availability of intracellular calcium. Heart rate: Tachycardia reduces diastole period and consequently, the subendocardial blood flow, thereby reducing myocardial oxygen supply.",

The major indication for carotid sinus massage is the diagnosis of tachyarrhythmias in which the atrial activity is either absent or intermittently present. Carotid sinus massage is also useful in altering conduction within the AV node. Vagal stimulation, such as occurs with the Vasalva maneuver or carotid sinus massage can slow conduction in the AV Node sufficiently to terminate AVN/ PSVT (aerioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia). It is also helpful in some patients with normal heart rates; increased vagal tone may normalize a bundle branch block or localize the site of type I second-degree atrioventricular block and can be used for evaluation of the sensing function of permanent pacemakers. Carotid sinus massage is also an impoant diagnostic procedure in patients with suspected hypersensitivity of the carotid sinus. Massage of the carotid sinus is contraindicated in patients with diseased carotid aeries because of the risk of cerebrovascular accident. In rare instances, carotid sinus massage may initiate ventricular tachycardia.",

It is usually rapidly metabolised by the liver. Rapid administration of large quantities of stored blood may cause hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia when citrate binds calcium and magnesium. This can result in myocardial depression or coagulopathy. Patients most at risk are those with liver dysfunction or neonates with immature liver function having rapid large volume transfusion. Potassium Effects: Stored red cells leak potassium propoionately throughout their storage life. Irradiation of red cells increases the rate of potassium leakage. Clinically significant hyperkalaemia can occur during rapid, large volume transfusion of older red cell units in small infants and children Iron accumulation: Iron accumulation is a predictable consequence of chronic RBC transfusion. Organ toxicity begins when reticuloendothelial sites of iron storage become saturated. Liver and endocrine dysfunction creates significant morbidity and the most serious complication is cardiotoxicity which causes arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure.",

MR typically occurs 7-10 days after an AMI, though this onset may vary according to the mechanism of MR. Papillary muscle rupture resulting in MR occurs within 1-14 days. Mild-to-moderate MR is often clinically silent and detected on doppler echocardiography performed during the early phase of AMI. In this case, MR rarely causes hemodynamic compromise. Severe acute MR that results from the rupture of papillary muscles or chordae tendineae results in abrupt hemodynamic deterioration with cardiogenic shock. Rapid diagnosis, hemodynamic stabilization, and prompt surgical intervention are needed because acute severe MR is associated with a high moality rate.",

However, MOPP may be used if there are lung or heart conditions present or allergies to any of the medications in the ABVD combination. Additionally, 30% to 40% of people will relapse after treatment with ABVD, which will require 'salvage' treatment with MOPP.

Pulse deficit refers to the difference between the radial pulse rate and the heart rate counted by auscultation (Apical Ventricular Rate). Pulse deficit is produced when ventricular contractions are preceded by sho diastoles such that poor ventricular filling results in insufficient stroke volume to transmit the pressure wave out to the radial pulse. The radial pulse rate is always lower than the ventricular pulse rate. The most common cause ofpulse deficit is atrial fibrillationand pulse deficit has traditionally been believed to be a classical bedside sign for diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Pulse deficit may however be produced by any tachyarrhythmia (fast heart rate) or Extra-systoles (Premature Ventricular Contractions).

Timing of gonadectomy is controversial. Some clinicians advocate early i. e. childhood gonadectomy due to the malignant potential with subsequent HRT to induce puberty. Others prefer to delay gonadectomy until after puberty to allow endogenous gonadal hormones to work throughout puberty. Hormone replacement therapy is essential after gonadectomy for many aspects of health and well being. One of these is the maintenance of bone mineral density.

The observation that patients with Noonan syndrome have normal karyotypes was important in allowing the distinction to be made between the Turner and Noonan syndromes. Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of Noonan syndrome is not fully understood. A disease-causing gene, PTPN11, has been identified. The gene product, SHP2, plays an important role in cardiac semilunar valve development. Sex: Noonan syndrome occurs in either a sporadic or autosomal dominant fashion. In either case, males and females are affected equally. Age: The disorder is present from birth, but age impacts upon the facial phenotype Infants with Noonan syndrome can be difficult to recognize by facial appearance alone. The phenotype becomes more striking in early childhood, but with advancing age, it may again become quite subtle. Careful examination of an affected child's parents may, in fact, reveal that they are affected mildly. Clinical features - Growth parameters Size at birth is usually within the reference range. Short stature is present in up to 80% of patients. Average adult height for males is 5'55\" and for females is 5'.

        "question": "The mother of a child with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is very worried about whether her child will develop serious bleeding. When reassuring this mother, it might be helpful if the physician informs her that the threshold for generalized bleeding is about how many platelets/mm3?",
        "exp": "Normal platelet counts are in the 150, 000-450, 000/mm3 range. It is useful to know that peripheral blood platelet counts less than about 15, 000-20, 000/mm3 are required before generalized bleeding usually occurs. Few physicians choose to actively treat patients who are not currently bleeding and whose platelet counts are greater than 100, 000/mm3. Clearly, patients with counts less than 15, 000/mm3 probably require active therapy, possibly with platelet transfusions. However, there is more disagreement about how to handle patients with counts in the 20, 000-50, 000/mm3 range, and you may encounter some physicians who will attempt to transfuse these patients. (However, this practice is no longer recommended by the American Blood Bank Association unless the patients is actively bleeding.) Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is due to an autoimmune attack on the platelets, leading to their clearing by the spleen. Splenectomy may be helpful in refractory cases. A count of 5, 000 platelets/mm3 dangerously low, and platelet transfusion should have been considered earlier. Some physicians will give platelet transfusions for actively bleeding patients with counts of 50, 000/mm3. Platelet counts of 100, 000/mm3 do not usually require platelet transfusion, even when bleeding. Ref: Diz-Kucukkaya R., Chen J., Geddis A., Lopez J. A. (2010). Chapter 119. Thrombocytopenia. In J. T.

Resetting a pheochromocytoma is a high-risk surgical procedure and an experienced surgeon/anesthesiologist team is required. Some form of preoperative pharmacologic preparation is indicated for all patients with catecholamine-secreting neoplasms. Preoperative medical therapy is aimed at: Controlling hypertension (including preventing a hypeensive crisis during surgery) o Volume expansion In patients with undiagnosed pheochromocytomas who undergo surgery for other reasons (and who therefore have not undergone preoperative medical therapy), surgical moality rates are high due to lethal hypeensive crises, malignant arrhythmias, and multiorgan failure. Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade is the most common approach to control blood pressure and prevent intraoperative hypeensive crises. Alpha-adrenergic blockade An alpha-adrenergic blocker is given 10 to 14 days preoperatively to normalize blood pressure and expand the contracted blood volume. Phenoxybenzamine is the preferred drug for preoperative preparation to control blood pressure and arrhythmia in most centers in the United States. It is an irreversible, long-acting, nonspecific alpha-adrenergic blocking agent. The initial dose is 10 mg once or twice daily, and the dose is increased by 10 to 20 mg in divided doses every two to three days as needed to control blood pressure and spells. The final dose of phenoxybenzamine is typically between 20 and 100 mg daily. Beta-adrenergic blockade After adequate alpha-adrenergic blockade has been achieved, beta-adrenergic blockade is initiated, which typically occurs two to three days preoperatively. The beta-adrenergic blocker should never be staed first because blockade of vasodilatory peripheral betaadrenergic receptors with unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation can lead to a fuher elevation in blood pressure. The alternatives to a and 13 adrenergic agents are calcium channel blockers and metyrosine. Calcium channel blockers Although perioperative alpha-adrenergic blockade is widely recommended, a second regimen that has been utilized involves the administration of a calcium channel blocker. Nicardipine is the most commonly used calcium channel blocker in this setting; the staing dose is 30 mg twice daily of the sustained release preparation. Metyrosine Another approach involves the administration of metyrosine (alpha-methyl Para-tyrosine), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis.",

This test is most often performed as a screening test for kidney disease. Normally, protein is not appears in urine when a routine dipstick test is performed. Normal values for a random urine sample are approximately 0 to 8 mg/ dL. If higher may be due to diabetic nephropathy. Microalbuminuria test measures for small quantities of protein commonly albumin in the urine sample. The amount of water in urine can vary and affect the concentration of albumin. Thus amount of creatinine is also measured and the result is repoed as the ratio of albumin to creatinine. This test is earliest sensitive test to diagnose diabetic nephropathy as albuminuria is the earliest manifestation of diabetic nephropathy. Abnormal levels of the protein (mostly albumin) in the urine signal the beginning of a condition called microalbuminuria, often noted in diabetic nephropathy. 30 to 300 mgs of albumin in 2 different 24 hour urine samples is diagnosed as microalbuminuria. More than 300 mgs of albumin is diagnosed as albuminuria. BUN (Blood urea nitrogen), Urea nitrogen is formed when protein are breaks down. The normal value will be in the range of 7 - 20 mg/ dl. Higher than normal level may be an indication for kidney disease. Serum creatinine test measures creatinine level in blood. Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine, an impoant pa of muscle. This test is done to examine kidney function. If kidney function is abnormal, blood has increased level of creatinine, due to decreased excretion of creatinine in the urine. Creatinine levels will vary depends on the person's size and muscle mass. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), which is the best way to find how well the kidney functions. GFR can be calculated from the blood creatinine, age, race, gender and other factors. GFR value is helpful to determine the stage of kidney disease and helps to plan fuher treatment. Ultrasound or CT scan is helpful to find any physical structural abnormalities, that is the kidney is larger or smaller than normal. Kidney biopsy",

        "exp": "The clinical features in this patient are diagnostic of Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is an Autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation in the ATP7B gene. ATP7B protein deficiency impairs biliary copper excretion, resulting in positive copper balance, hepatic copper accumulation, and copper toxicity from oxidant damage. Clinical presentation can be hepatic, neurologic and psychiatric. Hepatic involvement results in hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatic decompensation. Neurologic involvement result in dystonia, incoordination and tremor. Psychiatric manifestations include behavioral disturbances, depression, hyperactivity or loss of sexual inhibition. Investigations show low ceruloplasmin, increased free copper levels and KF rings. The gold standard for diagnosis is liver biopsy with quantitative copper assays.

Severe intravascular hemolysis may lead to a similar syndrome. Hyperphosphatemia alters calcium and phosphate ion solubility products, and calcium deposition in soft tissue may occur. The lower circulating concentrations of 1, 25 (OH)2D may fuher aggravate the hypocalcemia by impairing intestinal absorption of calcium. Hyperphosphatemic-induced hypocalcemia inhibits vitamin D synthesis and results in an increase in PTH secretion. Secondary hyperparathyroidism from long-term hyperphosphatemia is usually associated with renal insufficiency. Treatment should be directed towards the hyperphosphatemia in order to correct the hypocalcemia. Hypophosphatemia is more severe than hypocalcemia in vitamin D deficiency states because of the increased secretion of PTH, which is only paly active in elevating blood calcium but is capable of phosphaturia.",

Note Pneumocystic Pneumonia in Adults In adults the disease appears to be predominantly alveolar Air spaces (alveoli) are filled with a foamy, eosinophilic exudate and appear honey coombed The intra-alveolar exudate consists of organisms, surface glycoprotein exudate and debri of macrophages and inflammatory cells. Pneumocystis Pneumonia in molnourished infants In infants the disease has a predominant interstitial component The interstitium is filled with fluid plasma cells and lymphocytes. These formed elements seem to overflow into air spaces which are filled with a frothy eosinophilic exudates. Pneumocystic pneumonia is one of the most common AIDS - defining oppounistic infections and should be considered in any patient presenting with atypical pneumonia who is at increased risk of acquiring HIV (eg Professional sex workers, Homosexuals men, Intravenous drug users and Long distance Truck drivers in India) Presentation of patient is consistant with diagnosis of Pneumocystic Pneumonia Pneumocystis carinii is an impoant cause of Atypical Pneumonia in immunocompromised states especially AIDS Pneumocystic Pneumonia is recognized as one of the most common AIDS defining oppostunistic infections. `A diagnosis of Pneumocystic pneumonia should be considered in any patient presenting with sings / symptoms of Atypical Pneumonia in a patient who is at increased risk of acquiring HIV infection' Long Distance Truck Drivers in India are considered a high risk population for contracting the HIV virus (Nag, 1996) Charachteristic clinical manifestations include significant weight loss, fever, non productive cough and dysponea Clinical Manifestations (Textbook of Pulmonary Medicine' by Behera 2\"d/413) Profound weight loss 100%) Fever 97%) Dyspnea ( 63%) Non Productive cough 75%) The most charachteristic finding an chest X-Ray is bilateral diffuse infiltrates beginning in the perihilar region although various atypical manifestations including nodular lesions, cavitatory lesions etc have also been repoed The classic finding on chest radiography consists of bilateral diffuse infiltrates beginning in the perihilar region However no radiographic pattern is pathognomic for pneumocystic pneumonia. Tuberculosis is unlikely as it usually present with productive cough and the patient in question has a non productive dry cough. Also, bilateral diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates are not charachteristic of Tuberculosis. Interstitial Luna Diseases is unlikely as these disorders usually do not present with fever and weight loss, although bilateral reticulonodular infiltrates may be seen on chest x-Ray. 'With most interstitial lung diseases, constitutional symptoms like fevers, chills and weight loss are absent'- Fishman's Pulmonary Diseases Note: Patients with Acute Interstitial Pneumonias (Type of ILD) may present with the a similar clinical and radiological picture, but these disorders constitute only a small fraction of Interstitial Lung Diseases (< 1%).
