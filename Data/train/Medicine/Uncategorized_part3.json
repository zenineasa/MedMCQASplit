Triclosan is an antibacterial and antifungal agent found in mumerous consumer products, including soaps, detergents, toys and surgical cleaning treatments. Its efficacy as an antimicrobial agent and the risk of antibacterial rasistance ramains controversial. Tests used for fat malabsorption Triolene breath test 13C triolene breath test is a simple and reproducible method to measure fat malabsorption. o It is a non invasive test and it does not require the use of radioactive isotopes. The 14C triolene breath test is sensitive and specific for measuring fat malabsorption but involve radiation exposure. 13C triolene is simple and effective that does not involve the use of radioactive isotopes. The substrate for this breath test is glycerol, esterified in three positions with the unsaturated 18: 1 n-1 oleic acid. The absorption of triolene is dependent on efficient lipolysis, sufficient intraluminal bile salt concentration and intact intestinal mucosa. A low 13C breath excretion represents probable contribution of all these factors. The Tripalmitin breath test:? The substrate is glycerol esterified with 16: 0 fatty acid palmitic acid. The oxidation of CO2 is determined by hydrolysis, bile salt concentration and absorption through intestine. C Mixed-Triglyceride Breath Test The \"C mixed-triglyceride (MTG) breath test is a noninvasive test with which to measure lipase activity. The test molecule, 1, 3 distearyl, 2 (carboxyl-\"C) octanoyl glycerol, consists of a medium-chain fatty acid octanoic acid marked with \"C in the 2-position and the long-chain fatty acid 18: 0 in the 1- and 3-position. The rationale of the test is that the two stearyl groups have to be split off the glycerol by lipase before \"C octanoyl monoglyceride or 13C octanoate, a medium-chain fatty acid, is absorbed and rapidly metabolized to \"CO2, which appears in breath. The rate-limiting step in the oxidation of '3. CO2is the hydrolysis of the fatty acids in the 1- and 3-positions of the mixed triglyceride. The amount of '3. CO2 that appears in breath is an indicator of lipase activity. After an overnight fast, two basal breath samples are taken. The test meal, a slice of white bread with chocolate paste (containing 250 mg 13C MTG), is ingested. After the meal, breath samples are collected at 30-min intervals for a period of 6h. LIC-Trioctanoin Breath Test The substrate for the trioctanoin breath test is glycerol, esterified with the 8: 0 medium-chain fatty acid, octanoic acid. Because the absorption of MCT is independent of bile salts and occurs immediately after hydrolysis by pancreatic lipase, absorption can be limited only by insufficient lipolysis. This test allows discrimination between patients with pancreatic insufficiency and patients with bile acid deficiency or mucosal abnormalities.",

The annual incidence of this idiopathic disorder is ~25 per 100, 000 annually, or about 1 in 60 persons in a lifetime. Risk factors include pregnancy and diabetes mellitus. Clinical Manifestations The onset of Bell's palsy is fairly abrupt, with maximal weakness being attained by 48 hrs as a general rule. Pain behind the ear may precede the paralysis for a day or two. Taste sensation may be lost unilaterally, and hyperacusis may be present. In some cases, there is mild cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal swelling and uniform enhancement of the geniculate ganglion and facial nerve and, in some cases, entrapment of the swollen nerve in the temporal bone. Approximately 80% of patients recover within a few weeks or months. Electromyography may be of some prognostic value; evidence of denervation after 10 days indicates there has been axonal degeneration, that there will be a long delay (3 months as a rule) before regeneration occurs, and that it may be incomplete. The presence of incomplete paralysis in the first week is the most favorable prognostic sign. Recurrences are reported in approximately 7% of cases.

        "exp": "Elevated LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol are independent predictors of coronary heart disease. Although there is consensus regarding the benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol the value of elevating HDL cholesterol remains controversial. Low HDL and coronary risk High serum HDL cholesterol is associated with a lower risk of CHD. The incidence of CHD events in a normal population appears to be inversely related to serum HDL cholesterol with low levels being associated with increased coronary risk. Based upon data from the Framingham Heart study, the risk for myocardial infarction increases by about 2 5% for every 5mg/dl (. 13 mmol/l) decrement in serum HDL cholesterol. Elevated LDL and coronary risk Elevation in LDL cholesterol is a well-known risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease. Association of elevated LDL with coronary artery disease has been established in various trials and studies. There is linear reduction in cardiovascular disease with progressive lowering of the LDL cholesterol. Traditionally LDL levels are considered to be the most important factor in the prediction of coronary artery disease. The importance of LDL as a risk factor lies in the fact that effective therapies are available to lower it, while it is not so in the case of HDL. So when treating dyslipidemia for reducing cardiovascular events, the first target is LDL and not HDL. Doubt and Controversy What is creating doubts in our mind is a table from Braunwald 8th/e p1008 according to which \u2018Low HDL' appears to be better marker for prediction of future cardiovascular disease than \u2018High LDL' According to this bar diagram in Braunnwald 8th/e pl008 - the adjusted hazard ratio for future cardiovascular events for LDL is 1. 62 while that of HDL is 2. 32. But the text given in the book does clarify which one is better marker, (we have given this table from Braunwald in our previous discussion on this topic in Nov 2009 Medicine). We have tried to confirm this \u2018Low HDL' fact from various other books. But none of the texts clearly favored any one between these 2 to be the better marker. Both LDL and HDL are mentioned to be important. We have also consulted several cardiologist on this. All of them say that the answer should be LDL. Well, Braunwald is text book of immense reputation, and any information or text given in the book does not need confirmation from any other source. But what has added to the confusion is that the latest edition of Braunwald i. e., 9th/e has eliminated that diagram from the book and in the text have not clarified which one is better marker. Instead, the text states that Apolipo (a) and B 100 are better marker for predicting future cardiovascular events than LDL and HDL. We are not absolutely sure of the answer, but we would for the time being go with LDL. Also Know The following lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities are associated with increased coronary risk. Elevated total cholesterol Elevated LDL cholesterol Low HDL cholesterol Increased total to HDL cholesterol ratio Increased non HDL cholesterol Hypertriglyceridemia Increased Lp(a) Increased apolipoprotein B Small dense LDL particles",

B: Increased RBC surface area It's the only condition presenting with Increased MCHC Spherocytosis is caused by a molecular defect in one or more of the proteins of the red blood cell cytoskeleton, including, spectrin, ankyrin so blood cell contracts to its most surface-tension efficient and least flexible configuration, a sphere( spherocytes). They have a high osmotic fragility and are more prone to physical degradation. They are most commonly found in immunologically-mediated hemolytic anemias and in hereditary spherocytosis, but the former would have a positive direct Coombs test and the latter would not. The misshapen but otherwise healthy red blood cells are mistaken by the spleen for old or damaged red blood cells and it thus constantly breaks them down, causing a cycle whereby the body destroys its own blood supply (auto-hemolysis). Chronic symptoms include anemia and splenomegaly. As a result of the broken-down blood cells -- bilirubin -- accumulates in the gallbladder and can cause pigmented gallstones to develop. In peripheral blood smears, red blood cells will appear abnormally small. The CBC will show elevated MCHC. The bone marrow in its role of manufacturing red blood cells will display hyperplasia, the increased activity of replacing RBCs. As a result, immature red blood cell or reticulocyte counts will appear elevated.",

If a thrombus propagates up the carotid to the middle cerebral aery, then symptoms seen in middle cerebral aery occlusion or embolization (hemiparesis with sensory symptoms, aphasia depending on hemispheric dominance) will also occur. Midbasilar aery disease produces weakness and sensory loss with diplopia, loss of facial sensation or movement, and ataxia. Branches of the basilar aery supply the base of the pons and superior cerebellum. The symptoms described suggest disease in the posterior circulation, whichincludes paired veebral aeries, the basilar aery, and the paired posterior cerebral aeries. The basilar aery divides into two posterior cerebral aeries that provide branches to the cerebellum, medulla, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and temporal and occipital lobes. A midbasilar aery occlusion could cause ataxia of limbs by involving pontine nuclei; paralysis of the face, arm, and leg by involving coicospinal tracts; and impairment of facial sensation by involvement of fifth nerve nucleus. Occlusion of the entire middle cerebral aery results in contralateral hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, and homonymous hemianopsia. When the dominant hemisphere is involved, aphasia is present. When the nondominant hemisphere is involved, apraxia and neglect are produced. When only a penetrating branch of the middle cerebral aery is affected, the syndrome of pure motor hemiplegia is produced, as the infarct involves only the posterior limb of the internal capsule, involving only motor fibers to the face, arm, and leg (lacunar infarct).",

        "exp": "Answer is C (Nifedipine): Presence of accelerated hypertension with blood pressures in excess of 200/100 mm Hg in a patient with high thoracic spinal cord injury (above T6) suggests a diagnosis of Autonomic Dysreflexia. Urgent management of the hypeensive crisis is paramount to prevent complications such as retinal haemorrhage, seizures, hypeensive encephalopathy or an intracerebral haemorrhage. Oral Clonidine and/or Nifedipine are the most commonly used pharmacological agents to control hypeensive crisis in patients with autonomic dysreflexia Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) (Hypeensive Crisis following Spinal Cord injury above T6) What is Autonomic Dysreflexia Autonomic Dysretlexia (AD) is a syndrome of sympathetic overactivity that typically affects patient with spinal cord injury above or proximal to the upper thoracic level (T6 or above) due to unopposed sympathetic nervous system impulses. This is an acute medical emergency that occurs in patients whose spinal cord injury lies above the greater splanchnic outflow from thoracolumbar preganglionic sympathetic neurons (T6 or above). This results from interruption of normal feedback mechanism in the sympathetic pathway. Patients with spinal cord injury below T8 are rarely affected by this condition. When does Autonomic Dysreflexia occur Autonomic Dysreflexia is traditionally/historically believed to occur 4-6 months after the spinal cord injury (After the phase of spinal shock resolves) However recently AD has also been repoed in early phases after SCI How does Autonomic Dysreflexia Present The most characteristic presentation of AD is sudden increase in Blood Pressure (Accelerated Hypertension) often in excess 200mm Hg systolic and 100 mm Hg diastolic. It is impoant to note that normal resting Blood Pressure in patients with spinal cord injury is often 80 to 90 mm. Hg, and a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Kg may he an early sign of autonomic dysreflexia Bradvcardia in association with hypertension is another typical feature of AD and this results primarily from vagal compensation. Bradvcardia is however present in only 50% of the cases. What are the Triggering factors for AD Autonomic Dysreflexia can be triggered by any painful/noxious stimulus in the clermatomes (skin), muscles or viscera below the level of cord injury. Bladder Distension is the single most common inciting stimuli Trigger Stimuli / Inciting stimuli for AD * Distension of Bladder (Due to obstructed urine outflow from spasm/kinked Foley's catheter) * Bowel impaction (Constipation) * Irritation from skin lesions (Dermatomes) Insect bites, pressure sores, constrictive clothing, localized wounds or ingrowing toe nails * Labour and pregnancy * Gynecological instrumentation and/or patients with SCI undergoing surgery What is the treatment of AD Treatment of Autonomic Dysreflexia Prevention of Trigger Factors Prevention of Trigger Factors Avoid Bladder Distension (leading cause) (prompt catheterization) Avoid Fecal Impaction (Second leading cause) (Manual evacuation, anal sphincter block, bowel programs) Anti-cholinergic Medicines are recommended Management of Hypeensive crisis Management of Hypeensive crisis Patient should be brought in a sitting position with legs dangling to take advantage of natural ohostosis. Pharmacological management with oral/transdermal medicine should be initiated - Transdermal Nitroglycerine - Oral Clonidine - Oral Nifedipine - Oral Phenoxybenzamine - Oral Prazocin Pharmacological management with intravenous medicines may be considered in cases of hypeensive crises or encephalopathy or intraoperative hypertension - Nitroprusside - Diazoxide - Trimethaphan - Fenoldopam",

If the CSF is left to stand, a fine clot resembling a pellicle or cobweb may form.

Omalizumab is indicated for treatment of 'moderate to severe' persistent asthma in patients who react to perennial allergens (Allergic Asthma). Treatment with Omalizumab has shown to reduce the number of exacerbations in patients with severe asthma and may improve asthma control. However this treatment is very expensive and is only suitable for highly selected patients who are not controlled on maximal doses of inhaler therapy and have a high circulating IgE (within a specified range).

These frontiers were first notably explored with high-density microarrays containing spatially arrayed sequences from a phylogenetically diverse collection of viruses. Although biased toward those with homology to known viruses, novel viruses in clinical samples were successfully identified on the basis of their ability to hybridize to these prespecified sequences. This methodology famously contributed to identification of the corona virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Once discovered, this SARS corona-virus was rapidly sequenced: the full genome was assembled in April 2003, less than 6 months after recognition of the first case. This accomplishment illustrated the advancing power and speed of new diagnostic technologies. Harrisson Principle of Internal Medicine Ed 19th Pg772",

They are heard just after the first heart sound. The sounds occur in the presence of a dilated aoa or pulmonary aery or in the presence of a bicuspid or flexible stenotic aoic or pulmonary valve. The diastolic correlate of the ejection click is the opening snap, which occurs at maximal opening of a flexibly stenotic mitral or tricuspid valve. Non ejection clicks/ midsystolic clicks occurring with or without a late systolic murmur (crescendo-decrescendo), often denotes prolapse of one/both leaflets of the mitral valve. They are best heard along the lower left sternal border and at the left ventricular apex. ECG is normal commonly in MVP, but may show biphasic/ inveed T waves inleads II, III and a. VF.

Bronchial breath sounds The bronchial breath sound originates in the larger airways and are transmitted directly to the chest wall without passing through the alveoli. The sound passing through the lung tissue is not modified and auscultated like bronchial sounds from the chest walls. This sound resembles the sound obtained by listening over the trachea (directly placing a stethoscope on the trachea). The characteristics of these sounds are: Duration of expiration is equal to or longer than that of inspiration. Intensity of expiration is more than that of inspiration. There is a definite gap between inspiration and expiration. Sounds are harsh or aspirate in nature. They are high-pitched with frequencies above 600. Hz Bronchial Breath Sounds Bronchial breath sounds are of three types: tubular, cavernous, and amphoric. Tubular Bronchial Breath sound The tubular bronchial breath sound is a high pitched sound resulting from the passage of vibrations produced in the small bronchi directly to the chest wall through a solid lung tissue. This is seen when the lung parenchyma becomes a solid mass, as in consolidation. Cavernous Bonchial Breath sound The cavernous bronchial breath sounds is a low pitched bronchial breath sound heard over a cavity, which is situated superficially and communicated to a patent bronchus. The size of the cavity should be more than 2 cm in diameter to produce a cavernous breath sound. Amphoric Bronchial Breath sound The amphoric bronchial breath sounds is a high pitched bronchial sound that resembles the sound produced by blowing air into a wide-mouthed bottle.

' Milk-Alkali Syndrome The milk-alkali syndrome is due to excessive ingestion of calcium and absorbable antacids such as milk or calcium carbonateQ. It is much less frequent since proton-pump inhibitors and other treatments became available for peptic ulcer disease. For a time, the increased use of calcium carbonate in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism led to reappearance of the syndrome. Several clinical presentations-acute, subacute, and chronic-have been described, all of which feature hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal failureQ. The chronic form of the disease, termed Burnett's syndrome, is associated with irreversible renal damageQ. The acute syndromes reverse if the excess calcium and absorbable alkali are stoppedQ. Individual susceptibility is dependent on the fractional calcium absorption as a function of calcium intake. Some individuals absorb a high fraction of calcium, even with intakes >2 g of elemental calcium per day, instead of reducing calcium absorption with high intake, as occurs in most normal individuals. Development of hypercalcemia causes increased sodium excretion and some depletion of total-body water. These phenomena and perhaps some suppression of endogenous PTH secretion due to mild hypercalcemia lead to increased bicarbonate resorption and to alkalosis in the face of continued calcium carbonate ingestion Alkalosis per se selectively enhances calcium resorption in the distal nephron, thus aggravating the hypercalcemia. The cycle of mild hypercalcemia -4 bicarbonate retention alkalosis renal calcium retention -4 severe hypercalcemia perpetuates and aggravates hypercalcemia and alkalosis as long as calcium and absorbable alkali are ingestedQ.",

Poor diet, impaired absorption, storage and phosphorylation of thiamine in the liver, and the increased requirements for thiamine to metabolise ethanol all contribute. In the developing world, deficiency usually arises as a consequence of a diet based on polished rice. The body has very limited stores of thiamine, so deficiency manifest after only 1 month on a thiamine-free diet. There are two forms of the disease in adults: Dry (or neurological) beri-beri manifests with chronic peripheral neuropathy and with wrist and/or foot drop, and may cause Korsakoff's psychosis and Wernicke's encephalopathy. Wet (or cardiac) beri-beri causes generalised oedema, due to biventricular heart failure with pulmonary congestion. In dry beri-beri, response to thiamine administration is not uniformly good. Multivitamin therapy seems to produce some improvement, however, suggesting that other vitamin deficiencies may be involved. Wernicke's encephalopathy and wet beri-beri should be treated without delay with intravenous vitamin B and C mixture. Korsakoff's psychosis is irreversible and does not respond to thiamine treatment.

A diagnosis of Intrinsic factor deficiency can be established if radiolabelled cobalamine (Vitamin B12) appears in urine after administration of Intrinsic factor. Since cobalamine absorption requires multiple steps including gastric, pancreatic and ileal processes, the Schilling test can also be used to assess the integrity of these other organs. Dietary vitamin B 12 is bound in the stomach to an endogenous protein called R protein. Pancreatic enzymes degrade the R protein in the proximal small bowel and lower its affinity for vitamin B12 resulting in the rapid transfer of B 12 to IF; The IF-B12 Complex continues to the terminal ileum, where it binds to specific receptors on the surface of the epithelial cells. Thus lack of intrinsic factor, lack of sufficient pancreatic enzymes (pancreatic exocrine dysfunction) or presence of terminal heal mucosal disease may all result in abnormal vitamin B12 excretion.",

Mentzer index The Mentzer index is used to help in differentiating iron deficiency anemia from beta thalassemia. The index is calculated as the quotient of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV, in fL) divided by the red blood cell count (RBC, in millions per microleter). If the Mentzer index is less than 13, thallassemia is said to be more likely. If the Mentzer Index is greater than 13, Then iron-deficiency anemia is said to be more likely. Principle In iron deficiency, the marrow cannot produce as many RBCs and they are small (imcrocytic), so the RBC count and the MCV will both be low, and as a result, the index will be greater than 13. Conversely, in thalassemia, which is a disorder of globin synthesis, the number of RBCs produced is normal, but the cells are smaller and more fragile. Therefore, the RBC count is normal, but the MCV is low, so the index will be less than 13. In practice, the Mentzer index is not a reliable indicator and should not, by itself be used to differentiate the two conditions. Index Formula Value for iron deficiency anemia Value for iron thalassemia Mentzer index MC V/RBC count > 13 < 13 Shine and Lal index MCV2 x MCH x 0. 01 > 1530 < 1530 England and Fraser index MCV - RBC - (5 x Hb) 5. 19 > 0 < 0 Srivastava index MCH/RBC > 3. 8 < 3. 8 Green and king index MCV2 x RDW x Hb/100 > 65 < 65 Red cell distribution width index MCV x RDW/RBC > 220 < 220",

The patient may describe a shade dropping in front of the eye or describe vision like looking through ground glass. If a thrombus propagates up the carotid to the middle cerebral aery, then symptoms seen in middle cerebral aery occlusion or embolization (hemiparesis with sensory symptoms, aphasia depending on hemispheric dominance) will also occur. Midbasilar aery disease produces weakness and sensory loss with diplopia, loss of facial sensation or movement, and ataxia. Branches of the basilar aery supply the base of the pons and superior cerebellum. The symptoms described suggest disease in the posterior circulation, whichincludes paired veebral aeries, the basilar aery, and the paired posterior cerebral aeries. The basilar aery divides into two posterior cerebral aeries that provide branches to the cerebellum, medulla, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and temporal and occipital lobes. A midbasilar aery occlusion could cause ataxia of limbs by involving pontine nuclei; paralysis of the face, arm, and leg by involving coicospinal tracts; and impairment of facial sensation by involvement of fifth nerve nucleus. Occlusion of the entire middle cerebral aery results in contralateral hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, and homonymous hemianopsia. When the dominant hemisphere is involved, aphasia is present. When the nondominant hemisphere is involved, apraxia and neglect are produced. When only a penetrating branch of the middle cerebral aery is affected, the syndrome of pure motor hemiplegia is produced, as the infarct involves only the posterior limb of the internal capsule, involving only motor fibers to the face, arm, and leg (lacunar infarct).",

If IV/10 access cannot be established, epinephrine can be administered an endotracheal tube at a higher dose (2 to 2. 5mg). Vasopressin (40 mg iv/I0) could be substituted for the first or second dose of epinephrine if desired. The preferred antiarrhythmic agent for resuscitation is Amiodarone. Amiodarone is recommended in patients with VF/VT that does not respond to CPR, defibrillation, and vasopressor therapy. (first dose; 300mg 1V/I0; second dose; 150mg IV/10). It should be noted that The use of atropine far PEA/Asystole was recently removed from the ACLS algorithm. Evidence is insufficient to recommend routine administration of sodium bicarbonate during resuscitation. First dose; 300 mg bolus second dose; 150 mg Lidocaine is not pa of the ACLS 2010 Algorithm but may be used. The AHA recommends its administration after epinephrine; vasopressin and Amiodarone have been tried. But in clinical studies Lidocaine has not been demonstrated to improve rates of ROSC and hospital admission compared with Amiodarone. It is given in a bolus of ling/kg. A second loading dose of I mg/kg can be given in 10-15 minutes alter the first one. ACLS: Pharmacological agents Medications that have been changed Atropine: deleted from pulseless arrest algorithm Sodium Bicarbonate: Routine use not recommended Calcium: Routine administration for treatment of cardiac arrest not recommended Medications that have remained unchanged Epinephrine: dose, interval unchanged Vasopressin: dose, use unchanged Amiodarone: dose, indications unchanged Lidocaine: dose, indications unchanged",

For patients with known diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. - Dexamethasone, i. v. hydrocortisone or any intravenous glucocorticoid preparation may be used. This can rapidly decrease the inappropriate vasopressin production with increased clearance of free water and correction of hyponatremia. In contrast to glucocorticoid replacement, mineralocorticoid replacement is not necessary acutely because it takes several days for its sodium retaining effects to appear and adequate sodium replacement can be achieved by intravenous saline alone. However in patients with known primary adrenal insufficiency with potassium > 6. 0 meq./L hydrocortisone is preferred because of its mineralocorticoid activity. Treatment of acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal crisis) in adults Emergency measures Establish intravenous access with a large-gauge needle. Draw blood for immediate serum electrolytes and glucose and routine measurement of plasma cortisol and ACTH. Do not wait for lab results. Infuse 2 to 3 liters of isotonic saline or 5 percent dextrose in isotonic saline as quickly as possible. Frequent hemodynamic monitoring and measurement of serum electrolytes should be performed to avoid iatrogenic fluid overload. Give 4 mg dexamethasone as intravenous bolus over one to five minutes and every 12 hours thereafter. Dexamethasone is the drug of choice because it does not interfere with the measurement of plasma cortisol. If dexamethasone is unavailable, intravenous hydrocortisone, 100 mg immediately and every six hours thereafter, may be used. Use supportive measures as needed. Subacute measures after stabilization of the patient Continue intravenous isotonic saline at a slower rate for next 24 to 48 hours. Search for and treat possible infections precipitating causes of the adrenal crisis. Perform short ACTH stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, if patient does not have know adrenal insufficiency. Determine the type of adrenal insufficiency and its cause if not already known. Taper parenteral glucocorticoid over one to three days, if precipitating or complicating illness permits, to oral glucocorticoid maintenance dose.

The features of Hypernatrenzia, Increased osmolality and increased urine output indicates diuresis due to mannitol. Pts with head injury and increased intracranial pressure requires mannitol adminstration (to reduce intracranial pressure). Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic, it is freely filtered at glomerulus and undergoes limited reabsorption. Presence of mannitol in the tubular fluid reduces the corticomedullary gradiant and retains water isoosmatically in the proximal tubular fluid. So, the primary function of mannitol is to increase urinary volume. The loss of water in the urine can cause Hypernatremia and increase in serum osmolarity. \"Whenever mannitol is administered in cases of head trauma to reduce the intracranial tension, serum osmolarity should always be monitored (it should never be allowed to go beyond 320 mosmol/kg.)\" Diabetes insipidus Hypernatremia and increase in Serum osmolarity can also occur in Diabetes insipidus (due to increased water loss). Presence of head injury too, suggests Diabetes insipidus But, this is not a case of diabetes insipidus To establish the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus urinary osmolarity and specific gravity is needed - urine osmolarity < 300 mosmol/kg and - specific gravity < 1. 02 Urine output in cases of diabetes insipidus is generally in the range of 6-7 L/day. (Here, the urine output is 3. 5 L/day which is just adequate to meet the criteria of polyuria) Remember, The pt is on a diruretic i. e., mannitol Mannitol will prevent reabsorption of water in -> Proximal tubule. Diabetes insipidus will prevent reabsorption water in -> Collecting duct of So the presence of diabetes insipidus in patients on diuretic will lead to huge loss of water through urine which will certainly be much more than 3. 5 L/day Note: The patients is on ventilator Significant loss of water also occurs through ventilation by evaporation. This may also contribute to hypernatremia and increase in serum osmolarity. Too much infusion of normal saline Too much infusion of normal saline will never increase sodium and serum osmolarity in physiologically normal patient Hypernatremia can be caused by administration of hypertonic saline and Na.

However the actual acid load to the patient is minimal. The acid load on massive blood transfusion is quickly countered by the effect of citrate infusion as citrate is normally metabolized to sodium bicarbonate. It is therefore more common for massively transfused patients to exhibit metabolic alkalosis rather than metabolic acidosis. Patients with massive transfusion may present with initial metabolic acidosis, however metabolic alkalosis is more frequent once citrate is metabolized in liver to bicarbonate.",

Neuropathic joint Disease/Charcot's joint It is progressive destructive ahritis arising from loss of pain sensation and proprioception (position sense). Clinical Presentation Begins in a single joint & progress to involve other joints. Joint becomes progressively enlarged (swollen) from bony overgrowth and synol effusion. Loose bodies may be palpated in the joint. Joint instability subluxation & crepitus occurs as the disease progresses. Patients complains of weakness, swelling, instability, laxity & progressive deformity usually involving knee or ankle. The markedly swollen joint is neither tender nor warm. The appearance suggest that movements would be agonizing and yet it is often painless. The paradox is diagnostic i. e. the amount of pain experienced is less than would be anticipated based on degree of joint involvement. Sudden pain occurs from intraaicular farctures of osteophytes or condyles Features of underlying disease Radiological Features Similar to OA i. e. joint space narrowing, subchondrial bone sclerosis, osteophytes loose bodies and joint effusion.

Plasma levels of CEA can be determined readily by radioimmunoassay. However, its usefulness in colon carcinogenesis screening is limited because of its high level in the plasma of a patient's malignancies originating from other sites such as breast, pancreas, stomach and lung. Fuhermore, CEA plasma levels may also be increased in smokers or patients with chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, bronchitis and alcoholic liver disease. The clinical usefulness of CEA for screening purposes is fuher limited by the fact that its increase in level typically occurs only when the tumor penetrates through the serosa. Thus, early lesions may not be detected by serum CEA level changes. CEA is typically elevated with metastatic liver disease, but rarely with peritoneal involvement. Thus, while the specificity for CEA to identify occult CRCs is high, the sensitivity is low in most studies for screening. Accordingly, CEA is not a useful test for the screening of CRC. Regardless of the clinicopathologic stage, a preoperative elevation of the plasma CEA level predicts eventual tumour recurrence. High level of CA 19-9 is seen in the plasma of a patient's malignancies originating from colon, breast and pancreas",

If the patient has atrial fibrillation and a rapid rate associated with severe heart failure or cardiogenic shock, emergency direct-current cardioversion is indicated. For patients with atrial fibrillation associated with rapid rate but with stable hemodynamics, attempts to achieve acute rate control are indicated. Drugs to slow the ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation include digitalis preparations, calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem), and beta-blockers. If rapid rate control is desired, then calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers are far more effective than digitalis, which may require many hours before rate control is achieved.

        "question": "A neurological examination of a 47 year old woman reveals a normal corneal reflex in her right eye, but no consensual corneal reflex in her left eye. Which of the following additional findings might be expected?",
        "exp": "The first trick to this question is to determine where the lesion is. The corneal reflex is tested by touching a cotton wisp to the eye. A normal response would be blinking of the ipsilateral eye as well as the contralateral eye (consensual reflex). The afferent limb of the corneal reflex is contained within the ophthalmic division of the ipsilateral ophthalmic nerve (V1), the efferent limb is by both (right and left) facial nerves (VII). This woman had a normal corneal reflex in her right eye, indicating a normal right V1 and right VII. However, she lacked a consensual reflex, indicating an abnormal left VIIth nerve. The next trick to this question is to determine what other signs a lesion in the left VIIth nerve could produce. A lesion in the left VIIth would also produce hyperacusis (increased sensitivity to sound) in the left ear because of paralysis of the stapedius muscle, which ordinarily dampens sound transmission through the middle ear. The absence of a pupillary light reflex of the left eye could be caused either by a lesion of the left optic nerve (CN II; afferent limb) or by a lesion of the left oculomotor nerve (CN III; efferent limb). The inability to abduct the right eye could be caused by a lesion of the right abducens nerve (CN VI), which innervates the lateral rectus muscle. Loss of pain and temperature of the left face could be caused by a lesion of the spinal nucleus of V. This nucleus is located in the medulla, and receives pain and temperature information from the face the trigeminal nerve (CN V). Ref: Rosenga A. J., Novakovic R. L., Frank J. I. (2005). Chapter 67.

All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production. The gross hematuria resolves after a few days, though microscopic hematuria may persist.

They are surrogate markers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and indicate a cellular immune response to M. tuberculosis. a IGRAs cannot distinguish between latent infection and active tuberculosis (TB) disease and should not be used for diagnosis of active TB, which is a microbiological diagnosis. A positive IGRA result may not necessarily indicate active TB, and a negative IGRA result may not rule out active TB. 3 Because IGRAs are not affected by Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination status, IGRAs are useful for evaluation of LTBI in BCG-vaccinated individuals, paicularly in settings where BCG vaccination is administered after infancy or multiple (booster) BCG vaccinations are given. Assay antigens M. tuberculosis-specific antigens include:- Early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) and Culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10). These are encoded by genes located within the region of difference 1 (RD1) segment of the M. tuberculosis genome. They are more specific for M. tuberculosis than purified protein derivative (PPD) because they are not shared with any BCG vaccine strains or most species of NTM other than M marinum, M. kansasii, M szulgai, and M. flavescens. Types of assays Two IGRAs are available in many countries:- The Quanti. FERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay, which has replaced the second-generation Quantiferon. TB Gold (QFT-G) assay, and the T-SPOTTB assay.

A newer assay, the Quanti. FERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus), became available in 2015. This test is available in Europe but not in Noh America. The QFT-Plus assay has two TB antigen tubes, unlike the QFT assay (which has a single TB antigen tube). Sensitivity and specificity IGRAs have specificity >95 percent for diagnosis of latent TB infection. The sensitivity for T-SPOTTB appears to be higher than for QFT-GIT or TST (approximately 90, 80, and 80 percent, respectively). The higher sensitivity of T-SPOTTB may be useful for evaluating individuals with immunosuppressive conditions. TST specificity is high in populations not vaccinated with BCG (97 percent). Among populations where BCG is administered, it is much lower although variable (approximately 60 percent).",

The central respiratory drive is maintained in patients with neuromuscular disorders. Thus, hypoventilation is secondary to respiratory muscle weakness. Chest wall deformities such as kyphoscoliosis, fibrothorax, and those occurring postthoraco-plasty are associated with alveolar hypoventilation leading to respiratory insufficiency and respiratory failure. Hypoventilation is not uncommon in patients with severe COPD.

Branches of the basilar aery supply the base of the pons and superior cerebellum. The symptoms described suggest disease in the posterior circulation, whichincludes paired veebral aeries, the basilar aery, and the paired posterior cerebral aeries. The basilar aery divides into two posterior cerebral aeries that provide branches to the cerebellum, medulla, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and temporal and occipital lobes. A midbasilar aery occlusion could cause ataxia of limbs by involving pontine nuclei; paralysis of the face, arm, and leg by involving coicospinal tracts; and impairment of facial sensation by involvement of fifth nerve nucleus. Occlusion of the entire middle cerebral aery results in contralateral hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, and homonymous hemianopsia. When the dominant hemisphere is involved, aphasia is present. When the nondominant hemisphere is involved, apraxia and neglect are produced. When only a penetrating branch of the middle cerebral aery is affected, the syndrome of pure motor hemiplegia is produced, as the infarct involves only the posterior limb of the internal capsule, involving only motor fibers to the face, arm, and leg (lacunar infarct).",

        "question": "A 40 year old male patient is suffering from type II diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Which of the following antihypeensive drugs should not be used in such patients:",
        "exp": "Answer is B (Hydrochlohiazide) Hydrochlohiazide is not a preferred agent for the treatment of hypertension in diabetics as it causes unorable alteration in glucose and lipid profile of the patient. `Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia have been repoed with the use of diuretics as antihypeensives' -- KDT Antihypeensive drugs in diabetics: 'ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers are the first line agents for management of hypertension in diabetics' -- Harrison 16th/ 1479 Lisinopril & Trandalopvil are examples of ACE inhibitors while Losaan is an angiotensin receptor blocking agent. These have no known adverse effects on glucose or lipid metabolism and minimize the development of diabetic nephropathy by reducing renal vascular resistance and renal perfusion pressure. What puzzles the situation: In Diabetic patient with hypertension multiple agents are usually needed to achieve good blood pressure control. The average diabetic patient will require at least three medications to achieve appropriate control. While ACE inhibitors/ angiotensin receptor blockers will form an essential component of the regimen, Thiazide diuretics may also be used as an additional agent. Thus diuretics though not preferred agents for treatment of hypertension in diabetics, may well be used as conjunctive agents and are a possible treatment modality. Neveheless they are the single best answer to exclude amongst the options provided here.",
