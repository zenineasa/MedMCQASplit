In fact, aspiration of a massive amount of gastric contents can produce acute respiratory distress within 1 hour. The acidity of gastric contents results in chemical burns to the tracheobronchial tree involved in the aspiration. If the pH of the aspirated fluid is less than 2. 5 and the volume of aspirate is greater than 0. 3 mL/kg of body weight (20-25 mL in adults), it has a greater potential for causing chemical pneumonia. The initial chemical burn is followed by an inflammatory cellular reaction fueled by the release of potent cytokines, paicularly tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-8.",

        "exp": "\" Edema is not seen in primary aldosteronism, even though there is marked sodium and water retention. \" Lack of edema is due to the fact that increased atrial natriuretic factor secreted by cardiac tissues limits sodium retention. When the cause of hyperaldosteronism lies within the adrenal gland itself the condition is known as primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) The most common cause of primary hyperaldosteronism is unilateral adrenal adenoma. Clinical features of primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) In primary hyperaldosteronism there is excess secretion of mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) by adrenal cortex. Aldosterone is the major mineralocorticoid secreted by the adrenals. The major physiological effect of aldosterone is It increases absorption of sodium and simultaneously increases secretion ofpotassium by the renal tubular epithelial cells in the collecting tubules. Therefore aldosterone causes sodium to be conserved in the extracellular fluid while increasing potassium excretion in the urine. Now, The effect of excess aldosterone secretion. Excess aldosterone does not cause significant increase in serum sodium Excess aldosterone increases extracellular fluid volume and arterial pressure but has only a small effect on plasma sodium concentration. Although, aldosterone has a potent effect in decreasing the rate of sodium excretion by the kidneys, the concentration of sodium in the extracellular fluid rises only a few milliequivalents. The reason is that when sodium is reabsorbed by the tubules there is simultaneous osmotic absorption of almost equivalents amount of water. Also, small increase in extracellular fluid sodium concentration stimulates thirst and increased water intake, if water is available. Therefore the extracellular fluid volume increases almost as much as the retained sodium but without much change in sodium concentration. Therefore even though aldosterone is one of the body's most powerful sodium retaining hormones, only transient sodium retention occurs when excess amounts are secreted. \u200bExcess aldosterone does not produce edema Aldosterone mediated increase in extracellular fluid volume lasting more than 1-2 days also leads to increase in arterial pressure. Increase in extracellular fluid increase the B. P. to 15-20 mm Hg and this elevated B. P. in turn increases kidney excretion of both salt and water called pressure natriuresis and pressure diuresis. This return to normal of salt and water excretion by the kidneys as a result of pressure natriuresis and diuresis is called aldosterone escape (this mechanism does not allow edema to develop). Thereafter, the rate of gain of salt and water by the body is zero, and balance is maintained between salt and water intake and output by the kidneys despite continued excess aldosterone. In the meantime however the person has developed hypertension, which lasts as long as the person remains exposed to high levels of aldosterone. \u200bExcess aldosterone causes hypokalenzia and muscle weakness Normally aldosterone increases the secretion of potassium by renal tubular epithelial cells. Excess aldosterone further enhances this process. Excess aldosterone not only causes loss ofpotassium ions from the extracellular fluid but also stimulates transport of potassium from the extracellular fluid into intracellular fluid. Therefore, excessive secretion of aldosterone causes serious decrease in plasma potassium concentration. \u200bExcess aldosterone increases tubular hydrogen ion secretion, with resultant mild alkalosis Aldosterone not only causes potassium to be secreted into the tubule in exchange for sodium reabsorption in the cells of renal collecting tubules but also causes secretion of hydrogen ions in exchange for sodium in the intercalated cells of the cortical collecting tubules. The obvious effect of this is to decrease the hydrogen ion concentration in the extracellular fluid. This effect usually causes a mild degree of alkalosis",

        "question": "All of the following statements regarding cirrhotic ascites are true except:",
        "exp": "Currently, the vasodilator theory for development of cirrhotic/poal hypeensive ascites is the most widely accepted one. Peripheral vasodilatation results in underfilling of the aerial tree. When this result is hemodynamically significant, a baroreceptor-mediated increased release of renin, aldosterone, vasopressin, and norepinephrine occurs, resulting in fluid retention and deteriorating renal function. At the extreme end of the spectrum, the hepatorenal syndrome can develop with oliguria, marked salt retention, and essentially normal renal morphology, Ascites formation also depends on the presence of poal hypertension. The increased hydrostatic pressure will cause an increased leakage of fluid from the very permeable hepatic sinusoids into the space of Disse. Fluid subsequently leaks from the space of Disse into the peritoneal cavity. The lymphatics are overwhelmed, and ascites forms. There are several facets to therapy. Although as little as 700 mg of sodium may be excreted daily in the cirrhotic state, a diet of less than 2 g of sodium daily is unpalatable and impractical. Therefore, in most instances of significant ascites, diuretics are necessary. Spironolactone, by inhibiting aldosterone, may be effective in mobilizing ascitic fluid 1 to 2 weeks after initiating therapy. Therefore, furosemide is usually begun concomitantly. Careful attention to serum potassium and renal function is required. High-volume paracentesis with or without IV albumin is very effective and seldom causes renal compromise. Peritoneovenous-jugular shunts are effective in mobilizing ascitic fluid but can result in congestive heart failure or variceal bleeding in susceptible individuals. Shunt occlusion is a common complication. Peritoneal fluid should be evaluated with simultaneous ascitic fluid and serum samples for albumin. A gradient of greater than 1. 1 between the serum and the ascitic fluid (serum-ascitic) is consistent with poal hypertension. If it is less than 1. 1, then an inflammatory/infectious or malignant cause must be sought.",

Thus, b thalassemia is characterized by deficient synthesis of the b chain, which is a component of hemoglobin A (Hb A). In an attempt to compensate, non Hb A hemoglobins are increased (e. g., Hb A2, which is composed of a and globins, concentration increases). The presence of such hemoglobins in increased amounts aids in the diagnosis of b-thalassemia trait.

        "exp": "It is a case of Testicular feminisation syndrome. The characteristic features of these disorders are that they are genotypically male (X19 while phenotypically they are female. These cases usually present as a female with abdominal testis. Prepubertal children with this disorder are often detected when inguinal masses prove to be a testis or when a testis is unexpectedly found during herniorrhapy in phenotypically female. It is called testicular feminisation syndrome but the name is both stigmatising and inaccurate (the testes do not produce feminising factors). The preferred name, complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) reflects the underlying aetiology. The cause of androgen insensitivity syndrome is the abnormality of the androgen receptor. In the fetus with CAIS testes forms normally due to the presence of the (SRY gene) on chromosome Y. At the appropriate time, these testes secrete anti-Mullerian hormone leading to the regression of Mullerian ducts. Hence CAIS 'women' do not have a uterus. Testosterone is also produced at the appropriate time. However, due to the complete inability of the androgen receptor to respond, the external genitalia do not virilise and instead undergo female development. These patients have a vagina instead of a penis. Other areas where testosterone may have important fetal effects, such as the brain, will also develop along the female path. The result is a female (both physically and psychologically) with no uterus, testis present which is found at some point in their line of descent through the abdomen from the pelvis to the inguinal canal. During puberty, breast development will be normal; however, the effects of androgens will not be seen, so pubic and axillary hair growth will be minimal. Majority of women with CAIS have shortened vagina when compared with the normal average length of 10-12 cm. The cause of this lies in the embryological development of the vagina, The upper portion of vagina -> develops from Mullerian ducts The lower portion of vagina -> develops from urogenital sinus. In CAIS Mullerian duct regresses, under the effect of the mullerian inhibiting hormone, leaving just the part derived from the urogenital sinus.

        "question": "Osteogenesis imperfecta is a group of diseases characterized by genetic mutations which lead to?",
        "exp": "Collagen is a fibrous protein composed of 3 chains which form the collagen triple helix. Several different types of collagen exist which vary in the types and combinations of the 3 chains forming the collagen helix. Each collagen chain is the product of separate genes. For example, the type of collagen found in skin, aeries, bone, and tendons, Type I Collagen, is composed of 2 a1(I) chains and 1 a2(I) chain. Every third amino acid residue of all of the collagen chains is glycine. This allows the chains to intewine with glycine at the center. Osteogenesis imperfecta is a disease consisting of at least 4 clinically, genetically, and biochemically distinguishable disorders. All are characterized by multiple bone fractures which result in bone deformities. Mutations leading to shoened a1(I) chains cause many of these variants. The sho a1(I) chain associates with normal a1(I) chains and a2(I) chains which prevents normal helix formation. Defective molecules are degraded leading to weakened collagen structures. Other forms of osteogenesis imperfecta are due to mutations in which glycine residues are changed to other amino acids. This leads to destabilization of the collagen helix because of the larger amino acid forced to the center of the helix structure. A decrease in hydroxyproline occurs in scurvy. This occurs because ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is necessary to form the hydroxyproline. With decreased amounts of hydroxyproline in the collagen molecule, the helix is less stable. The result is deficient growth and poor wound healing in the individual with scurvy. The disease Ehlers-Danlos VI is characterized by a decrease in the enzyme lysyl hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the formation of hydroxylysine. The decrease in hydroxylysine in collagen results in less stable cross-linking of the collagen molecules. Ref: Prockop D. J., Bateman J. F. (2012). Chapter 363.

Increased activity of which of the following serine proteases has been most closely tied to the emphysema that develops in these patients?",
        "exp": "The autosomal recessive disease is a-1-antitrypsin deficiency, in which an abnormal form of a-1-antitrypsin can be produced by, but not released from, liver cells. This enzyme was named when it was found in vivo to function as a good inhibitor of the pancreatic protease trypsin. However, it actually inactivates a wide variety of enzymes with protease activity that have an essential serine residue in the catalytic centers. Examples of these serine proteases include all of the question choices, and additionally, cathepsin G and plasminogen. Surprisingly, a-1-antitrypsin disease specifically targets only the liver and the lungs. The liver disease, which can be mild to life-threatening (either due to cirrhosis or, rarely, massive acute hepatic failure), is related to retained a-1-antitrypsin with residual enzymatic activity. The lung disease seems to be the specific result of an inability to turn off elastase produced by neutrophils during lung infections. Neutrophil elastase is one of the few enzymes that can successfully destroy the heavily cross-linked, insoluble, elastin that is presented in the lung interstitium and contributes to its elasticity. With destruction of this lattice-like elastic tissue suppo structure, emphysema can develop in the lungs.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Marfan's syndrome The most common cause of renal aery stenosis is an atheromatous plaque. Marfan Syndrome: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a spectrum of disorders caused by a heritable genetic defect of connective tissue that has an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. The defect itself has been isolated to the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, which codes for the connective tissue protein fibrillin. Abnormalities in this protein cause a myriad of distinct clinical problems, of which the musculoskeletal, cardiac, and ocular system problems predominate. The skeleton of patients with MFS typically displays multiple deformities including arachnodactyly (ie, abnormally long and thin digits), dolichostenomelia (ie, long limbs relative to trunk length), pectus deformities (ie, pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum), and thoracolumbar scoliosis. Finally, blindness may result from unrecognized and untreated glaucoma, retinal detachment, and cataracts. In the cardiovascular system, aoic dilatation, aoic regurgitation, and aneurysms are the most worrisome clinical findings. Mitral valve prolapse that requires valve replacement can occur as well. Ocular findings include myopia, cataracts, retinal detachment, and superior dislocation of the lens. Takayasu aeritis is also known as pulseless disease because of frequent occlusion of aeries arising from the aoa. It may also occlude renal aeries. Polyaeritis nodosa is a multisystem necizing vasculitis of small and medium sized muscular aeries in which involvement of the renal and visceral aeries is characteristic.

        "exp": "Echocardiography is an invaluable tool for assessing cardiovascular function in both normal and disease states. In the case of atrial fibrillation (AF), a chronic course versus an acute and self-limited course poend completely different treatment strategies and long-term prognoses. The most common cause of chronic AF is valvular disease, followed by congestive heart failure (CHF). The most common anatomic correlate seen in patients with AF (Framingham Hea Study) is an enlarged left atrium. A dilated left ventricle is commonly seen with both CHF and AF. However, an enlarged left atrium is more closely correlated with chronic AF than is left ventricular dilation. The causal relationship between an enlarged left atrium and AF is unclear. A dilated right ventricle is commonly seen in severe right heart failure (RHF). The most common cause of RHF is left heart failure (LHF). There is no consistent relationship between right hea size and the presence of AF. A hyperophied ventricular septum is commonly seen in hypeensive heart disease or idiopathic hyperophic aoic stenosis. Chronic AF in these patients, however, is much less common. Ref: Prystowsky E.

MODS may develop as a result of the initial insult, but more commonly, it develops following a second or subsequent insult to the host. The two-hit theory holds that the systemic inflammatory response is amplified following the second hit, such as nosocomial pneumonia, leading to exaggerated, persistent release of inflammatory mediators that contribute to the pathogenesis of MODS. The liver appears to be a pivotal organ in the progression and outcome of MODS, paly because of the activation and prolonged stimulation of the Kupffer cells, which comprise the majority of the body's macrophage population. Macrophages are known to play a critical role in the elaboration of numerous inflammatory mediators.

C. virus The main cells affected in the disease are oligodendrocytes. Since oligodendrocytes are concerned with myelination, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is characterized by multifocal areas of demyelination of varying size distributed throughout the brain but sparing the spinal cord and optic nerves. Pathology Besides demyelination there are characterises cytological alterations in both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes: - Astrocytes Enlarged and contain, hyperchromatic, deformed and bizarre nuclei and frequent mitotic figures. Oligodendrocytes These have enlarged densely staining nuclei that contains virus inclusions formed by crystalline arrays. Symptoms of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: - Visual defects (45%) -> Homonymous hemianopia, Conjugate gaze abnormalities Mental impairment (38%) -> Dementia, confusion, personality changes Weakness -> Hemi or monoparesis and ataxia Seizures (20%) -> Speech defect aphasia, hemiparesis, ataxia Focal neurological signs Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is predominantly seen in patients with immunosuppressive disorders Most commonly associated conditions are: - AIDS (80%)Q Hematological malignancies (13%) Transplant recipients (5%) Chronic inflammatory disease (2%) Prognosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy In most cases, death occurs in 3-6 months from onset of neurological symptoms and even more rapidly in patients with AIDS unless aggressive interetruvial treatment is undertaken. Diagnosis MRI is used for the diagnosis of PML. MRI is better than CT scan in the diagnosis of PML and is frequently used for the diagnosis of PML. On MRI the lesion appears as multifocal asymmetric coalescing white matter located periventricular. These lesions have increased signals on T2 and FLAIR images and decrease signal on T-weighted images. PML lesions are classically nonenhancingQ.

Additional features of SLE are low-grade fever, alopecia, pericarditis, ahritis, nephritis, nervous system involvement, and pleural effusions. Women are affected ten times more often than men. The lupus band test, demonstrating linear IgG and complement deposition at the dermal-epidermal junction, is positive in 90% of cases. However, it is not specific for SLE and may also be seen in bullous pemphigoid, dermatomyositis, and other autoimmune diseases. A positive reaction to the lupus band test on normal-appearing skin is helpful in diagnosis. Serum complement levels decline with disease flares and are useful in guiding treatment, whereas the ESR often remains elevated during remissions and is an unreliable marker of disease activity.

Symptomatology Parkinsonism/ Parkinson's syndrome/Atypical Parkinson's/Secondary Parkinson's It is a neurological syndrome (not necessarily the specific disease) characterized by tremor, hypokinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. The underlying causes of parkinsonism are numerous, and diagnosis can be complex. The neurodegenerative condition Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common cause of parkinsonism. However, a wide range of other etiologies may lead to a similar set of symptoms, including some toxins, a few metabolic diseases, and a handful of non-PD neurological conditions The age of the person presenting with parkinsonism is significant. A 20 year old person might present with parkinsonism. Younger patients should be checked for the many causes of parkinsonism, including Wilson disease and not immediately be given the diagnosis of Parkinson \"disease\". However, Juvenile Parkinson disease can cause parkinsonism in a child or young adult. In contrast a 60 year old person might present with parkinsonism, at first be diagnosed with Parkinson Disease, then determined to have a Parkinson plus syndrome. About 7% of people with parkinsonism have developed their symptoms following treatment with paicular medications. Side effect of medications, mainly neuroleptic antipsychotics especially the phenothiazines (such as perphenazine and chlorpromazine), thioxanthenes (such as flupenthixol and zuclopenthixol) and butyrophenones (such as haloperidol), piperazines (such as ziprasidone), and, rarely, antidepressants. The incidence of drug-induced parkinsonism increases with age. Drug induced parkinsonism tends to remain at its presenting level, i. e. does not progress like the parkinson disease. Parkinson's disease/PD/Idiopathic or primary parkinsonism/Hypokinetic rigid syndrome/HRS/ Paralysis agitans It is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease result from the death of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. Early in the course of the disease, the most obvious symptoms are movement-related; these include shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty with walking and gait. Later, thinking and behavioral problems may arise, with dementia commonly occurring in the advanced stages of the disease, whereas depression is the most common psychiatric symptom. Other symptoms include sensory, sleep and emotional problems. Parkinson's disease is more common in the elderly, with most cases occurring after the age of 50. The main motor symptoms are collectively called parkinsonism, or a \"parkinsonian syndrome\". Parkinson's disease is often defined as a parkinsonian syndrome that is idiopathic (having no known cause),",

Achlorhydria in turn leads to pronounced hypergastrinemia (> 1000 pg/mL) due to loss of acid inhibition of gastrin G cells. Anti-parietal cell antibodies are present in over 90% cases and anti-intrinsic factor antibodies are present in 70% of patients. Decreased intrinsic factor secretion, leads to vitamin B12 malabsorption. Fundic histology in pernicious anemia is characterized by severe gland atrophy and intestinal metaplasia caused by autoimmune destruction of the gastric fundic mucosa. Complications: Hypergastrinemia may induce hyperplasia of gastric enterochromaffin-like cells that leads to the development of small, multicentric carcinoid tumors in 5% of patients and there is a three fold increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma.

        "question": "True is Klinefelter's syndrome -",
        "exp": "Klinefelter Syndrome Klinefelter syndrome is the most common chromosomal disorder associated with male hypogonadism and infertility. It is defined classically by a 47, XXY karyotype with variants demonstrating additional X and Y chromosomes. Pathophysiology: The addition of more than 1 extra X or Y chromosome to a male karyotype results in variable physical and cognitive abnormalities. In general, the extent of phenotypic abnormalities, including mental retardation, is related directly to the number of supernumerary X chromosomes. As the number of X chromosomes increases, somatic and cognitive development are more likely to be affected. Gonadal development is particularly susceptible to each additional X chromosome, resulting in seminiferous tubule dysgenesis and infertility as well as hypoplastic and malformed genitalia. Moreover, mental capacity diminishes with additional X chromosomes. The intelligence quotient (IQ) is reduced by approximately 15 points for each supernumerary X chromosome. All major areas of development, including expressive and receptive language and coordination, are affected by extra X chromosome material. Sex: Because of an additional X chromosome on an XY background, this condition is seen in males only. Age: Most males born with Klinefelter syndrome go through life without being diagnosed. Diagnosis, when made, usually occurs in adulthood. The most common indications for karyotyping are hypogonadism and infertility. Physical Growth Infants and children have normal heights, weights, and head circumferences. About 25% have clinodactyly. Height velocity is increased by age 5 years, and adult height usually is taller than average. Affected individuals also have disproportionately long arms and legs. Some individuals with Klinefelter variant 49, XXXXY have short stature. Central nervous system Most 47, XXY males have normal intelligence. Family background influences IQ. Subnormal intelligence or mental retardation may be associated with the presence of a higher number of X chromosomes. About 70% of patients have minor developmental and learning disabilities. These may include academic difficulties, delayed speech and language acquisition, diminished short-term memory, decreased data retrieval skills, reading difficulties, dyslexia, and attention deficit disorder. Patients may exhibit behavioural problems and psychological distress. This may be due to poor self-esteem and psychosocial development or a decreased ability to deal with stress. Psychiatric disorders involving anxiety, depression, neurosis, and psychosis are seen more commonly in this group than in the general population. Sexual characteristics Patients may lack secondary sexual characteristics because of a decrease in androgen production. This results in the sparse facial/body/sexual hair, a high-pitched voice. They have eunuchoid body habitus. By late puberty, 30-50% of boys with Klinefelter syndrome manifest gynecomastia, which is secondary to elevated estradiol levels and increased estradiol/testosterone ratio. The risk of developing breast carcinoma is at least 20 times higher than normal. Testicular dysgenesis (small firm testis, testis size <10 mL) may be present in postpubertal patients. Infertility/azoospermia may result from atrophy of the seminiferous tubules. Infertility is seen in practically all individuals with a 47, XXY karyotype. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome mosaicism (46, XY/47, XXY) can be fertile. Patients may have an increased frequency of extragonadal germ cell tumors such as embryonal carcinoma, teratoma, and primary mediastinal germ cell tumor. Cardiac and circulatory problems Mitral valve prolapse occurs in 55% of patients. Varicose veins occur in 20-40% of patients. The prevalence of venous ulcers is 10-20 times higher than normal, and the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is increased.",

ALT is a more specific indicator of Liver injury than AST AST (Aspaate Aminotransferase) is found in the liver, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, pancreas, lung, leukocytes and erythrocytes in decreasing order of concentration. ALT is found primarily in the liver and is therefore a more specific indicator of Liver injury - Harrison's 186/2528 Absolute level of Aminotransferase elevation do not correlate with outcome `There is poor correlatation between extent of Liver cell Necrosis and the elevation of serum aminotransferase levels in chronic liver diseases. Similarly, absolute elevation of aminotransferase levels is of little value in predicting the outcome of acute hepatocellular disorders' - Schiff's Deseases of the Liver Serum Glutathione - S- Transferase may be used as a prognostic marker after transplant surgery 'Serum Alpha - Glutathione - S - Transferase is an emerging static test indicating hepatocellular damage. As in vivo plasma half life of this enzyme is less than 60-90 minutes, this enzyme offer advantages in post-transplant monitoring as an aid to the diagnosis of acute allagraft rejection. Recent investigations have indicated that monitoring of GST reduced both moality and morbidity in liver transplant recipients. GST showed a distinct higher sensitivity (81%) for acute rejection than conventional liver function tests (the specificity however was relatively low (45%). Glutathione - S-Transferase (GST) - Miller's Anesthesia (Elsevier) 2010/426 Glittathione-S-Transferase is a sensitive and specific test for some patterns of Liver injury. The enzyme has a brief plasma half life (90 minutes) and is released rapidly into circulation following hpatocellular injury. Thus serial GST measurements can reveal time course of hepatic injury from its onset to its resolution. In contrast to AST and ALT which reside in Acinar Zone I, GST localizes in Acinar Zone III (centrilobular region). This zone contains the hepatacyte population with highest susceptibility to injury from hypoxia or reactive drug metabolites. Accordingly GST would be more sensitive than AST or ALT as a marker of contrilobular necrosis in its incipient stage.",

Non small cell carcinomas Small cell carcinomas For non small cell carcinomas the primary modality depends on the extent of disease * Localized diseases: (Stage 1 & H) * * Small cell lung carcinomas behave as systemic disease. Most small cell carcinomas have already spread at the time of presentation beyond the bounds of surgery and they are managed primarily by chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. Primary modality of treatment is surgery -- pulmonary resection. * Advanced disease: Radiotherapy with curative intent is advocated (+- chemotherapy) * Metastatic disease (Stage IV) symptomatic/suppoive If we were to go by the information available in the question, The maximum tumor size (T) is = 5 cm ( 3), i. e. T2 There is no nodal involvement (No) There is no distal metastases (Mo) Thus it is T2 No Mo disease or stage I disease The treatment of choice for stage I disease is surgery i. e. Pulmonary resection The tumor in question has no nodal involvement and no metastases and hence is likely to be a non small cell carcinoma.

Excessive levels of aldosterone cause sodium retention and potassium excretion, with resultant hypertension and hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can cause weakness, parethesias, visual disturbances and tetany. The diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism is confirmed by the elvated level of aldostetone and depressed levels of renin in the circulation (low PRA).

Distinctive Pathophvsiological features include: Heterogeneous hyperophy of LV Pattern of hyperophy is distinctive Asymmetrical septa! hyperophy is characteristic mainly affecting the IV septum and anterolateral wall Thickness of ventricular septum is dispropoionately increased when compared with the free wall Dynamic LV outflow obstruction The LV outflow obstruction is dynamic i. e. it is related to narrowing of the subaoic area as a consequence of opposition of anterior mitral valve leaflet against the hyperophied septum in midsystole. The concept is termed systolic anterior motion (SAM) of mitral valve. The obstruction in HOCM is dynamic and is caused by the opposition of mitral valve leaflet against the hyperophied septum during systole. Increase in volume of blood in LV will move the muscular obstruction away from the opposite wall and decrease the obstructing agent as well as the intensity of murmur. Passive leg raising augments venous return, increases the volume of blood in LV, decreases the obstruction and hence decreases the murmur. Increase in myocardial contractility worsens the obstruction by moving the opposing walls closer to each other. 13 agonists (increase myocardial contractility) would thus increase the obstruction and should not be used. 13 blockers on the other hand are the agent of choice as these decrease myocardial contractility and hence relieve the obstruction by moving the opposing walls away from each other.

        "exp": "This patient has a hypeensive emergency, as evidenced by both the presence of elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as evidence of end- organ damage. The blood pressure numbers themselves are a good reason for urgency, but the presence of increased intracranial pressure and renal failure require that this patient be triaged as an emergency. Elevated blood pressure alone, in the absence of symptoms or end organ damage, rarely requires emergency therapy. The therapy for a hypeensive emergency requires IMMEDIATE LOWERING of the blood pressure by approximately 20-30 mm Hg by intravenous administration of medication. The blood pressure should not be reduced to normotensive levels because of the risk of watershed cerebral infarcts with such a dramatic reduction. Ordering an ECG and observing the patient is incorrect. Observation is ceainly warranted, but not without intervention. Giving the patient his usual daily doses of blood pressure medications and observing him would not achieve a rapid enough reduction of the blood pressure, given the presence of end-organ damage on physical examination.

The contractile function of the hibernating myocardium can be almost completely restored after reperfusion (revascularization)' Stunned Myocardium 'Stunned Myocardium refers to a state of postischemic 'reversible' myocardial contractile dysfunction that persists despite myocardial reperfusion. Myocardial stunning essentially describes the postischemic metabolic and contractile compromise in ble myocardium after a transient coronary occlusion (i. e. post successful reperfusion in AMI). In stunned myocardium contraction does not return to baseline for a prolonged period of time after restoration of blood supply and the eventual recovery of contractile dysfunction is believed to be 'spontaneous'. Stunned myocardium is typified by a normal or near normal regional blood flow and represents a mismatch between flow and function. Hibernating Myocardium Hibernating myocardium refers to a state of ischemic (chronic) reversible myocardial contractile dysfunction that is almost completely restored after myocardial reperfusion. Myocardial Hibernation essentially describes a chronic state of contractile dysfunction at rest in non-infarcted ble myocardium as a result of persistently reduced blood flow, which has the potential to improve function after restoration of myocardial blood supply. In Hibernating myocardium the eventual return of contractile dysfunction is believed to be directly related to myocardial reperfusion/revascularization.

The jugular venous pulsation has a biphasic waveform. The \" a \" wave corresponds to right Atrial contraction and ends synchronously with the carotid aery pulse. The peak of the 'a' wave demarcates the end of atrial systole. The \" c \" wave corresponds to right ventricular Contraction causing the tri. Cuspid valve to bulge towards the right atrium. The \" x' \" (x prime) descent follows the 'c' wave and occurs as a result of the right ventricle pulling the tricuspid valve downward during ventricular systole. (As stroke volume is ejected, the ventricle takes up less space in pericardium, allowing rela. Xed atrium to enlarge). The x' (x prime) descent can be used as a measure of right ventricle contractility. The \" x \" descent follows the 'a' wave and corresponds to atrial rela. Xation and rapid atrial filling due to low pressure. The \" v \" wave corresponds to Venous filling when the tricuspid valve is closed and venous pressure increases from venous return - this occurs during and following the carotid pulse.

Positive blood culture * Typical microorganism for infective endocarditis from two separate blood cultures * Viridans streptococci, Streptococcus gallolyticus, HACEK group, Staphylococcus aureus, or * Community-acquired enterococci in the absence of a primary focus, or * Persistently positive blood culture, defined as recovery of a microorganism consistent with infective endocarditis from: * Blood cultures drawn >12 h apa; or * All of 3 or a majority of 4 separate blood cultures, with first and last drawn at least 1 h apa * Single positive blood culture for Coxiella burnetii or phase I IgG antibody titer of >1: 800 2. Evidence of endocardial involvement * Positive echocardiogram\" * Oscillating intracardiac mass on valve or suppoing structures or in the path of regurgitant jets or in implanted material, in the absence of an alternative anatomic explanation, or * Abscess, or * New paial dehiscence of prosthetic valve, or * New valvular regurgitation (increase or change in preexisting murmur not sufficient) Minor Criteria 1. Predisposition: predisposing hea condition or injection drug use 2. Fever 38. 0degC (100. 4degF) 3. Vascular phenomena: major aerial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, conjunctival hemorrhages, Janeway lesions 4. Immunologic phenomena: glomerulonephritis, Osler's nodes, Roth's spots, rheumatoid factor 5. Microbiologic evidence: positive blood culture but not meeting major criterion as noted previously' or serologic evidence of active infection with organism consistent with infective endocarditis 'Definite endocarditis is defined by documentation of two major criteria, of one major criterion and three minor criteria, or of five minor criteria.
