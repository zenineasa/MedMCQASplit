Hepatotoxicity Acute poisoning with arsenic is marked by severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, muscle cramps, metallic taste and extreme thirst, followed by stupor, coma, cardiovascular collapse and death. Death can occur within 24 hours of exposure, but with sublethal doses, survival is possible and liver injury may arise 24 to 48 hours after the acute ingestion. Other symptoms include conjunctival and respiratory tract inflammation, epistaxis, rash, renal insufficiency and painful neuropathy. The characteristics of the liver injury have not been well defined, but are likely similar to those with acute iron poisoning, with a clinical phenotype of acute hepatic necrosis, marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, early onset of hepatic failure and rapid recovery in cases without early fatality. Chronic, lower dose exposure to arsenic can be toxic and result in arsenosis, a syndrome marked by fatigue, nausea and vomiting, abdominal crampy pain, weakness, stupor, seizures and neuropathy. Skin manifestations are frequent and characteristic with chronic excessive exposure marked by hyper- and hypo-pigmentation, a \"rain-drop\" pattern of skin discoloration, skin dryness and exfoliation, keratosis of the palms and soles, and skin cancers. Arsenic is also deposited in the hair and nails, where it can be detected even after it is no longer measureable in urine. Liver injury can also occur with chronic arsenic exposure, typically with appearance of signs and symptoms of poal hypeension, without obvious cirrhosis (idiopathic or noncirrhotic poal hypeension). The clinical onset of noncirrhotic poal hypeension is often insidious with weight loss, fatigue and abdominal swelling and minor, nonspecific elevations in serum enzymes, followed by appearance of variceal hemorrhage or ascites.

Patients may be inebriated and mild hypotension has been repoed. Patients may have an abnormal osmolal gap and develop an anion gap metabolic acidosis. The onset of symptoms can develop soon after ingestion, or can be delayed depending on the amount ingested and co-ingestants (such as ethanol). Small ingestions may result in resolution of symptoms without fuher sequelae. Progression to the second phase occurs 1-3 days following exposure and also depends on the amount ingested. The hallmark of the second phase is acute renal failure. If left untreated, patients may die within a week after the onset of anuria. Additionally, mild to moderate hepatotoxicity is often seen. Multiple other effects have been repoed including cardiac dysrhythmias and pancreatitis, which may be secondary to the metabolic acidosis and renal failure. The degree of renal injury predicts the severity of the third phase of this poisoning, which are neurologic complications. These effects can be delayed until 1-2 weeks post-ingestion. Multiple varying neurologic sequelae have been described. Peripheral neuropathies are a common occurrence. Cranial nerve abnormalities have been repoed including bilateral facial paralysis. Widespread denervation of limb muscles has been demonstrated; patients may become quadraparetic and unresponsive.

        "exp": "Lead Poisoning: Leadis a highly toxic metal and a very strong poison. Lead poisoning is a serious and sometimes fatal condition. It occurs when lead builds up in the body. Leadis found in lead-based paints, including paint on the walls of old houses and toys. It is also found in: a supplies contaminated dust gasoline products sold outside of the United States and Canada Lead poisoning usually occurs over a period of months or years. It can cause severe mental and physical impairment. Young children are most vulnerable. Children get lead in their bodies by putting the lead-containing objects in their mouths. Touching the lead and then putting their fingers in their mouths may also poison them. Lead is more harmful to children because their brains and nervous systems are still developing. Lead poisoning can be treated, but any damage caused cannot be reversed. Symptoms of lead poisoning are varied. They may affect many pas of the body. Most of the time, lead poisoning builds up slowly. It follows repeated exposures to small quantities of lead. Lead toxicity is rare after a single exposure or ingestion of lead. Signs of repeated lead exposure include: abdominal pain abdominal cramps aggressive behavior constipation sleep problems headaches irritability loss of developmental skills in children loss of appetite fatigue high blood pressure numbness or tingling in the extremities memory loss anemia kidney dysfunction Since a child's brain is still developing, lead can lead to intellectual disability. Symptoms may include: behavior problems low IQ poor grades at school problems with hearing sho- and long-term learning difficulties growth delays A high, toxic dose of lead poisoning may result in emergency symptoms. These include: severe abdominal pain and cramping vomiting muscle weakness stumbling when walking seizures coma encephalopathy, which manifests as confusion, coma, and seizures Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 790",

        "exp": "usually happens because your body doesn't have enough insulin. Your cells can't use the sugar in your blood for energy, so they use fat for fuel instead. Burning fat makes acids called ketones and, if the process goes on for a while, they could build up in your blood. That excess can change the chemical balance of your blood and throw off your entire patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and develops when insulin levels are insufficient to meet the body's basic metabolic requirements. DKA is the first manifestation of type 1 DM in a minority of patients. Insulin deficiency can be absolute (eg, during lapses in the administration of exogenous insulin) or relative (eg, when usual insulin doses do not meet metabolic needs during physiologic stress) The therapeutic goals of DKA management include optimization of 1) volume status; 2) hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis; 3) electrolyte abnormalities; and 4) potential precipitating factors. The majority of patients with DKA present to the emergency room. Therefore, emergency physicians should initiate the management of hyperglycemic crisis while a physical examination is performed, basic metabolic parameters are obtained, and final diagnosis is made. Several impoant steps should be followed in the early stages of DKA management: collect blood for metabolic profile before initiation of intravenous fluids; infuse 1 L of 0.9% sodium chloride over 1 hour after drawing initial blood samples; ensure potassium level of >3.3 mEq/L before initiation of insulin therapy (supplement potassium intravenously if needed); initiate insulin therapy only when steps 1-3 are executed.
