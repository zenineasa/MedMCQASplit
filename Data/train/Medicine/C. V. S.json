        "exp": "Even severe AS may exist for many years without producing any symptoms because of the ability of the hyperophied LV to generate the elevated intraventricular pressures required to maintain a normal stroke volume. Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exeional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

Pulse deficit occurs when there are fewer pulses than there are heabeats. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter can cause pulse deficit because they cause the heart to beat so fast, and often irregularly, that the force of blood out of the heart is sometimes not strong enough to create a pulse.

Maturation disorders are divided into two categories: nuclear maturation defects, associated with macrocytosis, and cytoplasmic maturation defects, associated with microcytosis and hypochromia usually from defects in hemoglobin synthesis. Nuclear maturation defects result from vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency, drug damage, or myelodysplasia. Cytoplasmic maturation defects result from a severe iron deficiency or abnormalities in globin or heme synthesis. Acquired abnormalities are usually associated with myelodysplasia, may lead to either a macro- or microcytic anemia, and are frequently associated with mitochondrial iron loading. In these cases, iron is taken up by the mitochondria of the developing erythroid cell but not incorporated into heme. The iron-encrusted mitochondria surround the nucleus of the erythroid cell, forming a ring. Based on the distinctive finding of so-called ringed sideroblasts on the marrow iron stain, patients are diagnosed as having a sideroblastic anemia--almost always reflecting myelodysplasia. Ceain medications, such as isoniazid, L-dopa, penicillamine, and cycloserine, interact with PLP due to a reaction with carbonyl groups.

With aoic regurgitation, the incisura diminished as the severity of regurgitation increased. With calcific aoic stenosis, the incisura was smaller or absent. These observations imply a valve mechanism productive of the incisura. In vitro studies of human aoic valves confirmed these observations. Additional in vitro studies with high speed cinematography (2, 000 frames/sec) of a stented normal porcine valve also showed that early diastolic stretch and recoil of the leaflets occurs. These results indicate that in the presence of a normal or diseased aoic valve the aoic incisura is produced primarily by valve distension or recoil, respectively. Distension and rebound of the aoic walls do not appear to contribute significantly in the presence of a normal or a diseased valve. Because acquired aoic valve disease affects the magnitude of the central aoic incisura, inspection of the incisura may be of ancillary valve in evaluating the pathologic state of the aoic valve.

ST elevation in two contiguous leads or new LBBB) and appropriateness of reperfusion therapy, which reduces infarct size, LV dysfunction, and moality. * Primary PCI is generally more effective than fibrinolysis and is preferred at experienced centers capable of performing procedure rapidly, especially when diagnosis is in doubt, cardiogenic shock is present, bleeding risk is increased, or if symptoms have been present for \u00013 h. * Proceed with IV fibrinolysis if PCI is not available or if logistics would delay PCI \u00011 h longer than fibrinolysis could be initiated (Fig. 123-1). Dooo- needle time should be \u0005 30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK; maintain a. PTTT at 1. 5-2. 0 control (\u000150-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists \u000190 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different. In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop; (2) nitroglycerin 0. 3 mg SL if systolic bp \u0001 100 mm. Hg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation \u0001 90%). * Mild sedation (e. g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e. g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypertension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp \u0005 95 mm. Hg, heart rate \u0005 50 beats/min, AV block, or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e. g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e. g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e. g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e. g., captopril (6. 25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e. g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias.",

Dyspnea, or the sensation of difficult or uncomfoable breathing, is the most common symptom of left sided heart failure. When a patient with left-sided heart failure lies down, the reduced gravitational force increases venous return to the heart. Because the left ventricle cannot handle the increased load, the blood backs up into the lungs, producing dyspnea. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea specifically refers to a choking sensation that wakens the patient at night. It usually subsides) to 20 minutes after the patient stands up, opens the window, and takes deep breaths. Another finding associated with left-sided heart failure is reduced renal perfusion, which occurs during the day due to the decreased cardiac output. Reduced cardiac output decreases the effective aerial blood volume and the glomerular filtration rate, allowing a greater reabsorption of urea in the proximal tubule. Because creatinine is neither reabsorbed nor secreted in the tubules, a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate causes a minor increase in serum creatinine. The dispropoionate increase in the blood urea nitrogen level over that of the serum creatinine is called prerenal azotemia. Ref - Harrison's principles of internal medicine 20e / pubmed. com",

Essential hypertension tends to be familial and is likely to be the consequence of an interaction between environmental and genetic factors. The prevalence of essential hypertension increases with age, and individuals with relatively high blood pressures at younger ages are at increased risk for the subsequent development of hypertension. It is likely that essential hypertension represents a spectrum disorders with different underlying pathophysiologies.

        "exp": "The peak incidence of aoic dissection is in the sixth and seventh decades. Men are more affected than women by a ratio of 2: 1. The presentations of aoic dissection and its variants are the consequences of intimal tear, dissecting hematoma, occlusion of involved aeries, and compression of adjacent tissues. Acute aoic dissection presents with the sudden onset of pain, which often is described as very severe and tearing and is associated with diaphoresis. The pain may be localized to the front or back of the chest, often the interscapular region, and typically migrates with propagation of the dissection. Other symptoms include syncope, dyspnea, and weakness. Physical findings may include hypertension or hypotension, loss of pulses, aoic regurgitation, pulmonary edema, and neurologic findings due to carotid aery obstruction (hemiplegia, hemianesthesia) or spinal cord ischemia (paraplegia). Bowel ischemia, hematuria, and myocardial ischemia have all been observed. These clinical manifestations reflect complications resulting from the dissection occluding the major aeries. Fuhermore, clinical manifestations may result from the compression of adjacent structures (e. g., superior cervical ganglia, superior vena cava, bronchus, esophagus) by the expanding dissection, causing aneurysmal dilation, and include Horner's syndrome, superior vena cava syndrome, hoarseness, dysphagia, and airway compromise. Hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade may complicate a type A lesion with retrograde dissection. Acute aoic regurgitation is an impoant and common (>50%) complication of proximal dissection. It is the outcome of either a circumferential tear that widens the aoic root or a disruption of the annulus by a dissecting hematoma that tears a leaflet(s) or displaces it, inferior to the line of closure. Signs of aoic regurgitation include bounding pulses, a wide pulse pressure, a diastolic murmur often radiating along the right sternal border, and evidence of congestive heart failure. The clinical manifestations depend on the severity of the regurgitation. ref: Harrison&; s principles of internal medicine, ed 18, pg no 2057",

The bicycle ergometer or the treadmill is currently used for most exercise testing programs. There are various exercise protocols such as the Bruce protocol or the Naughton protocol to assess effo tolerance. In all these protocols the subject is made to exercise in stages of increasing workloads until the end points are achieved. During exercise, various parameters like occurrence of symptoms, fluctuations in blood pressure changes in the ST segment, and changes in cardiac rate and rhythm are closely monitored. Although the stress test is fairly safe, it has to be done only under close medical supervision. Currently the main indications for stress testing are: 1. As a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of symptoms like effo induced chest pain, or palpitation. 2. To assess the prognosis and in the risk stratification of patients with coronary aery disease, either after acute events like myocardial infarction or angina, or after therapeutic interventions like coronary angioplasty or by pass surgery. 3. To assess the functional capacity in patients with ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy and patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 4. As a screening test for ischemic heart disease in subjects with an intermediate or high probability for the disease. The test is considered positive if there is flat or down sloping ST segment depression of 1 mm or more, ST segment elevation, inversion of U waves, fall in blood pressure and ischemic symptoms associated with ECG changes. Standard contraindications to exercise testing include acute myocardial infarction, high risk unstable angina pectoris, severe aoic stenosis, congestive cardiac failure, acute pulmonary embolism or infarction, acute myocarditis or pericarditis, aoic dissection, uncontrolled severe systemic hypertension > 200/100 mm Hg, high grade heart blocks, uncontrolled symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias, any acute systemic illness or an unwilling patient. The indications to terminate exercise testing includes inappropriate drop in blood pressure or deceleration of the heart rate with increasing workload and exercise, moderate to severe angina, sustained VT, ST depression more than 3 mm or ST elevation in non Q leads, hypeensive response > 250/115 mm Hg, patient exhaustion, fatigue, leg cramps or claudication pain and subject's desire to stop the test. Exercise stress testing has a sensitivity of about 80 to 85% and a specificity of 85 to 90% for the diagnosis of coronary aery disease. In patients with ischemic heart disease, positive stress test is an indication for fuher tests such as coronary angiography.",

        "exp": "in Aoic dissection Nitroprusside, esmolol, labetalol etc are those drugs which are more effective when given parenterally. Chronic aoic dissections are associated with weakening of the aoic wall that may lead to the development of aneurysmal dilatation. Aoic dissection is caused by a circumferential or, less frequently, transverse tear of the intima. It often occurs along the right lateral wall of the ascending aoa where the hydraulic shear stress is high. Another common site is the descendingthoracic aoa just below the ligamentum aeriosum. For acute dissection, unless contraindicated, b-adrenergic blockers should be administered parenterally, using intravenous propranolol, metoprolol, or the sho-acting esmolol to achieve a heart rate of approximately 60 beats/min. This should be accompanied by sodium nitroprusside infusion to lower systolic blood pressure to <=120 mm. Hg. Labetalol ( Chap. 247 ), a drug with both b- and a-adrenergic blocking propeies, also may be used as a parenteral agent in acute therapy for dissection. The calcium channel antagonists verapamil and diltiazem may be used intravenously if nitroprusside or b-adrenergic blockers cannot be employed. The addition of a parenteral angiotensinconveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitor such as enalaprilat to a b-adrenergic blocker also may be considered. Isolated use of a direct vasodilator such as hydralazine is contraindicated because these agents can increase hydraulic shear and may propagate the dissection. ref: Harrison&; s principles of internal medicine, ed 18, pg no 2064",

In ventricular tachycardia, the heart beats too fast to effectively pump blood. Ultimately, ventricular tachycardia leads to ventricular fibrillation. In ventricular fibrillation, the electrical activity of the heart becomes chaotic, preventing the ventricle from effectively pumping blood. The fibrillation in the heart decreases over time, and will eventually reach asystole. AEDs, like all defibrillators, are not designed to shock asystole ('flat line' patterns) as this will not have a positive clinical outcome. The asystolic patient only has a chance of survival if, through a combination of CPR and cardiac stimulant drugs, one of the shockable rhythms can be established, which makes it imperative for CPR to be carried out prior to the arrival of a defibrillator.

For people who cannot tolerate beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil can be used, but are potentially harmful in people who also have low blood pressure or severe shoness of breath at rest. These medications also decrease the heart rate, though their use in people with severe outflow obstruction, elevated pulmonary aery wedge pressure, and low blood pressures should be done with caution. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be avoided in people with evidence of obstruction. For people whose symptoms are not relieved by the above treatments, disopyramide can be considered for fuher symptom relief. Diuretics can be considered for people with evidence of fluid overload, though cautiously used in those with evidence of obstruction. People who continue to have symptoms despite drug therapy can consider more invasive therapies.

In addition to hemolysis, there is often pancytopenia and a distinct tendency to venous thrombosis. This triad makes PNH a truly unique clinical condition. Hemolysis in PNH is mainly intravascular and is due to an intrinsic abnormality of the red cell, which makes it exquisitely sensitive to activated C, whether it is activated through the alternative pathway or through an antigen-antibody reaction. The former mechanism is mainly responsible for chronic hemolysis in PNH; the latter explains why the hemolysis can be dramatically exacerbated in the course of a viral or bacterial infection. Hypersusceptibility to C is due to deficiency of several protective membrane proteins, of which CD59 is the most impoant because it hinders the inseion into the membrane of C9 polymers. The molecular basis for the deficiency of these proteins has been pinpointed not to a defect in any of the respective genes, but rather to the shoage of a unique glycolipid molecule, GPI, which, through a peptide bond, anchors these proteins to the surface membrane of cells. The shoage of GPI is due in turn to a mutation in an X-linked gene, called PIG-A, required for an early step in GPI biosynthesis.

After resuscitation, the compliance of the ventricles may remain reduced due to increased interstitial fluid in the myocardium. Therefore, elevated filling pressures are frequently to maintain adequate ventricular performance. Volume resuscitation is initiated with the rapid infusion of either isotonic saline (although care must be taken to avoid hyperchloremic acidosis from loss of bicarbonate buffering capacity and replacement with excess chloride) or a balanced salt solution such as Ringer's lactate (being cognizant of the presence of potassium and potential renal dysfunction) through large-bore intravenous lines.

        "exp": "Occasionally, VT occurs in patients with otherwise healthy heas ('normal heart VT'), usually because of abnormal automaticity in the right ventricular outflow tract or one of the fascicles of the left bundle branch. Ventricular tachycardia Ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurs most commonly in the settings of acute MI, chronic coronary aery disease and cardiomyopathy. It is associated with extensive ventricular disease, impaired left ventricular function and ventricular aneurysm. In these settings, VT may cause haemodynamic compromise or degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. VT is caused by abnormal automaticity or triggered activity in ischaemic tissue, or by re-entry within scarred ventricular tissue. Patients may complain of palpitation or symptoms of low cardiac output, including dyspnoea, lightheadedness and syncope. The ECG shows tachycardia and broad, abnormal QRS complexes with a rate of more than 120/min. It may be difficult to distinguish VT from SVT with bundle branch block or pre-excitation (WPW syndrome) on ECG. A 12-lead ECG or electrophysiology study may help establish the diagnosis. When there is doubt, it is safer to manage the problem as VT. Patients recovering from MI sometimes have periods of idioventricular rhythm ('slow' VT) at a rate only slightly above the preceding sinus rate and below 120/min. These episodes often reflect reperfusion of the infarct territory and may be a good sign. They are usually self-limiting and asymptomatic, and do not require treatment. Other forms of sustained VT require treatment, often as an emergency. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1546",

ST elevation in two contiguous leads or new LBBB) and appropriateness of reperfusion therapy, which reduces infarct size, LV dysfunction, and moality. * Primary PCI is generally more effective than fibrinolysis and is preferred at experienced centers capable of performing procedure rapidly, especially when diagnosis is in doubt, cardiogenic shock is present, bleeding risk is increased, or if symptoms have been present for \u00013 h. * Proceed with IV fibrinolysis if PCI is not available or if logistics would delay PCI \u00011 h longer than fibrinolysis could be initiated (Fig. 123-1). Dooo- needle time should be \u0005 30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK; maintain a. PTTT at 1. 5-2. 0 control (\u000150-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists \u000190 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different. In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop; (2) nitroglycerin 0. 3 mg SL if systolic bp \u0001 100 mm. Hg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation \u0001 90%). * Mild sedation (e. g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e. g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypertension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp \u0005 95 mm. Hg, heart rate \u0005 50 beats/min, AV block, or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e. g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e. g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e. g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e. g., captopril (6. 25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e. g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias.",

This involves the inseion of a needle through the skin and into the pericardium and aspirating fluid under ultrasound guidance preferably. This can be done laterally through the intercostal spaces, usually the fifth, or as a subxiphoid approach. A left parasternal approach begins 3 to 5 cm left of the sternum to avoid the left internal mammary aery, in the 5th intercostal space. Often, a cannula is left in place during resuscitation following initial drainage so that the procedure can be performed again if the need arises. If facilities are available, an emergency pericardial window may be performed instead] during which the pericardium is cut open to allow fluid to drain. Following stabilization of the person, surgery is provided to seal the source of the bleed and mend the pericardium. In people following heart surgery the nurses monitor the amount of chest tube drainage. If the drainage volume drops off, and the blood pressure goes down, this can suggest tamponade due to chest tube clogging. In that case, the person is taken back to the operating room for an emergency reoperation. If aggressive treatment is offered immediately and no complications arise (shock, AMI or arrhythmia, heart failure, aneurysm, carditis, embolism, or rupture), or they are dealt with quickly and fully contained, then adequate survival is still a distinct possibility.

The elements of CPR are the maintenance of ventilation of the lungs and compression of the chest. Mouth-to-mouth respiration may be used if no specific rescue equipment is immediately available (e. g., plastic oropharyngeal airways, esophageal obturators, masked Ambu bag). Conventional ventilation techniques during single-responder CPR require that the lungs be inflated twice in succession after every 30 chest compressions. Recent data suggest that interrupting chest compressions to perform mouth-to-mouth respiration may be less effective than a continuous chest compression strategy. Chest compression is based on the assumption that cardiac compression allows the heart to maintain a pump function by sequential filling and emptying of its chambers, with competent valves maintaining forward direction of flow.

        "exp": "A pneumothorax is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shoness of breath. In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shoage and low blood pressure Unless reversed by effective treatment this can be fatal. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis A primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) tends to occur in a young adult without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms. Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features. People who are affected by a PSP are often unaware of the potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention. PSPs more commonly occur during changes in atmospheric pressure, explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax may happen in clusters. It is rare for a PSP to cause a tension pneumothorax. Secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces (SSPs), by definition, occur in individuals with significant underlying lung disease. Symptoms in SSPs tend to be more severe than in PSPs, as the unaffected lungs are generally unable to replace the loss of function in the affected lungs. Hypoxemia (decreased blood-oxygen levels) is usually present and may be observed as cyanosis (blue discoloration of the lips and skin). Hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood) is sometimes encountered; this may cause confusion and - if very severe - may result in comas. The sudden onset of breathlessness in someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or other serious lung diseases should therefore prompt investigations to identify the possibility of a pneumothorax. Traumatic pneumothorax most commonly occurs when the chest wall is pierced, such as when a stab wound or gunshot wound allows air to enter the pleural space, or because some other mechanical injury to the lung compromises the integrity of the involved structures. Traumatic pneumothoraces have been found to occur in up to half of all cases of chest trauma, with only rib fractures being more common in this group. The pneumothorax can be occult (not readily apparent) in half of these cases, but may enlarge - paicularly if mechanical ventilation is required. They are also encountered in people already receiving mechanical ventilation for some other reason. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1456",

        "exp": "Constrictive pericarditis is a medical condition characterized by a thickened, fibrotic pericardium, limiting the heart&; s ability to function normally. In many cases, the condition continues to be difficult to diagnose and therefore benefits from a good understanding of the underlying cause The pathophysiological characteristics of constrictive pericarditis are due to a thickened, fibrotic pericardium that forms a non-compliant shell around the heart. This shell prevents the heart from expanding when blood enters it. This results in significant respiratory variation in blood flow in the chambers of the heart. During inspiration, pressure in the thoracic cavity decreases but is not relayed to the left atrium, subsequently a reduction in flow to the left atrium and ventricle happens. During diastole, less blood flow in left ventricle allows for more room for filling in right ventricle and therefore a septal shift occurs. During expiration, the amount of blood entering the right ventricle will decrease, allowing the interventricular septum to bulge towards the right ventricle, and increased filling of the left ventricle and subsequent increased pressure generated by the left ventricle during systole. This is known as ventricular interdependence, since the amount of blood flow into one ventricle is dependent on the amount of blood flow into the other ventricle. Signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis are consistent with the following: fatigue, swollen abdomen, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), swelling of legs and general weakness. Related conditions are bacterial pericarditis, pericarditis and pericarditis after a heart attack Diagnosis: The diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is often difficult to make. In paicular, restrictive cardiomyopathy has many similar clinical features to constrictive pericarditis, and differentiating them in a paicular individual is often a diagnostic dilemma. Chest X-Ray - pericardial calcification (common but not specific), pleural effusions are common findings. Echocardiography - the principal echographic finding is changes in cardiac chamber volume. CT and MRI - useful in select cases. BNP blood test - tests for the existence of the cardiac hormone brain natriuretic peptide, which is only present in RCMP but not in CP Conventional cardiac catheterization Physical examination - can reveal clinical features including Kussmaul&; s sign and a pericardial knock Treatment: The definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis is pericardial stripping, which is a surgical procedure where the entire pericardium is peeled away from the heart. This procedure has significant risk involved, with moality rates of 6% or higher in major referral centers. A poor outcome is almost always the result after a pericardiectomy is performed for constrictive pericarditis whose origin was radiation-induced, fuher some patients may develop heart failure post-operatively.

Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

        "exp": "Cyanosis is the bluish or purplish discolouration of the skin or mucous membranes due to the tissues near the skin surface having low oxygen saturation. Based on Lundsgaard and Van Slyke&; s work, it is classically described as occurring if 5. 0 g/dL of deoxyhemoglobin or greater is present. This was based on an estimate of capillary saturation based on a mean of aerial versus peripheral venous blood gas measurements. Since estimation of hypoxia is usually now based either on aerial blood gas measurement or pulse oximetry, this is probably an overestimate, with evidence that levels of 2. 0 g/dL of deoxyhemoglobin may reliably produce cyanosis. Since, however, the presence of cyanosis is dependent upon there being an absolute quantity of deoxyhemoglobin, the bluish color is more readily apparent in those with high hemoglobin counts than it is with those with anemia. Also, the bluer the color, the more difficult it is to detect on deeply pigmented skin. When signs of cyanosis first appear, such as on the lips or fingers, intervention should be made within 3-5 minutes because a severe hypoxia or severe circulatory failure may have induced the cyanosis Approach to diagnosis: Inquire about duration (cyanosis since bih suggests congenital heart disease) and exposures (drugs or chemicals that result in abnormal hemoglobins). Differentiate central from peripheral cyanosis. Check for nail clubbing: Combination of clubbing and cyanosis suggests congenital heart disease and occasionally pulmonary disease. If cyanosis is localized to an extremity, evaluate for peripheral vascular obstruction.

Hypothermia also is used to treat newborns with perinatal asphyxia; however, this aicle focuses on its use in adults. Hypothermia counteracts neuroexcitation in brain cells by stabilizing calcium and glutamate release, reducing the degree of cell death. It also stabilizes the blood-brain barrier and suppresses the inflammatory process, reducing cerebral edema. Cerebral metabolism decreases 6% to 10% for every degree Celsius that body temperature drops. As cerebral metabolism declines, the brain needs less oxygen. In essence, hypothermia counteracts many of the destructive mechanisms of cardiac arrest. Its effects resemble those of cardiac defibrillation, which makes the heart stop and then reset itself to a normal rhythm. Similarly, hypothermia halts destructive brain mechanisms and lets the brain reset itself to normal functioning. Therapeutic hypothermia occurs in three phases--induction, maintenance, and rewarming. Clinicians must control hypothermia and rewarming to prevent potential adverse effects, such as arrhythmias and skin breakdown during the cold phases (induction and maintenance) and rapid electrolyte shifts during the rewarming phase. Temperature should be monitored with a method that measures core temperature, such as use of an esophageal, bladder, or pulmonary aery catheter. REF - pubmed. com, medlineplus. com",

        "exp": "The jugular venous pressure (JVP, sometimes referred to as jugular venous pulse) is the indirectly observed pressure over the venous system visualization of the internal jugular vein. It can be useful in the differentiation of different forms of heart and lung disease. Classically three upward deflections and two downward deflections have been described. The upward deflections are the \"a\" (atrial contraction), \"c\" (ventricular contraction and resulting bulging of tricuspid into the right atrium during isovolumetric systole) and \"v\" = venous filling The downward deflections of the wave are the \"x\" (the atrium relaxes and the tricuspid valve moves downward) and the \"y\" descent (filling of ventricle after tricuspid opening Differentiation from the carotid pulse: The JVP and carotid pulse can be differentiated several ways: multiphasic - the JVP \"beats\" twice (in quick succession) in the cardiac cycle. In other words, there are two waves in the JVP for each contraction-relaxation cycle by the heart. The first beat represents that atrial contraction (termed a) and second beat represents venous filling of the right atrium against a closed tricuspid valve (termed v) and not the commonly mistaken 'ventricular contraction'. These wave forms may be altered by ceain medical conditions; therefore, this is not always an accurate way to differentiate the JVP from the carotid pulse. The carotid aery only has one beat in the cardiac cycle. non-palpable - the JVP cannot be palpated. If one feels a pulse in the neck, it is generally the common carotid aery. occludable - the JVP can be stopped by occluding the internal jugular vein by lightly pressing against the neck. It will fill from above. The jugular venous pulsation has a biphasic waveform. The a wave corresponds to right atrial contraction and ends synchronously with the carotid aery pulse. The peak of the 'a' wave demarcates the end of atrial systole. The x descent follows the 'a' wave and corresponds to atrial relaxation and rapid atrial filling due to low pressure. The c wave corresponds to right ventricular contraction causing the tricuspid valve to bulge towards the right atrium during RV isovolumetric contraction. The x' descent follows the 'c' wave and occurs as a result of the right ventricle pulling the tricuspid valve downward during ventricular systole (ventricular ejection/atrial relaxation). (As stroke volume is ejected, the ventricle takes up less space in the pericardium, allowing relaxed atrium to enlarge). The x' (x prime) descent can be used as a measure of right ventricle contractility. The v wave corresponds to venous filling when the tricuspid valve is closed and venous pressure increases from venous return - this occurs during and following the carotid pulse. The y descent corresponds to the rapid emptying of the atrium into the ventricle following the opening of the tricuspid valve. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 456",

The drugs are thrombolytics and fibrinolytics used in a process called thrombolysis an MI is presented with ECG evidence of an ST elevation known as STEMI, or if a bundle branch block is similarly presented, then reperfusion therapy is necessary. In the absence of an ST elevation, a non-ST elevation MI, known as an NSTEMI, or an unstable angina may be presumed (both of these are indistinguishable on initial evaluation of symptoms). ST elevations indicate a completely blocked aery needing immediate reperfusion. In NSTEMI the blood flow is present but limited by stenosis. In NSTEMI, thrombolytics must be avoided as there is no clear benefit of their use. If the condition stays stable a cardiac stress test may be offered, and if needed subsequent revascularization will be carried out to restore a normal blood flow. If the blood flow becomes unstable an urgent angioplasty may be required. In these unstable cases the use of thrombolytics is contraindicated. At least 10% of treated cases of STEMI do not develop necrosis of the heart muscle. A successful restoration of blood flow is known as aboing the heart attack.

When the AV valves are pulled down by the contracting ventricular muscle, pressure falls rapidly and then rises as blood flows into the atria until the AV valves open early in diastole. The return of the AV valves to their relaxed position also contributes to this pressure rise by reducing atrial capacity. The atrial pressure changes are transmitted to the great veins, producing three characteristic waves in the record of jugular pressure. The a wave is due to atrial systole. As noted above, some blood regurgitates into the great veins when the atria contract. In addition, venous inflow stops, and the resultant rise in venous pressure contributes to the a wave. The c wave is the transmitted manifestation of the rise in atrial pressure produced by the bulging of the tricuspid valve into the atria during isovolumetric ventricular contraction. The v wave mirrors the rise in atrial pressure before the tricuspid valve opens during diastole. The jugular pulse waves are superimposed on the respiratory fluctuations in venous pressure. Venous pressure falls during inspiration as a result of the increased negative intrathoracic pressure and rises again during expiration. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1436",

The major difference between the dialysate used for peritoneal rather than hemodialysis is that the hypeonicity of perito\u0002neal dialysis solutions drives solute and fluid removal, whereas solute removal in hemodialysis depends on concentration gradients, and fluid removal requires transmembrane pressure.

If cardioversion is impossible, drugs that prolong the refractory period of the accessory connection should be used.

However, prolonged sympathetic stimulation leads to cardiac myocyte apoptosis, hyperophy and focal myocardial necrosis. renin also has an essential role in renovascular hypertension. Renovascular hypertension is another renin-mediated form of hypertension. Obstruction of the renal aery leads to decreased renal perfusion pressure, thereby stimulating renin secretion.

In AFib, the heart beats fast and in no regular pattern or rhythm. With AFL, the heart beats fast, but in a regular pattern. The fast, but regular pattern of AFL is what makes it special. AFL makes a very distinct \"sawtooth\" pattern classification: * According to its duration Atrial fibrillation is classified into paroxysmal, persistent or permanent (the three P's). * Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is self-limiting and sinus rhythm restores spontaneously. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation lasts for less than 7 days and does not require intervention to conve to a normal rhythm such as electrical or chemical cardioversion. * Persistent atrial fibrillation lasts for greater than 7 days. The term persistent is used when there is a plan to use a rhythm control strategy and return the patient to sinus rhythm. * Permanent atrial fibrillation is present when atrial fibrillation is present 100% of the time for greater than 7 days and there are no interventions planned to restore sinus rhythm. * Typical Atrial Flutter (Common, or Type | Atrial Flutter) * Involves the IVC(Idioventricular Rhythm) & tricuspid isthmus in the reentry circuit. Can be fuher classified based on the direction of the circuit: C/ Anticlockwise Reentry. This is the commonest form of atrial flutter (90% of cases).

        "exp": "Bundle branch block Damage to the right or left bundle branch of the conducting system can occur as a result of many pathologies, including ischaemic heart disease, hypeensive heart disease and cardiomyopathy. However, right bundle branch block (RBBB) can occur as a normal variant in healthy individuals. In left bundle branch block (LBBB) and RBBB, depolarisation proceeds through a slow myocardial route in the affected ventricle rather than through the rapidly conducting Purkinje tissues that constitute the bundle branches. This causes delayed conduction into the LV or RV, broadens the QRS complex (>=0. 12 sec) and produces characteristic alterations in QRS morphology loss of consciousness that occurs without warning and results in collapse. A brief anoxic seizure (due to cerebral ischaemia) may occur if there is prolonged asystole. There is pallor and a death-like appearance during the attack, but when the heart stas beating again there is a characteristic flush. In distinction to epilepsy, recovery is rapid. Sinoatrial disease and neurocardiogenic syncope may cause similar symptoms. Management This depends on the clinical circumstances. Acute inferior MI is often complicated by transient AV block because the right coronary aery (RCA) supplies the AV node. There is usually a reliable escape rhythm and, if the patient remains well, no treatment is required. Symptomatic second- or third-degree AV block may respond to atropine (0. 6 mg IV, repeated as necessary) or, if this fails, a temporary pacemaker. In most cases, the AV block will resolve within 7-10 days. Second- or third-degree AV heart block complicating acute anterior MI indicates extensive ventricular damage involving both bundle branches and carries a poor prognosis. Asystole may ensue and a temporary pacemaker should be inseed promptly. If the patient presents with asystole, intravenous atropine (3 mg) or intravenous isoprenaline (2 mg in 500 mL 5% dextrose, infused at 10-60 mL/hr) may help to maintain the circulation until a temporary pacing electrode can be inseed.

The host is also primed for a secondary antibody response when viral antigens are released and immune complexes lead to activation of the classic complement pathway, with consequent phlogistic effects. Cross-reactivity at the T cell level results in the release of physiologically active cytokines, including interferon g and tumor necrosis factor a. The induction of vascular permeability and shock depends on multiple factors, Dengue HF is identified by the detection of bleeding tendencies (tourniquet test, petechiae) or ove bleeding in the absence of underlying causes such as preexisting lesions. Dengue shock syndrome, usually accompanied by hemorrhagic signs, is much more serious and results from increased vascular permeability leading to shock. In mild DHF/DSS, restlessness, lethargy, thrombocytopenia (<100, 000/mL), and hemoconcentration are detected 2-5 days after the onset of typical dengue fever, usually at the time of defervescence. The maculopapular rash that often develops in dengue fever may also appear in DHF/DSS. In more severe cases, frank shock is apparent, with low pulse pressure, cyanosis, hepatomegaly, pleural effusions, ascites, and in some cases severe ecchymoses and gastrointestinal bleeding. The period of shock lasts only 1 or 2 days, and most patients respond promptly to close monitoring, oxygen administration, and infusion of crystalloid or--in severe cases--colloid. ref: harrison&; s principles of internal medicine, ed 18, pg no 1913",

In man the antihypeensive activity appears to be due solely to the L-isomer. About twice the dose of the racemate (DL-alpha-methyldopa) is required for equal antihypeensive effect. Methyldopa has no direct effect on cardiac function and usually does not reduce glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, or filtration fraction. Cardiac output usually is maintained without cardiac acceleration. In some patients the heart rate is slowed. Normal or elevated plasma renin activity may decrease in the course of methyldopa therapy. Methyldopa reduces both supine and standing blood pressure. Methyldopa usually produces highly effective lowering of the supine pressure with infrequent symptomatic postural hypotension.

Most commonly used during open heart procedures, if the patient&; s status warrants it, TEE can be used in the setting of any operation. TEE is very useful during many cardiac surgical procedures (e. g., mitral valve repair). It is actually an essential monitoring tool during this procedure. It helps to detect and quantify the disease preoperatively as well as to assess the results of surgery immediately after the procedure. If the repair is found to be inadequate, showing significant residual regurgitation, the surgeon can decide whether to go back to cardiopulmonary bypass to try to correct the defect. Aoic dissections are another impoant condition where TEE is very helpful. TEE can also help the surgeon during the inseion of a catheter for retrograde cardioplegia.

Low risk patients - On observation if the patient remains pain-free with normal ECG and normal levels of cardiac markers, submit them for stress ECG. If the stress test is negative, consider alternative diagnosis. If the stress test is positive, continue medication and invasive testing when required.

A rapid rate of ascent, a history of HAPE, respiratory tract infections, and cold environmental temperatures are risk factors. Men are more susceptible than women.

High-altitude pulmonary edema often can be prevented by use of dexamethasone, calcium channel-blocking drugs, or long-acting inhaled b 2 -adrenergic agonists.

        "exp": "Davidsons Principles and practice of medicine_22. Edition page no 623-624 Aoic regurgitation Aetiology and pathophysiology This condition is due to disease of the aoic valve cusps or dilatation of the aoic root (Box 18. 109). The LV dilates and hyperophies to compensate for the regurgitation. The stroke volume of the LV may eventually be doubled or trebled, and the major aeries are then conspicuously pulsatile. As the disease progresses, left ventricular diastolic pressure rises and breathlessness develops. Clinical features Until the onset of breathlessness, the only symptom may be an awareness of the heart beat. paicularly when lying on the left side, which results from the increased stroke volume. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea is sometimes the first symptom, and peripheral oedema or angina may occur. The characteristic murmur is best heard to the left of the sternum during held expiration. a thrill is rare. A systolic murmur due to the increased stroke volume is common and does not necessarily indicate stenosis. The regurgitant jet causes fluttering of the mitral valve and, if severe, causes paial closure of the anterior mitral leaflet, leading to functional mitral stenosis and a soft mid-diastolic (Austin Flint) murmur. In acute severe regurgitation (e. g. perforation of aoic cusp in endocarditis), there may be no time for compensatory left ventricular hyperophy and dilatation to develop and the features of heart failure may predominate. In this situation, the classical signs of aoic regurgitation may be masked by tachycardia and an abrupt rise in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure; thus, the pulse pressure may be near normal and the diastolic murmur may be sho or even absent. Investigations Regurgitation is detected by Doppler echocardiography. In severe acute aoic regurgitation, the rapid rise in left ventricular diastolic pressure may cause premature mitral valve closure. Cardiac catheterisation and aoography can help in assessing the severity of regurgitation, and dilatation of the aoa and the presence of coexisting coronary aery disease. MRI is useful in assessing the degree and extent of aoic dilatation. Management Treatment may be required for underlying conditions, such as endocarditis or syphilis. Aoic valve replacement is indicated if aoic regurgitation causes symptoms, and this may need to be combined with aoic root replacement and coronary bypass surgery. Those with chronic aoic regurgitation can remain asymptomatic for many years because compensatory ventricular dilatation and hyperophy occur, but should be advised to repo the development of any symptoms of breathlessness or angina. Asymptomatic patients should also be followed up annually with echocardiography for evidence of increasing ventricular size. If this occurs or if the end-systolic dimension increases to 55 mm or more, then aoic valve replacement should be undeaken. Systolic BP should be controlled with vasodilating drugs, such as nifedipine or ACE inhibitors. There is conflicting evidence regarding the need for aoic valve replacement in asymptomatic patients with severe aoic regurgitation. When aoic root dilatation is the cause of aoic regurgitation (e. g. Marfan's syndrome), aoic root replacement is usually necessary. <img alt=\"\" src=\" />",

In accordance with Starling's law, stroke volume and cardiac output rise with the increase in preload. After resuscitation, the compliance of the ventricles. may remain reduced due to increased interstitial fluid in the myocardium. Therefore, elevated filling pressures are frequently required to maintain adequate ventricular performance. Volume resuscitation is initiated with the rapid infusion of either isotonic saline (although care must be taken to avoid hyperchloremic acidosis from loss of bicarbonate buffering capacity and replacement with excess chloride) or a balanced salt solution such as Ringer's lactate (being cognizant of the presence of potassium and potential renal dysfunction) through large-bore intravenous lines. Data, paicularly on severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), regarding benefits of small volumes of hypeonicsaline that more rapidly restore blood pressure are variable, but tend to show improved survival thought to be linked to immunomodulation.

        "question": "In CCF there Is-",
        "exp": "Heart failure symptoms are traditionally and somewhat arbitrarily divided into \"left\" and \"right\" sided, recognizing that the left and right ventricles of the heart supply different poions of the circulation. However, heart failure is not exclusively backward failure (in the pa of the circulation which drains to the ventricle). There are several other exceptions to a simple left-right division of heart failure symptoms. Additionally, the most common cause of right-sided heart failure is left-sided heart failure. The result is that people commonly present with both sets of signs and symptoms. Left-sided failure The left side of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it forward to the systemic circulation (the rest of the body except for the pulmonary circulation). Failure of the left side of the heart causes blood to back up (be congested) into the lungs, causing respiratory symptoms as well as fatigue due to insufficient supply of oxygenated blood. Common respiratory signs are increased rate of breathing and increased work of breathing (non-specific signs of respiratory distress). Rales or crackles, heard initially in the lung bases, and when severe, throughout the lung fields suggest the development of pulmonary edema (fluid in the alveoli). Cyanosis which suggests severe low blood oxygen, is a late sign of extremely severe pulmonary edema. Additional signs indicating left ventricular failure include a laterally displaced apex beat (which occurs if the heart is enlarged) and a gallop rhythm (additional heart sounds) may be heard as a marker of increased blood flow or increased intra-cardiac pressure. Heart murmurs may indicate the presence of valvular heart disease, either as a cause (e. g. aoic stenosis) or as a result (e. g. mitral regurgitation) of the heart failure. Backward failure of the left ventricle causes congestion of the lungs' blood vessels, and so the symptoms are predominantly respiratory in nature. Backward failure can be subdivided into the failure of the left atrium, the left ventricle or both within the left circuit. The person will have dyspnea (shoness of breath) on exeion and in severe cases, dyspnea at rest. Increasing breathlessness on lying flat, called ohopnea, occurs. It is often measured in the number of pillows required to lie comfoably, and in ohopnea, the person may reso to sleeping while sitting up. Another symptom of heart failure is paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea: a sudden nighttime attack of severe breathlessness, usually several hours after going to sleep. Easy fatigability and exercise intolerance are also common complaints related to respiratory compromise. \"Cardiac asthma\" or wheezing may occur. Compromise of left ventricular forward function may result in symptoms of poor systemic circulation such as dizziness, confusion and cool extremities at rest Right-sided heart failure is often caused by pulmonary heart disease (cor pulmonale), which is typically caused by difficulties of the pulmonary circulation, such as pulmonary hypertension or pulmonic stenosis. Physical examination may reveal pitting peripheral edema, ascites, liver enlargement, and spleen enlargement. Jugular venous pressure is frequently assessed as a marker of fluid status, which can be accentuated by eliciting hepatojugular reflux. If the right ventricular pressure is increased, a parasternal heave may be present, signifying the compensatory increase in contraction strength. Backward failure of the right ventricle leads to congestion of systemic capillaries. This generates excess fluid accumulation in the body. This causes swelling under the skin (termed peripheral edema or anasarca) and usually affects the dependent pas of the body first (causing foot and ankle swelling in people who are standing up, and sacral edema in people who are predominantly lying down). Nocturia (frequent nighttime urination) may occur when fluid from the legs is returned to the bloodstream while lying down at night. In progressively severe cases, ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity causing swelling) and liver enlargement may develop. Significant liver congestion may result in impaired liver function (congestive hepatopathy), and jaundice and even coagulopathy (problems of decreased or increased blood clotting) may occur. Biventricular failure Dullness of the lung fields to finger percussion and reduced breath sounds at the bases of the lung may suggest the development of a pleural effusion (fluid collection between the lung and the chest wall). Though it can occur in isolated left- or right-sided heart failure, it is more common in biventricular failure because pleural veins drain into both the systemic and pulmonary venous systems. When unilateral, effusions are often right sided. If a person with a failure of one ventricle lives long enough, it will tend to progress to failure of both ventricles. For example, left ventricular failure allows pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension to occur, which increase stress on the right ventricle. Right ventricular failure is not as deleterious to the other side, but neither is it harmless. There is mounting evidence that chronic kidney disease itself is a major contributor to severe cardiac damage and, conversely, that congestive heart failure is a major cause of progressive chronic kidney disease(oligouria)..

In this case, it is manifested as a delta wave, which is a slurred upstroke in the QRS complex that is associated with a sho PR interval. The sho PR interval and slurring of the QRS complex are reflective of the impulse making it to the ventricles early ( the accessory pathway) without the usual delay experienced in the AV node. If a person with WPW experiences episodes of atrial fibrillation, the ECG shows a rapid polymorphic wide-complex tachycardia (without torsades de pointes). This combination of atrial fibrillation and WPW is considered dangerous, and most antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1546 When an individual is in normal sinus rhythm, the ECG characteristics of WPW are a sho PR interval (less than 120 milliseconds in duration), widened QRS complex (greater than 120 milliseconds in duration) with slurred upstroke of the QRS complex, and secondary repolarization changes (reflected in ST segment-T wave changes). In individuals with WPW, electrical activity that is initiated in the SA node travels through the accessory pathway, as well as through the AV node to activate the ventricles both pathways. Since the accessory pathway does not have the impulse slowing propeies of the AV node, the electrical impulse first activates the ventricles the accessory pathway, and immediately afterwards the AV node. This gives the sho PR interval and slurred upstroke of the QRS complex known as the delta wave. In case of type A pre-excitation (left atrioventricular connections), a positive R wave is seen in V1 (\"positive delta\") on the precordial leads of the electrocardiogram, while in type B pre-excitation (right atrioventricular connections), a predominantly negative delta wave is seen in lead V1 (\"negative delta\" Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 468",

Often it stas as brief periods of abnormal beating which become longer and possibly constant over time. Often episodes have no symptoms. Occasionally there may be heart palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, shoness of breath, or chest pain. The disease is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke. It is a type of supraventricular tachycardia Leads V4 and V5 of an electrocardiogram showing atrial fibrillation with somewhat irregular intervals between heart beats, no P waves, and a heart rate of about 150 BPM. High blood pressure and valvular heart disease are the most common alterable risk factors for AF. Other heart-related risk factors include heart failure, coronary aery disease, cardiomyopathy, and congenital heart disease. In the developing world valvular heart disease often occurs as a result of rheumatic fever. Lung-related risk factors include COPD, obesity, and sleep apnea. Other factors include excess alcohol intake, tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, and thyrotoxicosis. However, half of cases are not associated with any of these risks.

However, if the arrhythmia continues, the affected person may experience a cardiac arrest leading to sudden death. The arrhythmias that lead to faints and sudden death are more likely to occur in response to specific circumstances, in pa determined by which genetic variant is responsible for the condition. While arrhythmias can occur at any time, in some forms of LQTS arrhythmias are more commonly seen in response to exercise or mental stress (LQT1), in other forms following a sudden loud noise (LQT2), and in some forms during sleep or immediately upon waking (LQT3).

Onset may be rapid or gradual. Symptoms typically include those of cardiogenic shock including shoness of breath, weakness, lightheadedness, and cough. Other s relate to the underlying cause Cardiac tamponade is caused by a large or uncontrolled pericardial effusion, i. e. the buildup of fluid inside the pericardium. This commonly occurs as a result of chest trauma (both blunt and penetrating), but can also be caused by myocardial rupture, cancer, uremia, pericarditis, or cardiac surgery, and rarely occurs during retrograde aoic dissection, or while the person is taking anticoagulant therapy. The effusion can occur rapidly (as in the case of trauma or myocardial rupture), or over a more gradual period of time (as in cancer). The fluid involved is often blood, but pus is also found in some circumstances. Causes of increased pericardial effusion include hypothyroidism, physical trauma (either penetrating trauma involving the pericardium or blunt chest trauma), pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium), iatrogenic trauma (during an invasive procedure), and myocardial rupture. Surgery One of the most common settings for cardiac tamponade is in the first 24 to 48 hours after heart surgery. After heart surgery, chest tubes are placed to drain blood. These chest tubes, however, are prone to clot formation. When a chest tube becomes occluded or clogged, the blood that should be drained can accumulate around the heart, leading to tamponade Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 460",
