CO2 is 16( low )that cannot explain acidotic PH (normal pco2 40) HCO3 is 6. 2 which is low that explain low pH. therefore acidic pH is metabolic problem. i. e. metabolic acidosis in this CASE compensation is going on which is hyperventilation leading to CO2 washout. low PCo2 since is PH is not normalised so paial compensation From ABG: metabolic acidosis paially compensated. expected PCO2 =15+HCO3=15+6=21 actual PCO2 is almost equal to expected value this implies compensation is going fine.",
