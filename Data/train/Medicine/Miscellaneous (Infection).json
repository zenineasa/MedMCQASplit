        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Reiter's syndrome Arthropathy following a recent leisure trip suggests reactive arthritis.Eye involvement points towards Reiter's syndrome.Reactive arthritis refers to acute nonpurulent arthritis, complicating an infection elsewhere in the body.Reiter's syndrome is one of the classic forms of reactive arthritis i.e. an aseptic inflammatory arthritis associated with nonspecific urogenital or bowel infection (with manifestations in the eye).Reactive arthritis is frequently associated with the human leucocyte antigen B27 (HLA - B27) Q haplotype.The etiology of reactive arthritis remains uncertain. The most accepted theory about the pathophysiology of reactive arthritis involves initial activation by a microbial antigen followed by an autoimmune reaction that involves skin, eyes and joints.Two forms of reactive arthritis have been recognized a sexually transmitted form and a dysenteric form.Gastrointestinal infections with, Shigella Q, salmonella Q and Campylobacter species and genitourinary infections with chlamydia trachomatis Q have been found to trigger reactive arthritis.The characteristic triad of Reiter's syndromeArthritis Q {polyarthritis, non erosive)Urethritis QConjunctivitis Q",

(a) Protein MisfoldingRef: Harrison 19th ed. / 444e-9* When a prion enters a healthy organism, it induces existing, properly folded proteins to convert into the misfolded prion form. In this way, the prion acts as a template to guide the misfolding of more proteins into prion form.* All known mammalian prion diseases are caused by the prion protein, PrP. The endogenous, properly folded form is denoted PrPc (for Common or Cellular), whereas the disease-linked, misfolded form is denoted as PrPSc (for Scrapie, after one of the diseases first linked to prions and neurodegeneration.)* The precise structure of the prion is not known, though they can be formed by combining PrPc, polyadenylic acid, and lipids in a Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) reaction",

Intensive blood glucose monitoring and prevention of hyperglycemia improves survival in critically ill patients (Ref: Harrison 19/e p1751, 18/e p2954-2957)Low tidal volume during assisted ventilation prevents acute lung injury:The results of recent studies favor the use of low tidal volumes 6 mL/kg of ideal body weight as low as 4mL/kg if plateau pressure exceeds 30 cm H2O in order to reduce the risk of ventilator induced Acute Lung Injury (ALI).For optimal (outcome) of goal-oriented management of sepsis patients, monitoring of central venous pressure, hourly urine output and blood pressure is adequate:Circulatory adequacy is assessed by measurement of arterial blood pressure and monitoring of parameters such as mentation, urine output and skin perfusion.To avoid pulmonary edema CVP should be maintained at 8-12 cm H2O.Intensive blood glucose monitoring and prevention of hyperglycemia improves survival in critically ill patients:The role of tight control of blood glucose concentration in recovery from critical illness has been addressed in numerous controlled trials.Meta analysis of these trials have concluded that use of insulin to lower blood glucose levels to 100-120 mg/dL is potentially harmful and does not improve survival rates.Most experts now recommend using insulin only if it is needed to maintain the blood glucose concentration below 150 mg/dL.Patients receiving insulin must be monitored frequently every 1-2 h for hypoglycemia.The use of drotrecogin-alpha is restricted to severely ill patients with APACHE score > 25:Drotecogin-alpha (activated protein C) was the first drug to be approved by US FDA for treatment of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.Approval was based on the result of single RCT in which drug was given within 24 hrs.Of the patient's first sepsis related organ dysfunction: 28 day survival rate was significantly higher among recipients who were very sick APACHE II score >25.Subsequent trails failed to show any benefit in patients less sick APACHE II score < 25 or in children.",
