The ureter is normally attached to the bladder in an oblique direction perforating the bladder muscle (detrusor) laterally, and proceeding between the bladder mucosa and detrusor muscle, creating a flap valve mechanism that prevents reflux. Reflux occurs when the submucosal tunnel between the mucosa and detrusor muscle is short or absent. Reflux predisposes to renal infection (pyelonephritis) by facilitating the transport of urine from bladder to the upper urinary tract. The inflammatory reaction caused by a pyelonephritic infection may result in renal injury or scarring also termed reflux nephropathy. Patients with pyelonephritis and reflux nephropathy who develop proteinuria in advanced stages exhibit secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. This lesion is characterized by sclerosis of some but not all glomeruli (thus, it is focal) and in the affected glomeruli, only a portion of the capillary tuft is involved (thus it is segmental). It accounts for 10%-35% cases of nephrotic syndrome. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis occurs in the following settings: In association with other known conditions such as. HIV infection (HIV nephropathy), Heroin addiction (heroin nephropathy)* Sickle cell disease. Massive obesity. As a secondary event, reflectingglomerular scarring in cases of focal glomerulonephritis.

The most sensitive method to detect microalbuminuria is by radioimmunoassay. The renal biopsy is the only test of the effect of diabetes on the kidney that is more sensitive than microalbuminuria. Microalbuminuria is defined as 30-300 mg/d in a 24-h collection or 30-300 mg/mg creatinine in a spot collection (preferred method). Once macroalbuminuria is present, there is a steady decline in GFR, and -50% of individuals reach ESRD in 7-10years. Once macroalbuminuria develops, blood pressure rises slightly and the pathologic changes are likely irreversible. The nephropathy that develops in type 2 DM differs from that of type 1 DM in the following respects: Microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria may be present when type 2 DM is diagnosed, reflecting its long asymptomatic period.

In clinical practice creatinine clearance or estimates of creatinine clearance based on the serum creatinine level are used to measure GFR. Creatinine is produced naturally by the body (creatinine is a break-down product of creatine phosphate, which is found in muscle). It is freely filtered by the glomerulus, but also actively secreted by the peritubular capillaries in very small amounts such that creatinine clearance overestimates actual GFR by 10-20%Creatinine clearance (Cc) is calculated from the creatinine concentration in the collected urine sample (U ), urine flow rate (V), and the plasma concentration (P ). Since the product of urine concentration and urine flow rate yields creatinine excretion rate, which is the rate of removal from the blood, creatinine clearance is calculated as removal rate per min (U x V) divided by the plasma creatinine concentration. This Is commonly represented mathematically as. Note: The most accurate determination of GFR is by inulin clearance. CCr =UCr x VPCr",

Collansine elomerulopathv is actually an aggressive form of \"focal seemental glomerulosclerosis\".

NRef: Harrison 19th ed. /1837* Acute glomerulonephritis (GN) comprises a specific set of renal diseases in which an immunologic mechanism triggers inflammation and proliferation of glomerular tissue that can result in damage to the basement membrane, mesangium, or capillary endothelium.* Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is the archetype of acute GN. Acute nephritic syndrome is the most serious and potentially devastating form of the various renal syndromes.* Most often, the patient is a boy, aged 2-14 years, who suddenly develops puffiness of the eyelids and facial edema in the setting of a post-streptococcal infection. The urine is dark and scanty, and the blood pressure may be elevate* Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is defined as any glomerular disease characterized by extensive crescents (usually >50%) as the principal histologic finding and by a rapid loss of renal function (usually a 50% decline in the glomerular filtration rate within 3 mo) as the clinical correlate.",
