Other factors likely to be impoant in the behaviour of airway smooth muscle include the degree of airway narrowing and neurogenic mechanisms. The relationship between atopy (the propensity to produce IgE) and asthma is well established and in many individuals there is a clear relationship between sensitisation and allergen exposure, as demonstrated by skin-prick reactivity or elevated serum-specific IgE. Common examples of allergens include house dust mites, pets such as cats and dogs, pests such as cockroaches, and fungi. Inhalation of an allergen into the airway is followed by an early and late-phase bronchoconstrictor response. Allergic mechanisms are also implicated in some cases of occupational asthma. In cases of aspirin-sensitive asthma, the ingestion of salicylates results in inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes, preferentially shunting the metabolism of arachidonic acid through the lipoxygenase pathway with resultant production of the asthmogenic cysteinyl leukotrienes. In exercise-induced asthma, hyperventilation results in water loss from the pericellular lining fluid of the respiratory mucosa, which, in turn, triggers mediator release. Heat loss from the respiratory mucosa may also be impoant. In persistent asthma, a chronic and complex inflammatory response ensues, characterised by an influx of numerous inflammatory cells, the transformation and paicipation of airway structural cells, and the secretion of an array of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Examination of the inflammatory cell profile in induced sputum samples demonstrates that, although asthma is predominantly characterised by airway eosinophilia, neutrophilic inflammation predominates in some patients while in others scant inflammation is observed: so-called 'pauci- granulocytic' asthma.

For patients with mild intermittent asthma (symptoms less than once a week for 3 months and fewer than two nocturnal episodes per month), it is usually sufficient to prescribe an inhaled sho-acting b2-agonist, such as salbutamol or terbutaline, to be used as required. However, many patients (and their physicians) under-estimate the severity of asthma. A history of a severe exacerbation should lead to a step-up in treatment.

For adults, a reasonable staing dose is 400 ug beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) or equivalent per day in adults, although higher doses may be required in smokers. Alternative but much less effective preventive agents include chromones, leukotriene receptor antagonists and theophyllines. The preferred asthma medications are sho-acting beta-2 agonists such asalbuterol. Taken 10 minutes before exercise, thesemedicationscan prevent the airways from contracting and help control exercise-induced asthma.

When initial assessment with chest examination and radiograph is normal, cough-variant asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, nasopharyngeal drainage, and medications (ACE inhibitors) are the most common causes of chronic cough.

In ARDS-pulmonary edema, hea size is normal, alveolar infiltrates are distributed more uniformly throughout the lungs, and pleural effusions are uncommon. Finally, the hypoxaemia of cardiogenic pulmonary edema is largely due to V/Q mismatch and responds to athe administration of supplemental oxygen.

It may occur in isolation and be called cryptogenic or idiopathic, in which case the clinical manifestations are mainly respiratory, or it may be associated with other disorders, such as rheumatoid ahritis. The histopathologic abnormalities of the pulmonary tissue are identical in either instance. Other names used for the disease have included usual interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia and the Hamman-Rich syndrome; these terms may describe different stages of the same pathologic process. Many authors in Noh America and those in the United Kingdom our the term fibrosing alveolitis when describing chronic interstitial pneumonias. There may be accompanying nonspecific Immunologic abnormalities, which may denote that fibrosing alveolitis is pa of the wide spectrum of diseases known as connective tissue disorders. Recently immune complexes have been found in the lung parenchyma; they probably result in the granulocyte destruction and reticuloendothelial proliferation seen in the acute phase of the disease. There are no specific diagnostic tests for the disease apa from lung biopsy, which can be performed at the time of thoracotomy or transbronchially, with the use of a flexible fibreoptic bronchoscope. Lavaged cells from the alveoli have also been obtained the bronchoscope; in persons with fibrosing alveolitis a high propoion of these cells are neutrophils, and after coicosteroid treatment the propoion decreases. The progress of the disease can be followed by examination of these washings as well as by lung scanning with gallium-67 citrate. Newer methods of treatment using combinations of coicosteroids and immunosuppressant drugs are being evaluated and are initially proving to be successful. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 616",

Although sarcoidosis can affect viually every organ of the body, the lung is most commonly affected. Studies suggest that a mycobacterium similar to M. tuberculosis could be responsible for sarcoidosis. Hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria occurs in about 10% of sarcoidosis patients. The mechanism of abnormal calcium metabolism is increased production of 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D by the granuloma itself. The 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D causes increased intestinal absorption of calcium, leading to hypercalcemia with a suppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. A specific complex of involvement of the bridge of the nose, the area beneath the eyes, and the cheeks is referred to as lupus pernio and is diagnostic for a chronic form of sarcoidosis.

In the absence of shock, the benefits are less clear but thrombolysis may be considered in those presenting with right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis or severe hypoxaemia. Patients must be screened carefully for haemorrhagic risk, as there is a high risk of intracranial haemorrhage. Surgical pulmonary embolectomy may be considered in selected patients but carries a high moality. Caval filters A patient in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated, who has suffered massive haemorrhage on anticoagulation, or recurrent VTE despite anticoagulation, should be considered for an inferior vena caval filter. Retrievable caval filters are paicularly useful in individuals with temporary risk factors. The caval filter should be used only until anticoagulation can be safely initiated, at which time the filter should be removed if possible. General measures Prompt recognition and treatment are potentially life-saving. Sufficient oxygen should be given to hypoxaemic patients to maintain aerial oxygen saturation above 90%. Circulatory shock should be treated with intravenous fluids or plasma expander, but inotropic agents are of limited value as the hypoxic dilated right ventricle is already close to maximally stimulated by endogenous catecholamines. Diuretics and vasodilators should also be avoided, as they will reduce cardiac output. Opiates may be necessary to relieve pain and distress but should be used with caution in the hypotensive patient.

Crackles are more commonly a sign of alveolar disease. Processes that fill the alveoli with fluid may result in crackles. Fine localised crackles are a sign of parenchymal infiltration. Fine end inspiratory crackles over both lung bases may be an early sign of LVF. Coarse crackles are seen in gross pulmonary edema. MECHANISM OF CRACKLES: Bubbling or flow of air through secretions in the bronchial level. sudden opening of successive bronchioles and alveoli with rapid equalisation of pressure causing a sequence of explosive sounds. Crackles without sputum production indicates interstitial lung disease. Crackles with sputum production indicate parenchymal lung disease.

Reduced strength can be due to impaired neuromuscular transmission(eg., myasthenia gravis, Guillen-Barre syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, phrenic nerve injury) or respiratory muscle weakness(eg., myopathy, electrolyte derangements, fatigue). The overload on respiratory system can be due to increased resistive loads(bronchospasm in asthma, COPD), reduced lung compliance(alveolar edema, atelectasis), reduced chest wall compliance (pneumothorax, pleural effusion) & due to increased minute ventilation requirements(eg., pulmonary embolus with increased dead space fraction, sepsis) Ref: Harrison's medicine-18th edition, page no: 2200.",

In silicosis, the large fibrotic nodules undergo central necrosis from ischemia. Fuhermore, silicosis predisposes patients to the development of TB within the fibrotic nodules, thus producing cavitation. Ectopic secretion of a parathormone-like peptide producing hypercalcemia is seen only in squamous cell carcinoma. Scar carcinomas are a possible sequela of old scar tissue in TB. Adenocarcinomas are more frequently associated with scar carcinomas than squamous carcinoma. The most common extrapulmonary site for TB is the kidneys, and the adrenal gland is the most common site for metastatic squamous cancer.

        "exp": "Bulging fissure sign in x ray seen in klebsiella. image shows bulging fissure sign Clinical features Pneumonia, paicularly lobar pneumonia, usually presents as an acute illness. Systemic features, such as fever, rigors, shivering and malaise, predominate and delirium may be present. The appetite is invariably lost and headache frequently repoed. Pulmonary symptoms include cough, which at first is characteristically sho, painful and dry, but later is accompanied by the expectoration of mucopurulent sputum. Rust-coloured sputum may be produced by patients with Strep. pneumoniae infection and the occasional patient may repo haemoptysis Pleuritic chest pain may be a presenting feature and on occasion may be referred to the shoulder or anterior abdominal wall. Upper abdominal tenderness is sometimes apparent in patients with lower lobe pneumonia or those with associated hepatitis. Less typical presentations may be seen in the very young and the elderly. While different organisms often give rise to a similar clinical and radiological picture, it may be possible to infer the likely agent from the clinical context. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is more common in young people and rare in the elderly, whereas Haemophilus influenzae is more common in the elderly, paicularly if underlying lung disease is present. Legionella pneumophila occurs in local outbreaks centred on contaminated cooling towers in hotels, hospitals and other industries. Staph. aureus is more common following an episode of influenza. Klebsiella pneumonia has a specific association with alcohol abuse and often presents with a paicularly severe bacteraemic illness. Recent foreign travel raises the possibility of infections that may otherwise be unusual in the UK, e. g. MERS-coronavirus (Middle East ), melioidosis caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei (South-east Asia and nohern Australia and endemic fungal infection (Noh, Central or South America.

Clinical examination should first focus on the respiratory and pulse rates, blood pressure and an assessment of the mental state, as these are impoant in forming a judgement as to severity of the illness. Chest signs vary, depending on the inflammatory response, which proceeds through stages of acute exudation, red and then grey hepatisation, and finally resolution. When consolidated, the lung is typically dull to percussion and, as conduction of sound is enhanced, auscultation reveals bronchial breathing and whispering pectoriloquy; crackles are heard throughout. An assessment of the state of nutrition is impoant, paicularly in the elderly. The presence of herpes labialis may point to streptococcal infection, as may the finding of 'rusty' sputum.

        "exp": "COPD should be suspected in any patient over the age of 40 years who presents with symptoms of chronic bronchitis and/or breathlessness. Depending on the presentation, impoant differential diagnoses include chronic asthma, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis and congestive cardiac failure. Cough and associated sputum production are usually the first symptoms, and are often referred to as a 'smoker's cough'. Haemoptysis may complicate exacerbations of COPD but should not be attributed to COPD without thorough investigation. Breathlessness usually prompts presentation to a health professional. The level should be quantified for future reference, often by documenting what the patient can manage beforestopping; scales such as the modified Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea scale may be useful. Inadvanced disease, enquiry should be made as to the presence of oedema ( which may be seen for the first time during an exacerbation) and morning headaches (which may suggest hypercapnia). Physical signs are non-specific, correlate poorly with lung function, and are seldom obvious until the disease is advanced. Breath sounds are typically quiet; crackles may accompany infection but, if persistent, raise the possibility of bronchiectasis. Finger clubbing is not a feature of COPD and should trigger fuher investigation for lung cancer or fibrosis. Right heart failure may develop in patients with advanced COPD paicularly if there is coexisting sleep apnoea or thromboembolic disease ('cor pulmonale'). However, even in the absence of heart failure, COPD patients often have pitting oedema from salt and water retention caused by renal hypoxia and hypercapnia. The term 'cor pulmonale' is a misnomer in such patients, as they do not have heart failure. Fatigue, anorexia and weight loss may point to the development of lung cancer or tuberculosis, but are common in patients with severe COPD and the body mass index (BMI) is of prognostic significance. Depression and anxiety are also common and contribute to morbidity. Two classical phenotypes have been described: 'pink puffers' and 'blue bloaters'. The former are typically thin and breathless, and maintain a normal Pa. CO2 until the late stage of disease. The latter develop (or tolerate) hypercapnia earlier and may develop oedema and secondary polycythaemia. In practice, these phenotypes often overlap. Investigations Although there are no reliable radiographic signs that correlate with the severity of airflow limitation, a chest X-ray is essential to identify alternative diagnoses such as cardiac failure, other complications of smoking such as lung cancer, and the presenceof bullae. A blood count is useful to exclude anemia or document polycythaemia, and in younger patients with predominantly basal emphysema a1-antitrypsin should be assayed. The diagnosis requires objective demonstration of airflowobstruction by spirometry and is established when the post- bronchodilator FEV1/FVC is <70%. The severity of COPD may be defined in relation to the post-bronchodilator FEV1. Measurement of lung volumes provides an assessment of hyperinflation. This is generally performed by helium dilution technique; however, in patients with severe COPD, and in paicular large bullae, body plethysmography is preferred because the use of helium may under-estimate lung volumes. The presence of emphysema is suggested by a low gas transfer. Exercise tests provide an objective assessment of exercise tolerance and provide a baseline on which to judge the response to bronchodilator therapy or rehabilitation programmes; they may also be valuable when assessing prognosis. Pulse oximetry may prompt referral for a domiciliary oxygen assessment if less than 93%. The assessment of health status by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) is commonly used for research. In practice, the COPD Assessment Test and the COPD Control Questionnaire are easier to administer. HRCT is likely to play an increasing role in the assessment of COPD, as it allows the detection, Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 575",

        "question": "Bronchial asthma is definitely diagnosed by-",
        "exp": "Diagnosis The diagnosis of asthma is predominantly clinical and is based on the combination of the history, lung function and 'other' tests, which allows high, intermediate or low probability of asthma to emerge. The approach may vary from patient to patient and may need to be re-evaluated following the introduction of treatment. Suppoive evidence is provided by the demonstration of variable airflow obstruction, preferably by using spirometry to measure FEV1 and FVC. This identifies the obstructive defect, defines its severity, and provides a baseline for bronchodilator reversibility. If spirometry is not available, a peak flow meter may be used. Symptomatic patients should be instructed to record peak flow readings after rising in the morning and before retiring in the evening. A diurnal variation in PEF of more than 20% (the lowest values typically being recorded in the morning) is considered diagnostic, and the magnitude of variability provides some indication of disease severity. A trial of glucocoicoids (e. g. 30 mg daily for 2 weeks) may be useful in establishing the diagnosis, by demonstrating an improvement in either FEV1 or PEF. It is not uncommon for patients whose symptoms are suggestive of asthma to have normal lung function. In these circumstances, the demonstration of AHR by challenge tests may be useful to confirm the diagnosis. AHR has a high negative predictive value but positive results may be seen in other conditions, such as COPD, bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis. The use of exercise tests is useful when symptoms are predominantly related to exercise. The diagnosis may be suppoed by the presence of atopy demonstrated by skin-prick tests or measurement of total and allergen-specific IgE, an FENO (a surrogate of eosinophilic airway inflammation) of >=40pas per billion in a glucocoicoid-naive adult, or a peripheral blood eosinophilia. Chest X-ray appearances are often normal but lobar collapse may be seen if mucus occludes a large bronchus and, if accompanied by the presence of flitting infiltrates, may suggest that asthma has been complicated by allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. A high-resolution CT scan (HRCT) may be useful to detect bronchiectasis. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 569",

        "exp": "Bronchodilators Bronchodilator therapy is central to the management of breathlessness. The inhaled route is preferred and a number of different agents delivered by a variety of devices are available. Choice should be informed by patient preference and inhaler assessment. Sho-acting bronchodilators may be used for patients with mild disease but longer-acting bronchodilators are usually more appropriate for those with moderate to severe disease. Significant improvements in breathlessness may be repoed despite minimal changes in FEV1, probably reflecting improvements in lung emptying that reduce dynamic hyperinflation and ease the work of breathing. Oral bronchodilator therapy, such as theophylline preparations, may be contemplated in patients who cannot use inhaled devices efficiently but their use may be limited by side-effects, unpredictable metabolism and drug interactions; hence the requirement to monitor plasma levels. Orally active, highly selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors remain under appraisal. Combined inhaled glucocoicoids and bronchodilators The fixed combination of an inhaled glucocoicoid and a LABA improves lung function, reduces the frequency and severity of exacerbations and improves quality of life. These advantages may be accompanied by an increased risk of pneumonia, paicularly in the elderly. LABA/inhaled glucocoicoid combinations are frequently given with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). LAMAs should be used with caution in patients with significant heart disease or a history of urinary retention. Oral glucocoicoids Oral glucocoicoids are useful during exacerbations but maintenance therapy contributes to osteoporosis and impaired skeletal muscle function, and should be avoided. Oral glucocoicoid trials assist in the diagnosis of asthma but do not predict response to inhaled glucocoicoids in COPD. Pulmonary rehabilitation Exercise should be encouraged at all stages and patients reassured that breathlessness, while distressing, is not dangerous. Multidisciplinary programmes that incorporate physical training, disease education and nutritional counselling reduce symptoms, improve health status and enhance confidence. Most programmes include two to three sessions per week, last between 6 and 12 weeks, and are accompanied by demonstrable and sustained improvements in exercise tolerance and health status. Oxygen therapy Long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival in selected patients with COPD complicated by severe hypoxaemia (aerial Pa. O2 < 7. 3 k. Pa (55 mm. Hg)). It is most conveniently provided by an oxygen concentrator and patients should be instructed to use oxygen for a minimum of 15 hours/ day; greater benefits are seen in those who use it for more than 20 hours/day. The aim of therapy is to increase the Pa. O2 to at least 8 k. Pa (60 mm. Hg) or Sa. O2 to at least 90%. Ambulatory oxygen therapy should be considered in patients who desaturate on exercise and show objective improvement in exercise capacity and/or dyspnoea with oxygen. Oxygen flow rates should be adjusted to maintain Sa. O2 above 90%. Surgical intervention Bullectomy may be considered when large bullae compress surrounding normal lung tissue. Patients with predominantly upper lobe emphysema, preserved gas transfer and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension may benefit from lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), in which peripheral emphysematous lung tissue is resected with the aim of reducing hyperinflation and decreasing the work of breathing. Both bullectomy and LVRS can be performed thorascopically, minimising morbidity. Lung transplantation may benefit carefully selected patients with advanced disease (p. 567). Other measures Patients with COPD should be offered an annual influenza vaccination and, as appropriate, pneumococcal vaccination. Obesity, poor nutrition, depression and social isolation should be identified and, if possible, improved. Mucolytic agents are occasionally used but evidence of benefit is limited. Palliative care Addressing end-of-life needs is an impoant, yet often ignored, aspect of care in advanced disease. Morphine preparations may be used for palliation of breathlessness in advanced disease and benzodiazepines in low dose may reduce anxiety. Decisions regarding resuscitation should be addressed in advance of critical illnes Magnesium sulfate is a bronchodilator. It relaxes the bronchial muscles and expands the airways, allowing more air to flow in and out of the lungs. This can relieve symptoms of asthma, such as shoness of breath. initial loading dose 2 gm over a period of 20 minutes where infused Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 577",
