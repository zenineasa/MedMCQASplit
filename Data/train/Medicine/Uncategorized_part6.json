This applies equally to: Patients with CKD (stages 1-5) developing anemia Patients with CKD stage 5 treated with haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) Transplant patients with chronic renal insufficiency and anemia. Strategies for treatment of Anemia in Chronic Renal Failure Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have emerged as the treatment of choice for anemia in chronic renal disease. They should be given to all patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with hemoglobin (Hb) levels consistently below 11 g/dl All chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with renal anemia undergoing treatment with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) should be given supplementary iron to maintain adequate bone marrow iron stores Intravenous administration is the optimum route for the delivery of iron to patients with CKD, as oral iron is poorly absorbed in uremic individuals. Blood Transfusion Red blood cell transfusions should be avoided, if at all possible, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those awaiting kidney transplantation. Transfusions should not be given unless patients have one or more of the following: Symptomatic anemia (fatigue, angina, dyspnoea) and/or associated risk factors (diabetes, heart failure, coronary aery disease, aeriopathy ) Acute worsening of anemia due to blood loss (haemorrhage or surgery) or haemolysis Severe resistance to, or hyporesponsiveness to ESA therapy, e. g. due to the presence of a haematological disease or severe inflammatory systemic disease. Androgens Prior to the introduction of ESA therapy, androgens were widely used in the treatment of renal anemia. There is evidence that androgens may potentiate the effect of exogenous erythropoietic protein and also stimulate erythropoiesis by enhancing erythrocyte stemcell differentiation The risk of liver disease and malignancy, virilisation and hirsutism in women, priapism in men and disfiguring acne in patients of both sexes may outweigh the benefits of androgen therapy in most anaemic patients.

The pseudoseizures frequently are triggered by bizarre stimuli, and the pattern of the seizure changes often. The patient actually is awake and aware of his or her surroundings and events and can recall them later. Pseudoseizures usually can be distinguished both clinically and by the electroencephalogram (EEG) findings. In patients with pseudoseizures resembling tonic-clonic attacks, there may be warning and preparation before the attack; there is usually no tonic phase, and the clonic phase consists of wild thrashing movements during which the patient rarely comes to harm or is incontinent. Ictal eye closure is common. In some instances, there are abnormal movements of all extremities without loss of consciousness; in others, there is shouting, uttering of obscenities, or goal-directed behavior during apparent loss of consciousness. There is no postictal confusion or abnormal clinical signs after the attack. The EEG, if recorded during an episode, does not show organized seizure activity, and postictal slowing does not occur.

The liver is the major source of somatomedins like IGF-1 that mediates many of the physiological effects of Growth Hormone on target tissues. Somatomedins are similar to insulin in molecular structure and are hence also known as 'Insulin like Growth factors' (IGF) and these act on target tissue to increase protein synthesis by increasing the rate of uptake of amino acids.

Characteristic features of Absence seizures / Petitmal seizures: Clinical Hallmarks Almost always begin in childhood and cease by age of 20. Sudden brief lapses of consciousness without loss of postural control Seizure typically lasts only for seconds. Impairment is so brief that patient may be unaware of it. Consciousness returns as suddenly as it was lost i. e. Inset and termination of attack, both are abrupt. Usually accompanied by subtle bilateral motor signs such as - Rapid blinking of eye lids - Chewing movements - Small amplitude, clonic movements of hands There is no postictal confusion The seizure can occur hundreds of times per day. First clued to absence seizure is often unexplained 'day dreaming' and a decline in school performance recognized by a teacher. Electrophysiological hallmark Electrophysiological hallmark of typical absence seizure is a generalized symmetric, 3 Hz spike and wave discharge that begins and ends suddenly superimposed on a normal EEG background. Hyperventilation tends to provoke these electrographic discharges and even the seizures themselves.",

The MCA supplies most of the outer convex brain surface, nearly all the basal ganglia, and the posterior and anterior internal capsules. Patients with middle cerebral aery stroke syndrome (MCA stroke syndrome) may have some basic physical findings, as follows: Main trunk occlusion of either side yields contralateral hemiplegia, eye detion toward the side of the MCA infarct, contralateral hemianopia, and contralateral hemianesthesia. Trunk occlusion involving the dominant hemisphere causes global aphasia, whereas involvement of the nondominant hemisphere causes impaired perception of deficits (anosognosia) resulting from the stroke and more qualitative deficits of speech. Superior division infarcts lead to contralateral deficits with significant involvement of the upper extremity and face and paial sparing of the contralateral leg and foot. Inferior division infarcts of the dominant hemisphere lead to Wernicke's aphasia. Such infarcts on either side yield a superior quadrantanopsia or homonymous hemianopia, depending on the extent of infarction. Right inferior branch infarcts also may lead to a left visual neglect. Finally, resultant temporal lobe damage can lead to an agitated and confused state Dysahria is common because of facial weakness.",

The clinically acute viral syndrome is associated with nonspecific symptoms including a sore throat, myalgia, fever, rash, weight loss and fatigue Patient with primary HIV infection develops the acute viral syndrome 3-6 weeks after infection, which resolves spontaneously in 2-4 weeks. During this phase, the immune response to HIV infection has not yet developed. There are no HIV specific antibody ie., no seroconversion. Since these phases are characterized by high level of viremia, the infection in these stages can be diagnosed by direct detection of virus or virus particles. A variety of laboratory tests are available for the direct detection of HIV or its components. p24 Ag Assay The simplest of the direct detection test is p24 antigen capture assay. During the first few weeks of infection before an immune response develops, there is a brisk rise in p 24 antigen. After the development of the p24 antibody, these levels decline. Thus p24 Ag assay has its greatest use as a screening test for HIV infection in patients suspected of having the acute HIV syndrome as high levels of p24 Ag are present prior to the development of antibody. Detection of HIV RNA Measurement of HIV RNA in the plasma of patients with HIV infection is also useful in conditions where measurement of anti-HIV antibodies is not possible e. g. in acute infections and in neonatal infections. Currently, three assays are available for the diagnosis of HIV RNA. HIV RNA by PCR HIV RNA by b. DNA HIV RNA by NASBA Note: In neonates, there is the passive transmission of antibodies from the mother. Thus the antibodies cannot be used for the diagnosis in this condition as it would be impossible to tell whether the antibodies detected are acquired from the mother or they have developed as a result of infection. With the use of direct detection techniques, there is a decrease in the interval between infection and detection of (window period). Window period for Antibody testing -> 22 days approximately p24 Ag Assay -> 16 days HIV RNA -> 12 days.",

In some instances, central cyanosis can be detected reliably when the Sa. O2 has fallen to 85%; in others, particularly in dark-skinned persons, it may not be detected until it has declined to 75%. The increase in the quantity of reduced hemoglobin in the mucocutaneous vessels that produces cyanosis may be brought about either by an increase in the quantity of venous blood as a result of dilation of the venules and venous ends of the capillaries or by a reduction in the Sa in the capillary blood.

Selenium deficiency as a causative factor for Hypothyroidism and Goitre formation has been explained by diminished activity of selenocysteine enzymes in thyroid, notably glutathione peroxidase and deiodinase type-1. Type-1 deiodinase enzyme is required for conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues. Mountainous regions, such as the Himalayas, the Andes, and the Alps, and flooded river valleys, such as the Ganges, are among the most severely iodine-deficient areas in the world.

The bacterium grows best at 37degC (human body temperature). Typhoid fever is characterized by a sustained fever as high as 40degC (104degF), profuse sweating, gastroenteritis, and nonbloody diarrhea. Less commonly a rash of flat, rose-colored spots may appear. In the first week, there is a slowly rising temperature with relative bradycardia. There is leukopenia with eosinopenia and relative lymphocytosis, a positive diazo reaction and blood cultures are positive for Salmonella Typhi or Paratyphi. The classic Widal test is negative in the first week. In the second week of the infection, the patient lies prostrated with high fever in plateau around 104degF (40degC) and bradycardia (Sphygmo-thermic dissociation), classically with a dicrotic pulse wave. Delirium is frequent. This delirium gives to typhoid the nickname of \"nervous fever\". Rose spots appear on the lower chest and abdomen in around 1/3 patients. There are rhonchi in lung bases. Diarrhea can occur in this stage: green with a characteristic smell, comparable to pea-soup. The spleen and liver are enlarged (hepatosplenomegaly). The Widal reaction is strongly positive with anti 0 and anti H antibodies. Blood cultures are sometimes still positive at this stage. In the third week of typhoid fever a number of complications can occur: Intestinal hemorrhage due to bleeding in congested Peyer's patches; this can be very serious but is usually non-fatal. Intestinal perforation in distal ileum: this is a very serious complication and is frequently fatal. Encephalitis Metastatic abscesses, cholecystitis, endocarditis and osteitis The yield of blood cultures is variable; sensitivity is as high as 90% during the first week of infection and decreases to 50% by the third week.",

The severity of patient's condition depends on the extent of nervous system involvement-that is, the extent of demyelination. Cranial nerve involvement is present in 85% of cases, with the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) most often affected. The glossopharyngeal (cranial nerve IX), vagus (cranial nerve X), spinal accessory (cranial nerve XI), and hypoglossal (cranial nerve XII) nerves also may be affected. Signs and symptoms of facial nerve dysfunction include inability to smile, frown, whistle, or use a straw when drinking. Paralysis of cranial nerves IX and X can cause dysphagia and laryngeal paralysis. Autonomic dysfunction may occur if the vagus nerve is affected. Motor weakness and paralysis usually begin in the legs, progressing to the trunk and arms. If sensory symptoms are present, patients may complain of paresthesias and pain. After the first few days of weakness and paresthesias, physical assessment will reveal diminished (hyporeflexia) or absent deep tendon reflexes (areflexia) in the involved extremities. Areflexia is considered a key assessment finding in GBS. Respiratory failure is thought to be caused by involvement of the muscles of respiration, including the diaphragm and the intercostals. GBS doesn't affect the patient's cognitive function, level of consciousness, or pupillary signs. Autonomic dysfunction-signs and symptoms include cardiac dysrhythmias, paroxysmal hypotension, ohostatic hypotension, paralytic ileus, urinary retention, and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone.",

Mesothelioma - a form of cancer mainly affecting the mesothelial cells. Asbestos related lung cancer Asbestosis - a non-malignant scarring of the lung tissue a form of pneumoconiasis. Non malignant pleural disease (diffuse pleural thickening and pleural plaques) Pathophysiology: There are 4 principal processes by which asbestos affects the pleura 1. The fibers irritate the pleura, thereby inducing scarring or a more malignant process 2. The fibers may pierce the mitotic spindle of cells, thereby disrupting mitosis leading to chromosomal damage 3. They also induce the generation of iron-related reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing DNA damage 4. Asbestos also induces phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases which increases the expression of early-response proto-oncogenes.

In cases of isolated oculomotor palsy, the subarachnoid space is the most likely site of pathology. The differential includes a posterior communicating aery aneurysm, uncal herniation, compressive neoplasms, inflammatory lesions, or trauma. Causes for third-nerve palsy within the cavernous sinus include neoplasms, carotid aery aneurysm, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and carotid-cavernous fistula. Orbital lesions causing third-nerve palsies may be due to inflammation, trauma, neoplasms, and mucoceles. Isolated third-nerve palsy is common with diabetic or hypeensive disease, likely due to microvascular ischemia. In this situation, the palsy rarely affects the pupil, and may be extremely painful.

Siuin Siuins have been implicated in influencing a wide range of cellular processes like aging, transcription, apoptosis, inflammation and stress resistance, as well as energy efficiency and aleness during low-calorie situations. Siuins can also control circadian clocks and mitochondrial biogenesis. `Circulating levels of natriuretic peptides are useful adjunctive tools in the diagnosis of patients with HE Both B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-BNP, which are released from the failing heart, are relatively sensitive markers for the presence of HF with depressed EF,. they also are elevated in HF patients with a preserved EF, albeit to a lesser degree. However, it is hi )ant to recognize that natriuretic peptide levels increase with age and renal impairment, are more elevated in women, and can be elevated in right HF from any cause. Levels can be falsely low in obese patients and may normalize in some patients after appropriate treatment. Other biomarkers, such as troponin T and I, C-reactive protein, TNF receptors, and uric acid, may be elevated in HF and provide impoant prognostic information. Serial measurements of one or more biomarkers ultimately may help guide therapy in HF, but they are not currently recommended for this purpose.

IgG subclass 2 is directed against polysaccharide antigens and is involved in the host defense against encapsulated bacteria. C3 nephritic factor is an IgG autoantibody that binds to C3 convease, making it resistant to inactivation. This leads to persistently low serum complement levels and is associated with Type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. C5 is a component of the complement system. C5a is an anaphylatoxin that affects vasodilatation in acute inflammation. It is also chemotactic for neutrophils and monocytes and increases the expression of adhesion molecules. A deficiency of C5a would affect the acute inflammatory response against any microorganism or foreign substance. Myeloperoxidase in phagocytic cells is an element of the oxygen-dependent pathway present in phagocytic cells that effectively kills bacterial cells. The hydrogen peroxide-halide complex is considered the most efficient bactericidal system in neutrophils. Chronic granulomatous disease is associated with a deficiency of NADPH oxidase, which conves molecular oxygen to superoxide (the first step in the myeloperoxidase system).

An antiproliferative agent (azathioprine); and 3. A coicosteroid (prednisolone) However, a small number of treatment centers use a policy of initial monotherapy with a calcineurin inhibitor, adding in other agents if necessary. Immunosuppressive therapy for renal transplantation in adults Induction therapy Is a course of intensive immunosuppressive for about 2 weeks immediately post operatively (though often staed immediately pre-operatively) with the aim of 'switching off' the immune system after transplantation to reduce the likelihood of accelerated rejection and acute rejection. It has also been used as a means of reducing exposure to calcineurin inhibitors in the early stages after transplantation when the graft may be paicularly vulnerable to their nephrotoxic effects. The term induction therapy has usually been linked with the use of the following agents: - The polyclonal antibodies antithymocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) - The antilymphocyte immunoglobulin (ALG), and - The monoclonal antibody muromonab-CD3 (OKT3) Initial therapy Is the treatment given to all recipients (except where the donor is an identical twin) for 0-3 months after transplantation. Initial therapy is usually 'triple therapy', in which a clacineurin inhibitor (traditionally cyclosporine) is used as the 'primary agent' in combination with a coicosteroid (prednisolone) and azathioprine. Occasionally, dual therapy (cyclosporine plus costicositeroid) is used. Maintenance therapy Is the treatment that patients receive long-term, throughout the duration of allograft survival Maintenance therapy is often identical to initial therapy (triple therapy) but at a reduced dosage because the transplanted kidney becomes immunologically more stable with increasing time. However, agents used in maintenance therapy may be altered in response to - Development of acute rejection, severe infections or toxicity. - Poor tolerability leading to non-adherence",

On the basis of the ECG, a distinction is made between ST elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). Risk Factors Older age Male sex Tobacco smoking Hypercholesterolemia (more accurately hyperlipoproteinemia, especially high low density lipoprotein and low high density lipoprotein) Hyperhomocysteinemia Diabetes (with or without insulin resistance) High blood pressure Obesity (defined by a body mass index of more than 30 kg/ m2) Stress Occupations. Women who use combined oral contraceptive pills. The most serious of these arrhythmias is ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib/VF), an extremely fast and chaotic heart rhythm that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death. Another life threatening arrhythmia is ventricular tachycardia (V-Tach/VT). Different zones of the heart can become injured: - An occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary aery(LAD) will result in an anterior wall myocardial infarct. - Infarcts of the lateral wall are caused by occlusion of the left circumflex coronary aery(LCx) or its oblique marginal branches (or even large diagonal branches from the LAD.) Both inferior wall and posterior wall infarctions may be caused by occlusion of either the right coronary aery or the left circumflex aery, depending on which feeds the posterior descending aery. Right ventricular wall infarcts are also caused by right coronary aery occlusion. Electrocardiogram The 12 lead ECG is used to classify patients into one of three groups: Those with ST segment elevation or new bundle branch block Those with ST segment depression or T wave inversion Those with a so-called non-diagnostic or normal ECG. Complications - Congestive heart failure Myocardial rupture is most common three to five days after myocardial infarction, commonly of small degree. - Life-threatening arrhythmia-The re-entry phenomenon may cause rapid heart rates (ventricular tachycardia and even ventricular fibrillation), and ischemia in the electrical conduction system of the heart may cause a complete heart block - Pericarditis-In Dressler's syndrome, this occurs several weeks after the initial event. - Cardiogenic shock",

        "exp": "Pulmonary thromboembolism REF: Harrison's Internal Medicine 17th edition Chapter 256. Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Thromboembolism PULMONARY THROMBOEMBOLISM: Pathophysiology When venous thrombi dislodge from their site of formation, they embolize to the pulmonary aerial circulation or, paradoxically, to the aerial circulation through a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. About half of patients with pelvic vein thrombosis or proximal leg DVT develop PE, which is usually asymptomatic. With increased use of chronic indwelling central venous catheters for hyperalimentation and chemotherapy, as well as more frequent inseion of permanent pacemakers and internal cardiac defibrillators, upper extremity venous thrombosis is becoming a more common problem. These thrombi rarely embolize and cause PE. Pathophysiological abnormalities include: The most common gas exchange abnormalities are hypoxemia (decreased aerial P02) and an increased alveolar-aerial 02 tension gradient, which represents the inefficiency of 02 transfer across the lungs Increased pulmonary vascular resistance due to vascular obstruction or platelet secretion of vasoconstricting neurohumoral agents such as serotonin. Impaired gas exchange due to increased alveolar dead space from vascular obstruction, hypoxemia from alveolar hypoventilation relative to perfusion in the nonobstructed lung, right-to-left shunting, and impaired carbon monoxide transfer due to loss of gas exchange surface. Alveolar hyperventilation due to reflex stimulation of irritant receptors Increased airway resistance due to constriction of airways distal to the bronchi Decreased pulmonary compliance due to lung edema, lung hemorrhage, or loss of surfactant Signs & Symptoms Sudden-onset dyspnea (shoness of breath) Tachypnea (rapid breathing) Chest pain of a \"pleuritic\" nature (worsened by breathing) Cough and hemoptysis (coughing up blood). More severe cases can include signs such as cyanosis (blue discoloration, usually of the lips and fingers), collapse, and circulatory instability due to decreased blood flow through the lungs and into the left side of the heart. Occasionally, a pleural friction rub may be audible over the affected area of the lung (mostly in PE with infarct) A pleural effusion is sometimes present that is transudative A low-grade fever may be present, paicularly if there is associated pulmonary hemorrhage or infarction About 15% of all cases of sudden death are attributable to PE Risk factors The most common sources of embolism are proximal leg deep venous thrombosis (DVTs) or pelvic vein thromboses. The development of thrombosis is classically due to a group of causes named Virchow's triad (alterations in blood flow, factors in the vessel wall and factors affecting the propeies of the blood). Often, more than one risk factor is present. Alterations in blood flow: immobilization (after surgery, injury or long-distance air travel), pregnancy (also procoagulant), obesity (also procoagulant), cancer (also procoagulant) Factors in the vessel wall: of limited direct relevance in VTE Factors affecting the propeies of the blood (procoagulant state) Estrogen-containing hormonal contraception Genetic thrombophilia (factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation G20210A, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia and plasminogen/fibrinolysis disorders) Acquired thrombophilia (antiphospholipid syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria) Cancer (due to secretion of pro-coagulants) Diagnosis D-dimer is highly sensitive but not very specific (specificity around 50%). In other words, a positive D-dimer is not synonymous with PE, but a negative D-dimer is, with a good degree of ceainty, an indication of absence of a PE The gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) is pulmonary angiography CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is a pulmonary angiogram obtained using computed tomography (CT) with radiocontrast rather than right heart catheterization. Its advantages are clinical equivalence, its non-invasive nature, its greater availability to patients Ventilation/perfusion scan (or V/Q scan or lung scintigraphy), which shows that some areas of the lung are being ventilated but not perfused with blood (due to obstruction by a clot). This type of examination is used less often because of the more widespread availability of CT technology, however, it may be useful in patients who have an allergy to iodinated contrast or in pregnancy due to lower radiation exposure than CT",

Renin-producing carcinomas also have been described in lung, liver, pancreas, colon, and adrenals. Renovascular hypertension is another renin-mediated form of hypertension. Obstruction of the renal artery leads to decreased renal perfusion pressure, thereby stimulating renin secretion. Over time, possibly as a consequence of secondary renal damage, this form of hypertension may become less renin-dependent.

C: ASD Fixed splitting denotes absence of significant variation of the splitting interval with respiration, such that the separation of A2, and P2, remains unchanged during inspiration and expiration. Atrial septal defect, with either normal or high pulmonary vascular resistance, is the classic example of fixed splitting of the second sound. The fixed nature of the split is due to approximately equal inspiratory delay of the aoic and pulmonic components, indicating that the two ventricles share a common venous reservoir. Respiratory splitting of the second sound immediately returns to normal following surgical repair of an atrial septa] defect, although the pulmonic closure sound may remain delayed for weeks or months. Severe right heart failure can lead to a relatively fixed split. This occurs because the right ventricle fails to respond to the increased volume produced by inspiration and because the lungs are so congested that impedance to forward flow from the right ventricle barely falls during inspiration. In anomalous pulmonary venous return without atrial septal defect, fixed splitting is not usually seen despite the simultaneous inspiratory delay in aoic and pulmonic closure",

These features indicate a more severe disease 'A third heart sound (S3) in chronic mitral regurgitation is usually indicative of severe regurgitation' Severity of Mitral Regurgitation:. If the murmur is harsher and has a lot of low and medium frequencies. It usually indicates a lot of flow and therefore will imply significant regurgitation. A harsh decrescendo mitral regurgitation murmur is usually indicative of severe regurgitation because the decrscendo effect is caused by early buildup of a very high v wave pressure in the left atrium resulting from a severe degree of regurgitation. Thus decreasing the gradient in late systole (If the murmur, on the other hand, is all pure high frequency and confined only to late systole. Then it must indicate a high pressure difference between the left ventricle and the left atrium and therefore only mild regurgitation). When the mitral regurgitation is severe, the volume overload on the left ventricle will be high, resulting in an enlarged left ventricle. This may be reflected in a displaced hyperdynamic wide -area left ventricular apical impulse. In addition, the hyperdynamic left ventricle will have rapid ejection. This will make the A2 occur early. Resulting in a wide-split S2. Thus, a wide -split S2 in the presence of mitral regurgitation is a sign of severe regurgitation if the wide split is not caused by P2 delay. In addition, severe regurgitation because of the volume load effect will have a torrential inflow through the mitral valve during diastole. This will set up the necessary conditions for the production of an S3 or a mid -diastolic inflow rumble. The presence of an S3 or an inflow rumble at the apex will, therefore, be a sign of significant mitral regurgitation as well. Severity of Mitral Regurgitation: Features indicating increased severity: Presence of Left ventricular S3 or an inflow rumble at the apex Harsh Decrescendo murmur with lot of low and medium frequencies Wide split S, due to early A2 (not caused by P2 delay) in presence of MR Note: Loudness and duration of Mitral regurgitation murmur does not always correlate with the severity of the regurgitation",

Acute liver conditions are associated with only minimal changes in serum albumin (Albumin levels may be normal or minimally altered in viral hepatitis drug related hepato-toxity and obstructive jaundice) Chronic liver conditions are associated with hypoalbuminemia reflecting decreased albumin synthesis from severe and prolonged liver dysfunction. Remember: Hypoalhuntinemia is not specific for liver disease and may occur in protein malnutrition of any cause, protein losing enter apathies nephritic syndrome and chronic infections. Aminotransferases are used as indicators of extent of hepatocellular injury. They may be elevated in both acute and chronic hepatocellular disorders. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme used as markers of cholestasis and again may be elevated in both acute and chronic cholestatic disorders. Bilirubin levels also may be elevated in both acute and chronic liver disease.",

        "exp": "D i. e Liver parenchymal disease Haptoglobin (Hp) binds extracorpuscular (i. e. extracellular) hemoglobin (Hb), preventing free Hb from entering the kidney. Hp-Hb complex is removed from plasma by haptocytes. Levels of haptoglobin falls rapidly in situations where hemoglobin is constantly being released from RBC such as occurs in hemolytic anemia (haemorrhage). But in case of parenchymal liver disease, Hp-Hb complex removal is deranged so reduction in haptoglobin level is masked. Haptoglobin It is a plasma glycoprotein that binds extracapsular hemoglobin (Hb) in a tight non-covalent complex. Its amount ranges from 40mg- 180 mg of hemoglobin binding capacity / deciliter. Only 10% of degraded hemoglobin is released in circulation (i. e. extra corpuscular) the remaining 90% is present in old damaged RBCs, which are degraded by histiocytic system. Free Hb (molecular mass 65. KDa) passes through glomerulus and precipitate in tubules. However, after binding with haptoglobin (90 KDa) the Hb-Hp complex (155. KDa) becomes too large to pass through glomerulus. So the function of haptoglobin is to prevent loss of free hemoglobin into kidney and conserve the valuable iron present in hemoglobin, which would otherwise be lost to the body. Humans have 3 polymorphic forms, k/a Hp 1-1, Hp 2-1, Hp 2-2. Low levels of haptoglobins are found in patients with hemolytic anemia. This is explained by the fact that where the life of Hp is 5 days, the t1/2 of Hb-Hp complex is 90 minutes, the complex being rapidly removed by hepatocytes. So when the hepatoglobin is bound to Hb, it is cleared from plasma about 80 times faster than normally. Hb is an acute phase protein & is elevated in variety of inflammatory states. * Haptoglobin related protein binds hemoglobin; hemopexin binds free heme; and albumin binds metheme (ferric heme)",

Trigeminal Neuralgia is typically characterized by Paroxysmal attacks of brief electric shock-like pains, abrupt in onset and termination, limited to the distribution of one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve lasting for a brief period from a fraction of a second to 2 minutes. The most common division of the trigeminal nerve involved in trigeminal neuralgia is the Maxillary division (V2) followed by the mandibular division (V3). The ophthalmic Division (VI) is rarely involved The pain often evokes spasm of the muscle of the face on the affected side. The clinical association between Trigeminal Neuralgia and hemifacial spasm is called Tic Douloureux. Typical Features of Trigeminal Neuralgia (Prosopalgia, Fothergill's disease) Sudden/ Abrupt onset and termination Sharp superficial, stabbing or burning in quality Severe in intensity Brief in duration (lasting for a brief period from a fraction of a second to 2 minutes) Intermittent (Between paroxysms the patient is usually asymptomatic. Following a painful paroxysm there is usually a refractory period during which pain cannot be triggered) Unilateral (The pain never crosses to the opposite side but it may rarely occur bilaterally in which case a central cause such as multiple sclerosis must be considered) Precipitated from trigger areas or by trigger factors in the trigeminal area such as eating or chewing, washing the face, shaving, smoking, talking or brushing the teeth There is no clinically evident neurological deficit Note: Trigeminal Neuralgia is More common with advancing age Trigeminal Neuralgia is More common in women Trigeminal Neuralgia is More common on right side Trigeminal Neuralgia attacks are most frequent during the day (but may awaken the patient at night) Trigeminal Neuralgia most frequently arises from the maxillary division of Trigeminal nerve (V2)",
