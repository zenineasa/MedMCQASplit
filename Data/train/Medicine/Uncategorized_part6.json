Of these, transmission during birth (intrapartum) and in the immediate period thereafter (peripartum) is considered to be the most common mode. The reported transmission rate varies from 7% to 49%. Higher risk of transmission is associated with high maternal viral load and low CD4+ T-cell count as well as chorioamnionitis. Currently, with antiretroviral therapy given to infected pregnant women, the mother to child transmission has been reduced to very low levels. Zidovudine alone or in combination with lamivudine given to mother during the last few weeks of pregnancy or even only during labour and delivery and to the infant for a week or less reduces the transmission by 50%. Single dose nevirapine is also an effective prophylactic antiretroviral regimen. It is of particular relevance to low to mid income nations because of the low cost. There is a significant decrease in the risk of HIV transmission with an elective cesarean.

Presence offragmented RBC's in the peripheral smear suggests the diagnosis of a micro-angiopathic process (Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia). The fragmentation of RBC's is caused by fibrin deposits in small blood vessels, which cause mechanical hemolysis. Patients with microangiopathic hemolytic anemias are usually thrombocytopenic (due to consumption of Platelets). Microangiopathic Hemolytic anemia (fragmented RBC) and Thrombocytopenia are typically seen in TTP, HUS, DIC and HELLP syndrome besides several other conditions. Evan's syndrome (combination of ITP and Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA)) Evan's Syndrome refers to a combination of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenie Purpura (ITP) and Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) in the absence of an underlying cause / disease. The occurence of thrombocytopenia may coincide with episodes of hemolysis or may arise as separate episodes.

In heart failure total body sodium is increased, yet effective circulating volume is sensed as inadequate by baroceptors. Increased ADH and Aldosterone results which causes retention of water and sodium. Secondary water gain exceeds primary sodium gain resulting in hyponatremia. Elevated serum urea levels may be seen. Biochemical studies in heart failure may show renal insufficiency. Renal functions tests also determine whether cardiac failure is associated with prerenal azotemia. Right atrial mean pressure is increased congestive heart failure. In heart failure one or the other ventricle fails to discharge its contents or fails to fill normally.

The features of Hypernatrenzia, Increased osmolality and increased urine output indicates diuresis due to mannitol. Pts with head injury and increased intracranial pressure requires mannitol adminstration (to reduce intracranial pressure). Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic, it is freely filtered at glomerulus and undergoes limited reabsorption. Presence of mannitol in the tubular fluid reduces the corticomedullary gradiant and retains water isoosmatically in the proximal tubular fluid. So, the primary function of mannitol is to increase urinary volume. The loss of water in the urine can cause Hypernatremia and increase in serum osmolarity. \"Whenever mannitol is administered in cases of head trauma to reduce the intracranial tension, serum osmolarity should always be monitored (it should never be allowed to go beyond 320 mosmol/kg.)\" Diabetes insipidus Hypernatremia and increase in Serum osmolarity can also occur in Diabetes insipidus (due to increased water loss). Presence of head injury too, suggests Diabetes insipidus But, this is not a case of diabetes insipidus To establish the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus urinary osmolarity and specific gravity is needed - urine osmolarity < 300 mosmol/kg and - specific gravity < 1. 02 Urine output in cases of diabetes insipidus is generally in the range of 6-7 L/day. (Here, the urine output is 3. 5 L/day which is just adequate to meet the criteria of polyuria) Remember, The pt is on a diruretic i. e., mannitol Mannitol will prevent reabsorption of water in -> Proximal tubule. Diabetes insipidus will prevent reabsorption water in -> Collecting duct of So the presence of diabetes insipidus in patients on diuretic will lead to huge loss of water through urine which will certainly be much more than 3. 5 L/day Note: The patients is on ventilator Significant loss of water also occurs through ventilation by evaporation. This may also contribute to hypernatremia and increase in serum osmolarity. Too much infusion of normal saline Too much infusion of normal saline will never increase sodium and serum osmolarity in physiologically normal patient Hypernatremia can be caused by administration of hypertonic saline and Na.

Neuropathic joint Disease/Charcot's joint It is progressive destructive ahritis arising from loss of pain sensation and proprioception (position sense). Clinical Presentation Begins in a single joint & progress to involve other joints. Joint becomes progressively enlarged (swollen) from bony overgrowth and synol effusion. Loose bodies may be palpated in the joint. Joint instability subluxation & crepitus occurs as the disease progresses. Patients complains of weakness, swelling, instability, laxity & progressive deformity usually involving knee or ankle. The markedly swollen joint is neither tender nor warm. The appearance suggest that movements would be agonizing and yet it is often painless. The paradox is diagnostic i. e. the amount of pain experienced is less than would be anticipated based on degree of joint involvement. Sudden pain occurs from intraaicular farctures of osteophytes or condyles Features of underlying disease Radiological Features Similar to OA i. e. joint space narrowing, subchondrial bone sclerosis, osteophytes loose bodies and joint effusion.

Plasma levels of CEA can be determined readily by radioimmunoassay. However, its usefulness in colon carcinogenesis screening is limited because of its high level in the plasma of a patient's malignancies originating from other sites such as breast, pancreas, stomach and lung. Fuhermore, CEA plasma levels may also be increased in smokers or patients with chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, bronchitis and alcoholic liver disease. The clinical usefulness of CEA for screening purposes is fuher limited by the fact that its increase in level typically occurs only when the tumor penetrates through the serosa. Thus, early lesions may not be detected by serum CEA level changes. CEA is typically elevated with metastatic liver disease, but rarely with peritoneal involvement. Thus, while the specificity for CEA to identify occult CRCs is high, the sensitivity is low in most studies for screening. Accordingly, CEA is not a useful test for the screening of CRC. Regardless of the clinicopathologic stage, a preoperative elevation of the plasma CEA level predicts eventual tumour recurrence. High level of CA 19-9 is seen in the plasma of a patient's malignancies originating from colon, breast and pancreas",

Secondary lung abscesses arise in the setting of an underlying condition, such as a post obstructive process (e. g., a bronchial foreign body or tumour) or a systemic process (e. g., HIV infection or another immunocompromising condition). Lung abscesses can also be characterized as acute (<4-6 weeks in duration) or chronic (~40% of cases). Reference: Harrison's PRINCIPLES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE 20th edition page no 919",

        "exp": "The first trick to this question is to determine where the lesion is. The corneal reflex is tested by touching a cotton wisp to the eye. A normal response would be blinking of the ipsilateral eye as well as the contralateral eye (consensual reflex). The afferent limb of the corneal reflex is contained within the ophthalmic division of the ipsilateral ophthalmic nerve (V1), the efferent limb is by both (right and left) facial nerves (VII). This woman had a normal corneal reflex in her right eye, indicating a normal right V1 and right VII. However, she lacked a consensual reflex, indicating an abnormal left VIIth nerve. The next trick to this question is to determine what other signs a lesion in the left VIIth nerve could produce. A lesion in the left VIIth would also produce hyperacusis (increased sensitivity to sound) in the left ear because of paralysis of the stapedius muscle, which ordinarily dampens sound transmission through the middle ear. The absence of a pupillary light reflex of the left eye could be caused either by a lesion of the left optic nerve (CN II; afferent limb) or by a lesion of the left oculomotor nerve (CN III; efferent limb). The inability to abduct the right eye could be caused by a lesion of the right abducens nerve (CN VI), which innervates the lateral rectus muscle. Loss of pain and temperature of the left face could be caused by a lesion of the spinal nucleus of V. This nucleus is located in the medulla, and receives pain and temperature information from the face the trigeminal nerve (CN V). Ref: Rosenga A. J., Novakovic R. L., Frank J. I. (2005). Chapter 67.

The first steps in treatment of ohostatic hypotension are diagnosis and management of the underlying cause. A patient with symptomatic ohostatic hypotension who has a disease with no complete or specific cure may benefit from nonpharmacologic interventions which includes: Increasing salt and fluid intake Elevate head of bed Learn physical countermaneuvers like sitting leg-crossing Compression garments Drug treatment if these measures are not sufficient includes: Prostaglandin inhibitors (ibuprofen/ indomethacin) drugs can be used to increase intravascular volume. The mineralocoicoid fludrocoisone may be used in some patients to expand intravascular volume. Its side effect is supine hypertension. Midodrine (alpha-1 agonist), a vasoconstrictor, is effective in some cases of ohostatic hypotension. Its side effect is supine hypertension. Erythropoietin has been used to treat autonomic failure associated with decreased red cell mass or anemia.

They are surrogate markers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and indicate a cellular immune response to M. tuberculosis. a IGRAs cannot distinguish between latent infection and active tuberculosis (TB) disease and should not be used for diagnosis of active TB, which is a microbiological diagnosis. A positive IGRA result may not necessarily indicate active TB, and a negative IGRA result may not rule out active TB. 3 Because IGRAs are not affected by Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination status, IGRAs are useful for evaluation of LTBI in BCG-vaccinated individuals, paicularly in settings where BCG vaccination is administered after infancy or multiple (booster) BCG vaccinations are given. Assay antigens M. tuberculosis-specific antigens include:- Early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) and Culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10). These are encoded by genes located within the region of difference 1 (RD1) segment of the M. tuberculosis genome. They are more specific for M. tuberculosis than purified protein derivative (PPD) because they are not shared with any BCG vaccine strains or most species of NTM other than M marinum, M. kansasii, M szulgai, and M. flavescens. Types of assays Two IGRAs are available in many countries:- The Quanti. FERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay, which has replaced the second-generation Quantiferon. TB Gold (QFT-G) assay, and the T-SPOTTB assay. The QFT-GIT assay is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based, whole-blood test that uses peptides from three TB antigens i. e., CFP-10, and TB7. 7) in an in-tube format The result is repoed as quantification of interferon (IFN)-gamma in international units (IU) per mL. A newer assay, the Quanti. FERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus), became available in 2015. This test is available in Europe but not in Noh America. The QFT-Plus assay has two TB antigen tubes, unlike the QFT assay (which has a single TB antigen tube). Sensitivity and specificity IGRAs have specificity >95 percent for diagnosis of latent TB infection. The sensitivity for T-SPOTTB appears to be higher than for QFT-GIT or TST (approximately 90, 80, and 80 percent, respectively). The higher sensitivity of T-SPOTTB may be useful for evaluating individuals with immunosuppressive conditions. TST specificity is high in populations not vaccinated with BCG (97 percent). Among populations where BCG is administered, it is much lower although variable (approximately 60 percent).",

The central respiratory drive is maintained in patients with neuromuscular disorders. Thus, hypoventilation is secondary to respiratory muscle weakness. Chest wall deformities such as kyphoscoliosis, fibrothorax, and those occurring postthoraco-plasty are associated with alveolar hypoventilation leading to respiratory insufficiency and respiratory failure. Hypoventilation is not uncommon in patients with severe COPD.

        "exp": "Sudden, painless monocular blindness is a sign of carotid disease. The symptom is also called amaurosis fugax. The patient may describe a shade dropping in front of the eye or describe vision like looking through ground glass. If a thrombus propagates up the carotid to the middle cerebral aery, then symptoms seen in middle cerebral aery occlusion or embolization (hemiparesis with sensory symptoms, aphasia depending on hemispheric dominance) will also occur. Midbasilar aery disease produces weakness and sensory loss with diplopia, loss of facial sensation or movement, and ataxia. Branches of the basilar aery supply the base of the pons and superior cerebellum. The symptoms described suggest disease in the posterior circulation, whichincludes paired veebral aeries, the basilar aery, and the paired posterior cerebral aeries. The basilar aery divides into two posterior cerebral aeries that provide branches to the cerebellum, medulla, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and temporal and occipital lobes. A midbasilar aery occlusion could cause ataxia of limbs by involving pontine nuclei; paralysis of the face, arm, and leg by involving coicospinal tracts; and impairment of facial sensation by involvement of fifth nerve nucleus. Occlusion of the entire middle cerebral aery results in contralateral hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, and homonymous hemianopsia. When the dominant hemisphere is involved, aphasia is present. When the nondominant hemisphere is involved, apraxia and neglect are produced. When only a penetrating branch of the middle cerebral aery is affected, the syndrome of pure motor hemiplegia is produced, as the infarct involves only the posterior limb of the internal capsule, involving only motor fibers to the face, arm, and leg (lacunar infarct).",

These have no known adverse effects on glucose or lipid metabolism and minimize the development of diabetic nephropathy by reducing renal vascular resistance and renal perfusion pressure. What puzzles the situation: In Diabetic patient with hypertension multiple agents are usually needed to achieve good blood pressure control. The average diabetic patient will require at least three medications to achieve appropriate control. While ACE inhibitors/ angiotensin receptor blockers will form an essential component of the regimen, Thiazide diuretics may also be used as an additional agent. Thus diuretics though not preferred agents for treatment of hypertension in diabetics, may well be used as conjunctive agents and are a possible treatment modality.

Hemolysis regularly produces in the serum an increase in unconjugated bilirubin and aspaate transaminase (AST), urobilinogen will be increased in both urine and stool. So the most likely diagnosis in this patient is hemolytic jaundice. In Hemolytic Anemia the main clinical sign is jaundice. The spleen is enlarged because it is a preferential site of hemolysis. The laboratory features of HA are related to hemolysis and the erythropoietic response of the bone marrow. Hemolysis produces an increase in unconjugated bilirubin and aspaate transaminase (AST); urobilinogen will be increased in both urine and stool. The main sign of the erythropoietic response by the bone marrow is an increase in reticulocytes. The increased number of reticulocytes is associated with an increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in the blood count. On the blood smear, this is reflected in the presence of macrocytes. A bone marrow aspirate will show erythroid hyperplasia. Cholelithiasis is a complication of hemolytic anemia. Obstructive jaundice is unlikely in this case as the patient has anemia and a positive urine urobilinogen test. Reference: Harrison's Internal Medicine, 18th Edition, Page 326, 872-875, 3179-3180",

Disordered muscle calcium regulation is recognized as the underlying disorder in malignant hypehermia. Ryanodine receptor is the calcium channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum which controls the flux of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm. It plays an impoant role in the activation of the contractile mechanism, and its malfunction causes malignant hypehermia. RYR1 is the receptor type in muscle. The ryanodine receptor interacts with an L-tvpe calcium channel. Mutations in the ryanodine receptor are associated with central core myopathy and malignant hypehermia.",

Sjogren's syndrome classically presents with keratoconjunctivitis (dry eyes) and xerostomia (dry mouth, often resulting in dental caries and fissures in the oral mucosa). These symptoms are due to autoimmune involvement with subsequent scarring of the salivary and lacrimal glands. Parotid gland enlargement is common, as is vasculitis, Raynaud's phenomenon, hyperviscosity syndrome, and peripheral neuropathy. The development of oral squamous cell carcinoma is not related to the presence of dental caries. Polyaeritis nodosa is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis. Patients typically present with low-grade fever, weakness, and weight loss. Abdominal pain, hematuria, renal failure, hypertension, and leukocytosis may occur. Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease characterized by vasculitis, rash, renal disease, hemolytic anemia, and neurologic disturbances. Ref: O'Dell J. R., Imboden J. B., Miller L. D.

Common Migraine (Migraine without aura) This is characterized by headache with autonomic system dysfunction ( eg. pallor & nausea, vomiting), but without stereotypical neurological or ophthalmic features as in classical migraine Premonitory features include changes in mood frequent yawning or nonspecific prodromal symptoms like loss of concentration Headache stas anywhere in the cranium and is pounding or throbbing It usually spreads to involve one half or even the whole head. During the attack which lasts from hours to a day or more patient is frequently photophobia and phonophobic and seeks relief in quiet dark environment, or through sleep. Classical Migraine (Migraine with aura) This is characterized by headache heralded by a visual aura which lasts about 20 minutes. Visual aura may consist of bright or dark spots, zig zags, heat haze distoions, fig san puzzle defects scintillating scotoma, tunnel vision or foification spectra which may progress to homonymous hemianopia. The headache follows the aura and is usually hemicranial opposite the hemianopia. During the attach patient has associated nausea and photophobia.",

D: Ratio of AST: ALT Transferases - Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or Aspaate aminotransferase (AST): These enzymes normally reside inside cells (in cytoplasm) so raised levels usually represent hepatocellular damage. ALT is more specific to the liver, as AST is also found in cardiac and skeletal muscle and red blood cells. Very high levels (>1000 IU/1) suggest drug induced hepatitis (e. g. paracetamol), acute viral hepatitis (A or B), ischaemic or rarely autoimmune hepatitis. The ratio of AST to ALT can give some extra clues as to the cause: In chronic liver disease ALT > AST, once cirrhosis established AST > ALT. The extremes of the ratio of AST: ALT can also be helpful: >2 suggests alcoholic liver disease, and a ratio of Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) - also related to the bile ducts. Typically elevated in cholestasis (with elevated ALP), but if ALP normal suggests induction of hepatic metabolic enzymes (e. g alcohol or enzyme inducing drugs). It is not specific to alcohol, easily inducible and is elevated in all forms of fatty liver. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) - comes mainly from the cells lining bile ducts but also in bone. Marked elevation is typical of cholestasis (often with elevated GGT) or bone disorders (usually normal GGT). Isoenzymes analysis may help identify source. It is physiologically increased when there is increased bone turnover (e. g. adolescence) and is elevated in the third trimester (produced by the placenta).",

It usually results from damage to upper motor neurons of the facial nerve. The facial motor nucleus has dorsal and ventral divisions that contain lower motor neurons supplying the muscles of the upper and lower face, respectively. The dorsal division receives bilateral upper motor neuron input (ie, from both sides of the brain). The ventral division receives only contralateral input (ie, from the opposite side of the brain). Thus, lesions of the coicobulbar tract between the cerebral coex and the facial motor nucleus destroy or reduce input to the ventral division, but ipsilateral input (ie, from the same side) to the dorsal division is retained. As a result, central facial palsy (damage to upper motor neurons of the facial nerve) is characterized by hemiparalysis or hemiparesis of the contralateral muscles of facial expression, but not the muscles of the forehead.",

Procainamide is the drug of choice for treatment of Atrial Fibrillation in patients with WPW Syndrome who are hemodynamically stable. Ibutilide and Amiodarone are also effective. Treatment of Hemodynamically Stable Atrial Fibrillation in Patients with WPW Syndrome Procainamide is the drug of choice for treatment of Atrial Fibrillation in patients with WPW Syndrome who are hemodynamically stable. Ibutilide and Amiodarone are also effective. Avoid AV nodal blocking agents such as Calcium channel blockers, Beta blockers and Digoxin The standard treatment of atrial fibrillation is to slow the ventricular rate with AV nodal blocking agents such as Calcium channel blockers, Beta blockers and Digoxin. In Patients with Pre-excitation (WPW Syndrome) the use of these agents should be avoided (contraindicated). Atrial Fibrillation in patients with WPW Syndrome is typically associated with rapid conduction over the AV node as well as the Accessory Pathway. AV nodal blockers slow down conduction and decrease the number of impulses entering the ventricles anterogradely through the AV node (but may increase the rate of conduction through the accessory pathway). This will reduce the number of impulses bombarding the ventricular end of the bypass tract or accessory pathway rendering the bypass tract less refractory. This may paradoxically increase the rate of conduction through the accessory pathway placing the patient at risk for development of VF.

The continuous murmur associated with a patent ductus aeriosus is best heard at the upper left sternal border. Large, uncorrected shunts may lead to pulmonary hypertension, attenuation or obliteration of the diastolic component of the murmur, reversal of shunt flow, and differential cyanosis of the lower extremities. A ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm creates a continuous murmur of abrupt onset at the upper right sternal border. Rupture typically occurs into a right heart chamber, and the murmur is indicative of a continuous pressure difference between the aoa and either the right ventricle or right atrium. A continuous murmur may also be audible along the left sternal border with a coronary aeriovenous fistula and at the site of an aeriovenous fistula used for hemodialysis access.

Marfan Syndrome: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a spectrum of disorders caused by a heritable genetic defect of connective tissue that has an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. The defect itself has been isolated to the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, which codes for the connective tissue protein fibrillin. Abnormalities in this protein cause a myriad of distinct clinical problems, of which the musculoskeletal, cardiac, and ocular system problems predominate. The skeleton of patients with MFS typically displays multiple deformities including arachnodactyly (ie, abnormally long and thin digits), dolichostenomelia (ie, long limbs relative to trunk length), pectus deformities (ie, pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum), and thoracolumbar scoliosis. Finally, blindness may result from unrecognized and untreated glaucoma, retinal detachment, and cataracts. In the cardiovascular system, aoic dilatation, aoic regurgitation, and aneurysms are the most worrisome clinical findings. Mitral valve prolapse that requires valve replacement can occur as well. Ocular findings include myopia, cataracts, retinal detachment, and superior dislocation of the lens. Takayasu aeritis is also known as pulseless disease because of frequent occlusion of aeries arising from the aoa. It may also occlude renal aeries. Polyaeritis nodosa is a multisystem necizing vasculitis of small and medium sized muscular aeries in which involvement of the renal and visceral aeries is characteristic.

PD is located on the X chromosome (band X q28) and has been cloned and sequenced. o Even though females have two X chromosomes per cell, normal males and females have the same enzyme activity in their red cells because one of the X chromosomes in each cell of the female embryo is inactivated and remains inactive throughout subsequent cell divisions (Lyon hypothesis). G6. PD deficiency is expressed in males carrying a variant gene, while heterozygous females are usually clinically normal. However, the mean red blood cell enzyme activity in heterozygous females may be normal, moderately reduced, or grossly deficient depending upon the degree of lyonization and the degree to which the abnormal G6. PD variant is expressed. G6. PD suppos Lyon's hypothesis:- According to lyon's hypothesis one of the two chromosome in each cell of the female embryo is inactivated and remains inactive throughout subsequent cell division. G6. PD is inherited as an X-linked (recessive) disorder, it is more common in males. Heterozygous Female may also be affected depend on the extent of lyonisation (inactivation of one X-chromosome) but the overall average degrees of hemolysis in heterozygous female is less. A heterozygous female with 50 percent normal G6. PD activity has 50 percent normal red cells and 50 percent G6. PD-deficient red cells. The deficient cells are as vulnerable to hemolysis as the enzyme-deficient red blood cells in males. Male Males, who have only one copy of the X chromosome, are either normal or hemizygous for the variant glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6. PD) gene. Thus, G6. PD deficiency is expressed in males carrying a variant gene on their X chromosome that produces sufficient enzyme deficiency to lead to symptoms. All of the red cells in affected males are vulnerable to hemolysis. Female Females, who have two copies of the X chromosome, are either normal, heterozygous, or homozygous for the variant gene. Heterozygous females are usually clinically normal. However, their mean red blood cell enzyme activity may be normal, moderately reduced, or grossly deficient depending upon the degree of X chromosome inactivation (lyonization) and the degree to which the abnormal G6.
