DVT with PE Develops suddenly and is a close answer but point against is Echo finding of only low ejection fraction. In PE, Echo shows RV dyskinesia with or without tricuspid regurgitation. The interventricular septal detion is also seen Amniotic fluid embolism Ruled out as it occurs immediately during active labour Peri-paum cardiomyopathy PPCM is diagnosed when the following 3 criteria are met: 1. Heart failure develops in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months of delivery. 2. Hea pumping function is reduced, with an ejection fraction (EF) less than 45% 3. No other cause for heart failure with reduced EF can be found. In this question anemia, Ml and Pulmonary embolism have been ruled out",
