He takes no medications and has not noted systemic symptoms such as fever, sore throat, weight loss, or fatigue. The general physical examination is normal. The oral mucosa and the lips are normal. Several 2- to 3-cm bullae are present over the trunk and back. A few excoriations where the blisters have ruptured are present. The remainder of the skin is normal, without erythema or scale. What is the best diagnostic approach at this time?",
        "exp": "Blistering diseases are potentially serious conditions. Blisters that are smaller than 0. 5 cm are termed vesicles; larger lesions are called bullae. The proper diagnosis and treatment of bullous disorders are paramount in order to prevent disability and even death from burn-like denudation of the skin and associated infection. Although many skin diseases such as allergic contact dermatitis, erythema multiforme, and bullous impetigo can cause blisters, this patient is more likely to have bullous pemphigoid or pemphigus. These are immunologically mediated disorders. Skin biopsy with immunofluorescence staining will reveal antibodies at the basal layer of the epidermis (bullous pemphigoid) or within the epidermis (pemphigus). Mucosal, especially oral, involvement is characteristic of pemphigus. Immunosuppressive agents including systemic corticosteroids are often necessary to treat these conditions. Antihistamines, sometimes helpful if itching is prominent, will not treat the underlying condition. It is no longer felt that bullous dermatoses are indicative of underlying malignancy, so a \"shotgun\" search for occult malignancy is not recommended. Dermatitis herpetiformis and porphyria cutanea tarda are other skin diseases that can be associated with blisters.",

Mild topical steroids also produce an excellent clinical response. High-dose topical steroids are rarely necessary; when used on the face for long periods of time, they can cause irreversible atrophy and thinning of the skin. Oral fluconazole is used in refractory Candida infections, which usually affect the oral mucosa (thrush), the vaginal mucosa or moist intertriginous areas.

The condition is often asymptomatic and may not require treatment. Topical therapies are effective but require daily application for many months. They have the advantage of safety. Oral treatment with terbinafine or itraconazole is more effective than topical treatment but must also be continued up to 6 months; oral antifungals carry the risk of hepatotoxicity.

Discoid lupus erythematosus) \"-/CDF 7th/823\"Methotrexate is an effective agent, especially in patients with psoriatic arthritis\"- Harrison 18th/400\"NSAl. Ds are usually sufficient for mild cases. Methotrexate (7. 5-20 mg orally once a week) is generally considered the drug of choice for patients who have not responded to NSAIDs; methotrexate can improve both the cutaneous and arthritic manifestations. For cases with disease that is refractory to methotrexate, the addition of TNF inhibitors is usually effective for both arthritis and psoriatic skin disease. A/e/acept, a biologic agent that is administered by subcutaneous injection, blocks the activation and proliferation of memory effector T ceils by binding to CD2; this drug also appears to be effective in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis as well as cutaneous disease. Corticosteroids are less effective in psoriatic arthritis than in other forms of inflammatory arthritis and may precipitate pustular psoriasis during tapers. Antimalarials may also exacerbate psoriasis. Successful treatment directed at the skin lesions alone [eg, by PUVA therapy) occasionally is accompanied by an improvement in peripheral articular symptoms. v- CMDT 06/853. Treatment: Psoriatic Arthritis Harrison 19th/2177-78, 18th/ 2782# Ideally, coordinated therapy is directed at both the skin and joints in PsA. As described above for AS, use of the anti-TNF-a agents has revolutionized the treatment of PsA. Prompt and dramatic resolution of both arthritis and skin lesions has been observed in large, randomized controlled trials ofetanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, andgolimumab. Many of the responding patients had long-standing disease that was resistant to all previous therapy, as well as extensive skin disease.# The clinical response is more dramatic than in RA, and delay of disease progression has been demonstrated radiographically. Paradoxically, rare cases have been reported of exacerbation or de novo appearance of psoriasis precipitated by anti-TNF therapy for a variety of conditions. In some cases, the therapy can nevertheless be continued.# The anti-T cell biologic agent alefacept, in combination with methotrexate, has shown benefit in both psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. Ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody to the shared IL-23/lL-12p40 subunit, has shown promise in treating both psoriasis and PsA in early clinical trials. Other treatment for PsA has been based on drugs that have efficacy in RA and/or in psoriasis. Although methotrexate in doses of 15-25 mg/week and sulfasalazine (usually given in doses of 2-3 g/d) have each been found to have clinical efficacy in controlled trials, neither effectively halts progression of erosive joint disease. Other agents with efficacy in psoriasis reported to benefit PsA are cyclosporine, retinoic acid derivatives, and psoralens plus ultraviolet A light (PUVA). There is controversy regarding the efficacy in PsA of gold and antimalarials, which have been widely used in RA. The pyrimidine synthetase inhibitor leflunomide has been shown in a randomized controlled trial to be beneficial in both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. All of these treatments require careful monitoring. Immunosuppressive therapy may be used cautiously in HIV-associated PsA if the HIV infection is well controlled. In one large prospective series, 7% of patients with PsA required musculoskeletal surgery beginning at a mean of 13 years' disease duration. Indications for surgery are similar to those in RA, although there is an impression that outcomes in PsA may be less satisfactory.
