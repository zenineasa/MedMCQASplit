In other instances there is a reduction in amplitude of the EEG until eventually activity cannot be detected. Such electrocerebral silence does not necessarily reflect irreversible brain damage, because it may occur in hypothermic patients or with drug overdose. The prognosis of electrocerebral silence, when recorded using an adequate technique, depends upon the clinical context in which it is found. In patients with severe cerebral anoxia, for example, electrocerebral silence in a technically satisfactory record implies that useful cognitive recovery will not occur.",

        "question": "Signal from Baroreceptors goes to -",
        "exp": "Ans. is C Nucleus of tractus solitarius o Baroreceptors are mechanoreceptors that are located in the adventia of carotid artery and aorta, at specialized locations called sinuses. Carotid sinus is a little bulge at the root of internal carotid artery, located just above the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. It is innerv ated by the sinus nerve, a branch of glossopharyngeal (IX cranial) nerve. Aortic arch (aortic sinus) also contains mechenoreceptors (stretch receptors) which are similar to carotid sinus receptors. However, their afferent nerve fibers travel in the aortic nerve, a branch of Vagus (X cranial) nerve. o The sinus nerve (from carotid sinus) and aortic nerve/vagal fibers (from aortic sinus) are together called 'Sino- aortic nerves'. They, together, are also refered to as 'Buffer nerves' because they are the afferents of cardiovascular reflexes that buffer abrupt changes in blood pressure. o Baroreceptors are highly sensitive to any change in mean blood pressure. Sinoaortic nerves (buffer nerves) normally discharge rhythmically, synchronous with the pressure fluctuation during systole and diastole. They respond to BP changes between 70 mm Hg and 150 mm Hg. When BP rises, baroreceptors are stimulated and their afferents (through sinoaortic nerves) stimulate nucleus of tractus solitarus (NTS) which inturn inhibits the pressor area of VMC, i. e., Rostral ventrolateral medula (RVLM). This results in decreased sympathetic outflow and therefore decreases in vasomotor tone and vasodilation. Vasodilation brings down the BP. Thereby helping hemostasis. Activated NTS also stimulates nucleus ambiguous (cardioinhibitory center) of medulla, which increases parasympathetic (vagal) output, through vagus, that decreases heart rate. Reduction in heart rate reduces the cardiac output, which also reduces BP. Baroreceptor stimulation also weekly inhibits respiration, o When BP falls, for instance while changing the posture from lying down to standing, reverse change takes place. When a person stands up, his blood is pooled in the veins of lowrer limbs by the effect of gravity. Central venous pressure and venous return decrease, which causes a fall in stroke volume. Hence the systolic BP falls. As a result, the discharge rate of baroreceptors decreases leading to a decrease in the inhibitory' influence on the pressor area of VMC. Hence vasomotor tone increases, leading to vasoconstriction, and consequently an increase in BP. Simultaneously, the nucleus ambiguous of the vagus is also inhibited, increasing the heart rate and consequently stroke volume and eventually BP. Thus fall in BP due to change of posture is very brief (Transient).",

        "question": "All of the following statements about the control of micturition are true except:",
        "exp": "Micturition is initiated by activation of afferent sensory fibers located in the wall of the bladder; these fibers sense the degree of stretch of the bladder wall. In addition, these sensory fibers travel back to the spinal cord via sacral dorsal roots. The sensory information that reaches the spinal cord also travels to the micturition center in the rostral pons. When sensory activity to the micturition center is sufficient, a command is sent to the sacral spinal cord, leading to activation of parasympathetic fibers. The parasympathetic fibers travel to the bladder via the pelvic nerve. Activation of these fibers leads to bladder contraction. Destruction of the sacral dorsal roots (as occurs with tabes dorsalis) abolishes the reflex because sensory afferent fibers no longer send signals back to the spinal cord. A spinal cord injury at L1 is well above the sacral region where the micturition reflex originates. How ever, the central nervous system (CNS) plays an important role in facilitating or inhibiting the micturition reflex, and this function is lost with spinal cord injury. Although some patients with spinal cord injury can still elicit a micturition response (e. g., stroking of the skin in the genital region), the bladder in these patients has increased muscle tone and fails to empty completely. As the bladder becomes more and more distended, an involuntary micturition reflex can occur. However, the CNS can keep urine from being voided under these circumstances by maintaining a constant tonic contraction of the external sphincter. This contraction is accomplished through continued activation of so matic nerves that travel in the pudendal nerve from the sacral spinal cord to the external sphincter. The point at which an urge to void first occurs corresponds to a bladder volume of approximately 150 ml. However, bladder volume can increase more than twofold before involuntary micturition occurs. At 400 ml a marked sense of fullness is present. Parasympathetic fibers originating in the sacral spinal cord innervate the body of the bladder, and it is activation of these fibers that leads to bladder contraction.",

METHOD: Drug selection was performed by means of the so-called 'system of objectified judgment analysis' (SOJA) method by a working group of 11 persons. The following selection criteria were used: pharmacokinetics, interactions, the probability of hitting (the probability that the microorganism is sensitive to the antibiotic), development of resistance, specific use in urinary tract infections, efficacy, side effects, dosage-frequency, duration of treatment, cost and documentation. The following drugs were included in the study: amoxicillin (with or without clavulanic acid), nitrofurantoin, sulfamethizole, trimethoprim, co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and fosfomycin trometamol. RESULTS: Fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin slow release showed the highest scores. The main selection criteria that determined the selection of a drug were especially specific use in urinary tract infections, development of resistance, the probability of hitting and cost. CONCLUSION: Fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin slow release best fulfill the requirements for drugs in the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis. No comparative studies have been performed with the 3-day treatment of uncomplicated cystitis with nitrofurantoin slow release or with trimethoprim. Fluoroquinolones play no important part in the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis, mainly because of the risk of development of resistance.",

Fatty acid synthesis starts with the production of Acetyl Co A within the mitochondria. \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acid oxidation also occurs in mitochondria. Mitochondrial DNA synthesis occurs within the mitochondria. Protein synthesis Process whereby DNA encodes for the production of amino acids and proteins. This process can be divided into two parts: 1. Transcription Before the synthesis of a protein begins, the corresponding RNA molecule is produced by RNA transcription. One strand of the DNA double helix is used as a template by the RNA polymerase to synthesize a messenger RNA (m. RNA). This m. RNA migrates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. During this step, m. RNA goes through different types of maturation including one called splicing when the non-coding sequences are eliminated. The coding m. RNA sequence can be described as a unit of three nucleotides called a codon. 2. Translation The ribosome binds to the m. RNA at the start codon (AUG) that is recognized only by the initiator t. RNA. The ribosome proceeds to the elongation phase of protein synthesis. During this stage, complexes, composed of an amino acid linked to t. RNA, sequentially bind to the appropriate codon in m. RNA by forming complementary base pairs with the t. RNA anticodon. The ribosome moves from codon to codon along the m. RNA. Amino acids are added one by one, translated into polypeptidic sequences dictated by DNA and represented by m. RNA. At the end, a release factor binds to the stop codon, terminating translation and releasing the complete polypeptide from the ribosome. One specific amino acid can correspond to more than one codon. The genetic code is said to be degenerate.",

        "exp": "The patient most likely has a type V hyperlipopro\u00adteinemia, which is associated with eruptive xanthomas secondary to increased triacylglycerol. Type V hyperli\u00adpoproteinemia is a combination of type I, characterized by elevated chylomicrons, and type IV, characterized by increased very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Diabetic ketoacidosis and alcoholism are two of the most common factors that promote type V hyperlipo\u00adproteinemia. The absence of insulin characteristic of diabetic ketoacidosis decreases capillary lipoprotein li\u00adpase activity, so neither chylomicrons nor VLDL are properly metabolized in the liver. The increased triac\u00adylglycerol concentration that results from the accumu\u00adlation of chylomicrons and VLDL in the blood pro\u00adduces a turbid specimen. Because chylomicrons have the lowest density, they form a turbid supranate in plasma left at 4\u00b0C overnight. The density of VLDL is slightly higher than that of chylomicrons, so it forms a turbid infranate. Presence of a supranate and in\u00adfranate, as in this case, indicates type V hyperlipopro\u00adteinemia. A supranate without an infranate occurs in type I hyperlipoproteinemia, and an infranate without a supranate occurs in type IV hyperlipoproteinemia. Another feature of type V disease is hyperchylomicro\u00adnemia. Clinical features include eruptive xanthomas caused by the deposition of triacylglycerol in the sub\u00adcutaneous tissue. Once the triacylglycerol concentra\u00adtion is reduced, the xanthomas disappear.",

It provides the sense of being immersed in one's surroundings and is therefore sometimes also referred to as qualitative stereopsis. Coarse stereopsis is important for orientation in space while moving, for example when descending a flight of stairs.# Fine stereopsis is mainly based on static differences. It allows the individual to determine the depth of objects in the central visual area (Panum's fusional area) and is therefore also called quantitative stereopsis. It is typically measured in random-dot tests; persons having coarse but no fine stereopsis is often unable to perform on random-dot tests, also due to visual crowding which is based on interaction effects from adjacent visual contours. Fine stereopsis is important for fine-motorical tasks such as threading a needle.",

The left ventricular outflow tract extends from the tip of the anterior mitral valvar leaflet to the junction of the sinuses of Valsalva with the ascending aorta. VEINS OF THE HEART# The coronary sinus is the main vein of the coronary circulation.- It lies in the posterior coronary sulcus.- It drains to an opening in the right atrium.# All veins of the heart (including the great cardiac vein, the posterior vein of the left ventricle, the oblique vein of the left atrium, and the right marginal vein) except anterior cardiac and venae Cordis minimis (which open directly into the right atrium) drain into the coronary sinus which opens into the right atrium. Educational point: Ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm# Any of the three aortic sinuses of Valsalva may become aneurysmal and rupture. The right and non-coronary cusps are most often affected; rupture of the non-coronary sinus aneurysm is nearly always into the right atrium and of the right coronary sinus into the right ventricle or atrium. Rupture usually occurs in early adulthood and may be precipitated by endocarditis. If sudden, it is accompanied by tearing chest pain, breathlessness, and congestive cardiac failure with a loud continuous murmur.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Bronchoscopy * During thoracic surgery, there is a need for one lung to be deflated and or isolated. This offers the surgeon easier and better access within the designated hemothorax. In order to achieve these double-lumen endobronchial tubes are used that allow the anesthetist to selectively deflate one lung while maintaining standard ventilation of the other. Components of the Double lumen tube. Double lumen endobronchial tube has two separate color-coded lumens each with its own level. One lumen ends in the trachea and the other lumen ends in either the left or right main bronchus. Each lumen has its own cuff (tracheal a bronchial cuffs) and color-coded pilot balloons. The proximal end of these tubes is connected to a breathing system. Mechanism of action. Because of the differing anatomy of the main bronchi and their branches, both right and left versions of any particular double lumen tube must exist. Once correctly positioned the anesthetist can selectively ventilate one lung, so for operations requiring that the right lung is deflated, a left-sided double lumen tube would be used that enables selective ventilation of the left lung alone and vice versa. How to confirm the position of the double Lumen tube? The position of the tubes should be checked by auscultation immediately after intubation and after positioning the patient for operation. The auscultatory method for checking the correct placement of tube is lust a clinical method for ensuring correct placement of the tube and the confirmation of correct placement of the tube should be the done by flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy. What is the use of end-tidal CO2 determination (Et. CO2) in intubation?. The Et. C02 can be used to confirm the position of the endotracheal tube. (whether the tube is in esophagus or trachea). The persistent detection of CO2 by a capnograph is the best confirmation of tracheal placement of an endotracheal tube (Et. CO2). Note: Capnography can detect whether the tube is in trachea or esophagus but cannot differentiate between tracheal intubation and endobronchial intubation because in both these cases there will be the persistent detection of CO2.

She states that the itching has worsened such that it is interfering with her everyday life.",
        "exp": "Ans- D Erythematous urticarial patches and plaques (classically periumbilical) that progress to tense vesicles and blisters in a pregnant woman is herpes gestationis (also known as pemphigoid gestationis). There is no association to the husband's URI. Herpes gestationis is a pruritic blistering dermatologic disorder unique to pregnancy. It is not associated with past or present herpes infection. The onset is generally later in pregnancy (second trimester or later). The distribution involves the abdomen or extremities but may be generalized. It is thought to be an autoimmune condition triggered by pregnancy, with antibodies against hemidesmosomal proteins. It is associated with other autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Grave's disease, or pernicious anemia. Tunzi et al. describe some of the major pregnancy-specific skin conditions, which include pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy, prurigo of pregnancy, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, pemphigoid gestationis, impetigo herpetiformis, and pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy. The majority of skin conditions resolve postpartum and require only symptomatic treatment. Lipozencic et al. detail the specifics of diagnosing pemphigoid gestationis, which includes the presence of subepidermal vesicles on routine histologic examination and the linear deposition of C3 and IgG along the basement membrane of perilesional skin. Detection of C3 and IgG is accomplished by immunofluorescence microscopy. Figure A displays the classic findings of vesicular skin lesions in a pregnant woman with herpes gestationis.

        "question": "Physiological jaundice of newborn may be managed by all except -",
        "exp": "Ans. b (Phenytoin sodium). (Ref. Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 17th ed., 593, 597) # Jaundice during the 1st 24 hrs of life warrants diagnostic evaluation and should be considered to be due to hemolysis until proved otherwise. Septicemia and intrauterine infections such as syphilis, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasmosis should also be considered, especially in infants with an increase in plasma direct-reacting bilirubin. # Jaundice after the 1st 24 hrs may be \"physiologic\" or may be due to septicemia, hemolytic anemia, galactosemia, hepatitis, congenital atresia of the bile ducts, inspissated bile syndrome after erythroblastosis fetalis, syphilis, herpes simplex, or other congenital infections. Physiologic jaundice (icterus neonatorum) # Under normal circumstances, the level of indirect-reacting bilirubin in umbilical cord serum is l-3mg/dL and rises at a rate of less than 5mg/dL/24hr; thus, jaundice becomes visible on the 2nd-3rd day, usually peaking between the 2nd and 4th days at 5-6 mg/dL and decreasing to below 2mg/dL between the 5th - 7th days of life. # Jaundice associated with these changes is designated \"physiologic\" and is believed to be the result of increased bilirubin production after the breakdown of fetal red blood cells combined with transient limitation in the conjugation of bilirubin by the liver. # Risk factors for indirect hyperbilirubinemia include maternal diabetes, race (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Native American), prematurity, drugs (vitamin K3, novobiocin), altitude, polycythemia, male sex, trisomy 21, cutaneous bruising, cephalohematoma, oxytocin induction, breastfeeding, weight loss (dehydration or caloric deprivation), delayed bowel movement, and a sibling who had physiologic jaundice. # A family history of neonatal jaundice, exclusive breastfeeding, bruising, cephalohematoma, Asian race, and maternal age older than 25 yr identify approximately 60% of cases of extreme hyperbilirubinemia. # Indirect bilirubin levels in full-term infants decline to adult levels (mg/dL) by 10-14 days of life. # Persistent indirect hyperbilirubinemia beyond 2 wk suggests hemolysis, hereditary glucuronosyl transferase deficiency, breast milk jaundice, hypothyroidism, or intestinal obstruction. Jaundice associated with pyloric stenosis may be due to caloric deprivation, deficiency of hepatic UDP-glucuronyl transferase or ileus-induced increased enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. Treatment of hyperbilirubinemia Phototherapy # Clinical jaundice and indirect hyperbilirubinemia are reduced on exposure to a high intensity of light in the visible spectrum. # Bilirubin absorbs light maximally in the blue range (420-470 nm). Nonetheless, broad-spectrum white, blue, special narrow-spectrum (super) blue, less often, green lights are effective in reducing bilirubin levels. # Bilirubin in the skin absorbs light energy, which by photo-isomerization converts the toxic native unconjugated 4Z, 15Z-bilirubin into the unconjugated configurational isomer 4Z, 15E-bilirubin. # Phototherapy also converts native bilirubin, by an irreversible reaction, to the structural isomer lumirubin, which is excreted by the kidneys in the unconjugated state. # When indications for exchange transfusion are present, phototherapy should not be used as a substitute. # However, phototherapy may reduce the need for repeated exchange transfusions in infants with hemolysis. # Phototherapy is indicated only after the presence of pathologic hyperbilirubinemia has been established. # The basic cause or causes of jaundice should be treated concomitantly. # Prophylactic phototherapy in VLBW infants may prevent hyperbilirubinemia and may reduce the incidence of exchange transfusions. # Dark skin does not reduce the efficacy of phototherapy. # Maximal intensive phototherapy should be used when indirect bilirubin levels approach. Such therapy includes \"special blue\" fluorescent tubes, placing the lamps within 15-20 cm of the infant, and placing a fiberoptic phototherapy blanket under the infant's back to increase the exposed surface area. # Complications of phototherapy include loose stools, erythematous macular rash, a purpuric rash associated with transient porphyrinemia, overheating and dehydration (increased insensible water loss, diarrhea), chilling from exposure of the infant, and bronze baby syndrome. # Phototherapy is contraindicated in the presence of porphyria. # The term bronze baby syndrome refers to a dark grayish brown discoloration of the skin sometimes noted in infants undergoing phototherapy. Almost all infants observed with this syndrome have had a mixed type of hyperbilirubinemia with significant elevation of direct-reacting bilirubin and often with other evidence of obstructive liver disease. # Those using phototherapy should remain alert to these possibilities and avoid any unnecessary use because untoward effects on DNA have been demonstrated in vitro. Exchange transfusion. # Exchange transfusion is performed if intensive phototherapy has failed to reduce bilirubin levels to a safe range and if the risk of kernicterus exceeds the risk of the procedure or the infant has signs of kernicterus. # Potential complications from exchange transfusion are not trivial and include acidosis, electrolyte abnormalities, hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia, volume overload, arrhythmias, NEC, infection, graft vs host disease, and death. # The appearance of clinical signs suggesting kernicterus is an indication for exchange transfusion at any level of serum bilirubin. Other therapies # Tin (Sn)-protoporphyrin (or tin-mesoporphyrin) administration has been proposed for reduction of bilirubin. It may inhibit the conversion of biliverdin to bilirubin by heme oxygenase. A single intramuscular dose on the 1st day of life may reduce the need for phototherapy. Such therapy may be beneficial when jaundice is anticipated (G6. PD deficiency) or when blood products are discouraged (Jehovah's Witness). Complications include transient erythema if the infant is receiving phototherapy. # IV immunoglobulin (500 mg/kg/dose over a 4hr period), given ql2hr for 3 doses, is effective in reducing bilirubin levels in patients with Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia, presumably by reducing hemolysis.",

Wound treatment Thorough washing of the wound with soap/detergent and water, followed by the application of ethanol or an aqueous solution of iodine or povidone. 2. Passive immunization Human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) or equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG) or F(ab')2 products should be used for category III exposures as well as for some category II exposures (see table above). Passive immunization should be administered just before or shortly after administration of the first dose of vaccine given in the post-exposure prophylaxis regimen. If it is not immediately available, passive immunization can be administered up until the seventh day after initiation of the primary series of postexposure prophylaxis (with cell-culture or embryonated-egg rabies vaccine). Dosage and administration: The dose for HRIG is 20 IU/kg body weight and for ERIG and F(ab')2 products 40 IU/kg body weight. The full dose of rabies immunoglobulin, or as much as is anatomically feasible, should be administered into and around the wound site. Any remainder should be injected i. m. at a site distant from the site of active vaccine administration. Multiple needle injections into the wound should be avoided. If the correct dose of rabies immunoglobulin is too small to infiltrate all wounds, as might be true of a severely bitten individual, it can be diluted in physiological buffered saline to ensure greater wound coverage. 3. Active immunization Cell-culture- or embryonated-egg-based rabies vaccines should always be used for post-exposure prophylaxis. They can be administered either i. m. or i. d. Intramuscular regimens: Both a five-dose and a four-dose i. m. regimen are recommended for post-exposure vaccination; the fivedose regimen is the more commonly used: The five-dose regimen is administered on days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 into the deltoid muscle. The four-dose regimen is administered as two doses on day 0 (one dose in the right and one in the left arm (deltoid muscles), and then one dose on each of days 7 and 21 into the deltoid muscle. An alternative post-exposure regimen for healthy, fully immunocompetent exposed people who receive wound care plus high-quality rabies immunoglobulin plus WHO-prequalified rabies vaccines consists of four doses administered i. m. on days 0, 3, 7 and 14. Intradermal regimens: Intradermal administration of cell-culture- and embryonated-egg-based rabies vaccines has been successfully used in many developing countries that cannot afford the five- or four-dose i. m. schedules. The two-site i. d. method: one i. d. injection at two sites on days 0, 3, 7 and 28.

        "question": "Wavelength of carbon dioxide laser is?",
        "exp": "Ans- A 10600 nm Ref- CO2 Lasers Definition: infrared lasers based on a gas mixture in which light is amplified by carbon dioxide molecules The CO2 laser (carbon dioxide laser) is a molecular gas laser based on a gas mixture as the gain medium, which contains carbon dioxide (CO2), helium (He), nitrogen (N2), and possibly some hydrogen (H2), water vapor and/or xenon (Xe). Such a laser is electrically pumped via a gas discharge, which can be operated with DC current, with AC current (e. g. 20-50 k. Hz) or in the radio frequency (RF) domain. Nitrogen molecules are excited by the discharge into a metastable vibrational level and transfer their excitation energy to the CO2 molecules when colliding with them. Helium serves to depopulate the lower laser level and to remove the heat. Other constituents such as hydrogen or water vapor can help (particularly in sealed-tube lasers) to reoxidize carbon monoxide (formed in the discharge) to carbon dioxide. Figure 1: Schematic setup of a sealed-tube carbon dioxide laser. The gas tube has Brewster windows and is water-cooled. CO2 lasers typically emit at a wavelength of 10. 6 mm, but there are other lines in the region of 9-11 mm (particularly at 9. 6 mm). In most cases, average powers are between some tens of watts and many kilowatts. The power conversion efficiency can be well above 10%, i. e., it is higher than for most gas lasers (due to a particularly favorable excitation pathway), also higher than for lamp-pumped solid-state lasers, but lower than for many diode-pumped lasers. - Laser Types The family of CO2 lasers is very diverse: For laser powers between a few watts and a several hundred watts, it is common to use sealed-tube or no-flow lasers, where the laser bore and gas supply are contained in a sealed tube. Such lasers are compact and rugged, and reach operation lifetimes of several thousands of hours. High-power diffusion-cooled slab lasers (not to be confused with solid-state slab lasers) have the gas in a gap between a pair of planar water-cooled RF electrodes. The excess heat is efficiently transferred to the electrodes by diffusion, if the electrode spacing is made small compared with the electrode width. Several kilowatts of output are possible. Fast axial flow lasers and fast transverse flow lasers are also suitable for multi-kilowatt continuous-wave output powers. The excess heat is removed by the fast-flowing gas mixture, which passes an external cooler before being used again in the discharge. Transverse excited atmosphere (TEA) lasers have a very high (about atmospheric) gas pressure. As the voltage required for a longitudinal discharge would be too high, transverse excitation is done with a series of electrodes along the tube. TEA lasers are operated in pulsed mode only, as the gas discharge would not be stable at high pressures. They often produce average output powers below 100 W, but can also be made for powers of tens of kilowatts (combined with high pulse repetition rates). There are gas dynamic CO2 lasers for multi-megawatt powers (e. g. for anti-missile weapons), where the energy is not provided by a gas discharge but by a chemical reaction in a kind of rocket engine. The concepts differ mainly in the technique of heat extraction, but also in the gas pressure and electrode geometry used. In low-power sealed-tube lasers (used e. g. for laser marking), waste heat is transported to the tube walls by diffusion or a slow gas flow. The beam quality can be very high. High-power CO2 lasers utilize a fast forced gas convection, which may be in the axial direction (i. e., along the beam direction) or in the transverse direction (for the highest powers). - Applications CO2 lasers are widely used for material processing, in particular for cutting plastic materials, wood, die boards, etc., exhibiting high absorption at 10. 6 mm, and requiring moderate power levels of 20-200 W cutting and welding metals such as stainless steel, aluminum or copper, applying multi-kilowatt powers laser marking of various materials. Other applications include laser surgery (including ophthalmology) and range finding. CO2 lasers used for material processing (e. g. welding and cutting of metals, or laser marking) are in competition with solid-state lasers (particularly YAG lasers and fiber lasers) operating in the 1-mm wavelength regime. These shorter wavelengths have the advantages of more efficient absorption in a metallic workpiece, and the potential for beam delivery via fiber cables. (There are no optical fibers for high-power 10-mm laser beams.) The potentially smaller beam parameter product of 1-mm lasers can also be advantageous. However, the latter potential normally cannot be realized with high-power lamp-pumped lasers, and diode-pumped lasers tend to be more expensive. For these reasons, CO2 lasers are still widely used in the cutting and welding business, particularly for parts with a thickness greater than a few millimeters, and their sales make more than 10% of all global laser sales (as of 2013). This may to some extent change in the future due to the development of high-power thin-disk lasers and advanced fiber cables in combination with techniques which exploit the high beam quality of such lasers. Due to their high powers and high drive voltages, CO2 lasers raise serious issues of laser safety. However, their long operation wavelength makes them relatively eye-safe at low intensities. - Bibliography C. K. N.

Approximately 85% of prenatally treated female infants are born with normal or slightly Virilize genitalia. This treatment is most effective in preventing abnormal genital development in affected female fetuses when it is initiated as soon as pregnancy is initiated. Very early diagnosis is required because virilization of affected female, fetuses begin as early as four weeks. Rapid genotyping of fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling at 8-10 weeks of gestation appears to be the best approach but therapy must be started at the time of first missed menstrual period, well before the molecular diagnosis is available. If the treatment cannot be begun by nine weeks it should not be given at all. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is an autosomal recessive disorder causing absent or deficient cortisol production. The most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia arises from mutations in \"CYP21. A2 \" gene encoding the 21 hydroxylase enzyme. Severely affected female fetuses undergo virilization.* Treating the fetus prenatally with glucocorticoid administration to the mother has been shown to decrease or even prevent this virilization. However, the current approach to prenatal treatment means that unaffected as well as affected fetuses are exposed to dexamethasone and this treatment may have a side effect, particularly on the central nervous system. Prenatal treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia with dexamethasone remains controversial because to prevent ambiguous genitalia in some fetus we have to risk 8 pregnancies to corticosteroid treatment. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is an autosomal recessive disorder. If both the parents are carrier the fetus will have one in four chance of having congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Furthermore, only half of the affected fetuses will be females hence treatment is only potentially beneficial for only one in eight fetuses. (Remember, that only female fetuses need treatment for virilization. Male fetuses do not undergo virilization). To prevent female virilization treatment must be started very early in the first trimester (essentially as soon as a pregnancy test is positive) before it is possible to determine the sex and whether or not the child is affected by congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Therefore 7 of 8 pregnancies will be treated unnecessarily to prevent 1 case of ambiguous genitalia. The diagnosis of CAH can only be made after 9-12 weeks by chorionic villus biopsy: But the treatment should begin much earlier than this as the virilization starts as soon as 4-6 weeks after gestation. Therapy must be started at the time of first missed menstrual period well before the molecular diagnosis is available. This treatment should be initiated as soon as pregnancy is recognized. If treatment cannot be begun by nine weeks of gestation, it should not be given at all. Treatment is discontinued if genetic testing reveals a male fetus or an unaffected female. Since the risk of having an affected female fetus is one in eight when both parents are known carrier, seven in eight infants will receive unnecessary treatment.* Since glucocorticoid treatment is associated with some adverse effect there have been objections or controversies surrounding the prenatal treatment. Corticosteroids are most often used in pregnancy to promote fetal lung maturation before impending premature delivery. But in this use betamethasone is given only for few days rather than for several weeks to months as in congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Glucocorticoids are neurotoxic in fetal and animal studies and accumulating evidence is showing mildly adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in treated human fetuses. Therefore it does not seem logical to submit 7 of 8 fetuses to any risk whatsoever when the treatment cannot benefit them, but instead potentially benefits in 8 affected. Taken together the safety of corticosteroid has not been established and the potential risk to the mother. It seems prudent to provide prenatal dexamethasone treatment in a research setting. Treatment should only be managed by an experienced team and parents should be fully informed.",

In Friedrich's ataxia, both cord and peripheral nerve involvement accompany cerebellar degeneration.

Pain, tingling sensations, and hypoesthesia in the distribution of the median nerve are the cardinal manifestations. These often undergo exacerbations at nighttime. A shock-like pain upon percussion on the volar aspect of the wrist (Tinel sign) is an additional characteristic sign. Carpal tunnel syndrome is most often idiopathic, but may represent a manifestation of underlying disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, acromegaly, and leukemia. Carpal tunnel syndrome may be confused with angina pectoris when located on the left side. However, angina pectoris typically manifests with physical or emotional stress and very rarely results in pain limited to the hand. Dupuytren contracture is a relatively common disorder characterized by fibrous thickening of the palmar fascia. Contracture and nodule formation ensue. This condition is most common in Caucasian men over 50. Fibrositis also known as fibromyalgia, refers to a poorly understood syndrome of widespread musculoskeletal pain associated with tenderness in multiple trigger points. Fatigue, headache, and numbness are also common. Women between 20 and 50 years of age are most commonly affected. Neck, shoulders, low back and hips are usually involved. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy describes a syndrome of pain and swelling of one extremity (most commonly a hand), associated with skin atrophy. It is thought to be secondary to vasomotor instability.

The mouth, tongue and fauces become corroded and appears grayish white.* Signs and symptoms of chronic mercury poisoning are: 1) Excessive salivation, metallic taste, loosening of teeth, and blue black lining on gums (similar to lead poisoning). 2) Diphtheria like membranous colitis and dysentery. 3) Anorexia, insomnia, sweating, nausea, irritability and photophobia. 4) Special features are: i) Mercuria lentis: Brownish deposition of mercury on anterior lens capsule. ii) Tremors: There are moderately coarse, intentional tremors starting in fingers and hands, and legs. They are also called Danbury tremors or hatter's shake or glass blower's shake. In severe form, patient becomes unable to dress, write or walk, i. e. concussion mercurialis (shaking palsy). iii) Erethism (neuropsychiatric changes): The personality disturbance is characterized by shyness, irritability, tremors, loss of memory and insomnia. There may be depression, delusion, hallucination and MDP (mad hatter). iv) Acrodynia (Pink disease): This is idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction with a generalized pinkish rash described as 5P: pinkish, puffy, painful, paraesthesia hands and peeling of skin. v) Minimata disease: It is due to organic mercury poisoning due to eating fish poisoned by mercury. vi) Membranous glomerulopathy.",

        "exp": "Ans: B (Longitudinal muscle fibers) Ref: Grays Anatomy 40th edition. Explanation: Internal anal sphincter. The internal anal sphincter is a well-defined ring of obliquely orientated smooth muscle fibers that is continuous with the circular muscle of the rectum, and which terminates at the junction of the superficial and subcutaneous components of the external sphincter. Its thickness varies between 1. 5 and 3. 5 mm, depending upon the height within the anal canal and whether the canal Is distended. It is usually thinner in females and becomes thicker with age. It may also be thickened in disease processes such as rectal prolapse and chronic constipation. The lower portion of the sphincter is crossed by fibers from the conjoint longitudinal coat which passes into the submucosa of the lower canal. External anal sphincter. The externa] anal sphincter is an oval tube-shaped complex of striated muscle, composed mainly of type 1 (slow twitch) skeletal muscle fibers, which are well suited to prolonged contraction. Endoanal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the uppermost fibers blend with the lowest fibers of puborectalis. In the upper third, some of these upper fibers decussate anteriorly into the superficial transverse perineal muscles and posteriorly some fibers are attached to the anococcygeal raphe. The majority of the fibers of the middle third of the external anal sphincter surround the lower part of the internal sphincter. The middle third is attached anteriorly to the perineal body and posteriorly to the coccyx via the anococcygeal ligament: some fibers from each side of the sphincter decussate in these areas to form a commissure in the anterior and posterior midline. The fibers of the low er third lie below the level of the internal anal sphincter and are separated from the lowest anal epithelium by submucosa.",

Branched-chain keto acid dehy drogenase which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of branched chain keto amino acids, i. e. leucine, isoleucine and valine. o Thiamine diphosphate is also the coenzume for transketolase, in the pentose phosphate pathway.

The process begins immediately after the circulation stops, and in a person dying slowly with circulatory failure, it may be pronounced very shortly after death. This is due to the release of fibrinolysins, especially from small calibre vessels, e. g. capillaries, and from serous surfaces, e. g. the pleura. Clots may persist when the mass of clot is too large to be liquified by the fibrinolysin available at the site of clot formation. In some deaths associated with infection and cachexia, this fibrinolytic effect may fail to develop, explaining the presence of abundant clot in the bean and large calibre vessels. Thus, in cases of sudden death the blood remains spontaneously coagulable only during a brief period immediately following death; it then becomes completely free from fibrinogen and will never again clot. This incoagulability of the blood is a commonplace observation at autopsy. The normal colour of areas of post mortem lividity is a cyanotic hue, but this description should not be used since it is misleading. The development of lividity is too variable to serve as a useful indicator of the time of death.",

Open AED case and turn the device ON 2.) Expose the victim's chest 3.) Attach AED pads to victim's chest 4.) Do not touch the victim when AED is ANALYZING 5.) Before delivering SHOCK, make sure the victim's chest is clear, no one is touching the victim, and the area around the victim is clear. 6.) Press the SHOCK button 7.) Resume CPR for 2 minutes 8.) Repeat cycle of: CPR - analyzing - shock if indicated - CPR AED Usage Points of Emphasis - Do not place the pads over a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator - Remove the victim from water and dry the chest before applying pads - Excessive hair will impede pad contact. Quickly remove the pad and replace with a new set to ensure adequate contact with the chest wall - Remove any medication patches from the chest - Make sure the pads do not touch each other - If the device malfunctions, do not troubleshoot. Return immediately to high-quality CPR CPR WITH AN ADVANCED AIRWAY Airway Equipment Options - Supraglottic Devices - Laryngeal Mask Airway - Combitube - Endotracheal Tube MOUTH-TO-MOUTH BREATHING Steps For Adult and Child Mouth-to-Mouth Steps For Infant Mouth-to-Mouth CHOKING RELIEF Heimlich Maneuver Steps 1.) Stand behind the victim 2.) Wrap arms behind victim and place fist of one hand below victim's rib cage just above bellybutton 3.) Grasp fist with the other hand 4.) Quickly pull inward and upward 5.) Continue until choking is relieved or victim becomes unconscious Abdominal Thrust Steps 1.) Straddle knees on either side of the victim's hips 2.) Place heel of one hand above the navel, but below breast bone 3.) Quickly press inward and upward 4.) Continue until obstruction is relieved or victim becomes unconscious Back Blows and Chest Thrust Steps (for Infant Victims) 1.) Rest infant facedown on your forearm 2.) Support their head and face with your hand 3.) Deliver 5 back blows between the shoulder blades 4.) Turn the victim over and support the back of their head 5.) Use 2 fingers and deliver 5 chest thrusts over the sternum 6.) Repeat back blows, alternated with chest thrusts, until choking is relieved or the infant becomes unresponsive COMMON ABBREVIATIONS TO KNOW AED | Automated external defibrillator AHA | American Heart Association BLS | Basic life support BP | Blood pressure CAB | Circulation, airway, breathing CPR | Cardiopulmonary resuscitation EMS | Emergency medical services ET | Endotracheal ICU | Intensive care unit IHCA | In-hospital cardiac arrest IN | Intranasal IM | Intramuscular IO | Intraosseous IV | Intravenous LMA | Laryngeal Mask Airway LV | Left ventricle OHCA | Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest PAD | Public Access Defibrillation PEA | Pulseless electrical activity p.

An extract of tuberculin (an antigen of lipoprotein composition obtained from the tubercle bacillus) is injected into the skin of a person who has had tuberculosis or has been immunized against tuberculosis. Merriory helper T cells react to the tuberculin and secrete Il-2, which up regulates Il-2 receptors. Il-2 binding to Il-2 receptors on the same cell is an example of autocrine regulation in which a cell secretes a ligand for a receptor on its own surface. The result of this up regulation and ligand receptor binding is an increase in T cell proliferation. T cell derived cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and beta (TN F\u03b1 and \u03b2) induce leukocyte recruitment. Production of gamma-(\u03b3)-interferon by helper T cells attracts and activates macrophages (monocytes comprise most of the cellular infiltrate). \u03b3 -Interferon also converts other cells (such asendothelial cells) to antigen-presenting cells by induction of class II MHC expression, which further augments the response. The result of the activity of helper T cells is a dramatic increase in the number of lymphocytes and macrophages at the test site, which produces swelling. IL-I is synthesized by antigen-presenting cells and macro phages with helper T cells as the targets.",

It is usually more than 24 hours after delivery before the symptoms and signs appear. Some of the most common bacteria are: streptococci staphylococci escherichia coli (E. coli) clostridium tetani clostridium welchii chlamydia gonococci SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS are fever (temperature of 38degC or more) chills and general malaise lower abdominal pain tender uterus subinvolution of the uterus purulent, foul-smelling lochia. light vaginal bleeding shock. RISK FACTORS Some women are more vulnerable to puerperal sepsis, including anemia and/or malnourished, protracted labour, prolonged rupture of the membranes, frequent vaginal examinations, a traumatic delivery, caesarean section and retained placental fragments, PPH, diabetes all predispose to puerperal infection. SITES The most common site of infection in puerperal sepsis is the placental site. Other sites of infection are abdominal and perineal wounds following surgery and lacerations of the genital tract, e. g. cervix, vagina and perineum. Following delivery, puerperal sepsis may be localized in the perineum, vagina, cervix or uterus. Infection of the uterus can spread rapidly if due to virulent organisms, or if the mother's resistance is impaired. It can extend beyond the uterus to involve the fallopian tubes and ovaries, to the pelvic cellular tissue causing parametritis, to the pelvic peritoneum, causing peritonitis, and into the blood stream causing septicaemia DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Fever in the puerperium can also be caused by: urinary tract infection (acute pyelonephritis) wound infection (e. g. scar of caesarean section) mastitis or breast abscess thrombo-embolic disorders, e. g. thrombophlebitis or deep vein thrombosis respiratory tract infections",

        "exp": "Ans-A i. e., the Transepithelial nasal potential difference Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis Sweat chloride testing. The sweat test is the standard approach to diagnosis. The diagnosis is made by elevated sodium and chloride level in the sweat > 60 meq/l. Two tests on different days are required for accurate diagnosis. A normal sweat chloride does not exclude the diagnosis. Genotyping and other tests such as measurement of nasal membrane potential difference, the pancreatic function should be done if there is high clinical suspicion of cystic fibrosis. Nasal potential difference. Measurement of nasal transepithelial potential difference in vivo can be a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Individuals with cystic fibrosis demonstrate a significantly more negative baseline nasal potential difference, with the topical application of amiloride there is a loss of this potential difference. The nasal potential difference is a sensitive test of electrolyte transport (CFTR) function that can be used to support or refute a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Genetic analysis. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder. It is caused due to a defect in CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein. Cystic fibrosis is associated with a large number of mutations. More than 1500 CFTR polymorphisms are associated with cystic fibrosis syndrome. The most prevalent mutation of CFTR is the deletion of a single phenylalanine residue at amino acid A508. This mutation is responsible for high incidence of cystic fibrosis in northern European populations. Approximately 50% of individuals with CF who are of northern European ancestry are homozygous for A508 and > 70% carry at least one A508 gene. The remainder of patients has an extensive array of mutation, none of which has the prevalence of more than several percents. Testing for cystic fibrosis mutation was not possible because of the large no. of mutations associated with the disease. Now day's commercial laboratories test for 30-80 of the most common CFTR mutations. This testing identifies > 90% of individuals who carry 2 CF mutations. Nowhere it is mentioned in the texts that testing only for A508 is enough for diagnosis. Detection of at least 2 CF mutations is necessary for making the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The patient has features of cystic fibrosis but sweat chloride levels are normal. To diagnose cystic fibrosis in this patient, another laboratory evidence demonstrating CFTR dysfunction is required. This can be done by two methods:-Demonstrating abnormal potential difference. Demonstrating abnormal CF mutations. But the diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis requires. Demonstration of two CF mutations (demonstration of single abnormal F508 mutation is not enough). So we are left with abnormal nasal potential difference. It is an established laboratory evidence for CFTR dysfunction and is accepted as a diagnostic criteria to establish the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.",

Treatment of Graves disease o The therapeutic approach to Graves' hyperthyroidism consists of both # Rapid amelioration of symptoms with a beta-blocker # Measures aimed at decreasing thyroid hormone synthesis: the administration of a thionamide, radioiodine ablation, or surgery. i) Amelioration of symptoms Beta-blockers o Beta-blockers ameliorate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism that are caused by increased beta-adrenergic tone. o These include palpitations, tachycardia, tremulousness, anxiety, and heat intolerance. o Thus, a beta-blocker should be started (assuming there are no contraindications to its use) in most patients as soon as the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is made, even before obtaining a 24-hour radioiodine uptake. ii) Drugs and measures used to decrease thyroid hormone synthesis Thionamides o The thioamide methimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) are the primary drugs used to treat Graves' hyperthyroidism. o Methimazole is preferred because of its longer duration of action, allowing for once-daily dosing, more rapid efficacy, and lower incidence of side effects. o PTU is preferred during the first trimester of pregnancy because of the potential teratogenic effects of methimazole. o The goal of thionamide therapy in Graves' hyperthyroidism is to attain a euthyroid state within three to eight weeks. o This can be followed by ablative therapy with radioiodine or surgery' or by continuation of the drug for a prolonged period (usually one to two years) with the hope of attaining a permanent remission. iodinated contrast agents and pine o Patients who have severe hyperthyroidism or are allergic to thionamides may benefit from alternative medical therapies. o The oral radiocontrast agent's sodium iodate and iopanoic acid are potent inhibitors of the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. o They are not used as primary therapy because of possible induction of resistant hyperthyroidism, o However, when given in combination with methimazole (at doses of500 to 1000 mg/day), they can rapidly ameliorate severe hyperthyroidism and can also be used to prepare a hyperthyroid patient for early surgery. Other medications - o A number of other medications have been used in the management of hyperthyroidism, including the following: o Glucocorticoids Inhibit peripheral T4 to T3 conversion and, in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism, reduce thyroid secretion. They have been used in patients with severe hyperthyroidism and thyroid storm, although their efficacy is not well demonstrated. o Lithium Blocks thyroid hormone release, but its use has been limited by its toxicity. o Cholestyramine Given in a dose of 4 g four times daily with methimazole, lowers serum T4 and T3 concentrations more rapidly than methimazole alone, and may be useful adjunctive therapy in selected patients who require rapid amelioration of hyperthyroid symptoms. o Carnitine # Is a naturally occurring peripheral antagonist of thyroid hormone action that has been shown to ameliorate hyperthyroid symptoms and may prove to be useful clinically. o Rituximab A monoclonal antibody that causes peripheral B cell depletion, may induce a sustained remission in patients with Graves' disease and low TRAb levels, but its cost and side effects limit its utility. Radioiodine ablation o Radioiodine is widely used for the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism. o It has been the therapy of choice. o Although a thionamide provides control of hyperthyroidism as long as the drug is taken, the persistent remission rate when the drug is discontinued one to two years later averages only about 30 percent. However, there are patients in whom it may be reasonable to delay radioiodine (or surgery). Included in this group are patients with mild hyperthyroidism and patients with small goiters or with goiters that shrink during thionamide therapy. o Radioiodine is administered as a capsule or, less commonly, an oral solution of sodium 1311, which is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract and concentrated in thyroid tissue. o It induces extensive tissue damage, resulting in ablation of the thyroid within 6 to 18 weeks. The goal of radioiodine therapy is the destruction of the gland, with the early development of hypothyroidism. This eliminates the risk of recurrent hyperthyroidism. Surgery o Surgery is an unpopular therapy for Graves' hyperthyroidism, being selected by only 1 percent of thyroid specialists. o It is primarily indicated in patients who have an obstructive goiter or a very large goiter, in patients with active ophthalmopathy who desire definitive therapy for their hyperthyroidism, in pregnant women who are allergic to antithyroid drugs, and in patients who have allergies or poor compliance on antithyroid drugs but refuse radioiodine. Surgery would also be indicated if there was a coexisting suspicious or malignant thyroid nodule or primary hyperparathyroidism.",

This reflex is elicited by stroking the superior and medial part of the thigh in a downward direction. The normal response in males is a contraction of the cremasteric muscle that pulls up the scrotum and testis on the side stroked. In children, the reflex may be over exaggerated and this can lead to the mistaken diagnosis of undescended testes. Upper and lower motor neuron disorders can cause an absence of the cremasteric reflex (a superficial reflex). The most appropriate answer to this mcq is genitofemoral nerve(GFN) only. The afferent limb of cremasteric reflex is carried by the femoral branch of GFN (FB- GFN) and ilioinguinal nerve(IIN) both. There is a significant overlap between the cutaneous territories of femoral branch of GFN (FB- GFN) and ilioinguinal (IIN) nerves, especially on the medial side of the thigh and there arises the confusion! We choose FB- GFN as first and IIN in as second choice in preferential order. The efferent is a genital branch of GFN (GB- GFN)",

D Fibrous dysplasia Ref- Image - Clinical Features Patients with small, monostotic lesions may be asymptomatic, with the osseous abnormality identified incidentally on radiologic studies obtained for unrelated reasons. However, bone pain, swelling, and tenderness are common presentations in symptomatic patients. Endocrine disturbances may be the initial presentation in some patients. This section will briefly review the common affected locations of fibrous dysplasia, fibrous dysplasia deformity and fracture, and malignant transformation for this lesion. Affected locations The most common sites of skeletal involvement in monostotic fibrous dysplasia are the ribs, proximal femur, and craniofacial bones, typically the posterior maxilla. The lesion may involve only a small segment of bone or it may occupy its entire length. In polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, the spectrum of involvement varies from 2 bones to more than 75% of the skeleton. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is most commonly found in the femur, tibia, pelvis, and foot. Other sites less commonly affected include the ribs, skull, and bones of the upper extremity. Uncommonly affected bones include the lumbar spine, clavicle, and the cervical spine. Deformity and fracture The most common physical deformities are leg-length discrepancy, facial asymmetry due to hemicranial involvement, and rib deformities. Fracture is the most common complication in fibrous dysplasia. It is seen in more than half of the patients with the polyostotic form of the disease. Deformities in weight-bearing bones can occur. Almost 75% of patients with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia are symptomatic, with pain, deformity, or pathologic fractures. Malignant transformation Malignant transformation of fibrous dysplasia occurs very infrequently, with reported prevalences ranging from 0. 4% to 4%. Previous irradiation has been documented in more than half of the cases with malignant transformation. The most common malignant tumors are osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma, and the majority of patients are older than thirty years when the sarcoma is diagnosed. The craniofacial region is the most common site of involvement, followed by the femur, tibia, and pelvis. The rate of malignant transformation is higher for polyostotic lesions than for monostotic lesions.",

It begins with condensation of four carbon oxaloacetate molecule with 2 carbon acetyl CoA molecule to form six carbon citrate molecule. In a subsequent reaction, two carbon atoms are lost in the form of CO2 at two different reactions. A series of modifications occur in the remaining four carbon atoms to ultimately form oxaloacetate. Thus the last substrate (oxaloacetate) of one cycle is ready for use as a substrate in the next cycle. In this way, there is no net generation of OAA, or of any of the cycle intermediates. o So, two carbon atoms enter the cycle as acetyl CoA (and condense with oxaloacetate) and two carbons leave in the form of two molecules of CO2. Thus, TCA cycle basically involves oxidation of acetyl CoA to CO2 and as such, there is no net consumption or regeneration of oxaloacetate or any of the other cycle intermediates. o Argininosuccinase (argininosuccinate lyase) catalyzes the cleavage of argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate. o Thus, in argininosuccinase deficiency arginine cannot be produced. o Supplementation with arginine base helps to replenish this amino acid.",

Fig. 32: Puff of smoke appearance on cerebral angiography is seen in Moyamoya disease Moyamoya disease Moyamoya disease is a progressive, occlusive disease of the cerebral vasculature with particular involvement of the circle of Willis and the arteries that feed it. Steno- occlusive areas are usually bilateral The term moyamoya (Japanese for \"puff of smoke\") refers to the appearance on angiography of abnormal vascular collateral networks that develop adjacent to the stenotic vessels. Pathology: Characterized by intimal thickening in the walls of the terminal portions of the internal carotid vessels bilaterally. The proliferating intima may contain lipid deposits. The anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries that emanate from the circle of Willis may show varying degrees of stenosis or occlusion. Associated with fibrocellular thickening of the intima. waving of the internal elastic lamina, and thinning of the media. Clinical Features: Ranging from being asymptomatic to manifesting as transient events to causing severe neurologic deficits. Adults experience hemorrhage more commonly Cerebral ischemic events are more common in children. Diagnosis Cerebral angiography is the criterion standard for the diagnosis of moyamoya disease.

        "exp": "Ref: Grays Anatomy, 40th ed. Explanation: Indusium griseum is a thin strip of grey matter found on the dorsal surface of the corpus callosum. The insula is a cortical region hidden within the depths of the lateral fissure by overhanging parts (opercula) of the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes. A complex of gyri on the medial aspect of the hemisphere makes up the limbic lobe. The area of the adult cerebral cortex is approximately 2200 cm2. Its convoluted form increases the cortical volume to three times greater than it would be if the surface were smooth. Two prominent furrows, the lateral (Sylvian) fissure, and the central sulcus are the main features on the superolateral cerebral surface, and they determine its surface divisions. The central sulcus is the boundary between the frontal and parietal lobes and demarcates the primary motor and somatosensory areas of the cortex, located in the precentral and postcentral gyri. respectively. The medial cerebral surface lies within the great longitudinal fissure. The commissural fibers of the corpus callosum lie in the depths of the fissure: the curved anterior part of the corpus callosum, the genu, is continuous below with the rostrum and narrows rapidly as it passes back to the upper end of the lamina terminalis. The cortex immediately below the rostrum is the subcallosal area (para-olfactory gyrus). The genu of the corpus callosum continues above into the trunk or body, which arches up and back to a thick, rounded posterior extremity, the splenium. The bilateral vertical laminae of the septum pellucid urn are attached to the concave surfaces of the trunk, genu, and rostrum, occupying the interval between them and the fornix. The superior end of the central sulcus usually invades the paracentral lobule posteriorly and the precentral gyrus is continuous with the lobule. This area is concerned with movements of the contralateral lower limb and perineal region - clinical evidence suggests that it exercises voluntary control over defaecation and micturition. The calcarine sulcus is deep and produces an elevation, the calcar avis, in the wall of the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle. The area posterior to the upturned end of the cingulate sulcus, and anterior to the parietooccipital sulcus is the precuneus. The uncus is part of the piriform cortex of the olfactory system, phylogenetically one of the oldest parts of the cortex, and is separated from the temporal pole by the rhinal sulcus (fissure) which marks the lateral limit of the entorhinal cortex (area).",

The given history is also compatible with pulmonary tuberculosis, but serum ACE levels will be normal. Sarcoidosis It is a multisystem granulomatous disease and lesions may occur anywhere in the body. The clinical manifestations depend on the extent and degree of granulomatous inflammation and are extremely variable. Children may present with nonspecific symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and general malaise. In adults and older children, pulmonary involvement is most frequent, with infiltration of the thoracic lymph nodes and lung parenchyma. Isolated bilateral hilar adenopathy on chest radiograph is the most common finding, but parenchymal infiltrates and miliary nodules may also be seen Patients with lung involvement are commonly found to have restrictive changes on pulmonary function testing. Extrathoracic lymphadenopathy and infiltration of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow leading on to isolated hepatomegaly and splenomegaly Cutaneous disease, such as plaques, nodules, erythema nodosum in acute disease, or lupus pernio in chronic sarcoidosis Red-brown to purple maculopapular lesions <1 cm on the face, neck, upper back, and extremities are the most common skin finding Ocular involvement is frequent, anterior or posterior uveitis, conjunctival granulomas, eyelid inflammation, and orbital or lacrimal gland infiltration. The arthritis in sarcoidosis can be confused with JR A Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is rare in childhood hut may manifest as seizures, cranial nerve involvement, intracranial mass lesions, and hypothalamic dysfunction. Kidney disease also occurs infrequently in 'children but typically manifests as renal insufficiency, proteinuria, transient pyuria, or microscopic hematuria as a result of either early monocellular infiltration or granuloma formation in kidney tissue. Only a small fraction of children have hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria, which is, therefore, an infrequent cause of kidney disease. Sarcoid granulomas can also infiltrate the heart and lead to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. In contrast to the variable clinical presentation of sarcoidosis in older children, early-onset sarcoidosis classically manifests as the triad uveitis, arthritis, and rash. Pulmonary disease and lymphadenopathy are less common. The arthritis is polyarticular and symmetric, with large boggy effusions. The rash is diffuse, erythematous, papular Noncaseating granulomas are demonstrated with biopsy of the skin or joint synovium Laboratory Findings There is no single laboratory test diagnostic of sarcoidosis. Anemia, leukopenia, and eosinophilia may be seen. Hypergammaglobulinemia and elevations in acute-phase reactants (ESR & CRP) Hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria Angiotensin-converting enzyme LACE) is produced by the epithelioid cells of the granuloma, and its serum value may be elevated. but this finding lacks diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Fluorodeoxyglucose FI8 positron emission tomography (18. FDG PET) can help identify non-pulmonary sites for a diagnostic biopsy. A positive gallium scan can support the diagnosis if an increased activity is noted in the parotids and lacrimal glands (panda sign) or in the right paratracheal and left hilar area (lambda sign).",

One faulty copy of gene (i. e. mutant allele) in any autosomeand one copy of normal allele. Disease phenotype is seen in all such individuals. Patients having disease have 50% chance of passing on thedisease to the next generation. Both males and females are affected equally. Both males and females can transmit the condition to progeny There is atleast one instance of male to male transmission. Disease manifests in heterozygous state, so at least oneparent of an index case is usually affected. When an affected person marries an unaffected one, every child has one chance in two of having the disease. Clinical features can be modified by variations in penetranceand expressivity. Some individuals inherit the mutant gene but are phenotypicallynormal. This is referred to as incomplete penetrance Penetrance is expressed in mathematical terms. Thus, 50%penetrance indicates that 50% of those who carry the geneexpress the trait. In practice, penetrance risk is less than 10%. If a trait is seen in all individuals carrying the mutant gene but isexpressed differently among individuals, the phenomenon iscalled variable expressivity. For example, manifestations ofneurofibromatosis type 1 range from brownish spots on the skinto multiple skin tumors and skeletal deformities. In many conditions the age at onset is delayed. Symptoms and signs may not appear until adulthood (as in. Huntington disease). Many autosomal dominant diseases (e. g. achondroplasia) havebeen shown to be associated with increasing paternal age, Paternal age is an important determinant in new germ cellmutation, causing both autosomal dominant and X-linkedrecessive illnesses.

        "exp": "Ans: C (Resolve...) CAULIFLOWER EAR (complication of hematoma aum, perichondrial hematoma, or traumatic auricular hematoma)# It is a condition that occurs when the external portion of the ear suffers a blow, blood clot or other collection of fluid under the perichondrium. This separates the cartilage from the overlying perichondrium that supplies its nutrients. causing it to die and resulting in the formation of fibrous tissue in the overlying skin. As a result, the outer ear becomes permanently swollen and deformed, resembling a cauliflower.# The condition is most common among wrestlers, mixed martial artists and forwards in rughv union. It can occur when an ear cartilage piercing becomes infected. Headgear (called a \"scrum cap\" in Rugby, or simply \"headgear\" in wrestling and other martial arts) that protects the ears is worn in wrestling and rugby, many martial arts and other contact sports to help prevent this condition. For some athletes, however, a cauliflower ear is considered a badge of courage or experience. Treatment is aspiration of the heamatoma under strict aseptic condition & a pressure dressing, carefully packing alt concavities of the auricle. Aspiratin may need to be repeated. When aspiration fails, incision & drainage should be done. All cases should receive prophylactic antibiotics. The outer ear is prone to infections, so antibiotics are usually prescribed. If the pressure is left alone without medical intervention, the ear can suffer serious damage. Pressure can build up and eventually rupture the ear drum. Cosmetic procedures are available which can possibly improve the appearance of the ear.",

Anencephaly is the most severe form of cranial neural tube defect (NTD) and is characterised by an absence of cortical tissue (although the brainstem and cerebellum may be variably present) as well as an absence of the cranial vault. The morphological spectrum within anencephaly ranges from holocrania (most severe form) to merocrania (mildest form) 2. Epidemiology Incidence is around 1: 1000. There is a recognised female predilection with a F: M ratio of ~4: 1. Clinical presentation In affluent nations, the diagnosis is usually made antenatally. At birth the diagnosis is made due to obvious malformation of the cranial vault. Pathology It results from a failure of closure of the antral end of the neural tube which is expected to occur at approximately day 24 of embryonal life. Associations As with many other malformations, a number of associated abnormalities are recognised: other neural tube defects: spina bifida (especially cervical) congenital heart defects cleft lip/palate diaphragmatic hernia(s) spinal dysraphism skeletal anomalies: e. g. clubfeet gastrointestinal abnormalities: e. g. omphalocele urinary tract abnormalities: hydronephrosis most common Markers maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) levels are highly elevated (x2. 5 MoM (multiples of the median)): of all the neural tube defects, anencephaly usually gives the highest elevation in MSAFP 7 Radiographic features Antenatal ultrasound Anencephaly may be sonographically detectable as early as 11 weeks. Ultrasound can be a non-invasive, cost effective and fast method to detect anencephaly and has an accuracy of approximately 100% at 14 weeks. Sonographic features of anencephaly include: no parenchymal tissue is seen above the orbits and calvarium is absent: parts of the occipital bone and mid brain may be present if a small amount of neural tissue is present, it is then termed exencephaly this may be seen at an earlier stage less than expected value for crown rump length (CRL) a \"frog eye\" or \"mickey mouse\" appearance may be seen when seen in the coronal plane due to absent cranial bone/brain and bulging orbits. may show evidence of polyhydramnios: due to impaired swallowing Treatment and prognosis Not surprisingly anencephaly is incompatible with life. Folic acid therapy may reduce the risk of recurrence. There is a slight risk (~2. 5%) in recurrence of a neural tube defect in future pregnancies. Differential diagnosis amniotic band syndrome: if the band passes through the head severe microcephaly Anencephaly should not be confused with hydranencephaly in which the cranial vault is present and absence of cerebral tissue is due to antenatal vascular insult.",

It is very often asymptomatic but can have serious consequences of pelvic pain and fertility problems if untreated. It is more common in women who have a cervical ectropion. The presence of mucopurulent discharge should alert the clinician to the possibility of chlamydia. Diagnosis is confirmed by taking an endocervical swab. Treatment is with antibiotics, either azithromycin 1g immediately or doxycycline 100mg twice daily for seven days. Any sexual contacts need to be traced and treated. Possible different diagnoses Gonorrhoea. Cervical ectropion. Trichomonas. Differential diagnosis Gonorrhoea Occasionally presents with skin lesions. May cause pelvic inflammatory disease. Treatment is with antibiotics. Ref-2. teachmeobgyn. com/sexual-health/sexually-transmitted-infections/chlamydia/ Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. It is the most common bacterial STI reported in the UK - Public Health England reported 200, 288 cases in 2015 (46% of all STI diagnoses). In this article we shall cover the pathophysiology and clinical features of a chlamydial infection, common investigations and its management. Pathophysiology C. trachomatis is an obligate intracellular gram negative bacterium of which there are different serotypes: Serotypes A-C - cause ocular infection. Serotypes D-K - responsible for classical genitourinary infection. Serotypes L1-L3 - cause lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), an emerging infection in men who have sex with men, often resulting in proctitis. Transmission is via unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex. However, penetration is not always necessary - and the infection can be spread via direct skin-to-skin contact of the genitals. If infected semen/vaginal fluid enters the eye it can cause chlamydial conjunctivitis, and it is also possible for an infected mother to pass on the infection to her baby during delivery. C. trachomatis enters the host cell as an elementary body (infectious form). Once inside the cell it becomes a reticular body, the non-infectious form capable of replication. Following replication, these reticular bodies mature back to elementary bodies, and following cell rupture the elementary bodies infect other cells resulting in inflammation and tissue damage. By Teach. Me. Series Ltd (2018) Fig 1 - The replication cycle of chlamydia Risk Factors The following are risk factors associated with Chlamydia, most of which are common to other sexually transmitted infections: Age <25 Sexual partner positive for chlamydia Recent change in sexual partner Co-infection with another STI Non-barrier contraception or lack of consistent use of barrier contraception Clinical Features Chlamydia is often asymptomatic, with 50% of men and 70% of women unaware that they are infected. The incubation period is typically between 7 and 21 days, after which people may become symptomatic. In addition to the genitourinary features below, chlamydia can also infect the conjunctiva of the eye leading to irritation (chlamydial conjunctivitis), the rectum (discomfort and discharge) and the pharynx (often no symptoms). Women CC BY-SA 3. 0, Fig 2 - Cervicitis and mucopurulent endocervical discharge in female chlamydial infection. Symptoms Dysuria Abnormal vaginal discharge Intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding Deep dyspareunia Lower abdominal pain Signs Cervicitis +/- contact bleeding Mucopurulent endocervical discharge Pelvic tenderness Cervical excitation Men Symptoms Urethritis Dysuria Urethral discharge Epididymo-orchitis Testicular pain Signs Epididymal tenderness Mucopurulent discharge Differential Diagnoses A full STI screen should be undertaken for a patient presenting with chlamydia due to the common presenting symptoms of various STIs. In particular, it is difficult to clinically differentiate between gonorrhoea and chlamydia so many NAATs now offer dual testing for both diseases. Treatment for gonorrhoea covers both N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Investigations Chlamydia tests are available from sexual health clinics, GUM clinics and GP surgeries. There is also a National Chlamydia Screening Programme in England for people aged under 25 and this testing is often available from pharmacies, universities and contraception clinics. Chlamydia is too small to be seen via microscopy so a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is the recommended investigation to diagnose genital chlamydia from specimens taken at examination or by the patient: Women: Vulvo-vaginal swab (first choice), endocervical swab or first catch urine sample. Men: first catch urine sample (first choice) or urethral swab. If indicated, swabs may also need to be taken from the rectum, eye(s) and throat. If positive for chlamydia, contact tracing is necessary so that the patient's current sexual partner(s) and recent partners can be tested and treated. Patients are recommended to have a full STI screen due to the possibility of co-infection and the similar nature of signs and symptoms. Management Antibiotic treatment is recommended for uncomplicated urogenital chlamydial infection: Doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 7 days or Azithromycin 1g single dose Alternative treatment when doxycycline and azithromycin are contraindicated: Erythromycin 500mg twice daily for 10- 14days Ofloxacin 200mg bd or 400mg od for seven days Patients are advised to avoid sexual intercourse and oral sex until they and/or their partner have completed treatment (or 7 days following azithromycin). Test of cure is not usually required unless the patient is pregnant, compliance was poor or when symptoms persist. If aged <25, repeat testing is recommended 3 months after treatment. Complications In women, ascending infection can lead to salpingitis and/or endometritis which can result in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can lead to perihepatitis, ectopic pregnancy and may ultimately result in infertility. In men, the infection can spread to cause epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis causing the testes to become painful and swollen. If left untreated, it is thought that this can affect fertility. Chlamydia can also result in sexually acquired reactive arthritis where the joints/eyes/urethra become inflamed and this is more common in men. Chlamydia in Pregnancy Chlamydia may increase the risk of premature delivery with low birth weight and it is thought the infection might increase the chance of miscarriage or stillbirth. Chlamydia in pregnancy is treated with antibiotics, however doxycycline and ofloxacin are contraindicated so azithromycin and erythromycin are the drugs of choice. If a baby contracts chlamydia they may present with inflammation and discharge in their eyes, indicative of neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis (5-12 days after birth) and it is also possible for them to develop pneumonia (1-3 months after birth). If suspected, swabs can be taken from the eyelid or nasopharynx as indicated. Neonates are treated with oral erythromycin. Full details for the management for Chlamydia during pregnancy and for the neonate can be found in the UK national guidelines.",

        "exp": "(Low pressure O2): Ref 45-Dutta 6th (394-Ghai 7th) Changes of the fetal circulation at birth 1. Closure of the umbilical arteries: Functional closure is almost instaneous preventing even slight amount of the fetal blood to drain out. Actual obliteration takes about 2-3 months. The distal parts from the lateral umbilical ligaments and the proximal parts remain open as superior vesical arteries. 2. Closure of umbilical vein: - The obliteration occurs a little latter than the arteries, After obliteration, the umbilical vein forms the ligamentum teres and the ductus venosus becomes ligamentum venosum 3. Closure of the ductus arteriosus - Within few hours of respiration, the muscle wall of the ductus arteriosus contracts probably in response to rising oxygen tension of the blood flowing through the duct. The effects of the variation of the O2 tension on the ductus arteriosus are thought to be mediated through the action of prostaglandins. Prostaglandin antagonists given to the mother may lead to the premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Whereas functional closure of the ductus may occur soon after the establishment of pulmonary circulation, the anatomical obliteration takes about 1-3 months and becomes ligamentum arteriosum 4. Closure of the foramen ovale: - This is caused by an increased pressure of the left atrium combined with a decreased pressure on the right atrium. Functional closure occurs soon after birth but anatomical closure occurs in about 1 year time. Within one or two hours following birth, the cardiac output is estimated to be a bout 500 ml per minute, and the heart rate varies from 120 -140 per minute * During foetal life, patency of the ductus arteriosus appears to be maintained by the combined relaxant effects of low oxygen tension and endogenously produced prostaglandins (PGE2), In full term neonates the oxygen is the most important factor controlling ductual closure (1480- Nelson 17th) Ref 2 - PATHOPHYSIOLOGY The DA is derived from the distal dorsal sixth aortic arch and is completely formed by the eighth week of gestation. 6 Its role is to shunt the blood from the nonfunctional fetal lung through its connection between the main pulmonary artery and the proximal descending aorta. This right-to-left shunt allows the blood with a relatively low oxygen concentration to be carried from the right ventricle through the descending aorta and eventually to the placenta, where gas exchange will occur. Before birth, approximately 90% of right ventricular output flows through the DA. Figure 1 illustrates the role of the DA in redirecting fetal circulation in comparison to neonatal circulation. 15 Premature closure in the fetus is associated with significant morbidities, including right-sided heart failure, which may result in fetal hydrops. 6 Normally, the DA closes within 24-72 hours after a full-term birth; if after 72 hours the ductus fails to close, a diagnosis of persistent PDA may be made. 1, 16 Figure 1. Left-The ductus arteriosus is an essential component of fetal circulation. It functions by shunting blood away from the nonfunctional fetal lung and into the systemic circulation through the aorta. Right-After birth, decreases in PGE2 and oxygen tension contribute to the closure of the ductus Arteriosus, allowing gas exchange to occur in the newly functioning lungs rather than the now absent placenta. Blue = oxygen-poor blood; Red = oxygen-rich blood; LA = left atrium; LV = left ventricle; RA = right atrium; RV = right ventricle. The paradoxical patent ductus arteriosus. J Clin Invest 166: 2863-2866 by Ivey KN, and Srivastava D. Copyright 2006 by J Clin Invest. Reproduced with permission of J Clin Invest via Copyright Clearance Center. The patency of the DA is primarily controlled by low fetal oxygen tension and the circulation of prostanoids produced from the metabolism of arachidonic acid by COX, with PGE2 producing the most profound ductal relaxation among the prostanoids. 16, 17 Smooth muscle relaxation of the DA results from the activation of the G-coupled prostaglandin receptor EP4 by PGE2. Following the activation of prostaglandin receptor EP4, a cascade of events ensues, which includes the accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, increased protein kinase A, and finally, decreased myosin light chain kinase, leading to vasodilation and ultimately DA patency. 15 The preterm ductus is especially sensitive to the vasodilatory effects of prostaglandins, contributing to the failure of ductal closure. 18 In term infants, as birth approaches, decreased sensitivity of the DA to prostaglandins and decreased circulating levels of PGE2 contribute to DA closure. 19 Within 24-72 hours after a full-term birth, the DA closes as a result of increased oxygen tension and decreased circulating PGE2 and prostacyclins (PGI2). As oxygen tension increases, smooth muscle voltage-dependent potassium channels are inhibited. Through this inhibition, an influx of calcium contributes to ductal constriction. This oxygen-induced constriction fails in preterm infants potentially due to immaturity of oxygen-sensing receptors. 20 Levels of circulating PGE2 and PGI2 are decreased as a result of increased metabolism in the newly functioning lung, as well as the removal of the placental source. The decreased circulating levels of these potent vasodilators allow the DA to constrict. These factors collectively contribute to smooth muscle constriction, leading to ischemic hypoxia of the inner muscle wall of the DA. As the ductus constricts, the luminal area is diminished, resulting in a thickened vessel wall and obstructed flow through the vasa vasorum, the essential capillary network nourishing the outer cells of the vessel. This causes an increased distance of diffusion for oxygen and nutrients, including glucose, glycogen, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which results in nutritional deficit and oxygen starvation, leading to cell death. 21 Ductal constriction in preterm infants is not sufficiently profound. Consequently, preterm infants are resistant to smooth muscle hypoxia, which is paramount in triggering the cell death and remodeling required for permanent closure of the DA. 22 Inhibition of prostaglandin and nitric oxide resulting from tissue hypoxia is not as extensive in the preterm neonate in comparison to the term infant, further contributing to resistance to DA closure in the preterm infant. 23 The main provider of nutrients to the DA is the lumen; however, the vasa vasorum is also a substantial provider to the outer wall of the ductus. The vasa vasorum grows toward the lumen and extends 400-500 mm from the outer wall of the ductus. The distance between the lumen and the vasa vasorum (40-500 mm) is referred to as the avascular zone and represents the maximum distance allowable for effective nutrient diffusion. In full-term infants, this avascular zone is expanded beyond the effective diffusion distance, therefore contributing to cell death. In preterm infants, the avascular zone does not sufficiently expand, resulting in cell survival and maintenance of ductal patency. 24 If the levels of circulating PGE2 and other prostaglandins are decreased through COX inhibition, closure is facilitated. The abovementioned differences between ductal vessel wall thickness of the fetus, term neonate, and preterm neonate are illustrated in Figure 2. 16 In response to the nutritional deficit and ischemic hypoxia, vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor beta (both of which contribute to endothelial proliferation), in combination with other inflammatory mediators, contribute to the remodeling of the DA into the non-contractile ligament commonly referred to as the ligamentum arteriosum. 16, 24 Figure 2. Comparison of fetal and both the premature and full-term newborn ductus arteriosus.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Polypoidal mass Rhinosporidiosiso Rhinosporidiosis is a chronic granulomatous infection of the mucous membrane that usually manifests as vascular friable polyps that arise from the nasal mucosa. The etiological agent is Rhinosporidium seeberi. Rhinosporidium seeberi is an aquatic protozoan (not a fungus). Infection usually results from a local traumatic inoculation with the organism. It is seen in India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. In India, most of the cases are seen in Southern states. Infection of the nose and nasopharynx is observed in 70% of persons with rhinosporidiosis; infection of the palpebral conjunctiva or associated structures (including lacrimal apparatus) is observed in 15% of cases. Other structures of the mouth and upper airway may be sites of disease. Disease of the skin, ear, genitals, and rectum has also been described. Rhinosporidiosis is an infection that typically limited to the mucosal epithelium. The disease progress with local replication of R seeberi and associated hyperplastic growth of host tissue and a localized immune response. Clinical features of Rhinosporidiosiso Rhinosporidiosis presents as soft leafy polypoidal mass (soft polyp), which is pink to purple in colour studded with White dots, i. e. strawberry appearance. This appearance results from sporangia, which is visible as grey or yellow spots in the vascular polypoid masses. Because the polyps are vascular and friable, they bleed easily upon manipulation. Treatmento The treatment of choice is surgical excision. Complete excision of mass is done with diathermy knife and cauterization of the base. Dapsone is being tried for treating rhinosporidiosis but with limited success.",

        "question": "A lipid-lowering drug that significantly increases lipoprotein-a levels?",
        "exp": "Ans. C (Rosuvastatin) (Ref. Evidence that elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp) levels contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is substantial. Development of isoform-independent assays, in concert with genetic, epidemiological, translational, and pathophysiological insights, have established Lp(a) as an independent, genetic, and likely causal risk factor for CVD and CAVS. These observations are consistent across a broad spectrum of patients, risk factors, and concomitant therapies, including patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <70 mg/dl. Statins tend to increase Lp(a) levels, possibly contributing to the \"residual risk\" noted in outcomes trials and at the bedside. Recently approved proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-type 9 inhibitors and mipomersen lower Lp(a) 20% to 30%, and emerging RNA-targeted therapies lower Lp(a) >80%. These approaches will allow testing of the \"Lp(a) hypothesis\" in clinical trials. This review summarizes the current landscape of Lp(a), discusses controversies, and reviews emerging therapies to reduce plasma Lp(a) levels to decrease risk of CVD and CAVS. Niacin (but not niacinamide) decreases VLDL and LDL levels--and Lp(a). It often increases HDL levels significantly. It is particularly useful in patients with combined hyperlipidemia and low plasma levels of HDL-C and is effective in combination with statins. NIACIN (NICOTINIC ACID) Mechanism of Action # Niacin inhibits VLDL secretion, in turn decreasing production of LDL. # Increased clearance of VLDL via the LPL pathway contributes to triglyceride reduction. # The catabolic rate for HDL is decreased. # Fibrinogen levels are reduced, and levels of tissue plasminogen activator appear to increase. # Niacin inhibits the intracellular lipase of adipose tissue via receptor-mediated signaling, possibly reducing VLDL production by decreasing the flux of free fatty acids to liver. # Nicotinic acid decreases both LDL-C and VLDL-C, while raising plasma HDL1-C, and is frequently effective for Familial hypercholestremia when used in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. # Niacin is the only currently available lipid-lowering drug that significantly reduces plasma levels of Lp(a). deg # It is the most effective drug currently available for raising HDL-C levels. # NOTE: Lipoprotein-a is marker of HDL while Lipoprotein-B 100 is marker of LDL. Therapeutic Uses & Dosage # In combination with a resin or reductase inhibitor, niacin normalizes LDL in most patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and other forms of hypercholesterolemia. These combinations are also indicated in nephrosis. # It is clearly the most effective agent for increasing levels of HDL. Toxicity # Cutaneous vasodilation and sensation ot warmth after each dose. # Pruritus, rashes, dry skin or mucous membranes, and acanthosis nigricans. # Rarely, true hepatotoxicity. # Rarely, arrhythmias, mostly atrial # Reversible toxic amblyopia. # Tachyphylaxis. # Peptic disease. # Dysglycemia # Hyperuricemia.
