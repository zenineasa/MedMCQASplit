Spironolactone is not favoured because of its hormonal side effects (gynaecomastia, impotence, menstrual irregularities). Cimetidine (but not other H2 blockers) has antiandrogenic action (displaces dihydrotestosterone from its cytoplasmic receptor), increases plasma prolactin and inhibits degradation of estradiol by liver. High doses given for long periods have produced gynaecomastia, loss of libido, impotence and temporary decrease in sperm count. The most important drawback of ketoconazole is its hormonal effects. It decreases androgen production from testes, and displaces testosterone from protein binding sites. Gynaecomastia, loss of hair and libido, and oligozoospermia may occur when the drug is used for a few weeks. Menstrual irregularities occur in some women due to suppression of estradiol synthesis.",

These symptoms - worry, tiredness, and sleepless nights affect more than half of the adults at some time, while as many as one people in seven experiences some form of the diagnosable neurotic disorder. Burden of Disease The World Bank report (1993) revealed that the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) loss due to neuro-psychiatric disorder is much higher than diarrhea, malaria, worm infestations and tuberculosis if taken individually. According to the estimates, DALYs loss due to mental disorders is expected to represent 15% of the global burden of diseases by 2020. During the last two decades, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in India, which shows that the prevalence of the major psychiatric disorder is about the same all over the world. The prevalence reported from these studies range from the population of 18 to 207 per 1000 with the median 65. 4 per 1000 and at any given time, about 2 -3 % of the population, suffer from seriously, incapacitating mental disorders or epilepsy. Most of these patients live in rural areas remote from any modern mental health facilities. A large number of adult patients (10. 4 - 53%) coming to the general OPD are diagnosed mentally ill. However, these patients are usually missed because either medical officer or general practitioner at the primary health care unit does not ask detailed mental health history. Due to the under-diagnosis of these patients, unnecessary investigations and treatments are offered which heavily cost to the health providers. Programme The Government of India has launched the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in 1982, keeping in view the heavy burden of mental illness in the community, and the absolute inadequacy of mental health care infrastructure in the country to deal with it. Aims 1. Prevention and treatment of mental and neurological disorders and their associated disabilities. 2. Use of mental health technology to improve general health services. 3. Application of mental health principles in total national development to improve quality of life. Objectives 1. To ensure availability and accessibility of minimum mental health care for all in the foreseeable future, particularly to the most vulnerable and underprivileged sections of the population. 2. To encourage the application of mental health knowledge in general health care and in social development. 3. To promote community participation in the mental health services development and to stimulate efforts towards self-help in the community. Strategies 1. Integration mental health with primary health care through the NMHP; 2. Provision of tertiary care institutions for treatment of mental disorders; 3. Eradicating stigmatization of mentally ill patients and protecting their rights through regulatory institutions like the Central Mental Health Authority, and State Mental health Authority. Mental Healthcare 1. The mental morbidity requires priority in mental health treatment2. Primary health care at the village and subcentre level3. At Primary Health Centre level4. At the District Hospital level5. Mental Hospital and teaching Psychiatric Units District Mental Health Programme Components 1. Training programmes of all workers in the mental health team at the identified Nodal Institute in the State. 2. Public education in the mental health to increase awareness and reduce stigma. 3. For early detection and treatment, the OPD and indoor services are provided. 4. Providing valuable data and experience at the level of community to the state and Centre for future planning, improvement in service and research. Agencies like the World Bank and WHO have been contacted to support various components of the programme. Funds are provided by the Govt. of India to the state governments and the nodal institutes to meet the expenditure on staff, equipment, vehicles, medicine, stationary, contingencies, training, etc. for initial 5 years and thereafter they should manage themselves. Govt. of India has constituted central Mental Health Authority to oversee the implementation of the Mental Health Act 1986. It provides for the creation of the state Mental Health Authority also to carry out the said functions. The National Human Rights Commission also monitors the conditions in the mental hospitals along with the government of India and the states are currently acting on the recommendation of the joint studies conducted to ensure quality in the delivery of mental care. Thrust areas for 10th Five Year Plan 1. District mental health programme in an enlarged and more effective form covering the entire country. 2. Streamlining/ modernization of mental hospitals in order to modify their present custodial role. 3. Upgrading the department of psychiatry in medical colleges and enhancing the psychiatry content of the medical curriculum at the undergraduate as well as postgraduate level. 4. Strengthening the Central and State Mental Health Authorities with a permanent secretariat. Appointment of medical officers at state headquarters in order to make their monitoring role more effective; 5. Research and training in the field of community mental health, substance abuse and child/ adolescent psychiatric clinics.",

African (endemic) Burkitt lymphoma, Sporadic (nonendemic) Burkitt lymphoma. Aggressive lymphomas associated with HIV. These 3 types are histologically identical. Morphology. The tumor exhibits a high mitotic index and contains numerous apoptotic cells, the nuclear remnants of which are phagocytosed by interspersed benign macrophages. These phagocytes have abundant clear cytoplasm, creating a characteristic \"starry sky\" pattern. Immunophenotype. These are tumors of mature B cells. It expresses surface IgM, 0)19. CD20, 0)10, and BCL6. a phenotype consistent with a germinal center B-cell origin. Unlike other tumors of germinal center origin, this does not express anti-apoptotic protein BCL2. Molecular Pathogenesis. All forms of Burkitt lymphoma are associated with translocations of the c-MYC gene on chromosome 8. The translocation partner is usually the IgH locus or g light-chain loci. All endemic tumors are latently infected with EBV. which is also present in about 25% of HIV- associated tumors and 15% to 20% of sporadic cases. Clinical Features. Endemic Burkitt lymphoma often presents as a mass involving the mandible and shows an unusual predilection for involvement of abdominal viscera, particularly the kidneys, ovaries, and adrenal glands. Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma most often appears as a mass involving the ileocecum and peritoneum. Burkitt lymphoma is very aggressive but responds well to intensive chemotherapy.",

The fetal pole is the first visible sign of a developing embryo. The fetal pole now allows for crown to rump measurements (CRL) to be taken, so that pregnancy dating can be a bit more accurate. The fetal pole may be seen at a crown-rump length (CRL) of 2-4 mm, and the heartbeat may be seen as a regular flutter when the CRL has reached 5 mm. If a vaginal ultrasound is done and no fetal pole or cardiac activity is seen, another ultrasound scan should be done in 3-7 days. Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin h.

        "question": "Which of the following is NOT a concept of DCS operative principles?",
        "exp": "Ans- D Definitive repair of injury Damage Control Surgery Craig Olson MD, Alexander L. Eastman MD, in Parkland Trauma Handbook (Third Edition), 2009 IV. Stages of Damage Control Damage control surgery (DCS) is divided into four distinctive stages: the decision to perform DCS, the operation, intensive care unit resuscitation, and second-look/definitive operation. A. Decision to perform DCS 1. Preoperative decision to perform a DCS procedure is frequently made in patients with multisystem trauma. 2. Absolute indications for DCS: a. Base deficit >8 m. Eq/L or worsening base deficit b. pH < 7. 2 c. Hypotension < 90 mm Hg systolic d. Hypothermia < 34deg C e. PTT > 60 seconds f. Operative \"clinical\" coagulopathy 3. Early recognition of significant physiologic derangement and the need for DCS are critical as inability to correct pH >7. 21 and PTT >70 is associated with near certain mortality. 4. Initial resuscitation should begin in the emergency department and continue in the operating room following correction of deficit and using a massive transfusion program as indicated. B. DCS operative principles 1. The goal of DCS is a short operating time, followed by transport to an intensive care unit. 2. Control of hemorrhage a. Ligation of named vascular structures may be necessary and/or temporary vascular clamps may be used. b. Vascular shunting may be employed in extremities using surgical shunts, such as a Javid shunt or large-bore IV tubing. c. Abdominal packing: packs are inserted into the right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, and pelvis. The bowel should be separated from laparotomy pads. 3. Control of contamination a. Bowel injuries may be quickly closed or resected with stapled ends left in discontinuity. b. Delay definitive repair of injury including time-consuming anastomoses and ostomies. 4. Prevent hypothermia. a. Warm operating room. b. All resuscitation fluids and blood products must be warmed to 38. 0o C or higher. c. Continuous use of convective warming devices (e. g., Bair huggers) 5. Temporary abdominal closure (TAC) a. Allows \"easy access\" for planned next operative intervention b. At Parkland Memorial Hospital, the \"Vac-Pack\" dressing is employed by packing the abdomen with laparotomy pads separated from the bowel with a fluid-impervious layer (e. g., a \"bogota bag or bowel bag). TAC dressing-specific drains are then placed in the packing, and a seal is created over the wound with the use of Ioban dressing. These drains are then connected to wall suction. (Note: Commercially available dressings have been made that accomplish the same goal with less \"improvisation\" but they are not as cost-effective.) c. Additional abdominal drains may be used as well. d. Because of its ease of application, the Vac-Pack dressing allows bedside changes in the intensive care unit. 6. Angiography/embolization a. If pelvic bleeding is suspected, the patient may be transferred to the angiography suite at this time. Significant hepatic parenchymal hemorrhage may also be controlled with angiography. C. Restoration of homeostasis in the intensive care unit 1. Rewarming a. Warm room temperature and other convective measures of warming, such as warming blankets and lamps, are used to maintain body temperature >35o C. b. Use of fluid warmer for administration of resuscitative crystalloids and blood products is mandatory. c. Continuous arteriovenous rewarming (CAVR) is occasionally performed when body temperature is less than 35o C. 2. Careful fluid resuscitation a. Resuscitation may be guided by early use of a pulmonary artery catheter. b. If massive bleeding resumes, the patient is returned emergently to the operating room for cessation of likely surgical bleeding. c. Avoid over-resuscitation. d. Monitor bladder pressure. Bladder pressures >20 mm Hg should raise concern for intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and >30 mm Hg for abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). 3. Ventilatory support a. If possible, maintain tidal volumes at 6 mL/kg ideal body weight. b. If unable to oxygenate with conventinal ventilation, at Parkland Memorial Hospital we use the Volume Diffuse Respirator (VDR) as a salvage therapy. 4. Negative fluid balance a. When physiologic balance is restored, natural mobilization of third space fluids may be aided with a continuous furosemide drip, titrated to a net negative balance per hour. b. This facilitates abdominal wall closure. C. Definitive operative intervention 1. Ideally performed at 24 to 36 hours, later if indications of physiologic derangement persist 2. Removal of packs, with replacement if necessary 3. Secondary survey of the abdomen: missed injuries at the time of damage control surgery are not uncommon. 4. Restoration of gastrointestinal and vascular continuity if necessary 5. Performance of other definitive procedures, such as ostomy placement 6. Abdominal closure if possible. If bowel edema prevents this, several techniques (e. g., Wittman patch) can be employed to help reapproximate fascial edges in stages. 7. Multiple \"second-looks\" may be needed.",

Explanation: SJOGREN SYNDROMEIt is a immune-mediated destruction of the lacrimal and salivary glands characterized by dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and dry mouth (xerostomia), resulting from immune-mediated destruction of the lacrimal and salivary glands. It occurs as an isolated disorder (primary form), also known as the sicca syndrome, or more often in association with another autoimmune disease (secondary form). Associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis (Most common SLE. polymyositis, systemic sclerosis, vasculitis, or thyroiditis. The ductal epithelial cells of the exocrine glands are the primary target for auto- antibodies. There is also systemic B-cell hyperactivity, as evidenced by the presence of ANAs and RF (even in the absence of associated RA). Most patients with primary Sjogren syndrome have autoantibodies to the RNP antigens SS- A (Ro) and SS-B (La) (These are also present in SLE). Other secretory glands, including those in the nasopharynx, upper airway, and vagina, may also be involved. Involved tissue\", show an intense lymphocyte (primarily activated CD4+ T cells) and plasmacell infiltrate. There is associated destruction of the native architecture. Lacrimal gland destruction results in a lack of tears, leading to drying of the corneal epithelium, with subsequent inflammation, erosion, and ulceration (keratoconjunctivitis sicca). Similar changes may occur in the oral mucosa as a result of loss of salivary gland output, giving rise to mucosal atrophy, with inflammatory Assuring and ulceration (xerostomia). Dryness and crusting of the nose may lead to ulcerations and even perforation of the nasal septum. When the respiratory passages are involved, secondary laryngitis, bronchitis, and pneumonitis may appear. Approximately 25% of the patients (especially those with anti-SS-A antibodies) develop extraglandular disease affecting the CNS. skin, kidneys and muscles. Renal lesions take the form of mild interstitial nephritis associated with tubular transport defects; unlike in SLE. glomerulonephritis is rare. Approximately 90% of Sjogren syndrome cases occur in women between the ages of 35 and 45 years. Extraglandular manifestations include synovitis, pulmonary fibrosis and peripheral neuropathy. Notably, there is a 40-fold increased risk of developing a non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, arising in the setting of the initial robust polyclonal B-cell proliferation.",

This is because they have a much higher density of voltage-gated sodium channels. o Functionally speaking, the neuron can be divided into four zones: - Dendrites and Soma (cell body) - Receptor zone Axon hillock of body & initial segment of axon - Generator area (Nerve impulse is generated). Axon (main length) - Transmitter zone (Transmits nerve impulse). The nerve terminals (Terminal knobs or buttons): - Release zone (release neurotransmitters).",

Mucous membranes are spared. Peripheral cyanosis is commonly caused by cold exposure with vasoconstriction in the digits. Similar physiology is found in Raynaud's phenomenon. Peripheral vascular disease and deep venous thrombosis result in slowed blood flow and increased oxygen extraction with subsequent cyanosis.

LAs first penetrate the axonal membrane to come inside and then their active species (cationic form) bind to Na\" channel from inside. Cationic form (active form) is able to approach its receptor only when the channel is open at the inner face - So resting nerve is resistant to block as Na+ channels are not activated and cationic form is not able to approach its receptor.

        "exp": "Ans. (c) Coarctation of aorta. Coarctation of aorta Ref- Image Source- Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) refers to a narrowing of the aortic lumen. Epidemiology Coarctations account for between 5-8% of all congenital heart defects. They are more frequent in males, M: F ratio of ~2-3: 1. Clinical presentation Varies accordingly to the degree of stenosis and the associated abnormalities. Patients may be asymptomatic in a setting of a non-severe stenosis. Children and adults can present with angina pectoris and leg claudication. On clinical examination, diminished femoral pulses and differential blood pressure between upper and lower extremities may be noted. Pathology It can be primarily divided into two types: infantile (pre-ductal) form: is characterised by diffuse hypoplasia or narrowing of the aorta from just distal to the brachiocephalic artery to the level of ductus arteriosus, typically with a more discrete area of constriction just proximal to the ductus but distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. Therefore, the blood supply to the descending aorta is via the patent ductus arteriosus. adult (juxta-ductal, post-ductal or middle aortic) form: is characterised by a short segment abrupt stenosis of the post-ductal aorta. It is due to thickening of the aortic media and typically occurs just distal to the ligamentum arteriosum (a remnant of the ductus arteriosus). Associations As with many congenital abnormalities, coarctation of the aorta is associated with other congenital anomalies. cardiac: bicuspid aortic valve: most common associated defect and seen in 75-80% ventricular septal defect (VSD) cyanotic congenital lesions including truncus arteriosus transposition of the great arteries (TGA), especially with a sub-pulmonic VSD and overriding pulmonary artery (Taussig-Bing) mitral valve defects including hypoplastic mitral valve parachute mitral valve abnormal papillary muscles patent ductus arteriosus non cardiac: intracranial berry aneurysms spinal scoliosis syndromic associations: cardiac Shone syndrome wider syndromic PHACE syndrome Turner syndrome: a coarctation can be seen in 15-20% of those with Turner syndrome Radiographic features Plain radiograph figure of 3 sign: contour abnormality of the aorta inferior rib notching: Roesler sign secondary to dilated intercostal collateral vessels which form as a way to bypass the coarctation and supply the descending aorta the dilated and tortuous vessels erode the inferior margins of the ribs, resulting in notching seen only in long standing cases, and therefore not seen in infancy (unusual in patients <5 years of age)7 seen in 70% of cases presenting in older children or adults if the coarctation is distal to either subclavian artery, then increased flow occurs through the subclavian artery, forming a collateral pathway via the internal thoracic artery, anterior intercostal artery, posterior intercostal artery and then into the descending thoracic aorta usually the 4th to 8th ribs are involved; occasionally involves the 3rd to 9th ribs as the 1st and 2nd posterior intercostal arteries arise from the costocervical trunk (a branch of the subclavian artery) and do not communicate with the aorta, these are not involved in collateral formation, and the 1st and 2nd ribs do not become notched if bilateral rib notching: the coarctation must be distal to the origin of both subclavian arteries, to enable bilateral collaterals to form if unilateral right rib notching then the coarctation lies distal to the brachiocephalic trunk, but proximal to the origin of the left subclavian artery or there may be a right sided aortic arch with abberent left subclavian artery distal to coarctation collaterals cannot form on the left, as the left subclavian is distal to the coarctation if unilateral left rib notching, then this suggests an associated aberrant right subclavian artery arising after the coarctation. The coarctation is distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, therefore collaterals form on the left. Collaterals cannot form on the right, as the aberrant right subclavian artery arises after the coarctation Antenatal ultrasound Useful in assessing for infantile coarctations. The suprasternal notch-long axis views are particularly considered helpful. The fetal right ventricle can be appear enlarged in severe coarctations although this alone is not a specific feature. Occasionally an aortic arch view may directly show a narrowing. Angiography: CTA/MRA/DSA All modalities are capable of delineating the coarctation as well as collateral vessels, most common collateral pathway being subclavian artery to internal mammary artery to intercostal arteries (resulting in inferior rib notching) to post-coarctation part of descending thoracic aorta. Treatment and prognosis The urgency of treatment depends on the presence of congestive cardiac failure. This is usually the case in severe coarctations found in infancy. In less severe cases, elective treatment when the child is older (typically ~2 years of age) is preferred 3. Treatment can be either primary surgical repair with excision of the coarctation and end-to-end anastomosis, or balloon angioplasty. Subclavian flap repair is a common surgical technique used, where the origin and proximal left subclavian artery is excised, opened up and sutured onto the aorta. If the subclavian is ligated, it is usually anastomosed onto the left common carotid artery. Complications neonatal heart failure subarachnoid haemorrhage from a ruptured berry aneurysm aortic dissection infective endocarditis: in the context of an added infective insult mycotic aneurysm: in the context of an added infective insult Differential diagnosis Imaging differential considerations include: pseudo-coarctation of the aorta: elongation, narrowing or kinking with no pressure gradient or collateral formation, no rib notching chronic large vessel arteritis, e. g. chronic phase of Takayasu arteritis",

It is nothing else but filtered HCO3- ions which react with H+ to form H2. CO3- This is the most important buffer in proximal tubules. Phosphate buffer: - Especially important in distal tubules. Ammonia buffers: - Bind to H+ and produce ammonium ion (H+ + NH3 = NH4). The reaction with NH3 occurs in the proximal and distal tubules but the main buffering mechanism is active in distal tubule and this is the most important buffer in distal tubule. o Thus, these buffers neutralize H+ in the tubules and in exchange HCO3- is reabsorbed. In case of bicarbonate buffer all filtered bicarbonates are reabsorbed. In case of ammonia and phosphate buffers, new HCO3 is generated due to secretion of H+ So, ammonia and phosphate buffers are excreted in exchange of HCO3- absorption.",

        "question": "Absorption of which of the following antimalarial drugs increases with food intake?",
        "exp": "Ans. a (Mefloquine) (Ref. KDT 6'h/787; Goodmann Gilllman Pharmacology, Chapter 39). Psychosis and seizures occur rarely, and mefloquine should not be prescribed to patients with neuropsychiatric conditions, including depression, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia, and seizure disorder. Antimalarial drugs 1. Suppressive (to avoid infection) 2. Therapeutic (eliminate erythrocytic) 3. Radical cure (elimination exoerythrocytic) 4. Gametocidal (destruction of gametocytes) Successful treatment is accomplished with chloroquine followed by primaquine. Chloroquine therapy is suppressive, therapeutic, and gametocidal, whereas primaquine eliminates the exoerythrocytic form. MEFLOQUINE # Like quinine and chloroquine, this quinoline is active only against the asexual erythrocytic stages of malarial parasites. # It has been the antimalarial prophylactic agent of choice for much of the tropics because it is usually effective against multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria and is reasonably well tolerated. # Mefloquine's mode of action is similar to that of chloroquine. # The presence of food significantly enhances the rate and extent of absorption. # About 98% of the drug binds to protein. # Mefloquine is excreted mainly in the bile and feces; no dose adjustment is needed in persons with renal insufficiency. # Adverse effects: - Mefloquine should be used with caution in individuals participating in activities requiring alertness and fine-motor coordination (e. g., driving, piloting aircraft, operating machinery, and deep-sea diving). - Sleep abnormalities (insomnia, abnormal dreams) have occasionally been reported. - Halofantrine must not be given simultaneously with or <3 weeks after mefloquine because a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval on electrocardiography may occur. - Caution should be exercised with regard to concomitant antiretroviral therapy, since mefloquine has been shown to exert variable effects on ritonavir pharmacokinetics. - Women of childbearing age are encouraged to practice contraception during malaria prophylaxis with mefloquine and for up to 3 months thereafter. ATOVAQUONE # Absorption after a single oral dose is slow, erratic, and variable; increased two- to threefold by fatty food; and dose- limited above 750 mg. CHLOROQUINE # It has marked, rapid schizontocidal and gametocidal activity against blood forms of P. ovale and Plasmodium malariae and against susceptible strains of P. vivax and P. falciparum. # It is not active against intrahepatic forms (P vivax and P ovale). # Hydroxychloroquine, a congener of chloroquine, is preferred to chloroquine for the treatment of autoimmune disorders because it produces less ocular toxicity when used in high doses. # Chloroquine can be administered intravenously, but excessively rapid parenteral administration can result in seizures and death from cardiovascular collapse. # About half of the drug is excreted in urine, but dose not reduced for persons with acute malaria and renal insufficiency. ARTEMISININ DERIVATIVES (THE NOVEL ANTI-MALARIALS) # Artesunate, artemether, arteether, and the parent compound artemisinin are sesquiterpene lactones derived from the wormwood plant Artemisia annua. (Chinese drugs). # These are rapidly effective against multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria and are at least as effective as and considerably safer than quinine or quinidine. # These agents are at least ten-fold more potent in vivo than other antimalarial drugs and presently show no cross- resistance with known antimalarials; thus they have become first-line treatments for severe falciparum malaria in areas where multidrug resistance is a major problem. # Artemether appears to be effective for the treatment of schistosomiasis and is being evaluated for community-based treatment programs. # When these agents are used alone, recrudescence may occur. LUMEFANTRINE # Has marked blood schizontocidal activity against a wide range of plasmodia with lower recrudescence rate. # The pharmacokinetic properties of lumefantrine are reminiscent of those of halofantrine, with variable oral bioavailability, considerable augmentation of oral bioavailability by concomitant fat intake, and a terminal elimination half-life of ~4 to 5 days in patients with malaria.

        "question": "A 30 yrs woman 2+0, hypertension have menorrhagia. Which is the best treatment for her -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., MIRENA * The question does not give any clue regarding the etiology of menorrhagia, so most probably the women are havingD. U. B. i. e., dysfunctional uterine bleeding. When a woman present with menorrhagia, consideration must first be given to diagnosis. This requires an appropriate history and clinical examination completed by the suitable investigation. Anemia should be detected by full blood count and iron studies. Ultrasonography, sonohysterography, and hysteroscopy are additional investigations that may diagnose a structural problem and should be utilized depending on their availability and the experience of the surgeon. Common causes of menorrhagia include local pathologies such as fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis or infection. Rarer, but important causes include genital malignancy (cervical, endometrial or myometrial) and systemic disorders such as thyroid disease and bleeding disorders. In over 50% cases no cause is found and the diagnosis of dysfunctional uterine bleeding is made. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding requires the following criteria: -Complaint of excessive menstrual blood loss (menorrhagia). Adequate exclusion of pathology that may otherwise cause menorrhagia. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding may be ovulatory or nonovulatory. Anovulatory cycles result in menorrhagia with regular cycles were as. Ovulatory cycles result in menorrhagia with irregular cycles. Most of the cases of dysfunctional uterine bleeding are secondary to anovulation. Without ovulation, the corpus luteum fails to form resulting in no progesterone secretion. In the absence of progesterone, there is no lateral phase or the secretory phase. The anovulatory woman is always in the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle and in the proliferative phase of the endometrial cycle. The only ovarian steroidal signal the endometrium receives is through estrogen. Continuous stimulation of endometrium by estrogen produces a proliferation of the endometrium to abnormal levels where it becomes fragile without the growth limiting and organizing effect of progesterone. The endometrium finally outgrows its blood supply and degenerates. The end result is an asynchronous breakdown of the endometrial lining at different levels. We can conclude that bleeding in anovulatory cycle occurs due to unopposed action of estrogen in the absence of progesterone. Anovulatory menstrual cycle gives rise to irregular bleeding. On the other hand, ovulatory cycles give rise to regular menstrual bleeding. These patients ovulate regularly. These patients have both the phases of menstrual cycle i. e., follicular phase and the secretory phase. Research has shown that several abnormalities can occur in the endometrium of women with DUB's ovulary cycles, for example, increased fibrinolytic activity and increased production of prostaglandins. These observations provide the rational basis for treatment in these women i. e., Antifibrinolytic Tranexamic acid. Prostaglandin inhibitor acid. Management of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. In D. U. B's there is no specific abnormality present, therefore, the choice of t/t must be considered in relation to several factors: -Factors influencing t/t. Presence of ovulatory or anovulatory cycles. Need for contraception. Patient preference. Contraindication to t/t. Heavy periods |Require contraception. Yes -Combined oral contraceptive or levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. No |Regular cycles. No-Combined oral contraceptives or cyclical progestins. Yes |Dysmenorrhea significant symptoms. Yes-Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. No | Tranexamic acid Medical treatment can be conveniently divided into hormonal and non hormonal: -As there is no hormonal defect the use of hormonal therapy does not correct an underlying disorder but merely imposes an external control of the cycle. The two main first-line t/t for menorrhagias associated with ovulatory cycles are nonhormonal as the ovulatory cycles usually have no defect in the menstrual cycle. They have normal menstruation and regular cycle the abnormality usually lies in increased fibrinolysis and increased production of prostaglandin. First line drugs in ovulatory cycles (menorrhagia with regular cycles). Antifibrinolytic Q (Tranexamic acid)NSAIDSTranexamic acid reduces menstrual loss by half and NSAID reduces it by one third. Both have the advantages of only being taken during menstruation, and aid to compliance and are particularly useful in those women who either do not require contraception or do not wish to use a hormonal therapy. They are also of value in treating excessive menstrual blood loss associated with the use of the nonhormonal intrauterine contraceptive device. Hormonal therapy Progesterone Traditionally hormonal therapy for menorrhagia has been progesterone given during luteal phase of the cycle. Normally progesterone therapy will control anovulatory bleeding once uterine pathology is excluded. In women who do not ovulate but are more frankly hypogonadal cyclic progesterone therapy restores the normal sequence of steroid hormone stimulation, estrogen followed by estrogen plus progesterone followed by withdrawal bleeding. Progestins are usually not effective. Despite this, they remain the first choice of many general practitioners and gynecologists. Progesterone's are effective when given for 21 days in each cycle but the side effects are such that patient may not choose to continue with the t/t. Although progestins have the contraceptive effect they are not the best choice when contraception required. Combined contraceptive pill. They are popular first-line drugs for women who desire contraception. OCP's suppress pituitary gonadotropin release preventing ovulation. Like cyclical progestins, they are useful for anovulatory bleeding as they impose a cycle. Levonorgestrel intrauterine system (MIRENA). It is a T shaped intrauterine device which releases levonorgestrel at the rate of 20 mcg daily. This low hormone minimizes the systemic progestin side effects and more patients will continue this therapy than cyclic progesterone's. It exerts its clinical effect by preventing endometrial proliferation and consequently reduces both the duration of bleeding and the amount of menstrual loss. The levonorgestrel-releasing system is also advocated as an alternative to surgery. Endometrial ablation Vs Levonorgestrel IVDFor women who wish to stop using chronic medical therapy or have contraindications to medications, minimally invasive options include the LNG-IUD or endometrial ablation. A systematic review of six randomized trials and a subsequent randomized trial found that women with menorrhagia who were treated with either the LNG-IUD or endometrial ablation had similar reductions in menstrual blood loss at 6, 12, and 24 months, as well as similar improvements in quality of life. A meta-analysis of four randomized trials found that rates of dissatisfaction were similar for women treated with the LNG-IUD (17 percent) compared with endometrial ablation (18 percent) (OR 0. 9, 95% Cl 0. 5-1. 8). The decision to use the LNG-IUD or endometrial ablation depends upon a patient's preferences regarding treatment at 6, 12, and 24 months, as well as similar improvements in quality of life. factors such as plans for fertility and contraception, convenience, and risks of anesthesia.- The LNG-IUD is a reversible contraceptive. - Pregnancy is contraindicated after endometrial ablation. but the procedure does not prevent pregnancy: thus. women will need to continue to use contraception following ablation. The LNG-IUD can be placed in an office setting for all women and requires no or local anesthesia. Endometrial ablation can also be done in an office by surgeons who are appropriately equipped but is often performed in an operating room under general anesthesia. If successful, endometrial ablation is performed once, while the LNG-IUD needs to be replaced every five.",

The chief sources of infection are shedding human lesions, fomites contaminated from such lesions, and the human respiratory tract and skin. Contact spread of infection has assumed added importance in hospitals, where a large proportion of the staff and patients carry antibiotic-resistant staphylococci in the nose or on the skin. Although cleanliness, hygiene, and aseptic management of lesions can control the spread of staphylococci from lesions, few methods are available to prevent the wide dissemination of staphylococci from carriers. Aerosols (eg, glycols) and ultraviolet irradiation of air have little effect. To diminish transmission within the hospital setting, high risk patients, such as those in intensive care units and patients transferred from chronic care facilities where prevalence is high, are frequently surveyed for anterior nares colonization. Patients who test positive by culture or PCR are placed upon contact precautions so as to minimize spread on the hands of health care workers. Health care workers should strictly adhere to infection control policies by wearing gloves and washing hands before and after patient contact. Rifampin coupled with a second oral antistaphylococcal drug sometimes provides long - term suppression and possibly cure of nasal carriage; this form of therapy is usually reserved for major problems of staphylococcal carriage, because staphylococci can rapidly develop resistance to rifampin.",

Placenta previa is used to describe a placenta that is implanted over or very near the internal cervical os. There are several possibilities: total placenta previa, marginal placenta previa, partial placenta previa. The most characteristic event in placenta previa is painless hemorrhage, which usually does not appear until near the end of the second trimester or after. However, bleeding may begin earlier, and some abortions may result from such an abnormal location of the developing placenta. Digital cervical examination is never permissible unless the woman is in an operating room with all the preparations for immediate cesarean delivery--even the gentlest digital examination can cause torrential haemorrhage. The simplest, safest, and most accurate method of placental localization is provided by transabdominal sonography. Accordingly, the average accuracy is 96 percent, and rates as high as 98 percent have been obtained. False-positive results are often a result of bladder distension. Therefore, scans in apparently positive cases should be repeated after emptying the bladder. Cesarean delivery is necessary in practically all women with placenta previa. Most often, a transverse uterine incision is possible. However, because foetal bleeding may result from a transverse incision into an anterior placenta, a vertical incision is sometimes employed. But, even when the incision extends through the placenta, maternal or fetal outcomes are rarely compromised.",

In cases of subtrochanteric shortening, the trochanter will be proximal to this line. Shoemaker's line: With the patient lying supine, the line joining AS1S and tip of the greater trochanter is extended on the side of the abdomen on both sides. Normally these lines meet in the middle above the umbilicus. In case one of the greater trochanters has migrated proximally the lines will meet in the opposite side of the abdomen and below the umbilicus. Chiene's line: With the patient lying supine, lines are drawn joining the two AS1S and the two greater trochanters. Normally these make two parallel lines. In case one of the trochanters has moved proximally the lines will converge on that side. Perkin's line: When the cong. Dislocation of the hip is mild in nature, the Perkins lines are drawn to detect it. A horizontal line is drawn through the triradiate cartilage and a vertical line is drawn down from the outer edge of the acetabulum on both sides. The upper femoral epiphyses normally lies medial to the vertical line and below the horizontal line. But in cong. dislocation of hip the epiphyses will lie on the outer aspect of the vertical line and above the horizontal line. Bryant's triangle: The patient lies supine. The tips of the greater trochanter and ASIS on both sides are marked. A perpendicular is dropped from each ASIS on to the bed. From the tip of the greater trochanter, another perpendicular is dropped on to the first one. The tips of the greater trochanter are joined to the ASIS on the respective side.

        "exp": "Ans- B Fat Embolism Syndrome Fat embolism refers to the presence of fat globules in lung parenchyma and peripheral circulation after fracture of a long bone or other major trauma. And fat embolism syndrome reflects a serious systemic manifestation as a consequence to these emboli. Pathophysiology Fat embolism is a common phenomenon it is more commonly seen in patients with multiple fractures and in fractures (involving lower limbs especially femur) Fat originates from the site of trauma, particularly from the injured marrow of the fractured bones and the suggestion that the fat arises from the plasma as a result of agglutination of chylomicrons is not supported by in vivo experiments. Circulating fat globules>10 um in diameter occur in most adults after close fracture of long bones and histological traces of fat can be found in the lungs and other internal organs. Clinical Presentation The patient is usually young adult with a lower limb (esp. femur) fracture, most commonly after closed fractures of long bone (esp. shaft femur) and more so when fractures are multiple. It usually manifests itself with in 24-48 hoursQ, but occasionaly the onset may be delayed for several days. Early warning signs (with in 72 hours of injury) are a slight rise in temperature (pyrexia) and pulse rate (tachycardia)Q In more pronounced cases there is breathlessness, mild mental confusion or restlessness, pectechiae on chest, axillae, retina & conjuctival folds; progressing to marked respiratory distress & coma in severe cases. Pulmonary Manifestations Tachypnea (increased respiration rate) with cyanosis Dyspnea (breathlessness) Low oxygen content often with a normal CO2 reading indicating there is inadequate oxygenation PO2<60 mm. Hg Chest x-ray show snow storm appearance and mottling -a sign which rapidly disappears in a day or two. Cerebral Manifestation Headache Mild mental confusion or restlessness Irritability Delirium Stupor Convulsion Coma Cerebral signs may regress & recur, suggesting repeated flooding of the circulation with fresh emboli. Cutaneous Manifestation Diagnostic petechial rash seen on Supraclavicular Infraclavicular Shoulder Front & back of chest Axillae Retinae and Conjunctiva of lower lid Periumblical Laboratory Tests There is no characteristic laboratory test However suggestive findings are Thrombocytopenia (platelets <=1. 5 lacks) P02 <60 mm Hg (8 kpa) Tachycardia Pyrexia Fall in hemoglobin value Microscopy of blood, sputum & urine for fat globules (gurd test) Fundoscopy of retina to see emboli, striate haemorrhages and fluffy exudates NCCT Head: shows characteristic focal emboli showers intracerebral region. Managment Prevention: Rough handling, inadequate immobilization and long journey to reach trauma centre are predisposing factors that must be avoided in long bone fractures. Fracture stabilization Removing fat emboli from circulation by Lipolytic agents as heparin (| serum lipase activity) Hypertonic glucose (decrease FFA production) Offset its effect by Vasodilation eg phenoxy benzamine Prompt correction of hypovolaemia Prophylactic use of O2 Dextran (expand plasma volume, reduce RBC aggregation and platelet adherence) Aprotinin (this protease inhibitor decrease platelet aggregation and serotonin release) Treatment of Established Case The aim of treatment is maintaining adequate oxygen level in the blood. If necessary by using intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Oxygen is the only therapeutic tool of proven use. It should be administered in sufficient amount to maintain arterial P02 >80 mm Hg O2 toxicity (pneumonitis) is avoided by using O2 conc. below 40% Steroids are given to avoid chemical pneumonitis resulting from break down of - pulmonary fat emboli into FFA.",

        "question": "The hypothesis 'Greater in the lipid solubility of the compound in olive oil, the greater is its anesthetic potency'is referred to as -",
        "exp": "Ans- A Meyer-Overton rule Ref- Inhaled anaesthetic agents act in different ways at the level of the central nervous system. They may disrupt normal synaptic transmission by interfering with the release of neurotransmitters from pre-synaptic nerve terminal (enhance or depress excitatory or inhibitory transmission), by altering the re-uptake of neurotransmitters, by changing the binding of neurotransmitters to the post-synaptic receptor sites or by influencing the ionic conductance change that follows activation of the post-synaptic receptor by neurotransmitters. Both pre- and post-synaptic effects have been found. Direct interaction with the neuronal plasma membrane is very likely, but indirect action via production of a second messenger also remains possible. The high correlation between lipid solubility and anaesthetic potency suggests that inhalational anaesthetic agents have a hydrophobic site of action. Inhalational agents may bind to both membrane lipids and proteins. It is not clear which of the different theories are most likely to be the main mechanism of action of inhalational anaesthetic agents. The Meyer-Overton theory describes the correlation between lipid solubility of inhaled anaesthetics and MAC and suggests that anaesthesia occurs when a sufficient number of inhalational anaesthetic molecules dissolve in the lipid cell membrane. The Meyer-Overton theory postulates that it is the number of molecules dissolved in the lipid cell membrane, and not the type of inhalational agent, that causes anaesthesia. Combinations of different inhaled anesthetics may have additive effects at the level of the cell membrane. Exceptions to the Meyer-Overton rule Enflurane and isoflurane are structural isomers and have similar oil: gas partition coefficients. However, the MAC for isoflurane is only approximately 70% of that for enflurane; thus, it would appear that there are other factors which influence potency. These include: Convulsant properties Complete halogenation, or complete end-methyl halogenation of alkanes and ethers results in decreased anaesthetic potency and the appearance of convulsant activity. Specific receptors For a given MAC reduction, plasma levels of morphine, alfentanyl, sufentanyl and fentanyl vary around 5000 fold. Levels of these four agents in brain lipid vary 10 fold; thus, studies of the reduction in MAC by opioids suggests two sites of action: the opioid receptor and some hydrophobic site. D-medetomidine This alpha-2-agonist results in a marked reduction in MAC, whereas its optical isomer, with identical lipid solubility, has no effect. Hydrophilic site of action L. Pauling & S. Miller (1961) independently proposed that anaesthesia may result from the formation of clatharates of water in membranes. In this model, anaesthetic molecules act as seeds for crystals of water, which subsequently alter membrane ion transport. This is less likely than the unitary theory, as there is a poor correlation between the ability of agents to form clatharates and their anaesthetic potency. Traube (1904) and Clements & Wilson (1962) proposed that potency correlated with a reduction in surface tension. However, these latter physical properties are closely related to those properties which determine hydrophobicity. Hence, the Meyer-Overton theory does not describe why anaesthesia occurs. Mullins expanded the Meyer-Overton rule by adding the 'Critical Volume Hypothesis'. He stated that the absorption of anaesthetic molecules could expand the volume of a hydrophobic region within the cell membrane and subsequently distort channels necessary for sodium ion flux and the development of action potentials necessary for synaptic transmission. The fact that anaesthesia occurs with a significant increase in the volume of hydrophobic solvents and is reversible by compressing the volume of the expanded hydrophobic region of the cell membrane supports Mullins' 'Critical Volume Hypothesis'. The protein receptor hypothesis postulates that protein receptors in the central nervous system are responsible for the mechanism of action of inhaled anaesthetics. This theory is supported by the steep dose-response curve for inhaled anaesthetics. However, it remains unclear if inhaled agents disrupt ion flow through membrane channels by an indirect action on the lipid membrane, via a second messenger or by direct and specific binding to channel proteins. Another theory describes the activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors by the inhalational anaesthetics. Volatile agents may activate GABA channels and hyperpolarise cell membranes. In addition, they may inhibit certain calcium channels and therefore prevent the release of neurotransmitters and inhibit glutamate channels. Volatile anaesthetics therefore may share common cellular actions with other sedative, hypnotic and analgesic drugs.",

        "exp": "Ana-A-Burkitt's lymphoma. Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th edition, Pg: 259 & 589. Explanation: BURKITT LYMPHOMAThere are three clinical types: African (endemic) Burkin lymphoma, Sporadic (nonendemic) Burkitt lymphoma. Aggressive lymphomas associated with HIV. These 3 types are histologically identical. Morphology. The tumor exhibits a high mitotic index and contains numerous apoptotic cells, the nuclear remnants of which are phagocytosed by interspersed benign macrophages. These phagocytes have abundant clear cytoplasm, creating a characteristic \"starry sky\" pattern. Immunophenotype. These are tumors of mature B cells. It expresses surface IgM, CD 19. CD20, CD 10, and BCL6. a phenotype consistent with a germinal center B-cell origin. Unlike other tumors of germinal center origin, this does not express anti-apoptotic protein BCL2. Molecular Pathogenesis. All forms of Burkitt lymphoma are associated with translocations of the c-MYC gene on chromosome 8. The translocation partner is usually the IgH locus but may also be the Ig g or y light-chain loci., All endemic tumors are latently infected with EBV, which is also present in about 25% of HIV- associated tumors and 15% to 20% of sporadic cases. Clinical Features. Endemic Burkitt lymphoma often presents as a mass involving the mandible and shows an unusual predilection for involvement of abdominal viscera, particularly the kidneys, ovaries, and adrenal glands. Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma most often appears as a mass involving the ileocecum and peritoneum. Burkitt lymphoma is very aggressive but responds well to intensive chemotherapy.

        "question": "Surgical scissors left in the abdomen is covered under which doctrine -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e. Res ipsa loquitor o Leaving scissors in the abdomen at the time of surgery is an example of criminal negligence in which the evidence speaks for itself and is thus covered under Res Ipsa. Loquitor. Doctrine related with negligence. Resp Ipsa Loquitar (fact speaks for itself): Generally the innocence of doctor is assumed and the patient has to establish the guilt, However, it is not required to prove negligence in a case where the doctrine of resp Ipsa loquitar applies; rather the doctor has to defend himself. Calculated risk doctrine: It is a defense to doctor. It states that 'resp Ipsa loquitar' should not be applied when the complained injury may have occurred even through proper care has been taken. The doctrine of common knowledge: Is a variant of res ipsa loquitar in which patient has to prove the negligence but he need not produce evidence to establish the standard of care (in res ipsa loquitar both are not required). It is based on assumption that the doctor will be held responsible for negligence in particular case which is within the common knowledge of medical practitioner e. g. not giving fluids in dehydrated or ATS in injuries. Diagnostic or Therapeutic misadventure: It is the occurrence of misadventure causing injury' or death of the patient due to the inherent risk of procedure or drug, e. g. adverse effects of a drug. It is unintentional. Medical maloccurance (inevitable accident or Act of God): On certain occasions, despite all proper care given by doctor during treatment, the patient may fail to respond properly or may suffer adverse reactions of the drug. It is due to biological variations in different people. Novus Actus interventions: A person is responsible for his actions and its consequences. This principle applies to cases of assault or accidental injuries. However, sometime such continuty of events is broken by an entirely new and unexpected happening, due to negligence of some other person, i. e. novus actus intervenient (an unrelated action intervening). For example. If a person has been assaulted due to which he has sustained large liver laceration, for which he is operated by a surgeon. If the patient dies intraoperative ly or postopratively due to complications related to surgery or injury, the person who has assaulted the patient will be held responsible. But, if the doctor has done some negligent act during surgery', e. g. left the swab or instrument in abdomen during surgery-; and patient dies because of that act (sepsis due to swab), then the response may pass from original incident to later negligent act of doctor by principle of 'novus actus intervention' (an unrelated action intervening). This doctor is responsible for the negligent act, i. e. criminal negligence(PGI 93, AP and the assailant will not be fully responsible for the ultimate harm. Contributory' negligence: It is defined as concurrent or simultaneous negligence of doctor and patient so as to lead to damage to the patient. Normally it is only a partial defence and court has right to fix liabilities between doctor and patient (doctrine of comparative negligence) and damages awarded may be reduced accordingly. Contributory' negligence can be used as defence by the doctor, but in civil cases only. It cannot be used as defence in following. Criminal negligence. Last clear chance doctrine; i. e. if doctor has discovered it before causing injury' and failed to avoid that, Avoidable consequences rule; i. e. due to negligence of doctor, there occurs damage to patient, but due to later damage of patient, damage becomes more. Good samartion doctrine: One who assisted another in serious need cannot be charged for contributory' negligence, provided that the assistance is not rash and reckless. Vicarious responsibility (Liability): It means master is liable for negligent acts of his serv ants, even inspite of absence of blame-worthy conduct on his part. Thus hospital and senior medical staff are responsible for negligent act of junior medical staff (interns and resident doctors). This responsibility is there because of master servant relationship, i. e. the senior can dictate the line of treatment to be followed. However, hospital is not responsible for senior medical staff as master servent relationship does not exist. The vicarious responsibility is there only in civil negligence cases and not in criminal cases. Borrow ed servant doctrine (captain of the ship doctrine): The private practitioner, who is not a staff of a private hospital, will be held responsible for all the negligent acts by any of the hospital staff on the patient admitted by him. The hospital will not be held here liable, because all the instructions for the patient admitted is carried on by hospital staff as told by private practitioner (i. e. he is the captain of the ship). Product liability: Manufacturer is liable for quality of drug and medical equipment.",

        "exp": "Ans- C Ref- Recommendations for PPH treatment The use of uterotonics (oxytocin alone as the first choice) plays a central role in the treatment of PPH (see Boxes 4and 5). Uterine massage is recommended for the treatment of PPH as soon as it is diagnosed (see Box 6) and the initial fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids is recommended. The use of tranexamic acid is advised in cases of refractory atonic bleeding or persistent trauma-related bleeding (see Box 5). The use of intrauterine balloon tamponade is recommended for refractory bleeding or if uterotonics are unavailable. Bimanual uterine compression, external aortic compression, and the use of non-pneumatic anti-shock garments are recommended as temporizing measures until substantive care is available. If there is persistent bleeding and the relevant resources are available, uterine artery embolization should be considered. If bleeding persists despite treatment with uterotonic drugs and other conservative interventions, surgical intervention should be used without further delay. Box 4 Recommendations for the treatment of PPH - uterotonics. Intravenous oxytocin is the recommended uterotonic drug for the treatment of PPH.

If the third stage of labour lasts more than 30 minutes, CCT and IV/IM oxytocin (10 IU) should be used to manage the retained placenta. If the placenta is retained and bleeding occurs, the manual removal of the placenta should be expedited. Whenever the manual removal of the placenta is undertaken, a single dose of prophylactic antibiotics is recommended (see Box 7). Box 7 Recommendations for the treatment of retained placenta. If the placenta is not expelled spontaneously, the use of additional oxytocin (10 IU, IV/IM) in combination with controlled cord traction is recommended. (Weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence) (more...) The GDG also issued recommendations related to the organization of PPH care (see Box 8). Health facilities delivering maternity services should adopt formal protocols for the prevention and treatment of PPH and for patient referral. The use of PPH treatment simulations for pre-service and in-service training programmes was recommended. Finally, the GDG recommended that the use of uterotonics for the prevention of PPH should be monitored and a specific indicator was suggested. Box 8 Health Systems and Organization of Care recommendations for the prevention and treatment of PPH. The use of formal protocols by health facilities for the prevention and treatment of PPH is recommended. (Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence) (more...) The GDG found insufficient evidence to recommend one route over another for the prevention of PPH with oxytocin, the use of recombinant factor VIIa for the treatment of PPH, intraumbilical vein injection of oxytocin for treatment of retained placenta, and the antenatal distribution of misoprostol. The GDG also found insufficient evidence to recommend self-administration for the prevention of PPH and the measurement of blood loss over clinical estimation (see Box 9).

It is a regular rhythm with a frequency of 8-13 Hz and amplitude of 50-100 m V. It is most marked in parietal and occipital lobe. It is associated with decreased level of attention, i. e., person is awake but has decreased attention (relaxed) - Person is thinking but with decreased attention (subconscious thinking). 2) Beta rhythm:- When attention is focused on something, the alpha rhythm is replaced by Beta rhythm. It is an irregular 13-30 Hz low voltage activity. It is most evident on frontal lobe and occurs when patient is fully awake and alert. Therefore this replacement of beta rhythm for alpha rhythm is called arousal or alerting response or alpha block. This phenomenon can be produced by any form of sensor stimulation or mental concentration such as solving arithmetic problems. Person is thinking with a maximum concentration - Conscious thinking. 3) Theta rhythm:- When person with alpha rhythm becomes slightly more relaxed (as occurs when there is transition from wakefullness to sleep, i. e., stage 1 of NREM), alpha rhythm is replaced by theta rhythm. Thinking is present but with even less attentiveness than which was present in alpha rhythm stage (Deep subcsoncious thinking).

The tumors are composed of polygonal to spindle-shaped chromaffin cells or chief cells, clustered with the sustentacular cells into small nests or alveoli (zellballen) by a rich vascular network.

Several histologic features, such as numbers of mitoses, confluent tumor necrosis, and spindle cell morphology, have been associated with an aggressive behavior and increased risk of metastasis, but these are not entirely reliable. Tumors with \"benign\" histologic features may metastasize, while bizarrely pleomorphic tumors may remain confined to the adrenal gland. In fact, cellular and nuclear pleomorphism, including the presence of giant cells, and mitotic figures are often seen in benign pheochromocytomas, while cellular monotony is paradoxically associated with an aggressive behavior. Even capsular and vascular invasion may be encountered in benign lesions. Therefore, the definitive diagnosis of malignancy in pheochromocytomas is based exclusively on the presence of metastases. These may involve regional lymph nodes as well as more distant sites, including liver, lung, and bone.",

Severe liver damage disrupts normal amino acid metabolism and is reflected in elevated serum levels of non-branched-chain amino acids. Since urea cannot be produced, ammonia cannot be handled. Elevated levels of serum ammonia certainly playa large role in the development of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver failure and portal hypertension. Therefore, levels of ammonia and, in the case of alkylosis, ammonium ion rise at the expense of urea. Other mechanisms leading to increased blood ammonia levels include excessive amounts of intestinal nitrogen (e. g., resulting from bleeding); decreased intestinal motility allowing greater bacterial deamination of amino acids; depressed renal function leading to an increase in blood urea nitrogen and a greater opportunity for bacterial urease to convert this to ammonia; alkalosis, which will preferentially lead the NHt /NH3 equilibrium in favor of ammonia; and portal hypertension, which will allow ammonia from the gut to bypass hepatic detoxification.",

At 12 meq/lit. respiratory paralysis and arrest occurs. Antidote for Mg. SO4 toxicity - Calcium gluconate Ig IV Two important indications for magnesium sulphate therapy: Eclampsia Preterm labour Ref 2- Overview Hypermagnesemia is an uncommon laboratory finding and symptomatic hypermagnesemia is even less common. This disorder has a low incidence of occurrence, because the kidney is able to eliminate excess magnesium by rapidly reducing its tubular reabsorption to almost negligible amounts. In healthy adults, plasma magnesium ranges from 1. 7-2. 3 mg/dL. Approximately 30% of total plasma magnesium is protein-bound and approximately 70% is filterable through artificial membranes (15% complexed, 55% free Mg2+ ions). With a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of approximately 150 L per day and an ultrafiltrable magnesium concentration of 14 mg/L, the filtered magnesium load is approximately 2, 100 mg per day. Normally, only 3% of filtered magnesium appears in urine; thus, 97% is reabsorbed by the renal tubules. In contrast to sodium and calcium, only approximately 25-30% of filtered magnesium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Approximately 60-65% of filtered magnesium is reabsorbed in the thick ascending loop of Henle and 5% is reabsorbed in the distal nephron. Relatively little is known about cellular magnesium transport mechanisms. The most common cause of hypermagnesemia is renal failure. Other causes include the following: Excessive intake Lithium therapy Hypothyroidism Addison disease Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia Milk alkali syndrome Depression Renal Failure Patients with end-stage renal disease often have mild hypermagnesemia, and the ingestion of magnesium-containing medications (eg, antacids, cathartics) can exacerbate the condition. In patients undergoing regular dialysis, the serum magnesium level directly relates to the dialysate magnesium concentration. In patients with acute renal failure, hypermagnesemia usually presents during the oliguric phase; the serum magnesium level returns to normal during the polyuric phase. If a patient receives exogenous magnesium during the oliguric phase, severe hypermagnesemia can result, especially if the patient is acidotic. Other Causes People often take magnesium-containing medications (eg, antacids, laxatives, enemas). Hypermagnesemia can develop after treatment of drug overdoses with magnesium-containing cathartics, and it also occurs in patients taking magnesium-containing medications for therapeutic purposes; however, most of these patients have normal renal function. With certain gastrointestinal disorders (eg, gastritis, colitis, gastric dilation), increased absorption of magnesium may lead to hypermagnesemia even if the patient does not ingest a large amount of magnesium. In any case, monitoring serum magnesium levels in patients taking magnesium-containing medications is prudent. Suicide attempts using magnesium-containing salt can lead to life-threatening hypermagnesemia, as well. Excessive tissue breakdown (sepsis, shock, large burns), especially with concurrent renal failure, can deliver a large amount of magnesium from the intracellular space, along with a massive elevation of phosphorus and potassium. In the treatment of eclampsia, hypermagnesemia is induced deliberately and sometimes can be symptomatic. Occasionally, hypermagnesemia also can occur in the newborn infant. Maternal magnesium therapy can increase the need for feeding and respiratory support and may cause neurobehavioral disorders in the newborn. Magnesium-containing phosphorus binders are rarely used in end-stage renal disease patients and can lead to elevated magnesium levels. Lithium therapy causes hypermagnesemia by decreasing urinary excretion, although the mechanism for this is not completely clear. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia may cause modest elevations in serum magnesium. This autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by very low excretion of calcium and magnesium and by a normal parathyroid hormone level. Abnormalities of calcium and magnesium handling are due to mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor, resulting in increased magnesium reabsorption in the loop of Henle. More recently, mutations of the codon Arg15 (p. R15) in the adaptor-related protein complex 2, s-2 subunit that interacts with the calcium-sensing receptor have been described. Hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, milk-alkali syndrome and theophylline intoxication occasionally produce mild elevations of serum magnesium. There has been some interest in the use of magnesium in the treatment and prevention of cardiac arrhythmias and in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, significant hypermagnesemia has not been reported in these settings. The role of mild elevation of serum magnesium levels in select patient populations is still being defined. In a study examining the prevalence of serum magnesium (Mg) alterations and outcomes in 65, 974 hospitalized adult patients, Mg levels of 2. 1 mg/dL or higher were found in 20, 777 patients (31. 5%). An elevated Mg level of 2. 3 mg/dL or higher was a predictor of adverse outcomes and associated with worse hospital mortality. In a different study by the same authors, both hypomagnesemia (<1. 5 mg/dL) and hypermagnesemia (>2. 3 mg/dl) on hospital admission were associated with an increased risk of developing in-hospital acute respiratory failure. the odds ratio (OR) was 1. 69 (95% confidence index, 1. 19-2. 36) with hypomagnesemia and 1. 40 (95% CI, 1. 02-1. 91) with hypermagnesemia. In patients admitted to intensive care units, initial magnesium levels >=2. 4 mg/dL (reference: 2. 0 to <2. 2 mg/dL) was independently associated with increased in mortality (adjusted OR of 1. 80; 95% CI: 1. 25-2. 59. In a large study of 5339 critically ill patients from Switzerland, hypermagnesemia was a strong independent risk factor for 28-day mortality (hazard ratio, 11. 6, P<0. 001). Similarly, in patients with chronic heart failure, a meta-analysis of 7 prospective studies with a total of 5172 subjects demonstrated that those with baseline hypermagnesemia had a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (risk ratio,, 1. 38; 95% CI, 1. 07-1. 78) or all-cause mortality (RR 1. 35; 95% CI, 1. 18-1. 54). On the other hand, in end-stage renal disease patients on dialysis--a population characterized by a particularly high mortality rate--a mild elevation of serum magnesium appeared protective against cardiovascular mortality, albeit without impacting all-cause mortality. Effects of Hypermagnesemia Symptoms of hypermagnesemia usually are not apparent unless the serum magnesium level is greater than 2 mmol/L. Concomitant hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, or uremia exaggerate the symptoms of hypermagnesemia at any given level. Neuromuscular symptoms These are the most common presenting problems. Hypermagnesemia causes blockage of neuromuscular transmission by preventing presynaptic acetylcholine release and by competitively inhibiting calcium influx into the presynaptic nerve channels via the voltage-dependent calcium channel. One of the earliest symptoms of hypermagnesemia is deep-tendon reflex attenuation. Facial paresthesias also may occur at moderate serum levels. Muscle weakness is a more severe manifestation, occurring at levels greater than 5 mmol/L. This manifestation can result in flaccid muscle paralysis and depressed respiration and can eventually progress to apnea. Conduction system symptoms Hypermagnesemia depresses the conduction system of the heart and sympathetic ganglia. A moderate increase in serum magnesium can lead to a mild decrease in blood pressure, and a greater concentration may cause severe symptomatic hypotension. Magnesium is also cardiotoxic and, in high concentrations, can cause bradycardia. Occasionally, complete heart block and cardiac arrest may occur at levels greater than 7 mmol/L. Hypocalcemia Apparently, hypocalcemia can result from a decrease in the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or from end-organ resistance to PTH. In patients with end-stage renal disease, high magnesium levels are associated with relative suppression of PTH, which may, in turn, contribute to hypocalcemia in this population. Paralytic ileus develops from smooth-muscle paralysis, and mothers being treated with magnesium for preterm labor suppression are at risk. Hypermagnesemia may interfere with blood clotting through interference with platelet adhesiveness, thrombin generation time, and clotting time. Nonspecific symptoms These symptoms include the following: Shortness of breath Nausea Vomiting Cutaneous flushing Diagnosis and Summary Hypermagnesemia usually results from a combination of excess magnesium intake and a coexisting impairment of renal function. Diagnosis is usually straightforward and involves measuring serum magnesium levels, as many cases are unsuspected. If a magnesium level is not immediately available, a clue to the existence of hypermagnesemia would be the disease context (preeclampsia, renal failure), the presence of magnesium-containing preparations, or a decreased anion gap. Prevention and Treatment of Hypermagnesemia Prevention of hypermagnesemia is usually possible. Anticipate hypermagnesemia in patients who are receiving magnesium treatment, especially those with reduced renal function. Initially, withdraw magnesium therapy, which often is enough to correct mild to moderate hypermagnesemia. In patients with symptomatic hypermagnesemia that is causing cardiac effects or respiratory distress, antagonize the effects by infusing calcium gluconate. Calcium antagonizes the toxic effect of magnesium, and these ions electrically oppose each other at their sites of action. This treatment usually leads to immediate symptomatic improvement. In subjects with frankly impaired ability to excrete magnesium (eg, end-stage renal disease), renal replacement therapy may also be necessary. Drug Category: Diuretics Agents that promote magnesium excretion are effective in treating hypermagnesemia. Furosemide (Lasix) may promote excretion of magnesium. It increases excretion of water by interfering with the chloride-binding cotransport system, which in turn inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henle and distal renal tubule. Drug Category: Calcium salts Calcium may moderate nerve and muscle performance in hypermagnesemia. Calcium gluconate (Kalcinate) directly antagonizes neuromuscular and cardiovascular effects of magnesium. Use in patients with symptomatic hypermagnesemia that is causing cardiac effects or respiratory distress. Drug Category: Antidiabetic agents Agents that shift magnesium ions into cells are helpful in treating hypermagnesemia. Glucose and insulin may help promote magnesium entry into cells. Glucose should be administered with insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. Monitor blood sugar levels frequently.",

Approach to treatment of POAG o Start monotherapy with topical b-blocker or latanoprost. o If target IOT is not attained either change over to the alternative drug or use both the above concurrently, o Brimonidine/dorazolamide/dipivefrine are used only when there are contraindications to PG analogues or b-blockers. o Topical miotics and oral acetazolamide are added only as the last resort. Systemic therapy is considered only as a last resort. Drugs used for systemic therapy are:- i) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (. dcefflzo/amrrfet.

MR imaging can be definitive in patients when there are clear tumor nodules adherent to the cauda equina or spinal cord, enhancing cranial nerves, or subarachnoid enhancement on brain imaging. Imaging is diagnostic in approximately 75% of patients and is more often positive in patients with solid tumors. Demonstration of tumor cells in the CSF is definitive and often considered the gold standard.

Guanine is always paired with cytosine by the formation of three hydrogen bonds. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) o DNA is the repository of genetic information. DNA is located in nucleus, DNA is also present in mitochondria (but less than 0. 1% of the total DNA). Most accepted model for DNA structure is \"Watson and Crick\" model. Which was proposed by Watson and Crick in 1953. We will discuss that here, o DNA is a double-stranded molecule. Each strand is a polymer of nucleotides (deoxy. Tibonucleotides). Each strand possesses a palority. It has a 31 end and a 51 end. The two strands are antiparalleh i. e. they are parallel but run in opposite directions. o The sugar of DNA is deoxyribose. The purine bases in DNA are adenine (A) and Guanine (G), and pyrimidines are thymine (T) and cytosine (C). Uracil (U), a pyrimidine, is not found in DNA. o Bonds involved in DNA structure are - Within nucleotides: the Glycosidic bond between carbon-1 of the pentose sugar (deoxyribose) and nitrogen-9 of a purine base or nitrogen-1 of the pyrimidine base. Between two strands of DNA: The two chains (strands) are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary pairs of bases. Adenine is always paired with thymine by the formation of two hydrogen bonds and Guanine is always paired with cytosine by the formation of three hydrogen bonds, Between successive nucleotides: Successive nucleotides in a strand of DNA are attached to each other by phosphodiester bonds. Carbon-31 and -51 of deoxyribose subunits are involved in ester linkages with an inorganic phosphate to form a 31, S' phosphodiester bond (a covalent bond). Thus alternating phosphate and deoxyribose units form the backbone structure of DNA while purine and pyrimidine bases are stacked inside. Base-staking interactions: The bases (purines and pyrimidines) lie flat in the interior, stacked on top of one another. They interact with one another through van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions. Collectively these two are known as base-stacking interactions.",

        "exp": "Ans-BREF: William's 22nd ed chapter 32. PROGESTERONE ONLY PILLS: So-called mini-pills are oral progestin-only contraceptives that are taken daily. Unlike combined oral contraceptives, they do not reliably inhibit ovulation. Rather, their effectiveness depends more on alterations in cervical mucus and effects on the endometrium. Because the mucus changes do not last longer than 24 hours, mini-pills should be taken at the same time every day to be maximally effective. These contraceptives have not achieved widespread popularity because of a much higher incidence of irregular bleeding and a somewhat higher pregnancy rate than combined contraceptives. Benefits. Progestin-only pills have minimal if any effect on carbohydrate metabolism or coagulation, and they do not cause or exacerbate hypertension. They may be ideal for some women who are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications. This includes women with a history of thrombosis, hypertension, or migraine headaches, or who are older than 35 years of age and who smoke. The mini-pills is often an excellent choice for lactating women. In combination with breastfeeding, it is virtually 100 percent effective for up to 6 months and does not impair milk production. Disadvantages. The major drawback of progestin-only pills is a contraceptive failure. With these failures, there is a relative increase in the proportion of ectopic pregnancies. Irregular uterine bleeding is most common and another distinct disadvantage and may manifest as amenorrhea, spotting, breakthrough bleeding, or prolonged periods of amenorrhea or menorrhagia. Functional ovarian cysts develop with a greater frequency in women using these agents, although they do not usually necessitate intervention. A distinct disadvantage is that these contraceptives must be taken at the same or nearly the same time daily. Finally, unlike combined oral contraceptives, the mini-pills does not improve acne and may even worsen it in some women. Contraindications: Progestin-only pills are contraindicated in women with unexplained uterine bleeding, especially in older women.",

(a) PCOS Ref: Shaws 15th ed. /115-116, Image- * GARLAND/NECKLACE pattern on USG: PCOS * Comet tail appearance: Adenomyomatosis * Snowstorm appearance: Choriocarcinoma Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), recently referred also as hyperandrogenic anovulation, is a chronic anovulation syndrome associated with androgen excess. The diagnosis is made on the combined clinical, biochemical and sonographic grounds. The revised 2003 ASRM/ESHRE Rotterdam consensus criteria 4 require two of the following three criteria for the diagnosis: oligo- or anovulation hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical) and follicle count on imaging As well as the exclusion of other aetiologies, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing syndrome and/or an androgen-secreting tumour. Subsequently, the Androgen Excess and PCOS society (AE-PCOS) 9 specified a similar set of criteria for diagnosing PCOS but added that PCOS should be seen primarily as a disorder of androgen excess or hyperandrogenism. The criteria set forward was: presence of hyperandrogenism (clinical and/or biochemical) ovarian dysfunction (oligo-anovulation and/or polycystic ovaries) exclusion of related disorders Terminology Hyperandrogenic anovulation has been proposed as more accurate and potentially less confusing term, as the ovarian feature is of multiple follicles and not cysts13. At this stage, however, PCOS remains the term that is widely known and used. Epidemiology The estimated prevalence is ~6% (range 4-8%) of women of reproductive age but this varies (up to 20%) depending on the diagnostic criteria used 11. Clinical presentation The classic triad of PCOS is: oligomenorrhea hirsutism obesity In addition to this, patients may have infertility, acne, male pattern balding or biochemically show increased androgen levels. Pathology Markers Luteinizing hormone (LH) is usually increased and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) can be normal or decreased 10. Normally premenopausal LH: FSH is 1: 1. In PCOS it may be >2: 1 or >3: 1. Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels are generally increased. Associations subfertility and recurrent pregnancy loss. long-term increased risk of type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease endometrial cancer 6 women with polycystic ovarian morphology are at increased risk of OHSS when undergoing IVF, regardless of whether they have PCOS15 Radiographic features Ultrasound Current recommended sonographic criteria for multifollicular ovarian morphology: 25 or more follicles per ovary (superseding the earlier Rotterdam criteria of 12 or more follicles) 14 increased ovarian size (>10 cc): less sensitive than the follicle number criteria, but has a role when image resolution does not allow accurate follicle count, e. g. transabdominal scanning, older equipment Other morphological features include: hyperechoic central stroma peripheral location of follicles: which can give a string of pearl appearance follicles of similar size measuring 2-9 mm The presence of a single multifollicular ovary is sufficient to provide the sonographic criterion for PCOS2. Ovaries may be normal in PCOS, and conversely, polycystic ovaries may be seen in women without the syndrome. Diagnosis requires correlation with features of hyperandrogenism and oligo-anovulation. MRI MRI is not warranted routinely in the investigation of PCOS, nonetheless pelvic MRI may show most or all of the above sonographic features. Signal characteristics include: T1: small uniform follicles are low in signal while the central stroma is of intermediate signal (vs normal myometrium) T2: follicles have high T2 signal while the central stroma is of comparatively low T2 signal 8 Practical points with a lack of consensus sometimes it is easier to report the number of follicles in each ovary rather than attempt to label the ovaries as \"polycystic\" or \"multifollicular\" History and etymology The syndrome was first described by I.

Types of Restriction Enzymes Restriction enzymes are traditionally classified into four types on the basis of subunit composition, cleavage position, sequence specificity and cofactor requirements. However, amino acid sequencing has uncovered extraordinary variety among restriction enzymes and revealed that at the molecular level there are many more than four different types. Type I enzymes are complex, multisubunit, combination restriction-andmodification enzymes that cut DNA at random far from their recognition sequences. Type II enzymes cut DNA at defined positions close to or within their recognition sequences. They produce discrete restriction fragments and distinct gel banding patterns, and they are the only class used in the laboratory for DNA analysis and gene cloning. Rather than forming a single family of related proteins, Type II enzymes are a collection of unrelated proteins of many different sorts. Type II enzymes frequently differ so utterly in amino acid sequence from one another, and indeed from every other known protein, that they exemplify the class of rapidly evolving proteins that are often indicative of involvement in host-parasite interactions. The most common Type II enzymes are those like HhaI, Hind. III and NotI that cleave DNA within their recognition sequences. Enzymes of this kind are the principle ones available commercially.. Type III enzymes are also large combination restriction-andmodification enzymes. They cleave outside of their recognition sequences and require two such sequences in opposite orientations within the same DNA molecule to accomplish cleavage; they rarely give complete digests. Type IV enzymes recognize modified, typically methylated DNA and are exemplified by the Mcr. BC and Mrr systems of E. coli.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Pancreatic divisum Ref - Pancreas divisum represents a variation in pancreatic ductal anatomy that can be associated with abdominal pain and idiopathic pancreatitis. It is characterised, in the majority of cases, by the dorsal pancreatic duct (main pancreatic and Santorini ducts) directly entering the minor papilla with no communication with the ventral duct (Wirsung), and thus, the major papilla. Epidemiology It is the most common variation of pancreatic duct formation and may be present in ~4-10 % of the general population 3-4, 6. Its MRCP prevalence is at around 9% with autopsy prevalence going up to 14% 7. Clinical presentation Most people with a pancreas divisum are asymptomatic, but this is more frequently found in patients with chronic abdominal pain and idiopathic pancreatitis than in the general population 4. Pathology It results from failure of fusion of dorsal and ventral pancreatic anlages. As a result, the dorsal pancreatic duct drains most of the pancreatic glandular parenchyma via the minor papilla. Although controversial, this variant is considered as a cause of pancreatitis. Pancreatic divisum can result in a santorinicoele, which is a cystic dilatation of the distal dorsal duct (Santorini duct), immediately proximal to the minor papilla. Three subtypes are known: type 1 (classic): no connection at all; occurs in the majority of cases: 70% type 2 (absent ventral duct): minor papilla drains all of pancreas while major papilla drains bile duct; 20-25% type 3 (functional): filamentous or inadequate connection between dorsal and ventral ducts: 5-6% Radiographic features Fluoroscopy: ERCP This was the traditional method of diagnosis where a pancreas divisum was suspected when there was no contrast extending towards the pancreatic tail upon administration at the ampulla of Vater. MRCP/MRI pancreas It is the current gold standard method of evaluation. The key imaging features: the dorsal pancreatic duct being in direct continuity with the duct of Santorini, which drains into the minor ampulla ventral duct (Wirsung duct), which does not communicate with the dorsal duct but joins with the distal bile duct to enter the major ampulla Some authors suggest increased sensitivity of secretin MRCP (S-MRCP) in detection sensitivity of pancreas divisum 2. Treatment and prognosis A diagnosis of pancreas divisum does not routinely warrant treatment, especially when incidental and asymptomatic. In symptomatic patients (e. g. recurrent pancreatitis), management options may include 6: non-operative treatment +/- pancreatic enzyme supplements minor papillectomy minor papilla stenting balloon dilatation of any associated stricture",

Each hair cell has 50-70 small cilia called stereocilia and a large cilium called the kinocilium. The kinocilium is always located to one side and the stereocilia become progressively shorter toward the other side of the cell. Minute filamentous attachments almost invisible even to the electron microscope connect the tip of each stereocilium to the next longer stereocilium and finally to the kinocilium Because of these attachments, when the stereocilia and kinocilium bend in the direction of the kinocilium, the filamentous attachments tug in sequence on the stereocilia pulling them outward from the cell body. This opens hundreds of fluid channels in the neuronal cell membrane around the bases of the stereocilia and these channels are capable of conducting large amounts of positive ions. The positive ions pour into the cell from the surrounding endolymphatic fluid causing receptor membrane depolarization. Conversely bending of the stereocilia in the opposite direction can cause receptor hyperpolarization.",

        "exp": "Ans. A. Osteogenesis imperfecta. (Ref. H - 17th/pg. 2411). Blue sclera is a distinct feature of OGLSCLEROSING BONE DISORDERS# OSTEOPETROSIS# PYKNODYSOSTOSIS# PROGRESSIVE DIAPHYSEAL DYSPLASIA (Camurati-Engelman disease)# HYPEROSTOSIS CORTICALIS GENERALISATA (van Buchem disease)# MELORHEOSTOSIS (Greek, \"flowing hyperostosis\")# OSTEOPOIKILOSIS (\"spotted bones\")# Hepatitis C-associated osteosclerosis (HCAO). Pyknodysostosis:# Pyknodysostosis is a form of short-limb dwarfism that presents with frequent fractures but usually normal lifespan. Clinical features include short stature; kyphoscoliosis and deformities of the chest; high arched palate; proptosis; blue sclerae; dysmorphic features including small face and chin, frontooccipital prominence, pointed beaked nose, large cranium, and obtuse mandibular angle; and small square hands with hypoplastic nails. Radiographs demonstrate a generalized increase in bone density, but in contrast to osteopetrosis, the long bones are normally shaped. Separated cranial sutures, including the persistent patency of the anterior fontanel, are characteristic of the disorder. There may also be hypoplasia of the sinuses, mandible, distal clavicles, and terminal phalanges. Persistence of deciduous teeth and sclerosis of the calvarium and base of the skull are also common. Anchondo dysplasia:# This is a relatively common form of short-limb dwarfism that occurs in 1 in 15, 000 to 1 in 40, 000 live births. The disease is caused by a mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene that results in a gain-of-function state. Most cases are sporadic mutations. However, when the disorder appears in families, the inheritance pattern is consistent with an autosomal dominant disorder. The primary defect is abnormal chondrocyte proliferation at the growth plate that causes the development of short but proportionately thick long bones. Other regions of the long bones may be relatively unaffected. The disorder is manifest by the presence of short limbs (particularly the proximal portions), normal trunk, large head, saddle nose, and an exaggerated lumbar lordosis. Severe spinal deformity may lead to cord compression. The homozygous disorder is more serious than the sporadic form and may cause neonatal death. Pseudo-achondroplasia clinically resembles achondroplasia but has no skull abnormalities. Osteopetrosis (marble bone disease):# Osteopetrosis refers to a group of disorders caused by severe impairment of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. There is the solid x-ray appearance of the involved skeleton, o Diaphyses and metaphyses are broadened, and alternating sclerotic and lucent bands may be seen in the iliac crests, at the ends of long bones, and in vertebral bodies. The cranium is usually thickened, particularly at the base of the skull, and the paranasal and mastoid sinuses are under pneumatized. Albers-Schonberg disease refers to the milder, adult form of osteopetrosis (autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type II). Mice deficient in RANK lack osteoclasts and develop severe osteopetrosis. As bone and cartilage fail to undergo modeling, paralysis of one or more cranial nerves may occur due to narrowing of the cranial foramina. Failure of skeletal modeling also results in inadequate marrow space, leading to extramedullary hematopoiesis with hypersplenism and pancytopenia. Hypocalcemia due to lack of osteoclastic bone resorption may occur in infants and young children. The untreated infantile disease is fatal, often before age 5. The course is not always benign, as fractures may be accompanied by blue sclerae, loss of vision, deafness, psychomotor delay, mandibular osteomyelitis, and other complications usually associated with the juvenile form. /gjt: Allogenic HLA-identical bone marrow transplantation has been successful in some children. Following transplantation, the marrow contains progenitor cells and normally functioning osteoclasts. A cure is most likely when children are transplanted before age 4.",

Expresses CD20 and is classified as considered a form of non- classical Hodgkin's.*Microscopic examination of the lymph node biopsy reveals complete or partial effacement of the lymph node architecture by scattered large malignant cells known as Reed-Sternberg cells (RSC) admixed within a reactive cell infiltrate composed of variable proportions of lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells.*The Reed-Sternberg cells are identified as large often bi-nucleated cells with prominent nucleoli and an unusual CD45-, CD30+, CD 15+/- immunophenotype. In approximately 50% of cases, the Reed-Sternberg cells are infected by the Epstein-Barr virus.*Characteristics of classic Reed-Sternberg cells include large size (20-50 micrometers), abundant, amphophilic, finely granular/homogeneous cytoplasm; two mirror- image nuclei (owl eyes) each with an eosinophilic nucleolus and a thick nuclear membrane (chromatin is distributed close to the nuclear membrane).",

Its physiologic function is to selectively suppress pituitaty release of FSH.

Luteinizing hormone (LH) is suppressed by testosterone of Leydig cell origin. Selective destruc\u00adtion of Sertoli cells with Leydig cells left intact would have no effect on circulating levels of testosterone or LH.

Measles Note-A few points about measles. Measles virus has only one serotype. It can't survive outside the human body for any length of time. Only source of infection is a case of measles. \"CARRIERS are not known to Occur\". Measles is highly infectious during the prodromal period and at the time of appearance of rash. The communicability is approx 4 days before to 5 days after the appearance of the rash* Carriers - A carrier is defined as an infected person or animal that harbors a specific infectious agent in the absence of discernible clinical disease and serves as a potential source of infection for others. Carriers may be classified as: Incubatory carriers. Convalescent carriers. Healthy carriers. Incubatory carriers -Incubatory carriers are those who shed the infectious agent during the incubation period of the disease. eg. Measles, Mumps, Polio, Pertussis, Influenza, Diptheria, Hepatitis B. Convalescent carriers -Those carriers who continue to shed the disease agent during the period of convalescenceeg. Typhoid, Dysentery, Cholera, Diptheria, Whooping Cough. Healthy carriers -Healthy carriers are those who have developed the carrier state without suffering from the overt diseases. Healthy carriers emerge from subclinical caseseg. Polio, Cholera, Meningococcal Meningitis, Diptheria, Typhoid. Carriers can also be classified according to duration: Temporary carriers. Chronic carriers. Temporary carriers -are those who shed the infectious agents for a short period of time. Chronic carriers -is one who excretes the infectious agents for an indefinite period. eg. Typhoid, Hepatitis, Dysentery, Malaria, Gonorrhea, Diptheria, Cerebrospinal meningitis. What are pseudo carriers? -Pseudo carriers are carriers of avirulent organisms (organisms which are not able to cause any disease)",

        "exp": "Crossover occurs during the pachytene stage of meiosis. Meiosis is the mechanism used by the reproductive organs to generate gametes-cells with the haploid number of chromosomes. DNA synthesis occurs before meiotic prophase begins and is followed by a G2 phase. Cells then enter meiotic prophase I. During meiotic prophase I, maternal and paternal' chromosomes are precisely paired, and recombination occurs in each pair of homologous chromosomes. The first meiotic prophase consists of five substages: leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene, and diakinesis. During metaphase I, there is random segregation of maternal and paternal chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes are aligned on the metaphase plate of the meiotic spindle in metaphase I. The second meiotic division is responsible for the reduction in the chromosome content of the cell by 50%. In meiotic division II, metaphase consists of daughter chromatids of single homologous chromosomes aligned on a metaphase plate (metaphase II). Condensation of the chromatids occurs in leptotene. In zygotene, the synaptonemal complex begins to form, which initiates the close association between chromosomes known as synapsis. The bivalent is formed between the two sets of homologous chromosomes (one set maternal and one set paternal equals a pair of maternal chromatids and a pair of paternal chromatids). The four chromatids form a tetrad (bivalent). Pachytene begins as soon as the synapsis is complete and includes the period of crossover. The fully formed synaptonemal complex is present during the pachytene stage. At each point where crossover has occurred between two chromatids of the homologous chromosomes, an attachment point known as a chiasma forms. The formation of chiasmata and de synapsing (separation of the axes of the synaptonemal complex) occurs in the diplotene stage. Diakinesis is an intermediate phase between diplotene and metaphase of the first meiotic division.",

Thus, for radiation-induced stochastic effects, the greater the radiation dose received, the greater the probability of the effect occurring. It should be noted that it is the probability of the occurrence of effect which is related to dose not the severity.

JRA is characterized by a chronic synovial inflamma\u00adtion of unknown origin; it most commonly affects the knees, but can also manifest in wrists, ankles, and the atlanto-axial joint in the neck. In general, JRA is more common in girls than boys, but this varies with the type of JRA, which can be divided into the following variant subsets: Still disease (20%), polyarticular (40%), and pauciarticular (40%). Still disease most closely resembles an infectious disease, with spiking fever, a centripetal rash, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, transient arthralgias and ar\u00adthritis, and effusions (pericardial and pleural). The polyarticular variant is associated with destructive ar\u00adthritis, particularly if the patient tests positive for the rheumatoid factor.

Now read carefully what Nelson has to say about HMD. \" Hyaline membrane disease occurs primarily in premature infants, the incidence is inversely proportional to the gestational age and birth weight. It occurs in 60-80% of infants less than 28 wks of gestational age, in 15-30% of those between 32 and 36 wks in about 5% beyond 37 wk and rarely at term*\". So it must be clear to you that hyaline membrane disease is rare in a term infant and the infant in question is a term infant (40 wks). About transient tachy apnea, It's written that \"it usually follows uneventful normal preterm or term vaginal delivery or Cesarian delivery. \"SOHyaline membrane disease is an important cause of respiratory distress in preterm infants and rarely in term infants whereas transient tachy apnea of the newborn causes respiratory distress in term infants. Now the only confusion left us about diabetes (it increases the incidence of hyaline membrane disease in infants. 1 thinks the history of diabetes is given to confuse us.

        "question": "Type of sampling shown in Figure is",
        "exp": "Ans- A Simple random sampling Ref - Review: Simple Random Sampling Do you remember how simple random sampling works? Visually, it's just numbering each individual and randomly selecting a certain number of them. Here's the image we used in the previous section: Stratified Sampling Stratified sampling is different. With this technique, we separate the population using some characteristic, and then take a proportional random sample from each. A stratified sample is obtained by separating the population into non-overlapping groups called strata and then obtaining a proportional simple random sample from each group. The individuals within each group should be similar in some way. Visually, it might look something like the image below. With our population, we can easily separate the individuals by color. Once we have the strata determined, we need to decide how many individuals to select from each stratum. (Man, that's a weird word!) The key here is that the number selected should be proportional. In our case, 1/4 of the individuals in the population are blue, so 1/4 of the sample should be blue as well. Working things out, we can see that a stratified (by color) random sample of 4 should have 1 blue, 1 green, and 2 reds. Example 1 One easy example using a stratified technique would be a sampling of people at ECC. To make sure that a sufficient number of students, faculty, and staff are selected, we would stratify all individuals by their status - students, faculty, or staff. (These are the strata.) Then, a proportional number of individuals would be selected from each group. Systematic Sampling A systematic sample is obtained by selecting every kth individual from the population. The first individual selected corresponds to a random number between 1 and k. So to use systematic sampling, we need to first order our individuals, then select every kth. (More on how to select k in a bit.) In our example, we want to use 3 for k? Can you see why? Think what would happen if we used 2 or 4. For our starting point, we pick a random number between 1 and k. For our visual, let's suppose that we pick 2. The individuals sampled would then be 2, 5, 8, and 11. In general we find k by taking N/n and rounding down to the nearest integer. For another take, watch this You. Tube video: Example 2 Systematic sampling works well when the individuals are already lined up in order. In the past, students have often used this method when asked to survey a random sample of ECC students. Since we don't have access to the complete list, just stand at a corner and pick every 10th* person walking by. * Of course, choosing 10 here is just an example. It would depend on the number of students typically passing by that spot and what sample size was needed. Cluster Sampling Cluster sampling is often confused with stratified sampling, because they both involve \"groups\". In reality, they're very different. In stratified sampling, we split the population up into groups (strata) based on some characteristic. A cluster sample is obtained by selecting all individuals within a randomly selected collection or group of individuals. In essence, we use cluster sampling when our population is already broken up into groups (clusters), and each cluster represents the population. That way, we just select a certain number of clusters. With our visual, let's suppose the 12 individuals are paired up just as they were sitting in the original population. Since we want a random sample of size four, we just select two of the clusters. We would number the clusters 1-6 and use technology to randomly select two random numbers. It might look something like this: Example 3 One situation where cluster sampling would apply might be in manufacturing. Suppose your company makes light bulbs, and you'd like to test the effectiveness of the packaging. You don't have a complete list, so simple random sampling doesn't apply, and the bulbs are already in boxes, so you can't order them to use systematic. And all the bulbs are essentially the same, so there aren't any characteristics with which to stratify them. To use cluster sampling, a quality control inspector might select a certain number of entire boxes of bulbs and test each bulb within those boxes. In this case, the boxes are the clusters. Convenience Sampling Other methods do exist for finding samples of populations. In fact, you've seen some already. Probably the most common is the so-called convenience sample. Convenience samples are just what they sound like - convenient. Unfortunately, they're rarely representative. Think of the radio call-in show, those people in the shopping malls trying to survey you about your purchasing habits, or even the voting on American Idol! Here's a specific example. It's a poll on beliefnet. com, titled \"What Evangelicals Want\". All online polls use, by nature, convenience sampling. According to the article, \"The poll was promoted on Beliefnet's web site and through its newsletters. \" Only those evangelicals who visit this particular web site and actually answer the survey are included. Beware any poll result taken with convenience sampling. Multistage Sampling Often one technique isn't possible, so many professional polling agencies use a technique called multistage sampling. The strategy is relatively self-explanatory - two or more sampling techniques are used. For example, consider the light-bulb example we looked at earlier with cluster sampling. Let's suppose that the bulbs come off the assembly line in boxes that each contain 20 packages of four bulbs each. One strategy would be to do the sample in two stages: Stage 1: A quality control engineer removes every 200th box coming off the line. (The plant produces 5, 000 boxes daily. (This is systematic sampling.) Stage 2: From each box, the engineer then samples three packages to inspect. (This is an example of cluster sampling.) The US Census also uses multistage sampling. If you haven't already (you should have!), read Section 1. 4 in your text for more details.

        "exp": "Ans is a. ie. FISH * The above-mentioned site writes about FISH- * \"FISH can be used in interphase cells to determine the chromosome number of one or more chromosomes as well as to detect some specific chromosome rearrangements that are characteristic for certain cancers. The primary advantage of interphase FISH is that it can be performed very rapidly if necessary, usually within 24 hours, because cell growth is not required.* A good example is the Aneuploid Screen test which is performed on amniotic fluid cells when there is a strong clinical indication for one of the common trisomies. The sample nuclei are denatured and hybridized with DNA probes for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y and results usually obtained within 24 hours. Routine Cytogenetics is included with an Aneuploid Screen to confirm the results or detect any abnormalities not detected by interphase FISH. \"Fluorescent IN SITU Hybridization (FISH). Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) is a relatively new technology utilizing fluorescently labeled DNA probes to detect or confirm gene or chromosome abnormalities that are generally beyond the resolution of routine cytogenetics. The sample DNA (metaphase chromosomes or interphase nuclei) is first denatured, a process that separates the complementary strands within the DNA double helix structure. The fluorescently labeled probe of interest is then added to the denatured sample mixture and hybridizes with the sample DNA at the target site as it reanneals (or reforms itself) back into a double helix. The probe signal can then be seen through a fluorescent microscope and the sample DNA scored for the presence or absence of the signal. FISH can be used in metaphase cells to detect specific microdeletions beyond the resolution of routine cytogenetics or identify the extra material of unknown origin. It can also help in cases where it is difficult to determine from routine cytogenetics if a chromosome has a simple deletion or is involved in a subtle or complex rearrangement. In addition, metaphase FISH can detect some of the specific chromosome rearrangements seen in certain cancers. Microdeletion Syndromes Currently Diagnosable with FISHCri-du-Chat * Kallman Syndrome. Miller-Dieker Syndrome * Williams Syndrome. Smith-Magenis Syndrome * Wolf-Hirschhorn. Steroid Sulfatase Deficiency * Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndrome. Di. George/Velo-Cardio-Facial/CATCH-*22/Shprintzen Syndrome. Single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP)SSCP is the electrophoretic separation of single-stranded nucleic acids based on subtle differences in sequence (often a single base pair) which results in a different secondary structure and a measurable difference in mobility through a gel. The mobility of double-stranded DNA in gel electrophoresis is dependent on strand size and length but is relatively independent of the particular nucleotide sequence. The mobility of single strands, however, is noticeably affected by very small changes in sequence, possibly one changed nucleotide out of several hundred. Small changes are noticeable because of the relatively unstable nature of single-stranded DNA; in the absence of a complementary strand, the single strand may experience intrastrand base pairing, resulting in loops and folds that give the single strand a unique 3D structure, regardless of its length. A single nucleotide change could dramatically affect the strand's mobility through a gel by altering the intrastrand base pairing and its resulting 3D conformation (Melcher, 2000). Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis takes advantage of this quality of single-stranded DNA. SSCP analysis offers an inexpensive, convenient, and sensitive method for determining genetic variation. The SSCP analysis method detects point mutations by analyzing their unique electrophoretic mobility that results from small changes in the variant's nucleotide sequences. Polymerase chain reaction is a sensitive and rapid method for amplifying a specific DNA sequence.",

The tumor is malignant in 10% of cases but may be cured completely by surgical removal. Although pheochromocytoma has classically been associated with 3 syndromes--von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)--there are now 10 genes that have been identified as sites of mutations leading to pheochromocytoma. Axial, T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showing large left suprarenal mass of high signal intensity on a T2-weighted image. The mass is a pheochromocytoma. View Media Gallery Signs and symptoms Classically, pheochromocytoma manifests as spells with the following 4 characteristics: Headaches Palpitations Diaphoresis Severe hypertension Typical patterns of the spells are as follows: Frequency may vary from monthly to several times per day Duration may vary from seconds to hours Over time, spells tend to occur more frequently and become more severe as the tumor grows The following may also occur during spells: Tremor Nausea Weakness Anxiety, sense of doom Epigastric pain Flank pain Constipation Clinical signs associated with pheochromocytomas include the following: Hypertension: Paroxysmal in 50% of cases Postural hypotension: From volume contraction Hypertensive retinopathy Weight loss Pallor Fever Tremor Neurofibromas Tachyarrhythmias Pulmonary edema Cardiomyopathy Ileus Cafe au lait spots See Clinical Presentation for more detail. Diagnosis Diagnostic tests for pheochromocytoma include the following: Plasma metanephrine testing: 96% sensitivity, 85% specificity 24-hour urinary collection for catecholamines and metanephrines: 87. 5% sensitivity, 99. 7% specificity Test selection criteria include the following: Use plasma metanephrine testing in patients at high risk (ie, those with predisposing genetic syndromes or a family or personal history of pheochromocytoma) Use 24-hour urinary collection for catecholamines and metanephrines in patients at lower risk Imaging studies should be performed only after biochemical studies have confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Studies are as follows: Abdominal CT scanning: Has accuracy of 85-95% for detecting adrenal masses with a spatial resolution of 1 cm or greater MRI: Preferred over CT scanning in children and pregnant or lactating women; has reported sensitivity of up to 100% in detecting adrenal pheochromocytomas Scintigraphy: Reserved for biochemically confirmed cases in which CT scanning or MRI does not show a tumor PET scanning: A promising technique for detection and localization of pheochromocytomas Additional studies to rule out a familial syndrome in patients with confirmed pheochromocytoma include the following: Serum intact parathyroid hormone level and a simultaneous serum calcium level to rule out primary hyperparathyroidism (which occurs in MEN 2A) Screening for mutations in the ret proto-oncogene (which give rise to MEN 2A and 2B) Genetic testing for mutations causing the MEN 2A and 2B syndromes Consultation with an ophthalmologist to rule out retinal angiomas (VHL disease) See Workup for more detail. Management Surgical resection of the tumor is the treatment of choice and usually cures the hypertension. Careful preoperative treatment with alpha and beta blockers is required to control blood pressure and prevent intraoperative hypertensive crises. Preoperative medical stabilization is provided as follows: Start alpha blockade with phenoxybenzamine 7-10 days preoperatively Provide volume expansion with isotonic sodium chloride solution Encourage liberal salt intake Initiate a beta blocker only after adequate alpha blockade, to avoid precipitating a hypertensive crisis from unopposed alpha stimulation Administer the last doses of oral alpha and beta blockers on the morning of surgery See Treatment and Medication for more detail.",

Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with variable block represents the classic rhythm of digitalis intoxication. Digoxin is profibrillatory, but its administration should not lead to atrial flutter. Therapeutic levels of digitalis generate characteristic ST - segment and T-wave changes in most individuals taking the drug.

In patients with KD, galactocerebroside cannot be metabolized during the normal turnover or myelin because of deficiency of galactocerebroside \u03b2-galactosidase.

It may arise in any anatomic location, but most occur in the head and neck or genitourinary tract, where there is little if any skeletal muscle as a normal constituent. Rhabdomyosarcoma is histologically sub classified into embryonal, alveolar, and pleomorphic variants. The rhabdomyoblast-the diagnostic cell in all types-contains eccentric eosinophilic granular cytoplasm rich in thick and thin filaments. Rhabdomyoblasts may be round or elongate; the latter are known as tadpole or strap cells, and may contain cross-striations visible by light microscopy. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common type, accounting for 60% of rhabdomyosarcomas. It includes the sarcoma botryoides as well as spindle cell and anaplasticvariants. The tumor occurs in children younger than 10 years of age and typically arises in the nasal cavity, orbit, middle ear, prostate, and paratesticular region. This variant of rhabdomyosarcoma commonly has parental isodisomy of chromosome 11p15. 5, which leads to overexpression of the imprinted IGFII gene. The sarcoma botryoides subtype develops in the walls of hollow, mucosal-lined structures, such as the nasopharynx, common bile duct, bladder, and vagina. Where the tumors abut the mucosa of an organ, they form a submucosal zone of hypercellularity called the cambium layer.",
