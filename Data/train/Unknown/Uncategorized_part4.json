        "exp": "Ans- C San Philipo disease Ref= BACKGROUND: After many years of intensive investigation, enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT) has become standard treatment for patients with type 1 (non-neuronopathic) Gaucher's disease. ERT has greatly changed the clinical course of this disorder by reducing hepatosplenomegaly, by improving anaemia and thrombocytopenia, and by ameliorating skeletal damage. This example has prompted the investigation of ERT for several other metabolic disorders. The results of several of these trials have recently been published. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: In addition to Gaucher's disease, the effects of ERT in four other major metabolic storage disorders have been reported. Among these rare orphan diseases are Fabry's disease, in which the heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and peripheral nerves are damaged; Pompe's disease, in which the heart, skeletal muscles, and brain are involved; Hurler's disease and Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome in which the eyes, liver, joints, and skeleton are usually affected. Responses to ERT in these four disorders have generally been encouraging although the degree and extent of benefit vary considerably. WHERE NEXT: There are several critical features of ERT that require attention and amelioration. Among these are the development of severity-score indices that can be used to explicitly quantify the benefit of ERT. The benefit of this treatment has been slight in Fabry's disease and is yet to be fully shown in the other three disorders. Secondly, novel technologies need to be developed to deliver therapeutic enzymes effectively to tissues such as the cardiac muscle and kidney in Fabry's disease, skeletal muscle in patients with Pompe's disease, and to joint tissues and structures in patients with Hurler's disease and Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome. Finally, an all-encompassing concern is to devise methods to ameliorate the damage to the central and peripheral nervous systems that occurs in specific phenotypes of these disorders. In this review we descibe emerging strategies that seem to be useful in these critical regards.",

        "question": "I.R.I.S. is:",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome o The term \"immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\" (IRIS) describes a collection of inflammatory disorders associated with paradoxical worsening of preexisting infectious processes following the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected individuals. Preexisting infections in individuals with IRIS may have been previously diagnosed and treated or they may be subclinical and later unmasked by the host's regained capacity to mount an inflammatory response.o If immune function improves rapidly following the commencement of HAART, systemic or local inflammatory reactions may occur at the site or sites of the preexisting infection.o This inflammatory> reaction is usually self-limited, especially if the preexisting infection is effectively treated. However, long-term sequelae and fatal outcomes may rarely occur, particularly when neurologic structures are involved.Diagnostic criteria for IRISo There is no universally agreed-upon definition for IRIS. However, it is generally accepted that the diagnosis of IRIS requires the worsening of a recognized (''paradoxical\" IRIS) or unrecognized pre-existing infection (\"unmasking\" IRIS) in the setting of improving immunologic function.Most or all of the following features should be present in order to make the diagnosis:o The presence of AIDS with a low pretreatment CD4 count (often less than 100 cells/microL). One important exception to this general rule is tuberculosis. IRIS secondary to preexisting M. tuberculosis infection may occur in individuals with CD4 counts >200.o A positive virologic and immunological response to ART.o The absence of evidence of drug-resistant infection, bacterial superinfection, drug allergy or other adverse drug reactions, patient noncompliance, or reduced drug levels due to drug-drug interactions or malabsorption after appropriate evaluation for the clinical presentation.o The presence of clinical manifestations consistent with an inflammatory condition.o A temporal association between HAART initiation and the onset of clinical features of illness.Summary and recommendationso The clinical features of each individual case of IRIS are highly variable and data from controlled trials have not been published thus far to provide clear guidelines. Our recommendations are based on clinical experience, case reports, case series, and expert opinion:# Although it is reasonable to perform studies looking for unmasked subclinical opportunistic infection, the diagnosis of IRIS is generally one of exclusion. Investigations to rule out the possibility of drug reaction, patient noncompliance, persistently active infection and/or drug resistance are usually warranted before concluding that IRIS is present.# Most patients with IRIS develop symptoms within one week to a few months after the initiation of HAART. With later onset, other diagnoses become more likely. Abacavir hypersensitivity can be confused with IRIS, but symptoms worsen soon after each dose of abacavir. The diagnostic work-up for abacavir hypersensitivity reaction includes genetic testing for HLA-B5701.# When a diagnosis of IRIS is considered highly likely, further or repeated invasive diagnostic procedures to locate an occult infection may be reasonably delayed, deferred, or altogether avoided.# Treatment for the underlying pathogen should generally be started or continued in patients who develop IRIS. This is particularly important when treating patients with IRIS associated with hepatitis B virus.# Corticosteroids or NSAIDS may help decrease the inflammatory response in some patients with IRIS. The decision to use corticosteroids should be individualized and should take into account the risks of therapy. When we choose to treat with corticosteroids, we initiate therapy with prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (maximal dose 60 to 80 mg) and then taper steroid therapy while monitoring for recurrence of clinical symptoms over the ensuing weeks to months.# For most patients, we suggest initiation of ART within two weeks of starting treatment of the underlying opportunistic infection to decrease the risk of clinical progression of AIDS and death.# For OIs that lack proven effective therapies other than HAART (eg, PML), we believe it is best to treat these patients with HAART despite the risk of an adverse outcome. We normally do not use steroids in such patients unless or until symptoms of IRIS appear.",

The ABO isoagglutinins are responsible for the majority of these reactions, although alloantibodies directed against other RBC antigens, i.e., Rh, Kell, and Duffy, may result in hemolysis.Acute Hemolxtic Transfusion Reactions#Immune-mediated hemolysis occurs when the recipient has preformed antibodies that lyse donor erythrocytes. The ABO isoagglutinins are responsible for the majority of these reactions, although allo antibodies directed against other RBC antigens, i.e., Rh, Kell, and Duffy, may result in hemolysis.#Acute hemolytic reactions may present with hypotension, tachypnea, tachycardia, fever, chills, hemoglobinemia, hemoglobinuria, chest and/or flank pain, and discomfort at the infusion site. Monitoring the patient's vital signs before and during the transfusion is important to identify reactions promptly.#When acute hemolysis is suspected, the transfusion must be stopped immediately, intravenous access maintained, and the reaction reported to the blood bank. A correctly labeled post transfusion blood sample and any non transfused blood should be sent to the blood bank for analysis. The laboratory evaluation for hemolysis includes the measurement of serum haptoglobin, LDH, and indirect bilirubin levels.#The immune complexes that result in RBC lysis can cause renal dysfunction and failure. Diuresis should be induced with intravenous fluids and furosemide or mannitol. Tissue factor released from the lysed erythrocytes may initiate DIC.#Errors at the patient's bedside, such as mislabeling the sample or transfusing the wrong patient, are responsible for the majority of these reactions. The blood bank investigation of these reactions includes examination of the pre- and post transfusion samples for hemolysis and repeat typing of the patient samples; direct antiglobulin test (DAT), sometimes called the direct Coombs test, of the posttransfusion sample; repeating the cross-matching of the blood component; and checking all clerical records for errors.

There is a marked predilection to the axial skeleton, particularly the thoracic spine. It may also involve the peripheral joints.The most characteristic radiographic abnormality of the DISH is calcification and ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament of the spine.The diagnosis is made by spinal radiographs that show \"flowing\" calcifications along the anterior and lateral portion of at least four contiguous vertebral bodies without loss of disc height and without typical radiographic findings of ankylosing spondylitis, (no syndesmophytes).A DISH commonly occurs in men in their fifth to sixth decade of life.Patients are often asymptomatic but may have spinal pain or limited spinal motion.The DISH can be ruled out as in DISH there is no raised ESR and syndesmophytes. (ESR is raised in inflammatory spondyloarthropathies like Ankylosing spondylitis. But DISH and degenerative osteoarthritis are non-inflammatory conditions, so ESR would be normal.)Apley's writes- \"Although DISH bears a superficial resemblance to AS, it is not an inflammatory disease; spinal pain and stiffness are seldom severe, the sacroiliitis joints are not eroded and the ESR is normal.\"Harrison writes- \"Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis which occurs in middle-aged and elderly is usually not symptomatic.\"Degenerative osteoarthritis of the spine:It is a disease of elderly characterized by the formation of large osteophytes along the anterior and lateral aspects of the spine with decreased intervertebral disc spaces.Lumbar canal stenosis:It is ruled out as - Neurogenic claudication or pseudoclaudication is the usual symptom, consisting of back and buttock or leg pain induced by walking or standing and relieved by sitting.It can be congenital (achondroplasia) or acquired in degenerative diseases, trauma, spine surgery, metabolic or endocrine disorders and Paget's disease.Let's compare the options in relation to signs and symptoms of the pt-S/s of the caseAnkylosing spondylitis(AS)Ankylosing hyper osteosis/Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyper osteosis (DISH)Degenerative osteoarthritis of spine/spondylosis deformation65 yrs agoin 5%commoncommon3 months history+insidious long durationinsidious long durationBack pain+++/- (may be asymptomatic)+/- (may be asymptomatic)Marked stiffness++-(Stiffness is mild)|ESR+ inflammatorynon-inflammatorynon-inflammatoryRestriction of chest movements+--Syndesmophytes+\"flowing wax\" like calcification or hyperostoses, no | of intervertebral disc spaceOsteophytes | of intervertebral disc space!

Thus, broad spectrum antibiotics (to treat a variety of possible infections) must be initiated promptly after cultures are obtained. Deferring treatment until culture results are available may result in overwhelming septicemia and death.

        "question": "Which of the following medications is the drug of choice for severe preeclampsia ?",
        "exp": "Ans- A Labetalol Diagnostic Criteria for Preeclampsia- ACOG 2013 ^ Blood pressure * Greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg systolic or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic on two occasions at least 4 hours apart after 20 weeks of gestation in a woman with a previously normal blood pressure * Greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg systolic or greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg diastolic, hypertension can be confirmed within a short interval (minutes) to facilitate timely antihypertensive therapy and Proteinuria * Greater than or equal to 300 mg per 24 hour urine collection (or this amount extrapolated from a timed collection) or * Protein/creatinine ratio greater than or equal to 0.3* * Dipstick reading of 1+ (used only if other quantitative methods not available) Or in the absence of proteinuria, new-onset hypertension with the new onset of any of the following: Thrombocytopenia * Platelet count less than 100,000/microliter Renal insufficiency * Serum creatinine concentrations greater than 1.1 mg/dL or a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration in the absence of other renal disease Impaired liver function * Elevated blood concentrations of liver transaminases to twice normal concentration Pulmonary edema Cerebral or visual symptoms * Each measured as mg/dL The Revised Definition of Preeclampsia According to the new ACOG guidelines, the diagnosis of preeclampsia no longer requires the detection of high levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria). Evidence shows organ problems with the kidneys and livers can occur without signs of protein, and that the amount of protein in the urine does not predict how severely the disease will progress. Prior to this time, most healthcare providers traditionally adhered to a rigid diagnosis of preeclampsia based on blood pressure and protein in the urine(proteinuria). Preeclampsia is now to be diagnosed by persistent high blood pressure that develops during pregnancy or during the postpartum period that is associated with a lot of protein in the urine or the new development of decreased blood platelets, trouble with the kidney or liver, fluid in the lungs, or signs of brain trouble such as seizures and/or visual disturbances. Other Big Changes in Diagnosis and Management Evidence tells us that preeclampsia is a dynamic process. Diagnosing a woman's condition as \"mild preeclampsia\" is not helpful because it is a progressive disease, progressing at different rates in different women. Appropriate care requires frequent re-evaluation for severe features of the disease and appropriate actions outlined in the new guidelines. Mild to moderate high blood pressure (140-159 mm Hg systolic or 90-159 mm Hg diastolic measured on two occasions at least four hours apart) warrants close evaluation and monitoring. High blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg systolic or greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg diastolic is a feature of severe preeclampsia. To prevent eclampsia (seizures), magnesium sulfate should be given if your blood pressure is 160/110 or higher. If your blood pressure is less than 160/110 and you have other severe symptoms that usually precede seizures, you should be given magnesium sulfate. Severe hypertension can be confirmed within a short interval (minutes) to facilitate timely antihypertensive therapy. Guidelines for the timing of delivery have been modified based on data indicating best outcomes for mother and baby. One of the biggest changes in preeclampsia management relates to the timing of delivery in women with preeclampsia without severe features. Studies suggest that the best time of delivery is at 37 weeks of gestation. It has been known for many years that preeclampsia can worsen or become apparent for the first time after delivery. The new guidelines include specific recommendations to improve outcomes for women who have postpartum preeclampsia. Evidence firmly tells us that preeclampsia is associated with later life cardiovascular disease (CVD), and the ACOG report calls for research to learn how to use this information to help patients. A new recommendation is to educate all pregnant and postpartum patients about the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia. The Preeclampsia Foundation advocated for this addition based on the evidence of its own research study that has just been published.",

Pages 1313-7Explanation:MORPHOLOGY OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASECortical atrophy especially in frontal, temporal and parietal lobes.Compensatory ventricular enlargement due to loss of parenchyma and reduced brain volume - (hydrocephalus ex vacuo).Structures involved early - medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala.The major microscopic abnormalities: o Neuritic (senile) plaques.o Neurofibrillary tangles.Progressive severe neuronal loss and reactive gliosis.Neuritic PlaquesFocal, spherical collections of dilated, tortuous, neuritic processes (dystrophic neurites) often around a central amyloid core, surrounded by a clear halo.Size from 20 to 200 mm in diameter.Microglial cells and reactive astrocytes are present at their periphery.Plaques are found in the hippocampus, amygdala, and neocortex.The amyloid core, stained by Congo Red. contains several abnormal proteins.The dominant component of the amyloid plaque core is Ab. a peptide derived from, amyloid precursor protein (APP).Other proteins include:o Components of the complement cascadeo Pro-inflammatory cytokineso al-antichymotrypsino Apolipoproteins.Neurofibrillary TanglesBundles of filaments in the cytoplasm of the neurons that displace or encircle the nucleus.In pyramidal neurons, they have an elongated \"flame\" shape: in rounder cells, the basket weave of fibers around the nucleus takes a rounded contour (\"globose\" tangles).H&E staining: Basophilic fibrillar structures.Very well demonstrated by silver (Bielschowsky) staining.They are commonly found in cortical neurons, especially in the entorhinal cortex, pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, the amygdala, the basal forebrain, and the raphe nuclei. They are insoluble and resistant to clearance remaining visible in tissue sections as \"ghost\" or \"tombstone\" tangles long after the death of the parent neuron.Ultrastructurally, they are composed of paired helical filaments along with some straight filaments.A major component of paired helical filaments is abnormally hyperphosphorylated forms of the protein tau. an axonal microtubule-associated protein that enhances microtubule assembly.Other components include MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein-2) and ubiquitin.Paired helical filaments are also found in the dystrophic neurites that form the outer portions of neuritic plaques and in axons coursing through the affected gray matter as neuropil threads.Other FeaturesCerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA).Granulovacuolar degeneration: Small (~5 mm in diameter), clear intraneuronal cytoplasmic vacuoles, each of which contains an argyrophilic granule.Hirano bodies are elongated, glassy, eosinophilic bodies consisting of paracrystalline arrays of beaded filaments, with actin as their major component, found most commonly within hippocampal pyramidal cells.Pathologic changes are evident earliest in the entorhinal cortex, then spread through the hippocampal formation and isocortex, and then extend into the neocortex.NIA-Reagan criteria used in the diagnosis.Remember:Amyloid plaques - Extracellular IJ amyloid.Neurofibrillary tangles - Intracellular tau proteins.",

On routine X-ray, a mass was seen in the right apical region of the lung. A biopsy was taken from the mass. Most likely diagnosis on the basis of description is malignant mesothelioma. Numerous long, slender microvilli will be seen on electron microscopy in malignant mesothelioma. (AllMS November 2013 repeat)Diagnosis depends on a constellation of findings, including the history of asbestos exposure, clinical signs and symptoms, radiographic findings, histopathological features, and immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies. On electron microscopy, the presence of long microvilli and abundant tonofilaments but absent microvillous rootlets and lamella bodies favor the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. Electron microscopy (ultrastructural examination) has been accepted for many years as the 'gold standard' for the diagnosis of mesothelioma. Mesothelioma cells are characterized by a profusion of markedly elongated surface microvilli in the absence of secretory cytoplasmic granules. Robbin's 8/e p734Mesotheliomas:Most specific neoplasm associated with asbestosisMay develop 1-2 years after exposure, but incidence peaks at 20-35 years of exposureShows strong male predilection (3:1)Diagnosis depends on a constellation of findings, including the history of asbestos exposure, clinical signs and symptoms, radiographic findings, histopathological features, and immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies.On electron microscopy, the presence of long microvilli and abundant tonofilaments but absent microvillous rootlets and lamella bodies favor the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma.Pathological Features of Malignant MesotheliomaMalignant mesothelioma is a diffuse lesion that spreads widely in the pleural spaceUsually associated with extensive pleural effusion and direct invasion of thoracic structures.The affected lung becomes ensheathed by a thick layer of soft, gelatinous, grayish pink tumor tissue.Microscopically, malignant mesotheliomas may be epithelioid (60%), sarcomatoid (20%), or mixed (20%).Epithelioid mesotheliomaEpithelioid mesothelioma may at times be difficult to differentiate grossly and histologically from pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Features that favor mesothelioma includes:Positive staining for acid mucopolysaccharide, which is inhibited by previous digestion by hyaluronidaseLack of staining for CEA and other epithelial glycoprotein antigens, markers that are generally expressed by adenocarcinomaStrong staining for keratin proteins, with accentuation of perinuclear rather than peripheral stainingPositive staining for calretinin, Wilms tumor 1 (WT-1), cytokeratin 5/6, and D2-40On electron microscopy. the presence of Iona microvilli and abundant tonofilaments but absent microvillous rootlets and lamellar bodies.The mesenchymal type of mesothelioma appears as a spindle cell sarcoma, resembling fibrosarcoma (sarcomatoid type).The mixed type of mesothelioma contains both epithelioid and sarcomatoid patterns.

Bleeding Bleeding in Meckel's diverticulum is usually the result of ulceration in ileal mucosa adjacent to the diverticulum caused by the acid secreted by heterotopic gastric mucosa within the diverticulum. Intestinal obstruction Intestinal obstruction associated with Meckel's diverticulum can result from several mechanisms. Volvulus of the intestine around the fibrous band attaching the diverticulum to the umbilicus. Intussusception with the diverticulum acting as the lead point. Entrapment of intestine by a mesodiverticular band (mesodiverticular band is a remnant of the left vitelline artery, it tethers the Meckel's diverticulum to the ileal mesentery;.) Stricture secondary to chronic diverticulitis. 3) Diverticulitis The clinical picture is similar to appendicitis. Diverticulitis may lead to perforation. o Littre's hernia - Rarely Meckel's diverticulum is found in inguinal or a femoral hernia. This is known as Lit (re's hernia. o Diagnostic studies Meckel's diverticulum in the absence of bleeding can be rarely diagnosed before surgical intervention. Barium meal follow through can rarely demonstrate the diverticulum. Barium enteroclysis can demonstrate the diverticula in 75% of cases but is avoided during the acute presentation of complication. If repeated episodes of lower GI bleed occur and an ectopic gastric mucosa in the Meckel's diverticulum is suspected, it can be demonstrated by Technetium\"pertechnate radionuclide scan.

        "question": "Major criteria for rheumatic fever - includes All except",
        "exp": "Ans- B Increased ESR & CRP Ref- The famous Jones criteria for diagnosis of Acure Rhemaric Fever are recently revised in 2015 by AHA with emphasis on doppler echocardiogarphy for involvement of heart. It is the first substantial revision to the Jones Criteria by the American Heart Association since 1992. It is technology driven (ECHO) and focuses on epidemiological differences in high-risk and low-risk populations. This is a effort to summarize important points for Pediatric post graduates exams. link to article : Here (For any discrepancy refer original Article) Epidemiological Background 1. During the 20th century, the incidence of ARF and the prevalence of RHD declined substantially in Europe, North America, and developed nations. 2. Attributed to improved hygiene, improved access to antibiotic drugs and medical care, reduced household crowding, and other social and economic changes. 3. However, in developing countries the incidence remains high. In summary, the global distribution of ARF/RHD is clearly disproportionate. As per epidemiological data, cases are divided into: Low risk should be defined as having an ARF incidence <2 per 100 000 school-aged children (usually 5-14 years old) per year. Or an allege prevalence of RHD of <=1 per 1000 population per year. Children not clearly from a low-risk population are at moderate to high risk depending on their reference population. Revised Jones Criteria A. Diagnosis For all patient populations with evidence of preceding GAS infection initial ARF - 2 Major or 1 major plus 2 minor recurrent ARF - 2 Major or 1 major and 2 minor or 3 minor B. What are Major criteria ? C. What are the Minor criteria Evidence of Preceding Streptococcal Infection \" Laboratory evidence of antecedent group A streptococcal infection is needed whenever possible, and the diagnosis is in doubt when such evidence is not available \" Exceptions include chorea, chronic, indolent rheumatic carditis with insidious onset and slow progression. This latter problem refers to patients without an identifiable history of ARF who have had subclinical carditis that was not detected previously. Interpretation of streptococcal serology results can be difficult in populations with endemic skin or upper respiratory group A streptococcal infections. In these settings, a negative streptococcal antibody test helps to exclude a recent infection, but a positive test does not necessarily indicate an infection in the past few months. Any 1 of the following can serve as evidence of preceding infection, per a recent AHA statement : 1. Increased or rising anti-streptolysin O titer or other streptococcal antibodies (anti-DNASE B). A rise in titer is better evidence than a single titer result. 2. A positive throat culture for group A b-hemolytic streptococci. 3. A positive rapid group A streptococcal carbohydrate antigen test in a child whose clinical presentation suggests a high pretest probability of streptococcal pharyngItis. Clinical Manifestations of ARF 1. Generally, the clinical profile of ARF in low- and middle-income countries closely resembles that of high-income countries. 2. Most common major manifestations during the first episode of ARF remain carditis (50%-70%) and arthritis (35%-66%). 3. These are followed in frequency by chorea (10%-30%), which has been demonstrated to have a female predominance, and then subcutaneous nodules (0%-10%) and erythema marginatum (<6%), which remain much less common but highly specific manifestations of ARF. However in very high-risk populations, such as the indigenous Australian population, variability in typical Jones criteria manifestations has been described. As discussed below, these include presentations with 1. aseptic monoarthritis 2. polyarthralgia and 3. low-grade (as opposed to traditionally considered high-grade) fevers. 1. Carditis 1. As per 1992 AHA revised Jones criteria statement, carditis as a major manifestation of ARF was mostly a clinical diagnosis based on the auscultation of typical murmurs that indicate MR or AR, at either or both valves. (Valvulitis is by far the most consistent feature of ARF, and isolated pericarditis or myocarditis should rarely, if ever, be considered rheumatic in origin.) 2. With declining auscultatory skills and widespread use of ECHO, the concept of subclinical carditis has become incorporated into other guidelines and consensus statements as a valid rheumatic fever major manifestation. 3. Subclinical carditis refers exclusively to the circumstance in which classic auscultatory findings of valvar dysfunction either are not present or are not recognized by the diagnosing clinician but Doppler studies reveal mitral or aortic valvulitis. 4. Specific Doppler Findings in Rheumatic Valvullitis and Morphological Findings on Echocardiogram in Rheumatic Valvulitis (both acute and chronic) are distinctly defined in the guidelines. Additional recommendations include: 1. Echocardiography with Doppler should be performed in all cases of confirmed and suspected ARF. 2. Reasonable to consider performing serial echocardiography/Doppler studies in any patient with diagnosed or suspected ARF even if documented carditis is not present on diagnosis. 3. Echocardiography/Doppler testing should be performed (strictly fulfilling the findings defined) to assess whether carditis is present in the absence of auscultatory findings, particularly in moderate- to high-risk populations and when ARF is considered likely. 4. Echocardiography/Doppler findings not consistent with carditis should exclude that diagnosis in patients with a heart murmur otherwise thought to indicate rheumatic carditis. 2. Arthritis 1. Migratory polyarthritis 2. Most frequently involved are larger ones, including knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists. Involvement of small joints of the hands and feet and the spine is much less common in ARF than in other arthritic illnesses. 3. Rapid improvement with salicylates or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is characteristic. 4. Self-limited course, even without therapy, lasting [?]4 weeks. 5. No long-term joint deformity. Aseptic Monoarthritis Studies from India, Australia, and Fiji have indicated that aseptic monoarthritis may be important as a clinical manifestation of ARF in selected high-risk populations. Polyarthralgia Polyarthralgia is a very common, highly nonspecific manifestation of a number of rheumatologic disorders. No compelling evidence to amend this conclusion in low risk. But Children with polyarthralgia are more likely to have ARF if they come from a population with a high incidence population. Therefore, it is minor criteria for low risk, major for high risk! Chorea (Sydenham Chorea) 1. Purposeless, involuntary, nonstereotypical movements of the trunk or extremities. 2. Associated with muscle weakness and emotional lability. Skin Findings 1.Erythema marginatum. a. Unique, evanescent, pink rash seen with pale centers and rounded or serpiginous margins. b. Usually is present on the trunk and proximal extremities and is not facial. Heat can induce its appearance, and it blanches with pressure. Harder to detect in dark-skinned individuals. 2. Subcutaneous nodules 1. Firm, painless protuberances found on extensor surfaces at specific joints, including the knees, elbows, and wrists, and occiput and along the spinous processes vertebrae. Common in those who also have carditis, and as with erythema marginatum, subcutaneous nodules almost never occur as the sole major manifestation of ARF. Rheumatic Fever Recurrences As stated in the 1992 guidelines, patients who have a history of ARF or RHD are at high risk for \"recurrent\" attacks if reinfected with group A streptococci. \"Possible\" Rheumatic Fever A given clinical presentation may not fulfill these updated Jones criteria, but the clinician may still have good reason to suspect that ARF is the diagnosis. This may occur in high-incidence settings. In such situations, clinicians should use their discretion and clinical acumen to make the diagnosis that they consider most likely and manage the patient accordingly. AHA recommendations for management of ''possible'' rheumatic fever are: 1. In genuine uncertainty, 12 months of secondary prophylaxis followed by reevaluation including careful history and physical examination with repeat echo. 2. In recurrent symptoms (particularly involving the joints) who has been adherent to prophylaxis recommendations but lacks serological evidence of group A streptococcal infection and lacks echo evidence of valvulitis, it is reasonable to conclude that the recurrent symptoms are not likely related to ARF, and discontinuation of antibiotic prophylaxis may be appropriate.",

Operations for stress incontinence resulting from intrinsic sphincteric weakness or dysfunction (sling operations and periurethral injections). d.

Sling Operations: a. After reviewing reports that included patient follow-up for more than 48 months, the American Urological Association and the Female Stress Urinary Incontinence Guidelines Panel concluded that the two most effective surgical treatments for stress incontinence are retropubic bladder neck suspensions and sling procedures. b. This panel confirmed that the use of sling operations in women with complex or recurrent stress urinary incontinence is a safe and effective treatment. II. Anterior Colporrhaphy Anterior vaginal repair is the oldest operation for stress incontinence in gynecology. It was described by Howard Kelly in 1914. He believed that stress incontinence was caused by an open vesical neck rather than from loss of urethral support, and he designed an operation to cure this condition by pulling the bladder neck closed using periurethral Kelly plication sutures. The problem with most techniques of anterior colporrhaphy is that they do not hold up well over time. Most surgical series that have evaluated techniques of anterior colporrhaphy for stress incontinence show long-term success rates of only 35% to 65%, a figure that most would regard as unacceptably low. Anterior colporrhaphy should be reserved primarily for patients requiring cystocele repair who do not have significant stress incontinence.",

        "exp": "Ans- C Staph aureus Ref- Causative Organism(s) Clinical Features of IE Staphylococcus aureus Overall, S aureus infection is the most common cause of IE, including PVE, acute IE, and IVDA IE. Approximately 35-60.5% of staphylococcal bacteremias are complicated by IE. More than half the cases are not associated with underlying valvular disease. The mortality rate of S aureus IE is 40-50%. S aureus infection is the second most common cause of nosocomial BSIs, second only to CoNS infection. The incidence of MRSA infections, both the hospital- and community-acquired varieties, has dramatically increased (50% of isolates). Sixty percent of individuals are intermittent carriers of MRSA or MSSA. The primary risk factor for S aureus BSI is the presence of intravascular lines. Other risk factors include cancer, diabetes, corticosteroid use, IVDA, alcoholism, and renal failure. The realization that approximately 50% of hospital- and community-acquired staphylococcal bacteremias arise from infected vascular catheters has led to the reclassification of staphylococcal BSIs. BSIs are acquired not only in the hospital but also in any type of health care facility (eg, nursing home, dialysis center). Of S aureus bacteremia cases in the United States, 7.8% (200,000) per year are associated with intravascular catheters. Streptococcus viridans This organism accounts for approximately 50-60% of cases of subacute disease. Most clinical signs and symptoms are mediated immunologically. Streptococcus intermedius group These infections may be acute or subacute. S intermedius infection accounts for 15% of streptococcal IE cases. Members of the S intermedius group, especially S anginosus, are unique among the streptococci in that they can actively invade tissue and form abscesses, often in the CNS. Abiotrophia Approximately 5% of subacute cases of IE are due to infection with Abiotrophia species. They require metabolically active forms of vitamin B-6 for growth. This type of IE is associated with large vegetations that lead to embolization and a high rate of posttreatment relapse. Group D streptococci Most cases are subacute. The source is the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. It is the third most common cause of IE. They pose major resistance problems for antibiotics. Nonenterococcal group D The clinical course is subacute. Infection often reflects underlying abnormalities of the large bowel (eg, ulcerative colitis, polyps, cancer). The organisms are sensitive to penicillin. Group B streptococci Acute disease develops in pregnant patients and older patients with underlying diseases (eg, cancer, diabetes, alcoholism). The mortality rate is 40%. Complications include metastatic infection, arterial thrombi, and congestive heart failure. It often requires valve replacement for cure. Group A, C, and G streptococci Acute disease resembles that of S aureus IE (30-70% mortality rate), with suppurative complications. Group A organisms respond to penicillin alone. Group C and G organisms require a combination of synergistic antibiotics (as with enterococci). Coagulase-negative S aureus This causes subacute disease. It behaves similarly to S viridans infection. It accounts for approximately 30% of PVE cases and less than 5% of NVE cases. Staphylococcus lugdunensis Staphylococcus lugdunensis is another coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species but is extremely aggressive compared to coagulase-positive S aureus. S lugdunensis frequently causes IE. Pseudomonas aeruginosa This is usually acute, except when it involves the right side of the heart in IVDA IE. Surgery is commonly required for cure. HACEK (ie, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Kingella kingae) These organisms usually cause subacute disease. They account for approximately 5% of IE cases. They are the most common gram-negative organisms isolated from patients with IE. Complications may include massive arterial emboli and congestive heart failure. Cure requires ampicillin, gentamicin, and surgery. Fungal These usually cause subacute disease. The most common organism of both fungal NVE and fungal PVE is Candida albicans. Fungal IVDA IE is usually caused by Candida parapsilosis or Candida tropicalis. Aspergillus species are observed in fungal PVE and NIE. Bartonella The most commonly involved species is Bartonella quintana. IE typically develops in homeless males who have extremely substandard hygiene. Bartonella must be considered in cases of culture-negative endocarditis among homeless individuals. Multiple pathogens (polymicrobial) Pseudomonas and enterococci are the most common combination of organisms. It is observed in cases of IVDA IE The cardiac surgery mortality rate is twice that associated with single-agent IE.",

These two blood groups do not have the 'B' antigen on the RBCs)This is not the case with other blood groups. Preformed antibodies are not present.

Page S885Explanation:\"A heart rate less than 60 beats/min with poor perfusion is an indication to begin chest compressions.\" Ref: NelsonThe child has acute respiratory failure hypopnea (RR-5/min and cyanosis). So the first step would be to secure an airway by intubation followed by ventilation with CL.The child does not have active seizures at presentation. So diazepam or IV midazolam may not be required immediately but should be given after the child is stabilized.BRADYCARDIASymptomatic bradycardia occurs most often in the setting of hypoxia but can also be caused by hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, other electrolyte abnormalities, and intracranial hypertension.Initial management of symptomatic bradycardia includes support or opening of the airway and confirming or establishing adequate oxygenation and ventilation.After the child's breathing has been secured, the child should be reassessed for continued bradycardia and poor perfusion--if a cardiac compromise was solely the result of respiratory insufficiency, support of the child's airway and breathing may have been sufficient to restore normal hemodynamics.If respiratory support does not correct the perfusion abnormalities, then further care is based on the quality of perfusion and the degree of bradycardia.A heart rate less than 60 beats/min w ith poor perfusion is an indication to begin chest compressions.In Our Case:Child has presented after seizures and is not havingactive seizures at present.Problems are:Hypoapnea (RR - 6 min).Bradycardia (HR - 66 min).Cyanosiso All these features are indicative of acute respiratory failure.o Bradycardia is secondary to hypoxia due to respiratory insufficiencyo At this stage the next step would be to ventilate the child (either by hag and mask followed by endotracheal intubation or directly intubating the child).Chest compressions are indicated when HR < 60 beats/min.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., Vision o Transducin is a G protein which is involved in transmission of visual signals.o Both the rods and the cones release glutamate at their synapses with the bipolar cells.o The mechanism of signal tranduction, i.e., the process by which light is converted into electrical signal (nerve impulse), is almost similar in both rods and conesQo But both photoreceptors have differences with other sensory receptors.o The photoreceptors do not behave like other receptors when exposed to their stimulus : they are hyperpolarized instead of depolarized.o The photoreceptor cell has a membrane potential of - 40 mV.o The photoreceptors cell are in depolarized state in the dark.o It is due to Na+ channels in outer segment, which are open in dark state which allow influx of Na+ and depolarization,o Therefore, a steady state of neurotransmitter (glutamateQ) is released from photoreceptors.o In light photoactivation of the opsin is accompanied by a conformational change, which in turn brings about a similar change in a membrane protein, transducinQ, in the plasma membrane of outer segment,o Transducin is a member of G-proteins which activates phosphodiesterase and decreases intracellular cGMP due to degradation by cGMP.o Decrease in cGMP causes closure of Na+ channels (cGMP keeps Na+ channels open in outer segment) and hyperpolarization.o Phototransduction is thus a unique example of sensory transduction that is associated with hyperpolarizationQ and a reduction in neurotransmitter release from the sensory receptor (all other sensory receptors develop depolarization/hypopolarization in response to stimulus),o Unlike other receptors, photoreceptors (and bipolar) cells do not produce an action potential but only a graded changes of the membrane potential (hyperpolarizing local graded potential).o Because the distance is very short from the outer segment-where the membrane potential changes are produced-to the synapses between the photoreceptors and the bipolar cells, even small fluctuations of the membrane potential cause alterations of the transmitter release from the photoreceptors,o There is thus no need for the production of action potentials, which are important when signals are to be propagated over long distances.o In contrast to the photoreceptors and the bipolars, the ganglion cells produce action potentials (conducted in the optic nerve to the higher visual centres).",

        "exp": "Ans- B Ref- Clinical manifestations Due to the lack of typical symptoms and signs, early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) is often neglected by patients and typically found during physical examination or breast cancer screening. The typical signs of breast cancer, as listed below, usually occur in the more advanced stages. 2.1.1. Breast Mass About 80% of breast cancer cases were first diagnosed with breast masses. Patients often recognize their breast mass unintentionally, and the mass tends to be single and hard, with irregular margins and less smooth surface. Most breast cancers are manifested as a painless mass, and only a few had varied degrees of pain or tingling. 2.1.2. Nipple discharge Nipple discharge can be sanguineous (bloody), serous, mucinous, milky, or purulent. It can also occur half year after the termination of breastfeeding. Causes for nipple discharge vary but commonly include intraductal papilloma, breast hyperplasia, dilation of mammary duct, and breast cancer. The bloody discharge which is effused from unilateral single hole should be further examined; more attention should be paid if the nipple discharge is accompanied with breast mass. 2.1.3. Skin changes A variety of skin changes can occur in patients with breast cancer. Most commonly, the tumor invades the Cooper's ligament and then adheres to the skin, showing a \"Dimple sign\". When the cancer cells block the lymphatic vessels, an orange peel like texture of the skin occurs. In patients with advanced breast cancer, the cancer cells can infiltrate into the skin along the lymphatic vessels, glandular vessels, and/or fibrous tissue, and then proliferate to form satellite nodules of skin over breast. 2.1.4. Abnormalities of nipple and areola If the tumor is located deep inside nipple, it can cause the retraction of nipple. In some patients, although tumor is relatively far away from the nipple, it can invade and shrink the large ducts within the mammary gland, and thus cause the retraction or elevation of nipple. Eczematoid carcinoma of nipple, also known as Paget's disease, is clinically manifested as the itchy nipple, erosion, ulceration, crusting, scaling, which can be associated with causalgia; in addition, nipple retraction also can be found. 2.1.5. Axillary lymphadenectasis In patients with occult breast cancer, the mass usually is impalpable during physical examination, with axillary lymphadenectasis as the first symptom. The metastasis of axillary lymph node can be detected in one third or more inpatients. The ipsilateral axillary lymph node(s) may become swollen at the early stage, and some swollen lymph nodes can hard, scattered, and movable. With the progression of the disease, the lymph nodes fuse together gradually and adhere to and even fix with the skin and surrounding tissues. The metastatic lymph nodes can be palpable in the supraclavicular area or contralateral axilla in patients with advanced breast cancer. ]More on Ca Breast- TNM staging of breast cancer B.1 Primary tumor (T) The clinical and pathological definitions for the stages of primary tumors are same. If the size of a tumor is assessed during physical examination, it can be presented as T1, T2, or T3. When other measurements (such as mammography or pathology) are applied, the four subgroups of T1 can be used. The size of tumor is accurate to 0.1 cm. TX means that the tumor size cannot be assessed. T0: No evidence of primary tumor. Tis: Carcinoma in situ. Tis ductal carcinoma in situ Tis lobular carcinoma in situ Tis Paget's disease of the nipple with no associated tumor. Note: Paget's disease associated with a tumor is classified according to the size of the tumor. T1: Tumor 2.0 cm or less in greatest dimension T1mic: Microinvasion 0.1 cm or less in greatest dimension; T1a: Tumor more than 0.1 cm but not more than 0.5 cm in greatest dimension; T1b: Tumor more than 0.5 cm but not more than 1.0 cm in greatest dimension; T1c: Tumor more than 1.0 cm but not more than 2.0 cm in greatest dimension; T2: Tumor more than 2.0 cm but not more than 5.0 cm in greatest dimension; T3: Tumor more than 5.0 cm in greatest dimension; T4: Tumor of any size with direct extension to (a) chest wall or (b) skin. T4a: Extension to chest wall; T4b: Edema (including peau d'orange) or ulceration of the skin of the breast or satellite skin nodules confined to the same breast; T4c: Both of the above (T4a and T4b); T4d: Inflammatory carcinoma. B.2 Regional lymph nodes (N) Clinical NX: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (e.g., previously removed); N0: No regional lymph node metastasis; N1: Metastasis to movable ipsilateral axillary lymph node(s); N2: Metastases in ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes that are clinically fixed or matted; or,metastases in clinically detected ipsilateral internal mammary nodes in the absence of clinically evident* axillary lymph node metastases. N2a: Metastases in ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes fixed to one another (matted) or to other structures. N2b: Metastases only in clinically detected ipsilateral internal mammary nodes and in the absence of clinically evident axillary lymph node metastases. N3: Metastases in ipsilateral infraclavicular lymph node(s) with or without axillary lymph node involvement; or, metastases in clinically detected ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node(s) with clinically evident* axillary lymph node metastases; or, metastases in ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node(s) with or without axillary or internal mammary lymph node involvement. N3a: Metastases in ipsilateral infraclavicular lymph node(s). N3b: Metastases in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node(s) and axillary lymph node(s). N3c: Metastases in ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node(s). B.3 Distant Metastases (M) MX: Distant metastasis can not be assessed. M0: No distant metastasis M1: Distant metastasis.

Jaw claudication may result from low flow in the external carotid branches.Vertebrobasilar Ischemic attacks are characterized by vertigo, ataxia, diplopia, dysarthria, dimness or blurring of vision, perioral numbness and paresthesias, and weakness or sensory complaints on one, both, or alternating sides of the body.Also Note:Drop attacks due to bilateral leg weakness, without headache or loss of consciousness, may occur, sometimes in relation to head movements.",

Membranous glomerulopathy (Membranous nephropathy) Membranous glomerulopathy is the most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome in adults. It is characterized by diffuse thickening of the glomerular capillary wall and the accumulation of electron-dense, immunoglobulin-containing deposits along the subepithelial side of the basement membrane. The most notable such associations are as follows: Drugs (penicillamine, captopril, gold, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ) Underlying malignant tumors, particularly carcinoma of the lung and colon and melanoma. SLE. Infections (chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, schistosomiasis, malaria) Other autoimmune disorders, such as thyroiditis Minimal change disease (Lipoid nephrosis) This relatively benign disorder is the most frequent cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. It is characterized by diffuse effacement of foot processes of epithelial cells in glomeruli that appear virtually normal by light microscopy. Its most characteristic feature is its usually dramatic response to corticosteroid therapy. Fig: ABS showing effacement of foot process. Ref: Weber S, Gribouval O, Esquivel EL et al. NPHS2 mutation analysis shows genetic heterogeneity of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome and low post-transplant recurrence. Kidney Int 2004; 66: 571-579 Focal segmental Glomerulosclerosis This lesion is characterized by sclerosis of some, but not all, glomeruli (Thus, it is focal); and in the affected glomeruli, only a portion of the capillary tuft is involved (thus, it is segmental). In association with other known conditions, such as HIV infection (HIV nephropathy), heroin addiction (heroin nephropathy), sickle cell disease and massive obesity. Reflux nephropathy, hypertensive nephropathy, or with unilateral renal agenesis. As a primary disease (idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) HIV-associated nephropathy Most commonly, a severe form of the collapsing variant of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis Primary MPGN is divided into two major types on the basis of distinct ultrastructural, immunofluorescent, and pathologic findings: type I and type II MPGN (dense-deposit disease). Type I & II MPGN differ in their ultrastructural and immunofluorescent features. Type I MPGN (the great majority of cases) is characterized by the presence of subendothelial electron-dense deposits.) In dense-deposit disease (type II MPGN) a relatively rare entity, the lamina densa of the GBM is transformed into an irregular, ribbon-like, extremely electron-dense structure because of the deposition of dense material of unknown composition. Pathogenesis: In most cases of type I MPGN there is evidence of immune complexes in the glomerulus and activation of both classical and alternative complement pathways. Q Secondary MPGN: Secondary MPGN (invariably type I) is more common in adults and arises in the following settings. Chronic immune complex disorders, such as SLE; hepatitis B infection; hepatitis C infection, usually with cryoglobulinemia; endocarditis; infected ventriculoatrial shunts; chronic visceral abscesses; HIV infection; and schistosomiasis. Alpha1-Antitrypsin deficiency Malignant disease (chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma) Hereditary deficiencies of complement regulatory proteins. IgA nephropathy (Berger disease) This form of glomerulonephritis is characterized by the presence of prominent IgA deposits in the mesangial regions, detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. Figure : The alternative complement pathway. Note that C3NeF, present in the serum of patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, acts at the same step as properdin, serving to stabilize the alternative pathway C3 convertase, thus enhancing C3 breakdown and causing hypocomplementemia. Q Hereditary syndromes of isolated hematuria: Hereditary nephritis refers to a group of heterogeneous familial renal disease associated primary with glomerular injury. Alport syndrome: Alport syndrome, when fully developed, is manifest by nephritis progressing o chronic renal failure, accompanied by nerve deafness and various eye disorders, including lens dislocation, posterior cataracts, and corneal dystrophy. In the mos common X-linked form, males express the full syndrome, and females are carriers in whom manifestations of disease are typically limited to hematuria. Q Rare autosomal-recessive and autosomal-dominant pedigrees also exist, in which males and females are equally susceptible to the full syndrome.Q Morphology: The characteristic findings of fully developed disease are seen with the electron microscope and are found in most patients with hereditary nephritis. The GBM shows irregular foci of thickening alternating with attenuation (thinning), with pronounced splitting and lamination of the lamina densa, often with a distinctive basket-weave appearance.. Q Immunohistochemistry can be helpful in cases with absent or borderline basement membrane lesions, because antibodies to alpha3, alpha4, and alpha5 collagen fail to stain both glomerular and tubular basement membranes in the classic X-linked form. Q There is also absence of alpha5 staining in skin biopsy specimens. Pathogenesis. Defective GBM synthesis because of the production of abnormal collagen type IV underlies the renal lesions. In patients with X-linked disease, the defect is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the alpha5-chain of collagen type IV (COL4A5), a component of the GBM. Thin Basement membrane disease (Benign Familial Hematuria) This is a fairly common entity manifested clinically by familial asymptomatic hematuria - usually uncovered on routine urinalysis. Morphologically by diffuse thinning of the GBM to between 150 and 250 nm (compared with 300 to 400 nm in normal adult individuals) although mild or moderate proteinuria may also be present, renal function is normal and prognosis is excellent.

        "exp": "Ans-C Ref- Definitions Symphysiotomy: is division of the symphysis pubis with a scalpel. Pubiotomy: is division of the pubic ramus half an inch from the symphysis pubis with a Gigli saw to avoid injury to the urethra and bladder. It is out of modern obstetrics due to higher incidence of pubic pain and infection. Indications It is particularly indicated in women living in distant areas where caesarean section cannot be done and even patient will be left with a caesarean scar is in a high risk of rupture in the next labour. As symphysiotomy gives a permanent increase of the pelvic capacity, it can be an alternative to C.S. and indicated in the following conditions: Moderate cephalopelvic disproportion. Contracted outlet in funnel shaped pelvis. Retained aftercoming head in breech delivery failed to be delivered by other means. Shoulder dystocia with a living foetus cannot be delivered by other means. Procedure Subcutaneous symphysiotomy is the commonly done operation and done as follow: A firm catheter is applied and the urethra is displaced to one side with two fingers in the vagina. A 1-2 cm vertical suprapubic incision is made with a scalpel just above the symphysis. The scalpel is introduced through the incision to the upper border of the symphysis with its sharp edge facing anteriorly i.e. towards the operator. The joint is gradually divided by a rocking motion, checking with the vaginal fingers for posterior perforation of the joint capsule. Complete division is rarely, if ever,required. The thighs are held by assistants so that abduction and joint separation can be controlled. A large episiotomy is required to minimise strain on the soft tissue anteriorly. Forceps or preferably, ventouse is used to deliver the foetus. The skin incision is closed by one or two sutures. Postoperative Rest for 2 weeks. A tight binder of \"Elastoplast\" is strapped around the pelvic girdle and hips. Bladder drainage is continued for 3-4 days. A prophylactic antibiotic may be given. Complications Haemorrhage, compression for few minutes usually stop it. Injury to the urethra or bladder. Vesico-vaginal or urethro-vaginal fistula. Stress incontinence. Sepsis. Pelvic osteoarthropathy. Difficulty of walking and unstable pelvis usually improved by time.",

Summary Fracture type ED management Follow-up Middle third (most common) Broad arm sling to support limb for 2 weeks or until comfortable. No evidence to support Figure of 8 bandage or brace If age >12 years and shortened >2 cm refer to orthopaedics for opinion Give parent fracture of the clavicle (collarbone) fact sheet. Advise to give regular analgesia as required If <11 years and undisplaced, follow-up by a GP or fracture clinic is usually not required. Repeat x-rays are usually not required If displaced or >=11 years, follow up with GP or fracture clinic in 1 week Lateral third Broad arm sling to support limb for 2 weeks or until comfortable. No evidence to support Figure of 8 bandage or brace If displaced, refer to the nearest orthopaedic service on call Fracture clinic in 5-7 days with x-ray Medial third If displaced, urgent referral to the nearest orthopaedic on call service To be arranged by orthopaedic service 2. How are they classified? Fractures of the clavicle can be classified by its anatomical location (Table 1): Table 1: Classification of clavicle fractures by location. Location Frequency Description Lateral third 15% Around and lateral to coracoclavicular ligaments Middle third or midshaft 80% Defined by shortening/comminution/angulation Medial third 5% Bony injury alone Associated with sternoclavicular dislocation (may be a physeal sleeve separation) 3. How common are they and how do they occur? The clavicle is one of the most common fractured bones in children. It is the most common perinatal fracture associated with birth trauma. Half of all paediatric clavicle fractures occur under the age of seven years. These heal quickly and recover fully. Injuries are usually the result of a fall on an outstretched hand with the force transmitted up the arm. A direct blow to the outer end of the clavicle (such as a fall onto the point of the shoulder during sporting activities or a striking injury) can be associated with distal third injuries and acromioclavicular joint disruption. 4. What do they look like - clinically? Most present with pain, swelling and deformity along the line of the clavicle, and a history of a fall. Toddlers and infants may present having been observed not using the arm, without a witnessed trauma. Fractures of the medial third are usually the result of direct trauma to the anterior chest (such as in a motor vehicle accident), and can be associated with neurovascular, pulmonary and cardiac (rare) injuries. Careful airway protection and neurovascular assessment is required. All fractures should be assessed using the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) principles to ensure associated and potentially significant injuries are identified. ! Careful neurological examination should be performed to define potential (but rare) associated brachial plexus injury. Vascular assessment of the arm should also be performed as the subclavian artery runs closely apposed to the clavicle in the middle third. 5. What radiological investigations should be ordered? Standard anteroposterior (AP) and AP with 15 degrees cephalic tilt x-ray of the clavicle will show the fracture in two planes and define displacement. A CT scan may be required for medial third injuries with sternoclavicular dislocation to assess tracheal impingement and thoracic anatomy. 6. What do they look like on x-ray? Middle third fracture Figure 1: Seven year old boy with fracture of the middle third of the clavicle. Lateral third Figure 2: Undisplaced lateral third fracture of the clavicle in a 12 year old boy. Sternoclavicular dislocation (posterior displaced) A B Figure 3: A) 14 year old with posterior dislocation of the medial end of right clavicle. This is difficult to see on x-ray. B) The posterior dislocation (red arrow) is more evident on CT scan. 7. When is reduction (non operative and operative) required? Reduction of the middle third is almost never required. Manipulation can lead to neurovascular injury. Displaced lateral and medial third fractures require orthopedic referral for assessment. Open fractures, severely displaced fractures with skin at risk, or fractures with neurovascular injury may require surgical reduction and fixation. These should be referred to the orthopaedic service as a matter of urgency. 8. Do I need to refer to orthopaedics now? The majority of clavicle fractures are easily managed with a sling and analgesia. Indications for prompt consultation include: Severely comminuted or shortened middle third (>2 cm if over 12 years of age) Open fractures Displaced medial third fractures Neurovascular injury with fracture Skin at risk over fracture Displaced lateral third fractures Pathological fractures Congenital pseudoathrosis of clavicle - multiple previous fractures in same location 9. What is the usual ED management for this fracture? Fracture type Type of reduction Immobilisation method & duration Middle third No reduction required Broad arm sling to support limb for 2 weeks or until comfortable No evidence to support Figure of 8 bandage or brace Regular analgesia as required Lateral third If undisplaced, no reduction required If displaced, refer to the nearest orthopaedic service on call Broad arm sling to support limb for 2 weeks or until comfortable Regular analgesia as required No evidence to support Figure of 8 bandage or brace Medial third If undisplaced, no reduction required If displaced, urgent referral to the nearest orthopaedic service on call Broad arm sling to support limb No evidence to support Figure of 8 bandage or brace 10. What follow-up is required? Children <11 years old with undisplaced fractures do not usually require follow-up by a GP or fracture clinic. Repeat x-rays are usually not required. For children >=11 years old or those with displaced fractures, follow up should occur with a GP or in fracture clinic in one week with x-ray. Radiographs are usually not required. Mobilisation out of the sling commences at two weeks depending on pain control. 11. What advice should I give to parents? The majority of uncomplicated middle third fractures will have excellent functional and cosmetic outcomes. Provide parent with fracture of the clavicle (collarbone) fact sheet. Pain from the fracture and restriction of movement are usual for 2-3 weeks and will require regular analgesia. The child should re-attend if pain is increasing, or sensation changes abruptly. Contact sports and activities should be avoided for approximately six weeks post removal of sling. A lump usually develops at the fracture site, which may be visible and palpable for at least one year. 12. What are the potential complications associated with this injury? Neurovascular complications are rare Nonunion is uncommon Malunion - palpable or visual lump, which diminishes with remodelling Degenerative arthritis if acromioclavicular joint intra-articular incongruence",

Earlier, macular edema is CRVO was treated with intravitreal steroid (triamcinolone) injections. This injection has been gradually replaced over past few years by anti VEGF injections and Ozurdex implants. Ozurdex is a slow release implant and continue to have effect for 3-6 months and hence is a good option for treating macular edema along with Anti VEGF injections. Ozurdex is a rod shaped implant which is placed inside the eye in the vitreous cavity. It contains the steroid dexamethasone in concentration of. 7mg which is slowly released into the eye. The implant is biodegradable. It slowly dissolves into the eye and does not need to be removed. Steroids have an antiinflammatory effect and block chemical pathways that lead to swelling or leakage from blood vessels. The implant continues to release the drug into the eye for 3-6 months and thus a long lasting effect compared to intravitreal steroid injection.",

        "exp": "ANS- D Image Source- Figure : Axillary scrofuloderma with satellite lesion in anterior axillary fold Cutaneous mycobacterial infections are chronic granulomatous lesions affecting skin at various regions of the body. Micro-biologically they are classified as follows: Tuberculous, Pathogenic M tuberculosis M bovis M lepra M africanum Non-Tuberculous, Potentially Pathogenic Mycobacteria causing skin infections * Post-trauma abscess M. chelonae M. fortuitum M. terrae * Swimming pool granuloma * Buruli ulcer * Lupus vulgaris * Scrofuloderma M. marinum (M. Balanei) M. ulcerans M. tuberculosis M. tuberculosis Clinical Features There are different clinical presentations in cutaneous tuberculous infections, depending on the virulence and number of bacilli infected, immunological status of the host and the route of infection. Traditionally the clinical types are divided into two groups: True cutaneous tuberculosis Lupus vulgaris Tuberculous verrucosa cutis Scrofuloderma Tuberculous chancre, gumma, cold abscess Miliary tuberculosis Tuberculids Papulonecrotic tuberculid Lichen scrofulosorum Erythema induratum Exogenous Source Endogenous Hypersensitivity * Tuberculosis chancre (primary inoculation TB) * Tuberculosis verucosa cutis * Lupus vulgaris * Scrofuloderma * Orificial tuberculosis * Miliary tuberculosis * Metastatic tuberculous abscess * Gumma * Tuberculids * Lichen scrofulossorum * Papulo-necrotic * Erythema induration * Erythema nodosum Tuberculids Characteristic features Papulonecrotic * Necrotic centre over papules, on extensor of extremities, elbow, knee back, face, Palms & Soles. * Lesions heal with varioliform scarring. * Histologically there is obliterative vasculitis in addition to a tuberculoid granuloma with caseation. Lichen scrofulosorum * Scaly grouped micorpapular rash over trunk especially in young girls. * Lesions heal without scarring (in contrast to papulonecrotic). * Histological hallmark is superficial epitheloid dermal granulomas surround hair follicles and sweat ducts (AI09) and may occupy several dermal papillae. Caseous necrosis is usually not seen. Erythema induratum (Bazin's disease) * Painful nodules over the back or sides of the legs of young women. * Lesions may break down which form ulcers, Ulcers heal with scarring. * Histologically there is vasculitis and granulomatous panniculitis. True Cutaneous Tuberculosis This group of cutaneous tuberculosis is infected through direct inoculation from an exogenous source, contiguous or haematogenous spread from an endogenous focus. Lupus Vulgaris (L.V.) This is a chronic, progressive and tissue-destructive form of cutaneous tuberculosis in patient with moderate or high degree of immunity. It occurs more common in females than in males. The classical lesions consist of reddish-brown plaque with \"apple-jelly\" colour on diascopy. The lesions progress by peripheral extension and central healing, atrophy and scarring. The areas of predilection are head and neck (80%), followed by arms and legs, then trunk. It can be associated with tuberculosis of lymph node, lung, bone and joint. In long-standing cases, patients may have scarring, deformity, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma or sarcoma. The main differential diagnosis includes discoid lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, leprosy, lupoid leishmaniasis, tertiary syphilis, deep fungal or atypical mycobacterial infection, granulomatous rosacea and Wegener's granulomatosis. Lupus Vulgaris (L.V.) Tuberculosis Verrucosa Cutis (TBVC) this condition is common in boys over the buttocks and knees. This is mainly due to their habit of playing and squatting in the streets with open-bottom trousers. It usually presents as an indolent, purplish or brownish red, warty and hyperkeratotic plaque lesion. It affects patients with moderate or high immunity through direct inoculation of the tubercle bacilli at sites of trauma. The areas of predilection are therefore over the buttock, knee, elbow, hand and finger. Its progression is usually very slow and spontaneous resolution may occur. This condition must be differentiated from lupus vulgaris, viral wart, mycobacteria marinum infection, chromomycosis, tertiary syphilis and hypertrophic lichen planus. TBVC Scrofuloderma This results from direct extension of an underlying tuberculous focus such as lymph node, bone or joint to the overlying skin. It is characterized by undermined ulcers, nodules, fistulae, sinuses and scar. The areas of predilection are neck, supraclavicular fossae, axillae and groin. The differential diagnosis mainly includes hydradenitis suppurativa, actinomycosis, sporotrichosis and atypical mycobacterial infection. Scrofuloderma Tuberculids It has been postulated that tuberculids are the result of hypersensitivity reaction to haematogenous dissemination of tubercle bacilli or their toxin in patients with moderate or high degree of immunity. Papulonecrotic Tuberculid This condition usually presents with symmetrical crops of papular eruption that proceed to central necrosis, ulceration and depressed scar. It occurs predominantly in young adult, most commonly affecting the limbs. There may be history or distant foci of tuberculous infection. The main differential diagnosis includes prurigo simplex, papular eczema, folliculitis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta and secondary syphilis. Lichen Scrofulosorum This is a rare form of tuberculid, presenting with grouped lichenoid papules with perifollicular pattern over the trunk. It is frequently found in children or young adults and may be associated with tuberculosis of lymph node, bone or joint. The lesions often involute slowly in months without scar and then recur. This condition must be differentiated from lichenoid drug eruption, lichen nitidus, keratosis spinulosa, sarcoidosis, lichenoid syphilis and eruptive syringoma. Erythema Induratum (Bazin) This is a nodular tuberculid presenting with indolent inflamed deep-seated nodule and plaque, occurring bilaterally over the calves or feet. In severe case there may be necrosis, ulceration, depressed scar and pigmentation. It is more common in females than males. Usually there is no evidence of other distant tuberculous foci. The main differential diagnosis is erythema nodosum and other forms of nodular vasculitis. Mycobacteria Marinum Infection (Swimming pool or fish tank granuloma) This is a chronic granulomatous infection of the skin caused by M marinum, acquired by inoculation through abrasions. It is more vulnerable in children and adolescents who frequently go to swimming pools, and among fishermen and fishmongers. The lesion commonly occurs on fingers, knuckles, elbows, knees and feet. Clinically it presents as an inflamed nodule, pustule, ulcer or abscess. Sporotrichoid spread may occur. The main differential diagnosis includes lupus vulgaris, sporotrichosis and leishmaniasis.

In mitral valve incompetence and increased preload in the left ventri\u00adcle, an S3 heart sound is an excellent indicator of ventricular failure. The increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure is reflected back into the left atrium, with a subsequent increase in the hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary veins. When pulmonary venous pressure is greater than the pulmonary capillary on\u00adco tic pressure, a transudate leaks first into the intersti\u00adtium (Kerley lines on a chest radiograph) and eventu\u00adally into the alveoli, resulting in pulmonary edema and congestion.\nDyspnea, or the sensation of difficult or uncomfort\u00adable breathing, is the most common symptom of left sided heart failure. When a patient with left-sided heart failure lies down, the reduced gravitational force increases venous return to the heart. Because the left ventricle cannot handle the increased load, the blood backs up into the lungs, producing dyspnea. Paroxys\u00admal nocturnal dyspnea specifically refers to a choking sensation that wakens the patient at night. It usually subsides) to 20 minutes after the patient stands up, opens the window, and takes deep breaths.\nAnother finding associated with left-sided heart fail\u00adure is reduced renal perfusion, which occurs during the day due to the decreased cardiac output. Reduced cardiac output decreases the effective arterial blood volume and the glomerular filtration rate, allowing a greater reabsorption of urea in the proximal tubule. Because creatinine is neither reabsorbed nor secreted in the tubules, a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate causes a minor increase in serum creatinine. The disproportionate increase in the blood urea nitrogen level over that of the serum creatinine is called prerenal azotemia.",

Achondroplasia Causes 'disproportionate' dwarfism. Most common cause of; short-limb' dwarfism. The trunk is disproportionately long in comparison to the limbs. The proximal segments of limbs are disproportionately short - rhizomelic shortening. Other Features o Large skull with prominent forehead, o Saddle-shaped nose, o Frontal bossing, o Mid-face hypoplasia, o Stubby, splayed fingers {trident hands), o Mental development is normal. o During adulthood, short vertebral pedicles may lead to lumbar spinal stenosis. Incidence: 1 in 30,000 births. Inheritance: Autosomal dominant transmission. 80 per cent of cases are sporadic. Occurs due to a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3) gene on chromosome 4 causing a diminution in endochondral bone growth. Average adult height is usually around 122 cm (48 inches). Disproportionate shortening of the limb bones is detectable in utero by ultrasound scan. X-Rays All bones that are formed by endochondral ossification are affected Tubular bones are short but thick. Metaphyses is flared. Pelvic cavity is small and the iliac wings are flared, producing an almost horizontal acetabular roof. The vertebral interpedicular distance diminishes from L1 to L5. The spinal canal is reduced in size. Vertebral features are best defined on CT or MRI. Also Note: Spinal shortening is not a prominent feature of achondroplasia. Instead, achondroplasia is characterized by a trunk which is disproportionately long in relation to the limbs. Other Similar Conditions: Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia (MED): Widespread involvement of the epiphyses. Vertebrae are usually spared. Shortening is lesser than in achondroplasia. Face, skull, and spine are normal. Usually, involve only one or two pairs of joints. Spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia (SED): Multiple epiphyseal dysplasias along with well-marked vertebral changes. Vertebral changes include, o Delayed ossification. o Flattening of the vertebral bodies (platyspondyly). o Irregular ossification of the ring epiphyses. o Indentations of the end-plates (Schmorl's nodes).",

It also affects a small percentage of patients with highly selective vagotomy due to loss of receptive relaxation of stomach. o It is of 2 types : a) Early dumping syndrome # It occurs immediately after meals (after about 15 to 30 min) Dumping of hyperosmolar contents into the small bowel results in rapid fluid influx from the circulation into the gastrointestinal tract. This leads to acute intestinal distention and peripheral and splanchnic vasodilation. This gives rise to vasomotor & abdominal symptoms : epigastric fullness, sweating, light headedness, tachycardia, diarrhoea. Symptoms can be ameliorated by lying down or saline infusion. b) Late dumping syndrome It is seen late - 2 to 3 hrs after meal Occurs due to reactive hypoglycemia. The carbohyrate load in the small bowel causes a rise in plasma glucose, which in turn, causes high insulin levels. Hyperinsulinemia leads to hypoglycemia. Symptoms are relieved by administration of sugar, o Management Dietaryr managment Diet therapy is done to reduce jejunal osmolality Multiple small meals Food low in carbohydrate and rich in fat and protein are taken. Liquids during meals should be avoided. Somatostatin analogues (octreotide) Diet therapy is usually successful but if it fails, the patient is started on octreotide. Surgery' Most of the patients improve with time, dietary management and Octreotide. Only rarely surgery is needed. Surgical procedures used to treat dumping are: o Pyloric reconstruction, takedown of gastrojejunostomy, interposition of a 10 cm reversed intestinal segment beftveen the stomach & duodenum, conversion of Billroth II to Billroth I anastomosis, and conversion to Roux-en-Y-anastomosis.",

Heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) a diverse group of long primary transcripts formed in the eukaryotic nucleus, many of which will be processed to mRNA molecules by splicing.",

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a rare X-linked condition where a deficiency in the WAS gene (cytoskeletal glycoprotein) that leads to progressive loss of B cells, T cells, and platelets. WHY IS IT A PROBLEM? Patients will be immune compromised and susceptible to repeat infections. WHAT MAKES US SUSPECT IT? Risk factors: family history of disease Three cardinal findings: eczema, recurrent infections, thrombocytopenia (can see petechiae/bruises) Eczema Eczema in a patient with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (source) HOW DO WE CONFIRM A DIAGNOSIS? Blood serology: will demonstrate low platelet counts and low lymphocytes. Decreased/normal IgG/IgM Increased IgE and IgA Genetic testing: can demonstrate causal mutation. HOW DO WE TREAT IT? Hematopoietic cell transplant: is at present the only curative treatment, with excellent results for patients with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched family or unrelated donors (URDs) or partially matched cord-blood donors. IVIG: can be used for temporary treatment. Antibiotics used for current infections. HOW WELL DO THE PATIENTS DO? Life expectancy of patients with classic WAS is reduced, with premature death resulting from infections, hemorrhage, autoimmune disease, and malignancies. Bleeding is the main cause of death. Malignancies in patients with classic WAS are often fatal WAS THERE A WAY TO PREVENT IT? No, this genetic condition is not preventable. WHAT ELSE ARE WE WORRIED ABOUT? Opportunistic infections/chronic infections. Pateints are at higher risk for autoimmune disease and malignancy. OTHER HY FACTS? Platelets are not only fewer, but smaller as well",

        "question": "In a person who is acclimatized to high altitude for a long time, which of the following changes is seen?",
        "exp": "Ans: C (Pulmonary arterial hypertension) Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology, 21st ed, and Medical Physiology: Principles for Clinical Medicine by Rhoades RA 4th edition, pg 396 Explanation: \"Although the body undergoes many beneficial changes that allow acclimatization to high altitude, there are some undesirable effects. One of these is pulmonary hypertension (abnormally high pulmonary arterial blood pressure). Alveolar hypoxia causes pulmonary vasoconstriction. Remember that regional hypoxia redirects blood away from poorly ventilated regions in the lung without any change in pulmonary pressure. However, with generalized hypoxia, pulmonary pressure rises because all the preafveolar vessels constrict. In addition, prolonged hypoxia causes vascular remodeling in which pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The vascular remodeling results in narrowing of the small pulmonary arteries and increases pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to a further significant increase in pulmonary vascular hypertension.'' Ref: Medical Physiology: Principles for Clinical Medicine by Rhoades RA, 4th edition, pg 396 Changes Seen in High Altitude Acclimatization Respiratory alkalosis produced by the hyperventilation shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left, but there is a concomitant. Increase in red blood cell 2, 3-DPG, which tends to decrease the O2 affinity of hemoglobin. The net effect is a small increase in P50. Erythropoietin secretion increases promptly on ascent to high altitude and then falls somewhat over the following 4 days as the ventilatory response increases and the arterial PO2 rises. The increase in circulating RBCs triggered by the erythropoietin begins in 2-3 days and is sustained. | Alveolar PO2 | Hematocrit (Polycythemia) - | MCV and | MCHC. | RBC mass. | Concentration of capillaries in skeletal muscle tissue. | Myoglobin (Facilitates movement of O2 in tissues) | Mitochondria (the site of oxidative reactions). | Tissue cytochrome oxidase. | Aerobic enzyme concentration. | 2,3-BPG. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension, Right ventricular hypertrophy. Also Note: Hypoxic hypoxia is a problem in normal individuals at high altitudes In high altitudes, the composition of air stays the same, but the total barometric pressure falls with increasing altitude. Therefore, the PO2 also falls. At 3000 m (approximately 10,000 ft) above sea level, the alveolar PO2 is about 60 mmHg and there is enough hypoxic stimulation of the chemoreceptors to definitely increase ventilation. As one ascends higher, the alveolar PO2 falls less rapidly and the alveolar PCO2 declines somewhat because of the hyperventilation. The resulting fall in arterial PCO2 produces respiratory alkalosis. Manifestations in unacclimatized subjects: o c At 3700 m - Mental symptoms o At 5500 m - Hypoxic symptoms o At above 6100 m (20,000 ft) - Unconsciousness and death. Acute \"Transient\" Mountain Sickness Occurs when unacclimatized persons first arrive at a high altitude. This syndrome develops 8-24 hours after arrival and lasts 4-8 days. It is characterized by headache, irritability, insomnia, breathlessness, and nausea and vomiting. Associated with cerebral edema. The low PO2 at high altitude causes arteriolar dilation, and if cerebral auto regulation does not compensate, there is an increase in capillary pressure that favors increased transudetion of fluid into brain tissue. Decreased urine output (Normally diuresis is seen at high altitude). High-altitude cerebral edema The capillary leakage in mountain sickness progresses to frank brain swelling, with ataxia, disorientation, and in some cases coma and death due to herniation of the brain through the tentorium. High-altitude pulmonary edema. It is a patchy edema of the lungs that is related to the marked pulmonary hypertension that develops at high altitude. Treatment of High Altitude illness All forms of high-altitude illness are benefited by: Descent to a lower altitude. Diuretic acetazolamide - This drug inhibits carbonic anhydrase. producing increased HCO3- excretion in the urine, stimulating respiration, increasing PaCO2. and reducing CSF formation. Oxygen supplementation / Hyperbaric chamber (Pulmonary edema). Glucocorticoids (Cerebral edema). Nifedipine can lower pulmonary artery pressure. Chronic Mountain Sickness (Monge's Disease) Due to aberration of normal physiological response to high altitude. Extremely increased hemoglobin levels. Pulmonary hypertension. Right ventricular failure. Treatment: Return to lower altitudes.",

Dysthymia is a chronic, depressed mood accompanied by just one or two other symptoms of clinical depression (such as low energy or low self-esteem) that lasts at least two years in adults (or one year in kids). This low, dark mood -- sometimes described as a \"veil of sadness\" -- occurs nearly every day and can sometimes persist for many years. Some people may have this mood disorder for 10 to 20 years or even more before seeking treatment.Over time, more than half of people with dysthymia experience worsening symptoms that lead to the onset of a full syndrome of major depression superimposed on their dysthymic disorder. This is known as double depression. Persistent mood disorder o Mood disorders may run a chronic course over years with fluctuation of mood interposed with symptom free intervals. If symptoms persist for more than 2 years, they are referred to as persistent mood disorders. Two most important persistant mood disorders are Cyclothymia It is a subdued version of bipolar disorder, characterized by episodes of depression and hypomania that never have sufficient intensity to meet full diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder. Dysthemia Long standing (persistent, i.e., 2 years) mild depression which is not severe enough to meet full diagnostic criteria for major depression. Symptoms are more prominent than signs (more subjective than objective depression). This means that disturbances in appetite and libido are uncharacteristic, and psychomotor agitation or retardation is not observed. Kaplan & Sadock's Synopsis Of Psychiatry -11E = In DSM-5, cyclothymic disorder is defined as a \"chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance\" with many periods of hypomania and of depression. The disorder is differentiated from bipolar II disorder, which is characterized by the presence of major (not minor) depressive and hypomanic episodes. As with dysthymia, the inclusion of cyclothymic disorder with the mood disorders implies a relation, probably biological, to bipolar I disorder. Some psychiatrists, however, consider cyclothymic disorder to have no biological component and to result from chaotic object relations early in life.",

It also is associated with arthritis, pericarditis, aseptic meningitis, and the Guillain-Barn5 syndrome. M. pneumoniae can be cultivated on special media and identified by immunofluorescence staining and \"fried egg\" colonies on agar.\nU. urealyticum (once called tiny, or T, strain) has been implicated in cases of nongonococcal urethritis. As the name implies, this organism is able to split urea, a fact of diagnostic significance. U. urealyticum is part of the normal flora of the genitourinary tract, particularly in women.\nBoth M. orale and Mycoplasma salivarium are inhabitants of the normal human oral cavity.

Doctrine of partial responsibility - If a person is suffering from some weakness or aberration of mind (though not completely insane), he is only partially responsible for his actions, e.g. obsession states or depressions.3.

Currens rule- A person is not responsible if at the time of committing the crime, he did not have the capacity to regulate his conduct according to the requirements of law, as a result of his mental disease or defect.5.

Children suspected of having cholera or have profuse watery diarrhoea should be given standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution that is normally made, i.e. not further diluted. * standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (75 mmol/L sodium) should not be used ************* This is a summary of one of several WHO recommendations on the management of SAM in infants and children. The full set of recommendations can be found in 'Full set of recommendations' and in the guidelines and guidance documents under 'WHO documents' below. Full set of recommendations Ref 2- Fluid management in children with severe malnutrition and dehydration without shock 1. Children with severe acute malnutrition who present with some dehydration or severe dehydration but who are not shocked should be rehydrated slowly, either orally or by nasogastric tube, using oral rehydration solution for malnourished children** (5-10 mL/kg/h up to a maximum of 12 h). 2. Full-strength, standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (75 mmol/L sodium) should not be used for oral or nasogastric rehydration in children with severe acute malnutrition who present with some dehydration or severe dehydration. Either ReSoMal*** or half-strength standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution should be given, with added potassium and glucose, unless the child has cholera or profuse watery diarrhoea. Dissolve one sachet of standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution in 2 L water (instead of 1 L). Add 1 level scoop of commercially available combined minerals and vitamins mix1 or 40 mL of mineral mix solution (5), and add and dissolve 50 g of sugar. In some countries, sachets are available that are designed to make 500 mL of standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution. In this situation, dilution can be revised to add 1 L. 3. ReSoMal (or locally prepared ReSoMal using standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution) should not be given if children are suspected of having cholera or have profuse watery diarrhoea.**** Such children should be given standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution that is normally made, i.e. not further diluted. Additionally (2-6): children with severe acute malnutrition and who have some or severe dehydration but no shock should receive 5 mL/kg ReSoMal every 30 min for the first 2 h. Then, if the child is still dehydrated, 5-10 mL/kg/h ReSoMal should be given in alternate hours with F-75, up to a maximum of 10 h; signs of improved hydration status and overhydration should be checked every half hour for the first 2 h, then hourly; ReSoMal can either be prepared from a ready-to-dilute sachet (as per supplier's instructions) or prepared with one sachet of WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution plus 2 L of water with an added 50 g sugar and 40 mL mineral mix or one level scoop of combined minerals and vitamins; zinc (10-20 mg per day) should be given to all children as soon as the duration and severity of the episodes of diarrhoea start to reduce, thereby reducing the risk of dehydration. By continuing supplemental zinc for 10-14 days, this will also reduce the risk of new episodes of diarrhoea in the following 2-3 months. (Note, WHO-recommended therapeutic foods already contain adequate zinc, and children with severe acute malnutrition receiving F-75, F-100 or ready-to-use therapeutic food should not therefore receive additional zinc). Fluid management of children with severe acute malnutrition and shock 4. Children with severe acute malnutrition and signs of shock or severe dehydration and who cannot be rehydrated orally or by nasogastric tube should be treated with intravenous fluids, either: half-strength Darrow's solution with 5% dextrose, or Ringer's lactate solution with 5% dextrose. If neither is available, 0.45% saline + 5% dextrose should be used. Additionally (2-6): the general principles of resuscitation, in particular providing oxygen and improving breathing, similarly apply to children with severe acute malnutrition; the only indication for intravenous infusion in a child with severe acute malnutrition is circulatory collapse caused by severe dehydration or septic shock when the child is lethargic or unconscious (excluding cardiogenic shock); all children with severe acute malnutrition with signs of shock with lethargy or unconsciousness should be treated for septic shock. This includes especially children with signs of dehydration but no history of watery diarrhoea, children with hypothermia or hypoglycaemia, and children with both oedema and signs of dehydration; in case of shock with lethargy or unconsciousness, intravenous rehydration should begin immediately, using 15 mL/kg/h of one of the recommended fluids; it is important that the child is carefully monitored every 5-10 min for signs of overhydration and signs of congestive heart failure. If signs of overhydration and congestive heart failure develop, intravenous therapy should be stopped immediately; if a child with severe acute malnutrition presenting with shock does not improve after 1 h of intravenous therapy, a blood transfusion (10 mL/kg slowly over at least 3 h) should be given; children with severe acute malnutrition should be given blood if they present with severe anaemia, i.e. Hb <4 g or > 6g with signs of respiratory distress blood transfusions should only be given to children with severe acute malnutrition within the first 24 h of admission. * This is an extract from relevant guidelines and guidance documents as listed in 'References'. Additional guidance information can be found in these documents. ** A specific electrolyte-micronutrient product formulated according to WHO specifications for use in the management of children with severe acute malnutrition. *** ReSoMal is a powder for the preparation of an oral rehydration solution exclusively for oral or nasogastric rehydration of people suffering from severe acute malnutrition. It must be used exclusively under medical supervision in inpatient care, and must not be given for free use to the mother or caregiver. **** Three or more loose or watery stools in a day, for more than 14 days.

Another group of antibodies termed lupus anticoagulant (LA) prolong clotting times in vitro; this prolongation is not corrected by adding normal plasma to the detection system. APS may occur alone (primary), or in association with any other autoimmune disease (secondary). Catastrophic APS (CAPS) is defined as a rapidly progressive thromboembolic disease involving simultaneously three or more organs, organ systems, or tissues leading to corresponding functional defects. # The antiphospholipid antibody is IgA or IgM against enzymes in the coagulation cascade. Antibodies bind to phospholipids in vitro and prolongs PTT. Antibody predisposes to thrombosis by maintaining platelets in inactivated state or by inhibiting the fibrinolytic activity of endothelial cells. Bleeding manifests in presence of thrombocytopenia hypoprothrombinaemia. Features: # Recurrent fetal loss (mid-trimester abortions) # Recurrent thrombotic events # Thrombocytopenia/Pancytopenia # IUGR and placental abruption # Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) # Diagnostic test : is Russel viper venom PTT. Prolongation of Russel viper venom time is more sensitive, it is neutralized by adding platelet membrane (lupus anticoagulant). # Treatment--After the first thrombotic event, APS patients should be placed on warfarin for life aiming to achieve an INR of 2.5 to 3.5, alone or in combination with 80 mg of aspirin daily. Pregnancy morbidity is prevented by a combination of heparin with aspirin 80 mg daily. IVIg 400 mg/kg qd for 5 days may also prevent abortions, while glucocorticoids are ineffective. Aspirin 80 mg daily protects patients with SLE positive for aPL antibodies from developing thrombotic events.",
