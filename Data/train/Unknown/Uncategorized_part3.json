        "question": "I. R. I. S. is:",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome o The term \"immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\" (IRIS) describes a collection of inflammatory disorders associated with paradoxical worsening of preexisting infectious processes following the initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected individuals. Preexisting infections in individuals with IRIS may have been previously diagnosed and treated or they may be subclinical and later unmasked by the host's regained capacity to mount an inflammatory response. o If immune function improves rapidly following the commencement of HAART, systemic or local inflammatory reactions may occur at the site or sites of the preexisting infection. o This inflammatory> reaction is usually self-limited, especially if the preexisting infection is effectively treated. However, long-term sequelae and fatal outcomes may rarely occur, particularly when neurologic structures are involved. Diagnostic criteria for IRISo There is no universally agreed-upon definition for IRIS. However, it is generally accepted that the diagnosis of IRIS requires the worsening of a recognized (''paradoxical\" IRIS) or unrecognized pre-existing infection (\"unmasking\" IRIS) in the setting of improving immunologic function. Most or all of the following features should be present in order to make the diagnosis: o The presence of AIDS with a low pretreatment CD4 count (often less than 100 cells/microL). One important exception to this general rule is tuberculosis. IRIS secondary to preexisting M. tuberculosis infection may occur in individuals with CD4 counts >200. o A positive virologic and immunological response to ART. o The absence of evidence of drug-resistant infection, bacterial superinfection, drug allergy or other adverse drug reactions, patient noncompliance, or reduced drug levels due to drug-drug interactions or malabsorption after appropriate evaluation for the clinical presentation. o The presence of clinical manifestations consistent with an inflammatory condition. o A temporal association between HAART initiation and the onset of clinical features of illness. Summary and recommendationso The clinical features of each individual case of IRIS are highly variable and data from controlled trials have not been published thus far to provide clear guidelines. Our recommendations are based on clinical experience, case reports, case series, and expert opinion:# Although it is reasonable to perform studies looking for unmasked subclinical opportunistic infection, the diagnosis of IRIS is generally one of exclusion. Investigations to rule out the possibility of drug reaction, patient noncompliance, persistently active infection and/or drug resistance are usually warranted before concluding that IRIS is present.# Most patients with IRIS develop symptoms within one week to a few months after the initiation of HAART. With later onset, other diagnoses become more likely. Abacavir hypersensitivity can be confused with IRIS, but symptoms worsen soon after each dose of abacavir. The diagnostic work-up for abacavir hypersensitivity reaction includes genetic testing for HLA-B5701.# When a diagnosis of IRIS is considered highly likely, further or repeated invasive diagnostic procedures to locate an occult infection may be reasonably delayed, deferred, or altogether avoided.# Treatment for the underlying pathogen should generally be started or continued in patients who develop IRIS. This is particularly important when treating patients with IRIS associated with hepatitis B virus.# Corticosteroids or NSAIDS may help decrease the inflammatory response in some patients with IRIS. The decision to use corticosteroids should be individualized and should take into account the risks of therapy. When we choose to treat with corticosteroids, we initiate therapy with prednisone at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (maximal dose 60 to 80 mg) and then taper steroid therapy while monitoring for recurrence of clinical symptoms over the ensuing weeks to months.# For most patients, we suggest initiation of ART within two weeks of starting treatment of the underlying opportunistic infection to decrease the risk of clinical progression of AIDS and death.# For OIs that lack proven effective therapies other than HAART (eg, PML), we believe it is best to treat these patients with HAART despite the risk of an adverse outcome. We normally do not use steroids in such patients unless or until symptoms of IRIS appear.",

The basis for this property is the noncovalent interactions among lipids in the bilayer. The noncovalent interactions provide the lipids with some degree of motion. The fluidity of the lipid membrane depends on. Temperature. Type of lipid present. Affect of temperature on the fluidity of lipids. At low temperature. The lipids are in Gel phase (lipid bilayer is para crystalline). This limits the motion of the lipid molecules and thus their fluidity is decreased. At relatively high temperatures. The lipids are in a liquid disordered state or fluid state The motion of the lipid molecule is increased The membrane becomes more fluid The temperature at which the structure undergoes the transition from ordered to disordered state is called transition temperature. At intermediate temperature. Lipid exists in the liquid-ordered state. There is less than normal motion. At a physiological temperature, the fluidity of the membrane depends upon the type of lipid present. Fatty acid. The fluidity of the membrane increases with unsaturated fatty acid e. g. Linoleic acid. The fluidity of the membrane decreases with saturated fatty acid e. g. Stearic acid, palmitic acid. Cholesterol. At physiological temperature, the presence of cholesterol decreases the fluidity of the membrane. Lehninger states \"The rigid planar structure of the steroid nucleus, inserted between fatty acyl side chains, reduces the freedom of neighboring fatty acyl chains to move by rotation about their carbon-carbon bonds, forcing acyl chains into their fully extended conformation. The presence of sterols, therefore, reduces the fluidity in the core of the bilayer. \"Also, know. The transition temperature will be increased by (i. e. membrane fluidity will be decreased by)presence of cholesterols presence of saturated fatty acid.",

Ag o First virological marker detectable in the serum o HBs. Ag presence precedes elevations of serum aminotransferase activity and the onset of clinical illness, o HBs. Ag become undetectable 1-2 months after the onset of jaundice and rarely persists beyond 6 months, o In chronic HBV infection, HBs. Ag remains detectable beyond 6 months. 2. HBc. Ag o It is not demonstrable in the circulation because it is enclosed within the HBs Ag coat, o HBc Ag remains in the hepatocyte, where it can readily be detectable by immunohistochemical staining. 3. HBe. Ag o HBe Ag appears concurrently with or shortly after HBs Ag. o HBe Ag is an indicator of active intrahepatic replication and high injectivity. o It is a qualitative marker of HBV replication. o HBs. Ag carrier mothers who are HBe. Ag positive almost invariably (> 90%) transmit hepatitis B infection to their offspring, whereas HBs. Ag carrier mothers with anti HBe rarely (10 to 15%) infect their offspring. o HBe testing is indicated primarily during follow up of chronic infection. 4. Anti HBe. Ag o Appears within the first I to 2 weeks after the appearance of HBs Ag. o In acute or recent infection IgM anti-HBc is detected, o IgG anti-HBc indicates remote infection. 5. Anti HBs. Ag o It becomes detectable in blood when HBs Ag disappears, o Anti HBs Ag is a protective antibody. o It is the only serological marker; present after immunization. 6. Anti HBe. Ag o The disappearance of HBe Ag is followed by the appearance of anti-HBe Ag. o Its presence indicates low infectivity and virus replication. 7. HBVDNA o It is the quantitative marker of virus replication. Remember o For the diagnosis of HBV infection, detection of HBs Ag in blood is all that ordinarily necessary. o The simultaneous presence of IgM anti-HBc indicates recent infection, while IgG anti-HBc indicates remote infection. o In 1-5% of patients, there is a \"window\" or ''gap\" period between the disappearance of HBs Ag and appearance of anti-HBs Ag. During this period diagnosis is made by lgM anti-HBc Ag.",

All other features i. e. raised ESR, marked stiffness, restriction of chest movements & syndesmophytes are seen in A. S. Syndesmophytes. Syndesmophytes are thin, slender vertical radiodense spicules bridging the vertebral bodies, giving the spine 'bamboo9 appearance. They are actually ossification of outer fibers of annulus fibrosus. Syndesmophytes are seen in: Ankylosing spondylitis. Psoriatic arthritis. Reiter's disease. Arthritis Assoc. with Inflammatory bowel disease Before discussing A. S. lets see other options: Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH): Also k/a Forestier's disease, ankylosing hyperostosis. DISH is a syndrome of excessive calcification and ossification of soft tissues, mainly ligaments and entheses, that develops with aging. There is a marked predilection to the axial skeleton, particularly the thoracic spine. It may also involve the peripheral joints. The most characteristic radiographic abnormality of the DISH is calcification and ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament of the spine. The diagnosis is made by spinal radiographs that show \"flowing\" calcifications along the anterior and lateral portion of at least four contiguous vertebral bodies without loss of disc height and without typical radiographic findings of ankylosing spondylitis, (no syndesmophytes). A DISH commonly occurs in men in their fifth to sixth decade of life. Patients are often asymptomatic but may have spinal pain or limited spinal motion. The DISH can be ruled out as in DISH there is no raised ESR and syndesmophytes. (ESR is raised in inflammatory spondyloarthropathies like Ankylosing spondylitis. But DISH and degenerative osteoarthritis are non-inflammatory conditions, so ESR would be normal.). Apley's writes- \"Although DISH bears a superficial resemblance to AS, it is not an inflammatory disease; spinal pain and stiffness are seldom severe, the sacroiliitis joints are not eroded and the ESR is normal. \"Harrison writes- \"Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis which occurs in middle-aged and elderly is usually not symptomatic. \"Degenerative osteoarthritis of the spine: It is a disease of elderly characterized by the formation of large osteophytes along the anterior and lateral aspects of the spine with decreased intervertebral disc spaces. Lumbar canal stenosis: It is ruled out as - Neurogenic claudication or pseudoclaudication is the usual symptom, consisting of back and buttock or leg pain induced by walking or standing and relieved by sitting.

Usually begins in the second or third decade with a median age of 23, in 5% symptoms begin after 40. Male to female ratio is 2-3: 1. Strong correlation with HLA-B27 Pathology. Enthesitis i. e. inflammation of the insertion points of tendons, ligaments or joint capsule on the bone is one of the hallmarks of this entity of disease. Primarily affects axial (spinal) skeleton and sacroiliitis is often the earliest manifestation of A. S. Involvement of costovertebral joints frequently occur, leading to diminished chest expansion (normal > 5 cm). Peripheral joints for e. g. shoulders and hips (root joints) are also involved in l/3rd patients. Extraarticular manifestations like acute anterior uveitis (in 5%); rarely aortic valve disease, carditis, and pulmonary fibrosis. Pathological changes proceed in three stages-Inflammation with granulation tissue formation and erosion of adjacent bone. Fibrosis of granulation tissue. Ossification of the fibrous tissue, leading to ankylosis of the joint. Clinical features. The low back pain of insidious onset. Duration usually less than 3 months. Significant morning stiffness and improvement with exercise. Limited chest expansion. Diffuse tenderness over the spine and sacroiliac joints. Loss of lumbar lordosis increased thoracic kyphosis. Decreased spinal movements (especially extension) in all directions. Radiological features. Cardinal and earliest sign is erosion and fuzziness of the sacroiliac joints. Squaring of vertebral bodies. Syndesmophytes (described earlier) giving the appearance of a \"bamboo spine\". Other investigations. ESR and CRP are usually elevated. HLA-B27 is present in 95% of cases. Treatment.

Cyproterone and cyproterone acetate are effective antiandrogens that inhibit the action of androgens at the target organ. The acetate form has a marked progestational effect that suppresses the feedback enhancement of LH and FSH, leading to a more effective antiandrogen effect. Flutamide, a substituted anilide, is a potent antiandrogen that has been used in the treatment of prostatic carcinoma. Although not a steroid, it behaves like a competitive antagonist at the androgen receptor.",

Because most signs of infection (e. g., pneumonitis, pyuria) depend on the presence of neutrophils, serious infection may be present in such a patient without producing characteristic physical, radiologic, or laboratory findings. Thus, broad spectrum antibiotics (to treat a variety of possible infections) must be initiated promptly after cultures are obtained. Deferring treatment until culture results are available may result in overwhelming septicemia and death.

Evidence shows organ problems with the kidneys and livers can occur without signs of protein, and that the amount of protein in the urine does not predict how severely the disease will progress. Prior to this time, most healthcare providers traditionally adhered to a rigid diagnosis of preeclampsia based on blood pressure and protein in the urine(proteinuria). Preeclampsia is now to be diagnosed by persistent high blood pressure that develops during pregnancy or during the postpartum period that is associated with a lot of protein in the urine or the new development of decreased blood platelets, trouble with the kidney or liver, fluid in the lungs, or signs of brain trouble such as seizures and/or visual disturbances. Other Big Changes in Diagnosis and Management Evidence tells us that preeclampsia is a dynamic process. Diagnosing a woman's condition as \"mild preeclampsia\" is not helpful because it is a progressive disease, progressing at different rates in different women. Appropriate care requires frequent re-evaluation for severe features of the disease and appropriate actions outlined in the new guidelines. Mild to moderate high blood pressure (140-159 mm Hg systolic or 90-159 mm Hg diastolic measured on two occasions at least four hours apart) warrants close evaluation and monitoring. High blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg systolic or greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg diastolic is a feature of severe preeclampsia. To prevent eclampsia (seizures), magnesium sulfate should be given if your blood pressure is 160/110 or higher. If your blood pressure is less than 160/110 and you have other severe symptoms that usually precede seizures, you should be given magnesium sulfate. Severe hypertension can be confirmed within a short interval (minutes) to facilitate timely antihypertensive therapy. Guidelines for the timing of delivery have been modified based on data indicating best outcomes for mother and baby. One of the biggest changes in preeclampsia management relates to the timing of delivery in women with preeclampsia without severe features. Studies suggest that the best time of delivery is at 37 weeks of gestation. It has been known for many years that preeclampsia can worsen or become apparent for the first time after delivery. The new guidelines include specific recommendations to improve outcomes for women who have postpartum preeclampsia. Evidence firmly tells us that preeclampsia is associated with later life cardiovascular disease (CVD), and the ACOG report calls for research to learn how to use this information to help patients. A new recommendation is to educate all pregnant and postpartum patients about the signs and symptoms of preeclampsia. The Preeclampsia Foundation advocated for this addition based on the evidence of its own research study that has just been published.",

Explanation: MORPHOLOGY OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASECortical atrophy especially in frontal, temporal and parietal lobes. Compensatory ventricular enlargement due to loss of parenchyma and reduced brain volume - (hydrocephalus ex vacuo). Structures involved early - medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. The major microscopic abnormalities: o Neuritic (senile) plaques. o Neurofibrillary tangles. Progressive severe neuronal loss and reactive gliosis. Neuritic Plaques. Focal, spherical collections of dilated, tortuous, neuritic processes (dystrophic neurites) often around a central amyloid core, surrounded by a clear halo. Size from 20 to 200 mm in diameter. Microglial cells and reactive astrocytes are present at their periphery. Plaques are found in the hippocampus, amygdala, and neocortex. The amyloid core, stained by Congo Red. contains several abnormal proteins. The dominant component of the amyloid plaque core is Ab. a peptide derived from, amyloid precursor protein (APP). Other proteins include: o Components of the complement cascadeo Pro-inflammatory cytokineso al-antichymotrypsino Apolipoproteins. Neurofibrillary Tangles. Bundles of filaments in the cytoplasm of the neurons that displace or encircle the nucleus. In pyramidal neurons, they have an elongated \"flame\" shape: in rounder cells, the basket weave of fibers around the nucleus takes a rounded contour (\"globose\" tangles). H&E staining: Basophilic fibrillar structures. Very well demonstrated by silver (Bielschowsky) staining. They are commonly found in cortical neurons, especially in the entorhinal cortex, pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, the amygdala, the basal forebrain, and the raphe nuclei. They are insoluble and resistant to clearance remaining visible in tissue sections as \"ghost\" or \"tombstone\" tangles long after the death of the parent neuron. Ultrastructurally, they are composed of paired helical filaments along with some straight filaments. A major component of paired helical filaments is abnormally hyperphosphorylated forms of the protein tau. an axonal microtubule-associated protein that enhances microtubule assembly. Other components include MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein-2) and ubiquitin. Paired helical filaments are also found in the dystrophic neurites that form the outer portions of neuritic plaques and in axons coursing through the affected gray matter as neuropil threads. Other Features. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Granulovacuolar degeneration: Small (~5 mm in diameter), clear intraneuronal cytoplasmic vacuoles, each of which contains an argyrophilic granule.

The contemporary view of atherogenesis incorporates elements of both theories and also the risk factors I Response-to-injury hypothesis). Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory and healing response of the arterial wall to endothelial injury. Lesion progression occurs through the interaction of modified lipoproteins, monocyte-derived macrophages, and T lymphocytes with the normal cellular constituents of the arterial wall. Atherosclerosis is produced by the following pathogenic events: Endothelial injury, which causes (among other things) increased vascular permeability, leukocyte adhesion, and thrombosis. Accumulation of lipoproteins (mainly LDL and its oxidized forms) in the vessel wall. Monocyte adhesion to the endothelium, followed by migration into the intima and transformation into macrophages and foam cells. Platelet adhesion. Factor release from activated platelets, macrophages, and vascular wall cells, inducing smooth muscle cell recruitment, either from the media or from circulating precursors. Smooth muscle cell proliferation and ECM production. Lipid accumulation both extracellular!} and within cells (macrophages and smooth muscle cells).",

Explanation: Compound fractures are classified under the Gustilo Anderson Classification of Open Fractures. TYPE ILow-energy clean woundcl cm with minimal soft tissue injury and comminution. TYPE IIWound >1 cm with moderate soft-tissue damage and fracture comminution. Soft tissue component is often defined as disruption <10 cm and without periosteal stripping. TYPE IIIThe Type III open fractures include higher energy injuries. Substantial soft tissue injury, with periosteal stripping, has occurred, and a crush component is typically present. The fracture pattern, such as segmental comminution, reflects the higher forces imparted. TYPE IIIa. Fracture wound >10 cm with crushed tissue and contamination but usually with adequate soft tissue coverage. TYPEIIIb. Fracture wound >10 cm with crushed tissue and contamination having inadequate soft tissue cover associated with periosteal stripping and often requiring transfer of vascularized tissue for soft tissue coverage. TYPE IIIc. Open fractures associated with a major vascular injury that requires repair for limb salvage. Notes: Type I fractures are those with minimal soft tissue injury. Skin lacerations are less than or equal to one cm, and are clean, without evidence of deep muscle crushing or foreign debris contamination. Additionally, the underlying fracture pattern must he consistent with a low energy injury. Examples include spiral diaphyseal fractures or rotational periarticular injuries. Higher energy fracture patterns, such as segmental or bending wedge fractures, should be considered as higher grade open fractures. Injury being a farm injury is suggestive of contamination. Hence this case would go into Type IIIA. In the event of segmental comminution being present, it would be classified as Type IIIB since segmental comminution is suggestive of more extensive soft tissue and periosteal injury irrespective of the size of the wound.",

        "exp": "The cauda equina is a structure within the lower end of the spinal column, that consists of nerve roots and rootlets from above. Because the spinal cord stops growing in infancywhile the bones of the spine continue growing, the spinal cord in adults ends at about the level of the vertebra L1, and at birth at L3. To get through the intervertebral foramen at the correct segment, the roots must travel down the length of the spine, thus gaining an oblique course. Thai is why the spinal nerves are more &more oblique as we trace them from supero-inferiorly. For e. g., L-5 spinal nerve is more oblique as compared to T-5. Also, L-5 will be more in length as compared to T-5 Clinical relevance Cauda equina syndrome is a serious neurologic condition in which there is compression of the contents of the spinal canal below the termination (conus) of the spinal cord. Any lesion which compresses the cauda equina may cause dysfunction of the nerves although the commonest is a central disc prolapse. Other causes include protrusion of the vertebra into the canal if weakened by infection or tumor and an epidural abscess or hematoma. Signs include weakness of the muscles innervated by the compressed roots (often paraplegia), sphincter weaknesses causing urinary retention and post-void residual incontinence as assessed by catheterizing after the patient has voided. Also, there may be decreased rectal tone; sexual dysfunction; saddle anesthesia; bilateral leg pain and weakness; and bilateral absence of ankle reflexes. Pain may, however, be wholly absent; the patient may complain only of lack of bladder control and of saddle-anaesthesia, and may walk into the consulting-room.",

On routine X-ray, a mass was seen in the right apical region of the lung. A biopsy was taken from the mass. Most likely diagnosis on the basis of description is malignant mesothelioma. Numerous long, slender microvilli will be seen on electron microscopy in malignant mesothelioma. (All. MS November 2013 repeat). Diagnosis depends on a constellation of findings, including the history of asbestos exposure, clinical signs and symptoms, radiographic findings, histopathological features, and immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies. On electron microscopy, the presence of long microvilli and abundant tonofilaments but absent microvillous rootlets and lamella bodies favor the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. Electron microscopy (ultrastructural examination) has been accepted for many years as the 'gold standard' for the diagnosis of mesothelioma. Mesothelioma cells are characterized by a profusion of markedly elongated surface microvilli in the absence of secretory cytoplasmic granules. Robbin's 8/e p734. Mesotheliomas: Most specific neoplasm associated with asbestosis. May develop 1-2 years after exposure, but incidence peaks at 20-35 years of exposure. Shows strong male predilection (3: 1). Diagnosis depends on a constellation of findings, including the history of asbestos exposure, clinical signs and symptoms, radiographic findings, histopathological features, and immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies. On electron microscopy, the presence of long microvilli and abundant tonofilaments but absent microvillous rootlets and lamella bodies favor the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. Pathological Features of Malignant Mesothelioma. Malignant mesothelioma is a diffuse lesion that spreads widely in the pleural space. Usually associated with extensive pleural effusion and direct invasion of thoracic structures. The affected lung becomes ensheathed by a thick layer of soft, gelatinous, grayish pink tumor tissue. Microscopically, malignant mesotheliomas may be epithelioid (60%), sarcomatoid (20%), or mixed (20%). Epithelioid mesothelioma. Epithelioid mesothelioma may at times be difficult to differentiate grossly and histologically from pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Features that favor mesothelioma includes: Positive staining for acid mucopolysaccharide, which is inhibited by previous digestion by hyaluronidase. Lack of staining for CEA and other epithelial glycoprotein antigens, markers that are generally expressed by adenocarcinoma. Strong staining for keratin proteins, with accentuation of perinuclear rather than peripheral staining. Positive staining for calretinin, Wilms tumor 1 (WT-1), cytokeratin 5/6, and D2-40. On electron microscopy. the presence of Iona microvilli and abundant tonofilaments but absent microvillous rootlets and lamellar bodies. The mesenchymal type of mesothelioma appears as a spindle cell sarcoma, resembling fibrosarcoma (sarcomatoid type). The mixed type of mesothelioma contains both epithelioid and sarcomatoid patterns.

Sling Operations: a. After reviewing reports that included patient follow-up for more than 48 months, the American Urological Association and the Female Stress Urinary Incontinence Guidelines Panel concluded that the two most effective surgical treatments for stress incontinence are retropubic bladder neck suspensions and sling procedures. b. This panel confirmed that the use of sling operations in women with complex or recurrent stress urinary incontinence is a safe and effective treatment. II. Anterior Colporrhaphy Anterior vaginal repair is the oldest operation for stress incontinence in gynecology. It was described by Howard Kelly in 1914. He believed that stress incontinence was caused by an open vesical neck rather than from loss of urethral support, and he designed an operation to cure this condition by pulling the bladder neck closed using periurethral Kelly plication sutures. The problem with most techniques of anterior colporrhaphy is that they do not hold up well over time. Most surgical series that have evaluated techniques of anterior colporrhaphy for stress incontinence show long-term success rates of only 35% to 65%, a figure that most would regard as unacceptably low. Anterior colporrhaphy should be reserved primarily for patients requiring cystocele repair who do not have significant stress incontinence.",

        "question": "The most common organism responsible for symptomatic Native valve infective endocarditis in children -",
        "exp": "Ans- C Staph aureus Ref- Causative Organism(s) Clinical Features of IE Staphylococcus aureus Overall, S aureus infection is the most common cause of IE, including PVE, acute IE, and IVDA IE. Approximately 35-60. 5% of staphylococcal bacteremias are complicated by IE. More than half the cases are not associated with underlying valvular disease. The mortality rate of S aureus IE is 40-50%. S aureus infection is the second most common cause of nosocomial BSIs, second only to Co. NS infection. The incidence of MRSA infections, both the hospital- and community-acquired varieties, has dramatically increased (50% of isolates). Sixty percent of individuals are intermittent carriers of MRSA or MSSA. The primary risk factor for S aureus BSI is the presence of intravascular lines. Other risk factors include cancer, diabetes, corticosteroid use, IVDA, alcoholism, and renal failure. The realization that approximately 50% of hospital- and community-acquired staphylococcal bacteremias arise from infected vascular catheters has led to the reclassification of staphylococcal BSIs. BSIs are acquired not only in the hospital but also in any type of health care facility (eg, nursing home, dialysis center). Of S aureus bacteremia cases in the United States, 7. 8% (200, 000) per year are associated with intravascular catheters. Streptococcus viridans This organism accounts for approximately 50-60% of cases of subacute disease. Most clinical signs and symptoms are mediated immunologically. Streptococcus intermedius group These infections may be acute or subacute. S intermedius infection accounts for 15% of streptococcal IE cases. Members of the S intermedius group, especially S anginosus, are unique among the streptococci in that they can actively invade tissue and form abscesses, often in the CNS. Abiotrophia Approximately 5% of subacute cases of IE are due to infection with Abiotrophia species. They require metabolically active forms of vitamin B-6 for growth. This type of IE is associated with large vegetations that lead to embolization and a high rate of posttreatment relapse. Group D streptococci Most cases are subacute. The source is the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. It is the third most common cause of IE. They pose major resistance problems for antibiotics. Nonenterococcal group D The clinical course is subacute. Infection often reflects underlying abnormalities of the large bowel (eg, ulcerative colitis, polyps, cancer). The organisms are sensitive to penicillin. Group B streptococci Acute disease develops in pregnant patients and older patients with underlying diseases (eg, cancer, diabetes, alcoholism). The mortality rate is 40%. Complications include metastatic infection, arterial thrombi, and congestive heart failure. It often requires valve replacement for cure. Group A, C, and G streptococci Acute disease resembles that of S aureus IE (30-70% mortality rate), with suppurative complications. Group A organisms respond to penicillin alone. Group C and G organisms require a combination of synergistic antibiotics (as with enterococci). Coagulase-negative S aureus This causes subacute disease. It behaves similarly to S viridans infection. It accounts for approximately 30% of PVE cases and less than 5% of NVE cases. Staphylococcus lugdunensis Staphylococcus lugdunensis is another coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species but is extremely aggressive compared to coagulase-positive S aureus. S lugdunensis frequently causes IE. Pseudomonas aeruginosa This is usually acute, except when it involves the right side of the heart in IVDA IE. Surgery is commonly required for cure. HACEK (ie, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, Kingella kingae) These organisms usually cause subacute disease. They account for approximately 5% of IE cases. They are the most common gram-negative organisms isolated from patients with IE. Complications may include massive arterial emboli and congestive heart failure. Cure requires ampicillin, gentamicin, and surgery. Fungal These usually cause subacute disease. The most common organism of both fungal NVE and fungal PVE is Candida albicans. Fungal IVDA IE is usually caused by Candida parapsilosis or Candida tropicalis. Aspergillus species are observed in fungal PVE and NIE. Bartonella The most commonly involved species is Bartonella quintana. IE typically develops in homeless males who have extremely substandard hygiene. Bartonella must be considered in cases of culture-negative endocarditis among homeless individuals. Multiple pathogens (polymicrobial) Pseudomonas and enterococci are the most common combination of organisms. It is observed in cases of IVDA IE The cardiac surgery mortality rate is twice that associated with single-agent IE.",

ABO (H) antibodies are invariably present in plasma when persons RBC lacks the corresponding antigen The basic difference between ABO blood group system and other blood group systems (such as Rh, Kell, Duffy, MNSs blood groups), which makes the ABO group so important is that -preformed ABO antibodies (agglutinins) are present in person serum when his RBCs lack the corresponding antigen (ie. anti B antibody would be present in a person of type A and type O blood groups. These two blood groups do not have the 'B' antigen on the RBCs). This is not the case with other blood groups. Preformed antibodies are not present. They are formed only after an exposure to the antigen, for example, an Rh-negative person do not have anti- Rh antibodies, these antibodies are formed only after an exposure to Rh-positive blood (by a blood transfusion, i. e. this makes the first blood transfusion safe even if mismatched). These preformed antibodies, rapidly destroy the RBCs of any mismatched blood transfusion.

Qo But both photoreceptors have differences with other sensory receptors. o The photoreceptors do not behave like other receptors when exposed to their stimulus: they are hyperpolarized instead of depolarized. o The photoreceptor cell has a membrane potential of - 40 mV. o The photoreceptors cell are in depolarized state in the dark. o It is due to Na+ channels in outer segment, which are open in dark state which allow influx of Na+ and depolarization, o Therefore, a steady state of neurotransmitter (glutamateQ) is released from photoreceptors. o In light photoactivation of the opsin is accompanied by a conformational change, which in turn brings about a similar change in a membrane protein, transducinQ, in the plasma membrane of outer segment, o Transducin is a member of G-proteins which activates phosphodiesterase and decreases intracellular c. GMP due to degradation by c. GMP. o Decrease in c. GMP causes closure of Na+ channels (c. GMP keeps Na+ channels open in outer segment) and hyperpolarization. o Phototransduction is thus a unique example of sensory transduction that is associated with hyperpolarizationQ and a reduction in neurotransmitter release from the sensory receptor (all other sensory receptors develop depolarization/hypopolarization in response to stimulus), o Unlike other receptors, photoreceptors (and bipolar) cells do not produce an action potential but only a graded changes of the membrane potential (hyperpolarizing local graded potential). o Because the distance is very short from the outer segment-where the membrane potential changes are produced-to the synapses between the photoreceptors and the bipolar cells, even small fluctuations of the membrane potential cause alterations of the transmitter release from the photoreceptors, o There is thus no need for the production of action potentials, which are important when signals are to be propagated over long distances. o In contrast to the photoreceptors and the bipolars, the ganglion cells produce action potentials (conducted in the optic nerve to the higher visual centres).",

        "exp": "Ans- B Ref- Clinical manifestations Due to the lack of typical symptoms and signs, early-stage breast cancer (ESBC) is often neglected by patients and typically found during physical examination or breast cancer screening. The typical signs of breast cancer, as listed below, usually occur in the more advanced stages. 2. 1. 1. Breast Mass About 80% of breast cancer cases were first diagnosed with breast masses. Patients often recognize their breast mass unintentionally, and the mass tends to be single and hard, with irregular margins and less smooth surface. Most breast cancers are manifested as a painless mass, and only a few had varied degrees of pain or tingling. 2. 1. 2. Nipple discharge Nipple discharge can be sanguineous (bloody), serous, mucinous, milky, or purulent. It can also occur half year after the termination of breastfeeding. Causes for nipple discharge vary but commonly include intraductal papilloma, breast hyperplasia, dilation of mammary duct, and breast cancer. The bloody discharge which is effused from unilateral single hole should be further examined; more attention should be paid if the nipple discharge is accompanied with breast mass. 2. 1. 3. Skin changes A variety of skin changes can occur in patients with breast cancer. Most commonly, the tumor invades the Cooper's ligament and then adheres to the skin, showing a \"Dimple sign\". When the cancer cells block the lymphatic vessels, an orange peel like texture of the skin occurs. In patients with advanced breast cancer, the cancer cells can infiltrate into the skin along the lymphatic vessels, glandular vessels, and/or fibrous tissue, and then proliferate to form satellite nodules of skin over breast. 2. 1. 4. Abnormalities of nipple and areola If the tumor is located deep inside nipple, it can cause the retraction of nipple. In some patients, although tumor is relatively far away from the nipple, it can invade and shrink the large ducts within the mammary gland, and thus cause the retraction or elevation of nipple. Eczematoid carcinoma of nipple, also known as Paget's disease, is clinically manifested as the itchy nipple, erosion, ulceration, crusting, scaling, which can be associated with causalgia; in addition, nipple retraction also can be found. 2. 1. 5. Axillary lymphadenectasis In patients with occult breast cancer, the mass usually is impalpable during physical examination, with axillary lymphadenectasis as the first symptom. The metastasis of axillary lymph node can be detected in one third or more inpatients. The ipsilateral axillary lymph node(s) may become swollen at the early stage, and some swollen lymph nodes can hard, scattered, and movable. With the progression of the disease, the lymph nodes fuse together gradually and adhere to and even fix with the skin and surrounding tissues. The metastatic lymph nodes can be palpable in the supraclavicular area or contralateral axilla in patients with advanced breast cancer. ]. More on Ca Breast- TNM staging of breast cancer B. 1 Primary tumor (T) The clinical and pathological definitions for the stages of primary tumors are same. If the size of a tumor is assessed during physical examination, it can be presented as T1, T2, or T3. When other measurements (such as mammography or pathology) are applied, the four subgroups of T1 can be used. The size of tumor is accurate to 0. 1 cm. TX means that the tumor size cannot be assessed. T0: No evidence of primary tumor. Tis: Carcinoma in situ. Tis ductal carcinoma in situ Tis lobular carcinoma in situ Tis Paget's disease of the nipple with no associated tumor. Note: Paget's disease associated with a tumor is classified according to the size of the tumor. T1: Tumor 2. 0 cm or less in greatest dimension T1mic: Microinvasion 0. 1 cm or less in greatest dimension; T1a: Tumor more than 0. 1 cm but not more than 0. 5 cm in greatest dimension; T1b: Tumor more than 0. 5 cm but not more than 1. 0 cm in greatest dimension; T1c: Tumor more than 1. 0 cm but not more than 2. 0 cm in greatest dimension; T2: Tumor more than 2. 0 cm but not more than 5. 0 cm in greatest dimension; T3: Tumor more than 5. 0 cm in greatest dimension; T4: Tumor of any size with direct extension to (a) chest wall or (b) skin. T4a: Extension to chest wall; T4b: Edema (including peau d'orange) or ulceration of the skin of the breast or satellite skin nodules confined to the same breast; T4c: Both of the above (T4a and T4b); T4d: Inflammatory carcinoma. B. 2 Regional lymph nodes (N) Clinical NX: Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (e. g., previously removed); N0: No regional lymph node metastasis; N1: Metastasis to movable ipsilateral axillary lymph node(s); N2: Metastases in ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes that are clinically fixed or matted; or, metastases in clinically detected ipsilateral internal mammary nodes in the absence of clinically evident* axillary lymph node metastases. N2a: Metastases in ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes fixed to one another (matted) or to other structures. N2b: Metastases only in clinically detected ipsilateral internal mammary nodes and in the absence of clinically evident axillary lymph node metastases. N3: Metastases in ipsilateral infraclavicular lymph node(s) with or without axillary lymph node involvement; or, metastases in clinically detected ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node(s) with clinically evident* axillary lymph node metastases; or, metastases in ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node(s) with or without axillary or internal mammary lymph node involvement. N3a: Metastases in ipsilateral infraclavicular lymph node(s). N3b: Metastases in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node(s) and axillary lymph node(s). N3c: Metastases in ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node(s). B. 3 Distant Metastases (M) MX: Distant metastasis can not be assessed. M0: No distant metastasis M1: Distant metastasis.

Earlier, macular edema is CRVO was treated with intravitreal steroid (triamcinolone) injections. This injection has been gradually replaced over past few years by anti VEGF injections and Ozurdex implants. Ozurdex is a slow release implant and continue to have effect for 3-6 months and hence is a good option for treating macular edema along with Anti VEGF injections. Ozurdex is a rod shaped implant which is placed inside the eye in the vitreous cavity. It contains the steroid dexamethasone in concentration of. 7mg which is slowly released into the eye. The implant is biodegradable. It slowly dissolves into the eye and does not need to be removed. Steroids have an antiinflammatory effect and block chemical pathways that lead to swelling or leakage from blood vessels.

In mitral valve incompetence and increased preload in the left ventri\u00adcle, an S3 heart sound is an excellent indicator of ventricular failure. The increased left ventricular end diastolic pressure is reflected back into the left atrium, with a subsequent increase in the hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary veins. When pulmonary venous pressure is greater than the pulmonary capillary on\u00adco tic pressure, a transudate leaks first into the intersti\u00adtium (Kerley lines on a chest radiograph) and eventu\u00adally into the alveoli, resulting in pulmonary edema and congestion. Dyspnea, or the sensation of difficult or uncomfort\u00adable breathing, is the most common symptom of left sided heart failure. When a patient with left-sided heart failure lies down, the reduced gravitational force increases venous return to the heart. Because the left ventricle cannot handle the increased load, the blood backs up into the lungs, producing dyspnea. Paroxys\u00admal nocturnal dyspnea specifically refers to a choking sensation that wakens the patient at night. It usually subsides) to 20 minutes after the patient stands up, opens the window, and takes deep breaths. Another finding associated with left-sided heart fail\u00adure is reduced renal perfusion, which occurs during the day due to the decreased cardiac output. Reduced cardiac output decreases the effective arterial blood volume and the glomerular filtration rate, allowing a greater reabsorption of urea in the proximal tubule. Because creatinine is neither reabsorbed nor secreted in the tubules, a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate causes a minor increase in serum creatinine. The disproportionate increase in the blood urea nitrogen level over that of the serum creatinine is called prerenal azotemia.",

Risk factors: family history of disease Three cardinal findings: eczema, recurrent infections, thrombocytopenia (can see petechiae/bruises) Eczema Eczema in a patient with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (source) HOW DO WE CONFIRM A DIAGNOSIS? Blood serology: will demonstrate low platelet counts and low lymphocytes. Decreased/normal IgG/IgM Increased IgE and IgA Genetic testing: can demonstrate causal mutation. HOW DO WE TREAT IT? Hematopoietic cell transplant: is at present the only curative treatment, with excellent results for patients with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched family or unrelated donors (URDs) or partially matched cord-blood donors. IVIG: can be used for temporary treatment. Antibiotics used for current infections. HOW WELL DO THE PATIENTS DO? Life expectancy of patients with classic WAS is reduced, with premature death resulting from infections, hemorrhage, autoimmune disease, and malignancies. Bleeding is the main cause of death. Malignancies in patients with classic WAS are often fatal WAS THERE A WAY TO PREVENT IT? No, this genetic condition is not preventable. WHAT ELSE ARE WE WORRIED ABOUT?

        "exp": "Ans: C (Pulmonary arterial hypertension) Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology, 21st ed, and Medical Physiology: Principles for Clinical Medicine by Rhoades RA 4th edition, pg 396 Explanation: \"Although the body undergoes many beneficial changes that allow acclimatization to high altitude, there are some undesirable effects. One of these is pulmonary hypertension (abnormally high pulmonary arterial blood pressure). Alveolar hypoxia causes pulmonary vasoconstriction. Remember that regional hypoxia redirects blood away from poorly ventilated regions in the lung without any change in pulmonary pressure. However, with generalized hypoxia, pulmonary pressure rises because all the preafveolar vessels constrict. In addition, prolonged hypoxia causes vascular remodeling in which pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The vascular remodeling results in narrowing of the small pulmonary arteries and increases pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to a further significant increase in pulmonary vascular hypertension. '' Ref: Medical Physiology: Principles for Clinical Medicine by Rhoades RA, 4th edition, pg 396 Changes Seen in High Altitude Acclimatization Respiratory alkalosis produced by the hyperventilation shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left, but there is a concomitant. Increase in red blood cell 2, 3-DPG, which tends to decrease the O2 affinity of hemoglobin. The net effect is a small increase in P50. Erythropoietin secretion increases promptly on ascent to high altitude and then falls somewhat over the following 4 days as the ventilatory response increases and the arterial PO2 rises. The increase in circulating RBCs triggered by the erythropoietin begins in 2-3 days and is sustained. | Alveolar PO2 | Hematocrit (Polycythemia) - | MCV and | MCHC. | RBC mass. | Concentration of capillaries in skeletal muscle tissue. | Myoglobin (Facilitates movement of O2 in tissues) | Mitochondria (the site of oxidative reactions). | Tissue cytochrome oxidase. | Aerobic enzyme concentration. | 2, 3-BPG. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension, Right ventricular hypertrophy. Also Note: Hypoxic hypoxia is a problem in normal individuals at high altitudes In high altitudes, the composition of air stays the same, but the total barometric pressure falls with increasing altitude. Therefore, the PO2 also falls. At 3000 m (approximately 10, 000 ft) above sea level, the alveolar PO2 is about 60 mm. Hg and there is enough hypoxic stimulation of the chemoreceptors to definitely increase ventilation. As one ascends higher, the alveolar PO2 falls less rapidly and the alveolar PCO2 declines somewhat because of the hyperventilation. The resulting fall in arterial PCO2 produces respiratory alkalosis. Manifestations in unacclimatized subjects: o c At 3700 m - Mental symptoms o At 5500 m - Hypoxic symptoms o At above 6100 m (20, 000 ft) - Unconsciousness and death. Acute \"Transient\" Mountain Sickness Occurs when unacclimatized persons first arrive at a high altitude. This syndrome develops 8-24 hours after arrival and lasts 4-8 days. It is characterized by headache, irritability, insomnia, breathlessness, and nausea and vomiting. Associated with cerebral edema. The low PO2 at high altitude causes arteriolar dilation, and if cerebral auto regulation does not compensate, there is an increase in capillary pressure that favors increased transudetion of fluid into brain tissue. Decreased urine output (Normally diuresis is seen at high altitude). High-altitude cerebral edema The capillary leakage in mountain sickness progresses to frank brain swelling, with ataxia, disorientation, and in some cases coma and death due to herniation of the brain through the tentorium. High-altitude pulmonary edema. It is a patchy edema of the lungs that is related to the marked pulmonary hypertension that develops at high altitude. Treatment of High Altitude illness All forms of high-altitude illness are benefited by: Descent to a lower altitude. Diuretic acetazolamide - This drug inhibits carbonic anhydrase. producing increased HCO3- excretion in the urine, stimulating respiration, increasing Pa. CO2. and reducing CSF formation. Oxygen supplementation / Hyperbaric chamber (Pulmonary edema). Glucocorticoids (Cerebral edema). Nifedipine can lower pulmonary artery pressure.

Retinal detachment is best examined by indirect ophthalmoscopy using scleral indentation. Freshly detached retina gives grey reflex instead of normal pink reflex, and is raised anteriorly. Retinal breaks (in Rhegmatogenous RD ) may be seen, mostly in the periphery (commonest in upper temporal quadrant). Vitreous show pigment in the anterior vitreous (tobacco dusting or Schaffer's sign.), with posterior vitreous detachment. ii) Perimetry (visual field charting): Visual field defect corresponding to the area of detached retina, in) Goldmann three-mirror fundus lens and Indirect slit lamp biomicroscopy by high power lenses (commonly + 90 D or + 78D).

Indications * As an alternative to intubation where difficult intubation is anticipated * Securing airway in an emergency where intubation and mask ventilation is not possible. * As an elective method for minor surgeries where anesthetist wants to avoid intubation. * As a conduit for bronchoscopes, small size tubes, gum elastic bougies. Advantages * Easy to insert (even paramedical staff can insert]. * Does not require any laryngoscope and muscle relaxants. * Does not require any specific position of cervical spine so can be used in cervical injuries. Disadvantages * It does not prevent aspiration so should not be used for full stomach patients. * High incidence of laryngospasm and bronchospasm.

Adjustment disorder as reactive depression as it's in reaction to stress in life. Double depression is Dysthymia plus depression. Persistent depressive disorder is in DSM-5 any depression more the 2 years so both Dysthymia and Double Depression will fall under this. Chronic depression any Depression more than 2 years this will also know fall under Persistent depressive disorder. In ICD-10 Cyclothymia and Dysthymia are classified as persistent depressive disorder. Double depression is a complication of a psychiatric illness called dysthymic disorder, or dysthymia. Dysthymia is a chronic, depressed mood accompanied by just one or two other symptoms of clinical depression (such as low energy or low self-esteem) that lasts at least two years in adults (or one year in kids). This low, dark mood -- sometimes described as a \"veil of sadness\" -- occurs nearly every day and can sometimes persist for many years. Some people may have this mood disorder for 10 to 20 years or even more before seeking treatment. Over time, more than half of people with dysthymia experience worsening symptoms that lead to the onset of a full syndrome of major depression superimposed on their dysthymic disorder. This is known as double depression. Persistent mood disorder o Mood disorders may run a chronic course over years with fluctuation of mood interposed with symptom free intervals. If symptoms persist for more than 2 years, they are referred to as persistent mood disorders. Two most important persistant mood disorders are Cyclothymia It is a subdued version of bipolar disorder, characterized by episodes of depression and hypomania that never have sufficient intensity to meet full diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder. Dysthemia Long standing (persistent, i. e., 2 years) mild depression which is not severe enough to meet full diagnostic criteria for major depression. Symptoms are more prominent than signs (more subjective than objective depression). This means that disturbances in appetite and libido are uncharacteristic, and psychomotor agitation or retardation is not observed. Kaplan & Sadock's Synopsis Of Psychiatry -11E = In DSM-5, cyclothymic disorder is defined as a \"chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance\" with many periods of hypomania and of depression. The disorder is differentiated from bipolar II disorder, which is characterized by the presence of major (not minor) depressive and hypomanic episodes. As with dysthymia, the inclusion of cyclothymic disorder with the mood disorders implies a relation, probably biological, to bipolar I disorder. Some psychiatrists, however, consider cyclothymic disorder to have no biological component and to result from chaotic object relations early in life.",

Children suspected of having cholera or have profuse watery diarrhoea should be given standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution that is normally made, i. e. not further diluted. * standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (75 mmol/L sodium) should not be used ************* This is a summary of one of several WHO recommendations on the management of SAM in infants and children. The full set of recommendations can be found in 'Full set of recommendations' and in the guidelines and guidance documents under 'WHO documents' below. Full set of recommendations Ref 2- Fluid management in children with severe malnutrition and dehydration without shock 1. Children with severe acute malnutrition who present with some dehydration or severe dehydration but who are not shocked should be rehydrated slowly, either orally or by nasogastric tube, using oral rehydration solution for malnourished children** (5-10 mL/kg/h up to a maximum of 12 h). 2. Full-strength, standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (75 mmol/L sodium) should not be used for oral or nasogastric rehydration in children with severe acute malnutrition who present with some dehydration or severe dehydration. Either Re. So. Mal*** or half-strength standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution should be given, with added potassium and glucose, unless the child has cholera or profuse watery diarrhoea. Dissolve one sachet of standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution in 2 L water (instead of 1 L). Add 1 level scoop of commercially available combined minerals and vitamins mix1 or 40 mL of mineral mix solution (5), and add and dissolve 50 g of sugar. In some countries, sachets are available that are designed to make 500 mL of standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution. In this situation, dilution can be revised to add 1 L. 3. Re. So. Mal (or locally prepared Re. So. Mal using standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution) should not be given if children are suspected of having cholera or have profuse watery diarrhoea.**** Such children should be given standard WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution that is normally made, i. e. not further diluted. Additionally (2-6): children with severe acute malnutrition and who have some or severe dehydration but no shock should receive 5 mL/kg Re. So. Mal every 30 min for the first 2 h. Then, if the child is still dehydrated, 5-10 mL/kg/h Re. So. Mal should be given in alternate hours with F-75, up to a maximum of 10 h; signs of improved hydration status and overhydration should be checked every half hour for the first 2 h, then hourly; Re. So. Mal can either be prepared from a ready-to-dilute sachet (as per supplier's instructions) or prepared with one sachet of WHO low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution plus 2 L of water with an added 50 g sugar and 40 mL mineral mix or one level scoop of combined minerals and vitamins; zinc (10-20 mg per day) should be given to all children as soon as the duration and severity of the episodes of diarrhoea start to reduce, thereby reducing the risk of dehydration. By continuing supplemental zinc for 10-14 days, this will also reduce the risk of new episodes of diarrhoea in the following 2-3 months. (Note, WHO-recommended therapeutic foods already contain adequate zinc, and children with severe acute malnutrition receiving F-75, F-100 or ready-to-use therapeutic food should not therefore receive additional zinc). Fluid management of children with severe acute malnutrition and shock 4. Children with severe acute malnutrition and signs of shock or severe dehydration and who cannot be rehydrated orally or by nasogastric tube should be treated with intravenous fluids, either: half-strength Darrow's solution with 5% dextrose, or Ringer's lactate solution with 5% dextrose. If neither is available, 0. 45% saline + 5% dextrose should be used. Additionally (2-6): the general principles of resuscitation, in particular providing oxygen and improving breathing, similarly apply to children with severe acute malnutrition; the only indication for intravenous infusion in a child with severe acute malnutrition is circulatory collapse caused by severe dehydration or septic shock when the child is lethargic or unconscious (excluding cardiogenic shock); all children with severe acute malnutrition with signs of shock with lethargy or unconsciousness should be treated for septic shock. This includes especially children with signs of dehydration but no history of watery diarrhoea, children with hypothermia or hypoglycaemia, and children with both oedema and signs of dehydration; in case of shock with lethargy or unconsciousness, intravenous rehydration should begin immediately, using 15 mL/kg/h of one of the recommended fluids; it is important that the child is carefully monitored every 5-10 min for signs of overhydration and signs of congestive heart failure. If signs of overhydration and congestive heart failure develop, intravenous therapy should be stopped immediately; if a child with severe acute malnutrition presenting with shock does not improve after 1 h of intravenous therapy, a blood transfusion (10 mL/kg slowly over at least 3 h) should be given; children with severe acute malnutrition should be given blood if they present with severe anemia, i. e. Hb <4 g or > 6g with signs of respiratory distress blood transfusions should only be given to children with severe acute malnutrition within the first 24 h of admission. * This is an extract from relevant guidelines and guidance documents as listed in 'References'. Additional guidance information can be found in these documents. ** A specific electrolyte-micronutrient product formulated according to WHO specifications for use in the management of children with severe acute malnutrition. *** Re. So. Mal is a powder for the preparation of an oral rehydration solution exclusively for oral or nasogastric rehydration of people suffering from severe acute malnutrition. It must be used exclusively under medical supervision in inpatient care, and must not be given for free use to the mother or caregiver. **** Three or more loose or watery stools in a day, for more than 14 days.

Mottling is best seen on the incisors of the upper jaw. # Skeletal Fluorosis/ Genu valgum: Lifetime daily intake of 3. 0-6. 0 mg/L or more. # Prevention: Changing the water source. # Nalgonda technique for defluoridation of water. The presence of following chemicals in excess of prescribed limits may constitute ground for rejection of the water as a source of public water supply: # Inorganic constituents: - Arsenic: recommended maximum limit of the concentration is 0. 01 mg/L. - Cadmium 0. 003 mg/L maximum limit. - Chromium - Cyanide: maximum limit 0. 07 mg/L. - Fluoride should not be more than 1. 5 mg/L - Lead - Mercury: 0. 001 mg/L minimum upper limit. Bacterial plate count on yeast extract agar after incubation at 22degC for 7 days might serve as the best general-purpose indicator of microbiological quality. - Selenium - Nitrite and Nitrate: When nitrate level in drinking water exceeds 50 mg/L, methemoglobinemia may occur; most susceptible are bottle-fed infants of less than 3 months.

Recrudescence of infection more in primigravidae Effect of malaria on pregnancy and fetus - Abortion, preterm labor, IUGR, IUD, LBW, Increased maternal mortality and morbidity. Ref- Malaria in pregnant women Last update: 25 May 2017 Malaria infection during pregnancy is a significant public health problem with substantial risks for the pregnant woman, her fetus, and the newborn child. Malaria-associated maternal illness and low birth weight is mostly the result of Plasmodium falciparum infection and occurs predominantly in Africa. The symptoms and complications of malaria in pregnancy vary according to malaria transmission intensity in the given geographical area, and the individual's level of acquired immunity. High-transmission settings In high-transmission settings, where levels of acquired immunity tend to be high, P. falciparum infection is usually asymptomatic in pregnancy. Yet, parasites may be present in the placenta and contribute to maternal anemia even in the absence of documented peripheral parasitaemia. Both maternal anemia and placental parasitaemia can lead to low birth weight, which is an important contributor to infant mortality. In high-transmission settings, the adverse effects of P. falciparum infection in pregnancy are most pronounced for women in their first pregnancy. Low-transmission settings In low-transmission settings, where women of reproductive age have relatively little-acquired immunity to malaria, malaria in pregnancy is associated with anemia, an increased risk of severe malaria, and it may lead to spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, prematurity and low birth weight. In such settings, all pregnant women, regardless of the number of times they have been pregnant, are highly vulnerable to malaria. Infections with P. vivax Infection with P. vivax, as with P. falciparum, leads to chronic anemia and placental malaria infection, reducing the birth weight and increasing the risk of neonatal death. For women in their first pregnancy, the reduction in birth weight is approximately two-thirds of what is associated with P. falciparum, but with P. vivax the effect appears to increase with successive pregnancies. WHO recommends the following package of interventions for the prevention and treatment of malaria during pregnancy: use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs); in all areas with moderate to high malaria transmission in Africa, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), as part of antenatal care services; prompt diagnosis and effective treatment of malaria infections. Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy IPTp reduces maternal malaria episodes, maternal and fetal anemia, placental parasitemia, low birth weight, and neonatal mortality. Furthermore, all pregnant women should receive iron and folic acid supplementation as a part of routine antenatal care.",

The Golden S sign can be seen on plain radiographs as well as on computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest.

        "question": "The concentration of adrenaline in ACLS/Cardiac Arrest Resuscitation is -",
        "exp": "Ans- D Epinephrine is a commonly used medication in the emergency department for the management of anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest. Administering this drug can be confusing as the dosage and concentration are different for each indication. The \"allergy epi\" 1: 1000 concentration is 10 times more concentrated than the \"cardiac epi\". The \"allergy epi\" is delivered IM while the \"cardiac epi\" is delivered IV. This difference leads to an increased risk of error as the incorrect epinephrine dosage, concentration, or route can have disastrous consequences for patients including coronary dissection, infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias (1-3). Here is a little saying to easily remember the dosage and concentration of epinephrine in both anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest... Anaphylaxis and Epinephrine Dosage LESS (volume) is MORE (concentrated) Less (0. 5cc) is More (1: 1000) Use 1/2 ml of 1: 1000 epinephrine and deliver it into the muscle (IM). This will deliver a total of 0. 5mg of epinephrine IM. Cardiac Arrest and Epinephrine Dosage MORE (volume) is LESS (concentrated) More (10cc) is Less (1: 10, 000) Use 10cc of 1: 10, 000 epinephrine and give it intravenously (IV). This will deliver 1mg of epinephrine IV. References Kanwar M, Irvin CB, Frank JJ, et al. Confusion about epinephrine dosing leading to iatrogenic overdose: a life-threatening problem with a potential solution. Ann Emerg Med. 2010. Apr; 55(4): 341-4 Wood JP, Traub SJ, Lipinski C. Safety of epinephrine for anaphylaxis in the emergency setting. World J Emerg Med. 2013; 4(4): 245-51 Campbell RL, Bellolio MF, Kuntson BD, et al. Epinephrine in anaphylaxis: higher risk of cardiovascular complications and overdose after administration of intravenous bolus epinephrine compared with intramuscular epinephrine. J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract. 2015 Jan-Feb; 3(1): 76-80 Epinephrine is the primary drug used in the cardiac arrest algorithm. It is used for its potent vasoconstrictive effects and also for its ability to increase cardiac output. Epinephrine is considered a vasopressor. Indications for ACLS Vasoconstriction effects: epinephrine binds directly to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors of the blood vessels (arteries and veins) causing direct vasoconstriction, thus, improving perfusion pressure to the brain and heart. Cardiac Output: epinephrine also binds to beta-1-adrenergic receptors of the heart. This indirectly improves cardiac output by: Increasing heart rate Increasing heart muscle contractility Increasing conductivity through the AV node Epinephrine is used in the cardiac arrest algorithm as a direct IV push and also in the bradycardia algorithm as an infusion. See the respective algorithm pages for more information about their use in each. Routes During ACLS, epinephrine can be given 3 ways: intravenous; intraosseous, and endotracheal tube Dosing Intravenous Push/IO: 1mg epinephrine IV is given every 3-5 minutes. IV infusion for bradycardia: 1mg epinephrine is mixed with 500ml of NS or D5W. The infusion should run at 2-10 micrograms/min (titrated to effect). IV infusion for post-cardiac arrest hypotension: The dosing is 0. 1-0. 5 mcg/kg/min (for example a 70kg adult: 7-35 mcg/min would be given). Endotracheal Tube: 2-2. 5mg epinephrine is diluted in 10cc NS and given directly into the ET tube. Epinephrine should be used with caution in patients suffering from myocardial infarction since epinephrine increases heart rate and raises blood pressure. This increase in HR and BP can increase myocardial oxygen demand and worsen ischemia. Note: There is no clinical evidence that the use of epinephrine, when used during cardiac arrest, increases rates of survival to discharge from the hospital. However, studies have shown that epinephrine and vasopressin improve rates of ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation). Adult Basic Life Support Algorithm for Healthcare Providers In the algorithm for adult basic life support, emphasis is placed upon immediate recognition of cardiac arrest and the implementation of efficient compressions and early defibrillation. To immediately recognize cardiac arrest, the healthcare provider is trained to assess for unresponsiveness and/or an absence of breathing or presence of abnormal breath sounds. Laypersons should be instructed to use hands-only CPR. This approach calls for continuous compressions at a rate of 100-120 per minute. CPR should be continued by a healthcare provider until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or until termination of efforts. High quality CPR emphasizes adequate depth and number of chest compressions. The pulse check has been deemphasized, and the guidelines recommend a pulse check for no less than 5 seconds and no more than 10 seconds. An integrated team approach includes simultaneous compressions and rescue breathing. Rhythm detection should take place as soon as an AED or defibrillator is available, with subsequent shock, as indicated, as the survival rate from ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia ranges from 5% to 50%, and decreases with an increase in the length of time to the first shock. When a victim is unresponsive to a tap on the chest (ask \"Are you ok? \"), then the healthcare provider should observe the victim for breathing for 5 to 10 seconds. If respirations are present, the victim should be attached to a cardiac monitor. Otherwise, the healthcare provider (HCP) should activate EMS and retrieve the AED by himself or by sending a second rescuer. The pulse check is the third step in the algorithm. The pulse should be checked for no less than 5 seconds and no more than 10 seconds. If there is a definite pulse, then rescue breathing should be done for one second every six seconds with a recheck every 2 minutes. If the victim does not have a pulse, or there is a question as to whether it is present, then compressions should be initiated at the rate of 30: 2, with 2 breaths every 30 compressions. Compressions should be provided at a rate of 100-120/min. When the AED or defibrillator is available, then the HCP should check the victim's rhythm. If it is shockable, then 1 shock should be given with immediate CPR instituted for 2 minutes, beginning rapidly (within seconds) of the shock. If the rhythm is not shockable, then the HCP should administer CPR for 2 minutes and recheck the rhythm every 2 minutes. Continue CPR until ALS is available. High quality chest compressions: Position patient on hard surface in supine position Minimal interruptions for ventilation 18 seconds per cycle Adequate speed of compressions: >100/minute Adequate depth of compressions: 2-2. 4\" (5-6cm) Allow complete recoil of chest Do not over ventilate Breathing devices include a ONE WAY VALVE FACE MASK. Deliver breath over one second. Watch the chest rise. A BAG VALVE MASK is an additional device to deliver breaths. Hold the mask in place with the EC clamp technique and lift the jaw to open the airway. Squeeze the bag for one second while watching for the rise and fall of the chest.

Shout for nearby help/activate the resuscitation team; can activate the resuscitation team at this time or after checking breathing and pulse. 4 Follow the dispatcher's instructions. Check for no breathing or only gasping; if none, begin CPR with compressions. Check for no breathing or only gasping and check pulse (ideally simultaneously). Activation and retrieval of the AED/emergency equipment by either the lone healthcare provider or by the second person sent by the rescuer must occur no later than immediately after the check for no normal breathing and no pulse identifies cardiac arrest. 5 Look for no breathing or only gasping, at the direction of the dispatcher. Answer the dispatcher's questions, and follow the dispatcher's instructions. Immediately begin CPR, and use the AED/ defibrillator when available. 6 Follow the dispatcher's instructions. Send the second person to retrieve an AED, if one is available. When the second rescuer arrives, provide 2-person CPR and use AED/defibrillator. AED indicates automated external defibrillator; and CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation.",

Similarly, glycosuria may have renal as well as endocrinologic causes. Therefore, these two conditions cannot be considered diagnostic of diabetes. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed in women between the twenty-fourth and twenty-eighth weeks of gestation, first using a 50-g oral glucose load if the I-h glucose level >7. 8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL); a 100-g oral glucose test is performed after an overnight fast.

Like Atrial natriuretic peptide it is degraded by neutral endopeptidase. Atrial natriuretic peptide: Atrial natriuretic factor (ANP) is a hormone released by atrial walls of the heart when they become stretched. Because in heart failure, there is an almost always excessive increase in both the right and left atrial pressures that stretch the atrial walls the circulating levels of ANP in the blood increase fivefold to tenfold in severe heart failure. The ANF, in turn, has a direct effect on the kidneys to increase greatly their excretion of salt and water. Therefore ANP plays a natural role to prevent the extreme congestive symptoms of cardiac failure. But the other factors promoting cardiac decompensation quickly overrides this ANP effect. More on the physiological properties of ANP: Circulating ANP has a short half-life. Their steady level in blood is maintained by clearance receptors.

However, there are four muscle proteins involved in the process: - Actin, Myosin, Tropomyosin, and troponin. Myosin Myosin is the protein that constitutes the thick filaments. Myosin of skeletal muscle is myosin-II. Myosin participates in the contractile mechanism and also acts as an ATPaseQ Actin Actin is the major protein of thin filamentQ. It is the actin which slides over myosin during contraction. Tropomyosin It is the other protein of thin filamentQ. It covers the active sites (myosin binding sites) on actinQ. When Ca+2 concentration of cytoplasm (sarcoplasm) is raised, it uncovers the active sites of actin and allows the contraction So, the 'cross-bridge cycling' is switched off or on by the tropomyosin molecule which slides on the actin molecule to cover or uncover the active sites on it. Troponin It is a protein also associated with thin filamentQ. The regulatory action of Ca+2 on tropomysin is mediated by troponin, a Ca+2 binding protein. When the cytoplasmic (sarcoplasmic) Ca+2 concentration rises Ca+2 ions bind to troponin-C. The troponin - Ca+2 complex induces changes in Troponin-I and Troponin-T, which in turn brings about a shift of tropomyosin away from the active sites of actin. When the sarcoplasmic Ca+2 concentration falls, Ca+2: dissociates from troponin-C and tropomyosin slides back on the actin filament to cover the active sites. Thus, the first event during muscle contraction, after the cytoplasmic rise in Ca+2 concentration, is binding of troponin C to Ca+2 which trigers the further steps by sliding the tropomyosin from the active sites of actinQ.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Alveolar duct. Respiratory tract anatomyo Nasal cavity, oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx form upper respiratory tract. Larynx opens into lower respiratory tract which starts from Trachea. Trachea bifurcates into bronchi (principal bronchi). Progressive branching of bronchi forms bronchioles. Further branching of bronchioles leads to terminal bronchioles. Terminal bronchiole emanate into respiratory bronchioles. Respiratory bronchioles proceed into the alveolar ducts, which immediately branch into alveolar sacs (alveoli). o The part of lung distal to the terminal bronchiole is called acinus, i. e., respiratory bronchiole, alveolar duct and alveolar sac. A cluster of three to five terminal bronchioles, each with its appended acinus, is usually referred to as pulmonary lobule. So, pulmonary lobules include a cluster of three to five terminal bronchioles with its respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs. o Terminal bronchioles contain Clara cells which secrete a protein that lines the small air passages. Alveoli (alveolar sac) are lined by type 1 pneumocytes (95%) and type 2pneumocytes (5%). Type 2pneumocytes secrete surfactant and also helps in repair of alveoli after the destruction of type-1 pneumocytes. Pores of Kohn are present in the alveolar wall to allow passage of bacteria and exudate between adjacent alveoli. o The respiratory tract is lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium, except vocal cord, which is lined by stratified squamous epithelium. o Terminal bronchi contain maximum smooth muscle cells relative to wall thickness. o Cartilage is found in larynx, trachea, and bronchi but not in bronchioles.",

Also, check APPENDIX-3 below for a list of \"Gait abnormalities\"CLINICAL TESTING OF GLUTEUS MEDIUS AND MINIMUS:\"Sufferers from unilateral paralysis of gluteus medius and minimus have a characteristic lurching gait\". Hip girdle muscles are responsible for keeping the pelvis level when walking. Weakness on one side will lead to a drop in the pelvis on the contralateral side of the pelvis while walking (Trendelenburg sign, lurching gait). With bilateral weakness, there will be dropping of the pelvis on both sides during walking leading to waddling. This gait is seen in a patient with bilateral superior gluteal nerve injury and myopathies, such as muscular dystrophy. Positive Trendelenburg's sign due to Injury to Superior Gluteal Nerve: The Trendelenburg's sign is said to be positive if, when standing on one leg, the pelvis drops on the side opposite to the stance leg. The weakness is present on the side of the stance leg. The body is not able to maintain the center of gravity on the side of the stance leg. Normally, the body shifts the weight to the stance leg, allowing the shift of the center of gravity and consequently stabilizing or balancing the body. However, in unilateral superior gluteal nerve injury, when the patient lifts the opposing leg, the shift is not created and the patient cannot maintain balance leading to instability (Lurching gait). Bilateral superior gluteal nerve injury results in a waddling gait. NOTE: Not to be confused with Trendelenburg's sign. The Trendelenburg Test or Brodie-Trendelenburg test is a test which can be carried out as part of a physical examination to determine the competency of the valves in the superficial and deep veins of the legs in patients with varicose veins. APPENDIX - 3. Gait. Also Known as. Description. Found In. Hemiparetic gait. Circumduction gait, Pyramidal gait. Mild cases: the only indication of paresis may be that the ball/heel of the shoe may be worn more on the affected side. Hemiplegia (upper motor neuron disease). Severe cases: knee extended, ankle plantarflexed. The patient therefore circumducts the affected leg to ambulate Ataxic gait.

As there are definite genetic factors at play, multiple factors are likely to contribute 1. Incidence is higher in people with first degree relatives having IBD, reaching up to 10%. Also, there has been shown 30-50% chance of developing the disease in mono- or heterozygous twins. Initially, the disease is limited to the mucosa with neutrophilic cryptitis and lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphoedema and shallow aphthoid ulceration. As the disease progresses, the entire bowel wall becomes involved, with linear longitudinal and circumferential ulcers extending deep into the bowel wall, predisposing to fistulae. Inflammation also extends into the mesentery and over time leads to chronic fibrotic change, and stricture formation 5. Anywhere along the digestive tract, including mouth and oesophagus mucogingivitis, mucosal tags, deep ulceration, cobblestoning, lip swelling and pyostomatitis vegetans, oesophageal ulcers and strictures Extraintestinal manifestations include 3, 15-17: skin erythema nodosum pyoderma gangrenosum joints arthritis seronegative spondyloarthritis sacroiliitis (one of the most frequent extraintestinal manifestations) eyes episcleritis iritis uveitis (acute anterior uveitis) liver and biliary system pericholangitis primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) (more common in ulcerative colitis) autoimmune hepatitis cirrhosis gallstones: seen in 30-50% 8 hepatic abscess 8 pancreatitis renal tract renal calculi containing oxalate. The poor fat absorption results in binding of calcium by fats, which in turn reduces the amount of calcium that can bind to oxalate, therefore increasing the amount of unbound oxalate available for resorption; this resorption occurs in the colon, and therefore patients with an ileostomy do not have the same increased risk pulmonary and thoracic associations bronchiectasis, mosaic perfusion, and air trapping chronic bronchitis, interstitial lung disease, cryptogenic organising pneumonia, necrobiotic nodules 30 Radiographic features The characteristic of Crohn disease is the presence of skip lesions and presence of discrete ulcers. The frequency with which various parts of the gastrointestinal tract are affected varies widely 5: small bowel: 70-80% 5, 6 small and large bowel: 50% large bowel only: 15-20% The choice of investigation modality depends on local expertise and availability. CT and MR enteroclysis are similar in sensitivity for active inflammation (89% vs 83% respectively) and both are somewhat better than small bowel follow-through (67-72%) 6. The lack of ionising radiation from MRI would make it a better option, however, the availability of MRI is limited in many countries. Ultrasound is also an option for diagnosing active disease, follow-up and assessing complications 20. Reported sensitivity 75-94% and specificity 67-100% 20. Fluoroscopy Features on barium small bowel follow-through include: mucosal ulcers aphthous ulcers initially deep ulcers (>3 mm depth) longitudinal fissures transverse stripes when severe leads to cobblestone appearance may lead to sinus tracts and fistulae widely separated loops of bowel due to fibrofatty proliferation (creeping fat) 2 thickened folds due to oedema pseudodiverticula formation: due to contraction at the site of ulcer with ballooning of the opposite site string sign: tubular narrowing due to spasm or stricture depending on the chronicity partial obstruction on control films presence of gallstones, renal oxalate stones, and sacroiliac joint or lumbosacral spine changes should be sought Ultrasound Ultrasound has a limited role, but due to it being cheap and available and not involving ionising radiation, it has been evaluated as an initial screening tool for active disease and also for follow-up and to assess complications 4, 20. Typically examination is limited to the small bowel and wall thickness assessed: bowel wall thickness should be <3 mm The usefulness of this finding needs to be interpreted in the context of pretest probability (i. e. thickness of less than 3 mm helps exclude the disease in a low-risk patient, and a thickness of greater than 4 mm helps establish the diagnosis in a high-risk patient) 4. As it has difficulty examining the whole bowel, it is not appropriate as a true diagnostic test. On Doppler evaluation, increased superior mesenteric artery (SMA) flow volume and decreased SMA resistive index (SMA RI) also correlate with disease activity. Successful treatment may result in the normalisation of these imaging parameters 12. Other features on ultrasound 20: non-compressible, rigid, fixed bowel wall perienteric fluid creeping fat - echogenic area (representing proliferation of adipose tissue that extends around active inflammation) separating bowel loops gut signature - lost or preserved strictures - fibrotic (maintains gut signature) or inflammatory (loss of gut signature) abscess fistula Ultrasound does, of course, have a significant role to play in the assessment of: perianal disease: rectal ultrasound, endoanal ultrasound hepatobiliary disease CT CT examination can be carried out with both intravenous and intraluminal contrast (positive or negative) 5: fat halo sign comb sign bowel wall enhancement bowel wall thickening (1-2 cm) which is most frequently seen in the terminal ileum (present in up to 83% of patients) 8 strictures and fistulae mesenteric/intra-abdominal abscess or phlegmon formation 8 abscesses are eventually seen in 15-20% of patients 8 CT is also able to give valuable information on: perianal disease hepatobiliary disease MRI MRI enterography has no ionising radiation and an ability to evaluate both mural and extramural involvement. It has become an increasingly important part of the management of patients with Crohn disease. MRI enteroclysis may be attempted in select patients. MR enterography MR enterography can be a useful technique for evaluation of the bowel. Inflamed loops of bowel demonstrate thickening >3 mm and increased mural contrast enhancement 22. Increased T2W signal in the thickened bowel wall is particularly helpful in evaluating for acute inflammation 25. Extramural disease is where MRI excels: fibrofatty proliferation thickening of extramural fat, which separates bowel loops equivalent to the fat halo sign on CT vascular engorgement: comb sign stenoses and strictures Coronal cine sequences (b. SSFP) can also be useful in diagnosis. Inflamed loops of bowel frequently demonstrate decreased peristalsis. MRI enteroclysis MRI enteroclysis requires the placement of a nasojejunal catheter through which 1. 5-2 L of contrast solution (e. g. water with polyethylene glycol and electrolytes) are injected 2. Spatial resolution is not as good as with conventional fluoroscopic enteroclysis, and thus minor mucosal changes are not apparent. When the disease is transmural, with cobblestone appearance, the abnormalities are evident as high T2 signal linear regions, provided adequate distension is achieved 2. Standard MRI Standard MRI can also give valuable information: perianal disease hepatobiliary disease sacroiliac joints, spine and large joints Treatment and prognosis Management is complex as the condition is chronic with a relapsing-remitting course. Medical management includes corticosteroids, 5-ASA preparations, immunomodulation (e. g. azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate) 7. Surgical management is reserved for complications including: strictures adhesions and bowel obstructions fistulae perianal disease perianal fistula perianal abscess History and etymology It is named after Burrill Bernard Crohn (1884-1983), an American gastroenterologist, who described the condition as 'regional ileitis' in his seminal 1932 paper 11, 24. However, the first definite description (but see below) was nearly twenty years prior, by Sir T (Thomas) Kennedy Dalziel (1861-1924), a Scottish surgeon, in 1913 21, 23. Antoni Lesniowski (1867-1940), a Polish surgeon, described a small bowel condition in 1904 in a small series of four patients, with similarities to Crohn disease, although it remains controversial if it was actually Crohn's 27, 28. At least one of the patients probably actually had ileal tuberculosis. Nevertheless Polish physicians and journals usually call the condition Lesniowski-Crohn disease. Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis depends on the presenting symptom. When terminal ileitis is the main presentation, then differentials (adjusted for patient's age) include 1: acute appendicitis Yersinia ileitis mesenteric adenitis ileocaecal tuberculosis 9 malignancy When colonic involvement is the predominant feature then other considerations include: ulcerative colitis acute diverticulitis acute epiploic appendagitis ischaemic colitis pseudomembranous colitis infectious colitis",

        "question": "Component of ART given to the mother in the prevention of mother to child transmission -",
        "exp": "Ans- D Tenofovir, efavirenz and lamivudine Ref 1 - The current WHO guidelines of June 2013 recommends two options for PPTCT: (i) provision of lifelong ART to all the pregnant and breast feeding women living with HIV regardless of CD4 count or clinical stage (earlier called Option B+) or (ii) provision of ART during pregnancy and breast feeding and thereafter providing ART as indicated. 8 Having gone through 30 years of the global AIDS epidemic, it is now felt that, despite hindrance, PPTCT of HIV can be considered as a realistic public health goal. Government of India is committed to working towards achievement of the global target of \"elimination of new HIV infections among children\" by 2015 and has decided to adopt the first option i. e lifelong ART (triple drug regime) irrespective of CD4 count or WHO clinical staging. 9 This, in turn, is expected to help maximise the coverage to those needing treatment, avoiding the need for starting ART in future pregnancies, provide protection against parent-to-child transmission in future pregnancies and avoid drug resistance. These guidelines have been implemented across the country from 1st January 2014. The aim is to ensure integrated PPTCT services within the existing Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) programme. 5 The recommended first-line regimen for HIV infected pregnant women is Tenofovir (TDF) (300 mg) + Lamivudine (3. TC) (300 mg) + Efavirenz (EFV) (600 mg) at any gestational age. Further, as part of PPTCT, the infant also needs to be exposed to NVP for at least 06 weeks, but increased to 12 weeks in case the mother was started on ART late in her pregnancy. However, the last word has not been said and warnings about the use of Option/Plan B + are also being published. 10 Triple drug therapy decreases the viral load substantially, thus paving the way for normal delivery and breast feeding. The exclusive breast feeding is recommended by NACO to avoid chances of gastrointestinal infection and malnutrition. Vertical transmission of HIV from mother to the newborn generally occurs during contact of the foetus with vaginal secretion after rupture of amniotic membrane. Therefore elective caesarean section was considered an option for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. With decrease in viral load in vaginal secretions due to antenatal use of triple drug therapy, vaginal delivery is now considered safe and the caesarean section is recommended only for obstetric indications. Ref 2 - A comprehensive approach to PMTCT Effective PMTCT programmes require women and their infants to have access to - and to take up - a cascade of interventions including antenatal services and HIV testing during pregnancy; use of ART by pregnant women living with HIV; safe childbirth practices and appropriate infant feeding; uptake of infant HIV testing and other post-natal healthcare services. 4 The World Health Organization (WHO) promotes a comprehensive approach to PMTCT programmes which includes: preventing new HIV infections among women of childbearing age preventing unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV preventing HIV transmission from a woman living with HIV to her baby providing appropriate treatment, care and support to mothers living with HIV and their children and families. 5 World Health Organization PMTCT guidelines Guidelines for pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV WHO's 2013 guidelines recommended that a woman living with HIV only continue on ART after breastfeeding if it would benefit her own health. 6 However, in September 2015 the WHO released new guidelines recommending that all pregnant women living with HIV be immediately provided with lifelong treatment, regardless of CD4 count (which indicates the level of HIV in the body). This approach is called Option B+. 7 By 2015, the implementation of Option B+ had resulted in 91% of the 1. 1 million women receiving ARVs as part of PMTCT services being offered lifelong ART. 8 In resource-poor settings, when formula feeding is not a viable option, the WHO advises women living with HIV to exclusively breastfeed (rather than mixed feeding), providing that they are on ART. This is because, while formula feeding offers the safest option for postnatal HIV prevention, in resource poor settings it is not always easy for families to afford formula or access things such as clean water which are needed for it use. 9 Guidelines for HIV-exposed infants If an HIV-exposed infant is given ART within the first 12 weeks of life, they are 75% less likely to die from an AIDS related illness. 10 This is one of the reasons that WHO recommends that infants born to mothers living with HIV are tested between four and six weeks old. This is often referred to as 'early infant diagnosis'. 11 The WHO further recommends that another HIV test is carried out at 18 months and/or when breastfeeding ends to provide the final infant diagnosis. 12 According to WHO guidelines, all infants who test positive for HIV should be immediately initiated on treatment. The treatment should be linked to the mother's course of ARVs and would vary according to the infant feeding method as follows: breastfeeding - the infant should receive once-daily nevirapine from birth for six weeks replacement feeding - the infant should receive once-daily nevirapine (or twice-daily zidovudine) from birth for four to six weeks. 13 Global PMTCT targets In 2011, a Global Plan was launched to reduce the number of new HIV infections via mother-to-child transmission by 90% by 2015. 14 The WHO identified 22 priority countries, with the top 10 (Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana and India) accounting for 75% of the global PMTCT service need. It was estimated that the effective scaling up of interventions in these countries would prevent over 250, 000 new infections annually. 15",

        "question": "Treatment of cholera in pregnancy is -",
        "exp": "Ans-D Ref- Recommendations for the Use of Antibiotics for the Treatment of Cholera Summary Recommendations Oral or intravenous hydration is the mainstay of cholera treatment. In conjunction with hydration, treatment with antibiotics is recommended for severely ill patients. It is particularly recommended for patients who are severely or moderately dehydrated and continue to pass a large volume of stool during rehydration treatment. Antibiotic treatment is also recommended for all patients who are hospitalized. Antibiotic choices should be informed by local antibiotic susceptibility patterns. In most countries, Doxycycline is recommended as first-line treatment for adults, while azithromycin is recommended as first-line treatment for children and pregnant women. During an epidemic or outbreak, antibiotic susceptibility should be monitored through regular testing of sample isolates from various geographic areas. None of the guidelines recommend antibiotics as prophylaxis for cholera prevention, and all emphasize that antibiotics should be used in conjunction with aggressive hydration. Education of health care workers, assurance of adequate supplies, and monitoring of practices are all important for appropriate dispensation of antibiotics. Background Mainstay of cholera treatment is hydration Intravenous 1 and oral 2 hydration are both associated with greatly decreased mortality and remain the mainstay of treatment for cholera. Antibiotic effectiveness for the treatment of cholera Antibiotics have been used as an adjunct to hydration treatment for cholera since 1964. Findings from randomized controlled trials evaluated the effectiveness of selected antibiotics on three main outcomes: stool output, duration of diarrhea, and bacterial shedding. These studies compared outcomes for cholera patients who were given both intravenous (IV) fluids and antibiotic treatment with those given IV fluids only. Findings indicate that antibiotics reduced volume of stool output by 8-92%, duration of diarrhea by 50-56%, and duration of positive bacterial culture by 26-83% 3-7. Antibiotic use for moderately and severely ill patients is also likely to reduce resource requirements. By decreasing duration of diarrhea and stool volume, antibiotics result in more rapid recovery and shorter lengths of inpatient stay, both of which contribute to optimizing resource utilization in an outbreak setting. The majority of published studies exploring effectiveness of antibiotics for cholera patients have been done in patients who were adequately rehydrated. In these studies, there was no mortality and therefore the impact of antibiotics on mortality cannot be assessed. In the absence of adequate rehydration, antibiotics alone are not sufficient to prevent cholera mortality. Antibiotic regimens for the treatment of cholera Tetracycline has been shown to be effective treatment for cholera 2, 3 and is superior to furazolidone 8, cholamphenicol 9 and sulfaguanidine 9 in reducing cholera morbidity. Treatment with a single 300mg dose of doxycycline has shown to be equivalent to tetracycline treatment 10. Erythromycin is effective for cholera treatment, and appropriate for children and pregnant women 11. Orfloxacin 12, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 13, and ciprofloxacin 14 are effective, but doxycycline offers advantages related to ease of administration and comparable or superior effectiveness. Recently, azithromycin has been shown to be more effective than erythromycin and ciprofloxacin 15, 16 and is an appropriate first line regimen for children and pregnant women. Antibiotic resistance Resistance to tetracycline and other antimicrobial agents among V. cholerae has been demonstrated in both endemic and epidemic cholera settings. Resistance can be acquired through the accumulation of selected mutations over time, or the acquisition of genetic elements such as plasmids, introns, or conjugative elements, which confer rapid spread of resistance. A likely risk factor for antimicrobial resistance is widespread use of antibiotics, including mass distribution for prophylaxis in asymptomatic individuals. Antibiotic resistance emerged in previous epidemics in the context of antibiotic prophylaxis for household contacts of cholera patients 17, 18. Unanswered questions Inadequate information still exists with respect to antibiotics in the following areas: Effect of antibiotics on secondary transmission: There are insufficient data examining the effect of antibiotics on secondary transmission of cholera. However, in published studies to date antibiotics have not been shown to decrease secondary transmission of cholera within households 19, 20. Utility of antibiotics when aggressive rehydration is not possible: Because studies on antibiotic treatment for cholera were conducted in patients who received adequate rehydration, the effect of antibiotics in settings where this is not possible remains unclear. Summary of Antibiotic Treatment Guidelines Various organizations that participate in cholera responses recommend the use of antibiotics in cholera-infected patients with moderate or severe illness and who have begun IV hydration. None of the guidelines recommend antibiotics as prophylaxis for cholera prevention, and all emphasize that antibiotics should be used in conjunction with aggressive hydration. In addition, the guidelines recommend that antimicrobial susceptibility testing should inform local drug choices. Available guidelines are summarized below. Guidelines for Cholera Treatment with Antibiotics Organization Recommendation First-line drug choice Alternate drug choices Drug choices for special populations World Health Organization 21 Antibiotic treatment for cholera patients with severe dehydration only Doxycycline Tetracycline Erythromycin is recommended drug for children Pan American Health Organization 22 Antibiotic treatment for cholera patients with moderate or severe dehydration Doxycycline Ciprofloxacin Azithromycin Erythromycin or azithromycin recommended as first-line drugs for pregnant women and children Ciprofloxacin and doxycycline recommended as second-line drugs for children International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh23 Antibiotic treatment for cholera patients with some or severe dehydration Doxycycline Ciprofloxacin Azithromycin Cotrimoxazole Erythromycin recommended as first-line drug for children and pregnant women Medicins Sans Frontieres 24 Antibiotic treatment for severely dehydrated patients only Doxycycline Erythromycin Cotrimoxazole Chloramphenicol Furazolidone * Please note, due to space constraints, dosage information is not included in this table. Dosage guidance can be found by following the website links to the treatment guidance documents provided in the references section below 21-24. Considerations Over-emphasizing antibiotics for treatment of cholera could divert resources from oral and intravenous rehydration. Doxycycline costs approximately $0. 02 per 100mg tablet. Azithromycin costs approximately $0. 16 per 250mg tablet. Antibiotics can cause nausea and vomiting. Gastrointestinal side effects should be carefully monitored, especially in dehydrated patients. Antibiotics are not needed and should not be given to patients with cholera who have only mild or no diarrhea and dehydration. Prospective surveillance for antibiotic resistance among bacterial isolates from any outbreak is essential for understanding and minimizing the spread of resistance.",

Ketamineo The primary site of action is in the cortex and subcortical areas; not in the reticular activating system (site of action of barbiturates), o It acts on NMD A receptors. o Short duration of action (10-15 minutes) is due to redistribution from brain and blood to other tissues of the body, o Ketamine is different from most other anaesthetic induction agents in that it has significant analgesic action. o Ketamine increases IOT and cerebral metabolism - contraindicated in head injury. o It causes sympathetic stimulation with elevation of HR, CO & BP - contraindicated in hypertension and ischemic heart disease. o It also raises IOT - contraindicated in glaucoma. o It relieves bronchospasm - intravenous anaesthetic of choice in asthmatics (inhalation anaesthetic of choice in asthmatic is halothane). o Injection is not painful (All other inducing agents cause pain on injection), o It is i. v. anaesthetic of choice in child ren (Sevoflurane is inhalation agent of choice). o Because it causes sympathetic stimulation it is intravenous anesthetic of choice in patients with shock and hypovolemia. o It has no muscle relaxant property rather muscle tone is increased. o Airway reflexes (pharyngeal and laryngeal) are not depressed - intravenous anaesthetic of choice for emergency anaesthesia (no starvation is required). o Ketamine produces emergence reaction during awakening from anesthesia - vivid dreaming, illusions, extracorporeal experiences, excitement, confusion, fear and euphoria - contraindicated in psychiatric illness like schizophrenia.",

For patients with HCV, anti-viral therapy is indicated regardless of the degree of severity. For less severe cases (e. g., purpura, weakness, and joint pain), anti-viral therapy alone is the treatment of choice. Involvement of vital organs requires addition of immune-suppressive drugs.

        "exp": "Ans. is B i. e., 7 Energetics of Glvcoivsis o During glycolysis 2 ATP are utilized and 4 ATP are produced at substrate level. 2 reducing equalents NADH- are produced and reoxidized by electron transport chain, to generata 5 ATP molecules (2. 5 ATP per NADH- molecule). Thus total 9 ATP molecules are produced and 2 are utilized, i. e., There is a net gain of 7 ATP molecules in aerobic glycolysisQ. o In anaerobic conditions, the reoxidation of NADH by electron transport chain is prevented and NADH gets reoxidized by conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Thus, in anaerobic glycolysis, only 4 ATP are produced at substrate level. Therefore, there is a net gain of 2 ATP molecules in anaerobic glycolysisQ. o Note: - Previous calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH2 generates 2 ATPs. This will amount to a net generation of 8. ATPs per glucose molecule during glycolysis. Recent experiments show that these old values are overestimates and NADH produces 2. 5 ATPs and FADH2 produces 1. 5 ATPs. Thus, net generation is oniv 7. ATPs during glvcoivsis.
