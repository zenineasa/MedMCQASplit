        "exp": "Ans. B 2 ml/kg 10% Dextrose (Ref. OP Ghai 7th/pg. 155, Reference: ) Neonatal Hypoglycemia: # A blood glucose value of < 40 mg/dL (plasma glucose < 45 mg/dL). # Hypoglycemia in first 18-36 hrs is usually due to transient neonatal hypoglycemia and after 36 hrs metabolic and other causes are likely. # Persistent/recurrent hypoglycemia is defined as requiring either parenteral glucose for > 7 days or high IV glucose infusion rates (>12-16 mg/kg/min). Etiopathogenesis: # High risk factors of hypoglycemia include: 1) Infants of diabetic mothers many of whom are LGA, 2) All macrosomic (LGA) infants (mothers may have occult diabetes), 3) SGA, (i. e., intrauterine stressed) infants, 4) Stressed infants (i. e., difficult delivery, low Apgar <7 at five minutes), 5) Infants of mothers on tocolytics (terbutaline, ritodrine), oral hypoglycemics or propranolol within 72 hrs before delivery, 6) Premature infants (<37 weeks gestational age), 7) Postmature infants (>42 weeks gestational age). A) Transient hypoglycemia: 1. Maternal conditions causing transient hypoglycemia: a. Intrapartum glucose given at too high a rate to the mother. b. Drug Rx (terbutaline, ritodrine, propranolol, oral hypoglycemics). c. Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR): placental insufficiency resulting in SGA infant. d. Diabetes in pregnancy (hyperinsulinism). 2. Neonatal conditions causing transient hypoglycemia: a. Failure to adapt extrauterine life b. Birth asphyxia c. Infection/sepsis d. Hyperviscosity e. Congenital heart disease f. Erythroblastosis fetalis g. Hypothermia. h. Inadequate calories. i. Other iatrogenic causes: exchange transfusion and/or low lying umbilical artery catheter. j. Decreased glycogen stores: Associated with pre and postmature infants. B) Persistent and/or recurrent hypoglycemia: 1. Hyperinsulinism conditions which cause persistent/recurrent hypoglycemia: a. Nesidioblastosis: rare; hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia due to beta cell hypertrophy. It is on a continuum with islet cell adenoma and usually requires subtotal or total pancreatectomy to treat, however octreotide and diazoxide are useful Rx. b. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome: Visceromegaly, macroglossia, hypoglycemia. 2. Endocrine deficiency conditions which cause persistent/recurrent hypoglycemia: a. Pituitary insufficiency: septo-optic dysplasia, craniofacial defects and anencephaly (Deficiency of pituitary hormones such as growth hormone and ACTH, results in hypoglycemia). b. Cortisol deficiency/adrenal failure. c. Congenital glucagon deficiency. d. Epinephrine deficiency: Extremely rare. 3. Inborn errors of metabolism conditions which cause persistent/recurrent hypoglycemia: a. Carbohydrate metabolism: Galactosemia, glycogen storage disease, fructose intolerance. b. Amino acid meta: MSUD, propionicacidemia, methylmalonic aciduria, tyrosinemia, glutaric acidemia. c. Fatty acid metabolism: Carnitine metabolism defect, Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase defect. Rx: The goal of Rx is to establish normoglycemia, usually defined as a stable glucose value above 40 or 50 mg/dl. Asymptomatic babies: # Asymptomatic infants in the 20-40 mg/dl range may have a trial of oral feeding, but if the glucose fails to normalize, an IV glucose infusion should be started. # Although dextrose 5% oral solution is occasionally used for Rx, formula has the advantage of containing fats and proteins which are metabolized slowly and provide a more sustained level of substrates for glucose production. Blood glucose should be rechecked in 30-60 minutes after feeding. Symptomatic babies: # with severe hypoglycemia (<20 mg/dl), a small IV bolus of dextrose has been shown to raise blood sugar levels safely and more quickly to adequate levels than intravenous infusion alone. # The usual bolus is 2 ml/kg of a dextrose 10% solution given intravenously followed by a glucose infusion rate of 6 to 8 mg/kg/min. The first part of the infusion, i. e., the bolus is given as a dose of ml/kg, but the second part of the infusion is given in mg/kg/min. # A simplified formula for glucose infusion rate (in mg/kg/min) is: Glucose infusion rate (GIR) = (dextrose % concentration X ml/kg/d) / 144 # So if dextrose 10% is used at 80 ml/kg/day that gives us: GIR = (10 x 80) /144 = 800 / 144 = 5. 6 mg/kg/min. # A faster way to figure this out is to use one of the following formulas to achieve a glucose infusion rate of 7 mg/kg/ minute. D5W: IV rate (in ml/hr) = 8. 4 X Body Wt (in kg) D10W: IV rate (in ml/hr) = 4. 2 X Body Wt (in kg) # For a 3 kg newborn infant, using D5W would result in an IV rate of 25 ml/hr, which results in 600 ml/day, or 200 cc/kg/ day, which is too much. This is why D10W must be used instead. The D10W infusion rate using the above formula would still give 100 cc/kg/day. F/U and outcome: # If the plasma glucose cannot be raised by glucose infusion alone, other options include a trial of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone 5-15 mg/kg/day IV in 2-3 divided doses or prednisone 2 mg/kg/day by mouth). # If this fails, other drugs that may be used to raise the plasma glucose include human growth hormone, diazoxide, glucagon or long acting synthetic somatostatin (octreotide). # The first step in evaluating persistent/recurrent hypoglycemia is to obtain serum glucose, insulin, and ketone levels. If the ratio of insulin to glucose (I/G ratio) is >0. 3, then the cause is hyperinsulinism. Ketones should be low or absent in hyperinsulinism.",

The increase in estrogen production that is characteristic of PCOD is the consequence of peripheral conversion of androstenedione to estrogen, not of direct gonadal production. During the third trimester of pregnancy estrogen production is increased because of the formation of estrogen by the placenta rather than by the ovary.

Floor - Jugular wall separates the middle ear from the superior bulb of the internal jugular vein. Anterior - Carotid wall inferior part separates the middle ear from the internal carotid artery. Has two openings - tensor tympani and auditory tube. Posterior - Mastoid wall opening superiorly(aditus) through which epitympanic process communicates with the mastoid antrum. Lateral or Membranous wall - tympanic membrane separates the middle ear from the external acoustic meatus. 6. Medial - Labyrinthine wail separates the middle ear from the internal ear. It has promontory, fenestra vestibuli, fenestra cochleae, sinus tympani. Contents of the tympanic cavityo Contents of the middle ear (tympanic cavity) are:-Ear ossicles - Malleus, incus, stapes. Muscles - Tensor tympani, stapedius. Chorda tympani. Tympanic plexus. Ossicles of the middle earo The middle ear contains three ear ossicles (from lateral to medial) Malleus, incus, and stapes. The ossicles transmit sound vibrations from the large tympanic membrane into the small oval window, at a huge mechanical advantage. The malleus articulates with incus, which in turn articulates with the stapes. Types of the joint are. The incudomalleolar joint - Saddle type of synovial joints. The included-stapedial joint - Ball & socket type of synovial joints. o Stapes footplate is held in the oval window by annular ligament. o The nerve supply of middle ear is derived from tympanic plexus which lies over the promontory. The inferior ganglion of the glossopharyngeal nerve6 gives off the tympanic nerve which enters the middle ear through the tympanic canaliculus and takes part in the formation of the tympanic plexus on the medial wall of the middle ear. This distributes its fibers to the middle ear, and also to the auditory tube, mastoid antrum, and air cells.",

However, the success rate depends on the underlying etiology as well as the age of the woman. o Hysteroscopic resection of uterine septa, synechiae and submucous myomas improves the pregnancy outcome. Uterine unification operation (metroplasty) is done for cases with bicomuate uteruso Chromosomal anomalies - If chromosomal abnormality is detected in the couples or in the abortus, genetic counseling is undertaken. Karyotyping of the products of conception from future miscarriage is mandatory. Couples with chromosomal translocations or inversion are counseled for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) or prenatal diagnosis (cff DNA, amniocentesis or CVS) in subsequent pregnancy or pregnancy with donor gametes (sperm or oocyte). o Women with PCOS are best treated for their insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenemia. Metformin therapy is helpful. o Endocrine dysfunction: Control of diabetes and thyroid disorders is done. Subclinical diabetes and/or thyroid disease may be treated when no other factor is present. o Genital tract infections are treated appropriately following culture of cervical and vaginaldischarge. Empirical treatment with doxycycline or erythromycin is cost-effective. Note: Operative management of cervical incompetence is done with cerclage operation. o Cerclage operation: Two types of operation are in current use during pregnancy each claiming an equal success rate of about 80-90%. The operations are named after Shirodkar (1955) and Mc. Donald (1963). o Timing of cerclage: In a proven case, prophylactic cerclage should be done around 14 weeks of pregnancy or at least 2 weeks earlier than the lowest period of previous wastage, as early as the 10th week. Emergency (rescue) cerclage can be done when the cervix is dilated and there is bulging of the membranes.",

In early fluorosis, the first changes are bone deposition and thickening at the junctions of trabeculae. This is seen as sand-like, granular, or particle-like bone structure on radiographs. In more advanced fluorosis, the trabeculae are more generally thickened because of new bone formation on the trabecular surface. At this stage, radiographs show thickening and condensation of trabeculae, with coarse reticulum or woven bone striations. If the trabeculae are fused, focal round densities are seen in the medullary bone. Osteopenia (less common) also may occur in fluorosis, especially in younger patients at an earlier stage 6.

(b) Hepatomegaly Ref: OP Ghai 8th ed./99 * Marasmus is characterized by failure to gain weight and irritability, followed by weight loss and listlessness until emaciation results. The skin loses turgor and becomes wrinkled and loose as subcutaneous fat disappears. Loss of fat from the sucking pads of the cheeks often occurs late in the course of the disease; thus, the infants face may retain a relatively normal appearance compared with the rest of the body, but this, too, eventually becomes shrunken and wizened. * The abdomen may be distended or flat, with the intestinal pattern readily visible. There is muscle atrophy and resultant hypotonia. * Kwashiorkor is characterized by development of pedal edema which can mask weight loss. Dietary protein deficiency leads to brain damage and apathy, and/or irritability. When advanced, there is lack of growth, lack of stamina, loss of muscle tissue, increased susceptibility to infections, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, flabby subcutaneous tissues, and edema.. It is often present in internal organs before it is recognized in the face and limbs. * HEPATOMEGALY DUE TO FATTY LIVER IS SEEN with FLAG SIGN ON HAIR and Skin showing FLAKY PAINT DERMATOSIS (fig).",

Guidelines of management of acne* Step 1 - For mild acne (< 10 lesions): - Topical therapy is used. Combination therapy is the best. Benzoyl peroxide- erythromycin gel plus topical retinoids combination is used. Topical erythromycin-Benzoyl peroxide gels are applied during the day; topical retinoids are applied in the evening.* Step 2 - For moderate acne (10-25 lesions), and mild acne not responding to topical therapy: - Oral antibiotic is added to the above topical regimen. The most effective antibiotic is minocycline or doxycycline. In females, moderate acne can be controlled with high doses of estrogens combined with progesterone or antiandrogens.* Step 3 - For severe acne, nodulocystic lesions, large nodular lesions, and moderate acne not responding to oral antibiotics (Recalcitrant acne): - Isotretinoin is the drug of choice. Isotretinoin is the single most advance in the management of severe acne. It inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization and is very effective. Oral isotretinoin leads to complete remission in almost all cases. If the patient cannot afford isotretinoin, dapsone is a useful alternative.

People taking methotrexate, both male and female, are advised to discontinue taking the drug at least three months prior to conception because there is a chance that the drug may cause birth defects. The period of time off the drug used to be six months but has recently been reduced to three, much to our relief. In people who have arthritis some other way of controlling the disease must be found during this period. For men, once pregnancy is confirmed they can go straight back on to methotrexate. Women, however, are advised to stay off the drug throughout pregnancy. Fortunately the pregnancy itself often helps rheumatoid arthritis but not until about 12 weeks.

Supplementary Nutrition is given to the children (6 months - 6 years) and pregnant and lactating mothers under the ICDS Scheme. The Government of India, on 24. 2. 2009, has issued revised guidelines on nutritional and feeding norms. States/UTs have been requested to provide supplementary nutrition to children below six years of age and pregnant and lactating mothers, in accordance with the guidelines which have been endorsed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court vide its Order dated 22. 4. 2009. The provision of supplementary nutrition under ICDS Scheme prescribed for various categories of beneficiaries is as follows: (i) Children in the age group of 6 months to 3 years: Food supplement of 500 calories of energy and 12-15 gms. of Protein per child per day as Take Home Ration (THR) in the form of Micronutrient Fortified Food and/or energy-dense food marked as 'ICDS Food Supplement'. (ii) Children in the age group of 3-6 years: Food supplement of 500 calories of energy and 12-15 gms of Protein per child per day. Since a child of this age group is not capable of consuming of meal of 500 calories in one sitting, the guidelines prescribed provision of morning snack in the form of milk/banana/seasonal fruits/Micronutrient Fortified Food etc. and a Hot Cooked Meal. (iii) Severely underweight children: Food supplement of 800 calories of energy and 20-25 gms of Protein per child per day in the form of Micronutrient fortified and/or energy dense food as Take Home Ration. (iv) Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers: Food supplement of 600 calories of energy and 18-20 gms of Protein per day in the form of Micronutrient Fortified Food and/or energy dense food as Take Home Ration. The revised feeding and cost norms under Supplementary Nutrition Progarmme are as under: Sl.

Pregnant women and Nursing mothers 600 18-20 Rs. 5. 00 Under the Strengthened and Restructured ICDS, these rates have been revised to Rs. 6. 00, Rs. 9. 00 and Rs. 7. 00 per beneficiary per day for children (6-72 months), severely malnourished children (6-72 months) and pregnant women and Nursing mothers, respectively. The revised rates are to follow the phased implementation over the 3 years of the Strengthened and Restructured ICDS on the existing cost sharing ratio of 50: 50 between the Centre and the States other than NER where it will continue to be on 90: 10 basis, as under: (i) In 200 high burden districts in the first year (2012-13); (ii) In additional 200 districts in second year (2013-14) (i. e. w. e. f. 1. 4. 2013) including districts from special category States and NER; (iii) In remaining districts in third year (2014-15) (i. e. w. e. f. 1. 4. 2014).",

Secondary Impact Injury - Caused by further impact to the vehicle by the victim. Tertiary Impact Injury (Secondary Injury) when the victim strikes another object or ground. Primary Impact Injury When a moving vehicle hits a person, various parts of the vehicle will come into contact with body during the impact, producing patterned injuries called primary impact injuries.

The detection of primary impact injury will help to find out the relative position of the vehicle and the pedestrian.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Synthesised by DNA polymerase d in eukaryotes * Replication is a process by which two ds. DNAs are synthesized from a single ds. DNA. It is done by DNA polymerases. * DNA polymerases can synthesize a new strand only in 5'3' direction. Since they can synthesize a new strand complementary and antiparallel to the template strand, they want the template strand to be in 3'5' direction to synthesize a new strand continuously. * During replication, when the parent strand unwinds, there are two strands - one in 3'5' direction and the other one in 5'3' direction. * The 3'5' strand is treated as leading strand (as against a 3'5' strand, a 5'3' new strand can be synthesized continuously). 5'3' strand will be treated as lagging strand as against a 5'3; strand there is no DNA polymerase to synthesize a new strand in 3'5' direction. So across this 5'3' strand, the DNA polymerases synthesize from the angle of separation. * At the angle of separation, replication fork is formed. Replication fork is made up of Helicase (to cause unwinding of the two strands to enable replication to happen along the whole of DNA), RNA primase (to synthesis the RNA primer that is necessary for DNA polymerase to elongate the DNA strands), DNA polymerase d (to elongate the DNA strands) and single-stranded binding proteins (to prevent the two strands to reanneal). * First RNA primer synthesizes the RNA primer and then DNA polymerase a elongates the first 10 nucleotides of the DNA strand and then it is taken over by DNA polymerase d, which synthesizes 100 to 150 nucleotides. These short fragments with RNA primer attached to DNA fragments synthesized along lagging strand are called OKAZAKI FRAGMENTS. So Okazaki fragments are synthesized by RNA primer, DNA polymerase a and DNA polymerase d. * DNA polymerase d continues the synthesis of DNA strand until it comes across another RNA primer (which is synthesized by the previous replication fork). Here it creates a flap at the 5' end of the RNA primer and that is removed by Flap endonuclease FEN1. * After the RNA primer is removed, DNA polymerase d fills the gap and DNA ligase unites the ends. * In prokaryotes, the process is almost the same, except that the enzymes are different. DNA helicase causes unwinding. RNA primase synthesizes RNA primer. DNA polymerase III synthesizes the DNA fragment. Hence Okazaki fragments are synthesized by RNA primase and DNA polymerase III in prokaryotes. * DNA polymerase III synthesizes DNA fragments until it visualizes an RNA primer (synthesized by previous replication fork). DNA polymerase III recruits DNA polymerase I, which uses its 5*3* exonuclease activity to remove the RNA primer and DNA polymerase I fills the gap and DNA ligase unites the ends.

Eligibility to PEP is assessed by using Status Code (SC) and Exposure Code (EC). Two (basic) and three drugs (expanded) regimens are available. Duration is 28 days. Key recommendations by WHO The recommended PEP regimens are: For adults: Tenofovir combined with either lamivudine (3. TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) as preferred backbone drugs and these are also the preferred drugs for treating HIV. The recommended third drug is ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r), which is also recommended by WHO as a preferred drug for HIV treatment. For children: Zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3. TC) backbone drugs for children aged 10 or below, with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) recommended as the third drug choice. This is also in alignment with preferred drugs for treating HIV in children. Recommendations for simplifying prescribing approaches and supporting adherence include: Prescribing: To improve uptake and completion of PEP, WHO recommends providing the full 28-day course at first visit, rather than requiring patients to return multiple times for prescriptions. Adherence support: To improve adherence and completion rates, WHO suggests programmes offer enhanced adherence counseling. o Anti-retroviral drug for post-exposure prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible after the exposure within the first few hours and no later than 72 hours. o So, the best answer here is 1-2 hours (first few hours).

Hemochromatosiso Hemochromatosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of body iron, most of which is deposited in parenchymal organs such as liver and pancreas. o The total body content of the iron is tightly regulated, as the daily losses are matched by gastrointestinal absorption. In hereditary hemochromatosis, regulation of intestinal absorption of dietary iron is lost, leading to net iron accumulation of 0. 5 to 1. 0 gm/year. o It may be recalled that the total body iron pool ranges from 2-6 gm in normal adults; about 0. 5 gm is stored in the liver 98% of which is hepatocytes. In hemochromatosis the iron accumulation may exceed 50 gm, over one third of which accumulates in the liver. o The iron accumulation is life long, the rate of net iron accumulation is 0. 5 to L0 gm/year.

Urinary' ascites occurs when high intraluminal pressure forces urine to extravasate from the kidney, usually across a renal fornix. Urine then enters the retroperitoneum and travels across the peritoneum as a transudate. o If this urine or ascetic fluid is aspirated from the peritoneal cavity, the ascites or extravasated urine contains electrolyte and creatinine levels similar to those of serum. This is because the urine within the peritoneum is subject to the large absorptive mesothelial surface that quickly normalizes these values, masking the identity of ascitic fluid as urine. The diagnosis of urinary'- ascites may be difficult and may require definitive upper tract drainage in the form of nephrostomy tubes to establish the cause of the ascites and allow' its resolution, o Urinary ascites in the case of distal obstruction may serve to lower urinary pressures and offers some protection to the developing kidneys. \"Posterior urethral valves are probably the most common underlying etiology\" - Campbell's Urology",

        "exp": "The patient most likely has a gonadoblastoma, which is sometimes associated with certain types of Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is characterized by an XO geno\u00adtype (~ 60%) without any Barr body. Approximately, 40% of patients are mosaics with an XX/XO, a 45 XO/46 XX, or an XO/46 XY karyotype. The presence of a Y chromosome poses an increased risk for germ cell tumors of the streak gonads (ovary without eggs). Dysgerminomas and gonadoblastomas (germ cell plus sex cord stromal tumor) are the two most common tumors associated with this abnormality. Both of these tumors are also seen in certain types of gonadal dysgen\u00adesis where there is female pseudohermaphroditism, that is, genotypic females with male appearing external genitalia. Gonadoblastomas, unlike dysgerminomas, frequently contain foci of calcification that are visible on abdominal films, as in this patient. Other primary ovarian tumors that frequently produce visible calcifi\u00adcations on abdominal films are cystic teratomas (bone and teeth) and fibromas. Dysgerminomas of the ovary are the female counter\u00adpart of seminomas of the testicle and pinealomas in the central nervous system. They are the most common malignant germ cell tumor of the ovary, whereas cystic teratomas are the most common benign germ cell tumor. Dysgerminomas are bilateral in 10% of cases. They are solid tumors that contain large, anaplastic cells with prominent nucleoli intermixed with a benign lymphoid infiltrate. Dysgerminomas, like seminomas, are extremely radiosensitive tumors and have an excel\u00adlent 5 year survival rate.

The etiological agent is Rhinosporidium seeberi. Rhinosporidium seeberi is an aquatic protozoan (not a fungus). Infection usually results from a local traumatic inoculation with the organism. It is seen in India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. In India, most of the cases are seen in Southern states. Infection of the nose and nasopharynx is observed in 70% of persons with rhinosporidiosis; infection of the palpebral conjunctiva or associated structures (including lacrimal apparatus) is observed in 15% of cases. Other structures of the mouth and upper airway may be sites of disease. Disease of the skin, ear, genitals, and rectum has also been described. Rhinosporidiosis is an infection that typically limited to the mucosal epithelium. The disease progress with local replication of R seeberi and associated hyperplastic growth of host tissue and a localized immune response. Clinical features of Rhinosporidiosiso Rhinosporidiosis presents as soft leafy polypoidal mass (soft polyp), which is pink to purple in colour studded with white dots, i. e. strawberry appearance. This appearance results from sporangia, which is visible as grey or yellow spots in the vascular polypoid masses. Because the polyps are vascular and friable, they bleed easily upon manipulation.

The muscarinic cholinergic and \u03b2 receptors, as well as rhodopsin, are multipass transmembrane proteins consisting specifically of seven hydrophobic spanning segments of the single polypeptide chain. The peptide bonds of the spanning segments are polar. In the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer, in the absence of water, they form hydrogen bonds with each other. In the vast majority of cases this leads to the formation of ex helices. In the case of the porins, found in the outer mitochondrial membrane, a 0-barrel structure is established.

A second causative gene (ADPKD2) has not been identified but seems to be at a locus distinct from ADPKDI, which appears to be the cause of the gene in -90% of families in the white population. A rare syndrome known as autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease affects between 1 in 10, 000 and 1 in 40, 000 individuals in the United States, and the causative gene has been localized to chromosome. Patients are typically diagnosed during the first year of life, presenting with bilateral abdominal masses. Death in the neonatal period is common due to pulmonary hypoplasia. The most common complication of polycystic kidney disease is pain secondary to large cystic kidneys; in addition, most patients are hypertensive. In addition to the chronic pain, acute pain may represent cystic hemorrhage, infection, or, less commonly, a renal stone.

TRANSVERSE LIE* Transverse lie is seen in 0. 3% of the cases.* In this position, the long axis of the fetus is approximately perpendicular to that of the mother.* In a transverse lie, the shoulder is usually positioned over the pelvic inlet. The head occupies one iliac fossa, and the breach the other (as seen in question).* This creates a shoulder presentation in which the side of the mother on which the acromion rests determines the designation of the lie as of right or left acromial. Etiology* Women with four or more deliveries have a 10-fold incidence of transverse lie compared with nulliparas.* Common causes of transverse lie include:# Abdominal wall relaxation from high parity# Preterm fetus# Placenta previa (NOT abruption placentae)# Abnormal uterine anatomy# Hydramnios, and# Contracted pelvis. Diagnosis* A transverse lie is usually recognized easily, often by inspection alone.* The abdomen is unusually wide, whereas the uterine fundus extends to only slightly above the umbilicus.

As of August 2018, the ICD-11 lists this condition as \"gender incongruence\", under \"conditions related to sexual health\", coded into three conditions: Gender incongruence of adolescence or adulthood (HA60): replaces F64. 0. Gender incongruence of childhood (HA61): replaces F64. 2. Gender incongruence, unspecified (HA6Z): replaces F64. 9. In addition, sexual maturation disorder has been removed, along with dual-role transvestism.

Mechanism of action of muscle relaxantso To know the mechanism of action of different skeletal muscle relaxants one should know the normal sequences of events in contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle -Contraction. There is a discharge of motor neuron. The release of Ach at the neuromuscular junction. Binding of Ach to nicotinic (NM) cholinergic receptors at end plate. Binding of Ach to nicotinic receptors causes opening of Na+ channels (NM receptor has intrinsic ion channel). Opening of Na+ channel generate end plate potential on skeletal muscle membrane. If endplate potential is above a threshold level, an action potential is generated on skeletal muscle membrane- depolarization. Depolarization of skeletal muscle membrane causes the intracellular release of Ca+2 from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca+2 binds to troponin 'c', uncovering myosin binding site of actin. Cross-linking between actin and myosin, and sliding of thin filaments on thick filaments -contraction. Relaxation1. Ca+2 pumped back into sarcoplasmic reticulum. 2 Release of Ca+2 from Troponin. 3 Cessation of interaction between actin and myosin - relaxation, o Now coming back to the mechanism of different skeletal muscle relaxants. 1 Competitive (nondepolarising) blockerso The competitive blockers have affinity for Nm receptors but no intrinsic activity, o They compete with Ach for Nm receptor - called competitive blockers. o They prevent binding of Ach to Nm receptors - No opening of Na+ channels - No depolarization, so these are called non-depolarizing blockers. o Competitive blockers reduce the frequency of channel opening but not its duration or the conductance of a channel once it has opened. o When the magnitude of end plate potential falls below a critical level, it is unable to trigger propagated muscle action potential - muscle fails to contract, o Neostigmine (anticholinesterases) antagonises competitive blockers. 2 Depolarizing blockerso Depolarizing blockers have affinity as well as submaximal intrinsic activity on NM receptors. o They depolarize muscle end plates by opening of Na+ channels and initially produce twitching and fasciculations (not full contraction as these drugs have submaximal activity) - o, they are called depolarizing blocker, o These drugs do not dissociate rapidly from the receptor (NM) - Persistent partial depolarization - Na+ channels get inactivated - flaccid paralysis, o Neostigmine does not antagonise depolarising blockers. o Under certain conditions depolarizing agents produce dual mechanism of neuromuscular blockade which can be divided into two phases: Phase I block. Rapid in onset. The result from persistent depolarization of muscle end plate. Has classical features of depolarization block. Block is not antagonized by anticholinesterases (neostigmine). Phase II block. Slow in onset. Results from desensitization of receptor to ACh. Resembles block produced by competitive blockers. Block is partially reversed by anticholinesterases (Neostigmine). o In man normally only phase I block is seen the typical depolarizing block. o Phase II block is seen when fluorinated anesthetics have been given or when SCh is injected in high dose. o Sch also produces phase II block in patients with atypical or deficient pseudocholinesterase.",

Increasing incidence, mainly due to HCV and HBV chronic infection. Male predominance (2. 4: 1). Pathogenesis. Four major etiologic factors associated with HCC have been established: Chronic viral infection (HBV, HCV). Chronic alcoholism. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Food contaminants (primarily aflatoxins produced by Aspergillus flavus). Other conditions include. Tyrosinemia. Glycogen storage disease. Hereditary hemochromatosis. Non-alcoholic fatty liver diseasea1-antitrypsin deficiency. The precise mechanisms of carcinogenesis are unknown. Progression to HCC might result from point mutations in selected cellular genes such as KRAS and p53. and constitutive expression of c-MYC, c-MET (the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor). TGF-a, and insulin-like growth factor 2. Recent global gene expression studies revealed that approximately 50% of HCC cases are associated with activation of VVNT or AKT pathways. Morphology. HCC may appear grossly as. Unifocal (usually large) mass. Multifocal, widely distributed nodules of variable size. Diffusely infiltrative cancer. All patterns of HCCs have a strong propensity for invasion of vascular structures. Extensive intrahepatic metastases ensue, and occasionally, long* snakelike masses of tumor invade the portal vein (with occlusion of the portal circulation) or inferior vena cava, extending even into the right side of the heart. HCC spreads extensively within the liver by obvious contiguous growth and by the development of satellite nodules, which can be shown by molecular methods to be derived from the parent tumor. Metastasis outside the liver is primarily via vascular invasion, especially into the hepatic vein system, but hematogenous metastases, especially to the lung, tend to occur late in the disease.",

About 1-1. 5 cm of the segment of the loop distal to the ligature is excised. The tube is so excited as to leave behind about 1. 5 cm of the intact tube adjacent to the uterus.# The segment of the loop removed is to be inspected to be sure that the wall has not been partially resected and to send it for histology. b) Uchida technique - A saline solution is injected subserosally in the mid-portion of the tube to create a bleb. The serous coat is incised along the antimesenteric border to expose the muscular tube. The tube is ligated with No. 0 chromic catgut on either side and about 3-5 cm of the tube is resected off. The ligated proximal stump is allowed to retract beneath the serious coat. The serous coat is closed with a fine suture in such a way that the proximal stump is buried but the distal stump is open to the peritoneal cavity. No failure in this method has been observed so far. c) Irving method - The tube is ligated on either side and mid portion of the tube (between the ties) is excised. The free medial end of the tube is then turned back and buried into the posterior uterine wall creating a myometrial tunneld) Madlener technique - It is the easiest method.

Cold nodule on thyroid scan is diagnostic of malignancy Option A - Cold nodule on thyroid scan is diagnostic of malignancy, is a false statement hence is the answer to this Question. On isotope scanning, a thyroid nodule can be 'hot', 'warm' or 'cold'. Hot - a hot nodule is one that takes up isotope, while the surrounding thyroid tissue is inactive because the hot nodule is producing such high levels of thyroid hormones that TSH secretion is suppressed. Warm nodule - a warm nodule takes up isotope and so does normal thyroid tissue around it. Cold nodule - it takes up no isotope. The cold nodules carry a higher risk for malignancy. But a 'cold' nodule does not necessarily mean malignant. Only 20% of cold nodules turn out to be malignant, and about 5% of hot nodules can be malignant. Thus routine isotope scanning is no longer used to distinguish benign from malignant. FNAC is the investigation of choice for a solitary thyroid nodule. The finding of a malignant diagnosis on FNAC is associated with a high accuracy rate (-100%), but the false negative rate of FNAC is high (1-6%). Thus benign nodules should be kept under observation. An inconclusive FNA needs aggressive management. A repeat FNA is done. If still inconclusive, the pt. can be kept under observation if risk factors are low. Alternatively, if risk factors are high as in the present case, the pt. can undergo hemithyroidectomy to remove the nodule and sent for histopathology.

Highest prevalence: drug abusers (9%). General prevalence 0. 28%What can be deduced from the above is that heterosexual contact with the source person is the most common route of transfer, nevertheless the chance of transmission is less in heterosexual route, wherein this chance chance of transmission is highest in blood or blood product transfusion related catastrophe. Every third of infected HIV mother gives birth to a child with HIV. But the current consensus in India is though the mother is HIV positive and the child has chances of getting HIV if breast fed from the mother, they are encouraged to breast feed the child, for the child experiences more morbidity of malnutrition if not breast fed which could be more dangerous and lead to several other plethora of diseases.

Tophi are deposits of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in tissue. Gouty arthritis is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hyperuricemia, recurrent attacks of acute arthritis, formation of deposits of MSU (tophi), and uric acid urolithiasis. It is the most common inflammatory arthritis in men older than 30 years. Gout is a multifactorial inheritance caused by a combi\u00adnation of genetic susceptibility and the effect of certain environmental factors (e. g., alcohol, eating red meats). Hyperuricemia is associated, but not synonymous, with gout because some patients with gout have nor\u00admal uric acid levels. Primary hyperuricemia with gout refers to hyperuricemia that is a consequence of a disorder in uric acid metabolism that results from (1) decreased excretion (most common mechanism), (2) increased production, or (3) a combination of the two. Secondary hyperuricemia associated with gout can be caused by the same mechanisms as primary gout. There are secondary associations with diabetes mellitus, alco\u00adholism, polycythemia rubra vera, leukemia, multiple myeloma, diuretic therapy, and the treatment of dis\u00adseminated carcinomas.",

Skin, joints, and nerves are commonly affected. The heart, brain, or gastrointestinal tract each are affected in fewer than 10% of cases. Most patients with cryoglobulinemia are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Many of the remaining patients with cryoglobulinemia have lupus, Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, or white blood cell cancers (lymphoma, myeloma, or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia) as the underlying cause. The most common appearance of vasculitis in the skin is purpura (bright red circles, from the size of a pinhead up to half an inch, often painful or itchy), but open sores are also common. Damage to nerves (neuropathy) causes numbness, tingling, severe burning pain, and or weakness in a hand or foot. For patients with HCV, anti-viral therapy is indicated regardless of the degree of severity. For less severe cases (e. g., purpura, weakness, and joint pain), anti-viral therapy alone is the treatment of choice. Involvement of vital organs requires addition of immune-suppressive drugs. Prednisone, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide have been widely used, but recent studies have indicated that rituximab may be superior to these medications.",

        "question": "Which is true for malate shuttle?",
        "exp": "Ans. B Cytoplasm to mitochondria Ref- https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Malate-aspartate_shuttle The primary enzyme in the malate-aspartate shuttle is malate dehydrogenase. Malate dehydrogenase is present in two forms in the shuttle system: mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase. The two malate dehydrogenases are differentiated by their location and structure, and catalyze their reactions in opposite directions in this process. First, in the cytosol, malate dehydrogenase catalyses the reaction of oxaloacetate and NADH to produce malate and NAD+. In this process, two electrons generated from NADH, and an accompanying H+, are attached to oxaloacetate to form malate. Once malate is formed, the first antiporter (malate-alpha-ketoglutarate) imports the malate from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix and also exports alpha-ketoglutarate from the matrix into the cytosol simultaneously. After malate reaches the mitochondrial matrix, it is converted by mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase into oxaloacetate, during which NAD+ is reduced with two electrons to form NADH. Oxaloacetate is then transformed into aspartate (since oxaloacetate cannot be transported into the cytosol) by mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase. Since aspartate is an amino acid, an amino radical needs to be added to the oxaloacetate. This is supplied by glutamate, which in the process is transformed into alpha-ketoglutarate by the same enzyme. The second antiporter (the glutamate-aspartate antiporter) imports glutamate from the cytosol into the matrix and exports aspartate from the matrix to the cytosol. Once in the cytosol, aspartate is converted by cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase to oxaloacetate. The net effect of the malate-aspartate shuttle is purely redox: NADH in the cytosol is oxidized to NAD+, and NAD+ in the matrix is reduced to NADH. The NAD+ in the cytosol can then be reduced again by another round of glycolysis, and the NADH in the matrix can be used to pass electrons to the electron transport chain so ATP can be synthesized. Since the malate-aspartate shuttle regenerates NADH inside the mitochondrial matrix, it is capable of maximizing the number of ATPs produced in glycolysis (3/NADH), ultimately resulting in a net gain of 38 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose metabolized. Compare this to the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle, which reduces FAD+ to produce FADH2, donates electrons to the quinone pool in the electron transport chain, and is capable of generating only 2 ATPs per NADH generated in glycolysis (ultimately resulting in a net gain of 36 ATPs per glucose metabolized). (These ATP numbers are prechemiosmotic, and should be reduced in light of the work of Mitchell and many others. Each NADH produced only 2. 5 ATPs, and each FADH2 produces only 1. 5 ATPs. Hence, the ATPs per glucose should be reduced to 32 from 38 and 30 from 36. It should also be noted that the extra H+ required to bring in the inorganic phosphate during oxidative-phosphorylation contributes to the 30 and 32 numbers as well).",

Read the following lines from Harrison and you will agree with me \"Although it is the most important circulating androgen, testosterone is in effect the penultimate androgen in mediating hirsutism. \"It is the penultimate androgen because testosterone is first converted to more potent dihydrotestosterone, which then acts on androgen receptors.

Usually attacks occur during a 4-to 8-week period in which the patient experiences one to three severe brief headaches daily. There may then be a prolonged pain-free interval before the next episode. Men between ages 20 and 50 are most commonly affected. The unilateral pain is usually associated with lacrimation, eye reddening, nasal stuffiness, ptosis, and nausea. During episodes alcohol may provoke the attacks. Even though the pain caused by brain tumors may awaken a patient from sleep, the typical history and normal neurologic examination do not mandate evaluation for a neoplasm of the central nervous system. Acute therapy for a cluster headache attack consists of oxygen inhalation, although intranasal lidocaine and subcutaneous sumatriptan may also be effective.

The presenting symptoms are typically an abrupt onset of abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, pain, and diarrhea followed within several days by burning pain in the feet and hands. Examination of the skin shows increased or decreased pigmentation on the skin several weeks after an acute exposure or with chronic low levels of ingestion. Mee's lines, which are transverse lines at the base of the fingernails and toenails, do not become evident until 1 or 2 months after the exposure. Multiple Mee's lines may be seen in patients with long fingernails who have had chronic exposure to arsenic. Mee's lines are not specific for arsenic toxicity as they can also be seen following thallium poisoning. Because arsenic is cleared from blood rapidly, the serum concentration of arsenic is not diagnostically helpful. However, arsenic levels are increased in the urine, hair, and fingernails of patients exposed to arsenic. Anemia with stippling of erythrocytes is common, and occasionally pancytopenia and aplastic anemia can develop. Increased CSF protein levels without pleocytosis can be seen; this can lead to misdiagnosis as GBS.

It' superficial it may point close to the nail and can easily be drained by incision with a size 1 1 scalpel. Deeper lesions are best treated by antibiotics initially, but if they do not improve within 2 days, incision under local anesthesia is required, particularly in childhood. The incision is made laterally in the proximal nail fold. Some authorities recommend removing the proximal one-third of the nail plate without initial incisional drainage. This gives more rapid relief and more sustained drainage. Chronic paronychia. It is an inflammatory dermatosis of the nail folds due to an irritant associated with wet work or caustic materials. Secondary infection, especially with Candida or Pseudomonas may play a role in the pathogenesis. The chronic, non-infective, inflammatory component is treated with topical steroids in addition to antimicrobials. Acute exacerbations occur from time to time and are due to secondary bacterial infection. Skin diseases that may present as chronic paronychia: Psoriasis. Atopic dermatitis. Pemphigus.

        "exp": "Ans. a (External oblique) (Ref. Bailey and Love 24th ed., 1274)INGUINAL CANAL# In adults the inguinal canal, which is 3. 75 cm long, is directed downwards and medially from the deep to the superficial inguinal ring.# Superficial Inguinal Ring- The superficial inguinal ring is a triangular aperture in the aponeurosis of the external oblique and lies 1. 25 cm above the pubic tubercle.- The ring is bounded by a superomedial and inferolateral crus joined by crisscross intercrural fibres.# Deep Inguinal Ring- The deep inguinal ring is a U-shaped condensation of the transversalis fascia and it lies 1. 25 cm above the inguinal (Poupart's) ligament, midway between the symphysis pubis and the ASIS.- The transversalis fascia is the fascial envelope of the abdomen and the competency of the deep inguinal ring depends on the integrity of this fascia.- The inferior epigastric vessels lie posteriorly and medially to the deep inguinal ring.# BOUNDARIES OF THE CANALAnterior. Posterior. External oblique aponeurosis with the conjoined muscle laterally. Fascia transversalis and the conjoined tendon (internal oblique and transversus abdominus medially). Superior. Inferior. Conjoined muscles (internal oblique and transversus). Inguinal ligamentA helpful mnemonic to remember inguinal canal walls include: MALT (2M, 2A, 2L, 2T) - Mnemonic=Starting from superior, moving around in order to posterior:# Superior wall (roof): 2 Muscles: -internal oblique Muscle: -transverse abdominus Muscle# Anterior wall: 2 Aponeuroses:-Aponeurosis of external oblique: -Aponeurosis of internal oblique# Lower wall (floor): 2 Ligaments:-inguinal Ligament: -lacunar Ligament# Posterior wall: 2. Ts:-Transversalis fascia: -conjoint Tendon# Contents of the canal:- In the male the inguinal canal transmits the spermatic cord, the ilio-inguinal nerve and the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve.- In the female the round ligament replaces the spermatic cord. Indirect Hernia. Direct Hernia. Travels down the canal on the outer (lateral and anterior) side of the spermatic cord. Comes out directly forwards through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. Neck of the indirect hernia is lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels. Direct hernia usually emerges medial to inferior epigastric vessels except in the saddle-bag or pantaloon type, which has both a lateral and a medial component.# An inguinal hernia can be differentiated from a femoral hernia by ascertaining the relation of the neck of the sac to the medial end of the inguinal ligament and the pubic tubercle, i. e., in the case of an inguinal hernia the neck is above and medial, while that of a femoral hernia is below and lateral.# Digital control of the internal ring may help in distinguishing between an indirect and a direct inguinal hernia.",

        "exp": "Any postmenopausal woman who has been on unop\u00adposed estrogen and who is now experiencing vaginal bleeding is suspect for either endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia is the end result of pro\u00adlonged estrogenic stimulation of the endometrial mu\u00adcosa. Morphologic forms of hyperplasia include cystic, adenomatous, and atypical hyperplasia. In cystic hy\u00adperplasia (simple hyperplasia), there are large, dilated glands lined by actively mitosing epithelial cells. Ade\u00adnomatous hyperplasia refers to branching of the glands with papillary infolding or outpouchings (sometimes referred to as complex hyperplasia). Atypical hyperpla\u00adsia has more glandular crowding and nuclear atypia than the latter condition and has the highest risk for progressing into carcinoma in situ and endometrial carcinoma. Endometrial carcinoma is the most common inva\u00adsive cancer of the female genital tract. As with endome\u00adtrial hyperplasia, the risk factors for endometrial cancer primarily relate to hyperestrinism and include obesity, nulliparity, diabetes, hypertension, infertility, breast cancer, low fiber/high fat diet, early menarche or late menopause, and tamoxifen.

        "question": "Non-sense mutation is seen in?",
        "exp": "Ans is 'b' i. e. Thalasemia Mutations Point mutation (Base substitution mutation) Substitution of a single base by another is known as point mutation. If a purine is replaced by another purine base or if a pyrimidine base is replaced by another pyrimidine base, it is known as transition. Substitution of a purine base by a pyrimidine base or vice versa is known as transversion. A point mutation will affect only one codon. Point mutation can be of following types:- Silent mutation If the substitution occurs in the third base of a codon, the code word may remain unchanged due to degeneracy of the genetic code. For example, GGC to GGG mutation has no effect as both code for glycine thus, codon containing the changed base codes for the same amino acid (PG1-l. J9), therefore there is no change in amino acid sequence of the protein. The gene is expressed in term of same protein, i. e. there is no change in expression of protein. Mis-sense mutations If the base substitution changes the code words, i. e. codon containing the changed base codes for different amino acid, it is called mis-sense mutation. The sequence of amino acids in the protein changes. The effect of amino acid substitution is variable:- Acceptable missense mutation:- The substitution of amino acid has minimal or no effect because either the substituted amino acid is similar to that of original amino acid or the substitution occurs in non critical area. For example, normally hemoglobin (HbA) has valine at position 67 of b-chain in place of valine. This is non-ritical position, i. e. substitution of different amino-acid 'at this position produces normally functional hemoglobin. For example, 'hemoglobin Milwaukee' has glutamic acid at this position (in place of valine), 'hemoglobin bristol' has aspartic acid and 'hemoglobin Sydney' has alanine (in place of valine). Partially acceptable missense mutation:- Substitution of one amino acid with other is partially acceptable, i. e. the resultant protein functions normally under certain conditions but not always. For example, substitution of glutamate by valine at position six of b-chain produces HbS. HbS is able to function normally at high oxygen tension but gets precipitated at low oxygen tension. Unacceptable mis-sense mutation:- Substitution of one amino acid with other produces non-functional protein. For example, in methemoglobin (HbM) histidine is replacement by tyrosine at position 58 of (X- chain. HbM is incapable of combining with oxygen. Nonsense Mutation. Base substitution changes a sense codon into a nonsense (stop or termination) codon. In such cases, protein synthesis will be terminated prematurely and the resulting protein will be usually non-functional. Frame-shift mutation Frameshift mutations occur due to insertion or deletion of one or two bases which causes change in the reading frame distal to the mutation. If 1 or 2 base pair change, whole reading frame is changed distal to the mutation, resulting into entirely different protein molecule. If 3 base pairs change, single amino acid is incorporated or deleted. The rest of amino acid sequence is same. Trinucleotide repeat mutation In this type of mutation a codon (i. e. trinucleotide sequence) undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain. Diseases associated with trinucleotide repeat mutation are Huntington's disease (CAG repeat), Spinocerebellar ataxia (CAG repeat), Friedreich ataxia (GAA repeat), fragile-X-syndrome (GGG or GCC repeat), dystrophia myotonica (CTG/CUG repeat), X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy (CAG repeat) and dentorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (CAG repeat).

Celiac disease (celiac sprue / gluten - sensitive enteropathy)o Celiac disease is a chronic disease, in which there is a characteristic mucosal lesion of the small intestine and impaired nutrient absorption, which improves on withdrawal of wheat gliadins and related grain proteins from the diet. o The fundamental disorder in celiac sprue is sensitivity to gluten which is alcohol soluble, water-insoluble protein component. It is found in wheat and closely related grains such as oat, barley, and rye. o Celiac disease presents with features of malabsorption and the characteristic is that withdrawal of gluten-containing substances from the diet i. e. (wheat, oat, barley, and rye) produces a dramatic improvement in the disease, o Almost all individuals with celiac disease share the major histocompatibility complex HLA-DQ 2 or HLA - DQ8. o Gliadin is deamidated by the enzyme transglutaminase and deamidated gliadin peptides bind to DQ2 and DQ8. o Recognition of these peptides by CD4+T cells leads to secretion of IFN-y, which damages the intestinal wall. Pathophysiologyo Celiac disease is caused by the action of acidic peptides containing the gliadin fraction of wheat, o The basic abnormality is thought to be an increased rate of loss of epithelial cells. Crypt cells show increased activity. This causes hypertrophy of crypt But even this increased activity cannot keep pace with the loss of cells, resulting in a progressive decrease in height of villi causing villous atrophyo The epithelial cells show decreased cytoplasm and mucuso The intestinal biopsy shows a decrease in the villus: crypt ratio. Normally the villi are 3-4 times the height of the crypts (ratio of 3-4: 1); in celiac disease, the ratio decreases progressively (partial, subtotal and total villous atrophy). Total villous atrophy is seen in severe celiac ds and is quite characteristic of celiac ds (partial villous atrophy may be seen in many other conditions).",

The neocortex is the nonlimbic portion of the cerebral hemisphere. Now let us discuss the connections of various thalamic nuclei in the question. Anterior thalamic nuclei -Anterior thalamic nuclei receive afferents from the mamillary bodies and give fibers to cingulate gyrus. Cingulate gyrus is included in the limbic cortex. So it means that anterior thalamic nuclei do not project to the neocortex. Intralaminar nuclei-Efferents from intralaminar nuclei are diffuse and reach various parts of the cortex. It includes both limbic and nonlimbic areas. Pulvinar nuclei -Efferents from pulvinar nuclei project to all parts of cortex which include both limbic and nonlimbic areas. Reticular nuclei. About Reticular nuclei of Snell's neuroanatomy states \"Every thalamic nucleus except the reticular nuclei sends axons to different parts of the cortex. The output of Reticular nuclei is mainly to other thalamic nuclei\"In every other neuroanatomy book, I looked into states the same fact that Reticular nuclei do not send any efferent to the cerebral cortex. So in this question, two options seem correct. One is Ant Thalamic nuclei because, though it sends fibers to other parts of cortex it does not send any fibers to the neocortex. The other correct option is reticular nuclei, it does not have any efferent to the cerebral cortexI have gone for Reticular nucleus because following text from Gray's gives some evidence of efferents from Anterior thalamic nuclei projecting to the neocortex. Gray's states about Ant.

Oxytocin (10 IU, IV/IM) is the recommended uterotonic drug for the prevention of PPH. In settings where skilled birth attendants are available, controlled cord traction (CCT) is recommended for vaginal births if the care provider and the parturient woman regard a small reduction in blood loss and a small reduction in the duration of the third stage of labour as important. In settings where skilled birth attendants are unavailable, CCT is not recommended. Sustained uterine massage is not recommended as an intervention to prevent PPH in women who have received prophylactic oxytocin. Postpartum abdominal uterine tonus assessment for early identification of uterine atony is recommended for all women. CCT is the recommended method for removal of the placenta in caesarean section. Ref 2: Sheila Balakrishnan obs page 149 Active management of third stage Early cord clamping Prophylactic oxytocin before delivery of placenta 0. 25 mg ergometrine or 0. 2 mg methergine slow IV At the delivery of anterior shoulder along with IV oxytocin Delivery of placenta by controlled cord traction after placental separation has been confirmed Examination of birth canal for any injuries and suturing the same. Ref 3= Post-partum haemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Since more than 50 years AMTSL has been proposed for the prevention of PPH and is still recommended in current guidelines. The 3 key components of AMTSL are the prophylactic administration of oxytocin, clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord immediately after delivery of the baby and controlled cord traction. AMTSL has proven to reduce the rate of severe PPH by 70%. Despite of the long tradition of AMTSL it is still unclear, which of the 3 components significantly contributes to the reduction in PPH. Cochrane analyses and a recent metaanalysis gave strong evidence, that prophylactic oxytocin administration reduces the risk of PPH significantly, however, the optimal dose and mode of application is still a matter of debate. Until a little while ago no randomized controlled studies exist regarding the significance of controlled cord traction and the time of cord clamping in AMTSL. A randomized WHO trial 2012 and the 2013 published TRACOR (Traction of the CORd)-trial from France could clearly demonstrate that controlled cord traction is not associated with a significant reduction in postpartum blood loss and in the risk of severe PPH. A Cochrane analysis 2008 and a recent randomized trial from Sweden came to the conclusion, that there are no significant -differences between early (< 15 s) and delayed (> 1-3 min) cord clamping in the reduction of PPH and severe PPH. Uterine massage after delivery of the placenta, placental cord drainage and umbilical vein injection of uterotonics after delivery of the baby as part of AMTSL are not evidence-based methods.

So during surgery for aortic arch aneurysm temperature is lowered till the temperature of the body is lowered up to 15-17 degc and then surgery is performed.

A. gambiae consists of a complex of morphologically identical species of mosquitoes, along with all other major malaria vectors, however, A. stephensi has not yet been included in any of these complexes. Nevertheless, two races of A. stephensi exist based on differences in egg dimensions and the number of ridges on the eggs: A. stephensi stephensi sensu stricto, the type form, is a competent malaria vector that takes place in urban areas, and A. stephensi mysorensis, the variety form, exists in rural areas and exhibits considerable zoophilic behaviour, making it a poor malaria vector. However, A. stephensi mysorensis is a detrimental vector in Iran. An intermediate form also exists in rural communities and peri-urban areas, though its vector status is unknown. About 12% of malaria cases in India are due to A. stephensi. In November 2015 an American research group demonstrated that an Anopheles stephensi with genetic modifications could be rendered incapable of transmitting malaria, and that 99. 5 percent of the mutant mosquitoes' offspring were also immune. https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Anopheles_stephensi",

It occurs in wounds with separated edges in which there is a more extensive loss of cells and tissue. Regeneration of parenchymal cells cannot completely restore the original architecture, and hence abundant granulation tissue grows. Healing by secondary intention differ from primary intention in several respects: -The inflammatory /7 reaction is more intense. Much larger amounts of granulation tissue are formed. Wound contraction occurs - Feature that most clearly differentiate secondary from primary healing. o Permanent wound contraction requires the action of myofibroblasts - Fibroblasts that have the ultrastructural characteristic of smooth muscle cells.",

        "exp": "ANSWER: (B) Testis. REF: Cellular and Molecular Immunology by Abul K. Abbas, Andrew H. Lichtman, and Shiv Pillai7th edition chapter 2. The term immune privilege refers to the phenomenon where tissue allografts transplanted to certain anatomical sites appear exempt from the rules that normally govern graft rejection. Immune responses and associated inflammation in certain parts of the body, including the brain, eye, testes, placenta, and fetus, carry a high risk of lethal organ dysfunction or reproductive failure. These tissues, which have evolved to be protected, to a variable degree, from immune responses, are called immune privileged sites. The Nobel laureate immunologist Sir Peter Medawar coined the term immune privilege in the 1940s to describe the lack of immune responses to tissue transplanted into the brain or the anterior chamber of the eye of experimental animals. Foreign antigens that would evoke an immune response in most tissues are often tolerated in these immune privileged sites. The mechanisms underlying immune privilege vary between these tissues and are not fully understood. Some of the mechanisms are similar to mechanisms of regulation in gut and skin.",

The fundamental disorder in celiac sprue is sensitivity to gluten which is alcohol soluble, water-insoluble protein component. It is found in wheat and closely related grains such as oat, barley, and rye. Celiac disease presents with features of malabsorption and the characteristic is that withdrawal of gluten-containing substances from the diet i. e. (wheat, oat barley and rye) produces a dramatic improvement in the disease. More questions on celiac disease. In celiac disease, the proximal intestine is commonly involved while in tropical sprue whole of the intestine is involved. Biopsy of intestine in celiac sprue demonstrates. Villous atrophy, loss of microvilli brush border. The crypts are hyperplastic and become elongated. Presence of following cells on lamina propria. Plasma cells Lymphocytes Macrophages Eosinophils Mast cells. Remember that overall mucosal thickness remains same in celiac sprue. Celiac ds. is associated with dermatitis herpetiformis. Pathological features of celiac disease have always been asked. Celiac disease is caused by the action of acidic peptides containing the gliadin fraction of wheat. The basic abnormality is thought to be an increased rate of loss of epithelial cells. Crypt cells show increased activity. This causes hypertrophy of crypt. But even this increased activity cannot keep pace with the loss of cells, resulting in a progressive decrease in height of villi causing villous atrophy. The epithelial cells show decreased cytoplasm and mucus. The intestinal biopsy shows a decrease in the villus: crypt ratio. Normally the villi are 3-4 times the height of the crypts (ratio of 3-4: 1); in celiac disease, the ratio decreases progressively (partial, subtotal and total villous atrophy). Total villous atrophy is seen in severe celiac ds and is quite characteristic of celiac ds (partial villous atrophy may be seen in many other conditions).",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Acne o Acne results from a change in the keratinization process. Ducts of pilosebaceous glands have their opening into hair follicles and hair follicles open on skin surface by their hair follicle opening. Therefore blockage of hair follicle opening results in blockage of the pilosebaceous gland. This is the main pathogenic factor in acne vulgaris, o Three basic defects lead to the development of acne vulgaris: -i) Increased sebum secretionii) Follicular plug at hair follicle opening. iii) Bacterial infection. Increased hormonal secretion at puberty(especially testosterone & dihydrotestosterone)|Increased activity of pilosebaceous glands|Increased lipid-rich sebum secretion|Proliferation of Propionibacterium(Induced by lipid-rich sebum)|Propionibacterium produces lipase|Lyses of TG & release of FFA|FFA cause increased follicular keratinization|Follicular plug|Obstruction of hair follicle opening|Obstruction to the flow of sebum. About other optionso An epidermoid cyst is a keratin-containing cyst lined by the epidermis. It develops due to the proliferation of surface epidermal cells into the dermis, o Mi Ilia is a miniature epidermoid cysto Milliria arises due to blockage of sweat glands.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e. Good oral hygiene. Intubation can be done in two ways: Orotracheal intubation. Nasotracheal intubation. Orotracheal intubation is the preferred technique in most cases. It is most suited to an emergency situation (nasotracheal intubation requires a little extra time. Orotracheal intubation under direct larynx goscopy is generally the easier route and the one of choice in unstable patients when rapid re-establishment of the airway is essential. Nasotracheal intubation is better tolerated during prolonged mechanical ventilation. Nasotracheal intubation has certain drawbacks. Increased risk of nosocomial sinusitis. Increased risk of mucosal damage and bleeding, therefore, nasotracheal intubation should be avoided in coagulopathies. Restricted movement of the endotracheal tube. Complications of orotracheal tube occur due to. Occlusion or displacement of the tube and airway trauma.",
