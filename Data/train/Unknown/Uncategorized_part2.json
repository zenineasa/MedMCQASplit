        "question": "Which electrolyte abnormality occurs during TURP-",
        "exp": "Ans- B Hyponatremia Ref Introduction Trans Urethral Resection of Prostate (TURP) is the second most common surgical procedure (after cataract extraction) done in men over the age of 65 years. Advancement in technology has enabled the urologists to reach all corners of the urinary system using endoscopes, causing minimum trauma to the patient. Endoscopic procedures in the urinary system require the use of irrigating fluids to gently dilate the mucosal spaces, remove blood, cut tissue and debris from the operating field and enable better vision. In spite of the best of efforts to understand and prevent the various complications of endoscopic procedures, incidence of some of the inherent complications have remained the same and still daunt the urologists. Aberrations in the Central Nervous System (CNS), Cardio Vascular System (CVS) and other systems which manifest due to the absorption of irrigating fluids during TURP are together known as TURP Syndrome. Though it is called TURP Syndrome, this complication can occur during other endoscopic procedures also namely Uretero-Renoscopy (URS), Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL), Trans Cervical Resection of Endometrium (TCRE), etc. Despite improvements in the current surgical and anesthetic management, 2. 5 - 20% of patients undergoing TURP show one or more manifestations of TURP syndrome and 0. 5% - 5% die perioperatively. Signs and Symptoms TURP syndrome may occur at any time perioperatively and has been observed as early as few minutes after surgery has started and as late as several hours after surgery has been completed. When under regional anesthesia, the patient characteristically complains of Dizziness Headache Nausea Tight feeling in the chest and throat Shortness of breath Restlessness Confusion Retching Abdominal pain Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures rise and the heart rate decreases. If not treated promptly, the patient may become cyanotic and hypotensive and go in for cardiac arrest. Some patients present with neurological symptoms. Initially they become lethargic and then unconscious. Their pupils dilate and react sluggishly to light. This may be followed by short episodes of tonic-clonic seizures leading to a state of coma. Under General Anesthesia (GA), the diagnosis of TURP Syndrome is difficult and often delayed. The usual signs are unexplained rise and then a fall in BP and refractory bradycardia. ECG changes such as nodal rhythm, ST changes, U waves and widening of QRS complexes may be observed. Recovery from GA and muscle relaxants may be delayed. Irrigation Solutions Irrigating fluids are used during endourological procedures for better vision. Ideally the irrigation solution should be isotonic, non hemolytic, electrically inert (so that diathermy can be used), non toxic, transparent, easy to sterilize and inexpensive. Unfortunately, a solution having all these qualities is not yet available. Electrolyte solutions such as normal saline or Ringer Lactate do least harm when absorbed into the circulation. However they cause dispersion of high frequency current from the resectoscope and hence abandoned. A variety of other irrigating fluids have been in use, each having its own merits and demerits. Sterile water: Though sterile water has many qualities of an ideal irrigating fluid, the disadvantage is its extreme hypotonicity, causing hemolysis, dilutional hyponatremia, shock and renal failure. Glycine 1. 2%, 1. 5%. 2. 2%: Glycine, an endogenous amino acid has been suggested as a suitable irrigating fluid considering its many advantages, including the low cost, though not as cheap as sterile water. Glycine is isotonic with plasma only at a concentration of 2. 2%, but the side effects of glycine at this concentration are more. The osmolality of 1. 5% glycine is 230 mosm/1 compared to serum osmolality of 290 mosm/l and hence cardiovascular and renal toxicities can occur at this concentration also. Further lowering of the concentration of glycine can lead to more complications due to hypotonicity and hence cannot be used for irrigation purposes. The distinct advantage of 1. 5% glycine over sterile water is its tendency to cause less hemolysis and renal failure. Mannitol 3%: Mannitol, though does not have the toxicities of glycine, drives water out of cells and may enhance circulatory overloading. The cost of mannitol is also higher compared to glycine. The elimination of mannitol through kidney will be decreased in patients with impaired renal function. Glucose 2. 5% - 4%: This is not a widely used irrigating fluid since glucose produces tissue charring at the site of resection and associated hyperglycemia produced when glucose is absorbed into the circulation. It also causes stickiness of surgeons' gloves and instruments. Cytal: Cytal, a mixture of sorbitol 2. 7% and mannitol 0. 54% widely used in USA as an irrigating fluid, has not gained popularity in India due to its high cost and nonavailability. In the body, sorbitol is metabolised to fructose, which may present problems in a patient with hypersensitivity to fructose. Urea 1%: This produces urea crystallisation on the instruments during resection and hence not preferred. 1. 5% glycine and sterile water are the most widely used irrigating fluids in urological endoscopic surgeries. Pathophysiology 1. Circulatory Overload The uptake of small amounts of irrigating fluids has been shown to occur during almost every TURP and TCRE, through the venous network of prostatic bed and endometrium respectively. Spontaneous leakage through Fallopian tube More Detailss increases fluid absorption during TCRE. The fluid absorption has been studied by the expired breath ethanol tests after the addition of ethanol up to a concentration of 1 % to the irrigating fluid. The uptake of I litre of fluid within one hour, which corresponds to an acute decrease in the serum sodium concentration of 5-8 mmols/l, is the volume above which the risk of absorption related symptoms is statistically increased., The average rate of fluid absorption during TURP is 20 ml/min. Due to circulatory overload, the blood volume increases, systolic and diastolic pressures increase and the heart may fail. The absorbed fluid dilutes the serum proteins and decreases the oncotic pressure of blood. This, concurrent with the elevated blood pressure, drives fluid from the vascular to interstitial compartment causing pulmonary and cerebral edema. In addition to direct absorption into the circulation, a significant volume (upto 70%) of the irrigation solution has been found to accumulate interstitially, in the periprostatic and retroperitoneal spaces. For every 100 ml of fluid entering the interstitial compartment, 10-15 meq of sodium also moves with it. Though the duration of surgery has not been conclusively proved to be the determinant for the volume of fluid absorbed, morbidity and mortality were found to be definitely higher when surgery was prolonged over 90 minutes. Intravascular absorption correlates well with the size of the prostate, while interstitial absorption depends primarily on the integrity of prostatic capsule. Circulatory overload occurs when the weight of the gland is more than 45 grams. Another important factor that determines the rate of absorption of fluid is the hydrostatic pressure at the prostatic bed. This pressure depends on the height of irrigating fluid column and the pressure inside the bladder during surgery. The ideal height of irrigating fluid is 60 cm so that approximately 300 ml. of fluid is obtained per minute during resection for good vision. 2. Water Intoxication Some patients with TURP syndrome present symptoms of water intoxication, a neurological disorder caused by increased water content of the brain. The patient becomes first somnolent and then incoherent and restless. Seizures may also develop leading on to coma in decerebrate position. There will be clonus and positive Babinski responses. Papilloedema, with dilated, sluggishly reacting pupils can occur. The EEG will show low voltage, bilaterally. The symptoms of water intoxication appear when serum sodium level falls 15 - 20 meq/l below normal level. 3. Hyponatremia Sodium is essential for proper function of excitatory cells, particularly those of heart and brain. Several mechanisms lead to hyponatremia in TURP patients.,,, Dilution of serum sodium through excessive absorption of irrigation solution. Loss of sodium into the stream of the irrigation fluid from the prostatic resection site. Loss of sodium into pockets of irrigation solution accumulated in the periprostatic and retroperitoneal spaces. Larger amounts of glycine stimulate the release of atrial natriuretic peptide in excess of that expected by the volume load, which further promote natriuresis. The symptoms of hyponatremia are restlessness, confusion, incoherence, coma and seizures. When serum sodium falls below 120 meq/1, hypotension and reduced inyocardial contractility occur. Below 115 meq/1, bradycardia and widening of QRS complexes, ventricular ectopics and T wave inversion occur. Below 100 meq/1 generalised seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and cardiac arrest occur. Sodium requirement is calculated by the following formula: Sodium Deficit = Normal serum Na - Estimated serum Na x Volume of body water (Body water is usually 60% of body water) 4. Glycine Toxicity Excess of glycine absorbed into circulation is toxic to heart and retina and may lead to hyperammonemia. Experimentally glycine has been found to reduce the vitality and survival of isolated cardiomyocytes. In patients, glycine 1. 5 % has been associated with subacute effects on the myocardium, manifested as depression or inversion of the T wave on the electrocardiogram 24 hr after surgery. Absorption exceeding 500 ml has been shown to double the long-term risk of acute myocardial infarction. This may be one of the reasons for the higher long-term mortality after transurethral versus open prostatectomy, which has been a debate among urologists for some years. TURP seems to depress myocardial function, particularly when the operative duration exceeds 1 hr and when glycine is used at room temperature. About 0. 5% of patients develop acute myocardial infarction during TURP, though transient myocardial ischemia has been detected during 20% of TURPs. Dilutional hypocalcemia has also been implicated as a source of acute cardiovascular disturbances when glycine is absorbed., However calcium is restored more rapidly, probably due to mobilisation of calcium from bone tissues. Glycine is known to be a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord and in the brain stem, probably acting in the same manner as gamma amino butyric acid on the chloride ion channel. Too high a concentration may therefore cause severe depressant effect on the CNS and visual disturbances. Glycolic acid, formate and formaldehyde are other metabolites of glycine and these too can cause visual disturbances. The signs of glycine toxicity are nausea, vomiting, slow respiration, seizures, spells of apnoea and cyanosis, hypotension, oliguria, anuria and then death. When arginine, another nonessential amino acid is added to the glycine infusion, the toxic effect of glycine on the heart is blunted. The mechanism by which arginine protects the heart is unknown. The normal value of serum glycine in man is 13-17 mg/l. Glycine toxicity is very uncommon in TURP patients probably because most of the absorbed glycine is retained in the periprostatic and retroperitoneal spaces, where it has no systemic effect. 5. Ammonia Toxicity Ammonia is a major by-product of glycine metabolism. \" High ammonia concentration suppresses norepinephrine and dopamine release in the brain. This causes the encephalopathy of TURP syndrome. Fortunately ammonia toxicity is rare in man. Characteristically the toxicity occurs within one hour after surgey. The patient develops nausea and vomiting and then lapses into coma. Blood ammonia rises above 500 micromols/1 (normal value is 11-35 micromols/1). Hyperammonemia lasts for over ten hours postoperatively, probably because glycine continues to be absorbed from the periprostatic space. It is not clear why hyperammonemia does not develop in all TURP patients. Hyperammonemia implies that the body cannot fully metabolize glycine through the glycine cleavage system, citric acid cycle and conversion to glycolic acid and glyoxylic acid. Another possible explanation is arginine deficiency. Ammonia is normally converted to urea in the liver via the ornithine cycle. Arginine is one of the intermediary products necessary for this cycle. When a patient has arginine deficiency, ornithine cycle is not fuelled and thus ammonia accumulates. 6. Hypovolemia, Hypotension The classical hemodynamic signs of the TURP syndrome, when glycine is used as irrigating fluid, consist of a transient arterial hypertension, that may be absent if the bleeding is profuse, followed by more prolonged hypotension., Release of prostatic tissue substances and endotoxins into the circulation and associated metabolic acidosis might contribute to this hypotension.,, Blood loss during TURP leads to hypovolemia, causing significant loss in oxygen carrying capacity leading to myocardial ischemia and infarction. Blood loss correlates with the size of prostatic gland resected, duration of surgery and skill of the surgeon. The average blood loss during TURP is 10 m1/gram of prostate resected. 7. Visual Disturbances One of the most alarming complications of TURP syndrome is transient blindness, foggy vision and seeing halos around objects.,, The pupils may be dilated and unresponsive. The optic disc appears normal. The symptom can coexist with other features of TURP syndrome or can be an isolated symptom. The vision returns to normal in 8-48 hours after surgery. TURP blindness is caused by retinal dysfunction probably due to glycine toxicity. Hence perception of light and blink reflexes are preserved and pupillary responses to light and accommodation are lost in TURP blindness, unlike in blindness due to cerebral cortical dysfunction. 8. Perforations Perforation of urinary bladder can occur during TURP due to surgical instrumentation, in difficult resections, overdistension of bladder and rarely explosion inside the bladder. Instrumental perforation of the prostatic capsule has been estimated to occur in 1% of patients undergoing TURP., An early sign of perforation, which often goes unnoticed, is a decreased return of irrigating fluid from the bladder. Abdominal pain, distension, nausea and distress follow. Bradycardia and arterial hypotension are profound. There is also a high risk of failure to diurese spontaneously. In intraperitoneal perforation, symptoms develop faster. Referred shoulder pain due to irritation of diaphragm and hiccoughs are characteristic symptoms., Pallor, diaphoresis, abdominal rigidity, nausea, vomiting and hypotension can occur. In extraperitoneal perforation, reflex movements of lower limbs may occur. Explosions inside the bladder are fortunately rare. Cauterisation of prostatic tissue is believed to liberate flammable gases. Normally not enough oxygen will be available inside the bladder to permit an explosion. But when air enters with the irrigant, explosions can occur. 9. Coagulopathies Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) or consumption coagulopathy can occur due to release of prostatic particles rich in tissue thromboplastins into the circulation causing secondary fibrinolysis. Dilutional thrombocytopenia can aggravate the situation. DIC can be detected in the blood by a decrease in platelet count, high levels of fibrin degradation products (FDP, >150 mg/dl) and low plasma fibrinogen levels (400 mg/dl). 10. Bacteremia, Septicemia and Toxemia About 30% of all TURP patients have infected urine preoperatively. When prostatic venous sinuses are opened preoperatively and high pressure irrigation is used, bacteria enter the circulation. In about 6% of patients, the bacteremia is complicated by septicemia. Absorption of bacterial endotoxins and toxic byproducts of tissue coagulation may lead to a toxic state in some patients postoperatively. Severe chills, fever, capillary dilatation and hypotension can occur temporarily in these patients. 11. Hypothermia Hypothermia is a frequent observation in patients undergoing TURP. A drop in the body temperature alters the hemodynamic situation, results in shivering and markedly increases oxygen consumption. Bladder irrigation is an important source of heat loss and the use of irrigating fluids at room temperature results in a decrease in body temperature of 1-2deg C. This is aggravated by the cold atmospheric temperature of operation theatre. Elderly patients are particularly susceptible to hypothermia because of possible autonomic dysfunction. The associated vasoconstriction and acidosis can adversely affect the heart and can contribute to CNS manifestations. Shivering can also enhance bleeding from the resection site. Prophylaxis Against TURP Syndrome Identification of early symptoms of TURP syndrome and prevention is essential to retard the onset of severe and fatal manifestations in patients undergoing endoscopic surgeries. Pre-existing hyponatremia should be identified and corrected, especially in patients on diuretics and low salt diet. Prophylactic antibiotics may have a role in the prevention of bacteremia and septicemia. Central Venous Pressure (CVP) monitoring or pulmonary artery catheterisation is necessary in patients with cardiac illness. The ideal height of irrigating fluid is 60 cm. The duration of TURP should be restricted to 1 hour, and in cases requiring more duration of resection, staged TURP should be performed. Prostatic capsule should be preserved as far as possible and distension of bladder avoided. Continuous flow methods have been claimed to decrease fluid absorption, whereas some authors have found no such reduction. Serum sodium should be estimated every 30 minutes and necessary corrections should be made. The fluid therapy should be restricted to maintain optimum hemodynamics. Prophylactic frusemide should be given to avoid fluid overload. Whenever possible, packed cells should be preferred to whole blood for transfusion to avoid circulatory overload. Increasing the atmospheric temperature of operation theatre, use of warm blankets, mattresses and intravenous fluids and using irrigating fluids prewarmed to 37deg C help to avoid hypothermia. General Anesthesia vs Regional Anesthesia in TURP TURP performed under regional anesthesia without sedation (Awake TURP) is preferable to general anesthesia due to the following reasons: Early manifestations of TURP syndrome are better detected in awake patients. Peripheral vasodilatation helps to minimize circulatory overloading. Provides some degree of postoperative analgesia. Blood loss will be less. However the possible sudden hemodynamic fluctuations of spinal or epidural anesthesia should be taken into consideration before administering regional anesthesia. Treatment The treatment of TURP syndrome involves correction of various pathophysiological mechanisms operating in body homeostasis.,,,, Ideally the treatment has to be instituted before serious CNS or cardiac complications occur. When TURP syndrome is diagnosed, surgical procedure should be terminated as early as possible. Frusemide should be administered in a dose of 1 mg/kg intravenously. However, the use of frusemide to treat TURP syndrome has been questioned because it increases sodium excretion. Hence 15% mannitol has been suggested as a better choice, due to its action independent of sodium excretion and its tendency to increase extracellular osmolality. Oxygen should be administered by nasal cannula. Pulmonary edema should be managed by tracheal intubation and positive pressure ventilation with 100% oxygen. Arterial blood gases, hemoglobin and serum sodium are to be estimated. Correction of hyponatremia should be done by diuresis and slow administration of 3-5% hypertonic saline at the rate of not more than 0. 5 meq/1 per hour or not faster than 100 ml/hr. Approximately 200 ml of hypertonic saline is needed for correction of hyponatremia. Rapid administration of saline leads to pulmonary edema and central pontine myelinolysis. Two-thirds of the hypertonic saline restores serum sodium and osmolality, while one-third redistributes water from cells to the extracellular space, where it becomes available to diuretic treatment with frusemide. Intravenous calcium may be used to treat acute cardiac disturbances during surgery. Seizures should be managed by diazepam/midazolam/barbiturate/dilantin or a muscle relaxant depending on the severity. Significant blood loss should be managed by administering packed red cells. In cases of DIC, fibrinogen 3-4 gms should be given intravenously followed by heparin infusion 2000 units bolus (and then 500 units per hour). Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and platelets may also be used depending on the coagulation profile. Surgical drainage of retroperitoneal fluid in cases of perforation can reduce the morbidity and mortality significantly.",

        "exp": "Ans: B (Type II Pneumocytes) Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th edition. Explanation: The surfactant is produced by type II alveolar cells. Type II pneumocytes also called alveolar type II cells, great alveolar cells or septal cells are granular and roughly cuboidal in shape. Type II pneumocytes are typically found at the alveolar-septal junction. Although they comprise 60% of the alveolar lining cells, because of their shape they cover a much smaller surface area than type I cells (<5%). Type II cells start to develop at about 24 weeks of gestation, secreting small amounts of surfactant. However, adequate amounts of surfactant are not secreted until about 35 weeks of gestation - this is the main reason for increased incidence rates of Infant respiratory distress syndrome, which drastically reduces at ages above 35 weeks gestation. Type II cells are responsible for the production and secretion of surfactant (the majority of which are dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine). a group of phospholipids that reduce the alveolar surface tension. Surfactant phospholipids are stored in Type II pneumocytes in lamellar bodies, which are specialized vesicles. The release of surfactant in lamellar bodies occurs from an infant's first breath onwards. Type II pneumocytes can replicate in the alveoli and will replicate to replace damaged Type I pneumocytes. MUC1, a human gene associated with type II pneumocytes. has been identified as a marker in lung cancer. Clara cells. These are dome-shaped cells with short microvilli found in the small airways {bronchioles) of the lungs. Clara cells are found in the ciliated simple epithelium. These cells may secrete glycosaminoglycans to protect the bronchiole lining. Bronchiolar cells gradually increase in number as the number of goblet cells decreases.",

        "exp": "The patient most likely has a delayed onset of puberty rather than a destructive lesion in the hypothalamic/pituitary axis, a primary disease involving the ovaries or a problem involving the end-organs (e. g., imperfo\u00adrate hymen). Note that she has normal secondary sex characteristics indicating the presence of estrogen. She had withdrawal bleeding after being given progester\u00adone, which proves that the endometrial mucosa has already been primed with estrogen. In addition, a normal menstrual flow implies the absence of an end organ defect preventing menses from occurring. Primary amenorrhea refers to the absence of men\u00adstruation by age 16 years. As a general rule, amenorrhea is the hallmark for hypogonadism, assuming that no end-organ abnormalities are present. As with second\u00adary amenorrhea, primary amenorrhea is subdivided on the basis of gonadotropin levels (follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone ). Amenorrhea in the presence of elevated gonadotropins is designated as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (primary ovarian disease), while reduced gonadotropin levels is called hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (hy\u00adpothalamic/pituitary disease). Normal levels of FSH and LH in the presence of normal secondary sex char\u00adacteristics usually indicate an end-organ abnormality. Absence of secondary sex characterisitics by age 16 years is always a more significant finding than having a patient with normal secondary sex characteristics. In addition to ordering gonadotropin levels, a pro\u00adgesterone challenge is an excellent test to perform in the initial evaluation of these patients. The absence of menses confirms that there is a problem, but it does not differentiate among the three main areas previously cited. Withdrawal bleeding indicates that the endometrial mucosa must have been primed with estrogen, so the hypothalamic/pituitary axis and ova\u00adries must be normal.

        "exp": "Ans- C Ref- Preferred imaging modalities Patients who may be referred for imaging of the adrenal glands include those with new or worsening diabetes mellitus (owing to impaired glucose regulation) and those with hypertensive crisis after anesthesia, surgery, or treatment with medications. Imaging may also be performed in patients with a known history of multiple endocrine problems. Computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have higher sensitivity in detecting pheochromocytomas than nuclear medicine scanning with iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG), although 131I-MIBG uptake is more specific. Some authors prefer to use MIBG uptake scanning as the initial screening modality because it enables whole-body imaging, making it useful for the detection of extra-adrenal tumors and metastatic deposits. Once an adrenal or extra-adrenal tumor is detected, CT scanning or MRI of the region may be performed for anatomic localization prior to surgical removal. If 131I-MIBG uptake is negative but the clinical findings suggest pheochromocytoma, CT scanning or MRI of the chest or abdomen may be performed, because the false-negative rate of MIBG scintigraphy is 10%. Luster et al investigated the specificity and sensitivity of (18)F-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, CT scanning, and a combination of the 2 modalities in the identification and localization of adrenal and extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. Nineteen lesions were detected by all 3 imaging methods, but only DOPA PET/CT scanning accurately characterized and localized them all, demonstrating, on a per-patient basis, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88%. A further study by Gaertner et al concluded the (18)F-LMI1195 is a promising tracer for tumor imaging. Saad et al found in a study of 23 patients with a history of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma that (18)F-FDG PET/CT was a superior tool for the localization of recurrent tumors.

Occurs in all ages, but most common in older adults; often arise at extranodal sites; aggressive. Burkitt lymphoma. Intermediate-sized round lymphoid cells with several nucleoli; diffuse tissue involvement associated with apoptosis produces a \"starry-sky\" appearance. Mature CD10+B cells expressing surface Ig. Endemic in Africa, sporadic elsewhere; increased frequency in immune suppressed patients; predominantly affects children; often presents with visceral involvement; highly aggressive. Plasmacytoma/ plasma cell myeloma. Plasma cells in sheets, sometimes with prominent nucleoli or inclusions containing Ig. Terminally differentiated plasma cells containing cytoplasmic Ig. Myeloma presents as a disseminated bone disease, often with destructive lytic lesions. Hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, and bacterial infections are common. Mycosis fungoides. In most cases, small lymphoid cells with markedly convoluted nuclei; cells often infiltrate the epidermis (Pautrier microabscesses)CD4+mature T cells. Presents with localized or more generalized skin involvement; generally indolent. Sezary syndrome, a more aggressive variant, is characterized by diffuse skin erythema and peripheral blood involvement. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (NOS). Variable; usually a spectrum of small to large lymphoid cells with irregular nuclear contours. Mature T-cell phenotype (CD3+). Probably spans a diverse collection of rare tumors. Often disseminated, generally aggressive. Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis type. Lacunar Reed-Sternberg cell variants in a mixed inflammatory background; broad sclerotic bands of collagen usually also present. CD15+, CD30+Reed- Sternberg cells. Most common in young adults, often arises in the mediastinum or cervical lymph nodes. Hodgkin lymphoma, mixed cellularity type. Frequent classic Reed- Sternberg cells in a mixed inflammatory background. CD15+, CD30+Reed- Sternberg cells. Most common in men, more likely to present at advanced stages than the nodular sclerosis type EBV+in 70% of cases",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e. Apoptosis Apoptosis is a programmed cell death. Mechanism of Apoptosis. Apoptosis is induced by a cascade of molecular events that may be initiated in distinct ways but culminate in the activation of caspases. Caspases are central to the pathogenesis of apoptosis. The process of apoptosis is divided into two phases. Initiation phase - During this phase caspases become catalytically active. Execution phase - During this phase caspases act to cause cell death. Initiation phase of apoptosis. Initiation of apoptosis occurs principally by signals from two distinct but convergent pathways. Extrinsic or receptor-initiated pathway. Intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway. Extrinsic or death receptor-initiated pathway. This pathway is initiated by expression of cell surface death receptors on a variety of cells. Death receptors are members of tumor necrosis factor receptor family that contain a cytoplasmic domain involved in protein-protein interactions that are called death domain because it is essential for delivering apoptotic signals (or death signals). The best-known death receptors are the type 1 TNF receptor (TNFRI) and a related protein called Fas (CD95). When the Fas receptors are cross-linked by its ligand it triggers a sequence of events which eventually leads to activation of caspases. This pathway of apoptosis can be inhibited by a protein called FLIP, which can bind to inactive or procaspases but cannot cleave and activate these enzymes. The intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. This pathway has no role for death receptors. This pathway is the result of increased mitochondrial permeability and the release of proapoptotic molecules in the cytoplasm. Note that antiapoptotic proteins reside in the mitochondrial membrane (Bcl-2 and Bcl-X). When cells are deprived of survival signals or subjected to stress Bcl-2 and Bcl-X are lost from the mitochondrial membrane and are replaced by proapoptotic members of the family such as Bak, Bax, and Bim. This leads to increase in the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane. Due to increased permeability of the mitochondrial membrane, several proteins that can activate the caspase leak out. One of these proteins is cytochrome C, well known for its role in mitochondrial respiration. In the cytoplasm, cytochrome binds to a protein called Apaf-1 (apoptosis-activating factor-1) and the complex activates caspase.* So, the final result of both the pathways that are extrinsic receptor mediated pathway and the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway is the same i. e. activation of the caspase. The execution phase of apoptosis. After being activated the caspases act on many cellular components. They cleave cytoskeletal and nuclear matrix proteins and thus disrupts the cytoskeleton. They also lead to the breakdown of the nucleus. In the nucleus, the' target of caspase activation includes proteins involved in transcription, DNA replication and. DNA repair.",

        "exp": "Tolerance to organic nitrates may develop in a few days or less, depending on the dose and frequency of administration. Continuous exposure to nitroglycerin through use of a transdermal skin patch has frequently caused nitrate tolerance. A daily 10-to-14-hour drug \u00adfree period will prevent nitrate tolerance. Nitrate tolerance is a cellular tolerance caused by depletion of sulfhydryl groups required for receptor signal trans\u00adduction. The drug-free interval allows time for these groups to replenish before the next period of drug exposure. Nitrates are metabolized by hepatic nitro reductase, and there is neither evidence of cytochrome P 450 involvement nor of induction of this enzyme by drugs. Although the patient's symptoms could be caused by increased physical activity or onset of vaso\u00adspasm, these are less likely causes in a patient with continuous nitroglycerin exposure.

The change in lung volume per unit change in the airway pressure (DV/DP) is the stretchability (compliance) of the lungs and chest wall. 0 It is in pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema; increased in emphysema and normal aging. COMPLIANCE OF THE LUNGS & CHEST WALL # The interaction between the recoil of the lungs and recoil of the chest can be demonstrated in living subjects through a spirometer that has a valve just beyond the mouthpiece. # The respiratory muscles are then relaxed while the pressure in the airway is recorded. The procedure is repeated after inhaling or actively exhaling various volumes. The curve of airway pressure obtained in this way, plotted against volume, is the relaxation pressure curve of the total respiratory system. # The pressure is zero at a lung volume that corresponds to the volume of gas in the lungs at the end of quiet expiration (functional residual capacity, or FRC; also known as relaxation volume). It is positive at greater volumes and negative at smaller volumes. # The change in lung volume per unit change in airway pressure (V/P) is the compliance (stretchability) of the lungs and chest wall. It is normally measured in the pressure range where the relaxation pressure curve is steepest, and the normal value is approximately 0. 2 L/cm H-, 0. However, compliance depends on lung volume; an individual with only one lung has approximately half the V for a given P. # Compliance is also slightly greater when measured during deflation than when measured during inflation. Consequently, it is more informative to examine the whole pressure - volume curve. # The curve is shifted downward and to the right (compliance is decreased) by pulmonary congestion and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive restrictive airway disease of unknown cause in which there is stiffening and scarring of the lung. The curve is shifted upward and to the left (compliance is increased) in emphysema. It should be noted that compliance is a static measure of lung and chest recoil. # The resistance of the lung and chest is the pressure difference required for a unit of air flow; this measurement, which is dynamic rather than static, also takes into account the resistance to air flow in the airways. Educational point: The total compliance of both lungs together in the normal adult human being averages about 200 mil- liliters of air %imeter of water transpulmonary pressure. That is, every time the transpulmonary pressure increases 1 centimeter of water, the lung volume, after 10 to 20 seconds, will expand 200 milliliters.",

        "exp": "Ans- D Ref- The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 was enacted by the Parliament during 1994 and came into force on February 4, 1995 in the States of Goa, Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra and all the Union Territories. Thereafter it was adopted by all States except the States of Jammu & Kashmir and Andhra Pradesh, which have their own legislations to regulate transplantation of Human Organs. Purpose of the Act The main purpose of the Act is to regulate the removal, storage and transplantation of human organs for therapeutic purposes and to prevent commercial dealings in human organs. The Act contains detailed provisions relating to the authority for removal of human organs, preservation of human organs, regulation of hospitals conducting the removal, storage or transplantation of human organs, functions of appropriate authority, registration of hospitals and punishment/penalties for offences relating to aforesaid matters. For more information, visit THOA Act - 1994 Transplantation of Human Organs (Amendment) Act, 2011 The Government of India enacted the Transplantation of Human Organs (Amendment) Act, 2011 that allows swapping of organs and widens the donor pool by including grandparents and grandchildren in the list. Some of the important amendments under this Act to promote organ donation are as follows. Provision of 'Retrieval Centres' for retrieval of organs from deceased donors and their registration under the amended Act. Definition of near relative expanded to include grandparents and grandchildren. Brain death certification Board has been simplified and more experts have been permitted for this certification. 'Mandatory' inquiry and informing option to donate in case of unfortunate event of brain stem death of ICU patient for the purpose of organ donation. Mandatory 'Transplant Coordinator' for coordinating all matters relating to removal or transplantation of human organs. National Human Organs and Tissues Removal and Storage Network at one or more places and regional network. National Registry of Donors and Recipients. Removal of eye has been permitted by a trained technician to facilitate eye donation. Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Rules (THOT), 2014 The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Rules (THOT), 2014 has many provisions to remove the impediments to organ donation while curbing misuse/misinterpretation of the rules. The following are a few The medical practitioner who will be part of the organ transplantation team for carrying out transplantation operation shall not be a member of the Authorisation Committee constituted under the Act. When the proposed donor or recipient or both are not Indian nationals or citizens whether near relatives or otherwise, the Authorisation Committee shall consider all such requests and the transplantation shall not be permitted if the recipient is a foreign national and donor is an Indian national unless they are near relatives. When the proposed donor and the recipient are not near relatives, the Authorisation Committee shall evaluate that there is no commercial transaction between the recipient and the donor and that no payment has been made to the donor or promised to be made to the donor or any other person Cases of swap donation referred to under subsection shall be approved by Authorisation Committee of hospital or district or State in which transplantation is proposed to be done and the donation of organs shall be permissible only from near relatives of the swap recipients. When the recipient is in a critical condition in need of life saving organ transplantation within a week, the donor or recipient may approach hospital in-charge to expedite evaluation by the Authorisation Committee. The quorum of the Authorisation Committee should be minimum four and is not complete without the participation of the Chairman, Secretary (Health) or nominee and Director of Health Services or nominee. Every authorised transplantation centre must have its own website. The Authorisation Committee is required to take final decision within twenty four hours of holding the meeting for grant of permission or rejection for transplant and the decision of the Authorisation Committee should be displayed on the notice board of the hospital and the website within twenty four hours of taking the decision. The website of transplantation centre shall be linked to State/Regional/National Networks through online system for organ procurement, sharing and transplantation. There would be an apex national networking organization at the centre. There would also be regional and State level networking organizations where large of number of transplantation of organ(s) or tissue (s) are performed. The State units would be linked to hospitals, Organ/Tissue matching Labs and Tissue Banks within their area and also to regional and national networking organisations. Such networks shall coordinate procurement, storage, transportation, matching, allocation and transplantation of organs/tissues and shall develop norms and standard operating procedures. A National Registry on Donors and recipients of Human Organ and Tissue accessible on-line through dedicated website having National, Regional and State level specificities will come into force. National/Regional registry shall be compiled based on similar registries at State level. The identity of the people in the database shall not be in public domain.",

        "exp": "Bartter syndrome is a mineralocorticoid excess state caused by a defect in chloride reabsorption in the kidneys. The defect in chloride reabsorption in the ascending tubule also affects the reabsorption of so\u00addium; therefore, there is an augmented distal delivery of sodium with increased exchange of sodium for po\u00adtassium and hydrogen ions in the distal tubule, produc\u00ading a hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Hypokalemia is a stimulus of renin release from the juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus, which results in JG apparatus hyper\u00adplasia. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldoste\u00adrone system increases the production of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Hypokalemia also increases the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 and 12 in the kidneys. Both of these chemical mediators are potent vasodila\u00adtors. Angiotensin II and aldosterone stimulate the syn\u00adthesis of renal kallikrein, which is then converted into bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. Because of this se\u00adquence of events, patients with Bartter syndrome do not develop hypertension, even in the presence of the excess aldosterone and angiotensin II, because their hypertensive effects are offset by the vasodilatation induced by the prostaglandins and bradykinin.

        "question": "In a neonate with asymptomatic hypoglycemia immediate Rx should include which of the following?",
        "exp": "Ans. B 2 ml/kg 10% Dextrose (Ref. OP Ghai 7th/pg. 155, Reference: ) Neonatal Hypoglycemia: # A blood glucose value of < 40 mg/dL (plasma glucose < 45 mg/dL). # Hypoglycemia in first 18-36 hrs is usually due to transient neonatal hypoglycemia and after 36 hrs metabolic and other causes are likely. # Persistent/recurrent hypoglycemia is defined as requiring either parenteral glucose for > 7 days or high IV glucose infusion rates (>12-16 mg/kg/min). Etiopathogenesis: # High risk factors of hypoglycemia include: 1) Infants of diabetic mothers many of whom are LGA, 2) All macrosomic (LGA) infants (mothers may have occult diabetes), 3) SGA, (i. e., intrauterine stressed) infants, 4) Stressed infants (i. e., difficult delivery, low Apgar <7 at five minutes), 5) Infants of mothers on tocolytics (terbutaline, ritodrine), oral hypoglycemics or propranolol within 72 hrs before delivery, 6) Premature infants (<37 weeks gestational age), 7) Postmature infants (>42 weeks gestational age). A) Transient hypoglycemia: 1. Maternal conditions causing transient hypoglycemia: a. Intrapartum glucose given at too high a rate to the mother. b. Drug Rx (terbutaline, ritodrine, propranolol, oral hypoglycemics). c. Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR): placental insufficiency resulting in SGA infant. d. Diabetes in pregnancy (hyperinsulinism). 2. Neonatal conditions causing transient hypoglycemia: a. Failure to adapt extrauterine life b. Birth asphyxia c. Infection/sepsis d. Hyperviscosity e. Congenital heart disease f. Erythroblastosis fetalis g. Hypothermia. h. Inadequate calories. i. Other iatrogenic causes: exchange transfusion and/or low lying umbilical artery catheter. j. Decreased glycogen stores: Associated with pre and postmature infants. B) Persistent and/or recurrent hypoglycemia: 1. Hyperinsulinism conditions which cause persistent/recurrent hypoglycemia: a. Nesidioblastosis: rare; hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia due to beta cell hypertrophy. It is on a continuum with islet cell adenoma and usually requires subtotal or total pancreatectomy to treat, however octreotide and diazoxide are useful Rx. b. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome: Visceromegaly, macroglossia, hypoglycemia. 2. Endocrine deficiency conditions which cause persistent/recurrent hypoglycemia: a. Pituitary insufficiency: septo-optic dysplasia, craniofacial defects and anencephaly (Deficiency of pituitary hormones such as growth hormone and ACTH, results in hypoglycemia). b. Cortisol deficiency/adrenal failure. c. Congenital glucagon deficiency. d. Epinephrine deficiency: Extremely rare. 3. Inborn errors of metabolism conditions which cause persistent/recurrent hypoglycemia: a. Carbohydrate metabolism: Galactosemia, glycogen storage disease, fructose intolerance. b. Amino acid meta: MSUD, propionicacidemia, methylmalonic aciduria, tyrosinemia, glutaric acidemia. c. Fatty acid metabolism: Carnitine metabolism defect, Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase defect. Rx: The goal of Rx is to establish normoglycemia, usually defined as a stable glucose value above 40 or 50 mg/dl. Asymptomatic babies: # Asymptomatic infants in the 20-40 mg/dl range may have a trial of oral feeding, but if the glucose fails to normalize, an IV glucose infusion should be started. # Although dextrose 5% oral solution is occasionally used for Rx, formula has the advantage of containing fats and proteins which are metabolized slowly and provide a more sustained level of substrates for glucose production. Blood glucose should be rechecked in 30-60 minutes after feeding. Symptomatic babies: # with severe hypoglycemia (<20 mg/dl), a small IV bolus of dextrose has been shown to raise blood sugar levels safely and more quickly to adequate levels than intravenous infusion alone. # The usual bolus is 2 ml/kg of a dextrose 10% solution given intravenously followed by a glucose infusion rate of 6 to 8 mg/kg/min. The first part of the infusion, i. e., the bolus is given as a dose of ml/kg, but the second part of the infusion is given in mg/kg/min. # A simplified formula for glucose infusion rate (in mg/kg/min) is: Glucose infusion rate (GIR) = (dextrose % concentration X ml/kg/d) / 144 # So if dextrose 10% is used at 80 ml/kg/day that gives us: GIR = (10 x 80) /144 = 800 / 144 = 5. 6 mg/kg/min. # A faster way to figure this out is to use one of the following formulas to achieve a glucose infusion rate of 7 mg/kg/ minute. D5W: IV rate (in ml/hr) = 8. 4 X Body Wt (in kg) D10W: IV rate (in ml/hr) = 4. 2 X Body Wt (in kg) # For a 3 kg newborn infant, using D5W would result in an IV rate of 25 ml/hr, which results in 600 ml/day, or 200 cc/kg/ day, which is too much. This is why D10W must be used instead. The D10W infusion rate using the above formula would still give 100 cc/kg/day. F/U and outcome: # If the plasma glucose cannot be raised by glucose infusion alone, other options include a trial of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone 5-15 mg/kg/day IV in 2-3 divided doses or prednisone 2 mg/kg/day by mouth). # If this fails, other drugs that may be used to raise the plasma glucose include human growth hormone, diazoxide, glucagon or long acting synthetic somatostatin (octreotide). # The first step in evaluating persistent/recurrent hypoglycemia is to obtain serum glucose, insulin, and ketone levels. If the ratio of insulin to glucose (I/G ratio) is >0. 3, then the cause is hyperinsulinism. Ketones should be low or absent in hyperinsulinism.",

Uterine unification operation (metroplasty) is done for cases with bicomuate uteruso Chromosomal anomalies - If chromosomal abnormality is detected in the couples or in the abortus, genetic counseling is undertaken. Karyotyping of the products of conception from future miscarriage is mandatory. Couples with chromosomal translocations or inversion are counseled for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) or prenatal diagnosis (cff DNA, amniocentesis or CVS) in subsequent pregnancy or pregnancy with donor gametes (sperm or oocyte). o Women with PCOS are best treated for their insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenemia. Metformin therapy is helpful. o Endocrine dysfunction: Control of diabetes and thyroid disorders is done. Subclinical diabetes and/or thyroid disease may be treated when no other factor is present. o Genital tract infections are treated appropriately following culture of cervical and vaginaldischarge. Empirical treatment with doxycycline or erythromycin is cost-effective. Note: Operative management of cervical incompetence is done with cerclage operation. o Cerclage operation: Two types of operation are in current use during pregnancy each claiming an equal success rate of about 80-90%. The operations are named after Shirodkar (1955) and Mc. Donald (1963). o Timing of cerclage: In a proven case, prophylactic cerclage should be done around 14 weeks of pregnancy or at least 2 weeks earlier than the lowest period of previous wastage, as early as the 10th week.

In early fluorosis, the first changes are bone deposition and thickening at the junctions of trabeculae. This is seen as sand-like, granular, or particle-like bone structure on radiographs. In more advanced fluorosis, the trabeculae are more generally thickened because of new bone formation on the trabecular surface. At this stage, radiographs show thickening and condensation of trabeculae, with coarse reticulum or woven bone striations. If the trabeculae are fused, focal round densities are seen in the medullary bone. Osteopenia (less common) also may occur in fluorosis, especially in younger patients at an earlier stage 6.

As with other atopic conditions, IgE is raised in atopic dermatitis. Atopic conditions associated with atopic dermatitis. Asthma. Food allergy. Allergic rhinitis. Hay fever. Urticaria (contact). Allergic conjunctivitis. Clinical featureso Atopic dermatitis is an itchy, chronic, fluctuating disease that is slightly more common in boys than girls. The age of onset is between 2 and 6 months in the majority of cases, but it may start at any age, even before the age of 2 months in some cases. The clinical features include: Itching. Macular erythema, papules or papulovesicles. Eczematous areas with crusting. Lichenification and excoriation. Dryness of the skin. Secondary infection. Increased tendency of vasoconstriction:-Pallor on skin esp cheeks i. e. perioral pallor. Running a blunt object on affected skin produces a white line i. e. white dermatographism. Associated conditions: Alopecia aerata. Increase susceptibility1 to insect bite and stings. Antenna sign - follicular plugging with homy plugs.

Patterns of Atopic dermatitis. Infantile phaseo The lesions most frequently start on the face. Often, the napkin area is relatively spared. When the child begins to crawl, the exposed surfaces, especially the extensor aspect of the knees, are most involved, o The lesions consist of erythema and discrete or confluent oedematous papules, o The papules are intensely itchy. Secondary infection and lymphadenopathy are common. Childhood phaseo From 18 to 24 months onwards, the sites most characteristically involved are the elbow and knee flexures, sides of the neck, wrists, and ankles. The sides of the neck may show a striking reticulate pigmentation, sometimes referred to as 'atopic dirty neck'. o The erythematous and oedematous papules tend to be replaced by lichenification. Adult phaseo Lichenifieation, especially of the flexures and hands, is the main feature.

Guidelines of management of acne* Step 1 - For mild acne (< 10 lesions): - Topical therapy is used. Combination therapy is the best. Benzoyl peroxide- erythromycin gel plus topical retinoids combination is used. Topical erythromycin-Benzoyl peroxide gels are applied during the day; topical retinoids are applied in the evening.* Step 2 - For moderate acne (10-25 lesions), and mild acne not responding to topical therapy: - Oral antibiotic is added to the above topical regimen. The most effective antibiotic is minocycline or doxycycline. In females, moderate acne can be controlled with high doses of estrogens combined with progesterone or antiandrogens.* Step 3 - For severe acne, nodulocystic lesions, large nodular lesions, and moderate acne not responding to oral antibiotics (Recalcitrant acne): - Isotretinoin is the drug of choice. Isotretinoin is the single most advance in the management of severe acne. It inhibits sebaceous gland function and keratinization and is very effective. Oral isotretinoin leads to complete remission in almost all cases. If the patient cannot afford isotretinoin, dapsone is a useful alternative. Intralesional steroids can help in the management of cysts and nodules. If there are signs of androgen excess, antiandrogens (cyproterone acetate) can be used with estrogen.",

        "exp": "Ans- D Ref- Supplementary Nutrition Programme The Supplementary Nutrition is one of the six services provided under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme which is primarily designed to bridge the gap between the Recommended Dietary Allowance (FDA) and the Average Daily Intake (ADI). Supplementary Nutrition is given to the children (6 months - 6 years) and pregnant and lactating mothers under the ICDS Scheme. The Government of India, on 24. 2. 2009, has issued revised guidelines on nutritional and feeding norms. States/UTs have been requested to provide supplementary nutrition to children below six years of age and pregnant and lactating mothers, in accordance with the guidelines which have been endorsed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court vide its Order dated 22. 4. 2009. The provision of supplementary nutrition under ICDS Scheme prescribed for various categories of beneficiaries is as follows: (i) Children in the age group of 6 months to 3 years: Food supplement of 500 calories of energy and 12-15 gms. of Protein per child per day as Take Home Ration (THR) in the form of Micronutrient Fortified Food and/or energy-dense food marked as 'ICDS Food Supplement'. (ii) Children in the age group of 3-6 years: Food supplement of 500 calories of energy and 12-15 gms of Protein per child per day. Since a child of this age group is not capable of consuming of meal of 500 calories in one sitting, the guidelines prescribed provision of morning snack in the form of milk/banana/seasonal fruits/Micronutrient Fortified Food etc. and a Hot Cooked Meal. (iii) Severely underweight children: Food supplement of 800 calories of energy and 20-25 gms of Protein per child per day in the form of Micronutrient fortified and/or energy dense food as Take Home Ration. (iv) Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers: Food supplement of 600 calories of energy and 18-20 gms of Protein per day in the form of Micronutrient Fortified Food and/or energy dense food as Take Home Ration. The revised feeding and cost norms under Supplementary Nutrition Progarmme are as under: Sl.

Pregnant women and Nursing mothers 600 18-20 Rs. 5. 00 Under the Strengthened and Restructured ICDS, these rates have been revised to Rs. 6. 00, Rs. 9. 00 and Rs. 7. 00 per beneficiary per day for children (6-72 months), severely malnourished children (6-72 months) and pregnant women and Nursing mothers, respectively. The revised rates are to follow the phased implementation over the 3 years of the Strengthened and Restructured ICDS on the existing cost sharing ratio of 50: 50 between the Centre and the States other than NER where it will continue to be on 90: 10 basis, as under: (i) In 200 high burden districts in the first year (2012-13); (ii) In additional 200 districts in second year (2013-14) (i. e. w. e. f. 1. 4. 2013) including districts from special category States and NER; (iii) In remaining districts in third year (2014-15) (i. e. w. e. f. 1. 4. 2014).",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Synthesised by DNA polymerase d in eukaryotes * Replication is a process by which two ds. DNAs are synthesized from a single ds. DNA. It is done by DNA polymerases. * DNA polymerases can synthesize a new strand only in 5'3' direction. Since they can synthesize a new strand complementary and antiparallel to the template strand, they want the template strand to be in 3'5' direction to synthesize a new strand continuously. * During replication, when the parent strand unwinds, there are two strands - one in 3'5' direction and the other one in 5'3' direction. * The 3'5' strand is treated as leading strand (as against a 3'5' strand, a 5'3' new strand can be synthesized continuously). 5'3' strand will be treated as lagging strand as against a 5'3; strand there is no DNA polymerase to synthesize a new strand in 3'5' direction. So across this 5'3' strand, the DNA polymerases synthesize from the angle of separation. * At the angle of separation, replication fork is formed. Replication fork is made up of Helicase (to cause unwinding of the two strands to enable replication to happen along the whole of DNA), RNA primase (to synthesis the RNA primer that is necessary for DNA polymerase to elongate the DNA strands), DNA polymerase d (to elongate the DNA strands) and single-stranded binding proteins (to prevent the two strands to reanneal). * First RNA primer synthesizes the RNA primer and then DNA polymerase a elongates the first 10 nucleotides of the DNA strand and then it is taken over by DNA polymerase d, which synthesizes 100 to 150 nucleotides. These short fragments with RNA primer attached to DNA fragments synthesized along lagging strand are called OKAZAKI FRAGMENTS. So Okazaki fragments are synthesized by RNA primer, DNA polymerase a and DNA polymerase d. * DNA polymerase d continues the synthesis of DNA strand until it comes across another RNA primer (which is synthesized by the previous replication fork). Here it creates a flap at the 5' end of the RNA primer and that is removed by Flap endonuclease FEN1. * After the RNA primer is removed, DNA polymerase d fills the gap and DNA ligase unites the ends. * In prokaryotes, the process is almost the same, except that the enzymes are different. DNA helicase causes unwinding. RNA primase synthesizes RNA primer. DNA polymerase III synthesizes the DNA fragment. Hence Okazaki fragments are synthesized by RNA primase and DNA polymerase III in prokaryotes. * DNA polymerase III synthesizes DNA fragments until it visualizes an RNA primer (synthesized by previous replication fork). DNA polymerase III recruits DNA polymerase I, which uses its 5*3* exonuclease activity to remove the RNA primer and DNA polymerase I fills the gap and DNA ligase unites the ends.

Key recommendations by WHO The recommended PEP regimens are: For adults: Tenofovir combined with either lamivudine (3. TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) as preferred backbone drugs and these are also the preferred drugs for treating HIV. The recommended third drug is ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r), which is also recommended by WHO as a preferred drug for HIV treatment. For children: Zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3. TC) backbone drugs for children aged 10 or below, with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) recommended as the third drug choice. This is also in alignment with preferred drugs for treating HIV in children. Recommendations for simplifying prescribing approaches and supporting adherence include: Prescribing: To improve uptake and completion of PEP, WHO recommends providing the full 28-day course at first visit, rather than requiring patients to return multiple times for prescriptions. Adherence support: To improve adherence and completion rates, WHO suggests programmes offer enhanced adherence counseling. o Anti-retroviral drug for post-exposure prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible after the exposure within the first few hours and no later than 72 hours. o So, the best answer here is 1-2 hours (first few hours).

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. r., Testis o In hemochromatosis, hypogonadism is caused by impairment of hypothalamic pituitary function and not due to deposition of Iron in the Testis. Hemochromatosiso Hemochromatosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of body iron, most of which is deposited in parenchymal organs such as liver and pancreas. o The total body content of the iron is tightly regulated, as the daily losses are matched by gastrointestinal absorption. In hereditary hemochromatosis, regulation of intestinal absorption of dietary iron is lost, leading to net iron accumulation of 0. 5 to 1. 0 gm/year. o It may be recalled that the total body iron pool ranges from 2-6 gm in normal adults; about 0. 5 gm is stored in the liver 98% of which is hepatocytes. In hemochromatosis the iron accumulation may exceed 50 gm, over one third of which accumulates in the liver. o The iron accumulation is life long, the rate of net iron accumulation is 0. 5 to L0 gm/year. The disease manifests itself typically after 20 gm of storage iron have accumulated. The disease first manifests itself in the fifth to sixth decades of life. o Excessive iron is directly toxic to host tissueso The clinical features of hemochromatosis are characterized principally by deposition of excess iron in the following organs in decreasing order of severity. Liver (95%)o Usually the first organ to be affected, o Hepatomegaly seen in most of the cases, o Micronodular cirrhosis is characteristico Hepatocellular carcinoma develops in 30% patients. Skin (90%)o Excessive skin pigmentation (Bronzing of the skin)o Skin pigmentation results partially due to hemosiderin deposition and mainly due to melanin depositiono Usually diffuse or generalized, but more pronounced on the face, neck and extensor aspects of lower forearms.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Post urethral valve o Forty percent of neonatal ascites is caused by urinary conditions. Urinary' ascites occurs when high intraluminal pressure forces urine to extravasate from the kidney, usually across a renal fornix. Urine then enters the retroperitoneum and travels across the peritoneum as a transudate. o If this urine or ascetic fluid is aspirated from the peritoneal cavity, the ascites or extravasated urine contains electrolyte and creatinine levels similar to those of serum. This is because the urine within the peritoneum is subject to the large absorptive mesothelial surface that quickly normalizes these values, masking the identity of ascitic fluid as urine. The diagnosis of urinary'- ascites may be difficult and may require definitive upper tract drainage in the form of nephrostomy tubes to establish the cause of the ascites and allow' its resolution, o Urinary ascites in the case of distal obstruction may serve to lower urinary pressures and offers some protection to the developing kidneys. \"Posterior urethral valves are probably the most common underlying etiology\" - Campbell's Urology",

Both of these tumors are also seen in certain types of gonadal dysgen\u00adesis where there is female pseudohermaphroditism, that is, genotypic females with male appearing external genitalia. Gonadoblastomas, unlike dysgerminomas, frequently contain foci of calcification that are visible on abdominal films, as in this patient. Other primary ovarian tumors that frequently produce visible calcifi\u00adcations on abdominal films are cystic teratomas (bone and teeth) and fibromas. Dysgerminomas of the ovary are the female counter\u00adpart of seminomas of the testicle and pinealomas in the central nervous system.

The etiological agent is Rhinosporidium seeberi. Rhinosporidium seeberi is an aquatic protozoan (not a fungus). Infection usually results from a local traumatic inoculation with the organism. It is seen in India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. In India, most of the cases are seen in Southern states. Infection of the nose and nasopharynx is observed in 70% of persons with rhinosporidiosis; infection of the palpebral conjunctiva or associated structures (including lacrimal apparatus) is observed in 15% of cases. Other structures of the mouth and upper airway may be sites of disease. Disease of the skin, ear, genitals, and rectum has also been described. Rhinosporidiosis is an infection that typically limited to the mucosal epithelium. The disease progress with local replication of R seeberi and associated hyperplastic growth of host tissue and a localized immune response. Clinical features of Rhinosporidiosiso Rhinosporidiosis presents as soft leafy polypoidal mass (soft polyp), which is pink to purple in colour studded with white dots, i. e. strawberry appearance. This appearance results from sporangia, which is visible as grey or yellow spots in the vascular polypoid masses. Because the polyps are vascular and friable, they bleed easily upon manipulation. Treatmento The treatment of choice is surgical excision. Complete excision of mass is done with diathermy knife and cauterization of the base. Dapsone is being tried for treating rhinosporidiosis but with limited success.",

A table of G proteins and their functions appears below. The muscarinic cholinergic and \u03b2 receptors, as well as rhodopsin, are multipass transmembrane proteins consisting specifically of seven hydrophobic spanning segments of the single polypeptide chain. The peptide bonds of the spanning segments are polar. In the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer, in the absence of water, they form hydrogen bonds with each other. In the vast majority of cases this leads to the formation of ex helices. In the case of the porins, found in the outer mitochondrial membrane, a 0-barrel structure is established. There is a remarkable homology between the cell-surface receptors linked to the G proteins. Between the segments, the polypeptide chain loops on both the extracellular and the intracellular sides of the membrane. Ligand binding occurs on the extracellular surface. Receptors with intrinsic enzyme activity belong to a separate class of singlepass transmembrane proteins.

There is a discharge of motor neuron. The release of Ach at the neuromuscular junction. Binding of Ach to nicotinic (NM) cholinergic receptors at end plate. Binding of Ach to nicotinic receptors causes opening of Na+ channels (NM receptor has intrinsic ion channel). Opening of Na+ channel generate end plate potential on skeletal muscle membrane. If endplate potential is above a threshold level, an action potential is generated on skeletal muscle membrane- depolarization. Depolarization of skeletal muscle membrane causes the intracellular release of Ca+2 from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca+2 binds to troponin 'c', uncovering myosin binding site of actin. Cross-linking between actin and myosin, and sliding of thin filaments on thick filaments -contraction. Relaxation1. Ca+2 pumped back into sarcoplasmic reticulum. 2 Release of Ca+2 from Troponin. 3 Cessation of interaction between actin and myosin - relaxation, o Now coming back to the mechanism of different skeletal muscle relaxants. 1 Competitive (nondepolarising) blockerso The competitive blockers have affinity for Nm receptors but no intrinsic activity, o They compete with Ach for Nm receptor - called competitive blockers. o They prevent binding of Ach to Nm receptors - No opening of Na+ channels - No depolarization, so these are called non-depolarizing blockers. o Competitive blockers reduce the frequency of channel opening but not its duration or the conductance of a channel once it has opened. o When the magnitude of end plate potential falls below a critical level, it is unable to trigger propagated muscle action potential - muscle fails to contract, o Neostigmine (anticholinesterases) antagonises competitive blockers. 2 Depolarizing blockerso Depolarizing blockers have affinity as well as submaximal intrinsic activity on NM receptors. o They depolarize muscle end plates by opening of Na+ channels and initially produce twitching and fasciculations (not full contraction as these drugs have submaximal activity) - o, they are called depolarizing blocker, o These drugs do not dissociate rapidly from the receptor (NM) - Persistent partial depolarization - Na+ channels get inactivated - flaccid paralysis, o Neostigmine does not antagonise depolarising blockers. o Under certain conditions depolarizing agents produce dual mechanism of neuromuscular blockade which can be divided into two phases: Phase I block. Rapid in onset. The result from persistent depolarization of muscle end plate. Has classical features of depolarization block. Block is not antagonized by anticholinesterases (neostigmine). Phase II block. Slow in onset. Results from desensitization of receptor to ACh. Resembles block produced by competitive blockers.

About 1-1. 5 cm of the segment of the loop distal to the ligature is excised. The tube is so excited as to leave behind about 1. 5 cm of the intact tube adjacent to the uterus.# The segment of the loop removed is to be inspected to be sure that the wall has not been partially resected and to send it for histology. b) Uchida technique - A saline solution is injected subserosally in the mid-portion of the tube to create a bleb. The serous coat is incised along the antimesenteric border to expose the muscular tube. The tube is ligated with No. 0 chromic catgut on either side and about 3-5 cm of the tube is resected off. The ligated proximal stump is allowed to retract beneath the serious coat. The serous coat is closed with a fine suture in such a way that the proximal stump is buried but the distal stump is open to the peritoneal cavity. No failure in this method has been observed so far. c) Irving method - The tube is ligated on either side and mid portion of the tube (between the ties) is excised. The free medial end of the tube is then turned back and buried into the posterior uterine wall creating a myometrial tunneld) Madlener technique - It is the easiest method. The loop of the tube is crushed with an artery forceps. The crushed area is tied with black silk. The loop is not excised.

        "exp": "Ans- A Hand Infections Arrangement of fascia and fascial septa in the hand is such that many spaces are formed. These spaces are of surgical important because they may become infected and distended with pus. Spaces are as follows: Palmar spaces - Pulp space of the fingers - Midpalmar space - Thenar space Dorsal spaces - Dorsal subcutaneous space - Dorsal subaponeurotic space The forearm space of Parona Pulp Space of Finger Fig: The digital pulp space. Tips of finger and thumb contain subcutaneous fat arranged and tight compartments formed by fibrous septa which pass from skin to the periosteum of the terminal phalanx. Infection of Pulp Spaces Infection of pulp spaces also known as FELON or WHITLOW. Caused by penetrating injury from a foreign body or from fingersticks: for medical reasons (e. g. hematocrit and blood sugar determination). Staph aureus is the commonest organism to cause this infection. Swelling redness, pain, typical of cellulitis initially are presented. The pulp abscess (felon) can extend into the periosteum, around the nail bed, or proximally through the periosteum, around the nail bed, or proximally through the fibrous curtain or through the skin to the exterior over the pulp. Treatment: Incision and Drainage Web Space Infection (Collar Button Abscess) Web space infection localizes in one of the three fat filled interdigital spaces just proximal to the superficial transverse ligament at the level of metacarpophalangeal joints. Infection begins beneath palmar calluses in labourers. It may begin near the palmer surface but because skin and fascia here are less yielding it may localize to drain dorsally. Mid Palmer and Thenar Space Infection Fig: Fascial Spaces of Hand i. Mid palmer abscess can cause severe systemic reaction local pain and tenderness inability to move long and ring fingers because of pain and generalized swelling of hand and fingers which resemble and INFLATED GLOVE. i. Thenar abscess causes similar symptoms but thumb web is more swollen. The index finger is held flexed and active motion of both the index finger and thumb is impaired because of pain. Space of Parona This space is border by pronator quadratus dorsally, flexor pollicis longus laterally, flexor carpi ulnaris medially and flexor tendons on palmar aspect. Abscess of these spaces usually result from spread of infection from other parts of hand typically from purulent flexor tenosynovial infections.",

In this question, the female patient is 30 years old. i. e. very young so we should not choose hysterectomy or endometrial ablation as the management of choice because in future she might desire pregnancy. The patient is hypertensive, hence OCPs are contraindicated, so our answer by exclusion is Mirena, which is logically also correct, as this patient has 2 children so she might not desire pregnancy presently f Mirena controls bleeding and have contraceptive benefit). Heavy menstrual bleeding that doesn't respond to oral medication may be managed by endometrial ablation using coagulation, resection or vaporization provided that patient is willing to forgo future fertility. Alternatively, future fertility is desired, a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device can provide a virtually equal clinical outcome. Novaks 15/ep788. Levonorgestrel Intrauterine System (MIRENA)* It is a T-shaped intrauterine device which releases levonorgestrel at the rate of 20 meg daily.* This low hormone minimizes the systemic progestin side effects and more patients will continue this therapy than cyclic progesterone.* It exerts its clinical effect by preventing endometrial proliferation and consequently reduces both the duration of bleeding and the amount of menstrual loss.* The levonorgestrel-releasing system is also advocated as an alternative to surgery in dysfunctional uterine bleeding. \" The LNG /US can be used in all women as the first line of treatment of menorrhagia in place of oral medications.

Read below taking into consideration that this patient has rapid onset hirsutism. Let us see what Harrison has to say about rapid onset hirsutism \" Sudden development and rapid onset of hirsutism suggest the possibility of an androgen-secreting neoplasm. \"So this patient is not suffering from PCOD. Androgen can be secreted by both the ovaries and adrenal neoplasm. The principal circulating steroids involved in the etiology of hirsutism are -Androstenedione. Dehydroepiandrosterone. DHEAS and. Testosterone. Now the confusion is which is the most important one. Most of the students believe that it is dehydroepiandrosterone, But in Harrison, it is clearly given that Testosterone is the most important androgen mediating Hirsutism. Read the following lines from Harrison and you will agree with me \"Although it is the most important circulating androgen, testosterone is in effect the penultimate androgen in mediating hirsutism. \"It is the penultimate androgen because testosterone is first converted to more potent dihydrotestosterone, which then acts on androgen receptors. Go through Fig. 53. 2 on page 300 of Harrison 15th/e. It will help you to understand this question in a better way.",

It' superficial it may point close to the nail and can easily be drained by incision with a size 1 1 scalpel. Deeper lesions are best treated by antibiotics initially, but if they do not improve within 2 days, incision under local anesthesia is required, particularly in childhood. The incision is made laterally in the proximal nail fold. Some authorities recommend removing the proximal one-third of the nail plate without initial incisional drainage. This gives more rapid relief and more sustained drainage. Chronic paronychia. It is an inflammatory dermatosis of the nail folds due to an irritant associated with wet work or caustic materials. Secondary infection, especially with Candida or Pseudomonas may play a role in the pathogenesis. The chronic, non-infective, inflammatory component is treated with topical steroids in addition to antimicrobials. Acute exacerbations occur from time to time and are due to secondary bacterial infection. Skin diseases that may present as chronic paronychia: Psoriasis. Atopic dermatitis. Pemphigus.

Bailey and Love 24th ed., 1274)INGUINAL CANAL# In adults the inguinal canal, which is 3. 75 cm long, is directed downwards and medially from the deep to the superficial inguinal ring.# Superficial Inguinal Ring- The superficial inguinal ring is a triangular aperture in the aponeurosis of the external oblique and lies 1. 25 cm above the pubic tubercle.- The ring is bounded by a superomedial and inferolateral crus joined by crisscross intercrural fibres.# Deep Inguinal Ring- The deep inguinal ring is a U-shaped condensation of the transversalis fascia and it lies 1. 25 cm above the inguinal (Poupart's) ligament, midway between the symphysis pubis and the ASIS.- The transversalis fascia is the fascial envelope of the abdomen and the competency of the deep inguinal ring depends on the integrity of this fascia.- The inferior epigastric vessels lie posteriorly and medially to the deep inguinal ring.# BOUNDARIES OF THE CANALAnterior. Posterior. External oblique aponeurosis with the conjoined muscle laterally. Fascia transversalis and the conjoined tendon (internal oblique and transversus abdominus medially). Superior. Inferior. Conjoined muscles (internal oblique and transversus).

Ts:-Transversalis fascia: -conjoint Tendon# Contents of the canal:- In the male the inguinal canal transmits the spermatic cord, the ilio-inguinal nerve and the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve.- In the female the round ligament replaces the spermatic cord. Indirect Hernia. Direct Hernia. Travels down the canal on the outer (lateral and anterior) side of the spermatic cord. Comes out directly forwards through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. Neck of the indirect hernia is lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels. Direct hernia usually emerges medial to inferior epigastric vessels except in the saddle-bag or pantaloon type, which has both a lateral and a medial component.# An inguinal hernia can be differentiated from a femoral hernia by ascertaining the relation of the neck of the sac to the medial end of the inguinal ligament and the pubic tubercle, i. e., in the case of an inguinal hernia the neck is above and medial, while that of a femoral hernia is below and lateral.# Digital control of the internal ring may help in distinguishing between an indirect and a direct inguinal hernia.",

        "exp": "Any postmenopausal woman who has been on unop\u00adposed estrogen and who is now experiencing vaginal bleeding is suspect for either endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia is the end result of pro\u00adlonged estrogenic stimulation of the endometrial mu\u00adcosa. Morphologic forms of hyperplasia include cystic, adenomatous, and atypical hyperplasia. In cystic hy\u00adperplasia (simple hyperplasia), there are large, dilated glands lined by actively mitosing epithelial cells. Ade\u00adnomatous hyperplasia refers to branching of the glands with papillary infolding or outpouchings (sometimes referred to as complex hyperplasia). Atypical hyperpla\u00adsia has more glandular crowding and nuclear atypia than the latter condition and has the highest risk for progressing into carcinoma in situ and endometrial carcinoma. Endometrial carcinoma is the most common inva\u00adsive cancer of the female genital tract. As with endome\u00adtrial hyperplasia, the risk factors for endometrial cancer primarily relate to hyperestrinism and include obesity, nulliparity, diabetes, hypertension, infertility, breast cancer, low fiber/high fat diet, early menarche or late menopause, and tamoxifen. The most common clini\u00adcal presentation is vaginal bleeding (90%) in a post\u00admenopausal woman.",

        "question": "Non-sense mutation is seen in?",
        "exp": "Ans is 'b' i. e. Thalasemia Mutations Point mutation (Base substitution mutation) Substitution of a single base by another is known as point mutation. If a purine is replaced by another purine base or if a pyrimidine base is replaced by another pyrimidine base, it is known as transition. Substitution of a purine base by a pyrimidine base or vice versa is known as transversion. A point mutation will affect only one codon. Point mutation can be of following types:- Silent mutation If the substitution occurs in the third base of a codon, the code word may remain unchanged due to degeneracy of the genetic code. For example, GGC to GGG mutation has no effect as both code for glycine thus, codon containing the changed base codes for the same amino acid (PG1-l. J9), therefore there is no change in amino acid sequence of the protein. The gene is expressed in term of same protein, i. e. there is no change in expression of protein. Mis-sense mutations If the base substitution changes the code words, i. e. codon containing the changed base codes for different amino acid, it is called mis-sense mutation. The sequence of amino acids in the protein changes. The effect of amino acid substitution is variable:- Acceptable missense mutation:- The substitution of amino acid has minimal or no effect because either the substituted amino acid is similar to that of original amino acid or the substitution occurs in non critical area. For example, normally hemoglobin (HbA) has valine at position 67 of b-chain in place of valine. This is non-ritical position, i. e. substitution of different amino-acid 'at this position produces normally functional hemoglobin. For example, 'hemoglobin Milwaukee' has glutamic acid at this position (in place of valine), 'hemoglobin bristol' has aspartic acid and 'hemoglobin Sydney' has alanine (in place of valine). Partially acceptable missense mutation:- Substitution of one amino acid with other is partially acceptable, i. e. the resultant protein functions normally under certain conditions but not always. For example, substitution of glutamate by valine at position six of b-chain produces HbS. HbS is able to function normally at high oxygen tension but gets precipitated at low oxygen tension. Unacceptable mis-sense mutation:- Substitution of one amino acid with other produces non-functional protein. For example, in methemoglobin (HbM) histidine is replacement by tyrosine at position 58 of (X- chain. HbM is incapable of combining with oxygen. Nonsense Mutation. Base substitution changes a sense codon into a nonsense (stop or termination) codon. In such cases, protein synthesis will be terminated prematurely and the resulting protein will be usually non-functional. Frame-shift mutation Frameshift mutations occur due to insertion or deletion of one or two bases which causes change in the reading frame distal to the mutation. If 1 or 2 base pair change, whole reading frame is changed distal to the mutation, resulting into entirely different protein molecule. If 3 base pairs change, single amino acid is incorporated or deleted. The rest of amino acid sequence is same. Trinucleotide repeat mutation In this type of mutation a codon (i. e. trinucleotide sequence) undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain. Diseases associated with trinucleotide repeat mutation are Huntington's disease (CAG repeat), Spinocerebellar ataxia (CAG repeat), Friedreich ataxia (GAA repeat), fragile-X-syndrome (GGG or GCC repeat), dystrophia myotonica (CTG/CUG repeat), X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy (CAG repeat) and dentorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (CAG repeat).

The neocortex is the nonlimbic portion of the cerebral hemisphere. Now let us discuss the connections of various thalamic nuclei in the question. Anterior thalamic nuclei -Anterior thalamic nuclei receive afferents from the mamillary bodies and give fibers to cingulate gyrus. Cingulate gyrus is included in the limbic cortex. So it means that anterior thalamic nuclei do not project to the neocortex. Intralaminar nuclei-Efferents from intralaminar nuclei are diffuse and reach various parts of the cortex. It includes both limbic and nonlimbic areas. Pulvinar nuclei -Efferents from pulvinar nuclei project to all parts of cortex which include both limbic and nonlimbic areas. Reticular nuclei. About Reticular nuclei of Snell's neuroanatomy states \"Every thalamic nucleus except the reticular nuclei sends axons to different parts of the cortex. The output of Reticular nuclei is mainly to other thalamic nuclei\"In every other neuroanatomy book, I looked into states the same fact that Reticular nuclei do not send any efferent to the cerebral cortex. So in this question, two options seem correct. One is Ant Thalamic nuclei because, though it sends fibers to other parts of cortex it does not send any fibers to the neocortex. The other correct option is reticular nuclei, it does not have any efferent to the cerebral cortexI have gone for Reticular nucleus because following text from Gray's gives some evidence of efferents from Anterior thalamic nuclei projecting to the neocortex. Gray's states about Ant. Thalamic nuclei \"In addition, there appears to be a minor connection between Ant Thalamic nuclei and the dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior areas of neocortex\" Gray's 38th/Ep 1086.",

It is based on the principle that brain can safely tolerate circulatory arrest for periods of up to 45minutes if the temperature is carefully lowered to 15-17degC wide surgery. So during surgery for aortic arch aneurysm temperature is lowered till the temperature of the body is lowered up to 15-17 degc and then surgery is performed. During this process, we need an anesthetic agent which lowers the metabolic demands of the brain, so that the brain can sustain longer periods of circulatory arrest.

The term immune privilege refers to the phenomenon where tissue allografts transplanted to certain anatomical sites appear exempt from the rules that normally govern graft rejection. Immune responses and associated inflammation in certain parts of the body, including the brain, eye, testes, placenta, and fetus, carry a high risk of lethal organ dysfunction or reproductive failure. These tissues, which have evolved to be protected, to a variable degree, from immune responses, are called immune privileged sites. The Nobel laureate immunologist Sir Peter Medawar coined the term immune privilege in the 1940s to describe the lack of immune responses to tissue transplanted into the brain or the anterior chamber of the eye of experimental animals. Foreign antigens that would evoke an immune response in most tissues are often tolerated in these immune privileged sites. The mechanisms underlying immune privilege vary between these tissues and are not fully understood. Some of the mechanisms are similar to mechanisms of regulation in gut and skin.",

Ducts of pilosebaceous glands have their opening into hair follicles and hair follicles open on skin surface by their hair follicle opening. Therefore blockage of hair follicle opening results in blockage of the pilosebaceous gland. This is the main pathogenic factor in acne vulgaris, o Three basic defects lead to the development of acne vulgaris: -i) Increased sebum secretionii) Follicular plug at hair follicle opening. iii) Bacterial infection.

Orotracheal intubation is the preferred technique in most cases. It is most suited to an emergency situation (nasotracheal intubation requires a little extra time. Orotracheal intubation under direct larynx goscopy is generally the easier route and the one of choice in unstable patients when rapid re-establishment of the airway is essential. Nasotracheal intubation is better tolerated during prolonged mechanical ventilation. Nasotracheal intubation has certain drawbacks. Increased risk of nosocomial sinusitis. Increased risk of mucosal damage and bleeding, therefore, nasotracheal intubation should be avoided in coagulopathies. Restricted movement of the endotracheal tube.
