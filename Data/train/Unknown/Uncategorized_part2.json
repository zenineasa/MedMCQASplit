        "exp": "Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) reduces angiotensin II formation. As a result, those pathways that are stimulated by angiotensin II are also reduced. The most important change is a reduction in the release of aldosterone. To a lesser extent, angiotensin II also causes vasoconstriction and release of transmitter from sympathetic nerves, and these direct excitatory effects are also reduced. Finally, angiotensin II has some direct excitatory effect on antidiuretic hormone (AD H) release. Lowering angiotensin II may therefore slightly reduce ADH levels by this direct mechanism. These effects tend to reduce blood pressure and volume. This reduction is sensed by pressure and volume sensors throughout the body, leading to enhanced renin release. The effect of ACE inhibitors on ADH levels is complicated. On one hand, angiotensin II has a small direct stimulatory effect on ADH release, so blockade of angiotensin II synthesis tends to limit ADH release. Furthermore, to the extent that more salt than water is lost, plasma osmolaliry decreases, leading to a de- crease in ADH levels. On the other hand, any reduction in extracellular fluid volume tends to enhance ADH levels. In summary, only minor changes in ADH levels are expected whereas a significant rise in plasma renin levels occurs.",

The entry and progression of cells through the cell cycle are controlled by changes in levels and activities of cyclins. So the levels of several of the cyclins peak during specific phases of the cell cycle, they are rapidly degraded as the cell enters the next phase of the cell cycle. Cyclins perform their function by forming a complex with a group of constitute expressed proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Different combination of cyclins and CDKs are associated with each of the important transitions in the cell cycle. As the cell moves into any phase the cyclin specific for that phase is synthesized and then it binds to its constitutive CDK, creating the cyclin/CDK complex, whose activity is necessary for cells to enter the next phase. This complex when activated participates in the reactions and after the reactions are over these cyclins are degraded. Examples of cyclin/CDK complexes controlling the cell cycle cyclins B/CDK1.

It can be an important cutaneous marker of benign and malignant conditions and, accordingly, is divided into two types. The benign type, which constitutes about 80% of all cases, develops gradually and usually occurs in childhood or during puberty. It may occur (1) as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance, (2) in association with obesity or endocrine abnormalities (particularly with pituitary or pineal tumors and diabetes), and (3) as part of several rare congenital syndromes. As with seborrheic keratoses, acanthosis nigricans sometimes occurs as a paraneoplastic process resulting from the production of growth factors by a variety of tumors. The malignant type refers to lesions arising in middle-aged and older individuals in association with underlying cancers, most commonly gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. The epidermis and underlying enlarged dermal papillae undulate sharply to form numerous repeating peaks and valleys. Variable hyperplasia may be seen, along with hyperkeratosis and slight basal cell layer hyperpigmentation (but no melanocytic hyperplasia). The familial form is associated with germline activating mutations in FGFR3; depending on the mutation, acanthosis may be an isolated finding or be seen together with skeletal deformities, including achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia.",

        "question": "All of the following are contents of the middle mediastinum except -",
        "exp": "Ans- C Arch of the aorta Ref- The mediastinum is the central compartment of the thoracic cavity, located between the two pleural sacs. It contains most of the thoracic organs and acts as a conduit for structures traversing the thorax on their way into the abdomen. Anatomically, the mediastinum is divided into two parts by an imaginary line that runs from the sternal angle (the angle formed by the junction of the sternal body and manubrium) to the T4 vertebrae: Superior mediastinum - extends upwards, terminating at the superior thoracic aperture. Inferior mediastinum - extends downwards, terminating at the diaphragm. It is further subdivided into the anterior mediastinum, middle mediastinum, and posterior mediastinum. In this article, we shall look at the anatomy of the middle mediastinum - its borders, contents and clinical correlations. Borders The middle mediastinum is bordered by the following thoracic structures: Anterior: Anterior margin of the pericardium. Posterior: Posterior border of the pericardium. Laterally: Mediastinal pleura of the lungs. Superiorly: an Imaginary line extending between the sternal angle (the angle formed by the junction of the sternal body and manubrium) and the T4 vertebrae. Inferiorly: the Superior surface of the diaphragm. By Teach. Me. Series Ltd (2018) Fig 1. 0 - The mediastina of the thorax. Contents The middle mediastinum is the largest subdivision of the inferior mediastinum. It contains several important organs, vessels, nerves and lymphatic structures. Organs The middle mediastinum contains the heart, and its protective sheath, the pericardium. It also contains the tracheal bifurcation and the left and right main bronchi. Vessels The middle mediastinum is associated with the origins of the great vessels that run to and from the heart: Ascending aorta - the first part of the aorta, which arises from the aortic orifice. It moves upwards, exiting the fibrous pericardium and entering the superior mediastinum - where it then becomes the aortic arch. The ascending aorta gives rise to two branches; the left and right coronary arteries. Pulmonary trunk - gives rise to the left and right pulmonary arteries. The trunk itself is relatively short and wide, allowing a large volume of blood to pass through it. Superior vena cava - returns deoxygenated blood from the upper half of the body. It is formed by the right and left brachiocephalic veins. By Teach. Me. Series Ltd (2018) Fig 1. 1 - The great vessels of the middle mediastinum. Note how only the origins of the vessels are contained within the middle mediastinum. Nerves The cardiac plexus and the phrenic nerves are both located within the middle mediastinum. Cardiac plexus - a network of nerves located at the base of the heart, containing sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers. The sympathetic nerves are derived from the T1-T4 segments of the spinal cord, and the parasympathetic innervation is supplied by the vagus nerve. The plexus can be subdivided into superficial and deep components. Phrenic nerves (left and right) - mixed nerves that provides motor innervation to the diaphragm. They arise in the neck, and descend through the middle mediastinum to reach the diaphragm. By Teach. Me. Series Ltd (2018) Fig 1. 2 - The anatomical course of the phrenic nerves, which passes through the middle mediastinum to innervate the diaphragm. Lymphatics The tracheobronchial lymph nodes are located within the middle mediastinum. They are a group of nodes associated with the trachea and bronchi of the respiratory tract - and are characteristically enlarged in certain lung pathologies. They form from the gathering of bronchial nodes within the hila of the lungs. Individual groups of nodes are connected via fine lymphatic channels.",

The pain is exacerbated when the buttocks are compressed by sitting on a toilet seat or chair for long periods. No lumbar pain is noted. Pain is elicited when the physician performs Freiberg's maneuver. Most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "This is piriformis syndrome. As you may recall from your anatomy, the piriformis is the small muscle that crosses the greater sciatic foramen, cutting it into two spaces as the muscle passes from the edge of the sacrum to the greater trochanter. The sciatic nerve comes out of the greater sciatic foramen below the piriformis, and is liable to compression by the muscle. Symptoms are as described above; bicycle riding and running may also set off the symptoms, which may take the form of chronic nagging ache, pain, tingling, or numbness. Treatment is usually to teach the patient to avoid maneuvers that set off the symptoms. Some patients have been helped by corticosteroid injection near the site where the piriformis muscle crosses the sciatic nerve; this therapy is thought to work by reducing the fat around the muscle and thereby increasing the available space in the area. Disk compression of the sciatic nerve can also produce sciatic pain, but there is almost always lumbar as well as buttock pain. Fibromyalgia causes achy pain, tenderness, and stiffness of involved sites, including muscles, tendon insertions, and nearby soft tissues. Sites commonly involved include head, neck, shoulders, thorax, low back, and thighs. Popliteus tendinitis is inflammation of the tendon of the popliteus muscle of the knee.

        "exp": "Ans- C Visual field determination Image - Retinitis Pigmentosa - Fundus Changes Ref- What is retinitis pigmentosa? Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of rare, genetic disorders that involve a breakdown and loss of cells in the retina--which is the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Common symptoms include difficulty seeing at night and a loss of side (peripheral) vision. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that contains photoreceptors and other cell types What causes RP? RP is an inherited disorder that results from harmful changes in any one of more than 50 genes. These genes carry the instructions for making proteins that are needed in cells within the retina, called photoreceptors. Some of the changes, or mutations, within genes are so severe that the gene cannot make the required protein, limiting the cellis function. Other mutations produce a protein that is toxic to the cell. Still, other mutations lead to an abnormal protein that doesnit function properly. In all three cases, the result is damage to the photoreceptors. What are photoreceptors? Photoreceptors are cells in the retina that begin the process of seeing. They absorb and convert light into electrical signals. These signals are sent to other cells in the retina and ultimately through the optic nerve to the brain where they are processed into the images we see. There are two general types of photoreceptors, called rods and cones. Rods are in the outer regions of the retina, and allow us to see in the dim and dark light. Cones reside mostly in the central portion of the retina and allow us to perceive fine visual detail and color. Image courtesy of Robert N. Fariss, Ph. D., chief of the NEI Biological Imaging Core, and Ann H. Milam, Ph. D., former professor in the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Washington. How does RP affect vision? In the early stages of RP, rods are more severely affected than cones. As the rods die, people experience night blindness and a progressive loss of the visual field, the area of space that is visible at a given instant without moving the eyes. The loss of rods eventually leads to a breakdown and loss of cones. In the late stages of RP, as cones die, people tend to lose more of the visual field, developing tunnel vision. They may have difficulty performing essential tasks of daily living such as reading, driving, walking without assistance, or recognizing faces and objects. How is RP inherited? To understand how RP is inherited, itis important to know a little more about genes and how they are passed from parent to child. Genes are bundled together on structures called chromosomes. Each cell in your body contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. One copy of each chromosome is passed by a parent at conception through egg and sperm cells. The X and Y chromosomes, known as sex chromosomes, determine whether a person is born female (XX) or male (XY). The 22 other paired chromosomes, called autosomes, contain the vast majority of genes that determine non-sex traits. RP can be inherited in one of three ways: Autosomal Recessive Inheritance In autosomal recessive inheritance, it takes two copies of the mutant gene to give rise to the disorder. An individual with a recessive gene mutation is known as a carrier. When two carriers have a child, there is a: 1 in 4 chance the child will have the disorder 1 in 2 chance the child will be a carrier 1 in 4 chance the child will neither have the disorder nor be a carrier Autosomal Dominant Inheritance In this inheritance pattern, it takes just one copy of the gene with a disorder-causing mutation to bring about the disorder. When a parent has a dominant gene mutation, there is a 1 in 2 chance that any children will inherit this mutation and the disorder. X-linked Inheritance In this form of inheritance, mothers carry the mutated gene on one of their X chromosomes and pass it to their sons. Because females have two X chromosomes, the effect of a mutation on one X chromosome is offset by the normal gene on the other X chromosome. If a mother is a carrier of an X-linked disorder there is a: 1 in 2 chance of having a son with the disorder 1 in 2 chance of having a daughter who is a carrier How common is RP? RP is considered a rare disorder. Although current statistics are not available, it is generally estimated that the disorder affects roughly 1 in 4, 000 people, both in the United States and worldwide. How does RP progress? A scene as it might be viewed by someone with normal vision and someone with advanced RP. The symptoms of RP typically appear in childhood. Children often have difficulty getting around in the dark. It can also take abnormally long periods of time to adjust to changes in lighting. As their visual field becomes restricted, patients often trip over things and appear clumsy. People with RP often find bright lights uncomfortable, a condition is known as photophobia. Because there are many gene mutations that cause the disorder, its progression can differ greatly from person to person. Some people retain central vision and a restricted visual field into their 50s, while others experience significant vision loss in early adulthood. Eventually, most individuals with RP will lose most of their sight. How is RP diagnosed? RP is diagnosed in part through an examination of the retina. An eye care professional will use an ophthalmoscope, a tool that allows for a wider, clear view of the retina. This typically reveals abnormal, dark pigment deposits that streak the retina. These pigment deposits are in part why the disorder was named retinitis pigmentosa. Other tests for RP include: Electroretinogram (ERG). An ERG measures the electrical activity of photoreceptor cells. This test uses gold foil or a contact lens with electrodes attached. A flash of light is sent to the retina and the electrodes measure rod and cone cell responses. People with RP have a decreased electrical activity, reflecting the declining function of photoreceptors. Visual field testing. To determine the extent of vision loss, a clinician will give a visual field test. The person watches as a dot of light moves around the half-circle (180 degrees) of space directly in front of the head and to either side. The patient pushes a button to indicate that he or she can see the light. This process results in a map of their visual field and their central vision. Genetic testing. In some cases, a clinician takes a DNA sample from the person to give a genetic diagnosis. In this way, a person can learn about the progression of their particular form of the disorder. Genetic testing is available for a limited number of patients with RP through NEIis National Ophthalmic Disorder Genotyping and Phenotyping Network (eye. GENE). Participants in this program agree to make their DNA sample and clinical information available to researchers in exchange for genetic testing. They also agree to join a patient registry for possible recruitment into clinical trials. To learn more about eye. GENE, visit Are there treatments for RP? Living with vision loss A number of services and devices are available to help people with vision loss carry out daily activities and maintain their independence. In addition to an eye care professional, itis important to have help from a team of experts, which may include occupational therapists, orientation and mobility specialists, certified low vision therapists, and others. NEI has more information on living with low vision. Children with RP may benefit from low vision aids that maximize existing vision. For example, there are special lenses that magnify central vision to expand the visual field and eliminate glare. Computer programs that read text are readily available. Closed circuit televisions with a camera can adjust the text to suit oneis vision. Portable lighting devices can adjust to a dark or dim environment. Mobility training can teach people to use a cane or a guide dog, and eye scanning techniques can help people to optimize the remaining vision. Once a child is diagnosed, he or she will be referred to a low vision specialist for a comprehensive evaluation. Parents may also want to meet with the childis school administrators and teachers to make sure that necessary accommodations are put in place. For parents of children with RP, one challenge is to determine when a child might need to learn to use a cane or a guide dog. Having regular eye examinations to measure the progress of the disorder will help parents make informed decisions regarding low vision services and rehabilitation. Targeted therapies for RP An NEI-sponsored clinical trial found that a daily dose of 15, 000 international units of vitamin A palmitate modestly slowed the progression of the disorder in adults. Because there are so many forms of RP, it is difficult to predict how any one patient will respond to this treatment. Talk to an eye care professional to determine if taking vitamin A is right for you or your child. An artificial vision device called the Argus II has also shown promise for restoring some vision to people with late-stage RP. The Argus II, developed by Second Sight with NEI support, is a prosthetic device that functions in place of lost photoreceptor cells. It consists of a light-sensitive electrode that is surgically implanted on the retina. A pair of glasses with a camera wirelessly transmits signals to the electrode that are then relayed to the brain. Although it does not restore normal vision, in clinical studies, the Argus II enabled people with RP to read large letters and navigate environments without the use of a cane or guide dog. In 2012, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted a humanitarian device exemption for use of the Argus II to treat late-stage RP. This means the device has not proven effective, but the FDA has determined that its probable benefits outweigh its risks to health. The Argus II is eligible for Medicare payment.",

This nonmineralized bone matrix becomes mineralized by addition of calcium hydroxyapatite and calcium-phosphorus. This process of mineralization requires the presence of osteocalcin and osteonectin protein. Bone is an actively metabolizing tissue with a continuous turnover of both osteoid and mineral.

There is compleit abscence of all apo B containing lipoprotiens in the plasma (apo B 48 and apo B 100) where as HDL and apo AI concentration are approximately 50% of the normal. o The underlying cause of the abetalipoproteinemia is mutations in the senes encoding the microsomal trislvceride transfer protein MTP (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein). The protein is essential for the formation and eventual secretion of apolipoprotien B contaninig lipoproteins both from intestinal chylomicrons and liver. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protien normally facilitates association of lipid with apo B in the endoplasmic reticulum. In the presence of defective MTP this association fails to take place, as a result, no apo B containing lipoproteins are formed which accounts for their abscence in circulation. Chylomicrons formation is necessary' for the absorption and initial transport of fat soluble vitamins. The malabsorption of fat and the fat soluble vitamins that is typical of this condition is a result. of failure of chylomicron formation. The neurological manifestation of abelalipoproteinemias result from the inability to absorb and transport vitamin E. Vitamin A deficiency may also contribute to the retinal degeneration. Neuropathic changes affect post colum and spinocerebellar tract. Symptoms o Typically patients present in infancy' with failure to thrive and chronic diarrhoea' due to malabsorption. o Acanthocvtes' are seen on peripheral blood smear and an atypical retinitis pigmentosa on fundoscopy. o Later clinical manifestations include night blindness and neurological disability' particularly ataxia due to vitamin A and vitamin E deficiency'. Clinical features: o Chronic diarrhoea due to fat malabsorption (steatorrhoea). o Abdominal distension, o Failure to thrive. Neurological manifestation: o Clumsiness (first neurological maifestaiion) o Progressive ataxia o Neuropathy o Vision impairment o Retinitis pigmentosa o Impaired visual acuity' and visual field defects o Dysarthria o Sensory' motor neuropathy o Reflexes diminished or absent o Truncal and limb ataxia o Proprioceptive sensory' loss Laboratory and test findings: o Triglycerides level and cholesterol level are low. o Lipoprotein electrophoresis will reveal the absence of beta lipoproteins. o Acanthocy'tes constitute 50-90% of circulating red cell population. o Sensory nerve conduction studies have shown absent nerve action (SNAP s) or SNAPs of reduced amplitudes. Conduction velocities are usually normal, o Vitamin E levels are undetectable or very low. o Some patients develop elevated transaminases due to hepatic steatosis. o Homozygotes may have an impaired cortisol response to ACTH.

Most common exogenous agents are bacterial products.* In the early stage of inflammation, the rate of flow of blood is increased due to vasodilatation. But subsequently, there is slowing or stasis of bloodstream. With stasis, changes in the normal axial flow of blood in the microcirculation take place. The normal axial flow consists of a central stream of cells widens and peripheral plasma zone becomes narrower because of the loss of plasma by exudation. This phenomenon is known as MARGINATION.

        "question": "The normal route of calcium excretion is -",
        "exp": "Ans- C Kidney, intestine Regulation of Calcium Excretion Overview The regulation of ECF calcium levels is complex and involves the interaction of multiple endocrine hormones acting on multiple organ systems (See: Calcium and Phosphate Endocrinology). The unique aspect of calcium is that bone represents a large store of the ion that can be mobilized to maintain ECF calcium levels. However, the bone calcium reservoir is not inexhaustible and over the long-term calcium intake must be balanced with calcium excretion. Regulated calcium excretion occurs both in the intestines and kidneys. Here we focus on renal calcium excretion which is largely regulated by its rate of tubular resorption. Calcium Transport Overview It should be noted that protein-bound calcium cannot be filtered through the glomerular barrier and thus is not subject to renal regulation (See: Calcium and Phosphate Physiologic Forms). Consequently, only the unbound ionic ECF calcium, representing 60% of the total, is subject to renal regulation. Calcium resorption occurs in multiple segments of the nephron via distinct resorptive mechanisms. Proximal Tubule and Thick Ascending Loop of Henle Roughly 67% of calcium is resorbed in the proximal tubule while 25% is resorbed in the thick ascending Henle. Calcium resorption in these early segments occurs largely via a paracellular route and is dependent on the large amounts of sodium resorption performed. When sodium resorption is inhibited, either by the action of diuretics or ECF volume expansion, calcium resorption also declines and its urinary loss increases. The driving force for calcium resorption in the proximal tubule is likely the fact that the ion becomes concentrated as large volumes of water are resorbed in this segment. This is also the case in the thick Henle but in addition the thick Henle carries a large positive luminal potential that adds to the driving force for paracellular calcium resorption. Early Distal Tubule The early distal tubule is responsible for resorbing the remaining 8% of filtered calcium; however, as discussed below this segment represents the most important locus for regulation of calcium excretion. Unlike the proximal tubule and thick Henle, resorption of calcium in the early distal tubule is independent of sodium. Here, luminal calcium resorption appears to occur through a calcium channel. The resorptive electrochemical gradient for calcium is generated by a basolateral calcium-ATPase. Regulation Renal calcium resorption is enhanced by all three calcium-modulating hormones, Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), Vitamin D, and Calcitonin; however, the most important hormone is PTH. As discussed in parathyroid hormone physiology, PTH levels are modulated by both blood calcium and phosphate levels. All things being equal, PTH levels rise when blood calcium levels fall whereas PTH levels fall when blood calcium levels rise. The capacity of PTH to enhance renal calcium resorption appears to be by stimulating the basolateral calcium-ATPase in the early distal tubule. Taken together then, the relationship between blood calcium levels, PTH, and renal sodium excretion represent a negative feedback control circuit that maintains relatively stable levels of ECF calcium concentration over the long term.",

Immunological response o Glucocorticoids suppress all type of hypersensitivity and allergic reactions. o They cause greater suppression of cell mediated immunity (delayed hypersensitivity and graft rejection) - basis of use in autoimmune diseases and organ transplantation, o Effect is due to suppression of recruitment of leukocytes at the site of contact with antigen and of inflammatory response to immunologic injury. o Antibody production and complement function is not impaired. Note - o Corticoids have some direct and some permissive actions. Direct - Corticoids themselves produce an effect. Permissive - Corticoids do not themselves produce an effect, their presence facilitates the action of other hormones.",

        "exp": "Meckel diverticulum, caused by persistence of the vitelline duct and, on the antimesenteric ileal border, 60 to 100 cm from the ileocecal valve in adults. It is the most common and the most clinically significant congenital anomaly of the small intestine. Two thirds of patients are younger than 2 years. The omphalomesenteric duct (omphaloenteric duct, vitelline duct or yolk stalk) normally connects the embryonic midgut to the yolk sac ventrally, providing nutrients to the midgut during embryonic development. The vitelline duct narrows progressively and disappears between the 5th and 8th weeks gestation. In Meckel's diverticulum, the proximal part of vitelline duct fails to regress and involute, which remains as a remnant of variable length and location. The solitary diverticulum lies on the antimesenteric border of the ileum (opposite to the mesenteric attachment) and extends into the umbilical cord of the embryo. The left and right vitelline arteries originate from the primitive dorsal aorta, and travel with the vitelline duct. The right becomes the superior mesenteric artery that supplies a terminal branch to the diverticulum, while the left involutes. Having its own blood supply, Meckel's diverticulum is susceptible to obstruction or infection. Meckel's diverticulum is located in the distal ileum, usually within 2-3 feet (60-100 cm) of the ileocecal valve. This blind segment or small pouch is about 3-6 cm long and may have a greater lumen diameter than that of the ileum. It runs antimesenterically and has its own blood supply. It is a remnant of the connection from the yolk sac to the small intestine present during embryonic development. It is a true diverticulum, consisting of all 3 layers of the bowel wall which are mucosa, submucosa and muscularis propria. As the vitelline duct is made up of pluripotent cell lining, Meckel's diverticulum may harbor abnormal tissues, containing embryonic remnants of other tissue types. Jejunal, duodenal mucosa or Brunner's tissue were each found in 2% of ectopic cases. Heterotopic rests of gastric mucosa and pancreatic tissue are seen in 60% and 6% of cases respectively. Heterotopic means the displacement of an organ from its normal anatomic location. Inflammation of this Meckel's diverticulum may mimic appendicitis. Therefore, during appendectomy, ileum should be checked for the presence of Meckel's diverticulum, if it is found to be present it should be removed along with appendix. A memory aid is the rule of 2s: 2% (of the population) 2 feet (proximal to the ileocecal valve) 2 inches (in length) 2 types of common ectopic tissue (gastric and pancreatic) 2 years is the most common age at clinical presentation 2: 1 male: female ratio However, the exact values for the above criteria range from 0. 2-5 (for example, prevalence is probably 0. 2-4%). It can also be present as an indirect hernia, typically on the right side, where it is known as a \"Hernia of Littre\". A case report of strangulated umbilical hernia with Meckel's diverticulum has also been published in the literature. Furthermore, it can be attached to the umbilical region by the vitelline ligament, with the possibility of vitelline cysts, or even a patent vitelline canal forming a vitelline fistula when the umbilical cord is cut. Torsions of intestine around the intestinal stalk may also occur, leading to obstruction, ischemia, and necrosis.",

Primary structure is the sequence of the amino acids in a polypeptide chain. Secondary structure is the folding of short (3- to 30-residue), contiguous segments of polypeptide into geometrically ordered units. Tertiary structure is the assembly of secondary structural units into larger functional units such as the mature polypeptide and its component domains. Quarternary structure is the number and types of polypeptide units of oligomeric proteins and their spatial arrangement. In some cases, the proteins are assembled from more than one polypeptide or protomer. Quarternary structure defines the polypeptide composition of a protein, and for an oligomeric protein, the spatial relationships between its subunits or protomers. Monomeric proteins consist of a single polypeptide chain, and are hence, devoid of a quarternary structure. Dimeric proteins consist of two polypeptide chains. Homodimers contain two copies of the same polypeptide chain, while in heterodimers, the polypeptides differ. Ref: Harper's \u2018Illustrated Biochemistry'; 27/e, pg 30, 34",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Flashlight pumped dye laser \"Nonblanching bosselated lesion on right side of the face suggests port wine stain\"Port wine stain (PWS), also called nevus flammeus, is a congenital, cutaneous vascular malformation involving post-capillary venules which produce a light pink to red to dark-red- violet discoloration of the human skin. PWS occurs in an estimated 3 children per 1, 000 live births, affecting males and females and all racial groups equally. There appears to be no hereditary predilection for PWS within families. There are no known risk factors or ways to prevent PWS. The most likely hypothesis for the development of PWS is the deficiency or absence of surrounding neurons regulating blood flow through the ecstatic post-capillary venules. As a result, the blood vessels are unable to constrict normally and remain permanently dilated. They are \"none, blanching\". PWS is a progressive vascular malformation of the skin -PWS remain throughout life; there is no involution. PWS are well demarcated and flat and grow proportionately in surface area with the child. In infants and young children, PWS are flat red macules. However, the lesions tendto darken progressively to purple and, by adult age, often become raised as a result of the development of vascular papules bosselated or nodules. These changes in color and contour are attributed to progressive ectasia of the abnormal dermal vascular plexus. If left untreated, PWS often become incompatible with normal life due to the development of vascular nodules on the skin surface which can often bleed spontaneously with incidental trauma. For all of the above reasons, it is essential to begin treatment of PWS as early as possible. The treatment of PWS early will prevent the development of a hypertrophic component of the lesson. \"The pulsed dye laser in conjunction with cryogen spray cooling (\"dynamic cooling device\" or \"PCD\") is now the treatment of choice for PWS\". The yellow light produced by the pulsed dye laser penetrates up to 2 mm into the skin and is preferentially absorbed by hemoglobin within the dilated PWS blood vessels. The heat absorbed within the vessel lumen causes blood vessel damage which is evidenced by intense purpura (\"bruised\" appearance of the skin). The purpura heals, later on, and the lesion is cured. Several treatment sessions spaced at 4-8 week intervals are required for maximum efficacy. The number of treatments required for maximum PWS fading can be variable and unpredictable. Treatment side effects are mainly limited to post-operative swelling and purpura, which generally resolves within 2 weeks. With the addition of cryogen spray cooling, the risks of scarring or changes in the normal skin pigmentation are minimal after pulsed dye laser therapy performed by an experienced physician. Multiple pulsed dye laser devices are now available for PWS treatment, each with its own unique wavelength and pulse duration. Changing the wavelength or pulse duration of the laser can result in substantial PWS fading not previously observed with single device therapy. Moreover, several devices are sometimes used during an extended treatment protocol in order to destroy vessels of different sizes.",

Urea cycleo Ammonia is ultimately disposed of by formation of urea by \"Kreb's Henseleit urea cycle\" in the liver. Urea cycle takes place both in mitochondria and cytosol. First two reactions of urea cycle occur in the mitochondria, and remaining reactions occurs in the cytosol. o Biosynthesis of urea occurs in five steps. Carbamoyl phosphate synthase-I (CPS-I), a mitochondrial enzyme, catalyzes the formation of carbamoyl phosphate by condensation of CO2. and ammonia. Two molecules of ATP are required for the reaction. CPS-I is the rate limiting enzyme of the urea cycle. It is an allosteric enzyme and allosterically activated by N-acetyl glutamate. Ornithine transcarbamoylase catalyzes the formation of citrulline from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine. Arginosuccinate synthase catalyzes the formation of arginosuccinate from citrulline and aspartate. This reaction requires l. ATP, but 2 high energy- phosphate bonds are consumed as ATP is converted to AMP + PPi. The amino group of aspartate provides one of the two nitrogen atoms that appear in ureaQ (The other one is provided by ammonia NH4Q). Arginosuccinate lyase (argininosuccinase) catalyses the cleavage of arginosuccinate into arginine and fumarate. Fumarate enters in TCA cycle. arginase catalyses the formation of urea from arginineQ by hydrolytic cleavage of arginine to yield urea and ornithine. Ornithine is thus regenerated and can enter mitochondria to initiate another round of the urea cycle. o The source of two nitrogen atoms of urea - one from ammoniaQ and one from amino group of aspartateQ. Source of carbon is CO2Q. Thus out of all amino acids involved in urea cycle aspartate is consumed, while there is no net loss or gain of ornithine, citrulline, arginosuccinate or arginine. There is production of fumarate as by-product. o 3 molecules of ATP are consumed (2 in first reaction and 1 in third reaction). However, 4 high energy phosphate bonds are utilized as 3rd ATP is converted to AMP+PPi.",

Certain diseases, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, caused by a papovavirus, specifically attack oligoden\u00addrocytes and produce demyelination. Oligodendrogli\u00adomas are malignant tumors that are derived from oligo\u00addendrocytes.

        "exp": "Diastolic dysfunction is an impairment in the filling of the left ventricle (\"stiff ventricle\") caused by decreased compliance at a normal left atrial pressure. Systolic heart failure, which is an impairment in contractility, has a better response to positive inotropic agents. Most patients have a combination of both systolic and dia\u00adstolic dysfunction. In diastolic heart failure, filling of the left ventricle is slow or incomplete (i. e., decreased compliance) un\u00adless left atrial pressures increase to maintain the ejec\u00adtion fraction at the expense of increasing pulmonary and systemic venous congestion. Clinical findings in\u00adclude dyspnea, which is the most common symptom, resulting from interstitial and pulmonary edema. Pathophysiologically, there is left atrial hypertension and pulmonary venous hypertension, leading to pul\u00admonary congestion. Therapy is aimed at slowing the heart rate, which promotes filling of the left ventricle at low pressures. \uf062-Adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers are effective. Patients with diastolic dysfunction have a better survival rate than those with systolic dysfunction, because the ejection fraction is normal to slightly decreased, albeit at the expense of increased left atrial pressures. Systolic dysfunction is an impairment in contractil\u00adity of the left ventricle, or a defect in the ability of myofibrils to shorten against a load. The left ventricle loses its ability to eject blood into the aorta, so the ejection fraction (i. e., stroke volume/left ventricular end-diastolic volume) is decreased (usually < 40%); the normal ejection fraction is 80/120, or 66%, with a range of 55% to 75%. The ejection fraction is mea\u00adsured by echo cardiography or radionuclide ventricu\u00adlography. Signs of isolated systolic dysfunction include fatigue, prerenal azotemia, cool skin, and mental obtundation. The left ventricular chamber eventually dilates and patients develop fatigue, dyspnea, and pe\u00adripheral edema, which are signs of right-sided heart failure. Examples of systolic dysfunction include post\u00ad myocardial infarction, ischemic injury (e. g., acute myocardial infarction), and congestive cardiomyopa\u00adthy.

Two different clinical types of malignant T-cell disorders were originally recognized: mycosis fungoides, a chronic proliferative process; and a more aggressive nodular eruptive variant, mycosis fungoides d'embl\u00e9e. Lesions of mycosis fungoides usually involve truncal areas and include scaly, red -brown patches; raised, scaling plaques that may even be confused with psoriasis; and fungating nodules. In some individuals, seeding of the blood by malignant T cells is accompanied by diffuse erythema and scaling of the entire body surface (erythroderma), a condition known as S\u00e9zary syndrome. The histologic hallmark of CTCL of the mycosis fungoides type is the presence of the S\u00e9zary-Lutzner cells. These are T-helper cells (CD4+) that characteristically form band-like aggregates within the superficial dermis ( Fig. 25-19B ) and invade the epidermis as single cells and small clusters (Pautrier microabscesses). These cells have markedly in folded nuclear membranes, imparting a hyperconvoluted or cerebriform contour. Although patches and plaques show pronounced epidermal infiltration by S\u00e9zary-Lutzner cells (epidermotropism), in more advanced nodular lesions the malignant T cells often lose this epidermotropic tendency, grow deeply into the dermis, and eventually spread systemically.",

On the 4th day of the ICU stay, he developed sudden tachypnoea, fall in Sp. O2 and hypotension. On 2D echo, there was a dilation of right ventricle and tricuspid regurgitation. What would be the next immediate step?",
        "exp": "Ans. D. Systemic thrombolysis (Ref: Harrison 19/e p1631-1637, 18/e p2170-2177; Sabiston 19/e p295-297; Schwartz 9/e p787-789: Bailey 26/e p917). Clinical picture mentioned in this question is highly suggestive of deep venous thrombosis leading to pulmonary embolism. As the patient has developed pulmonary embolism with hypotension and tachypnea, the immediate step would be Systemic thrombolysis. \"Anticoagulation is the foundation for successful treatment of DVT and PE. Immediately effective anticoagulation is initiated with a parenteral drug: unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux. One should use a direct thrombin inhibitors (argatroban, lepirudin, or bivalirudin) in patients with proven or suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Parenteral agents are continued as a transition or \"bridge \" to stable, long-term anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (exclusively warfarin in the United States). Warfarin requires 5-7 days to achieve a therapeutic effect. During that period, one should overlap the parenteral and oral agents. \"- Harrison 18/e p2173\"Successful fibrinolytic therapy rapidly reverses right heart failure and may result in a lower rate of death and recurrent PE by (1) dissolving much of the anatomically obstructing pulmonary arterial thrombus, (2) preventing the continued release of serotonin and other neurohumoral factors that exacerbate pulmonary hypertension, and (3) lysing much of the source of the thrombus in the pelvic or deep leg veins, thereby decreasing the likelihood of recurrent PE. The preferred fibrinolytic regimen is 100 mg of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t. PA) administered as a continuous peripheral intravenous infusion over 2 hours. Patients appear to respond to fibrinolysis for up to 14 days after the PE has occurred. Contraindications to fibrinolysis include intracranial disease, recent surgery, and trauma. The only FDA-approved indication for PE fibrinolysis is massive PE. \"- Harrison 18/e p2173. Pulmonary Embolism. Risk factors for pulmonary embolism are the risk factors for thrombi formation within venous circulation. Calf venous thrombosis: Low risk for embolism. Thrombosis of larger veins: High risk for embolism (due to loosely attached thrombus to venous wall)MC site for DVT: Calf veins. QMC source for pulmonary emboli: Proximal vein of lower extremityQ (femoro-popliteal and iliac vein). Pulmonary Embolism. Risk Factors for Pulmonary Thromboembolism* Age (increasing age)Q* Obesity Q* Immobility (bed rest >4days)Q* PregnancyQ and PuerperiumQ* High dose estrogen therapyQ* Surgery (trauma (especially of pelvis, hip or lower limb)Q* Malignancy (especially pelvis, abdominal, metastatic)* Heart failure/Recent MIQ* Nephrotic syndromeQ* Inflammatory bowel diseaseQ* PolycythemiaQ* PNHQ or Lupus anticoagulant* Behcet's syndromeQ* HomocystinuriaQ* Paralysis of lower limb* Varicose veins, Infection. Clinical features: Symptoms: Dyspnea chest pain, hemoptysis and cough. Signs: Tachypnea (MC)Q. fever, unilateral leg swelling, wheeze, pleural friction rub. Any patient with high likelihood of pulmonary embolism on clinical evaluation straightaway undergoes imaging tests, while a patient with low clinical likelihood should first undergo D-dimer test. Factors for Clinical Assessment of Pulmonary Embolism* Clinical signs and symptoms of DVTQ* An alternative diagnosis is less likely than pulmonary embolism* Heart rate >100/minQ* HemoptysisQ* Immobilization or previous surgery in 4 weeksQ* Previous DVT/PEQ* MalignancyQ (on treatment, treatment in past 6 months) ECG Changes in Pulmonary Embolism(Sinus tachycardia: MC and non-specific finding on ECGQ).

T3Q: Seen in < 12% patients- S wave in lead I- Q wave in lead III- Inverted T wave in lead III- S wave in lead I, II. and III (S1. S2. S3). Diagnosis: D-dimer: Excellent screening test for the diagnosis of PEQ. Best investigation in clinical suspicion of PE: Multidetector CTQ. Eung scanning is now a 2nd line diagnostic test for PE. Pulmonary angiography: Gold standard for diagnosis of PEQ (but expensive and cumbersome). Treatment: Anticoagulation is the foundation for successful treatment of DVT and PE.

        "question": "Which electrolyte abnormality occurs during TURP-",
        "exp": "Ans- B Hyponatremia Ref Introduction Trans Urethral Resection of Prostate (TURP) is the second most common surgical procedure (after cataract extraction) done in men over the age of 65 years. Advancement in technology has enabled the urologists to reach all corners of the urinary system using endoscopes, causing minimum trauma to the patient. Endoscopic procedures in the urinary system require the use of irrigating fluids to gently dilate the mucosal spaces, remove blood, cut tissue and debris from the operating field and enable better vision. In spite of the best of efforts to understand and prevent the various complications of endoscopic procedures, incidence of some of the inherent complications have remained the same and still daunt the urologists. Aberrations in the Central Nervous System (CNS), Cardio Vascular System (CVS) and other systems which manifest due to the absorption of irrigating fluids during TURP are together known as TURP Syndrome. Though it is called TURP Syndrome, this complication can occur during other endoscopic procedures also namely Uretero-Renoscopy (URS), Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL), Trans Cervical Resection of Endometrium (TCRE), etc. Despite improvements in the current surgical and anesthetic management, 2. 5 - 20% of patients undergoing TURP show one or more manifestations of TURP syndrome and 0. 5% - 5% die perioperatively. Signs and Symptoms TURP syndrome may occur at any time perioperatively and has been observed as early as few minutes after surgery has started and as late as several hours after surgery has been completed. When under regional anesthesia, the patient characteristically complains of Dizziness Headache Nausea Tight feeling in the chest and throat Shortness of breath Restlessness Confusion Retching Abdominal pain Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures rise and the heart rate decreases. If not treated promptly, the patient may become cyanotic and hypotensive and go in for cardiac arrest. Some patients present with neurological symptoms. Initially they become lethargic and then unconscious. Their pupils dilate and react sluggishly to light. This may be followed by short episodes of tonic-clonic seizures leading to a state of coma. Under General Anesthesia (GA), the diagnosis of TURP Syndrome is difficult and often delayed. The usual signs are unexplained rise and then a fall in BP and refractory bradycardia. ECG changes such as nodal rhythm, ST changes, U waves and widening of QRS complexes may be observed. Recovery from GA and muscle relaxants may be delayed. Irrigation Solutions Irrigating fluids are used during endourological procedures for better vision. Ideally the irrigation solution should be isotonic, non hemolytic, electrically inert (so that diathermy can be used), non toxic, transparent, easy to sterilize and inexpensive. Unfortunately, a solution having all these qualities is not yet available. Electrolyte solutions such as normal saline or Ringer Lactate do least harm when absorbed into the circulation. However they cause dispersion of high frequency current from the resectoscope and hence abandoned. A variety of other irrigating fluids have been in use, each having its own merits and demerits. Sterile water: Though sterile water has many qualities of an ideal irrigating fluid, the disadvantage is its extreme hypotonicity, causing hemolysis, dilutional hyponatremia, shock and renal failure. Glycine 1. 2%, 1. 5%. 2. 2%: Glycine, an endogenous amino acid has been suggested as a suitable irrigating fluid considering its many advantages, including the low cost, though not as cheap as sterile water. Glycine is isotonic with plasma only at a concentration of 2. 2%, but the side effects of glycine at this concentration are more. The osmolality of 1. 5% glycine is 230 mosm/1 compared to serum osmolality of 290 mosm/l and hence cardiovascular and renal toxicities can occur at this concentration also. Further lowering of the concentration of glycine can lead to more complications due to hypotonicity and hence cannot be used for irrigation purposes. The distinct advantage of 1. 5% glycine over sterile water is its tendency to cause less hemolysis and renal failure. Mannitol 3%: Mannitol, though does not have the toxicities of glycine, drives water out of cells and may enhance circulatory overloading. The cost of mannitol is also higher compared to glycine. The elimination of mannitol through kidney will be decreased in patients with impaired renal function. Glucose 2. 5% - 4%: This is not a widely used irrigating fluid since glucose produces tissue charring at the site of resection and associated hyperglycemia produced when glucose is absorbed into the circulation. It also causes stickiness of surgeons' gloves and instruments. Cytal: Cytal, a mixture of sorbitol 2. 7% and mannitol 0. 54% widely used in USA as an irrigating fluid, has not gained popularity in India due to its high cost and nonavailability. In the body, sorbitol is metabolised to fructose, which may present problems in a patient with hypersensitivity to fructose. Urea 1%: This produces urea crystallisation on the instruments during resection and hence not preferred. 1. 5% glycine and sterile water are the most widely used irrigating fluids in urological endoscopic surgeries. Pathophysiology 1. Circulatory Overload The uptake of small amounts of irrigating fluids has been shown to occur during almost every TURP and TCRE, through the venous network of prostatic bed and endometrium respectively. Spontaneous leakage through Fallopian tube More Detailss increases fluid absorption during TCRE. The fluid absorption has been studied by the expired breath ethanol tests after the addition of ethanol up to a concentration of 1 % to the irrigating fluid. The uptake of I litre of fluid within one hour, which corresponds to an acute decrease in the serum sodium concentration of 5-8 mmols/l, is the volume above which the risk of absorption related symptoms is statistically increased., The average rate of fluid absorption during TURP is 20 ml/min. Due to circulatory overload, the blood volume increases, systolic and diastolic pressures increase and the heart may fail. The absorbed fluid dilutes the serum proteins and decreases the oncotic pressure of blood. This, concurrent with the elevated blood pressure, drives fluid from the vascular to interstitial compartment causing pulmonary and cerebral edema. In addition to direct absorption into the circulation, a significant volume (upto 70%) of the irrigation solution has been found to accumulate interstitially, in the periprostatic and retroperitoneal spaces. For every 100 ml of fluid entering the interstitial compartment, 10-15 meq of sodium also moves with it. Though the duration of surgery has not been conclusively proved to be the determinant for the volume of fluid absorbed, morbidity and mortality were found to be definitely higher when surgery was prolonged over 90 minutes. Intravascular absorption correlates well with the size of the prostate, while interstitial absorption depends primarily on the integrity of prostatic capsule. Circulatory overload occurs when the weight of the gland is more than 45 grams. Another important factor that determines the rate of absorption of fluid is the hydrostatic pressure at the prostatic bed. This pressure depends on the height of irrigating fluid column and the pressure inside the bladder during surgery. The ideal height of irrigating fluid is 60 cm so that approximately 300 ml. of fluid is obtained per minute during resection for good vision. 2. Water Intoxication Some patients with TURP syndrome present symptoms of water intoxication, a neurological disorder caused by increased water content of the brain. The patient becomes first somnolent and then incoherent and restless. Seizures may also develop leading on to coma in decerebrate position. There will be clonus and positive Babinski responses. Papilloedema, with dilated, sluggishly reacting pupils can occur. The EEG will show low voltage, bilaterally. The symptoms of water intoxication appear when serum sodium level falls 15 - 20 meq/l below normal level. 3. Hyponatremia Sodium is essential for proper function of excitatory cells, particularly those of heart and brain. Several mechanisms lead to hyponatremia in TURP patients.,,, Dilution of serum sodium through excessive absorption of irrigation solution. Loss of sodium into the stream of the irrigation fluid from the prostatic resection site. Loss of sodium into pockets of irrigation solution accumulated in the periprostatic and retroperitoneal spaces. Larger amounts of glycine stimulate the release of atrial natriuretic peptide in excess of that expected by the volume load, which further promote natriuresis. The symptoms of hyponatremia are restlessness, confusion, incoherence, coma and seizures. When serum sodium falls below 120 meq/1, hypotension and reduced inyocardial contractility occur. Below 115 meq/1, bradycardia and widening of QRS complexes, ventricular ectopics and T wave inversion occur. Below 100 meq/1 generalised seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, Ventricular Tachycardia (VT), Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) and cardiac arrest occur. Sodium requirement is calculated by the following formula: Sodium Deficit = Normal serum Na - Estimated serum Na x Volume of body water (Body water is usually 60% of body water) 4. Glycine Toxicity Excess of glycine absorbed into circulation is toxic to heart and retina and may lead to hyperammonemia. Experimentally glycine has been found to reduce the vitality and survival of isolated cardiomyocytes. In patients, glycine 1. 5 % has been associated with subacute effects on the myocardium, manifested as depression or inversion of the T wave on the electrocardiogram 24 hr after surgery. Absorption exceeding 500 ml has been shown to double the long-term risk of acute myocardial infarction. This may be one of the reasons for the higher long-term mortality after transurethral versus open prostatectomy, which has been a debate among urologists for some years. TURP seems to depress myocardial function, particularly when the operative duration exceeds 1 hr and when glycine is used at room temperature. About 0. 5% of patients develop acute myocardial infarction during TURP, though transient myocardial ischemia has been detected during 20% of TURPs. Dilutional hypocalcemia has also been implicated as a source of acute cardiovascular disturbances when glycine is absorbed., However calcium is restored more rapidly, probably due to mobilisation of calcium from bone tissues. Glycine is known to be a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord and in the brain stem, probably acting in the same manner as gamma amino butyric acid on the chloride ion channel. Too high a concentration may therefore cause severe depressant effect on the CNS and visual disturbances. Glycolic acid, formate and formaldehyde are other metabolites of glycine and these too can cause visual disturbances. The signs of glycine toxicity are nausea, vomiting, slow respiration, seizures, spells of apnoea and cyanosis, hypotension, oliguria, anuria and then death. When arginine, another nonessential amino acid is added to the glycine infusion, the toxic effect of glycine on the heart is blunted. The mechanism by which arginine protects the heart is unknown. The normal value of serum glycine in man is 13-17 mg/l. Glycine toxicity is very uncommon in TURP patients probably because most of the absorbed glycine is retained in the periprostatic and retroperitoneal spaces, where it has no systemic effect. 5. Ammonia Toxicity Ammonia is a major by-product of glycine metabolism. \" High ammonia concentration suppresses norepinephrine and dopamine release in the brain. This causes the encephalopathy of TURP syndrome. Fortunately ammonia toxicity is rare in man. Characteristically the toxicity occurs within one hour after surgey. The patient develops nausea and vomiting and then lapses into coma. Blood ammonia rises above 500 micromols/1 (normal value is 11-35 micromols/1). Hyperammonemia lasts for over ten hours postoperatively, probably because glycine continues to be absorbed from the periprostatic space. It is not clear why hyperammonemia does not develop in all TURP patients. Hyperammonemia implies that the body cannot fully metabolize glycine through the glycine cleavage system, citric acid cycle and conversion to glycolic acid and glyoxylic acid. Another possible explanation is arginine deficiency. Ammonia is normally converted to urea in the liver via the ornithine cycle. Arginine is one of the intermediary products necessary for this cycle. When a patient has arginine deficiency, ornithine cycle is not fuelled and thus ammonia accumulates. 6. Hypovolemia, Hypotension The classical hemodynamic signs of the TURP syndrome, when glycine is used as irrigating fluid, consist of a transient arterial hypertension, that may be absent if the bleeding is profuse, followed by more prolonged hypotension., Release of prostatic tissue substances and endotoxins into the circulation and associated metabolic acidosis might contribute to this hypotension.,, Blood loss during TURP leads to hypovolemia, causing significant loss in oxygen carrying capacity leading to myocardial ischemia and infarction. Blood loss correlates with the size of prostatic gland resected, duration of surgery and skill of the surgeon. The average blood loss during TURP is 10 m1/gram of prostate resected. 7. Visual Disturbances One of the most alarming complications of TURP syndrome is transient blindness, foggy vision and seeing halos around objects.,, The pupils may be dilated and unresponsive. The optic disc appears normal. The symptom can coexist with other features of TURP syndrome or can be an isolated symptom. The vision returns to normal in 8-48 hours after surgery. TURP blindness is caused by retinal dysfunction probably due to glycine toxicity. Hence perception of light and blink reflexes are preserved and pupillary responses to light and accommodation are lost in TURP blindness, unlike in blindness due to cerebral cortical dysfunction. 8. Perforations Perforation of urinary bladder can occur during TURP due to surgical instrumentation, in difficult resections, overdistension of bladder and rarely explosion inside the bladder. Instrumental perforation of the prostatic capsule has been estimated to occur in 1% of patients undergoing TURP., An early sign of perforation, which often goes unnoticed, is a decreased return of irrigating fluid from the bladder. Abdominal pain, distension, nausea and distress follow. Bradycardia and arterial hypotension are profound. There is also a high risk of failure to diurese spontaneously. In intraperitoneal perforation, symptoms develop faster. Referred shoulder pain due to irritation of diaphragm and hiccoughs are characteristic symptoms., Pallor, diaphoresis, abdominal rigidity, nausea, vomiting and hypotension can occur. In extraperitoneal perforation, reflex movements of lower limbs may occur. Explosions inside the bladder are fortunately rare. Cauterisation of prostatic tissue is believed to liberate flammable gases. Normally not enough oxygen will be available inside the bladder to permit an explosion. But when air enters with the irrigant, explosions can occur. 9. Coagulopathies Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) or consumption coagulopathy can occur due to release of prostatic particles rich in tissue thromboplastins into the circulation causing secondary fibrinolysis. Dilutional thrombocytopenia can aggravate the situation. DIC can be detected in the blood by a decrease in platelet count, high levels of fibrin degradation products (FDP, >150 mg/dl) and low plasma fibrinogen levels (400 mg/dl). 10. Bacteremia, Septicemia and Toxemia About 30% of all TURP patients have infected urine preoperatively. When prostatic venous sinuses are opened preoperatively and high pressure irrigation is used, bacteria enter the circulation. In about 6% of patients, the bacteremia is complicated by septicemia. Absorption of bacterial endotoxins and toxic byproducts of tissue coagulation may lead to a toxic state in some patients postoperatively. Severe chills, fever, capillary dilatation and hypotension can occur temporarily in these patients. 11. Hypothermia Hypothermia is a frequent observation in patients undergoing TURP. A drop in the body temperature alters the hemodynamic situation, results in shivering and markedly increases oxygen consumption. Bladder irrigation is an important source of heat loss and the use of irrigating fluids at room temperature results in a decrease in body temperature of 1-2deg C. This is aggravated by the cold atmospheric temperature of operation theatre. Elderly patients are particularly susceptible to hypothermia because of possible autonomic dysfunction. The associated vasoconstriction and acidosis can adversely affect the heart and can contribute to CNS manifestations. Shivering can also enhance bleeding from the resection site. Prophylaxis Against TURP Syndrome Identification of early symptoms of TURP syndrome and prevention is essential to retard the onset of severe and fatal manifestations in patients undergoing endoscopic surgeries. Pre-existing hyponatremia should be identified and corrected, especially in patients on diuretics and low salt diet. Prophylactic antibiotics may have a role in the prevention of bacteremia and septicemia. Central Venous Pressure (CVP) monitoring or pulmonary artery catheterisation is necessary in patients with cardiac illness. The ideal height of irrigating fluid is 60 cm. The duration of TURP should be restricted to 1 hour, and in cases requiring more duration of resection, staged TURP should be performed. Prostatic capsule should be preserved as far as possible and distension of bladder avoided. Continuous flow methods have been claimed to decrease fluid absorption, whereas some authors have found no such reduction. Serum sodium should be estimated every 30 minutes and necessary corrections should be made. The fluid therapy should be restricted to maintain optimum hemodynamics. Prophylactic frusemide should be given to avoid fluid overload. Whenever possible, packed cells should be preferred to whole blood for transfusion to avoid circulatory overload. Increasing the atmospheric temperature of operation theatre, use of warm blankets, mattresses and intravenous fluids and using irrigating fluids prewarmed to 37deg C help to avoid hypothermia. General Anesthesia vs Regional Anesthesia in TURP TURP performed under regional anesthesia without sedation (Awake TURP) is preferable to general anesthesia due to the following reasons: Early manifestations of TURP syndrome are better detected in awake patients. Peripheral vasodilatation helps to minimize circulatory overloading. Provides some degree of postoperative analgesia. Blood loss will be less. However the possible sudden hemodynamic fluctuations of spinal or epidural anesthesia should be taken into consideration before administering regional anesthesia. Treatment The treatment of TURP syndrome involves correction of various pathophysiological mechanisms operating in body homeostasis.,,,, Ideally the treatment has to be instituted before serious CNS or cardiac complications occur. When TURP syndrome is diagnosed, surgical procedure should be terminated as early as possible. Frusemide should be administered in a dose of 1 mg/kg intravenously. However, the use of frusemide to treat TURP syndrome has been questioned because it increases sodium excretion. Hence 15% mannitol has been suggested as a better choice, due to its action independent of sodium excretion and its tendency to increase extracellular osmolality. Oxygen should be administered by nasal cannula. Pulmonary edema should be managed by tracheal intubation and positive pressure ventilation with 100% oxygen. Arterial blood gases, hemoglobin and serum sodium are to be estimated. Correction of hyponatremia should be done by diuresis and slow administration of 3-5% hypertonic saline at the rate of not more than 0. 5 meq/1 per hour or not faster than 100 ml/hr. Approximately 200 ml of hypertonic saline is needed for correction of hyponatremia. Rapid administration of saline leads to pulmonary edema and central pontine myelinolysis. Two-thirds of the hypertonic saline restores serum sodium and osmolality, while one-third redistributes water from cells to the extracellular space, where it becomes available to diuretic treatment with frusemide. Intravenous calcium may be used to treat acute cardiac disturbances during surgery. Seizures should be managed by diazepam/midazolam/barbiturate/dilantin or a muscle relaxant depending on the severity. Significant blood loss should be managed by administering packed red cells. In cases of DIC, fibrinogen 3-4 gms should be given intravenously followed by heparin infusion 2000 units bolus (and then 500 units per hour). Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and platelets may also be used depending on the coagulation profile. Surgical drainage of retroperitoneal fluid in cases of perforation can reduce the morbidity and mortality significantly.",

        "question": "Pulmonary surfactant is synthesized by:",
        "exp": "Ans: B (Type II Pneumocytes) Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th edition. Explanation: The surfactant is produced by type II alveolar cells. Type II pneumocytes also called alveolar type II cells, great alveolar cells or septal cells are granular and roughly cuboidal in shape. Type II pneumocytes are typically found at the alveolar-septal junction. Although they comprise 60% of the alveolar lining cells, because of their shape they cover a much smaller surface area than type I cells (<5%). Type II cells start to develop at about 24 weeks of gestation, secreting small amounts of surfactant. However, adequate amounts of surfactant are not secreted until about 35 weeks of gestation - this is the main reason for increased incidence rates of Infant respiratory distress syndrome, which drastically reduces at ages above 35 weeks gestation. Type II cells are responsible for the production and secretion of surfactant (the majority of which are dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine). a group of phospholipids that reduce the alveolar surface tension. Surfactant phospholipids are stored in Type II pneumocytes in lamellar bodies, which are specialized vesicles. The release of surfactant in lamellar bodies occurs from an infant's first breath onwards. Type II pneumocytes can replicate in the alveoli and will replicate to replace damaged Type I pneumocytes. MUC1, a human gene associated with type II pneumocytes. has been identified as a marker in lung cancer. Clara cells. These are dome-shaped cells with short microvilli found in the small airways {bronchioles) of the lungs. Clara cells are found in the ciliated simple epithelium.

Watchful waiting is the active monitoring of the condition and hearing in anticipation of spontaneous resolution Guidlines aimed at both primary care and specialist otolaryngologist broadly agree that a watchful waiter periodfor about three months is the initial management of children with serous otitis media. Therefore, unle there are also signs of an infection, most health care providers will not treat SOM at first Instead, they w recheck the problem in 2-3 months. This should be coupled with reassurance that doing nothing is as likely doing something to result in resolution of the SOM and the associated symptoms. Surgery. Surgical intervention is recommended when watchful waiting and monitoring of hearing has confirmed failu of resolution of SOM. Following surgical intervention are used commonly: -Myringotomy and aspiration of fluid: -An incision is made in tympanic membrane and fluid aspirated with suction. Grommet (ventilation tube) surgery: - If myringotomy and aspiration combined writh medical measures has not helped and fluid recurs, a grommet is inserted to provide continued aeration of middle ear.

The resultant effect is focal ischemia of parenchyma supplied by vessels with thickened walls and consequent narrowed lumens. The parenchymal effects include glomerulosclerosis and chronic tubulointersititial injury, producing a reduction in functional renal mass. The kidneys are either normal or moderately reduced in size. The cortical surfaces have a fine, even granularity that resembles grain leather. The loss of mass is due mainly to cortical scarring and shrinking. On histologic examination there is narrowing of the lumens of arterioles and small arteries, caused by thickening and hyalinization of the walls (hyaline arteriolosclerosis). Corresponding to the fine surface granulations are microscopic subcapsular scars with sclerotic glomeruli and tubular dropout, alternating with better preserved parenchyma. In addition, the interlobular and arcuate arteries show a characteristic lesion that consists of medial hypertrophy, reduplication of the elastic lamina, and increased myofibroblastic tissue in the intima, which combine to narrow the lumen. This change, called fibroelastic hyperplasia, often accompanies hyaline arteriolosclerosis and increases in severity with age and in the presence of hypertension.",

        "exp": "The patient most likely has a delayed onset of puberty rather than a destructive lesion in the hypothalamic/pituitary axis, a primary disease involving the ovaries or a problem involving the end-organs (e. g., imperfo\u00adrate hymen). Note that she has normal secondary sex characteristics indicating the presence of estrogen. She had withdrawal bleeding after being given progester\u00adone, which proves that the endometrial mucosa has already been primed with estrogen. In addition, a normal menstrual flow implies the absence of an end organ defect preventing menses from occurring. Primary amenorrhea refers to the absence of men\u00adstruation by age 16 years. As a general rule, amenorrhea is the hallmark for hypogonadism, assuming that no end-organ abnormalities are present. As with second\u00adary amenorrhea, primary amenorrhea is subdivided on the basis of gonadotropin levels (follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone ). Amenorrhea in the presence of elevated gonadotropins is designated as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (primary ovarian disease), while reduced gonadotropin levels is called hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (hy\u00adpothalamic/pituitary disease). Normal levels of FSH and LH in the presence of normal secondary sex char\u00adacteristics usually indicate an end-organ abnormality. Absence of secondary sex characterisitics by age 16 years is always a more significant finding than having a patient with normal secondary sex characteristics. In addition to ordering gonadotropin levels, a pro\u00adgesterone challenge is an excellent test to perform in the initial evaluation of these patients. The absence of menses confirms that there is a problem, but it does not differentiate among the three main areas previously cited. Withdrawal bleeding indicates that the endometrial mucosa must have been primed with estrogen, so the hypothalamic/pituitary axis and ova\u00adries must be normal. This test also rules out an end\u00adorgan defect. The following chart (partial list) provides a classification for these subdivisions of primary amen\u00adorrhea.",

Imaging may also be performed in patients with a known history of multiple endocrine problems. Computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have higher sensitivity in detecting pheochromocytomas than nuclear medicine scanning with iodine-131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG), although 131I-MIBG uptake is more specific. Some authors prefer to use MIBG uptake scanning as the initial screening modality because it enables whole-body imaging, making it useful for the detection of extra-adrenal tumors and metastatic deposits. Once an adrenal or extra-adrenal tumor is detected, CT scanning or MRI of the region may be performed for anatomic localization prior to surgical removal. If 131I-MIBG uptake is negative but the clinical findings suggest pheochromocytoma, CT scanning or MRI of the chest or abdomen may be performed, because the false-negative rate of MIBG scintigraphy is 10%. Luster et al investigated the specificity and sensitivity of (18)F-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, CT scanning, and a combination of the 2 modalities in the identification and localization of adrenal and extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. Nineteen lesions were detected by all 3 imaging methods, but only DOPA PET/CT scanning accurately characterized and localized them all, demonstrating, on a per-patient basis, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88%. A further study by Gaertner et al concluded the (18)F-LMI1195 is a promising tracer for tumor imaging. Saad et al found in a study of 23 patients with a history of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma that (18)F-FDG PET/CT was a superior tool for the localization of recurrent tumors.

        "exp": "Ans is 'c' i. e., Pyruvate kinase Reactions of gluconeogenesiso Gluconeogenesis involves glycolysis, the citric acid cycle plus some special reactions. Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis share the same pathway but in opposite direction. Seven reactions of glycolysis are reversible and therefore are used with the same enzyme in the synthesis of glucose by gluconeogenesis. However, three of the reactions of glycolysis are irreversible and must be circumvented by four special reactions which are unique to gluconeogenesis and catalyzed by (1) Pyruvate carboxylase Q, (ii) Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, (iii) Fructose-1, 6- bisphosphatase Q, (iv) Glucose-6-phosphatase. These four enzymes are the key enzymes of gluconeogenesis (or gluconeogenesis enzymes). Among these four, pyruvate carboxylase is a mitochondrial enzyme and other three are cytoplasmic enzymes. o All three irreversible steps of glycolysis should be bypassed for gluconeogenesis to occur. These three bypass steps are circumvented by four special reactions. First bypass (conversion of pyruvate into phosphoenolpyruvate): - Conversion of pyruvate into phosphoenolpyruvate takes place through two reactions. Carboxylation of pyruvate: - First, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is converted into oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase. Pyruvate carboxylase is a mitochondrial enzyme, therefore these reactions occur in mitochondria only. Conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate: - Oxaloacetate produced in the mitochondria cannot cross the membrane. It is first reduced to malate, which then moves across the mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. Malate is, then, reoxidized to oxaloacetate in the cytosol. Oxaloacetate is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase. Second bypass: - Conversion of fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate into fructose-6-phosphate is catalyzed by fructose- 1, 6-bisphosphatase. Its presence determines whether a tissue is capable of synthesizing glucose (gluconeogenesis) or glycogen (gluconeogenesis) not only from pyruvate but also from triose phosphate. It is present in liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle, but is probably absent from heart and smooth muscle. C) Third bypass: - Conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose is catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase.",

Atracurium and eisatracuriuni (stereoisomer of atracurium) are the only two drugs metabolized by Hoffman elimination. Atracurium is a short acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker. Atracurium is metabolized by Non-specific esterases & Hoffman's elimination, independent of renal and hepatic metabolism. Hence Drug of choice in hepatic and renal failure. Hoffman's elimination. It is the spontaneous non-enzymatic chemical breakdown at physiologic PH and temperature. Hoffman's elimination of atracurium gives a metabolite called laudanosine which can precipitate seizures. It triggers the release of histamine leading to hypotension, tachycardia & bronchospasm. Dosage - 0. 5mg/kg (See the following table) Atracurium. Cisatracurium(stereoisomer of Atracurium). Potency.

Histologically paranasal sinuses are lined by ciliated columnar epithelium with goblet cells which secrete mucus. Sphenoethmoidal recess lies above the superior turbinate and receives the opening of the sphenoid sinuscalled bulla ethmoidalis, which is due to middle ethmoidal air cell which opens on or above it.

It is caused by a dietary lack of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Epidemiology Scurvy in adults is rare. Young children and older persons are predisposed to scurvy due to their diet or the overheating of food. It does not occur before six months of age because maternal stores are maintained until then. Males and females are equally affected. Clinical presentation Patients may present with lethargy and malaise, bone pain, bleeding diathesis (e. g. bleeding gums), and impaired wound healing. Pathology Unlike most other animals, humans cannot produce their own vitamin C. Lack of dietary vitamin C (ascorbic acid) may be related to inadequate food intake, the destruction of vitamin C in food caused by cooking and canning, or the absence of fresh fruit in the diet. Vitamin C is essential for collagen synthesis, acting as a coenzyme to producing cross-linking of collagen fibres. Defective collagen cross-linking compromises skin, joint, bone, and vascular integrity. Radiographic features Paediatric generalised osteopenia cortical thinning: \"pencil-point\" cortex periosteal reaction due to subperiosteal haemorrhage scorbutic rosary: expansion of the costochondral junctions may relate to the fracturing of the zone of provisional calcification during normal respiration similar to the rachitic rosary appearance as seen in rickets haemarthrosis Wimberger ring sign: circular, opaque radiologic shadow surrounding epiphyseal centres of ossification, which may result from bleeding Frankel line: dense zone of provisional calcification Trummerfeld zone: lucent metaphyseal band underlying Frankel line Pelken spur: metaphyseal spurs which result in cupping of the metaphysis Adults osteopenia pathologic fractures Other significant manifestations in both children and adults arise from the propensity for bleeding, including intra-articular, retrobulbar, and intracranial haemorrhage. History and etymology Infantile scurvy, also known as Barlow disease, is named after Sir Thomas Barlow (1845-1945), British Royal Physician. The term scurvy comes from various words used to describe the manifestations of the condition: covered with scabs, diseased, scorbutic. scheurbuik (Dutch) scorbut (French) skybjugr (Old Norse): a swelling (bjugr) from drinking sour milk (skyr) on long sea voyages Differential diagnosis rickets congenital syphilis neuroblastoma The white line of Frenkel is seen in - i) Scurvy iii) Plumbism v) Severe protein-energy malnutrition ii) Healing rickets iv) Acute leukemia vi) Congenital syphilis",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e Invaginated posteriorly by cruciate ligament The knee is the largest and most complex joint of the body. The complexity is the result of the fusion of three joints in one. These 3 joints are: Lateral femorotibial. Medial femorotibial. Femoropatellar joint. The knee joint is supported by a no. of ligaments & cartilagesfibrous capsuleligamentum patella c) tibial collateral ligament d) fibular collateral ligamentum. Oblique popliteal ligament. Arcuate popliteal ligament. Cruciate ligaments. Semilunar cartilage ( Menisci). Transverse ligaments. Cruciate ligament. There are two cruciate ligaments Anterior and posterior. They are termed cruciate because they cross anterior and posterior from their tibial attachments. The anterior cruciate ligament is attached to the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia and passes upwards, backward and laterally to be attached to the posterior part of the medial surface of the lateral femoral condyle. The posterior cruciate ligament is attached to the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia and passes upwards forward and medially to be attached to the anterior part of the lateral surface of the medial femoral condyle. Synovial membrane: lines the capsule of the knee joint and is attached to the margins of the articular surfaces and to the peripheral edges of the menisci The synovial membrane, on the front of the joint forms a pouch which extends beneath the quadriceps femoris muscle forming the suprapatellar bursa. It also forms the following bursae. Popliteal bursa*Semimembranous bursa*The cruciate ligaments have a complex relationship with the synovial membrane; From the posterior part of the fibrous capsule, the synovial membrane projects forwards in the intercondylar regions as a cul-de-sac to envelop the sides of both cruciate ligaments and to the front of the anterior cruciate ligament. Thus even though the cruciate ligaments are intracapsular, are extra-synovial structures. Well, I think that this explanation is somewhat confusing; that's because of the lack of a 3-dimensional figure. So just turn over the pages of your Anatomy book along with Grant's Atlas. If you don't have time to do so just learn these 3 points: The knee joint communicates with the following bursae: Suprapatellar bursa. Popliteal bursa. Semimembranous bursathe surface of the menisci have no synovial covering synovial membrane is invaginated posteriorly by the cruciate ligament",

Objective: The Policy seeks to reach everyone in a comprehensive integrated way to move towards wellness. It aims at achieving universal health coverage and delivering quality health care services to all at an affordable cost. Goal: The policy envisages as its goal the attainment of the highest possible level of health and well- being for all at all ages, through a preventive and promotive health care orientation in all developmental policies, and universal access to good quality healthcare services without anyone having to face financial hardship as a consequence. Shift focus from maternal and child health to non communicable diseases. Targets: The Policy has assigned specific quantitative targets aimed at reduction of disease prevalence/incidence under 3 broad components viz. (a) health status and programme impact, (b) health system performance and (c) health systems strengthening, aligned to the policy objectives. Key Features: 1. The policy recognizes the pivotal role of SDGs. 2. It commits highest professionalism, ethics and integrity in the entire health care delivery system. 3. It is patient-centric, dynamic, adaptive, decentralized and promises to deliver equitable, universal, affordable, accountable, quality health care. 4. It supports medical pluralism and recognizes AYUSH in the health care delivery system. 5. A multistakeholder approach with partnership & participation of all non- health ministries and communities. 6. The NHP, 2017 advocates a positive and proactive engagement with the private sector for critical gap filling towards achieving national goals. 7. The policy proposes raising public health expenditure to 2. 5% of the GDP in a time bound manner. 8. This policy denotes important change from very selective to comprehensive primary health care package which includes geriatric health care, palliative care and rehabilitative care services. The facilities which start providing the larger package of comprehensive primary health care will be called \"Health and Wellness Centers\" Primary care must be assured. To provide comprehensive care, the policy recommends a matching human resources development strategy, effective logistics support system and referral backup. 2/3rd resources to primary health care. 9. The policy aspires to provide at the district level most of the secondary care which is currently provided at a medical college hospital. 10. Aims to have at least two beds per thousand population distributed in such a way that it is accessible within golden hour rule. 11. Purchasing care after due diligence from non-Government hospitals as a short-term strategy till public systems are strengthened. 12. It seeks to ensure improved access and affordability of quality secondary and tertiary care services through a combination of public hospitals and strategic purchasing in healthcare deficit areas from accredited non-governmental healthcare providers, achieve significant reduction in out of pocket expenditure due to healthcare costs, reinforce trust in public healthcare system and influence operation and growth of private healthcare industry as well as medical technologies in alignment with public health goals. 13. Policy recognizes the need for an information system with comprehensive data on availability and utilization of services not only in public hospitals but also in nongovernment sector hospitals. 14. The policy advocates extensive deployment of digital tools for improving the efficiency and outcome of the healthcare system and proposes establishment of National Digital Health Authority (NDHA) to regulate, develop and deploy digital health across the continuum of care. To help in developing family health cards (to provide digital access to patient data) 15. To strengthen the Human resources, the policy advocates review of Medical Syllabus in light of new emerging diseases, National level entry examination for medical education, establishing more AIIMS like institute to keep a continuous flow of faculty to medical college's and biomedical research, capacity building, and Skill development programme. 16. Policy has recommended incentive for doctors serving in remote area, also development of Public health cadre to manage the health programme. 17. Identified seven areas for inter sectoral action & people's campaign under \"Swasth Nagrik Abhiyan\" has been identified so that people stay healthy & rely less on hospital care. 18. The policy advocates for Clinical Establishment ACT 2010 to be implemented with provision for special medical tribunal committee for speedy resolution of complaints. There is the provision of regulatory rule in the field of availability and pricing of the medical technologies and drugs, clinical research, clinical trial, food safety, vaccine safety. 19. The policy advocates a progressively incremental assurance based approach. 20. National Health Care Standard Organization: formulate guidelines & protocols for health care.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e. Apoptosis Apoptosis is a programmed cell death. Mechanism of Apoptosis. Apoptosis is induced by a cascade of molecular events that may be initiated in distinct ways but culminate in the activation of caspases. Caspases are central to the pathogenesis of apoptosis. The process of apoptosis is divided into two phases. Initiation phase - During this phase caspases become catalytically active. Execution phase - During this phase caspases act to cause cell death. Initiation phase of apoptosis. Initiation of apoptosis occurs principally by signals from two distinct but convergent pathways. Extrinsic or receptor-initiated pathway. Intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway. Extrinsic or death receptor-initiated pathway. This pathway is initiated by expression of cell surface death receptors on a variety of cells. Death receptors are members of tumor necrosis factor receptor family that contain a cytoplasmic domain involved in protein-protein interactions that are called death domain because it is essential for delivering apoptotic signals (or death signals). The best-known death receptors are the type 1 TNF receptor (TNFRI) and a related protein called Fas (CD95). When the Fas receptors are cross-linked by its ligand it triggers a sequence of events which eventually leads to activation of caspases. This pathway of apoptosis can be inhibited by a protein called FLIP, which can bind to inactive or procaspases but cannot cleave and activate these enzymes. The intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. This pathway has no role for death receptors. This pathway is the result of increased mitochondrial permeability and the release of proapoptotic molecules in the cytoplasm. Note that antiapoptotic proteins reside in the mitochondrial membrane (Bcl-2 and Bcl-X). When cells are deprived of survival signals or subjected to stress Bcl-2 and Bcl-X are lost from the mitochondrial membrane and are replaced by proapoptotic members of the family such as Bak, Bax, and Bim. This leads to increase in the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane. Due to increased permeability of the mitochondrial membrane, several proteins that can activate the caspase leak out. One of these proteins is cytochrome C, well known for its role in mitochondrial respiration. In the cytoplasm, cytochrome binds to a protein called Apaf-1 (apoptosis-activating factor-1) and the complex activates caspase.* So, the final result of both the pathways that are extrinsic receptor mediated pathway and the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway is the same i. e. activation of the caspase. The execution phase of apoptosis. After being activated the caspases act on many cellular components. They cleave cytoskeletal and nuclear matrix proteins and thus disrupts the cytoskeleton. They also lead to the breakdown of the nucleus. In the nucleus, the' target of caspase activation includes proteins involved in transcription, DNA replication and. DNA repair.",

Pg. 47 Explanation: Anaerobic culture medium Commonly used anaerobic culture media are: Robertson's cooked meat medium. It consists of fat-free minced cooked meat in broth, with a layer of sterile vaseline over it. It permits the growth of even strict anaerobes and indicates their saccharolytic or proteolytic activities, by the meat being turned red or black, respectively. Thioglycollate broth with lie min and vitamin K is an enriched liquid medium for culturing anaerobes. Addition of a small quantity of agar enhances the anaerobic capacity of the medium by slowing the diffusion of oxygen in it. Broth containing fresh animal tissue, such as rabbit kidney, spleen, testes or heart, supports the growth of many anaerobes. E. g. Smith- Noguchi medium Reduction of oxygen in the medium for anaerobic culture can be achieved by the use of various reducing agents, including 1 % glucose. 0. 1 deg0 thioglycollates. 0. 1 % ascorbic acid and 0. 05% cysteine.

Continuous exposure to nitroglycerin through use of a transdermal skin patch has frequently caused nitrate tolerance. A daily 10-to-14-hour drug \u00adfree period will prevent nitrate tolerance. Nitrate tolerance is a cellular tolerance caused by depletion of sulfhydryl groups required for receptor signal trans\u00adduction. The drug-free interval allows time for these groups to replenish before the next period of drug exposure. Nitrates are metabolized by hepatic nitro reductase, and there is neither evidence of cytochrome P 450 involvement nor of induction of this enzyme by drugs.

The change in lung volume per unit change in the airway pressure (DV/DP) is the stretchability (compliance) of the lungs and chest wall. 0 It is in pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema; increased in emphysema and normal aging. COMPLIANCE OF THE LUNGS & CHEST WALL # The interaction between the recoil of the lungs and recoil of the chest can be demonstrated in living subjects through a spirometer that has a valve just beyond the mouthpiece. # The respiratory muscles are then relaxed while the pressure in the airway is recorded. The procedure is repeated after inhaling or actively exhaling various volumes. The curve of airway pressure obtained in this way, plotted against volume, is the relaxation pressure curve of the total respiratory system. # The pressure is zero at a lung volume that corresponds to the volume of gas in the lungs at the end of quiet expiration (functional residual capacity, or FRC; also known as relaxation volume). It is positive at greater volumes and negative at smaller volumes. # The change in lung volume per unit change in airway pressure (V/P) is the compliance (stretchability) of the lungs and chest wall. It is normally measured in the pressure range where the relaxation pressure curve is steepest, and the normal value is approximately 0. 2 L/cm H-, 0. However, compliance depends on lung volume; an individual with only one lung has approximately half the V for a given P. # Compliance is also slightly greater when measured during deflation than when measured during inflation. Consequently, it is more informative to examine the whole pressure - volume curve. # The curve is shifted downward and to the right (compliance is decreased) by pulmonary congestion and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive restrictive airway disease of unknown cause in which there is stiffening and scarring of the lung. The curve is shifted upward and to the left (compliance is increased) in emphysema. It should be noted that compliance is a static measure of lung and chest recoil. # The resistance of the lung and chest is the pressure difference required for a unit of air flow; this measurement, which is dynamic rather than static, also takes into account the resistance to air flow in the airways. Educational point: The total compliance of both lungs together in the normal adult human being averages about 200 mil- liliters of air %imeter of water transpulmonary pressure. That is, every time the transpulmonary pressure increases 1 centimeter of water, the lung volume, after 10 to 20 seconds, will expand 200 milliliters.",

All the babies fulfilling above criteria should be screened with indirect ophthalmoscopy between 32-36 weeks post conceptionQ. The goal of treatment of threshold ROP is to prevent any retinal detachment or scarring and optimization of visual outcome. So laser photocoagulation of avascular immature retina is recommended in infants with threshold disease. According to ETROP (early treatment for ROP cooperative group) the high risk pre threshold disease (i. e. zone 1 any stage plus (+)disease; or zone 1/stage 3; or zone 2, stage 2/3 plus ROP) is treated by laser photocoagulation. \"Management of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP). Classification of ROP by Anatomic Location (Zone)* For the purpose of defining the anteroposterior (AP) location of ROP the retina is div ided into 3 concentric zones centred on optic disc.* The centre of retinal map for ROP is optic disc not the mcula as in other maps.* Since there is a direct correction between severity of disease and amount of avascular retina the location of the border between vascularized and avascular retina is an important prognostic sign.* The most anterior normal retinal vascularization is identified and is assigned a zone. Zone IMost posterior circular zone with optic disc as centre and twice the disc- fovea (or centre of macule) distance as radius. Any ROP in this zone is very severe because of large peripheral areas of avascular retina. Zone IIIt is a doughnut shaped region that extends concentrically from the anterior border of zone 1 to within 1 disc diameter of the ora serrata nasally and to anatomic equator temporally. Its radius extends from centre of disc to the nasal ora-serrata. A circle is drawn with optical disc as centre and disc to nasal ora-serrata as radius. The area between zone 1 and this boundary is zone IIZone IIIIt encompasses the residual temporal crescentshaped retina anterior to zone 2. Clinical Assessment/Classification based on Severity (Stage) of disease. Stage. Feature1(1)* Demarcation line: It is appearance of a thin, flat, white (grey) tortuous line (border) at the junction of mature vascularized retina posteriorly and immature avascular retina anteriorly. * It runs roughly parallel with the ora-serrata and is more prominent in temporal periphery.* It is seen at the edge of vessels dividing the vascular from avascular retina i. e. the abnormal branching or arcading of vesseiss lead upto the line.

        "exp": "Ans- D Ref- The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 was enacted by the Parliament during 1994 and came into force on February 4, 1995 in the States of Goa, Himachal Pradesh and Maharashtra and all the Union Territories. Thereafter it was adopted by all States except the States of Jammu & Kashmir and Andhra Pradesh, which have their own legislations to regulate transplantation of Human Organs. Purpose of the Act The main purpose of the Act is to regulate the removal, storage and transplantation of human organs for therapeutic purposes and to prevent commercial dealings in human organs. The Act contains detailed provisions relating to the authority for removal of human organs, preservation of human organs, regulation of hospitals conducting the removal, storage or transplantation of human organs, functions of appropriate authority, registration of hospitals and punishment/penalties for offences relating to aforesaid matters. For more information, visit THOA Act - 1994 Transplantation of Human Organs (Amendment) Act, 2011 The Government of India enacted the Transplantation of Human Organs (Amendment) Act, 2011 that allows swapping of organs and widens the donor pool by including grandparents and grandchildren in the list. Some of the important amendments under this Act to promote organ donation are as follows. Provision of 'Retrieval Centres' for retrieval of organs from deceased donors and their registration under the amended Act. Definition of near relative expanded to include grandparents and grandchildren. Brain death certification Board has been simplified and more experts have been permitted for this certification. 'Mandatory' inquiry and informing option to donate in case of unfortunate event of brain stem death of ICU patient for the purpose of organ donation. Mandatory 'Transplant Coordinator' for coordinating all matters relating to removal or transplantation of human organs. National Human Organs and Tissues Removal and Storage Network at one or more places and regional network. National Registry of Donors and Recipients. Removal of eye has been permitted by a trained technician to facilitate eye donation. Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Rules (THOT), 2014 The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Rules (THOT), 2014 has many provisions to remove the impediments to organ donation while curbing misuse/misinterpretation of the rules. The following are a few The medical practitioner who will be part of the organ transplantation team for carrying out transplantation operation shall not be a member of the Authorisation Committee constituted under the Act. When the proposed donor or recipient or both are not Indian nationals or citizens whether near relatives or otherwise, the Authorisation Committee shall consider all such requests and the transplantation shall not be permitted if the recipient is a foreign national and donor is an Indian national unless they are near relatives. When the proposed donor and the recipient are not near relatives, the Authorisation Committee shall evaluate that there is no commercial transaction between the recipient and the donor and that no payment has been made to the donor or promised to be made to the donor or any other person Cases of swap donation referred to under subsection shall be approved by Authorisation Committee of hospital or district or State in which transplantation is proposed to be done and the donation of organs shall be permissible only from near relatives of the swap recipients. When the recipient is in a critical condition in need of life saving organ transplantation within a week, the donor or recipient may approach hospital in-charge to expedite evaluation by the Authorisation Committee. The quorum of the Authorisation Committee should be minimum four and is not complete without the participation of the Chairman, Secretary (Health) or nominee and Director of Health Services or nominee. Every authorised transplantation centre must have its own website. The Authorisation Committee is required to take final decision within twenty four hours of holding the meeting for grant of permission or rejection for transplant and the decision of the Authorisation Committee should be displayed on the notice board of the hospital and the website within twenty four hours of taking the decision. The website of transplantation centre shall be linked to State/Regional/National Networks through online system for organ procurement, sharing and transplantation. There would be an apex national networking organization at the centre. There would also be regional and State level networking organizations where large of number of transplantation of organ(s) or tissue (s) are performed. The State units would be linked to hospitals, Organ/Tissue matching Labs and Tissue Banks within their area and also to regional and national networking organisations. Such networks shall coordinate procurement, storage, transportation, matching, allocation and transplantation of organs/tissues and shall develop norms and standard operating procedures. A National Registry on Donors and recipients of Human Organ and Tissue accessible on-line through dedicated website having National, Regional and State level specificities will come into force. National/Regional registry shall be compiled based on similar registries at State level. The identity of the people in the database shall not be in public domain.",

Explanation: Both C & D appear to he equally long-acting Duration of Action of Local Anesthetics. It depends on; Dose: Increasing the dose, increases the duration. Pharmacokinetic profile of drug: It includes Plasma protein binding (Alpha I acid glycoprotein)o Agents with high protein binding like bupivacaine have prolonged action. Metabolismo Esters are metabolized by pseudocholinesterase and amides are metabolized in the liver by microsomal enzymes, o Esters have a small duration of action than amides. Addition of Vasoconstrictors. Vasoconstrictors decrease the systemic absorption of LA in blood, so increases the concentration thereby increasing the duration of action. Eg; Adrenaline, Phenylephrine (1: 20000), Noradrenaline. Felypressin (a synthetic analog of vasopressin). Adrenaline. It is used in a concentration of 1: 200000 (I in 2 lakh). Duration of both sensory and motor blockade is increased in Adrenaline + Lignocaine. The only sensory blockade is prolonged without any effect on motor blockade in Adrenaline + Bupivacaine.

If the patient has no spontaneous respirations, steps should be immediately taken to breathe for the child Airway should be opened and rescue breathing should be provided. Rescue breathing is done by Mouth to mouth Mouth to nose Mouth to mask Bag mask respirations. Successful rescue breathing will provide good chest rise and relief of deep cyanosis. Usually after bag and mask ventilation it should be checked whether spontaneous ventilation is present or not. This is assessed by watching the chest movements If these do not indicate adequate ventilation, immediate intubation is the next step. But in the question they have not specified, whether the ventilation is adequate or not (after the oxygenation). If they wanted to know this, it would have been specifically mentioned in the question that the patient remained in apnea after the bag & mask ventilation. So we can assume that the ventilation becomes normal after bag and mask ventilation. Once the respiratory system is taken care of cardiovascular system needs attention.

The defect in chloride reabsorption in the ascending tubule also affects the reabsorption of so\u00addium; therefore, there is an augmented distal delivery of sodium with increased exchange of sodium for po\u00adtassium and hydrogen ions in the distal tubule, produc\u00ading a hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis.
