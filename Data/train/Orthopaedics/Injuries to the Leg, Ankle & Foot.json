A resaonably satisfactory rule of thumb for selecting the level of bone section is to allow 2.5 cm of bone length for each 30 cm of body height. Usually the most satisfactory level is about 15cm distal to joint line. A stump less than 12.5 cm lacking quadriceps function is less efficient.Note: This rule is not applicable to ischaemic limbs where amputations performed customarily at a higher level (10-12.5 cm distal to joint line).

However, a tilt of the talus > 20deg on forced inversion or eversion indicates a complete tear of the lateral or medial collateral ligement respectively.# MRI is best tool to detect and evaluate ligament injuries.0Rx:However, tresnt today to Rx ligament injuries in general is by 4functional9 method i.e. without immobilation.The Rx consist of RICE:R I C E = Rest, Ice-packs, Compression and Elevation for first 2-3 days.",
