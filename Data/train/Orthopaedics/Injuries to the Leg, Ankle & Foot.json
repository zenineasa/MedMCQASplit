In non-ischaemic limbs of adults, the ideal bone length for below knee (trans tibial) amputation stump is 12. 5 to 17. 5 cm depending on body height. A resaonably satisfactory rule of thumb for selecting the level of bone section is to allow 2. 5 cm of bone length for each 30 cm of body height. Usually the most satisfactory level is about 15cm distal to joint line. A stump less than 12. 5 cm lacking quadriceps function is less efficient. Note: This rule is not applicable to ischaemic limbs where amputations performed customarily at a higher level (10-12. 5 cm distal to joint line). But due to frequent co-morbidities in patients with ischaemic limb, the functional demands can be compromised.",

Derived from Greek words orthos (\"correct\" \"straight\") and paidion (\"child\") in 1741. 2. Jean-Andre-Venal - He established the first orthopaedic institute in 1780, Venel is regarded by many as the \"Father of orthopaedics\" because of his development of the practical application. 3. Dr. Antonius Mathijsen - Dutch army surgeon who first used plaster of paris to fixate broken bones to a village physician in Budel. 4. Vittorio - Putti - he showed the method of treatment ankylosis, CDH, post traumatic deformities, shortening of the limb, paralysis and bone tumours. 5. Themistocles, Gluck - First total replacement was performed in Berlin in 1890. 6. Gerhard Kuntscher - who inaugurated the intramedullary nailing of long bone fractures. 7. Ruth-Jackson- first female board certified orthopaedic surgeon in the US. Expert in problems of the foot and ankle joints and those cervical spine. 8. Masaki Wantanabe - was a Japanese orthopaedic surgeon, sometimes called the \"founder of modem arthroscopy\"9. Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov - was a Soviet physician, known for inventing the Ilizarow apparatus for lengthening limb bones and for his eponymous surgery. 10. John Nevil Insall - English orthopaedic surgeon, who contributed extensively to the advancement of total knee replacement surgery. He designed four models of widely used system. 11. Dr. Stephen Burkhart - First surgeon in the world to develop, use and teach arthroscopic technology for treating shoulder injuries. 12. Sir John Charnley - British orthopaedic surgeon. He pioneered the hip replacement opearation which is now one of the most common operations both in UK and elsewhere in the world, and created the \" Wrightington centre for surgery\".",
