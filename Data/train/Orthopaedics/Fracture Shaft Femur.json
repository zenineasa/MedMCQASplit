        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Fat embolism o Fat embolism means circulation of fat globule away from its site of origin,o When fat embolism causes symptoms it is called fat embolism syndrome,o Causes of fat embolism1. Fracture of long bone (most common) - Blunt trauma2. Soft tissue trauma3. Bums4. Parenteral lipid infusion5. Sickle cell crisis6. Recent Corticosteroid adn7. Acute pancreatitis8. D.M.9. Liposuction10. Decompression sicknesso Fracture s of bone is the most common cause of fat embolism.o Amongst the long bones, femur fracture is associated with fat embolism most commonly.o Multiple fractures increase the risk of fat embolism.Clinical manifestations of fat embolismo Clinical features are evident within 1-3 days. About 25 percent of patients develop symptoms within 12 hours and 75 percent within 36 hours. Occasionally the onset may be delayed for several days and some patients may go unnoticed initially. Early warning signs are a slight rise in temperature (pyrexia) and tachycardia.o The classical triad of fat embolism syndrome isRespiratory symptoms : Dyspnea, tachypnea, cyanosis, ARDS, low PO2.Neurological symptoms : Confusion, disorientation, restlessness, irritation, delirium, convulsion, coma.Petechial rash : In axilla, neck, periumblical area, conjunctiva of lower lid, retina, front & beck of chest, shoulder.",

Introduced in 1909 by Martin Kirschner. the wires are now widely used in orthopaedics and other types of medical and veterinary surgery .They come in different sizes and are used to hold bone fragments together (pin fixation) or to provide an anchor for skeletal traction.The pins are often driven into the bone through the skin (percutaneous pin fixation) using a power or hand drill.Smith-Petersen Nail is a tri flanged nail for internal fixation of a fracture of the neck of the femur or in trochanteric fracture in combination with a plate.It is rarely used at present.",
