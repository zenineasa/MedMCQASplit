        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Fat embolism o Fat embolism means circulation of fat globule away from its site of origin, o When fat embolism causes symptoms it is called fat embolism syndrome, o Causes of fat embolism1. Fracture of long bone (most common) - Blunt trauma2. Soft tissue trauma3. Bums4. Parenteral lipid infusion5. Sickle cell crisis6. Recent Corticosteroid adn7. Acute pancreatitis8. D. M. 9. Liposuction10. Decompression sicknesso Fracture s of bone is the most common cause of fat embolism. o Amongst the long bones, femur fracture is associated with fat embolism most commonly. o Multiple fractures increase the risk of fat embolism. Clinical manifestations of fat embolismo Clinical features are evident within 1-3 days. About 25 percent of patients develop symptoms within 12 hours and 75 percent within 36 hours. Occasionally the onset may be delayed for several days and some patients may go unnoticed initially. Early warning signs are a slight rise in temperature (pyrexia) and tachycardia. o The classical triad of fat embolism syndrome is. Respiratory symptoms: Dyspnea, tachypnea, cyanosis, ARDS, low PO2. Neurological symptoms: Confusion, disorientation, restlessness, irritation, delirium, convulsion, coma. Petechial rash: In axilla, neck, periumblical area, conjunctiva of lower lid, retina, front & beck of chest, shoulder.",

        "question": "In fracture shaft of femur, which nail is commonly used for ORIF?",
        "exp": "Ans: A (Kuntscher nail) Ref: \" Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics - Intramedullary Nailing of Femoral Shaft Fractures Duke Orthopaedics. & Watson-Jones Fractures and Joint Injuries, 7th edition. Explanation: Kiintscher nail is an internal fixation device used to maintain the position of the fracture fragments during healing. The nail is rigid, having an open slot along its length and has a cloverleaf shape in cross- section. It was used in the fixation of diaphyseal fractures in long bones like femur and humerus. It has been more or less supplanted by the locked intramedullary nails which are the standard today. Austin Moore pins are fixation pins used to fix fractures of the neck of femur. It is a smooth pin which has two nuts at its end to prevent migration into the joint. K-wires or Kirschner wires are sterilized, sharpened, smooth stainless steel pins. Introduced in 1909 by Martin Kirschner. the wires are now widely used in orthopaedics and other types of medical and veterinary surgery. They come in different sizes and are used to hold bone fragments together (pin fixation) or to provide an anchor for skeletal traction. The pins are often driven into the bone through the skin (percutaneous pin fixation) using a power or hand drill. Smith-Petersen Nail is a tri flanged nail for internal fixation of a fracture of the neck of the femur or in trochanteric fracture in combination with a plate. It is rarely used at present.",
