        "exp": "Ans. a. In all cases of open wound with clinical signs of nerve injury, nerve exploration should always be done (Ref: Schwartz 9/e p1532; Bailey 25/e p355; Apley's 9/e p274). Indications of Exploration in Nerve Injuries: (Apley's 9/e p274). Nerve was seen to be divided and needs to be repaired, i. e., open injury. If the ty pe of injury (example a knife wound or high energy injury) suggest that the nerve has been divided or severely damaged. If recovery is inappropriately delayed and diagnosis is in doubt. Positive Tinel's sign tells about the regeneration of the nerve (does not indicates the accurate location of lesion). Traction nerve injury are usually neuropraxia (managed conservatively, should not be repaired immediately). Nerve Injury. Neuropraxia. Axonotemesis. Neurotemesis* Reversible physiological nerve conduction blockQ* Seen in crutch patsy, tourniquet palsy, and Saturday night palsyQ* Loss of conduction due to axonal interruptionQ but the nerve is in continuity and the neural tubes are intact* Seen in closed fractures and dislocations* There is complete division of nerveQ (epineurium, perineurium, endoneurium and axon all lost their continuity)* Seen in open wounds. Nerve RepairA clean cut nerve is best repaired as soon as this can be done safelyQ. The higher (proximal) the lesion, the worse the prognosisQ. Pure motor or pure sensory nerves recover better than mixed, because there is less chances of axonal confusion. Tinel's sign indicate regeneration of nerveQ. Rate of regeneration of nerve is 1 mm/dayQ. Prognosis after Nerve Suturing. Radial nerve (best)Q >Median nerve >Ulnar nerve >Peroneal nerve >Sciatic and femoral nerve (worst prognosis)Q",
