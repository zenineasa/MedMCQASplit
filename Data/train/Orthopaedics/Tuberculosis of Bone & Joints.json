        "question": "Commonest site of bone and joint tuberculosis?",
        "exp": "Ans. a (Spine) (Ref. Harrison's medicine 17th ed., Ch. 158). Skeletal tuberculosis is more common in children. It is due to haematogenous spread from a primary site, usually the lungs. The spine is the most common site of infection and is present in over 50% of children. This is followed by the large joints of the lower extremity like the hip and knee. In skeletal tuberculosis single joint involvement is the most common pattern. The radiographic features of tuberculous arthritis are periarticular osteoporosis and soft-tissue swelling with destruction of the articular cartilage. Joint space narrowing is relatively late. Fibrous ankylosis is more common than bony ankylosis. Reactive new bone formation is minimal or absent. Tuberculous dactylitis involves the short tubular bones of the hands and feet with bony expansion (spina ventosa), increased bone density with periosteal reaction and soft-tissue swelling. SKELETAL TUBERCULOSIS# In bone and joint tuberculosis, pathogenesis is related to reactivation of hematogenous foci or to spread from adjacent paravertebral lymph nodes.# Weight-bearing joints are most commonly affected -- the spine in 40% of cases, - the hips in 13%, and- the knees in 10%# Spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease or tuberculous spondylitis) often involves two or more adjacent vertebral bodies.# From the anterior superior or inferior angle of the vertebral body, the lesion slowly reaches the adjacent body, later affecting the intervertebral disk.# With advanced disease, collapse of vertebral bodies results in kyphosis (gibbus).# A paravertebral \"cold'' abscess may also form.# MRI reveals the characteristic lesion and suggests its etiology.# Pyogenic bacterial osteomyelitis, in particular, involves the disk very early and produces rapid sclerosis.# A catastrophic complication of Pott's disease is paraplegia.# Skeletal tuberculosis responds to chemotherapy, but severe cases may require surgery.

        "question": "Both bone and disc spaces are involved in which spine disease -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Tuberculosis Pathology of tuberculosis of spine:* Like tuberculosis of the bones and joints elsewhere in the body, TB of the spine is always secondary. The bacteria reach the spine via the haematogenous route, from the lungs or lymph nodes. It spreads via the paravertebral plexus of veins i. e., Batson's plexus, which has free communication with the visceral plexus of the abdomen, a common site of tuberculosis. Types of vertebral tuberculosis:* Lesions in the vertebrae may be of the following types: a) Paradiscal: This is the commonest type. In this, the contiguous areas of two adjacent vertebrae along with the intervening disc are affected. b) Central: In this type, the body of a single vertebra is affected. This leads to early collapse of the weakened vertebra. The nearby disc may be normal. The collapse may be a 'wedging' or concertina' collapse; wedging being commoner. c) Anterior: In this type, infection is localised to the anterior part of the vertebral body. The infection spreads up and down under the anterior longitudinal ligament. d) Posterior: In this type, the posterior complex of the vertebra i. e., the pedicle, lamina, spinous process and transverse process are affected. Pathology:* In the commoner paradiscal type, bacteria lodge in the contiguous areas of two adjacent vertebrae.* Granulomatous inflammation results in erosion of the margins of these vertebrae.* Nutrition of the intervening disc, which comes from the end-plates of the adjacent vertebrae is compromised. This results in disc degeneration, and as the process continues, complete destruction. Thus both bone and disc spaces are involved in tuberculosis of spine.* Weakening of the trabeculae of the vertebral body results in collapse of the vertebra.* Type of collapse is generally a wedging, occurs early, and is severe in lesions of the dorsal spine. This is because, in the dorsal spine the line of weight bearing passes anterior to the vertebra, so that the anterior part of the weakened vertebra is more compressed than the posterior, resulting in wedging.* In the cervical and lumbar spines, because of their lordotic curvature (round forwards), wedging is less. Destruction occurs early, and is severe in children.",

MRI readily demonstrates involvement of the vertebral bodies, disk destruction, cold abscess, vertebral collapse, and spinal deformities. In the early stages, however, only disk degeneration with alteration of bone marrow signal intensity of vertebra is seen, which may not be sufficiently diagnostic of spinal tuberculosis Abscess formation and collection and expansion of granulation tissue adjacent to the vertebral body is highly suggestive of spinal tuberculosis. MRI is also useful in detecting intramedullary or extramedullarytuberculoma, spinal cord cavitation, spinal cord edema, and possibly unsuspected noncontiguous lesions of the spine.

        "exp": "(Spine): Ref: 387-A* The spine is the most common site of skeletal tuberculosis and the most dangerous* Blood borne infection usually settles in a vertebral body adjacent to the intervertebral disc. Bone destruction and caseation follows, with infection spreading to the disc spaces and to the adjacent vertebrae. As the vertebral bodies collapse into each other, a sharp angulation (or kyphos) develops. Caseation and cold abscess formation may extend to neighbouring vertebrae or escape into the paravertebral soft tissues. There is a major risk of cord damage due to pressure by the abscess or displaced bone or ischaemia from spinal artery thrombosis.",
