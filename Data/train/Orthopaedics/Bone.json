Thompson, Jennifer Hart page 308The two most common sites in the body are the olecranon and prepatellar bursae.\"There are 13 bursas around the knee. The prepatellar bursa is located between the skin and the patella and is the most common site of septic and aseptic bursitis\"Most cases are caused by Staphylococcus aureus; the Gram stain is positive in two-thirds.Bursitis in Knee Region:I. Prepatellar bursitis (\"housemaid's knee\") is usually a friction bursitis caused by friction between the skin and the patella. If the inflammation is chronic, the bursa becomes distended with fluid and forms a swelling anterior to the knee. Kneeling on a hard surface for prolonged periods of time is the most common cause of prepatellar bursitis of the knee, which is how it became known as housemaid's knee.II. Subcutaneous infrapatellar bursitis results from excessive friction between the skin and the tibial tuberosity; the edema occurs over the proximal end of the tibia.III. Deep infrapatellar bursitis results in edema between the patellar ligament and the tibia, superior to the tibial tuberosity.IV. Suprapatellar bursitis: The suprapatellar bursa communicates with the articular cavity of the knee joint; consequently, abrasions or penetrating wounds (e.g., a stab wound) superior to the patella may result in suprapatellar bursitis caused by bacteria entering the bursa from the torn skin. The infection may spread to the knee joint.",

Tetracycline labeling is used to determine the amount of bone growth within a certain period of time (approx. 21-day period).b. Osteoid is new bone that has been laid down by the osteoblasts and is non-mineralized.c. Usually tetracycline is given for several days in a row at 2 time points with a 10-day gap in between the dosing periods.d. It is recommended that the biopsy not be taken until at least 3-5 days after the last label.e. The label is incorporated into the mineralized bone and fluoresce under UV light microscopy.f. The bone must be processed mineralized in order to view the labels. Decalcification of the bone removes the labels.g. The quantitative interpretation of the bone histology, quantification of the various features, and bone dynamics with this method increases its sensitivity and aid in comparison of biopsy sample.h. If interested more in the measuring of osteoid, then staining the sections with Sanderson's Rapid Bone Stain (RBS) or McNeal's Tetrachrome is recommended.
