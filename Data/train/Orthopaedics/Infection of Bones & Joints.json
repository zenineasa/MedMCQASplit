Chronic osteomyelitis secondary to acute osteomyelitis# Key radiological feature is Sequestrum ( a feature of chronic osteomyelitis) which appears denser than surrounding normal bone because decalcification which occurs in normal bones does not occur here. The granulation tissue surrounding the sequestrum gives rise to a radiolucent zone around it. A sequestrum may be visible in soft-tissues.# Involucrum is the dense sclerotic bone overlying a sequestrum. There may be some holes in involucrum for the pus to drain out and these holes are called cloacae. The bony cavities are lined by infected granulation tissue.

The baby is irritable and refuses to feed; there is a rapid pulse and sometimes a fever.Infection is often suspected, but it could be anywhere!The joints should be carefully felt and moved to elicit the local signs of warmth, tenderness and resistance to movement. The umbilical cord should be examined for a source of infection. An inflamed intravenous infusion site should alwaysexcite suspicion.Baby's chest, spine and abdomen should be carefully examined to exclude other sites of infection.Tom Smith Arthritis:Septic arthritis of hip in infancy.Results in complete destruction of cartilaginous femoral head.Presentation is a child in his preschool age with painless limp. Affected limb is shorter.X-ray shows complete absence of head & neck of femur.Septic Arthritis Pathology:A fibrin-rich exudate.Clotted exudate - a cast in the jointCartilage destruction: lysozymal enzymes dissolve the glycosaminoglycans of the articular cartilage.The femoral head + growth plate destructionOrganisms may vary in their ability to dissolve cartilage: staphylococcus is most damagingHaemophilus influenzae and Gonococcus are the least damaging.Other Options[?]Acute Gonococcal arthritis:Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the commonest cause of septic arthritis in adults.This condition should always be suspected in older age group & patient examined for other signs of genitourinary infections.[?]Smallpox arthritis:Young children with smallpox, virions reach the joints and bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa.Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions.Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail joints, and stubby fingers.Now-a-days smallpox arthritits is not seen, because of eradication of smallpox.[?]Chronic pyogenic arthritis:Pyogenic arthritis of the hip is usually seen in children under 2 years of age.The organism (usually a staphylococcus) reaches the joint either directly from a distant focus or by local spread from osteomyelitis of the femur.",

Consequently,appropriate preparation should be made before surgery.Sinus tracks can be injected with methylene blue 24 hoursbefore surgery to make them easier to locate and exciseTechnique:* Expose the infected area of bone, and excise all sinus tracts completely.* Incise the indurated periosteum, and elevate it 1.3 to2.5 cm on each side.* Use a drill to outline an oval cortical window at the appropriate site, and remove it with an osteotome.* Remove all sequestra, purulent material, and scarred and necrotic tissue. If sclerotic bone sealsoff a cavity within the medullary canal, open it into thecanal in both directions to allow blood vessels to growinto the cavity. Use a high-speed burr to debride necrotic or ischemic bone until the \"paprika sign\" (active punctate bleeding bone) is achieved, indicating healthy tissue.Tissue obtained at surgical debridement should be sentfor culture and pathology studies.* After removing all suspicious matter, carefully excise the overhanging edges of bone. Subsequent dead space can be filled with antibiotic PMMA beads. A soft tissue, a localmuscle flap, or a free tissue transfer can be performed atthe time of bead removal.* If there is nonunion with any bony instability, the bonemust be stabilized, preferably with an Ilizarov-type external frame.* If possible, close the skin loosely over drains and ensurethat no excessive skin tension is present.
