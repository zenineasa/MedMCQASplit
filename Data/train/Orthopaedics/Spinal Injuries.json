Scoliosis is the most common osseous defect associated with Neurofibromatosis. The spinal deformities of Neurofibromatosis are of two basic forms: Nondvstrophic. Dystrophic. Non-dystrophic deformities mimic idiopathic scoliosis. Dystrophic scoliosis, characteristically is a short-segment, sharply angulated curve with severe wedging of the vertebral bodies, severe rotation of the vertebrae, scalloping of the vertebral bodies, spindling of the transverse processes, foraminal enlargement, and rotation of the ribs 90 degrees in the antero-posterior direction that makes them appear abnormally thin.

        "exp": "Ans. is 4a' i. e., Stabilization of vertebral compression fracture o Vertebroplasty is an outpatient procedure for stabilizing compression fractures in the spine. o Bone cement is injected into back bones (vertebrae) that have cracked or broken, often because of osteoporosis. The cement hardens, stabilizing the fractures and supporting your spine. Vertebroplasty and kvphoplastvo Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are interventional radiologic procedures for the treatment of the intense pain refractory to medical management or bracing caused by vertebral compression fracture associated with osteoporosis, tumors, and trauma. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty involve intraosseous injection of acrylic cement- polymethyl methacrylate under local anesthesia and fluoroscopic guidance. Pain reduction or elimination is immediate, and the risk of complications is low. Neither vertebroplasty nor kyphoplasty are intended for the treatment of intervertebral disc disease or arthritis. Vertebroplasty may also be applied prophylactically to an at- risk vertebra between 2 other abnormal vertebrae. Vertebroplasty does not restore the height of the compressed vertebral body. A related procedure, kyphoplasty, is intended to restore lost height by inflating a balloon pump within and between the fracture fragments prior to the infusion of the cement. Both procedures result in similar relief of pain due to vertebral compression fractures. The risks of the procedure are low and include extravasation of cement into the epidural space causing myelopathy, or fatal pulmonary embolism from extension of cement into paraspinous veins. Indications for percutaneous vertebroplastyo Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures more than two weeks old in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine causing moderate to severe pain and unresponsive to conservative therapy, o Painful metastasis and multiple myeloma with or without adjuvant radiation or surgical therapy, o Painful vertebral hemangiomaso Vertebral osteonecrosis. o Reinforcement of a pathologically weak vertebral body before a surgical stabilization procedure. Contraindication for percutaneous vertebroplastyo Contraindications are: -Absolute. Osteoporotic vertebral fracture that is completely healed or is clearly responding to conservative management. Presence of untreated coagulopathy. Presence of discitis/osteomyelitis (septic or tubercular) or sepsis. Relative. Significant compromise of the spinal canal by retropulsed bone fragment or tumor.

Spinal shock' occurs when the spinal cord fails temporarily following injury. During this period the reflex arcs below the level of spinal cord injury are notfunctioning. Spinal shock is basically flaccid paralysis with loss of all spinal reflexes. There is loss ofautonomic, reflex, motor and sensory activity below the level of the cord lesion.* Signs of spinal shock include: i) Flaccid paralysisii) Loss of deep tendon and perianal reflexes* The return of reflex activity below the level of a spinal cord injury signifies the end of spinal shock.* An accurate assessment of neurological status cannot be completed until spinal shock resolves. The earliest indicator of resolution is the return of bulbocavernous reflex. The significance of spinal shock lies in thedetermination of whether a patient has sustained a complete Vs incomplete spinal cord injury. This cannot be* determined until spinal shock has ended. If there is total absence of sensory or motor function below the level ofinjury, after spinal shock has resolved, It indicates complete cord injury.

Stress FractureA stress or fatigue fracture is one occurring in the normal bone of a healthy patient, due to small repetitive stresses of two main types: bending and compression. Commonly occurs in athletes or new military recruits. QMarch fracture: Fatigue or stress fracture of metatarsals often encountered in military personnelQ. Sites affected: MC bones affected: Metatarsals >Fibula >Tibia. QClinical features: History of unaccustomed and repetitive activity or one of a strenuous physical exercise programme. A common sequence of events is: pain after exercise - pain during exercise -- pain without exercise. Affected site may be swollen or red. It is sometimes warm and usually tender; the callus may be palpable. 'Springing' the bone (attempting to bend it) is often painful. Imaging: X-Ray: Plain X-rays taken a few weeks later may show a small transverse defect in the cortex and/or localized periosteal new-bone formation.

Characteristically, a Jefferson fracture is identified by a bilateral offset of the lateral masses of Cl relative to C2 on the frontal projection. The axis--C2# Hangman's fracture (traumatic spondylolysis of the axis) represents of the neural arch of C2 that are produced by a hyperextension force such as that commonly experienced when the head or face hits the windshield or steering wheel.

Type 3 is a fracture, not of the dens, but of the superior portion of the axis body with extension through one or both of its superior articular facets.

Calcaneal fractures are more frequent than any other fracture of the tarsal bones and comprise 1% to 2% of all fractures. These fractures, which are often bilateral, are likely to occur when a person falls from a height and lands on the heels.
