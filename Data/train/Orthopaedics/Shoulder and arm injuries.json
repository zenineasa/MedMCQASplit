The examiner then lifts the patient&;s hand off the back and the patient is told to hold it there. Inability to do this signifies subscapularis weakness,possibly due to rupture. A drawback is that the test calls for full passive internal rotation,so it cannot be used if internal rotation is painful or restricted. Ref: Maheshwari and Mhaskar 6e pg 95",

The cause of fibrosis is not known, but it is possibly a result of ischaemic necrosis of the sterno-mastoid muscle at bih. Evidence in our of this theory is the presence of a lump in the sterno-mastoid muscle in the first few weeks of life, probably a swollen ischaemic muscle. Ref: Maheshwari and Mhaskar 9th ed pg 321.",
