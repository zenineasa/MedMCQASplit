        "question": "Surgical staging of bone tumors is by",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e. Enneking The Enneking system for the surgical staging of bone and soft-tissue tumors is based on grade (G), site (T), and metastasis (M) and uses histologic, radiologic, and clinical criteria. It is the most widely used staging system and has been adopted by the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society and the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Grade. In the Enneking system, bone tumors are graded as follows: GO - Benign lesion. GI - Low-grade malignant lesion. G2 - High-grade malignant lesion. Surgical grade depends on histology, however; a higher surgical grade is applied if the radiographic features and clinical behavior of a lesion indicate an aggressive lesion that is incompatible with its benign histologic features. Site. In the Enneking system, the site and local extent of bone tumors are classified as follows: TO - A benign tumor that is confined within a true capsule and the lesion's anatomic compartment of origin (ie, a benign intracapsular, intra compartmental lesion). Tl- An aggressive benign or malignant tumor that is still confined within its anatomic compartment (ie, an intra-compartmental lesion)T2 - A lesion that has spread beyond its anatomic compartment of origin (ie, an extra compartmental lesion). Metastasis. Metastatic classification in the Enneking system is as follows: MO - No regional or distant metastasis Ml - Regional or distant metastasis. Staging: Malignant Tumors.

Staging: Benign. The Enneking staging system divides benign tumors into latent, active, or aggressive tumors. * Latent tumors are asymptomatic and are usually discovered incidentally. They reach a stage of non growth after a period of slow growth. Active tumors are mildly symptomatic and may be discovered if pathologic fracture occurs or if the tumor is associated with mechanical dysfunction. Active tumors usually grow steadily. Aggressive benign lesions grow rapidly and usually are symptomatic and tender on palpation. Enneking System for the Surgical Staging of Benign Lesions. Stage. Description. Grade. Site. Metastasis1.
