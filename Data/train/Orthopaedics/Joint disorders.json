AS most commonly involves young men between 15 and 30 years of age who are HLA-B27 positive (95% of cases). Approximately 20% of patients who are HLAB27 positive will develop AS or one of the other variants upon exposure to the environmental factors listed above. Characteristic features include an insidious onset of sacroiliitis, persistence for more than 3 months, and morning stiffness in the lower back that is relieved with exercise, as well as a diminished anterior flexion of the spine, which can be identified with the Schober test. The veebral column is eventually involved with subsequent fusion of the veebral column and production of the \"bamboo spine. \" Complications include (1) restricted chest movement with development of a restrictive type of lung disease; (2) iridocyclitis, with a potential for visual loss; and (3) aoic valve incompetence with regurgitation in a small percentage of cases.

JRA is characterized by a chronic synol inflammation of unknown origin; it most commonly affects the knees, but can also manifest in wrists, ankles, and the atlantoaxial joint in the neck. In general, JRA is more common in girls than boys, but this varies with the type of JRA, which can be divided into the following variant subsets: Still disease (20%), polyaicular (40%), and pauciaicular (40%). Still, the disease most closely resembles an infectious disease, with spiking fever, a centripetal rash, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, transient ahralgias and ahritis, and effusions (pericardial and plural). The polyaicular variant is associated with destructive ahritis, paicularly if the patient tests positive for the rheumatoid factor. The pauciaicular variant features polyahritis and inflammation of the anterior uveal tract 10%-50%), which predisposes the patient to visual loss and blindness. In most cases of JRA, with the Exception of the polyaicular variant, the rheumatoid factor is negative. Anemia and leukocytosis are noted in acute attacks. Aspirin is the major anti-inflammatory agent that is used for treatment. Regarding the other choices in the question: rheumatic fever features polyahritis, but it is not destructive Lyme disease displays many of these findings, but blindness is not a key feature Henoch-Schoenlein vasculitis has palpable purpura, non-disabling ahritis, but is not associated with blindness dermatomyositis does not usually involve the joints Ref: Maheshwari 9.
