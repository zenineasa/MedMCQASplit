The direction of osteotomy is medially upwards, beginning at the base of the greater trochanter & ending just above the lesser trochanter. Once osteotomy is made, the distal fragment is displaced medially & is abducted. The position is held by an external suppo( hip spica) or by internal fixation with plate& screws. The osteotomy conves the shearing stresses at the fracture site into compressive forces, thus enhancing fracture union. The line of weight bearing after osteotomy passes from the head to distal fragment. It, therefore, bypasses fracture site. By this osteotomy the head is suppoed by the distal fragment ( armchair effect) This helps the limb in taking weight on walking. T his operation is rarely done nowadays.
