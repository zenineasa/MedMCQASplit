        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Anterior shoulder dislocation Bankart's lesion* When the labrum of the shoulder joint is torn, the stability of the shoulder joint is compromized.* A Specific type of labral tear is called a Bankart's lesion.* A Bankart's lesion occurs when an individual sustains an anterior dislocation. As the shoulder pops out of the joint, it often causes tear of the labrum and stripping of periosteum from anterior surface (more specifically antero- inferior) of glenoid.* In severe injuries, there may be avulsion of piece of bone from anteroinferior glenoid rim, called bony Bankart lesion.",

The acromiohumeral interval is measured to assess inferior glenohumeral laxity. Rotator Interval Test. While performing the sulcus test, externally rotate the arm. Healthy patients will have a reduction of inferior translation. No reduction in acromiohumeral interval is suspicious for rotator interval capsular deficiency. Jerk Test. Start with the arm forward-flexed and adducted. Posterior-directed force will cause posterior translation in posterior instability. Moving the arm into the coronal plane may reduce the humeral head.",

Erb's paralysis- Erb's palsy or Erb-Duchenne palsy is a paralysis of the arm caused by injury to the upper group of the arm's main nerves, specifically the severing of the upper trunk C5-C6 nerves. Position of hand in Erb's paralysis: Adducted, Internally rotated, and pronated. Klumpke's paralysis. Klumpke's Palsy involves the eighth cervical vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra (C8 and Tl). Position of hand: Elbow flexed, arm supinated. There may be unilateral homer syndrome. Horner syndrome. Seen with Pancoast tumor and presents with Ptosis, Miosis, enopthalmos, anhydrosis, loss of ciliospinal reflex. Central cord syndrome. Seen most often after a hyperextension injury in an individual with long-standing cervical spondylosis. It presents with features of cortico-spinal pathway.",
