AS is a form of spondyloarthritis, a chronic, inflammatory arthritis where immune mechanisms are thought to have a key role. It mainly affects joints in the spine and the sacroiliac joint in the pelvis, and can cause eventual fusion of the spine.> The typical patient is a young male, aged 20-40; however, the condition also presents in females.> The condition is known to be hereditary. Symptoms of the disease first appear, on average, at age 23 years.

In normal two-legged stance the body's centre of gravity is placed midway between the two feet. Normally, in one-legged stance, the pelvis is pulled up on the unsuppoed side and the centre of gravity is placed directly over the standing foot. If the weightbearing hip is unstable, the pelvis drops on the unsuppoed side; to avoid falling, the person has to throw his body towards the loaded side so that the centre of gravity is again over that foot. If the difference between the two hips is marked you can detect it by simply looking at the patient's stance. However, small differences are not so obvious. In the classical Trendelenburg test the examiner stands behind the patient and looks at the buttockfolds. Normally in one-legged stance the buttock on the opposite side rises as the person lifts that leg; in a positive (abnormal) test the opposite buttock-fold. The causes of a positive Trendelenburg sign are: (1) pain on weightbearing; (2) weakness of the hip ABDUCTORS. (3) shoening of the femoral neck; and (4) dislocation or subluxation of the hip.
