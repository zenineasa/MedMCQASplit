Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins 2003, Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics. Tillaux Fracture: Salter-Harris III fracture invoking avulsion of anterolateral tibial epiphysis; occurs in older adolescents, after the middle and medial parts of epiphyseal plate has closed, but before the lateral part closes (usually 12 to 15 yrs of age); Because, this fracture occurs in adolescents with relatively mature growth plates, there is minimal potential for deformity due to growth plate injury. Mechanism of Injury: External rotation force with stress placed on anterior tibiofibular ligament, causing avulsion of distal tibial epiphyseal plate anterolaterally; Further lateral rotation causes displacement of fracture; Fracture occurs after medial part of the epiphyseal plate has closed, but before the lateral part closes; Radiographs: AP and Oblique views are needed to distinguish from a triplane fracture. Note that the common triplane fracture will contain a tillaux fracture in addition to the tibial physeal fracture.",
