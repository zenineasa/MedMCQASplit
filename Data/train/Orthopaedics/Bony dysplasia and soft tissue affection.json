        "exp": "Rotator cuff impingement syndrome is a painful disorder which is thought to arise from repetitive compression or rubbing of the tendons (mainly supraspinatus) under the coracoacromial arch. Normally, when the arm is abducted, the conjoint tendon slides under the coracoacromial arch. As abduction approaches 90 degrees, there is a natural tendency to externally rotate the arm, thus allowing the rotator cuff to occupy the widest pa of the subacromial space. If the arm is held persistently in abduction and then moved to and fro in internal and external rotation (as in cleaning a window, painting a wall or polishing a flat surface) the rotator cuff may be compressed and irritated as it comes in contact with the anterior edge of the acromion process and the taut coracoacromial ligament. This attitude (abduction, slight flexion and internal rotation) has been called the 'impingement position'. Perhaps significantly, the site of impingement is also the 'critical area' of diminished vascularity in the supraspinatus tendon about 1 cm proximal to its inseion into the greater tuberosity.

It creates an irregular, sharply demarcated radiolucent defect in the metaphyseal coex. It is a frequent cause of a pathologic fracture. The defect characteristically presents with nocturnal pain in the legs. Fibrous dysplasia refers to a benign, non-neoplastic process of bone (ribs and femur) in which bone is replaced by fibroconnective tissue (woven bone). It may be involved in a single bone (monostotic) or many bones (polyostotic), the latter often associated with Albright's syndrome. This syndrome consists of abnormal skin pigmentation (cafae au lait spots), polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, and precocious sexual development, usually in females. Fibrous dysplasia is not associated with nocturnal pain. An aneurysmal bone cyst is a benign condition (most commonly seen in children) that characteristically causes enlargement of the bone. The femur and the veebra are most commonly involved. The cyst is composed of hemorrhagic spaces and reactive-appearing giant cells. On x-ray, it appears as a multicystic, radiolucent lesion. It is not associated with nocturnal bone pain. Enchondromas (chondromas) are benign, generally asymptomatic, solitary or multiple cailaginous tumors that result from a failure of normal endochondral ossification below the growth plate. They develop within the medullary cavity of the bone. The risk for transformation into a chondrosarcoma is greatest when multiple lesions are present. OIlier's disease refers to multiple enchondromas that most frequently involve the bones of the hands and feet. There is no association with nocturnal pain or pathologic fractures. An osteoma is a solitary benign tumor usually confined to the skull and facial bones, which may be associated with Gardner's hereditary polyposis syndrome.

Clinical features, Any digit may be affected, but the thumb, ring and middle fingers most commonly; sometimes several fingers are affected. The patient notices a click as the finger is flexed; when the hand is unclenched, the affected finger initially remains bent at the PIP joint but with fuher effo it suddenly straightens with a snap. A tender nodule can be felt in front of the MCP joint and the click may be reproduced at this site by alternately flexing and extending the finger.

Normally palmar aponeurosis is thin but tough membrane lying Immediately beneath the skin of the palm. Proximally it is in continuation with palmaris longus tendon. Distally it divides into slips one for each finger. The slip bends with the fibrous flexor sheaths covering the flexor tendon of the finger, and extends upto the middle phalanx. In Dupuytren&; s contracture aponeurosis or a pa of it becomes thickened and slowly contracts, drawing the fingers into flexion at the metacarpo-phalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints.
