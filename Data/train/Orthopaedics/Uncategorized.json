In case one of the trochanters has moved proximally the lines will converge on that side. Perkin's line: When the congenital Dislocation of hip is mild in nature, the perkins lines are drawn to detect it. A horizontal line is drawn through the triradiate cartilage and a vertical line is drawn down from the outer edge of the acetabulum on both sides.

        "exp": "Some of the guides have given option (MRI scan) as the answer by stating that this is a case of Perthe's disease. I do not agree with them. Two most common causes of limp in a child between 4-10 years are:- Transient synovitis of hip Perthe's disease The child in question has painful limp, tenderness in the femoral triangle and limitation of hip movement with normal X-ray. All of these can occur in both transient synovitis of hip and early stage of perthe's disease. However, the most favourable diagnosis here is transient synovitis because:- Transient synovitis of hip is the most common cause of painful limp in a child between 4-10 years. X-rays of transient synovitis are typically normal; however they may reveal subtle changes (widening of joint space). On the other hand x-rays are normal only in the initial stage of Perthe's; most of the time when patients present, the x-ray changes are there. Child with perthe's disease may present with painful limp, but maximum patients present when pain has subsided and only limp is there, i. e. painless limp (in chronic stage). Therefore, most probable diagnosis here is transient synovitis and management includes observation, bed rest and NSAIDs. And this is the protocol, which is followed in most of the hospitals. In a suspected case of transient synovitis, we give conservative treatment, i. e. bed rest, NSAIDs and observation. If the child does not improve in 3-5 days, then we think of further investigation. So, according to me option 'a' is the best answer here. You can choose your answer according to your thought process.",

The osteotomy converts the shearing stresses at the fracture site into compressive forces, thus enhancing fracture union. The line of weight bearing after osteotomy passes from the head to the distal fragment. It, therefore, bypasses fracture site. By this osteotomy the head is supported by the distal fragment ( armchair effect) This helps the limb in taking weight on walking. This operation is rarely done nowadays.",

        "exp": "Increased bone density Increased bone density refers to that part of the bone or whole bone appears more dense on x-ray. While an increase in bone density occurs less frequently, many examples are seen in which this is used as an aid in radiographic diagnosis. The increase in bone density can occur by several different mechanisms and be the result of different insult to the bone. Most commonly, the increase in density occurs within the trabecular bone (spongy bone / cancellous bone) following:- Thickening of trabeculae Increased number of trabeculae Increased in the density within the cortical bone occurs uncommonly because normally the bone is so compact that no space exists that permits the addition of more bone tissue. However, It is possible for cortex to become thicker as a result of the addition ofperiosteal or endosteal new bone when it is actually a reactive change. This is considered as increased bone density by some people. Actually it is not true increase in bone density but increase in the thickness, i. e. density of cortical bone remains the same but thickness increases. So, pathogenic mechanism of increased bone density may be:- Increased density of cancellous bone either due to thickening of trabeculae or increased number of trabeculae. Thickening and expansion of cortex due to periosteal reaction or endosteal reaction. Important causes of increased density are:- Generalized increased in bone density Renal osteodystrophy o Hypercalcemia & Hypervitaminosis D Flourosis o Hyperphosphatasia Mastocytosis o Hodgkin disease Myelosclerosis o Heavy metal poisoning (Lead) Sclerotic metastasis o Infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey disease) Myeloid metaplasia o Melorheostosis (Leri disease) Osteopertrosis (Marble bone disease) o Hyperparathyroidm (Secondary) Gaucher disease o Hypoparathyrodism Healing phase of rickets o Osteopetrosis Localized increased in bone density Avascular necrosis o Heavy metal poisoning (lead) Bone infarct o Mastocytosis Callus formation o Melorheostosis Exostosis o Osteoid osteoma Ewing sarcoma o Osteoblastoma Fibrous dysplasia o Osteoblastic metastasis Gardner syndrme o Osteomyelitis (sequestrum) Healed osteomyelitis o Paget's disease Eosinophilic granuloma Collapse of cancellous bone causes trabeculae to come together, therefore increased density.",

        "exp": "Management of open fracture Open fracture need immediate surgery to clean the area of the injury. Because of the break in the skin, debris and infection can travel to the fracture location, and lead to a high rate of infection in the bone. Once an infection is established, it can be a difficult problem to solve. Treatment of established bone infections often requires multiple surgeries, prolonged antibiotic treatment and long-term problems. Therefore, every effort is made to prevent this potential problem with early surgery. All open fractures, no matter how trivial they are must be assumed to be contaminated. The four essential principles of treatment for management of open fractures are: - Antibiotic prophylaxis Urgent wound and fracture debridement. Stabilization of fracture (fracture fixation) Early definitive wound cover \u200bDebridement Patient is taken immediately to surgery and debridement is done by removal of contaminated and devitalized tissue, copious irrigation by sterile solution (usually saline). As a general rule it is best to leave cut nerves and tendons alone, though if the wound is absolutely clean and no dissection is require, and provided the necessary expertise is available, they can be sutured. Wound closure A small, uncontaminated wound in a Grade I or II fracture may (after debridement) be sutured, provided this can be done without tension. In the more severe grades of injury, immediate fracture stabilization and wound cover using split-skin grafts, local or distant flaps is ideal, provided both orthopaedic and plastic surgeons are satisfied that a clean, viable wound has been achieved after debridement. In the absence of this combined approach at the time of debridement, the fracture is stabilized and the wound is left open and dressed with impervious dressing. Return to surgery for a 'second look' should have definitive fracture cover as an objective. It should be done by 48-72 hours, and not later than 5 days. Stabilizing the fracture Stabilizing the fracture is important in reducing the likelihood of infection and assisting recovery of the soft tissues. The method of fixation depends on the degree of contamination, length of time from injury to operation and amount of soft tissue damage. If there is no obvious contamination and definitive wound cover can be achieved at the time of debridement, open fractures of all grades can be treated as for a closed injury. Internal fixation or external fixation depends on the individual characteristic of fracture. If wound is contaminated and clean wound cannot be obtained by debridement or if wound cover is delayed, then external fixation by a fixator is safer. Coming back to question Debridement, Internal fixation and external fixation all are used in the treatment of open fracture. For one answer go ahead with debridement because debridement is the most important step and is done in all open fractures. On the other hand, whether to stabilize the fracture either by internal fixation or external fixation, depends upon specific situations.",

The principle of the test: Normally when one leg is raised from the ground the pelvis tilts upwards on that side, through the action of the hip abductors of the standing limb. If the abductors are inefficient they are unable to sustain the pelvis against the body weight and it tilts downwards instead of rising up on the side of the lifted leg. Note that the test is performed with the patients standing on the affected leg. Abductor mechanism: It can be compared with the lever, with the body weight is trying to tilt the pelvis down; the hip joint being the fulcrum and the abductor muscles being the power acting through the lever arm (from the head of the femur to attachment of the abductor's muscles on the greater trochanter - the neck of the femur) Causes of the positive Trendelenburg test: Any failure of the abductor mechanism causes dipping of the pelvic (ASIS) on the normal side. There are three fundamental causes: 1) Paralysis of the abductor's muscles eg. Polio. Paralysis of superior gluteral nerve (Supplies gluteus medius & minimus) 2) Marked approximation of the insertion of the abductor muscles to their origin by upward displacement of the greater trochanter; so that the muscles are slack. eg.

And you should also keep in mind that there is stripping of glenoid labrum and periosteum both: -\"Bankart's lesion is labour-periosteal stripping from anteroinferior part of glenoid\".

It is due to action of muscle and geometry of articular surfaces of the knee. However some pathology of knee joint can cause locking of the knee, i. e., the knee is locked in partial flexion and there is inability to extend the knee for the last few degrees. This is frequently known as locking of the knee joint. Locking occurs because the fragments (bone or cartilage) get nipped between the condyles of tibia and femur and do not allow the extension: Knee is held in flexion. Causes of locking are: - Meniscal tear Osteochondral fracture Loose body in the knee Osteophytes fracture in osteoarthritis Fractures tibial spine fragment Hamstring spasm also does not allow the knee to get extended.

This also includes pertrochantric, and transtrochantric fractures. \"The term trochanteric fracture may be used to describe any fracture in the region that lies between the greater and lesser trochanter. It is unnecessary to retain such terms as intertrochanteric and pertrochantric, which only lead to confusion\". -Adam's Thus; trochanteric, intertrochantric, pertrochantric and transtrochantric fractures; all are same. Now coming to question As already mentioned previously, both intertrochanteric (Pertrochantric / transtrochantric / trochantric) fracture and basal fracture are extrapsular, and have same treatment. These fractures are more likely to be fixed with screw and plate (Dynamic hip screw). Fracture of the transcervical and subcapital region of the femur can cause diruption to the blood supply to the head of the femur and are, therefore, more likely to require a hemiarthroplasty which involves the replacement of the head of femur with a metal prosthesis. ______ Handbook of orthopaedics",

Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita is a rare congenital disorder that is characterized by multiple joint contractures and muscle atrophy and fibrosis. It is a non-progressive disease. CTEV can be seen as one of the components of AMC. So AMC can also be the answer but since it's much rarer than CTEV and in the question, other joints involvement is not mentioned, the answer would be `CTEV'. Congenital vertical talus is a rare disease usually affecting both feet, characterized by rigid flatfoot deformity, with the plantar aspect of the foot having a convex contour. The heel is in valgus, and the forefoot is abducted and dorsiflexed. In the newborn having this condition, the dorsal aspect of the foot may be in close approximation to the distal aspect of the tibia. Flat foot or Pes planus is a condition characterized by varying degrees of loss of the longitudinal arch of the foot. This condition can be normal which usually disappears as the child grows, or can be pathological as seen in Congenital vertical talus, tarsal coalition, inflammatory joint disorder or a neurological disorder.",

Management of fracture The principles in fracture management are: - 1). Reduction In displaced fractures, fracture site is reduced to proper alignment first. Reduction may be: - A) Closed: - Without opening the fracture site. This can be done by: - Closed manipulation of fracture site. Continuous traction to counteract the forces which prevent reduction. B) Open: - Fracture site is opened and then the fracture is reduced. 2) Immobilization of fractured bone After reduction, immobilization is necessary to maintain the bones in reduced position. This may be dony by: - Plaster of paris (cast or slab) Using implant: - i) For long Bones Intramedullary nailing eg K nail, interlocking nail, Rush nail, reconstruction nail etc. Plating eg. DCP External fixator Dynamic hip screw (DHS) & Dynamic condylar screw CDCS Plaster cast ii) For short bones Screws K-wire Tension band wiring Here I would like to explain one fact, which may otherwise cause confusion: - Closed reduction does not mean that treatment is always non-operative (conservative). Closed reduction may be: - Conservative: - When reduction is done without opening of fracture site and the fracture site is immobilized without fixing by implant but by plaster or splints. Surgical: - When reduction is done without opening of fracture site and the fracture site is fixed by implants, e. g., by percutaneous K-wire or screw.
