Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty involve intraosseous injection of acrylic cement- polymethyl methacrylate under local anesthesia and fluoroscopic guidance. Pain reduction or elimination is immediate, and the risk of complications is low. Neither vertebroplasty nor kyphoplasty are intended for the treatment of intervertebral disc disease or arthritis. Vertebroplasty may also be applied prophylactically to an at-risk vertebra between 2 other abnormal vertebrae. Vertebroplasty does not restore the height of the compressed vertebral body. A related procedure, kyphoplasty, is intended to restore lost height by inflating a balloon pump within and between the fracture fragments prior to the infusion of the cement. Both procedures result in similar relief of pain due to vertebral compression fractures. The risks of the procedure are low and include extravasation of cement into the epidural space causing myelopathy, or fatal pulmonary embolism from extension of cement into paraspinous veins.",

Some sensory and motor improvements have been reported when methylprednisolone is administered within 8 hours after spinal cord injury. Methylprednisolone infused 8 hours or more after injury seemed to be of no benefit. The National Spinal Cord Injury Study (NASCIS) has conducted three trials I, II and III on early high dose steroids after spinal cord injury. Acute steroid therapy is believed to reduce the cellular damage resulting from secondary injury processes such as lipid peroxidation. Recommended protocol for acute spinal cord injury is: 30 mg/kg bolus within 8 hrs of injury followed by twenty three hours of infusion at 5. 4 mg/kg per hour. High dose of steroids has its associated side effects such as increased incidence of wound infection and gastrointestinal hemorrhage.

Green stick fractureo A greenstick fracture is an incomplete transverse fracture pattern seen in children. Greenstick fractures occur when an injuring force applied to a bone exceeds the limits of elasticity of the bone. This results in the bones bending to the point of bony disruption and fracture on the side opposite to the applied force. However, a green- stick fracture is an incomplete fracture, in which the compressed cortex and periosteum remain intact. Greenstick fractures of radius-ulna are common fractures in children and often result from a fall on a outstretched hands. Treatment of greenstick fractureo Greenstick fracture patterns are inherently more stable than a complete fracture after reduction, o As such, they are usually treated with cast immobilization in the appropriate corrective rotation with molding to maintain the interosseous space and a straight ulnar border, i. e. simple closed reduction by reversing the injury mechanism and cast immobilization is the treatment of choice, o The greater mechanical stability of greenstick fractures may result in greater difficulty of reduction wrhen required, o In the case of both-bone forearm fractures for example, a greenstick stick fracture of ulna is association with radius may act as a tether that not only contributes to deformity but may actually act as a block in reduction, o Several authors have advocated 'completion1' of the greenstick fracture to aid in the case of reduction and this approach is acceptable and appropriate when necessary for achieving anatomic reduction, o Completion of an incomplete green-stick fracture for treatment is a controversial issue. Some prefer this approach as reduction is maintained by breaking the other cortex. While other find it un-necessory and they just close reduce the fracture with immobilization.",

Here the traction is applied to the skin (using adhesive or nonadhesive tape or straps) which is indirectly- transmitted to the bone. Skin traction can sustain a pull of no more than 4 to 5 kgs. Skin traction is given by adhesive tape & bandage. Buck's appratus. Gallow's'Bryant. VRussel traction are examples of skin traction. B) Skeletal traction. Skeletal traction is an invasive procedure in which pins, screws, wires or tongs (e. g., Seinmann pin, Denham 'spin, Kirschner's wire, ice tong, Crutchfield's tong, Bohler stirrup, Ilizarov's wire) are placed into the bones so that the weight is directly applied to the bone.

This is done to correctfirst metatarsal drop in case of tibialisanterior muscle weakness. ii) Transfer of peronius tertious and brevismuscles (evertors of the foot) to thedorsum of the foot. The transfer isrequired in a foot with dorsiflexor weakness. Evertors can be spared for moreuseful function of dorsiflexion of the foot. iii) Hamstring (knee flexors) transfer to thequadriceps muscle to support a weak knee extensor.",

        "question": "Best management of open fracture is:",
        "exp": "Ans: A (Debridement) Ref: Campbell's Operative Orthopaedics, 11th edition. Explanation: Management of Open Fractures. Three components of open fracture management are: o Aggressive wound debridement. o Definitive fracture stabilization with internal or external fixation; and o Delayed wound closure. Of these wound debridement is the first and most important step to avoid infection. Tscherne Classification of Open Fracture Management into Four Eras: The era of life preservation / preantiseptic era: Until 20th century. The era of limb preservation: During World War I and World Warll. The era of infection avoidance: Until the mid-1960s when antibiotic came into use. The era of functional preservation: At present; management consists of aggressive wound debridement, definitive fracture stabilization with internal or external fixation, and delayed wound closure. Gustilo, Burgess, Tscherne and AO-ASIF group recommendations for open fractures: 1. Treat open fractures as emergencies. 2. Perform a thorough initial evaluation to diagnose life-threatening and limb-threatening injuries. 3. Begin appropriate antibiotic therapy in emergency department and continue treatment for 2 to 3 days only. 4. Immediately debride the wound of contaminated and devitalized tissue, copiously irrigate, and repeat debridement within 24 to 72 hours. 5. Stabilize the fracture with the method determined at initial evaluation. 6. Leave the wound open (Controversial). 7. Perform early autogenous cancellous bone grafting. 8. Rehabilitate the involved extremity aggressively. Modified Gustilo-Anderson Classification for Open Fractures. Type I open fractures: Clean wound less than 1 cm long. Type II open fractures: Laceration more than 1 cm long, no extensive soft-tissue damage, skin flaps or avulsions. Type IMA open fractures: Extensive soft-tissue lacerations or flaps, but maintain adequate soft-tissue coverage of bone, or they result from high-energy trauma regardless of the size of the wound. Includes segmental or severely comminuted fractures, even those with 1 cm lacerations. Type NIB open fractures: Extensive soft-tissue loss with periosteal stripping and bony exposure; usually massively contaminated. Type MIC open fractures: Open fractures with an arterial injury that requires repair regardless of the size of the soft-tissue wound.",
