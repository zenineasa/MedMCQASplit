Hg depending on the material used and patient tolerance. Negative pressure wound therapy:* Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a therapeutic technique using a vacuum dressing to promote healing in acute or chronic wounds and enhance healing of second and third degree burns.* The therapy involves the controlled application of sub-atmospheric pressure to the local wound environment, using a sealed wound dressing connected to a vacuum pump.* NPWT promotes wound healing by applying a vacuum through a special sealed dressing.* The continued vacuum draws out fluid from the wound and increases blood flow to the area and helps to develop good granulation tissue. The vacuum may be applied continuously or intermittently, depending on the type of wound being treated and the clinical objectives.* Typically, the dressing is changed two to three times per week.* The dressings used for the technique include open-cell foam dressings and gauze, sealed with an occlusive dressing intended to contain the vacuum at the wound site.* Where NPWT devices allow delivery of fluids, such as saline or antibiotics to irrigate the wound, intermittent removal of used fluid supports the cleaning and drainage of the wound bed.* General technique for NPWT is as follows: \"protect the periwound by applying a skin barrier then it should be followed by a transparent film/'a dressing or filler material is fitted to the contours of a wound (which is covered with a non-adherent dressing film) and the overlying foam is then sealed with a transparent film.* A drainage tube is connected to the dressing through an opening of the transparent film.* A vacuum tube is connected through an opening in the film drape to a canister on the side of a vacuum pumpor vacuumsource, turning an open wound into a controlled, closed woundwhile removing excess fluid from the wound bed to enhance circulation and remove wound fluids. This creates a moist healing environment and reduces edema.* \"There must be an air tight seal in order for this therapy to be successful. \"* The technique is usually used with chronic wounds or wounds that are expected to present difficulties while healing (such as those associated with diabetes).* Three types of filler material are used over the wound surface: open-cell foam, gauze and transparent film, or honeycombed textiles with a dimpled wound contact surface.* With all three techniques, once the dressing is sealed the vacuum pump can be set to deliver continuous or intermittent pressures, with levels of pressure depending on the device used, varying between -125 and -75 mm. Hg depending on the material used and patient tolerance. Pressure can be applied constantly or intermittently.* The dressing type used depends on the type of wound, clinical objectives and patient. For pain sensitive patients with shallow or irregular wounds, wounds with undermining or explored tracts or tunnels, gauze may be used, while foam may be cut easily to fit a patient's wound that has a regular contour and perform better when aggressive granulation formation and wound contraction is the desired goal.* Contraindications for NPWT Use: 1) Malignancy in the wound2) Untreated osteomyelitis3) Non enteric and unexplored fistulas4) Necrotic tissue with eschar present5) \"Do not place foam directly in contact with exposed blood vessels, anastomotic sites, organs and nerves. \"* There is now sufficient evidence to show that NPWT is safe, and will accelerate healing, to justify its use in the treatment of diabetes-associated chronic leg wounds.

Explanation: Consolidation is a stage in fracture healing which is different from union in that union is incomplete repair: the ensheathing callus is calcified. Clinically the fracture site is still a little tender and. though the bone moves in one piece (and in that sense is united), attempted angulation is painful. X-Rays show the fracture line still clearly visible, with fluffy callus around it. Repair is incomplete and it is not safe to subject the unprotected bone to stress. But consolidation is complete repair; the calcified callus is ossified. Clinically the fracture site is not tender, no movement can be obtained and attempted angulation is painless. X-rays show the fracture line to be almost obliterated and crossed by bone trabeculae, with well-defined callus around it. Repair is complete and further protection is unnecessary. Stability, better function and alignment are advantages conferred by the technique of open reduction and internal fixation in fractures that cannot be treated by close reduction (fracture neck of femur), are unstable and liable to cause functional derangement if treated by closed methods.",

Green stick fractureo A greenstick fracture is an incomplete transverse fracture pattern seen in children. Greenstick fractures occur when an injuring force applied to a bone exceeds the limits of elasticity of the bone. This results in the bones bending to the point of bony disruption and fracture on the side opposite to the applied force. However, a green- stick fracture is an incomplete fracture, in which the compressed cortex and periosteum remain intact. Greenstick fractures of radius-ulna are common fractures in children and often result from a fall on a outstretched hands. Treatment of greenstick fractureo Greenstick fracture patterns are inherently more stable than a complete fracture after reduction, o As such, they are usually treated with cast immobilization in the appropriate corrective rotation with molding to maintain the interosseous space and a straight ulnar border, i. e. simple closed reduction by reversing the injury mechanism and cast immobilization is the treatment of choice, o The greater mechanical stability of greenstick fractures may result in greater difficulty of reduction wrhen required, o In the case of both-bone forearm fractures for example, a greenstick stick fracture of ulna is association with radius may act as a tether that not only contributes to deformity but may actually act as a block in reduction, o Several authors have advocated 'completion1' of the greenstick fracture to aid in the case of reduction and this approach is acceptable and appropriate when necessary for achieving anatomic reduction, o Completion of an incomplete green-stick fracture for treatment is a controversial issue. Some prefer this approach as reduction is maintained by breaking the other cortex. While other find it un-necessory and they just close reduce the fracture with immobilization.",

The above patient is most likely suffering from a neuropraxia because of abnormal positioning of limb causing pressure on the ulnar nerve and he is expected to recover spontaneously and completely.

QNerve Conduction Studies: Electromyography tests and nerve conduction studies are indicated to confirm the area of entrapment, document the extent of the pathology, and detect or rule out the possibility of double crush syndromeQ.

QConduction velocities and EMG are useful in chronic neuropathies because EMG shows axonal degenerationQ. Treatment: Conservative (splint devices, physical therapy, rehabilitation) or surgicalQ.

Explanation: Forearm fractures in children are extra-articular injuries and can be managed conservatively with plaster after closed reduction of the fracture. All displaced physeal injuries demand anatomical reduction and internal fixation to avoid the complication of transphyseal bridging or altered growth. Reduction prior to internal fixation can be done with closed manipulation or by open surgery, the determinant being achievement of anatomical reduction. Intercondylar fractures of the femur may be amenable to closed reduction, whereas lateral condyle fractures of the humerus are difficult to assess and reduce closed. St is difficult to determine the amount of displacement of lateral condyle humerus fractures; when doubt exists, the fracture should be treated as displaced. Benign nondisplaced fractures of the lateral humeral condyle have known to be completely displaced at 1 week after casting, requiring open reduction and internal fixation. Lateral condylar fractures are notorious for complications - non-union, cubitus valgus, tardy ulnar nerve palsy. Closed treatment is often unsatisfactory and open reduction and internal fixation for lateral condyle humerus fractures are recommended -- hence the term \"fracture of necessity\".",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Thomas splint * In Classical thomas splint, tration is applied to the limb distal to the fracture, and pull is exerted against a fixed point. This is thus an example of continuos fixed traction. Continuous traction* Traction is applied to the limb distal to the fracture, so as to exert a continuous pull in the long axis of the bone, with a counterforce in the opposite direction (to prevent the patient being merely dragged along the bed). This is particularly useful for shaft fractures that are oblique or spiral and easily displaced by muscle contraction. Traction cannot hold a fracture still; it can pull a long bone straight and hold it out to length but to maintain accurate reduction is sometimes difficult. Meanwhile the patient can move the joints and exercise the muscles.* Traction is safe enough, provided it is not excessive and care is taken when inserting the traction pin. The problem is speed: not because the fracture unites slowly (it does not) but because lower limb traction keeps the patient in hospital.* Consequently, as soon as the fracture is 'sticky' (deformable but not displaceable), traction should be replaced by bracing, if this method is feasible. Traction includes: a) Traction by gravity - This applies only to upper limb injuries. Thus, with a wrist sling the weight of the arm provides continuous traction to the humerus. For comfort and stability, especially with a transverse fracture, a U-slab of plaster may be bandaged on or, better, a removable plastic sleeve from the axilla to just above the elbow is held on with Velcro. b) Skin traction - Skin traction will sustain a pull of no more than 4 or 5 kg. Holland strapping or onewaystretch. Elastoplast is stuck to the shaved skin and held on with a bandage. The malleoli are protected by Gamgee tissue, and cords or tapes are used for traction. c) Skeletal traction - A stiff wire or pin is inserted - usually behind the tibial tubercle for hip, thigh and knee injuries, or through the calcaneum for tibial fractures - and cords tied to them for applying traction. Whether by skin or skeletal traction, the fracture is reduced and held in one of three ways: fixed traction, balanced traction or a combination of the two. d) Fixed traction - The pull is exerted against a fixed point. The usual method is to tie the traction cords to the distal end of a Thomas' splint and pull the leg down until the proximal, padded ring of the splint abuts firmly against the pelvis, eg: Classical Thomas splinte) Balanced traction - Here the traction cords are guided over pulleys at the foot of the bed and loaded with weights; countertraction is provided by the weight of the body when the foot of the bed is raised. Eg: Hamilton russel, Gallows, Thomas splint with pearsons knee attachementf) Combined traction - If a Thomas' splint is used, the tapes are tied to the end of the splint and the entire splint is then suspended, as in balanced traction.",

        "question": "Best management of open fracture is:",
        "exp": "Ans: A (Debridement) Ref: Campbell's Operative Orthopaedics, 11th edition. Explanation: Management of Open Fractures. Three components of open fracture management are: o Aggressive wound debridement. o Definitive fracture stabilization with internal or external fixation; and o Delayed wound closure. Of these wound debridement is the first and most important step to avoid infection. Tscherne Classification of Open Fracture Management into Four Eras: The era of life preservation / preantiseptic era: Until 20th century. The era of limb preservation: During World War I and World Warll. The era of infection avoidance: Until the mid-1960s when antibiotic came into use. The era of functional preservation: At present; management consists of aggressive wound debridement, definitive fracture stabilization with internal or external fixation, and delayed wound closure. Gustilo, Burgess, Tscherne and AO-ASIF group recommendations for open fractures: 1. Treat open fractures as emergencies. 2. Perform a thorough initial evaluation to diagnose life-threatening and limb-threatening injuries. 3. Begin appropriate antibiotic therapy in emergency department and continue treatment for 2 to 3 days only. 4. Immediately debride the wound of contaminated and devitalized tissue, copiously irrigate, and repeat debridement within 24 to 72 hours. 5. Stabilize the fracture with the method determined at initial evaluation. 6. Leave the wound open (Controversial). 7. Perform early autogenous cancellous bone grafting. 8. Rehabilitate the involved extremity aggressively. Modified Gustilo-Anderson Classification for Open Fractures. Type I open fractures: Clean wound less than 1 cm long. Type II open fractures: Laceration more than 1 cm long, no extensive soft-tissue damage, skin flaps or avulsions. Type IMA open fractures: Extensive soft-tissue lacerations or flaps, but maintain adequate soft-tissue coverage of bone, or they result from high-energy trauma regardless of the size of the wound. Includes segmental or severely comminuted fractures, even those with 1 cm lacerations. Type NIB open fractures: Extensive soft-tissue loss with periosteal stripping and bony exposure; usually massively contaminated. Type MIC open fractures: Open fractures with an arterial injury that requires repair regardless of the size of the soft-tissue wound.",
