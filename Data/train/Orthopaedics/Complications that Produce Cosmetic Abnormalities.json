        "exp": "ANSWER: (D) Post traumatic ossification. REF: Apley 8th ed page 571, Tachdjian's Orthopaedics 3rd ed page 2168. MYOSITIS OSSIFICANS/ HETROTROPIC OSSIFICATION: It is hetrotopic calcification and ossification in muscle tissue. The name is a misnomer as there is no myositis (inflammation of muscle). Etiology: Post traumatic ossification. Surgical trauma. Microtrauma & overuse injury (soleus muscle). Massage & vigorous passive stretching. Pathogenesis: The bone formation in muscle represents metaplasia of fibroblast at the site of injury. Trauma leads to periosteal elevation followed by subperiosteal hematoma formation followed by subperiosteal ossification. It has 4 microscopic zones (Ackerman Zonation). Centre zone of undifferentiated, highly active mitotic cells and outermost zone of well differentiated bone cells surrounded by fibrous tissue. Clinical features: Mostly asymptomatic. Others presents with tenderness, palpable swelling, painful range of movement, stiffness and increased warmth. Imaging: Initial radiographs are normal. Dotted veil/cotton wool appearance in radiograph after 10 days to 4 weeks. Peripheral opacification and central lucency is seen. CT is better than X ray. Treatment: Watchful inactivity. Physical therapy should be discontinued. Low dose irradiation and Indomethacin. Surgical excision not done untill 1-2 years after acute phase of disease.",
