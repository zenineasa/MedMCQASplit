At birth, there is no calcification in the carpal bones. Although there is great individual variability, approximate ossification times are as follows:* Capitate: 1-3 months* Hamate: 2-4 months* Triquetrum: 2-3 years* Lunate: 2-4 years* Scaphoid: 4-6 years* Trapezium: 4-6 years* Trapezoid: 4-6 years* Pisiform: 8-12 years",
