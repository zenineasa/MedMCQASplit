Prostate carcinoma cells secrete factors that directly and indirectly alter the osteoblastic function and express factors critical for normal bone development and remodeling, including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), TGF-b, platelet- derived growth factor, adrenomedullin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). b. The osteolytic factor, PTHrP, is also abundantly expressed in Prostate carcinoma metastases, despite the fact that these lesions are primarily blastic. It has been demonstrated that PTHrP increases osteoblastic progenitor cell proliferation and induces early Osteoblastic differentiation. c. Another study says that Wants (a large family of proteins that promote bone growth) contribute to prostate cancer- mediated osteoblastic activity. Prostate cancer bone metastases have both an osteolytic and osteoblastic component, there is a shift in the balance from osteolytic to osteoblastic activity as prostate cancer progresses, which results in osteosclerotic (Osteoblastic) metastasis.",

Arises from endothelial cells of the bone marrow in the diaphysis (medullary cavity) of long tubular bonesQ (especially femur) and flat bones of pelvis. Highly malignant, undifferentiated peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)MC site: Diaphysis of femurQ >fibula > ilium > tibia. Pathology: Arising in medullar cavity usually invade the cortex, and periosteum producing a soft tissue massQ. Composed of sheets of uniform, small round cellsQ (that are slightly larger than lymphocytes), with pale clear appearing cytoplasm due to presence of glycogenQ. Cytoplasm is PAS positive and diastase digestibleQ. Presence of Homer-wright rosettes and pseudo rosette is indicative of neural differentiation (i. e. PNET). Express MIC 2 gene in very high amount, distinguish from other round cell tumorsQ. Most definitive test: Demonstration of chromosomal translocation by karyotyping or RT- PCR detection of t(11: 22). 80- 95% patients have a translocation mostly t (11: 22) > t (21: 22) and rarely t (7: 22)QEwing sarcomas are periodic acid Schiff positive (owing to intracellular glycogen) and reticulin negative. Clinical Feature: Mostly in males between 10-20 years of ageQ. Pain, swelling, tenderness, urinary/rectal complaints (when ilium involved) pathological fracture. Systemic symptoms such as fever, generalized weakness, weight loss, and lab anomalies as anemia, leukocytosis and raised ESRQ are hallmark of fulminating course, advanced disease or metastasis. 50% of all metastases occurs to lungQ and 25% to bone and bone marrow. Diagnosis: Mottled rarefaction of spongiosa with permeation of overlying cortex, reflecting rapid bone destruction is the principal finding. Laminated (layered) periosteal new bone formation known as onion-peel appearance. Soft tissue massQ, indicating neoplasm has perforated cortex. Treatment: Highly radiosensitive (melts on radiotherapy)Q but overall survival is not much enhanced. Chemotherapy is much more effective and include vincristine, actinomycin D, adriamycin, ifosfamide and etoposide. Best results are achieved by: Preoperative chemotherapy then wide excision (or amputation) if tumor is in favorable site and further chemotherapy for 1 years. Radiotherapy followed by local excision if it is in less accessible site and then further chemotherapy for 1 year.

These are not neoplastic lesions. They appear in bone that is still in the active phase of growth i. e., early childhood or adolescenceX-ray appearance is typical. They present as oval lytic lesion at the metaphysis (though may sometimes migrate to diaphysis as the bone grows). Long axis of the cyst lies parallel to the long axis of the bone. There is no periosteal reaction. Typically non-expansile but may be expansible. Parosteal Osteosarcoma. It develops from the periosteum at the periphery of the bone and grows outwards. On X-raythey present as dense mass of homogenous new bone that extends away from the bone cortex. Osteochondroma. These are not bone tumors but actually a hyperplastic or dysplastic bone disturbance which seems to originate from displaced or aberrant cartilage of the growth plate. The osteochondroma stops growing when the nearest epiphyseal plate fuses', growth after this suggests malignancyX-ray features. They develop in the metaphyseal region of long bones. Osteochondromas always originate near an epiphyseal line and grow at right angles to the long axis of the bone.

        "exp": "(C) Chronic osteomyelitis. As the given question, case history suggestive of typical sub-acute haematogenic osteomyelitis, otherwise known as Brodie's abscess[?]BRODIE ABSCESS is a subacute osteomyelitis, which may persist for years before converting to a frank osteomyelitis. Classically, this may present after conversion as a draining abscess extending from the tibia out through the shin. Its relative mildness is presumably due to the organism being less virulent or the patient more resistant (or both). Pathology: Typically there is a well-defined cavity in cancellous bone - usually in the tibial metaphysis - containing glairy seropurulent fluid (rarely pus). Surrounding bone trabeculae are often thickened. Clinical features: Patient is usually a child or adolescent who has had pain near one of the larger joints for several weeks or even months. WBC count and blood cultures usually show no abnormality but the ESR is sometimes elevated. Imaging: Typical radiographic lesion is a circumscribed, round or oval radiolucent 'cavity' 1-2 cm in diameter. Most often it is seen in the tibial or femoral metaphysis, but it may occur in the epiphysis or in one of the cuboidal bones (e. g. the calcaneum). Sometimes the 'cavity' is surrounded by a halo of sclerosis (the classic Brodie's abscess); occasionally it is less well defined, extending into the diaphysis. The radioisotope scan shows markedly increased activity. Diagnosis: In about half the cases and the organism is almost always Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment: Conservative if the diagnosis is not in doubt. Immobilization and antibiotics (flucloxacillin and fusidic acid) intravenously for 4 or 5 days and then orally for another 6 weeks usually result in healing, though this may take up to 12 months. If the diagnosis is in doubt, an open biopsy is needed and the lesion may be curated at the same time. Curettage is also indicated if the x-ray shows that there is no healing after conservative treatment; this is always followed by a further course of antibiotics. Other Options: Radiological features[?]. Osteosarcoma: MC malignant primary bone tumor in young adults + children; 2nd MC primary malignant bone tumor after multiple myeloma. Neoplastic tissue is radiolucent, Periosteal reaction shows 'Codman's triangle', Zone of transformation is fairly large, \"sun-ray\" appearance is characteristic (produced by thin radiopaque spicules of bone, radiating away from the cortex of the bone), large soft tissue swelling.

Increase in thickness of cartilage cap: Cartilaginous cap (best visualized on MRI) Thick, > 2 cm, tabulated, extending into soft tissues in chondrosarcoma (Malignant degeneration of a peripheral solitary osteochondroma leads to chondrosarcoma.). Pain: When malignant changes occur, the lesions become painful and show evidence of growth. Criteria. Osteochondroma. Chondrosarcoma. Continuity of cortex and medullary cavity with parent bone. Present. QGradual loss. QTumor (external surface). Well demarcated and distinct. Indistinct and fuzzy. Cartilaginous cap (best seen on MRI)< 1cm (thin)Q> 3 cm (thick)Q, lobulated, extended into soft tissue. Matrix pattern. Dense at periphery with solid cortex. Normal cancellous bone centrally. Periphery is granular with small areas of rarefaction and disorganized calcification. Blotchy areas of calcification with center of tumor with streaky densities extending peripherally. Adjacent soft tissue. Normal. Large soft tissue masses containing disorganized areas of calcification. Osteochondroma (Osteocartilagenous Exostosis)MC benign bone tumorQ accounting for ~40% of all benign cases. Consists of a bony base or stalk with a cartilage capQ that projects from the normal bone away from a near by joint. Etiopathogenesis: Developmental disorder, instead of a neoplasm. Caused by misdirected growth of a portion of physeal plate that is projected laterally and causing development of eccentric cartilage capped bony prominence. Metaphyseal area of any bone developing by endochondral ossificationQ may be involved. MC sites: Fast growing ends of long bonesQ (distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal humerus > distal radius, distal tibia, proximal and distal fibula). Also occur in flat bones of pelvis (ilium), scapula and ribsQ. May be solitary (more common) or multiple (diaphyseal aclasia or multiple hereditary exostosis/ Multiple hereditary osteochondromatosis). Trevor's Disease is osteochondroma on epiphyseal side of growth plate. Clinical Feature: Most become evident under 20 years with slight male preponderance. Present with lump or interference of tendon function, pain, growth disturbanceQ, of an extremity, compromised joint motion, abnormal cosmetic appearance or secondary impingement of soft tissues. Causes of sudden increase in pain in Osteochondroma. FractureQ through stalk or pedunculated lesion. Sarcomatous change. BursitisQ of overlying bursa. Impingement of neighboring structure e. g. nerve, muscle etc. Malignant degeneration may lead to chondrosarcomaQ, usually occurring in adult life. Evidence of Malignant Transformation to Chondrosarcoma. Pain and evidence of growth of long duration after skeletal maturity. QCartilaginous cap thicker than 1 cm in adultQ (in child may be 2 - 3 cm thick). Cartilage cap > 8 cm diameter. QFluffy out line. QIncreased uptake on bone scans after maturity. QCT or MRI soft tissue mass or displacement of major neurovascular bundleQ. Diagnosis: Biopsy of a presumed chondrosarcoma before surgery may be of limited valueQ due to significant chances of non- representative biopsy and a potential risk of seeding the biopsy tract. Classical feature: Cortex and cancellous bone of osteochondroma blend with the cortex and cancellous bone of host. QX-ray: Larger lesions undergo cartilage degeneration and calcification. Slight metaphyseal widening at the site of exostosis. Treatment. Excision of OC should, if possible, be postponed until later adolescence due to risk of recurrence and growth arrest.

SOME IMPORTANT NAMED MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONSCodman's Tumour. Benign tumor of the cartilage and cartilageforming connective tissue. Affects epiphyses of the long bones. Most common sites: Femur, humerus and tibia. Askin Tumor. Malignant small cell tumor of the thoracopulmonary region. Most common sites: Soft tissue of chest wall, peripheral lung and ribs. Resembles Ewing sarcoma (EWS) in histology. Ewing Sarcoma - also called ' endothelioma of bone'. Baker Cyst. Most common synovial cysts. Occur in the posterior thigh and knee. Caused by trapping of fluid in semimembranous bursa. Brodie Abscess. Subaeute or chronic stage of pyogenic osteomyelitis. Usually found in metaphyses and diaphyses of tubular bones. Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly isolated pathogen. Central area of suppurative necrosis lined by granulation tissue and surrounding sclerotic bone. X-ray appearance--Lytic lesion with surrounding sclerosis and cortical irregularities. Differential diagnoses--EWS, osteoid osteoma and eosinophilic granuloma. Imaging technique of choice for diagnosis--MRI. Penumbra sign in MRI: Thin layer of hyperintense T1 signal intensity (representing granulation tissue lining the cavity) relative to that of the abscess cavity. De Quervain Tenosynovitis. Stenosing tenosynovitis of the abductor pollicis longus (EPL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) tendons. Also called washerwoman's sprain and baby wrist. Cause: Idiopathic: Overuse and Microtrauma. Pathology--Chronic degeneration. Evans Tumor. Low-grade Fihromyxoid Sarcoma. Presents as intramuscular soft-tissue mass in the lower extremity or trunk. Most commonly seen in young to middle-aged adults. Kaposi Sarcoma. Idiopathic multiple pigmented sarcoma. Mesenchymal tumor involving blood and lymphatic vessels. Most common site is skin. It is an AIDS-defming illness. Virus associated with this tumor is herpes virus(HHV-8). Morel-Lavallee Lesion. Closed degloving injury. Abrupt separation of subcutaneous tissue from the underlying fascia in the presence of bleeding capillaries. Growing hemorrhagic collection. Most common site is proximal lateral thigh(dermis has rich vascular plexus piercing fascia lata). May require surgical debridement to prevent infection. Morton Neuroma. Perineural fibrosis and nerve degeneration of the interdigital nerve at the level of the metatarsal heads. Not a true neuroma. Caused by compression and irritation of the nerve beneath the intermetatarsal ligament. Presents with intermittent pain in the distribution of the interdigital nerve. Most frequent location - between third and fourth metatarsals. Treatment: Local steroid injection. Diagnosis by MRI or ultrasound. Paget Disease\"Osteitis deformans\"; inflammatory condition of bone. Excessive absorption of bone followed by improper new bone production. Paramyxovirus implicated in one of the causes. Higher prevalence in Ashkenazi Jews. Serum marker HLA-DR2. Albers-Schonberg Disease--Osteopetrosis. Also called Marble bone disease (due to thick dense bone). Lobstein Syndrome--Osteogenesis Imperfecta Also called Brittle bone disease (due to tendency to repetitive spontaneous fractures).",

        "exp": "Ans: A (Aneurysmal bone cyst) Ref: Apley's System of Orthopaedics and Fractures, 9th edition - Tumours. Explanation: Aneurysmal Bone Cyst. It may be encountered at any age and in almost any bone, though more often in young adults and in the long-bone metaphyses. Usually it arises spontaneously but it may appear after degeneration or haemorrhage in some other lesion. With expanding lesions, patients may complain of pain. Occasionally, a large cyst may cause a visible or palpable swelling of the bone. X-rays show a well-defined radiolucent cyst, often trabeeulated and eccentrically placed. In a growing tubular bone it is always situated in the metaphysis and therefore may resemble a simple cyst or one of the other cyst-like lesions. Occasional sites include vertebrae and the flat bones. In an adult an aneurysmal bone cyst may be mistaken for a giant-cell tumour. Unicameral Bone Cyst. Also called as simple bone cyst, appears during childhood, typically in the metaphysis of one of the long bones and most commonly in the proximal humerus or femur. It is not a tumour, it tends to heal spontaneously and it is seldom seen in adults. The condition is usually discovered after a pathological fracture or as an incidental finding on X-ray. X-rays show a well-demarcated radiolucent area in the metaphysis, often extending up to the phvseal plate; the cortex may be thinned and the bone expanded. Hydatid Cyst. It is disease, is caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus. Parasitic infestation is common among sheep farmers, but bone lesions are rare. The bones most commonly affected are the vertebrae, pelvis, femur, scapula and ribs. The patient may complain of pain and swelling, or may present for the first time with a pathological fracture or compression of the spinal cord. Infestation sometimes starts in childhood but the cysts take so long to enlarge that clinical symptom and signs may not become apparent for many years. X-rays show solitary or nudtiloculated hone cysts, hut only moderate expansion of the cortices. However, cortical thinning may lead to a pathological fracture. In the spine, hydatid disease may involve adjacent vertebrae, with large cysts extending into the paravertebral soft tissues. These features are best seen on CT and MRI, which should always be performed if operative excision of the lesion is contemplated. Fibrous Dysplasia. It is developmental disorders in which areas of trabecular bone are replaced by cellular fibrous tissue containing Hecks of osteoid and woven bone. It may affect one bone (monostotic) one limb (monomelic) or many bones (polyostotic). If the lesions are large, the bone is considerably weakened and pathological fractures or progressive deformity may occur. The most common sites of occurrence are the proximal femur, tibia, humerus, ribs and craniofacial bones. Small, single lesions are asymptomatic. Large, monostotic lesions may cause pain or maybe discovered only when the patient develops a pathological fracture. Patients with polyostotic disease present in childhood or adolescence with pain, limp, bony enlargement, deformity or pathological fracture. Untreated, the characteristic deformities persist through adult life. Occasionally the bone disorder is associated with cafe-au-Iait patches on the skin and (in girls) precocious sexual development (Albright's syndrome). X-rays show radiolucent 'cystic' areas in the metaphysis or shaft; because they contain fibrous tissue with diffuse spots of immature bone, the lucent patches typically have a slightly hazy or 'ground-glass' appearance. The weight bearing bones may be bent, and one of the classic features is the 'shepherd's crook' deformity of the proximal femur. Radioscintigraphy shows marked activity in the lesion.",

It may affect one bone (monostotic form) or several bones (polyostotic form). The monostotic form is the most common and is usually diagnosed in patients between 20 and 30 years of age without associated skin lesions. The polyostotic form typically manifests in children <10 years of age and may progress with age. Monostotic fibrous dysplasia most commonly affects the femur--particularly the femoral neck--as well as the tibia and ribs. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia most commonly affects the maxilla and other craniofacial bones, ribs, and metaphyseal or diaphyseal portions of the proximal femur or tibia. Radiographic Findings. In long bones, the fibrous dysplastic lesions are typically well-defined, radiolucent areas with thin cortices and a ground-glass appearance. The articular ends are usually spared. Involvement of facial bones usually presents as radiodense lesions, which may create a leonine appearance (leontiasis osea). Treatment. There is no established effective treatment. IV bisphosphonate therapy- Improvement in bone pain and partial or complete resolution of radiographic lesions have been reported after IV bisphosphonate therapy. Surgical stabilization is used to prevent pathologic fracture or destruction of a major joint space and to relieve nerve root or cranial nerve compression or sinus obstruction. Complications. Most common complication is pathologic fracture. Shepherd's crook deformity - If fracture occurs at the femoral neck, it commonly leads to a deformity called \"shepherd's crook\"Expanding bone lesions may cause pain, deformity and nerve entrapment. Sarcomatous transformation of either form of fibrous dysplasia is extremely rare, but it may occur spontaneously or, more commonly, after radiation therapy. Associated Disorders Albright-Mc. Cune Syndrome. It includes: polyostotic fibrous dysplasiaendocrine hyperfunction (pseudo-precocious puberty)abnormal pigmentation. The most common Endocrinopathy assoc. with Albright Mc. Cune syndrome is isosexual pseudo-precocious puberty in girls. Other less common endocrine disorders include thyrotoxicosis, Cushing syndrome, acromegaly, hyperparathyroidism, hyperprolactinemia, and pseudo-precocious puberty in boys. Much more common in girls (Male Female ratio-1: 10)* The cafe au lait spots seen in Albright-Mc. Cune syndrome have characteristically irregular ragged borders (commonly called \"coast of Maine\" borders), as opposed to the smoothly marginated borders (\"coast of California\") of the spots seen in neurofibromatosis. Mazabraud Syndrome It includes: polyostotic fibrous dysplasia andsoft-tissue myxomas",

A radiograph reveals a mass in the diaphyseal region of the left femur with overlying cortical erosion and soft tissue extension. A biopsy of the lesion shows numerous small round cells, rich in PAS positive diastase sensitive granules. The most likely histological diagnosis is:",

The histopathological features of Ewing's sarcoma are: Small round cells having scant cytoplasm. These cells are rich in glycogen* this glycogen filled cytoplasm is detected by staining with periodic acid - shiff (PAS +ve). These cells are diastase sensitive. Diastase is an enzyme which splits glycogen. Homer wright rosettes* (the tumor cells are arranged in circles around a central fibrillary space). Remember: The other round cell tumours of bone. Osteosarcoma. Reticulum cell sarcoma. Metastatic neuroblastoma. Also Remember. Gross pathological features of Ewing's sarcoma: The tumour arises in the medullary cavity from the endothelial cells. New bone formation may extend along the shaft and sometimes it appears as fusiform layers of bone around the lesion, (onion peel effect)*The tumour erodes the cortex early often extending into the soft tissues with radiating streaks of ossification and reactive periosteal bone at the proximal and distal margins, (these features the 'sunray appearance' and codman's triangle are usually associated with osteosarcoma but they are just as common in Ewing's sarcoma). Clinical features of Ewing's sarcoma. It occurs most commonly between the age of 10-20 years especially in the tibia, fibula or clavicle.
