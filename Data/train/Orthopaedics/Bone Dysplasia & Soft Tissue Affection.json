Other common site is proximal end of humerus. o Features are -Ground glass appearace of bone. Pencil thin cortex. White line of fraenkel - represents well calcified cartilage in metaphysis. Wimburger sign - white ring surrounding the epiphyseal centres of ossification. Winburger sign is also called ring sign as there is white ring surrounding the epiphyseal centers of ossification. Zone of rarefaction under the white line - represents a linear break in the bone, proximal and parallel to white line and epiphyseal separation may occur along this line. Lateral part of this rarefaction is seen as a triangular defect. Palkan spur or lateral spur - lateral prolongation of white line. During healing phase, subperiosteal hemorrhages become calcified and the affected bone assumes a dumbbell or club shape.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' ie metacarpophalangeal joint (Ref: Adam's outline of orthopedics, 13/e, p291; Apley's, 8/e, p344). Adams states - \"In this rather common condition thickening and constriction of the mouth of a fibrous digital sheath interfere with the free gliding of the contained flexor tendons. \"The mouth of the fibrous digital sheath is at the level of metacarpo-phalangeal joint. Trigger finger (Stenosing tenovaginitis). As stated above this condition result from constriction of the fibrous digital sheath at the entrance, so that the free gliding of contained flexor tendons does not occur. Although any digit (including thumb) may be affected, but the ring and middle fingers are most commonly affected. Initially the only symptoms is pain at the base of the affected finger. As the sheath further thickens, the contained tendon gets swollen proximal to it. The swollen segment of tendon does not enter the sheath when an attempt is made to straighten the finger from the flexed position. This is called locking of the finger. This locking can be overcome either by a strong effort in which case the finger extends with a snap-like trigger of a pistol. Treatment. Early cases may be caused by injection of methylprednisolone carefully placed into the tendon sheath. Refractory cases need operation - incision of the fibrous sheath.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a1 i. e., Osteosarcoma o Osteosarcoma is a rare long-term complication of paget's disease. Paget diseaseo Paget's disease is characterized by increased bone turnover and enlargement and thickening of the bone, but the internal architecture is abnormal and the bone is usually brittle. Primary defect is in osteoclasts with increased osteoclastic activity. This results secondarily increase in osteoblastic activity (normal osteoclasts and osteoblasts act in a co-ordinated manner). So, characteristic cellular change is a marked increase in osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity. Bone turnover is acclerated, plasma alkaline phosphatase is raised (a sign of osteoblastic activity) and there is increased excretion of hydroxyproline in urine (due to osteoclastic activity). Clinical features of Paget's diseaseo Paget's disease is slightly more common in males and is seen after 40 years of age. o The pelvis and tibia being the commonest sites, and femur, skull, spine (vertebrae) and clavicle the next commonest. o Most of the patient with Paget's disease are asymptomatic, the disorder being diagnosed when an x-ray is taken for some unrelated condition or after the incidental discovery of raised serum alkaline phosphatase. o When patients does present, they present because any of the three: -Pain: - Dull constant ache. Deformities: - Bowing of long bones, platybasia. Complications of the disease Complications of Paget's diseaseo Following complications can occur in Paget's disease: -Fracture: Are common in weight bearing bones. Cranial nerve compression: - May cause impaired vision, facial palsy, trigeminal neuralgia or deafness. Otosclerosis: - Another cause of deafness in Paget's disease. Spinal canal stenosis and nerve root compression. High output cardiac failure. Osteoarthritis: of Hip and knee. Rarely osteosarcoma",
