The swollen segment of tendon does not enter the sheath when an attempt is made to straighten the finger from the flexed position. This is called locking of the finger. This locking can be overcome either by a strong effort in which case the finger extends with a snap-like trigger of a pistol.TreatmentEarly cases may be caused by injection of methylprednisolone carefully placed into the tendon sheath. Refractory cases need operation - incision of the fibrous sheath.",

Osteomalacia, which means softening of bones, is the adult counterpart of rickets. It is primarily due to deficiency of vitamin D. This results in failure to replace the turnover of calcium and phosphorus in the organic matrix of bone. Hence, the bone content is demineralised and the bony substance is replaced by soft osteoid tissue. The osteoid is increased at the cost of mineralized bone.Causes of osteomalaciao Lack of exposure to sunlight (indoor stay )o Dietary deficiency of vitamin Do Under-nutrition during pregnancyo Malabsorption syndrome, partial gastrectomy and all causes of malabsorption,o Derangement of vitamin D and phosphorus metabolism (hereditary or acquired),o Anticonvulsant therapy : - Phenytoin.o Renal failure : Renal osteodystrophy.o Most common cause of osteomalacia is deficiency of vitamin D.Clinical features of osteomalaciao Clinical features of osteomalacia include: -Bone pains : Skeletal discomfort ranging from backache to diffuse bone pains may occur. Bone tenderness is common.Muscular weakness : The patient feels very weak. He may have difficulty in climbing up and down the stairs. A waddling gait is not unusual. Tetany may manifest as carpopedal spasm and facial twitching.Spontaneous fractures occurs usually in spine, and may result in kyphosis.Radiological feature of osteomalaciao X-ray finding in osteomalacia are : -i) Diffuse rarefaction of bonesii) Looser's zone (pseudo-fractures) Radiolucent zones at the sites of stress.Triradiate pelvis in femalesProtrusio-acetabuli, i.e., the acetabulum protruding into the pelvis.Serum biochemistry in osteomalaciao Serum calcium is mildly decreased or normal,o Serum phosphate is lowo Alkaline phosphatase is raisedo Parathormone level is increased",

Primary defect is in osteoclasts with increased osteoclastic activity. This results secondarily increase in osteoblastic activity (normal osteoclasts and osteoblasts act in a co-ordinated manner). So, characteristic cellular change is a marked increase in osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity. Bone turnover is acclerated, plasma alkaline phosphatase is raised (a sign of osteoblastic activity) and there is increased excretion of hydroxyproline in urine (due to osteoclastic activity).Clinical features of Paget's diseaseo Paget's disease is slightly more common in males and is seen after 40 years of age.o The pelvis and tibia being the commonest sites, and femur, skull, spine (vertebrae) and clavicle the next commonest.o Most of the patient with Paget's disease are asymptomatic, the disorder being diagnosed when an x-ray is taken for some unrelated condition or after the incidental discovery of raised serum alkaline phosphatase.o When patients does present, they present because any of the three : -Pain : - Dull constant acheDeformities : - Bowing of long bones, platybasia.Complications of the disease Complications of Paget's diseaseo Following complications can occur in Paget's disease : -Fracture: Are common in weight bearing bonesCranial nerve compression : - May cause impaired vision, facial palsy, trigeminal neuralgia or deafness.Otosclerosis : - Another cause of deafness in Paget's disease.Spinal canal stenosis and nerve root compressionHigh output cardiac failureOsteoarthritis : of Hip and kneeRarely osteosarcoma",
