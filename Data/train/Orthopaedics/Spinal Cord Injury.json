        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Bulbocavernous reflex Spinal shocko Spinal shock refers to the period after spinal cord injury (usually 24-48 hours) when the reflex activity of the entire spinal cord becomes depressed. o During this period the reflex arcs below the level of spinal cord injury are not functioning, o Spinal shock is basically flaccid paralysis with loss of all spinal reflexes. o There is loss of autonomic, reflex, motor and sensory activity below the level of the cord lesion. o Signs of spinal shock include: i) Flaccid paralysis ii) Loss of deep tendon and perianal reflexeso The return of reflex activity below the level of a spinal cord injury signifies the end of spinal shock, o An accurate assessment of neurological status cannot be completed until spinal shock resolves, o The earliest indicator of resolution is the return of bulbocavernous reflex. o The significance of spinal shock lies in the determination of whether a patient has sustained a complete vs incomplete spinal cord injury. o This cannot be determined until spinal shock has ended. o If there is total absence of sensory or motor function below the level of injury, after spinal shock has resolved, It indicates complete cord injury. o If there is some residual function distal to the level of injury after resolution of spinal shock indicates incomplete cord injury. o High thoracic cord has poor prognosis as this area has narrow spinal canal and precarious blood supply, watershade area of blood supply lies in upper thoracic region.",
