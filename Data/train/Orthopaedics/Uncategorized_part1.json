Shoemaker's line: With the patient lying supine, the line joining ASIS and tip of the greater trochanter is extended on the side of the abdomen on both sides. Normally these lines meet in the middle above the umblicus. In case one of the greater trochanters has migrated proximally the lines will meet in the opposite side of the abdomen and below the umblicus. Chiene's line: With the patient lying supine, lines are drawn joining the two ASIS and the two greater trochanters. Normally these make two parallel lines. In case one of the trochanters has moved proximally the lines will converge on that side. Perkin's line: When the congenital Dislocation of hip is mild in nature, the perkins lines are drawn to detect it. A horizontal line is drawn through the triradiate cartilage and a vertical line is drawn down from the outer edge of the acetabulum on both sides. The upper femoral epiphyses normally lies medial to the vertical line and below the horizontal line. But in congenital dislocation of hip the epiphyses will lie on the outer aspect of the vertical line and above the horizontal line. Bryants triangle: The patient lies supine. The tips of the greater trochanter and ASIS on both sides are marked. A perpendicular is dropped from each ASIS on to the bed. From the tip of the greater trochanter, another perpendicular is dropped on to the first one. The tips of the greater trochanter are joined to the ASIS on the respective side.

The principle of the test: Normally when one leg is raised from the ground the pelvis tilts upwards on that side, through the action of the hip abductors of the standing limb. If the abductors are inefficient they are unable to sustain the pelvis against the body weight and it tilts downwards instead of rising up on the side of the lifted leg. Note that the test is performed with the patients standing on the affected leg. Abductor mechanism: It can be compared with the lever, with the body weight is trying to tilt the pelvis down; the hip joint being the fulcrum and the abductor muscles being the power acting through the lever arm (from the head of the femur to attachment of the abductor's muscles on the greater trochanter - the neck of the femur) Causes of the positive Trendelenburg test: Any failure of the abductor mechanism causes dipping of the pelvic (ASIS) on the normal side. There are three fundamental causes: 1) Paralysis of the abductor's muscles eg. Polio. Paralysis of superior gluteral nerve (Supplies gluteus medius & minimus) 2) Marked approximation of the insertion of the abductor muscles to their origin by upward displacement of the greater trochanter; so that the muscles are slack. eg. Severe coxa vara, dislocation of hip 3) The absence of stable fulcrum & lever arm about which the abductor muscles can act Neck femur fracture Dislocation of hip, Destructruction of head as in Perthe's diseases.",

Two most common causes of limp in a child between 4-10 years are:- Transient synovitis of hip Perthe's disease The child in question has painful limp, tenderness in the femoral triangle and limitation of hip movement with normal X-ray. All of these can occur in both transient synovitis of hip and early stage of perthe's disease. However, the most favourable diagnosis here is transient synovitis because:- Transient synovitis of hip is the most common cause of painful limp in a child between 4-10 years. X-rays of transient synovitis are typically normal; however they may reveal subtle changes (widening of joint space). On the other hand x-rays are normal only in the initial stage of Perthe's; most of the time when patients present, the x-ray changes are there. Child with perthe's disease may present with painful limp, but maximum patients present when pain has subsided and only limp is there, i. e. painless limp (in chronic stage). Therefore, most probable diagnosis here is transient synovitis and management includes observation, bed rest and NSAIDs. And this is the protocol, which is followed in most of the hospitals. In a suspected case of transient synovitis, we give conservative treatment, i. e. bed rest, NSAIDs and observation. If the child does not improve in 3-5 days, then we think of further investigation. So, according to me option 'a' is the best answer here. You can choose your answer according to your thought process.",

The osteotomy converts the shearing stresses at the fracture site into compressive forces, thus enhancing fracture union. The line of weight bearing after osteotomy passes from the head to the distal fragment. It, therefore, bypasses fracture site.

        "exp": "Increased bone density Increased bone density refers to that part of the bone or whole bone appears more dense on x-ray. While an increase in bone density occurs less frequently, many examples are seen in which this is used as an aid in radiographic diagnosis. The increase in bone density can occur by several different mechanisms and be the result of different insult to the bone. Most commonly, the increase in density occurs within the trabecular bone (spongy bone / cancellous bone) following:- Thickening of trabeculae Increased number of trabeculae Increased in the density within the cortical bone occurs uncommonly because normally the bone is so compact that no space exists that permits the addition of more bone tissue. However, It is possible for cortex to become thicker as a result of the addition ofperiosteal or endosteal new bone when it is actually a reactive change. This is considered as increased bone density by some people. Actually it is not true increase in bone density but increase in the thickness, i. e. density of cortical bone remains the same but thickness increases. So, pathogenic mechanism of increased bone density may be:- Increased density of cancellous bone either due to thickening of trabeculae or increased number of trabeculae. Thickening and expansion of cortex due to periosteal reaction or endosteal reaction. Important causes of increased density are:- Generalized increased in bone density Renal osteodystrophy o Hypercalcemia & Hypervitaminosis D Flourosis o Hyperphosphatasia Mastocytosis o Hodgkin disease Myelosclerosis o Heavy metal poisoning (Lead) Sclerotic metastasis o Infantile cortical hyperostosis (Caffey disease) Myeloid metaplasia o Melorheostosis (Leri disease) Osteopertrosis (Marble bone disease) o Hyperparathyroidm (Secondary) Gaucher disease o Hypoparathyrodism Healing phase of rickets o Osteopetrosis Localized increased in bone density Avascular necrosis o Heavy metal poisoning (lead) Bone infarct o Mastocytosis Callus formation o Melorheostosis Exostosis o Osteoid osteoma Ewing sarcoma o Osteoblastoma Fibrous dysplasia o Osteoblastic metastasis Gardner syndrme o Osteomyelitis (sequestrum) Healed osteomyelitis o Paget's disease Eosinophilic granuloma Collapse of cancellous bone causes trabeculae to come together, therefore increased density.",

The exception to this is the casualty suffering external, peripheral haemorrhage. Military experience has shown that bleeding from limb wounds is a leading cause of combat casualty deaths, a significant proportion of which are avoidable. This has led to the development of CABC sequence in patients presenting with external hemorrhage, when first 'C' stands for catastrophic hemorrhage. Life threatening, external hemorrhage is controlled, and then the usual ABC sequence is followed. Over bleeding should be temponaded with dressing and firm pressure.",

A cervical dislocation means that a ligament injury in the neck has occurred, and two (or more) of the adjoining spine bones have become abnormally separated from each other, causing instability. Patients can have a cervical fracture or dislocation, or both. Fractures and dislocations of the cervical spine are not uncommon and account for almost half of all spinal column injuries that occur every year. According to a study published by Lasfargues in 1995, over 25, 000 cervical fractures occur each year in the United States. The majority of fractures and dislocations of the spinal column occur in the cervical spine because it is the most mobile portion of the spinal column, and understandably, the most vulnerable to injury. Although the lumbar (low back) region is most commonly injured during daily laborious, low-energy activities, the neck is most likely to be injured during high-energy trauma such as motor vehicle accidents. Cervical fractures and dislocations are typically classified according to their region/location and injury/fracture pattern. Because of the unique anatomy of the spine in the region close to the head, cervical injuries are categorized as occipital-cervical (occiput-C2) and subaxial cervical spine (C3-C7) injuries. Within each of these categories, injuries are further stratified according to the specific location of injury and injury/fracture pattern.",

Clinical screening via universal physical examination during the first year of life by properly trained medical providers. Follow-up ultrasounds for abnormal or questionable examinations can be considered. Universal clinical (physical examination) screening with additional selective ultrasound or radiographic screening for children with risk factors. This risk factors proposed include female gender, breech presentation at delivery, positive family history, and some data suggest torticollis and congenital foot deformity as well. The practitioner must remember that the majority of children with DDH have no identifiable risk factors; thus, this method of screening cannot be expected to detect all cases of DDH. Ultrasound or radiographic examination is an adjunct, not a replacement, of clinical examination. Universal screening of all babies with ultrasound or radiography in addition to a physical examination. This practice would be expensive and would require significant additional resources. The benefit of universal screening has not been demonstrated, and the practice would increase the identification of \"abnormalities\" that would resolve without intervention. Because female infants with a positive family history of DDH and females born in the breech presentation have the highest risk of DDH, imaging with an ultrasound or radiography is recommended for these infants.",

        "exp": "Management of open fracture Open fracture need immediate surgery to clean the area of the injury. Because of the break in the skin, debris and infection can travel to the fracture location, and lead to a high rate of infection in the bone. Once an infection is established, it can be a difficult problem to solve. Treatment of established bone infections often requires multiple surgeries, prolonged antibiotic treatment and long-term problems. Therefore, every effort is made to prevent this potential problem with early surgery. All open fractures, no matter how trivial they are must be assumed to be contaminated. The four essential principles of treatment for management of open fractures are: - Antibiotic prophylaxis Urgent wound and fracture debridement. Stabilization of fracture (fracture fixation) Early definitive wound cover \u200bDebridement Patient is taken immediately to surgery and debridement is done by removal of contaminated and devitalized tissue, copious irrigation by sterile solution (usually saline). As a general rule it is best to leave cut nerves and tendons alone, though if the wound is absolutely clean and no dissection is require, and provided the necessary expertise is available, they can be sutured. Wound closure A small, uncontaminated wound in a Grade I or II fracture may (after debridement) be sutured, provided this can be done without tension. In the more severe grades of injury, immediate fracture stabilization and wound cover using split-skin grafts, local or distant flaps is ideal, provided both orthopaedic and plastic surgeons are satisfied that a clean, viable wound has been achieved after debridement. In the absence of this combined approach at the time of debridement, the fracture is stabilized and the wound is left open and dressed with impervious dressing. Return to surgery for a 'second look' should have definitive fracture cover as an objective. It should be done by 48-72 hours, and not later than 5 days. Stabilizing the fracture Stabilizing the fracture is important in reducing the likelihood of infection and assisting recovery of the soft tissues. The method of fixation depends on the degree of contamination, length of time from injury to operation and amount of soft tissue damage. If there is no obvious contamination and definitive wound cover can be achieved at the time of debridement, open fractures of all grades can be treated as for a closed injury. Internal fixation or external fixation depends on the individual characteristic of fracture. If wound is contaminated and clean wound cannot be obtained by debridement or if wound cover is delayed, then external fixation by a fixator is safer. Coming back to question Debridement, Internal fixation and external fixation all are used in the treatment of open fracture. For one answer go ahead with debridement because debridement is the most important step and is done in all open fractures. On the other hand, whether to stabilize the fracture either by internal fixation or external fixation, depends upon specific situations.",
