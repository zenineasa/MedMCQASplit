Conditions where Milkman's fracture may be seeno Ricketso Osteomalacia(most characteristic)o Fibrous dysplasiao Renal osteodystrophyo Paget's disease. Common locationso Scapulao Medial femoral neck & shafto Pubic & Ischial ramio Lesser trochantero Ribs & clavicleo Proximal ulna & radiuso Phalanges, metacarpals & metatarsals",

Ref: Maheshwari 5th ed. / 312* Cortical infarctions are wide transverse lucencies traversing bone usually at right angles to the involved cortex and are associated most frequently with osteomalacia and rickets. They are pseudo- fractures and considered a type of insufficiency fracture.* Typically, the fractures have sclerotic irregular margins, and are often symmetrical.
