        "exp": "MULTIPLE MYELOMA : Bone pain is the most common symptom in myeloma, affecting nearly 70% of patients. Unlike the pain of metastatic carcinoma, which often is worse at night, the pain of myeloma is precipitated by movement. Persistent localized pain in a patient with myeloma usually signifies a pathologic fracture. The bone lesions of myeloma are caused by the proliferation of tumour cells, activation of osteoclasts that destroy bone, and suppression of osteoblasts that form new bone. The bone lesions are lytic in nature and are rarely associated with osteoblastic new bone formation due to their suppression by dickhoff-1 (DKK-1) produced by myeloma cells. Therefore, radioisotopic bone scanning is less useful in diagnosis than is plain radiography. The bony lysis results in substantial mobilization of calcium from bone, and serious acute and chronic complications of hypercalcemia may dominate the clinical picture. Localized bone lesions may expand to the point that mass lesions may be palpated, especially on the skull, clavicles, and sternum; and the collapse of veebrae may lead to spinal cord compression. Skull X ray may show the typical \"punched out\" lesions characteristic of multiple myeloma. The lesion represents a purely osteolytic lesion with little or no osteoblastic activity The next most common clinical problem in patients with myeloma is susceptibility to bacterial infections.

        "exp": "piriformis syndrome.: As you may recall from your anatomy, the piriformis is the small muscle that crosses the greater sciatic foramen, cutting it into two spaces as the muscle passes from the edge of the sacrum to the greater trochanter. The sciatic nerve comes out of the greater sciatic foramen below the piriformis, and is liable to compression by the muscle. Symptoms are as described above; bicycle riding and running may also set off the symptoms, which may take the form of chronic nagging ache, pain, tingling, or numbness. Treatment is usually to teach the patient to avoid maneuvers that set off the symptoms. Some patients have been helped by coicosteroid injection near the site where the piriformis muscle crosses the sciatic nerve; this therapy is thought to work by reducing the fat around the muscle and thereby increasing the available space in the area. Disk compression of the sciatic nerve can also produce sciatic pain, but there is almost always lumbar as well as buttock pain. Fibromyalgia causes achy pain, tenderness, and stiffness of involved sites, including muscles, tendon inseions, and nearby soft tissues. Sites commonly involved include head, neck, shoulders, thorax, low back, and thighs. Popliteus tendinitis is inflammation of the tendon of the popliteus muscle of the knee.

The histologic hallmark of synol sarcoma is the biphasic morphology of the tumor cells (i.e., epithelial-like and spindle cells).

Pathologically, it consists of a nidus of tangled arrays of paially mineralised osteoid trabeculae surrounded by dense sclerotic bone. Clinical presentation: The tumour is seen commonly between the ages of 5-25 years. The bones of the lower extremity are more commonly affected; tibia being the commonest. The tumour is generally located in the diaphysis of long bones. The presenting complaint is a nagging pain, worst at night, and is relieved by salicylates. There are minimal or no clinical signs, except for mild tenderness at the site of the lesion, and a palpable swelling if it is a superficial lesion. Diagnosis: It is generally confirmed on X-ray. The tumour is visible as a zone of sclerosis surrounding a radiolucent nidus, usually less than 1 cm in size. In some cases, the nidus may not be seen on a plain X-ray because of extensive surrounding sclerosis, and may be detected on a CT scan. Treatment: Complete excision of the nidus along with the sclerotic bone is done. Prognosis is good. It is not a pre-malignant condition.
