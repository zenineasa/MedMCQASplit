        "exp": "CARPEL TUNNEL SYNDROME The symptomatology is classic for carpal tunnel syndrome, which is a form of neuropathy resulting from anatomic compression of the median nerve. Pain, tingling sensations, and hypoesthesia in the distribution of the median nerve are the cardinal manifestations. These often undergo exacerbations at nighttime. A shock-like pain upon percussion on the volar aspect of the wrist (Tinel sign) is an additional characteristic sign. Carpal tunnel syndrome is most often idiopathic, but may represent a manifestation of underlying disorders such as rheumatoid ahritis, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, acromegaly, and leukemia. Carpal tunnel syndrome may be confused with angina pectoris when located on the left side. However, angina pectoris typically manifests with physical or emotional stress and very rarely results in pain limited to the hand. Dupuytren contracture is a relatively common disorder characterized by fibrous thickening of the palmar fascia. Contracture and nodule formation ensue. This condition is most common in Caucasian men over 50. Fibrositis also known as fibromyalgia, refers to a poorly understood syndrome of widespread musculoskeletal pain associated with tenderness in multiple trigger points. Fatigue, headache, and numbness are also common. Women between 20 and 50 years of age are most commonly affected. Neck, shoulders, low back and hips are usually involved. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy describes a syndrome of pain and swelling of one extremity (most commonly a hand), associated with skin atrophy. It is thought to be secondary to vasomotor instability. Sometimes, it follows injuries to the shoulder (shoulder-hand variant). Ref: Maheshwari 9. TH ed",

Colles fracture is the fracture at the distal end of radius at coico cancellous junction, in adults, with typical displacement. commonest fracture of people above 40. It nearly always result from fracture on outstretched hands. C/f: The patient presents with pain, swelling and deformity of wrist. on examination tenderness and irregularity of lower end of radius is found. There may be typical dinner fork deformity. The radial styloid process comes to lie at the same level or a little higher than ulnar styloid process. Ref: Essential Ohopaedics, Maheswari & Mhaskar, 9th ed,",
