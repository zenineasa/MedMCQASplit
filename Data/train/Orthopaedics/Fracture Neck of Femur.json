        "exp": "Ans: A (Fracture neck of femur) Ref: Apley's System of Orthopaedics and Fractures, 9th Edition, P 847-848. Explanation: Fracture Neck of Femur. Most common site of fractures in the elderly. Common in women in the 8th and 9th decades. The association with osteoporosis is main underlying factor. Other risk factors include bone-losing or bone-weakening disorders such as osteomalacia, diabetes, stroke (disuse}, alcoholism and chronic debilitating disease. In addition, old people often have weak muscles and poor balance resulting in an increased tendency to fall. The fracture usually results from a simple fall; how ever, in very osteoporotic people, less force is required--perhaps no more than catching a toe in the carpet and twisting the hip into external rotation. Occasionally, stress fractures of the femoral neck occur in runners or military personnel. Not all hip fractures are so obvious. With an impacted fracture the patient may still be able to walk, and debilitated or mentally handicapped patients may not complain at all-even with bilateral fractures.",

Normally blood is supplied to the head of the femur by three routes-Intramedullary vessels in the femoral neck. Vessels in the ligament of head of the femur (ligamentum teres). Ascending cervical branches of the medial and lateral circumflex anastomosis which run within the capsular retinaculum before entering the bone at the edge of the femoral head. Out of these vessels the main supply to the femoral head is by intramedullary vessels and vessels which run within capsular retinaculum. Damage of the vessel in Fracture neck femur occurs in following manner. The intramedullary vessel is almost always damaged. The other vessel which can also be damaged is the retinacular vessels. So, the only vessel left to supply the femoral head during fracture neck femur is the vessel of the ligamentum teres. The supply from this vessel is not enough. It supplies only 20% of the blood to the fractured neck of femur.",
