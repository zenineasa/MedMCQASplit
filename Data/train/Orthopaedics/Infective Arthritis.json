At this stage head of the femur is cartilaginous and is rapidly and completely destroyed by the pyogenic process. Onset is acute with abscess formation, which heals rapidly after spontaneous bursting outside or after incision and drainage. Quite often it is a delayed presentation and the child is brought for consultation when he begins to walk with a limp. On examination:-i) Limb is shortii) Hip movements are increased in all directions. iii) There is instability with positive telescoping.",

Sequelae include retarded growth, partial or complete destruction of epiphysis, deformity of the joint, epiphyseal osteonecrosis, acetabular dysplasia & psuedoarthrosis of the hip\"- Apiey 9th/45\"Aspirate the joint & examine the fluid.. 4 WBC & gram stain should be carried out immediately. Sample of fluid are also sent for full microbiological examination & tests for antibiotic sensitivity\"- Apiey 9th/44. SEPTIC ARTHRITIS Maheswari 5th/175-78; 3rd/163. It is more common in children & males are more susceptible. Stcrp/iy/ocoocus aureus is the commonest causative organism, other organisms are strepto- pneumo & Gonococcus. The organism reach the joint by one of the following routes-Haematogenous: This is the commonest route. Secondary to nearby osteomyelitis: This is a particularly common route in joints with intra-articular metaphysic. Penetrating wounds. Iatrogenic. Umbilical cord sepsis. PATHOGENESIS Nelson 18th/2846. Suppurative arthritis primarily occurs as a result of hematogenous seeding of the synovial space. Less often, organisms enter the joint space by direct inoculation or extension from a contiguous focus. The synovia] membrane has a rich vascular supply and lacks a basement membrane, providing an ideal environment for hematogenous seeding. Table (Maheswari 5th/177): Synovial joint examination. Points.

The femoral head at this stage is completely cartilaginous. If not treated early, the whole femoral head is destroyed, without any potential for a normal hip joint. Treatment - Urgent arthrotomy and lavage of the hip joint. Sample has to be obtained from the hip. either by aspiration or on arthrotomy, prior to starting on antibiotic, unless patient is toxic. Empirical antibiotics are started. Definitive antibiotic is started once organism culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing reports are available. ORGANISMS CAUSING SEPTIC ARTHRITIS AT DIFFERENT AGESInfants < 6 monthso Caused by wide range of organismso Broad spectrum bacteriocidal agent is required. o DOC-Cloxacillin, Methicillin, Kanamycin. 6 months to 2 yearso Most common organism is Haemophilias influenza. o DOC-Ampicillin.
