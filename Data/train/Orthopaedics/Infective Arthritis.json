At this stage head of the femur is cartilaginous and is rapidly and completely destroyed by the pyogenic process. Onset is acute with abscess formation, which heals rapidly after spontaneous bursting outside or after incision and drainage. Quite often it is a delayed presentation and the child is brought for consultation when he begins to walk with a limp. On examination:-i) Limb is shortii) Hip movements are increased in all directions. iii) There is instability with positive telescoping.",

The femoral head at this stage is completely cartilaginous. If not treated early, the whole femoral head is destroyed, without any potential for a normal hip joint. Treatment - Urgent arthrotomy and lavage of the hip joint. Sample has to be obtained from the hip. either by aspiration or on arthrotomy, prior to starting on antibiotic, unless patient is toxic. Empirical antibiotics are started. Definitive antibiotic is started once organism culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing reports are available. ORGANISMS CAUSING SEPTIC ARTHRITIS AT DIFFERENT AGESInfants < 6 monthso Caused by wide range of organismso Broad spectrum bacteriocidal agent is required. o DOC-Cloxacillin, Methicillin, Kanamycin. 6 months to 2 yearso Most common organism is Haemophilias influenza. o DOC-Ampicillin.
