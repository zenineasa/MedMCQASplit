Stage of advanced ahritis: Fuher advancement of destruction and above clinical signs IV. Advanced ahritis with subluxation or dislocation. TB hip in HIV AVN hip in HIV Incidence More Common Less Common Deformity FABER-stage of synovitis may be prolonged on treatment, then subsequently with onset of ahritis - FADIR ensues. Limitation of abduction and internal rotation so initially position is adduction and external rotation (opposite to movements limited) and than subsequently with onset of ahritis FADIR ensues.
