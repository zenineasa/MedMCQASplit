If tingling and numbness develop in the distribution of median nerve, the test is positive. This is the most sensitive provocative test. Tourniquet test: - A pneumatic BP cuff is applied proximal to the elbow and inflated higher than the patient's systolic BP. The test is positive if there is paresthesia or numbness in the region of median nerve distribution in hand. Median nerve percussion test (Tine. Vs sign): - The median nerve is gently tapped at the wrist. The test is positive if there is tingling sensation. Median nerve compression test: - Direct pressure is exerted equally over both wrists by the examiner. If symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome appear, the test is positive.",

These two tendons belong to the first dorsal compartment.# Finkelstein's test is used to diagnose De-Quervairis tenosynovitis in people who have wrist pain.# To perform the test, the examining physician grasps the thumb and the hand is ulnar deviated sharply.
