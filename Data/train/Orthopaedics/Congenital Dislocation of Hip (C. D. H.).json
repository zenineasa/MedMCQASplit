Baily and Love 24th ed., Fig. 27. 34)DEVELOPMENTAL DYSPLASIA OF THE HIP (DDH)# This term is more accurate than the older congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH) because it includes dislocation along with other less severe forms, all of which have in common a dysplasia or natural shallowness of the acetabulum. The femoral neck is usually anteverted. Aetiology# A family history of DDH increases the risk up to 30 times.# The condition is five times more common in girls.# The left side is affected more commonly than the right.# Breech presentation, especially the extended position, firstborn children and caesarean section are associated with increased neonatal instability, possibly through restricted foetal movement.# Finally, it may be association with neuromuscular disease conditions and skeletal dysplasia. Diagnosis# Neonate- Clinical Barlow and Ortolani tests: The baby should be relaxed and the hips flexed to 90 degree. It is possible to reduce a dislocated hip by abduction and gentle forward pressure (Ortolani) or dislocate an unstable hip by adduction and gentle backward pressure (Barlow). In both cases a soft clunk is felt as the hip reduces or dislocates. The specificity of clinical neonatal examination is 100% (no false positives). However, its sensitivity is much lower.- Ultrasonography is most valuable test. It can detect not only displacement of the femoral head but also varying degrees of dysplasia.- X-rays are not generally reliable until approximately the age of 3 months.# Adult- Pain is again the usual complaint and X-rays may now show degenerative change as well as dysplasia.# Rx: Infant. Traction and surgery are not indicated. The hips can usually be reduced (Ortolani) and should then be held in a harness or splint for about 8 weeks. A baby, for example, aged 6 months. Would usually require preliminary traction followed by closed reduction augmented by soft-tissue release (psoas and/or adductor). Toddler and young childwith age, open reduction along with femoral or innominate osteotomy will be required. Adolescent or young adult. Those presenting with a painful dysplastic hip may require surgery. A realignment of the joint through pelvic or femoral osteotomy is only appropriate if there is a congruous hip joint. Otherwise (i. e., subluxation) the acetabulum has to be augmented by other means, for example shelf arthroplasty.",

B) Barlow's test is performed in a similar manner, but here the examiner's thumb is placed in the groin and, by grasping the upper thigh, an attempt is made to lever the femoral head in and out of the acetabulum during abduction and adduction.# If the femoral head is normally in the reduced position, but can be made to slip out of the socket and back in again, the hip is classed as 'dislocatable' (i. e. unstable).# This test is done within 2-3 days of birth.# The test has two parts:-i) Part 1:- Infant is in supine position with hip and knee in 90deg of flexion, The hip is slowly adducted & pushed to dislocate the hip and one can hear a clunck of exit of femoral head out of the acetabulum. ii) Part 2:- Now the hip is gentely abducted and pulled to reduce the hip.

POSTERIOR DISLOCATION OF HIP* It is most common type of hip dislocation in adults and children.* Usually this occurs in a road accident when someone seated in car is thrown forwards, striking the knee against the dashboard (dashboard injury)* It is the position (direction) of hip at the time of injury that decides the pattern of injury. Pattern of injury. Position of Hip at the time of Injury. Pure posterior dislocation. Flexion, adduction, internal rotation. Posterior fracture dislocation. Less flexion, less adduction (neutral or slight abduction), internal rotation. Anterior dislocation. Hyper abduction + Extension. Classification Schemes for Posterior Hip Dislocations. Thompson & Epstein. Type 1. Dislocations without or with minor fracture. Type IIDislocation with a single large fracture of posterior acetabular rim. Type IIIDislocation with comminution of posterior acetabular rim. Type IVDislocation with fracture of acetabular floor. Type VDislocation with fracture of femoral head Stewart and Miford. Type IDislocation without fracture. Type IIDislocation with posterior rim fracture (one or more fragments), but the hip is stable after reduction. Type IIIDislocation with fracture of rim producing gross instability. Type IVDislocation with fracture head or neck of femur. Type V thompson & Epstein is Subdivided by Pipkin into Four Types (Pipkin Classification)* Femoral head fracture caudal to fovea centralis* Femoral head fracture cephalad to the fovea* Femoral head fracture associated with femoral neck fracture* Type I, II, or III associated acetabular fracture. NOTE Thomson & Epstein, and Stewart & Milford are posterior dislocation injuries of hip and Pimpkins fracture is fracture of femoral head (& / or neck) in posterior dislocation injuries.",

        "exp": "Ans. b (Barlow test) (Ref Maheshwari orthopedics 4th/87). All newborn babies should be screened for hip instability by a skilled examiner using the Barlow and Ortolani tests. The baby should be relaxed and the hips flexed to 90 degree. It is possible to reduce a dislocated hip by abduction and gentle forward pressure (Ortolani) or dislocate an unstable hip by adduction and gentle backward pressure (Barlow). In both cases a soft clunk is felt as the hip reduces or dislocates repectively. DEVELOPMENTAL DISLOCATION (DYSPLASIA) OF THE HIP # Etiology:- Hereditary predisposition to jt laxity- Hormone induced jt laxity (in females)- Breech malposition# Pathology:- Femoral head dislocated upwards and laterally- Femoral neck is excessively anteverted- Acetabulum shallow- Ligamentum teres hypertrophy- Inverted limbus/fibrocartilaginous labrum of acetabulum- Stretched capsule of hip joint- Adaptive shortening of adductor muscles and hip joint, # Findings in older children:- Limitation of hip abduction- Asymmetrical thigh folds- Higher buttock fold on affected side- Galeazzi's sign (level of knees compared with hip fixed to 70deg and knees flexed)+.- Ortolani's test +.- Trendelenburg's test +.- Shortening of limb and externally rotated.- Lumbar lordosis- Telescopy +.- Trendelenburg's gait in unilateral; waddling gait in bilateral DDH.# Diagnosis:- Difficult during infancy, but USG with high frequency probe (Graff's classification) is very useful.- Clinical tests:# Barlow's test (provocative test having two parts)# Ortolani test# Radiological features:- Von Rosen's view helpful in diagnosis- Signs in older children:# Delayed appearance of ossific centre of head of femur# Retarded development of ossific centre of femoral head# Sloping acetabulum# Lateral and upward displacement of ossific centre of femoral head# Break in Shenton's line# Rx: Birth to 6 months6 months-6 yrs6 yrs-10 yrs11 yrs onwards.

Indeed, it is a very uncommon injury. o It is caused by forced abduction and lateral (external) rotation of hip, usually in a violent injury such as a motor accident on aircraft crash. o Clinically, the limb is in marked external (lateral) rotation, flexion and abduction. o There may be apparent lengthening due to abduction deformity, o Closed reduction under anaesthesia is the treatment of choice, o Complications are avascular necrosis, and secondary osteoarthritis.",
