Seven or greater amputation is generally the eventual result. Crush syndrome Limb is compressed for a prolonged period and after extended use of pneumatic antishock garment resulting in hypoperfusion and myonecrosis in the crushed limb. When the limb is released from the compression, toxic metabolites get released to cause reperfusion injury. Can result in a systemic reaction due to tissue necrosis. Free myoglobin can lead to acute tubular necrosis and renal failure. Myonecrosis can lead to metabolic acidosis with hyperkalaemia and hypocalcaemia.",
