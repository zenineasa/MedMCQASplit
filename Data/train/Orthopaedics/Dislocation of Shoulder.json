It is a rare type of dislocation caused by forceful hyper abduction. which causes the humerus to hitch on the acromion and the humeral head to be levered out of its socket and displace into the axilla. The patient presents with the arm held erect in hyper abduction. This is also called subglenoid variety. As the force is of high intensity, the soft tissue injuries are marked and includes avulsion of the capsule and surrounding tendons, rupture of muscles, fractures of the glenoid or proximal humerus and damage to the brachial plexus and axillary artery. The nerve commonly injured here is the axillary which has a short fixed course from the back of the plexus, around the medial side of the neck to the back - a course which makes it difficult for the nerve to escape traction when the humeral head is displaced. Axillary nerve involvement causes paralysis of the deltoid and the teres minor and loss of sensation of skin covering the lateral aspect of the inferior part of the deltoid regimental badge anaesthesia'.",

It is a fall on the outstretched hand w ith limb in lateral rotation, so that the head of the humerus is forced against the anterior capsule which is torn or avulsed from the glenoid labrum. It is not just an abduction injury but a lateral rotation injury as well. Thus the mechanism mav be said to be abduction and external rotation. Posterior dislocation of the shoulder - Mechanism of injuryA forceful medial rotation causes posterior dislocation. This is commonly seen in the bizarre position of the shoulder because of muscle spasm during epileptic attacks, severe electric shock and electro- convulsive therapy when muscle relaxants have not been used. Rarely a direct blow on the front of the shoulder can cause the head of the humerus to be pushed out posteriorly.",

Explanation: Light bulb appearance - Seen due to internal rotation of humeral head in posterior dislocation of the shoulder. When the humerus dislocates posteriorly, it also internally rotates such that the head contour projects like a light bulb when viewed in a shoulder AP radiograph. Anterior dislocation of shoulder occurs from excessive external rotation of the shoulder (especially in abduction). Risk factors of Posterior shoulder dislocation of the shoulder occurs from: o Excessive internal rotation, o Following seizure episode, o Following electrocution. o In both seizure and electrocution, excessive contraction of the stronger muscles of the upper back causes pull of the humeral head backward causing dislocation.* Normal appearance of shoulder in X-ray.* Light bulb appearance of humeral head in X-ray due to internal rotation of the humeral head in posterior dislocation.
