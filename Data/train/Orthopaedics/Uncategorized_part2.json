Therefore, meniscal injury cannot be possible in the extended position.\nIn flexed position, knee gets unlocked and rotation can occur in a flexed position. Therefore, meniscal injury occurs in a flexed position.\n\n\"The twisting movement, an important component of the mechanism of injury, is possible only with a flexed knee\". - Maheshwari\n\nSo, the meniscal injury is not possible if the knee cannot be flexed.",

This also includes pertrochantric, and transtrochantric fractures.\n\n\"The term trochanteric fracture may be used to describe any fracture in the region that lies between the greater and lesser trochanter. It is unnecessary to retain such terms as intertrochanteric and pertrochantric, which only lead to\u00a0confusion\".\u00a0\u2014Adam's\n\nThus; trochanteric, intertrochantric, pertrochantric and transtrochantric fractures; all are same.\n\nNow coming to question\n\nAs already mentioned previously, both intertrochanteric (Pertrochantric / transtrochantric / trochantric) fracture and basal fracture are extrapsular, and have same treatment. These fractures are more likely to be fixed with screw and plate (Dynamic hip screw).\nFracture of the transcervical and subcapital region of the femur can cause diruption to the blood supply to the head of the femur and are, therefore, more likely to require a hemiarthroplasty which involves the replacement of the\u00a0head of femur with a metal prosthesis. ______\u00a0Handbook of orthopaedics",

Clinical examination reveals oedema and shiny skin. What is the likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "COMPLEX REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME (ALGODYSTROPHY)\n\nSudeck, in 1900, described a condition characterized by painful osteoporosis of the hand. The same condition sometimes occurs after fractures of the extremities and for many years it was called Sudeck\u2019s atrophy. It is now recognized that this advanced atrophic disorder is the late stage of a post-traumatic reflex sympathetic dystrophy (also known as algodystrophy), which is much more common than originally believed (Atkins, 2003) and that it may follow a relatively trivial injury. Because of continuing uncertainty about its nature, the term complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) has been introduced. Two types of CRPS are recognized: \n\nTYPE 1\n\na reflex sympathetic dystrophy that develops after an injurious or noxious event. \n\nTYPE 2 \n\ncausalgia that develops after a nerve injury. The patient complains of continuous pain, often described as \u2018burning\u2019 in character. At first, there is local swelling, redness and warmth, as well as tenderness and moderate stiffness of the nearby joints. As the weeks go by the skin becomes pale and atrophic, movements are increasingly restricted and the patient may develop fixed deformities. X-rays characteristically show patchy rarefaction of the bone.",
