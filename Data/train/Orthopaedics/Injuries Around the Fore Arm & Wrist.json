Other fractures of the thumb. Rolando fracture. Comminuted intra-articular fracture-dislocation of the base of thumb [proximal first metacarpa). It can be thought of as a comminuted Bennett fracture. Rx: reduction and immobilization in thumb spica for 3 weeks. Epibasal thumb fracture (pseudo Bennett's fracture dislocation)are two piece fractures of the proximal first metacarpal bone. They are usually stable, depending on the degree of displacement, and often do not require surgery. It is important to distinguish them from intra-articular fractures (e. g. Bennett's fracture dislocation or Rolando fracture) which are usually unstable and require surgery. Gamekeeper's thumb (doesn't always include a fracture).

Such a fracture is often unstable, as the distal fragment is distracted by the unopposed abductor pollicis longus muscle, and may require surgical intervention. Rolando's fractureA fracture similar to Bennett's fracture with comminution of the metacarpal. This injury is actually less prone to displacement of the distal fragment due to the comminution of the thumb base and is less likely to require surgical fixation than is a Bennett's fracture. Game keeper's (skier's) thumb. Forced abduction of the thumb can result in disruption of the ulnar collateral ligament of the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP) of the thumb, a major stabilizer of the thumb. Boxer's fracture.
