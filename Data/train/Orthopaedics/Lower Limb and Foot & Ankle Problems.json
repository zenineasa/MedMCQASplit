        "question": "A newborn child presents with inverted foot and the dorsum of the foot cannot touch the anterior tibia. The most probable diagnosis is:",
        "exp": "Ans. c. CTEV (Ref: Apley's 9/e p291, 591-594; Turek's 6/e p658-661; Campbell's 11/e p1474-1475). The most probable diagnosis in a newborn child with inverted foot in whom the dorsum of the foot cannot touch the anterior tibia is CTEV. Congenital Talipes Equino. Varus (CTEV): Congenital deformity involving one foot or both. Affected foot appears rotated internally at the ankle. As heels are rotated internally patient is not able to touch tibia by dorsum of his foot. Congenital Vertical Talus (CVT): It is irreducible dorsal dislocation of the navicular on the talus with a fixed talo-navieular complex. CVT is a common cause of rigid flat foot, which can be isolated, or can occur with chromosomal abnormalities, myeloarthropathies (myelomeningocele) and neurologic disorders. Clinically talar head is prominent medially, sole is convex, forefoot is abducted and dorsiflexed, and the hind foot is equinovalgus. Sole of foot has a rocker-bottom (convex) deformity. Patients demonstrate peg-leg gait (awkward gait with limited forefoot push off). Arthrogryposis Multiplex Congenita: Rare congenital disorder that is characterized by multiple joint contractures and can include muscle weakness and fibrosis. It is a non-progressive disease. The disease derives its name from Greek, literally meaning 'curved or hooked joints'. Cerebral Palsy: Includes the group of non-progressive, non-contagious motor conditions that cause physical disability in human development, chiefly in the various areas of body movement. Divided into four major classifications to describe different movement impairments; also reflect the areas of the brain that are damaged. The four major classifications are: Spastic: MC type (70-80%). Ataxic: Caused by damage to the cerebellum (10%). Athetoid/dyskinetic: Mixed muscle tone, trouble holding in an upright, steady position for sitting or walking; often show involuntary motions. Hypotonic: Patients have musculature that is limp, and can move only a little or not at all. Congenital Talipes Equino. Varus (CTEV)/Club Foot. Congenital deformity involving one foot or both. Affected foot appears rotated internally at the ankle. As heels are rotated internally patient is not able to touch tibia by dorsum of his foot. CTE-V is classified into 2 groups: Postural TEV and Structural TEV. Incidence: 1 in 1, 000 live births: More common in males. Etiology and Associated Anomalies: Idiopathic (MC)Q; Secondary club foot. Secondary club foot* Neurological disorders and neural tube defectsQ (myelomeningocele and spinal dysraphism)* Paralytic disorder (due to muscular imbalance) as polio. spina bifidaQ, myelodysplasia, and Freidreich's ataxia* Arthrogryposis multiplexaQ* Larsen syndrome* Freeman-Sheldon (Mobius) syndrome* Diasirophic dwarfism* Sacral agenesis, tibial deficiency, constriction rings and amniotic bands* Fetal alcohol syndrome* Down's syndrome Deformities affecting joints of the foot in CTEV* Inversion at subtalar jointQ* Adduction at talonavicular jointQ* Equinus at ankle jointQ\"In. Ad. Equate\" for Inversion, Adduction and EquinusQ. Screening Methods: The foot of a newborn child normally can be dorsiflexed until the dorsal surface of foot touches the anterior aspect of shin of tibiaQ. It is a useful screening method for detecting the milder cases of CTEV, in which the foot cannot touch anterior tibia. Clinical Presentation: Classical appearance of CTEV is small size foot and small heel with characteristic CAVE deformity (Cavus, Adduction, Varus, Equinus) i. e. heel in equinuis with foot inverted on end of tibia giving the foot an upside down club appearance. Inability to bring the foot in opposite directions to deformity. Deep skin creases on medial side of foot and back of heel. Outer side of foot is convex and contains bony prominences (e. g. head of talus) and dimples. Prognosis: Prognosis of non-idiopathic syndromic club foot is generally worse than that for an idiopathic club foot, although there are certain exceptions like Down's syndrome or Larsen's syndrome: in which because of significant ligamentous laxity underlying the syndrome itself, correction may be achieved with non-operative treatment. Management of CTEVConservative management. Operative management* Clubfoot always requires treatment, which should begin at birthQ.* Manipulation should be frequently repeated, and after manipulation some form of splint or cast must be usedQ.* In the first month of life, manipulation should be repeated 6 times at each nappy change and adhesive strapping which maintains the correctionQ.* In place of strapping, splintage (Dennis Brown Splint) and even casting usually at one-week interval in the first month of lifeQ can also be used.* In infants >1 month, corrective manipulations and above knee cast (from toe to groin) is applied for 2 weeks.* Delaying surgery is suitable for severe, rigid deformities; for less severe cases it may be preferable to operate at around 6 months of ageQ.* Posteromedial soft tissue release is best done at 6 months-3 yearsQ.* Triple arthrodesis is necessary for recurrent or persistent club foot deformity in older children (chronic cases)Q. It is best done at 10-12 years of age when foot growth is completeQ. Pseudoarthrosis (most commonly of talonavicular joint) is commonest complicationQ. Kite's Method. Ponseti Method (Method of choice)6 months-3 years. Posteromedial soft tissue release. Order of correction of deformity:* Adduction of forefoot* Inversion (varus) of heel / hind foot and inversion (supination) of fore /mid foot* Equinus (plantar flexion) of ankle. Order of correction of deformity:* Cavus* Adductus* Varus* Equinus4-10 years. Revision of soft tissue release together with shortening of lateral side of foot by:* Lichtblau's Procedure (<6 years)* Even-Dillwyn Procedure (>6 years)>10-12 years. Triple arthrodesisQ",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e.. Osteochondritis of femoral epiphysis Perthe's diseaseo Perthe's disease is also known as osteochondritis deformans juvenilis or Coxa plana or Pseudocoxalgia. Perthe's disease is an osteochondritis of the epiphysis of the femoral head (capital femoral epiphysis). In the disease, the femoral head becomes partly or wholly avascular and deformed. The disease occurs commonly in males in the age group of 5-10years. Etiology of Perthe's diseaseo Perthe's disease is the most common form of osteochondroses (osteochondroses are characterized by avascular necrosis (AVN) and defective endochondral ossification of primary or secondary ossification centers), o The etiology remains unknown, but is currently accepted that the disorder is caused by an interruption of the blood supply to the capital femoral epiphysis, causing avascular necrosis. Clinical features of Perthes diseaseo Perthes disease is common in male of age group 5-10 years. o Pain in the hip, often radiating to knee, o Limp (antalgic limp)o Limitation of movement. Abduction, internal rotation and extension are limited, therefore there is adduction, external rotation, and flexion deformity, o Shortening of limb. o Positive trendelenburg test. o During the disease process, bone age is 1-3 years lower than the normal. After healing, bone age returns tonormal. Radiological investigations for Perthe's diseaseo Following radiological investigations are used:-X-ray hip. Findings are:-Increased medial joint space. Widening of femoral neck. Lateral extrusion (lateral subluxation). Metaphyseal cysts and rarefaction of metaphysis. Horizontal physis with speckled calcification lateral to it. Fragmentation of femoral head with increased density (irregular densities in the epiphysis). Bone scan. May show a decrease uptake by femoral head. MRIIt is the investigation of choice as it can diagnose Perthes disease in early stages when X-ray is normal. MRI tells about:-Extent of area involved. Sphericity of the head. Subluxation of the head. Thus MRI helps better in planning for management. Treatment of Perthe's diseaseo Preventing the head from mis-shapening while the bone is in softening phase, is the primary aim of the treatment, o The head is required to be kept inside the acetabulum while the revascularisation takes place (head containment). o This may be achieved by conservative methods (plaster, splint etc) or by operation (containment osteotomy).",
