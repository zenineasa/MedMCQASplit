Ankylosing spondylitis (marie-strumpell disease)o Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease of the sacroiliac joints and the axial skeleton, o Prototype of seronegative (absence of rheumatoid factor) spondyloarthropathies, o Inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. o Usually begins in the second or third decade with a median age of 23, in 5% symptoms begin after 40. o Male to female ratio is 2-3: 1o Strong correlation with HLA-B27o 90-95% of cases are positive for HLA - B27. Joints involved in ankylosing spondylitiso Ankylosing spondylitis primarily affects axial skeleton. o The disease usually begins in the sacro-iliac joints and usually extends upwards to involve the lumbar, thoracic, and often cervical spine. o In the worst cases the hips or shoulders are also affected. Hip joint is the most commonly affected peripheral joint, o Rarely knee (Ebenzar 4th/6 593) and ankle (Apley's 9th/e 67) are also involved. Pathologyo Enthesitis i. e. inflammation of the insertion points of tendons, ligaments or joint capsule on bone is one of the hallmarks of this entity of disease. o Primarily affects axial (spinal) skeleton and sacroiliitis is often the earliest manifestation of A. S.. o Involvement of costovertebral joints frequently occur, leading to diminished chest expansion (normal > 5 cm)o Peripheral joints e. g. shoulders, and hips are also involved in l/3rd patients. o Extraarticular manifestations like acute anterior uveitis (in 5%); rarely aortic valve disease, carditis and pulmonary fibrosis also occur. o Pathological changes proceed in three stages-Inflammation with granulation tissue formation and erosion of adjacent bone. Fibrosis of granulation tissue. Ossification of the fibrous tissue, leading to ankylosis of the joint. Radiological features of ankylosing spondylitiso Radiographic evidence of sacroiliac joint is the most consistent finding in ankylosing spondylitis and is crucial for diagnosis. The findings are. Sclerosis of the articulating surfaces of SI joints. Widening of the sacroiliac joint space. Bony ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints. Calcification of the sacroiliac ligament and sacro-tuberous ligaments. Evidence of enthesopathy - calcification at the attachment of the muscles, tendons and ligaments, particularly around the pelvis and around the heel. o X-ray of lumbar spine may show. Squaring of vertebrae: The normal anterior concavity of the vertebral body is lost because of calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament. Loss of the lumbar lordosis.

In 60% of cases, the infection remains subclinical; the clinical spectrum in the remainder of cases differs in certain respects from that of acquired late syphilis in the adult. For example, cardiovascular syphilis rarely develops in late congenital syphilis, whereas interstitial keratitis is much more common and occurs between the ages of 5 and 25. other manifestations include eighth-nerve deafness and recurrent arthropathy. Bilateral knee effusions are known as Clutton's joints. Asymptomatic neurosyphilis is present in about one-third of untreated patients, and clinical neurosyphilis occurs in one-quarter of untreated individuals >6 years old. Gummatous periostitis occurs between the ages of 5 and 20 and, as in nonvenereal endemic syphilis, tends to cause destructive lesions of the palate and nasal septum.",

        "question": "A 68 yr. old man came with pain and swelling of right knee. Ahlback grade 2 osteoarthritic changes were found on investigation. What is the further management?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e. Conservative Initial management of most of the patients of knee OA is conservative or non-operative. Campbell operative orthopaedics writes - \"Osteoarthritis of the knee can cause symptoms ranging from mild to disabling. Initial management of most patients should be nonoperative\". Surgical management is needed when the conservative management fails. Surgical management in brief: The choice of surgical procedure depends on the patient's age and activity demand, severity of the disease and the number of knee compartments involved. Arthroscopic washout or debridement: It consists of trimming of degenerate meniscal tissue and osteophytes. It may delay the need for a more definitive procedure, especially in younger, active patients with localised degenerative arthritis that causes pain at rest without malalignment or instability. It may also be considered in active, older adults with mild to moderate OA Realignment osteotomy: High or proximal tibial osteotomy (HTO)-High tibial osteotomy is a procedure for the treatment of unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee (medial or lateral compartment osteoarthritis; usually it is medial; lateral compartment osteoarthritis is uncommon). Medial osteoarthritis is associated with varus deformity of the knee. Varus deformity causes stresses to be concentrated medially, accelerating degenerative changes in the medial part of the joint (similarly if the deformity is of valgus position, changes are accelerated in the lateral part). The biomechanical rationale for proximal tibial osteotomy in patients with unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee is \"unloading\" of the involved joint compartment by correcting the malalignment and redistributing the stresses on the knee joint. Thus medial osteoarthritis is treated by a varus correcting osteotomy (k/a valgus osteotomy) and the uncommon lateral osteoarthritis corrected by valgus correcting osteotomy (k/a varus osteotomy). According to Ebnezar (3/e p547) High tibial osteotomy is done for varus deformity less than 15deg and valgus deformity less than 12deg. Supracondylar or distal femoral osteotomy- - distal femoral osteotomy is done for correction of valgus deformity more than 12 to 15deg (Ref: Campbell's Orthopaedics 11/e chapter 25). Total knee arthroplasty: It is done for older patients with advanced OA that causes incapacitating pain and disability or young patients with tricompartmental (medial and lateral tibio femoral and patellofemoral) disease. But it should be delayed in young patients as long as possible as prostheses may wear out over time and may need further revision surgery. Unicompartmental arthroplasty: In carefully selected patients with either medial or lateral osteoarthritis, it is becoming a viable alternative to TKA and HTO. Knee arthrodesis: Arthrodesis is indicated less commonly than arthroplasty. If the patient is young and involved in heavy occupation, arthrodesis is indicated to give him a stable and strong knee. This procedure provides permanent pain relief and allows the patient to return to durable, active work. However arthrodesis results in a stiff knee which is a severe disability. Ahlback's grading of osteoarthritis. Ahlback's grading is radiological grading of osteoarthritis. Standard textbooks of Orthopaedics (Campbell, Turek, Apley's) and of Radiology (Grainger, Sutton, Greenspan's Orthopedic Imaging) do not mention anything about it. Treatment of osteoarthritis depends on symptoms and clinical profile of pt and not on radiological grading. Still we are describing the grading below. Grading of osteoarthritis. Apart from Ahlback grading, other commonly used grading system is by Kellgren and Lawrence. The two grading system are compared as follows: Classification of knee OAAhlback. Kellgren and Lawrence. Grade. Definition. Grade. Definition Grade 1 \"doubtful\"Minute osteophytes doubtful significant Grade 2 \"minimal\"Definite osteophytes (unimpaired air space). Grade 1. Joint space narrowing (<3 mm). Grade 3 \"moderate\"Moderate diminution of joint spaces. Grade 2. Joint space obliteration. Grade 4 \"severe\"Joint space great impaired with sclerosis of subchondral bone. Grade 3. Minor bone attrition (0-5 mm). Grade 4. Same as above. Grade 4. Moderate bone attrition (5-10 mm). Grade 4. As above. Grade 5. Severe bone attrition (> 10 mm). Grade 4. As above. Note- Grade 1 of Ahlback is equivalent to grade 3 of Kellgren and Lawrence& grade 2, 3, 4&5 of Ahlback is equivalent to grade 4 of Kellgren and Lawrence. It must be noted that the radiological grading may not correlate with clinical symptomology of the patients. The treatment is based on the symptoms of patient (and not merely on radiographic appearances)",

Ankylosing spondylitis* Involvement of the lumbar spine and the classical Bamboo spine appearance points towards the diagnosis of Ankylosing spondylitis.* A close differential diagnosis remains to be DISH. See the table below to differentiate the two conditions. Ankylosing spondylitis. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Sex/age. Common in males of 15-40 years of age. Common in males in 5th to 6th decade. Etiology. It is chronic progressive inflammatory seronegative spondyloarthropathy. It is a form of degenerative arthritis. Pathogenesis. The primary site of pathology in ankylosing spondylitis is the enthesis (site of attachment of tendons and ligaments to bone). Ossification also occurs in the ligaments that are ending up as enthesis, especially the ligaments of the spine that gradually get ossified, progressively leading to stiffness. Characterized by ossification at sites of tendon, ligaments and joint capsule insertion (enthesitis) anterior longitudinal ligament of the spine is most commonly involved. Distribution. SI joint, lumbar spine (eventually whole spine), the hip joint is commonly involved. Marked predilection to the axial skeleton; mainly involve thoracic spine. Course. All patients invariably present early with pain and stiffness of back. It is usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. SI joint. Bilateral, symmetrical involvement (sacroiliitis). In late cases, erosion may cause pseudo widening of the SI joints. Not involved. ESRElevated. Normal. HLA B27. Positive in 90% cases. Negative. Disability. Marked disability of the spine and hip joints in advanced cases. Usually no disabilityX-ray features. Bamboo spine, squaring of vertebrae, syndesmophytes.
