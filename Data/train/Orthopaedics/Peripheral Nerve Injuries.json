        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Median nerve f Ref: Basics of orthopaedics 2nd/e p. 718]. Carpal tunnel syndromeo Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common and widely known entrapment neuropathy in which the body's peripheral nerve is compressed or traumatized. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the median nerve is compressed in the carpal tunnel below flexor retinaculum. The carpal tunnel is a narrow rigid passage way of ligament and bones at the base of hand, in front of distal part of wrist. Carpal tunnel houses the median nerve and 9 tendons (4 FDS, 4 FDP & FPL). Causes of carpal tunnel syndromeo There are many causes of carpal tunnel syndrome: -Idiopathic: - This is the most common cause. Pregnancy and menopause. Metabolic: - Gout, Diabetes mellitus4} Endocrine: - Hypothyroidism, Myxedema, Acromegaly, Hyperparathyroidism. Deposition disorder Amyloidosis, Sarcoidosis, Rheumatid arthritis, Leukemia, CRF, Nlucopoly saccharoidosis. Alcoholism. Local causes: - Malunited colie's fracture, osteo-arthritis of the carpal bones, synovitits of flexor tendon sheath, hematoma. Clinical features of carpal tunnel syndromeo Carpal tunnel syndrome is more common in women and occurs between 35-50years. o Symptoms usually start gradually, writh frequent burning, tingling, paresthesia and numbness in the distribution of median nerve, i. e., lateral three & half of fingers and lateral 2/3rd of palm, o The symptoms often first appear during night, since many people sleep with flexed wrists. (Flexion decreases the space in carpal tunnel which results in increased pressure over median nerve), o Sensory symptoms can often be reproduced by percussing over median nerve (Tinel's sign) or by holding the wrist fully flexed for a minute (Pltalen's test). o As the disease progresses, clumsiness of hand and impairment of digital function develop, o Later in the disease, there is sensory loss in median nerve distribution and obvious wasting of thenar eminence. Clinical Tests for Carpal tunnel syndromeo There are some provocative tests which act as important screening methods: -Wrist flexion (Phalen's test): - The patient is asked to actively place the wrist in complete flexion. If tingling and numbness develop in the distribution of median nerve, the test is positive. This is the most sensitive provocative test. Tourniquet test: - A pneumatic BP cuff is applied proximal to the elbow' and inflated higher than the patient's systolic BP. The test is positive if there is paresthesia or numbness in the region of median nerve distribution in hand. Median nerve percussion test (Ttnel's sign): - The median nerv e is gently tapped at the wrist. The test is positive if there is tingling sensation.; Median nerve compression test: - Direct pressure is exerted equally over both wrists by the examiner. If symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome appear, the test is positive.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Decreased CAMP amplitudes * The specific features of segmental demyelination of nerve on nerve conduction studies are:# Conduction Block# Decreased Compound Muscle Action Potentials (CAMP) amplitudes due to abnormal temporal dispersion of CAMP.* Following are the findings of demyelinating lesions on Nerve Conduction Studies: Demyelinating injuriesA) Uniform Demyelinating: In uniform demyelinating lesions, nerve conduction studies (NCS) will be slowed throughout the nerve because the entire nerve is affected. Distal latencies will be prolonged, again because of the uniform slowing (distal latencies representing the most distal conduction velocity). Amplitdes should not be significantly affected, because the axons are intact and the slowing is consistent through all fiber of the nerve. B) Segmental Demyelination: Because there is variable slowing or different nerve fibers withing the nerve, conduction velocity will be slowed and distal latencies will be prolonged in segmentally demyelinatiing injuries. CMAP amplitudes may be decreased because of temporal dispersion, not because of axonal damage. Therefore, the CMAP may be longer in duration. However, the area under the CMAP will be normal. C) Focal Demyelination: In focal demyelination, only one segment of the nerve is affected. Therefore velocity will be normal unless stimulation is across the area of focal demyeclination In this segment, you will see slowing of conduction velocity. Slowing is usually evident if there is a more than 10 m/sec drop in conduction velocity across the segment, compared to the distal or proximal segments. Distal latencies and all amplitudes should be norma. D) Conduction Block: As stated earlier, conduction block is a focal demyelination that is so severe that the action potential cannot propagate past that point. Therefore, distal latencies and conduction velocities remain normal. Distal amplitudes will be normal. However, when the nerve is stimulated across the area of conduction block, a drop in amplitude is noted. To be considered significant, this drop in proximal amplitude should be more than 20% of the distal amplitude. For example if the distal amplitude is 10 m V and proximal amplitude is 7 m V, conduction block should be considered.",

Ref Apley's, 8 th/e page 252, Nelson 16th/e page 2061, Anderson's patho page - 2489H/O of burning pain in the plantar aspect of the foot suggest the diagnosis of tarsal tunnel syndrome. Tarsal Tunnel syndrome. It is caused by the compression of posterior tibial nerve behind and below medial malleolus. Aggravating factors are. Prolonged weight bearing. Space occupying lesions such as ganglioma, hemangioma or varicosity. Symptoms are. Pain and sensory disturbances over the plantar surface of the foot. Pain is often worse at night and patient may seek relief by walking around or stamping his or her foot. Some students had confusion regarding the character of pain in Tarsal tunnel syndrome. Make it clear that neurological pain are usually burning in character (Harrison). About other options. Tarsal coalition. It represents a congenital fusion or failure of segmentation between two or more tarsal bones. Most commonly it occurs between. Medial talocalcaneal bones. Calcaneonavicular bones. It is also known as peroneal spastic flatfoot. It can be easily ruled out as the pain is typically localized in the dorsal foot along the lateral malleolus and is precipitated by walking. More over the main symptom is limitation of joint movement. Plantar fibromatosis -It can be easily ruled out as the main symptom in presence of nodules in the plantar aspect of foot. Presence of pain is unusual. Peripheral vascular disease. In peripheral vascular disease the usual site of pain is not the plantar aspect of foot. Pain many occur in toe (or feet too) but the usual sites are distal to location of the occlusive lesions which are usually thigh and calf region.

Seddon's classification of nerve injurieso Seddon identified three types of injuries: 1) Neuropraxia# There is contusion of the peripheral nerve which causes reversible physiological nerve conduction block. The axis cylinder (i. e., axon with its endoneurium) is preserved. Thus, there is physiological conduction block without anatomic disruption. The injury is temporary and recovery is complete. It is seen in crutchpalsy, tourniquet palsy, and Saturday night palsy. 2) Axonotemesis# There is injury to axon but endoneurium is preserved. Spontaneous recovery is expected in some cases. This is seen in closed fractures and dislocations. 3) Neurotemesis# There is complete anatomical section of nerve. No recovery possible. It is seen in open wound.

Which of the following additional clinical findings would be present in this patient?",
        "exp": "Answer: b) Inability to oppose the thumb to other digits. Patient is suffering from \"carpal tunnel syndrome\". It is a medical condition in which the median nerve is compressed as it passes through the carpal tunnel deep to the flexor retinaculum at the wrist. The patient's occupation as typist may have predisposed the patient to this condition. MEDIAN NERVE \"labourer's nerve\" (C5, C6, C7, C8, T1). Formed from the branches of medial and lateral cord of brachial plexus. No branches to axilla & arm. Sensory Supply. Palmar aspect:- Lateral half of Palm & Lateral 31/2 fingers with their nail beds. Dorsal aspect: - distal part of later 31/2 fingers Motor Supply. Forearm: All flexors except flexor carpi ulnaris and medial half of flexor digitorum profundus. Hand: Ist two lumbricals (1st & 2nd lumbricals), thenar muscles except adductor pollicis (Supplied by ulnar nerve). Injuries to Median nerve: At elbow. Pointing Index (detected by Oschner clasping test). Simian/Ape thumb deformity (Thenar muscles wasted). Pen test. At wrist: Abduction & Opposition of thumb is lost. Median Nerve- Commonly injured in cut injury at flexor retinaculum. Commonly gets involved in entrapment neuropathy (carpal tunnel syndrome). Tests of median nerve lesion: Tinel's sign- percussion of flexor retinaculum -> tingling sense in the distribution of median N. Phalen's test- hyperextension/ flexion aggravates pain & paresthesia. Cuff compression test of Gilliatt & Wilson- BP cuff is inflated above systolic BP-> aggravates pain & paresthesia. CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROMEMost common upper extremity compressive neuropathy. Neuropathy caused by compression of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel. The floor of the tunnel is formed by the volar radiocarpal and intercarpal ligaments. The transverse carpal ligament forms the roof of the tunnel. 9 long flexors of the wrist and fingers and median nerve run within this spatially limited and relatively rigid tunnel. Etiology: PRAGMATICP-PregnancyR-Rheumatoid arthritisA-Arthritis degenerativeG-Growth hormone abnormalities (acromegaly)M-Metabolic (gout, diabetes myxedema, etc)A-AlcoholismT-Tumorsl-ldiopathicC- Connective tissue disorders (e. g. amyloidosis). Thus, any increase in pressure within the tunnel compresses the injury-prone median nerve. A decrease in thenar muscle strength occurs, along with a numbness or a decrease in the sensibility of the palmar surface of the radial 3 1/2 digits, especially the middle and index fingers. Initial stage: Dull pain in the arm at night (brachialgia paresthetica nocturna). Wakes the patient from sleep and can be relieved by shaking and massaging the arms. Stiff & uncoordinated fingers for a short time after the patient wakes up in the morning. Advanced stage: Abnormal sensations (paresthesia) develop. Sense of touch is impaired, mainly in the thumb and index finger. The Phalen wrist flexion sign or Phalen maneuver is positive in carpal tunnel syndrome. Inability to oppose the thumbs. Emaciation of thenar eminence. Paresthesia, hypoesthesia, or anesthesia of lateral three and a half digits. Sensation in the central palm remains unaffected. TESTS: Provocative testing includes Phalen's test, Tinel's test at the wrist, or the carpal tunnel compression test (Durkan's test). The carpal tunnel compression test is generally regarded as the most sensitive. The most predictable sensory test to evaluate carpal tunnel syndrome is the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test.",
