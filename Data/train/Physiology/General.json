        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., -55 mv * The action potential, which is recorded using an intracellular electrode, has following phases : -1) Resting stage:# This is the resting membrane potential before the action potential. At rest, membrane is said to be \"polarized\" because - 70 mV negative membrane potential (RMP) that is present. Strictly speaking, it is not a part of the action potential.2) Depolarization phase:# The potential shoots up to + 35 mV in less than a millisecond. It is due to opening of \"voltage gated\" Na+ channels which causes influx of sodium, so inside negative charge becomes positive.# From -70 mV to -55 mV (firing Ivel or threshold point) the voltage gated sodium channles open partially. This portion of AP (-70 mV to -55 mV) is called \"prepotential\" or \"foot ofAP\".# Once the threshold level (-55 mV) is reached voltage gated Na+ channels open completely and the potential shoots up suddenly. It is called depolarization, since it represents loss of the original polarity of cell membrane.3) Repolarization phase:# The potential drops to near resting level, i.e., reversal to original polarity (repolarization). At the start of repolarization (end of depolarization), Voltage - gated Na+ channels close and Voltage - gated K+ channels open which cause efflux of K+ out of the cell. So, inside positive charge once again becomes negative due to efflux of positive charge (K+).4) After depolarization:# The repolarization is very fast till 70% of repolarization has been acheived. After that it is slows down. This slower phase of repolarization is called 'after depolarization\\5) After-hyperpolarization:# During repolarization phase K+ channels open and there is K+ efflux. The membrane voltage falls back (repolarizes) to resting potential, i.e., -70 mV. At this voltage, K+ channels close, but quite slowly.# Therefore, more K+ ions leak out, causing a brief period in which the voltage falls below -70 mV, i.e. hyperplorization. Then, K+/Na+ pump works to re-establish resting potential by pumping Na+ ions back out and K+ ions back into the cells.",

Due to presence of potassium leak channels K+ ions are freely permeable but permeability of Na+ is much less. In the generation of RMP, following sequence of events occur: -i) K+ diffuses out of cell along its concentration gradient (K+ concentration is very high inside the cells and very low in ECF).ii) The diffusion of K+ produces an intracellular negativity (due to non-diffusibleprotein anion in the cells) which is not nullified by the diffusion of Na+ in the opposite direction (membrane is impermeable to Na+) or diffusion of Cl- in same direction (Cl- concentration is already very high in ECF in comparison to ICF).iii) So, intracellular negativity is produced which opposes outward diffusion of K+ and when the equilibrium is reached, the inward force on K+ due to electrical gradient balances outward force on K+ due to concentation gradient.iv) Finally, at equilibrium inner side of cell is negatively charged with respect to outer side, and resting membrane potential is produced.* So, the RMP is principally due to concentration difference (chemical difference) of K+ in ECF and ICF. In neurons, the resting membrane potential is usually about -70 mV, which is close to the equilibrium potential for K+. Here, it is worth noting that RMP is close to the equilibrium potential of K+ but the value of RMP is exactly same as equilibrium potential of Cl~. It is because other ions also diffuse through membrane, though their effect is very little.",

When carrier proteins move substances in the direction of their chemical or electrical gradients, no energy input is required and the process is called facilitated diffusion.- A typical E.g. is glucose transport by the glucose transporter, which moves glucose down its concentration gradient from the ECF to the cytoplasm of the cell.# B] Other carriers transport substances against their electrical and chemical gradients. This form of transport requires energy and is called active transport.- E.g. 1. ATPases is Na+-K+ ATPase pump.- 2. H+-K+ ATPases in the gastric mucosa and the renal tubules.- 3. Ca2+ ATPase pumps Ca2+ out of cells.- 4. Proton ATPases acidify many intracellular organelles, including Golgi complex and lysosomes.# Some of the transport proteins are called uniports, because they transport only one substance.# Others are called symports, because transport requires the binding of more than one substance to the transport protein and the substances are transported across the membrane together.- E.g. symport in the intestinal mucosa responsible for the cotransport by facilitated diffusion of Na+ and glucose from the intestinal lumen into mucosal cells.# Other transporters are called antiports because they exchange one substance for another.# C]. Some transport proteins are simple aqueous ion channels; many of these have special features that make them effective for a given substance such as Ca2+ or, in the case of aquaporins, for water. Many transport proteins are continuously open, and some are gated. Some are gated by alterations in membrane potential (voltage-gated), whereas others are opened or closed when they bind a ligand (ligand-gated).- A typical voltage-gated channel is the Na+ channel, and a typical ligand-gated channel is the acetylcholine receptor.- A ligand is often external (eg, a neurotransmitter or a hormone).- However, it can also be internal; intracellular Ca2+, cAMP, lipids, or one of the G proteins produced in cells can bind directly to channels and activate them.",

        "question": "False statement about the following cellular phenomenon is?",
        "exp": "Ans. B. Clathrin mediated endocytosis is involved in taking up of dead tissue and bacteriaa. Endocytosis is the reverse of exocytosis. There are various types of endocytosis named for the size of particles being ingested as well as the regulatory requirements for the particular process. These include phagocytosis, pinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolae-dependent uptake, and non clathrin/non caveolae endocytosis.b. Phagocytosis (\"cell eating\") is the process by which bacteria, dead tissue, or other bits of microscopic material are engulfed by cells such as the polymorphonuclear leukocytes of the blood. The material makes contact with the cell membrane, which then invaginate. The invagination is pinched off, leaving the engulfed material in the membrane- enclosed vacuole and the cell membrane intact. Pinocytosis (\"cell drinking\") is a similar process with the vesicles much smaller in size and the substances ingested are in solution. The small size membrane that is ingested should not be misconstrued; cells undergoing active pinocytosis (eg, macrophages) can ingest the equivalent of their entire cell membrane in just 1 hour.c. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis occurs at membrane indentations where the protein clathrin accumulates. Clathrin molecules have the shape of triskelion's, with three \"legs\" radiating from a central hub. As endocytosis progresses, the clathrin molecules form a geometric array that surrounds the endocytotic vesicle. At the neck of the vesicle, the GTP binding protein dynamin is involved, either directly or indirectly, in pinching off the vesicle. Once the complete vesicle is formed, the clathrin falls off and the three-legged proteins recycle to form another vesicle. The vesicle fuses with and dumps its contents into an early endosome.d. From the early endosome, a new vesicle can bud off and return to the cell membrane. Alternatively, the early endosome can become a late endosome and fuse with a lysosome in which the contents are digested by the lysosomal proteases. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is responsible for the internalization of many receptors and the ligands bound to them including, for example, nerve growth factor and low-density lipoproteins. It also plays a major role in synaptic function.",

The abnormal impulses are seen as spontaneous (yet triggered) depolarizations that occur during either phase 3 or 4 of an action potential (called \"afterdepolarizations\"). Triggered activity is more likely to occur when the action prolonged action potential manifested as a long Q-T interval on the electrocardiogram (long Q-T syndrome). Drugs that prolong the action potential duration, such as potassium-channel blockers (class III antiarrhythmics) can sometimes precipitate triggered activity.* After depolarizations can be either early or delayed. Early afterdepolarizations occur during late phase 2 or phase 3 and can lead to a salvo of several rapid action potentials or a prolonged series of action potentials. This form of triggered activity is more likely to occur when the action potential duration is increased. Therefore, drugs that decrease action potential duration (e.g., lidocaine) are often effective against tachyarrhythmias generated by this mechanism. Calcium channel blockers, by decreasing gCa++ can also be effective in their treatment.* Delayed afterdepolarizations occur in late phase 3 or early phase 4 when the action potential is nearly of fully repolarized. The mechanism is poorly understood; however, this type of arthythmia is found to be associated with high intracellular Ca++ concentrations as occurs with digitalis toxicity or excessive catecholamine stimulation. The triggered impulse can lead to a series of rapid depolarizations (i.e. a tachyarrhythmia).",

Plasma albumin accounts for most of the anion gap.* The urine anion gap provides an indirect way of estimating the urinary NH4+.

The activity of telomerase is repressed by regulatory proteins, which restrict telomere elongation, then providing a length sensing mechanism. Telomerase activity is expressed in germ cells and is present at low levels in stem cells, but is usually absent in most somatic tissues.When somatic cells replicate, a small section of telomere is not duplicated and telomeres become progressively shortened. Shortened telomeres are proposed to signal a growth check point allowing cells to become senescent. Conversely in immortal cancer cells, telomerase is reactivated and telomeres are not shortened, suggesting that telomere elongation might be an important, possibly essential step in tumor formation",

(Fall when sympathetic activity is high) Yoga- increases Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)Galvanic Skin Response or Eiectrodermal Response (EDR), Psychogalvanic Reflex (PGR), or Skin conductance response (SCR)It is measure of electrical resistance as a reflection of changes in emotional arousal, taken by attaching electrodes to any part of the skin and recording changes in moment-to- moment perspiration and related activity of the autonomic nervous system.The response appears as an increase in the electrical conductance of the skin (a decrease in resistance) across the palms of the hands or soles ofthe feet. It appears about two seconds after stimulation, as by a pinprick or threat of injury; it rises to a maximum after two to ten seconds and subsides at about the same rateDue to the response of the skin and muscle tissue to external and internal stimuli, the resistance can vary. When correctly calibrated, the GSR can measure these subtle differences. There is a relationship between sympathetic activity1 and emotional arousal, although one cannot identify the specific emotion being elicited. The GSR is highly sensitive to emotions in some people. Fear, anger, startle response, orienting response and sexual feelings are all among the emotions which may produce similar GSR responses. These reactions have allowed lie detectors to have some successYoga- increases Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)QUse of Galvanic Skin ResponseGSR measurement is one component of polygraph devices and is used in scientific research of emotional arousal.The E-meter, which is used by the Church of Scientology, is a GSR measurement device.GSR measurement is also becoming commonplace in hypnotherapy and psychotherapy practice where it can be used as a method of detecting depth of hypnotic trance prior to suggestion therapy commencing. When traumatic material is experienced by the client (for example, during hypnoanalysis), immediate changes in galvanic skin response can indicate that the client is experiencing emotional arousal. It is also used in behavior therapy to measure physiological reactions such as fear.The most well-known use for measuring this response is as a part of a polygraph or \"lie detector\" test. The reaction of the body is measurable by this and many other parameters, when a person tells a lie. Knowingly stating a falsehood is, in a physiological sense, stressful and unnatural, A change in the electrical conductivity ofthe skin, as well as changes in breathing, heartbeat, and perspiration, is one of the body's responses to the stress of lying.# Measuring the galvanic skin response can also be an important element of certain psychotherapy treatments, as well as behavioral therapy. Research studies involving stress and anxiety levels have also been carried out with attention to this response.",

The carrier proteins involved in active transport are called ion pumps.* There are two types of active transport: -1) Primary active transport:# In primary active trasnport, the energy is derived directly from hydrolysis (breakdown) of ATP (or related molecule). The most important example is Na+K+ pump (Na+K+ ATPase).2) Secondary active transport:# In secondary active transport, the energy is derived from the store which has been created originally by primary active transport. Secondary active transport represents a combination of primary active transport and facilitated diffusion.# It is exemplified by glucose transport across intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, the Na+K+ pump operates at the basolateral border of the cell and maintains intracellular concentration of Na+ very low. The low intracellular Na+ concentration provides the necessory concentration gradient for Na+ to diffuse in passively at the luminal border through facilitated cotransport with glucose. Thus, the Na+K+ pump (Na+K+ ATPase) indirectly powers the movement of glucose into the cell, and glucose can move in against a concentration gradient so long as Na+ diffuses in along a concentration gradient.# It is important to know that at luminal border, Na+ is transported by facilitated diffusion (as it diffuses along a concentration gradient) while the glucose is transported actively (against a concentration gradient) and the energy is provided by Na+K+ ATPase at basolateral border - So, secondary active transport is a combination of active transport (glucose transport against concentration gradient) and facilitated diffusion (Na+ transport along concentration gradient by carrier protein).",

That is when the membrane of a nerve fiber is stimulated this causes slight leakage of sodium ions through sodium channels in the nerve membrane to the fiber's interior. The sodium ions entering the fiber than change the membrane potential. Which in turn causes more opening of channels, more change of potential still more opening of the channels and so forth. Thus, a slight leak becomes an explosion of sodium entering the interior of the nerve fiber which creates the nerve action potential. This action potential in turn causes electrical corrent to flow along both the outside and the inside of the fiber and initiates additional action potential.

        "exp": "Ans. B. Proteins. (Ref Ganong 23rd pg. no 6 & 7).Because there are more proteins in plasma than in interstitial fluid, there is a Donnan effect on ion movement across the capillary wall.DONNAN EFFECTWhen an ion on one side of a membrane cannot diffuse through the membrane, the distribution of other ions to which the membrane is permeable is affected in a predictable way. For example, the negative charge of a nondiffusible anion hinders diffusion of the diffusible cations and favors diffusion of the diffusible anions. Consider the following situation, in which the membrane (m) between compartments X and Y is impermeable to charged proteins (Prot) but freely permeable to K+ and Cl-. Assume that the concentrations of the anions and of the cations on the two sides are initially equal. Cl- diffuses down its concentration gradient from Y to X, and some K+ moves with the negatively charged Cl- because of its opposite charge. Therefore > Furthermore, + + > + that is, more osmotically active particles are on side X than on side Y.Donnan and Gibbs showed that in the presence of a nondiffusible ion, the diffusible ions distribute themselves so that at equilibrium their concentration ratios are equal:---=---Cross-multiplying, + = + This is the Gibbs-Donnan equation. It holds for any pair of cations and anions of the same valence.The Donnan effect on the distribution of ions has three effects in the body.# First, because of charged proteins (Prot ) in cells, there are more osmotically active particles in cells than in interstitial fluid, and because animal cells have flexible walls, osmosis would make them swell and eventually rupture if it were not for Na, K ATPase pumping ions back out of cells. Thus, normal cell volume and pressure depend on Na, K ATPase.# Second, because at equilibrium the distribution of permeant ions across the membrane (m in the example used here) is asymmetric, an electrical difference exists across the membrane whose magnitude can be determined by the Nernst equation# Third, because there are more proteins in plasma than in interstitial fluid, there is a Donnan effect on ion movement across the capillary wall.",

Integral proteins are globular and amphipathic, consisting of two hydrophilic ends separated by an intervening hydrophobic region that traverses the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. Integral proteins interact by non-polar (hydrophobic) interacts with the fatty acyl groups of phospholipids in the cell membrane and require the use of detergents for their solubilization. Integral proteins are asymmetrically distributed across the membrane bilayer.2) Peripheral (Extrinsic) proteins# Peripheral proteins are present on the surface of the membrane and do not penetrate all the way through. They are located on both surface of membrane, outer and inner. Peripheral proteins do not interact directly with the phospholipid in the bilayer. They bound to the hydrophilic regions of the transmembrane proteins through electrostatic and hydrogen bonds. However, some (not all) proteins bind to membrane via a covalentently attached lipid anchor, i.e., interaction with polar (hydrophilic) lipid head groups in the membrane.# As they do not interact directly with hydrophobic core of phospholipids, they do not require use of detergents for their release. They can be released by treatment with salt solutions of high ionic strength.# Peripheral proteins serve as cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that anchor cells to neighboring cells and to basal lamina.

Troponin, or the troponin complex, is a complex of three regulatory proteins (troponin C, troponin I and troponin T) that is integral to muscle contraction in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle but not smooth muscle.b. Discussions of troponin often pertain to its functional characteristics and/or to its usefulness as a diagnostic marker or therapeutic target for various heart disorders in particular as a highly specific marker for myocardial infarction or heart muscle cell death.c. Troponin is attached to the protein tropomyosin and lies within the groove between actin filaments in muscle tissue. In a relaxed muscle, tropomyosin blocks the attachment site for the myosin crossbridge, thus preventing contraction.d. When the muscle cell is stimulated to contract by an action potential, calcium channels open in the sarcoplasmic membrane and release calcium into the sarcoplasm.e. Some of this calcium attaches to troponin, which causes it to change shape, exposing binding sites for myosin (active sites) on the actin filaments. Myosin's binding to actin causes crossbridge formation, and contraction of the muscle begins.a. Troponin activation. Troponin C (red) binds Ca2+, which stabilizes the activated state, where troponin I (yellow) is no longer bound to actin.b. Troponin T (blue) anchors the complex on tropomyosin.c. Troponin is found in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, but the specific versions of troponin differ between types of muscle.d.

Strictly speaking, it is not a part of the action potential.2) Depolarization phase:# The potential shoots up to + 35 mV in less than a millisecond. It is due to opening of \"voltage gated\" Na+ channels which causes influx of sodium, so inside negative charge becomes positive.# From -70 mV to -55 mV (firing Ivel or threshold point) the voltage gated sodium channles open partially. This portion of AP (-70 mV to -55 mV) is called \"prepotential\" or \"foot ofAP\".# Once the threshold level (-55 mV) is reached voltage gated Na+ channels open completely and the potential shoots up suddenly. It is called depolarization, since it represents loss of the original polarity of cell membrane.3) Repolarization phase:# The potential drops to near resting level, i.e., reversal to original polarity (repolarization). At the start of repolarization (end of depolarization), Voltage - gated Na+ channels close and Voltage - gated K+ channels open which cause efflux of K+ out of the cell. So, inside positive charge once again becomes negative due to efflux of positive charge (K+).4) After depolarization:# The repolarization is very fast till 70% of repolarization has been acheived. After that it is slows down. This slower phase of repolarization is called 'after depolarization\\5) After-hyperpolarization:# During repolarization phase K+ channels open and there is K+ efflux. The membrane voltage falls back (repolarizes) to resting potential, i.e., -70 mV. At this voltage, K+ channels close, but quite slowly.# Therefore, more K+ ions leak out, causing a brief period in which the voltage falls below -70 mV, i.e. hyperplorization.

The molecular motors that move proteins, organelles, and other cell parts (collectively referred to as \"cargo\") to all parts of the cell are 100 to 500 kDa ATPases.b. They attach to their cargo at one end of the molecule and to microtubules or actin polymers with the other end, sometimes referred to as the \"head.\" They convert the energy of ATP into movement along the cytoskeleton, taking their cargo with them. There are three super families of molecular motors:c. kinesin, dynein, and myosin. It is important to note that there is extensive variation among superfamily members, allowing for specialization of function (eg, choice of cargo, cytoskeletal filament type, and/or direction of movement).d. The conventional form of kinesin is a double headed molecule that tends to move its cargo toward the \"+\" ends of microtubules. One head binds to the microtubule and then bends its neck while the other head swings forward and binds, producing almost continuous movement. Some kinesins are associated with mitosis and meiosis. Other kinesins perform different functions, including, in some instances, moving cargo to the \"-\"end of microtubules. Dynein's have two heads, with their neck pieces embedded in a complex of proteins. Cytoplasmic dynein's have a function like that of conventional kinesin, except they tend to move particles and membranes to the \"-\" end of the microtubules. The multiple forms of myosin in the body are divided into 18 classes,e. The heads of myosin molecules bind to actin and produce motion by bending their neck regions (myosin II) or walking along microfilaments, one head after the other (myosin V). In these ways, they perform functions as diverse as contraction of muscle and cell migration.",

Na+-K+ pump is an electrogenic pump that is responsible for maintaining the Na+ and K+ concentration difference across the cell membrane.* Na+ - K+ pump extrudes 3 Na+ out from the cell and at the same time pump 2K+ into the cell, i.e., Coupling ratio of Na+ K+ pump is 3 : 2.* Na+ and K+ transport by Na+ - K+ pump is primary active transport and both Na+ and K+ are transported against concentration gradient (intracellular fluid has high concentration of K+ and ECF has high concentration of Na+).* Na+ K+ pump uses energy by hydrolysing ATP; this pump contain ATPase activity.Structure* Na+ - K+ pump is a carrier protein which is a heterodimer made up of two separate globular proteins: a larger one called a-subunit with molecular weight of 100,000 and a smaller one called b-subunit, with a molecular weight of about 55,000. Both a- and b- subunits span across the membrane with an intracellular and an extracellular sites.* Na+ and K+ transport occurs through a-subunits. Intracellular portion of a-subunit has three Na+ binding sites (three receptor sites for Na+), an ATP binding site, a phosphorylating site and ATPase activity. Extracellular portion has two K+ binding sites (two receptor sites for K+), and an oubain binding site. The b-subunit has three extracellular glycosylation sites, all of which appear to have attached carbohydrate residue.Function* The Na+ - K+ pump is an electrogenic pump since it produces a net movement of positive charge out of the cell. Thus, besides maintaining the ionic composition of the intracellular fluid, the Na+ - K+ pump helps to maintain the electrochemical potential difference across the cell membrane. However, Na+ - K+ pump contributes only 4 millivolts to total resting membrane potential of 90 volts which is almost negligble.* Active transport of Na+ and K+ is one of the major energy using process in the body. On the average, it accounts for about 24% of the energy utilized by cell and in neurons it accounts for 70%.* Activity of Na+ - K+ pump is stimulated by increased intracellular concentration of Na+, thyroid hormones, aldosterone and insulin. Pump activity is inhibited by CHF, CRF, digoxin toxicity and dopamine.",

        "question": "The ratio of ions moving out of the cell to the no. of ions moving inside the cell via the na:k ATPase pump is?",
        "exp": "Ans. D. 3:2. (Ref Ganong 23rd/ Ch. 32).NA, K ATPASENa, K ATPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and uses the energy to extrude three Na+ from the cell and take two K+ into the cell for each molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. It is an electrogenic pump in that it moves three positive charges out of the cell for each two that it moves in, and it is therefore said to have a coupling ratio of 3:2. It is found in all parts of the body. Its activity is inhibited by ouabain and related digitalis glycosides used in the treatment of heart failure. It is a heterodimer made up of an alpha subunit with a molecular weight of approximately 100,000 and a beta subunit with a molecular weight of approximately 55,000. Both extend through the cell membrane. Separation of the subunits eliminates activity. The beta subunit is a glycoprotein, whereas Na+ and K+ transport occur through the alpha subunit. The beta subunit has a single membrane-spanning domain and three extracellular glycosylation sites, all of which appear to have attached carbohydrate residues. These residues account for one third of its molecular weight. The alpha subunit probably spans the cell membrane 10 times, with the amino and carboxyl terminals both located intracellularly. This subunit has intracellular Na+- and ATP-binding sites and a phosphorylation site; it also has extracellular binding sites for K+ and ouabain. The endogenous ligand of the ouabain-binding site is unsettled. When Na+ binds to the alpha subunit, ATP also binds and is converted to ADP, with a phosphate being transferred to Asp 376, the phosphorylation site. This causes a change in the configuration of the protein, extruding Na+ into the ECF. K+ then binds extracellularly, dephosphorylating the alpha subunit, which returns to its previous conformation, releasing K+ into the cytoplasm.Na+-K+ ATPase is located in the plasma membrane with ATP site on cytoplasmic side. For each ATP consumed, 3 Na+ go out and 2 K+ come in. During cycle, pump is phosphorylated.Ouabain inhibits by binding to K+ site.Cardiac glycosides (digoxin and digitoxin from foxglove) also inhibit the Na+-K+ ATPase, causing T cardiac contractility. Also know:The cells of the proximal and distal tubules, like the cells of the gastric glands, secrete hydrogen ions. Acidification also occurs in the collecting ducts. The reaction that is primarily responsible for H+ secretion in the proximal tubules is Na-H exchange. This is an example of secondary active transport; extrusion of Na+ from the cells into the interstitium by Na, K ATPase lowers intracellular Na+, and this causes Na+ to enter the cell from the tubular lumen, with coupled extrusion of H+ The H+ comes from intracellular dissociation of H2CO3, and the HCO3 that is formed diffuses into the interstitial fluid. Thus, for each H+ ion secreted, one Na+ ion and one HCO3 ion enter the interstitial fluid.Type of transportEnergy sourceExampleOther characteristicsClinical correlationSimple diffusionPassivePulmonary gases--Pulmonary edema decreases diffusionCarrier-mediated or facilitated diffusionPassiveGlucose uptake by muscleInsulin controls carrier population CHemical specificityInsulin-dependent glucose uptake impaired in diabetes mellitusPrimary active transportDirect use of ATPNa+/K+-ATPaseH+/K+-ATPaseAntiport (countertransport)Inhibition by cardiac glycosidesSecondary active transportElectrochemical gradient for sodium is most common driving forceNa+-glucose in kidneyNa+-H+ exchangeSymport (cotransport) Antiport (countertransport)Osmotic diuresis results when transporters saturated Renal tubular acidosis",

        "question": "What is Charles's Law?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e. V/T = constant Physical behavior of gases Gas pressure o The gas molecules are in continuous motion, moving through space at high velocity' and being deflected from their course only upon collision with other gas molecules or with boundries of the space in which they are contained. It would be obvious that greater the concentration of the molecules of the gas, the greater wrould be the force exerted by the molecules against the container at any given time. Therefore, the pressure of a gas is directly proportionate to its concentration. Boyle's law o At a constant temperature, the pressure (P) of a given mass is inversely proportionate to its volume (p a 1/v), i.e., PV = constant. Dalton's law of partial pressure o When a mixture of gases is present in a container, each gas exerts a pressure according to its own concentration, independent of the concentration of other gases present in the mixture. In other words, each gas behaves as if it was present alone. The pressure of each gas in mixture of gases is known as its partial pressure or tension. For example, environment air is a mixture of 21 % O2 and 79% N2. Therefore, the partial pressure of O2 (PO2) in the environmental air, at sea level (barometric pressure 760 mm Hg), would be 21 /100 x 760 = 160 mm Hg. Similarly, partial pressure of N2 (pH2) in the environmental air, at sea level, wrould be 79/100 x 760 = 600 mm Hg. Total pressure = pO2 + pN2 = 760 mm Hg. Water vapour pressure o The inhaled air is humified by the water vapours from the conducting passages. By the time it reaches the alveoli, it is saturated with water vapour. Therefore, in the alveolar air, besides N2 and O2, water vapour also exerts its partial pressure, which is 47 mm Hg. It is not affected by the presence or absence of other gases, or the atmospheric pressure. That means, there is a constant water pressure of 47 mm Hg once the air reaches the alveoli (in alveolar pressure). Partial pressure of gas dissolved in water and tissues o When a gas is brought in contact writh water, (or body tissues), some of the gas molecules move into water and get dissolved in it. But the dissolved gas molecules also tend to escape from the water. After a time the rate of escape equals rate of entry, i.e., equilbrium is reached. Henery's law states that the concentration of a gas in solution at equilbrium is directly proportional to its partial pressure in gas phase : - Concentration of dissolved gas = Partial pressure x Solubility coefficient o Solubility coefficient (absorption coefficient) of CO2 is 20 times greater than O2. Charles's law When the pressure on a sample of a dry gas is held constant, the Kelvin temperature and the volume will be directly related. this directly proportional relationship can be written as: or V/T = k Avogadro's hypothesis o Different gases at the same pressure and temperature contain the same number of molecules. Thus a gram molecule of any gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters at STPD (00C, 760 m Hg pressure, dry). Gas equation o It is PV= nRT(P = pressure. V = volume, n = gram molecules of gas.

        "question": "Which of the following is the largest protein in the body that connects M line to Z line during active muscle contraction?",
        "exp": "Ans. C. Titin. (Ref. Guyton & Hall's Textbook of Medical Physiology 11th/pg. 463)SarcomereThe portion of the myofibril (or of the whole muscle fiber) that lies between two successive Z discs is called a sarcomere. When the muscle fiber is contracted, the length of the sarcomere is about 2 micrometers. At this length, the actin filaments completely overlap the myosin filaments, and the tips of the actin filaments are just beginning to overlap one another.Titin# The side-by-side relationship between the myosin and actin filaments is difficult to maintain. This is achieved by a large number of filamentous molecules of a protein called titin. Each titin molecule has a molecular weight of about 3 million, which makes it one of the largest protein molecules in the body.Myosin Filament.# The myosin filament is composed of multiple myosin molecules, each having a molecular weight of about 480,000.# The myosin molecule is composed of six polypeptide chains--two heavy chains, each with a molecular wt of about 200,000, and four light chains with molecular weights of about 20,000 each.# The myosin filament is made up of 200 or more individual myosin molecules. The protruding arms and heads together are calledcross-bridges. Each cross-bridge is flexible at two points called hinges--one where the arm leaves the body of the myosin filament, and the other where the head attaches to the arm.# The total length of each myosin filament is uniform, almost exactly 1.6 micrometers. Note, however, that there are no cross-bridge heads in the very center of the myosin filament for a distance of about 0.2 micrometer because the hinged arms extend away from the center.# ATPase Activity of the Myosin Head. Another feature of the myosin head that is essential for muscle contraction is that it functions as an ATPase enzyme. As explained later, this property allows the head to cleave ATP and to use the energy derived from the ATP's high-energy phosphate bond to energize the contraction process.Actin Filament.# The actin filament is complex, composed of three protein components: actin, tropomyosin, and troponin.# The backbone of the actin filament is a double- stranded F-actin protein molecule. The two strands are wound in a helix in the same manner as the myosin molecule.# Each actin filament is about 1 micrometer long. The bases of the actin filaments are inserted strongly into the Z discs; Tropomyosin Molecules.# The actin filament also contains another protein, tropomyosin. Each molecule of tropomyosin has a molecular weight of 70,000 and a length of 40 nanometers. These molecules are wrapped spirally around the sides of the F-actin helix. In the resting state, the tropomyosin molecules lie on top of the active sites of the actin strands, so that attraction cannot occur between the actin and myosin filaments to cause contraction.Troponin and Its Role in Muscle Contraction.# Attached intermittently along the sides of the tropomyosin molecules are still other protein molecules called troponin.# One of the subunits (troponin I) has a strong affinity for actin, another (troponin T) for tropomyosin, and a third (troponin C) for calcium ions. This complex is believed to attach tropomyosin to the actin.# The strong affinity of the troponin for calcium ions is believed to initiate the contraction process.",
