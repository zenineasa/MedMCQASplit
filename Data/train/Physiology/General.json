Exocytosis: here-substances secreted by the cell are trapped within vesicles or granules which fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents to the ECF. This leaves the contents of the vesicles or granules outside the cell and cell membrane intact. It requires Ca++ and energy. Hormones, digestive enzymes and synaptic transmitters are examples of substances transported out of the cell by this process. Endocytosis: includes phagocytosis, pinocytosis, clathrin mediated endocytosis, caveolate-dependant uptakeand nonclathrin/noncaveolae endocytosis.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., -55 mv * The action potential, which is recorded using an intracellular electrode, has following phases: -1) Resting stage:# This is the resting membrane potential before the action potential. At rest, membrane is said to be \"polarized\" because - 70 mV negative membrane potential (RMP) that is present. Strictly speaking, it is not a part of the action potential. 2) Depolarization phase:# The potential shoots up to + 35 mV in less than a millisecond. It is due to opening of \"voltage gated\" Na+ channels which causes influx of sodium, so inside negative charge becomes positive.# From -70 mV to -55 mV (firing Ivel or threshold point) the voltage gated sodium channles open partially. This portion of AP (-70 mV to -55 mV) is called \"prepotential\" or \"foot of. AP\".# Once the threshold level (-55 mV) is reached voltage gated Na+ channels open completely and the potential shoots up suddenly. It is called depolarization, since it represents loss of the original polarity of cell membrane. 3) Repolarization phase:# The potential drops to near resting level, i. e., reversal to original polarity (repolarization). At the start of repolarization (end of depolarization), Voltage - gated Na+ channels close and Voltage - gated K+ channels open which cause efflux of K+ out of the cell. So, inside positive charge once again becomes negative due to efflux of positive charge (K+). 4) After depolarization:# The repolarization is very fast till 70% of repolarization has been acheived. After that it is slows down. This slower phase of repolarization is called 'after depolarization\\5) After-hyperpolarization:# During repolarization phase K+ channels open and there is K+ efflux. The membrane voltage falls back (repolarizes) to resting potential, i. e., -70 mV. At this voltage, K+ channels close, but quite slowly.# Therefore, more K+ ions leak out, causing a brief period in which the voltage falls below -70 mV, i. e. hyperplorization. Then, K+/Na+ pump works to re-establish resting potential by pumping Na+ ions back out and K+ ions back into the cells.",

The sequences are formed by a specialized Ribonucleoprotein, telomerase, an enzyme that stabilizes telomere length by adding to the ends of chromosomes. The activity of telomerase is repressed by regulatory proteins, which restrict telomere elongation, then providing a length sensing mechanism. Telomerase activity is expressed in germ cells and is present at low levels in stem cells, but is usually absent in most somatic tissues. When somatic cells replicate, a small section of telomere is not duplicated and telomeres become progressively shortened. Shortened telomeres are proposed to signal a growth check point allowing cells to become senescent. Conversely in immortal cancer cells, telomerase is reactivated and telomeres are not shortened, suggesting that telomere elongation might be an important, possibly essential step in tumor formation",

The carrier proteins involved in active transport are called ion pumps.* There are two types of active transport: -1) Primary active transport:# In primary active trasnport, the energy is derived directly from hydrolysis (breakdown) of ATP (or related molecule). The most important example is Na+K+ pump (Na+K+ ATPase). 2) Secondary active transport:# In secondary active transport, the energy is derived from the store which has been created originally by primary active transport. Secondary active transport represents a combination of primary active transport and facilitated diffusion.# It is exemplified by glucose transport across intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, the Na+K+ pump operates at the basolateral border of the cell and maintains intracellular concentration of Na+ very low. The low intracellular Na+ concentration provides the necessory concentration gradient for Na+ to diffuse in passively at the luminal border through facilitated cotransport with glucose. Thus, the Na+K+ pump (Na+K+ ATPase) indirectly powers the movement of glucose into the cell, and glucose can move in against a concentration gradient so long as Na+ diffuses in along a concentration gradient.# It is important to know that at luminal border, Na+ is transported by facilitated diffusion (as it diffuses along a concentration gradient) while the glucose is transported actively (against a concentration gradient) and the energy is provided by Na+K+ ATPase at basolateral border - So, secondary active transport is a combination of active transport (glucose transport against concentration gradient) and facilitated diffusion (Na+ transport along concentration gradient by carrier protein).",

There are following types of membrane proteins1) Integral (Transmembrane or intrinsic) Proteins: -# These proteins pass 'through and through', i. e., they run (span) the entire length of lipid bilayer. Integral proteins are globular and amphipathic, consisting of two hydrophilic ends separated by an intervening hydrophobic region that traverses the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. Integral proteins interact by non-polar (hydrophobic) interacts with the fatty acyl groups of phospholipids in the cell membrane and require the use of detergents for their solubilization. Integral proteins are asymmetrically distributed across the membrane bilayer. 2) Peripheral (Extrinsic) proteins# Peripheral proteins are present on the surface of the membrane and do not penetrate all the way through. They are located on both surface of membrane, outer and inner. Peripheral proteins do not interact directly with the phospholipid in the bilayer. They bound to the hydrophilic regions of the transmembrane proteins through electrostatic and hydrogen bonds. However, some (not all) proteins bind to membrane via a covalentently attached lipid anchor, i. e., interaction with polar (hydrophilic) lipid head groups in the membrane.# As they do not interact directly with hydrophobic core of phospholipids, they do not require use of detergents for their release. They can be released by treatment with salt solutions of high ionic strength.# Peripheral proteins serve as cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that anchor cells to neighboring cells and to basal lamina. They also contribute to cytoskeleton when present on the inside of the membrane, e. g., spectrin, ankyrin, band 4. 1 in RBCs. Important functions of cell membrane proteins.

Troponin, or the troponin complex, is a complex of three regulatory proteins (troponin C, troponin I and troponin T) that is integral to muscle contraction in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle but not smooth muscle. b. Discussions of troponin often pertain to its functional characteristics and/or to its usefulness as a diagnostic marker or therapeutic target for various heart disorders in particular as a highly specific marker for myocardial infarction or heart muscle cell death. c. Troponin is attached to the protein tropomyosin and lies within the groove between actin filaments in muscle tissue. In a relaxed muscle, tropomyosin blocks the attachment site for the myosin crossbridge, thus preventing contraction. d. When the muscle cell is stimulated to contract by an action potential, calcium channels open in the sarcoplasmic membrane and release calcium into the sarcoplasm. e. Some of this calcium attaches to troponin, which causes it to change shape, exposing binding sites for myosin (active sites) on the actin filaments. Myosin's binding to actin causes crossbridge formation, and contraction of the muscle begins. a. Troponin activation. Troponin C (red) binds Ca2+, which stabilizes the activated state, where troponin I (yellow) is no longer bound to actin. b. Troponin T (blue) anchors the complex on tropomyosin. c. Troponin is found in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, but the specific versions of troponin differ between types of muscle. d. The main difference is that the TnC subunit of troponin in skeletal muscle has four calcium ion-binding sites, whereas in cardiac muscle there are only three. e.

At rest, membrane is said to be \"polarized\" because - 70 mV negative membrane potential (RMP) that is present. Strictly speaking, it is not a part of the action potential. 2) Depolarization phase:# The potential shoots up to + 35 mV in less than a millisecond. It is due to opening of \"voltage gated\" Na+ channels which causes influx of sodium, so inside negative charge becomes positive.# From -70 mV to -55 mV (firing Ivel or threshold point) the voltage gated sodium channles open partially. This portion of AP (-70 mV to -55 mV) is called \"prepotential\" or \"foot of. AP\".# Once the threshold level (-55 mV) is reached voltage gated Na+ channels open completely and the potential shoots up suddenly. It is called depolarization, since it represents loss of the original polarity of cell membrane. 3) Repolarization phase:# The potential drops to near resting level, i. e., reversal to original polarity (repolarization). At the start of repolarization (end of depolarization), Voltage - gated Na+ channels close and Voltage - gated K+ channels open which cause efflux of K+ out of the cell. So, inside positive charge once again becomes negative due to efflux of positive charge (K+). 4) After depolarization:# The repolarization is very fast till 70% of repolarization has been acheived. After that it is slows down. This slower phase of repolarization is called 'after depolarization\\5) After-hyperpolarization:# During repolarization phase K+ channels open and there is K+ efflux. The membrane voltage falls back (repolarizes) to resting potential, i. e., -70 mV. At this voltage, K+ channels close, but quite slowly.# Therefore, more K+ ions leak out, causing a brief period in which the voltage falls below -70 mV, i. e. hyperplorization. Then, K+/Na+ pump works to re-establish resting potential by pumping Na+ ions back out and K+ ions back into the cells.",

Exocvtosis:-Vesicles containing the material for export are targeted to the cell mem-brane, where they bond via the vsnare/ t-snare arrangement. The area of fusion then breaks down, leaving the contents of the vesicle outside and the cell membrane intact. This is a Ca2+ dependant process. Thus, there is a net increase in the surface area of the cell as the cytoplas-mic sides of two membranes fuse. Endocvtosis:-The process by which cells take up large molecules. In endocytosis, two non cytoplasmic sides of membranes fuse. Endocytotic vesicles are generated when segments of the plasma membrane invaginate, enclosing a minute volume of extracellular fluid and is contents. The vesicle then pinches off as the fusion of plasma membranes seal the neck of the vesicle at the original site of invagination. There are two general types of endocytosis:-a) Phagocytosisb) Pinocytosis. Phagocvtosis:-Involves ingestion of large particles such as viruses, bacteria, cells or debris. Occurs only in specialized cells such as macrophages and granulocytes. Pinocvtosis:-Property of all cells. It is a cellular uptake of fluid and fluid contents. It is of two types:-Fluid phase pinocytosis is a non selective process in which the uptake of a solute is simply proportionate to its concentration in the surrounding extracellular fluid. Absoipti ve pinocytosis is a receptor mediated selective process primarily responsible for the uptake of mac- romolecules. The vesicles formed dur-ing absorptive pinocytosis are derived from invagination (pits) that are coated on the cytoplasmic side with a Filamentous material. In many systems, Clathrin is the filamentous material. For e. g., LDL is internalised by means of coated pits containing the LDL receptors.",

        "question": "The ratio of ions moving out of the cell to the no. of ions moving inside the cell via the na: k ATPase pump is?",
        "exp": "Ans. D. 3: 2. (Ref Ganong 23rd/ Ch. 32). NA, K ATPASENa, K ATPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and uses the energy to extrude three Na+ from the cell and take two K+ into the cell for each molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. It is an electrogenic pump in that it moves three positive charges out of the cell for each two that it moves in, and it is therefore said to have a coupling ratio of 3: 2. It is found in all parts of the body. Its activity is inhibited by ouabain and related digitalis glycosides used in the treatment of heart failure. It is a heterodimer made up of an alpha subunit with a molecular weight of approximately 100, 000 and a beta subunit with a molecular weight of approximately 55, 000. Both extend through the cell membrane. Separation of the subunits eliminates activity. The beta subunit is a glycoprotein, whereas Na+ and K+ transport occur through the alpha subunit. The beta subunit has a single membrane-spanning domain and three extracellular glycosylation sites, all of which appear to have attached carbohydrate residues. These residues account for one third of its molecular weight. The alpha subunit probably spans the cell membrane 10 times, with the amino and carboxyl terminals both located intracellularly. This subunit has intracellular Na+- and ATP-binding sites and a phosphorylation site; it also has extracellular binding sites for K+ and ouabain. The endogenous ligand of the ouabain-binding site is unsettled. When Na+ binds to the alpha subunit, ATP also binds and is converted to ADP, with a phosphate being transferred to Asp 376, the phosphorylation site. This causes a change in the configuration of the protein, extruding Na+ into the ECF. K+ then binds extracellularly, dephosphorylating the alpha subunit, which returns to its previous conformation, releasing K+ into the cytoplasm. Na+-K+ ATPase is located in the plasma membrane with ATP site on cytoplasmic side. For each ATP consumed, 3 Na+ go out and 2 K+ come in. During cycle, pump is phosphorylated. Ouabain inhibits by binding to K+ site. Cardiac glycosides (digoxin and digitoxin from foxglove) also inhibit the Na+-K+ ATPase, causing T cardiac contractility. Also know: The cells of the proximal and distal tubules, like the cells of the gastric glands, secrete hydrogen ions. Acidification also occurs in the collecting ducts. The reaction that is primarily responsible for H+ secretion in the proximal tubules is Na-H exchange. This is an example of secondary active transport; extrusion of Na+ from the cells into the interstitium by Na, K ATPase lowers intracellular Na+, and this causes Na+ to enter the cell from the tubular lumen, with coupled extrusion of H+ The H+ comes from intracellular dissociation of H2. CO3, and the HCO3 that is formed diffuses into the interstitial fluid. Thus, for each H+ ion secreted, one Na+ ion and one HCO3 ion enter the interstitial fluid. Type of transport. Energy source.
