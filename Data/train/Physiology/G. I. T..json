Stimulates secretory activity of parietal and chief cells. SourcesG cells - Antral mucosa (Most important source) -- Also called APUD cells. TG cells - found throughout the stomach and small intestine. Pancreatic islets in fetal life. Anterior and intermediate lobes of pituitary gland, hypothalamus, medullar oblongata, vagus and sciatic nerves. Types. G17, 14 and G34. Functions. Stimulates Gastric acid / HCI secretion from parietal cells. Stimulates HCI secretion by stimulating secretion of histamine from the enterochromaffin like cells (ECL) present in body of stomach. Stimulation of pepsin secretion. Stimulates growth of stomach and intestinal mucosa (Trophic action). Increases gastric and intestinal motility. Increases pancreatic secretion of Insulin and Glucagon but only after a protein meal. The functions of gastrin in the pituitary gland, brain and peripheral nerves are unknown. Control of Gastrin Section. Factors Stimulating Gastrin Stimulation. Vagaf Stimulation. Increases gastrin release through gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) and not through neurotransmitter ACHBecause of this reason, anti- muscarinic blocker atropine does not affect release of gastrin from G cells.

        "question": "Secretin is produced by which of the following duodenal cells?",
        "exp": "Ans. D. S cells. (Ref. Guyton's Medical Physiology 11th/pg. 801; Ganong 23rd/ Chapter 36). GI secretory products1. Nitrous oxide: Causes smooth muscle relaxation (e. g., elower oesophageal sphincter (LES) relaxtion). 2. Gastrin: Secreted in response to gastric distention, vagal stimulation, and amino acid entering the stomach; causes gastric H+ secretion. 3. Secretin: Secreted in response to H+ and fatty acids entering the duodenum; causes pancreatid secretion of of HCO3 and inhibits gastrin H+ secretion. It is known as Nature's antacid as after being secreted by 'S' cells of duodenum it causes, secretion of bicarbonate from pancreas, which neutralises gastric acid. 4. Cholecystokinin (CCK): Secreted in response to amino acids and fatty acids entering the duodenum; causes contraction of gallbladder and pancreatic secretion of enzymes and HC03 (AIIMS-99). 5. Parasympathetic (ACh): Increases production of saliva; increased gastric H+ secretion; increases pancreatic enzyme and HCO3+ secretion; stimulates enteric nervous system to create intestinal peristalisis; relaxes sphincters. 6. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP): Secreted by smooth muscle and nerves of intestines. Relaxes intestinal smooth muscle causes pancreatic HC03 secretion and inhibits gastric H+ secretion. 7. Sympathetic (NE): Increases production of saliva; deceases spalnchnic blood flow in fight-or-flight response: decreases motility; constricts sphincters. Hormone. Source. Action. Regulation. Notes.

Endocrine: | insulin release| by fatty acids, amino acids, oral glucose (only GI hormone stimulated by all 3 nutrient classes)| GIP is why an oral glucose load is used more rapidly than the equivalent given by IVSecretin# Secretin is a polypeptide, containing 27 amino acids (molecular weight about 3400), present in an inactive form, prosecretin, in so-called S cells in the mucosa of the duodenum and jejunum. When acid chyme with pH less than 4. 5 to 5. 0 enters the duodenum from the stomach, it causes duodenal mucosal release and activation of secretin, which is then absorbed into the blood. The one truly potent constituent of chyme that causes this secretin release is the hydrochloric acid from the stomach.# Secretin in turn causes the pancreas to secrete large quantities of fluid containing a high concentration of bicarbonate ion (up to 145 m. Eq/L) but a low concentration of chloride ion. The secretin mechanism is especially important for two reasons: First, secretin begins to be released from the mucosa of the small intestine when the pH of the duodenal contents falls below 4. 5 to 5. 0, and its release increases greatly as the pH falls to 3. 0. This immediately causes copious secretion of pancreatic juice containing abundant amounts of sodium bicarbonate. Cholecystokinin# The presence of food in the upper small intestine also causes a second hormone, cholecystokinin, a polypeptide containing 33 amino acids, to be released 'I cells', in the mucosa of the duodenum and upper jejunum. This release of cholecystokinin results especially from the presence of proteoses and peptones and long-chain fatty acids in the chyme coming from the stomach.# The differences between the pancreatic stimulatory effects of secretin and Cholecystokinin:- intense sodium bicarbonate secretion in response to acid in duodenum, stimulated by secretin, - a dual effect in response to soap (a fat), and- intense digestive enzyme secretion (when peptones enter duodenum) stimulated by CCK. Educational points: Basic Stimuli That Cause Pancreatic Secretion. Three basic stimuli are important in causing pancreatic secretion: 1. Acetylcholine, which is released from the parasympathetic vagus nerve endings and from other cholinergic nerves in the enteric nervous system2. Cholecystokinin, which is secreted by duodenal and upper jejunal mucosa when food enters small bowel3. Secretin, which is also secreted by duodenal and jejunal mucosa when highly acid food enters small bowel. The presence of acid, fat, protein breakdown products, hyperosmotic or hypo-osmotic fluids, or any irritating factor in the upper small intestine causes release of several intestinal hormones. One of these is secretin, which is especially important for control of pancreatic secretion. However, secretin opposes stomach secretion. Three other hormones--gastric inhibitory peptide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and somatostatin--also have slight to moderate effects in inhibiting gastric secretion.",

        "exp": "Ans. c. (Apotransferrin). (Ref. Guyton physiology 11th ed., 425-426). Mechanism of absorption of Iron from the small Intestinal Tract# The liver secretes moderate amounts of apotransferrin into bile, which flows via bile duct into duodenum, where the apotransferrin binds with free iron and with certain iron compounds, such as hemoglobin and myoglobin from meat, two of the most important sources of iron in the diet, to form transferrin.# Trasnsferrin, in turn, is attracted to and binds with receptors in the membranes of the intestinal epithelial cells. Then, by pinocytosis, the transferrin molecule, carrying its iron store, is absorbed into the epithelial cells and later released into the blood capillaries beneath these cells in the form of plasma transferrin.# Iron is important for the formation not only of hemoglobin but also of other essential elements in the body (e. g., myoglobin, cytochromes, cytochrome oxidase, peroxidase, catalase).# The total quantity of iron in the body averages 4 to 5 grams, about 65% of which is in the form of hemoglobin. About 4% is in the form of myoglobin, 1% is in the form of the various heme compounds that promote intracellular oxidation, 0. 1% is combined with the protein transferrin in the blood plasma, and 15 to 30% is stored for later use, mainly in the reticuloendothelial system and liver parenchymal cells, principally in the form of ferritin. Educational Points:# In the cytoplasm, iron combines mainly with a protein, apoferritin, to form ferritin. Apoferritin has a molecular weight of 460, 000, and varying quantities of iron can combine in clusters of iron radicals with this large molecule; therefore, ferritin may contain only a small amount of iron or a large amount.

Its absorption requires an intact mucosa only.* In this test, the patient ingests D-xylose (a nondigestible but absorbable carbohydrate) by mouth, and then the urinary D-xylose is measured.* Urine excretion below certain levels (depending on the amount of D-xylose ingested) implies poor absorption of D-xylose and, therefore, disease of the small intestine.* Alternatively, a blood level of xylose is measured 2 hours after the D-xylose is taken by mouth. Low levels in the blood imply poor absorption.

        "exp": "Ans. D. 2-Monoglyceride and fatty acidsa. Pancreatic lipase hydrolyzes triglyceride to form 2-monoglyceride and two fatty acids. The hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine, not triglyceride, results in the formation of lysophosphatidylcholines. Although diglyceride is an intermediate in the hydrolysis of triglyceride by pancreatic lipase, the hydrolysis continues until 2-monoglyceride and fatty acids are formed. Pancreatic lipase does not hydrolyze triglyceride totally to form glycerol and fatty acids. b. Most fat digestion therefore begins in the duodenum, pancreatic lipase being one of the most important enzymes involved. This enzyme hydrolyzes the 1- and 3-bonds of the triglycerides (triacylglycerors) with relative ease but acts on the 2-bonds at a very low rate, so the principal products of its action are free fatty acids and 2-monoglycerides (2- monoacylglycerols). It acts on fats that have been emulsified (see below). Its activity is facilitated when an amphipathic helix that covers the active site like a lid is bent back. c. Colipase, a protein with a molecular weight of about 11, 000, is also secreted in the pancreatic juice, and when this molecule binds to the -COOH-terminal domain of the pancreatic lipase, opening of the lid is facilitated. Colipase is secreted in an inactive proform and is activated in the intestinal lumen by trypsin. Another pancreatic lipase that is activated by bile salts has been characterized. This 100, 000-k. Da cholesterol esterase represents about 4% of the total protein in pancreatic juice. In adults, pancreatic lipase is 10-60 times more active, but unlike pancreatic lipase, this bile salt-activated lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters, esters of fat-soluble vitamins, and phospholipids, as well as triglycerides. A very similar enzyme is found in human milk. d. Fats are relatively insoluble, which limits their ability to cross the unstirred layer and reach the surface of the mucosal cells. However, they are finely emulsified in the small intestine by the detergent action of bile salts, lecithin, and monoglyceride. When the concentration of bile salts in the intestine is high, as it is after contraction of the gallbladder, lipids and bile salts interact spontaneously to form micelles. These cylindrical aggregates, take up lipids, and although their lipid concentration varies, they generally contain fatty acids, monoglyceride, and cholesterol in their hydrophobic centers. Micellar formation further solubilizes the lipids and provides a mechanism for their transport to the enterocytes. Thus, the micelles move down their concentration gradient through the unstirred layer to the brush border of the mucosal cells. The lipids diffuse out of the micelles, and a saturated aqueous solution of the lipids is maintained in contact with the brush border of the mucosal cells",

Activation of the POMC neurons decreases food intake and increases energy expenditure, whereas activation of the NPY-AGRP neurons increases food intake and reduces energy expenditure, these neurons are major targets for the actions of several hormones that regulate appetite, including leptin, insulin, CCK, and ghrelin. There are two distinct types of neurons in the arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus that are especially important as controllers of both appetite and energy expenditure: (1) pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons that produce a-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (a-MSH) together with cocaine- and amphetamine-related transcript (CART), and (2) neurons that produce the orexigenic substances neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AGRP). NT and hormones influencing feeding and satiety centres in hypothalamus. Anorexingenic (decrease feeding). Orexigenic (increase feeding)# Alpha-MSH# Neuropeptide Y (NPY)# Leptin# Agouti-related protein (AGRP)# Serotonin# Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)# Norepinephrine# Orexins A and B# CRH# Endorphins# Insulin# Galanin (GAL)# CCK# Amino acids (glutamate & GABA)# Glucagon like ppetide# Cortisol# Cocaine and amphetamine regulatd transcript (CART)# Ghrelin# Peptide YY(PYY) Ghrelin# Ghrelin is a hormone released mainly by the oxyntic cells of the stomach but also, to a much less extent, by the intestine.# Blood levels of ghrelin rise during fasting, peak just before eating, and then fall rapidly after a meal, suggesting a possible role in stimulating feeding.# Also, administration of ghrelin increases food intake in experimental animals, further supporting the possibility that it may be an orexigenic hormone. Leptin:# hypothalamus senses energy storage through the actions of leptin, a peptide hormone released from adipocytes. Leptin circulates to the brain, where it moves across the BBB by facilitated diffusion and occupies leptin receptors at multiple sites in the hypothalamus, especially the POMC neurons of the arcuate nuclei and neurons of the paraventricular nuclei. Stimulation of leptin receptors in these hypothalamic nuclei initiates multiple actions that decrease fat storage, including: (l). decreased production in the hypothalamus of appetite stimulators, such as NPY and AGRP; (2) activation of POMC neurons, causing release of a-MSH and activation of melanocortin receptors; (3) increased production in the hypothalamus of substances, such as corticotropin-releasing hormone, that decrease food intake; (4) increased sympathetic nerve activity (through neural projections from the hypothalamus to the vasomotor centers), which increases metabolic rate and energy expenditure; and (5) decreased insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cells, which decreases energy storage. Thus. leptin mav be an important means bv which the adipose tissue signals the brain that enough energy has been stored and that intake of food is no longer necessary. Peptide YY(PYY)# Peptide YY (PYY) is secreted from the entire GIT, but especially from the ileum and colon. Food intake stimulates release of PYY, with blood concentrations rising to peak levels 1 to 2 hours after ingesting a meal. These peak levels of PYY are influenced by the number of calories ingested and the composition of the food, with higher levels of PYY observed after meals with a high fat content.

They are formed by the action of colonic bacteria on complex carbohydrates, resistant starches, and other components of the dietary fiber, that is, the material that escapes digestion in the upper GIT and enters the colon.# Absorbed SCFAs are metabolized and make a significant contribution to the total caloric intake. In addition, they exert a trophic effect on the colonic epithelial cells, combat inflammation, and are absorbed in part by exchange for H+, helping to maintain acid-base equilibrium.

Flaem iron is better absorbed than inorganic iron, but the major fraction of diet is inorganic iron. Inorganic iron is mostly in ferric form; needs to be reduced to ferrous form because iron is absorbed in ferrous form.* After absorption ferrous form is once again oxidized to ferric form inside enterocytes. A fraction of absorbed iron is rapidly delivered to plasma transferrin. However, most of the iron is deposited in the enterocytes as ferritin, some to be transferred more slowly to plasma transferrin, and some to be lost when senescent mucosal cells (enterocytes) are sloughed into the intestine.* Iron absorption is regulated according to the demand, e. g., when there is iron deficiency, absorption increases. This regulation is mediated by uiron metabolism regulatory hormone\", i. e., hepcidin that inhibit iron absorption. When there is iron deficiency, concentration of hepacidin falls and there is increase iron absorption. Hepacidin also decreases release of iron from storage sites.

Overdistension is perceived as discomfort. Adaptive relaxation appears to malfunction in the forms of functional dyspepsia characterized by the symptoms described in this question. If adaptive relaxation is compromised (e. g., by an enteric neuropathy), mechanoreceptors are activated at lower distending volumes and the CNS wrongly interprets the signals as if the gastric reservoir were full.

Secondary active transport represents a combination of primary active transport and facilitated diffusion.* It is exemplified by glucose transport across intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, the Na+K+ pump operates at the basolateral border of the cell and maintains intracellular concentration of Na+ very low. The low intracellular Na+ concentration provides the necessory concentration gradient for Na+ to diffuse in passively at the luminal border through facilitated cotransport with glucose. Thus, the Na+K+ pump (Na+K+ ATPase) indirectly powers the movement of glucose into the cell, and glucose can move in against a concentration gradient so long as Na+ diffuses in along a concentration gradient.* It is important to know that at luminal border, Na+ is transported by facilitated diffusion (as it diffuses along a concentration gradient) while the glucose is transported actively (against a concentration gradient) and the energy is provided by Na+K+ ATPase at basolateral border - So, secondary active transport is a combination of active transport (glucose transport against concentration gradient) and facilitated diffusion (Na+ transport along concentration gradient by carrier protein).",

COBALAMIN* In nature, the vitamin is mainly in the 2-deoxyadenosyl (ado) form, which is located in mitochondria. It is the cofactor for the enzyme methylmalonyl coenzyme A (CoA) mutase.* The other major natural cobalamin is methylcobalamin, the form in human plasma and in cell cytoplasm. It is the cofactor for methionine synthase.* Two mechanisms exist for cobalamin absorption. o Passive: occurring equally through buccal, duodenal, and ileal mucosa; it is rapid but extremely inefficient, with <1% of an oral dose being absorbed by this process, o The normal physiologic mechanism is active; it occurs through the ileum and is efficient for small (a few micrograms) oral doses of cobalamin# Mediated by gastric intrinsic factor (IF).# Dietary cobalamin is released from protein complexes by enzymes in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum# It combines rapidly with a salivary glycoprotein known as haptocorrins (HCs).# In the intestine, the haptocorrin is digested by pancreatic trypsin and the cobalamin is transferred to IF.* IF (gene at chromosome 11q13) is produced in the gastric parietal cells.* The IF-cobalamin complex passes to the ileum, where IF attaches to a specific receptor (cubilin) on the microvillus membrane of the enterocytes.* Cubilin also is present in yolk sac and renal proximal tubular epithelium.* The cobalamin-IF complex enters the ileal cell, where IF is destroyed.* After a delay of about 6 h, cobalamin appears in portal blood attached to transcobalamin II.* Between 0. 5 and 5 mg of cobalamin enter the bile each day.* This binds to IF, and a major portion of biliary cobalamin normally is reabsorbed together with cobalamin derived from sloughed intestinal cells.* Because of the appreciable amount of cobalamin undergoing enterohepatic circulation, cobalamin deficiency develops more rapidly in individuals who malabsorb cobalamin than it does in vegans, in whom reabsorption of biliary cobalamin is intact.",

The other forms of carbohydrate which are consumed in substantial amounts are sucrose and lactose.* Starch is a polysaccharide composed entirely of glucose units linked by 1, 4- alpha linkage and 1, 6 branching points. What it means that carbon atom -1 of a glucose unit is linked to carbon atom - 4 of the adjacent glucose unit, and that bond is of alpha - type. At the branching points, carbon atom-1 is linked to carbon atom-6 of the adjacent glucose unit.* Digestion of starch starts in the mouth itself by salivary amylase (ptylin). But the hydrolysis by salivary amylase cannot proceed much because the optimal pH for the reaction is 6-7 which is very different from the highly acidic environment of the stomach. The process is resumed by 'pancreatic amylase' in the small intestine.* Further digestion of starch derivatives (Disaccharides) occurs by the enzymes (oligosaccharidases) present in the brush border of small intestinal epithelial cells.* Maltase (a-glucosidase) breaks 1: 4 linkages in maltose and maltotriose and releases glucose (two molecules of glucose from maltose and three molecules of glucose from maltotriose).* Isomaltase (a-limit dextrinase) breaks 1: 6a linkages of alpha-limit dextrin and releases glucose. Isomaltase (a-limit dextrinase) is the only enzyme that attacks 1: 6a linkage.* Sucrose is hydrolysed into fructose and glucose by sucrase (an enzyme present in brush border of intestinal epithelium).
