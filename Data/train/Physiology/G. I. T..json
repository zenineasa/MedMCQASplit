        "question": "Secretin is produced by which of the following duodenal cells?",
        "exp": "Ans. D. S cells. (Ref. Guyton's Medical Physiology 11th/pg. 801; Ganong 23rd/ Chapter 36). GI secretory products1. Nitrous oxide: Causes smooth muscle relaxation (e. g., elower oesophageal sphincter (LES) relaxtion). 2. Gastrin: Secreted in response to gastric distention, vagal stimulation, and amino acid entering the stomach; causes gastric H+ secretion. 3. Secretin: Secreted in response to H+ and fatty acids entering the duodenum; causes pancreatid secretion of of HCO3 and inhibits gastrin H+ secretion. It is known as Nature's antacid as after being secreted by 'S' cells of duodenum it causes, secretion of bicarbonate from pancreas, which neutralises gastric acid. 4. Cholecystokinin (CCK): Secreted in response to amino acids and fatty acids entering the duodenum; causes contraction of gallbladder and pancreatic secretion of enzymes and HC03 (AIIMS-99). 5. Parasympathetic (ACh): Increases production of saliva; increased gastric H+ secretion; increases pancreatic enzyme and HCO3+ secretion; stimulates enteric nervous system to create intestinal peristalisis; relaxes sphincters. 6. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP): Secreted by smooth muscle and nerves of intestines. Relaxes intestinal smooth muscle causes pancreatic HC03 secretion and inhibits gastric H+ secretion. 7. Sympathetic (NE): Increases production of saliva; deceases spalnchnic blood flow in fight-or-flight response: decreases motility; constricts sphincters. Hormone. Source. Action. Regulation. Notes.

When acid chyme with pH less than 4. 5 to 5. 0 enters the duodenum from the stomach, it causes duodenal mucosal release and activation of secretin, which is then absorbed into the blood. The one truly potent constituent of chyme that causes this secretin release is the hydrochloric acid from the stomach.# Secretin in turn causes the pancreas to secrete large quantities of fluid containing a high concentration of bicarbonate ion (up to 145 m. Eq/L) but a low concentration of chloride ion. The secretin mechanism is especially important for two reasons: First, secretin begins to be released from the mucosa of the small intestine when the pH of the duodenal contents falls below 4. 5 to 5. 0, and its release increases greatly as the pH falls to 3. 0. This immediately causes copious secretion of pancreatic juice containing abundant amounts of sodium bicarbonate. Cholecystokinin# The presence of food in the upper small intestine also causes a second hormone, cholecystokinin, a polypeptide containing 33 amino acids, to be released 'I cells', in the mucosa of the duodenum and upper jejunum. This release of cholecystokinin results especially from the presence of proteoses and peptones and long-chain fatty acids in the chyme coming from the stomach.# The differences between the pancreatic stimulatory effects of secretin and Cholecystokinin:- intense sodium bicarbonate secretion in response to acid in duodenum, stimulated by secretin, - a dual effect in response to soap (a fat), and- intense digestive enzyme secretion (when peptones enter duodenum) stimulated by CCK. Educational points: Basic Stimuli That Cause Pancreatic Secretion. Three basic stimuli are important in causing pancreatic secretion: 1. Acetylcholine, which is released from the parasympathetic vagus nerve endings and from other cholinergic nerves in the enteric nervous system2. Cholecystokinin, which is secreted by duodenal and upper jejunal mucosa when food enters small bowel3. Secretin, which is also secreted by duodenal and jejunal mucosa when highly acid food enters small bowel. The presence of acid, fat, protein breakdown products, hyperosmotic or hypo-osmotic fluids, or any irritating factor in the upper small intestine causes release of several intestinal hormones. One of these is secretin, which is especially important for control of pancreatic secretion. However, secretin opposes stomach secretion. Three other hormones--gastric inhibitory peptide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and somatostatin--also have slight to moderate effects in inhibiting gastric secretion.",

Deglutition is one of the most complex reflex neural activities. c. The initial phase is voluntary when food is chewed, mixed with saliva and formed into a bolus before being pushed to the posterior pharynx by the tongue. Receptors in the posterior pharynx are then activated to initiate the involuntary phase of deglutition, which involves carefully sequenced contraction of numerous head and neck muscles. d. Secondary peristalsis refers to peristalsis activated by esophageal distention. e. This can occur physiologically by food left behind after the primary peristaltic wave has passed, or by refluxed contents from the stomach. f. Unlike primary peristalsis, secondary peristalsis is not accompanied by deglutition with associated pharyngeal and upper esophageal sphincter motor function.",

        "question": "Dietary triglyceride is a major source of nutrient for the human body. It is digested mostly in the intestinal lumen by pancreatic lipase to release:",
        "exp": "Ans. D. 2-Monoglyceride and fatty acidsa. Pancreatic lipase hydrolyzes triglyceride to form 2-monoglyceride and two fatty acids. The hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine, not triglyceride, results in the formation of lysophosphatidylcholines. Although diglyceride is an intermediate in the hydrolysis of triglyceride by pancreatic lipase, the hydrolysis continues until 2-monoglyceride and fatty acids are formed. Pancreatic lipase does not hydrolyze triglyceride totally to form glycerol and fatty acids. b. Most fat digestion therefore begins in the duodenum, pancreatic lipase being one of the most important enzymes involved. This enzyme hydrolyzes the 1- and 3-bonds of the triglycerides (triacylglycerors) with relative ease but acts on the 2-bonds at a very low rate, so the principal products of its action are free fatty acids and 2-monoglycerides (2- monoacylglycerols). It acts on fats that have been emulsified (see below). Its activity is facilitated when an amphipathic helix that covers the active site like a lid is bent back. c. Colipase, a protein with a molecular weight of about 11, 000, is also secreted in the pancreatic juice, and when this molecule binds to the -COOH-terminal domain of the pancreatic lipase, opening of the lid is facilitated. Colipase is secreted in an inactive proform and is activated in the intestinal lumen by trypsin. Another pancreatic lipase that is activated by bile salts has been characterized. This 100, 000-k. Da cholesterol esterase represents about 4% of the total protein in pancreatic juice. In adults, pancreatic lipase is 10-60 times more active, but unlike pancreatic lipase, this bile salt-activated lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters, esters of fat-soluble vitamins, and phospholipids, as well as triglycerides. A very similar enzyme is found in human milk. d. Fats are relatively insoluble, which limits their ability to cross the unstirred layer and reach the surface of the mucosal cells. However, they are finely emulsified in the small intestine by the detergent action of bile salts, lecithin, and monoglyceride. When the concentration of bile salts in the intestine is high, as it is after contraction of the gallbladder, lipids and bile salts interact spontaneously to form micelles. These cylindrical aggregates, take up lipids, and although their lipid concentration varies, they generally contain fatty acids, monoglyceride, and cholesterol in their hydrophobic centers. Micellar formation further solubilizes the lipids and provides a mechanism for their transport to the enterocytes. Thus, the micelles move down their concentration gradient through the unstirred layer to the brush border of the mucosal cells. The lipids diffuse out of the micelles, and a saturated aqueous solution of the lipids is maintained in contact with the brush border of the mucosal cells",

Pancreatic enzymes are secreted in an inactive (Zymogen) form. These are trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen proelastase, procarboxy-peptidase A and procarboxypeptidase B. Trypsinogen is initially activated by enterokinase (enteropeptidase), an enzyme present in brush border of small intestinal epithelial cells.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Duodenum * Iron is absorbed from upper small intestine mainly duodenum. In diet iron occurs in two forms, haeme iron and inorganic (non-haeme) iron. Flaem iron is better absorbed than inorganic iron, but the major fraction of diet is inorganic iron. Inorganic iron is mostly in ferric form; needs to be reduced to ferrous form because iron is absorbed in ferrous form.* After absorption ferrous form is once again oxidized to ferric form inside enterocytes. A fraction of absorbed iron is rapidly delivered to plasma transferrin. However, most of the iron is deposited in the enterocytes as ferritin, some to be transferred more slowly to plasma transferrin, and some to be lost when senescent mucosal cells (enterocytes) are sloughed into the intestine.* Iron absorption is regulated according to the demand, e. g., when there is iron deficiency, absorption increases. This regulation is mediated by uiron metabolism regulatory hormone\", i. e., hepcidin that inhibit iron absorption. When there is iron deficiency, concentration of hepacidin falls and there is increase iron absorption. Hepacidin also decreases release of iron from storage sites. Factors affecting iron absorptioni).

When the limits of adaptive relaxation in the reservoir are reached, signals from the stretch receptors in the reservoir's walls account for the sensations of fullness and satiety. Overdistension is perceived as discomfort. Adaptive relaxation appears to malfunction in the forms of functional dyspepsia characterized by the symptoms described in this question. If adaptive relaxation is compromised (e. g., by an enteric neuropathy), mechanoreceptors are activated at lower distending volumes and the CNS wrongly interprets the signals as if the gastric reservoir were full.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Lactulose * Lactulose is not digested or absorbed from the small intestine and it therefore acts as substrate for ferment ation and, hence as a colonic acidifier and an osmotic laxative.* Digestion of Carbohydrate* The most abundant carbohydrate in our food is starch. The other forms of carbohydrate which are consumed in substantial amounts are sucrose and lactose.* Starch is a polysaccharide composed entirely of glucose units linked by 1, 4- alpha linkage and 1, 6 branching points. What it means that carbon atom -1 of a glucose unit is linked to carbon atom - 4 of the adjacent glucose unit, and that bond is of alpha - type. At the branching points, carbon atom-1 is linked to carbon atom-6 of the adjacent glucose unit.* Digestion of starch starts in the mouth itself by salivary amylase (ptylin). But the hydrolysis by salivary amylase cannot proceed much because the optimal pH for the reaction is 6-7 which is very different from the highly acidic environment of the stomach. The process is resumed by 'pancreatic amylase' in the small intestine.* Further digestion of starch derivatives (Disaccharides) occurs by the enzymes (oligosaccharidases) present in the brush border of small intestinal epithelial cells.* Maltase (a-glucosidase) breaks 1: 4 linkages in maltose and maltotriose and releases glucose (two molecules of glucose from maltose and three molecules of glucose from maltotriose).* Isomaltase (a-limit dextrinase) breaks 1: 6a linkages of alpha-limit dextrin and releases glucose. Isomaltase (a-limit dextrinase) is the only enzyme that attacks 1: 6a linkage.* Sucrose is hydrolysed into fructose and glucose by sucrase (an enzyme present in brush border of intestinal epithelium). Lactose is hydrolysed into galactose and glucose by lactase (b-glucosidase). Trehalase hydrolyzes trehelose (a 1: 1 a - linked dimer of glucose) into two glucose molecules. Trehalose is found in mushrooms.",

These movements usually occur only one to three times each day. A mass movement is a modified type of peristalsis.* Appearance of mass movements after a meal is facilitated by gastrocolic and duodenum reflexes. These reflexes result from the distension of the stomach and duodenum. The best example of gastrocolic reflex is seen in early infancy where defecation often follows a meal.",
