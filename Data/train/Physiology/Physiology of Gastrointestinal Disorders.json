        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Acetylcholine Lower esophageal sphinctero Unlike the rest of the esophagus, the musculature of the gastroesophageal junction (lower esophageal sphincter: LES) is tonically active but relaxes on swallowing, o The tonic activity of the LES between meals prevents reflux of gastirc contents into the esophagus, o The LES is made up of three components. o The esophageal smooth muscle is more prominent at the junction with the stomach (intrinsic sphincter), o Fibers of the crural portion of the diaphragm, a skeletal, a skeletal muscles, surround the esophagus at this point (extrinsic sphincter) and exert a pinchcock-like action on the esophagus. In addition, the oblique or sling fibers of the stomach wall create a flap valve that helps close off the esophagogastric junction and prevent regurgitation when intragastric pressure rises, o The tone of the LES is under neural control. o Release of acetylcholine front vagal endings causes the intrinsic sphincter to contact, and release of NO and VIP from interneurons innervated by other vagal fibers causes it to relax. o Contraction of the crural portion of the diaphragm, which is innervated by the phrenic nerves, is coordinated with respiration and contractions of chest and abdominal muscles, o Thus, the intrinsic and extrinsic sphincters operate together to permit orderly flow' of food into the stomach and to prevent reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus.",
