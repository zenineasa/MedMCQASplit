Thick ascending segment (limb)o Thick ascending limb is almost totally impermeable to water.o However, this segment has a pump for active absorption of sodium.o Absorption of sodium and other solutes without absorption of wrater results in dilution of the tubular fluid and fluid coming out from thick ascending limb is hypotonic to plasma,o Therefore, ascending limb is also called diluting segment. 30% of filtered Na+ is reabsorbed in ascending limb (60% is reabsorbed in proximal tubule).o In the thick ascending limb, a carrier (Na+ K+ 2C1- transporter) transports one Na-, one K+ and two Cl- from the tubular lumen into the tubular cells.o This is another example of secondary active transport. From the cells Na' is actively transported to the peritubular interstitium, across the basolateral membrane, by Na+ K+ ATPase.o The K+ diffuses back into the tubular lumen and into the interstitium via ROMK and other K+ channels,o Some other ions are also reabsorbed e.g..
