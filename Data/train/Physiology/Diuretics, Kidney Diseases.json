        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Loss of negative charge on membrane o Sialoproteins in the glomerular capillary wall are negatively charged, and studies with anionically charged and cationically charged dextrans indicate that the negative charges repel negatively charged substances in blood, with the result that filtration of anionic substances 4 nm in diameter is less than half that of neutral substances of the same size. o This probably explains why albumin, with an effective molecular diameter of approximately 7 nm, normally has a glomerular concentration only 0. 2% of its plasma concentration rather than the higher concentration that would be expected on the basis of diameter alone; circulating albumin is negatively charged, o In certain kidney diseases, the negative charges on the basement membrane are lost even before there are noticeable changes in kidney histology, a condition referred to as minimal change nephropathy, o As a result of this loss of negative charges on the basement membranes, some of the lower-molecular-weight proteins, especially albumin, are filtered and appear in the urine, a condition known as proteinuria or albuminuria.",
