        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., K+ Genesis of RMPo The cell membrane is selectively permeable. Due to presence of potassium leak channels K+ ions are freely permeable but permeability of Na+ is much less. In the generation of RMP, following sequence of events occur:-i) K+ diffuses out of cell along its concentration gradient (K+ concentration is very high inside the cells and very low in ECF). ii) The diffusion of K+ produces an intracellular negativity (due to non-diffusible protein anion in the cells) which is not nullified by the diffusion of Na+ in the opposite direction (membrane is impermeable to Na+) or diffusion of Cl- in same direction (Cl- concentration is already very high in ECF in comparison to ICF). iii) So, intracellular negativity is produced which opposes outward diffusion of K+ and when the equilibrium is reached, the inward force on K+ due to electrical gradient balances outward force on K+ due to concentation gradient. iv) Finally, at equilibrium inner side of cell is negatively charged with respect to outer side, and resting membrane potential is produced. o So, the RMP is principally due to concentration difference (chemical difference) of K+ in ECF and ICF. In neurons, the resting membrane potential is usually about -70 mV, which is close to the equilibrium potential for K+. Here, it is worth noting that RMP is close to the equilibrium potential of K+ but the value of RMP is exactly same as equilibrium potential of Cl-. It is because other ions also diffuse through membrane, though their effect is very little.",

        "question": "When sodium enters cells -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e.. There is spike in action potentialo Na+ influx causes spike potential (i. e. phase of rapid depolarization in AP). o Spike potential (phase of rapid depolarization of AP) is due to Na+ influx. o Action potentials in nonautomatic fibers (Atria, ventricles) and in automatic fibers (S A node, AV node) have different ionic mechanisms for their generation. Action potential in nonautomatic fibers, i. e.. Cardiac muscles (atria, ventricles)o Normal RMPin myocardial fibers is about -90 mV. The AP in myocardial fibers has 5 phases: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Phase 0: - It is the phase of rapid depolarization and is due to opening offast sodium channels. Phase 1: - It is the initial phase of rapid repolarization. It is due to closure offast Na+ channels. Phase 2: - This is plateu phaseQ. It is due to opening of'voltage gated slow Ca+ channelsQ. also called calcium- sodium channelsQ which causes calcium influxQ. Phase 3: - This phase of final repolarization is due to opening of K+ channels. The membrane potential comes back to resting membrane potential. Phase 4: - It is the resting phase, i. e., the phase of resting membrane potential. Action potential in automatic fibers f. SA node and AY node)o The resting membrane potential of nodal fibers is less, i. e., about -65 mV (as compared to myocardium: -90 mV). Further, Resting membrane potential, even during resting phase (phase 4), moves steadily towards the depolarization, without any stimulus from nerves, hormones etc. When depolarization reaches a threshold level, an action potential is fired. Thus, between two action potentials (between the end of one action potentials and begining of other) there is slow and gradual depolarization which is called pacemaker potential or prepotential. The functional significance of the unsteady RMP is that nodal tissues generates rhythmic impulse \"spontaneously\"o Beside unsteady RMP (unsteady phase 4) other differences of nodal action potential from myocardial (atrial orventricular) AP are:- (i) Rapid repolarization and the platea (phase 1 and 2) are absent; and (ii) the late rapiddepolarization is slow. o Ionic basis of AP in S A and AV node are as follows: - The prepotential or pacemaker potentialQ (i. e., slow depolarization) starts due opening of funny (F) channelsQ which produce funny current. These channels are called funny channels because (i) Unlike most other channels, these are activated by hyperpolarization, and (ii) They can pass both Na+ and K+ (However, the dominant effect is that of Na\" influx). The later part of prepotential is due to opening of \"T\" type of calcium channelsQ (T stands for transient ) with calcium influx. When prepontial depolarizes the membrane upto threshold level, action potential develops. The action potential spike is largely due to opening of L type of calcium channels (L stands for long lasting) which causes Ca+2 influx. The repolarization is produced by opening of K+ channels which causes K+ efflux.",

Since ions are charged particles their diffusion can be stopped by an appropriate electrical potential (E) applied across the membrane o The magnitude and polarity of the potential (equilibrium potential) that must be applied to side A of the membrane for stopping the diffusion of ions (EA) is given by Nernst equation, i. e., the equilibrium potential for an ion is calculated by Nernst equation. o For example, if solution A contains an ion with a negative charge in more concentration than the concentration of the same ion in solution B, the ion will diffuse from A to B along the concentration gradient. If an electric gradient is created in opposite direction, the magnitude of the potential that completely counteracts this diffusion (from A to B) is called equilibrium potential. # EMF = +- 61 CA/CB # Where EMF is electromotive force or equilibrium potential in millivolts. o For example, the application of Nernst equation to the concentration of K+ in ICF (150 m.
