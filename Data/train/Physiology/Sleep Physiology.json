Stage 2 NREM (Ref: Ganong 24/e p273; Guyton ll/e p741-743)Sleep spindles and K-complexes are seen in stage 2 NREM of sleep.'There are two different kinds of sleep: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (SREM), or slow-wave sleep. NREM sleep is divided into four stages. A person falling asleep first enters stage 1, which is characterized by low-amplitude, high-frequency EEG activity. Stage 2 is marked by the appearance of sleep spindles. These are bursts of alpha-like, 10-14 Hz, 50 uV waves. In stage 3, the pattern is one of lower frequency and increased amplitude of the EEG waves. Maximum slowing with large waves is seen in stage 4. Thus, the characteristic of deep sleep is a pattern of rhythmic slow waves, indieating marked synchronization. - Ganong 24/e p273EOG, electro-oculogram registering eye movements; EMG. electromyogram registering skeletal muscle activity; CENTRAL, FRONTAL, OCCIP, three EEG leads.

        "question": "Sleep spindles are seen in which stage of sleep -",
        "exp": "Ans is 'c' i.e., Stage 2 NREM Stages of sleepo Sleep is basically divided into two phases :-Non-REM (NREM) or slow-wave sleep It is called Non-REM sleep because no rapid eye movement (REM) is there on eletrooculogram, rather there is slow or quiscent eye movement. It is also referred as S- sleep (synchronized sleep) or quiet sleep or orthodox sleep because there is diminished physiological functions and a low level of overall activity. It is further divided into : -Stage I It is a transition from wakefulness to sleep and is characterized by disappearance of alpha activity and appearance of theta activity. There is slow eye movements.Stage 2 It is characterized by typical EEG activity i.e., Sleep spindles and 'K-complex' .No eye movement occurs.Stage 3 & 4 Stage 3 & 4 are stages of deep sleep. These are also called slow wave sleep as these stages are characterized by slow delta waves. Delta wrave appearance starts in stage 3 and dominated in stage 4.REM sleep The REM sleep is so named as there is rapid roving movements of eye, i.e., rapid eye movement (REM)on electro-oculogram. It is also called paradoxical sleep because there is a paradoxical elevation of brain activity & metabolism and physiological activity. The high-amplitude slow waves seen in stage 3,4 of REM sleep is replaced by rapid lowr voltage activity (Beta wave). Features of REM sleep are:-EEG - Beta-wave, Reappearance of alpha wave. Saw-tooth wave (low voltage fast activity), Ponto-genital-occipital spikes.Dreamingiii) Other features :- Generalized muscular atony. Penile erection, autonomic hyperactivity (Increased pulse rate & BP) and intermittent movement of small muscle groups.o The NREM (with its four stages) and REM sleep repeat several times a night in cyclic manner, 4-6 times depending on the length of sleep. A typical cycle starts with stage 1 of the NREM sleep which is followed by second, third and fourth stages. After this the sleep returns to stage 3 and 2. The first REM sleep occurs now, 70-90 minutes after the the commencement of sleep (Note : - Stage 1 NREM sleep occurs only once at the start of the sleep as this is only a transition phase between wakefulness and sleep. Once the sleep starts the cycle rotates between stage 2, 3, 4 NREM and REM sleep). REM sleep occupies 20-30% of total sleep and NREM sleep occupies 60-70% (Stage-1 - 5-10%; Stage 2 - 40-50%; Stage 3 & 4 - 15-20%).",
