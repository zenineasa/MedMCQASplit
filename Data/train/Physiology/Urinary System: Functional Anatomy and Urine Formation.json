Explanation: Each kidney in the human contains about 800, 000 to 1, 000, 000 nephrons, each capable of forming urine. The kidney cannot regenerate new nephrons. After age 40. the number of functioning nephrons usually decreases about 10 % every 10years. At age 80. many people have 40 % fewer functioning nephrons than they did at age 40. This loss is not life threatening because adaptive changes in the remaining nephrons allow them to excrete the proper amounts of water, electrolytes, and waste products",

Renin is a protein enzyme released by the kidneys when the arterial pressure falls too low. Renin itself is an enzyme, not a vasoactive substance. Renin acts enzymatically on another plasma protein, a globulin called renin substrate (or angiotensinogen), to release a 10-amino acid peptide, angiotensin I. Hence it is a proteolytic enzyme,",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Kidney. Ervthropoitino Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein hormone which stimulate erythrocyte production. Erythropoietin increases the number of erythropoietin sensitive committed stem cells in the bone marrow that are converted to red blood cells precursors and subsequently to mature erythrocytes. In the absence of erythropoietin, erythroid stem cellsundergo apoptosis. o In adults, about 85% of erythropoietin comes from the kidney (interstitial cells in peritubular capillary bed) and 15% from liver (Perivenous hepatoevtes). Small amount is also produced in brain; and uterus and oviducts. Certain tumors also produce erythropoietin,. e. g., Renal cell carcinoma. Hepatoma and cerebellar hemangioblastoma. o The most important stimulus for erythropoietin secretion is hypoxia. Other stimulus that can increase its secretion are cobalt salts, androgens, alkalosis due to high altitude, and catecholamines via b-adrenergic mechanism. o Pregnancy (due to placental lactogen), testosterone and prolactin increase the activity of erythropoietin. Estrogen inhibits utilization of erythropoietin by marrow cells and also impairs its production. Progesterone increase the effect of erythropoietin by enhancing the effect of placental lactogen and by antagonizing the effect of estrogen.",
