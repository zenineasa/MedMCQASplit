        "question": "Contraction of muscle can be caused by -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Release of acetylcholine o The process by which excitation (depolarization) of muscle fiber initiates its contraction is known as excitation contraction coupling. o The skeletal muscle fiber is innervated by A-a motor neuron. o When A-a motor neuron is stimulated, it carries the impulse (action potential) to neuromuscular junction where release of acetylcholineQ from presynaptic vesicle occurs. Acetylcholine binds to specific receptors (NmnicotinicQ) on motor-end plate (post-synaptic membrane). o This results in production of end-plate potential. If end-plate potential depolarizes the motor-end plate to firing (threshold) level, action potential is produced. o Once the Ca2+ concentration outside the reticulum has been lowered sufficiently, chemical interaction between myosin and actin ceases and the muscle relaxes, o This is due to reuptake of Ca2+ by sarcoplasmic reticulum, o Thus during relaxation:- Cytoplasmic concentration of Ca^ decreases. Sarcoplasmic reticulum concentration of Ca\"2 increases. About option 'a'o Ca2+(ion) does not move out of cytoplasm (i. e. extracellular). Ca\"2is taken up by sarcoplasmic reticulum. Mechanism of muscle contractiono The Ca+2 released from the terminal cisterns bind with troponin C and this triggers further steps in muscle contraction(AI 08) Ca+2- Troponin - C complex induces changes in troponin I and Troponin-T, which in turn brings about a lateral shift of tropomyosin awray from active sites of actin. As a result, the binding sites (active sites) on the actin filament are exposed. o ATP binds to myosin and myosin splits this ATP into ADP due to its ATPase activity. The energy released activates the myosin and the activated myosin head binds to active sites of actin filament, i. e.. Cross-bridging of myosin with actin. This cross-bridging immediately produces bending (flexion) of myosin head from 90deg to 45deg. Bending of myosin head produces \"power stroke' that causes sliding of actin on myosin and muscle contraction, o As the myosin head flexes to 45,:' (during power stroke), the ADP present on it is cast off making way for a fresh molecule of ATP. When fresh ATP binds to myosin ATPase, the myosin head detaches from actin and the cross-bridge repeats all over-again till the contraction is complete - So, this is called cross-bridge cycle. o During contraction: -Z lines come closerQ thereby shortenining sarcomereH-band disappearsQ. Width of I band decreasesQ. Width of A band is unchaged.

Mechanism of relaxationo Relaxation is due to removal of calcium ions from sarcoplasm into terminal cisterns by active transport (Ca+2 ATPase). Due to this calcium pump (Ca+2 ATPase) the concentration of Ca+2 ions in terminal cisterns of sarcoplasmic reticulum is very high and very low in sarcoplasm.

        "exp": "Ans is 'b' i. e., Tendon. Golgi tendon reflexo Golgi tendon reflex is a bisynaptic reflex, initiated by the Golgi tendon organ located in muscle tendons, o This organ consists of a net-like (ramified) collection of knobby nerve endings among the fascicles of a tendon, o There are 3-25 muscle fiber per golgi tendon organ. o Golgi tendon organs are also stretch receptors. o However, unlike the muscle spindle which acts as a length detecfer, the Golgi-tendon organ acts as a muscle tension-detector. o This difference in sensory function occurs because muscle spindle is located in parallel to the muscle fibers (extrafusal fibers) while the Golgi tendon organ is located in series to the muscle fibers (extrafusal fibers), o Therefore, Golgi tendon organs are stimulated by both passive stretch and contraction of muscle (in contrast to muscle spindle which is stimulated by passive stretch but is inhibited by active contraction of muscle), o The golgi tendon organ is innervated by Act sensory (afferent) fibers (ty pe lb sensory). o These afferent fibers terminate on an inhibitory interneuron in dorsal horn of grey matter in the spinal cord, o These inhibitory' intemeuron terminates on the a-motor neuron (same a-motor neuron on which la (Act) afferent of stretch reflex terminates) and has inhibitory effect on a-motor neuron, o So, activation of Golgi tendon reflex results in relaxation of muscle.",

        "question": "Regarding Golgi tendon organ true is",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e. senses muscle tension. The Golgi Tendon organ is an encapsulated sensory receptor through which muscle tendon fibres pass and it is stimulated by increased tension in the connecting muscle. So basically detects muscle tension as reflected by the tension in itself. Whereas muscle spindle (other sensory receptor) detects muscle length and changes in muscle length. Golgi tendon organ - detects muscle tension. Muscle spindle - detects muscle length and changes in muscle length. Muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organ both receptors are important component of intrinsic muscle control. Muscle spindle acts through muscle stretch reflex. Whenever a muscle is stretched suddenly, excitation of the spindles cause reflex contraction of the large skeletal muscle fibres of stretched muscle thus maintain the muscle length & stabilize body positions during tense motor action. Stretch reflex also prevents oscillations & jerkiness of body movements. However when the tension in muscle becomes great enough, contraction suddenly ceases and the muscle relaxes. This relaxation in response to strong stretch is called the inverse stretch reflex, autogenic inhibition or lengthening reaction. The receptor for this reflex is in the Golgi tendon organ. This is a protective mechanism to prevent tearing of the muscle or avulsion of the tendon from its attachment to the bone. Reciprocal innervation is the phenomenon in which relaxation of antagonistic muscles occur when a stretch reflex occurs and Golgi bottle neurons (inhibitory intetneuron) are involved in this phenomenon. a-motor neurons are anterior motor neuron (located in ant. horn of spinal cord) and when stimulated cause contraction of muscle fibres. Golgi tendon organs when stimulated cause a -motor neuron inhibition (Muscle spindle stimulation causes a-motor neuron excitation)",
