In humans, ACTH irregular bursts (episodes of high secretion) are most frequent in early morning and least frequent in the evening. Increased ACTH secretion is not d/t stress of getting up in the morning as these bursts occur before waking up. Even if the length of day is experimentally lengthened to >24 hrs ie if the person is isolated and day's activities are spread over more than 24h, the adrenal cycle also lengthens, but the ACTH burst still occurs during period of sleep. The circadian rhythm of ACTH secretion is present in patients Eosinophil with adrenal insufficiency receiving constant dose of glucocoicoids.- Coisol decrease the number of circulating eosinophils by increasing their sequestration in the spleen & lung. So the diurnal variations in blood eosinophilic counts is inversely related to the circadian coisol levelsQ. The eosinophilic concentration in blood is < 450 / mL usually.

Aerial hypoxemia is defined as an aerial paial pressure of O2 (i.e. Pao2) < 80 mmHg in an adult who is breathing room air at sea level.- Hypoxia is O2 deficinecy at the tissue level to carry out normal metabolic functions and often occurs when Pao2 is less than 60 mmHg. Anoxia means no O2 at all left in the tissue.-Hypercapnia is an increase in paial pressure of aerial CO2 (Paco2) above the normal range (40 + 2 mmHg) and hypocapnia is abnormally low Paco2 (< 35 mmHg).",

These fibers are responsible .for the blood pressure rise and tachycardia produced by emotions such as sexual excitement and anger.The vasomotor centre is not silent during sleep The vasomotor centre neurons arc tonically active and discharge rhythmically.The vasomotor centre receives inputs from baroreceptors and also from chemoreceptors.The baroreceptors are stretch receptors in the walls of carotid sinus and aoic arch. The baroreceptors are stimulated by distention of the structures in which they are located, and so they discharge at an increased rate when the pressure in these structures rises. Increased baroreceptor discharge inhibits the tonic discharge of sympathetic nerves and excites the vagal innervation of the hea. These neural changes produce vasodilation, venodilation, a drop in blood pressure. bradycardia, and a decrease in cardiac output.Chemoreceptors are located in carotid and aoic bodies. These receptors are primarily activated by a reduction in paial pressure of oxygen (Pa02), but they also respond to an increase in the paial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and pH. Chemoreceptors exe their main effects on respiration; however, their activation also leads to vasoconstriction. Hea rate changes are variable and depend on various factors, including changes in respiration.Factors Affecting the Vasomotor centre (RVLM)Direct stimulationCO2HypoxiaExcitatory inputsCoex hypothalamusMesencephalic periaqueductal grayBrain stein reticular formationPain pathwaysSomatic afferents (somatosympathetic reflex)Carotid and aoic chemoreceptorsInhibitory inputsCoex hypothalamusCaudal ventrolateral medullaCaudal medullary raphe nucleiLung inflation afferentsCarotid, aoic, and cardiopulmonary baroreceptorsThus we see that the cardiovascular system is under neural influences of medulla, which in turn receive feedback from sensory receptors in the vasculature (eg, baroreceptors). An increase in neural output from the brain stem to sympathetic nerves leads to a decrease in blood vessel diameter (aeriolar constriction) and increases in stroke volume and hea rate, which contribute to a rise in blood pressure. This in turn causes an increase in baroreceptor activity, which signals the vasomotor centre to reduce the neural output to sympathetic nerves.Also know:The neurons of vasomotor centre secrete excitatory transmitter- glutamate (and not epinephrine)Inflation of the lungs causes vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure. This response is mediated vagal afferents from the lungs that inhibit vasomotor discharge.In general, stimuli that increase the hea rate also increase blood pressure, whereas those that decrease the hea rate lower blood pressure. However, there are exceptions, such as the production of hypotension and tachycardia by stimulation of atrial stretch receptors and the production of hypeension and bradycardia by increased intracranial pressure (Cushing reflex).Cushing reflex: Increase in intracranial pressure compromises the blood supply to the vasomotor neurons, and the resulting local hypoxia and hypercapnia increase discharge from the vasomotor centre. This results in rise in systemic aerial pressure (Cushing reflex) which tends to restore the blood flow to the medulla. Over a considerable range, the blood pressure rise is propoional to the increase in intracranial pressure. The rise in blood pressure causes a reflex decrease in hea rate the aerial baroreceptors. This is why bradycardia rather than tachycardia is characteristically seen in patients with increased intracranial pressure.",

Hence an increase in DPG concentration shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right. Thus 2,3 DPG causes delivery (unloading) of O2 to the tissues.",

Anything that interferes with venous return also can lead to decreased cardiac output. Some of these factors are the following:\n1. Decreased blood volume. By far, the most common non-cardiac peripheral factor that leads to decreased cardiac output is decreased blood volume, resulting most often from hemorrhage. It is clear why this condition decreases the cardiac output: Loss of blood decreases the filling of the vascular system to such a low level that there is not enough blood in the peripheral vessels to create peripheral vascular pressures high enough to push the blood back to the heart.\n2. Acute venous dilation. On some occasions, the peripheral veins become acutely vasodilated. This results most often when the sympathetic nervous system suddenly becomes inactive. For instance, fainting often results from sudden loss of sympathetic nervous system activity, which causes the peripheral capacitative vessels, especially the veins, to dilate markedly. This decreases the filling pressure of the vascular system because the blood volume can no longer create adequate pressure in the now flaccid peripheral blood vessels. As a result, the blood \u201cpools\u201d in the vessels and does not return to the heart.\n3. Obstruction of the large veins. On rare occasions, the large veins leading into the heart become obstructed, so the blood in the peripheral vessels cannot flow back into the heart. Consequently, the cardiac output falls markedly.\n4. Decreased tissue mass, especially decreased skeletal muscle mass. With normal aging or with prolonged periods of physical inactivity, there is usually a reduction in the size of the skeletal muscles. This, in turn, decreases the total oxygen consumption and blood flow needs of the muscles, resulting in decrease\u00a0in skeletal muscle blood flow and cardiac output.\n5. Decreased metabolic rate of the tissues. If tissue metabolic rate is reduced, such as occurs in skeletal muscle during prolonged bed rest, the oxygen consumption and nutrition needs of the tissues will also be lower. This decreases blood flow to the tissues, resulting in reduced cardiac output. Other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, may also reduce metabolic rate and therefore tissue blood flow and cardiac output.",

Up to 75% of patients with this disorder can be shown to have a fixed obstruction within 1 cm of the site of aerial spasm. Patients with Prinzmetal's angina are often younger than patients with unstable angina secondary to coronary atherosclerosis. The diagnosis may be confirmed by observing a spontaneous coronary aery spasm (or provoking one by administering ergonovine or acetylcholine, or instructing the patient to hyperventilate) during angiography. Atherosclerosis is the cause of typical angina that occurs with exeion. Embolism in the coronary aeries is somewhat unusual, but can occur if a plaque from the aoa breaks off and lodges in a coronary vessel.

        "question": "About Neuropeptide Y all are true except:",
        "exp": "its level decreases during starvation As mentioned in the previous question, NPY is an Orexigenic i.e. appetite stimulant. Thus its level increases during starvation to increase food intake and reduce energy expenditure (decrease thermogenesis). NPY is a neurohormone released by hypothalamus. The hypothalamus can sense the body's state of starvation or welfed through a peptide hormone released by adipocytes -Leptin. When the amount of adipose tissue increases (signalling excess energy storage), the adipocytes produce increased amounts of leptin. Leptin acts on hypothalamic nuclei initiating multiple actions that decrease body's fat storage. These actions are: (1) inactivation of NPY-AGRP neurons decreasing production of appetite stimulators, such as NPY and AGRP; (2) activation of POMC neurons, causing release of cc-MSH (melanocoicotropin) and activation of inelanocoin receptors; (3) increased production in the hypothalamus of substances, such as coicotropin-releasing hormone, that decrease food intake; (4) increased sympathetic nerve activity (through neural projections from the hypothalamus to the vasomotor centers), which increases metabolic rate and energy expenditure; and (5) decreased insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cells, which decreases energy storage. Thus during starvation, leptin production is decreased causing increased levels of NPY. As mentioned in the previous question, there are 2 types of neurons in the hypothalamic nuclei regulating appetite i.e. 1) NPY-AGRP neurons - which release orixogenic substances NPY and AGRP. 2) POMC (proopiomelanocoin) neurons - which release a-MSH (a-Melanocyte stimulating hormone or melanocoicotropin) and CA (Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript). These are anorexigenic i.e. decrease food intake and increase energy expenditure. Note that some students were of the opinion that one of the option was - `NPY and melanocoicotropin have same effect'. In that case this is a false statement as NPY is orexigenic, increases food intake. Melanocoicotropin or MSH is anorexigenic, decreases food intake. \"NPY is a polypeptide containing 36 amino acid residues\"- Ganong 23/e p145",

It occurs under various circumstances which include excessive Na+ ingestion in absence of corresponding water ingestion, an inability to ingest water due to impairment in thirst mechanisms, unconsciousness or lack of water supply, and insufficient intake of water to keep up with water losses. Near drowning in salt water causes considerable intake of hypeonic salt solution either through swallowing or absorption through pulmonary membranes. Diabetes Insipidus is a result of faulty, or insufficient secretion of ADH (anti diuretic hormone). This leads to increased urinary output of dilute urine with subsequent excess water losses, leading to hyperosmolality of serum. Hyperglycemia, however, tends to decrease serum Na+ concentrations as water shifts from intracellular compaments into intravascular fluids in response to the hyperosmolar state of the serum. Watery diarrhea will produce excess water losses in excess of electrolytes, thus increasing serum Na+ concentration. Ref: Howard C., Berl T. (2009). Chapter 3.

It is synthesized from glycolytic intermediates 3-phosplzoglyceraldehyde by means of Rapopo- leubering shunt.It is highly charged anion that binds to the /3 chains of deoxy hemoglobin. One mole of deoxyhemoglobin binds to one mole of 2, 3 BPG. A single molecule of 2, 3 - BPG binds to a positively charged pocket (cavity) formed by two 13-chains, in the centre of deoxyhemoglobin. Positively charged aminoacids of pocket form ionic bonds with negatively charged phosphate group of 2, 3- BPG.It decreases 02 affinity of hemoglobin by binding to deoxyhemoglobin but not to oxyhemoglobin and stabilizing the taut conformation of deoxy hemoglobin.Oxyhemoglobin + 2, 3 - BPG ____________ Deoxyhemoglobin + 02(HbO2) (Hb - 2, 3 - BPG)In this equilibrium, an increase in the concentration of 2, 3 - BPG shifts the reaction to right causing more oxygen to be released.Hemoglobin from which 2, 3 - BPG is removed has a high affinity for oxygen. However, the presence of 2, 3 - BPG significantly reduces the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to right. This reduced affinity enable hemoglobin to releases oxygen efficiently at the paial pressure found in tissues.Role of 2, 3 - BPG in stored & transfused blood: ?Storing blood in acid- citrate - dextrose leads to a decrease of 2, 3- BPG in RBC. Hemoglobin deficient in 2, 3 - BPG displays an abnormally high 02 affinity & fails to unload its bound 02 in tissues properly and thus acts as an oxygen trap rather than as oxygen transpo system. However, transfused RBCs are able to restore their depleted supplies of 2, 3BPG in 24-48 hours; this may be a serius issue in critically ill patiens. This decrease in 2, 3 - BPG can be prevented by adding inosine (hypoxanthine - ribose) to the storage mediumQ. Uncharged inosine molecule enters RBC, releases its ribose moiety, gets phosphorylated and enters HMP pathway to become 2, 3-BPG. Hypoxanthine is formed during utilization of inosine to maintain or increase 2, 3 - BPG content. Thus while inosine increase/ maintain 2, 3 - BPG content, hypoxanthine does notQ.In chronic hypoxia & anemia the concentration of 2, 3- BPG increases whereas, when pH falls (or is low), 2 3- BPG concentration falls because acidosis inhibits red cell glycolysis.Increasing 2, 3 - BPGChronic hypoxia eg- Obstructive pulmonary emphysema- High altitudes- Cyanotic congenital hea diseaseAnemia eg sickle cell HbAcidosis (1- pH)Exercise (in non athletes)Harmones- Thyroid hormone- Growth hormone- AndrogensPregnancyRejuvenating chemical agentsInosineQDihydroxyacetonePyruvatePhosphatePhosphoenol, pyruvate",

        "question": "Edema is caused by all of the following mechanisms, EXCEPT:",
        "exp": "Edema is increased volume of extracellular extravascular fluid due to interference with the normal flow of fluids between blood, lymphatics, and tissue. The lymphatic circulation takes up a significant poion of fluid from the interstitial tissues, along with extravascular proteins, and returns it to the blood. If the lymphatic circulation is obstructed, the lymphatic drainage is interrupted. Affected areas have large accumulation of fluid and are edematous. The vascular system also aids in maintaining fluid volume. The endothelium is the lining of the vessels and serves as a semipermeable membrane for fluids and components, primarily by keeping proteins intraluminal colloidal pressure and causing fluid leakage and edema. Capillary blood pressure (BP), or hydrostatic pressure, is the force in capillaries that drives fluids from the capillaries into the tissues. By increasing the hydrostatic pressure, fluids tend to be forced out of the capillaries into tissues, causing edema. Sodium and water also aid in maintaining fluid balance. Sodium retention causes water retention, leading to an expansion of the extracellular fluid volume both intravascularly and in the tissues with edema. The protein concentration of plasma also functions in the maintenance of fluid balance. The major protein involved is albumin. By decreasing the plasma protein concentrations, there is a decreased colloid osmotic pressure in the blood, so there is a decreased counterforce to the hydrostatic BP. Thus, there is increased fluid escaping from the capillaries and decreased resorption of fluid from tissues. Fluid tends to accumulate extracellularly, with generalized edema.

        "exp": "Creatine kinase occurs in several different forms, or isoenzymes, in the body. Most tissues contain a mix of creatine kinase isoenzymes, but one species often predominates. The MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase is associated with hea damage; the MM isoenzyme is associated with muscle damage; and the BB isoenzyme is associated with brain damage. Surgery and trauma are commonly implicated as causes of sufficient skeletal muscle trauma to markedly elevated creatine kinase. If isoenzyme studies are done, the CK-MM (skeletal muscle isoenzyme) isoenzyme will be elevated much more markedly than the CK-MB isoenzyme. Bone is not a significant source of CK. Brain can occasionally be a source of creatine kinase (BB isoenzyme), but would not usually be the major source following an automobile accident. Hea damage as in myocardial infarction (unlikely at this age), can elevate creatine kinase, but would not usually be the major source in an automobile accident. If the dilemma arises as to whether an automobile accident was possibly secondary to a myocardial infarction, the ratio of CK-MB to total CK may be helpful in demonstrating a cardiac contribution (CK-MB is characteristic of hea muscle).

They probably come from the bone marrow and enter the nervous system from the circulating blood vessels.Oligodendrogliocytes are involved in myelin formation.Astrocytes, which are found throughout the brain, are of two subtypes. Fibrous astrocytes, which contain many intermediate filaments, are found primarily in white matter. Protoplasmic astrocytes are found in gray matter and have granular cytoplasm. Both types send processes to blood vessels, where they induce capillaries to form the tight junctions that form the blood-brain barrier. They also send processes that envelop synapses and the surface of nerve cells. They have a membrane potential that varies with the external K+ concentration but do not generate propagated potentials. They produce substances that are tropic to neurons, and they help maintain the appropriate concentration of ions and neurotransmitters by taking up K+ and the neurotransmitters glutamate and -aminobutyrate.",

The lack of troponin in smooth muscle prevents Ca2+ activation troponin binding. They do not have the troponin system, and the light chains of smooth muscle myosin molecules differ from those of striated muscle myosin. Myosin in smooth muscle must be phosphorylated for activation of the myosin ATPase. Sustained contraction is by latch bridge mechanism by which myosin cross-bridges remain attached to actin for some time after the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration falls.

        "exp": "The primary function of PTH is to maintain the extracellular fluid (ECF) calcium concentration within a narrow normal range. The hormone acts directly on bone and kidney and indirectly on the intestine through its effects on synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D to increase serum calcium concentrations; in turn, PTH production is closely regulated by the concentration of serum ionized calcium. Any tendency toward hypocalcemia, as might be induced by calcium-deficient diets, is counteracted by an increased secretion of PTH. This in turn (1) increases the rate of dissolution of bone mineral, thereby increasing the flow of calcium from bone into blood; (2) reduces the renal clearance of calcium, returning more of the calcium filtered at the glomerulus into ECF; and (3) increases the efficiency of calcium absorption in the intestine by stimulating the production of 1,25(OH)2D.

Signs of neuromuscular hyperexcitability appear, followed by full-blown hypocalcemic tetany.In humans, tetany is most often due to inadveent parathyroidectomy during thyroid surgery. Symptoms usually develop 2-3 days postoperatively but may not appear for several weeks or more. Injections of PTH correct the chemical abnormalities, and the symptoms disappear. Injections of Ca2+ salts give temporary relief.The signs of tetany in humans include Chvostek's sign, a quick contraction of the ipsilateral facial muscles elicited by tapping over the facial nerve at the angle of the jaw; and Trousseau's sign, a spasm of the muscles of the upper extremity that causes flexion of the wrist and thumb with extension of the fingers",

Conversely, excessive deflation of lungs cause reflex inhibition of expiration - this is Hering- Breuer deflation reflex.- Physiological role of J (juxta-capilary/alveolar) reflex is unceain but it occurs in pathological states such as pulmonary congestion, pulmonary edemaQ and embolism when the J recptors are stimulated by large lung hyper inflation, or intravascular chemicals like capsaicin, bradykinin & serotonin etc.- Slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors are stimulated by lung inflation (not hyper inflation) - Ganong p 632 table 37.2. Hyper inflation (over stretching) of lungs stimulate stretch receptors and lead to Hering - Breuer inflation reflex. However, more recent work indicates HB reflex may be impoant in new born babies but are largely inactive in adult human unless the tidal volume exceeds 1 liter (John west) /1.5 liter (Guyton), as in exercise. So we can extract inference that, although stretch receptors get stimulated by (normal-quiet) inflation, the HBI reflex occurs only after lung hyper inflation.Nonchemical Responses Mediated by Pulmonary Receptors and ReflexesReceptor TypeLocationImpulse travel in(i.e. Vagalinnervation)StimulusResponse/ ReflexSlowly adaptingAirwayMyelinated vagalLung inflationQ- Inspiratory timeStretch Receptorsmoothfibers shoening(pulmonary orbronchial stretchreceptors)muscle (?) - Hering-Breuerinflation & deflationreflexesQ - Bronchodilation - Hyperpnea - TachycardiaRapidly adaptingAirwayMyelinated vagal- Lung- Increased airwayIrritant Receptorsepithelial cellsfibersHyperinflationQresistance i.e. broncho(type of - Exogenous &constriction (egstretch/mechano- endogenousasthama)receptor) substances eghistamine andprostaglandins- Mucus secretion- Cough_ Hering-Breuerdeflation reflexJ (Juxta-In pulmonaryUnmyelinated- Lung Hyper- Apnea (d/t intensecapillary/alveolar)interstitial(pulmonaryinflationQ (large)stimulation) f/b rapid,Receptorsspace close tovagal)- Exogenous &shallow breathing(Juxta pulmonarybloodC fibersendogenous(tachypnea) andcapillary receptorcapillaries of agents egdyspneaor pulmonary Cfiber receptor)- Pulmonarycirculation- Bronchialcirculation capsaicin,bradykinin,serotonin,histamine,prostaglandins,phenyl diguanide-Pulmonary edema, embolism- Broncho constriction- Mucus secretion- Brady cardia-Hypotension(-pulmonarychemoreflex) & congestionQ * Bronchial C fiber receptors located in the airways and innervated by nonmyelinated fibers are activated bychemicals (notably bradykinin)injected into bronchial aery.

The \" a \" wave corresponds to right Atrial contraction and ends synchronously with the carotid aery pulse. The peak of the 'a' wave demarcates the end of atrial systole. 2. The \" c \" wave corresponds to right ventricular Contraction causing the triCuspid valve to bulge towards the right atrium. 3. The \" x \" descent follows the 'a' wave and corresponds to atrial relaXation and rapid atrial filling due to low pressure. 4. The \" x' \" (x prime) descent follows the 'c' wave and occurs as a result of the right ventricle pulling the tricuspid valve downward during ventricular systole. The x' (x prime) descent can be used as a measure of right ventricle contractility. 5. The \" v \" wave corresponds to Venous filling when the tricuspid valve is closed and venous pressure increases from venous return - this occurs during and following the carotid pulse. 6. The \" y \" descent corresponds to the rapid emptYing of the atrium into the ventricle following the opening of the tricuspid valve. ABNORMAL JVP: 1.

They are synthesized mainly in the liver. The growth promoting action of somatomedins is helped by their insulin like actions. GH, through somatomedin (IGF-1), stimulates proliferation of chondrocytes and osteocytes resulting in increased deposition of chondroitin sulfate in catilage and increased ossification of the newly formed cailage.GH deficiency in early life causes dwarfism (small height). GH excess in early life leads to gigantism, whereas growth hormone excess in adulthood results in acromegaly.2) Regulation of metabolismProtein metabolism : - GH has predominantly anabolic effects on skeletal and cardiac muscle where it promotes amino acid transpo into cells and increase protein synthesis.Carbohydrate and fat metabolism : - The effects of GH on carbohydrate and fat metabolism are complicated by the fact that GH has anti-insulin effects, whereas somatomedins it produces have insulin like effects:-i) Anti-insulin effects due to direct effect of GH include decreased peripheral utilization of glucose, increased gluconeogenesis, hyperglycemia, and lipolysis. Due to its anti-insulin effects GH excess can cause insulin resistant diabetes mellitus.ii) Insulin like effects due to somatomedins (IGF) include antilipolytic activity, and other insulin like effects.",

It has a characteristic sigmoid shape due to the T-R interconversion. In deoxyhemoglobin, globin units are tightly bound in a tense (T) configuration which reduces the affinity of the molecule for oxygen. When the first oxygen is bound, the bonds holding the globin units are released, producing a relaxed (R) configuration which exposes more oxygen binding sites. Thus, binding of one oxygen molecule increases the affinity of hemoglobin to bind other O2 molecules. Ascent to high altitude triggers a substantial rise in 2,3 DPG concentration in red blood cells. Factors causing shift of the curve to right includes: Fall in pH Rise in temperature Increase in 2, 3 BPG pH of the blood falls as its CO2 content increases, so that when PCO2 rises the curve shifts to right.

Each connexone is made of six identical protein subunits called connexins which enclose a central channel. When the corresponding connexons of adjacent cell link up end-to-end, they form a continuous channel that permits substances to pass through from cell to cell. At gap junctions, the intercellular space narrows down to 3nm, thereby helping in binding the cells together. o However, their real physiological significance lies in allowing ions to flow through them, i.e. they conduct ionic current. This enables electrical excitation to spread from cell to cell, as in smooth and cardiac muscles. The pore size of gap junctions decreases when intracellular Ca' is high or pH is low, both of which are commonly associated with cell damage. Closure of gap junctions in response to these stimuli isolates damaged cells so that the Ca+2 and 1-1+ do not spread from the damaged to normal cells.",

B: Residual volume keeps alveoli inflated between breaths The amount of air that moves into the lungs with each inspiration (or the amount that moves out with each expiration) is called the tidal volume (500 ml). The air inspired with a maximal inspiratory effo in excess of the tidal volume is the inspiratory reserve volume. (3000 ml) The volume expelled by an active expiratory effo after passive expiration is the expiratory reserve volume (1200 ml), and the air left in the lungs after a maximal expiratory effo is the residual volume (1200 ml). The space in the conducting zone of the airways occupied by gas that does not exchange with blood in the pulmonary vessels is the respiratory dead space. The vital capacity (4700 ml), the largest amount of air that can be expired after a maximal inspiratory effo, is frequently measured clinically as an index of pulmonary function. It gives useful information about the strength of the respiratory muscles and other aspects of pulmonary function (ERV+TV+IRV) The fraction of the vital capacity expired during the first second of a forced expiration (FEV1, timed vital capacity) gives additional information; the vital capacity may be normal but the FEV1 reduced in diseases such as asthma, in which airway resistance is increased because of bronchial constriction. The amount of air inspired per minute (pulmonary ventilation, respiratory minute volume) is normally about 6 L (500 mL/ breath x 12 breaths/ min). The maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), or, as it was formerly called, the maximal breathing capacity, is the largest volume of gas that can be moved into and out of the lungs in 1 minute by voluntary effo. The normal MVV is 125-170 L/ min. Inspiratory Capacity (TV + IRV) = 3500 ml Functional Residual Capacity (RV + ERV) = 2400 ml Total Lung capacity (RV + VC) = 5900 ml",

Also know: The light I band is divided by the dark Z line, and the dark A band has the lighter H band in its center. A transverse M line is seen in the middle of the H band, and this line plus the narrow light areas on either side of it are sometimes called the pseudo-H zone.

Tissues that do not depend on insulin for glucose uptake include brain, erythrocytes (RBC), the epithelial cells of kidney & intestine, Liver, and Cornea & lens of eye.The mechanism through which insulin increases glucose uptake is different in different tissues. In the muscle and adipose tissues, insulin increase facilitated diffusion by increasing glucose transpoer (GLUT4) on the cell membrane.In the liver, insulin stimulates glucose entry into hepatocytes indirectly by induction of glucokinase so that the glucose entering the liver cells is promptly conveed to glucose - 6 - phosphate (glucose trapping). This keeps the intracellular glucose concentration low and ours entry of glucose into the liver. Thus, though the liver do not depend on insulin for glucose uptake, insulin stimulates glucose entry into hepatocytes. That means glucose entery can occur in liver without the action of insulin, but this is facilitated by insulin. On the other hand, myocytes (skeletal and cardiac muslces) and adipocytes (adipose tissue) are dependent on insulin for glucose uptake.",

The primary stimulus for the central chemoreceptors is an increase in the hydrogen ion concentration. Stimulation of central chemoreceptors by increased hydrogen ion concentration leads to excitation of the respiratory neurons, thereby producing an increase in the rate and depth of respiration.Although the primary stimulus for central chemoreceptors is an increase in hydrogen ion concentration, in actual practice the physiological stimulus is an increase in PCO2. The reason is that hydrogen ions cannot cross blood - brain barrier. Therefore, a change in the blood hydrogen ion concentration does not change the hydrogen ion concentration in the immediate vicinity of the chemosensitive neurons (i.e., in CSF and brain interstitial fluid). On the other hand, CO2 being lipid soluble can easily cross blood brain barrier. It enters the brain, where it is hydrated to give rise to fr and HCO2- ions. Now these H' directly stimulate the central chemoreceptors.Thus, central chemoreceptors are directly stimulated by an increase in H+ concentration in CSF and brain inerstitial tissue, which is brought about by change in aerial PCO2 (PaCO2).",

        "question": "Hypoxiema independent of",
        "exp": "Hb [Ref: Ganong 23/e p617; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxemiaj Hypoxemia is decreased paial pressure of oxygen in blood. It is the oxygen that is dissolved in the blood not attached with hemoglobin; thus it does not depend on Hemoglobin. Hypoxemia is one of the types of Hypoxia kla Hypoxic Hypoxia. The Hypoxia dependent on hemoglobin is anemic Hypoxia. Hypoxia is defined as 0, deficiency at the tissue level. Hypoxia has been divided into four types. (1) Hypoxic hypoxia, in which the P02 of the aerial blood is reduced; (2) Anemic hypoxia, in which the aerial P02 is normal but the amount of hemoglobin available to carry 02 is reduced; (3) Stagnant or Ischemic hypoxia, in which the blood .flow to a tissue is so low that adequate 02 is not delivered to it despite a normal P02 and hemoglobin concentration; and (4) Histotoxic hypoxia, in which the amount of 02 delivered to a tissue is adequate but, because of the action of a toxic agent, the tissue cells cannot make use of the 02 supplied to them. Hypoxic Hypoxia (Hypoxemia) Hypoxic Hypoxia is the most common form of hypoxia seen clinically. Causes: 1.Low inspired paial pressure of oxygen (low Pi02) 2. Alveolar hypoventilation 3.Impairment of diffusion across blood-gas membrane 4.Ventilation-perfusion inequality 5. Shunt In contrast, primary hemoglobin deficiency, e.g. anemia is not a cause, since it doesn't decrease the paial pressure of oxygen in blood. Low inspired oxygen paial pressure (low PiO2) If the paial pressure of oxygen in the inspired gas is low, then a reduced amount of oxygen is delivered to the alveoli of the lung. The reduced oxygen paial pressure can be a result of reduced fractional oxygen content (low Fi02) or simply a result of low barometric pressure, as can occur at high altitudes. This reduced Pi02 can result in hypoxemia even if the lungs are normal. Alveolar hypoventilation If the alverolar ventilation is low, there may be insufficient oxygen delivered to the alveoli each minute. (e.g., airway obstruction, depression of the brain's respiratory center, or muscular weakness). Impaired diffusion Impaired diffusion across the blood-gas membrane in the lung can cause hypoxemia, e.g. pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis Shunt Shunting of blood from the right side to the left side of the circulation (right-to-left shunt) is a powerful cause of hypoxemia. The shunt may be intracardiac (tong. cyanotic hea disease) or may be intrapulmonary.(Note that Left-toright shunting does not cause hypoxemia.) Ventilation-perfusion inequality Ventilation-perfusion inequality (or ventilation-perfusion mismatch) is a common cause of hypoxemia in people with lung disease. It is the areas of the lung with ventilation/perfusion ratios that are less than one (but not zero) that cause hypoxemia by this mechanism. A ventilation/perfusion ratio of zero is considered a shunt. (Not sure how PCO\\\\ is linked with hypoxemia or PaO2 ; possibl! hypoxemia causes lryperventilation which leads todecreased alveolar and aeial PCO2)",

A rise in temperature or a fall in pH shifts the curve to the right. When the curve is shifted in this direction, a higher PO2 is required for hemoglobin to bind a given amount of O2. Conversely, a fall in temperature or a rise in pH shifts the curve to the left, and a lower PO2 is required to bind a given amount of O2. A convenient index for comparison of such shifts is the P50, the PO2 at which hemoglobin is half saturated with O2. The higher the P50, the lower the affinity of hemoglobin for O2.

It is caused by the formation of circulating antibodies to the muscle type of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These antibodies destroy some of the receptors and bind others to neighboring receptors, triggering their removal by endocytosis. The reason for the development of autoimmunity to acetylcholine receptors in this disease is still unknown. Another condition that resembles myasthenia gravis is Lambe-Eaton syndrome. In this condition, muscle weakness is caused by antibodies against one of the Ca2+ channels in the nerve endings at the neuromuscular junction. This decreases the normal Ca2+ influx that causes acetylcholine release. However, muscle strength increases with prolonged contractions as more Ca2+ is released.",

        "exp": "Pepsin production is a normal physiologic activity of the stomach that, in conditions of stress, may overwhelm the stomach's weakened defenses and result in gastric ulceration. Gastric acid production is another condition that may increase and cause acute ulceration. Fuhermore, these two factors may remain unchanged and still result in gastric ulcers if the gastric defenses are weakened by stress. All of the other choices represent normal defensive forces in the stomach. Increased bicarbonate transpo would protect the gastric epithelium from the potentially harmful acidity of the gastric contents. The adherent mucus is relatively alkaline, providing local protection to the superficial mucosa. Gastric epithelial cells can normally replicate rapidly, allowing mucosal defects to be rapidly repaired. Increasing the regenerative capacity of the epithelium would have a protective effect against ulceration. The gastric mucosa is richly supplied with blood, providing the epithelial cells with an ample supply of nutrients, oxygen, and bicarbonate to contend with the harsh gastric microenvironment. Stress ulcers are associated with compromised gastric blood flow, not increased flow. Ref: Mills J.C., Stappenbeck T.S., Bunnett N. (2010). Chapter 13. Gastrointestinal Disease. In S.J. McPhee, G.D.

The average normal red blood cell count is 5.4 million/L in men and 4.8 million/L in women. The number of red cells is also conveniently expressed as the hematocrit, or the percentage of the blood, by volume, that is occupied by erythrocytes. Each human red blood cell is about 7.5 m in diameter and 2 m thick, and each contains approximately 29 pg of hemoglobin. There are thus about 3 x 10 13 red blood cells and about 900 g of hemoglobin in the circulating blood of an adult man. Ref: Barrett K.E., Barman S.M., Boitano S., Brooks H.L. (2012). Chapter 31.

Additional control of the plasma concentration of HCO3- is provided by the kidneys.

H2CO3 proceeds slowly in either direction unless the enzyme carbonic anhydrase is present. There is no carbonic anhydrase in plasma, but there is an abundant supply in red blood cells, spatially confining and controlling the reaction. The presence of hemoglobin in the blood increases the buffering of the system by binding free H+ produced by the hydration of CO2 and allowing for movement of the HCO3- into the plasma.

His temperature is 36.9 C (98.5 F), his blood pressure is 158/98 mm Hg and his pulse is 82/minute and regular. On examination, the physician notes a non tender, pulsatile, mass in the mid-abdomen. A plain abdominal x-ray film with the patient in the lateral position reveals spotty calcification of a markedly dilated abdominal aoic walI. Which of the following physiologic observations helps to account for the fact that 75% of the aneurysms of this patient's type are found in the abdomen and only 25% principally involve the thorax?",
        "exp": "Increased blood pressure is a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis, and humans pay a price for their erect sitting and standing postures. In these postures, the abdominal aoa experiences the weight of a column of blood added to the pressure produced by the hea. In the supine posture, the pressures in the thoracic and abdominal aoa are similar. So, if an average daily pressure is taken, the abdominal aoa tends to have a significantly higher pressure than does the thoracic aoa. Diastolic pressure is actually greater in the thoracic aoa compared to the abdominal aoa in the supine position. However, the systolic blood pressure is greater in the abdominal aoa. A negative intrathoracic pressure would tend to increase transmural pressure across the wall of the thoracic aoa, and thereby increase wall tension and promote the development of aneurysms. Blood flow in the abdominal aoa is less than that in the thoracic aoa, because some blood leaves the aoa through its thoracic branches. Ref: Creager M.A., Loscalzo J. (2012). Chapter 248.

Carbon monoxide has a very high affinity for hemoglobin, and binds, nearly irreversibly, to it in such a manner that oxygen cannot bind, drastically decreasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Carbon monoxide also causes the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to shift to the left, making oxygen more difficult to unload.

        "question": "A patient undergoes a total gastrectomy because of a proximally located gastric cancer. After the surgery, which of the following digestive enzymes will be produced in inadequate amounts?",
        "exp": "Pepsin is secreted (in an inactive or zymogen form as pepsinogen) by the chief cells of the stomach. Pepsinogen is activated by contact with stomach acid. Although protein digestion usually begins with the actions of hydrochloric acid and pepsin, pancreatic enzymes complete the job as the food passes into the small intestine. Amylases hydrolyze 1->4 glycosidic linkages of starches to produce oligosaccharides, maltose, maltotriose, and limit dextrins. These enzymes are produced by the pancreas and salivary glands. Chymotrypsin is a proteolytic enzyme released by the pancreas as the inactive proenzyme, chymotrypsinogen. Lipases are mostly released by the pancreas, and serve to digest various lipids, including triacylglycerols. Ref: Barrett K.E., Barman S.M., Boitano S., Brooks H.L. (2012). Chapter 25.

They continue their maturation and acquire their mobility during their passage through epididymis. From epididymis they come to vas deference, distal end of which also receives the secretions of seminal vesicle, and continues as the ejeculatory duct. The ejeculatory duct joins the prostatic urethra. Once ejeculated into the the female, vaginal secretions improve the motility and feilizing ability of sperms. Fuher exposure to secretions of female genital tract (in uterus and/or fallopian tube) fuher improves the mobility and feilizing ability of the sperms. The beneficial effects of stay in the female genital tract are collectively called capacitation, from the isthmus, capacitated sperms move rapidly to the ampullas, where feilization takes place.",
