        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Renal plasma flow * Imagine a substance that not only passes freely across the glomerular membrane but is also secreted by the tubules to such an extent that the plasma leaving the kidney does not contain that substance any more. In that case the entire plasma flowing through the kidney would be cleared of the subsance. Or, in other words, the clearance of the substance would give us the renal plasma flow (RPF). A substance which closely satisfies this description is para-aminohipporic acid (PAH). Therefore, PAH is used t o measure renal plasma flow.* The PAH clearance in a normal adult is about 625 ml/minute. This is a measure of effective renal plasma flow (ERPF). PAH is only 90% excreted in the urine in a single passage through the kidney, i. e., its extraction ratio is 0. 9 (90%). Therefore, PAH understimates RPF by about 10% because it does not measure the plasma flowing through those portions of the kidney which do not secrete PAH, the renal medulla, perirenal fat, renal capsule, pelvis and calyces. Thus actual RPF is 10% more than ERPF i. e., 690 ml/min. Knowing RPF and hematocrit (RBCs), renal blood flow can be calculated.* In simple words, clearance of PAH is a measure of effective renal plasma flow and actual renal plasma flow is 10% more than the PAH renal clearance (or ERPF).",

        "question": "Hyperosmolarity of renal medulla is due to-",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b > a & d' i. e., Na > K & Cl o A countercurrent system is a system in which inflow runs parallel to, counter to, and in close proximity to the outflow for some distance. In the kidney there are two countercurrent mechanisms: - i) Countercurrent multiplier at the loop of Henle which generate high medullary osmotic pressure gradient; and ii) Countercurrent exchanger at vasa recta of medullary capillaires, which helps to maintain the medullary osmotic pressure gradient. Countercurrent multipliero The loop of Henle gives the nephron a peculiar shape. The descending limb, in which the tubular fluid flows towards the hairpin bend (downwords) and the ascending limb, in which the tubular fluid flows 'upwards' lie close to each other. Two such tubes with fluid flowing through them in opposite directions provide an opportunity for the countercurrent multiplication. o The thick ascending limb of loop of Henle is impermeable to water but it actively reabsorbs Na. Cl. The thin descending limb of loop of Henle is relatively impermeable to solutes but highly permeable to water. The most important cause of the high medullary osmolarity is active transport of sodium0 and co-transport of potassium, chloride and other ions out of the thick ascending limb of loop of Henle0 into the medullary interstitium. Most important among all these is Na. Cl0, for maintenance of high medullary interstitium. o Consider the Na* is continuously flowing in from glomerulus into the tubule. However, most of the Na+, instead of flowing out, gets trapped in a circular path and recycles between the ascending and descending limbs of the loop of Henle. Consequently, the Na* concentration becomes very high at the tip of the loop. Role of ureao Urea also contributes to the osmalority of medullary interstitium0, especially when the kidney is forming maximally concentrated urine. The medullary region ofthe collecting duct is permeable to urea. Diffusion ofurea from these ducts into the medulla increases the osmolarity of medullary' interstitium. Under the influence of ADH, the permeability of medullary collecting ducts to urea further increases. Moreover. ADH makes these collecting ducts also permeable to water and outward diffusion of wrater. That increases the urea concentration within the duct. That leads to further diffusion of more urea out of duct along concentration gradient. Thus urea makes an important contribution to the genesis of high osmolarity in the renal medulla. Countercurrent exchangero If the blood flowrs through the hyperosmolar medulla as shown in figure A below', it would equilibrate with medullary interstitium and carry away the solutes concentrated in the medulla. However, what actually happens is shown in figure 'BT below. Vasa recta is U shaped (as is the loop of Henle). As the vasa recta dips into the hyperosmolar medulla, the blood equilibrates with the surrounding interstitium and becomes hyperosmolar. Thereafter, as the vasa recta loops around and ascends towards the cortex, the osmolarity of the blood keeps decreasing as it equilibrates with the surrounding interstitium. By the time vasa recta leaves the medulla, the blood in it has the same osmolarity as when it entered the medulla. In other words, the solutes concentrated in the medulla are not wrashed away by the blood flowing through the medulla, o Since the blood flowing through the medulla equilibrates completely with the medullary' inerstitium, the amount of solutes carried away by the blood is flow limited. Hence, the slow rate of blood flow through the vasa recta contributes to the conservation of medullary hyperosmolarity. Conversely, a high blood flow rate through the medulla reduces the medullary hyperosmolarity'.",

In normal resting man the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) averages 125cc/min. The ultrafiltrate is derived from an average total renal plasma flow (RPF) of 600 cc/min. The ratio of glomerular ultrafiltrate to renal plasma flow is referred to as the filtration fraction (FF): FF=GFR/RPFWhere, the FF represents the fraction of plasma which is filtered across the glomerular capillary bed. Alterations in the FF can have an important effect on proximal tubular reabsorption of fluid. The glomerular filtration rate is several fold that of fluid movement in capillary beds of other tissues, principally because the surface area available for diffusion plus the permeability of the glomerular capillary membrane (Kf) is approximately 100 fold that of other capillary beds. Physical Determinants of Glomerular Filtration. The net filtration across a capillary bed (including the glomerular capillary membrane wall is governed by the algebraic sum of hydrostatic and oncotic pressure across the capillary wall. Schematic depiction of the physical determinants responsible for the formation of an ultra filtrate of plasma in Bowman's space. The principal driving force for the formation of the glomerular ultrafiltrate is the hydraulic pressure within the glomerular capillary (Pgc)- In contrast, the principle forces opposing filtration include the oncotic pressure ( 1/4 GC) within the glomerular capillary and hydrostatic pressure in Bowmans space (PBS). Net ultrafiltration is further modulated by the hydraulic permeability and surface area of the glomerular capillary (Kf). The glomerular filtration rate can be derived using the following mathematical relationship. GFR = Kf x (PGC-PBS)-(p. GC-7p. Bs)= Kf x (AP-Att)= Kf x Pufwhere; Kf is the membrane porosity * surface area; PGC is the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillary network; PBS is the Bowman's space pressure; p. GC is the glomerular capillary oncotic pressure; tc. BS is the Bowman's space oncotic pressure; AP is the transcapillary hydrostatic pressure (PGC - PBS); Arc is the transcapillary oncotic pressure (rc. GC - rc. BS) and. PUF is the net ultrafiltration pressure. Since the glomerular ultrafiltrate is typically protein free, pi BS is equal to zero, and, thus, the oncotic pressure in. Bowman's space is usually excluded from the above analysis. Therefore, the major direct determinants of GFR include.* PGC* PBS* Kf* rc. GCIn addition to the above direct determinants of GFR, RPF also indirectly modulates GFR. PGC - In general, increases in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure will increase GFR while decreases result in the opposite effect. p- In general, increases in Kf will tend to increase GFR while decreases will tend to decrease GFR. PBS- Normally Bowman's space pressure remains constant because of unimpeded flow of glomerular filtrate. An obstruction to urinary out flow distal to Bowman's space will result in a fall in delta P (and hence GFR) incident to a rise in Bowman's space pressure. p. GC- The glomerular capillary oncotic pressure is the principle factor opposing glomerular filtration. The pressure in the glomerular capillaries is higher than that in other capillary beds because the afferent arterioles are short, straight branches of the interlobular arteries. Further more the vessels \"downstream\" from the glomeruli, the efferent arterioles have a relatively high resistance. The capillary hydrostatic pressure is opposed hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's capsule. It is also opposed by the oncotic pressure gradient across the glomerular capillary (p. GC - pT) is normally negligible and the gradient is essentially equal to the oncotic pressure of the plasma proteins. Hormones or autocoids.

        "exp": "Ans: C. Reduce by 1/16. Option c is correct because the flow of fluids can be described by Poiseuille's Law. In which flow of liquid is directly proportional to R4, So if lumen is reduced to half then blood flow will get reduce by 1/16. Other points related to blood flow... Poiseuille's Law states that the flow (Q) of fluid is related to a number of factors: The viscosity (n) of the fluid. The pressure gradient across the vessel (P). Length (L) and diameter(r) of the vessel. Diameter: Doubling the diameter of tube increases the flow rate by 16 fold (r4). The larger the vessels's diameter greater is the blood flow. Viscosity: Flow is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the fluid. Viscosity of blood increases with increasing hematocrit and decreasing temperature. Pressure: Increasing pressure further maximizes flow as described by Poiseuille's equation. The relationship is given by Poiseuille-Hagen formula: F=(PA -PB )x(8p )x(e1 )x(Lr4 ). WhereF = Flow. PA - PB = Pressure difference between two ends of the tube q = Viscosity r = Radius of tube L = Length of tube. Relationship between arterial blood pressure and blood flow given in graph below:",

        "question": "In high potassium serum levels, kidney compensation occurs by-",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Increased secretion in DCT Potassium transport* Potassium is one of the few substances that are both reabsorbed as well as secreted by the renal tubules.* The reabsorption of about two-third of the filtered K+ occurs in the proximal tubules and about 15-20% of reabsorption occur in the thick ascending limb of loop of Henle. This absorption is independent of the K+ status of the body. After this, about 10% of filtered K+ is reached the DCT and CD, here K+ reabsorption as well as secretion takes place. Here also, reabsorption of K+ occurs independent of K+ status of the body. It is the secretory process that is regulated by aldosterone in response to the K+ and Na+ status of body.* Potassium is secreted by principal cells. Na+K+ ATPase transports Na+ out of the cell and transports K+ inside the cells across the basolateral membrane. This results in decreased intracellular Na+ with increased K+. As a result Na+ is reabsorbed along concentration gradient from tubular lumen. This increases negativity on the luminal surface of epithelial cells, i. e., increased transepithelial potential difference (TEPD). Both of these factors (increased intracellular K+ and negative TEPD) stimulate secretion of K+ into the tubular lumen to decrease negativity of luminal surface (K+ has positive charge).* Intercalated (I) cells reabsorb K+ in exchange with H+ by apical H+K+ ATPase (hydrogen potassium ATPase), i. e., K+ is reabsorbed and H+ is secreted. Under normal conditions this is not important. This transport becomes prominent in circumstances associated with severe potassium depletion when there is cessation of potassium secretion and net reabsorption of potassium.* The normal day-to-day variation of potassium excretion, however, is regulated mainly by secretion in the distal and collecting tubules rather than by changes in glomerular filtration or tubular reabsorption. Potassium is sometimes reabsorbed in these tubular segments (e. g., during potassium depletion), and at other times it is secreted in large amounts depending on the needs of the body. With high potassium intake, the required extra excretion of potassium is achieved almost entirely by increased secretion of potassium in the distal and collecting tubules.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., GFR * If there be a substance that passes freely across the glomerular membane but is neither reabsorbed nor secreted by tubular activity, urinary excretion would represent the amount filtered and nothing but the amount filtered. Hence, its clearance would indicate how much plasma gets filtered every minute.* One such substance is Inulin, a polysaccharide of small enough (molecular weight about 5, 200) to get filtered as easily as crystalloids or water. It is neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the kidney. Further, it is neither metabolized nor synthesized by the kidneys, is non-toxic and can be easily measured. All these features make it a very suitable substance for estimation of glomerular filtration rate. Inulin clearance is equal to the GFR, i. e., 126 ml/min.* Beside inulin, the clearance of vitamin B12, EDTA, and polyfructosan are also quite reliable as indicators of GFR Creatinine is not as accurate as the above substances because it is secreted in small amounts. But since it is a product of metabolism and its level is fairly constant, creatinine is very convenient to determine its clearance. That is why, clinically, creatinine clearance is used an index of GFR quite frequently. Remember* Inulin is more accurate measure of GFR, but is inconvenient because it has to be injected intravascular.* Creatinine is not as accurate as inulin, But creatinine is already present in the blood in steady-state, so the endogenous creatinine clearance can be used without the necessity of having to infuse inulin.",

        "exp": "Ans. c (20 ml/min) (Ref. Ganong physiology, 21st ed., 806)MEASURING GFR# The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can be measured in intact experimental animals and humans by measuring the excretion and plasma level of a substance that is freely filtered through the glomeruli and neither secreted nor reabsorbed by the tubules.# The amount of such a substance in the urine per unit of time must have been provided by filtering exactly the number of milliliters of plasma that contained this amount.# Therefore, if the substance is designated by the letter X, the GFR is equal to the concentration of X in urine (UX) times the urine flow per unit of time (V.) divided by the arterial plasma level of X (PX), or UXV/PX. This value is called the clearance of X (CX). In our MCQ, the clearance will be Cx=100 x 2/ 10 = 20 ml/min.# PX is, of course, the same in all parts of the arterial circulation, and if X is not metabolized to any extent in the tissues, the level of X in peripheral venous plasma can be substituted for the arterial plasma level. SUBSTANCES USED TO MEASURE GFR# In addition to the requirement that it be freely filtered and neither reabsorbed nor secreted in the tubules, a substance suitable for measuring the GFR should be nontoxic and not metabolized by the body.# Inulin, a polymer of fructose with a molecular weight of 5200 that is found in dahlia tubers, meets these criteria in humans and most animals and is extensively used to measure GFR. UIN = 35 mg/m. LV = 0. 9 mL/min. PIN = 0. 25 mg/m. LCIN = UINV----PIN=35 x 0. 9------0. 25. CIN = 126 mL/min# Endogenous creatinine clearance is easy to measure and is a worthwhile index of renal function.# Normal GFR- The GFR in an average-sized normal man is approximately 125 mL/min.- Its magnitude correlates fairly well with surface area, but values in women are 10% lower than those in men even after correction for surface area.- A rate of 125 mL/min is 7. 5 L/h, or 180 L/d, whereas the normal urine volume is about 1 L/d. Thus, 99% or more of the filtrate is normally reabsorbed.- At the rate of 125 mL/min, the kidneys filter in 1 day an amount of fluid equal to 4 times the total body water, 15 times the ECF volume, and 60 times the plasma volume.# Control of GFR- The factors governing filtration across the glomerular capillaries are the same as those governing filtration across all other capillaries, i. e., # The size of the capillary bed, # The permeability of the capillaries, and# The hydrostatic and osmotic pressure gradients across the capillary wall.# For each nephron:- GFR = Kf [(PGC-PT)-(n. GC-nT)# Kf, the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient, is the product of the glomerular capillary wall hydraulic conductivity (ie, its permeability) and the effective filtration surface area.# PGC is the mean hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, # PT the mean hydrostatic pressure in the tubule, # p.
