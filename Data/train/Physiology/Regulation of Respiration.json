Stretching of the lungs during inspiration initiates impulses in afferent pulmonary vagal discharges. These impulses inhibit inspiratory discharge. Hence after Vagotomy the impulses inhibiting inspiratory discharge are absent and this will result in increase of depth of respiration. Manifestation after Pneumotaxic center is damaged. Pneumotaxic center is dorsal pons which contains neurons active in active inspiration and expiration. When this area is damaged respiration will become slower and tidal volume greater. Manifestation after both vagi are cut after damage to Pneumotaxic center. If vagi are cut after damage to pneumotaxic centre, apneusis (Prolonged inspiratory spasms that resemble breath holding) will develop",

They are stimulated especially when the pulmonary capillaries become engorged with blood or when pulmonary edema occurs in such conditions as congestive heart failure. Although the functional role of the J receptors is not clear, their excitation may give the person a feeling of dyspnea. \"Ventilation is controlled by group of neurons located in medulla and pons (described in detail in q. no. 18 Nov 2009). This rhythmic neural control is regulated by alterations in arterial PO2, PCO2 and PT ions concentration. These chemical controls are supplemented by a number of non-chemical influences (like Stretch receptors). The ultimate goal of respiration is to maintain proper concentration of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen ions in the tissues. Stretch receptors: The stretch receptors are located in the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles throughout the lungs. They transmit signals through the vagi into the dorsal respiratory group of neurons when the lungs become overstretched, when the lungs become overly inflated, the stretch receptors activate an appropriate feedback response that \"switches off\" the inspiratory ramp and thus stops further inspiration. This is called the Hering-Breuer inflation reflex. (Note that Ganong writes that J receptors are also stimulated by hyperinflation of the lung)",

        "question": "Pacemaker regulating the rate of respiration -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Pre-Botzinger Complex \"The main components of the respiratory control pattern generator responsible for automatic respiration are located in the medulla. Rhythmic respiration is initiated by a small group of synaptically coupled pacemaker cells in the pre-Botzinger complex on either side of the medulla between the nucleus ambiguus and the lateral reticular nucleus -- Ganong. Medullary respiratory centerso The principal areas in the medulla oblongata concerned with regulation of respiration are: -Dorsal respiratory group (DRG): - The dorsal respiratory group of neurons are mainly concerned with inspiration. They descend and terminate on spinal motor neurons innervating the primary muscles of inspiration, i. e., the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles. Ventral respiratory group (VRG): - The ventral respiratory group of neurons is mainly concerned with forceful expiration but also shows some activity during inspiration. Therefore, these neurons contribute to both expiration and inspiration. These neurons are divided into: -The rostral VRG neurons: - These neurons show activity primarily synchronous with inspiration and therefore be called inspiratory (I) neurons. They terminate on spinal motor neurons supplying the accessory muscles of inspiration, i. e., sternocleidomastoid, scalenes and anterior serrati. The ventral VRG neurons: - These are mostly expiratory (E) neurons. But since the expiration is generally a passive process, E neurons are silent most of the time. However, these neurons show activity when expiration is forceful, as during exercise. These neurons terminate on spinal motor neurons supply the muscles of expiration, i. e., internal intercostal and abdominal muscles. Pre-Botzinger complex: - These neurons are responsible for generation of respiratory rhythm, i. e., the pacemaker cells which regulate the rate of respiration are located in Pre-Botzinger complex. Pontine respiratory centerso The important pontine areas concerned with respiration are: -Pneumotoxic center (nucleus parabrachialis ntedialis): - It is located in upper part ofpons and transmits signals to the inspiratory' area. The function of the pneumotaxic center is primarily to limit inspiration, i. e., the primary effect of this center is to control the \"switch-ofip point of the inspiratory ramp thus controlling the depth of inspiration, i. e., the duration of the filling phase of the lung cycle. Pneumotaxic center also inhibits apneustic center further inhibiting inspiration. Therefore strong stimulation of this center results in an early termination of inspiratory ramp and hence, inspiration is shortened and the tidal volume decreases. Conversely, in the absence of inputs from this center, inspiratory ramp continues much longer and hence inspiration is prolonged and the tidal volume increases. Apneustic center: - This center located in the lower (caudal) part of pons. The apneustic center excites inspiratory center (DRG) and produce a prolonged inspiratory drive which delays the onset of expiration. Thus, though the respiratory rhythm is established in the medulla, this rhythm is spoilt by a strong inspira- tory drive orginating in the apneustic centers. However, two influences seems to keep the apneustic center in check: (i) Pneumotaxic center of upper pons and (ii) Influence from stretch receptors in lung via vagus. Both of these influence inhibit inspiratory activity.",

Increased H+ The primary direct stimulus for central chemoreceptors is increased H+ concentration in the CSF and brain interstitial fluid. \"The primary direct stimulus for central chemoreceptors is increased H+ concentration in the CSF and brain interstitial fluid. But the cone: in the brain parallels the arterial PCO2 and not arterial H+ cone. \"Even though the central chemoreceptors are directly stimulated by H+ ions: the blood H+ ions are poorly permeable through the blood brain barrier and hence are not able to regulate ventilation though the central chemoreceptors. Whereas, CO2 is highly permeable to the blood brain barrier. It enters the brain, where it is hydrated to give rise to H+ and HCO2 ions. Now these H+ ions directly stimulate the central chemoreceptors to regulate the ventilation.

The primary stimulus for the central chemoreceptors is an increase in the hydrogen ion concentration. Stimulation of central chemoreceptors by increased hydrogen ion concentration leads to excitation of the respiratory neurons, thereby producing an increase in the rate and depth of respiration o Although the primary stimulus for central chemoreceptors is an increase in hydrogen ion concentration, in actual practice the physiological stimulus is an increase in PCO2. The reason is that hydrogen ions cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, a change in the blood hydrogen ion concentration does not change the hydrogen ion concentration in the immediate vicinity of the chemosensitive neurons (i. e., in CSF and brain interstitial fluid). On the other hand, CO2 being lipid soluble can easily cross the blood-brain barrier. It enters the brain, where it is hydrated to give rise to H+ and HCO2 ions. Now these H+ directly stimulate the central chemoreceptors. o Thus, central chemoreceptors are directly stimulated by an increase in H+ concentration in CSF and brain interstitial tissue, which is brought about by the change in arterial PCO2 (Pa.
