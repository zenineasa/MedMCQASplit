        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Epididymis Spermatozoa leaving the testis (seminiferous ubules) are not fully mobile. They continue their maturation and acquire their mobility during their passage through epididymis. From epididymis they come to vas deference, distal end of which also receives the secretions of seminal vesicle, and continues as the ejeculatory duct. The ejeculatory duct joins the prostatic urethra. Once ejeculated into the the female, vaginal secretions improve the motility and feilizing ability of sperms. Fuher exposure to secretions of female genital tract (in uterus and/or fallopian tube) fuher improves the mobility and feilizing ability of the sperms. The beneficial effects of stay in the female genital tract are collectively called capacitation, from the isthmus, capacitated sperms move rapidly to the ampullas, where feilization takes place.",
