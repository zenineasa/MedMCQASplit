The rule is: if the wave immediately after the P wave is an upward deflection, it is an R wave; if it is a downward deflection, it is a Q wave: i. small Q waves correspond to depolarization of the interventricular septum. Q waves can also relate to breathing and are generally small and thin.

'Elevated intracranial pressure, as caused by space occupying lesion like brain tumor or head trauma with associated intracranial bleeding (e. g. epidural /subdural/cerebral- haemorrhage), results in an increased systemic blood pressure (BP) and bradycardiaQ (rather than tachycardia) and irregular breathing. This response is called Cushing's reflex or phenomenon. 'Cushing's Triad. Increase in systolic blood pressureQ (Widening of pulse pressure). Reduction of the heart rateQ (bradycardia). Irregular respirationQ (caused by impaired brainstem function). Cushing Reflex. Cushing reflex (also referred to as the vasopressor response), is a physiological nervous system response to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) that results in Cushing's triad of increased blood pressure, irregular breathing, and a reduction of the heart rateQ. It is usually seen in the terminal stages of acute head injury and may indicate imminent brain herniationQ. These symptoms can be indicative of insufficient blood flow to the brain (ischemia) as well as compression of arteriolesQ. Etiology: It is a special CNS ischemic response that results from increased intracranial tension (or increased CSF pressure around the brain in cranial vault). Causes of increased ICT may be space occupying lesions such as brain tumorQ, cerebral abscess, head traumaQ with associated intra cranial bleeding (epidural/ subdural/ cerebral-haemorrhage). Pathophysiology: When the ICT or CSF pressure rises to equal the arterial pressure, it compresses the whole brain as well as the arteries in the brain and cuts off the blood supply to the brain, thereby activating the CNS ischemic response. Compromised blood supply, local hypoxia and hypercapnia of RVLM (rostral ventrolateral medulla) neurons or vasomotor area increase their discharge and evoke Cushing's reaction raising systemic arterial pressureQ. Cushing Reflex. The resultant rise in systemic arterial pressure (due to ischemic stimulation of vasomotor regions in medulla) tend to restore the blood flow to medulla, thereby protecting the vital centers of brain from loss of nutrition if ICT rises enough to compress cerebral arteries. The rise in BP is proportional to increase in intracranial tension (over a considerable range) and causes a reflex decrease in heart rate via the arterial baroreceptors. This is why bradycardia rather than tachycardia is characteristically seen in patients with increased intra cranial pressureQ. Bezotd-Jarisch reflex* In experimental animals, injections of serotonin, veratridine, capsaicin, phenyldiguanide. and some other drugs into the coronary arteries supplying the left ventricle cause apnea followed by rapid breathing, hypotension, and bradycardia (the coronary chemoreflex or Bezold-Jarisch reflex).* The receptors are probably C fiber endings, and the afferents are vagal.* The response is not produced by injections into the blood supply of the atria or the right ventricle. Hering-Bruer reflex* The Hering-Breuer inflation reflex is an increase in the duration of expiration produced by steady lung inflation, and the Hering-Breuer deflation reflex is a decrease in the duration of expiration produced by marked deflation of the lung. Bainbridge's reflex* Rapid infusion of blood or saline in anesthetized animals sometimes produces a rise in heart rate if the initial heart rate is low. This effect was described by Bainbridge in 1915, and since then it has been known as the Bainbridge reflex.",

Cushing's reflex or triad is a special type of CNS ischemic response that results from increased pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid around the brain in the cranial vault. For instance, when intracranial pressure increases the cerebrospinal pressure rises equal to the arterial pressure. This compresses the whole brain as well as the arteries in the brain and cuts off the blood supply to the brain. This initiates a CNS ischemic response that causes the arterial pressure to rise, when the arterial pressure has risen to a level higher than the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, blood flows once again into the vessel of the brain to relieve the ischemia. (Cushing's reflex). Ordinarily, the blood pressure comes to a new equilibrium level slightly higher than the cerebrospinal fluid pressure, thus allowing blood to continue flowing to the brain. The cushing reaction helps to protect the vital centres of the brain from loss of nutrition if ever the CSF pressure rises high enough to compress the cerebral arteries. The rise in the arterial pressure causes a reflex decrease in heart rate via the arterial baroreceptors and this is why bradycardia rather than tachycardia is characteristically seen in patients with increased intracranial pressure.",

        "exp": "Ans. B. Total peripheral resistance. (Ref. Ganong 23rd/pg. 80-81; Guyton 11th/pg. 80). During exercise, sympathetic stimulation of the heart increases contractility; and thus stroke volume. A decrease in venous compliance, caused by sympathetic stimulation, increases venous return to the heart; which also increases stroke volume by a Frank-Starling mechanism. The increased stroke volume, coupled with an increase in heart rate, cause an increase in cardiac output Systemic arterial pressure also increases in response to the increase in cardiac output. However, the fall in total peripheral resistance, which is caused by dilation of the blood vessels within the exercising muscles, results in a decrease in diastolic pressure. The pulmonary vessels undergo passive dilation as more blood flows into the pulmonary circulation. As a result, pulmonary vascular resistance decreases. Additional Educational points: Isometric Versus Isotonic Contraction# Muscle contraction is said to be isometric when the muscle does not shorten during contraction and isotonic when it does shorten but the tension on the muscle remains constant throughout the contraction.# In the isometric system, the muscle contracts against a force transducer without decreasing the muscle length. In the isotonic system, the muscle shortens against a fixed load. The characteristics of isotonic contraction depend on the load against which the muscle contracts, as well as the inertia of the load. However, the isometric system records strictly changes in force of muscle contraction itself. Therefore, the isometric system is most often used when comparing the functional characteristics of different muscle types.",

This makes sense, because with a fight or flight response, heart rate increases, as a consequence of:|Conduction velocity (Positive dromotropic)|Refractory period (so that cardiac tissue becomes excitable in a shorter span on time)2 Blood vesselso Stimulation of a1 receptors cause vasoconstriction. Stimulation of b2 receptors cause vasodilation. Vasoconstriction (a1 receptors) predominate in skin, mucosal, renal andsphianchnic blood vessels. Dilatation (b2 receptors) predominate in skeletal muscles, liver and coronary blood vessels. The direct effect on cerebral vessels is not prominent - blood flow through this bed parallels change in BP. Renal vessels contain both a1 (vasoconstriction) and D1 (vasodilatiator) receptor. Therefore sympathetic stimulation cause less increase in vascular resistance as compared to other sites where sympathetic stimulation causes vasconstriction. 3.

Traube Hering Waves are oscillations in BP that occur with a frequency of 4/min, and are attributable to rhythmic oscillations in intensity of sympathetic vasomotor discharge. TRAUBE-HERING WAVESThese are the medium waves of the recording, which are formed by fluctuation in BP synchronous with respiration. The wave shows a rise in pressure during inspiration and a fall during expiration. These waves are produced due to change in vagal and sympathetic activity in different phases of respiration. The vasomotor centre is stimulated during inspiration by the irradiation of impulses from the inspiratory centres which causes rise in blood pressure. Also during inspiration, the intrathoracic pressure becomes more negative, therefore venous return increases, which in turn increases cardiac output and BP.

The traditional figure is 1. 34 mL of O2.# In vivo, the hemoglobin in the blood at the ends of the pulmonary capillaries is about 97. 5% saturated with 02 (PO2 = 97 mm Hg).

        "exp": "Ans. d). Decreased cardiac output. (Ref. Ganong Physiology 23rd/Chapter 33). Inflation of the lungs causes vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure. This response is mediated via vagal afferents from the lungs that inhibit vasomotor discharge. Pain usually causes a rise in blood pressure via afferent impulses in the reticular formation converging in the RVLM. VASOMOTOR CONTROL# Spinal reflex activity affects blood pressure, but the main control of blood pressure is exerted by groups of neurons in the medulla oblongata that are sometimes called the vasomotor area / center.# Neurons that mediate increased sympathetic discharge to blood vessels and the heart project directly to sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the intermediolateral gray column (IML) of the spinal cord.# On each side, the cell bodies of these neurons are located near the pial surface of the medulla in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). They contain PNMT, but it appears that the excitatory transmitter they secrete is glutamate rather than epinephrine.# When vasoconstrictor discharge increases, arteriolar constriction also increases and blood pressure rises.# Venoconstriction and a decrease in the stores of blood in the venous reservoirs usually accompany these changes, although changes in the capacitance vessels do not always parallel changes in the resistance vessels. Heart rate and stroke volume are increased because of activity in the sympathetic nerves to the heart, and cardiac output is increased.# Control of heart activity bx vasomotor center:# Lateral portions of vasomotor center transmit excitatory impulses through sympathetic fibers and increases heart rate and contractility.# Medial portion of vasomotor center- Lies in apposition to dorsal motor nuclei of vagus nerves- Transmits parasympathetic impulses through the vagus nerves to the heart to decrease heart rate. Vasomotor center can also decrease heart rate. Factors Affecting the Activity of the Vasomotor Area in the Medulla. Direct stimulation. CO2 and hypoxia. Excitatory inputs.

Peripheral resistance and DBP also increase due to sympathetic vasoconstriction. Sympathetic cholinergic system does cause Vasodilatation but only in few organs like Skeletal muscle, Uterus and Sweat glands. b. In Lungs there is not much rise in pulmonary vascular resistance because of opening of precapillary sphincters.

        "question": "Maximum pressure in left ventricle is seen in which phase of cardiac cycle -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Ventricular ejection o During ventricular ejection phase, when the steeply rising left ventricular pressure exceeds the aortic pressure (120 mm Hg), it is able to push open the aortic valve and eject the blad into the aorta, making the onset of ventricular ejection. PHASE OF CARDIAC CYCLEo A cardiac cycle refers to the interval between onset of one heartbeat to the onset of the next heart beat. It has two main phases: Ventricular systole and ventricular diastole. Ventricular systole tor simply systole)o The systolic phase is divided into: -Isovolumetric contraction: As the ventricular contraction starts, the intraventricular pressure begins to rise, leading to an abrupt closure of AV valves (mitral and tricuspid valves). The closure of AV valves produces first heart sound (S1). the pressure is not enough to push open the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary) but causes the closed AV valve to bulge into the atrium, causing a small but sharp rise in atrial pressure called the 'C' wave on jugular venous pulse (JVP). Because both the valves (AV valves an semilunar valves) are closed, there is no change in volume, i. e., there is isovolumetric (isometric) contraction. Isovolumetric contraction ends with opening of semilunar (aortic and pulmonary ) valves. Ventricular ejection: When the steeply rising ventricular pressure exceeds the pressure in aorta and pulmonary artery, the semilunar valves open and ventricular ejection begins. The ejection of blood is rapid at first (rapid ejection phase), but slows down during later part of systole (slow ejection phase). During rapid ejection phase, when the ventricles contract, the fibrous partition separating the ventricles from the atria (the AV ring) is pulled down. As a result, the atrial muscles get stretched and the atria dilate which causes a sharp fall in atrial pressure and the X-descent in JVP. Protodiastole: In this very short phase, ventricles start relaxing and ventricular pressure begins to fall very sharply but the semilunar valves are still open. As a result, the column of blood in aorta (or pulmonary artery for right ventricle) tries to fall into the ventricle, hitting on its way the semilunar (aortic or pulmonary) valves. This causes closure of the aortic/pulmonary valves w hich produces 2nd heart sound (S2). The venous blood flow continues to flow in the atria from great veins (SVC and ICC) and there is relaxation of fibrous AV ring due to ventricular relaxation; both of which cause a rise in atrial pressure and production of 'V' wave in JVP. Ventricular diastole (or simply diastole)o The diastole phase is divided into: -Isovolumetric relaxation: - This phase is the period between the closure of semilunar valve and opening of the AV valve. The ventricles continue relaxing and there pressure continues to fall. However, as both valves (AV valves and semilunar valves) are closed, there is no change in volume, i. e., isovolumetric relaxation. Relaxation phase ends w ith opening of AV valve. Rapid ventricular filling: - When the ventricular pressure falls below atrial pressure, AV valves open and the accumulated blood in the atria rushes into the ventricle very rapidly. This passive filling contributes to 70% of ventricular filling, normally. This results in a sharp fall in atrial pressure which produces Y descent in JVP. Diastasis: - After the initial rapid ventricular filling, blood flow's slowly and smoothly from the SVC and IVC through the right atrium into the right ventricle without any turbulence anywhere along the path. Similarly, blood from the pulmonary' veins flows into the left ventricle without any turbulence. This phase of nonturbulent ventricular filling is called diastasis. The atrial pressure remains slightly greater than the ventricular pressure because inflow' to atrium exceeds the outflow the atrium. Last rapid filling phase (atrial systole): - The atria contract and pump blood rapidly into the ventricles. Atrial systole is associated with sharp rise in atrial pressure which produces a-wave in JVP.",

The tunica intima and tunica media are separated by internal elastic lamina. Tunica media and tunica adventitia are separated by external elastic lamina. Internal and external elastic lamina contain elastic tissue and are responsible for elasticity of vessels, especially large vessels. o The arterial system comprise: -i) Large elastic arteries (windkessel vessels):# These vessels have well developed elastic laminae and therefore a lot of elastic tissue in their wall. The elastic walls prevent abrupt changes in BP a phenomenon called the Windkessel effect.# The walls are stretched during systole, preventing a sudden rise in BP. During diastole, the recoil back, preventing a sudden drop in BP.# Aorta and its immediate braches are windkessel vessels. ii) Large muscular distributing arteries:# These contain less elastic tissue and more muscle fibers than large elastic arteries.# Examples are radial, ulnar, popliteal arteries etc. iii) Arterioles (resistance vessels):# Arterioles contain very less elastic tissue but much more smooth muscle. Arterioles are the major site of vascular resistance.# This is because of two factors: (i) Presence of considerable amounts of smooth muscle in their walls; (ii) By sympathetic (nor-adrenergic) innervation, which constricts the arterioles by producing contraction of smooth muscles.# Beside sympathetic innervation, arteriolar smooth muscle also respond to the products of local metabolism CO2, adenosine, H+ and lactic acid cause arteriolar dilatation.# Distribution of blood flow is mainly regulated by arterioles, by these two mechanisms, i. e., sympathetic innervation and local control by metabolites.# For example, during muscular exercise, strong sympathetic stimulation causes vasoconstriction of the arterioles in the splanchnic area. At the same time, local metabolites cause arteriolar dilatation in the skeletal muscles and myocardium. Therefore, the blood flow is diverted to exercising muscles and the heart.",

The principal site of inactivation of erythropoietin is the liver.* * Hypoxia is the main stimulant for the secretion of erythropoitin* Secretion of the hormone is fascilitated by alkalosis that develops at high altitudes* Both norepinephrine and epinephrine and several of the prostaglandins stimulate erythropoietin production (385-Gyton 10th). Anemia in CRF caused by decreased erythropoietin secretion (376-Gyton 10th). Patients with severe CRF, (when renal mass is reduced) or nephrectomy, almost always develop anemia. The most important cause of this is decreased renal secretion of erythropoietin, which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells. If the kidneys are seriously damaged, they are unable to form adequate quantities of erythropoietin, which leads to diminished red blood cell production and consequent anemia. Factors affecting Erythropoietin production. Increase. Decrease1. Hypoxia due to haemorrhage, high altitude, Cardio respiratory disturbance methemoglobin excess2.

Significance of Frank-Starling Law(I) The law helps up to explain that blood ejected by each of the ventricle per heart beat is the same. If RV out put per beat exceeds LV output. This will cause accumulation of blood in LV; the Frank Starling law begins to operate causing more complete evacuation of LV. Thus the out put of two ventricles becomes the same again(II) It is a life saving device in cardiac failure. How? LVF causes accumulation of blood within LV thereby decreases blood supply to vital organs. However accumulation of blood in LV initiates operation of Frank Starling mechanism leading to greater output by LV If accumulation of blood is too great, the Frank Starling law will fail to operate, decreasing blood supply to vital organs and finally leads to death.* During diastole, filling of the ventricles normally increases the volume of each ventricles to about 110 to 120 ml, this volume is known as end-diastolic volume",

        "exp": "Ans: b (Release of calcium) Ref Khurana text book of physiology. If activated factor XIII is given the option you can go for that. Otherwise only correct answer is calcium. Thrombosthenin is involved in clot retraction. Platelet-associated factor XIII provides a means by which to promote clot stabilization and platelet interaction with proteins of the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways. Fibrin stabilising factor (factor XIII) which is normally present in the plasma and also released from activated platelets is activated by thrombin to form XIIla but the XIIIa in the prescence of Ca2+ causes formation of covalent crosslinkages between fibrin threads, thus adding tremendous strength to the fibrin meshwork. The fibrin meshwork traps the remaining components of plasma and blood cells to form a solid mass called clot. Thrombomodulin is a thrombin binding protein produced by all endothelial cells except those in cerebral microcirculation. lt converts thrombin into protein C activator (AIPGME2007). Thrombasthenin is a contractile protein present in platelet involved in clot retraction and not in stabilization. Activated factor XIII will bind to the surface of activated platelets. These platelets then participate in cell-cell or cell-clot interactions, thereby increasing the local concentration of factor XIIIa. The platelet-associated factor Xllla may increase the amount of crosslinking in a fibrin clot, thereby contributing to the aging of the clot and the reduction in the degree of platelet binding. Clot resistance to fibrinolysis is enhanced by platelet factor XEIIa-mediated crosslinking of alpha 2-antiplasmin to fibrin. The binding of factor XIIIa to the platelet surface requires the activation of the platelet fibrinogen receptor, glycoprotein Ilb-IIIa. Thus, platelet-associated factor Xllla may be used as a marker of in vivo platelet activation. Since half of the factor XIII present in blood is provided by the platelets, it is not surprising that this form of factor XIII plays an important role in hemostasis.",

VPHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF CARDIAC MUSCLE# Myocardial fibers have a resting membrane potential of approximately -90 mV.# The individual fibers are separated by membranes, but depolarization spreads radially through them as if they were a syncytium, because of the presence of gap junctions.# The transmembrane action potential of single cardiac muscle cells is characterized by rapid depolarization, a plateau, and a slow repolarization process.# The initial depolarization is due to Na+ influx through rapidly opening Na+ channels (the Na+ current, INa). Ca2+ influx through more slowly opening Ca2+ channels (the Ca2+ current, ICa) produces the plateau phase, and repolarization is due to net K+ efflux through multiple types of K+ channels.# Recorded extracellularly, the summed electrical activity of all the cardiac muscle fibers is the ECG. In phase 4 of action potential of cardiac muscle there exists a constant resting membrane potential of -85 to -90 mV. In pacemaker (SA node) fibres, however, the resting membrane potential is only of - 55 to -60. - Textbook Of Medical Physiology by Indu Khurana - Pg. 258. Salient features of pacemaker potential# The action potentials in the SA and AV nodes are largely due to Ca2+, with no contribution by Na+ influx.# Consequently there is no sharp, rapid depolarizing spike before the plateau, as there is in other parts of the conduction system and the atrial and ventricular fibers.# These are of two types in the heart, the T (for transient) channels and the L (for long-lasting) channels.# The calcium current (ICa) due to opening of T channels completes the prepotential, and ICa due to opening of L channels produces the impulse.

Serum has essentially the same composition as plasma, except that its fibrinogen and clotting factors II, V, and VIII have been removed and it has a higher serotonin content due to breakdown of platelets during clotting. Guyton & Hall's Textbook of Medical Physiology 11th/pg. 463.......... \"Within a few minutes after a clot is formed, it begins to contract and usually expresses most of the fluid from the clot within 20 to 60 minutes. The fluid expressed is called serum because all its fibrinogen and most of the other clotting factors have been removed; in this way, serum differs from plasma. Serum cannot clot because it lacks these factors. Platelets are necessary for clot retraction to occur. Therefore, failure of clot retraction is an indication that the number of platelets in the circulating blood might be low. \"Additional educational point:# Tissue factor initiates the extrinsic pathway, whereas contact of Factor XII and platelets with collagen in the vascular wall initiates the intrinsic pathway.# An especially important difference between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways is that the extrinsic pathway can be explosive; once initiated, its speed of completion to the final clot is limited only by the amount of tissue factor released from the traumatized tissues and by the quantities of Factors X, VII, and V in the blood. With severe tissue trauma, clotting can occur in as little as 15 seconds. The intrinsic pathway is much slower to proceed, usually requiring 1 to 6 minutes to cause clotting.",

Starling's curve is the plot of this preload Vs force of contraction. So, X axis is preload and Y axis is force of contraction. Representatives for preload - X axis can be end-diastolic volume or central venous pressure. Representatives for force of contraction - Y axis can be stroke volume or cardiac output. Starling curve shifts up and to the left means increase in contractility & decrease in after load. Starling curve shifts down and to the right means decrease in contractility & increase in after load. Regarding this question, Point marked X is the normal curve. Mild hemorrhage can lead to decrease in preload (venous return)A major Compensatory mechanism for Mild hemorrhage is sympathetic activation which causes increase in cardiac contractility & heart rate.

Factors affecting the concentration of 2, 3-BPG in the red cells includei. pH (acidosis inhibits red cell glycolysis, the 2, 3-BPG concentration falls when the pH is low). ii.

        "exp": "Ans. B. Reduced plasma colloidal osmotic pressure. (Ref. Ganong 23rd/pg. 592 - 594)# Net fluid movement depends on net driving pressure and two other important factors related to the properties of the membranes. The filtration coefficient, Kf, depends on the surface area and the permeability of the capillary wall to water (hydraulic conductivity). Leaky capillaries (e. g., due to histamine) have a high Kf. Glomerular capillaries have a high Kf, needed for their function.# The potential causes of pulmonary edema and pleural effusion are increases in capillary hydrostatic pressure, increases in interstitial colloid osmotic pressure, decreased plasma colloid osmotic pressure. Edema due to hydrostatic pressure is called cardiogenic edema. Edema due to osmotic pressure and membrane properties is called non- cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Fluid Filtration Across Capillaries Is Determined by Hydrostatic and Colloid Osmotic Pressures, and Capillary Filtration Coefficient. Four primary forces that determine whether fluid will move out of the blood into the interstitial fluid or in the opposite direction. These forces, called \"Starling forces \" in honor of the physiologist who first demonstrated their importance: 1) The capillary pressure (Pc), which tends to force fluid outward through the capillary membrane. 2) The interstitial fluid pressure (Pif), which tends to force fluid inward through the capillary membrane when Pif is positive but outward when Pif is negative. 3) The capillary plasma colloid osmotic pressure (Pp), which tends to cause osmosis of fluid inward through the capillary membrane. 4) The interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure (Pif), which tends to cause osmosis of fluid outward through the capillary membrane. If the sum of these forces, the net filtration pressure, is positive, there will be a net fluid filtration across the capillaries. If the sum of the Starling forces is negative, there will be a net fluid absorption from the interstitial spaces into the capillaries. Net filtration from systemic capillaries is dependent on the Starling forces and capillary permeability. Equation is: Net filtration = Kf where Kf is the filtration coefficient of the membrane, and is directly proportional to capillary permeability, Pcapillary and Ptissue are the hydrostatic pressures in the capillary and tissue (interstitial space), respectively, and pcapillary and ptissue are the osmotic (colloid oncotic) pressures in the capillary and interstitial space, respectively. Increasing central venous pressure increases the capillary hydrostatic pressure (Pcapillary), which increases the filtration of fluid from the systemic capillaries, leading to edema. The movement of fluid between vascular and interstitial spaces is controlled mainly by the opposing effects of vascular hydrostatic pressure and plasma colloid osmotic pressure. Normally, the exit of fluid into the interstitium from the arteriolar end of the microcirculation is nearly balanced by inflow at the venular end; the lymphatics drain a small residual amount of excess interstitial fluid. Either increased capillary pressure or diminished colloid osmotic pressure can result in increased interstitial fluid, n Increased Hydrostatic Pressure. Localized increases in intravascular pressure can result from impaired venous return; if the failing heart cannot increase cardiac output, the extra fluid load causes increased venous pressure and, eventually, edema.# Reduced Plasma Osmotic Pressure. Capillary hydrostatic and osmotic forces are normally balanced so that there is no net loss or gain of fluid across the capillary bed. However, increased hydrostatic pressure or diminished plasma osmotic pressure leads to a net accumulation of extravascular fluid (edema). If the ability of the lymphatics to drain tissue fluid is exceeded, persistent tissue edema results.# Effect of Abnormal Imbalance of Forces at the Capillary Membrane. If the mean capillary pressure rises above 17 mm Hg, the net force tending to cause filtration of fluid into the tissue spaces rises. Thus, a 20 mm Hg rise in mean capillary pressure causes an increase in net filtration pressure from 0. 3 mm Hg to 20. 3 mm Hg, which results in 68 times as much net filtration of fluid into the interstitial spaces as normally occurs. To prevent accumulation of excess fluid in these spaces would require 68 times the normal flow of fluid into the lymphatic system, an amount that is 2 to 5 times too much for the lymphatics to carry away. As a result, fluid will begin to accumulate in the interstitial spaces, and edema will result. Conversely, if the capillary pressure falls very low, net reabsorption of fluid into the capillaries will occur instead of net filtration, and the blood volume will increase at the expense of the interstitial fluid volume. Note: Approximately 60% of lean body weight is water, two-thirds of which is intracellular and the remainder is in extracellular compartments, mostly as interstitial fluid; only 5% of total body water is in blood plasma.",

Changes in vessel caliber primarily occur in vessels upstream to the glomeruli (cortical radial arteries and afferent arterioles). Because autoregulatory range extends from an arterial blood pressure of about 80 to 180 mm Hg, renal blood flow is not maintained when blood pressure is low; in fact, the sympathetic nervous system will be activated and cause intense vasoconstriction in the kidneys. Renal autoregulation does not depend on nerves.",
