        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., Somatostatin o There are following phases of gastric acid secretion : -The cephalic phase Just as salivary secretion may start before food enters the mouth, gastric secretion is also intitiated before food enters the stomach . Sight, smell or even thought of food stimulate gastric acid secretion. It is by parsympathetic system through vagus. This phase accounts for 20% of acid secretion.The gastric phase :- This phase of acid secretion comes into play when food makes contact with the gastric mucosa. Acid secretion in this phase is brought about t%vo factors (i) Hormonal stimulation due to gastrin release and (ii) Stretch of stomach wall due to gastric distension which activates a vago-vagal reflex as well as a local intragastric reflex. This phase accounts for 72-80% of acid secretion.The intestinal phase Once the food enters upper portion of small intestine (i.e., duodenum) it causes small amounts of gastric juice secretion because of gastrin released from dudenal mucosa. While the intestinal phase play only a minor role in stimulation of gastric secretion, presence of food in the intestine plays a major role in its inhibition. With the entry' of food into the duodenum, gastric secretion starts slowing down. The presence of acid, fats, and products of protein digestion; and increased os molarity in the duodenum inhibit gastric secretion by (i) Hormonal mechanism : These mentioned stimuli cause the release of several intestinal hormones like secretin, cholecystokinin (CCK), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastric inhibitor polypeptide (GIP) and somatostatin. These local hormones inhibit the gastric secretion as well as gastric motility', (ii) Neural mechanism (enterogastric reflex): The above mentioned stimuli inhibit gastric secretion and motility by intrinsic neural reflex.",

Oxvntic glands (Gastric glands)- secrete hydrochloric acid, pepsinogen, intrinsic factor and mucus.2. Pyloric glands - mucus for protection of the pyloric mucosa from the stomach acid; also secrete the hormone gastrin.Stomach oxyntic gland is composed of three types of cells:1. Mucous neck cells - secrete mainly mucus2. Peptic (or chief) cells - secrete large quantities of pepsinogen3.
