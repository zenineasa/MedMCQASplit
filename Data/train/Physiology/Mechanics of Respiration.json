When a forceful expiratory effort is made following changes are seen-In the beginning, when the lung is fully expanded, air flow rate is very high but as the lung volume shrinks (due to continuance of expiration), air flow rate reduces continually. A time, thus comes when despite a maximal expiratory effort, virtually no more air is driven out of the lungs. This volume of lung, at which no air flow from the lung occurs despite effort, is called the closing volume. ReasonA negative intrapleural pressure is required to keep the bronchioles stretched open. As the lung deflates, the intrapleural pressure (Ppl) rises from negative value to 'zero' - this creates a situation when the walls of the bronchioles are no more stretched - bronchodilation ceases - bronchial narrowing - increased air flow resistance - drop of rate of airflow. When the lung volume has sufficiently shrunken, the finest bronchioles are virtually closed - closing volume.",

        "question": "Pleural pressure at the end of inspiration is -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e.. More negative o During quiet breathing, the intrapleural pressure fluctuates between -3 and -6 mm Hg, depending upon the phase of respiration, more negative at the end of inspiration and less negative during expiration. Intrapleural pressure (Pleural pressure)o It is the pressure between two pleural surfaces. The lung is covered with visceral pleura and the thoracic cage is lined on inside with parietal pleura. Between the two layers of pleura is a very narrow space, called the pleural cavity. Intrapleural pressure is always negative and during quiet breathing the Intrapleural pressure fluctuates between -3. 8 mm Hg (- 5. 0 cm water)1 to -6. 0 mm Hg (-8. 0 cm water). o Now let us examine why the pleural pressure is negative; more negative during inspiration, less negative during expiraion, but always negative during quiet breathing. The key to the answer is the fact that both the thoracic cage and lungs are elastic structures. Being elastic structure they both tend to recoil, but in opposite direction. The lungs have a tendency to collapse and thoracic cage has a tendency to expand. However, because of the anatomical relationships in the body, these tendencies do not normally materialize. But the tendencies do create an inward pull on the visceral pleura (by lung) and an outward pull on parietal pleura (by thoracic cage). The results of these pulls is a negative pressure in the space between the pleural surfaces, i. e., in the pleural cavity.",
