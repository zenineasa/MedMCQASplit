Option A: The brain, upon transmitting motor impulses to the exercising muscles, is believed to transmit collateral impulses into the brainstem at the same time to excite the respiratory center. This action is analogous to the stimulation of the vasomotor center of the brain stem during exercise that causes a simultaneous increase in aerial pressure. Option B: The pO2 of mixed venous blood does fall, but there are no known chemoreceptors that are stimualated as a result. Option C: Two points are impoant regarding pH during moderate exercise: pH = pK + log () The pH of the blood is dependent only on the ratio of the amount of CO2 to the amount of HCO3- The concentration of both buffer components (HCO3- and CO2-) are very large compared to the amount of H+ added to the blood during moderate exercise. Thus, any change in HCO3- due to the addition of H+ during moderate exercise remains constant. When sufficient oxygen is not available during exercise, there is increased accumulation of lactic acid, which initially leads to an increase in paCO2. However, this is counteracted by the stimulation for fuher lactic acid production and prevents a decline in blood pH. Thus, blood pH remains constant in moderate exercise.

Plasma proteins are effective buffers because both their free carboxyl and their free amino groups dissociate. The second buffer system is provided by the dissociation of the imidazole groups of the histidine residues in hemoglobin. In the pH 7.0-7.7 range, the free carboxyl and amino groups of hemoglobin contribute relatively little to its buffering capacity. However, the hemoglobin molecule contains 38 histidine residues, and on this basis--plus the fact that hemoglobin is present in large amounts--the hemoglobin in blood has six times the buffering capacity of the plasma proteins. In addition, the action of hemoglobin is unique because the imidazole groups of deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) dissociate less than those of oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), making Hb a weaker acid and therefore a better buffer than HBO.Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology Twenty-Third Edition Page no: 614",

They initially breathed 2.5% CO2 in oxygen for 75 breaths. Ventilatory parameters of the last 10 breaths were used as controls. In 7 subsequent test sessions each lasting 2 min alternating with 2 min free breathing periods, subjects tried to achieve a target ventilation ranging from 0.7 to 1.3 times the control with a visual feedback system. End-tidal CO2 was regulated automatically at the control level by changing the inspired CO2. Breathing discomfo was measured at the end of each session using a visual analog scale. Isocapnic constraining of ventilation (0.7 times the control) during exercise significantly increased respiratory discomfo (p < 0.05). Increases in ventilation had no significant effect. These results indicate that respiratory discomfo during exercise is exaggerated when the level of ventilation falls below that spontaneously adopted even when chemical drives are held constant.

        "exp": "It is interesting that while O2 is necessary for life in aerobic organisms, it is also toxic. Indeed, 100% O2 has been demonstrated to exe toxic effects not only in animals but also in bacteria, fungi, cultured animal cells, and plants. The toxicity seems to be due to the production of reactive oxygen species including superoxide anion (O2 -) and H2O2. When 80-100% O2 is administered to humans for periods of 8 h or more, the respiratory passages become irritated, causing substernal distress, nasal congestion, sore throat, and coughing. Some infants treated with O2 for respiratory distress syndrome develop a chronic condition characterized by lung cysts and densities (bronchopulmonary dysplasia). This syndrome may be a manifestation of O2 toxicity. Another complication in these infants is retinopathy of prematurity (retrolental fibroplasia), the formation of opaque vascular tissue in the eyes, which can lead to serious visual defects. The retinal receptors mature from the center to the periphery of the retina, and they use considerable O2. This causes the retina to become vascularized in an orderly fashion. Oxygen treatment before maturation is complete provides the needed O2 to the photoreceptors, and consequently, the normal vascular pattern fails to develop. Evidence indicates that this condition can be prevented or ameliorated by treatment with vitamin E, which exes an antioxidant effect, and, in animals, by growth hormone inhibitors. Administration of 100% O2 at increased pressure accelerates the onset of O2 toxicity, with the production not only of tracheobronchial irritation but also of muscle twitching, ringing in the ears, dizziness, convulsions, and coma. The speed with which these symptoms develop is propoional to the pressure at which the O2 is administered; for example, at 4 atmospheres, symptoms develop in half the subjects in 30 min, whereas at 6 atmospheres, convulsions develop in a few minutes.Ref: Ganong review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 622",

A note on respiratory ramp signal: The neuron signals transmitted to the inspiratory muscle, mainly the diaphragm, is not the instantaneous burst of action potentials. Instead, it begins weakly and increases steadily in a ramped manner. The advantage of the ramp is that it causes a steady increase in the volume of the lungs during inspiration, rather than inspiratory gasps.

        "exp": "Pleural pressure is the pressure of the fluid in the narrow space between the lung and the chest wall pleura which is normally a slight suction, which means a slightly negative pressure. There are no attachments between the lung and the walls of the chest cage except where it is suspended at its hilum from the mediastinum. Instead, the lung literally floats in the thoracic cavity. Fuhermore, continual suction of excessive fluid into lymphatic channels maintain a slight suction between the visceral surface of the lung pleura and the parietal pleural surface of the thoracic cavity. Therefore, the lungs are held to the thoracic wall as if glued there, except that they can slide freely, well lubricated as the chest expands and contracts. A concept from Boron&;s physiology/2nd Ed/ 630 The interaction between lungs and chest wall does not occur by direct attachment but through the intrapleural space between the visceral and parietal pleurae. This space is filled with a small amount of pleural fluid and is extremely thin (5 to 30 micrometer). Because the lungs and chest wall pull away from each other on opposite sides of the intrapleural space, the intrapleural pressure (PIP) is less than barometric pressure (PB); that is; the intrapleural space is a relative vacuum. Although the designation P implies that we are referring exclusively to the intrapleural space, this description is not entirely accurate. Indeed, in addition to the intrapleural space, PIP is probably similar to the pressure in several other regions of the chest cavity.The viual space between the chest wall or diaphragm and the parietal pleura.The viual space between the lung and the visceral pleura.The interstitial space that surrounds all pulmonary airways.Around the Hea and Vessels.Around and to the extent that smooth muscle tone can be neglected- inside the Esophagus.Ref: Guyton/10th Ed/ 432",

Surfactant is a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins (Table 35-2). If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. In spherical structures like the alveoli, the distending pressure equals two times the tension divided by the radius (P = 2T/r); if T is not reduced as r is reduced, the tension overcomes the distending pressure. Surfactant also helps to prevent pulmonary edema. It has been calculated that if it were not present, the unopposed surface tension in the alveoli would produce a 20 mm Hg force oring transudation of fluid from the blood into the alveoliRef: Ganong Review of Medical Physiology 23rd edition Page no: 597",

This signal inhibits the inspiratory ramp signals of the dorsal repsiratory group of neurons (DRG), thus, inspiration is quickly inhibited and expiration follows. Advantages of Hering-Breuer inflation reflex: It cuts down the inspiration time, and therfore., IT prevents overinflation of the lungs. Lungs operate at lower lung volumes increases to more than three times the normal tidal volume (tidal volume = 0.5 liters/breath; so , lung volume > 1.5 liters per breath activates the reflex).

        "question": "A person unacclimatised develops pulmonary edema",
        "exp": "When they first arrive at a high altitude, many individuals develop transient \"mountain sickness.\" This syndrome devel- ops 8 to 24 h after arrival at altitude and lasts 4 to 8 d. It is characterized by headache, irritability, insomnia, breathlessness, and nausea and vomiting. Its cause is unsettled, but it appears to be associated with cerebral edema. The low PO2 at high altitude causes aeriolar dilation, and if cerebral autoregulation does not compensate, there is an increase in capillary pressure that ors increased transudation of fluid into brain tissue. Individuals who do not develop mountain sickness have a diuresis at high altitude, and urine volume is decreased in individuals who develop the condition. High-altitude illness includes not only mountain sickness but also two more serious syndromes that complicate it: high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. In high-altitude cerebral edema, the capillary leakage in mountain sickness progresses to frank brain swelling, with ataxia, disorientation, and in some cases coma and death due to herniation of the brain through the tentorium. High-altitude pulmonary edema is a patchy edema of the lungs that is related to the marked pulmonary hypeension that develops at high altitude. It has been argued that it occurs because not all pulmonary aeries have enough smooth muscle to constrict in response to hypoxia, and in the capillaries supplied by those aeries, the general rise in pulmonary aerial pressure causes a capillary pressure increase that disrupts their walls (stress failure).Ref: Ganong review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 619",
