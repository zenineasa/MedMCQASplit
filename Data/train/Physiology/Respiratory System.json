The pressure in the intrapleural space between the lungs and chest wall is intrapleural pressure. Intrapleural pressure changes from -2. 5 to -6 mm. Hg during inspiration. During strong inspiratory effort it may reach up to -30 mm. Hg. Transpulmonary pressure. It is the difference between alveolar pressure and intrapleural pressure. It is the measure of elastic forces in the lungs. Alveolar pressure or intrapulmonary pressure. It is the pressure inside the lung alveoli. When no air flows the alveolar pressure is considered to be equal to the atmospheric pressure, i. e., 0 cm of water. During inspiration it decreases to -1 cm of water. During expiration it increases to+1 cm of water.",

It occurs in divers, compressed air is taken in order to match the pressures at deep sea. The air contains Nitrogen in almost 70 % of the mixture. At high pressures in the sea, the pressure over the body is balanced by the compressed air delivered to the lungs and the N2 stays dissolved in the tissues, more in fat than in other compaments. But if the diver ascends very quickly then the N2 is conveed into its gaseous form as the pressure outside the body drops down to 1 atm. (760 mm Hg), at first, they are smaller bubbles which later coalesce and progressively larger vessels are affected. Tissue ischemia and sometimes tissue death is the result. Coronaries getting blocked, cause myocardial damage. Most people with bends have joint pains and muscles of the arms and legs affecting 85-90%.

Bochdalek-hernia- Most Bochdalek hernia are on the left side (-80%) and may rarely be bilateral- Compression of the lung results in pulmonary hypoplasia, involving both the lungs( ipsilateral >contralateral- Pulmonary vasculature is also abnormal leading to pulmonary hypertension.- Thus the two main factors that affect morbidity and mortality are pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension.- The most frequent clinical presentation of CDH is respiratory distress due to severe hypoxemia.- The anteroposterior diameter of the chest may be large along with a scaphoid abdomen.- The diagnosis of CDH can be made prenatally by ultrasound.- The postnatal diagnosis is relatively straightforward because a plain chest radiograph demonstrates the gas bubbles or loops of bowel within the chest. There may also be a mediastinal shift away from the hernia.- Historically. The surgical repair of a CDH was considered to be a surgical emergency because it was bell the abdominal viscera within the chest prevented the ability to ventilate. More recently with the recognit role of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypoplasia and the adverse effects of early operative repair; pulmonary function has caused a policy of delayed repair. Thus most pediatric surgeons wait for a variable (24 to 72 hrs) to allow for stabilization of the infant before doing surgical repair.* About contents of the cong.

Option A: The brain, upon transmitting motor impulses to the exercising muscles, is believed to transmit collateral impulses into the brainstem at the same time to excite the respiratory center. This action is analogous to the stimulation of the vasomotor center of the brain stem during exercise that causes a simultaneous increase in aerial pressure. Option B: The p. O2 of mixed venous blood does fall, but there are no known chemoreceptors that are stimualated as a result. Option C: Two points are impoant regarding pH during moderate exercise: pH = pK + log () The pH of the blood is dependent only on the ratio of the amount of CO2 to the amount of HCO3- The concentration of both buffer components (HCO3- and CO2-) are very large compared to the amount of H+ added to the blood during moderate exercise. Thus, any change in HCO3- due to the addition of H+ during moderate exercise remains constant. When sufficient oxygen is not available during exercise, there is increased accumulation of lactic acid, which initially leads to an increase in pa. CO2. However, this is counteracted by the stimulation for fuher lactic acid production and prevents a decline in blood pH. Thus, blood pH remains constant in moderate exercise.

Option a is correct because normally Hb is 97% saturated, so even with increased concentration of inhaled O2, the % saturation of Hb slightly raises or remains relatively constant. Also the maximum O2 saturation of Hb can never be more than 100%, which is only 3% above normal. There will be increased in amount of dissolved O2 Normally, only about 3% of the total 02 is transported in dissolved state, as compared with 97% transported by the Hb. According to Henry's law partial pressure = concentration of dissolved gas/solubility and coefficient concentration of dissolved gas = partial pressure x solubility coefficient. And we know that pressure of gas is directly proportional to the concentration of the gas molecules.

The oxygen-hemoglobins dissociation curve, also called the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve or oxygen dissociation curve (ODC), is a curve that plots the proportion of hemoglobin in its saturated (oxygen-laden) form on the vertical axis against the prevailing oxygen tension on the horizontal axis. b. This curve is an important tool for understanding how our blood carries and releases oxygen. c. Specifically, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve relates oxygen saturation (SO2 ) and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PO2 ), and is determined by what is called \"hemoglobin affinity for oxygen\"; that is, how readily hemoglobin acquires and releases oxygen molecules into the fluid that surrounds it. d. Hemoglobin (Hb), a globular protein, is the primary vehicle for transporting oxygen in the blood. Oxygen is also carried dissolved in the blood's plasma, but to a much lesser degree. e. Hemoglobin is contained in erythrocytes, more commonly referred to as red blood cells. Under certain conditions, oxygen bound to the hemoglobin is released into the blood's plasma and absorbed into the tissues. Each hemoglobin molecule has the capacity to carry four oxygen molecules. f. How much of that capacity is filled by oxygen at any time is called the oxygen saturation. Expressed as a percentage, the oxygen saturation is the ratio of the amount of oxygen bound to the hemoglobin, to the oxygen-carrying capacity of the hemoglobin. g. The oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin is determined by the type of hemoglobin present in the blood. The amount of oxygen bound to the hemoglobin at any time is related, in large part, to the partial pressure of oxygen to which the hemoglobin is exposed. h. In the lungs, at the alveolar-capillary interface, the partial pressure of oxygen is typically high, and therefore the oxygen binds readily to hemoglobin that is present. i. As the blood circulates to other body tissue in which the partial pressure of oxygen is less, the hemoglobin releases the oxygen into the tissue because the hemoglobin cannot maintain its full bound capacity of oxygen in the presence of lower oxygen partial pressures.

Ganong 23rd/Chapter 32; Figure 32-24).# The resistance to blood flow is determined not only by the radius of the blood vessels (vascular hindrance) but also by the viscosity of the blood. Plasma is about 1. 8 times as viscous as water, whereas whole blood is 3 to 4 times as viscous as water. Thus, viscosity depends for the most part on the hematocrit, that is, the percentage of the volume of blood occupied by red blood cells. The effect of viscosity in vivo deviates from that predicted by the Poiseuille- Hagen formula (R=8hL/pr4).# In large vessels, increases in hematocrit cause appreciable increases in viscosity. In severe polycythemia, the increase in resistance does increase the work of the heart. Conversely, in marked anemia, peripheral resistance is decreased, in part because of the decline in viscosity.# Of course, the decrease in hemoglobin decreases the O2-carrying ability of the blood. but the improved blood flow due to the decrease in viscosity partially compensates for this.# Ordinarily, arterial blood has a pH of about 7. 41, and as the blood acquires carbon dioxide in the tissue capillaries, the pH falls to a venous value of about 7. 37. In other words, a pH change of 0. 04 unit takes place. In heavy exercise or other conditions of high metabolic activity, or when blood flow through the tissues is sluggish, the decrease in pH in the tissue blood (and in the tissues themselves) can be as much as 0. 50, about 12 times.# Each hemoglobin (Hb) molecule has four subunits.# Each subunit has a mheme mojety with an iron in the ferrous state (Fe2+), and two a and two b polypeptide chains.# O2 capacity: maximal amount of O2 that can bind to Hb# O2 content*: Total O2 in blood (bound + dissolved)= (O2 capacity X % saturation) + dissolved O2= (1. 39 x Sat) + 0. 003 Po2100# Conetent reflects O2 bound to Hb (the amount of O2 that is dissolved is trivial compared to bound).# Partial pressure reflects dissolved O2, Shift to right (| P50).

The functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the volume of air that remains in the lungs at the end of each normal expiration, is important to lung function. Because its value changes markedly in some types of pulmonary disease, it is often desirable to measure this capacity. The spirometer cannot be used in a direct way to measure the functional residual capacity, because the air in the residual volume of the lungs cannot be expired into the spirometer, and this volume constitutes about one half of the functional residual capacity. To measure functional residual capacity, the spirometer must be used in an indirect manner, usually by means of a helium dilution method. LUNG VOLUMES Lung Volume. Definition. Normal value1.

Patients with diaphragmatic weakness can also present with this symptom. d. When they lie supine, gravity no longer exerts an effect on the diaphragm and abdominal contents and the patients have trouble getting their diaphragm to descend against the abdominal contents on inspiration. e. The presence of diaphragmatic weakness is confirmed by repeating her pulmonary function tests with her in the upright and supine positions.

Plasma proteins are effective buffers because both their free carboxyl and their free amino groups dissociate. The second buffer system is provided by the dissociation of the imidazole groups of the histidine residues in hemoglobin. In the pH 7. 0-7. 7 range, the free carboxyl and amino groups of hemoglobin contribute relatively little to its buffering capacity. However, the hemoglobin molecule contains 38 histidine residues, and on this basis--plus the fact that hemoglobin is present in large amounts--the hemoglobin in blood has six times the buffering capacity of the plasma proteins. In addition, the action of hemoglobin is unique because the imidazole groups of deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) dissociate less than those of oxyhemoglobin (Hb. O2), making Hb a weaker acid and therefore a better buffer than HBO. Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology Twenty-Third Edition Page no: 614",

This is called the Bohr effect. 2, 3 - DPG: In hypoxic conditions that last longer than a few hours, the quantity of 2, 3-BPG in the blood increases considerably, shifting the oxygen-hemoglobin curve to the right. This causes oxygen to be released to tissues. Low PO2 and high PCO2 in tissues: As blood passes through tissues, CO2 diffuses from the cells to blood. This increases blood PCO2 and decreases blood PO2. This, in turn, increases blood carbonic acid and hydrogen ion concentration. These effects shift the oxygen dissociation curve to the right, forcing oxygen away from hemoglobin, delivering oxygen to the tissues.

They initially breathed 2. 5% CO2 in oxygen for 75 breaths. Ventilatory parameters of the last 10 breaths were used as controls. In 7 subsequent test sessions each lasting 2 min alternating with 2 min free breathing periods, subjects tried to achieve a target ventilation ranging from 0. 7 to 1. 3 times the control with a visual feedback system. End-tidal CO2 was regulated automatically at the control level by changing the inspired CO2. Breathing discomfo was measured at the end of each session using a visual analog scale. Isocapnic constraining of ventilation (0. 7 times the control) during exercise significantly increased respiratory discomfo (p < 0. 05). Increases in ventilation had no significant effect. These results indicate that respiratory discomfo during exercise is exaggerated when the level of ventilation falls below that spontaneously adopted even when chemical drives are held constant.

        "question": "Oxygen toxicity causes all except",
        "exp": "It is interesting that while O2 is necessary for life in aerobic organisms, it is also toxic. Indeed, 100% O2 has been demonstrated to exe toxic effects not only in animals but also in bacteria, fungi, cultured animal cells, and plants. The toxicity seems to be due to the production of reactive oxygen species including superoxide anion (O2 -) and H2. O2. When 80-100% O2 is administered to humans for periods of 8 h or more, the respiratory passages become irritated, causing substernal distress, nasal congestion, sore throat, and coughing. Some infants treated with O2 for respiratory distress syndrome develop a chronic condition characterized by lung cysts and densities (bronchopulmonary dysplasia). This syndrome may be a manifestation of O2 toxicity. Another complication in these infants is retinopathy of prematurity (retrolental fibroplasia), the formation of opaque vascular tissue in the eyes, which can lead to serious visual defects. The retinal receptors mature from the center to the periphery of the retina, and they use considerable O2. This causes the retina to become vascularized in an orderly fashion. Oxygen treatment before maturation is complete provides the needed O2 to the photoreceptors, and consequently, the normal vascular pattern fails to develop. Evidence indicates that this condition can be prevented or ameliorated by treatment with vitamin E, which exes an antioxidant effect, and, in animals, by growth hormone inhibitors. Administration of 100% O2 at increased pressure accelerates the onset of O2 toxicity, with the production not only of tracheobronchial irritation but also of muscle twitching, ringing in the ears, dizziness, convulsions, and coma. The speed with which these symptoms develop is propoional to the pressure at which the O2 is administered; for example, at 4 atmospheres, symptoms develop in half the subjects in 30 min, whereas at 6 atmospheres, convulsions develop in a few minutes.

        "exp": "Ans. (C) Minimal value(Ref: Ganongs Review of Medical Physiology 25th ed; pg. 629). If the lung elastic recoil (collapsing force) is not opposed by the chest wall recoil (expanding force), the lung will collapse to minimal lung volume (which is lower than residual volume). Chest wall was removed means, lung outside pressure is ATM Pressure (O mm Hg), not the negative intrapleural pressure. So the condition is pneumothorax, like causing collapse of lung. Basic Concept. If air is introduced into the intrapleural space (pneumothorax), the intrapleural pressure becomes equal to atmospheric pressure. Without the normal negative intrapleural pressure, the lungs will collapse (their natural tendency) and the chest wall will spring outward (its natural tendency). Collapse does not mean Zero volume, because medium size airway collapses before full alveolar collapses lading to small amount of air lung (generally 10% of TLC). Elastic Recoil and Compliance. Elastic recoil is defined as the ability of stretched or inflated lung to return to its resting volume (FRC). Elastic recoil of the lung is directly related to lung stiffness, that is, the stiffer the lung, the greater is the elastic recoil (but lower compliance). The lung volume at which elastic recoil of lung and elastic recoil of chest wall are at equilibrium (i. e. equal elastic recoil force but in opposite directions) is represented by FRC. Because the lung and chest walls are recoiling equally but, in opposite directions at FRC, FRC is often referred to as the resting volume of the lungs. A change in the elastic properties of either the lungs or chest wall has a significant effect on FRC. For example, if the elastic recoil of the lung is increased (i. e. lower compliance). A new equilibrium is established between the lungs and chest wall, resulting in a decreased FRC. Conversely, if the elastic recoil of chest wall is increased, FRC is higher than normal. The elastic recoil of the chest wall at low lung volumes is a major determinant of RV in young peoples. The elastic recoil of the chest wall is such that if the chest were unopposed by the recoil of the lung, it would expand to about 70% of TLC. This volume represents the resting position of the chest wall unopposed by the lung. If the chest wall is mechanically expanded beyond its resting position, it recoils inward. At volumes <70% of TLC, the recoil of the chest wall is directed outward and is opposite to the elastic recoil of the lung. The outward elastic recoil of the chest wall is greatest at RV, whereas the inward elastic recoil of the lung is greatest at TLC.",

From plasma, the CO2 enters the RBCs. In the RBCs, CO2 combines with water to form carbonic acid. The reaction inside RBCs is very rapid. The rapid formation of carbonic acid inside the RBCs is due to the presence of an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase. This enzyme accelerates the reaction, carbonic anhydrase is present only inside the RBCs and not in plasma. This is why the carbonic acid formation is at least 200 to 300 times more in the RBCs than in plasma. The carbonic acid is very unstable. Almost all carbonic acid (99. 9%) formed in red- blood corpuscles dissociates into bicarbonates and hydrogen ions. The concentration of bicarbonates ions in the cell increases more and more.

S) (667-68-GN) (611- Ganong 23rd)* The decrease in O2 affinity of hemoglobin when the pH of blood falls is called the Bohr effect and is closely related to the fact that deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyhemoglobin) binds H+ more actively than does oxyhemoglobin. The pH of blood falls as its CO2 content increases, so that when the PCO2 rises, the curve shifted to the right and the P50 rises.* Combination of more amount of oxygen with hemoglobin displaces CO2 from hemoglobin. This effect is called Haldane effect. So the excess of oxygen content in blood causes shift to the CO2 dissociation curve to the right.* Oxygen Debt - After a period of severe muscular exercise, the amount of O2 consumed is enormously more. The oxygen required is more than the quantity available to the muscle. This much of oxygfen is required not only for the activity of the muscle but also for reversal of some metabolic processes such as1. Reformation of glucose from lactic acid accumulated during exercise2. Resynthesis of ATP and creatine phosphate3. Restoration of amount of oxygen dissociation from hemoglobin and myoglobin. Thus, for the above reversal phenomena, an extra amount of oxygen must be made available in the body after the severe muscular exercise. This is called oxygen-debt. The oxygen debt is about six times more than the amount of oxygen consumed under resting conditions. VO2-Max - The amount of oxygen consumed under maximal aerobic metabolism is called VO2 max.

O2 levels of blood is normal in case of cyanide poisoning the sensors in carotid and aoic bodies are not able to sense oxygen in blood because of blockade of cellular respiration and hence, they go in for hypoxic state and gets stimulated. Option A: Acidosis (Increased H+ ions) stimulates peripheral chemoreceptors. Option B: Increased p. CO2 mainly stimulates central chemoreceptors. Option C: The peripheral chemoreceptors have an enormous bloodflow per unit tissue (2000mL/100g of tissue/min) because of which the O2 needs of the cells can be met by dissolved O2. Therefore, Carbonmonoxide poisoning doesnot stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors because the amount of dissolved O2 is generally normal, even though the combined O2 in the blood is markedly decreased.

        "question": "During normal quite breathing, maximum work is done in which of the following?",
        "exp": "Ans. a. To overcome chest and lung elastic recoil. (Ref. Guyton & Hall's Textbook of Medical Physiology 1 l, h/pg. 471; Fig. 37-1). During normal quiet breathing, all respiratory muscle contraction occurs during inspiration; expiration is almost entirely a passive process caused by elastic recoil of the lungs and chest cage. Thus, under resting conditions, the respiratory muscles normally perform \"work\" to cause inspiration but not to cause expiration. The work of inspiration can be divided into three fractions:(1) that required to expand the lungs against the lung and chest elastic forces, called compliance work or elastic work;(2) that required to overcome the viscosity of the lung and chest wall structures, called tissue resistance work; and(3) that required to overcome airway resistance to movement of air into the lungs, called airway resistance work. Mechanics of Pulmonary Ventilation. Muscles That Cause Lung Expansion and Contraction. The lungs can be expanded and contracted in two ways: (1) by downward and upward movement of the diaphragm to lengthen or shorten the chest cavity, and (2) by elevation and depression of the ribs to increase and decrease the anteroposterior diameter of the chest cavity. Normal quiet breathing is accomplished almost entirely by the first method, that is, by movement of the diaphragm. During inspiration, contraction of the diaphragm pulls the lower surfaces of the lungs downward. Then, during expiration, the diaphragm simply relaxes, and the elastic recoil of the lungs, chest wall, and abdominal structures compresses the lungs and expels the air. During heavy breathing, All the muscles that elevate the chest cage are classified as muscles of inspiration, and those muscles that depress the chest cage are classified as muscles of expiration. The most important muscles that raise the rib cage are the external intercostals, but others that help are the (1) sternocleidomastoid muscles, which lift upward on the sternum; (2) anterior serrati, which lift many of the ribs; and (3) scaleni, which lift the first two ribs. The muscles that pull the rib cage downward during expiration are mainly the (1) abdominal recti, which have the powerful effect of pulling downward on the lower ribs at the same time that they and other abdominal muscles also compress the abdominal contents upward against the diaphragm, and (2) internal intercostals.",

In oxygen poisoning, the central nervous system condition was called the Paul Bert effect, and the pulmonary condition the Lorrain Smith effect. Normobaric conditions. Oxygen content = oxygen carried by hemoglobin + oxygen dissolved in plasma. Arteria oxygen content = 1. 34 (hemoglobin) (%saturation) + 0. 003 (Pa.

Arterial oxygen content = 1. 34 (15) (100%) + 0. 003 (2200)= 20. 1+ 6. 6 vol%Inhalation of 100% oxygen yields a fivefold to sevenfold increase in arterial blood oxygen tension at normal atmospheric pressure and may reach values close to 2000 mm. Hg during hyperbaric exposure to oxygen at 0. 3 MPa (three ATA). At one ATA* of pressure (the standard air pressure or sea level), the partial pressure of oxygen in alveolar air amounts to about 673 mm of mercury (mm. Hg). However, when a person is placed in a hyperbaric chamber and delivered pure oxygen 3 ATA or 2280 mm. Hg the alveolar oxygen pressure increases to 2193 mm. Hg. Theoretically, arterial and tissue oxygen pressure closely follow alveolar oxygen pressure. This is dramatic increase in the amount of oxygen going into the blood. When the body is at rest, it normally consumes about 6 ml of oxygen per 100 ml of blood, but of this amount only 0. 3 ml is transported by the hemoglobin in the red blood cells. When the hyperbaric pressure is raised to 2 ATA of pure hyperbaric oxygen therapy. At 3 ATA approximately 6. 4 volumes per cent of oxygen are physically dissolved in the plasma, which is sufficient to sustain life even in the absence of hemoglobin. Exposure to 100% O2 at 2 - 3 atm can increased dissolved O2 in arterial blood to the point that arterial O2 tension is greater than 2000 mg. Hg and tissue 02 tension is 400 mm. Hg (654- Ganong 244). HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY (Inhalation of 100% pure O2 at high barometric pressure). The oxygen is usually administered at PO2s of 2 to 3 atmosphere of pressure through a mask or intratracheal tube, whereas the gas around the body is normal air compressed to the same high pressure.

The two most important acquired hemoglobinopathies are carbon monoxide poisoning and methemoglobinemia. CO has a higher affinity for hemoglobin than does oxygen; it can replace oxygen and diminish O2 delivery. Chronic elevation of carboxyhemoglobin levels to 10 or 15%, as occurs in smokers, can lead to secondary polycythemia. Carboxyhemoglobin is cherry red in color and masks the development of cyanosis usually associated with poor O2 delivery to tissues. HEMOGLOBIN# Hemoglobin is composed of four polypeptide subunits (2 alpha, 2 beta) and exists in two forms--T (taut) form has low affinity for oxygen and R (released) form has high affinity for oxygen.# Hemoglobin exhibits positive cooperativity and negative allostery (accounts for the sigmoid-shaped 02 dissociation curve for hemoglobin), unlike myoglobin.# Carbon monoxide has a 257 times greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen.# Oxygen dissociation curve of Hb is sigmoid in shape indicating that subunits co-operate in binding oxygen, which results from the fact that binding of oxygen molecule at one heme increases the oxygen affinity or remaining heme groups in the same Hb molecule. The net effects that the affinity of Hb for last oxygen bound is approximately 300-fold greater than affinity of first oxygen bound.# 2-3 BPG is essential for normal transport function of Hb, e. g., storing blood in acid citrate dextrose (formerly used medium) leads to decreased 2, 3 BPG in RBCs and such blood displays an abnormally high oxygen affinity, acting virtually as an oxygen \"trap\" rather than oxygen transport system, failing to unload properly its bound oxygen in tissues. However, decrease in 2-3 BPG can be prevented by adding Inosine to storage medium as it can enter RBC where it is converted to 2, 3 BPG. Hb.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Mean BP * Central chemoreceptors are located in a chemosensitive area on the ventral surface of the medulla near the exit of the ninth and tenth cranial nerves. The primary stimulus for the central chemoreceptors is an increase in the hydrogen ion concentration. Stimulation of central chemoreceptors by increased hydrogen ion concentration leads to excitation of the respiratory neurons, thereby producing an increase in the rate and depth of respiration.* Although the primary stimulus for central chemoreceptors is an increase in hydrogen ion concentration, in actual practice the physiological stimulus is an increase in PCO2. The reason is that hydrogen ions cannot cross blood - brain barrier. Therefore, a change in the blood hydrogen ion concentration does not change the hydrogen ion concentration in the immediate vicinity of the chemosensitive neurons (i. e., in CSF and brain interstitial fluid). On the other hand, CO2 being lipid soluble can easily cross blood brain barrier. It enters the brain, where it is hydrated to give rise to H+ and HCO2 ions. Now these H+ directly stimulate the central chemoreceptors.* Thus, central chemoreceptors are directly stimulated by an increase in H+ concentration in CSF and brain inerstitial tissue, which is brought about by change in arterial PCO2 (Pa. CO2).* Change in CSF & Brain interstial tissue - | H+ concentration (Primary direct stimulus).* Change in Blood - | PCO2 (Actual physiological stimulus).* Central chemoreceptors are not stimulated by hypoxia; rather like any other cells, they are depressed by hypoxia. Peripheral chemoreceptors* The peripheral chemoreceptors which regulate respiration are located in the carotid body and aortic bodies. These bodies are located in the connective tissue associated with the vessel wall, at the bifurcation of the common carotid, and on the arch of aorta, respectively. The characteristic cells of both these structures are called glomus cells. Type I glomus cells have a high dopamine content, which they possibly employ as a neurotransmetter. Peripheral chemoreceptors convey information to the DRG of neurons in medulla, for which purpose the afferent neurons from the carotid bodies pass through glossopharyngeal nerve and from the aortic bodies pass through vagus nerve.* The most potent natural stimulus for peripheral chemoreceptors is low arterial PO2 (hypoxic hypoxia). The other stimuli which activate peripheral chemoreceptors are high arterial PCO2, and an increase in arterial hydrogen ion concentration (acidosis or low pH). The response to activation of peripheral chemoreceptors is an increase in pulmonary ventilation through an increase in the rate and depth of breathing.* It is good to keep in mind that stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors not only stimulates medullary respiratory centers but also medullary vasomotor center. Therefore, the response to their stimulation is tachycardia, vasoconstriction and increase BP, along with hyperventilation.",

There are no attachments between the lung and the walls of the chest cage except where it is suspended at its hilum from the mediastinum. Instead, the lung literally floats in the thoracic cavity. Fuhermore, continual suction of excessive fluid into lymphatic channels maintain a slight suction between the visceral surface of the lung pleura and the parietal pleural surface of the thoracic cavity. Therefore, the lungs are held to the thoracic wall as if glued there, except that they can slide freely, well lubricated as the chest expands and contracts. A concept from Boron&; s physiology/2nd Ed/ 630 The interaction between lungs and chest wall does not occur by direct attachment but through the intrapleural space between the visceral and parietal pleurae. This space is filled with a small amount of pleural fluid and is extremely thin (5 to 30 micrometer). Because the lungs and chest wall pull away from each other on opposite sides of the intrapleural space, the intrapleural pressure (PIP) is less than barometric pressure (PB); that is; the intrapleural space is a relative vacuum. Although the designation P implies that we are referring exclusively to the intrapleural space, this description is not entirely accurate. Indeed, in addition to the intrapleural space, PIP is probably similar to the pressure in several other regions of the chest cavity.

Surfactant is a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins (Table 35-2). If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. In spherical structures like the alveoli, the distending pressure equals two times the tension divided by the radius (P = 2T/r); if T is not reduced as r is reduced, the tension overcomes the distending pressure. Surfactant also helps to prevent pulmonary edema. It has been calculated that if it were not present, the unopposed surface tension in the alveoli would produce a 20 mm Hg force oring transudation of fluid from the blood into the alveoli.

Lung compliance is an index of lung distensibility or the ease with which the lungs are expanded; thus, compliance is the inverse of elastic recoil. Compliance is defined as the ratio of change of lung volume to the change in pressure required to inflate the lung (dV/dP). Compliance decreases in patients with pulmonary edema or surfactant deficiency and increases when there is a loss of elastic fibers in the lungs, such as occurs in patients with emphysema and with aging. MECHANICS OF BREATHING - Compliance of the lungs & chest wall# Curve of airway pressure plotted against volume, is relaxation pressure curve of the total respiratory system.# The pressure is zero at a lung volume that corresponds to the volume of gas in the lungs at the end of quiet expiration (relaxation volume, which equals the functional residual capacity).# It is positive at greater volumes and negative at smaller volumes. The change in lung volume per unit change in the airway pressure (DV/DP) is the stretchability (compliance) of the lungs and chest wall. Q# It is normally measured in the pressure range where the relaxation pressure curve is steepest, and the normal value is approximately 0. 2 L/cm H2O.# The curve is shifted downward and to the right (compliance is decreased) by pulmonary congestion and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis; pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disease of unknown cause in which there is stiffening and scarring of the lung.# The curve is shifted upward and to the left (compliance is increased) in emphysema.# It should be noted that compliance is a static measure of lung and chest recoil.# Two major forces contribute to lung compliance: o tissue elastic forces ando surface tension forces.

        "exp": "Ans. D. Consists of 3 types of unique proteins in it. Surfactant. The low surface tension when the alveoli are small is due to the presence in the fluid lining the alveoli of surfactant, a lipid surface-tension-lowering agent. Surfactant is a mixture of Di palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. In spherical structures like the alveoli, the distending pressure equals two times the tension divided by the radius (P=2T/r); if T is not reduced as r is reduced, the tension overcomes the distending pressure. Surfactant also helps to prevent pulmonary edema. It has been calculated that if it were not present, the unopposed surface tension in the alveoli would produce a 20 mm Hg force favouring transudation of fluid from the blood into the alveoli. Approximate Composition of Surfactant. Component. Percentage Composition. Dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine62. Phosphatidylglycerol5. Other phospholipids10. Neutral lipids13. Proteins8. Carbohydrate2. Surfactant is produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells Typical lamellar bodies, membrane-bound organelles containing whorls of phospholipid, are formed in these cells and secreted into the alveolar lumen by exocytosis. Tubes of lipid called tubular myelin form from the extruded bodies, and the tubular myelin in turn forms the phospholipid film. Following secretion, the phospholipids of surfactant line up in the alveoli with their hydrophobic fatty acid tails facing the alveolar lumen. Surface tension is inversely proportional to their concentration per unit area. The surfactant molecules move further apart as the alveoli enlarge during inspiration, and surface tension increases, whereas it decreases when they move closer together during expiration. Some of the protein-lipid complexes in surfactant are taken up by endocytosis in type II alveolar cells and recycled. Formation of the phospholipid film is greatly facilitated by the proteins in surfactant. This material contains four unique proteins: surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D. SP-A is a large glycoprotein and has a collagen-like domain within its structure. It has multiple functions, including regulation of the feedback uptake of surfactant by the type II alveolar epithelial cells that secrete it. SP-B and SP-C are smaller proteins, which facilitate formation of the monomolecular film of phospholipid. A mutation of the gene for SP-C has been reported to be associated with familial interstitial lung disease. Like SP-A, SP-D is a glycoprotein. Its full function is uncertain. However, SP-A and SP-D are members of the collecting family of proteins that are involved in innate immunity in the conducting airway as well as in the alveoli.",

In healthy subjects, this occurs at the end of quiet expiration, i. e., at functional residual capacity. Therefore, in healthy adults at rest FRC is essentially equal to relaxation volume of respiratory system and FRC is usually treated as synonymous with relaxation volume.* However, in real sense FRC and relaxation volume are not synonymous terms and, while the two volumes are some times equal, more often they are not, i. e., active or passive mechanisms often operate to make FRC different from relaxation volume. For example, neonates have a more compliant (less stiff) chest wall. The chest wall thus has less elastic recoil to balance that of lung, thus decreasing the relaxation volume of lung.

It is characterized by headache, irritability, insomnia, breathlessness, and nausea and vomiting. Its cause is unsettled, but it appears to be associated with cerebral edema. The low PO2 at high altitude causes aeriolar dilation, and if cerebral autoregulation does not compensate, there is an increase in capillary pressure that ors increased transudation of fluid into brain tissue. Individuals who do not develop mountain sickness have a diuresis at high altitude, and urine volume is decreased in individuals who develop the condition. High-altitude illness includes not only mountain sickness but also two more serious syndromes that complicate it: high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. In high-altitude cerebral edema, the capillary leakage in mountain sickness progresses to frank brain swelling, with ataxia, disorientation, and in some cases coma and death due to herniation of the brain through the tentorium. High-altitude pulmonary edema is a patchy edema of the lungs that is related to the marked pulmonary hypertension that develops at high altitude. It has been argued that it occurs because not all pulmonary aeries have enough smooth muscle to constrict in response to hypoxia, and in the capillaries supplied by those aeries, the general rise in pulmonary aerial pressure causes a capillary pressure increase that disrupts their walls (stress failure).

The compliance of the combined lungthorax system is almost exactly one half that of the lungs alone-- 110 milliliters of volume per centimeter of water pressure. Types of compliance measurements: Static compliance: This is the measurement made without taking into account the effect of the different phases of respiration. Dynamic compliance: Compliance measurement during the difference phases of respiratory. So it's a measure of static compliance (lungs and chest wall stiffness) plus airway resistance = impedance of lung Specific compliance = Compliance/FRC Reduced compliance is caused by: Increased fibrous tissue in the lung (pulmonary fibrosis) Decreased surfactant or increased surface tension Presence of air (pneumothorax), excess fluid (pleural effusion), or blood (hemothorax) in the intrapleural space Alveolar edema, which prevents the inflation of some alveoli Atelectasis (collapse) Increased pulmonary venous pressure a lung becomes engorged with blood An increased compliance occurs in pulmonary emphysema normal aging lung In both instances, an alteration in the elastic tissue in the lung is probably responsible. Aging cause changes in the structure of lung collagen and elastin rather than changes in the amount or propoion of the two molecules. In emphysema, the alveolar septal tissue that normally opposes lung expansion are destroyed. Increased compliance also occurs during an asthma, but the reason is unclear.",
