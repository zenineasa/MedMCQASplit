O2 and low Pa. CO2. o On the other hand, at the base of lung perfusion is better than ventilation; Hence Pa. O2 and Pa. CO2 of basal alveoli are quiet close to those of pulmonary artery, i. e., low PaO, and high Pa.

        "exp": "Ans. is 6b' i. e., 150 mlo In healthy individuals, physiological (total) dead space is equal to anatomica dead space, which is about 150 ml. Anatomical dead spaceo When air is breathed in, only the air that reaches the alveoli participates in gas exchange. The air in the airways (Trachea, bronchi) is breathed out unchanged as air in them does not participate in gaseous diffusion. Hence the airway space behaves as functionally dead so far as gas exhange is concerned. This is called 'anatomical dead space'. The volume of this space is 150 ml. That means only the first 350 ml of the 500 ml inspired with each breath (tidal volume) at rest mixes with the air in the alveoli. Conversely, with each expiration, the first 150 ml expired is gas that occupied the dead space, and only the last 350 ml is gas from the alveoli. So, normally dead space (Vd): tidal volume (Vt) ratio is 0[?]30 (150: 500). Physiological dead space (total dead space)o Normally, 350 ml of air enters the alveoli, with each breath. However, not all the air that enters the alveoli necessarily participates in alveolar gas exchange. In disease states, no diffusion (exchange) may take place between the gas in some of the alveoli and blood, and some of the alveoli may be overventilated. Such spaces in the alveoli constitues 'alveolar' dead space. The sum of anatomical dead space and alveolar dead space is called the 'physiological' dead space. Hence, the physiological dead space is the volume of inspired air, in airways (anatomical dead space) and in the alveoli (alveolar dead space), that does not participate in gaseous exchange. In healthy individuals, anatomical dead space and physiological dead space are identical because all the air entering into the alveoli participates in gaseous exchange (as alveolar diffusion, ventilation and perfusion are normal in healthy individuals).",

This air is called dead space air because it is not useful for gas exchange. TOTAL DEAD SPACE (also known as \"PHYSIOLOGICAL\" DEAD SPACE) can be divided into anatomical dead space and alveolar dead space. ANATOMICAL DEAD SPACEAnatomical dead space is the gas in the conducting areas of the respiratory system, such as the mouth and trachea, where air does not come into contact with the alveoli of the lungs. Birds, which, relatively, have a far longer and wider trachea than mammals, have a higher proportion of dead space. It is normally equal in milliliters to your body weight in pounds. A150 lb (68 kg) male would have an anatomical dead space of about 150 mL (1 mL per lb or 2. 2 mL per kilogram of body weight). This is the same conversion of kilograms to pounds, except the final unit is in mL. This is about a third of the resting tidal volume (450-500 mL). Anatomic dead space is the volume of the conducting airways. It may be measured by Fowler's method, a nitrogen washout technique. ALVEOLAR DEAD SPACEAlveolar dead space is caused by air contacting alveoli without blood flow in their adjacent pulmonary capillaries, i. e. ventilation without perfusion. As a result, no gas exchange can occur. Alveolar dead space is negligible in healthy individuals, but can increase dramatically in some lung diseases",

Breaks the structure of water in the alveoli The water molecules on the surface of water (at air-water interphase) have an especially strong attraction for one another. This results in the water surface to contract producing surface tension. Thus the water molecules lining the alveoli produce an elastic contractile force due to surface tension which causes the alveoli to collapse. This surface tension force of water molecules is broken by surfactant (a mixture of phospholipids, proteins and ions, most important phospholipid of which is dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-choline-DPCC). It is secreted by type II alveolar epithelial cells and lines the alveoli. The phospholipid molecules have a hydrophilic head and two parallel hydrophobic 'tails'. Thus only head part of the molecule dissolves in the fluid lining the alveolar surface and the hydrophobic tails face the alveolar lumen. This new surface thus formed of the surfactant has a significantly reduced surface tension than the water molecules. By reducing the surface tension, surfactant serves two purposes: Prevents the alveoli from collapsing. Prevents pulmonary edema.",
