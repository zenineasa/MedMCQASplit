        "exp": "Ans. is 6b' i.e., 150 mlo In healthy individuals, physiological (total) dead space is equal to anatomica dead space, which is about 150 ml.Anatomical dead spaceo When air is breathed in, only the air that reaches the alveoli participates in gas exchange. The air in the airways (Trachea, bronchi) is breathed out unchanged as air in them does not participate in gaseous diffusion. Hence the airway space behaves as functionally dead so far as gas exhange is concerned. This is called 'anatomical dead space'. The volume of this space is 150 ml. That means only the first 350 ml of the 500 ml inspired with each breath (tidal volume) at rest mixes with the air in the alveoli. Conversely, with each expiration, the first 150 ml expired is gas that occupied the dead space, and only the last 350 ml is gas from the alveoli. So, normally dead space (Vd): tidal volume (Vt) ratio is 0[?]30 (150 : 500).Physiological dead space (total dead space)o Normally, 350 ml of air enters the alveoli, with each breath. However, not all the air that enters the alveoli necessarily participates in alveolar gas exchange. In disease states, no diffusion (exchange) may take place between the gas in some of the alveoli and blood, and some of the alveoli may be overventilated. Such spaces in the alveoli constitues 'alveolar' dead space. The sum of anatomical dead space and alveolar dead space is called the 'physiological' dead space. Hence, the physiological dead space is the volume of inspired air, in airways (anatomical dead space) and in the alveoli (alveolar dead space), that does not participate in gaseous exchange. In healthy individuals, anatomical dead space and physiological dead space are identical because all the air entering into the alveoli participates in gaseous exchange (as alveolar diffusion, ventilation and perfusion are normal in healthy individuals).",

This results in the water surface to contract producing surface tension.Thus the water molecules lining the alveoli produce an elastic contractile force due to surface tension which causes the alveoli to collapse.This surface tension force of water molecules is broken by surfactant (a mixture of phospholipids, proteins and ions, most important phospholipid of which is dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-choline-DPCC). It is secreted by type II alveolar epithelial cells and lines the alveoli.The phospholipid molecules have a hydrophilic head and two parallel hydrophobic 'tails'. Thus only head part of the molecule dissolves in the fluid lining the alveolar surface and the hydrophobic tails face the alveolar lumen. This new surface thus formed of the surfactant has a significantly reduced surface tension than the water molecules.By reducing the surface tension, surfactant serves two purposes:Prevents the alveoli from collapsingPrevents pulmonary edema.",
