        "question": "A 38-year-old female presents to the physician with complaints of excessive thirst and urination for the past 4 weeks. Her appetite has been normal and she has not had diarrhea. Blood chemistry showed mildly elevated glucose and glucagon. Physical examination reveals tenderness in the left upper quadrant and an erythematous necrotizing skin eruption on her legs. Radiographic studies show a tumor in the pancreas. Which of the following cells is responsible for this lesion?",
        "exp": "The symptoms described are typical for a patient with glucagon excess. Glucagon is secreted by alpha cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Increased levels are rare, usually due to carcinoma (70%) or adenoma (30%) of the islets. Two-thirds of patients with carcinoma have liver metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Increased glucagon causes a syndrome similar to diabetes mellitus, due to antagonism of insulin effects. Patients also have migratory skin rashes, alopecia, hyperpigmentation of the skin, and glossitis. Diagnosis is made by measuring glucagon. The acinar cell, the main exocrine cell of the pancreas, contains digestive enzymes. Increases in the release of these enzymes (especially amylase and lipase) occur with pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is considered an emergent medical condition. Chronic pancreatitis is associated with fibrosis and atrophy of the acinar structures. Beta cells are responsible for insulin release. An adenoma of beta cells (insulinoma) would cause hyperinsulinism. 70% are solitary and 10% are multiple. Insulinomas cause hypoglycemia, dizziness, confusion, and excessive sweating. Glucose needs to be given promptly to avoid coma and death. Diagnosis is made by finding increased insulin and hypoglycemia. Delta cells are islet cells that secrete somatostatin. Tumors producing increased somatostatin are usually malignant. Clinically, a diabetes mellitus-like syndrome occurs along with diarrhea. Diagnosis is made from elevated serum somatostatin levels, but can be difficult because of the hormone's sho half-life. Ref: Barrett K. E., Barman S. M., Boitano S., Brooks H. L. (2012). Chapter 24.

This is because both the thoracic cage and lungs are elastic structures; therefore, both tend to recoil, but in opposite direction. This creates negative intrapleural pressure. \"A negative force is always required on the outside of the lungs to keep the lungs expanded. This is provided by negative pressure in the normal pleural space. The basic cause of this negative pressure is pumping of fluid from the space by the lymphatics (which is also the basis of the negative pressure found in most tissue spaces of the body). \" - Guyton 12/e p 483 So, two impoant reasons of negative intrapleural pressure are:- i) Elasticity of lungs and thoracic cage in opposite direction. ii) Lymphatic drainage of pleural fluid.",

Because of the decrease in gastric acid secretion, luminal bacteria would most likely exhibit increased (not decreased) growth. One of the functions of HCl secreted by the parietal cells is to sterilize the gastric lumen. Patients with Type A gastritis have an increased likelihood of developing gastric carcinoma. A decrease in acid secretion leads to increased secretion of gastrin by antral G cells. This is because low gastric pH (less than 3) inhibits gastrin secretion paracrine release of somatostatin from cells in the gastric mucosa that can sense the acidity.

When air is breathed at high pressure (e. g., during a deep sea dive), increased amounts of gas (paicularly nitrogen) become dissolved in the blood and tissues. If the diver then ascends (depressurizes) too rapidly, the nitrogen expands in the tissues and bubbles out of solution in the blood to form gas emboli. Since bubbles can form in or migrate to any pa of the body, it can produce many symptoms, and its effects may vary from joint pain, ischemia in tissues to paralysis and death. The rapid formation of gas bubbles within skeletal muscles and suppoing tissues in and about joints is responsible for the painful condition called the bends. In the lungs, edema, hemorrhages, and focal atelectasis or emphysema may appear, leading to respiratory distress, the so-called chokes. Treatment of gas embolism requires placing the individual in a compression chamber where the barometric pressure may be raised, thus forcing the gas bubbles back into solution.

Gut (colonic) microflora synthesize sho chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by fermenting complex carbohydrate, resistant starches and other components of dietary fibers & mucin that escape digestion in upper git. They also produce vitamin K and biotin, detoxify xenobiotics, increase & maturate immunity,, preventing allergy and growth of pathogenic bacteria. They promote development of normal colonic epithelium and stimulate intestinal epithelial cell differentiation (ie increase not decrease proliferation of epithelial cells). Role of Colonic Microflora (Enteric Bacterial Ecosystem). Large intestine contains a unique biological ecosystem consisting of trillions of commensal (non pathogenic) bacteria that engage in a life long symbiotic relationship with their human host. This colonic ecosystem is established sholy after bih and remains remarkably stable unless disturbed by antibiotics. It is highly unusual relationship as other body compaments are largely sterile. It is involved in. Fermentation & Digestion of Complex Carbohydrate - Colonic bacteria metabolize meal components that are not digested by host enzymes and make their products available to the body fermentation. It provides advantage to the host in that the colonic bacteria are capable of performing metabolic reactions that do not take place in mammalian cells.- Carbohydrates that humans cannot digest without bacterial help include complex carbohydrate, resistant starches, dietary fibers, mucin (moucous) produced by gut and oligosaccharides / sugars that the body failed to digest /absorb d/t some pathology eg lactose in lactose intolerance. Formation of Sho Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)- Colonic bacteria form SCFAs by femanting carbohydrates (starches, fibers). SCFAs are 2-5 carbon weak acids with 80mmol/L average normal concentration in lumen. About 60% of this is acetate, 25% propionate and 15% butyrate.- SCFAs are absorbed & metabolized to make a significant contribution to total calory intake - butyrate is a critical energy source for colonocytes.- SCFAs exce a trophic effect on colonic epithelium cells. The colonic epithelium turns over rapidly even in health, limiting the genetic damage that might otherwise be caused by exposure to toxins in lumen. However, this also increases the risk of malignancy. The colonic flora ( SCFAs) is involved in promoting development of normal colonic epithelium and in stimulating its differentiated functions. Butyrate regulates the expression of specific gene in colonic epithelial cells and may suppress the development of a malignant phenotype. Expression of SMCT1 (sodium monocarboxylate transpoers 1) eg SLC5. A8 may be reduced in colon cancers, thereby reducing butyrate uptake - which may contribute to malignant transformation. So SCFAs increase the growth of intestinal epithelial cells and control their proliferation & differentiation (ie promoting normal development & stimulating differentiation)- SCFAs combat inflammation (prevent inflammatory bowel disease) maintain acid -base equilibrium (absorbed in pa by exchange for H+) and promote absorption of Na+, Mg++, Ca+ and Fe++Metabolism of Exogenous & Endogenous Substances- Gut flora forms secondary bile acids and deconjugate any bile acids that have escaped uptake in terminal ileum- Contribute to formation of intestinal gas. Detoxification- Detoxify xenobiotics (eg drugs) & dietary carcinogen (but may also generate toxic or carcinogenic compounds from dietary substrates. Antimicrobial- Gut flora limits the growth & invasion of pathogenic microorganisms by1) Functioning as a physical barrier to prevent attachment of pathogens. 2) Forming microbicidal substances, 3) Triggering gene expression in epithelium that counteracts the adverse effects of pathogens. Prevent Allergy & Provide Immunity- Gut flora is not essential for life as animals raised in germ free conditions apparently develop normally. However, in these animals the mucosal immunity is immature and intestinal epithelial cells differentiate more slowlyQ- Colonic microflora trains immune system preventing allergy & providing immunity.

As a person grows older, the percentage of total body weight that is fluid gradually decreases. This decrease is due in part to the fact that aging is usually associated with an increased percentage of the body weight being fat, which decreases the percentage of water in the body. Because women normally have a greater percentage of body fat compared with men, their total body water averages about 50 percent of the body weight. In premature and newborn babies, the total body water ranges from 70 to 75 percent of body weight. Therefore, when discussing \"average\" body fluid compartments, we should realize that variations exist, depending on age, gender, and percentage of body fat.

Closure of aoic valve Aoic pressure curve With the onset of rapid ejection phase of the ventricular systole, the aoic pressure rises steeply to reach a maximum of about 120 mm Hg. The ejection of blood into the aoa causes a stretch on the aoic walls and makes the blood in the entire aerial system to move at a faster rate. This sets up a pressure wave that travel along the aeries. The pressure wave expands the aerial wall as it travels, and expansion is palpable as the pulse. In the later pa of ventricular systole, the aoic pressure declines and continues to decline throughout the diastole, to reach a minimum of about 80 mm Hg during the isometric contraction of the next cardiac cycle. The elastic recoil of the aoa and the resistance of aerioles help to maintain relatively high aoic pressure during diastole. A notch (incisura or dicrotic notch) is rocorded in the early pa of down strok of the aoic pressure curve. It corresponds to the closure of aoic valve. It is produced by the sudden backward flow of aoic blood followed by the immediate cessation of backtlow due to closure of the aoic valves.",

From a functional point of view, the cerebellum is divided into three pas: The nodulus in the vermis and the flanking flocculus in the hemisphere on each side form the flocculonodular lobe, or vestibulocerebellum. This lobe, which is phylogenetically the oldest pa of the cerebellum, has vestibular connections and is concerned with equilibrium. The rest of the vermis and the adjacent medial poions of the hemispheres form the spinocerebellum, the region that receives proprioceptive input from the body as well as a copy of the \"motor plan\" from the motor coex. By comparing plan with performance, it smoothes and coordinates movements that are ongoing. The vermis projects to the brainstem area concerned with control of axial and proximal limb muscles, whereas the hemispheres project the brainstem areas concerned with control of distal limb muscles. The lateral poions of the cerebellar hemispheres are called the cerebrocerebellum, or neocerebellum. They are the newest from a phylogenetic point of view, reaching their greatest development in humans. They interact with the motor coex in planning and programming movements.",

Cirrhosis also causes excess fluid to accumulate in the peritoneal cavity as ascites. - In the case of ascites, the edema results not only from hypoalbuminemia, but also from portal vein obstruction (which increases capillary hydrostatic pressure) and the obstruction of lymphatic drainage of the liver.

Coicospinal tract is the most impoant tract through which the motor coex controls the activity of the ventral horn cells (a-motor neurons) in the spinal cord. It is also called pyramidal tract because they form the pyramid of the medulla. The coicospinal tract originates about 30 percent from primary motor coex, 30 percent from premotor areas (premotor coex & supplementary motor area) and 40% from the somatosensory area. So, there are 40% sensory fibers in the coicospinal tract. After leaving the coex, it passes through the posterior limb of internal capsule and then downward through the brainstem, forming the pyramids of medulla. The majority (80%) of the pyramidal fibers then cross the lower medulla to the opposite side and descend as the lateral coicospinal tract and finally terminating principally on the interneuron in the intermediate region of gray matter. Some also terminate directly on the a-motor neuron, especially those concerned with skilled movement. A few fibers (20%) do not cross to the opposite in the medulla and descend ipsilaterally as anterior (ventral) coicospinal tract. The most impressive fibers in the pyramidal tract are a population of large (16 pm) myelinated fibers which originate from Giant pyramidal cells, called Betz cells, that are found only in primary motor coex. These fibers transmit the nerve impulses to the spinal cord at fastest speed. However, these fibers form only 3% of the total. The other 97% are mainly fibers smaller than 4 m in diameter that conduct background tonic signals to the motor areas of the cord. Coricospinal tract is concerned with voluntary activities of body- Voluntary control of movement is absolutely dependent on the activity of coicospinal fibers.",

Two such tubes with fluid flowing through them in opposite directions provide an oppounity for the countercurrent multiplication. The thick ascending limb of loop of Henle is impermeable to water but it actively reabsorbs Na. CI. The thin descending limb of loop of Henle is relatively impermeable to solutes but highly permeable to water. The most impoant cause of the high medullary osmolarity is active transpo of sodiumQ and co-transpo of potassiumQ, chlorideQ and other ions out of the thick ascending limb of loop of HenleQ into the medullary interstitium. Most impoant among all these is Na. ClQ, for maintenance of high medullary interstitium. Consider the Na+ is continuously flowing in from glomerulus into the tubule. However, most of the Na+, instead of flowing out, gets trapped in a circular path and recycles between the ascending and descending limbs of the loop of Henle.

Erythropoietin is produced by interstitial cells in the peritubular capillary bed of the kidneys and by perivenous hepatocytes in the liver. It is also produced in the brain, where it exes a protective effect against excitotoxic damage triggered by hypoxia; and in the uterus and oviducts, where it is induced by estrogen and appears to mediate estrogen-dependent angiogenesis.",

Regulation of coronary flow occurs by two mechanisms:? 1) Chemical regulation (Autoregulation). Regulation of coronary blood flow occurs through local intrinsic regulation, i. e., autoregulation, most likely through the production of vasodilating metabolites in response to minimal degree of ischemia. The vasodilatory chemical stimuli are low PO2, High PCO2, H+, K+, lactic acid, ADP AMP and adenosine. Chemical regulation (autoregulation) of coronary blood flow is far more impoant than neural regulation. 2) Neural regulation. Coronary aeries are supplied by autonomic sympathetic and parasympathetic system. Coronary aeries have both alpha and beta sympathetic (adrenergic receptors), with the beta receptors predominating. Beta receptor stimulation produces vasodilation whereas alpha receptor stimulation produces vasoconstriction. There are relatively few parasympathetic (vagal) fibers supplying the coronary aeries. The direct effect of these fibers is vasodilatation; But indirect effect causes vasoconstriction and predominates. Indirect effect is the result of decrease in formation of vasodilator metabolites due to decrease in heart rate and cardiac contractility.",

        "exp": "Central chemoreceptors are stimulated mainly by the |H+ concentration caused by increased p. CO2 levels. Since H+ cannot easily cross the blood brain barrier, increase in the blood H+ concentration have little effect in stimulating central chemo receptors. Increase in blood p CO2 causes CO2 to diffuse the blood brain barrier with ease where it reacts with water to form carbonic acid. This carbonic acid in turn dissociates into H+ and bicarbonate ions. This H+ ions then have a potent stimulatory effect on the central chemo receptors. This question asks about the changes in blood that stimulates the central chemo receptors. So the correct answer is |p CO2 levels as H+ concentration in blood has little effect in stimulating the central chemo receptors. Ref: Textbook Of Medical Physiology By Khurana, Page 458",

In animal cells, the energy is provided almost exclusively by hydrolysis of ATP. One of these ATPases is sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na, K ATPase), which is also known as the Na, K pump. Na, K ATPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and uses the energy to extrude three Na+ from the cell and take two K+ into the cell for each molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. It is an electrogenic pump in that it moves three positive charges out of the cell for each two that it moves in, and it is therefore said to have a coupling ratio of 3: 2. Ref: Barrett K.

Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates follicular cells in female to promote the development of ovarian follicle and subsequent secretion of estrogen. In males, FSH stimulates the seoli cells of the testis and thereby promotes spermatogenesis. Leutinizing hormone (LH) stimulates the development of corpus luteum and the secretion of mainly progesterone and some estrogen by it. In males, LH stimulates the leyding cells (interstitial cells) to secrete testosterone. That is why LH is also called interstitial cell stimulating hormone (ICSH).",

Theca cells are stimulated by LH (theca cells express LH receptors prior to formation of the corpus luteum, choice D) to secrete the androgens androstenedione and testosterone. The androgens then diffuse into the granulosa cells, where they are aromatized to estrogens. Hence, theca cells express side-chain cleavage enzyme (first step in steroidogenesis) prior to the formation of the corpus luteum. FSH stimulates aromatase activity in the granulosa cells (receptors for FSH and aromatase enzyme are present prior to the formation of the corpus luteum, choices A and B). The granulosa cells apparently have the ability to produce steroids (progesterone), but lack 17a-hydroxylase activity and cannot synthesize estrogen themselves. Only as the follicle approaches ovulation do LH receptors begin to be expressed by the granulosa cells. Estrogen and FSH probably are responsible for the change. After ovulation, the scar of the follicle undergoes luteinization. The theca cells decrease 17a-hydroxylase activity and secrete more progesterone.

Key Concept: Cell divisions during spermatogenesis. During embryonic development, the primordial germ cells migrate to the testis, where they become spermatogonia. At puberty (usually 12 to 14 years after birth), the spermatogonia proliferate rapidly by mitosis. Some begin meiosis to become primary spermatocytes and continue through meiotic division I to become secondary spermatocytes. After completion of meiotic division II, the secondary spermatocytes produce spermatids, which differentiate to form spermatozoa.",

B: Transferrin Transferrin/siderophilin binds the iron in the lumen of GIT and most of the iron is transpoed bound to this globulin across the mucosal brush border Transferrin They are iron-binding blood plasma glycoproteins that control the level of free iron in biological fluids. In humans, it is encoded by the TF gene. Transferrin is a glycoprotein that binds iron very tightly but reversibly. Although iron bound to transferrin is less than 0. 1% (4 mg) of the total body iron, it is the most impoant iron pool, with the highest rate of turnover. Transferrin has a molecular weight of around 80 k. Da and contains 2 specific high-affinity Fe (III) binding sites. The affinity of transferrin for Fe (III) is extremely high but decreases progressively with decreasing pH below neutrality. When not bound to iron, it is known as \"apo-transferrin\" Ferritin It is a ubiquitous intracellular protein that stores iron and releases it in a controlled fashion. The amount of ferritin stored reflects the amount of iron stored. In humans, it acts as a buffer against iron deficiency and iron overload. Ferritin is a globular protein complex consisting of 24 protein subunits and is the primary intracellular iron-storage protein in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, keeping iron in a soluble and non-toxic form. Ferritin that is not combined with iron is called apoferritin.",

Alpha adrenergic stimulators (epinephrine and norepinephrine) inhibits insulin secretion. The condition in which sympathetic nervous system, including the sympatho-adrenal medullary system is activated are: fear, trauma, haemorhhage, fluid loss etc. Stressful stimuli stimulates secretion of growth hormone in humans. Stress hormones. They are coisol, GH and norepinephrine. They are released at periods of high stress. Stress hormones rise in the body during any neuroendocrine reaction such as surgery and they remain high as long as 72 hours, after which all these hormones return to their normal level, the last being coisol. Stress hormones act by mobilizing energy from storage to muscles, increasing heart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate and shutting down metabolic processes such as digestion, reproduction, growth and immunity. Stress response to surgery. It is characterized by increased secretion of pituitary hormones and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. The changes in pituitary secretion have secondary effects on hormone secretion from target organs. For example, release of coicotrophin from the pituitary stimulates coisol secretion from the adrenal coex. Arginine vasopressin is secreted from the posterior pituitary and has effects on the kidney. In the pancreas, glucagon is released and insulin secretion may be diminished. The overall metabolic effect of the hormonal changes is increased catabolism which mobilizes substrates to provide energy sources, and a mechanism to retain salt and water and maintain fluid volume and cardiovascular homeostasis.",

It is a mixture of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidycholine (dipalmitoyl-lecithin), phosphatidylglycerol, other phospholipids, neutral lipids, Surfactant proteins A, B, C and D (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D), and carbohydrates. Surfactant reduces the alveolar surface tension. This has three impoant physiological consequences:? 1) t reduces the collapsing tendency of lungs. 2) It reduces the natural tendency of the smaller alveoli to collapse and empty into the larger ones. This is called alveolar stabilization. 3) It reduces the tendency of the alveolar interstitial fluid to transudate out into the alveolar space. Dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (dipalmitoyl-lecithin) is the main surface tension lowering phospholipid in surfactant.",

        "question": "The mechanism of action of surfactant is?",
        "exp": "The low surface tension when the alveoli are small is due to the presence of surfactant in the fluid lining the alveoli. It is secreted by type II alveolar epithelial cells and lines the alveoli. Surfactant is a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins. If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. The water molecules lining the alveoli produce an elastic contractile force due to surface tension which causes the alveoli to collapse. This surface tension force of water molecules is broken by surfactant. In spherical structures like an alveolus, the distending pressure equals two times the tension divided by the radius (P = 2T/r); if T is not reduced as r is reduced, the tension overcomes the distending pressure. Surfactant also helps to prevent pulmonary edema. Ref: Barrett K. E., Barman S. M., Boitano S., Brooks H. L. (2012). Chapter 34. Introduction to Pulmonary Structure and Mechanics. In K. E.

        "exp": "A number of physiologic changes occur in a person living at high altitude. The diminished barometric pressure at high altitude causes alveolar hypoxia and aerial hypoxia. Pulmonary vasoconstriction occurs in response to alveolar hypoxia; therefore, the diameter of the pulmonary vessels would be greater in the brother living at sea level. All the other choices describe physiologic processes that would be enhanced by living at high altitude. Increased erythropoietin production, caused by aerial hypoxia, leads to increases in hematocrit in people living at high altitude. Mitochondrial density increases in people chronically exposed to the hypoxemia caused by living at high altitude. Increasing the rate of respiration is a very useful adaptation to the hypoxic conditions of high altitude. The primary stimulus is the hypoxic stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors.

Before Loewi's experiments, it was unclear whether signalling across the synapse was bioelectrical or chemical. Loewi's famous experiment, published in 1921, largely answered this question. He dissected out of frogs two beating heas: one with the vagus nerve which controls heart rate attached, the other heart on its own. Both heas were bathed in a saline solution (i. e. Ringer's solution). By electrically stimulating the vagus nerve, Loewi made the first heart beat slower. Then, Loewi took some of the liquid bathing the first heart and applied it to the second heart. The application of the liquid made the second heart also beat slower, proving that some soluble chemical released by the vagus nerve was controlling the heart rate. He called the unknown chemical Vagusstoff. It was later found that this chemical corresponded to Acetylcholine",

        "exp": "Stimulation of Gluconeogenesis: The best-known metabolic effect of cortisol and other glucocorticoids on metabolism is the ability to stimulate gluconeogenesis (i. e., the formation of carbohydrate from proteins and some other substances) by the liver, often increasing the rate of gluconeogenesis as much as 6 to 10fold. Cortisol Increases Liver and Plasma Proteins: Coincidentally with the effect of glucocorticoids to reduce proteins elsewhere in the body, the liver proteins are increased. Furthermore, the plasma proteins (which are produced by the liver and then released into the blood) are also increased. Mobilization of Fatty Acids: In much the same manner that cortisol promotes amino acid mobilization from muscle, it also promotes mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissue. Effect on Blood Cells and on Immunity in Infectious Diseases: Cortisol decreases the number of eosinophils and lymphocytes in the blood; this effect begins within a few minutes after the injection of cortisol and becomes marked within a few hours. Indeed, a finding of lymphocytopenia or eosinopenia is an important diagnostic criterion for overproduction of cortisol by the adrenal gland. Key Concept: Cortisol decreases circulating basophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes. All other cell count increases in cortisol treated person.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Vasoconstriction. When a small blood vessel is transected or damaged, the injury initiates a series of events that lead to the formation of a clot. This seals off the damaged region and prevents fuher blood loss. The initial event is constriction of the vessel. Physiological response to hemorrhage. It is a three-pa process. The principal features are:- Rapidly responding neural and humoral mechanisms direct available blood flow toward vital organs.- More slowly evolving salt and water retention by the kidneys replaces the lost plasma.- Erythropoiesis gradually replaces the lost red blood cells. Acute response to hemorrhage. The acute response includes a primary decrease in cardiac output, a secondary decrease in aerial pressure and compensatory increases in heart rate and vascular resistance. Autonomic involvement. Increased heart rate and peripheral vasoconstriction signal the autonomic nervous system's paicipation in the acute response to hemorrhage. Autonomic dysfunction decreases the body's tolerance to blood loss. Selective vasoconstriction. Sympathetic vasoconstriction during hemorrhage is selective. Many organs show intense vasoconstriction, while the cerebral and coronary circulations show little response to increased sympathetic outflow. The benefit of selectivity is that available blood flow, as meager as it may be, is preferentially directed to the brain and heart -- the vital organs. Suppo from Renin-Angiotensin system. The renin-angiotensin system suppos aerial pressure in hemorrhage by constricting nonvital organs. This response is slower than the response of the sympathetic nervous system, but it is still an impoant pa of the acute circulatory response to hemorrhage. Salt and water retention. After hemorrhage, with no intervention, salt and water retention over several days will increase blood volume to normal or above. Erythrocytes are replaced much more slowly.",

The carbohydrates are not essential nutrient, because the carbon skeletons of amino acids can be conveed into glucose by gluconeogenesis. However the absence of dietary carbohydrates lit ketone body production, protein degradation & gluconeogenesis. Recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for carbohydrate is set at 130 gm/day for adults & children, based on the amount of glucose used by carbohydrate dependent tissues, such as brain and RBC. Adults should consume 45-60% of their total calories from carbohydrate and added sugars represent no more than 25% of total energy. Very low carbohydrate diets, providing only 20 gm/day, but permitting unlimited consumption of fat and protein promote weight loss because of high energy (ATP) cost of gluconeogenesis. Since there is a continual demand for glucose, there will be a considerable amount of gluconegenesis from amino acids; the associated high ATP cost must then be met by oxidation of fatty acids.

A) Factors affecting stroke volume Stroke volume, which is the amount of blood pumped by the heart during one stroke, depends mainly on three factors:? Preload (Degree of ventricular filling during diastole): - Cardiac preload is represented by volume of venous blood that distends the ventricle, i. e., venous return determines the preload. An increase in preload, i. e., increase in venous return results in a higher end-diastolic volume (Preload). This results in stretching of myocardial fiber and this increase in length of myofibril increases the strength of cardiac contraction in accordance with the Frank-Starling law or Starling's law of the heart. According to Starling's law, greater the initial length of muscle fiber, greater is the force of contraction. The initial length of muscle fiber (length of fiber at the initiation of contraction/systole) refers to length of the fiber at the end of the diastole, i. e., end-diastolic fiber length. Thus, the factors which improve venous return increase the cardiac output by increasing end-diastolic ventricular volume and length, i. e., preload. Opposite is true for factors which decrease venous return.",

As a pa of renin - angiotensin-aldesterone system, lungs indirectly regulate sodium and water balance (and BP). However, lungs also directly affect Na+ balaneQ epithelial Na+ channels (E Na. Cs). Absorption of excess fluid from alveolar lumen and airways require active transepithelial transpo of Na+ by ENa. Cs (mainly of alveolar type 11 and possibly type I cells.)AR, cystic fibrosis disease is characterized by thick, tenacious and dehydrated airway secretions. In CF, mutations in CFTR (cystic fibrosis trans membrane conductance regulator), which is a regulated CI channel, causes decreased ability to secrete Cl and therefore enhance Na+ and water absorption out of airway.

        "exp": "Here, I would like to clarify some important facts which you must not be knowing and these have not given in our standard textbooks also. Once we hear the term \"non-shivering thermogenesis\" the idea immediately comes to our mind is that non-shivering thermogenesis means generation (production) of heat that is not due to shivering. This idea is not wrong, but the concept of non-shivering thermogenesis is slightly different. Shivering thermogenesis means when there is the production of heat inside the body and there is shivering also. This heat production due to the contractile activity of muscle (in shivering) and may be associated with heat production due to increased metabolism in other organs like liver -> whenever there is the production of heat with shivering (whether the heat production is due to shivering or other metabolic response), it is called shivering thermogenesis. In simple words, the production of heat (whatever the mechanism), which has to shiver with it is called shivering thermogenesis. On the other hand, when there is the production of heat without any shivering, it is called non-shivering thermogenesis. In humans, a neonate can adjust to cold exposure without any shivering, i. e. non-shivering thermogenesis. Whereas human adults always respond to cold with shivering, and there may be activation of another thermogenic mechanism also -> shivering thermogenesis. Now, you must be thinking that if we will wear many woollens than we will not have to shiver to the cold exposure. Yes, you are right, but in that case, we are preventing heat loss (conserving heat) but are not producing heat (no thermogenesis). If an adult man is suddenly exposed to cold, without wearing woollens or too many clothes, the response will always be shivering. On the other hand, neonate can generate heat without shivering. I think I was quite clear in my discussion and now you know what exact shivering thermogenesis and non-shivering thermogenesis mean. In human adult, there is no non-shivering thermogenesis as there is no brown fat in the adult:- \"As far as adult man is concerned, there is no evidence that non-shivering thermogenesis occurs\".- Energy metabolism in animal and man Whenever, wherever and in whichever, non-shivering thermogenesis occurs it is due to sympathetic stimulation (norepinephrine). In adults of lower species, non-shivering thermogenesis occurs in the liver, skeletal muscle and brown fat due to catecholamines (norepinephrine).",

Hormones involved in spermatogenesis Spermatogenesis is influenced by many hormones. Hormones required for spermatogenesis are FSH, LH, testosterone, estrogen, growth hormones inhibin and activin. FSH is responsible for initiation of spermatogenesis. It binds with seoli cells and spermatogonia and induces the proliferation of spermatogonia. It stimulates ceoli cells to secrete endrogen binding protein, inhibin, mullerian inhibing substance and estrogen. LH stimulates leydig cells to secrete testosterone. Testosterone is the principles hormone which directly stimulates spermatogenesis. It is responsible for the sequence of remaining stages of spermatogenesis (after initiatin by FSH). It is also responsible for maintenance of spermatogenesis. Estrogen is formed from testosterone (by aromatase) in seoli cells. It is essential for spermeogenesis (last step of spermatogenesis, i. e. formation of spermatozoa from spermatids). Growth hormone is essentialy promotes early division of spermatogonia. Inhibin plays an impoant role in regulation of spermatogenesis by feedback inhibition of FSH secretion. Activin stimulates FSH secretion and stimulates spermatogenesis.",

Acute left-sided heart failure gives rise to acute pulmonary edema, with extravasation of plasma and red blood cells into alveolar spaces. Acute right-sided heart failure leads to acute congestion of the liver, which does not acquire the typical nutmeg appearance as in chronic congestion. Alcohol toxicity leads to a number of hepatic alterations. Fatty change results from alteration in lipoprotein metabolism, leading to accumulation of fats as a large single droplet within the cytoplasm of hepatocytes (microvesicular steatosis). Alcoholic hepatitis is an acute response to alcohol abuse and is associated with hepatocyte necrosis and formation of Mallory bodies.

        "exp": "Ans. D: Contraction in extracellular fluid volume. The descending limb of the loop of Henle is permeable to H2O, so H20 diffuses out into the surrounding fluids. Because the loop is impermeable to Na+ and Cl\" and because these ions are not pumped out by active transpo, Na+ and Cl\" remain inside the loop. As the fluid continues to travel down the descending limb of the loop, it becomes more and more concentrated, as water continues to diffuse out. Maximum concentration occurs at the bottom of the loop. The ascending limb of the loop of Henle is impermeable to water, but Na+ and Cl\" are pumped out into the surrounding fluids by active transpo. As fluid travels up the ascending limb, it becomes less and less concentrated because Na+ and Cl\" are pumped out. At the top of the ascending limb, the fluid is only slightly less concentrated than at the top of the descending limb. In other words, there is little change in the concentration of the fluid in the tubule as a result of traversing the loop of Henle. In the fluid surrounding the loop of Henle, however, a gradient of salt (Na+, Cl\") is established, increasing in concentration from the top to the bottom of the loop. Fluid at the top of the collecting duct has a concentration of salts about equal to that at the beginning of the loop of Henle (some water is reabsorbed in the DCT). As the fluid descends the collecting duct, the fluid is exposed to the surrounding salt gradient established by the loop of Henle. Two outcomes are possible: If water conservation is necessary, as in contraction of the extra cellular fluid volume, ADH stimulates the opening of water channels in the collecting duct, allowing H20 to diffuse out of the duct and into the surrounding fluids. The result is concentrated urine. If water conservation is not necessary, ADH is not secreted and the duct remains impermeable to H20. The result is dilute urine.",

These studies measure the average diameter of the chylomicrons, showing an average chylomicron diameter of 500 nm at 1 hour, which drops to an average diameter of 150 nm at 3 hours. Where is the enzyme responsible for this change located?",
        "exp": "Chylomicrons are produced by enterocytes (intestinal epithelial cells), using gut luminal triglycerides for the source of the lipid. The chylomicrons are secreted into the gut lymphatic system, and from there drain eventually into the systemic venous system from the thoracic duct, and hence into the serum poion of the blood. They are initially large and have a very high triglyceride content. With time, lipoprotein lipase releases triglycerides from the chylomicron core by hydrolyzing them to more easily absorbed fatty acids. The enzyme is located on the external surface of the vascular endothelium of tissues with triglyceride needs such as skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle tissue, and lactating breast. The result of lipoprotein lipase activity is that the chylomicrons shrink in size. While adipose tissue can utilize chylomicrons, lipoprotein lipase is located on the endothelial cells rather than adipocytes. Adipocytes have an adipose tissue lipase, which is an intracellular enzyme that can cleave triglycerides to glycerol and fatty acids, allowing them to be released into the circulation when chylomicrons are low. Enterocytes have the ability to pick up mixed micelles from the gut lumen for repackaging in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum as chylomicrons. Hepatocytes pick up the chylomicron remnants after the lipoprotein lipase shrinks them. Ref: Barrett K. E., Barman S. M., Boitano S., Brooks H. L. (2012). Chapter 26.

This lobe, which is phylogenetically the oldest pa of the cerebellum, has vestibular connections and is concerned with equilibrium. The rest of the vermis and the adjacent medial poions of the hemispheres form the spinocerebellum, the region that receives proprioceptive input from the body as well as a copy of the \"motor plan\" from the motor coex. By comparing plan with performance, it smoothes and coordinates movements that are ongoing. The vermis projects to the brainstem area concerned with control of axial and proximal limb muscles, whereas the hemispheres project the brainstem areas concerned with control of distal limb muscles. The lateral poions of the cerebellar hemispheres are called the cerebrocerebellum, or neocerebellum.

        "exp": "Diabetes insipidus is characterized by the excretion of abnormally large volumes of dilute urine (polyuria) with a commensurate increase in fluid intake (polydipsia). The most common type is due to inadequate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (also called vasopressin) and is usually referred to as \"neurogenic\" diabetes insipidus. This condition rarely causes severe problems as long as the person has plenty of water to drink. Placing the patient on overnight water restriction caused severe dehydration and a greatly elevated plasma sodium concentration. The possibility of diabetes mellitus, which can also be associated with polyuria and polydipsia, is easily excluded by the lack of glucosuria. Addison's disease results from failure of the adrenal coices to produce adrenocoical hormones. The lack of aldosterone leads to decreases in sodium reabsorption allowing large amounts of sodium to be lost into the urine. Polyuria and polydipsia are not characteristic of Addison's disease.

        "exp": "Thyroxine Increases Metabolism of Cells. Thyroxine indirectly affects protein metabolism by increasing metabolism of the cells. If insufficient carbohydrates and fats are available for energy, thyroxine causes rapid degradation of proteins and uses them for energy. Conversely, if adequate quantities of carbohydrates and fats are available and excess amino acids are also available in the extracellular fluid, thyroxine can actually increase the rate of protein synthe\u00adsis. In growing animals or human beings, deficiency of thyroxine causes growth to be greatly inhibited because of lack of protein synthesis. In essence, it is believed that thyroxine has little specific effect on protein metabolism but does have an important general effect by increasing the rates of both normal anabolic and normal catabolic protein reactions. Thyroid hormones stimulate metabolic rate, calorigenesis, cardiac function, and normal mentation, and interact synergistically with catecholamines. Thyroid hormones also play critical roles in development, particularly of the nervous system, and growth. Note: Lack of adequate amount of thyroxine can result in stunted growth with a stuffed-belly, and short stature with mental retardation.

The initial reaction in the intrinsic system is conversion of inactive factor XII to active factor XII (XIIa). This activation, which is catalyzed by high molecular weight kininogen and kallikrein can be brought about in vitro by exposing the blood to electro negatively charged wettable surfaces such as glass and collagen fibers. Activation in vivo occurs when blood is exposed to the collagen fibers underlying the endothelium in the blood vessels. Active factor XII than activates factor Xi, and active factor XI activates factor IX.

Na+ reabsorption occurs in all segments of nephron excepting descending limb of the loop of Henle. 60% (60- 70%) of filtered Na+ is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. About 30% of filtered Na+ is reabsorbed in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. About 7% of filtered Na+ is reabsorbed in early distal tubules and about 3% of filtered sodium is reabsorbed in late distal tubule and collecting duct. About 65% (60-70%) of water is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule and about 15% of water is reabsorbed in the thin descending limb. Remaining 20% of water enters the distal tubules and is absorbed from distal tubule and collecting duct according to the homeostatic requirements of the body, under the control of ADH. All substances (Na +, K +, HCO3, Cl-, Phosphate, Protein, Glucose, water) are maximally absorbed in the proximal tubule. Glucose and amino acids are completely absorbed from proximal tubules along with Na + as secondary active transport cotransport (symport). H + is not absorbed by nephrons anywhere it is only secreted (in the proximal tubule, late distal tubule and cortical collecting tubules). Substances which are both secreted and reabsorbed are K +, uric acid and creatinine. On a normal diet, maximum solutes are reabsorbed almost completely: Glucose: 100%, Aminoacids 100%, HCO3-: 100%.

Similar to endocytosis exocytosis requires Ca++ and energy. Exocytosis is also called emiocytosis or reverse pinocytosis. Exocytosis (secretion from the cell) occurs two pathways: -Non-constitutive pathway:- Proteins from the Golgi apparatus initially enter secretory granules, where processing of prohormones to mature hormones occurs before exocytosis.

The caliber of the coronary vessels, and consequently the rate of coronary blood flow, is influenced not only by pressure changes in the aorta but also by chemical and neural factors. The coronary circulation also shows considerable autoregulation. The close relationship between coronary blood flow and myocardial O2 consumption indicates that one or more of the products of metabolism cause coronary vasodilation. The coronary arterioles contain \u03b1-adrenergic receptors, which mediate vasoconstriction, and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, which mediate vasodilation. Activity in the noradrenergic nerves to the heart and injections of norepinephrine cause coronary vasodilation. The direct effect of noradrenergic stimulation is constriction rather than dilation of the coronary vessels.

Erythropoietin increases the number of erythropoietin sensitive committed stem cells in the bone marrow that are conveed to red blood cells precursors and subsequently to mature erythrocytes. In the absence of erythropoietin, erythroid stem cellsundergo apoptosis. In adults, about 85% of erythropoietin comes from the kidney (interstitial cells in peritubular capillary bed) and 15% from liver (Perivenous hepatocytes). Small amount is also produced in brain; and uterus and oviducts. Ceain tumors also produce erythropoietin,. e. g., Renal cell carcinoma, Hepatoma and cerebellar hemangioblastoma. The most impoant stimulus for erythropoietin secretion is hypoxia. Other stimulus that can increase its secretion are cobalt salts, androgens, alkalosis due to high altitude, and catecholamines f3-adrenergic mechanism. Pregnancy (due to placental lactogen), testosterone and prolactin increase the activity of erythropoietin. Estrogen inhibits utilization of erythropoietin by marrow cells and also impairs its production.

They occur rhythmically on both sides of the head but are often slightly higher in amplitude on the nondominant side, especially in right-handed individuals. A normal alpha variant is noted when a harmonic of alpha frequency occurs in the posterior head regions. They tend to be present posteriorly more than anteriorly and are especially prominent with closed eyes and with relaxation. Alpha activity disappears normally with attention (e. g., mental arithmetic, stress, opening eyes). In most instances, it is regarded as a normal waveform. An abnormal exception is alpha coma, most often caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy of destructive processes in the pons (e. g., intracerebral hemorrhage). In alpha coma, alpha waves are distributed uniformly both anteriorly and posteriorly in patients who are unresponsive to stimuli. Beta waves are observed in all age groups. They tend to be small in amplitude and usually are symmetric and more evident anteriorly. Drugs, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, augment beta waves. Theta waves normally are seen in sleep at any age. In awake adults, these waves are abnormal if they occur in excess. Theta and delta waves are known collectively as slow waves. Delta waves are slow waves have a frequency of 3 Hz or less. They normally are seen in deep sleep in adults as well as in infants and children. Delta waves are abnormal in the awake adult. Often, they have the largest amplitude of all waves. Delta waves can be focal (local pathology) or diffuse (generalized dysfunction).",
