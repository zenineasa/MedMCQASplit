Recommended daily intake of potassium to reduce risk of high blood pressure, stroke, and hea disease is 4-5g/d.",
        "exp": "Edema is the accumulation of interstitial fluid in abnormally large amounts. The lymphatic circulation takes up a significant poion of fluid from the interstitial tissues, along with extravascular proteins, and returns it to the blood. If the lymphatic circulation is obstructed, the lymphatic drainage is interrupted. Affected areas have large accumulation of fluid and are edematous. The vascular system also aids in maintaining fluid volume. The endothelium is the lining of the vessels and serves as a semipermeable membrane for fluids and components, primarily by keeping proteins intraluminal colloidal pressure and causing fluid leakage and edema. Capillary blood pressure (BP), or hydrostatic pressure, is the force in capillaries that drives fluids from the capillaries into the tissues. By increasing the hydrostatic pressure, fluids tend to be forced out of the capillaries into tissues, causing edema. Sodium and water also aid in maintaining fluid balance. Sodium retention causes water retention, leading to an expansion of the extracellular fluid volume both intravascularly and in the tissues with edema. The protein concentration of plasma also functions in the maintenance of fluid balance. The major protein involved is albumin. By decreasing the plasma protein concentrations, there is a decreased colloid osmotic pressure in the blood, so there is a decreased counterforce to the hydrostatic BP. Thus, there is increased fluid escaping from the capillaries and decreased resorption of fluid from tissues. Fluid tends to accumulate extracellularly, with generalized edema.

D: Secretin The strength of the contractions of small intestine is propoional to the frequency of the spike generated by the slow waves \"Slow wave\" amplitude is increased by GIT hormones released during digestion e.g. gastrin, CCK-PZ and motilin; whereas secretin and glucagons decrease the slow wave amplitude Intestinal motility Digestive hormones, cholecystokinin (CCK), gastrin and motilin increase intestinal motility Secretin decreases the activity. Serotonin and insulin can increase motility Glucagon can decrease motility. Secretin Secretin is synthesized in cytoplasmic secretory granules of S-cells which are found mainly in mucosa of duodenum and smaller numbers in jejunum of small intestine Secretin is released into circulation and/or intestinal lumen in response to low duodenal pH. Also the secretion of secretin is increased by the products of protein digestion bathing the mucosa of the upper small intestine. It is the active form of prosecretin. This acidity is due to hydrochloric acid in the chyme that enters the duodenum from the stomach the pyloric sphincter. Secretin targets the pancreas, which causes the organ to secrete a bicarbonate-rich fluid that flows into the intestine. Bicarbonate ion is a base that neutralizes the acid, thus establishing a pH orable to the action of other digestive enzymes in the small intestine and preventing acid burns. Other factors are also involved in the release of secretin such as bile salts and fatty acids, which result in additional bicarbonates being added to the small intestine. Secretin release is inhibited by H2 receptor antagonists, which reduce gastric acid secretion. As a result, if the pH in the duodenum increases above 4.5, secretin cannot be released Secretin increases water and bicarbonate secretion from duodenal Brunner's glands in order to buffer the incoming protons of the acidic chyme. It also enhances the effects of cholecystokinin to induce the secretion of digestive enzymes and bile from pancreas and gallbladder, respectively. It counteracts blood glucose concentration spikes by triggering increased insulin release from pancreas, following oral glucose intake. Although secretin releases gastrin from gastrinomas, it inhibits gastrin release from the normal stomach. It reduces acid secretion from the stomach by inhibiting gastrin release from G cells. In addition, secretin stimulates pepsin secretion from chief cells",

Central cyanosis may be due to the following causes Central Nervous System (impairing normal ventilation): Intracranial hemorrhage, Drug overdose (Heroin) - Respiratory System: Pneumonia, Bronchilitis, Pulmonary hypeension - Cardiac Disorders: Congenital hea disease: TOF, Right to left shunts Blood: Methemoglobinemia, Polycythemia Others: High altitude Peripheral cyanosis Peripheral cyanosis is the blue tint in fingers or extremities, due to inadequate circulation. The blood reaching the extremities is not oxygen rich and when viewed through the skin a combination of factors can lead to the appearance of a blue colour. All factors contributing to central cyanosis can also cause peripheral symptoms to appear, however peripheral cyanosis can be observed without there being hea or lung failures. Peripheral cyanosis may be due to the following causes: - All common causes of central cyanosis Reduced cardiac output (e.g. hea failure, hypovolemia) - Cold exposure - Aerial obstruction (e.g. peripheral vascular disease, Raynaud phenomenon) - Venous obstruction (e.g. DVT) Differential cyanosis Differential cyanosis is the bluish coloration of the lower but not the upper extremity and the head. This is seen in patients with a patent ductus aeriosus . Patients with a large ductus develop progressive pulmonary vascular disease, and pressure overload of the right ventricle occurs. As soon as pulmonary pressure exceeds aoic pressure, shunt reversal (right-to-left shunt) occurs. The upper extremity remains pink because the brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid trunk and the left subclan trunk is given off proximal to the PDA.",

        "exp": "The angina pectoris seen in aoic stenosis is caused by left ventricular hyperophy. The ventricle must generate greater pressures to overcome the occluded outflow tract, and hyperophy occurs. This contributes to cardiac ischemia in several ways. An increased myocardial mass increases myocardial oxygen demand, while the increased wall tension decreases perfusion. The myocardium is perfused during diastole, and coronary perfusion relies on this relaxation. When mural diastolic pressures remain elevated in hyperophy, perfusion is limited and ischemia results. Hyperophy does not accelerate atherosclerosis. Pulmonary hypeension seen in aoic stenosis, results in pulmonary edema and a thus a mild hindrance to alveolar gas exchange. One would not expect the PO2 to decrease enough to cause angina. Stenotic valves do not occlude the coronary aeries. Ref: Clark M.B., Friedewald W.T. (2011). Chapter 113.

Pa of receptor that protudes into cytoplasm (cytoplasmic tail of receptor) is coupled to G protein that has 3 different subunits (hetrotrimeric) - a, y. This G protein has an ability to bind guanosine nucleotides. - In resting (inactive) state the a, 13, y subunits form a complex that binds GDP on a subunitQ. When receptor gets activated (after ligand binding) it causes this GDP bound trimeric G protein complex to associate with cytoplasmic tail of receptor and to exchange GDP by GTP. This exchange causes a subunit to dissociate from combined fl & r subunits. This separated a subunit brings about biological effectQ. The 0 y subunits do not separate from each other and activates variety of effectors. (So dissociation of subunits 1/t action). When ligand is removed from receptor, the intrinsic GTP ase activity of a subunit inactivates itself by conveing its bound GTP into GDPQ. In the absence of hormone, the heterotrimeric (a,13,y) G protein complex is in an inactive GDP bound form anchored to plasma membrane through prenylated groups on 13 y subunits and by myristoylated groups on a-subunit , but not associated with the receoptor.

Mechanism of action: Ligand (photon, protein, amine hormone, & neurotransmitter) binding --> conformation change & activation of G protein --> exchange of GDP for GTP and dissociation between a- and 13 y subunits which interact with effectors. a - subunit act on Na, Ca, K- channels and phospholipse - C (PLC). p y subunit acts on adenyl cyclase, phospholipase A2, DLC, Ca - ATPase etc. Adenyl cyclase - cAMP pathway activation (i.e. adenyl cyclase activation lit T cAMP) causes stimulatin of cAMP dependent pein kinase (protein kinase A) which phosphorylates the receptorQ.

        "exp": "Ans. B: RestPreloadIt is the end volumetric pressure that stretches the right or left ventricle of the hea to its greatest geometric dimensions under variable physiologic demand.Preload is theoretically most accurately described as the initial stretching of a single cardiomyocyte prior to contraction.The term end-diastolic volume is better suited to the clinic, although not exactly equivalent to the strict definition of preload.Atrial pressure is a surrogate for preload.Quantitatively, preload can be calculated as: LVEDP.LVEDR/ 2hWhere LVEDP = Left ventricular end diastolic pressure, LVEDR = Left ventricular end diastolic radius (at the ventricle's midpoint), and h = thickness of the ventricle.This calculation is based on the Law of Laplace.Preload is affected by venous blood pressure and the rate of venous return.These are affected by venous tone and volume of circulating blood.Preload is related to the ventricular end-diastolic volume; a higher end-diastolic volume implies a higher preload.Preload increases with exercise (slightly), increasing blood volume (over transfusion, polycythemia) and neuroendocrine excitement (sympathetic tone).An aeriovenous fistula can increase preload AfterloadIt is the tension or stress developed in the wall of the left ventricle during ejection.Following Laplace's law, the tension upon the muscle fibers in the hea wall is the product of the pressure within the ventricle, multiplied by the volume within the ventricle, divided by the wall thickness.Therefore, a dilated left ventricle has a higher afterload.Conversely, a hyperophied left ventricle has a lower afterload.When contractility becomes impaired and the ventricle dilates, the afterload rises and limits output.This may sta a vicious circle, in which cardiac output is reduced as oxygen requirements are increased.Afterload can also be described as the pressure that the chambers of the hea must generate in order to eject blood out of the hea and thus is a consequence of the aoic pressure (for the left ventricle) and pulmonic pressure or pulmonary aery pressure (for the right ventricle).The pressure in the ventricles must be greater than the systemic and pulmonary pressure to open the aoic and pulmonic valves, respectively.As afterload increases, cardiac output decreases. Preload best describes the maximum viscous blood volume of end diastole while afterload better describes the maximum tension of the myocardial muscle mass in end systole.",

B: GlomerulusThe JGA is composed of JG cells, macula densa cells and mesangial/Lacis cellsJuxtaglomerular apparatusThere are 3 different types of cells in the Juxtaglomerular Apparatus: Granular Cells/ juxtaglomerular cells, Macula Densa Cells and Mesangial Cells.Granular Cells/ juxtaglomerular cellsGranular cells are modified pericytes of glomerular aerioles.They are also known as Juxtaglomerular cells.The Juxtaglomerular cells secrete renin in response to:- Betal adrenergic stimulation- Decrease in renal perfusion pressure (detected directly by the granular cells)- Decrease in NaC1 absorption in the Macula Densa (often due to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, causing slower filtrate movement through the proximal tubule and thus more time for reabsorption. This results in a lower NaC1 concentration by the time the filtrate reaches the Macula Densa).Macula Densa CellsMacula densa cells are columnar epithelium thickening of the distal tubule.The macula densa senses sodium chloride concentration in the distal tubule of the kidney and secretes a locally active (paracrine) vasopressor which acts on the adjacent afferent aeriole to decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as pa of the tubuloglomerular feedback loop.Specifically, excessive filtration at the glomerulus or inadequate sodium uptake in the proximal tubule / thick ascending loop of Henle brings fluid to the distal convoluted tubule that has an abnormally high concentration of sodium.Na/Cl cotranspoers move sodium into the cells of the macula densa.The macula densa cells do not have enough basolateral Na/K ATPases to excrete this added sodium, so the cell's osmolarity increases.Water flows into the cell to bring the osmolarity back down, causing the cell to swell.When the cell swells, a stretch-activated non-selective anion channel is opened on the basolateral surface.ATP escapes through this channel and is subsequently conveed to adenosine.Adenosine vasoconstricts the afferent aeriole Al receptors and vasodilates (to a lesser degree) efferent aerioles A2 receptors which decreases GFR.Also, adenosine inhibits renin release in JG cells A2 receptors on JG cells using Gi pathway.Also, when macula densa cells detect higher concentrations of Na and Cl they inhibit Nitric Oxide Synthetase (decreasing renin release).Mesangial cells/ Lacis cellsMesangial cells are structural cells in the glomerulus that under normal conditions serve as anchors for the glomerular capillaries.The mesangial cells within the glomerulus communicate with mesangial cells outside the glomerulus (extraglomerular mesangial cells), and it is the latter cells that form pa of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.These cells form a syncytium and are connected with glomerular mesangial cells gap junctions.They contain actin and myosin, allowing them to contract when stimulated by renal sympathetic nerves, which may provide a way for the sympathetic nervous system to modulate the actions of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.",

It represents the affinity of hemoglobin for 02 Normal curve S- shaped or sigmoid shapedQ due to interconversion of hemoglobin from low affinity tightly bound Tense configuration (T state) to high affinity released configuration (R state) as more 02 molecules are bound. - Relaxed configuration exposes more oxygen binding sites & significantly increases 02 affinity. - Combination of the first heme with 02 increase the affinity of second heme for 02 (due to TR interconversion) and oxygenation of second increases the affinity of the third and so on. * P,0 - The paial pressure of 02 at which Hb saturation is 50% Q.

(inside - outside asymmetry) specific enzymes are located exclusively on the outside or inside of membranes, (inside - outside asymmetry) gap junction synapses and tight junctions occupy only smaller regions of membrane and generate local (regional) asymmetry there is inside - outside (transverse) asymmetry of the phospholipidsThe choline- containing phospholipids (phosphotidylcholine or lecithin & sphingomyelin) are located mainly in the outer molecular layer; the aminophospholipids (phosphotidyl serine & phosphotidylethanolamine) are preferentially located in inner leaflet. There must be limited transverse mobility (flip- flop) of the membrane phospholipid to maintain this transverse asymmetry. Phospholipids exhibit an extraordinarily slow rate of flip flop. When ceain membrane proteins such as erythrocyte protein glycoplwrin are inseed aificially into synthetic bilayers, the frequency of phospholipid fillip -flop increases as much as 100 folds.Membranes are composed of - lipids, proteins and carbohydrates and membranes are dyanic structure- Major lipids in mammalian membranes are phospholipids (phosphoglycerides > sphingomyelin), glycolipids & cholesterol.Membrane lipids are amphipathetic i.e. contain both hydrophobic & hydrophilic regionsQ.- Membrane lipids are bilayer- Proteins are associated with lipid bilayer (+- covalent linkage) and may be integral or peripheral in location. Ion channels are transmembrane proteins that allow selective entry of various ions; ionophores are molecules that act as membrane shuttle for various ions and aquaporins are proteins that form water channels in ceain molecules.Oleic acid is most abundant unsaturated fatty acid in animal membrane lipids. Sphingolipids are found in membranes specifically in tissues of nervous system. Degree of unsaturation determines fluidity of membrane and cholesterol helps to regulate it.",

        "question": "A cut /lesion above the pyramidal tract decussation results in: September 2007",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Paralysis of the opposite half of the bodyThe Pyramidal Tract/coicspinal tract is group of fibers carries messages for voluntary motor movement to the lower motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord.Approximately 80% of the cell bodies of the pyramidal tract are located on the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe (the motor strip). Approximately 20% of the pyramidal tract fibers also originate in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe, in Brodmann's areas 1, 2, and 3. Regardless of the location of their cell bodies, pyramidal tract fibers begin their descent from the coex as a corona radiata (radiating crown) before forming the internal capsule.This tract is direct and monosynaptic which allows messages to be transmitted very rapidly from the central nervous system to the periphery.The fibers of the pyramidal tract that synapse with spinal nerves sending information about voluntary movement to the skeletal muscles form the coico-spinal tract. As they descend through the brain, they form pa of the posterior limb of the internal capsule.At the pyramids in the inferior pa of the medulla, eighty-five to ninety percent of coico-spinal fibers decussate, or cross to the other side of the brain. The remaining ten to fifteen percent continue to descend ipsilaterally. The fibers that decussate are called the lateral coico-spinal tract or the lateral pyramidal tract. Because they descend along the sides of the spinal cord, the uncrossed or direct fibers that synapse with spinal nerves on the ipsilateral side of the body are called the direct pyramidal tract. They may also be referred to as the ventral pyramidal tract or the anterior coico-spinal tract since they travel down the ventral aspect of the spinal cord.The spinal nerves receive only contralateral innervation from the coico-spinal tract. This means that unilateral pyramidal tract lesions above the point of decussation in the pyramids will cause paralysis of the muscles served by the spinal nerves on the opposite side of the body. For example, a lesion on the left pyramidal tract above the point of decussation could cause paralysis on the right side of the body.",

        "exp": "Three impoant conditions affect the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve: pH, the temperature, and the concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). The decrease in O2 affinity of hemoglobin when pH of blood falls is called the Bohr effect and is closely related to the fact that deoxyhemoglobin binds H+ more actively than does oxyhemoglobin. The pH of blood falls as its CO2 content increases, so that when the PCO2 rises. But CO2 does not change directly the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. The greater affinity of fetal hemoglobin F than adult hemoglobin A for O2 facilitates the movement of O2 from the mother to the fetus.

A: DCT Aldosterone acts on the principal (P) cells of DCT and collecting tubules Aldosterone It increases the reabsorption of sodium ions and water and the secretion of potassium ions in the collecting ducts and distal convoluted tubule of the kidneys' functional unit, the nephron. This increases blood volume and, therefore, increases blood pressure. Drugs that interfere with the secretion or action of aldosterone are in use as antihypeensives. One example is spironolactone, which lowers blood pressure by blocking the aldosterone receptor. Aldosterone is pa of the renin-angiotensin system. Aldosterone is a yellow steroid hormone (mineralocoicoid family) produced by the outer-section (zona glomerulosa) of the adrenal coex. The overall effect of aldosterone is to increase reabsorption of ions and water in the kidney. Its activity is reduced in Addison's disease and increased in Conn's syndrome.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: 14 days prior to next menstruation The process of ovulation is controlled by the hypothalamus of the brain and through the release of hormones secreted in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, LH and FSH. In the follicular (pre-ovulatory) phase of the menstrual cycle, the ovarian follicle will undergo a series of transformations called cumulus expansion, this is stimulated by the secretion of FSH. After this is done, a hole called the stigma will form in the follicle, and the ovum will leave the follicle through this hole. Ovulation is triggered by a spike in the amount of FSH and LH released from the pituitary gland. During the luteal (postovulatory) phase, the ovum will travel through the fallopian tube toward the uterus. If feilized by a sperm, it may perform implantation there 6-12 days later. In humans, the few days near ovulation constitute the feile phase. The average time of ovulation is the foueenth day of an average length (twenty-eight day) menstrual cycle. It is normal for the day of ovulation to vary from the average, with ovulation anywhere between the tenth and nineteenth day being common, but commonly occurs 14 days before the next cycle. Cycle length alone is not a reliable indicator of the day of ovulation.",

        "exp": "Decreased carboxyhemoglobin Physiological effects of smoking The extent of the effects of smoking is related to the number of cigarettes smoked, smoking duration, the amount and type of smoke inhaled. Nicotine in tobacco and smoke stimulates the adrenal medulla, increasing plasma adrenaline and urinary catecholamines and their metabolites. Plasma glucose concentration is enhanced within min after the sta of smoking, often persisting for an hour or so after smoking ceases. Plasma insulin rises about an hour after smoking. Plasma growth hormone concentration may increase tenfold within 30 min after the smoking of one cigarette. Smoking increases the hea rate of smoker, both at rest and in exercise. There is an associated increase of both cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. These changes can be attributed to nicotine inducing release of the hormone noradrenaline. Cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk and extent of advanced atherosclerotic vascular disease in peripheral as well as coronary aeries. The likelihood of claudication, amputation, stroke, abdominal aoic aneurysm, and failure of vascular reconstruction is higher in smokers than nonsmokers. Smoking exes its deleterious effects through many interactive mechanisms. Nicotine and carbon monoxide produce acute cardiovascular consequences, including altered myocardial performance, tachycardia, hypeension, and vasoconstriction. Smoking injures blood vessel walls by damaging endothelial cells, thus increasing permeability to lipids and other blood components. Among metabolic and biochemical changes induced by smoking are elevated plasma, free fatty acids, elevated vasopressin, and a thrombogcnic balance of prostacyclin and thromboxane A 2. Chronic smoking is associated with a tendency for increased serum cholesterol, reduced high density lipoprotein, and other lipid effects that contribute to atherosclerosis. Hematological changes from increased erythrocytes, leukocytes, and fibrinogen causes alterations in platelet aggregation and survival that produce thrombosis. Smokers have higher plasma beta-lipoprotein. cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations than nonsmokers. Smoking increase total red blood cells, carboxyhemoglobin and leukocyes, but decreases blood paial pressure of oxygen in habitual smokers. The hematocrit is increased.

The first of somatomedin isolated was called sulfation factor because it stimulated incorporation of sulfate into cailage (i.e. deposition of chondroitin sulfate)Q and collagen formation.SomatomedinsSomatomedins are polypeptide growth factors, secreted by liver and other tissues, which mediate the effects of growth hormone (somatotropin or STH) on growth, cailage and protein metabolism.Liver (and to a much lesser extent, other tissues) form somatomedins, when stimulated by somatotropin (or growth hormone). That is why gwoth hormone supplied directly to cailage chondrocytes cultured outside the body fails to produce proliferation & enlargement of chondrocytes whereas, growth hormone injections into intact living animal does cause it.Somatomedins are also k/a insulin like growth factors (IGFs) because many of its effects on growth are similar to effects of insulin on growth.At least 4 types have been isolated 3 of which are- Somatomedin A or insulin like growth factor 2 (IGF2) or multiplication stimulating activity (MSA) - Somatomedin B derived from vitronectin- Somatomedin C or IGF 1 is the most impoant type & its concentration closely follows the rate of growth hormone secretionThe principal & in humns probably the only circulating somatomedins are IGF1 & IGF-2. these factors closely relate to insulin, except that their C chains are not separated and they have an extension of A chain called the D domain.

Whereas the growth hormone weakly binds to protein & has a sho half life of 20 minutes.It seems that GH & somatomedins can act both in cooperation & independently to stimulate pathways that 1/t growth. GH promote growth of muscle & bone. Its metabolic actions are counter regulatory to insulin as it induces glycogenolysis & gluconeogenesis in liver to increase blood glucose and mobilizes free fatty acids (i.e. lipolysis). It inhibits glucose uptake by muscle & fat cells, so more glucose is provided to brain & hea. Simultaneously, GH stimulates lipolysis in fat cells providing free fatty acids to hea & active skeletal muscle.

In this condition, which was originally described by James Parkinson and is named for him, the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons degenerate. The fibers to the putamen are most severely affected. Dopaminergic neurons and dopamine receptors are steadily lost with age in the basal ganglia in normal individuals, and an acceleration of these losses apparently precipitates parkinsonism. Symptoms appear when 60-80% of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons are lost.

At that level of mean BP, baroreceptor discharge is extremely low as BP is already low. So when the sinus nerve is cut at mean BP below 70mmHg, the chemoreceptor activity gets hindered. Hence chemoreceptor mediated vasoconstriction and BP elevation are blocked.

It is nothing else but filtered HCO3- ions which react with H+ to form H2CO3. This is the most impoant buffer in proximal tubules.ii) Phosphate buffer : - Especially impoant in distal tubules.iii) Ammonia buffers : - Bind to H+ and produce ammonium ion (H+ + NH3 = NH4). The reaction with NH3 occurs in the proximal and distal tubules but the main buffering mechanism is active in distal tubule and this is the most impoant buffer in distal tubule.Thus, these buffers neutralize H+ in the tubules and in exchange HCO2 is reabsorbed. In case of bicarbonate buffer all filtered bicarbonates are reabsorbed. In case of ammonia and phosphate buffers, new HCO3 is generated due to secretion of W.

        "exp": "B i.e. Abolished by DecoicationSham (false) rage is an outburst of pathological (inappropriate, uncontrolled & violent) anger & fear in decoicate animals on mild peripheral stimulation. It can be caused by stimulation of punishment center of hypothalamus and presents with features of sympathetic stimulationQ.Reward center (ie area of brain responsible for self stimulation reward on induction) includes medial forebrain bundleQ, especially in lateral and ventro medial nuclei of hypothalamusQ.Sham Rage (= False Anger) Reaction - Sham (false) rage is defined as an outburst of inappropriate, uncontrolled (pathological/ violent) rage (fear & anger) on mild peripheral provocation or stimulation. It is seen in decoicate animals (after removal of neocoex) and after destruction of venteromedial nuclei of hypothalamus & septa] nuclei, due to release of punishment centers of brain (esp in periventricular zone of hypothalamus & lateral hypothalamus) from coical and hypothalamic inhibitory control.It is misnomer, as originally it was thought that the rage attacks in decoicated animals (with fore brain, diencephalic lesions) represent only a physical - motor phenomenon of anger and lack emotional (mental) aspect. But now its proved wrong as animals develop unpleasant feelings directed with great accuracy at the source of irritation and develop extremely persistent conditioned avoidance response.Sham rage (like normal rage) can also be produced by strong (in normal) or mild (in decoicated animals) stimulation of punishment centers of hypothalamusQ and shows features of sympathetic stimulation like increased BP, increased hea rate, dilation of pupils and piloerection.Rage & Punishment Centers- Rage is an emotional behavior pattern that involves strong stimulation of the punishment centers of hypothalamus & other limbic structures (especially in periventricular zone of hypothalamus and in lateral hypothalamus) and cause animal to behave in a manner that one would expect from an animal being severely punished. It causes the animal to(1) Develop a defence posture(2) Lift its tail(3) Hiss, spit, growl or bite(4) Extend its claws(5) Develop sympathetic features like dilated pupils, wide open eyes & piloerection and(6) Cause an immediate savage (crudely violent) attack even on slightest provocation.- Normally, this rage phenomenon is held in check mainly by inhibitory signals from the ventero medial nuclei of hypothalamus. Poions of hippocampi & anterior limbic coex especially in anterior cingulate gyri and subcallosal gyri also help to suppress the rage reaction.Punishment or Escape Centers- Electrical stimulation of punishment center ie thin zone of periventricular nuclei (located adjacent to 3rd ventricle), adjoining central grey area of mesencephalon and lateral hypothalamus leads to unpleasant (aversive) fear, anger, defence, escape , terror, punishment (even sickness & pain) reactions.- Most potent areas for punishment & escape tendencies are found in central grey areasurrounding the aqueduct of Sylvius in mesencephalon, extending upwards into the periventricular zone of hypothalamus & thalamus; whereas less potent areas include amygdale and hippocampus.Stimulation of punishment center usually inhibit the reward & pleasure centers completely, showing that fear and punishment can take precedence over pleasure and reward.Reward or Pleasure CentersIf electrical stimulation of any area gives the animal a sense of reward, then it will stimulate the area by pressing lever again and again (sometimes even thousands of time per hour) - ie self stimulatory reward induction. When offered the choice between eating delectable (liked) food as apposed to stimulate the reward center, the animal often chooses electrical stimulation of reward induction.- Major reward centers are located along course of the media forebrain bundle especially in lateral and ventro medial nuclei of hypothalamus. Less potent reward centers which are secondary to major hypothalamic centers are found in the septum, amygdala, ceain areas of thalamus and basal ganglia and extending downward into the basal tegmentum of mesencephalon- Lateral nucleus, like many other areas, with weaker stimuli giving a sense of reward and with stronger stimuli a sense of punishment.",

        "question": "Transection at mid pons level results in:",
        "exp": "Apneusis Apneusis is the best option. Read below? To understand the effect of transection at different levels of brainstem, let's first understand the neural mechanism regulating respiration. Two separate neural mechanisms regulate respiration. One is responsible for voluntary control and the other for automatic control. The voluntary system is located in the cerebral coex and sends impulses to the respiratory motor neurons the coicospinal tracts which bypass the pontomedullary centres and directly descend to the lower motor neurons supplying the muscles of respiration. This voluntary control is needed during willed respiration as found in activities like singing, whistling, blowing etc. Automatic control is exeed by the pontomedullary respiratory centres which enable smooth and unconscious execution of respiratory activities even when there is no voluntary effo. Medullary centres: (1) a dorsal respiratory group (DRG), located in the dorsal poion of the medulla, which mainly causes inspiration; (2) a ventral respiratory group (VRG), located in the ventrolateral pa of the medulla, which mainly causes forced expiration; It has been found that neither DRG nor VRG maintains the respiratory rhythm. Rhythmic respiration is initiated by a small group of pacemaker cells in the pre-Biitzinger complex (pre-BOTC) on either side of the medulla between the nucleus ambiguus and the lateral reticular nucleus. These neurons discharge rhythmically, and they produce rhythmic discharges in phrenic motor neurons. The medullary centres receive several inputs from the periphery, which may alter its activity. These are: a.Afferent impulses from carotid and aoic bodies i.e.the chemoreceptors carried by glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves respectively. Hypoxia, hypercapnia and acidosis stimulate respiration through them. Afferent impulses from the pulmonary stretch receptors, carried by the vagi. The stretch receptors are located in the walls of the brochi and bronchioles theoughout the lungs.They transmit signals through the vagi into the dorsal respiratory group of neurons when the lungs become overstretched.These signals affect inspiration in much the same way as signals from the pneumotaxic center; that is, when the lungs become overly inflated, the stretch receptors activate an appropriate feedback response that \"switches off' the inspiratory ramp and thus stops fuher inspiration.This is called the Hering-Breuer inflation reflex. This reflex also increases the rate of respiration, as is true for signals from the pneumotaxic center. In human beings, the Hering-Breuer reflex probably is not activated until the tidal volume increases to more than three times normal (greater than about 1.5 liters per breath). Therefore, this reflex appears to be mainly a protective mechanism for preventing excess lung inflation rather than an impoant ingredient in normal control of ventilation. The depth of inspiration is increased after vagotomy. Pontine centres: Pneunzotaxic Center: It limits the duration of inspiration and increases the respiratory rate. A pneumotaxic center, located dorsally in the nucleus parabrachialis of the upper pons, transmits signals to the inspiratory area. The primary effect of this center is to control the \"switch-off' point of the inspiratory ramp, thus controlling the duration of the filling phase of the lung cycle. When the pneumotaxic signal is strong, inspiration might last for as little as 0.5 second, thus filling the lungs only slightly; when the pneumotaxic signal is weak, inspiration might continue for 5 or more seconds, thus filling the lungs with a great excess of air. The function of the pneumotaxic center is primarily to limit inspiration. This has a secondary effect of increasing the rate of breathing, because limitation of inspiration also shoens expiration and the entire period of each respiration. A strong pneumotaxic signal can increase the rate of breathing to 30 to 40 breaths per minute, whereas a weak pneumotaxic signal may reduce the rate to only 3 to 5 breaths per minute. Apneustic centre: The actual existence of this centre is debated. It is supposed to excite the DRG and stimulate inspiration. The Pneumotaxic centre and vagi send inhibitory impulses to the apneustic centre and this shoens the inspiration. Now let's see the effects of transaction at different levels: A transection above the pons has no effect on respiration. B. A mid-pontine transection with the vagi cut eliminates the inhibitory influences of both pneumotaxic centre and the vagi on the apneustic centre. The uninhibited action of the aneustic centre results in apneusis. (apneusis is sustained, gasping inspiration followed by sho, inefficient expiration, which can continue to the point of asphyxia). When vagi are intact the respiration becomes slower and tidal volume greater. C. In transection at the pontomedullary junction respiration is maintained with slight irregularity. D. Transection below medulla causes stoppage of respiration completely. Also know: Ondine's curse Because voluntary and automatic control of respiration are separate, automatic control is sometimes disrupted without loss of voluntary control. The clinical condition that results has been called Ondine's curse. In German legend, Ondine was a water nymph who had an unfaithful moal lover. The king of the water nymphs punished the lover by casting a curse on him that took away all his automatic functions. In this state, he could stay alive only by staying awake and remembering to breathe. He eventually fell asleep from sheer exhaustion, and his respiration stopped. Patients with this intriguing condition generally have bulbar poliomyelitis or disease processes that compress the medulla.",

The lack of much effect on the resting membrane potential would be predicted, since the permeability of the membrane to Na+ at rest is relatively low. Conversely, increasing the external K+ concentration decreases the resting membrane potential.

Both of these actions increase glomerular filtration. In addition, it act on the renal tubules to inhibit Na+ reabsorption. Other actions include an increase in capillary permeability, leading to extravasation of fluid and a decline in blood pressure. In addition, it relax vascular smooth muscle in aerioles and venules. These peptides also inhibit renin secretion and counteract the pressor effects of catecholamines and angiotensin II. In the brain, ANP is present in neurons, and an ANP-containing neural pathway projects from the anteromedial pa of the hypothalamus to the areas in the lower brainstem that are concerned with neural regulation of the cardiovascular system. In general, the effects of ANP in the brain are opposite to those of angiotensin II, and ANP-containing neural circuits appear to be involved in lowering blood pressure and promoting natriuresis.",

This reduction in stroke volume at high hea rates is due to a decrease in the length of time the hea spends in diastole and thus a reduction in time available to the hea for filling. Stroke volume refers to quantity of blood ejected with each hea stroke. According to Starling's law of hea, stroke volume is determined primarily by the preload. As the preload increases, stroke volume also increases until it reaches a plateau. Stroke volume can also be increased by sympathetic stimulation of the hea.

ADP is released by damaged erythrocytes and helps VWF to adhere to the exposed collagen. It is not, however, the binding factor that connects the VWF to the platelets. Factor VIII does not paicipate directly in the platelet poion of blood clot formation. Thromboxane A2 promotes subendothelial exposure after vascular injury and induces platelet aggregation. Also Know: Von Willebrand Disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. VWF serves two roles: (1) as the major adhesion molecule that tethers the platelet to the exposed subendothelium; and (2) as the binding protein for FVIII, resulting in significant prolongation of the FVIII half-life in circulation. The most common type of VWD is type 1 disease, with a parallel decrease in VWF protein, VWF function, and FVIII levels, accounting for at least 80% of cases. Patients have predominantly mucosal bleeding symptoms, although postoperative bleeding can also be seen. Menorrhagia is a common manifestation of VWD. The mainstay of treatment for type 1 VWD is 1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP, or desmopressin), which results in release of VWF and FVIII from endothelial stores. Ref: Konkle B. (2012).

The principal estrogen produced by the syncytiotrophoblast cells of the placenta is estriol. Plasma and urinary levels of estriol increase significantly throughout pregnancy to about 25 ng/mL during the last trimester. So Maternal hCG and Urinary estriol hormone measurement would be most informative to assess fetal and placental health. Ref: Molina P.E. (2010). Chapter 9. Female Reproductive System. In P.E.

        "question": "Bain Bridge reflex causes:",
        "exp": "A Bainbridge Reflex is a positive feedback mechanism in which there is a compensatory increase in hea rate, due to a rise in right atrial pressure. It is commonly referred to as an Atrial Reflex. Bainbridge reflex, or atrial reflex: is an acceleration of the hea rate resulting from increased blood pressure in, or increased distension of, the large systemic veins and the right upper chamber of the hea. Atrial stretch receptors are responsible for this. Afferent signals: are carried through the vagus nerves to the medulla of the brain. Efferent signals are transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves to increase hea rate and strength of hea contraction. Prevents damming of blood in the veins atria and pulmonary circulation. The reflex competes with the baroreceptor-mediated decrease in hea rate produced by volume expansion and is diminished or absent when the initial hea rate is high. Bain bridge Reflex can be eliminated by transection of the cardiac autonomic nerve supply and injection of atropine. A \"reverse\" Bainbridge reflex has been proposed to explain the decreases in hea rate observed under conditions in which venous return is reduced, such as during spinal and epidural anesthesia, controlled hypotension, and severe hemorrhage.

Pulmonary surfactant has both a lipid (approximately 90% of total) and a protein (approximately 10% of total) component. About half of the lipids are dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. The remaining lipids include phosphatidylglycerol, which modulates the fluidity of the surfactant as well as cholesterol and other lipids. About half of the proteins are apoproteins, which have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic poions; the other half is composed of proteins normally found in blood plasma. These lipids and proteins all have the capability of interacting with hydrophilic or hydrophobic environments and it is this quality that leads to their specialized function in the lung.

This adhering plate in the junction binds cardiac muscle cells to each other at their ends to form the fiber. It is analogous in structure to zonula adherens. Gap junctions: It is the major component of lateral poion. This provides a path for ionic conductivity between adjacent muscle cells allowing contractile cells to pass between them.

Although the threshold voltage of the cell is unchanged, it now requires a stronger excitatory stimulus to reach threshold. Example: Gamma amino butyric acid (GABA).

Patients with SIADH retain water and their body fluids (eg serum) becomes progressively hypoosmotic. In other words, decreased excretion of excess water results in reduced (low)plasma osmolality (ie hypoosmotic body fluids), hyponatremia (reduced plasma Na*) but the urine is hyper-osmotic (more concentrated) and contain increased urinaryNa* than would be expected on the basis of low body fluid osmolality.- SIADH is characterized by low plasma osmolality,hyponatremia (decreased plasma / serum Na*), inappropriately high urine osmolality and significant amounts of sodium in urine (Turinary Na*)In SIADH, restricted Ovate intake is necessary to prevent cellular overhydration.

Her 5-year-old son, sustains a severe head injury. The woman was not hu in the accident, but is hyperventilating as she sits in the waiting room at the hospital. She complains of feeling faint and has blurred vision. Which of the following is decreased in this woman?",
        "exp": "The key symptom here is hyperventilation. Hyperventilation results in hypocapnia, alkalosis, increased cerebrovascular resistance, and decreased cerebral blood flow. Carbon dioxide plays an impoant role in the control of cerebral blood flow. An increase in aerial PCO2 dilates blood vessels in the brain and a decrease in PCO2 causes vasoconstriction. The anxious, hyperventilating woman is \"blowing off\" carbon dioxide, which lowers her aerial PCO2. This decrease in PCO2 has caused the cerebrovascular resistance to increase, thereby decreasing cerebral blood flow. The decrease in cerebral blood flow has caused the woman to feel faint and to have blurred vision. Other symptoms commonly associated with the hyperventilation of anxiety states are feelings of tightness in the chest and a sense of suffocation. Hyperventilation increases the aerial oxygen content and PO2 in a normal person. A decrease in aerial PCO2 causes the aerial pH to increase, i.e. the patient becomes alkalotic.",

Most vascular beds have an intrinsic capacity to compensate for moderate changes in perfusion pressure by changes in vascular resistance, so that blood flow remains relatively constant. This capacity is well developed in the kidneys, but it has also been observed in the mesentery, skeletal muscle, brain, liver, and myocardium.It is probably due in pa to the intrinsic contractile response of smooth muscle to stretch (myogenic theory of autoregulation)Vasodilator substances tend to accumulate in active tissues, and these \"metabolites\" also contribute to autoregulation (metabolic theory of autoregulation).",

        "exp": "Ingestion of glucose results in secretion of a \"gut factor\" into the blood that subsequently increases insulin secretion by b cells. The most likely candidate for this action is the intestinal peptide known as gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), which obviously was named for its effects on the stomach. GIP secretion is increased during ingestion of glucose and the blood level produced is sufficient to stimulate insulin secretion. Because of this effect on insulin secretion, GIP is sometimes referred to as glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide. Activation of the sympathetic innervation to the pancreas inhibits insulin secretion an a2-adrenergic mechanism. Hence, any sympathetic reflexes activated during ingestion of glucose would decrease insulin secretion. While paracrine release of somatostatin by D cells in the islets does inhibit insulin secretion by b cells, there is no reason to suspect that intravenous versus ingested glucose would have a differential effect on somatostatin release. The same holds true for glucagon secretion by a cells. Fuhermore, glucagon has a paracrine effect to increase insulin secretion.",

The motor-unit obey all or none law, i.e., when the nerve fiber (neuron) of the motor unit is stimulated, all the fibers of motor unit will either contract maximally or not contract at all, depending upon whether the stimulus is of threshold or subthreshold intensity. Since the unit of activation is nerve fiber, the unit of contraction is a motor unit.Muscles which are concerned with fine graded and precise movement (e.g., fingers and eye ball) have only 3-6 fibers in a motor unit. On the other hand, muscles for gross movements (e.g., leg) contain 600-1000 muscle fibers per unit. If an isolated muscle is stimulated the contractile response depends on the strength of stimulus. The dependence of the strength of contractile response on the strength of stimulus seem at first to violate the all or none followed by excitable tissue. But in fact skeletal muscle also follows all or none low at cellular level, i.e., at motor unit level (read above : motor unit). Each motor unit will either contracts with full force or not at all. But the number of motor units contracting can be altered. The larger the number of motor units which contract, stronger is the contraction of muscle (whole muslce).So, with increasing strength of stimulus, it is the number of contracting motor units which increases and resulting in increased strength of contraction.",

        "exp": "Ans. D: X waveAtrial pressure rises during atrial systole and continues to rise during isovolumetric ventricular contraction when the AV valves bulge into the atria. When the AV valves are pulled down by the contracting ventricular muscle, pressure falls rapidly and then rises as blood flows into the atria until the AV valves open early in diastole.The return of the AV valves to their relaxed position also contributes to this pressure rise by reducing atrial capacity. The atrial pressure changes are transmitted to the great veins, producing three characteristic positive waves in the record of jugular pressure.The a wave is due to atrial systole. As noted above, some blood regurgitates into the great veins when the atria contract, even though the orifices of the great veins are constricted. In addition, venous inflow stops, and the resultant rise in venous pressure contributes to the a wave.The c wave is the transmitted manifestation of the rise in atrial pressure produced by the bulging of the tricuspid valve into the atria during isovolumetric ventricular contraction.The v wave mirrors the rise in atrial pressure before the tricuspid valve opens during diastole.Venous pressure falls during inspiration as a result of the increased negative intrathoracic pressure and rises again during expiration.Careful bedside inspection of the pulsations of the jugular veins may give clinical information of some impoance. For examplein tricuspid insufficiency there is a giant c wave with each ventricular systole.In complete hea block, when the atria and ventricles are beating at different rates, the a waves that are not synchronous with the radial pulse can be made out, and there is a giant a wave (\"cannon wave\") whenever the atria contract while the tricuspid valve is closed.",

It has various causes. However, the most common cause is Graves' disease (Graves' hypehyroidism), which accounts for 60-80% of the cases. The condition, which for unknown reasons is much more common in women, is an autoimmune disease in which antibodies to the TSH receptor stimulate the receptor. This produces marked T4 and T3 secretion and enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter). However, due to the feedback effects of T4 and T1,plasma TSH is low, not high. Another hallmark of Graves' disease is the occurrence of swelling of tissues in the orbits, producing protrusion of the eyeballs (exophthalmos).

A: Vomiting Melatonin and the enzymes responsible for its synthesis from serotonin by N-acetylation and 0-methylation are present in pineal parenchymal cells, and the hormone is secreted by them into the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid. Melatonin synthesis and secretion are increased during the dark period of the day and maintained at a low level during the daylight hours. This remarkable diurnal variation in secretion is brought about by norepinephrine secreted by the postganglionic sympathetic nerves (nervi conarii) that innervate the pineal. The norepinephrine acts -adrenergic receptors in the pineal to increase intracellular cAMP, and the cAMP in turn produces a marked increase in N-acetyltransferase activity. This results in increased melatonin synthesis and secretion.

The overall effect is therefore retention of water in excess of solute; consequently, the effective osmotic pressure of the body fluids is decreased. In the absence of vasopressin, the urine is hypotonic to plasma, urine volume is increased, and there is a net water loss. Consequently, the osmolality of the body fluid rises.",

Destruction of striated muscle, regardless of the cause liberates myoglobin, and because of its relatively small size, the molecule filters through the glomeruli and appears in the urine, impaing to it a burgundy-red color. Because of the low renal threshold for myoglobin, excretion of the pigment is so rapid that the serum remains uncolored. It is estimated that 200 g of muscle must be destroyed to color the urine visibly. As with hemoglobinuria, the guaiac and benzidine tests performed on urine are positive if myoglobin is present. Myoglobinuria should thus be suspected when the urine is deep red and the serum is normal in color. Ref: Ropper A.H., Samuels M.A. (2009). Chapter 45.

Unfounately, the increased osteoid is not mineralized and the bone remains soft and weak. The bone marrow space is normal in osteomalacia.

However, respiration is slight irregular and gasping.4) Transection below the medulla :- Respiration is stopped completely.5) Bilateral vagotomy (without any brain lesion) :- Inhibitory effect of vagi on apneustic center is abolished; however, inhibitory effect of pneumotaxic center remains intact.

Radiographic studies show a tumor in the pancreas. Which of the following cells is responsible for this lesion?",
        "exp": "The symptoms described are typical for a patient with glucagon excess. Glucagon is secreted by alpha cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Increased levels are rare, usually due to carcinoma (70%) or adenoma (30%) of the islets. Two-thirds of patients with carcinoma have liver metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Increased glucagon causes a syndrome similar to diabetes mellitus, due to antagonism of insulin effects. Patients also have migratory skin rashes, alopecia, hyperpigmentation of the skin, and glossitis. Diagnosis is made by measuring glucagon. The acinar cell, the main exocrine cell of the pancreas, contains digestive enzymes. Increases in the release of these enzymes (especially amylase and lipase) occur with pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is considered an emergent medical condition. Chronic pancreatitis is associated with fibrosis and atrophy of the acinar structures. Beta cells are responsible for insulin release. An adenoma of beta cells (insulinoma) would cause hyperinsulinism. 70% are solitary and 10% are multiple. Insulinomas cause hypoglycemia, dizziness, confusion, and excessive sweating. Glucose needs to be given promptly to avoid coma and death. Diagnosis is made by finding increased insulin and hypoglycemia. Delta cells are islet cells that secrete somatostatin. Tumors producing increased somatostatin are usually malignant. Clinically, a diabetes mellitus-like syndrome occurs along with diarrhea. Diagnosis is made from elevated serum somatostatin levels, but can be difficult because of the hormone's sho half-life. Ref: Barrett K.E., Barman S.M., Boitano S., Brooks H.L. (2012). Chapter 24.
