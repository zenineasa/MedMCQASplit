Glycine and taurine conjugates of these bile acids are called as bile salts. For example, cholic acid is a bile acid, and its glycine conjugate (glycocholic acid) is a bile salt. Bile salts help in digestion and absorption of fat by emulsification and micelles formation. Bile salts act as detergents, i. e., they have surface tension lowering action.

When adding phosphate to ACD, citrate Phosphate Dextrose (CPD) is formed- It has a storage period of 21 days. There is no change in the shelf life as phosphate only increases the 2, 3 DPG levels of the stored blood. When adding both phosphate and adenine to ACD, Citrate phosphate Dextrose Adenine(CPDA-1) is formed. It has a storage period of 35 days. It increases the shelf life by improving ATP synthesis of RBCs. Using additive solutions containing saline, addenine and glucose, with or without mannitol (SAGM) decreases RBC hemolysis, thus increasing the storage period to 42 days.

Then efferent signals are transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves to increase heart rate and strength of heart conntraction. Bezold-Jarisch Reflex: Activation of chemosensitive vagal C fibers in the cardiopulmonary region (eg,, Juxta capillary ragion of alveoli, ventricles, atria, great veins, and pulmonary aery) causes profound bradycardia, hypotension and a brief period of apnea followed by rapid shallow breathing. Cushing Reflex: When ICP is increased, the blood supply to RVLM neurons is compromised. The local hypoxia and hypercapnia causes an increase in discharge from the neurons, producing hypertension, bradycardia and irregular respiration. The resultant rise in systemic aerial pressure tends to restore the blood flow to the medulla. REF: Guyton and Hall 13th edition PGno: 223",
