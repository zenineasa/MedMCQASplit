        "question": "True about body fluid osmolarity-",
        "exp": "Ans. B. Major contributor is Na+OSMOLAL CONCENTRATION OF PLASMA: TONICITY: -a. The freezing point of normal human plasma averages -0. 54degC, which corresponds to an osmolal concentration in plasma of 290 m. Osm/L. This is equivalent to an osmotic pressure against pure water of 7. 3 atmospheres (atm). The osmolality might be expected to be higher than this, because the sum of all the cation and anion equivalents in plasma is over 300 m. Osm/L. b. It is not this high because plasma is not an ideal solution and ionic interactions reduce the number of particles free to exert an osmotic effect. Except when there has been insufficient time after a sudden change in composition for equilibrium to occur, all fluid compartments of the body are in (or nearly in) osmotic equilibrium. c. The term tonicity is used to describe the osmolality of a solution relative to plasma. Solutions that have the same osmolality as plasma are said to be isotonic; those with greater osmolality are hypertonic; and those with lesser osmolality are hypotonic. All solutions that are initially isosmotic with plasma (ie, that have the same actual osmotic pressure or freezing-point depression as plasma) would remain isotonic if it were not for the fact that some solutes diffuse into cells and others are metabolized. Thus, a 0. 9% saline solution remains isotonic because there is no net movement of the osmotically active particles in the solution into cells and the particles are not metabolized. On the other hand, a 5% glucose solution is isotonic when initially infused intravenously, but glucose is metabolized, so the net effect is that of infusing a hypotonic solution. d. It is important to note the relative contributions of the various plasma components to the total osmolal concentration of plasma. e. All but about 20 of the 290 m. Osm in each liter of normal plasma are contributed by Na+ and its accompanying anions, principally Cl- and HCO3 -. Other cations and anions make a relatively small contribution. Although the concentration of the plasma proteins is large when expressed in grams per liter, they normally contribute less than 2 m. Osm/L because of their very high molecular weights. f. The major nonelectrolytes of plasma are glucose and urea, which in the steady state are in equilibrium with cells. Their contributions to osmolality are normally about 5 m. Osm/L each but can become quite large in hyperglycemia or uremia. The total plasma osmolality is important in assessing dehydration, overhydration, and other fluid and electrolyte abnormalities",

Garrett 3rd/37. Osmotic Pressure. Osmose's the diffusion of water through a semi-permeable membrane. More specifically, it is the movement of water across a semi-permeable membrane from an area of high water potential (low solute concentration) to an area of low water potential (high solute concentration). It is a physical process in which a solvent moves, without input of energy, across a semi-permeable membrane (permeable to the solvent, but not the solute) separating two solutions of different concentrations. Osmosis releases energy, and can be made to do work, as when a growing tree root splits a stone. The force per unit area, or pressure, required to prevent the passage of water through a selectively permeable membrane and into a solution of greater concentration is equivalent to the osmotic pressure of the solution, or turgor. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property, meaning that the property depends on the concentration of the solute but not on the type of solute.",
