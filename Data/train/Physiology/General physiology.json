In addition to having a powerful effect on the secretion of growth hormone, ghrelin stimulates energy production and signals directly to the hypothalamic regulatory nuclei that control energy homeostasis. The study of ghrelin has extended our understanding of how growth is controlled and has shown that the stomach is an impoant component of this system.",

The pathogenesis of dystrophic calcification involves initiation (or nucleation) and propagation, both of which may be either intracellular or extracellular; the ultimate end product is the formation of crystalline calcium phos- phate. Initiation in extracellular sites occurs in membrane- bound vesicles about 200 nm in diameter; in normal cailage and bone they are known as matrix vesicles, and in pathologic calcification they derive from degenerating cells. It is thought that calcium is initially concentrated in these vesicles by its affinity for membrane phospholipids, while phosphates accumulate as a result of the action of membrane-bound phosphatases. Initiation of intracellular calcification occurs in the mitochondria of dead or dyingcells that have lost their ability to regulate intracellular calcium. After initiation in either location, propagation of crystal formation occurs. This is dependent on the concen- tration of Ca2+ and PO4 -, the presence of mineral inhibitors, and the degree of collagenization, which enhances the rate of crystal growth.

        "exp": "Intermediate filament is 8 to 14 nm in diameter and is made up of various subunits. Some of these filaments connect the nuclear membrane to the cell membrane. They form a flexible scaffolding for the cell and help it resist external pressure. In their absence, cells rupture more easily, and when they are abnormal in humans, blistering of the skin is common. The proteins that make up intermediate filaments are cell type specific and are thus frequently used as cellular markers. For example, vimentin is a major intermediate filament in fibroblasts, whereas cytokeratin is expressed in epithelial cells. Microfilaments are long solid fibers with a 4 to 6 nm diameter that is made up of actin. Although actin is most often associated with muscle contraction, it is present in all types of cells. It is the most abundant protein in mammalian cells, sometimes accounting for as much as 15% of the total protein in the cell. Its structure is highly conserved; for example, 88% of the amino acid sequences in yeast and rabbit actin are identical. Actin filaments polymerize and depolymerize in vivo, and it is not uncommon to find polymerization occurring at one end of the filament while depolymerization is occurring at the other end. Filamentous (F) actin refers to intact microfilaments and globular (G) actin refers to the unpolymerized protein actin subunits. F-actin fibers attach to various pas of the cytoskeleton and can interact directly or indirectly with membrane-bound proteins. They reach to the tips of the microvilli on the epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa. They are also abundant in the lamellipodia that cells put out when they crawl along surfaces. The actin filaments interact with integrin receptors and form focal adhesion complexes, which serve as points of traction with the surface over which the cell pulls itself. In addition, some molecular motors use microfilaments as tracks. Microtubules are long, hollow structures with 5-nm walls surrounding a cavity 15 nm in diameter. They are made up of two globular protein subunits: a-and b-tubulin. A third subunit, g-tubulin, is associated with the production of microtubules by the centrosomes. The a and b subunits form heterodimers, which aggregate to form long tubes made up of stacked rings, with each ring usually containing 13 subunits. Because of their constant assembly and disassembly, microtubules are a dynamic poion of the cell skeleton. They provide the tracks along which several different molecular motors move transpo vesicles, organelles such as secretory granules, and mitochondria, from one pa of the cell to another. They also form the spindle, which moves the chromosomes in mitosis. Cargo can be transpoed in either direction on microtubules.

According to the fluid mosaic model proposed by Singer and Nicolson, the cell membrane is like a sea of phospholipid bilayer with proteins floating in it like icebergs. This fluidity of the membrane is dependent largely on the lipid content of the membrane. The hydrophobic side chains of fatty acids can be aligned to provide a stiff structure to the membrane. As the temperature increases, these side chain transition from a ordered to a disordered fluid like state. The temperature at which this transition occurs from ordered to disordered state is called transition temperature(Tm). Higher the Tm, lower the fluidity of the membrane Longer and saturated fatty acids decrease the fluidity because their side chains interact more strongly with each other. conversely, unsaturated fatty acids increase the fluidity at lower Tm by decreasing the compactness of the side chains.

It remains relatively refractory until phase 4. Therefore, tetanus of the type seen in skeletal muscle cannot occur. The T system in cardiac muscle is located at the Z lines rather than at the A-I junction, where it is located in mammalian skeletal muscle. Along the sides of the muscle fibers next to the disks, the cell membranes of adjacent fibers fuse for considerable distances, forming gap junctions. These junctions provide low-resistance bridges for the spread of excitation from one fiber to another. Plateau (phase 2) is due to a slower but prolonged opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.

Consequently, the wave dies at this point and fails to travel the remaining distance along the basilar membrane. Thus, a high-frequency sound wave travels only a sho distance along the basilar membrane before it reaches its resonant point and dies, a medium-frequency sound wave travels about halfway and then dies, and a very low-frequency sound wave travels the entire distance along the membrane.

The function of the smaller protein is not known (except that it might anchor the protein complex in the lipid membrane), the larger protein has three specific features that are impoant for the functioning of the pump: 1. It has three binding sites for sodium ions on the poion of the protein that protrudes to the inside of the cell. 2. It has two binding sites for potassium ions on the outside. 3. The inside poion of this protein near the sodium binding sites has adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity. When two potassium ions bind to the outside of the carrier protein and three sodium ions bind on the inside, the ATPase function of the protein becomes activated. Activation of the ATPase function leads to cleavage of one molecule of ATP, splitting it to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and liberating a high-energy phosphate bond of energy. This liberated energy is then believed to cause a chemical and conformational change in the protein carrier molecule, extruding the three sodium ions to the outside and the two potassium ions to the inside.

For instance, the lipid solubilities of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and alcohol are high, and all these substances can dissolve directly in the lipid bilayer and diffuse through the cell membrane in the same manner that diffusion of water solutes occurs in a watery solution. The rate of diffusion of each of these substances through the membrane is directly propoional to its lipid solubility. Especially large amounts of oxygen can be transpoed in this way; therefore, oxygen can be delivered to the interior of the cell almost as though the cell membrane did not exist.

The reduced ejection leads to an increase in end-systolic volume and a subsequent increase in end-diastolic volume.

        "exp": "Active Transpo of Sodium and Potassium Ions Through the Membrane--The Sodium-Potassium (Na+-K+) Pump. First, let us recall from Chapter 4 that all cell membranes of the body have a powerful Na+-K+ pump that continually transpos sodium ions to the out- side of the cell and potassium ions to the inside, as illus- trated on the left-hand side in Figure 5-4. Fuher, note that this is an electrogenic pump because more positive charges are pumped to the outside than to the inside (three Na+ ions to the outside for each two K+ ions to the inside), leaving a net deficit of positive ions on the inside; this causes a negative potential inside the cell membrane. The Na+-K+ pump also causes large concentration gra- dients for sodium and potassium across the resting nerve membrane. These gradients are the following: Na+ (outside): 142 m. Eq/L Na+ (inside): 14 m. Eq/L K+ (outside): 4 m. Eq/L K+ (inside): 140 m. Eq/L The ratios of these two respective ions from the inside to the outside are Na+ inside/Na+ outside = 0. 1 K+ inside/K+ outside = 35. 0 Leakage of Potassium Through the Nerve Membrane. The right side of Figure 5-4 shows a chan- nel protein, sometimes called a \"tandem pore domain, \" potassium channel, or potassium (K+) \"leak\" channel, in the nerve membrane through which potassium can leak even in a resting cell. The basic structure of potassium chan- nels was described in Chapter 4 (Figure 4-4). These K+ leak channels may also leak sodium ions slightly but are far more permeable to potassium than to sodium, normally about 100 times as permeable. As discussed later, this dif- ferential in permeability is a key factor in determining the level of the normal resting membrane potential.

        "exp": "Effect of Potassium and Calcium Ions on Hea Function In the discussion of membrane potentials in Chapter 5, it was pointed out that potassium ions have a marked effect on membrane potentials, and in Chapter 6 it was noted that calcium ions play an especially impoant role in acti- vating the muscle contractile process. Therefore, it is to be expected that the concentration of each of these two ions in the extracellular fluids should also have impoant effects on cardiac pumping. Effect of Potassium Ions. Excess potassium in the extracellular fluids causes the hea to become dilated and flaccid and also slows the heart rate. Large quantities also can block conduction of the cardiac impulse from the atria to the ventricles through the A-V bundle. Elevation of potassium concentration to only 8 to 12 m. Eq/L--two to three times the normal value--can cause such weakness of the hea and abnormal rhythm that death occurs. These effects result paially from the fact that a high potassium concentration in the extracellular flu- ids decreases the resting membrane potential in the car- diac muscle fibers, as explained in Chapter 5. That is, high extracellular fluid potassium concentration paially depo- larizes the cell membrane, causing the membrane potential to be less negative. As the membrane potential decreases, the intensity of the action potential also decreases, which makes contraction of the hea progressively weaker. Effect of Calcium Ions. An excess of calcium ions causes effects almost exactly opposite to those of potas- sium ions, causing the hea to go toward spastic con- traction. This is caused by a direct effect of calcium ions to initiate the cardiac contractile process, as explained earlier in the chapter. Conversely, deficiency of calcium ions causes car- diac flaccidity, similar to the effect of high potassium. Founately, calcium ion levels in the blood normally are regulated within a very narrow range. Therefore, cardiac effects of abnormal calcium concentrations are seldom of clinical concern.

        "question": "Negative feedback system in body regulates",
        "exp": "Feedback Effect of Thyroid Hormone to Decrease Anterior Pituitary Secretion of TSH Increased thyroid hormone in the body fluids decreases secretion of TSH by the anterior pituitary. When the rate of thyroid hormone secretion rises to about 1. 75 times normal, the rate of TSH secretion falls essentially to zero. Almost all this feedback depressant effect occurs even when the anterior pituitary has been separated from the hypothalamus. Therefore, as shown in Figure 76-7, it is probable that increased thyroid hormone inhibits ante- rior pituitary secretion of TSH mainly by a direct effect on the anterior pituitary gland itself. Regardless of the mech- anism of the feedback, its effect is to maintain an almost constant concentration of free thyroid hormones in the circulating body fluids. Antithyroid Substances Suppress Thyroid Secretion The best known antithyroid drugs are thiocyanate, propyl- thiouracil, and high concentrations of inorganic iodides. The mechanism by which each of these drugs blocks thyroid secretion is different from the others, and can be explained as follows. Thiocyanate Ions Decrease Iodide Trapping. The same active pump that transpos iodide ions into the thyroid cells can also pump thiocyanate ions, perchlorate ions, and nitrate ions. Therefore, the administration of thiocyanate (or one of the other ions as well) in high enough concentration can cause competitive inhibition of iodide transpo into the cell--that is, inhibition of the iodide-trapping mechanism. The decreased availability of iodide in the glandular cells does not stop the formation of thyroglobulin; it merely pre- vents the thyroglobulin that is formed from becoming iodi- nated and therefore from forming the thyroid hormones. This deficiency of the thyroid hormones in turn leads to increased secretion of TSH by the anterior pituitary gland, which causes overgrowth of the thyroid gland even though the gland still does not form adequate quantities of thyroid hormones. Therefore, the use of thiocyanates and some other ions to block thyroid secretion can lead to develop- ment of a greatly enlarged thyroid gland, which is called a goiter. Propylthiouracil Decreases Thyroid Hormone Formation. Propylthiouracil (and other, similar compounds, such as methimazole and carbimazole) prevents formation of thyroid hormone from iodides and tyrosine. The mechanism of this is paly to block the peroxidase enzyme that is required for iodination of tyrosine and paly to block the coupling of two iodinated tyrosines to form thyroxine or triiodothyronine. Propylthiouracil, like thiocyanate, does not prevent for- mation of thyroglobulin. The absence of thyroxine and tri- iodothyronine in the thyroglobulin can lead to tremendous feedback enhancement of TSH secretion by the anterior pituitary gland, thus promoting growth of the glandular tis- sue and forming a goiter. Iodides in High Concentrations Decrease Thyroid Activity and Thyroid Gland Size. When iodides are present in the blood in high concentration (100 times the normal plasma level), most activities of the thyroid gland are decreased, but often they remain decreased for only a few weeks. The effect is to reduce the rate of iodide trapping so that the rate of iodination of tyrosine to form thyroid hormones is also decreased. Even more impoant, the normal endocytosis of colloid from the follicles by the thyroid glandular cells is paralyzed by the high iodide concentrations. Because this is the first step in release of the thyroid hormones from the storage colloid, there is almost immediate shutdown of thyroid hormone secretion into the blood. Because iodides in high concentrations decrease all phases of thyroid activity, they slightly decrease the size of the thyroid gland and especially decrease its blood supply, in contradistinction to the opposite effects caused by most of the other antithyroid agents. For this reason, iodides are frequently administered to patients for 2 to 3 weeks before surgical removal of the thyroid gland to decrease the neces- sary amount of surgery, especially to decrease the amount of bleeding. Negative feedback is a regulatorymechanism in which a 'stimulus' causes an opposite 'output' in order to maintain an ideal level of whatever is being regulated. Negative feedback loops occur in a series of steps. You have a stimulus, in which a change occurs. Ref guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology edtion 12 Pg 915",

They include thelateral coicospinal tract & rubrospinal tract. Medial pathways control axial muscles and are responsible for posture, balance, and coarse control of axial and proximal muscles. They include thevestibulospinal tracts, reticulospinal tracts, and anterior coicospinal tract. The coicorubrospinal pathway serves as an accessory route for transmission of relatively discrete signals from the motor coex to the spinal cord. When the coicospinal fibers are destroyed but the coicorubrospinal pathway is intact, discrete movements can still occur, except that the movements for fine control of the fingers and hands are considerably impaired. Wrist movements are still functional, which is not the case when the coicorubrospinal pathway is also blocked. Therefore, the pathway through the red nucleus to the spinal cord is associated with the coicospinal system. Therefore, the coicospinal and rubrospinal tracts together are called the lateral motor system of the cord. Ref: Guyton; 13th edition; Chapter 56 Coical and Brain Stem Control of Motor Function",

Impoins are involved in transpo of large molecules from cytoplasm to the cell nucleus. Impoins: Cytoplasm to Nucleus: RAN cycle. Transpo of large molecules from cytoplasm to the cell nucleus requires association with transpo factors like karyopherins called Impoins. The entry and exit of large molecules from the cell nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) Cargo NLS: Protein that must be impoed to the nucleus from the cytoplasm carry nuclear localization signals (NLS). A NLS is a sequence of aminoacids that acts as a tag. The initial step in translocation through the pore involves binding of Cargo-NLS complex to impoins. The ability of both impoins and expoins to transpo their cargo is regulated by the small Ras related GTPase, RaN. Although no consumption of high-energy phosphatase is needed for translocation through the pore, the energy potential for impo comes from the high nuclear Ran-GTP concentration. Expo is coupled directly to the Ram. GAP/Ran. BP1 induced GTP hydrolysis in the cytoplasm. By the addition of cytoplasmic Ran-GTP, the Ran gradient is inveed, nuclear translocation of expo substrates can occur. Such a model is akin to transpo mechanisms of ions through membranes where electrochemical gradients are used to pump ions against their concentration gradient.

Consequently, these compounds can augment hormonal and transmitter effects mediated c. AMP. Cyclic AMP activates one of the cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases (protein kinase A, PKA) that, like protein kinase C, catalyzes the phosphorylation of proteins, changing their conformation and altering their activity. In addition, the active catalytic subunit of PKA moves to the nucleus and phosphorylates the c. AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB).

Such chemical states are extremely unstable, and free radicals readily react with inorganic and organic chemicals; when generated in cells, they avidly attack nucleic acids as well as a variety of cel- lular proteins and lipids. In addition, free radicals initiate reactions in which molecules that react with free radicals are themselves conveed into other types of free radicals, thereby propagating the chain of damage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a type of oxygen- derived free radical whose role in cell injury is well estab- lished. Cell injury in many circumstances involves damage by free radicals; these situations include ischemia- reperfusion (discussed later on), chemical and radiation injury, toxicity from oxygen and other gases, cellular aging, microbial killing by phagocytic cells, and tissue injury caused by inflammatory cells. There are different types of ROS, and they are produced by two major pathways (Fig. 1-18). * ROS are produced normally in small amounts in all cells during the reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions that occur during mitochondrial respiration and energy genera- tion. In this process, molecular oxygen is sequentially reduced in mitochondria by the addition of four elec- trons to generate water. This reaction is imperfect, however, and small amounts of highly reactive but sho-lived toxic intermediates are generated when oxygen is only paially reduced. These intermediates include superoxide (O2 * ), which is conveed to hydro- gen peroxide (H2. O2) spontaneously and by the action of the enzyme superoxide dismutase. H2. O2 is more stable than O2 * and can cross biologic membranes. In the pres- ence of metals, such as Fe2+, H2. O2 is conveed to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical * OH by the Fenton reaction.

        "question": "Blood flow to skeletal muscles (ml/min)",
        "exp": "Blood Flow Regulation in Skeletal Muscle at Rest and During Exercise Very strenuous exercise is one of the most stressful condi- tions that the normal circulatory system faces. This is true because there is such a large mass of skeletal muscle in the body, all of it requiring large amounts of blood flow. Also, the cardiac output often must increase in the nonathlete to four to five times normal, or in the well-trained ath- lete to six to seven times normal, to satisfy the metabolic needs of the exercising muscles. Rate of Blood Flow Through the Muscles During rest, blood flow through skeletal muscle averages 3 to 4ml/min/100g of muscle. During extreme exercise in the well-conditioned athlete, this can increase 25- to 50-fold, rising to 100 to 200ml/min/100g of muscle. Peak blood flows as high as 400ml/min/100g of muscle have been repoed in thigh muscles of endurance-trained athletes. Blood Flow During Muscle Contractions. Figure 21-1 shows a record of blood flow changes in a calf muscle of a human leg during strong rhythmical muscular exercise. Note that the flow increases and decreases with each muscle contraction. At the end of the contractions, the blood flow remains very high for a few seconds but then returns toward normal during the next few minutes. The cause of the lower flow during the muscle contrac- tion phase of exercise is compression of the blood vessels by the contracted muscle. During strong tetanic contrac- tion, which causes sustained compression of the blood vessels, the blood flow can be almost stopped, but this also causes rapid weakening of the contraction. Increased Blood Flow in Muscle Capillaries During Exercise. During rest, some muscle capillaries have little or no flowing blood. But during strenuous exercise, all the capillaries open. This opening of dormant capillaries diminishes the distance that oxygen and other nutrients must diffuse from the capillaries to the contracting muscle fibers and sometimes contributes a twofold to threefold increased capillary surface area through which oxygen and nutrients can diffuse from the blood to the tissues. Control of Blood Flow in Skeletal Muscles Local Regulation--Decreased Oxygen in Muscle Greatly Enhances Flow. The tremendous increase in muscle blood flow that occurs during skeletal muscle activity is caused mainly by chemicals acting directly on the muscle aerioles to cause dilation. One of the most impoant chemical effects is reduction of oxygen in the muscle tissues. When muscles are active they use oxygen rapidly, thereby decreasing the oxygen concentration in the tissue fluids. This in turn causes local aeriolar vaso- dilation because the aeriolar walls cannot maintain contraction in the absence of oxygen and because oxy- gen deficiency causes release of vasodilator substances. Adenosine may be an impoant vasodilator substance, but experiments have shown that even large amounts of adenosine infused directly into a muscle aery cannot increase blood flow to the same extent as during intense exercise and cannot sustain vasodilation in skeletal muscle for more than about 2 hours. Founately, even after the muscle blood vessels have become insensitive to the vasodilator effects of adeno- sine, still other vasodilator factors continue to maintain increased capillary blood flow as long as the exercise continues. These factors include (1) potassium ions, (2) adenosine triphosphate (ATP), (3) lactic acid, and (4) carbon dioxide. We still do not know quantitatively how great a role each of these plays in increasing muscle blood flow during muscle activity; this subject was dis- cussed in additional detail in Chapter 17. Nervous Control of Muscle Blood Flow. In addition to local tissue vasodilator mechanisms, skeletal muscles are provided with sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves and (in some species of animals) sympathetic vasodilator nerves as well. Sympathetic Vasoconstrictor Nerves. The sympa- thetic vasoconstrictor nerve fibers secrete norepineph- rine at their nerve endings. When maximally activated, this can decrease blood flow through resting muscles to as little as one-half to one-third normal. This vasocon- striction is of physiologic impoance in circulatory shock and during other periods of stress when it is necessary to maintain a normal or even high aerial pressure. In addition to the norepinephrine secreted at the sym- pathetic vasoconstrictor nerve endings, the medullae of the two adrenal glands also secrete large amounts of nor- epinephrine plus even more epinephrine into the circu- lating blood during strenuous exercise. The circulating norepinephrine acts on the muscle vessels to cause a vaso- constrictor effect similar to that caused by direct sympa- thetic nerve stimulation. The epinephrine, however, often has a slight vasodilator effect because epinephrine excites more of the beta-adrenergic receptors of the vessels, which are vasodilator receptors, in contrast to the alpha vasocon- strictor receptors excited especially by norepinephrine At rest, skeletal muscle blood flows may be 1-4 ml/min per 100g; maximal blood flows may reach 50-100 ml/min per 100g depending upon the muscle type. Therefore, blood flow can increase 20 to 50-fold with maximal vasodilation or <a style=\"color:; font-family: arial, helvetica, verdana, sans-serif;\" href=\" hyperemia</a> Totally800ml",

        "question": "Hormone acting on nuclear receptors",
        "exp": "Thyroid Hormones Increase Gene Transcription in the Cell Nucleus The thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine cause increased transcription by specific genes in the nucleus. To accomplish this, these hormones first bind directly with receptor proteins in the nucleus; these recep- tors are activated transcription factors located within the chromosomal complex, and they control the function of the gene promoters, as explained in Chapter 3. Two impoant features of thyroid hormone function in the nucleus are the following: 1. They activate the genetic mechanisms for the forma- tion of many types of intracellular proteins--probably 100 or more. Many of these are enzymes that promote enhanced intracellular metabolic activity in viually all cells of the body. 2. Once bound to the intranuclear receptors, the thyroid hormones can continue to express their control functions for days or even weeks. Hormones That Act Mainly on the Genetic Machinery of the Cell Steroid Hormones Increase Protein Synthesis Another means by which hormones act--specifically, the steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal coex, ovaries, and testes--is to cause synthesis of proteins in the target cells. These proteins then function as enzymes, transpo proteins, or structural proteins, which in turn provide other functions of the cells. The sequence of events in steroid function is essen- tially the following: 1. The steroid hormone diffuses across the cell membrane and enters the cytoplasm of the cell, where it binds with a specific receptor protein. 2. The combined receptor protein-hormone then diffuses into or is transpoed into the nucleus. 3. The combination binds at specific points on the DNA strands in the chromosomes, which activates the tran- scription process of specific genes to form m. RNA. 4. The m. RNA diffuses into the cytoplasm, where it pro- motes the translation process at the ribosomes to form new proteins. To give an example, aldosterone, one of the hormones secreted by the adrenal coex, enters the cytoplasm of renal tubular cells, which contain a specific receptor protein often called the mineralocoicoid receptor. Therefore, in these cells, the sequence of events cited earlier ensues. After about 45 minutes, proteins begin to appear in the renal tubular cells and promote sodium reabsorption from the tubules and potassium secretion into the tubules. Thus, the full action of the steroid hormone is characteristically delayed for at least 45 minutes--up to several hours or even days. This is in marked contrast to the almost instantaneous action of some of the peptide and amino acid-derived hormones, such as vasopressin and norepinephrine.

DHPR are voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the T tubule membrane. In cardiac muscle, influx of Ca2+ these channels triggers the release of Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (calcium-induced calcium release) by activating the ryanodine receptor (RyR). The RyR is named after the plant alkaloid ryanodine that was used in its discovery. It is a ligand-gated Ca2+ channel with Ca2+ as its natural ligand. In skeletal muscle, Ca2+ entry from the extracellular fluid (ECF) by this route is not required for Ca2+ release. Instead, the DHPR that serves as the voltage sensor unlocks release of Ca2+ from the nearby sarcoplasmic reticulum physical interaction with the RyR. The released Ca2+ is quickly amplified through calcium-induced calcium release. Ca2+ is reduced in the muscle cell by the sarcoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump. The SERCA pump uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to remove Ca2+ from the cytosol back into the terminal cisterns, where it is stored until released by the next action potential.

The Donnan effect on the distribution of ions has three effects in the body. First, because of charged proteins (Prot-) in cells, there are more osmotically active paicles in cells than in interstitial fluid, and because animal cells have flexible walls, osmosis would make them swell and eventually rupture if it were not for Na, K ATPase pumping ions back out of cells. Thus, normal cell volume and pressure depend on Na, K ATPase. Second, because at equilibrium the distribution of permeant ions across the membrane (m in the example used here) is asymmetric, an electrical difference exists across the membrane whose magnitude can be determined by the Nernst equation. Third, because there are more proteins in plasma than in interstitial fluid, there is a Donnan effect on ion movement across the capillary wall. \" \"The plasma proteins do more than just act as osmotic agents.

Ghrelin functions as a neuropeptide in the central nervous system. Besides regulating appetite, it also plays a significant role in regulating energy homeostasis. Ghrelin cells are found mainly in the stomachand duodenum, but also in the jejunum, lungs, pancreatic islets, gonads, adrenal coex, placenta, and kidney. It has recently been shown that ghrelin is produced locally in the brain Ghrelin has been linked to inducing appetite and feeding behaviors. Circulating ghrelin levels are the highest right before a meal and the lowest right after. Injections of ghrelin in both humans and rats have been shown to increase food intake in a dose-dependent manner. So the more ghrelin that is injected the more food that is consumed. However, ghrelin does not increase meal size, only meal number. Ghrelin injections also increase an animal's motivation to seek out food, behaviors including increased sniffing, foraging for food, and hoarding food. Body weight is regulated through energy balance, the amount of energy taken in versus the amount of energy expended over an extended period of time. Studies have shown that ghrelin levels are negatively correlated with weight. This data suggests that ghrelin functions as an adipositysignal, a messenger between the body's energy stores and the brain Ref guyton and hall hall textbook of medical physiology 12th edition pg 554",

        "exp": "Physiologic Anatomy of Cardiac Muscle Figure 9-2 shows the histology of cardiac muscle, demon- strating cardiac muscle fibers arranged in a latticework, with the fibers dividing, recombining, and then spreading again. One also notes immediately from this figure that cardiac muscle is striated in the same manner as in skel- etal muscle. Fuher, cardiac muscle has typical myofibrils that contain actin and myosin filaments almost identical to those found in skeletal muscle; these filaments lie side by side and slide along one another during contraction in the same manner as occurs in skeletal muscle (see Chapter 6). But in other ways, cardiac muscle is quite different from skeletal muscle, as we shall see. Cardiac Muscle as a Syncytium. The dark areas crossing the cardiac muscle fibers in Figure 9-2 are called intercalated discs; they are actually cell membranes that separate individual cardiac muscle cells from one another. That is, cardiac muscle fibers are made up of many indi- vidual cells connected in series and in parallel with one another. At each intercalated disc the cell membranes fuse with one another in such a way that they form permeable \"com- municating\" junctions (gap junctions) that allow rapid diffusion of ions. Therefore, from a functional point of view, ions move with ease in the intracellular fluid along the longitudinal axes of the cardiac muscle fibers so that Aoa Pulmonary aery Inferior vena cava Superior vena cava Right ventricle Tricuspid valve Pulmonary valve Right atrium Pulmonary veins Left atrium Mitral valve Aoic valve Left ventricle Lungs HEAD AND UPPER EXTREMITY TRUNK AND LOWER EXTREMITY Figure 9-1 Structure of the hea, and course of blood flow through action potentials travel easily from one cardiac muscle cell to the next, past the intercalated discs. Thus, cardiac muscle is a syncytium of many hea muscle cells in which the cardiac cells are so interconnected that when one of these cells becomes excited, the action potential spreads to all of them, from cell to cell throughout the latticework interconnections. The hea actually is composed of two syncytiums: the atrial syncytium, which constitutes the walls of the two atria, and the ventricular syncytium, which constitutes the walls of the two ventricles. The atria are separated from the ventricles by fibrous tissue that surrounds the atrio- ventricular (A-V) valvular openings between the atria and ventricles. Normally, potentials are not conducted from the atrial syncytium into the ventricular syncytium directly through this fibrous tissue. Instead, they are con- ducted only by way of a specialized conductive system called the A-V bundle, a bundle of conductive fibers sev- eral millimeters in diameter that is discussed in detail in Chapter 10. This division of the muscle of the hea into two func- tional syncytiums allows the atria to contract a sho time ahead of ventricular contraction, which is impoant for effectiveness of hea pumping.

        "exp": "Nitrogen has anesthetic effect on body The precise mechanism is not well understood, but it appears to be the direct effect of gas dissolving into nerve membranes and causing temporary disruption in nerve transmissions. While the effect was first observed with air, other gases including argon, krypton and hydrogen cause very similar effects at higher than atmospheric pressure. Some of these effects may be due to antagonism at NMDAreceptors and potentiation of GABAA receptors, similar to the mechanism of nonpolar anesthetics such diethyl ether or ethylene. However, their reproduction by the very chemically inactive gas argon makes them unlikely to be a strictly chemical bonding to receptors in the usual sense of a chemical bond. An indirect physical effect - such as a change in membrane volume - would therefore be needed to affect the ligand-gated ion channels of nerve cells. Trudell et al. have suggested non-chemical binding due to the attractive van der Waals force between proteins and ine gases. Similar to the mechanism of ethanol's effect, the increase of gas dissolved in nerve cell membranes may cause altered ion permeability propeies of the neural cells' lipid bilayers. The paial pressure of a gas required to cause a measured degree of impairment correlates well with the lipid solubility of the gas: the greater the solubility, the less paial pressure is needed. An early theory, the Meyer-Oveon hypothesis, suggested that narcosis happens when the gas penetrates the lipids of the brain's nerve cells, causing direct mechanical interference with the transmission of signals from one nerve cell to another. More recently, specific types of chemically gated receptors in nerve cells have been identified as being involved with anesthesia and narcosis. However, the basic and most general underlying idea, that nerve transmission is altered in many diffuse areas of the brain as a result of gas molecules dissolved in the nerve cells' fatty membranes, remains largely unchallenged Ref guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12/e p1036",
