These nerves are called A-delta fibers. Because of their relatively thick size, these nerve fibers allow the pain stimulus to be transferred very fast (at a speed of five to 30 meter/second), hence the name. This is all to make the body withdraw immediately from the painful and harmful stimulus, in order to avoid further damage.# Slow pain, which starts immediately after the fast pain, is transmitted by very thin nerve fibers, called C-nerve fibers (their diameter is between 0. 2 to 1 thousandth of a millimeter). Because of their small size, the pain impulse can only be transmitted slowly to the brain, at a speed of less than 2 meters per second.

In dogs and other animals in which the sense of smell is highly developed (macrosmatic animals), the area covered by this membrane is large; in microsmatic animals, such as humans, it is small. In humans, it covers an area of 5 cm2 in the roof of the nasal cavity near the septum (Figure 14-1). The human olfactory epi- thelium contains 10 to 20 million bipolar olfactory sensory neurons interspersed with glia-like suppoing (sustentacular) cells and basal stem cells. The olfactory epithelium is said to be the place in the body where the nervous system is closest to the external world. Each neuron has a sho, thick dendrite that projects into the nasal cavity where it terminates in a knob containing 10 to 20 cilia (Figure 14-2). The cilia are unmyelinated processes about 2 mm long and 0. 1 mm in diameter and contain specific receptors for odorants (odorant receptors). The axons of the olfactory sensory neurons pass through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and enter the olfactory bulbs (Figure 14-1). New olfactory sensory neurons are generated by basal stem cells as needed to replace those damaged by exposure to the environment. The olfactory renewal process is carefully regulated, and there is evidence that in this situation a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) exes an inhibitory effect. BMPs are a large family of growth factors originally described as promoters of bone growth but now known to act on most tissues in the body during development, including many types of nerve cells.

It consists of a protein opsin and a carotenoid called retinal or retinene (aldehyde of vitamin A). The light absorbed by the rhodopsin conves its 11-cis-retinal into all-trans-retinal. This light-induced isomerization of 11-cis-retinal into all-trans-retinal occurs through formation of many intermediates which exist for a transient period. In the retina, under constant light stimulation, a steady state must exist under which the rate at which they are regenerated. This equilibrium between the photodecomposition and regeneration of visual pigments is referred to as visual cycle.

Conduction System of Hearto The depolarization of the various parts of the heart proceeds in an orderly and timely way. This is made possible by the presence of the conductive system of the heart which comprises the sinoatral node (SA node), intermodal atrial pathways, atrioventricular node (AV node), bundle of his and its branches, and Purkinje system. The conduction system is made up of modified cardiac muscles. o Most of cells of the conducting system are specialized for fast conduction though some, like the cells of the AV node, are specialized for slowing down conduction. o The fastest conduction is seen in purkinje system and slowest in AV node and SA node.

Ventricular muscle1o Cells of the conductive system also possess automaticity, i. e., the capability of spontaneous excitation. o However, the rate at which different parts of conductive system discharge impulses is not the same. o The SA node discharges impulses at fastest rate, hence the rate at which SA node fires determines the heart rate, therefore, SA node is normal pacemaker of the heart, i. e., it determines the pace of the heart. o The AV node has the next highest automaticity after SA node; therefore, if the SA node stops discharging, the AV node takes over the role of cardiac pacemaker. Conduction of cardiac impulseo The cardiac impulse originates in the SA node. o From SA node it is transmitted to AV node via interatrial pathways (intemodal atrial pathways). o From AV node it is rapidly transmitted to bundle of his and then purkinje system to all parts of ventricles. o In the ventricles, endocardial surface depolarizes before epicardial surface. o Order of spread of impulse (depolarization) in ventricular myocardium is as follow: Depolarization starts at the left side of interventricular septum and then moves to the right across the mid portion of septum. o The wave then spreads down the septum to the apex of heart. o It returns along the ventricular walls to the AV groove, proceeding from the endocardial to epicardial surface. o The last parts of the heart to be depolarized are the posterobasal portion of the left ventricles, the pulmonary conus, and the upper most portion of the septum. o The sequence of repolarization is not exactly the same as that of depolarization. o Although the septum and endocardial surface of ventricles depolarizes first, it is the epicardial surface which repolarizes first, i. e., repolarization spreads from epicardium to endocarium.",

It is the basal ganglia that help to plan (programming) and coordinate complex voluntary movements. Pyrami- dal tract does not contain sensory fibres. The probable sequence of events in motor activity:-First there develops a will, but the area of brain where the will develops is uncertain. Programming- From the area where the will develops, impulses are sent to the motor cortex. These impulses are first programmed and the pro-grammed impulses now determine which area of motor cortex is to be stimulated. This programming is done in basal ganglia.-Activation of pyramidal system-The motor cortex is now fired, so that pyramidal tract fibres now become fired - Firing of LMN - contraction of skeletal muscles- action.* The extrapyramidal system is also concomitantly fired. This causes postural adjustment necessary for voluntary act.* When the voluntary motor activity is performed, the cerebellum receives input from both pyramidal and extrapyramidal system and controls both pyramidal and extrapyramidal activity.* Motor cortex fires --Impulses descends through pyramidal system. On their way they inform the cer- ebellum through corticopontocerebellar and olivocerebellar paths. * The cerebellum also receives feed back from various sources like muscles, joints and visual cortex, regarding whether the goal had been achieved or if there is any readjustment needed.* If any readjustment is needed the impulses are sent to area 4 or motor cortex through dentothalamo cortical and dentorubrothalamocortical paths.* Through them activities of area 4 can be adjusted. These readjustments make the voluntary actions automatic, highly precise and smooth. Corticospinal system or the pyramidal system is concerned with the voluntary control of muscular (motor) activity.

Ruffini corpuscles are enlarged dendritic endings with elongated capsules, and they respond to sustained pressure.

This arc consists of a sense organ, an afferent neuron, one or more synapses that are generally in a central integrating station, an efferent neuron, and an effector. In mammals, the connection between afferent and efferent somatic neurons is generally in the brain or spinal cord. The afferent neurons enter via the dorsal roots or cranial nerves and have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia or in the homologous ganglia on the cranial nerves.

It acts as a barrier between the extracellular and intracellular compaments, defining the individual muscle fiber from its surroundings. The lipid nature of the membrane allows it to separate the fluids of the intra- and extracellular compaments since it is only selectively permeable to water through aquaporin channels. As in other cells, this allows for the compositions of the compaments to be controlled by selective transpo through the membrane. Membrane proteins, such as ion pumps, may create ion gradients with the consumption of ATP, that may later be used to drive transpo of other substances through the membrane (Co-transpo) or generate electrical impulses such as Action potentials. Perlecan is a key component of the vascular extracellular matrix, here it interacts with a variety of other matrix components and helps to maintain the endothelial barrier function. Perlecan is a potent inhibitor of smooth muscle cell proliferation and is thus thought to help maintain vascular homeostasis. Perlecan can also promote growth factor (e. g., FGF2) activity and thus stimulate endothelial growth and regeneration.

Those who have suffered severe head trauma, stroke, or other degenerative diseases. Caused by damage to Temporal or Occipital lobes. Prosopagnosia: Prosopagnosia is extremely rare. Prosopagnosia of vascular origin is due to posterior cerebral artery infarcts (PCAIs). PCIAs represent 5-10% of all strokes. The infarct must affect the right side to produce prosopagnosia. Other etiologies include carbon monoxide poisoning, temporal lobectomy, encephalitis, and Alzeimer's disease. An important part of usual input goes to the inferior temporal lobe where representations of feces are stared faces are imp in distinguishing friend and foes and emotional state. An important part of visual input goes to the inferior temporal lobe, where representations of faces, are stored. Faces are important in distinguishing friends and foes and emotional state. Recognition of faces stored in right inferior temporal lobe in right handed persons. In humans, storage and recognition of faces is more strongly represented in the right inferior temporal lobe in right-handed individuals, though the left lobe is also active. Damage to this area can cause prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize faces. Patients with this abnormality can recognize forms and reproduce them. They can recognize people by their voices, and many of them show autonomic responses when they see familiar as opposed to unfamiliar faces. However, they cannot identify the familiar faces they see. NEUROLOGY - GLOSSARYAgnosia: A failure or deficit in recognizing objects. Prosopagnosia: A disruption in face recognition can identify people by voices & show autonomic responses when familiar faces are seen. Appreceptive Agnosia: A form of agnosia in which individual features cannot be integrated into a whole percept or pattern; a basic disruption in perceiving patterns. Associative Agnosia: A form of agnosia in which the individual can combine perceived features into a whole pattern but cannot associate the pattern with meaning or identify it.

CUTANEOUS MECHANORECEPTORS: -Sensory receptors can be specialized dendritic endings of afferent nerve fibers, and they are often associated with non- neural cells that surround them forming a sense organ. Touch and pressure are sensed by four types of mechanoreceptors. a. Meissner corpuscles are dendrites encapsulated in connective tissue and respond to changes in texture and slow vibrations. b. Merkel cells are expanded dendritic endings, and they respond to sustained pressure and touch. c. Ruffini corpuscles are enlarged dendritic endings with elongated capsules, and they respond to sustained pressure. d. Pacinian corpuscles consist of unmyelinated dendritic endings of a sensory nerve fiber, 2 um in diameter, encapsulated by concentric lamellae of connective tissue that give the organ the appearance of a cocktail onion. These receptors respond to deep pressure and fast vibration. e. The sensory nerves from these mechanoreceptors are large myelinated Aa and Ab fibers whose conduction velocities range from ~ 70-120 to ~ 40-75 m/s, respectively. a. Sensory systems encode four elementary attributes of stimuli: modality, location (receptive field), intensity, and duration (timing). b. The human hand has four types of mechanoreceptors; their combined activation produces the sensation of contact with an object. Selective activation of Merkel cells and Ruffini endings causes sensation of steady pressure; selective activation of Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles causes tingling and vibratory sensation. c. Location of a stimulus is encoded by spatial distribution of the population of receptors activated. A receptor fires only when the skin close to its sensory terminals is touched. These receptive fields of mechanoreceptors (shown as red areas on fingertips) differ in size and response to touch. Merkel cells and Meissner corpuscles provide the most precise localization as they have the smallest receptive fields and are most sensitive to pressure applied by a small probe. d. Stimulus intensity is signaled by firing rates of individual receptors; duration of stimulus is signaled by time course of firing. The spike trains indicate action potentials elicited by pressure from a small probe at the center of each receptive field. Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles adapt rapidly; the others adapt slowly.",

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is the difference between mean arterial pressure and intracranial pressure or central venous pressure which ever is higher. It is 50 mi/100 gm of brain tissue. Since ions are not able to cross the blood brain barrier as easily as O2, O2 and lipid soluble substances (such as most anaesthetics) the ions have little effects on cerebral blood flow. Factors affecting cerebral blood flow (CBF)A. Cerebral metabolism - cerebral blood flow varies directly with metabolic activity, various studies have shown that regional CBF parallels metabolic activity for eg motor activity of a limb is associated with an increased in regional CBF of the corresponding motor cortex. Similarily, visual activity is associated with an increase in regional CBF of the corresponding occipital cortex. B. Cerebral Perfusion pressure: is the difference between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) or central venous pressure (CVP) which ever is greater CPP is normally 80-100 mm Hg. Because ICP is normally less than 10 mm Hg. CPP is primarily dependent on MAP. Autoregulation maintains a steady CBF as perfusion pressure varies between 60 and 160 mm Hg. Decrease in CPP results in cerebral vasodilation, where as elevations induce vasoconstriction. C. Arterial PCO2 - The most important extrinsic influences on CBF are respiratory gas tensions particularly arterial PCO2. CBF is directly proportional to arterial PCO2 between tensions of 20 and 80 mm of Hg. The effect is almost immediates and is thought to be secondary to changes in the PH of CSF and cerebral tissueD. Arterial PO2: only marked changes in arterial PO2 alter CBF whereas hypoxia may be associated with only minimal decrease (-10%) in CBF severe hypoxemia (arterial PO2 less than 50 mm Hg) profoundly increases CBFE. Temperature - CBF changes 5 - 7% 1degC change in temperature. Hypothermia decreases both cerebral metabolic rate and CBF. Whereas pyrexia has the reverse effect. F. Blood viscosity - CBF rises as viscosity falls and vise versaG. Autonomic system* Cerebral blood flow is maintained at constant levels (does not change) in response to moderate exercise)**** Mild to moderate decrease in perfusion pressure decreases driving forces for flow, resulting in CO2 accumulation, which by release of H+ produces cerebral vasodilation.* Most important factor for regulating cerebral blood flow under normal conditions is the rate of cerebral CO2formation.",

It is sometimes described as an inability to judge distance or scale. The actual cause of dysmetria is thought to be caused by lesions in the cerebellum or by lesions in the proprioceptive nerves that lead to the cerebellum that coordinate visual, spatial and other sensory information with motor control. Damage to the proprioceptive nerves does not allow the cerebellum to accurately judge where the hand, arm, leg, or eye should move. There are two types of cerebellar disorders that produce dysmetria, specifically midline cerebellar syndromes and hemispheric cerebellar syndromes. Midline cerebellar syndromes can cause ocular dysmetria, Hemispheric cerebellar syndromes cause dysmetria in the typical motor sense that many think of when hearing the term dysmetria.

Alpha waves are rhythmical waves that occur at frequencies between 8 and 13 cycles per second and are found in the EEGs of almost all normal adult people when they are awake and in a quiet, resting state of cerebration. These waves occur most intensely in the occipital region but can also be recorded from the parietal and frontal regions of the scalp. Their voltage usually is about 50 microvolts. During deep sleep, the alpha waves disappear. When the awake person's attention is directed to some specific type of mental activity, the alpha waves are replaced by asynchronous, higher-frequency but lower-voltage beta waves. The effect on the alpha waves of simply opening the eyes in bright light and then closing the eye is that the visual sensations cause immediate cessation of the alpha waves and that these are replaced by low-voltage, asynchronous beta waves. Beta waves occur at frequencies greater than 14 cycles per second and as high as 80 cycles per second. They are recorded mainly from the parietal and frontal regions during specific activation of these parts of the brain. Theta waves have frequencies between 4 and 7 cycles per second. They occur normally in the parietal and temporal regions in children, but they also occur during emotional stress in some adults, particularly during disappointment and frustration. Theta waves also occur in many brain disorders, often in degenerative brain states. Delta waves include all the waves of the EEG with frequencies less than 3. 5 cycles per second, and they often have voltages two to four times greater than most other types of brain waves. They occur in very deep sleep, in infancy, and in serious organic brain disease. They also occur in the cortex of animals that have had subcortical transections separating the cerebral cortex from the thalamus. Therefore, delta waves can occur strictly in the cortex independent of activities in lower regions of the brain.",

Phantom sensations may also occur after the removal of body pas other than the limbs, for example, after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth (phantom tooth pain), or removal of an eye (phantom eye syndrome). Numerous theories have been evoked to explain this phenomenon. The current theory is based on evidence that the brain can reorganize if sensory input is cut off. The ventral posterior thalamic nucleus is one example where this change can occur. In patients who have had their leg amputated, single neuron recordings show that the thalamic region that once received input from the leg and foot now respond to stimulation of the stump (thigh).

Umami is the fifth taste sense triggered by glutamate and particularly by the monosodium glutamate (MSG) used so extensively in Asian cooking. The taste is pleasant and sweet but differs from the standard sweet taste. The action of umami receptors explains why foods treated with MSG often taste fuller. UMAMI# Humans have five established basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salt, and umami.# Umami is one of the five basic tastes sensed by specialized receptor cells present on the human tongue.# Umami is a Japanese word meaning \"savory\" or \"meaty\" and thus applies to the sensation of savoriness--specifically, to the detection of glutamates, which are especially common in meats, cheese and other protein-heavy foods.# Afferent nerves to the nucleus tractus solitarius contain fibers from all types of taste buds, without any clear localization of types. TASTE RECEPTORS# The sour taste is triggered by protons.# Umami taste is due to activation of a truncated metabotopic glutamate receptor, m. Glu. R4, in the taste buds, and the agonists are purine 5-ribonucleotides such as IMP and GMP in the food.# Bitter taste is produced by a variety of unrelated compounds, many of which are poisons. It was originally thought that a single bitter receptor was linked to the heterotrimeric G protein gustducin.# A taste modifier protein, miraculin, has been discovered in a plant. When applied to the tongue, this protein makes acids taste sweet.# A protein that binds taste-producing molecules has been cloned. It is produced by Ebner's glands--glands that secrete mucus into the cleft around vallate papillae and probably have a concentrating and transport function similar to that of the OBP in olfaction.# In humans, the taste buds are located in the mucosa of the epiglottis, palate, and pharynx and in the walls of the fungiform and vallate papillae of the tongue.# The fungiform papillae are rounded structures most numerous near the tip of the tongue; the vallate papillae are prominent structures arranged in a V on the back of the tongue. Each fungiform papilla has up to five taste buds, and they are usually located at the top of the papilla.# The larger vallate papillae each contain up to 100 taste buds, usually located along the sides of the papillae. The small conical filiform papillae that cover the dorsum of the tongue do not usually contain taste buds.# There are a total of about 10, 000 taste buds.",

They occur in very deep sleep, in infancy, and in persons with serious organic brain disease. They also occur in the coex of animals that have had subcoical transactions in which the cerebral coex is separated from the thalamus. Therefore, delta waves can occur strictly in the coex independent of activities in lower regions ofthe brain. Delta waves also occur during deep slow-wave sleep, which suggests that the coex then is mainly released from the activating influences of the thalamus and other lower centers. Slow-wave sleep is divided into four stages. In the first stage, a stage of light sleep, the voltage of the EEG waves becomes low. This stage is broken by \"sleep spindles\" (i. e., sho spindle-shaped bursts of alpha waves that occur periodically). In stages 2, 3, and 4 of slow-wave sleep, the frequency of the EEG becomes progressively slower until it reaches a frequency of only one to three waves per second in stage 4; these waves are delta waves.

        "exp": "Strychnine is a neurotoxin which acts as an antagonist of glycine and acetylcholine receptors. It primarily affects the motor nerves in the spinal cord which control muscle contraction. An impulse is triggered at one end of a nerve by the binding of neurotransmitters to the receptors. In the presence of a neuroinhibitor, such as glycine, a greater quantity of excitatory neurotransmitters must bind to receptors before there will be an action potential generated. Glycine acts primarily as an agonist of the glycine receptor, which is a ligand-gated chloride channel in neurons located in the spinal cord and in the brain. This chloride channel will allow the negatively charged chloride ions into the neuron, causing a hyperpolarization which pushes the membrane potential fuher from threshold. Strychnine is an antagonist of glycine, which means it binds to the same receptor, preventing the inhibitory effects of glycine on the postsynaptic neuron. Therefore, action potentials are triggered with lower levels of excitatory neurotransmitters. When the inhibitory signals are prevented, the motor neurons are more easily activated and the victim will have spastic muscle contractions, resulting in death by asphyxiation.

The electrical response is a result of a retinal potential generated by light-induced changes in the flux of trans retinal ions, primarily sodium and potassium. A-wave: initial corneal-negative deflection, derived from the cones and rods of the outer photoreceptor layers. This wave reflects the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptors due to closure of sodium ion channels in the outer segment membrane. Absorption of light triggers the rhodopsin to activate transducin, a G-protein. This leads to the activation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (c. GMP PDE) eventually leading to a reduction in the level of c. GMP within the photoreceptor. This leads to closure of the sodium ion channels resulting in a decrease of inwardly directed sodium ions, or a hyperpolarization of the cell.

Parasympathetic branches extend from the sacral plexus into the aeries supplying the erectile tissue; upon stimulation, these nerve branches release acetylcholine, which, in turn, causes release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells in the trabecular aeries. Nitric oxide diffuses to the smooth muscle of the aeries (called trabecular smooth muscle), acting as a vasodilating agent. The aeries dilate, filling the corpora spongiosum and cavernosa with blood. The ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles also compress the veins of the corpora cavernosa, limiting the venous drainage of blood. Erection subsides when parasympathetic stimulation is discontinued; baseline stimulation from the sympathetic division of the ANS causes constriction of the penile aeries, forcing blood out of the erectile tissue. After ejaculation or cessation of stimulation, erection usually subsides, but the time taken may vary depending on the length and thickness of the penis.

They are large, myelinated nerve endings. They provide information on pressure, position, and deep static touch features such as shapes and edges. Merkel cells in the basal epidermis of the skin store neuropeptides which they release to associated nerve endings in response to pressure. In burns, Merkel endings are most commonly lost. Each ending consists of a Merkel cell in close apposition with an enlarged nerve terminal. This is sometimes referred to as a Merkel cell-neurite complex, or a Merkel disk receptor. In mammals, Merkel nerve endings have a wide distribution. Merkel nerve endings are found in the basal layer of glabrous and hairy skin, in hair follicles, and in oral and anal mucosa. In humans, Merkel cells (along with Meissner's corpuscles) occur in the superficial skin layers and are found clustered beneath the ridges of the fingeips that make up fingerprints. In hairy skin, Merkel nerve endings are clustered into specialized epithelial structures called \"touch domes\" or \"hair disks\". (Some other types of mechanoreceptors, such as Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings, are found primarily in subcutaneous tissue.) Merkel receptors are also located in the mammary glands.

Features of Photoreceptor* Each rod and cone cells have a light-sensitive outer segment, which is connected to an inner segment by a thin connecting part.* The inner segment rich in mitochondria and establishes synaptic contact with the neighboring cells.* Synaptic terminal stores the neurotransmitter glutamate for signaling.* The outer segment of the rod cells contains membranous disks, and the plasma membrane of the outer segment of the cones is folded.* Visual pigments are stored in these disks and folds. Photoreceptor mechanism-Photo transduction* In retinal rods and cones, light-absorbing visual pigments and a variety of enzymes and transmitters mediate the conversion of light stimuli into electrical stimuli; this is called photoelectric transduction.* Vitamin A is an important component of visual pigment rhodopsin.* Rhodopsin is composed of integral membrane protein opsin and the aldehyde 11-cis-retinal. The latter is bound to a lysine residue of opsin which is embedded in this protein; it is stably kept in place by weak interactions with two other amino acid residues.* In response of light, there is an isoform conversion of Vitamin-A, which happens in acyclic form which as initially identified by Wald. It is also called as Wald visual cycle for which George Wald rewarded with Noble prize in 1964.* Photic stimuli trigger a primary photochemical reaction in rhodopsin in which 11-cis-retinal is converted to all-trans- retinal.* Even without continued photic stimulation, the reaction yields bathorhodopsin, the intermediates lumirhodopsin and metarhodopsin I, and finally metarhodopsin II.* Metarhodopsin II activates a G protein called transducing (Gt), which in turn activates a phosphodiesterase.* The conversion of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (c. GMP) to 5'-GMP catalyzes by Phosphodiesterase; so, c. GMP levels decrease.* Due to decreased levels of c. GMP leads to closure of Na+ channels - Hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cell membrane (As inward Na+ current decreased).* When the photoreceptor is hyperpolarized, there is decreased release of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter. There are two types of glutamate receptors on bipolar and horizontal cells, which determine whether the cell is excited or inhibited.",

Operant conditioning is a term that was coined by B. F. Skinner in 1937. Operant conditioning is distinguished from classical conditioning (or respondent conditioning) in that operant conditioning deals with the modification of \"voluntary behaviour\" or operant behaviour.

In particular, CRH and vasopressin stimulate the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), once known as corticotropin. ACTH in turn acts on: Adrenal cortex, which produces glucocorticoid hormones (mainly cortisol in humans) in response to stimulation by ACTH. Glucocorticoids in turn act back on the hypo- thalamus and pituitary (to suppress CRH and ACTH production) in a negative feedback cycle.> CRH & Vasopressin are released from neurosecretory nerve terminals at the median eminence.> CRH is transported to the anterior pituitary through the portal blood vessel system of the hypophyseal stalk & vasopressin is transported by axonal trans- port to the posterior pituitary gland.> CRH and vasopressin act synergistically to stimulate the secretion of stored ACTH from corticotrope cells.> ACTH is transported by the blood to the adrenal cortex of the adrenal gland, and it rapidly stimulates biosynthesis of corticosteroids such as cortisol from cholesterol.> Cortisol is a major stress hormone and has effects on many tissues in the body, including the brain. In the brain, cortisol acts on two types of receptor - mineralocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid receptors, and these are expressed by many different types of neurons. One important target of glucocorticoids is the hypothalamus, which is a major controlling centre of the HPA axis.> Vasopressin can be thought of as \"water conservation hormone\" and is also known as \"antidiuretic hormone. \" It is released when the body is dehydrated and has potent water-conserving effects on the kidney. It is also a potent vasoconstrictor.# Important to the function of the HPA axis are some of the feedback loops: Cortisol produced in the adrenal cortex will negatively feedback to inhibit both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. Reduces the secretion of CRH and vasopressin, and also directly reduces the cleavage of propiomelanocortin (POMC) into ACTH and b-endorphins. Epinephrine and norepinephrine (E/NE) are produced by the adrenal medulla through sympathetic stimulation and the local effects of cortisol (upregulation enzymes to make E/NE).

        "question": "All of the following functions are associated with myelination except",
        "exp": "The main purpose of a myelin layer (or sheath) is to increase the speed at which impulses propagate along the myelinated fiber. Along unmyelinated fibers, impulses move continuously as waves, but, in myelinated fibers, they \"hop\" or propagate by saltatory conduction. Myelin decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance across the cell membrane (the axolemma). Thus, myelination helps prevent the electric current from leaving the axon. It has been suggested that myelin permits larger body size by maintaining agile communication between distant body pas. Myelinated fibers lack voltage-gated ion channels (approximately 25 mm-2) along the myelinated internodes, exposing them only at the nodes of Ranvier. Here, they are found far more abundantly (between 2, 000 and 12, 000 mm-2). Myelinated fibers succeed in reducing sodium leakage into the extracellular fluid (ECF), maintaining a strong separation of charge between the intracellular fluid (ICF) and the ECF. This increases sodium's ability to travel along the axon more freely. However, the sodium diffuses along the axolemma rapidly but is decremental by nature. The sodium cannot trigger the opening of the voltage-gated sodium channels as it becomes weaker. The nodes of Ranvier, being exposed to the ECF every 1 mm or so, contain large amounts of voltage-gated sodium channels and allow enough sodium into the axon to regenerate the action potential. Each time the action potential reaches a node of Ranvier, it is restored to its original action potential (+35 mV). When a peripheral fiber is severed, the myelin sheath provides a track along which regrowth can occur. However, the myelin layer does not ensure a perfect regeneration of the nerve fiber. Some regenerated nerve fibers do not find the correct muscle fibers, and some damaged motor neurons of the peripheral nervous system die without regrowth. Damage to the myelin sheath and nerve fiber is often associated with increased functional insufficiency. Unmyelinated fibers and myelinated axons of the mammalian central nervous system do not regenerate. Some studies have revealed that optic nerve fibers can be regenerated in postnatal rats. This regeneration depends upon two conditions: axonal die-back has to be prevented with appropriate neurotrophic factors, and neurite growth inhibitory components have to be inactivated. These studies may lead to fuher understanding of nerve fiber regeneration in the central nervous system. Ref: Ganong&; s review of medical physiology, 23rd edition, Page no: 82",

Dorsal horn neurons receive sensory information from primary afferents that innervate the skin and deeper tissues of the body and that respond to specific types of noxious and non-noxious stimuli. These afferents terminate in the dorsal horn with a distribution pattern that is determined by their sensory modality and the region of the body that they innervate. The incoming information is processed by complex circuits involving excitatory and inhibitory interneurons and transmitted to projection neurons for relay to several brain areas.

In this procedure, the two points on a pair of calipers are simultaneously positioned on the skin and one determines the minimum distance between the two caliper points that can be perceived as separate points of stimulation. This is called the two-point discrimination threshold. If the distance is very small, each caliper point touches the receptive field of only one sensory neuron. If the distance between stimulation points is less than this threshold, only one point of stimulation can be felt. Thus, the two-point discrimination threshold is a measure of tactile acuity. The magnitude of two-point discrimination thresholds varies from place to place on the body and is smallest where touch receptors are most abundant. Stimulus points on the back, for instance, must be separated by at least 65 mm before they can be distinguished as separate, whereas on the fingeips two stimuli are recognized if they are separated by as little as 2 mm. Blind individuals benefit from the tactile acuity of fingeips to facilitate the ability to read Braille; the dots forming Braille symbols are separated by 2. 5 mm.

Neurons from these areas send signals to (2) the raphe magnus nucleus, a thin midline nucleus located in the lower pons and upper medulla, and the nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis, located laterally in the medulla.
