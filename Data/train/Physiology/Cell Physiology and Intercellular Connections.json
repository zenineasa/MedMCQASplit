The vulnerability is different even within neuronal populations. A brief period of global brain ischemia causes cell death in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons days after reperfusion. Other neurons, such as parietal cortical or hippocampal CA3, are much less vulnerable. This phenomenon in commonly referred to as delayed neuronal death. A similar phenomenon occurs after ischemic injury in humans. Prolonged ischemia extends the area of neuronal death to the caudate and thalamic nuclei.

There are following types of membrane proteins : -Integral (Transmembrane or intrinsic) Proteins : -These proteins pass 'through and through', i.e., they run (span) the entire length of lipid bilayer. Integral proteins are globular and amphipathic, consisting of two hy drophilic ends separated by an intervening hydrophobic region that traverses the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. Integral proteins interact by non-polar (hydrophobic) interacts with the fatty acyl groups of phospholipids in the cell membrane and require the use of detergents for their solubilization. Integral proteins are asymmetrically distributed across the membrane bi layer.Integral proteins function as channels (pores), receptors, ion pumps, carrier proteins and enzyme.Peripheral (Extrinsic) proteinsPeripheral proteins are present on the surface of the membrane and do not penetrate all the way through. They are located on both surface of membrane, outer and inner. Peripheral proteins do not interact directly with the phospholipid in the bilayer. They bound to the hydrophilic regions of the transmembrane proteins through electrostatic and hydrogen bonds. However, some (not all) proteins bind to membrane via a covalentently attached lipid anchor, i.e., interaction with polar (hydrophilic) lipid head groups in the membrane,As they do not interact directly with hydrophobic core of phospholipids, they do not require use of detergents for their release. They can be released by treatment with salt solutions of high ionic strength. Peripheral proteins serve as cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that anchor cells to neighboring cells and to basal lamina.

Lysosomes bud off from trans (concave) face of the Golgi apparatus. Lysosomal enzymes are synthesized in rough ER and then processed by Golgi apparatus.o The marker enzyme of for lysosome is acid phosphatase. Other enzymes found in lysosome (but are not markers) are ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease, glucosidase, arylsuIfatase9 collagenase and cathepsins.o The lysosomes that pinched off from Golgi complex are called primary lysosomes. After a primary lysosome has fused with the vacuole or vesicle containing the material to be digested, it forms the secondary lysosome. After the process of digestion has been completed, a secondary lysosome forms the residual body.o The residual body generally discharges its contents by exocytosis. Sometimes, however, residual bodies containing some indigestible substances may be retained in the cell. Such collections of residual bodies gradually increase with age, and are believed to contribute to impairment of physiological function associated with the process of aging.o Autophagy is the process by which cells sequester and degrade their own cytoplasmic organelles. During the process, autophagic vacuole is formed, which is a bilayer vacule containing unnecessary or dysfunctional organelle. Autophagic vacule fuses with lysosome to form autophagosome (autophagolysosome). Then, hydrolytic enzymes of lysosome degrade the organelle of autophagic vacuole.",
