At high pressures in the sea, the pressure over the body is balanced by the compressed air delivered to the lungs and the N2 stays dissolved in the tissues, more in fat than in other compaments.

At 3000 m (approximately 10, 000 ft) above sea level, the alveolar PO2 is about 60 mm Hg and there is enough hypoxic stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors to definitely increase ventilation. As one ascends higher, the alveolar PO2 falls less rapidly and the alveolar PCO2 declines somewhat because of the hyperventilation. The resulting fall in aerial PCO2 produces respiratory alkaloids.

This results in the water surface to contract producing surface tension.* Thus the water molecules lining the alveoli produce an elastic contractile force due to surface tension which causes the alveoli to collapse.* This surface tension force of water molecules is broken by surfactant (a mixture of phospholipids, proteins and ions, most important phospholipid of which is dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl-choline-DPCC). It is secreted by type II alveolar epithelial cells and lines the alveoli.* The phospholipid molecules have a hydrophilic head and two parallel hydrophobic 'tails''. Thus only head part of the molecule dissolves in the fluid lining the alveolar surface and the hydrophobic tails face the alveolar lumen. This new surface thus formed of the surfactant has a significantly reduced surface tension than the water molecules.",

Lung failure occurs when conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis produce alveolar-capillary block, or there is ventilation-perfusion imbalance. Pump failure can be due to fatigue of the respiratory muscles in conditions in which the work of breathing is increased or to a variety of mechanical defects such as pneumothorax or bronchial obstruction that limit ventilation.

Important points to be noted in compliance curve are: The curve has inspiratory and expiratory components. Note that the inspiratory and expiratory compliance curves do not coincide. This difference is called hysteresis. The difference between the inflation and the deflation paths--hysteresis--exists because a greater transpulmonary pressure is required to open a previously closed airway, owing to a deficit of surfactant at the air-water interface, than to keep an open airway from closing, reflecting abundant surfactant.

        "exp": "Ans. B. Decreased Carbon Dioxide. Curve Shown Is the Oxygen Hemoglobin Dissociation Curvea. The oxygen-hemoglobins dissociation curve, also called the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve or oxygen dissociation curve (ODC), is a curve that plots the proportion of hemoglobin in its saturated (oxygen-laden) form on the vertical axis against the prevailing oxygen tension on the horizontal axis. b. This curve is an important tool for understanding how our blood carries and releases oxygen. c. Specifically, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve relates oxygen saturation (SO2 ) and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PO2 ), and is determined by what is called \"hemoglobin affinity for oxygen\"; that is, how readily hemoglobin acquires and releases oxygen molecules into the fluid that surrounds it. d. Hemoglobin (Hb), a globular protein, is the primary vehicle for transporting oxygen in the blood. Oxygen is also carried dissolved in the blood's plasma, but to a much lesser degree. e. Hemoglobin is contained in erythrocytes, more commonly referred to as red blood cells. Under certain conditions, oxygen bound to the hemoglobin is released into the blood's plasma and absorbed into the tissues. Each hemoglobin molecule has the capacity to carry four oxygen molecules. f. How much of that capacity is filled by oxygen at any time is called the oxygen saturation. Expressed as a percentage, the oxygen saturation is the ratio of the amount of oxygen bound to the hemoglobin, to the oxygen-carrying capacity of the hemoglobin. g. The oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin is determined by the type of hemoglobin present in the blood. The amount of oxygen bound to the hemoglobin at any time is related, in large part, to the partial pressure of oxygen to which the hemoglobin is exposed. h. In the lungs, at the alveolar-capillary interface, the partial pressure of oxygen is typically high, and therefore the oxygen binds readily to hemoglobin that is present. i. As the blood circulates to other body tissue in which the partial pressure of oxygen is less, the hemoglobin releases the oxygen into the tissue because the hemoglobin cannot maintain its full bound capacity of oxygen in the presence of lower oxygen partial pressures.

Plasma is about 1. 8 times as viscous as water, whereas whole blood is 3 to 4 times as viscous as water. Thus, viscosity depends for the most part on the hematocrit, that is, the percentage of the volume of blood occupied by red blood cells. The effect of viscosity in vivo deviates from that predicted by the Poiseuille- Hagen formula (R=8hL/pr4).# In large vessels, increases in hematocrit cause appreciable increases in viscosity. In severe polycythemia, the increase in resistance does increase the work of the heart. Conversely, in marked anemia, peripheral resistance is decreased, in part because of the decline in viscosity.# Of course, the decrease in hemoglobin decreases the O2-carrying ability of the blood. but the improved blood flow due to the decrease in viscosity partially compensates for this.# Ordinarily, arterial blood has a pH of about 7. 41, and as the blood acquires carbon dioxide in the tissue capillaries, the pH falls to a venous value of about 7. 37. In other words, a pH change of 0. 04 unit takes place.

The functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the volume of air that remains in the lungs at the end of each normal expiration, is important to lung function. Because its value changes markedly in some types of pulmonary disease, it is often desirable to measure this capacity. The spirometer cannot be used in a direct way to measure the functional residual capacity, because the air in the residual volume of the lungs cannot be expired into the spirometer, and this volume constitutes about one half of the functional residual capacity. To measure functional residual capacity, the spirometer must be used in an indirect manner, usually by means of a helium dilution method. LUNG VOLUMES Lung Volume. Definition. Normal value1.

Plasma proteins are effective buffers because both their free carboxyl and their free amino groups dissociate. The second buffer system is provided by the dissociation of the imidazole groups of the histidine residues in hemoglobin. In the pH 7. 0-7. 7 range, the free carboxyl and amino groups of hemoglobin contribute relatively little to its buffering capacity. However, the hemoglobin molecule contains 38 histidine residues, and on this basis--plus the fact that hemoglobin is present in large amounts--the hemoglobin in blood has six times the buffering capacity of the plasma proteins. In addition, the action of hemoglobin is unique because the imidazole groups of deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) dissociate less than those of oxyhemoglobin (Hb. O2), making Hb a weaker acid and therefore a better buffer than HBO. Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology Twenty-Third Edition Page no: 614",

They initially breathed 2. 5% CO2 in oxygen for 75 breaths. Ventilatory parameters of the last 10 breaths were used as controls. In 7 subsequent test sessions each lasting 2 min alternating with 2 min free breathing periods, subjects tried to achieve a target ventilation ranging from 0. 7 to 1. 3 times the control with a visual feedback system. End-tidal CO2 was regulated automatically at the control level by changing the inspired CO2. Breathing discomfo was measured at the end of each session using a visual analog scale. Isocapnic constraining of ventilation (0. 7 times the control) during exercise significantly increased respiratory discomfo (p < 0. 05). Increases in ventilation had no significant effect. These results indicate that respiratory discomfo during exercise is exaggerated when the level of ventilation falls below that spontaneously adopted even when chemical drives are held constant.

From plasma, the CO2 enters the RBCs. In the RBCs, CO2 combines with water to form carbonic acid. The reaction inside RBCs is very rapid. The rapid formation of carbonic acid inside the RBCs is due to the presence of an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase. This enzyme accelerates the reaction, carbonic anhydrase is present only inside the RBCs and not in plasma. This is why the carbonic acid formation is at least 200 to 300 times more in the RBCs than in plasma. The carbonic acid is very unstable. Almost all carbonic acid (99. 9%) formed in red- blood corpuscles dissociates into bicarbonates and hydrogen ions. The concentration of bicarbonates ions in the cell increases more and more.

A note on respiratory ramp signal: The neuron signals transmitted to the inspiratory muscle, mainly the diaphragm, is not the instantaneous burst of action potentials. Instead, it begins weakly and increases steadily in a ramped manner. The advantage of the ramp is that it causes a steady increase in the volume of the lungs during inspiration, rather than inspiratory gasps. Control of the limiting point at which the ramp suddenly ceases is the mechanism by which the respiratory centers control depth and rate of respiration.

During normal quiet breathing, all respiratory muscle contraction occurs during inspiration; expiration is almost entirely a passive process caused by elastic recoil of the lungs and chest cage. Thus, under resting conditions, the respiratory muscles normally perform \"work\" to cause inspiration but not to cause expiration. The work of inspiration can be divided into three fractions:(1) that required to expand the lungs against the lung and chest elastic forces, called compliance work or elastic work;(2) that required to overcome the viscosity of the lung and chest wall structures, called tissue resistance work; and(3) that required to overcome airway resistance to movement of air into the lungs, called airway resistance work. Mechanics of Pulmonary Ventilation. Muscles That Cause Lung Expansion and Contraction. The lungs can be expanded and contracted in two ways: (1) by downward and upward movement of the diaphragm to lengthen or shorten the chest cavity, and (2) by elevation and depression of the ribs to increase and decrease the anteroposterior diameter of the chest cavity. Normal quiet breathing is accomplished almost entirely by the first method, that is, by movement of the diaphragm. During inspiration, contraction of the diaphragm pulls the lower surfaces of the lungs downward. Then, during expiration, the diaphragm simply relaxes, and the elastic recoil of the lungs, chest wall, and abdominal structures compresses the lungs and expels the air. During heavy breathing, All the muscles that elevate the chest cage are classified as muscles of inspiration, and those muscles that depress the chest cage are classified as muscles of expiration. The most important muscles that raise the rib cage are the external intercostals, but others that help are the (1) sternocleidomastoid muscles, which lift upward on the sternum; (2) anterior serrati, which lift many of the ribs; and (3) scaleni, which lift the first two ribs. The muscles that pull the rib cage downward during expiration are mainly the (1) abdominal recti, which have the powerful effect of pulling downward on the lower ribs at the same time that they and other abdominal muscles also compress the abdominal contents upward against the diaphragm, and (2) internal intercostals.",

Hg during hyperbaric exposure to oxygen at 0. 3 MPa (three ATA). At one ATA* of pressure (the standard air pressure or sea level), the partial pressure of oxygen in alveolar air amounts to about 673 mm of mercury (mm. Hg). However, when a person is placed in a hyperbaric chamber and delivered pure oxygen 3 ATA or 2280 mm. Hg the alveolar oxygen pressure increases to 2193 mm. Hg. Theoretically, arterial and tissue oxygen pressure closely follow alveolar oxygen pressure. This is dramatic increase in the amount of oxygen going into the blood. When the body is at rest, it normally consumes about 6 ml of oxygen per 100 ml of blood, but of this amount only 0. 3 ml is transported by the hemoglobin in the red blood cells. When the hyperbaric pressure is raised to 2 ATA of pure hyperbaric oxygen therapy. At 3 ATA approximately 6. 4 volumes per cent of oxygen are physically dissolved in the plasma, which is sufficient to sustain life even in the absence of hemoglobin. Exposure to 100% O2 at 2 - 3 atm can increased dissolved O2 in arterial blood to the point that arterial O2 tension is greater than 2000 mg. Hg and tissue 02 tension is 400 mm. Hg (654- Ganong 244).

The two most important acquired hemoglobinopathies are carbon monoxide poisoning and methemoglobinemia. CO has a higher affinity for hemoglobin than does oxygen; it can replace oxygen and diminish O2 delivery. Chronic elevation of carboxyhemoglobin levels to 10 or 15%, as occurs in smokers, can lead to secondary polycythemia. Carboxyhemoglobin is cherry red in color and masks the development of cyanosis usually associated with poor O2 delivery to tissues. HEMOGLOBIN# Hemoglobin is composed of four polypeptide subunits (2 alpha, 2 beta) and exists in two forms--T (taut) form has low affinity for oxygen and R (released) form has high affinity for oxygen.# Hemoglobin exhibits positive cooperativity and negative allostery (accounts for the sigmoid-shaped 02 dissociation curve for hemoglobin), unlike myoglobin.# Carbon monoxide has a 257 times greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen.# Oxygen dissociation curve of Hb is sigmoid in shape indicating that subunits co-operate in binding oxygen, which results from the fact that binding of oxygen molecule at one heme increases the oxygen affinity or remaining heme groups in the same Hb molecule. The net effects that the affinity of Hb for last oxygen bound is approximately 300-fold greater than affinity of first oxygen bound.# 2-3 BPG is essential for normal transport function of Hb, e. g., storing blood in acid citrate dextrose (formerly used medium) leads to decreased 2, 3 BPG in RBCs and such blood displays an abnormally high oxygen affinity, acting virtually as an oxygen \"trap\" rather than oxygen transport system, failing to unload properly its bound oxygen in tissues. However, decrease in 2-3 BPG can be prevented by adding Inosine to storage medium as it can enter RBC where it is converted to 2, 3 BPG. Hb.

But angiotensin II mainly acts on blood vessels, kidney and adrenal cortex. Actions of angiotensin II are -# Vasoconstriction: - The most prominent action of agniotensin II.# Increased secretion of aldosterone from zona glomerulosa of adrenal cortex. Aldosterone cause Na+ retention.# Kidney: - Angiotensin II constricts both afferent and efferent arterioles, thereby reducing both GFR and RBF. However, the efferent arterioles are more sensitive to angiotensin II. Hence, angiotensin II causes greater constriction of the efferent arterioles, thereby increasing the filtration fraction. There is ncreased Na+ and water reabsorption as a result of increased aldosterone and ADH secretion, as well as by direct effect of angiotensin II in increasing Na+ reabsorption in proximal tubules, loop of Henle, distal tubules and collecting tubules.# Central effects: - Angiotensin II acts through angiotensin receptors present in the subfornical organ (SFO) and organ vasculosum of lamina terminalis to increase thirst. Angiotensin II also acts on area postrena of the brain to bring about an increased sympathetic discharge that causes increased release of norepinephrine in postganglionic sympathetic neurons.",

The primary stimulus for the central chemoreceptors is an increase in the hydrogen ion concentration. Stimulation of central chemoreceptors by increased hydrogen ion concentration leads to excitation of the respiratory neurons, thereby producing an increase in the rate and depth of respiration.* Although the primary stimulus for central chemoreceptors is an increase in hydrogen ion concentration, in actual practice the physiological stimulus is an increase in PCO2. The reason is that hydrogen ions cannot cross blood - brain barrier. Therefore, a change in the blood hydrogen ion concentration does not change the hydrogen ion concentration in the immediate vicinity of the chemosensitive neurons (i. e., in CSF and brain interstitial fluid). On the other hand, CO2 being lipid soluble can easily cross blood brain barrier. It enters the brain, where it is hydrated to give rise to H+ and HCO2 ions. Now these H+ directly stimulate the central chemoreceptors.* Thus, central chemoreceptors are directly stimulated by an increase in H+ concentration in CSF and brain inerstitial tissue, which is brought about by change in arterial PCO2 (Pa. CO2).* Change in CSF & Brain interstial tissue - | H+ concentration (Primary direct stimulus).* Change in Blood - | PCO2 (Actual physiological stimulus).* Central chemoreceptors are not stimulated by hypoxia; rather like any other cells, they are depressed by hypoxia. Peripheral chemoreceptors* The peripheral chemoreceptors which regulate respiration are located in the carotid body and aortic bodies. These bodies are located in the connective tissue associated with the vessel wall, at the bifurcation of the common carotid, and on the arch of aorta, respectively. The characteristic cells of both these structures are called glomus cells. Type I glomus cells have a high dopamine content, which they possibly employ as a neurotransmetter. Peripheral chemoreceptors convey information to the DRG of neurons in medulla, for which purpose the afferent neurons from the carotid bodies pass through glossopharyngeal nerve and from the aortic bodies pass through vagus nerve.* The most potent natural stimulus for peripheral chemoreceptors is low arterial PO2 (hypoxic hypoxia). The other stimuli which activate peripheral chemoreceptors are high arterial PCO2, and an increase in arterial hydrogen ion concentration (acidosis or low pH). The response to activation of peripheral chemoreceptors is an increase in pulmonary ventilation through an increase in the rate and depth of breathing.* It is good to keep in mind that stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors not only stimulates medullary respiratory centers but also medullary vasomotor center. Therefore, the response to their stimulation is tachycardia, vasoconstriction and increase BP, along with hyperventilation.",

        "exp": "Pleural pressure is the pressure of the fluid in the narrow space between the lung and the chest wall pleura which is normally a slight suction, which means a slightly negative pressure. There are no attachments between the lung and the walls of the chest cage except where it is suspended at its hilum from the mediastinum. Instead, the lung literally floats in the thoracic cavity. Fuhermore, continual suction of excessive fluid into lymphatic channels maintain a slight suction between the visceral surface of the lung pleura and the parietal pleural surface of the thoracic cavity. Therefore, the lungs are held to the thoracic wall as if glued there, except that they can slide freely, well lubricated as the chest expands and contracts. A concept from Boron&; s physiology/2nd Ed/ 630 The interaction between lungs and chest wall does not occur by direct attachment but through the intrapleural space between the visceral and parietal pleurae. This space is filled with a small amount of pleural fluid and is extremely thin (5 to 30 micrometer). Because the lungs and chest wall pull away from each other on opposite sides of the intrapleural space, the intrapleural pressure (PIP) is less than barometric pressure (PB); that is; the intrapleural space is a relative vacuum. Although the designation P implies that we are referring exclusively to the intrapleural space, this description is not entirely accurate. Indeed, in addition to the intrapleural space, PIP is probably similar to the pressure in several other regions of the chest cavity. The viual space between the chest wall or diaphragm and the parietal pleura. The viual space between the lung and the visceral pleura. The interstitial space that surrounds all pulmonary airways.

Surfactant is a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins (Table 35-2). If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. In spherical structures like the alveoli, the distending pressure equals two times the tension divided by the radius (P = 2T/r); if T is not reduced as r is reduced, the tension overcomes the distending pressure. Surfactant also helps to prevent pulmonary edema. It has been calculated that if it were not present, the unopposed surface tension in the alveoli would produce a 20 mm Hg force oring transudation of fluid from the blood into the alveoli.

Lung compliance is an index of lung distensibility or the ease with which the lungs are expanded; thus, compliance is the inverse of elastic recoil. Compliance is defined as the ratio of change of lung volume to the change in pressure required to inflate the lung (dV/dP). Compliance decreases in patients with pulmonary edema or surfactant deficiency and increases when there is a loss of elastic fibers in the lungs, such as occurs in patients with emphysema and with aging. MECHANICS OF BREATHING - Compliance of the lungs & chest wall# Curve of airway pressure plotted against volume, is relaxation pressure curve of the total respiratory system.# The pressure is zero at a lung volume that corresponds to the volume of gas in the lungs at the end of quiet expiration (relaxation volume, which equals the functional residual capacity).# It is positive at greater volumes and negative at smaller volumes. The change in lung volume per unit change in the airway pressure (DV/DP) is the stretchability (compliance) of the lungs and chest wall. Q# It is normally measured in the pressure range where the relaxation pressure curve is steepest, and the normal value is approximately 0. 2 L/cm H2O.# The curve is shifted downward and to the right (compliance is decreased) by pulmonary congestion and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis; pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disease of unknown cause in which there is stiffening and scarring of the lung.# The curve is shifted upward and to the left (compliance is increased) in emphysema.# It should be noted that compliance is a static measure of lung and chest recoil.# Two major forces contribute to lung compliance: o tissue elastic forces ando surface tension forces.

It is characterized by headache, irritability, insomnia, breathlessness, and nausea and vomiting. Its cause is unsettled, but it appears to be associated with cerebral edema. The low PO2 at high altitude causes aeriolar dilation, and if cerebral autoregulation does not compensate, there is an increase in capillary pressure that ors increased transudation of fluid into brain tissue. Individuals who do not develop mountain sickness have a diuresis at high altitude, and urine volume is decreased in individuals who develop the condition. High-altitude illness includes not only mountain sickness but also two more serious syndromes that complicate it: high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. In high-altitude cerebral edema, the capillary leakage in mountain sickness progresses to frank brain swelling, with ataxia, disorientation, and in some cases coma and death due to herniation of the brain through the tentorium. High-altitude pulmonary edema is a patchy edema of the lungs that is related to the marked pulmonary hypertension that develops at high altitude. It has been argued that it occurs because not all pulmonary aeries have enough smooth muscle to constrict in response to hypoxia, and in the capillaries supplied by those aeries, the general rise in pulmonary aerial pressure causes a capillary pressure increase that disrupts their walls (stress failure).

Types of compliance measurements: Static compliance: This is the measurement made without taking into account the effect of the different phases of respiration. Dynamic compliance: Compliance measurement during the difference phases of respiratory. So it's a measure of static compliance (lungs and chest wall stiffness) plus airway resistance = impedance of lung Specific compliance = Compliance/FRC Reduced compliance is caused by: Increased fibrous tissue in the lung (pulmonary fibrosis) Decreased surfactant or increased surface tension Presence of air (pneumothorax), excess fluid (pleural effusion), or blood (hemothorax) in the intrapleural space Alveolar edema, which prevents the inflation of some alveoli Atelectasis (collapse) Increased pulmonary venous pressure a lung becomes engorged with blood An increased compliance occurs in pulmonary emphysema normal aging lung In both instances, an alteration in the elastic tissue in the lung is probably responsible.
