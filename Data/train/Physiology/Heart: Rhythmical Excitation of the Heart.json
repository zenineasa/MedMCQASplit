        "exp": "ANSWER: (D) Purkinje fibersREF: Guyton's physiology 22nd edition page 105Velocity of Signal Conduction in Cardiac Muscle:The velocity of conduction of the excitatory action potential signal along both atrial and ventricular muscle fibers is about 0.3 to 0.5 m/sec, or about 1/250 the velocity in very large nerve fibers and about 1/10 the velocity in skeletal muscle fibers. The velocity of conduction in the specialized heart conductive system-in the Purkinje fibers-is as great as 4 m/sec in most parts of the system, which allowTs reasonably rapid conduction of the excitatory signal to the different parts of the heart",

They are (1) fast sodium channels, (2) slow sodium-calcium channels, and (3) potassium channels/* Opening of the fast sodium channels gfor a few lO.OOOths of a second is responsible for the rapid upstroke spike of the action potential observed in ventricular muscle, because of rapid influx of positive sodium ions to the interior of the fiber.Then the \"plateau '' of the ventricular action potential is caused primarily by slower opening of the slow sodium- calcium channels1* which lasts for about 0.3 second.Ta2+ influx through more slowly opening of Ca2+ channel produces the plateau phase - Ganong 23nd/491Finally, opening of potassium channels allows diffusion of large amounts of positive potassium ions in the outward direction through the fiber membrane and returns the membrane potential to its resting level",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., SA node Automaticityo Cells of the conductive system also possess automaticity, i.e., the capability of spontaneous excitation,o However, the rate at which different parts of conductive system discharge impulses is not the same,o The SA node discharges impulses at fastest rateQ, hence the rate at which SA node fires determines the heart rate, therefore, SA node is normal pacemaker of the heartQ, i.e., it determines the pace of the heart,o The AV node has the next highest automaticity after SA node; therefore, if the SA node stops discharging, the AV node takes over the role of cardiac pacemaker.o The automaticity' of the SA node, being the highest, paces the excitatory' drive to all other cardiac fibers, suppressing their intrinsic automaticity. This phenomenon of suspension of pacemaker activity in cells other than those of the SA node is called overide suppression. Overide suppression occurs because an impulse originating in the SA node spreads throughout the heart by means of the conduction system and results in sequential contraction of different cardiac chambers. Before an impulse from AV node or other parts of conduction system can initiate impuse, the next impulse from the SA node is discharged because its rate of discharge is highest, i.e., before other parts of conducting system can generate their own impulse, they are overwhelmed by the wave of impulse generated and coming from the SA node.TissueRate o f impulse generationSA nodeAV nodeBundle of HisPurkinje system70-80/minute (Highest)40-60/minute40/minute24/minite",
