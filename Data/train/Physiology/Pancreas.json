GLUT4 is the insulin-regulated glucose transporter found primarily in adipose tissues and striated muscle (skeletal and cardiac). The first evidence for this distinct glucose transport protein was provided by David James in 1988. The gene that encodes GLUT4 was clone and mapped in 1989. c. Recent reports demonstrated the presence of GLUT4 gene in central nervous system such as the hippocampus. Moreover, impairment in insulin-stimulated trafficking of GLUT4 in the hippocampus result in decreased metabolic activities and plasticity of hippocampal neurons, which leads to depressive like behaviour and cognitive dysfunction.

It is produced by pancreatic beta cells, packaged within beta-cell granules in a concentration 1-2% that of insulin and co-secreted with insulin in a pulsatile manner and in response to physiologic secretory stimuli. The physiologic effect of amylin may be to modulate insulin release by acting as a negative feedback on insulin secretion. At pharmacologic doses, amylin reduces glucagon secretion, slows gastric emptying by a vagally medicated mechanism, and centrally decreases appetite. \"--Katzung 12/e p763. Islet Cells. Content.
