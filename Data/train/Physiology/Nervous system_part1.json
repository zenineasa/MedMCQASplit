The coicospinal tract conducts impulses from the brain to the spinal cord. It is made up of a lateral and anterior tract. The coicospinal tract is involved in voluntary movement. The majority of fibres of the coicospinal tract cross over in the medulla, resulting in muscles being controlled by the opposite side of the brain. The coicospinal tract also contains Betz cells (the largest pyramidal cells), which are not found in any other region of the body. The nerves within the coicospinal tract are involved in movement of muscles of the body. Because of the crossing-over of fibres, muscles are supplied by the side of the brain opposite to that of the muscle.

        "exp": "The baroreflex or baroreceptor reflex is one of the body's homeostatic mechanisms that help to maintain blood pressure at nearly constant levels. The baroreflex provides a rapid negative feedback loop in which an elevated blood pressure reflexively causes the heart rate to decrease and also causes blood pressure to decrease. Decreased blood pressure decreases baroreflex activation and causes heart rate to increase and to restore blood pressure levels. The baroreflex can begin to act in less than the duration of a cardiac cycle (fractions of a second) and thus baroreflex adjustments are key factors in dealing with postural hypotension, the tendency for blood pressure to decrease on standing due to gravity. The baroreceptors are stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors. At low pressures, baroreceptors become inactive. When blood pressure rises, the carotid and aoic sinuses are distended fuher, resulting in increased stretch and, therefore, a greater degree of activation of the baroreceptors. At normal resting blood pressures, many baroreceptors are actively repoing blood pressure information and the baroreflex is actively modulating autonomic activity. Active baroreceptors fire action potentials (\"spikes\") more frequently. The greater the stretch the more rapidly baroreceptors fire action potentials. Many individual baroreceptors are inactive at normal resting pressures and only become activated when their stretch or pressure threshold is exceeded.

However, a more careful look revealsmany more small fibers lying between the large ones. The large fibers are myelinated, and the small ones are unmyelinated. The average nerve trunk contains about twice asmany unmyelinated fibers as myelinated fibers. The central core of the fiber is the axon, and the membrane of the axon is the membrane that actually conducts the action potential. The axon is filled in its center with axoplasm, which is a viscid intracellular fluid. Surrounding the axon is a myelin sheath that is often much thicker than the axon itself. About once every 1 to 3 millimeters along the length of the myelin sheath is a node of Ranvier. The myelin sheath is deposited around the axon by Schwann cells in the following manner: The membrane of a Schwann cell first envelops the axon. The Schwann cellthen rotates around the axon many times, laying down multiple layers of Schwann cell membrane containing the lipid substance sphingomyelin. This substance is an excellent electrical insulator that decreases ion flow through the membrane about 5000-fold. At the juncture between each two successive Schwann cells along the axon, a small uninsulated area only 2 to 3 micrometers in length remains where ions still can flow with ease through the axon membrane between the extracellular fluid and the intracellular fluid inside the axon. This area is called the node of Ranvier. Ref: Guyton and Hall textbook medical physiology, 13th edition.",

The flexion can be explained by Rubio spinal excitation of flexor muscles in the upper extremities; the hyperextension of lower extremities is due to the same changes that occur after mid-collicular decerebration. Decoicate rigidity is seen on the hemiplegic side in humans after hemorrhages or thromboses in the internal capsule. Probably because of their anatomy, the small aeries in the internal capsule are especially prone to rupture or thrombotic obstruction, so this type of decoicate rigidity is fairly common. Sixty percent of intracerebral hemorrhages occur in the internal capsule, as opposed to 10% in the cerebral coex, 10% in the pons, 10% in the thalamus, and 10% in the cerebellum.

On top of crista is cupula. Into the cupula are projected hundreds of cilia from hair cells where bending of cupula in one direction causes repolarization of the hair cells, whereas bending it in the opposite direction hyperpolarises the hair cells. Then from the hair cells, appropriate signals are sent by way from the vestibular nerve to apprise the central nervous system of a change in rotation of head and rate of change in each of the three planes of space.

The relief may be due to the simultaneous activation of innocuous cutaneous mechanoreceptors whose afferents emit collaterals that terminate in the dorsal horn.

This is called the gate-control mechanism of pain modulation and it serves as the rationale behind the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for pain relief.

This makes sense, because with a fight or flight response, heart rate increases, as a consequence of:# | Conduction velocity (Positive dromotropic)# | Refractory period (so that cardiac tissue becomes excitable in a shorter span on time)2. Blood vessels* Stimulation of cq receptors cause vasoconstriction. Stimulation of b2 receptors cause vasodilation. Vasoconstriction (a1 receptors) predominate in skin, mucosal, renal and sphlanchnic blood vessels. Dilatation (b2 receptors) predominate in skeletal muscles, liver and coronary blood vessels. The direct effect on cerebral vessels is not prominent - blood flow through this bed parallels change in BP. Renal vessels contain bothaI (vasoconstriction) and (vasodilatiator) receptor. Therefore sympathetic stimulation cause less increase in vascular resistance as compared to other sites where sympathetic stimulation causes vasconstriction. 3. Urinary system* Relaxation of detrusor (b2 action) and contraction of trigone (a1 action) - urinary retention. 4. GIT* Relaxation of smooth muscles by direct action of b2 receptors and indirect action of a2 receptors (a2 receptors decrease the release of ACH by acting presynaptically on cholinergic neurons). 5. Respiratory system* Bronchial smooth muscles have b2 receptors but no sympathetic supply. b2 receptor agonists (exogenous drugs) can cause bronchodilation. There is vasoconstriction of mucosal blood vessels of respiratory tract - further increase in diameter of bronchus. Overall there is decrease in resistance. 6. Eye* Mydriasis - Due to contraction of radial muscles (Dilator pupillae) of iris by a7 receptors. 7. Genital system* Relaxation of uterus - b2 receptors* Ejaculation - a1 receptors. 8.

Intrafusal fibers do not contribute to the overall contractile force of the muscle, but rather serve a pure sensory function. There are two types of intrafusal fibers in mammalian muscle spindles. The first type contains many nuclei in a dilated central area and is called a nuclear bag fiber (Figure 9-2B). There are two subtypes of nuclear bag fibers, dynamic and static. Typically, there are two or three nuclear bag fibers per spindle. The second intrafusal fiber type, the nuclear chain fiber, is thinner and shoer and lacks a definite bag. Each spindle has about five of these fibers. There are two kinds of sensory endings in each spindle, a single primary (group Ia) ending and up to eight secondary (group II) endings. The Ia afferent fiber wraps around the center of the dynamic and static nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers. Group II sensory fibers are located adjacent to the centers of the static nuclear bag and nuclear chain fibers; these fibers do not innervate the dynamic nuclear bag fibers. Ia afferents are very sensitive to the velocity of the change in muscle length during a stretch (dynamic response); thus they provide information about the speed of movements and allow for quick corrective movements. The steady-state (tonic) activity of group Ia and II afferents provide information on steady-state length of the muscle (static response). The top trace in Figure 9-2C shows the dynamic and static components of activity in an Ia afferent during muscle stretch. Note that they discharge most rapidly while the muscle is being stretched (shaded). Ref: Ganong&; s review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 158",

Guyton physiology 11th ed., 541)ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS AND HIGH-ALTITUDE CEREBRAL & PULMONARY EDEMAA small percentage of people who ascend rapidly to high altitudes become acutely sick and can die if not given oxygen or removed to a low altitude. The sickness begins from a few hours up to about 2 days after ascent. Two events frequently occur:# Acute cerebral edema- This is believed to result from -# Hypoxia > causing Local vasodilation of the cerebral blood vessels.# Dilation of the arterioles increases blood flow into the capillaries, thus increasing capillary pressure# Increase in capillary pressure in turn causes fluid to leak into the cerebral tissues.- The cerebral edema can then lead to severe disorientation and other effects related to cerebral dysfunction.# Acute pulmonary edema- The severe hypoxia causes the pulmonary arterioles to constrict potently, but the constriction is much greater in some parts of the lungs than in other parts, so that more and more of the pulmonary blood flow is forced through fewer and fewer still unconstricted pulmonary vessels.- The postulated result is that the capillary pressure in these areas of the lungs becomes especially high and local edema occurs.- Allowing the person to breathe oxygen usually reverses the process within hours. Educational Points: CHRONIC MOUNTAIN SICKNESSOccasionally, a person who remains at high altitude too long develops chronic mountain sickness, in which the following effects occur: 1) The red cell mass and hematocrit become exceptionally high (*erythropoietin**hematocrit and Hb (chronic hypoxia)2) The pulmonary arterial pressure becomes elevated even more than the normal elevation that occurs during acclimatization, 3) The right side of the heart becomes greatly enlarged (Chronic hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction results in RVH). 4) The peripheral arterial pressure begins to fall, 5) Congestive heart failure ensues, and6) Death often follows unless the person is removed to a lower altitude (atmospheric oxygen * Pao2* ventilation * Paco2)7) 2, 3-BPG (binds to Hb so that Hb releases more O2). 8) Cellular changes (*mitochondria). 9) renal excretion of HCO3 - (e. g., can augment by use of acetazolamide) to compensate for the respiratory alkalosis.",

It then travels down the axon through the infundibulum within neurosecretory granules that are found within Herring bodies, localized swellings of the axons and nerve terminals. These carry the peptide directly to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored until released into the blood. However, there are two other sources of AVP with impoant local effects: AVP is also synthesized by magnocellular neurosecretory neurons at the PVN, transpoed and released at the median eminence, which then travels through the hypophyseal poal system to the anterior pituitary where it stimulates coicotropic cells synergistically with CRH to produce ACTH (by itself it is a weak secretagogue).

This principle is called law of projection, e. g., phantom limb & cortical stimulation during neurosurgical procedure on conscious patient. WEBER FESCHNER LAW- Magnitude of sensation felt is proportionate to the log of intensity of the stimulus. BELL-MAGENDIE LAW- The basic unit of integrated reflex activity is the reflex arc. This arc consists of a sense organ, an afferent neuron, one or more synapses, which are generally in a central integrating station, an efferent neuron, and an effector.- The afferent neurons enter via the dorsal roots or cranial nerves and have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia or in the homologous ganglia on the cranial nerves.- Efferent fibers leave via the ventral roots or corresponding motor cranial nerves.- The principle that in the spinal cord the dorsal roots are sensory and the ventral roots are motor is known as the Bell-Magendie law.",

        "question": "In a healthy alert adult sitting with eyes closed, which of the following EEG rhythms will be seen when electrode is placed in occipital region?",
        "exp": "Ans. c. (Alpha waves ) (Ref. Guyton physiology 11th ed., 742)NORMAL SLEEPStage of sleep. Characteristic features1. Stage 1 (5%)EEG: The appearance of theta waves (slow 3 to 7 cycles per second). Disappearance of alpha waves - drowsy (rapid 8 to 12 cycles per second)2. Stage 2 (45%). Longest stage. EEG: K complexes & sleep spindles (very rapid 12 to 14 cycles per second)3. Stage 3 (12. 5%)EEG: appearance of delta waves (slowest < 2 cycles per second). Hardest to arouse. Tends to vanish in the elderly. Stage 3 with stage 4 are called slow wave sleep or delta sleep4. Stage 4 (12. 5%)EEG: continuation of delta wave5. REM sleep (25%)EEG: Saw-tooth waves. REM like SEX: Pulse & Penile/Clitoral arousal, but |with age. Lengthens in time as the night progresses. Increased during the second half of the night. Four simple periodic rhythms recorded in the EEG are alpha, beta, delta, and theta. The four basic rhythms have been associated with various states. Rhythm. Freq (Hz). Amp (mV)alpha8-1320-200beta13-305-10delta1-520-200theta4-810. Alpha: In general, the alpha rhythm is the prominent EEG wave pattern of an adult who is awake but relaxed with eyes closed. Each region of the brain had a characteristic alpha rhythm but alpha waves of the greatest amplitude are recorded from the occipital and parietal regions of the cerebral cortex. In general, amplitudes of alpha waves diminish when subjects open their eyes and are attentive to external stimuli although some subjects trained in relaxation techniques can maintain high alpha amplitudes even with their eyes open. Beta: Beta rhythms occur in individuals who are alert and attentive to external stimuli or exert specific mental effort, or paradoxically, beta rhythms also occur during deep sleep, REM sleep when the eyes switch back and forth. This does not mean that there is less electrical activity, rather that the \"positive\" and \"negative\" activities are starting to counterbalance so that the sum of the electrical activity is less. Thus, instead of getting the wave-like synchronized pattern of alpha waves, desynchronization or alpha block occurs. So, the beta wave represents arousal of the cortex to a higher state of alertness or tension. It may also be associated with \"remembering\" or retrieving memories. Delta and Theta: Delta and theta rhythms are low-frequency EEG patterns that increase during sleep in the normal adult. As people move from lighter to deeper stages of sleep (prior to REM sleep), the occurrence of alpha waves diminish and is gradually replaced by the lower frequency theta and then delta frequency rhythms.

        "question": "Which of the following tactile receptors respond to the vibration sense of 30 - 800 Hz?",
        "exp": "Ans. A. Pacinian corpuscles. (Ref. Guyton Physiology 11th/pg. 587; Ganong 23rd/pg. 121-127, 746). Guyton Physiology 11th/pg. 587......... \"Detection of Vibration: All tactile receptors are involved in detection of vibration, although different receptors detect different frequencies of vibration. Pacinian corpuscles can detect signal vibrations from 30 to 800 cycles per second because they respond extremely rapidly to minute and rapid deformations of the tissues, and they also transmit their signals over type Ab nerve fibers, which can transmit as many as 1000 impulses per second. Low-frequency vibrations from 2 up to 80 cycles per second, in contrast, stimulate other tactile receptors, especially Meissner's corpuscles, which are less rapidly adapting than pacinian corpuscles\". The Ruffini ending is a tonic receptor that produces a train of action potentials proportional to the intensity of pressure applied to the skin. Free nerve endings:# found everywhere in the skin and in many other tissues# Can detect touch and pressure.# For instance, even light contact with the cornea of the eye, which contains no other type of nerve ending besides free nerve endings, can nevertheless elicit touch and pressure sensations. Meissner fs corpuscle:# It is a touch receptor with great sensitivity is the Meissner's corpuscle# It is an elongated encapsulated nerve ending of a large (type Ab) myelinated sensory nerve fiber.# Present in the nonhairy parts of the skin and are particularly abundant in the finger- tips, lips, and other areas of the skin where one's ability to discern spatial locations of touch sensations is highly developed.# Meissner's corpuscles adapt in a fraction of a second after they are stimulated, which means that they are particularly sensitive to movement of objects over the surface of the skin as well as to low- frequency vibration. Merkel's discs:# Merkel's discs are often grouped together in a receptor organ called the Iggo dome receptor, which projects upward against the underside of the epithelium of the skin. This causes the epithelium at this point to protrude outward, thus creating a dome and constituting an extremely sensitive receptor.# Also note that the entire group of Merkel's discs is innervated by a single large myelinated nerve fiber (type Ab).# These receptors, along with the Meissner's corpuscles, play extremely important roles in localizing touch sensations to specific surface areas of the body and in determining the texture of what is felt. Hair end-organ:# Slight movement of any hair on the body stimulates a nerve fiber entwining its base. Thus, each hair and its basal nerve fiber, called the hair end-organ, are also a touch receptor.# This receptor adapts readily and, like Meissner's corpuscles, detects mainly- (a) movement of objects on the surface of the body or- (b) initial contact with the body. Ruffini's end-organs:# Located in the deeper layers of the skin and also in still deeper internal tissues are many Ruffini's end-organs, which are multibranched, encapsulated endings.# These endings adapt very slowly and, therefore, are important for signaling continuous states of deformation of the tissues, such as heavy prolonged touch and pressure signals.# They are also found in joint capsules and help to signal the degree of joint rotation. Pacinian corpuscles:# lie both immediately beneath the skin and deep in the fascial tissues of the body.# They are stimulated only by rapid local compression of the tissues because they adapt in a few hundredths of a second.# Therefore, they are particularly important for detecting tissue vibration or other rapid changes in the mechanical state of the tissues.",

        "exp": "Ans. A. Vestibulocerebellum. (Ref. Guyton & Hall's Textbook of Medical Physiology 11th/pg. 703 - 705). Function of the Cerebellum in Overall Motor Control: The nervous system uses the cerebellum to coordinate motor control functions at three levels, as follows: Part of cerebellum. Consist of. Function1. The vestibulocerebellum. Consists principally of the small flocculonodular cerebellar lobes (that lie under the posterior cerebellum) and adjacent portions of the vermis. It provides neural circuits for most of the body's equilibrium movements. 2. The spinocerebellum. Consists of most of the vermis of the posterior and anterior cerebellum plus the adjacent intermediate zones on both sides of the vermis. It provides the circuitry for coordinating mainly movements of the distal portions of the limbs, especially the hands and fingers. 3. The cerebrocerebellum. Consists of the large lateral zones of the cerebellar hemispheres, lateral to the intermediate zones. It receives virtually all its input from the cerebral motor cortex and adjacent premotor and somatosensory cortices of the cerebrum. It transmits its output information in the upward direction back to the brain, functioning in a feedback manner with the cerebral cortical sensorimotor system to plan sequential voluntary body and limb movements, planning these as much as tenths of a second in advance of the actual movements. This is called development of \"motor imagery\" of movements to be performed. Vestibulocerebellum--Its Function in Association with the Brain Stem and Spinal Cord to Control Equilibrium and. Postural Movements# The vestibulocerebellum originated phylogenetically at about the same time that the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear developed. Furthermore, loss of the flocculonodular lobes and adjacent portions of the vermis of the cerebellum, which constitute the vestibulocerebellum, causes extreme disturbance of equilibrium and postural movements.# The vestibulocerebellum is especially important in controlling balance between agonist and antagonist muscle con- tractions of the spine, hips, and shoulders during rapid changes in body positions as required by the vestibular apparatus.# It is then the function of the vestibulocerebellum to calculate in advance from these rates and directions where the different parts will be during the next few milliseconds. The results of these calculations are the key to the brain's progression to the next sequential movement.",

        "exp": "Ans. a (Alpha) (Ref. Ganong Physiology 22nd/pg. Chapter 11, Fig. 11-8). In a normal adult sitting with eyes closed EEG will show alpha waves. EEG with eyes open & mind wandering shows Beta waves. EEG waves. Key Facts. Alpha# Happen between 8 and 13 times per second, or 8-13 Hertz (Hz).# Alpha represents a sort of \"idle\" state, or \"ready but not doing much\" state and is normally fairly large over the back third of the brain when the eyes are closed and when you are awake.# Alpha disappears when we either get mentally busy (e. g., open the eyes, start doing intense mental work even eyes closed) or when we become drowsy.# Thus the presence of alpha can show the presence of an awake, resting state, # If it is present at a fairly high voltage when the eyes are open, this would usually indicate an inattentive, daydreamy state.# In fact we often see this sign in adolescents and adults with attentional difficulties. Beta waves# The beta family of waves happen at frequencies from 16-40 Hz or higher.# When we get mentally busy and engaged, we should see alpha \"block, \" or reduce significantly in size.# In its place we see mostly smaller, quicker \"beta\" waves. Delta and theta waves# Are relatively slow.# Delta is usually defined as waves occurring from 1-4 times per second (1-4 Hz).# Theta occurs at 4-7 Hz.# During drowsiness, first alpha disappears, then the size of theta waves begins to increase.# As sleep begins, theta waves get quite large, then become mixed with and eventually give way to slower delta waves.# The presence of delta and theta waves in the waking, eyes open EEG is normal, but only if the waves are fairly small.# High-amplitude slow waves can be signs of various neurological and psychological problems, ranging from epilepsy to ADHD. Educational points:# In a typical night of sleep, a young adult first enters NREM sleep, passes through stages 1 and 2, and spends 70-100 minutes in stages 3 and 4.# Sleep then lightens, and an REM period follows. This cycle is repeated at intervals of about 90 minutes throughout the night. The cycles are similar, though there is less stage 3 and 4 sleep and more REM sleep towards morning.# Thus, four to six REM periods occur per night. REM sleep occupies 80% of total sleep time in premature infants and 50% in full-term neonates.# Thereafter, proportion of REM sleep falls rapidly and plateaus at about 25% until it falls further in old age.# In REM, there occurs | and variable pulse, | and variable blood pressure, penile/clitoral tumescence. ACh is the principal neurotransmitter involved in REM sleep.# Children have more total sleep time and stage 4 sleep than adults.# Serotonergic predominance of raphe nucleus key to initiating sleep.# NE reduces REM sleep.# Extraocular movements during REM due to activity of PPRF (paramedian pontine reticular formation/conjugate gaze center).# Benzodiazepines shorten stage 4 sleep; thus useful for night terrors and sleepwalking# Imipramine is used to treat enuresis because it | stage 4 sleep.# Characteristic feature of NREM stage IV sleep is DELTA waves. Feature. Stage of Sleep. Cardiovascular activity in Sleep: Beta waves. Awake with eyes open. NREM: BP |with less variability, CO |, vasodilation increases (|flow resistance). Alpha waves. Awake with closed eyes. Iheta waves. Stage 1. Tonic REM: BP stays the same, CO stays the same, muscles vasoconstriction. Sleep-Spindles. Stage 2. Delta waves. Stage 3 & 4. Phasic REM: BP variable, CO stays the same, whole body vasoconstriction. Beta waves. REM (same as Awake). Mnemonic: (BATS Drink Blood)",

        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Vision. REF: Guyton 12th Ed. Pg 624. PRIMARY VISUAL CORTEX is also called visual area I or striate cortex because of the highly striated appearance. The primary visual (VI) cortex is mostly located on the medial aspect of the occipital lobe, and is coextensive with the subcortical nerve fibre stria of Gennari in layer IV, hence its alternative name, the striate cortex. It occupies the upper and lower lips and depths of the posterior part of the calcarine sulcus and extends into the cuneus and lingual gyrus. Posteriorly it is limited by the lunate sulcus, and by polar sulci above and below this sulcus. It extends to the occipital pole. The primary visual cortex receives afferent fibres from the lateral geniculate nucleus via the optic radiation. The latter curves posteriorly and spreads through the white matter of the occipital lobe. Its fibres terminate in strict point-to-point fashion in the striate area. The primary visual cortex is divided into six functionally distinct layers, labeled 1 through 6. Layer 4, which receives most visual input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), is further divided into 4 layers, labelled 4A, 4B, 4. Ca, and 4. Cb. Sublamina 4. Ca receives most magnocellular input from the LGN; while layer 4. Cb receives input from parvocellular pathways. The striate cortex is granular. Layer IV, bearing the stria of Gennari, is commonly divided into three sublayers. Passing from superficial to deep, these are IVA, 1. VB (which contains the stria), and JVC. The densely cellular I VC is further subdivided into a superficial I VCa and a deep IVCb. Layer IVB contains only sparse, mainly non-pyramidal, neurones. The input to area 17 from the lateral geniculate nucleus terminates predominantly in layers IVA and IVC.",

They, then, deacetylate a variety' of proteins causing induction of catabolic processes and inhibition of anabolic processes. o SIRT-1 and SIRT-3 coordinated increase cellular energy' stores and ultimately maintain cellular energy homeostasis, o Genetic variant in SIRT-1 gene is associated lower risk of cardiovascular mortality and with better cognitive functioning. o SIRT-l variants are associated with decreased basal energy expenditure and a lower lipid peroxidation rate. Therefore, it has been proposed that genetic variation in SIRT-l may determine the response rates of individuales undergoing caloric restriction and increased physical activity, o Genetic variants of SIRT-3 may be associated with increased longevity (increased lifespan), but there is no evidence of such an association. o Mammals have seven sirtuins: 1) SIRT-1- Intranuclear2) SIRT-2- Cytoplasmic3) SIRT-3, SIRT-4, SIRT-5- Mitochondrial4) SIRT-6- Heterochromatin-associated nuclear5) SJRT-7- Nucleolaro SIRT-1 and SIRT-3 have been studied the most in relation to phenotypes in human.",

Afferent nerves to the NTS contain fibers from all types of taste receptors, without any clear localization of types. The fifth taste sense, umami, was recently added to the four classic tastes. This taste has actually been known for almost 100 years, and it became established once its receptor was identified. It is triggered by glutamate and paicularly by the monosodium glutamate (MSG) used so extensively in Asian cooking. The taste is pleasant and sweet but differs from the standard sweet taste.

Because of this sensitivity difference, rods mediate night vision and cones mediate daylight vision. While a response to a brief light flash is rather slow in rods, it is brief in cones. These rod and cone differences in their light sensitivity and the response time course arise in the differences in the reactions in the enzyme cascade to evoke light responses in these cells. This cascade (phototransduction cascade) in rods is now rather well understood at the molecular level in a quantitative way. In cones, similar cascade has been known to be present. However, details are not known yet because it was difficult to obtain purified cones in an amount large enough to study these issues biochemically.
