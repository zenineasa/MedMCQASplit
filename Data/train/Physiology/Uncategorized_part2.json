It is freely filtered by the glomerulus, but it is not reabsorbed or secreted by the nephron. All the inulin that is filtered flows through the nephron and appears in the urine. Thus, the renal clearance of inulin is relatively large. Inulin in the blood is not taken up by other tissues, and the kidneys are the only excretion route. Thus, inulin clearance is indeed the hallmark experimental method of measuring the GFR. Ref: Eaton D. C., Pooler J. P. (2013). Chapter 3. Clearance. In D. C. Eaton, J. P.

        "question": "Which of the following vasopressin receptors MOST likely mediates vasopressin antidiuretic action?",
        "exp": "The vasopressin receptor family is unique among all classes of peptide receptors, since its members couple to different subsets of G proteins. Vasopressin binds to four distinct types of receptor subtypes V1a, V1b, V2 and the oxytocin receptor. The V2 receptors are located on the basolateral membrane of collecting duct cells. This receptor belongs to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Stimulation of the V2 receptor by vasopressin leads to the activation of a G protein (Gs), resulting in the activation of adenylyl cyclase, the production of c. AMP, and the stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA stimulates aquaporin 2, a water channel protein, which undergoes vesicular trafficking, inseing into the apical membrane of the duct cells, thereby increasing the water permeability of that membrane. At maximal ADH levels, less than 1% of the filtered water is excreted, with the minimum urine volume of 500 mL/day and osmolality of 1200 mosmol/L. Long term regulation by vasopressin involves the effects of c. AMP on the c. AMP-response elements in the 5'-flanking region of the AQP2 gene, which increases the abundance of aquaporin 2 protein in the target cells. The human V2 receptor gene, AVPR2, is located in chromosome region Xq28. The genetic form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by mutations in the coding region of the V2 receptor gene. Note: AQP6 is a water channel protein that is localized exclusively in intracellular membranes in renal epithelia. Vasopressin has low affinity for oxytocin receptors. The oxytocin receptor is a typical class I G protein-coupled receptor, primarily stimulating phospholipase C beta activity. The V1a receptor mediates smooth muscle contraction (vasoconstriction in splanchnic, coronary, cerebral, peripheral, pulmonary, and intrahepatic vessels), platelet aggregation, hepatic glycogenolysis, and coagulation factor release by vasopressin. It is also proposed that brain V1a vasopressin receptors may mediate the effect of ADH on sho-term memory and learning, antipyresis, cardiovascular responsivity, and brain development. Ref: Reid I.

In this condition, four abnormalities of the heart occur simultaneously: The aorta originates from the right ventricle rather than the left, or it overrides a hole in the septum, as shown in Figure 23-5, receiving blood from both ventricles. The pulmonary artery is stenosed, so much lower than normal amounts of blood pass from the right ventricle into the lungs; instead, most of the blood passes directly into the aorta, thus bypassing the lungs. Blood from the left ventricle flows either through a ventricular septal hole into the right ventricle and then into the aorta or directly into the aorta that overrides this hole.

Similarly, the sympathetic innervation on the right side is distributed primarily to the SA node and the sympathetic innervation on the left side primarily to AV node. Effects of ANS on cardiac physiology are as follow:? A) Parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation i) Negative chronotropic (decreased heart rate): - Vagal stimulation cause decrease in slope (flattening) of prepotential (pacemaker potential) and therefore the time taken to reach the threshold level is increased --> Heart rate is decreased. ii) Negative dromotropic (decreased conduction). iii) Increased refractory period of all type of cardiac cells. B) Sympathetic stimulation i) Positive chronotropic (Increased heart rate):- Sympathetic stimulation increases the slope of phase 4 prepotential (pacemaker potential); therefore, time taken to reach the threshold is decreased and heart rate is increased. ii) Positive ionotropic (Increased contractility). iii) Positive dromotropic (Increased conduction velocity in conductive tissue). iv) Decreased in refractory period of all type of cardiac cells. v) Positive bathmotropic (Increased automaticity).",

Enkephalins and serotonin are involved in the analgesia system (brain and spinal cord). 5. A pain inhibitory complex is located in the ventral horns of the spinal cord.",
        "exp": "Pain suppression (\"Analgesia\") system in the Brain and Spinal Cord: It consists of three major components: The periaqueductal gray (in midbrain) and periventricular areas of the mesencephalon and upper pons surround the aqueduct of sylvius and poions of the third and fouh ventricles. Neurons from these areas send signals to The raphe magnus nucleus, a thin midline nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis, located laterally in the medulla. From these nuclei, second order signals are transmitted down the dorsolateral columns in the spinal cord to A pain inhibitory complex located in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord. At this point, the analgesia signals can block the pain before it is relayed to the brain. Note: \"Several transmitter substances are involved in the analgesia system (of brain and spinal cord); especially involved are enkephalin and serotonin\". \"Along with the opioid receptor, the component nuclei of this pain modulating circuit contain endogenous opioid peptides such as the enkephalins and B-endorphin\". About a dozen such opiate-like substances have now been found at different point of the nervous system; all are breakdown products of three large protein molecules; pro-opiomelanocoin, proenkephalin, and prodynorphin. Among the major impoant of these opiate-like substances are B-endorphin, met-enkephalin, leu-enkephalin, and dynorphin. Fibers originating in this area send signal to the dorsal horns of the spinal cord to secrete serotonin at their endings. The serotonin cause local cord neurons to secret enkephalin as well. The enkephalin is believe to cause both presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition of incoming type C and type A/ pain fibers where they synapse in the dorsal horns. The powerful effect of expectation and other psychological variables on the perceived intensity of pain implies the existence of brain circuits that can modulate the activity of the pain transmission pathways. One of these circuits has link in the hypothalamus, midbrain, and medulla, and it selectively controls spinal pain-transmission neurons through a descending pathway.

The strength of the contractions of small intestine is propoional to the frequency of the spike generated by the slow waves\"Slow wave\" amplitude is increased by GIT hormones released during digestion e. g. gastrin, CCK-PZ and motilin; whereas secretin and glucagons decrease the slow wave amplitude. Intestinal motility. Digestive hormones, cholecystokinin (CCK), gastrin and motilin increase intestinal motility. Secretin decreases the activity. Serotonin and insulin can increase motility. Glucagon can decrease motility. Secretin. Secretin is synthesized in cytoplasmic secretory granules of S-cells which are found mainly in mucosa of duodenum and smaller numbers in jejunum of small intestine. Secretin is released into circulation and/or intestinal lumen in response to low duodenal pH. Also the secretion of secretin is increased by the products of protein digestion bathing the mucosa of the upper small intestine. It is the active form of prosecretin. This acidity is due to hydrochloric acid in the chyme that enters the duodenum from the stomach the pyloric sphincter. Secretin targets the pancreas, which causes the organ to secrete a bicarbonate-rich fluid that flows into the intestine. Bicarbonate ion is a base that neutralizes the acid, thus establishing a pH orable to the action of other digestive enzymes in the small intestine and preventing acid burns. Other factors are also involved in the release of secretin such as bile salts and fatty acids, which result in additional bicarbonates being added to the small intestine. Secretin release is inhibited by H2 receptor antagonists, which reduce gastric acid secretion. As a result, if the pH in the duodenum increases above 4. 5, secretin cannot be released. Secretin increases water and bicarbonate secretion from duodenal Brunner's glands in order to buffer the incoming protons of the acidic chyme. It also enhances the effects of cholecystokinin to induce the secretion of digestive enzymes and bile from pancreas and gallbladder, respectively. It counteracts blood glucose concentration spikes by triggering increased insulin release from pancreas, following oral glucose intake. Although secretin releases gastrin from gastrinomas, it inhibits gastrin release from the normal stomach. It reduces acid secretion from the stomach by inhibiting gastrin release from G cells. In addition, secretin stimulates pepsin secretion from chief cells",

During quiet breathing, the intrapleural pressure fluctuates between -3 and -6 mm Hg, depending upon the phase of respiration, more negative at the end of inspiration and less negative during expiration. Intrapleural pressure (Pleural pressure). It is the pressure between two pleural surfaces. The lung is covered with visceral pleura and the thoracic cage is lined on inside with parietal pleura. Between the two layers of pleura is a very narrow space, called the pleural cavity. Intrapleural pressure is always negative and during quiet breathing the Intrapleural pressure fluctuates between -3. 8 mm Hg (- 5. 0 cm watery to -6. 0 mm Hg (-8. 0 cm water). Now let us examine why the pleural pressure is negative; more negative during inspiration, less negative during expiraion, but always negative during quiet breathing. The key to the answer is the fact that both the thoracic cage and lungs are elastic structures. Being elastic structure they both tend to recoil, but in opposite direction. The lungs have a tendency to collapse and thoracic cage has a tendency to expand. However, because of the anatomical relationships in the body, these tendencies do not normally materialize. But the tendencies do create an inward pull on the visceral pleura (by lung) and an outward pull on parietal pleura (by thoracic cage). The results of these pulls is a negative pressure in the space between the pleural surfaces, i. e., in the pleural cavity.",

The close relationship between coronary blood flow and myocardial 02 consumption indicates that one or more of the products of metabolism cause coronary vasodilation. Factors suspected of playing this role include: 02 lack and increased local concentrations of CO2H+, IC, Lactate, Prostaglandins, Adenine nucleotides, and. Adenosine. Asphyxia, hypoxia, and intracoronary injections of cyanide all increase coronary blood flow 200-300% in denervated as well as intact heas, and the feature common to these three stimuli is hypoxia of the myocardial fibers. A similar increase in flow is produced in the area supplied by a coronary aery if the aery is occluded and then released. This reactive hyperemia is similar to that seen in the skin. Evidence suggests that in the heart it is due to release of adenosine.",

        "exp": "There are following phases of gastric acid secretion: - 1. The cephalic phase:- Just as salivary secretion may start before food enters the mouth, gastric secretion is also indicated before food enters the stomach. Sight, smell or even thought of food stimulate gastric acid secretion. It is by the parasympathetic system through vagus. This phase accounts for 20% of acid secretion. 2. The gastric phase:- This phase of acid secretion comes into play when food makes contact with the gastric mucosa. Acid secretion in this phase is brought about two factors (i) Hormonal simulation due to gastrin release and (ii) Stretch of stomach wall due to gastric distension which activates a vague-vagal reflex as well as a local intragastric reflex. This phase accounts for 72-80% of acid secretion. 3. The internal phase:- Once the food enters upper portion of small intestine (i. e., duodenum) it causes small amounts of gastric juice secretion because of gastrin released from duodenal mucosa. While the internal phase plays only a minor role in the simulation of gastric secretion, the presence of food in the intenstine plays a major role in its inhibition. With the entry of food into the duodenum, gastric secretion starts slowing down. The presence of acid, fats, and products of protein digestion; and increased osmolarity in the duodenum inhibit gastric secretion by (i) Hormonal mechanism: These mentioned stimuli cause the release of several internal hormones like secretin, cholecystokinin (CCK), vasoactive internal peptide (VIP), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and somatostatin. These local hormones inhibit the gastric secretion as well as gastric motility', (ii) The neural mechanism (enterogastric reflex): The above-mentioned stimuli inhibit gastric secretion and mobility by intrinsic neural reflex.",

Glucocoicoid Glucagon, catecholamines (epinephrine & norepinephrine), coisol, ACTH, GH (growth hormone) are increased in stress (infection, surgery, hypoglycemia) whereas, insulin is suppressed (decreased)Q. In maintenance of internal homeostasis (ie avoiding stress) and reproduction processes, multiple hormones cooperate to bring about organized biochemical & physiological responses. Stress Syndrome: CRH - ACTH - Coisol Axis The primitive signal of glucose (substrate) lack is expanded to a broder signal of fright or stress and evokes a coordinated neural and endocrine response. Any stressful event eg. surgery, infection, burn triggers a hypermetabolic state in which a resting energy expenditure is increased alongwith body temperature. CRH-ACTH - coisol axis is central to this integrated response to stress. Features of Stress Syndrome - Coicotropin releasing hormone (CRH) is increased in response to noxious environmental stimuli like pain, trauma, hypoglycemia, infection, surgery, hypovolemia. Various nervous impulses using several neuro transmitters (NTs) like norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, dopamine, and GABA reach CRH neurosecretory cells and cause release of CRH - In response to CRH, both ACTH and p endorphins (secreted 13-LPH & mature p-endorphin) are released in equimolar quantities 13-endorphin produce central analgesic response. - Glucagon & catecholamines (epinephrine & norepinephrine) are increased, stimulating glycogenolysis (glucose production in liver) for immediate use by critical organs such as the brain. - Coisol production is increased in adrenal coex which induces gluconeogenesis (glucose production from noncarbohydrate source like muscles & other body proteins) - Glucogon, epinephrine, ACTH and growth hormone (GH) stimulate lipolysis and free fatty acids (FFA) & ketones are released into the circulation to be used as an alternative metabolic fuel. - Insulin is suppressedQ that results in decrease in glucose utilization. - One form of stress that is cold, specially in neonate causes increased TRH secretion due to depressed metabolism of neurons in pre- optic area by cooling which release inhibitory discharge, permitting TRH secretion. - ADH (vasopressin), angiotensin & aldosterone synthesis is increased enhancing salt water retention - So increased glucose production (by glycogenolysis & gluconeogenesis) and decreased utilization of glucose results in hyperglycemia. There is marked increase in release of aminoacids from tissue protein, paicularly from skeletal muscle for gluconeogenesis.

During exposure to positive 'g' for the first few seconds, blood is thrown into the lower pas of the body, therefore, venous return to heart decreases resulting in fall in cardiac output and systolic BPAngular acceleration or centrifugal force. If a fighter pilot is diving at the rate of 450 miles an hour and pulls out of this dive on the arc of a circle having a radius of about one-half mile, centrifugal force will press his body down onto the seat of the plane with a force which will be slightly more than five times the force of gravity. Thus if the flyer's weight is 180 lbs., the force of his body against the seat of the plane would equal more than 900 lbs. His arms would be so heavy that he would be unable to lift them. The blood would have a weight five times its normal value. This would make it difficult for the Heart to pump an adequate amount of blood to the brain. Blood would, therefore, tend to drain out of, the upper pa of the body and become pooled in the abdomen and the legs, and the ator would suffer from cerebral ischemia. The first effect of this ischemia would be a blurring and graying of the vision as though a semi-transparent cuain were lowered before the eyes. This would be accompanied by a narrowing of the visual field. If the centrifugal force on the body is continued or increased, the ator will \"black out, \" that is, he will suffer a complete loss of vision and finally will lose consciousness. The extent of the physiological changes produced depends upon both the magnitude and duration of the centrifugal force applied to the body.",

Pulmonary aerial pressure is generated by the right ventricle ejecting blood into the pulmonary circulation, which acts as a resistance to the output from the right ventricle. With each ejection of blood during ventricular systole, the pulmonary aery blood volume increases, which stretches the wall of the aery. As the heart relaxes (ventricular diastole), blood continues to flow from the pulmonary aery into the pulmonary circulation. The smaller aeries and aerioles serve as the chief resistance vessels, and through changes in their diameter, regulate pulmonary vascular resistance. In hemodynamic terms, the mean pulmonary aerial pressure (PAP) can be described by. PAP = (CO x PVR) + PVPWhere CO = cardiac output, PVR = pulmonary vascular resistance, and PVP = pulmonary venous pressure. The PVP is essentially the same as left atrial pressure. Therefore, increases in CO, PVR or PVP will lead to increases in PAP. Normally, mean pulmonary aery pressure is about 15 mm. Hg, and the pulmonary aery systolic and diastolic pressures about 25 and 10 mm. Hg, respectively. Pulmonary venous pressure is about 8 mm. Hg.

It slows penetration of some smaller molecules like urea. Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) & Blood Cerebrospinal fluid Barrier (BCSFB) - BBB & B-CSF-B exist between the blood & brain interstitial fluid and CSF respectively to uniquely limit the exchange of substances into the brain. That is why the constituents of CSF are not the same as in ECFs (extracellular fluids) elsewhere in body. - These barriers exist both at the choroid plexus and at tissue capillary membranes. The cause of low permeability is presence of tight junctions b/w the adjacent endothelial cells. - Because of the sensitivity of coical neurons to even minor variations of ionic (K+, Ca++, Mg++, I-1+ etc) concentration changes, BBB is an additional defence evolved to protect & maintain the constancy of environment of neurons in CNS. It also protects brain from endogenous & exogenous toxins in the blood & prevents escape of neurotransmitters in general circulation. BBB is immature at bih and is breached (broken down) in areas of injury, infection and tumors. Tumors develop new capillary that lack light junction and contact with astrocyte - so the radioactive iodine labeled albumin penetrates tumor rapidly, making it stand out as an island of radioactivity in the surrounding normal brain. BBB is temporarily disrupted by sudden marked increase in BP or by IV injection of hypeonc fluids. Blood-CSF Barrier & Blood-Brain Barriers are highly permeable to water, CO2 (carbondioxide), 02 (oxygen)2, and most lipid soluble (lipophilic) substances such as free forms of steroid hormones, alcohol and anestheticsQ; slightly permeable to electrolytes like Na. (sodium), K+ (potassium) and Ck (chloride); and almost totally impermeable to plasma proteins, protein bound forms of steroid hormones, protein antibodies and most non lipid soluble large organic molecules (i. e. impermeable to, in general, all proteins and polypeptides)Q. It slows penetration of some smaller molecules like urea. - Passive diffusion across cerebral capillaries with tight junction is very limited but numerous carrier-mediated & active transpo system move substances out (more freely) as well as into the brain. Many peptide & drugs actually cross the cerebral capillaries but are transpoed back rapidly into blood by a multidrug nonspecific, p-glycoprotein - ATP binding transpoer in apical membranes of endothelial cells, that transpos various proteins & lipids across cell membranes. So larger (adequate) amounts of chemotherapeutic drugs, analgesics & opioid can be delivered to brain by inhibiting this transpoer. - Transpoer exist for glucose, thyroid hormone, leptin hormone (control appetite & sympathetic activity) choline, several organic acids, nucleic acid precursors and basic, neutral and acidic aminoacids at BBB. Diffusion of glucose (the ultimate source of energy for nerve cells) across BBB would be very slow in absence of glucose transpoers like GLUT 1. Two isoforms GLUT 1 (55 K) of brain capillaries/endothelium and GLUT 1 (45 K) of astroglia, neuron (+ GLUT-3) & microglia (+ GLUT-5) are encoded by a same gene, but they differ in the extent of glycosylation.

Where is the enzyme responsible for this change located?",
        "exp": "Chylomicrons are produced by enterocytes (intestinal epithelial cells), using gut luminal triglycerides for the source of the lipid. The chylomicrons are secreted into the gut lymphatic system, and from there drain eventually into the systemic venous system from the thoracic duct, and hence into the serum poion of the blood. They are initially large and have a very high triglyceride content. With time, lipoprotein lipase releases triglycerides from the chylomicron core by hydrolyzing them to more easily absorbed fatty acids. The enzyme is located on the external surface of the vascular endothelium of tissues with triglyceride needs such as skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle tissue, and lactating breast. The result of lipoprotein lipase activity is that the chylomicrons shrink in size. While adipose tissue can utilize chylomicrons, lipoprotein lipase is located on the endothelial cells rather than adipocytes. Adipocytes have an adipose tissue lipase, which is an intracellular enzyme that can cleave triglycerides to glycerol and fatty acids, allowing them to be released into the circulation when chylomicrons are low. Enterocytes have the ability to pick up mixed micelles from the gut lumen for repackaging in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum as chylomicrons. Hepatocytes pick up the chylomicron remnants after the lipoprotein lipase shrinks them.",

Most of the unsaturation of hemoglobin that occurs in the tissues is secondary to the decline in the PO2, but an extra 1-2% unsaturation is due to the rise in PCO2 and consequent shift of the dissociation curve to the right.

The remaining daughter cells generated from the meiotic events contain relatively little cytoplasm and are referred to as polar bodies. Eventually, the polar bodies degenerate.

        "exp": "Ans. C: Spatial relationship. Inferior parietal lobule (parietal lobe) helps in spatial recognition (tactile localization, tactile discrimination etc.). Spatial relationship. Recognition of spatial relationship is a function of angular gyrus (inferior parietal lobule). Temporal lobe. It is located beneath the Syln fissure on both cerebral hemispheres. The temporal lobe is involved in auditory perception and is home to the primary auditory coex. It is also impoant for the processing of semantics in both speech and vision. The temporal lobe contains the hippocampus and plays a key role in the formation of long-term memory. The superior temporal gyrus includes an area (within the Syln fissure) where auditory signals from the cochlea (relayed several subcoical nuclei) first reach the cerebral coex. This pa of the coex (primary auditory coex) is involved in hearing. Adjacent areas in the superior, posterior and lateral pas of the temporal lobes are involved in high-level auditory processing. This includes speech, for which the left temporal lobe in paicular seems to be specialized. Wernicke's area, which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes, plays a key role (in tandem with Broca's area, which is in the frontal lobe). The functions of the left temporal lobe are not limited to low-level perception but extend to comprehension, naming, verbal memory and other language functions. The underside (ventral) pa of the temporal coices appear to be involved in high-level visual processing of complex stimuli such as faces (fusiform gyrus) and scenes (parahippocampal gyrus). Anterior pas of this ventral stream for visual processing are involved in object perception and recognition. The medial temporal lobes are involved in episodic/declarative memory. Deep inside the medial temporal lobes lie the hippocampi, which are essential for memory function - paicularly the transference from sho to long term memory and control of spatial memory and behavior. Damage to this area typically results in anterograde amnesia.",

In healthy subjects, this occurs at the end of quiet expiration, i. e., at functional residual capacity. Therefore, in healthy adults at rest FRC is essentially equal to relaxation volume of respiratory system and FRC is usually treated as synonymous with relaxation volume. However, in real sense FRC and relaxation volume are not synonymous terms and, while the two volumes are some times equal, more often they are not, i. e., active or passive mechanisms often operate to make FRC different from relaxation volume. For example, neonates have a more compliant (less stiff) chest wall. The chest wall thus has less elastic recoil to balance that of lung, thus decreasing the relaxation volume of lung. FRC then is often maintained above relaxation volume by active mechanisms like inspiratory muscle activity and slowing of expiration. Another example where FRC and relaxation volume may differ is in obstructive lung disease where FRC is dynamically determined and may be considerably above relaxation volume.",

        "exp": "Body temperature increases 00767837] Heat is produced whenever muscles contract. This is due to 2 reasons The maximal efficiency for conversion of nutrient energy into muscle work, even under best conditions, is only 20 to 25 per cent. Almost all the energy used to contract the muscle is conveed into heat d/t overcoming viscous resistance to the movement of the muscle and joints. overcoming the friction of blood flowing through the blood vessels. other similar effects. Changes in Muscle blood flow during exercise: The blood flow of resting skeletal muscle is low (2-4 ml./100 g/inin). The muscle blood flow can increase a maximum of about 25 fold during the most strenuous exercise. Almost one half of this increase in flow is due to intramuscular vasodilatation caused by the direct effects of increased muscle metabolism. The remaining increase results from multiple factors, the most impoant of which is probably the moderate increase in aerial blood pressure that occurs in exercise, usually about a 30 per cent increase. The increase in pressure not only forces more blood through the blood vessels but also stretches the walls of the aerioles and fuher reduces the vascular resistance. The local mechanisms maintaining a high blood flow in exercising muscle include a fall in tissue P02, a rise in tissue PCO2, and accumulation of K+, and other vasodilator metabolites. The rise in temperature fuher dilates the vessels. The increase in blood flow is instantaneous (and not half a minute later). When the contractions first begin, blood flow briefly decreases because of compressive forces exeed by the contracting muscles on the vasculature within the muscle. Each time the muscles contract aerial inflow decreases due to extravascular compression, and then aerial inflow increases as the muscles relax. This is repeated each time the muscles contract and relax. If flow were measured in the outflow vein, the venous outflow would increase during contraction and decrease during relaxation - the opposite of what occurs on the aerial side of the circulation. After just a couple of seconds, mean and peak flows begin to increase. After 15-20 seconds the increased flow will reach a steady state that is determined by the force and frequency of contraction, and the metabolic demands of the tissue. When contractions cease, blood flow may transiently increase because of the loss of compressive forces, and then over the next minute or so the flow will return to control. Blood flow can sometime increase at or even before the sta of exercise. This shows that the initial rise in muscle blood flow in probably a neurally mediated response. Once exercise has staed the high blood flow is maintained by the local mechanisms as described above. Blood flow to brain remains unchanged during exercise. Below given table shows that exercise causes increased blood flow to the exercising muscle with reduction of flow to liver, kidney, GI tract and inactive muscles. Blood flow to the brain remains unchanged.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Recieves hypeonic saline Fluid leaving the descending limb of loop of Henle and entering the ascending limb of loop of Henle is very hypeonic. Renal reabsorption and secretion The Glomerular filtrate enters the renal tubules and flows through the successive pas of the tubule (i. e. the proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule and finally collecting ducts) before it is excreted as urine. Along its course, the tubular cells may selectively secrete some substances from the blood into the tubular lumen (tubular secretion), or may selectively remove some substances (tubular reabsorption) from the tubular filtrate, or may do both. When the Glomerular filtrate is initially formed, its osmolarity is about the same as that of plasma i. e. 300m. Osm/L. Its osmolalilty changes depending on the absorption of water and solutes in the segment. Proximal convoluted tubule The PCT reabsorbs- sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, phosphate, potassium, glucose and amino acids. The PCT secretes- H+, organic acids and bases (such as bile salts, oxalate, urate and catecholamines) The PCT is highly permeable to water. In PCT solutes and water are reabsorbed in equal propoions, thus little change in the osmolarity occurs i. e. the tubular fluid in the PCT is isotonic to the plasma. Loop of Henle: Descending limb The thin descending segment is highly permeable to water and moderately permeable to most solutes, including urea and sodium. No active reabsorption or secretion takes place. The water is reabsorbed as the tubular fluid passes down the descending limb and the filtrate becomes concentrated, in equilibrium with the surrounding interstitial fluid of the renal medulla, which is very hypeonic. Thus fluid leaving Descending limb of loop of Henle is very hypeonic. Loop of Henle: Ascending limb The thick ascending limb reabsorbs - sodium, chloride, and potassium, calcium, bicarbonate, and magnesium. o This segment also secretes- hydrogen ions into the tubular lumen. The thin segment of the ascending limb has a much lower reabsorptive capacity than the thick segment, and the thin descending limb does not reabsorb significant amounts of any of these solutes. The ascending limb, including both the thin and the thick poions, is completely impermeable to water, even in the presence of. ADH. Since other solutes are being reabsorbed, the tubular fluid becomes hypotonic. Thus the fluid leaving the ascending limb of loop is hypotonic, with an osmolarity of only about one third the osmolarity of plasma i. e. 100 m. Osm/L. Early distal tubule Early distal tubule has propeies similar to those of the thick ascending limb of the loop, that is, it avidly reabsorbs most of the ions, including sodium, potassium, and chloride, but is viually impermeable to water so there is fuher dilution of the tubular fluid. The late distal tubules and coical collecting tubules The late distal tubules and coical collecting tubules are composed of two distinct cell types, the principal cells and the intercalated cells. The principal cells reabsorb sodium from the lumen and secrete potassium ions into the lumen. The intercalated cells reabsorb potassium and bicarbonate ions from the lumen and secrete hydrogenions into the lumen. The reabsorption of water from this tubular segment is controlled by the concentration of antidiuretic hormone. Medullary Collecting Duct The medullary collecting ducts actively reabsorb sodium and secrete hydrogen ions and are permeable to urea, which is reabsorbed in these tubular segments. The reabsorption of water in medullary collecting ducts is controlled by the concentration of antidiuretic hormone. In late distal tubule, coical collecting tubules and medullary collection tubules the tubular fluid osmolarity depends on the presence or absence of. ADH. In presence of high levels of ADH these tubules are highly permeable to water and significant amounts of water are reabsorbed and the tubular fluid becomes hypeonic, up to 1200 m. Osm/L (equal to osmolarity of the surrounding medullary interstitium). In the absence of ADH, these segments are almost impermeable to water; therefore osmolarity decreases even fuher because of continued active reabsorption of ions from these segments-tubular fluid thus becomes hypotonic with osmolarity as low as 50m.

Which is by convention -70 Mv Resting membrane potential is established by diffusion potential that results from concentration differences of permeable ions. And each permeable ion attempts to derive the membrane potential towards its equilibrium potential. Resting membrane potential (-70 mV) is close to equilibrium potential of K+ and C1-- (both -85 mV) and far away from the equilibrium potential of Na+ ( +65 mV). That means at rest the nerve membrane is more permeable to K+ than Na+ Na+ is actively transpoed out of neurons and other cells and K+ is actively transpoed into cells, but because of K+ permeability at rest is greater than Na+ permeability. Therefore, K+ channels maintain the resting membrane potential. Ionic Basis of nerve Action Potential: Depolarization causes rapid opening of the activation gates of Na+ channels and thus Na+ conductance promptly increases. Thus the membrane potential is driven towards the equilibrium potential of Na+ ion (+65 mV) Thus the rapid depolarization during upstroke is due to inward Na+ current Depolarization slowly opens K+ channels and increases K+ conductance to even higher levels than at rest. The combined effect of closing Na+ channels and greater opening of K+ channels make the K+ conductance higher than the Na+ conductance and membrane potential is repolarized. Thus repolarization is caused by outward K+ current. The K+ conductance remains higher than at rest for some time after closure of Na+ channel and the membrane potential is driven more closer to K+ equilibrium potential than at rest. This is called as undershoot.",

Transferrin is iron transpoer protein 70% of iron in the body is hemoglobin Ferritin which is not combined with iron is called apoferritin. Under steady conditions, the serum ferritin level correlates with total body iron stores; thus, the serum ferritin level is the most convenient laboratory test to estimate iron stores. The ferritin levels measured have a direct correlation with the total amount of iron stored in the body. If ferritin is high there is iron in excess, If ferritin is low there is a risk for lack in iron. Serum ferritin is the most sensitive lab test for iron deficiency anemia.

A) Non-REM (NREM) or slow-wave sleep:- It is called Non-REM sleep because no rapid eye movement (REM) is there on eletrooculogram, rather there is slow or quiscent eye movement. It is also referred as S-sleep (synchronized sleep) or quiet sleep or ohodox sleep because there is diminished physiological functions and a low level of overall activity. It is fuher divided into:? 1) Stage 1:- It is a transition from wakefulness to sleep and is characterized by disappearance of alpha activity and appearance of theta activity. There is slow eye movements. 2) Stage 2:- It is characterized by typical EEG activity i. e., Sleep spindles and If-complex'. No eye movement occurs. 3) Stage 3 & 4:- Stage 3 & 4 are stages of deep sleep. These are also called slow wave sleep as these stages are characterized by slow delta waves. Delta wave appearance stas in stage 3 and dominated in stage 4. B) REM sleep:- The REM sleep is so named as there is rapid roving movements of eye, i. e., rapid eye movement (REM)on electro-oculogram. It is also called paradoxical sleep because there is a paradoxical elevation of brain activity & metabolism and physiological activity. The high-amplitude slow waves seen in stage 3, 4 of REM sleep is replaced by rapid low voltage activity (Beta wave). Features of REM sleep are:-i) EEG - Beta-wave, Reappearance of alpha wave, Saw-tooth wave (low voltage fast activity), Ponto-genital-occipital spikes. ii) Dreamingiii) Other features:- Generalized muscular atony, Penile erection, autonomic hyperactivity (Increased pulse rate & BP) and intermittent movement of small muscle groups. The NREM (with its four stages) and REM sleep repeat several times a night in cyclic manner, 4-6 times depending on the length of sleep. A typical cycle stas with stage 1 of the NREM sleep which is followed by second, third and fouh stages. After this the sleep returns to stage 3 and 2. The first REM sleep occurs now, 7090 minutes after the the commencement of sleep (Note: - Stage 1 NREM sleep occurs only once at the sta of the sleep as this is only a transition phase between wakefulness and sleep. Once the sleep stas the cycle rotates between stage 2, 3, 4 NREM and REM sleep).

For most substance that are actively reabsorbed or secreted there is a maximum rate at which the solute can be transpoedQ ofter k/a transpo maximum. This limit is d/t saturation of specific transpo system. Tm for kidney in practice is less than calculated value (i. e., threshold of substance is less than its Tm) because, not all nephrons have the same Tm and some of the nephron excrete substance before others have reached their TmQ. It is impoant to know that overall Tm of substance for kidney is reached when all nephrons have reached their capacity to reabsorb or secrete that substance. Tm for glucose in normal adult is - 375 mg/minQ, whereas its filtered load is only 125mg/min (GFR x Plasma glucose = 125 ml/min x 1 mg/ml). With large increase in plasma glucose &/or GFR, which increase the filtered load above 375 mg/min, the excess glucose filtered is not reabsorbed & passes into urine. However, even when the plasma glucose concentration rises above 200 mg/100m1 (2mg/m1) (so filtered load is 250 mg/min, which is less than Tm), a small amount of glucose appears in urine. This is known as threshold of glucose. So renal threshold of substance is the plasma level at which it first appears in urine in more than the normal minute volumes. Substances that do not exhibit Tm Substances that are passively reabsorbed do not demonstrate Tm, because their rate is determined by electrochemical gradient, permeability, & time that solute remains within tubule eg. are urea, chlorideQ, water Some actively transpoed substance also have electrochemical gradient- time transpo. e. g. is Na reabsorption in PCTQ.

        "exp": "Ans. is `b' i. e., Cooperative binding in Hb Cooperative binding is responsible for sigmoid shape of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. As myoglobin is monomeric (consists of one polypeptide chain only), it can bind only one molecule of oxygen and for the same reason myoglobin cannot show the phenomenon of cooperative binding. Hence, the oxygen? myoglobin dissociation curve is hyperbola as compared to sigmoid shape of Hb-O2 curve. Hemoglobin - O2 binding Each molecule of hemoglobin can combine with upto four molecules of oxygen. Combination with the first molecule alters the conformation of the hemoglobin molecule in such a way as to facilitate combination with the next oxygen molecule. In light of this, if we look at the curve, as the PO2 stas rising from 0 mm Hg upwards, initially all hemoglobin molecules in blood stas combining with their first oxygen molecule. This is the most difficult molecule to combine with. Hence saturation rises only slowly with initial rise in PO2. As PO2 rises fuher, hemoglobin molecules combine with their second, third and fouh molecules, which are progressively easier to combine with. Hence saturation rises steeply between PO2 of 15 mm Hg and 40 mm Hg. When PO2 rises still fuher, oxygen finds most of the hemoglobin molecules carrying four molecules of oxygen each. Since no molecules of hemoglobin can carry more than four molecules of oxygen, there is not much scope for more O2 combining with hemoglobin. Hence the curve becomes almost flat again beyond the PO2 of 60 mm Hg. Thus, the primary reason for the sigmoid shape of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is that out of the four molecules of oxygen that can combine with a hemoglobin molecules, the first combines with the greatest difficulty and binding of an oxygen molecules increases affinity to next O2 molecule. This phenomenon is termed as cooperative binding or cooperativity, i. e., a molecule of O2 binds to a hemoglobin tetramer more readily if other O2 molecules are already bound. Myoglobin O2 binding Myoglobin is present in higher concentration in red (slow) muscle fibers. Myoglobin has greater affinity for oxygen than hemoglobin and its P50 is only 5 mm Hg (as compared to PO2 of hemoglobin which is about 26 mm Hg). Therefore, myoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve is shifted far to the left than Hb-O2 dissociation curve. It has shape of hyperbola as compared to sigmoid shape of Hb-O2 curve because it binds 1 molecule of O2 per mole (in comparison to Hb which binds 4 molecules of O2 per mole). The role of myoglobin is to bind O2 at very low PO2 and release them at even lower PO2, for example in exercising muscles where PO2 close to zero.",

        "exp": "Ans. D: Type II alveolar cells The low surface tension when the alveoli are small is due to the presence in the fluid lining the alveoli of surfactant, a lipid surface-tension-lowering agent. Surfactant is a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins. If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. Surfactant is produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells. Typical lamellar bodies, membrane-bound organelles containing whorls of phospholipid, are formed in these cells and secreted into the alveolar lumen by exocytosis. Tubes of lipid called tubular myelin form from the extruded bodies, and the tubular myelin in turn forms the phospholipid film. Some of the protein-lipid complexes in surfactant are taken up by endocytosis in type II alveolar cells and recycled. Surfactant is impoant at bih. The fetus makes respiratory movements in utero, but the lungs remain collapsed until bih. After bih, the infant makes several strong inspiratory movements and the lungs expand. Surfactant keeps them from collapsing again. Surfactant deficiency is an impoant cause of infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS, also known as hyaline membrane disease), the serious pulmonary disease that develops in infants born before their surfactant system is functional. Maturation of surfactant in the lungs is accelerated by glucocoicoid hormones. Fetal and maternal coisol increase near term, and the lungs are rich in glucocoicoid receptors. Patchy atelectasis is also associated with surfactant deficiency in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery involving use of a pump oxygenator and interruption of the pulmonary circulation. In addition, surfactant deficiency may play a role in some of the abnormalities that develop following occlusion of a main bronchus, occlusion of one pulmonary aery, or long-term inhalation of 100% 0,.

HFood in the stomach increase gastric acid secretion by stretching the receptors in the wall of the stomach (mechanical stimulus) The fibers from the receptor enter Meissner's plexus (site of ganglion cells of vagus nerve). Products of digestion (specially amino acids) in the stomach also stimulates gastric mucosa (chemical stimulus). Gastric secretion. Gastric acid is produced by parietal cells (also called oxyntic cells) in the stomach. There are three phases in the secretion of gastric acid: The cephalic phase: Thiy percent of the total gastric acid secretions to be produced is stimulated by anticipation of eating and the smell or taste of food. The gastric phase: Sixty percent of the acid secreted is stimulated by the distention of the stomach with food. Plus, digestion produces proteins, which causes even more gastrin production. The intestinal phase: The remaining 10% of acid is secreted when chyme enters the small intestine, and is stimulated by small intestine distention. Regulation of secretion. Gastric acid production is regulated by both the autonomic nervous system and several hormones. The parasympathetic nervous system, the vagus nerve, and the hormone gastrin stimulate the parietal cell to produce gastric acid, both directly acting on parietal cells and indirectly, through the stimulation of the secretion of the hormone histamine from enterochromaffine-like cells (ECL). Vasoactive intestinal peptide, cholecystokinin, and secretin all inhibit production. The production of gastric acid in the stomach is tightly regulated by positive regulators and negative feedback mechanisms. Four types of cells are involved in this process: parietal cells, G cells, D cells and enterochromaffine-like cells. Besides this, the endings of the vagus nerve (CN X) and the intramural nervous plexus in the digestive tract influence the secretion significantly. Nerve endings in the stomach secrete two stimulatory neurotransmitters: acetylcholine and gastrin-releasing peptide. Their action is both direct on parietal cells and mediated through the secretion of gastrin from G cells and histamine from enterochromaffine-like cells. Gastrin acts on parietal cells directly and indirectly too, by stimulating the release of histamine. The release of histamine is the most impoant positive regulation mechanism of the secretion of gastric acid in the stomach. Its release is stimulated by gastrin and acetylcholine and inhibited by somatostatin.",

        "exp": "Ans. A: Sacral poion of spinal cord. The smooth muscle of the bladder (detrusor) is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers (from the lumbar spinal cord) and parasympathetic fibers (from the sacral spinal cord). Fibers in the pelvic nerves are the afferent limb of the voiding reflex, and the parasympathetic fibers to the bladder that constitutes the efferent limb also travel in these nerves. The reflex is integrated in the sacral poion of the spinal cord. Muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra called the internal urethral sphincter. Faher along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle called external urethral sphincter. When the individual is ready to urinate, he or she consciously initiates voiding, causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax. During the storage phase the internal urethral sphincter remains tense and the detrusor muscle relaxed by sympathetic stimulation. During micturition, parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax. The external urethral sphincter (sphincter urethrae) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition. Once the voluntary signal to begin voiding has been issued, neurons in pontine micturition center fire maximally, causing excitation of sacral preganglionic neurons. The firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract; as a result, a sudden, sharp rise in pressure in intravesical pressure occurs. When the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine flows from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow through the urethra. When the sacral dorsal roots are interrupted by diseases of the dorsal roots such as tabes dorsalis in humans, all reflex contractions of the bladder are abolished. The bladder becomes distended, thin-walled, and hypotonic. When the afferent and efferent nerves are both destroyed, as they may be by tumors of the cauda equina or filum terminale, the bladder is flaccid and distended for a while. Gradually, however, the muscle of the \"decentralized bladder\" becomes active. The bladder becomes shrunken and the bladder wall hyperophied. During spinal shock, the bladder is flaccid and unresponsive. It becomes overfilled, and urine dribbles through the sphincters (overflow incontinence). After spinal shock has passed, the voiding reflex returns, although there is, of course, no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers when the spinal cord is transected. Bladder capacity is reduced, and the wall becomes hyperophied. This type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic neurogenic bladder.",

They descend and terminate on spinal motor neurons innervating the primary muscles of inspiration, i. e., the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles. 2) Ventral respiratory group (VRG): - The ventral respiratory group of neurons is mainly concerned with forceful expiration but also shows some activity during inspiration. Therefore, these neurons contribute to both expiration and inspiration. These neurons are divided into:? i) The rostral VRG neurons: - These neurons show activity primarily synchronous with inspiration and therefore be called inspiratory (I) neurons. They terminate on spinal motor neurons supplying the accessory muscles of inspiration, i. e., sternocleidomastoid, scalenes and anterior serrati. ii) The ventral VRG neurons: - These are mostly expiratory (E) neurons. But since the expiration is generally a passive process, E neurons are silent most of the time. However, these neurons show activity when expiration is forceful, as during exercise. These neurons terminate on spinal motor neurons supply the muscles of expiration, i. e., internal intercostal and abdominal muscles. 3) Pre-Botzinger complex: - These neurons are responsible for generation of respiratory rhythm, i. e., the pacemaker cells which regulate the rate of respiration are located in Pre-Botzinger complex. Pontine respiratory centers The impoant pontine areas concerned with respiration are:? 1) Pneumotoxic center (nucleus parabrachialis medialis): - It is located in upper pa of pons and transmits signals to the inspiratory area. The function of the pneumotaxic center is primarily to limit inspiration, i. e., the primary effect of this center is to control the \"switch-off\" point of the inspiratory ramp thus controlling the depth of inspiration, i. e., the duration of the filling phase of the lung cycle. Pneumotaxic center also inhibits apneustic center fuher inhibiting inspiration. Therefore strong stimulation of this center results in an early termination of inspiratory ramp and hence, inspiration is shoened and the tidal volume decreases. Conversely, in the absence of inputs from this center, inspiratory ramp continues much longer and hence inspiration is prolonged and the tidal volume increases. 2) Apneustic center: - This center located in the lower (caudal) pa of pons. The apneustic center excites inspiratory center (DRG) and produce a prolonged inspiratory drive which delays the onset of expiration. Thus, though the respiratory rhythm is established in the medulla, this rhythm is spoilt by a strong inspiratory drive orginating in the apneustic centers. However, two influences seems to keep the apneustic center in check: (i) Pneumotaxic center of upper pons and (ii) Influence from stretch receptors in lung vagus. Both of these influence inhibit inspiratory activity.",

This effect helps the body to conserve water in circumstances such as dehydration. In the absence of ADH, the permeability of the distal tubules and collecting ducts to water is low, causing the kidneys to excrete large amounts of dilute urine, a condition called diabetes insipidus.

First step in the absorption of folate involves hydrolysis of pteroyl polyglutamates into pteroyl monoglutamate by conjugase enzyme located in the intestinal mucosa. Next step involves absorption of pteroyl monoglutamate through active carrier mediated transpo. Besides this, pharmacologic doses of folate are also absorbed passively by facilitated diffusion. After absorption from the lumen into the enterocyte intracellular enzymes reduce and methylate the monoglutamate to produce metabolically active form of folic acid. This form is then absorbed into circulation by simple diffusion. Most of the vitamins are absorbed passively. Cyanocobalamin is the only vitamin that that depends on active transpo for its absorption. Folic acid and thiamine are the only other vitamins for which active mechanism of absorption is known.

This organ consists of a net-like (ramified) collection of knobby nerve endings among the fascicles of a tendon. There are 3-25 muscle fiber per golgi tendon organ. Golgi tendon organs are also stretch receptors. However, unlike the muscle spindle which acts as a length detecter, the Golgi-tendon organ acts as a muscle tension-detector. This difference in sensory function occurs because muscle spindle is located in parallel to the muscle fibers (extrafusal fibers) while the Golgi tendon organ is located in series to the muscle fibers (extrafusal fibers). Therefore, Golgi tendon organs are stimulated by both passive stretch and contraction of muscle (in contrast to muscle spindle which is stimulated by passive stretch but is inhibited by active contraction of muscle). Stimuli for golgi tendon reflex are both passive strech and active contraction of muscle. The golgi tendon organ is innervated by Aa sensory (afferent) fibers (type lb sensory). These afferent fibers terminate on an inhibitory interneuron in dorsal horn of grey matter in the spinal cord. These inhibitory interneuron terminates on the a-motor neuron (same a-motor neuron on which Ia (Aa) afferent of stretch reflex terminates) and has inhibitory effect on a-motor neuron.

        "question": "Impotency may be seen in: September 2007",
        "exp": "Ans. D: All of the above. Physiological aspect: The hypothalamus releases Gn. RH in a pulsatile nature which appears to be essential for stimulating the production and release of both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). LH and FSH are produced in the anterior pituitary and are secreted episodically in response to the pulsatile release of Gn. RH. LH and FSH both bind to specific receptors on the Leydig cells and Seoli cells within the testis. Testosterone, the major secretory product of the testes, is a primary inhibitor of LH secretion in males. Testosterone may be metabolized in peripheral tissue to the potent androgen dihydrotestosterone or the potent estrogen estradiol. These androgens and estrogens act independently to modulate LH secretion. The mechanism of feedback control of FSH is regulated by a Seoli cell product called inhibin. Decreases in spermatogenesis are accompanied by decreased production of inhibin and this reduction in negative feedback is associated with reciprocal elevation of FSH levels. Prolactin also has a complex inter-relationship with the gonadotropins, LH and FSH. In males with hyperprolactinemia, the prolactin tends to inhibit the production of Gn. RH. In individuals with elevated prolactin levels who are given testosterone, libido and sexual function do not return to normal as long as the prolactin levels are elevated. Hromonal causes of impotency: Hormone disorders account for fewer than 5% of cases of impotence. Testosterone deficiency, which occurs rarely, can result in a loss of libido (sexual desire) and loss of erection. Among other conditions, an excess of the hormone prolactin, caused by pituitary gland tumor, reduces levels of testosterone. Hormone imbalances can also result from kidney or liver disease. Other causes: Mumps is known to cause testicular failure. A varicocele can reduce hormonal production as well.",

However, even the three layers put together do not provide an adequate structural basis for the degree of sieving achieved during filtration. The fenestration in the endothelium are 50-100 nm in diameter, and the slits between the foot process of epithelial cells (podocytes) are 25 nm wide. That leaves only the basement membrane to account for the selectivity and the filtration function of the glomerular membrane. Basement membrane contains hydrated channels approximately 6 nm wide. A fuher functional barrier in basement membrane is added by the fact that basement membrane glycoproteins are strongly negatively charged. That is why filtration surface is almost impermeable to plasma proteins which are negatively charged, e. g., albumin (size 7 nm). The passage of neutral or positively charged molecules of comparable diameter is not so difficult. Ultimately, molecules less than 4 nm is diameter are freely filtered while molecules larger than 8 nm are not filtered atall and the molecules between 4-8 nm diameter are filtered with difficulty which increases propoionately with size.",

A-wave: initial corneal-negative deflection, derived from the cones and rods of the outer photoreceptor layers. This wave reflects the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptors due to the closure of sodium ion channels in the outer segment membrane. Absorption of light triggers the rhodopsin to activate transducin, a G-protein. This leads to the activation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (c. GMP PDE) eventually leading to a reduction in the level of c. GMP within the photoreceptor.

In human, the olfactory mucous membrane (olfactory neuroepithelium) located in the roof of the nasal cavity near the septum. Because of its location high in the nasal cavity, the olfactory mucosa is not directly exposed to the flow of inspired air entering the nose. The olfactory mucosa contains olfactory receptors. The olfactory receptors are unique in that the receptor cell itself is a neuron. The olfactory receptor cell has cilia projecting in the nasal mucosa which act as receptor for olfaction (These are dendrites of neuron/receptor cells). The axons of olfactory neuron (olfactory receptor cells) form olfactory nerve which passes through cribriform plate and terminates in the olfactory bulb. In olfactory bulb axons of olfactory nerve synapse with dendrides of mitral cells to form the olfactory glomeruli. Mitral cells are the principal output neurons of olfactory bulb and their axons form the olfactory tract. The olfactory bulb also contains periglomerular cells, which are inhibitory neurons and granule cells which have no synapse and make reciprocal synapses with mital and tufted cells. Like the taste fibers, olfactory tract also projects to the primitive pas of the brain as well as the neocoex. The projections to the primitive pas are principally to the pyriform area (olfactory coex), amygdala and entorhinal coex, which in turn projects to the hippocampus. The pathway to the neocoex involves a relay in the olfactory tubercle, and then in the thalamus, the output of which projects to the orbitofrontal coex.",
