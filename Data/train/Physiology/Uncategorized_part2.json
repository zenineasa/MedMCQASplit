        "question": "Following change is noted during exercise.",
        "exp": "Body temperature increases 00767837] Heat is produced whenever muscles contract. This is due to 2 reasons The maximal efficiency for conversion of nutrient energy into muscle work, even under best conditions, is only 20 to 25 per cent. Almost all the energy used to contract the muscle is conveed into heat d/t overcoming viscous resistance to the movement of the muscle and joints. overcoming the friction of blood flowing through the blood vessels. other similar effects. Changes in Muscle blood flow during exercise: The blood flow of resting skeletal muscle is low (2-4 ml./100 g/inin). The muscle blood flow can increase a maximum of about 25 fold during the most strenuous exercise. Almost one half of this increase in flow is due to intramuscular vasodilatation caused by the direct effects of increased muscle metabolism. The remaining increase results from multiple factors, the most impoant of which is probably the moderate increase in aerial blood pressure that occurs in exercise, usually about a 30 per cent increase. The increase in pressure not only forces more blood through the blood vessels but also stretches the walls of the aerioles and fuher reduces the vascular resistance. The local mechanisms maintaining a high blood flow in exercising muscle include a fall in tissue P02, a rise in tissue PCO2, and accumulation of K+, and other vasodilator metabolites. The rise in temperature fuher dilates the vessels. The increase in blood flow is instantaneous (and not half a minute later). When the contractions first begin, blood flow briefly decreases because of compressive forces exeed by the contracting muscles on the vasculature within the muscle. Each time the muscles contract aerial inflow decreases due to extravascular compression, and then aerial inflow increases as the muscles relax. This is repeated each time the muscles contract and relax. If flow were measured in the outflow vein, the venous outflow would increase during contraction and decrease during relaxation - the opposite of what occurs on the aerial side of the circulation. After just a couple of seconds, mean and peak flows begin to increase. After 15-20 seconds the increased flow will reach a steady state that is determined by the force and frequency of contraction, and the metabolic demands of the tissue. When contractions cease, blood flow may transiently increase because of the loss of compressive forces, and then over the next minute or so the flow will return to control. Blood flow can sometime increase at or even before the sta of exercise. This shows that the initial rise in muscle blood flow in probably a neurally mediated response. Once exercise has staed the high blood flow is maintained by the local mechanisms as described above. Blood flow to brain remains unchanged during exercise. Below given table shows that exercise causes increased blood flow to the exercising muscle with reduction of flow to liver, kidney, GI tract and inactive muscles. Blood flow to the brain remains unchanged.

In addition, the direction of the electrical gradient for Na+ is reversed during the overshoot because the membrane potential is reversed, and this limits Na+ influx. A third factor producing repolarization is the opening of voltage-gated K+ channels. The net movement of positive charge out of the cell due to K+ efflux at this time helps complete the process of repolarization. The slow return of the K+ channels to the closed state also explains the after-hyperpolarization.",

A) Non-REM (NREM) or slow-wave sleep:- It is called Non-REM sleep because no rapid eye movement (REM) is there on eletrooculogram, rather there is slow or quiscent eye movement. It is also referred as S-sleep (synchronized sleep) or quiet sleep or ohodox sleep because there is diminished physiological functions and a low level of overall activity. It is fuher divided into:? 1) Stage 1:- It is a transition from wakefulness to sleep and is characterized by disappearance of alpha activity and appearance of theta activity. There is slow eye movements. 2) Stage 2:- It is characterized by typical EEG activity i. e., Sleep spindles and If-complex'. No eye movement occurs. 3) Stage 3 & 4:- Stage 3 & 4 are stages of deep sleep. These are also called slow wave sleep as these stages are characterized by slow delta waves. Delta wave appearance stas in stage 3 and dominated in stage 4. B) REM sleep:- The REM sleep is so named as there is rapid roving movements of eye, i. e., rapid eye movement (REM)on electro-oculogram. It is also called paradoxical sleep because there is a paradoxical elevation of brain activity & metabolism and physiological activity. The high-amplitude slow waves seen in stage 3, 4 of REM sleep is replaced by rapid low voltage activity (Beta wave). Features of REM sleep are:-i) EEG - Beta-wave, Reappearance of alpha wave, Saw-tooth wave (low voltage fast activity), Ponto-genital-occipital spikes. ii) Dreamingiii) Other features:- Generalized muscular atony, Penile erection, autonomic hyperactivity (Increased pulse rate & BP) and intermittent movement of small muscle groups. The NREM (with its four stages) and REM sleep repeat several times a night in cyclic manner, 4-6 times depending on the length of sleep. A typical cycle stas with stage 1 of the NREM sleep which is followed by second, third and fouh stages. After this the sleep returns to stage 3 and 2. The first REM sleep occurs now, 7090 minutes after the the commencement of sleep (Note: - Stage 1 NREM sleep occurs only once at the sta of the sleep as this is only a transition phase between wakefulness and sleep. Once the sleep stas the cycle rotates between stage 2, 3, 4 NREM and REM sleep). REM sleep occupies 20-30% of total sleep and NREM sleep occupies 60-70% (Stage-1 - 5-10%; Stage 2 - 40-50%; Stage 3 & 4 - 15-20%).",

For most substance that are actively reabsorbed or secreted there is a maximum rate at which the solute can be transpoedQ ofter k/a transpo maximum. This limit is d/t saturation of specific transpo system. Tm for kidney in practice is less than calculated value (i. e., threshold of substance is less than its Tm) because, not all nephrons have the same Tm and some of the nephron excrete substance before others have reached their TmQ. It is impoant to know that overall Tm of substance for kidney is reached when all nephrons have reached their capacity to reabsorb or secrete that substance. Tm for glucose in normal adult is - 375 mg/minQ, whereas its filtered load is only 125mg/min (GFR x Plasma glucose = 125 ml/min x 1 mg/ml). With large increase in plasma glucose &/or GFR, which increase the filtered load above 375 mg/min, the excess glucose filtered is not reabsorbed & passes into urine. However, even when the plasma glucose concentration rises above 200 mg/100m1 (2mg/m1) (so filtered load is 250 mg/min, which is less than Tm), a small amount of glucose appears in urine. This is known as threshold of glucose. So renal threshold of substance is the plasma level at which it first appears in urine in more than the normal minute volumes. Substances that do not exhibit Tm Substances that are passively reabsorbed do not demonstrate Tm, because their rate is determined by electrochemical gradient, permeability, & time that solute remains within tubule eg. are urea, chlorideQ, water Some actively transpoed substance also have electrochemical gradient- time transpo. e. g. is Na reabsorption in PCTQ.

        "exp": "Ans. is `b' i. e., Cooperative binding in Hb Cooperative binding is responsible for sigmoid shape of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve. As myoglobin is monomeric (consists of one polypeptide chain only), it can bind only one molecule of oxygen and for the same reason myoglobin cannot show the phenomenon of cooperative binding. Hence, the oxygen? myoglobin dissociation curve is hyperbola as compared to sigmoid shape of Hb-O2 curve. Hemoglobin - O2 binding Each molecule of hemoglobin can combine with upto four molecules of oxygen. Combination with the first molecule alters the conformation of the hemoglobin molecule in such a way as to facilitate combination with the next oxygen molecule. In light of this, if we look at the curve, as the PO2 stas rising from 0 mm Hg upwards, initially all hemoglobin molecules in blood stas combining with their first oxygen molecule. This is the most difficult molecule to combine with. Hence saturation rises only slowly with initial rise in PO2. As PO2 rises fuher, hemoglobin molecules combine with their second, third and fouh molecules, which are progressively easier to combine with. Hence saturation rises steeply between PO2 of 15 mm Hg and 40 mm Hg. When PO2 rises still fuher, oxygen finds most of the hemoglobin molecules carrying four molecules of oxygen each. Since no molecules of hemoglobin can carry more than four molecules of oxygen, there is not much scope for more O2 combining with hemoglobin. Hence the curve becomes almost flat again beyond the PO2 of 60 mm Hg. Thus, the primary reason for the sigmoid shape of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is that out of the four molecules of oxygen that can combine with a hemoglobin molecules, the first combines with the greatest difficulty and binding of an oxygen molecules increases affinity to next O2 molecule. This phenomenon is termed as cooperative binding or cooperativity, i. e., a molecule of O2 binds to a hemoglobin tetramer more readily if other O2 molecules are already bound. Myoglobin O2 binding Myoglobin is present in higher concentration in red (slow) muscle fibers. Myoglobin has greater affinity for oxygen than hemoglobin and its P50 is only 5 mm Hg (as compared to PO2 of hemoglobin which is about 26 mm Hg). Therefore, myoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve is shifted far to the left than Hb-O2 dissociation curve. It has shape of hyperbola as compared to sigmoid shape of Hb-O2 curve because it binds 1 molecule of O2 per mole (in comparison to Hb which binds 4 molecules of O2 per mole). The role of myoglobin is to bind O2 at very low PO2 and release them at even lower PO2, for example in exercising muscles where PO2 close to zero.",

CO2, caused by hyperventilation. The reduction in p. CO2, then leads to a decrease in the rate of H+ secretion by the renal tubules. The decrease in H+ secretion reduces the amount of H+ in the renal tubular fluid. Consequently, there is not enough H+ to react with all the HCO3- that is filtered. Therefore, the HCO3- that cannot react with H+ is not reabsorbed and is exreted in the urine. This results in a decrease in plasma HCO3- concentration and correction of the alkalosis. Therefore, the compensatory response to a primary reduction in p. CO2 in respiratory alkalosis is a reduction in plasma HCO3- concentration, caused by increased renal exretion of HCO3- Changes in plasma hydrogen ion concentration can influence the degree of calcium binding to plasma proteins. With acidosis, less calcium is bound to the plasma proteins. Conversely, in alkalosis, a greater amount of calcium is bound to the plasma proteins.

        "question": "Surfactant is produced by: March 2010",
        "exp": "Ans. D: Type II alveolar cells The low surface tension when the alveoli are small is due to the presence in the fluid lining the alveoli of surfactant, a lipid surface-tension-lowering agent. Surfactant is a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins. If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. Surfactant is produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells. Typical lamellar bodies, membrane-bound organelles containing whorls of phospholipid, are formed in these cells and secreted into the alveolar lumen by exocytosis. Tubes of lipid called tubular myelin form from the extruded bodies, and the tubular myelin in turn forms the phospholipid film. Some of the protein-lipid complexes in surfactant are taken up by endocytosis in type II alveolar cells and recycled. Surfactant is impoant at bih. The fetus makes respiratory movements in utero, but the lungs remain collapsed until bih. After bih, the infant makes several strong inspiratory movements and the lungs expand. Surfactant keeps them from collapsing again. Surfactant deficiency is an impoant cause of infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS, also known as hyaline membrane disease), the serious pulmonary disease that develops in infants born before their surfactant system is functional. Maturation of surfactant in the lungs is accelerated by glucocoicoid hormones. Fetal and maternal coisol increase near term, and the lungs are rich in glucocoicoid receptors. Patchy atelectasis is also associated with surfactant deficiency in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery involving use of a pump oxygenator and interruption of the pulmonary circulation. In addition, surfactant deficiency may play a role in some of the abnormalities that develop following occlusion of a main bronchus, occlusion of one pulmonary aery, or long-term inhalation of 100% 0,. Cigarette smoking also decreases lung surfactant.",

        "question": "Which of the following inhibits gastric phase of gastric secretion: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. D: Low gastric p. HFood in the stomach increase gastric acid secretion by stretching the receptors in the wall of the stomach (mechanical stimulus) The fibers from the receptor enter Meissner's plexus (site of ganglion cells of vagus nerve). Products of digestion (specially amino acids) in the stomach also stimulates gastric mucosa (chemical stimulus). Gastric secretion. Gastric acid is produced by parietal cells (also called oxyntic cells) in the stomach. There are three phases in the secretion of gastric acid: The cephalic phase: Thiy percent of the total gastric acid secretions to be produced is stimulated by anticipation of eating and the smell or taste of food. The gastric phase: Sixty percent of the acid secreted is stimulated by the distention of the stomach with food. Plus, digestion produces proteins, which causes even more gastrin production. The intestinal phase: The remaining 10% of acid is secreted when chyme enters the small intestine, and is stimulated by small intestine distention. Regulation of secretion. Gastric acid production is regulated by both the autonomic nervous system and several hormones. The parasympathetic nervous system, the vagus nerve, and the hormone gastrin stimulate the parietal cell to produce gastric acid, both directly acting on parietal cells and indirectly, through the stimulation of the secretion of the hormone histamine from enterochromaffine-like cells (ECL). Vasoactive intestinal peptide, cholecystokinin, and secretin all inhibit production. The production of gastric acid in the stomach is tightly regulated by positive regulators and negative feedback mechanisms. Four types of cells are involved in this process: parietal cells, G cells, D cells and enterochromaffine-like cells. Besides this, the endings of the vagus nerve (CN X) and the intramural nervous plexus in the digestive tract influence the secretion significantly. Nerve endings in the stomach secrete two stimulatory neurotransmitters: acetylcholine and gastrin-releasing peptide. Their action is both direct on parietal cells and mediated through the secretion of gastrin from G cells and histamine from enterochromaffine-like cells. Gastrin acts on parietal cells directly and indirectly too, by stimulating the release of histamine. The release of histamine is the most impoant positive regulation mechanism of the secretion of gastric acid in the stomach. Its release is stimulated by gastrin and acetylcholine and inhibited by somatostatin.",

        "exp": "Ans. A: Sacral poion of spinal cord. The smooth muscle of the bladder (detrusor) is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers (from the lumbar spinal cord) and parasympathetic fibers (from the sacral spinal cord). Fibers in the pelvic nerves are the afferent limb of the voiding reflex, and the parasympathetic fibers to the bladder that constitutes the efferent limb also travel in these nerves. The reflex is integrated in the sacral poion of the spinal cord. Muscle bundles pass on either side of the urethra called the internal urethral sphincter. Faher along the urethra is a sphincter of skeletal muscle called external urethral sphincter. When the individual is ready to urinate, he or she consciously initiates voiding, causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax. During the storage phase the internal urethral sphincter remains tense and the detrusor muscle relaxed by sympathetic stimulation. During micturition, parasympathetic stimulation causes the detrusor muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax. The external urethral sphincter (sphincter urethrae) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition. Once the voluntary signal to begin voiding has been issued, neurons in pontine micturition center fire maximally, causing excitation of sacral preganglionic neurons. The firing of these neurons causes the wall of the bladder to contract; as a result, a sudden, sharp rise in pressure in intravesical pressure occurs. When the external urinary sphincter is relaxed urine flows from the urinary bladder when the pressure there is great enough to force urine to flow through the urethra. When the sacral dorsal roots are interrupted by diseases of the dorsal roots such as tabes dorsalis in humans, all reflex contractions of the bladder are abolished. The bladder becomes distended, thin-walled, and hypotonic. When the afferent and efferent nerves are both destroyed, as they may be by tumors of the cauda equina or filum terminale, the bladder is flaccid and distended for a while. Gradually, however, the muscle of the \"decentralized bladder\" becomes active. The bladder becomes shrunken and the bladder wall hyperophied. During spinal shock, the bladder is flaccid and unresponsive. It becomes overfilled, and urine dribbles through the sphincters (overflow incontinence). After spinal shock has passed, the voiding reflex returns, although there is, of course, no voluntary control and no inhibition or facilitation from higher centers when the spinal cord is transected. Bladder capacity is reduced, and the wall becomes hyperophied. This type of bladder is sometimes called the spastic neurogenic bladder.",

        "question": "Which of the following are inactive during normal respiration?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Ventral group of neurons Medullary respiratory centers The principal areas in the medulla oblongata concerned with regulation of respiration are:? 1) Dorsal respiratory group (DRG): - The dorsal respiratory group of neurons are mainly concerned with inspiration. They descend and terminate on spinal motor neurons innervating the primary muscles of inspiration, i. e., the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles. 2) Ventral respiratory group (VRG): - The ventral respiratory group of neurons is mainly concerned with forceful expiration but also shows some activity during inspiration. Therefore, these neurons contribute to both expiration and inspiration. These neurons are divided into:? i) The rostral VRG neurons: - These neurons show activity primarily synchronous with inspiration and therefore be called inspiratory (I) neurons. They terminate on spinal motor neurons supplying the accessory muscles of inspiration, i. e., sternocleidomastoid, scalenes and anterior serrati. ii) The ventral VRG neurons: - These are mostly expiratory (E) neurons. But since the expiration is generally a passive process, E neurons are silent most of the time. However, these neurons show activity when expiration is forceful, as during exercise. These neurons terminate on spinal motor neurons supply the muscles of expiration, i. e., internal intercostal and abdominal muscles. 3) Pre-Botzinger complex: - These neurons are responsible for generation of respiratory rhythm, i. e., the pacemaker cells which regulate the rate of respiration are located in Pre-Botzinger complex. Pontine respiratory centers The impoant pontine areas concerned with respiration are:? 1) Pneumotoxic center (nucleus parabrachialis medialis): - It is located in upper pa of pons and transmits signals to the inspiratory area. The function of the pneumotaxic center is primarily to limit inspiration, i. e., the primary effect of this center is to control the \"switch-off\" point of the inspiratory ramp thus controlling the depth of inspiration, i. e., the duration of the filling phase of the lung cycle. Pneumotaxic center also inhibits apneustic center fuher inhibiting inspiration. Therefore strong stimulation of this center results in an early termination of inspiratory ramp and hence, inspiration is shoened and the tidal volume decreases. Conversely, in the absence of inputs from this center, inspiratory ramp continues much longer and hence inspiration is prolonged and the tidal volume increases. 2) Apneustic center: - This center located in the lower (caudal) pa of pons. The apneustic center excites inspiratory center (DRG) and produce a prolonged inspiratory drive which delays the onset of expiration. Thus, though the respiratory rhythm is established in the medulla, this rhythm is spoilt by a strong inspiratory drive orginating in the apneustic centers. However, two influences seems to keep the apneustic center in check: (i) Pneumotaxic center of upper pons and (ii) Influence from stretch receptors in lung vagus. Both of these influence inhibit inspiratory activity.",

        "question": "Receptor for inverse stretch reflex?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Golgi tendon argan Inverse stretch reflex (golgi tendon reflex) Golgi tendon reflex is a bisynaptic reflex, initiated by the Golgi tendon organ located in muscle tendons. This organ consists of a net-like (ramified) collection of knobby nerve endings among the fascicles of a tendon. There are 3-25 muscle fiber per golgi tendon organ. Golgi tendon organs are also stretch receptors. However, unlike the muscle spindle which acts as a length detecter, the Golgi-tendon organ acts as a muscle tension-detector. This difference in sensory function occurs because muscle spindle is located in parallel to the muscle fibers (extrafusal fibers) while the Golgi tendon organ is located in series to the muscle fibers (extrafusal fibers). Therefore, Golgi tendon organs are stimulated by both passive stretch and contraction of muscle (in contrast to muscle spindle which is stimulated by passive stretch but is inhibited by active contraction of muscle). Stimuli for golgi tendon reflex are both passive strech and active contraction of muscle. The golgi tendon organ is innervated by Aa sensory (afferent) fibers (type lb sensory).

A-wave: initial corneal-negative deflection, derived from the cones and rods of the outer photoreceptor layers. This wave reflects the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptors due to the closure of sodium ion channels in the outer segment membrane. Absorption of light triggers the rhodopsin to activate transducin, a G-protein. This leads to the activation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (c. GMP PDE) eventually leading to a reduction in the level of c. GMP within the photoreceptor.

In human, the olfactory mucous membrane (olfactory neuroepithelium) located in the roof of the nasal cavity near the septum. Because of its location high in the nasal cavity, the olfactory mucosa is not directly exposed to the flow of inspired air entering the nose. The olfactory mucosa contains olfactory receptors. The olfactory receptors are unique in that the receptor cell itself is a neuron. The olfactory receptor cell has cilia projecting in the nasal mucosa which act as receptor for olfaction (These are dendrites of neuron/receptor cells). The axons of olfactory neuron (olfactory receptor cells) form olfactory nerve which passes through cribriform plate and terminates in the olfactory bulb. In olfactory bulb axons of olfactory nerve synapse with dendrides of mitral cells to form the olfactory glomeruli. Mitral cells are the principal output neurons of olfactory bulb and their axons form the olfactory tract. The olfactory bulb also contains periglomerular cells, which are inhibitory neurons and granule cells which have no synapse and make reciprocal synapses with mital and tufted cells. Like the taste fibers, olfactory tract also projects to the primitive pas of the brain as well as the neocoex. The projections to the primitive pas are principally to the pyriform area (olfactory coex), amygdala and entorhinal coex, which in turn projects to the hippocampus. The pathway to the neocoex involves a relay in the olfactory tubercle, and then in the thalamus, the output of which projects to the orbitofrontal coex.",

P3 receptor calcium channelsQ- Different source of calcium- As in skeletal & cardiac muscle, Ca++ plays a impoant role in initiation of contraction but the source of Ca.* increase is much different- Unlike skeletal & like cardiac muscle most of the calcium which enters sarcoplasm comes from ECF and very little comes from sarcoplasmic reticulumQ. So the source of ca-- are: Phosphorylation of myosin is essential for its binding to actin. Lack of troponin in smooth muscles prevents Ca'* activation troponin binding. Rather Ca** binds to calmodulin and resulting complex activates calmodulin dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of myosine light chain on serine at position 19. Myosin LC20 phosphorylation is a must and increases myosin ATPase activityQ resultingin binding of myosin to actin and contraction. However, phosphorylation & dephosphorylation of myosin also occur in skeletal muscle but phosphorylation is not necessary for activation of ATPase. Dephosphorylation & Latch bridges. Myosin LC is dephosphorylated by myosin light chain phosphatase but it does not necessarily Vt relaxation & final detachmentQ of myosin cross bridges from actin until the intracellular concentration of falls below a critical level. This continued attachment of myosin cross bridges to actin even after dephosphorylation creates latch bridges. Latch bridges do not make significant cycles of attachment & detachmentQ between actin & myosin so do not require much ATPQ and so maintain prolonged contractions without expenditure of much energy. If epinephrine or NE is added, the membrane potential becomes larger, the spikes decrease in frequency & muscle relaxes. Whereas acetylcholine addition 1/t decreased membrane potential, spikes become more frequent, muscle becomes more active with an increase in tonic tension & number of rhythmic contractions. During smooth muscle contraction increase in cytosolic calcium is due to influx through voltage or ligand gated plasma membrane Ca++ channelsQ and release of Ca++ from sarcoplasmic reticulum activated by 1.

        "question": "Which of the following decreases intestinal motility: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. D: Secretin The strength of the contractions of small intestine is propoional to the frequency of the spike generated by the slow waves \"Slow wave\" amplitude is increased by GIT hormones released during digestion e. g. gastrin, CCK-PZ and motilin; whereas secretin and glucagons decrease the slow wave amplitude Intestinal motility Digestive hormones, cholecystokinin (CCK), gastrin and motilin increase intestinal motility Secretin decreases the activity. Serotonin and insulin can increase motility Glucagon can decrease motility. Secretin Secretin is synthesized in cytoplasmic secretory granules of S-cells which are found mainly in mucosa of duodenum and smaller numbers in jejunum of small intestine Secretin is released into circulation and/or intestinal lumen in response to low duodenal pH. Also the secretion of secretin is increased by the products of protein digestion bathing the mucosa of the upper small intestine. It is the active form of prosecretin. This acidity is due to hydrochloric acid in the chyme that enters the duodenum from the stomach the pyloric sphincter. Secretin targets the pancreas, which causes the organ to secrete a bicarbonate-rich fluid that flows into the intestine. Bicarbonate ion is a base that neutralizes the acid, thus establishing a pH orable to the action of other digestive enzymes in the small intestine and preventing acid burns. Other factors are also involved in the release of secretin such as bile salts and fatty acids, which result in additional bicarbonates being added to the small intestine. Secretin release is inhibited by H2 receptor antagonists, which reduce gastric acid secretion. As a result, if the pH in the duodenum increases above 4. 5, secretin cannot be released Secretin increases water and bicarbonate secretion from duodenal Brunner's glands in order to buffer the incoming protons of the acidic chyme. It also enhances the effects of cholecystokinin to induce the secretion of digestive enzymes and bile from pancreas and gallbladder, respectively. It counteracts blood glucose concentration spikes by triggering increased insulin release from pancreas, following oral glucose intake. Although secretin releases gastrin from gastrinomas, it inhibits gastrin release from the normal stomach. It reduces acid secretion from the stomach by inhibiting gastrin release from G cells. In addition, secretin stimulates pepsin secretion from chief cells",

        "question": "Which is not a constituent of juxtaglomerular complex: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Glomerulus. The JGA is composed of JG cells, macula densa cells and mesangial/Lacis cells. Juxtaglomerular apparatus. There are 3 different types of cells in the Juxtaglomerular Apparatus: Granular Cells/ juxtaglomerular cells, Macula Densa Cells and Mesangial Cells. Granular Cells/ juxtaglomerular cells. Granular cells are modified pericytes of glomerular aerioles. They are also known as Juxtaglomerular cells. The Juxtaglomerular cells secrete renin in response to:- Betal adrenergic stimulation- Decrease in renal perfusion pressure (detected directly by the granular cells)- Decrease in Na. C1 absorption in the Macula Densa (often due to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, causing slower filtrate movement through the proximal tubule and thus more time for reabsorption. This results in a lower Na. C1 concentration by the time the filtrate reaches the Macula Densa). Macula Densa Cells. Macula densa cells are columnar epithelium thickening of the distal tubule. The macula densa senses sodium chloride concentration in the distal tubule of the kidney and secretes a locally active (paracrine) vasopressor which acts on the adjacent afferent aeriole to decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as pa of the tubuloglomerular feedback loop. Specifically, excessive filtration at the glomerulus or inadequate sodium uptake in the proximal tubule / thick ascending loop of Henle brings fluid to the distal convoluted tubule that has an abnormally high concentration of sodium. Na/Cl cotranspoers move sodium into the cells of the macula densa. The macula densa cells do not have enough basolateral Na/K ATPases to excrete this added sodium, so the cell's osmolarity increases. Water flows into the cell to bring the osmolarity back down, causing the cell to swell. When the cell swells, a stretch-activated non-selective anion channel is opened on the basolateral surface. ATP escapes through this channel and is subsequently conveed to adenosine. Adenosine vasoconstricts the afferent aeriole Al receptors and vasodilates (to a lesser degree) efferent aerioles A2 receptors which decreases GFR. Also, adenosine inhibits renin release in JG cells A2 receptors on JG cells using Gi pathway. Also, when macula densa cells detect higher concentrations of Na and Cl they inhibit Nitric Oxide Synthetase (decreasing renin release). Mesangial cells/ Lacis cells. Mesangial cells are structural cells in the glomerulus that under normal conditions serve as anchors for the glomerular capillaries. The mesangial cells within the glomerulus communicate with mesangial cells outside the glomerulus (extraglomerular mesangial cells), and it is the latter cells that form pa of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. These cells form a syncytium and are connected with glomerular mesangial cells gap junctions. They contain actin and myosin, allowing them to contract when stimulated by renal sympathetic nerves, which may provide a way for the sympathetic nervous system to modulate the actions of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.",

The relationship between paial pressure of 02 and the percentage saturation of hemoglobin with 02 can be explained graphically. And the graph is called 0, - hemoglobin dissociation Curve. It represents the affinity of hemoglobin for 02 Normal curve S- shaped or sigmoid shapedQ due to interconversion of hemoglobin from low affinity tightly bound Tense configuration (T state) to high affinity released configuration (R state) as more 02 molecules are bound. - Relaxed configuration exposes more oxygen binding sites & significantly increases 02 affinity. - Combination of the first heme with 02 increase the affinity of second heme for 02 (due to TR interconversion) and oxygenation of second increases the affinity of the third and so on. * P, 0 - The paial pressure of 02 at which Hb saturation is 50% Q. The normal value is 26. 6 mm. Hg * Myoglobin has hyperbolic 02-binding curve. Bohr effect: The presence of CO2 (4, pH) decreases the affinity of Hb for 02, this enhances fuher release of 02 to the tissue and the 02 dissociation curve is shifted to right. This is known as Bohr effect. So decrease in 02 affinity of hemoglobin when pH of blood falls is called Bohr effectQ. And it is caused by the fact that deoxygenated hemoglobin binds H+ more actively than does oxyhemoglobin. All the factors, which shift the 02- dissociation curve to the right enhances the Bohr effect. Binding of 02 to hemoglobin reduces its affinity for CO2(2 or in other words CO2 disociation curve shifts to right (i. e. blood begins to lose some CO2 as it becomes oxygenated) is called Haldane - Christian - Douglas effect",

This increases blood volume and, therefore, increases blood pressure. Drugs that interfere with the secretion or action of aldosterone are in use as antihypeensives. One example is spironolactone, which lowers blood pressure by blocking the aldosterone receptor. Aldosterone is pa of the renin-angiotensin system. Aldosterone is a yellow steroid hormone (mineralocoicoid family) produced by the outer-section (zona glomerulosa) of the adrenal coex.

        "exp": "A i. e. Deposition of chondroitin sulfate. Growth hormone exes much of its effects (especially on growth, cailage & protein metabolism) through intermediate polypeptide growth factors also k/a somatomedin or insulin like growth factor secreted by liver & other tissues. The first of somatomedin isolated was called sulfation factor because it stimulated incorporation of sulfate into cailage (i. e. deposition of chondroitin sulfate)Q and collagen formation. Somatomedins. Somatomedins are polypeptide growth factors, secreted by liver and other tissues, which mediate the effects of growth hormone (somatotropin or STH) on growth, cailage and protein metabolism. Liver (and to a much lesser extent, other tissues) form somatomedins, when stimulated by somatotropin (or growth hormone). That is why gwoth hormone supplied directly to cailage chondrocytes cultured outside the body fails to produce proliferation & enlargement of chondrocytes whereas, growth hormone injections into intact living animal does cause it. Somatomedins are also k/a insulin like growth factors (IGFs) because many of its effects on growth are similar to effects of insulin on growth. At least 4 types have been isolated 3 of which are- Somatomedin A or insulin like growth factor 2 (IGF2) or multiplication stimulating activity (MSA) - Somatomedin B derived from vitronectin- Somatomedin C or IGF 1 is the most impoant type & its concentration closely follows the rate of growth hormone secretion. The principal & in humns probably the only circulating somatomedins are IGF1 & IGF-2. these factors closely relate to insulin, except that their C chains are not separated and they have an extension of A chain called the D domain. The activity that is not suppressed by antiinsulin antibodies is called non suppressible insulin like activity (NSILA). Most, if not all, of this activity persists after pancreatectomy and is d/t IGFland IGF II. However because of 100 fold weaker binding to insulin receptor the insulin like activity of IGF 1 & 2 is weak enough to prevent diabetes mellitus after pancreatectomy. Insulin also binds to IGF 1 receptors whereas IGFI & II bind to all 3 i. e. insulin, IGFI & IGF II receptor. Comparison of insulin & IGF Insulin.

Its concentration rises during childhood, peaks at pubey & then declines to low levels in old age. It has pronounced growth stimulating activity (epiphyseal growth & protein synthesis) Stimulates sulfate incorporation into cailage proteoglycan chondroitin sulfateQ- Insulin like effects on adipose tissue (antilipolytic) and muscles- Mitogenicity for fibroblasts- IGI- 1 receptor is similar to insulin receptor & uses same intra cellular signaling pathways. Characteristics of IGF- II- Hormone relaxin (both isoforms) resemble IGF-II- Largely independent of GH & plays a role in growth of fetus before bih.- If over expressed in fetus, growth of organs esp tongue other muscles, kidney, heart & liver is dispropoionate.- In adults IGF II gene is expressed only in choroids plexus & meninges- IGF II receptor has distinct structure & is involved in the intracellular targeting of acid hydrolyses & other proteins to intracellular organelles Pygmies of Africa & Levi-lorian dwarf have a - congenital inability to synthesize somatomedin C in adequate amount. Therefore, even though their plasma concentration of GH is either normal or high, they have diminished amounts of somatomedin C l/t small statures. IGF I & II are tightly bound to proteins (IGF binding protein 3 or IGFBP3 accounts for 95% binding) in plasma, at least for IGF I this prolongs their half life in circulation to about 20 hours. Whereas the growth hormone weakly binds to protein & has a sho half life of 20 minutes. It seems that GH & somatomedins can act both in cooperation & independently to stimulate pathways that 1/t growth. GH promote growth of muscle & bone. Its metabolic actions are counter regulatory to insulin as it induces glycogenolysis & gluconeogenesis in liver to increase blood glucose and mobilizes free fatty acids (i. e. lipolysis). It inhibits glucose uptake by muscle & fat cells, so more glucose is provided to brain & heart. Simultaneously, GH stimulates lipolysis in fat cells providing free fatty acids to heart & active skeletal muscle. But IGFI structurally similar to insulin is capable of increasing glucose utilization & decreasing lipolysis. These effects are opposite to those of acute, antiinsulin actions of GH.",

The three impoant buffers are: -i) Bicarbonate buffer: - Present in proximal segments (Proximal tubules, Thick ascending limb). It is nothing else but filtered HCO3- ions which react with H+ to form H2. CO3. This is the most impoant buffer in proximal tubules. ii) Phosphate buffer: - Especially impoant in distal tubules. iii) Ammonia buffers: - Bind to H+ and produce ammonium ion (H+ + NH3 = NH4). The reaction with NH3 occurs in the proximal and distal tubules but the main buffering mechanism is active in distal tubule and this is the most impoant buffer in distal tubule. Thus, these buffers neutralize H+ in the tubules and in exchange HCO2 is reabsorbed. In case of bicarbonate buffer all filtered bicarbonates are reabsorbed. In case of ammonia and phosphate buffers, new HCO3 is generated due to secretion of W. So, ammonia and phosphate buffers are excreted in exchange of HCO3 absorption.",

The lack of much effect on the resting membrane potential would be predicted, since the permeability of the membrane to Na+ at rest is relatively low. Conversely, increasing the external K+ concentration decreases the resting membrane potential.

Both of these actions increase glomerular filtration. In addition, it act on the renal tubules to inhibit Na+ reabsorption. Other actions include an increase in capillary permeability, leading to extravasation of fluid and a decline in blood pressure. In addition, it relax vascular smooth muscle in aerioles and venules. These peptides also inhibit renin secretion and counteract the pressor effects of catecholamines and angiotensin II. In the brain, ANP is present in neurons, and an ANP-containing neural pathway projects from the anteromedial pa of the hypothalamus to the areas in the lower brainstem that are concerned with neural regulation of the cardiovascular system. In general, the effects of ANP in the brain are opposite to those of angiotensin II, and ANP-containing neural circuits appear to be involved in lowering blood pressure and promoting natriuresis.",

Factor VIII does not paicipate directly in the platelet poion of blood clot formation. Thromboxane A2 promotes subendothelial exposure after vascular injury and induces platelet aggregation. Also Know: Von Willebrand Disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. VWF serves two roles: (1) as the major adhesion molecule that tethers the platelet to the exposed subendothelium; and (2) as the binding protein for FVIII, resulting in significant prolongation of the FVIII half-life in circulation. The most common type of VWD is type 1 disease, with a parallel decrease in VWF protein, VWF function, and FVIII levels, accounting for at least 80% of cases. Patients have predominantly mucosal bleeding symptoms, although postoperative bleeding can also be seen. Menorrhagia is a common manifestation of VWD. The mainstay of treatment for type 1 VWD is 1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP, or desmopressin), which results in release of VWF and FVIII from endothelial stores. Ref: Konkle B. (2012).

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Activin Hormonal regulation of the menstrual cycle. Menstrual cycle involves the interplay of ovarian, pituitary and hypothalamic hormones. At the beginning of the cycle, the estrogen level is very low and progesterone level is negligible. Therefore, the pituitary and hypothalamus are free from the negative feedback effect of estrogen and progesterone. Hence the hypothalamus secretes Gn. RH and the anterior pituitary secretes FSH and some LH. FSH stimulates follicular development. Ovarian follicles secrete estrogen. Estrogen tends to suppress FSH secretion, but progressive follicular development ensures a rise in estrogen level. Around day 11 of the cycle, the estrogen level crosses a ceain threshold. Above this threshold level. estrogen has a positive feedback effect on LH secretion, and to some extent also on FSH secretion. This leads to LH and FSH surge. The LH surge is essential for ovulation. After ovulation has taken place on day 14, the corpus luteum stas developing under the influence of LH. Corpus luteum secretes estrogen, progesterone and inhibin. The combined effect of these hormones is to suppress the secretion of FSH and LH by negative feedback effect on the anterior pituitary, and to a lesser extent also on the hypothalamic Gn. RH secretion. Absence of suppo from FSH and LH leads to regression of the corpus luteum. Regression of the corpus luteum leads to a sharp decline in estrogen and progesterone levels. Withdrawal of suppo from estrogen and progesterone leads to menstrual bleeding. Thus one cycle ends and the next cycle begins.",

B: FSHThe ovarian changes in menopause are not due to lack of anterior pituitary gonadotropins (FSH and LH) which actually increase, as negative effect of estrogen and progesterone is reduced. Ovaries no longer secrete 17-beta-pestradiol. Menopause. The stages of the menopause transition have been classified according to a woman's repoed bleeding pattern, suppoed by changes in the pituitary follicle stimulating hormone/ FSH levels. In younger women, during a normal menstrual cycle the ovaries produce estradiol, testosterone and progesterone in a cyclical pattern under the control of FSH and luteinising hormone (LH) which are both produced by the pituitary gland. Blood estradiol levels remain relatively unchanged, or may increase approaching the menopause, but are usually well preserved until the late perimenopause. This is presumed to be in response to elevated FSH levels. Menopause is based on the natural or surgical cessation of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries, which are a pa of the body's endocrine system of hormone production, in this case the hormones which make reproduction possible and influence sexual behavior. After menopause, estrogen continues to be produced in other tissues, notably the ovaries, but also in bone, blood vessels and even in the brain. However the dramatic fall in circulating estradiol levels at menopause impacts many tissues, from brain to skin. In contrast to the sudden fall in estradiol during menopause, the levels of total and free testosterone, as well as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and androstenedione decline more or less steadily with age.",

        "question": "Bain Bridge reflex causes:",
        "exp": "A Bainbridge Reflex is a positive feedback mechanism in which there is a compensatory increase in heart rate, due to a rise in right atrial pressure. It is commonly referred to as an Atrial Reflex. Bainbridge reflex, or atrial reflex: is an acceleration of the heart rate resulting from increased blood pressure in, or increased distension of, the large systemic veins and the right upper chamber of the heart. Atrial stretch receptors are responsible for this. Afferent signals: are carried through the vagus nerves to the medulla of the brain. Efferent signals are transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves to increase heart rate and strength of heart contraction. Prevents damming of blood in the veins atria and pulmonary circulation. The reflex competes with the baroreceptor-mediated decrease in heart rate produced by volume expansion and is diminished or absent when the initial heart rate is high. Bain bridge Reflex can be eliminated by transection of the cardiac autonomic nerve supply and injection of atropine. A \"reverse\" Bainbridge reflex has been proposed to explain the decreases in heart rate observed under conditions in which venous return is reduced, such as during spinal and epidural anesthesia, controlled hypotension, and severe hemorrhage.

That is perhaps one reason why HbF has a greater affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin (HbF)\". - Understanding of medical physiology \"Fetal hemoglobin binds less 2-3 DPG it has consequently a greater affinity for O2\". _ Pediatric physiology All other textbooks have mentioned the same thing. So, the high affinity of HbF to O2 is due to the low affinity of HbF for 2, 3 DPG (and not due to decreased 2, 3-DPG concentration). However, amongst the given options, option a is the best answer here because, although there is no decrease in concentration of 2, 3-DPG, because of low affinity for 2, 3-DPG, HbF behaves as if 2, 3-DPG levels are low. \"Fetal hemoglobin has considerably less affinity for 2, 3-DPG than does adult hemoglobin.

They do this by opening Chloride channels and/or Potassium channels in the plasma membrane. In each case, opening of the channels increases the membrane potential by Letting negatively-charged chloride ions (C1\") in and Positively-charged potassium ions (K+) out This hyperpolarization is called an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). Although the threshold voltage of the cell is unchanged, it now requires a stronger excitatory stimulus to reach threshold. Example: Gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). This neurotransmitter is found in the brain and inhibits nerve transmission by both mechanisms: Binding to GABAA receptors opens chloride channels in the neuron.

The most likely candidate for this action is the intestinal peptide known as gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), which obviously was named for its effects on the stomach. GIP secretion is increased during ingestion of glucose and the blood level produced is sufficient to stimulate insulin secretion. Because of this effect on insulin secretion, GIP is sometimes referred to as glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide. Activation of the sympathetic innervation to the pancreas inhibits insulin secretion an a2-adrenergic mechanism. Hence, any sympathetic reflexes activated during ingestion of glucose would decrease insulin secretion. While paracrine release of somatostatin by D cells in the islets does inhibit insulin secretion by b cells, there is no reason to suspect that intravenous versus ingested glucose would have a differential effect on somatostatin release. The same holds true for glucagon secretion by a cells. Fuhermore, glucagon has a paracrine effect to increase insulin secretion.",

The motor-unit obey all or none law, i. e., when the nerve fiber (neuron) of the motor unit is stimulated, all the fibers of motor unit will either contract maximally or not contract at all, depending upon whether the stimulus is of threshold or subthreshold intensity. Since the unit of activation is nerve fiber, the unit of contraction is a motor unit. Muscles which are concerned with fine graded and precise movement (e. g., fingers and eye ball) have only 3-6 fibers in a motor unit. On the other hand, muscles for gross movements (e. g., leg) contain 600-1000 muscle fibers per unit. If an isolated muscle is stimulated the contractile response depends on the strength of stimulus. The dependence of the strength of contractile response on the strength of stimulus seem at first to violate the all or none followed by excitable tissue. But in fact skeletal muscle also follows all or none low at cellular level, i. e., at motor unit level (read above: motor unit). Each motor unit will either contracts with full force or not at all. But the number of motor units contracting can be altered. The larger the number of motor units which contract, stronger is the contraction of muscle (whole muslce).

        "exp": "Ans. D: X wave. Atrial pressure rises during atrial systole and continues to rise during isovolumetric ventricular contraction when the AV valves bulge into the atria. When the AV valves are pulled down by the contracting ventricular muscle, pressure falls rapidly and then rises as blood flows into the atria until the AV valves open early in diastole. The return of the AV valves to their relaxed position also contributes to this pressure rise by reducing atrial capacity. The atrial pressure changes are transmitted to the great veins, producing three characteristic positive waves in the record of jugular pressure. The a wave is due to atrial systole. As noted above, some blood regurgitates into the great veins when the atria contract, even though the orifices of the great veins are constricted. In addition, venous inflow stops, and the resultant rise in venous pressure contributes to the a wave. The c wave is the transmitted manifestation of the rise in atrial pressure produced by the bulging of the tricuspid valve into the atria during isovolumetric ventricular contraction. The v wave mirrors the rise in atrial pressure before the tricuspid valve opens during diastole. Venous pressure falls during inspiration as a result of the increased negative intrathoracic pressure and rises again during expiration.

Hypehyroidism is characterized by nervousness; weight loss; hyperphagia; heat intolerance; increased pulse pressure; a fine tremor of the outstretched fingers; a warm, soft skin; sweating; and a BMR from +10 to as high as +100. It has various causes. However, the most common cause is Graves' disease (Graves' hypehyroidism), which accounts for 60-80% of the cases. The condition, which for unknown reasons is much more common in women, is an autoimmune disease in which antibodies to the TSH receptor stimulate the receptor. This produces marked T4 and T3 secretion and enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter). However, due to the feedback effects of T4 and T1, plasma TSH is low, not high. Another hallmark of Graves' disease is the occurrence of swelling of tissues in the orbits, producing protrusion of the eyeballs (exophthalmos). This occurs in 50% of patients and often precedes the development of obvious hypehyroidism.",

        "exp": "Pulmonary capillaries and pulmonary lymphatic system normally maintain a slight negative pressure in the interstitial spaces. Whenever extra fluid appears in the alveoli, it will be simply sucked mechanically into the lung interstitium through the small openings between the alveolar epithelial cells. Then the excess fluid is either carried away through the pulmonary lymphatics or absorbed into the pulmonary capillaries. Thus, under normal conditions, the alveoli are kept dry, except for a small amount of fluid that seeps from the epithelium onto the lining surfaces of the alveoli to keep them moist.

        "exp": "The opening of potassium channels in the apical membrane of auditory hair cells allows potassium ions to flow into the cell and depolarize the cell. The apical surface of these cells is exposed to endolymph, which contains potassium ions at a much greater concentration than is found inside the cell. A potential difference of 160 mV (outside positive) exists across the apical membrane, and this results in a net movement of potassium ions into the cell when the stereocilia bundle is deflected and ion transduction channels are opened. The membrane potential of the hair cell moves in the positive direction (toward zero) and this results in depolarization of the cell.",
