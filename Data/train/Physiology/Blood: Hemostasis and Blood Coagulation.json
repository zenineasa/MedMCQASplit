Its also obvious that 1 gm of a heavy molecular weight protein will contain a lesser number of particles than 1 gm of a low molecular weight protein. So 1 gm of a low molecular weight protein will exert a higher osmotic pressure.* Of the three major types of plasma proteins albumin has the highest concentration (about 66%) and the lowest molecular weight Therefore it has the maximum number of molecular in the plasma and contributes maximally to osmotic pressure (80%).

Histamine relaxes precapillary sphincter thus leads to capillary dilatation. Flush or flare is spreading of redness beyond the injury (red line). It is due to arteriolar dilation mediated by axon reflex (may be an indirect effect of histamine).
