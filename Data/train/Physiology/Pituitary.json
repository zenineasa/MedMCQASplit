This process is involved when secretory granules are extruded from the cell. When secretory vesicle comes in contact with inside of cell membrane, the membrane of the vesicle fuses with cell membrane and then there is extrusion of the contents of vesicle from the cells as secretory granules. Similar to endocytosis exoevtosis requires Ca++ and energy. Exoevtosis is also called emiocytosis or reverse pinoevtosis. o Exoevtosis (secretion from the cell) occurs via two pathways: -Non-constitutivepathway:- Proteins from the Golgi apparatus initially enter secretory' granules, where processing of prohormones to mature hormones occurs before exocytosis. This pathway is sometimes called \"regulated pathway\". Constitutive pathway:- Involves the prompt transport of proteins to the cell membrane in vesicles, with little or no processing or storage.
