This process is involved when secretory granules are extruded from the cell. When secretory vesicle comes in contact with inside of cell membrane, the membrane of the vesicle fuses with cell membrane and then there is extrusion of the contents of vesicle from the cells as secretory granules. Similar to endocytosis exoevtosis requires Ca++ and energy. Exoevtosis is also called emiocytosis or reverse pinoevtosis. o Exoevtosis (secretion from the cell) occurs via two pathways: -Non-constitutivepathway:- Proteins from the Golgi apparatus initially enter secretory' granules, where processing of prohormones to mature hormones occurs before exocytosis. This pathway is sometimes called \"regulated pathway\". Constitutive pathway:- Involves the prompt transport of proteins to the cell membrane in vesicles, with little or no processing or storage.

OXYTOCIN: Oxytocin is a peptide of nine amino acids (a nonapeptide)released by the human posterior pituitary gland. Actions: Oxytocin has peripheral (hormonal) actions, and also has actions in the brain. Its actions are mediated by specific, high-affinity oxytocin receptors. The oxytocin receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor. Acts on myoepithelial cells of the ducts in the breast to squeeze the milk out of areola of iactating breast causing galactokinesis or milk ejection or letting down reflex. Remember milk production is not a function of oxytocin. Initiation of labour: it acts on uterine musculature to cause its contraction and initiates labour via positive feed back mechanism. However it's important to note that oxytocin acts on an endometrium primed by estrogen, and progesterone antagonises this function of oxytocin. It also acts on non pregnant uterus to cause sperm transport. It has been found that since the structure of oxytocin is similar to vasopressin it can act on VI receptors in the brain, although the effect is 10 times lesser, hence large doses of oxytocin can cause a state similar to vasopressin excess. Given as syntocinon for induction of labour in intravenous or nasal spray forms. Atosiban a tocolytic is its antagonist. There are three vasopressin receptors. They are ah G protein linked. VIAV1.
