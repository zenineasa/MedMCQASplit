Heart - (due to pactions)i) | heart rate, (Positive chronotropic)ii) | force of cardiac contraction (Positive ionotropic)iii) Conduction velocity in the conductive tissues of heart is increased (Positive dromotropic)iv) Increased automaticity (positive bathmotropic)v) Refractory Period (RP) of all type of cardiac cells is reduced. This makes sense, because with a fight or flight response, heart rate increases, as a consequence of:# | Conduction velocity (Positive dromotropic)# | Refractory period (so that cardiac tissue becomes excitable in a shorter span on time)2. Blood vessels* Stimulation of cq receptors cause vasoconstriction. Stimulation of b2 receptors cause vasodilation. Vasoconstriction (a1 receptors) predominate in skin, mucosal, renal and sphlanchnic blood vessels. Dilatation (b2 receptors) predominate in skeletal muscles, liver and coronary blood vessels. The direct effect on cerebral vessels is not prominent - blood flow through this bed parallels change in BP. Renal vessels contain bothaI (vasoconstriction) and (vasodilatiator) receptor. Therefore sympathetic stimulation cause less increase in vascular resistance as compared to other sites where sympathetic stimulation causes vasconstriction.3. Urinary system* Relaxation of detrusor (b2 action) and contraction of trigone (a1 action) - urinary retention.4. GIT* Relaxation of smooth muscles by direct action of b2 receptors and indirect action of a2 receptors (a2 receptors decrease the release of ACH by acting presynaptically on cholinergic neurons).5. Respiratory system* Bronchial smooth muscles have b2 receptors but no sympathetic supply. b2 receptor agonists (exogenous drugs) can cause bronchodilation. There is vasoconstriction of mucosal blood vessels of respiratory tract - further increase in diameter of bronchus. Overall there is decrease in resistance.6. Eye* Mydriasis - Due to contraction of radial muscles (Dilator pupillae) of iris by a7 receptors.7. Genital system* Relaxation of uterus - b2 receptors* Ejaculation - a1 receptors.8.

Guyton physiology 11th ed., 541)ACUTE MOUNTAIN SICKNESS AND HIGH-ALTITUDE CEREBRAL & PULMONARY EDEMAA small percentage of people who ascend rapidly to high altitudes become acutely sick and can die if not given oxygen or removed to a low altitude.The sickness begins from a few hours up to about 2 days after ascent.Two events frequently occur:# Acute cerebral edema- This is believed to result from -# Hypoxia > causing Local vasodilation of the cerebral blood vessels.# Dilation of the arterioles increases blood flow into the capillaries, thus increasing capillary pressure# Increase in capillary pressure in turn causes fluid to leak into the cerebral tissues.- The cerebral edema can then lead to severe disorientation and other effects related to cerebral dysfunction.# Acute pulmonary edema- The severe hypoxia causes the pulmonary arterioles to constrict potently, but the constriction is much greater in some parts of the lungs than in other parts, so that more and more of the pulmonary blood flow is forced through fewer and fewer still unconstricted pulmonary vessels.- The postulated result is that the capillary pressure in these areas of the lungs becomes especially high and local edema occurs.- Allowing the person to breathe oxygen usually reverses the process within hours.Educational Points:CHRONIC MOUNTAIN SICKNESSOccasionally, a person who remains at high altitude too long develops chronic mountain sickness, in which the following effects occur:1) The red cell mass and hematocrit become exceptionally high (*erythropoietin**hematocrit and Hb (chronic hypoxia)2) The pulmonary arterial pressure becomes elevated even more than the normal elevation that occurs during acclimatization,3) The right side of the heart becomes greatly enlarged (Chronic hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction results in RVH).4) The peripheral arterial pressure begins to fall,5) Congestive heart failure ensues, and6) Death often follows unless the person is removed to a lower altitude (atmospheric oxygen * Pao2* ventilation * Paco2)7) 2,3-BPG (binds to Hb so that Hb releases more O2).8) Cellular changes (*mitochondria).9) renal excretion of HCO3 - (e.g., can augment by use of acetazolamide) to compensate for the respiratory alkalosis.",

This principle is called law of projection, e.g., phantom limb & cortical stimulation during neurosurgical procedure on conscious patient.WEBER FESCHNER LAW- Magnitude of sensation felt is proportionate to the log of intensity of the stimulus.BELL-MAGENDIE LAW- The basic unit of integrated reflex activity is the reflex arc. This arc consists of a sense organ, an afferent neuron, one or more synapses, which are generally in a central integrating station, an efferent neuron, and an effector.- The afferent neurons enter via the dorsal roots or cranial nerves and have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia or in the homologous ganglia on the cranial nerves.- Efferent fibers leave via the ventral roots or corresponding motor cranial nerves.- The principle that in the spinal cord the dorsal roots are sensory and the ventral roots are motor is known as the Bell-Magendie law.",

        "exp": "Ans. c. (Alpha waves ) (Ref. Guyton physiology 11th ed., 742)NORMAL SLEEPStage of sleepCharacteristic features1. Stage 1 (5%)EEG: The appearance of theta waves (slow 3 to 7 cycles per second)Disappearance of alpha waves - drowsy (rapid 8 to 12 cycles per second)2.

Stage 3 (12.5%)EEG: appearance of delta waves (slowest < 2 cycles per second).Hardest to arouseTends to vanish in the elderlyStage 3 with stage 4 are called slow wave sleep or delta sleep4. Stage 4 (12.5%)EEG: continuation of delta wave5. REM sleep (25%)EEG: Saw-tooth wavesREM like SEX: Pulse & Penile/Clitoral arousal, but |with ageLengthens in time as the night progressesIncreased during the second half of the nightFour simple periodic rhythms recorded in the EEG are alpha, beta, delta, and theta. The four basic rhythms have been associated with various states.RhythmFreq (Hz)Amp (mV)alpha8-1320-200beta13-305-10delta1-520-200theta4-810Alpha: In general, the alpha rhythm is the prominent EEG wave pattern of an adult who is awake but relaxed with eyes closed. Each region of the brain had a characteristic alpha rhythm but alpha waves of the greatest amplitude are recorded from the occipital and parietal regions of the cerebral cortex. In general, amplitudes of alpha waves diminish when subjects open their eyes and are attentive to external stimuli although some subjects trained in relaxation techniques can maintain high alpha amplitudes even with their eyes open.Beta: Beta rhythms occur in individuals who are alert and attentive to external stimuli or exert specific mental effort, or paradoxically, beta rhythms also occur during deep sleep, REM sleep when the eyes switch back and forth. This does not mean that there is less electrical activity, rather that the \"positive\" and \"negative\" activities are starting to counterbalance so that the sum of the electrical activity is less. Thus, instead of getting the wave-like synchronized pattern of alpha waves, desynchronization or alpha block occurs. So, the beta wave represents arousal of the cortex to a higher state of alertness or tension. It may also be associated with \"remembering\" or retrieving memories.Delta and Theta: Delta and theta rhythms are low-frequency EEG patterns that increase during sleep in the normal adult. As people move from lighter to deeper stages of sleep (prior to REM sleep), the occurrence of alpha waves diminish and is gradually replaced by the lower frequency theta and then delta frequency rhythms.Additional Educational Points:NEUROTRANSMITTERS OF SLEEP (T SA-ND4)Serotonin# | during sleep -Initiates sleepAcetylcholine# | during sleep -| REM sleepNorepinephrine# | during sleep -|REM sleepDopamine# | during sleep - | arousal & wakefulnessCHEMICAL EFFECTS ON SLEEP# Tryptophan# | Serotonin; | total sleep time# Dopamine agonists (Bromocriptine)# Produces arousal; | total sleep time# Dopamine antagonists (Haloperidol)# | Arousal; Produce sleep# Imipramine# | Stage 4 & used for Rx of Enuresis# Benzodiazepines# | Stage 4 & used for Rx of Night Terrors & Sleepwalking# Benzodiazepines withdrawal after chronic use# T sleep latency (Can't Sleep)# Alcohol & Barbiturate intoxication# | REM# Alcohol & Barbiturate withdrawal# | REMParasomniasParasomniasSleeping StageCharacteristicsRxNightmare(Bad Dream)Occurs during REM sleepMemory of events depends upon awakening.| during stress.Reported by 50% of the population.REM suppressants such as TricyclicAnti-depressant's (TCAs)Night TerrorOccurs during stages 3 & 4Awakened by scream or intense anxietyNo memory of the event.> in children (Boys)No treatment is necessary OR use drugs to suppress stages 3 & A, such as BenzodiazepinesSleeptalkingCan occur in all stages of sleepUsually involves a few words.May accompany night terrors & sleepwalking. > in children.No treatment is necessary.SleepwalkingOccurs during stages 3 & 4Sequence of behaviors without full consciousness.

        "question": "Which of the following tactile receptors respond to the vibration sense of 30 - 800 Hz?",
        "exp": "Ans. A. Pacinian corpuscles. (Ref. Guyton Physiology 11th/pg. 587; Ganong 23rd/pg. 121-127, 746)Guyton Physiology 11th/pg. 587.........\"Detection of Vibration: All tactile receptors are involved in detection of vibration, although different receptors detect different frequencies of vibration. Pacinian corpuscles can detect signal vibrations from 30 to 800 cycles per second because they respond extremely rapidly to minute and rapid deformations of the tissues, and they also transmit their signals over type Ab nerve fibers, which can transmit as many as 1000 impulses per second. Low-frequency vibrations from 2 up to 80 cycles per second, in contrast, stimulate other tactile receptors, especially Meissner's corpuscles, which are less rapidly adapting than pacinian corpuscles\". The Ruffini ending is a tonic receptor that produces a train of action potentials proportional to the intensity of pressure applied to the skin.Free nerve endings:# found everywhere in the skin and in many other tissues# Can detect touch and pressure.# For instance, even light contact with the cornea of the eye, which contains no other type of nerve ending besides free nerve endings, can nevertheless elicit touch and pressure sensations.Meissner fs corpuscle:# It is a touch receptor with great sensitivity is the Meissner's corpuscle# It is an elongated encapsulated nerve ending of a large (type Ab) myelinated sensory nerve fiber.# Present in the nonhairy parts of the skin and are particularly abundant in the finger- tips, lips, and other areas of the skin where one's ability to discern spatial locations of touch sensations is highly developed.# Meissner's corpuscles adapt in a fraction of a second after they are stimulated, which means that they are particularly sensitive to movement of objects over the surface of the skin as well as to low- frequency vibration.Merkel's discs:# Merkel's discs are often grouped together in a receptor organ called the Iggo dome receptor, which projects upward against the underside of the epithelium of the skin. This causes the epithelium at this point to protrude outward, thus creating a dome and constituting an extremely sensitive receptor.# Also note that the entire group of Merkel's discs is innervated by a single large myelinated nerve fiber (type Ab).# These receptors, along with the Meissner's corpuscles, play extremely important roles in localizing touch sensations to specific surface areas of the body and in determining the texture of what is felt.Hair end-organ:# Slight movement of any hair on the body stimulates a nerve fiber entwining its base. Thus, each hair and its basal nerve fiber, called the hair end-organ, are also a touch receptor.# This receptor adapts readily and, like Meissner's corpuscles, detects mainly- (a) movement of objects on the surface of the body or- (b) initial contact with the body.Ruffini's end-organs:# Located in the deeper layers of the skin and also in still deeper internal tissues are many Ruffini's end-organs, which are multibranched, encapsulated endings.# These endings adapt very slowly and, therefore, are important for signaling continuous states of deformation of the tissues, such as heavy prolonged touch and pressure signals.# They are also found in joint capsules and help to signal the degree of joint rotation.Pacinian corpuscles:# lie both immediately beneath the skin and deep in the fascial tissues of the body.# They are stimulated only by rapid local compression of the tissues because they adapt in a few hundredths of a second.# Therefore, they are particularly important for detecting tissue vibration or other rapid changes in the mechanical state of the tissues.",

Guyton & Hall's Textbook of Medical Physiology 11th/pg. 703 - 705).Function of the Cerebellum in Overall Motor Control:The nervous system uses the cerebellum to coordinate motor control functions at three levels, as follows: Part of cerebellumConsist ofFunction1The vestibulocerebellumConsists principally of the small flocculonodular cerebellar lobes (that lie under the posterior cerebellum) and adjacent portions of the vermis.It provides neural circuits for most of the body's equilibrium movements.2The spinocerebellumConsists of most of the vermis of the posterior and anterior cerebellum plus the adjacent intermediate zones on both sides of the vermis.It provides the circuitry for coordinating mainly movements of the distal portions of the limbs, especially the hands and fingers.3The cerebrocerebellumConsists of the large lateral zones of the cerebellar hemispheres, lateral to the intermediate zones. It receives virtually all its input from the cerebral motor cortex and adjacent premotor and somatosensory cortices of the cerebrum.It transmits its output information in the upward direction back to the brain, functioning in a feedback manner with the cerebral cortical sensorimotor system to plan sequential voluntary body and limb movements, planning these as much as tenths of a second in advance of the actual movements. This is called development of \"motor imagery\" of movements to be performed.Vestibulocerebellum--Its Function in Association with the Brain Stem and Spinal Cord to Control Equilibrium andPostural Movements# The vestibulocerebellum originated phylogenetically at about the same time that the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear developed. Furthermore, loss of the flocculonodular lobes and adjacent portions of the vermis of the cerebellum, which constitute the vestibulocerebellum, causes extreme disturbance of equilibrium and postural movements.# The vestibulocerebellum is especially important in controlling balance between agonist and antagonist muscle con- tractions of the spine, hips, and shoulders during rapid changes in body positions as required by the vestibular apparatus.# It is then the function of the vestibulocerebellum to calculate in advance from these rates and directions where the different parts will be during the next few milliseconds. The results of these calculations are the key to the brain's progression to the next sequential movement.",

EEG with eyes open & mind wandering shows Beta waves.EEG wavesKey FactsAlpha# Happen between 8 and 13 times per second, or 8-13 Hertz (Hz).# Alpha represents a sort of \"idle\" state, or \"ready but not doing much\" state and is normally fairly large over the back third of the brain when the eyes are closed and when you are awake.# Alpha disappears when we either get mentally busy (e.g., open the eyes, start doing intense mental work even eyes closed) or when we become drowsy.# Thus the presence of alpha can show the presence of an awake, resting state,# If it is present at a fairly high voltage when the eyes are open, this would usually indicate an inattentive, daydreamy state.# In fact we often see this sign in adolescents and adults with attentional difficulties.Beta waves# The beta family of waves happen at frequencies from 16-40 Hz or higher.# When we get mentally busy and engaged, we should see alpha \"block,\" or reduce significantly in size.# In its place we see mostly smaller, quicker \"beta\" waves.Delta and theta waves# Are relatively slow.# Delta is usually defined as waves occurring from 1-4 times per second (1-4 Hz).# Theta occurs at 4-7 Hz.# During drowsiness, first alpha disappears, then the size of theta waves begins to increase.# As sleep begins, theta waves get quite large, then become mixed with and eventually give way to slower delta waves.# The presence of delta and theta waves in the waking, eyes open EEG is normal, but only if the waves are fairly small.# High-amplitude slow waves can be signs of various neurological and psychological problems, ranging from epilepsy to ADHD. Educational points:# In a typical night of sleep, a young adult first enters NREM sleep, passes through stages 1 and 2, and spends 70-100 minutes in stages 3 and 4.# Sleep then lightens, and an REM period follows. This cycle is repeated at intervals of about 90 minutes throughout the night. The cycles are similar, though there is less stage 3 and 4 sleep and more REM sleep towards morning.# Thus, four to six REM periods occur per night. REM sleep occupies 80% of total sleep time in premature infants and 50% in full-term neonates.# Thereafter, proportion of REM sleep falls rapidly and plateaus at about 25% until it falls further in old age.# In REM, there occurs | and variable pulse, | and variable blood pressure, penile/clitoral tumescence. ACh is the principal neurotransmitter involved in REM sleep.# Children have more total sleep time and stage 4 sleep than adults.# Serotonergic predominance of raphe nucleus key to initiating sleep.# NE reduces REM sleep.# Extraocular movements during REM due to activity of PPRF (paramedian pontine reticular formation/conjugate gaze center).# Benzodiazepines shorten stage 4 sleep; thus useful for night terrors and sleepwalking# Imipramine is used to treat enuresis because it | stage 4 sleep.# Characteristic feature of NREM stage IV sleep is DELTA waves.FeatureStage of SleepCardiovascular activity in Sleep:Beta wavesAwake with eyes openNREM:BP |with less variability, CO |, vasodilation increases (|flow resistance).Alpha wavesAwake with closed eyesIheta wavesStage 1Tonic REM :BP stays the same, CO stays the same, muscles vasoconstriction.Sleep-SpindlesStage 2Delta wavesStage 3 & 4Phasic REM:BP variable, CO stays the same, whole body vasoconstriction.Beta wavesREM (same as Awake)Mnemonic: (BATS Drink Blood)",

        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) VisionREF: Guyton 12th Ed. Pg 624PRIMARY VISUAL CORTEX is also called visual area I or striate cortex because of the highly striated appearance.The primary visual (VI) cortex is mostly located on the medial aspect of the occipital lobe, and is coextensive with the subcortical nerve fibre stria of Gennari in layer IV, hence its alternative name, the striate cortex.It occupies the upper and lower lips and depths of the posterior part of the calcarine sulcus and extends into the cuneus and lingual gyrus. Posteriorly it is limited by the lunate sulcus, and by polar sulci above and below this sulcus. It extends to the occipital pole.The primary visual cortex receives afferent fibres from the lateral geniculate nucleus via the optic radiation. The latter curves posteriorly and spreads through the white matter of the occipital lobe. Its fibres terminate in strict point-to-point fashion in the striate areaThe primary visual cortex is divided into six functionally distinct layers, labeled 1 through 6. Layer 4, which receives most visual input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), is further divided into 4 layers, labelled 4A, 4B, 4Ca, and 4Cb. Sublamina 4Ca receives most magnocellular input from the LGN; while layer 4Cb receives input from parvocellular pathways .The striate cortex is granular.Layer IV, bearing the stria of Gennari, is commonly divided into three sublayers. Passing from superficial to deep, these are IVA, 1VB (which contains the stria), and JVC. The densely cellular I VC is further subdivided into a superficial I VCa and a deep IVCb. Layer IVB contains only sparse, mainly non-pyramidal, neurones. The input to area 17 from the lateral geniculate nucleus terminates predominantly in layers IVA and IVC.",

They, then, deacetylate a variety' of proteins causing induction of catabolic processes and inhibition of anabolic processes.o SIRT-1 and SIRT-3 coordinated increase cellular energy' stores and ultimately maintain cellular energy homeostasis,o Genetic variant in SIRT-1 gene is associated lower risk of cardiovascular mortality and with better cognitive functioning.o SIRT-l variants are associated with decreased basal energy expenditure and a lower lipid peroxidation rate. Therefore, it has been proposed that genetic variation in SIRT-l may determine the response rates of individuales undergoing caloric restriction and increased physical activity,o Genetic variants of SIRT-3 may be associated with increased longevity (increased lifespan), but there is no evidence of such an association.o Mammals have seven sirtuins :1) SIRT-1- Intranuclear2) SIRT-2- Cytoplasmic3) SIRT-3, SIRT-4, SIRT-5- Mitochondrial4) SIRT-6- Heterochromatin-associated nuclear5) SJRT-7- Nucleolaro SIRT-1 and SIRT-3 have been studied the most in relation to phenotypes in human.",

It is transmitted by relatively thick nerve fibers, although this is relative, because they are still microscopically thin, with a diameter of 2 to 5 thousandth of a millimeter. These nerves are called A-delta fibers. Because of their relatively thick size, these nerve fibers allow the pain stimulus to be transferred very fast (at a speed of five to 30 meter/second), hence the name. This is all to make the body withdraw immediately from the painful and harmful stimulus, in order to avoid further damage.# Slow pain, which starts immediately after the fast pain, is transmitted by very thin nerve fibers, called C-nerve fibers (their diameter is between 0.2 to 1 thousandth of a millimeter). Because of their small size, the pain impulse can only be transmitted slowly to the brain, at a speed of less than 2 meters per second.

The conduction system is made up of modified cardiac muscles.o Most of cells of the conducting system are specialized for fast conduction though some, like the cells of the AV node, are specialized for slowing down conduction.o The fastest conduction is seen in purkinje system and slowest in AV node and SA node.Cardiac tissueConduction velocity (meter/second)SA node0.05Inteatrial pathways1Atrial muscle0.30AV nixie0 .05 (minimum)Bundle of His1Purkinje system4 (maximum)Ventricular muscle1o Cells of the conductive system also possess automaticity, i.e., the capability of spontaneous excitation.o However, the rate at which different parts of conductive system discharge impulses is not the same.o The SA node discharges impulses at fastest rate, hence the rate at which SA node fires determines the heart rate, therefore, SA node is normal pacemaker of the heart, i.e., it determines the pace of the heart.o The AV node has the next highest automaticity after SA node; therefore, if the SA node stops discharging, the AV node takes over the role of cardiac pacemaker.Conduction of cardiac impulseo The cardiac impulse originates in the SA node.o From SA node it is transmitted to AV node via interatrial pathways (intemodal atrial pathways).o From AV node it is rapidly transmitted to bundle of his and then purkinje system to all parts of ventricles.o In the ventricles, endocardial surface depolarizes before epicardial surface.o Order of spread of impulse (depolarization) in ventricular myocardium is as follow : Depolarization starts at the left side of interventricular septum and then moves to the right across the mid portion of septum.o The wave then spreads down the septum to the apex of heart.o It returns along the ventricular walls to the AV groove, proceeding from the endocardial to epicardial surface.o The last parts of the heart to be depolarized are the posterobasal portion of the left ventricles, the pulmonary conus, and the upper most portion of the septum.o The sequence of repolarization is not exactly the same as that of depolarization.o Although the septum and endocardial surface of ventricles depolarizes first, it is the epicardial surface which repolarizes first, i.e., repolarization spreads from epicardium to endocarium.",

Fine motor coordination is done by cerebellum.It is the basal ganglia that help to plan (programming) and coordinate complex voluntary movements. Pyrami- dal tract does not contain sensory fibres.The probable sequence of events in motor activity:-First there develops a will, but the area of brain where the will develops is uncertain.Programming- From the area where the will develops, impulses are sent to the motor cortex. These impulses are first programmed and the pro-grammed impulses now determine which area of motor cortex is to be stimulated. This programming is done in basal ganglia.-Activation of pyramidal system-The motor cortex is now fired, so that pyramidal tract fibres now become fired - Firing of LMN - contraction of skeletal muscles- action.* The extrapyramidal system is also concomitantly fired. This causes postural adjustment necessary for voluntary act.* When the voluntary motor activity is performed, the cerebellum receives input from both pyramidal and extrapyramidal system and controls both pyramidal and extrapyramidal activity.* Motor cortex fires --Impulses descends through pyramidal system. On their way they inform the cer- ebellum through corticopontocerebellar and olivocerebellar paths. * The cerebellum also receives feed back from various sources like muscles, joints and visual cortex, regarding whether the goal had been achieved or if there is any readjustment needed.* If any readjustment is needed the impulses are sent to area 4 or motor cortex through dentothalamo cortical and dentorubrothalamocortical paths.* Through them activities of area 4 can be adjusted. These readjustments make the voluntary actions automatic, highly precise and smooth.Corticospinal system or the pyramidal system is concerned with the voluntary control of muscular (motor) activity.

        "exp": "Ans. A. TouchCUTANEOUS MECHANORECEPTORS: -Sensory receptors can be specialized dendritic endings of afferent nerve fibers, and they are often associated with non- neural cells that surround them forming a sense organ. Touch and pressure are sensed by four types of mechanoreceptors.a. Meissner corpuscles are dendrites encapsulated in connective tissue and respond to changes in texture and slow vibrations.b. Merkel cells are expanded dendritic endings, and they respond to sustained pressure and touch.c. Ruffini corpuscles are enlarged dendritic endings with elongated capsules, and they respond to sustained pressure.d. Pacinian corpuscles consist of unmyelinated dendritic endings of a sensory nerve fiber, 2 um in diameter, encapsulated by concentric lamellae of connective tissue that give the organ the appearance of a cocktail onion. These receptors respond to deep pressure and fast vibration.e. The sensory nerves from these mechanoreceptors are large myelinated Aa and Ab fibers whose conduction velocities range from ~ 70-120 to ~ 40-75 m/s, respectively.a. Sensory systems encode four elementary attributes of stimuli: modality, location (receptive field), intensity, and duration (timing).b. The human hand has four types of mechanoreceptors; their combined activation produces the sensation of contact with an object. Selective activation of Merkel cells and Ruffini endings causes sensation of steady pressure; selective activation of Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles causes tingling and vibratory sensation.c. Location of a stimulus is encoded by spatial distribution of the population of receptors activated. A receptor fires only when the skin close to its sensory terminals is touched. These receptive fields of mechanoreceptors (shown as red areas on fingertips) differ in size and response to touch. Merkel cells and Meissner corpuscles provide the most precise localization as they have the smallest receptive fields and are most sensitive to pressure applied by a small probe.d. Stimulus intensity is signaled by firing rates of individual receptors; duration of stimulus is signaled by time course of firing. The spike trains indicate action potentials elicited by pressure from a small probe at the center of each receptive field. Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles adapt rapidly; the others adapt slowly.",

Cerebral metabolism - cerebral blood flow varies directly with metabolic activity, various studies have shown that regional CBF parallels metabolic activity for eg motor activity of a limb is associated with an increased in regional CBF of the corresponding motor cortex. Similarily, visual activity is associated with an increase in regional CBF of the corresponding occipital cortex.B. Cerebral Perfusion pressure: is the difference between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) or central venous pressure (CVP) which ever is greater CPP is normally 80-100 mm Hg. Because ICP is normally less than 10 mm Hg. CPP is primarily dependent on MAP. Autoregulation maintains a steady CBF as perfusion pressure varies between 60 and 160 mm Hg. Decrease in CPP results in cerebral vasodilation, where as elevations induce vasoconstriction.C. Arterial PCO2 - The most important extrinsic influences on CBF are respiratory gas tensions particularly arterial PCO2. CBF is directly proportional to arterial PCO2 between tensions of 20 and 80 mm of Hg. The effect is almost immediates and is thought to be secondary to changes in the PH of CSF and cerebral tissueD. Arterial PO2: only marked changes in arterial PO2 alter CBF whereas hypoxia may be associated with only minimal decrease (-10%) in CBF severe hypoxemia (arterial PO2 less than 50 mm Hg) profoundly increases CBFE. Temperature - CBF changes 5 - 7% 1degC change in temperature. Hypothermia decreases both cerebral metabolic rate and CBF. Whereas pyrexia has the reverse effect.F. Blood viscosity - CBF rises as viscosity falls and vise versaG. Autonomic system* Cerebral blood flow is maintained at constant levels (does not change) in response to moderate exercise)**** Mild to moderate decrease in perfusion pressure decreases driving forces for flow, resulting in CO2 accumulation, which by release of H+ produces cerebral vasodilation.* Most important factor for regulating cerebral blood flow under normal conditions is the rate of cerebral CO2formation.",

Guyton Physiology 11thIpg. 743; Fig.59-4; Ganong 23rd/pg. 121-127, 746)Guyton Physiology 11th/pg. 743....................Alpha waves are rhythmical waves that occur at frequencies between 8 and 13 cycles per second and are found in the EEGs of almost all normal adult people when they are awake and in a quiet, resting state of cerebration. These waves occur most intensely in the occipital region but can also be recorded from the parietal and frontal regions of the scalp. Their voltage usually is about 50 microvolts. During deep sleep, the alpha waves disappear.When the awake person's attention is directed to some specific type of mental activity, the alpha waves are replaced by asynchronous, higher-frequency but lower-voltage beta waves. The effect on the alpha waves of simply opening the eyes in bright light and then closing the eye is that the visual sensations cause immediate cessation of the alpha waves and that these are replaced by low-voltage, asynchronous beta waves.Beta waves occur at frequencies greater than 14 cycles per second and as high as 80 cycles per second. They are recorded mainly from the parietal and frontal regions during specific activation of these parts of the brain.Theta waves have frequencies between 4 and 7 cycles per second. They occur normally in the parietal and temporal regions in children, but they also occur during emotional stress in some adults, particularly during disappointment and frustration. Theta waves also occur in many brain disorders, often in degenerative brain states.Delta waves include all the waves of the EEG with frequencies less than 3.5 cycles per second, and they often have voltages two to four times greater than most other types of brain waves. They occur in very deep sleep, in infancy, and in serious organic brain disease. They also occur in the cortex of animals that have had subcortical transections separating the cerebral cortex from the thalamus. Therefore, delta waves can occur strictly in the cortex independent of activities in lower regions of the brain.",

Chapter 10, Figure 10-6.)Umami is the fifth taste sense triggered by glutamate and particularly by the monosodium glutamate (MSG) used so extensively in Asian cooking. The taste is pleasant and sweet but differs from the standard sweet taste. The action of umami receptors explains why foods treated with MSG often taste fuller.UMAMI# Humans have five established basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salt, and umami.# Umami is one of the five basic tastes sensed by specialized receptor cells present on the human tongue.# Umami is a Japanese word meaning \"savory\" or \"meaty\" and thus applies to the sensation of savoriness--specifically, to the detection of glutamates, which are especially common in meats, cheese and other protein-heavy foods.# Afferent nerves to the nucleus tractus solitarius contain fibers from all types of taste buds, without any clear localization of types.TASTE RECEPTORS# The sour taste is triggered by protons.# Umami taste is due to activation of a truncated metabotopic glutamate receptor, mGluR4, in the taste buds, and the agonists are purine 5-ribonucleotides such as IMP and GMP in the food.# Bitter taste is produced by a variety of unrelated compounds, many of which are poisons. It was originally thought that a single bitter receptor was linked to the heterotrimeric G protein gustducin.# A taste modifier protein, miraculin, has been discovered in a plant. When applied to the tongue, this protein makes acids taste sweet.# A protein that binds taste-producing molecules has been cloned. It is produced by Ebner's glands--glands that secrete mucus into the cleft around vallate papillae and probably have a concentrating and transport function similar to that of the OBP in olfaction.# In humans, the taste buds are located in the mucosa of the epiglottis, palate, and pharynx and in the walls of the fungiform and vallate papillae of the tongue.# The fungiform papillae are rounded structures most numerous near the tip of the tongue; the vallate papillae are prominent structures arranged in a V on the back of the tongue. Each fungiform papilla has up to five taste buds, and they are usually located at the top of the papilla.# The larger vallate papillae each contain up to 100 taste buds, usually located along the sides of the papillae. The small conical filiform papillae that cover the dorsum of the tongue do not usually contain taste buds.# There are a total of about 10,000 taste buds.",

The latter is bound to a lysine residue of opsin which is embedded in this protein; it is stably kept in place by weak interactions with two other amino acid residues.* In response of light, there is an isoform conversion of Vitamin-A, which happens in acyclic form which as initially identified by Wald. It is also called as Wald visual cycle for which George Wald rewarded with Noble prize in 1964.* Photic stimuli trigger a primary photochemical reaction in rhodopsin in which 11-cis-retinal is converted to all-trans- retinal.* Even without continued photic stimulation, the reaction yields bathorhodopsin, the intermediates lumirhodopsin and metarhodopsin I, and finally metarhodopsin II.* Metarhodopsin II activates a G protein called transducing (Gt), which in turn activates a phosphodiesterase.* The conversion of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to 5'-GMP catalyzes by Phosphodiesterase; so, cGMP levels decrease.* Due to decreased levels of cGMP leads to closure of Na+ channels - Hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cell membrane (As inward Na+ current decreased).* When the photoreceptor is hyperpolarized, there is decreased release of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter.

In particular, CRH and vasopressin stimulate the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), once known as corticotropin. ACTH in turn acts on: Adrenal cortex, which produces glucocorticoid hormones (mainly cortisol in humans) in response to stimulation by ACTH. Glucocorticoids in turn act back on the hypo- thalamus and pituitary (to suppress CRH and ACTH production) in a negative feedback cycle.> CRH & Vasopressin are released from neurosecretory nerve terminals at the median eminence.> CRH is transported to the anterior pituitary through the portal blood vessel system of the hypophyseal stalk & vasopressin is transported by axonal trans- port to the posterior pituitary gland.> CRH and vasopressin act synergistically to stimulate the secretion of stored ACTH from corticotrope cells.> ACTH is transported by the blood to the adrenal cortex of the adrenal gland, and it rapidly stimulates biosynthesis of corticosteroids such as cortisol from cholesterol.> Cortisol is a major stress hormone and has effects on many tissues in the body, including the brain. In the brain, cortisol acts on two types of receptor - mineralocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid receptors, and these are expressed by many different types of neurons. One important target of glucocorticoids is the hypothalamus, which is a major controlling centre of the HPA axis.> Vasopressin can be thought of as \"water conservation hormone\" and is also known as \"antidiuretic hormone.\" It is released when the body is dehydrated and has potent water-conserving effects on the kidney. It is also a potent vasoconstrictor.# Important to the function of the HPA axis are some of the feedback loops: Cortisol produced in the adrenal cortex will negatively feedback to inhibit both the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland. Reduces the secretion of CRH and vasopressin, and also directly reduces the cleavage of propiomelanocortin (POMC) into ACTH and b-endorphins. Epinephrine and norepinephrine (E/NE) are produced by the adrenal medulla through sympathetic stimulation and the local effects of cortisol (upregulation enzymes to make E/NE).
