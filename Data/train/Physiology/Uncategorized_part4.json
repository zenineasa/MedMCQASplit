Towards the end of follicular phase the levels of estradiol increases dramatically and exes a positive feedback at both hypothalamus and anterior pituitary causing LH surge. LH surge last for 48 hours and ovulation occurs approximately 36 to 40 hours after the onset of LH surge. The LH surge: Acts rapidly on both the granulosa and theca cells of the preovulatory follicle and turn on the expression of genes required for ovulation and luteinization. It also initiates the re entry of the oocyte into meiosis, expansion of the cumulus oophorus, synthesis of prostaglandins, and luteinization of granulosa cells.

        "exp": "Ans. D: Deep sleep Alpha waves generally are seen in all age groups but are most common in adults. They occur rhythmically on both sides of the head but are often slightly higher in amplitude on the nondominant side, especially in right-handed individuals. A normal alpha variant is noted when a harmonic of alpha frequency occurs in the posterior head regions. They tend to be present posteriorly more than anteriorly and are especially prominent with closed eyes and with relaxation. Alpha activity disappears normally with attention (e. g., mental arithmetic, stress, opening eyes). In most instances, it is regarded as a normal waveform. An abnormal exception is alpha coma, most often caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy of destructive processes in the pons (e. g., intracerebral hemorrhage). In alpha coma, alpha waves are distributed uniformly both anteriorly and posteriorly in patients who are unresponsive to stimuli. Beta waves are observed in all age groups. They tend to be small in amplitude and usually are symmetric and more evident anteriorly. Drugs, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, augment beta waves. Theta waves normally are seen in sleep at any age. In awake adults, these waves are abnormal if they occur in excess. Theta and delta waves are known collectively as slow waves. Delta waves are slow waves have a frequency of 3 Hz or less. They normally are seen in deep sleep in adults as well as in infants and children. Delta waves are abnormal in the awake adult. Often, they have the largest amplitude of all waves. Delta waves can be focal (local pathology) or diffuse (generalized dysfunction).",

Lower esophageal sphincter Unlike the rest of the esophagus, the musculature of the gastroesophageal junction (lower esophageal sphincter; LES) is tonically active but relaxes on swallowing. The tonic activity of the LES between meals prevents reflux of gastirc contents into the esophagus. o The LES is made up of three components. The esophageal smooth muscle is more prominent at the junction with the stomach (intrinsic sphincter). Fibers of the crural poion of the diaphragm, a skeletal, a skeletal muscles, surround the esophagus at this point (extrinsic sphincter) and exe a pinchcock-like action on the esophagus. In addition, the oblique or sling fibers of the stomach wall create a flap valve that helps close off the esophagogastric junction and prevent regurgitation when intragastric pressure rises. The tone of the LES is under neural control. Release of acetylcholine from vagal endings causes the intrinsic sphincter to contact, and release of NO and VIP from interneurons innervated by other vagal fibers causes it to relax. Contraction of the crural poion of the diaphragm, which is innervated by the phrenic nerves, is coordinated with respiration and contractions of chest and abdominal muscles. Thus, the intrinsic and extrinsic sphincters operate together to permit orderly flow of food into the stomach and to prevent reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus.",

        "exp": "C i. e. Ca++-Nat Channel In cardiac (e. g. ventricular) muscle, rapid depolarization phase (0) is d/t Nat influx through rapidly opening fast Nat channels (Nat current, INa); initial rapid repolarization phase (1) is d/t inactivation of Nat channel; platue phase (2) is d/t Cattinflux (Ca+tcurrent, Ica) through more slowly opening (slow) Ca++channels (also called calcium-sodium channels) and a slow repolarization phase (3) due to net Kt efflux through multiple types of K+ channels, allows the cell to return to resting membrane potential. Myocardial fibers (cells) have RMP of approximately -90mv. Action Potential in Cardiac Ventricular Muscles volts in ventricular muscle fibers instead of -55 milivolts in the nodal fibers. - Action potential in cardiac muscle fibers averages about 105 mili volts i. e. the intracellular potential rises form a very negative -90 mV between beats to slightly positive +20 mV during each beat. 3 type of membrane ion channels in cardiac muscles responsible for causing the voltage changes include Channel Effect Fast Na' Rapidly opening of fast sodium channels for Channel 10, 000 the of a second) causes rapid influx of positive sodium ion (Na+) to the interior of cardiac muscle fiber (Necurrent, IN.). It is responsible for rapid upstroke spike of action potential or rapid depolarization phase 0. Initial rapid repolarization phase lis caused by inactivation of Na+ channels. Slow Ca++ Slower opening of slow calcium (or sodium? (Na+ - Ca++) calcium) channels for about 0. 3 second (i. e Channels longer duration) causes large influx of both Ca*+ and Na+ positive ions to interior of cardiac muscle fibre. This (Ca++ current/influx, Ica mainly) is responsible for maintenance of prolonged period of depolarization or platue phase (2) of ventricular AP. Potassium Rapid diffusion of large amounts of positive K+ (K+) Channels ions in outward direction (efflux) from the cardiac muscle fibre (Ek+, K+ current) immediately returns the membrane potential to its resting levels, thus ending the AP Difference b/w AP of Cardiac of Skeletal Muscles Cardiac muscles have prolonged AP (Action potential) and a platue phase, whereas skeletal muscles do not because AP of skeletal muscle is caused and almost entirely by sudden opening of fast Na+ channels for a very sho period. At the end of this abrupt closure, repolarization occurs and AP is over in another thousandth of a second. Whereas AP in cardiac muscle is caused by same fast Na+ channels as well as slow Ca+ (Na+ - channels which are slower to open and more impoantly remain open for several tenths of a second (i. e prolonged duration) thereby maintaining prolonged period of depolarization, causing the platue phase. In skeletal muscles, Ca++ ions for contraction is derived from intracellular sacroplasmic reticulum. Whereas, in cardiac muscles the Ca** that enters during plate phase activate the muscle contractile process. Immediately after the onset of AP, the permeability of cardiac muscle fiber for K+ decreases about 5 folds as a result of excess Ca++ influx through Ca++ channels. Therefore, greatly decreased outflux of positively charged K+ ions during AP platue in cardiac muscles prevents early return of AP voltage to its resting levels. This greatly decreased K+ permeability is not seen in skeletal muscles. Difference b/w AP of Cardiac Muscle & Sinus Nodal Fibers - AT the less negative (- 55 mV) RMP of nodal fibers the fast Na* channels mainly have already become inactivated (or blocked). Therefore only the slow Na+ channels can become activated (open) and cause AP. - So AP is slower to develop in nodal fibers than ventricular fibers. Similarly return of potential to its negative resting state occurs slowly as well rather than the abrupt return that occurs in ventricular muscles.",

In muscle, fat, and some other tissues, insulin facilitates glucose entry into cells by increasing the number of glucose transpoers in the cell membranes. The glucose transpoers that are responsible for facilitated diffusion of glucose across cell membranes are a family of closely related proteins that cross the cell membrane 12 times and have their amino and carboxyl terminals inside the cell. They differ from and have no homology with the sodium-dependent glucose transpoers, SGLT 1 and SGLT 2, responsible for the secondary active transpo of glucose out of the intestine, although the SGLTs also have 12 transmembrane domains. Paicularly in transmembrane helical segments 3, 5, 7, and 11, the amino acids of the facilitative transpoers appear to surround channels that glucose can enter. Presumably, conformation then changes and glucose is released inside the cell.",

B: Law of projection No matter where a paicular sensory pathway is stimulated along its course to the coex, the conscious sensation produced is referred to the location of the receptor. This principle is called the law of projection. Coical stimulation experiments during neurosurgical procedures on conscious patients illustrate this phenomenon. For example, when the coical receiving area for impulses from the left hand is stimulated, the patient repos sensation in the left hand, not in the head. Another example is seen in amputees. Some of these patients may complain, often bitterly, of pain and proprioceptive sensations in the absent limb (phantom limb). The ends of the nerves cut at the time of amputation often form nerve tangles called neuromas. These may discharge spontaneously or when pressure is put on them. The impulses generated in them are in nerve fibers that previously came from sense organs in the amputated limb, and the sensations evoked are projected to where the receptors used to be.",

This finding suppos which of the following features of neoplasia?",
        "exp": "G6. PD is an enzyme involved in carbohydrate metabolism-it is neither an oncogene nor a tumor suppressor, and its altered expression in tumor cells is solely due to its location on the X chromosome. Each somatic cell expresses only one X chromosome, and thus only one of the two isotypes of G6. PD. The presence of only one form of G6. PD in the tumor cells reflects the monoclonal origin of the cells. Cells contained in the neoplasm express only a single isotype of G6. PD because they are all derived from a single progenitor cell. Genetic mutation does not underlie the monotypic expression of G6. PD in the tumor cells. The allele for G6. PD not expressed in the monoclonal cell line was inactivated in embryogenesis (in the Barr body). Although genetic mutation is a requirement of neoplasia, it is not demonstrated by this phenomenon. Mosaicism is the expression of two or more different phenotypes heterogeneously throughout an organ or organism. Mosaicism usually reflects an asymmetry of mitotic division in embryogenesis. G6. PD is not an oncogene, it is a metabolic enzyme expressed constitutively in all cells. Altered expression of G6. PD does not produce any growth advantage in a cell. Ref: Van Solinge W.

        "question": "Hypehyroid state is characterized by?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Lipolysis. In hypehyroidism all effects of thyroid hormone are aggravated:-i) Calorigenic effect:- Thyroid hormones enhance oxygen consumption, and hence the basal metabolic rate (BMR). This may be at least paly due to increase in the activity of membrane Nall(' ATPase. Thyroid hormones also increase the number and activity of mitochondria, which may be the cause or the effect of increase in oxygen consumption. By increasing the BMR, thyroid hormones raise body temperature, loss of body weight and increase urinary nitrogen loss. ii) Growth and development:- Thyroid hormones are essential for normal growth and development. iii) Carbohydrate metabolism:- Thyroid hormones have both hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic effects. The hypoglycemic effect is the increased glycolysis. The hyperglycemic effects are stimulation of glycogenolysis and glucoconeogenesis. The net effect is hyperglycemia and depletion of glycogen. iv) Fat metabolism:- Thyroid hormone stimulates both lipogenesis and lipolysis. The lipolysis exceeds lipogenesis. Thus thyroid hormones moblize fat from adipose tissue, leading to an increase in plasma concentration of FFAs. v) Protein metabolism: - Thyroid hormone has a protein anabolic effect but in large doses, it has a protein catabolic effect. Thus thyroid hormone increases both protein synthesis and protein degradation. vi) Cardiovascular effects:- The thyroid hormones increase the heart rate, cardiac contractility, stroke volume and cardiac output, and consequently also the systolic BP. But the diastolic BP may fall due to vasodilatation in several vascular beds with decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. The cardiovascular effects of thyroid hormones are paly mediated by potentiation of effects of catecholamines. vii) GIT:- Thyroid hormones increase GI secretion, absorption and motility. viii) Nervous system:- Thyroid hormones are essential for normal formation of synapses and myelination in the developing brain. ix) Respiratory system:- Thyroid hormones increase the rate and depth of respiration. About option a & d. In low concentration thyroid hormone increases protein synthesis, but in high concentration (as in hypehyroidism) it is catabolic. Hypehyroidism causes decrease in cholesterol due thyroxine induced increased LDL receptor synthesis in liver, and consequent increase in the removal of LDL from circulation.",

Physical examination reveals a slightly enlarged, non-tender thyroid gland, and a normal cardiac exam. The serum thyroxine (T4) level is increased; however, the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is normal. Which of the following best explains the laboratory findings in this patient?",
        "exp": "The total serum thyroxine (T4) represents the sum of the T4 bound to thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) and the free T4. An increased total T4 may be due to an increase in TBG or an increase in free T4, the latter leading to signs of thyrotoxicosis. A decreased total T4 may be secondary to a reduction in TBG or in free T4, the latter leading to signs of hypothyroidism. In a euthyroid state, one-third of the binding sites on TBG are occupied by T4. An increase in estrogen (pregnancy, bih control pills) increases the synthesis of TBG. Since one-third of the binding sites on TBG will be occupied, the T4 bound to the additional TBG increases the total serum T4. The addition of extra TBG does not alter the free T4 level because of the equilibrium between the serum concentration of T4 and thyroid gland T4 production. Since the free T4 level is normal, there is no stimulus to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland. Regarding the patient's enlarged thyroid gland, heat intolerance, and palpitations, these are normal findings in pregnancy and do not indicate an overactive thyroid gland. Estrogen is increased (not decreased) in pregnancy. The serum free T4 is normal in pregnancy. This explains why the serum TSH is normal in the presence of an elevated serum T4, which reflects the increase in TBG normally occurring in pregnancy. The increase in progesterone during pregnancy has no effect on TBG levels.",

The lack of much effect on the resting membrane potential would be predicted, since the permeability of the membrane to Na+ at rest is relatively low. Conversely, increasing the external K+ concentration decreases the resting membrane potential.

        "exp": "Cretinism Cretinism is caused by extreme hypothyroidism during fetal life, infancy, or childhood. This condition is characterized especially by failure of body growth and by mental retardation. It results from congenital lack of a thyroid gland (congenital cretinism), from failure of the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormone because of a genetic defect of the gland, or from a lack of iodine in the diet (endemic cretinism). A neonate without a thyroid gland may have a normal appearance and function because it was supplied with some (but usually not enough) thyroid hormone by the mother while in utero. A few weeks after birth, however, the neonate's movements become sluggish and both physical and mental growth begin to be greatly retarded. Treatment of the neonate with cretinism at any time with adequate iodine or thyroxine usually causes normal return of physical growth, but unless the cretinism is treated within a few weeks after birth, mental growth remains permanently retarded. This state results from retardation of the growth, branching, and myelination of the neuronal cells of the central nervous system at this critical time in the normal development of the mental powers. Skeletal growth in a child with cretinism is characteristically more inhibited than is soft tissue growth. As a result of this disproportionate rate of growth, the soft tissues are likely to enlarge excessively, giving the child with cretinism an obese, stocky, and short appearance. Occasionally the tongue becomes so large in relation to the skeletal growth that it obstructs swallowing and breathing, inducing a characteristic guttural breathing that sometimes chokes the child.

        "exp": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis occurs at membrane indentations where the protein clathrin accumulates. Clathrin molecules have the shape of triskelions, with three \"legs\" radiating from a central hub. As endocytosis progresses, the clathrin molecules form a geometric array that surrounds the endocytotic vesicle. At the neck of the vesicle, the GTP binding protein dynamin is involved, either directly or indirectly, in pinching off the vesicle. Once the complete vesicle is formed, the clathrin falls off and the three-legged proteins recycle to form another vesicle. The vesicle fuses with and dumps its contents into an early endosome. From the early endosome, a new vesicle can bud off and return to the cell membrane. Alternatively, the early endosome can become a late endosome and fuse with a lysosome in which the contents are digested by the lysosomal proteases. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is responsible for the internalization of many receptors and the ligands bound to them--including, for example, nerve growth factor (NGF) and low-density lipoproteins. It also plays a major role in synaptic function. Also Know: In exocytosis the cytoplasmic sides of two membranes fuse, whereas in endocytosis two non cytoplasmic sides fuse. Ref: Barrett K.

Proteoglycans are protein that contain covalently linked glycosaminoglycans. Examples are syndecan, betaglycan, serglycan, perlecan, aggrecan, versican, decorin, biglycan & firomodulin. The protein of PG that bound covalently to glycosaminoglycans are called core proteins. It is synthesized in endoplasmic reticulum and few GAG linkage also form here. Most of later GAG chains & modification occur in golgi apparatus.- An 0- glycosidic bond between xylose (Xyl) & ser is unique to proteoglycans.- The amount of carbohydrate in PG is usually much greater than found in glycoproteins & may be upto 95% - Aggrecan is found in cailage. QGlycosaminoglycans (GAG) is an unbranched polysacehride made up of repeating disaccharides, one component of which is always an amino sugar, either D- glucosamine (Glc-N), or D- galactosamine (Gal-N).

Diurnal variation in eosinophilic count is reciprocally (invrsely) related to circadian levels of coisolQ.- Suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of hypothalamus is the biological clock responsible for diurnal (circadian) rhythm of ACTH, which intum leads to diurnal rhythm of coisol (glucocoicoid) secretion. In humans, ACTH irregular bursts (episodes of high secretion) are most frequent in early morning and least frequent in the evening. Increased ACTH secretion is not d/t stress of getting up in the morning as these bursts occur before waking up. Even if the length of day is experimentally lengthened to >24 hrs ie if the person is isolated and day's activities are spread over more than 24h, the adrenal cycle also lengthens, but the ACTH burst still occurs during period of sleep. The circadian rhythm of ACTH secretion is present in patients Eosinophil with adrenal insufficiency receiving constant dose of glucocoicoids.- Coisol decrease the number of circulating eosinophils by increasing their sequestration in the spleen & lung. So the diurnal variations in blood eosinophilic counts is inversely related to the circadian coisol levelsQ. The eosinophilic concentration in blood is < 450 / mL usually. A reciprocal relationship to plasma coisol, causes the diurnal eosinophilic concentrations to vary -- 2 fold (40%) with eosinophilic count lowest in morning and peaking in evening.",

DPG binds with deoxygenated hemoglobin but not with oxygenated hemoglobin. Therefore raised DPG concentration releases oxygen from oxyhemoglobin by shifting thefollowing reversible reaction to the right: -HbO, + DPGHb - DPG + 02. One molecule of DPG binds with one mole of deoxyhemoglobin. That is why in the presence of raised DPG concentration, less oxygen can combine with hemoglobin at a given PO2. Hence an increase in DPG concentration shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right. Thus 2, 3 DPG causes delivery (unloading) of O2 to the tissues.",

Most of the ventricular filling occurs in diastole. So at very high heart rates (>180/min) filling may be compromised decreasing cardiac output per minute.- Because of prolonged action potential, cardiac muscles cannot contract in response to a second stimulus until near the end of initial contraction. That's why cardiac muscles cannot be tetanized like skeletal muscles. The highest rate atwhich heart can contract is 400/min (theoretically) but AV node will not conduct >230 impulses/min b/o its long refractory period. Hence ventricular rate > 230/min is onlyseen in paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia.- Exact clinical measurement of isovolumetric ventricular contraction is difficult but simultaneous recordings of ECG, phonocardiogram and carotid pulse can easily measure.

The diagnosis may be confirmed by observing a spontaneous coronary aery spasm (or provoking one by administering ergonovine or acetylcholine, or instructing the patient to hyperventilate) during angiography. Atherosclerosis is the cause of typical angina that occurs with exeion.

It occurs under various circumstances which include excessive Na+ ingestion in absence of corresponding water ingestion, an inability to ingest water due to impairment in thirst mechanisms, unconsciousness or lack of water supply, and insufficient intake of water to keep up with water losses. Near drowning in salt water causes considerable intake of hypeonic salt solution either through swallowing or absorption through pulmonary membranes. Diabetes Insipidus is a result of faulty, or insufficient secretion of ADH (anti diuretic hormone). This leads to increased urinary output of dilute urine with subsequent excess water losses, leading to hyperosmolality of serum. Hyperglycemia, however, tends to decrease serum Na+ concentrations as water shifts from intracellular compaments into intravascular fluids in response to the hyperosmolar state of the serum. Watery diarrhea will produce excess water losses in excess of electrolytes, thus increasing serum Na+ concentration. Ref: Howard C., Berl T. (2009). Chapter 3.

So the medullary interstitium becomes hyperosmolar. Urea is also believed to help in increasing the solute content of the medullary interstitium by diffusing out of the collecting ducts and thus increasing the osmolarity of the interstitium. Water, in turn, is reabsorbed in the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle by osmosis. The cycle continues to work so that the medullary interstitial osmotic pressure is multiplied over and over.

        "exp": "One of the unusual features of meiosis in women is that the oocytes are arrested, for most of the woman's life, in prophase of the first meiotic division. They finish the second meiotic division only after the oocyte has been released from a mature follicle and has been penetrated by a sperm. This paially explains why maternal age has a stronger impact on the risk of trisomies (such as Down's syndrome) than does paternal age, since more things can happen over a 40 year period to chromosomes that are already undergoing meiosis than those that are relatively protected in interphase. Anaphase is the stage during which the chromosomes begin to pull apa from the equatorial plate. Interphase is the stage during which cells are not actively dividing.

Isovolumetric/isometric relaxation time/IVAn interval in the cardiac cycle, from the aoic component of the second heart sound, that is, closure of the aoic valve, to onset of filling by opening of the mitral valve. Ventricular pressure decreases to zero rapidly while aoic pressure decreases only to 80 mm Hg i. e. it remains fairly high. Therefore, intra myocardial compression of blood vessels is minimal and perfusion pressure is maintained fairly high. So coronary blood flow rises sharply. Maximum coronary blood flow occurs during this phase. It can be used as an indicator of diastolic dysfunction. Prolonged IV indicates poor myocardial relaxation. A normal IV is about 70 +- 12 ms, and approximately 10ms longer in people over foy years. In abnormal relaxation, IV is usually in excess of 110ms. With restrictive ventricular filling, it is usually under 60 ms",

        "exp": "Creatine kinase occurs in several different forms, or isoenzymes, in the body. Most tissues contain a mix of creatine kinase isoenzymes, but one species often predominates. The MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase is associated with heart damage; the MM isoenzyme is associated with muscle damage; and the BB isoenzyme is associated with brain damage. Surgery and trauma are commonly implicated as causes of sufficient skeletal muscle trauma to markedly elevated creatine kinase. If isoenzyme studies are done, the CK-MM (skeletal muscle isoenzyme) isoenzyme will be elevated much more markedly than the CK-MB isoenzyme. Bone is not a significant source of CK. Brain can occasionally be a source of creatine kinase (BB isoenzyme), but would not usually be the major source following an automobile accident. Heart damage as in myocardial infarction (unlikely at this age), can elevate creatine kinase, but would not usually be the major source in an automobile accident. If the dilemma arises as to whether an automobile accident was possibly secondary to a myocardial infarction, the ratio of CK-MB to total CK may be helpful in demonstrating a cardiac contribution (CK-MB is characteristic of heart muscle).

The reduced time interval is mainly due to a decrease in the duration of systolic ejection. However, the duration of systole is much more fixed than that of diastole, and when the heart rate is increased, diastole is shoened to a much greater degree.

If yogi are cut, arrest of respiration occurs in inspiration, called apneusis. Apneustic center. Situated in the lower pons. It promotes inspiration by stimulation of the I-neurons in the medulla oblongata providing a constant stimulus. The apneustic center of pons sends signals to the dorsal respiratory center in the medulla to delay the 'switch off' signal of the inspiratory ramp provided by the pneumotaxic center of pons. It controls the intensity of breathing. The apneustic center is inhibited by pulmonary stretch receptors. However, it gives positive impulses to the inspiratory (I) neurons. Apneustic respiration/apneusis. It is an abnormal pattern of breathing characterized by deep, gasping inspiration with a pause at full inspiration followed by a brief, insufficient release. Accompanying signs and symptoms may include decerebrate posturing; fixed, dilated pupils; coma or profound stupor; quadriparesis; absent corneal reflex; absent doll's eye sign; negative oculocephalic reflex; and obliteration of the gag reflex. It is caused by damage to the pons or upper medulla caused by strokes or trauma. Specifically, concurrent removal of input from the vagus nerve and the pneumotaxic center causes this pattern of breathing. It can also be temporarily caused by some drugs, such as ketamine.",

The hormone acts directly on bone and kidney and indirectly on the intestine through its effects on synthesis of 1, 25(OH)2D to increase serum calcium concentrations; in turn, PTH production is closely regulated by the concentration of serum ionized calcium. Any tendency toward hypocalcemia, as might be induced by calcium-deficient diets, is counteracted by an increased secretion of PTH. This in turn (1) increases the rate of dissolution of bone mineral, thereby increasing the flow of calcium from bone into blood; (2) reduces the renal clearance of calcium, returning more of the calcium filtered at the glomerulus into ECF; and (3) increases the efficiency of calcium absorption in the intestine by stimulating the production of 1, 25(OH)2D.

The resulting ischemia cause desquamation of inner? rd of endometrium. The menstrual cast off consist of blood, endometrium, unfeilised ovum, mucus and leukocytes in plenty. During the secretory phase: It covers the last 14 days of menstrual cycle. This phase is mainly influenced by progesterone from corpus luteum and estrogen. During this phase there is an increase in vascularity of the endometrium and endometrial glands get more spiral and touous with glycogen and mucin secretion.

The \" a \" wave corresponds to right Atrial contraction and ends synchronously with the carotid aery pulse. The peak of the 'a' wave demarcates the end of atrial systole. 2. The \" c \" wave corresponds to right ventricular Contraction causing the tri. Cuspid valve to bulge towards the right atrium. 3. The \" x \" descent follows the 'a' wave and corresponds to atrial rela. Xation and rapid atrial filling due to low pressure. 4. The \" x' \" (x prime) descent follows the 'c' wave and occurs as a result of the right ventricle pulling the tricuspid valve downward during ventricular systole. The x' (x prime) descent can be used as a measure of right ventricle contractility. 5.

Haem iron is better absorbed than inorganic iron, but the major fraction of diet is inorganic iron. Inorganic iron is mostly in ferric form; needs to be reduced to ferrous form because iron is absorbed in ferrous form. After absorption, ferrous form is once again oxidized to ferric form inside enterocytes. A fraction of absorbed iron is rapidly delivered to plasma transferrin. However, most of the iron is deposited in the enterocytes as ferritin, some to be transferred more slowly to plasma transferrin, and some to be lost when senescent mucosal cells (enterocytes) are sloughed into the intestine. Iron absorption is regulated according to the demand, e. g., when there is iron deficiency, absorption increases. This regulation is mediated by \"iron metabolism regulatory hormone\", i. e., hepcidin that inhibits iron absorption. When there is iron deficiency, the concentration of hepcidin falls and there is increase iron absorption. Hepcidin also decreases the release of iron from storage sites.",

Physiological effects of Growth hormone Growth hormone has two major action, i. e., (1) Stimulation of skeletal growth, and (2) Regulation of metabolism. 3) Stimulation of skeletal growth. The effect of GH on skeletal growth is mediated by somatomedins (Insulin-like growth factors: IGF). They are synthesized mainly in the liver. The growth promoting action of somatomedins is helped by their insulin like actions. GH, through somatomedin (IGF-1), stimulates proliferation of chondrocytes and osteocytes resulting in increased deposition of chondroitin sulfate in catilage and increased ossification of the newly formed cailage. GH deficiency in early life causes dwarfism (small height). GH excess in early life leads to gigantism, whereas growth hormone excess in adulthood results in acromegaly. 2) Regulation of metabolism. Protein metabolism: - GH has predominantly anabolic effects on skeletal and cardiac muscle where it promotes amino acid transpo into cells and increase protein synthesis. Carbohydrate and fat metabolism: - The effects of GH on carbohydrate and fat metabolism are complicated by the fact that GH has anti-insulin effects, whereas somatomedins it produces have insulin like effects:-i) Anti-insulin effects due to direct effect of GH include decreased peripheral utilization of glucose, increased gluconeogenesis, hyperglycemia, and lipolysis. Due to its anti-insulin effects GH excess can cause insulin resistant diabetes mellitus. ii) Insulin like effects due to somatomedins (IGF) include antilipolytic activity, and other insulin like effects.",

It has a characteristic sigmoid shape due to the T-R interconversion. In deoxyhemoglobin, globin units are tightly bound in a tense (T) configuration which reduces the affinity of the molecule for oxygen. When the first oxygen is bound, the bonds holding the globin units are released, producing a relaxed (R) configuration which exposes more oxygen binding sites. Thus, binding of one oxygen molecule increases the affinity of hemoglobin to bind other O2 molecules. Ascent to high altitude triggers a substantial rise in 2, 3 DPG concentration in red blood cells. Factors causing shift of the curve to right includes: Fall in pH Rise in temperature Increase in 2, 3 BPG pH of the blood falls as its CO2 content increases, so that when PCO2 rises the curve shifts to right.

Tissues that do not depend on insulin for glucose uptake include brain, erythrocytes (RBC), the epithelial cells of kidney & intestine, Liver, and Cornea & lens of eye. The mechanism through which insulin increases glucose uptake is different in different tissues. In the muscle and adipose tissues, insulin increase facilitated diffusion by increasing glucose transpoer (GLUT4) on the cell membrane. In the liver, insulin stimulates glucose entry into hepatocytes indirectly by induction of glucokinase so that the glucose entering the liver cells is promptly conveed to glucose - 6 - phosphate (glucose trapping). This keeps the intracellular glucose concentration low and ours entry of glucose into the liver. Thus, though the liver do not depend on insulin for glucose uptake, insulin stimulates glucose entry into hepatocytes. That means glucose entery can occur in liver without the action of insulin, but this is facilitated by insulin. On the other hand, myocytes (skeletal and cardiac muslces) and adipocytes (adipose tissue) are dependent on insulin for glucose uptake.",

Central chemoreceptors These receptors are located in a chemosensitive area on the ventral surface of the medulla near the exit of the ninth and tenth cranial nerves. The primary stimulus for the central chemoreceptors is an increase in the hydrogen ion concentration. Stimulation of central chemoreceptors by increased hydrogen ion concentration leads to excitation of the respiratory neurons, thereby producing an increase in the rate and depth of respiration. Although the primary stimulus for central chemoreceptors is an increase in hydrogen ion concentration, in actual practice the physiological stimulus is an increase in PCO2. The reason is that hydrogen ions cannot cross blood - brain barrier. Therefore, a change in the blood hydrogen ion concentration does not change the hydrogen ion concentration in the immediate vicinity of the chemosensitive neurons (i. e., in CSF and brain interstitial fluid). On the other hand, CO2 being lipid soluble can easily cross blood brain barrier. It enters the brain, where it is hydrated to give rise to fr and HCO2- ions. Now these H' directly stimulate the central chemoreceptors. Thus, central chemoreceptors are directly stimulated by an increase in H+ concentration in CSF and brain inerstitial tissue, which is brought about by change in aerial PCO2 (Pa. CO2).",

(1) Hypoxic hypoxia, in which the P02 of the aerial blood is reduced; (2) Anemic hypoxia, in which the aerial P02 is normal but the amount of hemoglobin available to carry 02 is reduced; (3) Stagnant or Ischemic hypoxia, in which the blood. flow to a tissue is so low that adequate 02 is not delivered to it despite a normal P02 and hemoglobin concentration; and (4) Histotoxic hypoxia, in which the amount of 02 delivered to a tissue is adequate but, because of the action of a toxic agent, the tissue cells cannot make use of the 02 supplied to them. Hypoxic Hypoxia (Hypoxemia) Hypoxic Hypoxia is the most common form of hypoxia seen clinically. Causes: 1. Low inspired paial pressure of oxygen (low Pi02) 2. Alveolar hypoventilation 3. Impairment of diffusion across blood-gas membrane 4. Ventilation-perfusion inequality 5. Shunt In contrast, primary hemoglobin deficiency, e. g. anemia is not a cause, since it doesn't decrease the paial pressure of oxygen in blood. Low inspired oxygen paial pressure (low Pi. O2) If the paial pressure of oxygen in the inspired gas is low, then a reduced amount of oxygen is delivered to the alveoli of the lung. The reduced oxygen paial pressure can be a result of reduced fractional oxygen content (low Fi02) or simply a result of low barometric pressure, as can occur at high altitudes. This reduced Pi02 can result in hypoxemia even if the lungs are normal. Alveolar hypoventilation If the alverolar ventilation is low, there may be insufficient oxygen delivered to the alveoli each minute. (e. g., airway obstruction, depression of the brain's respiratory center, or muscular weakness). Impaired diffusion Impaired diffusion across the blood-gas membrane in the lung can cause hypoxemia, e. g. pneumonia, pulmonary fibrosis Shunt Shunting of blood from the right side to the left side of the circulation (right-to-left shunt) is a powerful cause of hypoxemia. The shunt may be intracardiac (tong. cyanotic heart disease) or may be intrapulmonary. (Note that Left-toright shunting does not cause hypoxemia.) Ventilation-perfusion inequality Ventilation-perfusion inequality (or ventilation-perfusion mismatch) is a common cause of hypoxemia in people with lung disease. It is the areas of the lung with ventilation/perfusion ratios that are less than one (but not zero) that cause hypoxemia by this mechanism. A ventilation/perfusion ratio of zero is considered a shunt. (Not sure how PCO\\\\ is linked with hypoxemia or Pa. O2; possibl! hypoxemia causes lryperventilation which leads todecreased alveolar and aeial PCO2)",

It is caused by the formation of circulating antibodies to the muscle type of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These antibodies destroy some of the receptors and bind others to neighboring receptors, triggering their removal by endocytosis. The reason for the development of autoimmunity to acetylcholine receptors in this disease is still unknown. Another condition that resembles myasthenia gravis is Lambe-Eaton syndrome. In this condition, muscle weakness is caused by antibodies against one of the Ca2+ channels in the nerve endings at the neuromuscular junction. This decreases the normal Ca2+ influx that causes acetylcholine release. However, muscle strength increases with prolonged contractions as more Ca2+ is released.",

Eating foods with low glycemic index will result in lower glucose levels after meals. Low glycemic index foods have values of 55 or less and include many fruits (apples, oranges) and vegetables, grainy breads, pasta, legumes, milk, and yoghu. High glycemic index foods have values of 70 and over and include baked potato, white bread, and most white rice. Glycemic index is lowered by the presence of fats and protein when the food is consumed in a mixed meal. Cooking methods can also affect the glycemic index--thus mashed potatoes have a higher glycemic index than baked potato. Ref: German M. S. (2011). Chapter 17.

Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (Dipalmitoyllecithin) is the major constituent of surfactant. Surfactant. Surfactant is a Soap-like substance secreted by the type-II pneumocytes of the alveolar epithelium. It is a mixture of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidycholine (dipalmitoyl-lecithin), phosphatidylglycerol, other phospholipids, neutral lipids, Surfactant proteins A, B, C and D (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C and SP-D), and carbohydrates. o Surfactant reduces the alveolar surface tension. This has three impoant physiological consequences:? 1) It reduces the collapsing tendency of lungs. 2) It reduces the natural tendency of the smaller alveoli to collapse and empty into the larger ones. This is called alveolar stabilization. 3) It reduces the tendency of the alveolar interstitial fluid to transudate out into the alveolar space.",

        "exp": "Pepsin production is a normal physiologic activity of the stomach that, in conditions of stress, may overwhelm the stomach's weakened defenses and result in gastric ulceration. Gastric acid production is another condition that may increase and cause acute ulceration. Fuhermore, these two factors may remain unchanged and still result in gastric ulcers if the gastric defenses are weakened by stress. All of the other choices represent normal defensive forces in the stomach. Increased bicarbonate transpo would protect the gastric epithelium from the potentially harmful acidity of the gastric contents. The adherent mucus is relatively alkaline, providing local protection to the superficial mucosa. Gastric epithelial cells can normally replicate rapidly, allowing mucosal defects to be rapidly repaired. Increasing the regenerative capacity of the epithelium would have a protective effect against ulceration. The gastric mucosa is richly supplied with blood, providing the epithelial cells with an ample supply of nutrients, oxygen, and bicarbonate to contend with the harsh gastric microenvironment. Stress ulcers are associated with compromised gastric blood flow, not increased flow. Ref: Mills J. C., Stappenbeck T. S., Bunnett N. (2010). Chapter 13. Gastrointestinal Disease. In S. J. Mc.

        "exp": "The scenario described in the question stem is unfounately not at all uncommon. The open oven door is a tip-off that carbon monoxide was involved. Carbon monoxide has a very high affinity for hemoglobin, and binds, nearly irreversibly, to it in such a manner that oxygen cannot bind, drastically decreasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Carbon monoxide also causes the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to shift to the left, making oxygen more difficult to unload. Traditionally, patients with carbon monoxide poisoning have been described as having \"cherry red\" blood and, consequently, skin, but this change is somewhat unreliable in real life.
