During exercise, the contracting muscles need more O2 for energy production. This need in meet by increasing the blood supply to the muscles. Cardiac activity increases to increase the stroke volume. Capillary bed of the contracting muscle dilates and many previously closed capillaries open up. In contracting muscle the amount of O2 extracted from blood increases (There is a net 3 fold increase in O2 extraction from each unit of blood). This is because of right shift of Hb-O2 dissociation curve. Right shift of Hb-O2 dissociation curve occurs because of -Accumulation of CO2 (Decrease pH)*Increased temp, of contracting muscles*Rise in RBCs 2, 3 - DPG-*",

Important skeletal muscle proteins. Myosin: - Myosin is the protein that constitutes the thick filaments. Myosin of skeletal muscle is myosin-IL Myosin participates in the contractile mechanism and also acts as an ATPase. Actin: - Actin is the major protein of thin filament. It is the actin which slides over myosin during contraction. Tropomyosin: - It is the other protein of thin filament. It covers the active sites (myosin binding sites) on actin. When Ca+2 concentration of cytoplasm (sarcoplasm) is raised, it uncovers the active sites of actin and allow the contraction So, the 'cross-bridge cycling 'is switched off or on by the tropomyosin molecule which slides on the actin molecule to cover or uncover the active sites on it. Troponin: - It is a protein also associated with thin filament. The regulatory action of Ca+2 on tropomysin is mediated by troponin, a Ca+2 binding protein. When the cytoplasmic (sarcoplasmic) Ca+2 concentration rises Ca+2 ions bind to troponin-C. The troponin - Ca+2 complex induces changes in Troponin-I and Troponin-T, which in turn brings about a shift of tropomyosin away from the active sites of actin. When the sarcoplasmic Ca+2 concentration falls, Ca+2 dissociates from troponin-C and tropomyosin slides back on the actin filament to cover the active sites. Thus, the first event during muscle contraction, after cytoplasmic rise in Ca+2 concentration, is binding of troponin C to Ca+2 which trigers the further steps by sliding the tropomysin away from the active sites of actin. o There are additional structural proteins in skeletal muscles, i) Actinin: It binds actin to Z-lines. ii) Titin: It is the largest known protein and connects Z-lines to M-linesand is responsible for passive stiffness of muscle, by limiting range of motion of sarcomere in tension, iii) Desmin: It adds structures to Z-lines in part by binding the Z-lines to plasma membrane.",

        "question": "Golgi tendon apparatus conveys message to CNS, depending upon -",
        "exp": "Ans. A. Tension in muscle. Inverse stretch reflex-a. Up to a point, the harder a muscle is stretched, the stronger is the reflex contraction. However, when the tension becomes great enough, contraction suddenly ceases and the muscle relaxes. This relaxation in response to strong stretch is called the inverse stretch reflex. b. The receptor for the inverse stretch reflex is in the Golgi tendon organ. This organ consists of a netlike collection of knobby nerve endings among the fascicles of a tendon. There are 3-25 muscle fibers per tendon organ. c. The fibers from the Golgi tendon organs make up the Ib group of myelinated, rapidly conducting sensory nerve fibers. Stimulation of these Ib fibers leads to the production of IPSPs on the motor neurons that supply the muscle from which the fibers arise. d. The Ib fibers end in the spinal cord on inhibitory interneurons that in turn terminate directly on the motor neurons. They also make excitatory connections with motor neurons supplying antagonists to the muscle. e. Because the Golgi tendon organs, unlike the spindles, are in series with the muscle fibers, they are stimulated by both passive stretch and active contraction of the muscle. The threshold of the Golgi tendon organs is low. f. The degree of stimulation by passive stretch is not great because the more elastic muscle fibers take up much of the stretch, and this is why it takes a strong stretch to produce relaxation. g. However, discharge is regularly produced by contraction of the muscle, and the Golgi tendon organ thus functions as a transducer in a feedback circuit that regulates muscle force in a manner analogous to the spindle feedback circuit that regulates muscle length. h. The importance of the primary endings in the spindles and the Golgi tendon organs in regulating the velocity of the muscle contraction, muscle length, and muscle force is illustrated by the fact that section of the afferent nerves to an arm causes the limb to hang loosely in a semi paralyzed state. The interaction of spindle discharge, tendon organ discharge, and reciprocal innervation determines the rate of discharge of a-motor neurons",
