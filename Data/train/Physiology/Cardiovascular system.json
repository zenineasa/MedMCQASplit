ICP- intra cranial pressure Head injury causes increased ICP thus lowering CPP causing ischemia. When ICP approaches the level of mean systemic pressure, cerebral perfusion falls. Bodys response to fall in cerebral perfusion is raise systemic blood pressure and dialate cerebral vessels which increases cerebral blood volume and increases ICP followed by lowering CPP. And causes a vicious cycle. When aerial pressure lowers, a reflex called CNS ischaemic response is initiated by the hypothalamus. Hypothalamus activates sympathetic nervous system causing peripheral vasoconstriction and increased cardiac output. This increases aerial pressure and cerebral blood flow is restored.

        "exp": "Bainbridge reflex: When the heart rate is slow, intravenous infusions of blood or electrolyte solutions usually accelerate the heart. Both atria have receptors that are affected by changes in blood volume and that influence the heart rate. These receptors are located principally in the venoatrial junctions: in the right atrium at its junctions with the venae cavae and in the left atrium at its junctions with the pulmonary veins. Distention of these atrial receptors sends afferent impulses to the brainstem in the vagus nerves. The efferent impulses are carried from the brainstem to the SA node by fibers from both autonomic divisions. Bezold-Jarisch reflex or the coronary chemoreflex: Activation of chemosensitive vagal C fibers in the cardiopulmonary region (eg, juxtacapillary region of alveoli, ventricles, atria, great veins, and pulmonary aery) causes profound bradycardia, hypotension, and a brief period of apnea followed by rapid shallow breathing. It can be elicited by a variety of substances including capsaicin, histamine, serotonin, phenylbiguanide, and veratridine. In human this reflex may be activated: During myocardial ischemia or, reperfusion (thrombolytic therapy) as a result of increased production of oxygen radicals. By agents used as radiocontrast for coronary angiography. It is cardioprotective by producing bradycardia, thus reduce the amount substances get absorbed into the blood Vasovagal syncope has been attributed to activation of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex J reflex or pulmonary chemoreflex: Because the C fiber endings are close to pulmonary vessels, they have been called J (juxtacapillary) receptors. They are stimulated by hyperinflation of the lung, but they respond as well to intravenous or intracardiac administration of chemicals such as capsaicin. The reflex response that is produced is apnea followed by rapid breathing, bradycardia, and hypotension Oculocardiac reflex: Traction on the extraocular muscles (especially the medial rectus), conjunctiva, or orbital structures causes hypotension and a reflex slowing of the HR, as well as arrhythmias Cushing's reflex: Increased CSF pressure (intracranial pressure) - cerebral aery compressed - CNS ischemia that causes hypoxia and hypercapnia in medulla, which directly stimulates the vasomotor centre - increased BP - baroreceptor mechanisms causes reflex Bradycardia.

Therefore, in a thin-walled viscus, P = T divided by the two principal radii of curvature of the viscus: P = T(1/r1 + 1/r2) In a sphere, r1 = r2, so P=2T/r In a cylinder such as a blood vessel, one radius is infinite, so P = T/r Ref: Ganong's Review of medical physiology 25th edition. Page: 574 This law helps to understand the physiological nechanisms in altered situations and pathological conditions. Eg: in hollow organs like bladder, ventricle, or alveoli of lungs the wall tension increases when the organ gets fillled ie P rises or the cavity size (R) increases. In ventricular hyperophy, the wall is thick so, wall tension is less. In dialated heart as in heart failure, more energy is required to pump blood as the wall tension is more(increased R). So dialated heart pumos blood less effitiently Capillaries are less prone to rupture because smaller the radius lesser the tension in tha wall needed to balance the distending pressure.",

Because current flows only in the body fluids, the records obtained are those that would be obtained if the electrodes were at the points of attachment of the limbs, no matter where on the limbs the electrodes are placed. In lead I, the electrodes are connected so that an upward deflection is inscribed when the left arm becomes positive relative to the right (left arm positive). In lead II, the electrodes are on the right arm and left leg, with the leg positive; and in lead III, the electrodes are on the left arm and left leg, with the leg positive. The P wave is produced by atrial depolarization, the QRS complex by ventricular depolarization, and the T wave by ventricular repolarization. The U wave is an inconstant finding, believed to be due to slow repolarization of the papillary muscles. The atria are located posteriorly in the chest. The ventricles from the base and anterior surface of the heart, and the right ventricle is anterolateral to the left. Thus, a. VR \"looks at\" the cavities of the ventricles. Atrial depolarization, ventricular depolarization, and ventricular repolarization move away from the exploring electrode, and the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave are therefore all negative (downward) deflections; a. VL and a. VF look at the ventricles, and the deflections are therefore predominantly positive or biphasic. There is no Q wave in V1 and V2 and the initial poion of the QRS complex is a small upward deflection because ventricular depolarization first moves across the midpoion of the septum from left to right toward the exploring electrode. The wave of excitation then moves down the septum and into the left ventricle away from the electrode, producing a large S wave. Finally, it moves back along the ventricular wall toward the electrode, producing the return to the isoelectric line. Conversely, in the left ventricular leads (V4-V6)there may be an initial small Q wave (left to right septal depolarization), and there is a large R wave (septal and left ventricular depolarization) followed in V4 and V5 by a moderate S wave (late depolarization of the ventricular walls moving back toward the AV junction). There is considerable variation in the position of the normal heart, and the position affects the configuration of the electrocardiographic complexes in the various leads.

It can be very effective in treatment of cardiac conditions, but its therapeutic range is narrow; a therapeutic dose is only about one third less than the dose that will induce toxicity. Moreover, physiologic changes due to age, electrolyte disturbances, renal impairment, metabolic disorders, and ceain heart conditions can predispose a patient to digitalis toxicity. Other drugs can also alter the effects of digitalis and lead to toxicity. Signs of Toxicity. Traditionally, nurses have been taught to count the patient&; s pulse or monitor the apical heabeat for rate and rhythm before administering a digitalis preparation. A decreased pulse rate of 60 per minute or less is an indication that the drug should be temporarily discontinued. While this is the most typical sign of digitalis intoxication, there frequently are earlier symptoms that deserve attention. Some of the more common complaints expressed by patients who are in the early stages of toxicity are nausea, blurred vision, mental depression, disorientation, and malaise.

        "exp": "Korotkoff sounds are thought to originate from a combination of turbulent blood flow and oscillations of the aerial wall and have been classified as 5 phases. The Korotkoff sound method tends to give values for systolic pressure that are lower than the true intra-aerial pressure, and diastolic values that are higher. There is general consensus that the fifth phase or disappearance of sound should be taken as DBP, except in situations in which the disappearance of sounds cannot reliably be determined because sounds are audible even after complete deflation of the cuff, for example, in pregnant women, patients with aeriovenous fistulas and aoic insufficiency. The \"ideal\" cuff should have a bladder length that is 80% and a width that is at least 40% of arm circumference (a length-to-width ratio of 2: 1). Cuff should be tied at the level of heart. Due to gravitational force BP decreases above the heart and increases below the heart by 0. 77 mm Hg/cm. For this reason, when measurements are taken in the supine position the arm should be suppoed with a pillow. In the sitting position, the right atrium level is the midpoint of the sternum or the fouh intercostal space. The lower end of the cuff should be 2 to 3 cm above the antecubital fossa to allow room for placement of the stethoscope. Recommended deflation rate: 2 to 3 mm Hg per second Blood pressure is measure falsely high when the cuff is too small relative to the patient's arm circumference. At the initial visit, blood pressure should be measured in both arms. The patient should be instructed to relax as much as possible and to not talk during the measurement procedure; ideally, 5 minutes should elapse before the first reading is taken. In older patients with a wide pulse pressure, the Korotkoff sounds may become inaudible between systolic and diastolic pressure, and reappear as cuff deflation is continued. This phenomenon is known as the auscultatory gap.",

CLINICAL BOX 5-7 Common Drugs That Act on Smooth Muscle Overexcitation of smooth muscle in the airways, such as that observed during an asthma attack, can lead to bronchoconstriction. Inhalers that deliver drugs to the conducting airway are commonly used to offset this smooth muscle bronchoconstriction, as well as other symptoms in the asthmatic airways. The rapid effects of drugs in inhalers are related to smooth muscle relaxation. Rapid response inhaler drugs (eg, Ventolin, albuterol, sambuterol) frequently target b-adrenergic receptors in the airway smooth muscle to elicit a relaxation. Although these b-adrenergic receptor agonists targeting the smooth muscle do not treat all symptoms associated with asthma (eg, inflammation and increased mucus), they act rapidly and frequently allow for sufficient opening of the conducting airway to restore airflow and thus allow for other treatments to reduce airway obstruction. Smooth muscle is also a target for drugs developed to increase blood flow. As discussed in the text, NO is a natural signaling molecule that relaxes smooth muscle by raising cyclic guanosine monophosphate (c. GMP). This signaling pathway is naturally downregulated by the action of phosphodiesterase (PDE), which transforms c. GMP into a non-signaling form, GMP. The drugs sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil are all specific inhibitors of PDE V, an isoform found mainly in the smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum of the penis (see Chapters 25 and 32). Thus, oral administration of these drugs can block the action of PDE V, increasing blood flow in a very limited region in the body and offsetting erectile dysfunction. EDRF was later identified as the gaseous second messenger molecule, nitric oxide (NO). Ref: Ganong&; s Review of medical physiology 25th edition. Page: 117",

        "question": "Diastolic heart failure is impairment in the filling of the left ventricle. Which of the following is LEAST likely to occur?",
        "exp": "Diastolic dysfunction is an impairment in the filling of the left ventricle (\"stiff ventricle\") caused by decreased compliance at a normal left atrial pressure. Systolic heart failure, which is an impairment in contractility, has a better response to positive inotropic agents. Most patients have a combination of both systolic and diastolic dysfunction. In diastolic heart failure, filling of the left ventricle is slow or incomplete (i. e., decreased compliance) unless left atrial pressures increase to maintain the ejection fraction at the expense of increasing pulmonary and systemic venous congestion. Clinical findings include dyspnea, which is the most common symptom, resulting from interstitial and pulmonary edema. Pathophysiologically, there is left atrial hypertension and pulmonary venous hypertension, leading to pulmonary congestion. Therapy is aimed at slowing the heart rate, which promotes filling of the left ventricle at low pressures. -Adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers are effective. Patients with diastolic dysfunction have a better survival rate than those with systolic dysfunction, because the ejection fraction is normal to slightly decreased, albeit at the expense of increased left atrial pressures. Systolic dysfunction is an impairment in contractility of the left ventricle or a defect in the ability ofmyofibrils to shoen against a load. The left ventricle loses its ability to eject blood into the aoa, so the ejection fraction (i. e., stroke volume/left ventricular end-diastolic volume) is decreased (usually < 40%); the normal ejection fraction is 80/120, or 66%, with a range of 55% to 75%. The ejection fraction is measured by echocardiography or radionuclide ventriculography. Signs of isolated systolic dysfunction include fatigue, prerenal azotemia, cool skin, and mental obtundation. The left ventricular chamber eventually dilates and patients develop fatigue, dyspnea, and peripheral edema, which are signs of right-sided heart failure. Examples of systolic dysfunction include post-myocardial infarction, ischemic injury (e. g., acute myocardial infarction), and congestive cardiomyopathy. Therapy is aimed at improving the performance of the left ventricle with the administration of positive inotropic agents and peripheral vasodilators to decrease peripheral resistance.",
