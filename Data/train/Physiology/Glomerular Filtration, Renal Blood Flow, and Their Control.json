        "question": "Juxtaglomerular apparatus is involved in regulation of-",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Tubulo-glomerular feed back Tubulo-glomerular feedbacko To perform the function of autoregulation, the kidneys have a feedback mechanism that links changes in sodium chloride concentration at the macula densa with the control of renal arteriolar resistance. This feedback helps to ensure a relative constant delivery of sodium chloride to the distal tubule and helps prevent spurious fluctuations in renal excretion that would otherwise occur. o The tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism has two components that act together to control GFR: - i). An afferent arteriolar feedback mechanism (usually this component is referred to as tubuloglomerular feedback, and ii) An efferent arteriolar feedback mechanism. o These feedback mechanisms depend on the juxtaglomerular apparatus which consists of: (i) Macula densa, i. e., specialized epithelium of distal tubule where it comes in contact with afferent arteriole, (ii) Juxtaglomerular cells, i. e., modified smooth muscle cells of afferent arteriole, and (iii) Lads cells. i) Afferent arteriolar feedback mechanism:# Decrease in renal arteriolar pressure causes decrease in GFR and as a result low Na. Cl is delivered to distal tubules. This is sensed by macula densa and the signal is transmitted to afferent arterioles which causes decreased resistance of afferent arterioles. Decreased afferent arteriolar resistance increases glomerular hydrostatic pressure and therefore GFR.# The transmitter involves is adenosine which causes opening of Ca+2 channels. ii) Efferent arteriolar feedback mechanism:# Decreases GFR causes delivery of less Na. Cl to distal tubule, which is sensed by macula densa cells and the signal is transmitted to juxtaglomerular (JG) cells which secrete renin. As a result renin angiotensin system is activated and there is generation of angiotensin II which causes constriction of efferent arteriole. This results in increased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and increased GFR. o It would be wise to know about glomerulotubular balance, which may be confused by tubuloglomerular feedback. o Glomerulotubular balance: - Tubular reabsorption in proximal tubules is load-dependent, i. e., when the GFR increase, the reabsorption of the filtrate in the proximal tubule increases proportionately. It occurs because tubular reabsorption is flow-limited. Because of glomerulotubular balance, the urinary Na+ output does not increase massively when the GFR increases.",

FILTRATION COEFFICIENT: Filtration coefficient is a measure of a membrane's permeability to water, taking into account both hydraulic and osmotic pressures. (Note: Filtration coefficient 100= Filterability 1). Filterability of Solutes Is Inversely Related to Their Size. The glomerular capillary membrane is thicker than most other capillaries, but it is also much more porous and therefore filters fluid at a high rate. Despite the high filtration rate, the glomerular filtration barrier is selective in determining which molecules will filter, based on their size and electrical charge. A filterability of 1. 0 as in case of inulin means that the substance is filtered as freely as water. Inulin Clearance Can Be Used to Estimate GFR: If a substance is freely filtered (filtered as freely as water) and is not reabsorbed or secreted by the renal tubules, then the rate at which that substance is excreted in the urine is equal to the filtration rate of the substance by the kidneys.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., All of the above Determinants of GFRIncrease glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure increases GFR. Glomerular hydrostatic pressure is determined by following variables: i) Arterial pressure, ii) Afferent arteriolar resistance; iii) Efferent arteriolar resistance. Increased arterial pressure tends to raise glomerular hydrostatic pressure and, therefore, to increase GFR. Opposite is true for decreased arterial pressure, i. e.. Hypotension causes decrease in GFR. Increased resistance of afferent arterioles (constriction of afferent arterioles) reduces glomerular hydrostatic pressure and decrease GFR. Conversely, dilation of the afferent arterioles increases both glomerular hydrostatic pressure and GFR. Efferent arteriolar constriction has a biphasic effect on GFR. At moderate levels of constriction, there is a slight increase in GFR, but with severe constriction, there is a decrease in GFR. Dilatation of efferent arterile decreases glomerular hydrostatic pressure and therefore decreases GFR. Increased glomerular capillary colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressure decreases GFR. Decreased glomerular capillary colloid osmotic pressure increases GFR,. e. g, in hypoproteinemia. Increased renal blood flow increases GFR by decreasing glomerular capillary' oncotic pressure. Increased RBF causes decrease in filtration fraction (filtration fraction = GFR'RPF). This results in more fluid remaining in the glomerular capillary and dilution of plasma proteins and as a result decrease in oncotic pressure. Conversely, by opposite effect. Decreased renal blood flow decreases GFR. Increased Bowman's capsule hydrostatic pressure (due to increased tubular hydrostatic pressure as a result of obstruction) decreases GFR. Decrease in glomerular capillary filtration coefficient (Kf) decreases GFR. Kf depends on the permeability of the glomerular membrane as well as its surface area. Increased thickness of membrane decreases the permeability and Kf Chronic hypertension and diabetes increases the thickness of glomerular membrane and decrease Kr and thereby GFR. Kf can be altered by the mesangial cells which contract and cause decrease in Kf by decreasing surface area of membrane. Relaxation of mesangial cells increase Kj. Contraction of mesangial cells (therefore decrease in GFR) is produced by: - Endothelin, angiotensin II, vasopressin, norepinephrine, PAF, PDGF, thromboxane A., PGF2 Leukotrienes C4 & D4, Histamine.
