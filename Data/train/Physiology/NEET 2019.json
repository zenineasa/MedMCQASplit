Lacking this input, medullary reticular inhibitor system becomes nonfunctional, full overactivity of pontine excitatory system occurs & rigidity develops.

Pneumotaxic center: Primary effect is to control \"switch off\" point of inspiratory ramp, thus controlling duration of filling phase of lung cycle. - Main function is to limit inspiration which has secondary effect of increasing rate of breathing because limitation of inspiration also shoens expiration & entire period of each respiration Chemoreceptors: - Sensors that detect changes in Co2, O2, pH. - Based on anatomical position divided into Central chemoreceptors Peripheral chemoreceptors",
