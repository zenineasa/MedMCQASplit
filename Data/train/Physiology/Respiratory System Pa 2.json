Alveolar and aerial PO2 depend on alveolar ventilation, alveolar PCO2, and the respiratory quotient; the relationship is given by alveolar air equation. Alveolar O2 is determined by a balance between the rate of O2 removal and the rate of O2 replenishment by ventilation. Metabolic demands of the tissues will determine the rate of O2 removal.
