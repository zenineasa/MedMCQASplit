Tissues that do not depend on insulin for glucose uptake include brain, erythrocytes (RBC), the epithelial cells of kidney & intestine. Liver, and Cornea & lens of eye.o The mechanism through which insulin increases glucose uptake is different in different tissues. In the muscle and adipose tissues, insulin increase facilitated diffusion by increasing glucose transporter (GLUT4) on the cell membrane.o In the liver, insulin stimulates glucose entry into hepatocytes indirectly by induction of glucokinase so that the glucose entering the liver cells is promptly converted to glucose - 6 - phosphate (glucose trapping). This keeps the intracellular glucose concentration low and favours entry of glucose into the liver. Thus, though the liver do not depend on insulin for glucose uptake, insulin stimulates glucose entry into hepatocytes. That means glucose entery can occur in liver without the action of insulin, but this is facilitated by insulin. On the other hand, myocytes (skeletal and cardiac muslces) and adipocytes (adipose tissue) are dependent on insulin for glucose uptake.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Lipolysiso In hyperthyroidism all effects of thyroid hormone are aggravatedCalorigenie effect Thyroid hormones enhance oxygen consumption, and hence the basal metabolic rate (BMR). This may be at least partly due to increase in the activity of membrane Na+/K+ ATPase. Thyroid hormones also increase the number and activity of mitochondria, which may be the cause or the effect of increase in oxygen consumption. By increasing the BMR, thyroid hormones raise body temperature, loss of body weight and increase urinary nitrogen loss.Growth and developmentThyroid hormones are essential for normal growth and development.iii) Carbohydrate metabolism Thyroid hormones have both hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic effects. The hypoglycemic effect is the increased glycolysis. The hyperglycemic effects are stimulation of glycogen olysis and glucoconeogenesis. The net effect is hyperglycemia and depletion of glycogen.Fat metabolism Thyroid hormone stimulates both lipogenesis and lipolysis. The lipolysis exceeds lipogenesis. Thus thyroid hormones moblize fat from adipose tissue, leading to an increase in plasma concentration of FFAs.Protein metabolism : - Thyroid hormone has a protein anabolic effect but in large doses, it has a protein catabolic effect. Thus thyroid hormone increases both protein synthesis and protein degradation.Cardiovascular effects The thyroid hormones increase the heart rate, cardiac contractility, stroke volume and cardiac output, and consequently also the systolic BP. But the diastolic BP may fall due to vasodilatation in several vascular beds with decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. The cardiovascular effects of thyroid hormones are partly mediated by potentiation of effects of catecholamines.GIT Thyroid hormones increase GI secretion, absorption and motility.Nervous system Thyroid hormones are essential for normal formation of synapses and mvelination in the developing brain.Respiratory system Thyroid hormones increase the rate and depth of respiration.About option a & do In low concentration thyroid hormone increases protein synthesis, but in high concentration (as in hyperthyroidism) it is catabolic.o Hyperthyroidism causes decrease in cholesterol due thyroxine induced increased LDL receptor synthesis in liver, and consequent increase in the removal of LDL from circulation.",

Collecting ductAnti diuretic hormone (ADH)o ADH (vasopressin) is a nonapeptide secreted by posterior pitutary (neurohypophysis) along with oxytocin,o It is synthesized in hypothalamus (Supraoptic and paraventricular area) nerve cell bodies as large precursor peptide along with its binding protein neurophysin and is transported down the axons to nerve endings in the median eminence and pars nervosa.o The two main physiological stimuli for ADH release are rise in plasma osmolarity and contraction of ECF volume.o Other factors which can influence ADH secretion are:Inhibit ADH secretion: Cold environemnt. ethyl alcoholStimulate ADH secretion: Pain, exercise, stress, sleep and drugs like morphine ADH (Vasopressin) receptorsV1 receptorsV2 receptorsV1aV1b (also called V3)o Kidney - | water permeabilityo Blood vessels - vasodilatationo Release of vWF & Factor VIII from endotheliumo Blood vessels - vasoconstrictiono Visceral smooth muscle -contractiono Liver - glycogeno lysiso Platelet - aggregationAnterior pituitary- release of ACTHo V2 receptors are more sensitive to ADH than V1 receptors.o Mechanism of action in kidney - Activation of V, receptors increase cAMP formation intracellularly - activation of cAMP dependent protein kinase A - Exocytosis of aquaporin -2 water channel to apical membrane - | water permeability.

They are synthesized mainly in the liver. The growth promoting action of somatomedins is helped by their insulin like actions. GH, through somatomedin (IGF-1), stimulates proliferation of chondrocytes and osteocytes resulting in increased deposition of chondroitin sulfate in catilage and increased ossification of the newly formed cartilage.GH deficiency in early life causes dwarfism (small height). GH excess in early life leads to gigantism, whereas growth hormone excess in adulthood results in acromegaly.2) Regulation of metabolismProtein metabolism : - GH has predominantly anabolic effects on skeletal and cardiac muscle where it promotes amino acid transport into cells and increase protein synthesis.Carbohydrate and fat metabolism : - The effects of GH on carbohydrate and fat metabolism are complicated by the fact that GH has anti-insulin effects, whereas somatomedins it produces have insulin like effects'-Anti-insulin effects due to direct effect of GH include decreased peripheral utilization of glucose, increased gluconeogenesis, hyperglycemia, and lipoiysis. Due to its anti-insulin effects GH excess can cause insulin resistant diabetes mellitus.Insulin like effects due to somatomedins (IGF) include antilipolytic activity, and other insulin like effects.Normally, the predominant action is due to direct anti-insulin effects of GH.Growth hormone also promotes the renal reabsorption of Ca+2, Na+, K+ and Cl-.",

The level of insulin in circulation is low and the level of glucagon is very high.The main means of energy production is lipolysis. Cluconeogenesis converts glycerol into glucose and the Cori cycle converts lactate into usable glucose.Two systems of energy enter the gluconeogenesis: proteolysis provides alanine and lactate produced from pyruvate, while acetyl CoA produces dissolved nutrients (Ketone bodies), which can be detected in urine and are used by the brain as a source of energy.In terms of insulin resistance, starvation conditions make more glucose available to the brain.",

Lungso This question is a repeat from AI -06.o Following organs are involved in calcium metabolism through vitamin D:-i) Skin- Synthesis of 7-dehydrocholesterol which is converted to cholecalceferol (vitamin D,) by sunlight.ii) Liver- Converts cholecalceferol to calcifediol by enzyme 25-hydroxylase.iii) Kidney- Converts calcifediol to calcitriol, active form of vitamin D.Vitamin Do Vitamin D is the major vitamin involved in the absorption of calcium.o Beside dietary' intake, cutaneous synthesis is the other and more important source of vitamin D (cholecalciferol) in the body. The keratinocytes of stratum corneum of the epidermis of skinr contain 7-dehydrocholesterol which is converted to Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) by the action of sunlight (UV light),o This vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) is converted to calcidiol (calcifediol or 25 hydroxy cholecalciferol or 25- hydroxy vitamin D3) by 25 hydroxylase in the liverr.o Calcidiol is the major circulating form of vitamin D3.o Calcidiol is then converted to Calcitriol (1-25 dihydroxy-cholecalciferol or 1-25 dihydroxy vitamin D3)by 1-a hydroxylation in kidneyro The final hydroxylation in kidney is rate limiting stepr.o Calcitriol is the active form of vitamin Dr.o Dietary- vitamin D is absorbed in ileum r and requires bile salts.o When Ca+2 level is high, little calcitriol is produced, and the kidney produce the relatively inactive metabolite 24,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol insteadr.",
