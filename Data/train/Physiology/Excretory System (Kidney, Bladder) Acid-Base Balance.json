        "exp": "Proximal and distal convoluted tubule The site of action of acetazolamide is the proximal convoluted tubule and the site of action of the thiazides is the distal convoluted tubule. The distal nephron has a negative luminal potential because it is poorly permeable to negatively charged ions. Therefore, when Na+ is reabsorbed, negatively charged ions, primarily Cl-, lag behind, producing a negative intraluminal potential. Although a similar situation occurs in the proximal tubule, the proximal tubule has a higher permeability to Cl- and, therefore, does not develop as large a negative intraluminal potential. The distal nephron is less permeable to hydrogen than the proximal tubule. Aldosterone increases Na+ reabsorption from the distal nephron but has no effect on the proximal tubule. K+ is reabsorbed from the proximal tubule and secreted by the distal nephron. Although the amount of H+ excreted each day is determined by the amount of H+ secreted into the distal nephron, Proximal tubule secretes much more H+ than the distal nephron. However, almost all of the H+ secreted in the proximal tubule is reabsorbed in association with the reabsorption of HCO3-",

Therefore, when GFR decreases, the plasma concentration of creatinine increases until the renal excretion of creatinine returns to normal.

It is a consequence of countercurrent multiplier system ADH is not the driving force for countercurrent mechanism. Medullary hyperosmolarity can be said to be the driving force for ADH action. Because water can only move passively (driven by an osmotic gradient). Urea does not drive water reabsorption as it is an ineffective osmole.

It causes Na+ and water retention. * Furosemide or loop diuretics inhibit NKCC transpoer (Na+/K+/2 Cl- cotranspoer) in thick ascending limb. This increases Na+ delivered to collecting ducts. Na+ reabsorption at this site will cause K+ secretion; K+ is lost in the urine.

The mechanism is based on 3 components: (i) A sensor: Cells in the macula densa. (ii) A signal: Na. Cl delivery to the distal tubule. (iii) An effector: Vascular smooth muscle cells within the wall of the afferent aeriole. When filtration increases, the increased Na. Cl delivery to the macula densa triggers vasoconstriction of the afferent aeriole. This results in a decrease in RBF and hence a decrease in GFR, reducing the Na. Cl delivery to the macula densa/distal tubules. The vasoconstriction is thought to be mediated by adenosine. If GFR and Na. Cl delivery to distal tubule are decreased, a decrease in ATP and adenosine formation occurs. There is the release of NO that produces vasodilatation, causing increased RBF and GFR. As more Na. Cl enters through the NKCC-2 transpoer located in the apical membrane (TAL), it stimulates the release of ATP through ATP-conducting ion channels located in the basolateral membrane of macula densa cells. This results in the opening of Ca2+ channels and an increase in intracellular, resulting in vasoconstriction and fall in GFR.
