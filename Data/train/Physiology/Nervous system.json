The coicospinal tract conducts impulses from the brain to the spinal cord. It is made up of a lateral and anterior tract. The coicospinal tract is involved in voluntary movement.

The coicospinal tract also contains Betz cells (the largest pyramidal cells), which are not found in any other region of the body. The nerves within the coicospinal tract are involved in movement of muscles of the body.

        "exp": "The baroreflex or baroreceptor reflex is one of the body's homeostatic mechanisms that help to maintain blood pressure at nearly constant levels. The baroreflex provides a rapid negative feedback loop in which an elevated blood pressure reflexively causes the heart rate to decrease and also causes blood pressure to decrease. Decreased blood pressure decreases baroreflex activation and causes heart rate to increase and to restore blood pressure levels. The baroreflex can begin to act in less than the duration of a cardiac cycle (fractions of a second) and thus baroreflex adjustments are key factors in dealing with postural hypotension, the tendency for blood pressure to decrease on standing due to gravity. The baroreceptors are stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors. At low pressures, baroreceptors become inactive. When blood pressure rises, the carotid and aoic sinuses are distended fuher, resulting in increased stretch and, therefore, a greater degree of activation of the baroreceptors. At normal resting blood pressures, many baroreceptors are actively repoing blood pressure information and the baroreflex is actively modulating autonomic activity. Active baroreceptors fire action potentials (\"spikes\") more frequently. The greater the stretch the more rapidly baroreceptors fire action potentials. Many individual baroreceptors are inactive at normal resting pressures and only become activated when their stretch or pressure threshold is exceeded.

        "exp": "A cross-section of a typical small nerve has many large nerve fibers that constitute most of the cross-sectional area. However, a more careful look revealsmany more small fibers lying between the large ones. The large fibers are myelinated, and the small ones are unmyelinated. The average nerve trunk contains about twice asmany unmyelinated fibers as myelinated fibers. The central core of the fiber is the axon, and the membrane of the axon is the membrane that actually conducts the action potential. The axon is filled in its center with axoplasm, which is a viscid intracellular fluid. Surrounding the axon is a myelin sheath that is often much thicker than the axon itself. About once every 1 to 3 millimeters along the length of the myelin sheath is a node of Ranvier. The myelin sheath is deposited around the axon by Schwann cells in the following manner: The membrane of a Schwann cell first envelops the axon. The Schwann cellthen rotates around the axon many times, laying down multiple layers of Schwann cell membrane containing the lipid substance sphingomyelin. This substance is an excellent electrical insulator that decreases ion flow through the membrane about 5000-fold. At the juncture between each two successive Schwann cells along the axon, a small uninsulated area only 2 to 3 micrometers in length remains where ions still can flow with ease through the axon membrane between the extracellular fluid and the intracellular fluid inside the axon. This area is called the node of Ranvier. Ref: Guyton and Hall textbook medical physiology, 13th edition.",

The flexion can be explained by Rubio spinal excitation of flexor muscles in the upper extremities; the hyperextension of lower extremities is due to the same changes that occur after mid-collicular decerebration. Decoicate rigidity is seen on the hemiplegic side in humans after hemorrhages or thromboses in the internal capsule. Probably because of their anatomy, the small aeries in the internal capsule are especially prone to rupture or thrombotic obstruction, so this type of decoicate rigidity is fairly common. Sixty percent of intracerebral hemorrhages occur in the internal capsule, as opposed to 10% in the cerebral coex, 10% in the pons, 10% in the thalamus, and 10% in the cerebellum.

Heart - (due to pactions)i) | heart rate, (Positive chronotropic)ii) | force of cardiac contraction (Positive ionotropic)iii) Conduction velocity in the conductive tissues of heart is increased (Positive dromotropic)iv) Increased automaticity (positive bathmotropic)v) Refractory Period (RP) of all type of cardiac cells is reduced. This makes sense, because with a fight or flight response, heart rate increases, as a consequence of:# | Conduction velocity (Positive dromotropic)# | Refractory period (so that cardiac tissue becomes excitable in a shorter span on time)2. Blood vessels* Stimulation of cq receptors cause vasoconstriction. Stimulation of b2 receptors cause vasodilation. Vasoconstriction (a1 receptors) predominate in skin, mucosal, renal and sphlanchnic blood vessels. Dilatation (b2 receptors) predominate in skeletal muscles, liver and coronary blood vessels. The direct effect on cerebral vessels is not prominent - blood flow through this bed parallels change in BP. Renal vessels contain bothaI (vasoconstriction) and (vasodilatiator) receptor. Therefore sympathetic stimulation cause less increase in vascular resistance as compared to other sites where sympathetic stimulation causes vasconstriction. 3. Urinary system* Relaxation of detrusor (b2 action) and contraction of trigone (a1 action) - urinary retention. 4. GIT* Relaxation of smooth muscles by direct action of b2 receptors and indirect action of a2 receptors (a2 receptors decrease the release of ACH by acting presynaptically on cholinergic neurons). 5. Respiratory system* Bronchial smooth muscles have b2 receptors but no sympathetic supply. b2 receptor agonists (exogenous drugs) can cause bronchodilation. There is vasoconstriction of mucosal blood vessels of respiratory tract - further increase in diameter of bronchus. Overall there is decrease in resistance. 6. Eye* Mydriasis - Due to contraction of radial muscles (Dilator pupillae) of iris by a7 receptors. 7. Genital system* Relaxation of uterus - b2 receptors* Ejaculation - a1 receptors. 8.

A person falling asleep first enters Stage 1, which is characterized by low-amplitude, high-frequency EEG activity. Stage 2 is marked by the appearance of sleep spindles. These are bursts of alpha-like, 10-14 Hz, 50 uV waves. In stage 3, the pattern is one of lower frequency and increased amplitude of the EEG waves. Maximum slowing with large waves is seen in Stage 4. Thus, the characteristic of deep sleep is a pattern of rhythmic slow waves, indicating marked synchronization.",

Intrafusal fibers do not contribute to the overall contractile force of the muscle, but rather serve a pure sensory function. There are two types of intrafusal fibers in mammalian muscle spindles. The first type contains many nuclei in a dilated central area and is called a nuclear bag fiber (Figure 9-2B). There are two subtypes of nuclear bag fibers, dynamic and static. Typically, there are two or three nuclear bag fibers per spindle. The second intrafusal fiber type, the nuclear chain fiber, is thinner and shoer and lacks a definite bag. Each spindle has about five of these fibers. There are two kinds of sensory endings in each spindle, a single primary (group Ia) ending and up to eight secondary (group II) endings. The Ia afferent fiber wraps around the center of the dynamic and static nuclear bag fibers and nuclear chain fibers. Group II sensory fibers are located adjacent to the centers of the static nuclear bag and nuclear chain fibers; these fibers do not innervate the dynamic nuclear bag fibers. Ia afferents are very sensitive to the velocity of the change in muscle length during a stretch (dynamic response); thus they provide information about the speed of movements and allow for quick corrective movements. The steady-state (tonic) activity of group Ia and II afferents provide information on steady-state length of the muscle (static response). The top trace in Figure 9-2C shows the dynamic and static components of activity in an Ia afferent during muscle stretch. Note that they discharge most rapidly while the muscle is being stretched (shaded). Ref: Ganong&; s review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 158",

It then travels down the axon through the infundibulum within neurosecretory granules that are found within Herring bodies, localized swellings of the axons and nerve terminals. These carry the peptide directly to the posterior pituitary gland, where it is stored until released into the blood. However, there are two other sources of AVP with impoant local effects: AVP is also synthesized by magnocellular neurosecretory neurons at the PVN, transpoed and released at the median eminence, which then travels through the hypophyseal poal system to the anterior pituitary where it stimulates coicotropic cells synergistically with CRH to produce ACTH (by itself it is a weak secretagogue).

This principle is called law of projection, e. g., phantom limb & cortical stimulation during neurosurgical procedure on conscious patient. WEBER FESCHNER LAW- Magnitude of sensation felt is proportionate to the log of intensity of the stimulus. BELL-MAGENDIE LAW- The basic unit of integrated reflex activity is the reflex arc. This arc consists of a sense organ, an afferent neuron, one or more synapses, which are generally in a central integrating station, an efferent neuron, and an effector.- The afferent neurons enter via the dorsal roots or cranial nerves and have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia or in the homologous ganglia on the cranial nerves.- Efferent fibers leave via the ventral roots or corresponding motor cranial nerves.- The principle that in the spinal cord the dorsal roots are sensory and the ventral roots are motor is known as the Bell-Magendie law.",

        "question": "In a healthy alert adult sitting with eyes closed, which of the following EEG rhythms will be seen when electrode is placed in occipital region?",
        "exp": "Ans. c. (Alpha waves ) (Ref. Guyton physiology 11th ed., 742)NORMAL SLEEPStage of sleep. Characteristic features1. Stage 1 (5%)EEG: The appearance of theta waves (slow 3 to 7 cycles per second). Disappearance of alpha waves - drowsy (rapid 8 to 12 cycles per second)2. Stage 2 (45%). Longest stage. EEG: K complexes & sleep spindles (very rapid 12 to 14 cycles per second)3. Stage 3 (12. 5%)EEG: appearance of delta waves (slowest < 2 cycles per second). Hardest to arouse. Tends to vanish in the elderly. Stage 3 with stage 4 are called slow wave sleep or delta sleep4. Stage 4 (12. 5%)EEG: continuation of delta wave5. REM sleep (25%)EEG: Saw-tooth waves. REM like SEX: Pulse & Penile/Clitoral arousal, but |with age. Lengthens in time as the night progresses. Increased during the second half of the night. Four simple periodic rhythms recorded in the EEG are alpha, beta, delta, and theta. The four basic rhythms have been associated with various states. Rhythm. Freq (Hz). Amp (mV)alpha8-1320-200beta13-305-10delta1-520-200theta4-810. Alpha: In general, the alpha rhythm is the prominent EEG wave pattern of an adult who is awake but relaxed with eyes closed. Each region of the brain had a characteristic alpha rhythm but alpha waves of the greatest amplitude are recorded from the occipital and parietal regions of the cerebral cortex. In general, amplitudes of alpha waves diminish when subjects open their eyes and are attentive to external stimuli although some subjects trained in relaxation techniques can maintain high alpha amplitudes even with their eyes open. Beta: Beta rhythms occur in individuals who are alert and attentive to external stimuli or exert specific mental effort, or paradoxically, beta rhythms also occur during deep sleep, REM sleep when the eyes switch back and forth. This does not mean that there is less electrical activity, rather that the \"positive\" and \"negative\" activities are starting to counterbalance so that the sum of the electrical activity is less. Thus, instead of getting the wave-like synchronized pattern of alpha waves, desynchronization or alpha block occurs. So, the beta wave represents arousal of the cortex to a higher state of alertness or tension. It may also be associated with \"remembering\" or retrieving memories. Delta and Theta: Delta and theta rhythms are low-frequency EEG patterns that increase during sleep in the normal adult. As people move from lighter to deeper stages of sleep (prior to REM sleep), the occurrence of alpha waves diminish and is gradually replaced by the lower frequency theta and then delta frequency rhythms.

        "exp": "Ans. A. Pacinian corpuscles. (Ref. Guyton Physiology 11th/pg. 587; Ganong 23rd/pg. 121-127, 746). Guyton Physiology 11th/pg. 587......... \"Detection of Vibration: All tactile receptors are involved in detection of vibration, although different receptors detect different frequencies of vibration. Pacinian corpuscles can detect signal vibrations from 30 to 800 cycles per second because they respond extremely rapidly to minute and rapid deformations of the tissues, and they also transmit their signals over type Ab nerve fibers, which can transmit as many as 1000 impulses per second. Low-frequency vibrations from 2 up to 80 cycles per second, in contrast, stimulate other tactile receptors, especially Meissner's corpuscles, which are less rapidly adapting than pacinian corpuscles\". The Ruffini ending is a tonic receptor that produces a train of action potentials proportional to the intensity of pressure applied to the skin. Free nerve endings:# found everywhere in the skin and in many other tissues# Can detect touch and pressure.# For instance, even light contact with the cornea of the eye, which contains no other type of nerve ending besides free nerve endings, can nevertheless elicit touch and pressure sensations. Meissner fs corpuscle:# It is a touch receptor with great sensitivity is the Meissner's corpuscle# It is an elongated encapsulated nerve ending of a large (type Ab) myelinated sensory nerve fiber.# Present in the nonhairy parts of the skin and are particularly abundant in the finger- tips, lips, and other areas of the skin where one's ability to discern spatial locations of touch sensations is highly developed.# Meissner's corpuscles adapt in a fraction of a second after they are stimulated, which means that they are particularly sensitive to movement of objects over the surface of the skin as well as to low- frequency vibration. Merkel's discs:# Merkel's discs are often grouped together in a receptor organ called the Iggo dome receptor, which projects upward against the underside of the epithelium of the skin. This causes the epithelium at this point to protrude outward, thus creating a dome and constituting an extremely sensitive receptor.# Also note that the entire group of Merkel's discs is innervated by a single large myelinated nerve fiber (type Ab).# These receptors, along with the Meissner's corpuscles, play extremely important roles in localizing touch sensations to specific surface areas of the body and in determining the texture of what is felt. Hair end-organ:# Slight movement of any hair on the body stimulates a nerve fiber entwining its base. Thus, each hair and its basal nerve fiber, called the hair end-organ, are also a touch receptor.# This receptor adapts readily and, like Meissner's corpuscles, detects mainly- (a) movement of objects on the surface of the body or- (b) initial contact with the body. Ruffini's end-organs:# Located in the deeper layers of the skin and also in still deeper internal tissues are many Ruffini's end-organs, which are multibranched, encapsulated endings.# These endings adapt very slowly and, therefore, are important for signaling continuous states of deformation of the tissues, such as heavy prolonged touch and pressure signals.# They are also found in joint capsules and help to signal the degree of joint rotation. Pacinian corpuscles:# lie both immediately beneath the skin and deep in the fascial tissues of the body.# They are stimulated only by rapid local compression of the tissues because they adapt in a few hundredths of a second.# Therefore, they are particularly important for detecting tissue vibration or other rapid changes in the mechanical state of the tissues.",

EEG with eyes open & mind wandering shows Beta waves. EEG waves. Key Facts. Alpha# Happen between 8 and 13 times per second, or 8-13 Hertz (Hz).# Alpha represents a sort of \"idle\" state, or \"ready but not doing much\" state and is normally fairly large over the back third of the brain when the eyes are closed and when you are awake.# Alpha disappears when we either get mentally busy (e. g., open the eyes, start doing intense mental work even eyes closed) or when we become drowsy.# Thus the presence of alpha can show the presence of an awake, resting state, # If it is present at a fairly high voltage when the eyes are open, this would usually indicate an inattentive, daydreamy state.# In fact we often see this sign in adolescents and adults with attentional difficulties. Beta waves# The beta family of waves happen at frequencies from 16-40 Hz or higher.# When we get mentally busy and engaged, we should see alpha \"block, \" or reduce significantly in size.# In its place we see mostly smaller, quicker \"beta\" waves. Delta and theta waves# Are relatively slow.# Delta is usually defined as waves occurring from 1-4 times per second (1-4 Hz).# Theta occurs at 4-7 Hz.# During drowsiness, first alpha disappears, then the size of theta waves begins to increase.# As sleep begins, theta waves get quite large, then become mixed with and eventually give way to slower delta waves.# The presence of delta and theta waves in the waking, eyes open EEG is normal, but only if the waves are fairly small.# High-amplitude slow waves can be signs of various neurological and psychological problems, ranging from epilepsy to ADHD. Educational points:# In a typical night of sleep, a young adult first enters NREM sleep, passes through stages 1 and 2, and spends 70-100 minutes in stages 3 and 4.# Sleep then lightens, and an REM period follows. This cycle is repeated at intervals of about 90 minutes throughout the night. The cycles are similar, though there is less stage 3 and 4 sleep and more REM sleep towards morning.# Thus, four to six REM periods occur per night. REM sleep occupies 80% of total sleep time in premature infants and 50% in full-term neonates.# Thereafter, proportion of REM sleep falls rapidly and plateaus at about 25% until it falls further in old age.# In REM, there occurs | and variable pulse, | and variable blood pressure, penile/clitoral tumescence. ACh is the principal neurotransmitter involved in REM sleep.# Children have more total sleep time and stage 4 sleep than adults.# Serotonergic predominance of raphe nucleus key to initiating sleep.# NE reduces REM sleep.# Extraocular movements during REM due to activity of PPRF (paramedian pontine reticular formation/conjugate gaze center).# Benzodiazepines shorten stage 4 sleep; thus useful for night terrors and sleepwalking# Imipramine is used to treat enuresis because it | stage 4 sleep.# Characteristic feature of NREM stage IV sleep is DELTA waves.

        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Vision. REF: Guyton 12th Ed. Pg 624. PRIMARY VISUAL CORTEX is also called visual area I or striate cortex because of the highly striated appearance. The primary visual (VI) cortex is mostly located on the medial aspect of the occipital lobe, and is coextensive with the subcortical nerve fibre stria of Gennari in layer IV, hence its alternative name, the striate cortex. It occupies the upper and lower lips and depths of the posterior part of the calcarine sulcus and extends into the cuneus and lingual gyrus. Posteriorly it is limited by the lunate sulcus, and by polar sulci above and below this sulcus. It extends to the occipital pole. The primary visual cortex receives afferent fibres from the lateral geniculate nucleus via the optic radiation. The latter curves posteriorly and spreads through the white matter of the occipital lobe. Its fibres terminate in strict point-to-point fashion in the striate area. The primary visual cortex is divided into six functionally distinct layers, labeled 1 through 6. Layer 4, which receives most visual input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), is further divided into 4 layers, labelled 4A, 4B, 4. Ca, and 4. Cb. Sublamina 4. Ca receives most magnocellular input from the LGN; while layer 4. Cb receives input from parvocellular pathways. The striate cortex is granular. Layer IV, bearing the stria of Gennari, is commonly divided into three sublayers. Passing from superficial to deep, these are IVA, 1. VB (which contains the stria), and JVC. The densely cellular I VC is further subdivided into a superficial I VCa and a deep IVCb. Layer IVB contains only sparse, mainly non-pyramidal, neurones. The input to area 17 from the lateral geniculate nucleus terminates predominantly in layers IVA and IVC.",

They, then, deacetylate a variety' of proteins causing induction of catabolic processes and inhibition of anabolic processes. o SIRT-1 and SIRT-3 coordinated increase cellular energy' stores and ultimately maintain cellular energy homeostasis, o Genetic variant in SIRT-1 gene is associated lower risk of cardiovascular mortality and with better cognitive functioning. o SIRT-l variants are associated with decreased basal energy expenditure and a lower lipid peroxidation rate. Therefore, it has been proposed that genetic variation in SIRT-l may determine the response rates of individuales undergoing caloric restriction and increased physical activity, o Genetic variants of SIRT-3 may be associated with increased longevity (increased lifespan), but there is no evidence of such an association. o Mammals have seven sirtuins: 1) SIRT-1- Intranuclear2) SIRT-2- Cytoplasmic3) SIRT-3, SIRT-4, SIRT-5- Mitochondrial4) SIRT-6- Heterochromatin-associated nuclear5) SJRT-7- Nucleolaro SIRT-1 and SIRT-3 have been studied the most in relation to phenotypes in human.",

These nerves are called A-delta fibers.

They remain closed until repolarization occurs. No action potential can occur, until the inactivation gates open. Relative refractory period: Begins from the remaining part of repolarization to the end of action potential. Stronger than normal stimulus(suprathreshold stimulus) produces action potential in relative refractory period.

Conduction System of Hearto The depolarization of the various parts of the heart proceeds in an orderly and timely way. This is made possible by the presence of the conductive system of the heart which comprises the sinoatral node (SA node), intermodal atrial pathways, atrioventricular node (AV node), bundle of his and its branches, and Purkinje system. The conduction system is made up of modified cardiac muscles. o Most of cells of the conducting system are specialized for fast conduction though some, like the cells of the AV node, are specialized for slowing down conduction. o The fastest conduction is seen in purkinje system and slowest in AV node and SA node. Cardiac tissue. Conduction velocity (meter/second)SA node0. 05. Inteatrial pathways1. Atrial muscle0. 30. AV nixie0. 05 (minimum). Bundle of His1. Purkinje system4 (maximum). Ventricular muscle1o Cells of the conductive system also possess automaticity, i. e., the capability of spontaneous excitation. o However, the rate at which different parts of conductive system discharge impulses is not the same. o The SA node discharges impulses at fastest rate, hence the rate at which SA node fires determines the heart rate, therefore, SA node is normal pacemaker of the heart, i. e., it determines the pace of the heart. o The AV node has the next highest automaticity after SA node; therefore, if the SA node stops discharging, the AV node takes over the role of cardiac pacemaker. Conduction of cardiac impulseo The cardiac impulse originates in the SA node. o From SA node it is transmitted to AV node via interatrial pathways (intemodal atrial pathways). o From AV node it is rapidly transmitted to bundle of his and then purkinje system to all parts of ventricles. o In the ventricles, endocardial surface depolarizes before epicardial surface. o Order of spread of impulse (depolarization) in ventricular myocardium is as follow: Depolarization starts at the left side of interventricular septum and then moves to the right across the mid portion of septum. o The wave then spreads down the septum to the apex of heart. o It returns along the ventricular walls to the AV groove, proceeding from the endocardial to epicardial surface. o The last parts of the heart to be depolarized are the posterobasal portion of the left ventricles, the pulmonary conus, and the upper most portion of the septum. o The sequence of repolarization is not exactly the same as that of depolarization. o Although the septum and endocardial surface of ventricles depolarizes first, it is the epicardial surface which repolarizes first, i. e., repolarization spreads from epicardium to endocarium.",

The basic unit of integrated reflex activity is the reflex arc. This arc consists of a sense organ, an afferent neuron, one or more synapses that are generally in a central integrating station, an efferent neuron, and an effector. In mammals, the connection between afferent and efferent somatic neurons is generally in the brain or spinal cord. The afferent neurons enter via the dorsal roots or cranial nerves and have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia or in the homologous ganglia on the cranial nerves.

It acts as a barrier between the extracellular and intracellular compaments, defining the individual muscle fiber from its surroundings. The lipid nature of the membrane allows it to separate the fluids of the intra- and extracellular compaments since it is only selectively permeable to water through aquaporin channels. As in other cells, this allows for the compositions of the compaments to be controlled by selective transpo through the membrane. Membrane proteins, such as ion pumps, may create ion gradients with the consumption of ATP, that may later be used to drive transpo of other substances through the membrane (Co-transpo) or generate electrical impulses such as Action potentials. Perlecan is a key component of the vascular extracellular matrix, here it interacts with a variety of other matrix components and helps to maintain the endothelial barrier function. Perlecan is a potent inhibitor of smooth muscle cell proliferation and is thus thought to help maintain vascular homeostasis. Perlecan can also promote growth factor (e. g., FGF2) activity and thus stimulate endothelial growth and regeneration.

        "exp": "(C) Difficulty in identifying known faces[?]. Who gets Prosopagnosia: 2% of the world population has Prosopagnosia. Children with Autism and Asperger Syndrome are more likely. Those who have suffered severe head trauma, stroke, or other degenerative diseases. Caused by damage to Temporal or Occipital lobes. Prosopagnosia: Prosopagnosia is extremely rare. Prosopagnosia of vascular origin is due to posterior cerebral artery infarcts (PCAIs). PCIAs represent 5-10% of all strokes. The infarct must affect the right side to produce prosopagnosia. Other etiologies include carbon monoxide poisoning, temporal lobectomy, encephalitis, and Alzeimer's disease. An important part of usual input goes to the inferior temporal lobe where representations of feces are stared faces are imp in distinguishing friend and foes and emotional state. An important part of visual input goes to the inferior temporal lobe, where representations of faces, are stored. Faces are important in distinguishing friends and foes and emotional state. Recognition of faces stored in right inferior temporal lobe in right handed persons. In humans, storage and recognition of faces is more strongly represented in the right inferior temporal lobe in right-handed individuals, though the left lobe is also active. Damage to this area can cause prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize faces. Patients with this abnormality can recognize forms and reproduce them. They can recognize people by their voices, and many of them show autonomic responses when they see familiar as opposed to unfamiliar faces. However, they cannot identify the familiar faces they see. NEUROLOGY - GLOSSARYAgnosia: A failure or deficit in recognizing objects. Prosopagnosia: A disruption in face recognition can identify people by voices & show autonomic responses when familiar faces are seen. Appreceptive Agnosia: A form of agnosia in which individual features cannot be integrated into a whole percept or pattern; a basic disruption in perceiving patterns. Associative Agnosia: A form of agnosia in which the individual can combine perceived features into a whole pattern but cannot associate the pattern with meaning or identify it. The presence of autonamic response to a familiar face in the absence of recognition is explained by postulating the existence of a separate dorsal pathway for processing information at a subconscious level.",

CUTANEOUS MECHANORECEPTORS: -Sensory receptors can be specialized dendritic endings of afferent nerve fibers, and they are often associated with non- neural cells that surround them forming a sense organ. Touch and pressure are sensed by four types of mechanoreceptors. a. Meissner corpuscles are dendrites encapsulated in connective tissue and respond to changes in texture and slow vibrations. b. Merkel cells are expanded dendritic endings, and they respond to sustained pressure and touch. c. Ruffini corpuscles are enlarged dendritic endings with elongated capsules, and they respond to sustained pressure. d. Pacinian corpuscles consist of unmyelinated dendritic endings of a sensory nerve fiber, 2 um in diameter, encapsulated by concentric lamellae of connective tissue that give the organ the appearance of a cocktail onion. These receptors respond to deep pressure and fast vibration. e. The sensory nerves from these mechanoreceptors are large myelinated Aa and Ab fibers whose conduction velocities range from ~ 70-120 to ~ 40-75 m/s, respectively. a. Sensory systems encode four elementary attributes of stimuli: modality, location (receptive field), intensity, and duration (timing). b. The human hand has four types of mechanoreceptors; their combined activation produces the sensation of contact with an object. Selective activation of Merkel cells and Ruffini endings causes sensation of steady pressure; selective activation of Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles causes tingling and vibratory sensation. c. Location of a stimulus is encoded by spatial distribution of the population of receptors activated. A receptor fires only when the skin close to its sensory terminals is touched. These receptive fields of mechanoreceptors (shown as red areas on fingertips) differ in size and response to touch. Merkel cells and Meissner corpuscles provide the most precise localization as they have the smallest receptive fields and are most sensitive to pressure applied by a small probe. d. Stimulus intensity is signaled by firing rates of individual receptors; duration of stimulus is signaled by time course of firing. The spike trains indicate action potentials elicited by pressure from a small probe at the center of each receptive field. Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles adapt rapidly; the others adapt slowly.",

Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is the difference between mean arterial pressure and intracranial pressure or central venous pressure which ever is higher. It is 50 mi/100 gm of brain tissue. Since ions are not able to cross the blood brain barrier as easily as O2, O2 and lipid soluble substances (such as most anaesthetics) the ions have little effects on cerebral blood flow. Factors affecting cerebral blood flow (CBF)A. Cerebral metabolism - cerebral blood flow varies directly with metabolic activity, various studies have shown that regional CBF parallels metabolic activity for eg motor activity of a limb is associated with an increased in regional CBF of the corresponding motor cortex. Similarily, visual activity is associated with an increase in regional CBF of the corresponding occipital cortex. B. Cerebral Perfusion pressure: is the difference between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) or central venous pressure (CVP) which ever is greater CPP is normally 80-100 mm Hg. Because ICP is normally less than 10 mm Hg. CPP is primarily dependent on MAP. Autoregulation maintains a steady CBF as perfusion pressure varies between 60 and 160 mm Hg. Decrease in CPP results in cerebral vasodilation, where as elevations induce vasoconstriction. C. Arterial PCO2 - The most important extrinsic influences on CBF are respiratory gas tensions particularly arterial PCO2. CBF is directly proportional to arterial PCO2 between tensions of 20 and 80 mm of Hg. The effect is almost immediates and is thought to be secondary to changes in the PH of CSF and cerebral tissueD. Arterial PO2: only marked changes in arterial PO2 alter CBF whereas hypoxia may be associated with only minimal decrease (-10%) in CBF severe hypoxemia (arterial PO2 less than 50 mm Hg) profoundly increases CBFE. Temperature - CBF changes 5 - 7% 1degC change in temperature. Hypothermia decreases both cerebral metabolic rate and CBF. Whereas pyrexia has the reverse effect. F. Blood viscosity - CBF rises as viscosity falls and vise versaG. Autonomic system* Cerebral blood flow is maintained at constant levels (does not change) in response to moderate exercise)**** Mild to moderate decrease in perfusion pressure decreases driving forces for flow, resulting in CO2 accumulation, which by release of H+ produces cerebral vasodilation.* Most important factor for regulating cerebral blood flow under normal conditions is the rate of cerebral CO2formation.",

Alpha waves are rhythmical waves that occur at frequencies between 8 and 13 cycles per second and are found in the EEGs of almost all normal adult people when they are awake and in a quiet, resting state of cerebration. These waves occur most intensely in the occipital region but can also be recorded from the parietal and frontal regions of the scalp. Their voltage usually is about 50 microvolts. During deep sleep, the alpha waves disappear. When the awake person's attention is directed to some specific type of mental activity, the alpha waves are replaced by asynchronous, higher-frequency but lower-voltage beta waves. The effect on the alpha waves of simply opening the eyes in bright light and then closing the eye is that the visual sensations cause immediate cessation of the alpha waves and that these are replaced by low-voltage, asynchronous beta waves. Beta waves occur at frequencies greater than 14 cycles per second and as high as 80 cycles per second. They are recorded mainly from the parietal and frontal regions during specific activation of these parts of the brain. Theta waves have frequencies between 4 and 7 cycles per second. They occur normally in the parietal and temporal regions in children, but they also occur during emotional stress in some adults, particularly during disappointment and frustration. Theta waves also occur in many brain disorders, often in degenerative brain states. Delta waves include all the waves of the EEG with frequencies less than 3. 5 cycles per second, and they often have voltages two to four times greater than most other types of brain waves. They occur in very deep sleep, in infancy, and in serious organic brain disease. They also occur in the cortex of animals that have had subcortical transections separating the cerebral cortex from the thalamus. Therefore, delta waves can occur strictly in the cortex independent of activities in lower regions of the brain.",

Umami is the fifth taste sense triggered by glutamate and particularly by the monosodium glutamate (MSG) used so extensively in Asian cooking. The taste is pleasant and sweet but differs from the standard sweet taste. The action of umami receptors explains why foods treated with MSG often taste fuller. UMAMI# Humans have five established basic tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salt, and umami.# Umami is one of the five basic tastes sensed by specialized receptor cells present on the human tongue.# Umami is a Japanese word meaning \"savory\" or \"meaty\" and thus applies to the sensation of savoriness--specifically, to the detection of glutamates, which are especially common in meats, cheese and other protein-heavy foods.# Afferent nerves to the nucleus tractus solitarius contain fibers from all types of taste buds, without any clear localization of types. TASTE RECEPTORS# The sour taste is triggered by protons.# Umami taste is due to activation of a truncated metabotopic glutamate receptor, m. Glu. R4, in the taste buds, and the agonists are purine 5-ribonucleotides such as IMP and GMP in the food.# Bitter taste is produced by a variety of unrelated compounds, many of which are poisons. It was originally thought that a single bitter receptor was linked to the heterotrimeric G protein gustducin.# A taste modifier protein, miraculin, has been discovered in a plant. When applied to the tongue, this protein makes acids taste sweet.# A protein that binds taste-producing molecules has been cloned. It is produced by Ebner's glands--glands that secrete mucus into the cleft around vallate papillae and probably have a concentrating and transport function similar to that of the OBP in olfaction.# In humans, the taste buds are located in the mucosa of the epiglottis, palate, and pharynx and in the walls of the fungiform and vallate papillae of the tongue.# The fungiform papillae are rounded structures most numerous near the tip of the tongue; the vallate papillae are prominent structures arranged in a V on the back of the tongue. Each fungiform papilla has up to five taste buds, and they are usually located at the top of the papilla.# The larger vallate papillae each contain up to 100 taste buds, usually located along the sides of the papillae. The small conical filiform papillae that cover the dorsum of the tongue do not usually contain taste buds.# There are a total of about 10, 000 taste buds.",

They occur in very deep sleep, in infancy, and in persons with serious organic brain disease. They also occur in the coex of animals that have had subcoical transactions in which the cerebral coex is separated from the thalamus. Therefore, delta waves can occur strictly in the coex independent of activities in lower regions ofthe brain. Delta waves also occur during deep slow-wave sleep, which suggests that the coex then is mainly released from the activating influences of the thalamus and other lower centers. Slow-wave sleep is divided into four stages. In the first stage, a stage of light sleep, the voltage of the EEG waves becomes low. This stage is broken by \"sleep spindles\" (i. e., sho spindle-shaped bursts of alpha waves that occur periodically). In stages 2, 3, and 4 of slow-wave sleep, the frequency of the EEG becomes progressively slower until it reaches a frequency of only one to three waves per second in stage 4; these waves are delta waves.

It should be distinguished from the respiratory exchange ratio (R), which is the ratio of CO2 to O2 at any given time whether or not equilibrium has been reached. R is affected by factors other than metabolism. RQ and R can be calculated for reactions outside the body, for individual organs and tissues, and for the whole body. The RQ of carbohydrate is 1. 00, and that of fat is about 0. 70. This is because H and O are present in carbohydrate in the same propoions as in water, whereas in the various fats, extra O2 is necessary for the formation of H2O. Determining the RQ of protein in the body is a complex process, but an average value of 0. 82 has been calculated.

        "exp": "The electroretinogram (ERG) is a diagnostic test that measures the electrical activity generated by neural and non-neuronal cells in the retina in response to a light stimulus. The electrical response is a result of a retinal potential generated by light-induced changes in the flux of trans retinal ions, primarily sodium and potassium. A-wave: initial corneal-negative deflection, derived from the cones and rods of the outer photoreceptor layers. This wave reflects the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptors due to closure of sodium ion channels in the outer segment membrane. Absorption of light triggers the rhodopsin to activate transducin, a G-protein. This leads to the activation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (c. GMP PDE) eventually leading to a reduction in the level of c. GMP within the photoreceptor. This leads to closure of the sodium ion channels resulting in a decrease of inwardly directed sodium ions, or a hyperpolarization of the cell. The a-wave amplitude is measured from baseline to the trough of the A-wave. Ref. textbook of physiology by A K Jain 7th edition page no. 1110",

They are large, myelinated nerve endings. They provide information on pressure, position, and deep static touch features such as shapes and edges. Merkel cells in the basal epidermis of the skin store neuropeptides which they release to associated nerve endings in response to pressure. In burns, Merkel endings are most commonly lost. Each ending consists of a Merkel cell in close apposition with an enlarged nerve terminal. This is sometimes referred to as a Merkel cell-neurite complex, or a Merkel disk receptor. In mammals, Merkel nerve endings have a wide distribution. Merkel nerve endings are found in the basal layer of glabrous and hairy skin, in hair follicles, and in oral and anal mucosa. In humans, Merkel cells (along with Meissner's corpuscles) occur in the superficial skin layers and are found clustered beneath the ridges of the fingeips that make up fingerprints. In hairy skin, Merkel nerve endings are clustered into specialized epithelial structures called \"touch domes\" or \"hair disks\". (Some other types of mechanoreceptors, such as Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings, are found primarily in subcutaneous tissue.) Merkel receptors are also located in the mammary glands.

Features of Photoreceptor* Each rod and cone cells have a light-sensitive outer segment, which is connected to an inner segment by a thin connecting part.* The inner segment rich in mitochondria and establishes synaptic contact with the neighboring cells.* Synaptic terminal stores the neurotransmitter glutamate for signaling.* The outer segment of the rod cells contains membranous disks, and the plasma membrane of the outer segment of the cones is folded.* Visual pigments are stored in these disks and folds. Photoreceptor mechanism-Photo transduction* In retinal rods and cones, light-absorbing visual pigments and a variety of enzymes and transmitters mediate the conversion of light stimuli into electrical stimuli; this is called photoelectric transduction.* Vitamin A is an important component of visual pigment rhodopsin.* Rhodopsin is composed of integral membrane protein opsin and the aldehyde 11-cis-retinal. The latter is bound to a lysine residue of opsin which is embedded in this protein; it is stably kept in place by weak interactions with two other amino acid residues.* In response of light, there is an isoform conversion of Vitamin-A, which happens in acyclic form which as initially identified by Wald. It is also called as Wald visual cycle for which George Wald rewarded with Noble prize in 1964.* Photic stimuli trigger a primary photochemical reaction in rhodopsin in which 11-cis-retinal is converted to all-trans- retinal.* Even without continued photic stimulation, the reaction yields bathorhodopsin, the intermediates lumirhodopsin and metarhodopsin I, and finally metarhodopsin II.* Metarhodopsin II activates a G protein called transducing (Gt), which in turn activates a phosphodiesterase.* The conversion of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (c. GMP) to 5'-GMP catalyzes by Phosphodiesterase; so, c. GMP levels decrease.* Due to decreased levels of c. GMP leads to closure of Na+ channels - Hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cell membrane (As inward Na+ current decreased).* When the photoreceptor is hyperpolarized, there is decreased release of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter. There are two types of glutamate receptors on bipolar and horizontal cells, which determine whether the cell is excited or inhibited.",

Operant conditioning is a term that was coined by B. F. Skinner in 1937. Operant conditioning is distinguished from classical conditioning (or respondent conditioning) in that operant conditioning deals with the modification of \"voluntary behaviour\" or operant behaviour.

In this procedure, the two points on a pair of calipers are simultaneously positioned on the skin and one determines the minimum distance between the two caliper points that can be perceived as separate points of stimulation. This is called the two-point discrimination threshold. If the distance is very small, each caliper point touches the receptive field of only one sensory neuron. If the distance between stimulation points is less than this threshold, only one point of stimulation can be felt. Thus, the two-point discrimination threshold is a measure of tactile acuity. The magnitude of two-point discrimination thresholds varies from place to place on the body and is smallest where touch receptors are most abundant. Stimulus points on the back, for instance, must be separated by at least 65 mm before they can be distinguished as separate, whereas on the fingeips two stimuli are recognized if they are separated by as little as 2 mm. Blind individuals benefit from the tactile acuity of fingeips to facilitate the ability to read Braille; the dots forming Braille symbols are separated by 2. 5 mm. Two-point discrimination is used to test the integrity of the dorsal column (medial lemniscus) system, the central pathway for touch and proprioception.",

This variation results paly from a capability of the brain itself to suppress input of pain signals to thenervous system by activating a pain control system called an analgesia system. The analgesia system consists of three major components: (1) The periaqueductal gray and periventricular areas of the mesencephalon and upper pons surround the aqueduct of Sylvius and poions of the third and fouh ventricles. Neurons from these areas send signals to (2) the raphe magnus nucleus, a thin midline nucleus located in the lower pons and upper medulla, and the nucleus reticularis paragigantocellularis, located laterally in the medulla. From these nuclei, second-order signals are transmitted down the dorsolateral columns in the spinal cord to (3) a pain inhibitory complex located in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord. At this point, the analgesia signals can block the pain before it is relayed to the brain. Ref: guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 edition page number: 698, 699, 700",
