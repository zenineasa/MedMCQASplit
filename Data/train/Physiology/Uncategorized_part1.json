The RV, the FRC, and the TLC, however, cannot be determined with a spirometer because the subject cannot exhale all the gas in the lungs. The lung volumes not measurable with spirometry can be determined by the nitrogen-washout technique, by the helium-dilution technique, and by body plethysmography. The FRC is usually determined, and RV (which is equal to FRC minus ERV) and the TLC (which is equal to VC plus RV) are then calculated from volumes obtained by spirometry. Ref: Levitzky M. G. (2007).

However, the use of these tools to cardiac imaging is severely limited because of motion aifacts produced by constantly in motion heart completing an entire cycle of contraction and relaxation in about 1 second.- So radiological cardiac imaging requires a 'window' of minimum cardiac motion to reduce motion aifacts and achieve meaningful images.

        "exp": "The plasma colloid osmotic pressure is often low in alcoholics with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). The diseased liver cannot produce adequate amounts of albumin, which leads to a decrease in the concentration of albumin in the plasma, i. e., hypoalbuminemia. Because about 75% of the plasma colloid osmotic pressure can be attributed to the presence of albumin in the plasma, the decrease in plasma albumin concentration that occurs in the latter stages of cirrhosis often leads to peripheral edema. Cirrhosis also causes excess fluid to accumulate in the peritoneal cavity as ascites. In the case of ascites, the edema results not only from hypoalbuminemia, but also from poal vein obstruction (which increases capillary hydrostatic pressure) as well as the obstruction of lymphatic drainage of the liver. In fact, ascites is observed more often than peripheral edema in liver disease. A decrease in capillary hydrostatic pressure would tend to decrease fluid loss from the capillaries, and thereby oppose the development of edema. A decrease in the colloid osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid would decrease fluid loss from the capillaries, thereby opposing the development of edema. A decrease in interstitial hydrostatic pressure would tend to increase fluid loss from the capillaries, but this cannot be considered a primary cause of edema because the interstitial hydrostatic pressure actually increases when a tissue becomes edematous.

Sympathetic stimulation to the efferent glomerular aerioles causes their constriction and increases the filtration rate, leading to an increase in urinary output. Similarly, with the loss of sympathetic innervation, such as due to sympathectomy of the kidney, relaxation of tone of the afferent aeriole occurs and the filtration rate increases, which results in an increased urine output. Decreased urine output may result from the constriction of the afferent aerioles, leading to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate.

        "exp": "Ans. C: Heat sensation. Lateral spinothalamic tract carries fibers of all type of pain and temperature impulses (both hot and cold). Spinothalamic tract. It transmits information to the thalamus about pain, temperature, itch and crude touch. The pathway decussates at the level of the spinal cord, rather than in the brainstem like the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway and coicospinal tract. Posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway/dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway/dorsal white column-medial lemniscus system. It is the sensory pathway responsible for transmitting fine touch, vibration and conscious proprioceptive information from the body to the cerebral coex as well as tactile pressure, barognosis, graphesthesia, stereognosis, recognition of texture, kinesthesia and two-point discrimination. The name comes from the two structures that the sensation travels up: the posterior (or dorsal) columns of the spinal cord, and the medial lemniscus in the brainstem. Because the posterior columns are also called dorsal columns, the pathway is often called the dorsal column-medial lemniscus system, or DCML for sho. (Also called posterior column-medial lemniscus or PCML pathway). The PCML is pathway is composed of rapidly conducting, large, myelinated fibers. The pathway is tested with the Romberg's test. Lesions to the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway below the decussation of its fibers produce loss of sensation on the same side of the body as the lesion. Above the decussation produces loss of sensation on the opposite side of the body than the lesion",

PCo2 is most impoant input regulating magnitude of ventilation under resting conditions. Changes in alveolar ventilation have immediate, pronounced effect on aerial Pco2 (unlike Po2). Even slight alterations from normal Pco2 induce significant reflex. Increased Pco2 increases ventilation. Blood Brain Barrier is permeable to Co2, so increased aerial Pco2 increases brain ECF Pco2 and, it stimulates central chemoreceptors which increases ventilation by stimulating respiratory centers. Regulation of respiration: The rhythmic discharges from the brain that produce spontaneous respiration are regulated by alterations in aerial Po2, PCo2, and H+ concentration. There are numerous factors that affect and control ventilation. Chemical control Co2 ( CSF and brain interstitial fluid H+ concentration) o2 ( carotid and aoic bodies) H+ ( carotid and aoic bodies) Nonchemical control Vagal afferents from receptors in the airways and lungs Afferents from the pons, hypothalamus, and limbic system Afferents from proprioceptors Afferents from baroreceptors: aerial, atrial, ventricular, pulmonary Preipheral (Carotid & Aoic) Chemoreceptors: The carotid bodies are located at the bifurcation of common carotid aery. They send afferents in the carotid sinus nerve to the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) the aoic bodies are located between the arch of aoa and pulmonary aery afferents ascend in the recurrent laryngeal nerves to the vagus (X). Stimulation results from a decrease in carotid and aoic body tissue PO2. Central Chemoreceptors: situated near (beneath) the ventral surface of the medulla, near the origins of the vagi and glossopharyngeal nerves these are anatomically separate from the respiratory centres, and are bathed in brain ECF. This is impermeable to both H+ and HCO3 -, however CO2 diffuses readily and decreases pH of CSF within a few minutes, which subsequently increases ventilation.

Also Know: Surfactant has both lipid (90%) and protein (10%) component. About half of the lipids are dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and the remaining are phosphatidylglycerol, cholesterol and other lipids. Half of the proteins are apoproteins and other half is composed of proteins normally found in blood plasma. Function of surfactant: The surfactant greatly reduces the surface tension allowing easier expansion and collapse of alveoli during during respiration and the resulting changes in pressure. It also helps the alveoli to expand and shrink at the same rate thereby reducing the chance for isolated overexpansion and total collapse of alveolar sacs.

The inhibitory effect is exeed at both the pituitary and the hypothalamic levels. The inhibition is due primarily to an action on DNA, and maximal inhibition takes several hours to develop, although more rapid \"fast feedback\" also occurs. The ACTH-inhibiting activity of the various steroids parallels their glucocoicoid potency. A drop in resting coicoid levels stimulates ACTH secretion, and in chronic adrenal insufficiency the rate of ACTH synthesis and secretion is markedly increased. Thus, the rate of ACTH secretion is determined by two opposing forces: the sum of the neural and possibly other stimuli converging through the hypothalamus to increase ACTH secretion, and the magnitude of the braking action of glucocoicoids on ACTH secretion, which is propoionate to their level in the circulating blood",

        "question": "Insulin causes?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Induction of lipogenesis ACTIONS OF INSULIN Insulin affects the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Effects on carbohydrate metabolism The overall effect of insulin is to decrease blood glucose level. Insulin increases the utilization of glucose and decreases its production by its following actions: - i) Stimulation of oxidation of glucose by glycolysis especially in the liver and skeletal muscle. ii) Stimulation of glycogenesis i. e., insulin ours conversion of glucose into its storage form, glycogen. This action is seen in both liver and muscles. iii) Inhibition of gluconeogenesis. Insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose by myocytes (skeletal muscle, cardiac muscles), adipocytes (adipose tissue) and hepatocytes. Tissues that do not depend on insulin for glucose uptake include brain, erythrocytes (RBC), the epithelial cells of kidney & intestine, Liver, and Cornea & lens of eye. The mechanism through which insulin increases glucose uptake is different in different tissues. In the muscle and adipose tissues, insulin increase facilitated diffusion by increasing glucose transpoer (GLUT4 ) on the cell membrane. In the liver, insulin stimulates glucose entry into hepatocytes indirectly by induction of glucokinase so that the glucose entering the liver cells is promptly conveed to glucose - 6 - phosphate (glucose trapping). This keeps the intracellular glucose concentration low and ours entry of glucose into the liver. Thus, though the liver do not depend on insulin for glucose uptake, insulin stimulates glucose entry into hepatocytes. That means glucose entery can occur in liver without the action of insulin, but this is facilitated by insulin. On the other hand, myocytes (skeletal and cardiac muslces) and adipocytes (adipose tissue) are dependent on insulin for glucose uptake. Increased uptake of glucose in the glucose has following effects:- i) T Glycolysis:- It is due to induction of key enzymes of glycolysis by insulin. These key enzymes are glucokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. ii) Increased glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis):- It is due to induction of glycogen synthase. iii) Decreased glycogen break-down (Glycogenolysis): - It is due to inhibition of enzyme phosphorylase. iv) Decreased gluconeogenesis:- It is due to inhibition of enzymes Pyruvate carboxylase, PEP carboxykinase, fructose 1, 6-bisphosphatase, glucose - 6 - phosphates. Effects on lipid metabolism Insulin induces lipogenesis by inducing enzyme acetyl CoA carboxylase, the rate limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis. Triglyceride synthesis is increased by induction of lipoprotein lipase. Lipolysis (13-oxidation) is decreased due to inhibition of hormone sensitive lipase, so that the fat in the adipose tissue is not broken down. Thus free fatty acid and glycerol are decreased. Because of antilipolytic action insulin decreases ketogenesis. There are two impoant lipases: - i) Lipoprotein lipase: - It hydrolysis the triglycerides of chylomicrons and VLDL into free fatty acid and glycerol in the vessels of skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles and adipose tissue. There FFA is taken up by the cells of these tissue and is conveed back into the triglyceride and the FFA is stored as triglyceride. So, lipoprotein lipase is involved in the synthesis of triglyceride. Lipoprotein lipase is stimulated by insulin, therefore insulin stimulates triglyceride synthesis. ii) Hormone sensitive lipase: - It is involved in lipolysis and cause degradation of stored triglyceride of adipose tissue into FFA and glycerol. FFA comes out into the blood raising the FFA levels of blood. Insulin inhibits hormone sensitive lipase therefore decreases FFA levels of blood. Effects on protein metabolism Insulin stimulates synthesis of protein (anabolism) and inhibits protein breakdown (catabolism). Insulin increases the active transpo of many amino acids into the tissue. In addition insulin increases protein synthesis by increasing the rate of synthesis of m. RNA.",

Thus, angiotensin II, a major regulator of glomerular function, causes constriction of both afferent and efferent aerioles, as well as reducing Kf. The overall outcome for GFR depends on the relative magnitudes of these actions, which vary in different pathophysiological conditions.

        "question": "Maximum pressure in left ventricle is seen in which phase of cardiac cycle?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Ventricular ejection During ventricular ejection phase, when the steeply rising left ventricular pressure exceeds the aoic pressure (120 mm Hg), it is able to push open the aoic valve and eject the blad into the aoa, making the onset of ventricular ejection. PHASE OF CARDIAC CYCLE A cardiac cycle refers to the interval between onset of one heabeat to the onset of the next heart beat. It has two main phases: Ventricular systole and ventricular diastole. Ventricular systole (or simply systole) The systolic phase is divided into: - i) Isovolumetric contraction: As the ventricular contraction stas, the intraventricular pressure begins to rise, leading to an abrupt closure of AV valves (mitral and tricuspid valves). The closure of AV valves produces first heart sound (S1). the pressure is not enough to push open the semilunar valves (aoic and pulmonary) but causes the closed AV valve to bulge into the atrium, causing a small but sharp rise in atrial pressure called the 'C' wave on jugular venous pulse (JVP). Because both the valves (AV valves an semilunar valves) are closed, there is no change in volume, i. e., there is isovolumetric (isometric) contraction. Isovolumetric contraction ends with opening of semilunar (aoic and pulmonary) valves. ii) Ventricular ejection: When the steeply rising ventricular pressure exceeds the pressure in aoa and pulmonary aery, the semilunar valves open and ventricular ejection begins. The ejection of blood is rapid at first (rapid ejection phase), but slows down during later pa of systole (slow ejection phase). During rapid ejection phase, when the ventricles contract, the fibrous paition separating the ventricles from the atria (the AV ring) is pulled down. As a result, the atrial muscles get stretched and the atria dilate which causes a sharp fall in atrial pressure and the X-descent in JVP. iii) Protodiastole: In this very sho phase, ventricles sta relaxing and ventricular pressure begins to fall very sharply but the semilunar valves are still open. As a result, the column of blood in aoa (or pulmonary aery for right ventricle) tries to fall into the ventricle, hitting on its way the semilunar (aoic or pulmonary) valves. This causes closure of the aoic/pulmonary valves which produces 2\" heart sound (S2). The venous blood flow continues to flow in the atria from great veins (SVC and ICC) and there is relaxation of fibrous AV ring due to ventricular relaxation; both of which cause a rise in atrial pressure and production of `V' wave in JVP. Ventricular diastole (or simply diastole) The diastole phase is divided into: - i) Isovolumetric relaxation: - This phase is the period between the closure of semilunar valve and opening of the AV valve. The ventricles continue relaxing and there pressure continues to fall. However, as both valves (AV valves and semilunar valves) are closed, there is no change in volume, i. e., isovolumetric relaxation. Relaxation phase ends with opening of AV valve. ii) Rapid ventricular filling: - When the ventricular pressure falls below atrial pressure, AV valves open and the accumulated blood in the atria rushes into the ventricle very rapidly. This passive filling contributes to 70% of ventricular filling, normally. This results in a sharp fall in atrial pressure which produces Y descent in JVP. iii) Diastasis: - After the initial rapid ventricular filling, blood flows slowly and smoothly from the SVC and IVC through the right atrium into the right ventricle without any turbulence anywhere along the path. Similarly, blood from the pulmonary veins flows into the left ventricle without any turbulence. This phase of nonturbulent ventricular filling is called diastasis. The atrial pressure remains slightly greater than the ventricular pressure because inflow to atrium exceeds the outflow the atrium. iv) Last rapid filling phase (atrial systole): - The atria contract and pump blood rapidly into the ventricles. Atrial systole is associated with sharp rise in atrial pressure which produces a-wave in JVP.",

        "question": "With increased flow to loop of Henle, decreased in GFR is by?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Tubulo-glomerular feedback Autoregulation of GFRThe GFR is normally well autoregulated in the range of 70-180 mm Hg of systemic pressure. Feedback mechanisms intrinsic to the kidney normally keep the renal blood flow and GFR relatively constant, despite marked changes in aerial blood pressure. The relative constancy of GFR and renal blood flow is referred to as autoregulation. The primary function of autoregulation in other tissues (other than kidneys) is to maintain the delivery of oxygen and nutrient at a normal level and to remove the waste products of metabolism, despite changes in aerial pressure. In the kidneys, the non-nal blood flow is much higher than that required for these functions. the major function of autoregulation in the kidney is to maintain a relatively constant GFR and to allow precise control of renal excretion of water and solutes. There are two plausible hypotheses for explaining the autoregulation of GFR (i) Tubuloglomerular feedback hypothesis, and (ii) Myogenic hypothesis. Tubulo-glomerular feedback. To perform the function of autoregulation, the kidneys have a feedback mechanism that links changes in sodium chloride concentration at the macula densa with the control of renal aeriolar resistance. This feedback helps to ensure a relative constant delivery of sodium chloride to the distal tubule and helps prevent spurious fluctuations in renal excretion that would otherwise occur. The tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism has two components that act together to control GFR: - i) An afferent aeriolar feedback mechanism (usually this component is referred to as tubuloglomerular feedback, and ii) An efferent aeriolar feedback mechanism. These feedback mechanisms depend on the juxtaglomerular apparatus which consists of: (i) Macula densa, i. e., specialized epithelium of distal tubule where it comes in contact with afferent aeriole, (ii) Juxtaglomerular cells, i. e., modified smooth muscle cells of afferent aeriole, and iii) Lacis cells. Afferent aeriolar feedback mechanism: - Decrease in renal aeriolar pressure causes decrease in GFR and as a result low Na. CI is delivered to distal tubules. This is sensed by macula densa and the signal is transmitted to afferent aerioles which causes decreased resistance of afferent aerioles. Decreased afferent aeriolar resistance increases glomerular hydrostatic pressure and therefore GFR. The transmitter involves is adenosine which causes opening of Ca*2 channels. Efferent aeriolar feedback mechanism: - Decreases GFR causes delivery of less Na. Cl to distal tubule, which is sensed by macula densa cells and the signal is transmitted to juxtaglomerular (JG) cells which secrete renin. As a result renin angiotensin system is activated and there is generation of angiotensin II which causes constriction of efferent aeriole. This results in increased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and increased GFR. Opposite occurs when there is increase aerial pressure and increased GFR. Increased Na. Cl is delivered to the macula densa which causes constriction of afferent aeriole and decrease,: renin by JG cells with decreased efferent aeriole resistance. It would be wise to know about glomerulotubular balance, which may be confused by tubuloglomerular feedback. Glomerulotubular balance: - Tubular reabsorption in proximal tubules is load-dependent, i. e., when the GFR increase, the reabsorption of the filtrate in the proximal tubule increases propoionately. It occurs because tubular reabsorption is flow-limited. Because of glomerulotubular balance, the urinary Na+ output does not increase massively when the GFR increases. Myogenic Autoregulation. Afferent aerioles constrict in response to augmented blood pressure. Aeriolar constriction restores GFR to normal levels. Possibly, stretching of aerioles leads to the opening of stretch - sensitive Ca+2 channels on aeriolar smooth muscle cells resulting in a Ca+ influx that causes the cells to contract.",

The blood flow to lower arm and hand is arrested by inflating the blood pressure cuff 20 mm Hg above the patient's systolic pressure. Chvostek sign Chvostek sign is the twitch of the facial muscles, caused by a gentle tap over the facial nerve in front of the ear. It is due to the hyperirritability of facial nerve.

        "exp": "Serotonin is a vasoconstricting hormone, produced in the brain and GI tract. In the GI tract it is produced normally by enterochromaffin cells (argentaffin cells). The principal function is to regulate smooth muscle contraction and peristalsis. Serotonin: also called 5-hydroxytryptamine, is a chemical substance that is derived from the amino acid tryptophan. Principally found stored in three main cell types; (a) Serotonergic neurons in the CNS and in the intestinal myenteric plexus, (b) Enterochromaffin cells in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and (c) Blood platelets Synthesis: Serotonergic neurons and enterochromaffin cells can synthesize serotonin from its precursor amino acid L-tryptophan, whereas platelets rely upon uptake of serotonin for their stores. The biochemical pathway for serotonin synthesis initially involves the conversion of L-tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan by the enzyme L-tryptophan hydroxylase. This enzyme provides the rate limiting step for serotonin synthesis. Metabolism of serotonin is carried out primarily by the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO), The action of MAO conves serotonin to 5-hydroxyindole acetaldehyde which in turn is readily metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to produce 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid as the major excreted metabolite of serotonin. Carcinoid syndrome: are neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) of predominantly enterochromaffin cell origin (Kulchitsky cells). Carcinoid syndrome is made up of a constellation of symptoms which are caused by the release of a variety of substances (serotonin, histamine, and substance P, among others) by the carcinoid tumor. It may cause trytophan deficiency and causes decrease in niacin synthesis leading to pellagra. Ref: Principles of medical physiology, By Sabyasachi Sicar, Page 641.",

(But the H+ conc. in the brain parallels the aerial PCO2 and not aerial H+ conc.) There are 2 types of chemoreceptors regulating ventilation: central chemoreceptors (located in brain stem, mainly medulla) and the peripheral chemoreceptors (aoic and carotid bodies). They regulate ventilation by resonding to increased aerial H+ conc., increased Pa. CO2, and decreased Pa02. Thus the peripheral chemoreceptors are stimulated by hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidemia to cause hyperventilation; whereas central chemoreceptors are stimulated only by hypercapnia. Why the central chemoreceptors respond to blood Pa. CO2 and not to blood H+ cone?. Even though the central chemoreceptors are directly stimulated by H+ ions: the blood H+ ions are poorly permeable through the blood brain barrier and hence are not able to regulate ventilation through the central chemoreceptors. Whereas CO2 is highly permeable to the blood brain barrier. It enters the brain, where it is hydrated to give rise to H+ and HCO3- ions. Now these H+ ions directly stimulate the central chemoreceptors to regulate the ventilation. So the central chemoreceptors respond to changes in H+ ions in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain interstial which are brought about by changes in aerial Pa. CO2.

Chloride concentration remains near 150 meq/L, and gastric juice maintains its isotonicity at varying secretory rates.

        "exp": "D i. e. AO- Highly immunogenic ABO blood group antigen is due to complex oligosaccharide (glycoprotein) found on RBC membrane. It is inherited as medelian autosomal dominantsQ.- ABO blood group system remains the most impoant blood group system in clinical practice because ABO antibodies are invariably present in plasma when person's RBC's lack the corresponding antigen. And because of these preformed antibodies the reaction is inunediate. Genotype of a person with A blood group may either be AA (homozygous) or AO (heterozygous). The genotype in B blood group may be BB (Hamozygous) or BO (heterozygous); in AB blood group AB and in blood group O the genotype is OO.- Highly immunogenic ABO blood group antigen is due to complex oligosaccharide (glycoprotein) found on RBC membrane. It is inherited as medelian autosomal dominantsdeg.- Alleles of ABO gene are located on long arm of chromosome 9 (and of Rh genes on chromosome 1). One of the 3 gene types (A, B, 0) determines blood group.- Individuals can be divided into 4 major blood group types on the basis of antigens (or agglutinogens) present on membrane of RBC. They are called agglutinogens as they are responsible for blood cell agglutination in transfusion reactions. Type A individuals have A antigen, type B have B, type AB have both A & B, and blood group type 0 have neither antigen. A and B antigens are complex oligosaccharides that differ in their terminal sugar moietyQ. H antigen is present in all blood types. H gene coding fucose transferase that adds a terminal fucose, forms H antigen. Individuals with type A express a second transferase that catalyzes placement of a terminal Nacetylgalactosamine on H antigen, whereas type B (individuals) express a second transferase that places a terminal galactose. Individuals with AB blood group have both and with 0 blood have neither transferases (i. e only H antigen persists in 0 group). Plasma antibodies against RBC agglutinogens are called agglutinins. Antigens very similar to A and B are very common in intestinal bacteria and possibly food to which new borns are exposed. These substances initiate the development of Anti A & Anti B antibodies. Therefore, infants rapidly develop antibodies against the antigens not present in their own cells. So type A blood group individual develop anti B, type B develop anti A, type 0 develop both, and type AB individual develop neither. Immediately after bih, the quantity of agglutinins in the plasma is almost zero. An infant begins to produce agglutinins, 2 to 8 months after bih and maximum titre is reached at 8 to 10 yrs. of age. Then it gradually declines throughout the remaining years of life. Anti A and anti B antibodies are isohaemagglutinins (iso antibodies) as they are produced by an individual against antigens produced by members of same species (isoantigens). Antibodies are usually 1gM type and cannot cross placenta. 0 type individual can produce IgG type antibodies.- The basic difference between ABO blood group system and other blood group systems (such as Rh, Kell, Duffy, MNSs blood groups), which makes the ABO group so impoant is that - preformed ABO antibodies are present in persons serum when his RBCs lack the corresponding antigen (ie. anti B antibody would be present in a person of type A and type 0 blood groups. These two blood groups do not have the 'B' antigen on the RBCs). This is not the case with other blood groups. Preformed antibodies are not present. They are formed only after an exposure to the antigen, for example Rh negative person do not have anti- Rh antibodies, these antibodies are formed only after an exposure to Rh positive blood (by a blood transfusion, i. e. this makes the first blood transfusion safe even if mismathced). These preformed antibodies, rapidly destroy the RBCs of any mismatched blood transfusion.- \"In clinical transfusion practice, the ABO blood groups are the most impoant and can never be ignored in red cell transfusion, because individuals who genetically lack any antigen, have antibodies against the red cell types that they have not inherited. These antibodies can destroy red cells rapidly in circulation\". But the question arises - why are these agglutinins (antibodies against AB antigen) produced in people who do not have the respective agglutinogens (A or B antigens) on their RBCs? The answer is that - Small amounts of group A and B antigens enter the body in food, in bacteria, and in other ways, and these substances initiate the development of the anti-A and anti-B agglutinins",

Myoglobin (F = 0. 75) and albumin (F = 0. 005) are not freely filteredQ. Glomerular filtrate is protein free, and devoid of any cellular element, including RBCQ. The concentration of other constituents including most salts & organic molecules, are similar to the concentration in plasma (i. e., are freely filtered). Exception to this generalization are few low molecular weight substances, such as calcium & fatty acidQ, which are paially bound to plasma proteins and thus not filtered freely. Neutral substances with molecular diameter of < 4 nanometers are filtered freely and filtration of substance > 8 nm approaches zero, as the pores of glomerular membrane are of - 8 nm (80 angstroms) size. Between 4 - 8 nm, filtration is inversely propoional to diameter. However, negatively charged large molecules are filtered less easily than positively charged molecules of equal molecular sizeQ, and even neutral molecule are filtered much more easily than negatively charged molecules of same size. This is because, the negative charges of basement membrane & podocytes restrict and repel large negatively charged and attract positively charged molecules. This explains, only 0. 2% filtrability of negatively charged albumin with an effective diameter of - 7 nm. Inulin (a polymer of fructose found in dahalia tubers, MW 5200) that is freely filtered, neither reabsorbed nor secreted in tubules, and creatinine (that is freely filtered, secreted & reabsorbed in some amount) are used to measure glomerular filtration rate (GFR).",

Surfactant is a mixture of dipahnitoylphosphaticlylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins. If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. In spherical structures like the alveoli, the distending pressure equals two times the tension divided by the radius (P = 2T/r); if T is not reduced as r is reduced, the tension overcomes the distending pressure. \" \"Pulmonary surfactant therefore helps stabilize the sizes of the alveoli and helps keep them open and available to paicipate in gas exchange. \" -Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems By Lauralee Sherwood p477 There are two factors which prevent the alveolar collapse: Reduction of surface tension due to surfactant The surface tension of the alveolar lining fluid varies with surface area. This is because surfactant reduces surface tension in propoion to its surface concentration. Surfactant is insoluble in water and floats on the surface of the alveolar lining fluid. In larger alveoli the surfactant is more spread out (dilute) and the surface tension is higher. As the alveoli reduce in size during expiration the concentration of the surfactant increases and the more it reduces the surface tension. 2. Alveolar interdependence There is interaction between adjacent groups of alveoli. Therefore, collapsing alveoli pull on adjacent alveoli preventing fuher collapse. This is termed alveolar interdependence.",

(The pancreas also secretes insulin, but this is not secreted by the same pancreatic tissue that secretes intestinal pancreatic juice. Instead, insulin is secreted directly into the blood-not into the intestine-by the islets of Langerhans that occur in islet patches throughout the pancreas). The most important of the pancreatic enzymes for digesting proteins are trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypolypeptidase. By far the most abundant of these is trypsin. Trypsin and chymotrypsin split whole and partially digested proteins into peptides of various sizes but do not cause release of individual amino acids. However, carboxypolypeptidase splits some peptides into individual amino acids, thus completing digestion of some proteins all the way to the amino acid state. The pancreatic enzyme for digesting carbohydrates is pancreatic amylase, which hydrolyzes starches, glycogen, and most other carbohydrates (except cellulose) to form mostly disaccharides and a few trisaccharides. The main enzymes for fat digestion are (1) pancreatic lipase, which is capable of hydrolyzing neutral fat into fatty acids and monoglycerides; (2) cholesterol esterase, which causes hydrolysis of cholesterol esters; and (3) phospholipase, which splits fatty acids from phospholipids. When first synthesized in the pancreatic cells, the proteolytic digestive enzymes are in the inactive forms trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and procarboxypolypeptidase, which are all inactive enzymatically. They become activated only after they are secreted into the intestinal tract. Trypsinogen is activated by an enzyme called enterokinase, which is secreted by the intestinal mucosa when chyme comes in contact with the mucosa. Also, trypsinogen can be autocatalytically activated by trypsin that has already been formed from previously secreted trypsinogen. Chymotrypsinogen is activated by trypsin to form chymotrypsin, and procarboxypolypeptidase is activated in a similar manner.",

Superficial receptors are present in the epidermis or papillary layer of dermis. In glabrous (nonhairy) skin these receptors are Merkel's disc (slowly adapting) and Meissner 's corpuscle (rapidly adapting). In hairy skin there are hair follicle receptors. Deep receptors are present in deeper dermis or in the subcutaneous tissues. The deep receptors are same in both hair and nonhairy skin and include Ruffini's end organ (slowly adapting) and Pacinian corpuscle (Rapidly adapting). Touch, pressure and vibration are different forms of same sensation. Pressure is felt when the force applied on the skin is sufficient to reach the deep receptors, whereas touch is felt when the force is insufficent to reach the deep receptors, therefore detected by superficial receptors (Merkel's disc, meissner's corpuscle). Vibrations are rhythmic variations in pressure (i. e. rhymic variations of force that reaches the deep receptors). Whether a tactile receptor senses pressure or vibration depends on whether the receptor is slowly adapting or slowly adaping:? i) Slowly adapting (Ruffini's end organ):- Are meant to detect sustained pressure; they are useless for vibrations. ii) Rapidly adapting (Pacinian corpuscle):- Stop discharge in response to sustained pressure; they are useful only when the pressure fluctuates rapidly, i. e. during vibrations. The higher the rate of adaptation of a receptor, the greater is the vibration frequency it can detect. Thus, tactile (touch) sensation can be divided into:? A) Superficial (generally considered as touch):- Detected by Meissner 's corpuscle (detect texture of surface, i. e. rough or smooth) and Merkel's disc (detect two point discrimination).

The response to a standard oral test dose of glucose, the oral glucose tolerance test, is used in the clinical diagnosis of diabetes. Impaired glucose tolerance in diabetes is due in pa to reduced entry of glucose into cells (decreased peripheral utilization). In the absence of insulin, the entry of glucose into skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle and other tissues is decreased. Glucose uptake by the liver is also reduced, but the effect is indirect. Intestinal absorption of glucose is unaffected, as is its reabsorption from the urine by the cells of the proximal tubules of the kidneys.

Displacing the process in a direction perpendicular to this axis provides no change in membrane potenital, and displacing the processes in directions that are intermediate between these two directions produces depolarization or hyperpolarization that is propoional to the degree to which the direction is toward or away from the kinocilium. Thus, the hair processes provide a mechanism for generating changes in membrane potential propoional to the direction and distance the hair moves.",

        "exp": "In severe anemia, diminished transpo of oxygen in the blood leads to hypoxia in the tissues. The hypoxia causes small aeries and aerioles to dilate, which allows greater-than-normal amounts of blood to return to the heart. In severe anemia, the viscosity of blood may decrease by 50% or more because blood viscosity depends largely on the concentration of red blood cells. This decrease in viscosity lowers the resistance to blood flow in the peripheral tissues (decreases peripheral vascular resistance) allowing even greater amounts of blood to return to the heart. Blood is often shunted away from the splanchnic vascular bed in anemia, which can cause gastrointestinal problems. Ref: Mohrman D. E., Heller L. J. (2010). Answers to Study Questions. In D. E.

They are non peristaltic, non progressive and occur with both voluntary and involuntary swallow. Primary peristaltic contractions are the major stripping wave that are initiated by the act of swallowing and that propel ingested material through the entire length of the oesophagus into the stomach. Primary peristaltic contractions are progressive and move down the oesophagus at rate of 2 to 4 cm/sec and reach the LES about 9 seconds after the initiation of swallowing. It relaxes the lower oesophageal sphincter before the bolus reaches it. Secondary peristaltic contractions are also progressive, similar to primary peristalsis but elicited by different stimuli. Rather than beginning with swallowing, as in primary peristalsis, the secondary peristaltic wave occurs in response to distension or irritation anywhere along the oesophagus. It begins at the level of the focus of stimulation and propels oesophageal contents distally. In effect, secondary peristalsis is a mechanism for ridding the oesophagus of refluxed gastric contents or material left behind after the progression of the primary peristaltic wave.",

        "question": "Not done by insulin:",
        "exp": "Ketogenesis Repeat, from May 09 Lack of insulin promotes ketogenesis. Insulin prevents ketngenesis. Metabolic Effects of Insulin Insulin is known as hormone of abundance. When there is great abundance of energy-giving foods in the diet, especially excess amounts of carbohydrates, insulin is secreted in large amounts. The net effect of insulin is storage of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Therefore, insulin is called the hormone of abundance. In the case of excess carbohydrates, it causes them to be stored as glycogen mainly in the liver and muscles. Also, all the excess carbohydrates that cannot be stored as glycogen are conveed under the stimulus of insulin into fats and stored in the adipose tissue. In the case of proteins, insulin has a direct effect in promoting amino acid uptake by cells and conversion of these amino acids into protein. In addition, it inhibits the breakdown of the proteins that are already in the cells. Effect of Insulin on Carbohydrate Metabolism Immediately after a high-carbohydrate meal, the glucose that is absorbed into the blood causes rapid secretion of insulin. The insulin in turn causes rapid uptake, storage, and use of glucose by almost all tissues of the body, but especially by the muscles, adipose tissue, and liver. Insulin promotes liver uptake and storage as glycogen One of the most impoant of all the effects of insulin is to cause most of the glucose absorbed after a meal to be stored almost immediately in the liver in the form of glycogen. Then, between meals, when food is not available and the blood glucose concentration begins to fall, insulin secretion decreases rapidly and the liver glycogen is split back into glucose, which is released back into the blood to keep the glucose concentration from falling too low. The mechanism by which insulin causes glucose uptake and storage in the liver includes several almost simultaneous steps: Insulin inactivates liver phosphorylase, the principal enzyme that causes liver glycogen to split into glucose. This prevents breakdown of the glycogen that has been stored in the liver cells. Insulin increases the activity of the enzyme glucokinase, which is one of the enzymes that causes the initial phosphorylation of glucose after it diffuses into the liver cells. Once phosphorylated, the glucose is temporarily trapped inside the liver cells because phosphorylated glucose cannot diffuse back through the cell membrane. iii. Insulin also increases the activities of the enzymes that promote glycogen synthesis, including especially glycogen synthase, which is responsible for polymerization of the monosaccharide units to form the glycogen molecules. Insulin Promotes Conversion of Excess Glucose into Fatty Acids When the quantity of glucose entering the liver cells is more than can be stored as glycogen or can be used for local hepatocyte metabolism, insulin promotes the conversion of all this excess glucose into fatty acids. These fatty acids are subsequently packaged as triglycerides in very-low-density lipoproteins and transpoed in this form by way of the blood to the adipose tissue and deposited as fat. Insulin also inhibits gluconeogenesis. Insulin Promotes Muscle Glucose Uptake and Metabolism Without insulin muscle membrane is only slightly permeable to glucose. Thus between meals, non-exercising muscles, derive their energy from fatty acids, not on glucose. In the presence of insulin, muscle membrane become permeable to glucose. If the muscles are not exercising after a meal and yet glucose is transpoed into the muscle cells in abundance, then most of the glucose is stored in the form of muscle glycogen instead of being used for energy. The glycogen can later be used for energy by the muscle. Effect of Insulin on Carbohydrate Metabolism in Other Cells Insulin increases glucose transpo into and glucose usage by most other cells of the body (with the exception of the brain cells, as noted) in the same way that it affects glucose transpo and usage in muscle cells. Effect of Insulin on Fat Metabolism Although not quite as visible as the acute effects of insulin on carbohydrate metabolism, insulin's effects on fat metabolism are, in the long run, equally impoant. Long-term effect of insulin lack causes extreme atherosclerosis, often leading to heart attacks, cerebral strokes, and other vascular accidents. Insulin Promotes Fat Synthesis and Storage Fat sparing effect-Insulin has several effects that lead to fat storage in adipose tissue. First, insulin increases the utilization of glucose by most of the body's tissues, which automatically decreases the utilization of fat, thus functioning as a fat sparer. Insulin also promotes fatty acid synthesis. Synthesis of fat in liver-When more carbohydrates are ingested than can be used for immediate energy, are used for fat synthesis. Almost all this synthesis occurs in the liver cells, and the fatty acids are then transpoed from the liver by way of the blood lipoproteins to the adipose cells to be stored. Storage of fat in the adipose Cells. Insulin has two other essential effects that are required for fat storage in adipose cells: Insulin inhibits the action of hormone-sensitive lipase. This is the enzyme that causes hydrolysis of the triglycerides already stored in the fat cells. Therefore, the release of fatty acids from the adipose tissue into the circulating blood is inhibited. Insulin promotes glucose transpo through the cell membrane into the fat cells in exactly the same ways that it promotes glucose transpo into muscle cells. Some of this glucose is then used to synthesize minute amounts of fatty acids, but more impoant, it also forms large quantities of a-glycerol phosphate. This substance supplies the glycerol that combines with fatty acids to form the triglycerides that are the storage form of fat in adipose cells. Therefore, when insulin is not available, even storage of the large amounts of fatty acids transpoed from the liver in the lipoproteins is almost blocked. Insulin Deficiency Increases Use of Fat for Energy Insulin Deficiency Causes Lipolysis of Storage Fat and Release of Free Fatty Acids. In the absence of insulin, hormone-sensitive lipase in the fat cells becomes strongly activated. This causes hydrolysis of the stored triglycerides, releasing large quantities of fatty acids and glycerol into the circulating blood. This free fatty acid then becomes the main energy substrate used by essentially all tissues of the body besides the brain. Insulin Deficiency Increases Plasma Cholesterol and Phospholipid Concentrations. The excess of fatty acids in the plasma associated with insulin deficiency also promotes liver conversion of some of the fatty acids into phospholipids and cholesterol, two of the major products of fat metabolism. This high lipid concentration--especially the high concentration of cholesterol--promotes the development of atherosclerosis in people with serious diabetes. Excess Usage of Fats During Insulin Lack Causes Ketosis and Acidosis. Insulin lack also causes excessive amounts of acetoacetic acid to be formed in the liver cells. Some of the acetoacetic acid is also conveed into 13-hydroxybutyric acid and acetone. These two substances, along with the acetoacetic acid, are called ketone bodies, and their presence in large quantities in the body fluids is called ketosis. In severe diabetes the acetoacetic acid and the I3-hydroxybutyric acid can cause severe acidosis and coma, which often leads to death. Effect of Insulin on Protein Metabolism Insulin Promotes Protein Synthesis and Storage. During the few hours after a meal when excess quantities of nutrients are available in the circulating blood, not only carbohydrates and fats but proteins as well are stored in the tissues; insulin is required for this to occur. The manner in which insulin causes protein storage is not as well understood as the mechanisms for both glucose and fat storage. Some of the facts follow. Insulin stimulates transpo of many of the amino acids into the cells. Among the amino acids most strongly transpoed are valine, leucine, isoleucine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. Insulin increases the translation of messenger RNA, thus forming new proteins. Over a longer period of time, insulin also increases the rate of transcription of selected DNA genetic sequences in the cell nuclei, thus forming increased quantities of RNA and still more protein synthesis--especially promoting a vast array of enzymes for storage of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. 4. Insulin inhibits the catabolism of proteins, thus decreasing the rate of amino acid release from the cells, especially from the muscle cells. 5. In the liver, insulin depresses the rate of gluconeogenesis. Because the substrates most used for synthesis of glucose by gluconeogenesis are the plasma amino acids, this suppression of gluconeogenesis conserves the amino acids in the protein stores of the body. In summary, insulin promotes protein formation and prevents the degradation of proteins. Note that: The brain is quite different from most other tissues of the body in that insulin has little effect on uptake or use of glucose. Instead, the brain cells are permeable to glucose and can use glucose without the intermediation of insulin. The brain cells are also quite different from most other cells of the body in that they normally use only glucose for energy and can use other energy substrates, such as fats, only with difficulty. Therefore, it is essential that the blood glucose level always be maintained above a critical level, which is one of the most impoant functions of the blood glucose control system. When the blood glucose falls too low, into the range of 20 to 50 mg/100 ml. symptoms of hypoglycemic shock develop, characterized by progressive nervous irritability that leads to fainting, seizures, and even coma.

        "question": "Which of the following vasopressin receptors MOST likely mediates vasopressin antidiuretic action?",
        "exp": "The vasopressin receptor family is unique among all classes of peptide receptors, since its members couple to different subsets of G proteins. Vasopressin binds to four distinct types of receptor subtypes V1a, V1b, V2 and the oxytocin receptor. The V2 receptors are located on the basolateral membrane of collecting duct cells. This receptor belongs to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Stimulation of the V2 receptor by vasopressin leads to the activation of a G protein (Gs), resulting in the activation of adenylyl cyclase, the production of c. AMP, and the stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA stimulates aquaporin 2, a water channel protein, which undergoes vesicular trafficking, inseing into the apical membrane of the duct cells, thereby increasing the water permeability of that membrane. At maximal ADH levels, less than 1% of the filtered water is excreted, with the minimum urine volume of 500 mL/day and osmolality of 1200 mosmol/L. Long term regulation by vasopressin involves the effects of c. AMP on the c. AMP-response elements in the 5'-flanking region of the AQP2 gene, which increases the abundance of aquaporin 2 protein in the target cells. The human V2 receptor gene, AVPR2, is located in chromosome region Xq28. The genetic form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by mutations in the coding region of the V2 receptor gene. Note: AQP6 is a water channel protein that is localized exclusively in intracellular membranes in renal epithelia. Vasopressin has low affinity for oxytocin receptors. The oxytocin receptor is a typical class I G protein-coupled receptor, primarily stimulating phospholipase C beta activity. The V1a receptor mediates smooth muscle contraction (vasoconstriction in splanchnic, coronary, cerebral, peripheral, pulmonary, and intrahepatic vessels), platelet aggregation, hepatic glycogenolysis, and coagulation factor release by vasopressin. It is also proposed that brain V1a vasopressin receptors may mediate the effect of ADH on sho-term memory and learning, antipyresis, cardiovascular responsivity, and brain development. Ref: Reid I.

The strength of the contractions of small intestine is propoional to the frequency of the spike generated by the slow waves\"Slow wave\" amplitude is increased by GIT hormones released during digestion e. g. gastrin, CCK-PZ and motilin; whereas secretin and glucagons decrease the slow wave amplitude. Intestinal motility. Digestive hormones, cholecystokinin (CCK), gastrin and motilin increase intestinal motility. Secretin decreases the activity. Serotonin and insulin can increase motility. Glucagon can decrease motility. Secretin. Secretin is synthesized in cytoplasmic secretory granules of S-cells which are found mainly in mucosa of duodenum and smaller numbers in jejunum of small intestine. Secretin is released into circulation and/or intestinal lumen in response to low duodenal pH. Also the secretion of secretin is increased by the products of protein digestion bathing the mucosa of the upper small intestine. It is the active form of prosecretin. This acidity is due to hydrochloric acid in the chyme that enters the duodenum from the stomach the pyloric sphincter. Secretin targets the pancreas, which causes the organ to secrete a bicarbonate-rich fluid that flows into the intestine. Bicarbonate ion is a base that neutralizes the acid, thus establishing a pH orable to the action of other digestive enzymes in the small intestine and preventing acid burns. Other factors are also involved in the release of secretin such as bile salts and fatty acids, which result in additional bicarbonates being added to the small intestine. Secretin release is inhibited by H2 receptor antagonists, which reduce gastric acid secretion. As a result, if the pH in the duodenum increases above 4. 5, secretin cannot be released. Secretin increases water and bicarbonate secretion from duodenal Brunner's glands in order to buffer the incoming protons of the acidic chyme. It also enhances the effects of cholecystokinin to induce the secretion of digestive enzymes and bile from pancreas and gallbladder, respectively. It counteracts blood glucose concentration spikes by triggering increased insulin release from pancreas, following oral glucose intake. Although secretin releases gastrin from gastrinomas, it inhibits gastrin release from the normal stomach. It reduces acid secretion from the stomach by inhibiting gastrin release from G cells. In addition, secretin stimulates pepsin secretion from chief cells",

During quiet breathing, the intrapleural pressure fluctuates between -3 and -6 mm Hg, depending upon the phase of respiration, more negative at the end of inspiration and less negative during expiration. Intrapleural pressure (Pleural pressure). It is the pressure between two pleural surfaces. The lung is covered with visceral pleura and the thoracic cage is lined on inside with parietal pleura. Between the two layers of pleura is a very narrow space, called the pleural cavity. Intrapleural pressure is always negative and during quiet breathing the Intrapleural pressure fluctuates between -3. 8 mm Hg (- 5. 0 cm watery to -6. 0 mm Hg (-8. 0 cm water). Now let us examine why the pleural pressure is negative; more negative during inspiration, less negative during expiraion, but always negative during quiet breathing. The key to the answer is the fact that both the thoracic cage and lungs are elastic structures. Being elastic structure they both tend to recoil, but in opposite direction. The lungs have a tendency to collapse and thoracic cage has a tendency to expand. However, because of the anatomical relationships in the body, these tendencies do not normally materialize. But the tendencies do create an inward pull on the visceral pleura (by lung) and an outward pull on parietal pleura (by thoracic cage). The results of these pulls is a negative pressure in the space between the pleural surfaces, i. e., in the pleural cavity.",

In addition to increasing plasma Ca2+, PTH increases phosphate excretion in the urine and thereby suppresses plasma phosphate levels.

PTH also increases the formation of 1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, and this increases Ca2+ absorption from the intestine. On a longer time scale, PTH stimulates both osteoblasts and osteoclasts.

Pulmonary aerial pressure is generated by the right ventricle ejecting blood into the pulmonary circulation, which acts as a resistance to the output from the right ventricle. With each ejection of blood during ventricular systole, the pulmonary aery blood volume increases, which stretches the wall of the aery. As the heart relaxes (ventricular diastole), blood continues to flow from the pulmonary aery into the pulmonary circulation. The smaller aeries and aerioles serve as the chief resistance vessels, and through changes in their diameter, regulate pulmonary vascular resistance. In hemodynamic terms, the mean pulmonary aerial pressure (PAP) can be described by. PAP = (CO x PVR) + PVPWhere CO = cardiac output, PVR = pulmonary vascular resistance, and PVP = pulmonary venous pressure. The PVP is essentially the same as left atrial pressure. Therefore, increases in CO, PVR or PVP will lead to increases in PAP. Normally, mean pulmonary aery pressure is about 15 mm. Hg, and the pulmonary aery systolic and diastolic pressures about 25 and 10 mm. Hg, respectively. Pulmonary venous pressure is about 8 mm. Hg. Therefore, the pressure gradient driving flow through the pulmonary circulation is rather small at about 7 mm. Hg (mean pulmonary aerial minus venous pressures).",

It slows penetration of some smaller molecules like urea. Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) & Blood Cerebrospinal fluid Barrier (BCSFB) - BBB & B-CSF-B exist between the blood & brain interstitial fluid and CSF respectively to uniquely limit the exchange of substances into the brain. That is why the constituents of CSF are not the same as in ECFs (extracellular fluids) elsewhere in body. - These barriers exist both at the choroid plexus and at tissue capillary membranes. The cause of low permeability is presence of tight junctions b/w the adjacent endothelial cells. - Because of the sensitivity of coical neurons to even minor variations of ionic (K+, Ca++, Mg++, I-1+ etc) concentration changes, BBB is an additional defence evolved to protect & maintain the constancy of environment of neurons in CNS. It also protects brain from endogenous & exogenous toxins in the blood & prevents escape of neurotransmitters in general circulation. BBB is immature at bih and is breached (broken down) in areas of injury, infection and tumors. Tumors develop new capillary that lack light junction and contact with astrocyte - so the radioactive iodine labeled albumin penetrates tumor rapidly, making it stand out as an island of radioactivity in the surrounding normal brain. BBB is temporarily disrupted by sudden marked increase in BP or by IV injection of hypeonc fluids. Blood-CSF Barrier & Blood-Brain Barriers are highly permeable to water, CO2 (carbondioxide), 02 (oxygen)2, and most lipid soluble (lipophilic) substances such as free forms of steroid hormones, alcohol and anestheticsQ; slightly permeable to electrolytes like Na. (sodium), K+ (potassium) and Ck (chloride); and almost totally impermeable to plasma proteins, protein bound forms of steroid hormones, protein antibodies and most non lipid soluble large organic molecules (i. e. impermeable to, in general, all proteins and polypeptides)Q. It slows penetration of some smaller molecules like urea. - Passive diffusion across cerebral capillaries with tight junction is very limited but numerous carrier-mediated & active transpo system move substances out (more freely) as well as into the brain. Many peptide & drugs actually cross the cerebral capillaries but are transpoed back rapidly into blood by a multidrug nonspecific, p-glycoprotein - ATP binding transpoer in apical membranes of endothelial cells, that transpos various proteins & lipids across cell membranes. So larger (adequate) amounts of chemotherapeutic drugs, analgesics & opioid can be delivered to brain by inhibiting this transpoer. - Transpoer exist for glucose, thyroid hormone, leptin hormone (control appetite & sympathetic activity) choline, several organic acids, nucleic acid precursors and basic, neutral and acidic aminoacids at BBB. Diffusion of glucose (the ultimate source of energy for nerve cells) across BBB would be very slow in absence of glucose transpoers like GLUT 1. Two isoforms GLUT 1 (55 K) of brain capillaries/endothelium and GLUT 1 (45 K) of astroglia, neuron (+ GLUT-3) & microglia (+ GLUT-5) are encoded by a same gene, but they differ in the extent of glycosylation.

Where is the enzyme responsible for this change located?",
        "exp": "Chylomicrons are produced by enterocytes (intestinal epithelial cells), using gut luminal triglycerides for the source of the lipid. The chylomicrons are secreted into the gut lymphatic system, and from there drain eventually into the systemic venous system from the thoracic duct, and hence into the serum poion of the blood. They are initially large and have a very high triglyceride content. With time, lipoprotein lipase releases triglycerides from the chylomicron core by hydrolyzing them to more easily absorbed fatty acids. The enzyme is located on the external surface of the vascular endothelium of tissues with triglyceride needs such as skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle tissue, and lactating breast. The result of lipoprotein lipase activity is that the chylomicrons shrink in size. While adipose tissue can utilize chylomicrons, lipoprotein lipase is located on the endothelial cells rather than adipocytes. Adipocytes have an adipose tissue lipase, which is an intracellular enzyme that can cleave triglycerides to glycerol and fatty acids, allowing them to be released into the circulation when chylomicrons are low. Enterocytes have the ability to pick up mixed micelles from the gut lumen for repackaging in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum as chylomicrons.

The remaining daughter cells generated from the meiotic events contain relatively little cytoplasm and are referred to as polar bodies. Eventually, the polar bodies degenerate. There may be one or two polar bodies in the ovum. The first polar body is one of the two products in the first stage of meiosis, just before ovulation and is considered diploid, with 23 duplicated chromosomes.

Ferric salts show poorer absorption. Macrocytic megaloblastic anemias arise from derangements in DNA metabolism and are symptoms of either vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Diagnosis of the underlying cause of the anemia must precede the treatment, since folate administration will apparently correct the anemia but allow undetected neurological damage associated with B12 deficiency to progress.

Recognition of spatial relationship is a function of angular gyrus (inferior parietal lobule). Temporal lobe. It is located beneath the Syln fissure on both cerebral hemispheres. The temporal lobe is involved in auditory perception and is home to the primary auditory coex. It is also impoant for the processing of semantics in both speech and vision. The temporal lobe contains the hippocampus and plays a key role in the formation of long-term memory. The superior temporal gyrus includes an area (within the Syln fissure) where auditory signals from the cochlea (relayed several subcoical nuclei) first reach the cerebral coex. This pa of the coex (primary auditory coex) is involved in hearing. Adjacent areas in the superior, posterior and lateral pas of the temporal lobes are involved in high-level auditory processing. This includes speech, for which the left temporal lobe in paicular seems to be specialized. Wernicke's area, which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes, plays a key role (in tandem with Broca's area, which is in the frontal lobe). The functions of the left temporal lobe are not limited to low-level perception but extend to comprehension, naming, verbal memory and other language functions. The underside (ventral) pa of the temporal coices appear to be involved in high-level visual processing of complex stimuli such as faces (fusiform gyrus) and scenes (parahippocampal gyrus). Anterior pas of this ventral stream for visual processing are involved in object perception and recognition. The medial temporal lobes are involved in episodic/declarative memory. Deep inside the medial temporal lobes lie the hippocampi, which are essential for memory function - paicularly the transference from sho to long term memory and control of spatial memory and behavior. Damage to this area typically results in anterograde amnesia.",

In healthy subjects, this occurs at the end of quiet expiration, i. e., at functional residual capacity. Therefore, in healthy adults at rest FRC is essentially equal to relaxation volume of respiratory system and FRC is usually treated as synonymous with relaxation volume. However, in real sense FRC and relaxation volume are not synonymous terms and, while the two volumes are some times equal, more often they are not, i. e., active or passive mechanisms often operate to make FRC different from relaxation volume. For example, neonates have a more compliant (less stiff) chest wall. The chest wall thus has less elastic recoil to balance that of lung, thus decreasing the relaxation volume of lung. FRC then is often maintained above relaxation volume by active mechanisms like inspiratory muscle activity and slowing of expiration. Another example where FRC and relaxation volume may differ is in obstructive lung disease where FRC is dynamically determined and may be considerably above relaxation volume.",
