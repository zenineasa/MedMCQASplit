Ref.: Lange medical physiology by Ganong 23rd ed., ch. 15* Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate nervous system.* At chemical synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles. Nerve impulses trigger release of glutamate from the presynaptic cell. Glutamate acts on ionotropic and metabotropic (G-protein coupled) receptors.* Because of its role in synaptic plasticity, glutamate is involved in cognitive functions such as learning and memory in the brain.* Excitotoxicity due to excessive glutamate release and impaired uptake occurs as part of the ischemic cascade and is associated with stroke, autism, some forms of intellectual disability, and diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lathyrism, and Alzheimer's disease.* In contrast, decreased glutamate release is observed under conditions of classical phenylketonuria",

From tonsil, pharynx, posterior part of tongue, carotid body and sinus - through glossopharyngeal nerve: From pharynx, larynx, trachea, esophagus, and other thoracic and abdominal viscera -through vagus nerve. Special visceral afferents. From anterior 2/3 of tongue (except circumvallate papillae) and palate - through facial nerve. From posterior 1/3 of tongue (including circumvallate papillae) - through glossopharyngeal nerve. From posterior most part of tongue and epiglottis - through vagus nerve. o NTS is involved in regulation of cardiovascular system through baroreceptors and chemoreceptors. o There is a general consensus that glutamate is the neurotransmitter released at the therminals of baroreceptor and chemoreceptor afferents in NTS. -- www. springer. como However, cholinergic, GABAergic, and opioidergic mechanisms are also present in NTS.",
