Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes.

Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I. V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I. V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin.

        "exp": "LEAD Chronic Poisoning (plumbism; saturnism) Signs and Symptoms:- (1) Facial Pallor: The facial pallor paicularly about the mouth is one of the earliest and most consistent sign. It seems to be due to vasospasm. (2) Anemia: There may be polycythaemia with polychromatophilia in early stages, but later there is anemia which is associated with polychromasia, punctate basophilia, reticulocytosis, poikilocytosis, anisocytosis, nucleated red cells (sideroblasts) and an increase in mononuclear cells, whereas polymorphonuclear cells and platelets are decreased. The anemia is probably due to decreased survival time of red blood cells and inhibition of haeme synthesis by interference with the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin. Punctate basophilia or basophilic stippling means the presence of many dark blue-coloured pinhead- sized spots in the cytoplasm of red blood cells, due to toxic action of lead on porphyrin metabolism. Reticulocytes and basophilic stippled cells result from the inhibition of 5 pyrimidine nucleotidase, an impaired ability to rid the cell of RNA degradation products and the aggregation of ribosome. (3) Line: A stippled blue line, called Buonian line, is seen on the gums. It appears due to subepithelial deposit of granules at the junction with teeth, only near diy or carious teeth, within a week of exposure, especially on upper jaw. It is due to formation of lead sulphide by the action of hydrogen sulphide formed by decomposed food in the mouth. (4) Colic and Constipation: It is usually later symptom. Colic of intestines, ureters, uterus and blood vessels occur in 85% of cases. The colic occurs at night and the pain may be very severe. Constipation is usual but diarrhoea or vomiting may occur. (5) Lead Palsy: It usually occurs late, and is seen in less than 10% of cases. There may be tremors, numbness, hyperaesthesia, and cramps before the actual muscle weakness. It is commoner in adults than in children, and men are paicularly affected. The muscle groups affected are those most prone to fatigue. Usually the extensor muscles of the wrist (wrist drop; radial nerve is affected) are affected, but the deltoid, biceps, anterior tibial (foot drop), and rarely muscles of eye or intrinsic muscles of hand or foot are affected. The paralysis is associated with degeneration of the nerve and atrophy of the muscles. Recovery may be complete but is usually slow. ( 6) Encephalopathy: It is common in children often associated with tetraethyl lead. The symptoms are vomiting, headache, insomnia, visual disturbances, irritability, restlessness, delirium, hallucinations, convulsions, coma and death. Lead encephalopathy is usually irreversible and about 85% have permanent brain damage. Death occurs in about 25% cases. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-544, 545",

Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes. Clinical Features Inhalation * Constriction about throat * Dizziness * Loss of consciousness * Coma * Death Ingestion * CNS: Headache, anxiety, agitation, dizziness, confusion, convulsions, coma * CVS: Initially bradycardia and hypertension and latter tachycardia and hypotension, arrhythmias * RS: Tachypnea followed by bradypnea * GIT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness. Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I. V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I. V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin. Samples to be preserved for chemical analysis * Blood * Routine viscera * Lung * Brain * Heart * Spleen is considered as best specimen due to presence of more RBCs.

The tremors are coarse, intentional type, interspersed with jerky movements, initially involving hands. Later it involves lip, tongue, arms and legs. The advanced condition of tremors is called as \"Hatter's shakes\" (because the condition was first described among felt hat workers). In Hatter's shakes, the tremor becomes so severe that daily activities of person are grossly impaired such as shaving, writing, holding cup etc. As the disease progresses, the most severe form of tremor are called as \"Concussio mercurialis\" which means no activity is possible * Mercurial erethism - a classical manifestation of chronic mercury poisoning characterized by cluster of psychiatric symptoms including disturbance inpersonality, abnormal shyness, timidity, loss of self confidence, insomnia, excitability, progressing later into delirium with hallucinations (Mad as hatter). * Colitis * Melanosis coli * Mercury dermatitis - from mercuric sulphide (cinnabar) as red areas of tattoo has been repoed. * Dementia * Renal failure * Acrodynia (Pink disease):-Seen mostly in children and caused by chronic mercury exposure. It causes anorexia, insomnia, profuse sweating, skin rash, redness, vesication and desquamation (peeling) of palm, finger, sole and photophobia. The hands and feet becomes - puffy, pinkish, painful, paraesthetic, perspiring and peeling (remember 6 P's) * Shedding of teeth and ulceration of gums.

Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes. Clinical Features Inhalation * Constriction about throat * Dizziness * Loss of consciousness * Coma * Death Ingestion * CNS: Headache, anxiety, agitation, dizziness, confusion, convulsions, coma * CVS: Initially bradycardia and hypertension and latter tachycardia and hypotension, arrhythmias * RS: Tachypnea followed by bradypnea * GIT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness. Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I. V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I. V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin. Samples to be preserved for chemical analysis * Blood * Routine viscera * Lung * Brain * Heart * Spleen is considered as best specimen due to presence of more RBCs.

        "exp": "STRYCHNOS NUX VOMICA Strychnine ( kuchila) is a powerful alkaloid obtained from the seeds of strychnos nux vomica. The seeds contain two principal alkaloids; strychnine and brucine. Mech of Action: It competitively blocks ventral horn motor neurone postganglionic receptor sites in the spinal cord and brainstem and prevents the effects of glycine (the presumed inhibitory transmitter). Widespread inhibition in the spinal cord results in &; release&; excitation. The action is paicularly noted in the anterior horn cells. It stimulates the cerebralcoex. GABA, the neurotransmitter for presynaptic inhibitory neurons is not affected. Signs and Symptoms: When crushed seeds are taken, the symptoms are delayed for an hour or more. If the alkaloid is swallowed, the symptoms occur very rapidly, usually within five to fifteen minutes. Bitter taste in the mouth, sense of uneasiness and restlessness, feeling of suffocation and fear, and difficulty in swallowing occur. The convulsions are preceded by such prodromal symptoms as increased acuity of perception, increased rigidity of muscles, and muscular twitchings. Convulsions are produced due to direct action on the reflex centres of spinal cord, and affect all the muscles at a time. These are at first clonic, but eventually become tonic. During the convulsions, the face is cyanosed and has anxious look, eyes are staring, eyeballs prominent and pupils are dilated. Risus sardonicus results from contraction of the jaws and facial muscles in which the corners of the mouth are drawn back. The mouth is covered with froth, frequently bloodstained. The convulsions are most marked in anti-gravity muscles, so that the body typically arches in hyperextension (opisthotonos). In supine position, the body is suppoed by the heels and head. The legs are adducted and extended, the arms are flexed over the chest or rigidly extended, and the hands are tightly clenched. The head is bent backwards, and the whole of the body becomes rigid, often assuming a bow-like form. Sometimes, the spasm of the abdominal muscles may bend the body forward (emprosthotonos), or to the side (pleorosthotonos). Consciousness is not lost and the mind remains clear till death.

The convulsions last for 30 seconds to 2 minute and are precipitated by slightest stimuli such as sudden noise, a current of air or gentle touching of patient. The convulsions are first clonic but eventually becomes tonic. In between the convulsions, the muscles are completely relaxed and it is an impoant diagnostic feature. * The convulsions are more marked in anti-gravity muscles and body arches in hyperextension position and lies on heel and head. This position of body is known as opisthotonos. It is most common position. However, at time, the body may bend forward and the condition is called as emprosthotonos. If body bends side wise (i. e. lateral bending), the condition is called as pleurothotonos. * Contraction of the muscles of face causes widening of the angle of mouth with creases appearing around eyelids.

Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes.

Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I. V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I. V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine.

It blocks Krebs cycle and interrupts oxidative phosphorylation causing depletion of ATP and death of cell. * It also inhibits transformation of thiamine into acetyl CoA and Succinyl -CoA resulting in thiamine deficiency. * It replaces the phosphorus in the bones * Arsenic is incorporated into hair, nails and skin. * It causes increased permeability of small blood vessels with inflammation and necrosis of intestinal mucosa thus causing manifestation of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. Clinical Features Acute poisoning A patient with acute arsenic consumption may present in 1. Fulminant type: collapse and circulatory failure 2. Gastroenteritis type-constriction of throat, difficulty in swallowing, rice water stools, hepatic fatty infiltration, headache, veigo, hypehermia 3.
