All phosphorus poisoning are caused by white (yellow) phosphorus (Red phosphorus is nontoxic).Phosphorus poisoningo Phosphorus is a protoplasmic poison affecting cellular oxidation and causing anoxic necorbiosis, classically affecting liver. It increases fat deposition and inhibits glycogen deposition in liver. It is used in fire works (Diwali poisoning) and as rat poison. Lethal dose is 60-120 mg.o Phosphorus occurs in two formsWhite/yellow phosphorus: It is white, and becomes yellow on exposure to air. It is translucent, waxy, luminous and crystalline cylinders. It has garlic like odor. It is insoluble in water and luminous in dark. Its fumes show phosphorescence.Red phosphorus : It is reddish brown, inert, odourless and tasteless. It is nontoxic (thus poisoning occurs only due to white phosphorus). It is put on the sides (striking surface) of match box (along with powdered galss).Acute poisoningo It has following stages :1st Stage <GI irritation): There is nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and garlic odor. This stage lasts for 8 hours to 3 days.2nd Stage (Asymptomatic): This stage lasts for 3 days.3rd Stage : There is liver and kidney damage due to absorbed phosphorus. Initially liver is enlarged due to acute fatty infiltration. Later liver shruks due to necrosis, i.e. acute yellow atrophy.Chronic poisoningo Toothache is the first symptom which is associated with loosening of teeth, necrosis of gums and osteomyelitis of jaw. Therefore chronic phosphorus poisoning is also know as phossy jaw (or glass jaw).Postmortem appearanceo There is garlic odor. Viscera and stool glow in dark (due to luminosity).o To preserve luminosity, viscera are preserved in saturated saline solution. Rectified spirit is not used as it causes loss ofluminosity.",

        "question": "Greenish discolouration at putrefaction is due to-",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Sulph-meth Hb Signs of putrefactiono The signs and effects of putrefaction are as followsColour changesThe earliest sign of decomposition is greenish discoloration of body, seen in right iliac fossa externally and under liver internally. This is due to involvement of caecum. Which contains more liquid and is full of bacteria. In these areas, it appears in 12-18 hours and slowly spreads to whole body in 24-48 hours. Greenish discoloration is due to formation of sulph-meth-haemoglobin,Morbling occurs when Hb dissociates from RBCs and the colour of Hb is taken up by vessels, which are seen as prominent lines having purple or green or brown colour. Marbling occurs in 24-48 hours.Formation of foul smelling gasesDue to action of bacteria, foul smelling gases are formed, e.g. SO., H^S, ammonia, methane and CO,.Effects of gasesBloating up of body occurs in 34-48 hours. At the same time following changes occurs :i) Appearance of stomach contents and froth on nose and mouth.ii) Degloving and destocking with appearance of putrifactive blisters,iii) Emptying of heart due to pressure of gas.In 48-72 hours prolapse of rectum and uterus occur and postmortem delivery may occur if the dead woman is pregnant. Color of postmortem staining also changes to brown and finally to black. False rigidity (putrefactive rigidity ) may occur at this time.Appearance of maggotsFlies lay their eggs in wrounds, exposed natural orifices and exposed moist parts of the body and folds of skin, e.g. neck, axilla, nostrils, mouth etc. Flies lay eggs in 6-12 hours after death and these eggs change in larva (maggot) in 1 -2 days. Thus maggots appear in 2-3 days after the death. After further 4-5 days, the maggots change into pupa, which convert into adult flies in next 3-5 days. Thus adult flies will be coming out of the body after total 8-12 days of death. Thus appearance of maggot determine the time since death.Other late changesIn 3-5 days : Nails and teeth become loose and can be pulled out, sutures of skull may separate.In 7-12 days: Liquefaction of body (colliquative putrefaction) occurs.In 1-3 months : Skeletonization of dead body occurs.Finally: Bones also decompose : Exposed bones in 1-5 years and deep burried bone (> 2 meters) in 25-100 years.Internal changesLiver becomes spongy and is called as foamy or Swiss cheese or honeycombed liver.In 7-12 days lequefaction of internal organs occur.Floatation of body (if body is in water)Floatation of body occurs due to accumulation of sufficient putrefactive gases. Abdomen is above (due to gases) and spine is below during floatation. Time required for floatation is ordinarily 24 hours after death in summers and 2-3 days in winter. Factors affecting floatation are :-i) Causing early floatation : Newborn mature infant, females, in summer, clothed body, obese, in sea water and in still pond wrater.ii) Causing delayed floatation : Still birth/i immature newrbom, male, in winter, naked body, thin built, in fresh water and in running stream water.o inspiration and expiration before death has no effect on floatation as floatation is due to putrefactive gases (not due to respiratory air).",

        "question": "Treatment of choice for opioid poisoning is?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., IV Naloxone Treatment of morphine or heroin poisoningo Treatment can be divided into: -A. Treatment of toxicity (overdose)o Overdose is a medical emergency, and is treated with opioid antagonist to reverse the complications (respiratory depression) by antagonizing the action on opioid receptors. Intravenous naloxone is the antagonist of choince for morphine (heroin) poisoning. Oral naltrexone is used for maintenance therapy, once acute poisoning has been treated by iv naloxone. Intravenous nalmefene is another specific antagonist.B. Treatment of dependenceo Treatment of dependence include medically supervised withdrawal and detoxification, followed by maintenance therapy.(a) Detoxificationo Detoxification process include abrupt withdrawal of opioid followed by management of the emergent withdrawal symptoms, i.e., treatment of withdrawal syndrome. Detoxification can be done by any of the following:1. Substitution of long-acting opioid agonism:- Methadone is the treatment of choice. Because of its agonistic activity on opioid receptors it suppresses withdrawal symptoms. L-alpha-acetyl-methadol/ Levomethyl (LAAM) is the other opioid agonist which was used for this purpose. However it is no longer in use because some patients developed prolonged QT intervals (torsades de points).2. Substitution of partial agonist:- Buprenorphine can be used in place of methadone because of its partial agonistic activity on opioid receptor.3. Substitution by a2 agonists:- Clonidine acts as a sympatholytic agent due to its agonistic action on central presynaptic a2 receptors which reduce nor-adrenergic activity. Therefore, clonidine reduces the adrenergic withdrawal symptoms. Lofexidine another a2 agonist, is an alternative to clonidine.4. Clonidine plus naltrexone:- A more rapid detoxification can occur when clonidine is used along with naltrexone. Naltrexone, when given in opioid dependent patient, causes withdrawal symptoms because of its antagonistic action. These can be treated with clonidine. The addition of short acting Benzodiazepine (lorazepam or oxazepam) and NSAIDs, will help relieve withdrawl symptoms not covered by clonidine. It should he kept in mind that naltrexone should not be used alone for detoxification (to treat withdrawl syptoms) as it precipitates or worsens the withdrawl syndrome.5. Other drugs:- Dextropropoxyphene, diphenoxylate(b) Maintenance therapyo Once detoxification phase is over (i.e., withdrawal symptoms have been managed), the patient is maintained on any of the following drugs to prevent relapse by reducing craving and preventing 'kick' or 'euphoria' produced by opioids (morphine or heroin). Drugs used are:-1. Methadone:- Reduces craving and 'kick/euphoria ' from morphine or heroin because their opioid receptors are already occupied.2. LAAM and buprenorphine:- Similarly reduce craving.3. Opioid antagonists (naltrexone):- Naltrexone can be used orally to assist in the rehabilitation of ex-opioid abusers who are fully withdrawn (otherwise it induces an acute withdrawl syndrome). Naltrexone prevents relapse by discouraging substance seeking behavior - If a patient, who is on naltrexone maintenance therapy, takes an opioid, there is no 'kick' or 'euphoria' as opioid receptors are already blocked. Naltrexone can be used with clonidine as in detoxification.",

All phosphorus poisoning are caused by white (yellow) phosphorus (Red phosphorus is nontoxic).Phosphorus poisoningo Phosphorus is a protoplasmic poison affecting cellular oxidation and causing anoxic necorbiosis, classically affecting liver. It increases fat deposition and inhibits glycogen deposition in liver. It is used in fire works (Diwali poisoning) and as rat poison. Lethal dose is 60-120 mg.o Phosphorus occurs in two forms:-1) White/yellow phosphorus: It is white, and becomes yellow on exposure to air. It is translucent, waxy, luminous and crystalline cylinders. It has garlic like odor. It is insoluble in water and luminous in dark. Its fumes show phosphorescence.2) Red phosphorus : It is reddish brown, inert, odourless and tasteless. It is nontoxic (thus poisoning occurs only due to white phosphorus). It is put on the sides (striking surface) of match box (along with powdered galss).Acute poisoningo It has following stages:i) 1st Stage (GI irritation): There is nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and garlic odor. This stage lasts for 8 hours to 3 days.ii) 2nd Stage (Asymptomatic): This stage lasts for 3 days.iii) 3rd Stage: There is liver and kidney damage due to absorbed phosphorus. Initially liver is enlarged due to acute fatty infiltration. Later liver shruks due to necrosis, i.e. acute yellow atrophy.Chronic poisoningo Toothache is the first symptom which is associated with loosening of teeth, necrosis of gums and osteomyelitis of jaw. Therefore chronic phosphorus poisoning is also know as phossy jaw (or glass jaw).Postmortem appearanceo There is garlic odor. Viscera and stool glow in dark (due to luminosity).o To preserve luminosity, viscera are preserved in saturated saline solution. Rectified spirit is not used as it causes loss of luminosity.",
