The label should mention the name, age, sex, registration number, etc. (2) Workers who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis or external injury should not handle AIDS victims. (3) Proper protective clothing, full sleeves overalls instead of simple surgical gowns, water-proof plastic apron, head cap, face mask, goggles if eye glasses are not worn, double gloves (heavy autopsy gloves over surgical gloves), waterproof rubber gumboots of knee length with shoe covers. A plastic visor will protect eyes and mucosal surfaces from splash injury. A high efficiency paiculate air- filled respirator or a powered air-purifying respirator should be worn. ( 4) Handling sharp instruments: Avoid accidental pricks and cuts from needles, scalpels, etc. If a cut is made in the rubber gloves or needle injury occurs they should be removed immediately and replaced with new ones. Hands and other skin surfaces should be washed immediately and thoroughly if contaminated with blood or other body fluids. Infection of AIDS can be acquired by transdermal inoculation through cuts and needle punctures. About 0. 3 to 0. 5% of individuals will become seropositive. Transmission rates from contaminated needle punctures or close contact are 10 to 30 times higher for serum hepatitis than for AIDS. The incident should be repoed to proper authority to get their blood check for HIV seropositivity. (5) Handling specimens for laboratory examination: Mucocutaneous contact with the body fluids, and aerosol inhalation should be avoided. They should be properly labelled andfilled with 10% formalin solution and should be handled with gloved hands. (6) Disposal of used instruments: They should be dipped in 20% glutaraldehyde (cidox) for half-an-hour, washed with soap or detergent and water, dried and then rinsed in methylated spirit and air dried. (7) All soiled gauze and cotton, etc. should be collected in a double plastic bag for incineration. (8) Laundry material, such as aprons, towels, etc. should be soaked in one percent bleach for half-an-hour, washed with detergent and hot water, and autoclaved. (9) Clean- up procedure: Wear new intact disposable gloves. Small spatters and spills of blood and other body fluids can be wiped up with disposable tissues o1* towels which are discarded in special bio-hazard bags and properly disposed. The autopsy table and floor should be cleaned with one percent bleach solution, followed by washing with soap and water. (10) Disinfectants: 1: 10 dilution of common household bleach or a freshly prepared sodium hypochlorite solution are recommended. Liquid chemical germicides commonly used in health care facilities and laboratories are effective against HIV. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-121, 122",

This occurs: (a) from breathing in a contaminated atmosphere, e. g., from exposure to the fumes in wells and tanks, or from exposure to sewer gas, (b) from mechanical interference with the passage of air into or down the respiratory tract, e. g., in smothering, choking, hanging, strangulation, drowning, traumatic asphyxia and ceain forms of acute poisoning. (2) Anaemic anoxia: In this type, oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is reduced, e. g., acute massive haemorrhage, poisoning by carbon monoxide, chlorates, nitrates, coaltar derivatives. (3) Stagnant anoxia: In this type, impaired circulation results in a reduction of oxygen delivery to the tissues, e. g., heart failure, embolism and shock. ( 4) Histotoxic anoxia: In this type, the enzymatic processes by which the oxygen in the blood is used by the tissues are blocked, e. g., acute cyanide poisoning.

The rate of putrefaction is slower in water than in air. Putrefaction is more rapid in warm, fresh water than in cold, salt water. It is more rapid in stagnant water than in running water. Putrefaction is delayed when a body is lying in deep water and is well protected by clothing, while it is rapid in a body lying in water contaminated with sewage. As the submerged cadavers float face down with the head lower than the trunk, gaseous distension and postmoem discolouration are first seen on the face and then spread to the neck, upper extremities, chest, abdomen and the lower extremities in that order. Fluid gravitation in the head ours marked decomposition. When the body is removed from the water, putrefaction is hastened as the tissues have absorbed much water.

Putrefaction Review: Putrefaction is disintegration of body tissues after death produced by the action of bacteria and other microorganism thriving on the body. It represents the last stage in resolution of body from the inorganic to organic state. Putrefaction is the most absolute sign of death. Rate of Putrefaction significantly depends on the medium in which the body lies (Caper&; s Dictum) Caper&; s Dictum: Effect of medium (in which body lies) on rate of putrefaction Casper&; s dictum relates to the rate of putrefaction of a dead body and helps in estimation of time since death. Caper&; s dictum states that a body decomposes in air twice as rapidly as in water and eight times as rapidly in eah. Temperature being the same the ratio of rate of putrefaction of a dead body in water, air and buried in ground is 1: 2: 8 Putrefaction can be identified by both external and internal signs that often in a predictable sequence. First sign of Putrefaction (External) First Internal sign of Putrefaction Greenish discolouration of flank over cecum (right iliac fossa) is the first clinical sign of Putrefaction The greenish discolouration is due to formation of sulphamethemoglobin Typically Appears in 12-24 hours The first internal sign of putrefaction is Greenish discolouration on undersurface of liver (often the area of the liver in contact with the caecum) Putrefaction of internal organs typically proceeds in a predictable fashion depending on multiple factors such as Firmness, Moisture content, density, and/or Quantity of blood in organs. As a general rule, the organs show putrefactive changes in the following order(Order according to Reddy) Larynx & trachea Infant brain Stomach, Intestine, Spleen Liver, Lung Brain Heart Kidney, Bladder Prostate, Uterus (non-gravid) Skin, muscle, tendon Bone Organs to Putrefy early Mucosa of trachea and larynx Stomach and intestine Spleen Liver Brain Organs that Putrefy Late Esophagus, Diaphragnm, Heart Lungs Kidney Urinary bladder Uterus (Non-Gravid) Prostate Ref: APC Essentials of Forensic Medicine by Anil Aggarwal",

After death, reduction of oxygen causes capillary dialtation which is followed by stasis of blood in the dilated capillaries and venules. This causes impaired venous return. As a result of which there is raised venous pressure resulting in over distension and rupture of capillaries and venules. This causes congestion and petechia haemorrhages. Haemorrhages are found in the substance of viscera. Postmoem, the blood is fluid and dark, because of increased amount of carbon dioxide. The large veins are full of blood. Hence the femoral vein is the best site of sample collection in autopsy, whereas the viscera are fully congested. Postmoem fluidity of the blood is assessed. Ref: K. S.

It begins in the eyelids, neck and lower jaw and passes upwards to the muscles of the face, and downwards to the muscles of the chest, upper limbs, abdomen and lower limbs and lastly in the fingers and toes. In individual limbs, it usually progresses from above downwards. Such a sequence is not constant, symmetrical or regular. In individual limbs, it disappears in the same order in which it has appeared. Shapiro (1950) suggests that rigor mois does not follow the anatomical sequence usually described. He suggests that as rigor mois is a physicochemical process, it is most likely to develop simultaneously in all the muscles, although the changes are more easily first detected in the smaller masses than in the larger. The proximo-distal progression is more apparent than real, for the sequence is determined by the bulk and kind of muscle involved. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-161",

It is a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) poion of the body postmoem, causing a purplish red discoloration of the skin. When the heart stops functioning and is no longer agitating the blood, heavy red blood cells sink through the serum by an action of gravity. Ref - Krishnan Vij 5th edition pg 82",

        "question": "Major bacterial enzyme responsible for putrefaction",
        "exp": "DECOMPOSITION It involves two processes: (1) Autolysis and (2) Putrefaction. Autolysis: Autolysis is self-digestion of tissues Putrefaction: The disintegration of body tissues after death is known as decomposition. The terms decomposition and putrefaction are used as synonyms. Putrefaction usually follows the disappearance of rigor mois. During hot season, it may commence before rigor mois has completely disappeared from the lower extremities. Mechanism: Organisms enter the tissues sholy after death, mainly from the alimentary canal, and less often through the respiratory tract or through an external skin wound. Multiplication of bacteria begins within 4 hours and peak is reached within 24-30 hours. The fall in the oxygen concentration in the tissues and rise in hydrogen ion concentration after death our bacterial growth and spread throughout the body. Because the protective agencies of the body are absent, the bacteria spread through the blood vessels using the proteins and carbohydrates of the blood as culture media. The chief destructive bacterial agent is Cl. welchii, which causes marked haemolysis, liquefaction of postmoem clots and of fresh thrombi and emboli, disintegration of tissue and gas formation in blood vessels and tissue spaces. Bacteria produce a large variety of enzymes and these breakdown the various tissues of the body. Lecithinase produced by Cl. welchii is most impoant. This hydrolyses the lecithin which is present in all cell membranes including blood cells*, and is responsible for the postmoem haemolysis of blood. Features: The characteristic features of putrefaction are: (1) changes in the colour of the tissues, (2) the evolution of gases in the tissues, and (3) the liquefaction of tissues. The first external sign of putrefaction in a body lying in air is usually a greenish discolouration of the skin over the region of the caecum, which lies fairly superficially, and where the contents of the bowel are more fluid and full of bacteria. Internally, this is seen on the undersurface of the liver, anterior peritoneal surface of right lobe of liver and adipose tissue around gallbladder, where that organ is in contact with the hepatic flexure and transverse colon. The colour results from the conversion of hemoglobin of blood into sulphmethemoglobin by the hydrogen sulphide formed in the large intestine and escaping into the surrounding tissues. The colour appears in 12 to 18 hours in summer and in one to two days in winter. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-164, 165",
