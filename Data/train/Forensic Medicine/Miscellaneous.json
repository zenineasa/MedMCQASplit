In liver samples, only bodies of postmoem ages ranging from 1 to 7 days allowed us to obtain HMWDNA. HMWDNA was extracted from kidney samples up to one month after death, but the yield of DNA decreased rapidly, becoming very low beyond a period of one week. Past this period, we did not succeed in obtaining DNA fingerprints from DNA extracted. The extraction of DNA from lymph nodes was satisfactory up to one week. Over a postmoem period of 7 days, the DNA was degraded and unsuitable for blotting. HMWDNA was purified from spleen samples up to one week after death and the DNA present in hea tissue or in muscle cells was stable up to one month postmoem period, allowing us to perform DNA fingerprinting.
