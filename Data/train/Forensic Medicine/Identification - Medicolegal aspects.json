The age estimation of adult over 21 years depends on the physiologic age changes in each of the dental tissues. Attrition. QDue to wear and tear from mastication, occlusal (upper) surface of the teeth is destroyed gradually; first involving the enamel, then dentin, and at last, pulp is exposed in the old age. It depends on the functional use of the teeth and also up on the hardness of the enamel. Paradentosis. QRegression of the gums and periodontal tissues surrounding the teeth takes place in the advancing age, gradually exposing the necks and adjacent parts of the roots, due to which the teeth become loose and fall off. Poor oral hygiene increases paradentosis. Secondary Dentin. QIt may develop from the walls w ithin the pulp cavity, and decrease the size of the cavity. First it is deposited at the pulp chamber and gradually extends downwards to the apex, and may completely fill the pulp cavity. This is partly due to ageing and partly due to pathological conditions like caries and paradentosis. Cementum Apposition. QThe cementum increases in thickness particularly due to changes in the tooth position, especially near the end of the root. Secondary cementum is slowly and continuously deposited throughout life and forms incremental lines. Incremental lines (devised by Boyde) appear as cross-striations on the enamel of teeth due to cementum apposition, and are thought to represent daily increments of growth. They can be seen on histological section. The age can be calculated by counting the number of lines from the neonatal line onwards. This is mainly applicable to infants. Root Resorption. QIt involves both cementum and dentin, which show characteristically sharp grooves. Absorption of the root starts first at the apex and extends upwards. It usually occurs in the late age. It may be due to pathological process. Transparency of the Root. QIt is not seen until about 30 years of age. The canals in the dentin are at first wide. With age they are filled by mineral, so that they become invisible and the dentin becomes transparent. It is the most reliable of all criteriaQ.",

Attrition - due to wear and tear from mastication, upper surface of teeth destroyed gradually, first involving the enamel - dentine - pulp (depending on the functional use of teeth and hardness of enamel). 2. Paradentosis - recession of gums and periodontal tissue surrounding the teeth, exposing the neck and adjacent part of root - teeth fall off (poor hygiene increases paradentosis). 3. Secondary dentine formation - develop within the pulp cavity and decrease size of the cavity, start from base - apex, obliterate the cavity, increase with age, caries and paradentosis. 4. Cementum apposition - near the end of root, increase cementum, increase thickness, deposited throughout life, and form incremental lines (devised by Boyde). 5. Root resorption - because of cementum and dentine, absorption of root start at apex and extend upward (may be pathological). 6. Transparency of the root - seen after 30 years of age, canal in the dentine at first widen, increase with age because of deposition of minerals. They become invisible and dentine becomes transparent (Most reliable of all the criteria). Mile's method: Age can be known by changes of root transparency. C) Boyde' method: On enamel of the tooth, there is a line at birth (neonatal line). With increase in age, more lines are added, study of which helps in age determination. D) Stack's method: Age of infant can be known from height and weight of erupting teeth.",
