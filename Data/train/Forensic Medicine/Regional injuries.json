They are secondary to raised intracranial pressure with formation of a transtentorial pressure cone involving the cerebral peduncles (crus cerebri) and other midbrain structures caused by raised pressure above the tentorium. Kernohan's notch is a groove in the cerebral peduncle that may be caused by this displacement of the brainstem against the incisura of the tentorium. The resulting ipsilateral hemiparesis is a false localizing sign, known as the Kernohan-Woltman syndrome. This may succeed or accompany temporal lobe (uncal) herniation and subfalcian herniation secondary to a supratentorial mass. The common causes are an acute haematoma, oedema following trauma, abscess, or tumour. The Duret haemorrhage is demonstrated at CT or MRI. It usually indicates a fatal outcome. The mechanism is uncertain, but is probably caused by the displacement of the brainstem stretching and lacerating pontine perforating branches of the basilar artery.",
