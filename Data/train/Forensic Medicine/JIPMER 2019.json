EMBALMING: THANATOPRAXIA * It is the treatment of the dead body with antiseptics and preservatives to stop putrefaction and preserve the body. * Embalming a body within 6 hoursQ - satisfactory result. * It produces a chemical stiffeningQ similar to rigor mois. * Embalming rigidity is permanent and Normal rigor does not occurQ. Constituents of a typical embalming fluid * Preservative - Commonly a mixture of formaldehyde, glu!taraldehyde. Methanol is used to hold the formaldehyde in solution. * Germicide - Phenol * Humectant (to preserve the moisture) - Glycerine * Buffer (to maintain the pH) - Sodium borate/sodium bicar!bonate. * Anticoagulants-Sodium citrate/sodium oxalate * Dyes (to restore the body's natural colouration) - eosin * + Perfume - wintergreen * Vehicle - water upto 10 L Note: Ethanol is not a constituent of embalming fluid. Injection types: * Aerial injection is preferred* It is forcing of fluid in an aery to reach the tissues through the aerioles and capillaries. * Diffusion occurs into the cells and ti sues for preservation at the capillary level.* For overcoming the clots & better perfusion in aerial injection, High pressure with low flow is preffered. Methods of Injection * Continuous injection & drainage * Continuous injection and disrupted drainage * Alternate injection and drainage * Discontinuous injection and drainage - Best method of injection",
