Burtonian line (stippled blue line) is seen on the gums on upper jaw. Colic abdominal pain and constipation (dry belly ache): is a late manifestation. Encephalopathy is more in children and in poisoning with tetraethyl lead. Paralysis in the form of wrist and foot drop is a late manifestation, called lead palsy and is due to peripheralneuropathy. It occurs only in less than 10% of cases. Renovascular manifestations (nephropathy): Hypertension, arteriolar degeneration and arterioscleroticnephritis may occur. Rarely, lead poisoning may cause proximal tubular necrosis. Other features include optic atrophy, CVS and reproductive anomalies.",
