Cyanide is released from natural substances in some foods and in ceain plants such as cassava, linseed plant, lima beans and almonds, apricots, apples, and peaches Cyanide inhibits Cytochrome oxidase leading to histotoxic Anoxia Signs and Symptoms: C.N.S.: Headache, veigo, faintness, perspiration, anxiety, excitement, confusion, drowsiness, prostration, opisthotonus and trismus, cramps, twitching, hypehermia, convulsions, paralysis, stupor, coma, and death. G.I.T.: Bitter, acid, burning taste, constriction or numbness of throat, salivation, nausea, rarely vomiting. R.S.: Odour of bitter almonds in breath. Initially tachypnoea and dyspnoea due to cyanide stimulation of chemoreceptors and the respiratory centre. Later rapid slowing of respiratory rate with severe respiratory depression and cyanosis. Frothy discharge from mouth C.V.S.: Initially hypeension with reflex bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia. Later tachycardia with hypotension and cardiovascular collapse. Skin: Perspiration, bullae. Pink coloured skin and mucosa Eyes: Glassy and prominent, pupils dilated, unreactive. Renal: Acidosis. Death occurs from respiratory failure. Fatal Period: 2 to 10 minutes; sometimes immediate. Potassium or sodium cyanide: half an hour. The patient may survive for several hours due to delayed absorption. Management - Lilly's antidote Vit.
