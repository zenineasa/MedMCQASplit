        "exp": "Ans. is 'A' i. e., Dark brown Florence Test It is the chemical test for identification of semen in stains. The satin is extracted by 10% HCl and drop is placed on the glass slide and allowed to dry. A cover slip is placed over this and a drop of Florence solution (Potassium iodide, iodine and water) is allowed to run under the cover slip. If semen is present dark brown crystals of choline iodide appear immediately. They are rhombic or needle shaped crystals resembling haemin but are larger and arranged in clusters, rosettes, crosses etc. Choline originates from the seminal vesicles. Positive test is not a proof of seminal fluid, but only the presence of some vegetable or animal substance. A negative reaction is a proof that the stain is not seminal.",

Head and neck findings Stigmata of chronic alcoholism (e. g., flushed facies, vascular spider angiomata) may be present. - Paralysis of extraocular muscles and nystagmus may indicate Wernicke encephalopathy or other intracerebral processes. Chest findings in alcohol withdrawal - Tachypnea is expected during alcohol withdrawal, but dyspnea is not expected. Cardiac findings - Tachycardia and hypertension are common and expected during alcohol withdrawal. Abdominal findings - Stigmata of chronic alcoholism include caput medusae, ascites, and hepatomegaly. CNS findings - Alcohol withdrawal results in a progressive sequence of increasing anxiety, agitation, confusion, disorientation, - visual and auditory hallucinations, seizures, dysphoria, panic, and potentially violent attacks on others. Dysphoria due to opioid withdrawal may also promote negative reactions and possible violence in affected patients but are not associated with delirium. - Cranial-nerve deficits may indicate wernicke's encephalopathy (ocular nerve palsies), intracranial trauma, or bleeding - The essential features are a coarse tremor of the hands, tongue and eyelids with at least one of the above mentioned symptoms.",

        "question": "Pugilistic attitude is seen in: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Burns The burnt body presents the so called attitude of defense, known as boxing attitude, pugilistic attitude or fenching posture Terminology commonly discussed in relation with thermal injuries in forensic pathology: 1. Cherry red lividity In individuals with a significant carboxyhemoglobin concentration in the blood (due to carbon monoxide exposure), the livor mois has a distinctive, bright, cherry red color. The affinity of carbon monoxide to bind to hemoglobin is 200-250% that of oxygen. Cyanide may also produce a bright red coloration of the blood and muscles of the body and has a characteristic bitter almond smell. 2. Epidural hematoma In burned bodies, epidural hematoma results from blood and marrow in the cancellous diploe of the skull boiling and being extruded by the intense heat, resulting in a brown, granular, and at times foamy or dried and flaky deposit in the epidural space. This is also a postmoem heat-related aifact and is easily distinguished from an antemoem epidural hematoma by the difference in color and texture. Fuhermore, antemoem hematomas are often associated with linear skull fractures, with injury to the middle meningeal aery. 3. Fire fractures Fire fractures are another postmoem heat-related aifact and should not be confused with antemoem injuries. Because of the extreme heat, the muscle, tendons, and soft tissue are charred, resulting in exposure of the underlying bones to heat, with resultant heat-induced fractures. Skull fractures are usually seen on the temporal bones, often radiating from a central point. The fractured edges are ragged and may cross suture lines, unlike antemoem fractures that usually terminate at suture lines. Additionally, these fractures may be of paial thickness, with exposure of the cancellous layer. 4. Lichtenberg figure, ferning, keraunopathy Keraunopathy is most generally the study of lightning-related injury, and the term is also used occasionally as synonymous with ferning, the arborizing pattern of skin discoloration seen on some bodies after a lightning strike. The finding can be seen on both living individuals surviving a lightning strike and those dying of it. The Lichtenberg figure is another term for this same finding. Lichtenberg figures, or ferning, on the human body can be transient, lasting hours to days, and their cause remains unclear. 5. Pugilistic attitude The burned body assumes what appears to be a boxer's stance. This is a postmoem aifact resulting from the effects of heat on the muscle protein: denaturation and dehydration. The flexors are bulkier than the extensors, and hence, the overall effect is one of contractures, with flexion at the elbows, wrists and knees. Often the joint spaces are exposed and the aiculating surfaces of the bones are charred. Pugilistic attitude as a result of heat-related contractures. In fire-related deaths, heat-induced contractures result in exposure of the peripheral joint spaces, with charring of the aiculating surface of the bones. 6. Skin splits Skin splits are usually seen on or near joint surfaces, the extensor surfaces of the extremities, and the head. These splits can extend to the underlying adipose and skeletal muscle, dependent on the intensity of the heat. These are also a postmoem aifact. The muscles split parallel to the long axes of the myofibers rather than across them. The soft-tissue splits may be full thickness, paicularly on the abdomen, resulting in charring of the exposed bowel surface. Skin and subcutaneous splits due to intense heat. 7. Soot Soot is an amorphous black material found in the airways (mouth, nares, trachea, bronchi) of individuals inhaling smoke during a fire. Its presence in the airways at autopsy indicates that the decedent was breathing and thus alive during the fire.",

        "question": "Following is not true about adipocere formation?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., It is developed in presence of air Adipocere formation (saponification). Adipocere is a modification of putrefaction, which occurs in the absence of air. That is when there is excessive moisture (humidity) and warnth (warm temperature), but absence of air i. e. warm humid climate, normal putrefaction does not occur, rather saponification occurs. Thus adipocese formation occurs in dead bodies which are lying in water (immered in water) or burned in damp lay soil. Saponification (adipocer formation) is the conversion of dead body into soft, fatty waxy substance due to conversion of unsaturated liquid fats to saturated solid fats under the influence of intrinsic lipase and lecithinase produced by Cl. perfringens. The process involves gradual hydrolysis and hydrogenation of body fats into higher fatty acids which combine with calcium and ammonium ions to form insoluble soaps. Ultimately, palmitic, oleic, stearic and hydroxystearic acids are formed, mixture of these is known as adipocere. Adipocere formation stas in subcutaneous fat and is marked in areas having excessive fat, eg. cheeks, female breast, buttocks and abdomen. Slowly the whole body including muscles and internal viscera change into adipocere. Adipocere has offensive or sweetish smell, however in early stages, smell is ammonical. Body is conveed into soft, waxy and brittle substance, it floats on water, it can be cut easily, it dissolves in alcohol and ethers, and it melts on heating. Facial features and injuries on body are well preserved, thus identfication of body and determination cause of death (in case of injury) are possible. Normally adipocere formation requires 3 weeks to upto 3 to 6 months. However shoest recorded period in india is 3 days 22 hours. In india, it has been observed to begin within 4-5 days. Adipocere may persist for years or decades. Adipocere does not occur in foetus less than 7 month's.

Somatic death (systemic death or clinical death) It is the complete and irreversible stoppage of the circulation, respiration and brain functions (bishop's tripod of life). Somatic death is associated with immediate signs of death:? Permanent and complete cessation of function of brain and flat electric EEG with no response to external stimuli; i. e. brain death. Permanent and complete cessation of function of hea and flat ECG. Permanent and complete cessation of function of lungs. Somatic death is due to stopped aerobic processes. However, anaerobic enzymatic processes are still continuing, hence (i) muscles still respond to mechanical, electrical and thermal stimuli, (ii) pupils still respond to miotics and mydriatics. Molecular death (cellular death) It occurs after somatic death. It refers to death of all individual cells. It occurs when even anaerobic processes stop, due to non availability of ATP. At this stage: Muscles do not respond to stimuli. Pupils do not respond to stimuli or drugs. There are early signs and late signs of death: Early signs: Changes in skin and eye, cooling of the body, post-moem lividity, changes in muscles (e. g. primary relaxation, rigor mois). Late signs: Decomposition (putrefaction), adipocere fromation and mummification. 4.

Summon Summon is a legal document compelling attendance of a witness in a cou of law under penalty, on a paicular day, time and place, for the purpose of giving evidence. It is issued by the Cou in writting, in duplicate, signed by presiding officer of cou and bears the seal of the cou. Conduct money refers to the travelling and daily expences to reach the cou. In civil cases, it is paid by the pay calling him, at the time of serving the summon. Judge decides the conduct money in civil case. The summon in civil case can be ignored if conduct money is not sanctioned or if the amount is less, and the witness can bring the fact to notice of judge. In criminal cases, no money is paid along with summon. The witness can ask for it, after giving evidence, but he should not insist if the cou is not willing to sanction, since otherwise he can be charged for contempt of cou. To an independent doctor it is always paid (known as bhatta), while the doctor in government service, can claim from his office. In case, two or more summons are received for the same date and time, the principles for preference of summon are: Criminal case is preferred over civil case. If both cases are criminal/civil, summon from higher cou is preferred. If both cases are criminal/civil and from cou of same status, summon received earlier is preferred.

D: Datura poisoning If the patient has bilateral pinpoint pupils consider the following possible etiologies: Opiate use/abuse/overdose such as Heroin, Fentanyl, Codeine, Methadone and Morphine stimulate the parasympathetic side of the autonomic nervous system and cause pupil constriction. Miosis in combination with depressed respirations are the hallmark signs of opiate overdose. Pontine Hemorrhage The pons is a knob-like structure located at the front of the brainstem. Intracranial hemorrhage in the area of the pons will typically cause bilateral pupil constriction. Intracranial hemorrhage can have both traumatic and atraumatic origins. Consider pontine hemorrhage in the presence of high mechanism head trauma and patients with a history of vascular disease, strokes and abnormal bleeding. Organophosphate / Chemical / Nerve Agent Exposure Organophosphate chemicals are the most common chemicals causing parasympathetic over-stimulation and, therefore, pinpoint pupils. These compounds are effective pesticides used in agriculture. They are widely used because they break down easily in the environment unlike their cousin DDT. Malathion and parathion are examples of organophosphate pesticides. These chemicals kill insects by disrupting their nervous system function. They can be absorbed through the skin, inhaled and ingested. Once absorbed they shut down acetylcholiesterase production and put the parasympathetic system into overdrive. This will create the classic SLUDGE presentation, characterized by excessive salivation, lacrimation (tears), urination, defecation and emesis. And two other telltale signs muscle cramps and pinpoint pupils. Pupils are widely dilated with loss of accommodation for near vision is seen in datura poisoning.",

Kinetic energy i. e. E = me /2 The kinetic energy is directly propoional to weight (mass) of the bullet and the square of its velocity. Thus a bullet traveling at twice the speed of a second bullet of equal weight and similar size and shape, possesses four times much energy and injuring power. Tissue density- The greater the tissue density, the greater is the amount of energy discharged by the bullet passing through it and thus greater the injury. Thus a bullet may cause slight damage to the soft tissue, but extensive damage to hard tissue such as bone. Hydrostatic force- Hydrostatic forces increase the impact of injury. When fluid distended hollow organs, (e. g. urine filled bladder, filled stomach, hea filled with blood in diastole) are hit by a bullet, extensive lacerations are produced due to the explosive displacement of the liquid in all directions.",

Indian Journal of Experimental Biology; 34: 384-386, methodscollectionpreservationdna. htm DNA Fingerprinting technique, introduced by Prof. Alec Jeffrey's is widely used presently all over the globe especially for forensic purposes. All living things are composed of different cells and within the cells except red blood cells and few other minor types contain a chemical component called Nucleus. And within the nucleus of each cell is located a genetic material, referred as Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). It is this genetic material which generates genetic pattern of an individual and has shown highly polymorphic among individuals. COMMON BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES ENCOUNTERED: Whole Fresh Blood Blood Stain Seminal Stain Hard Tissues (Bones) Soft Tissues (body organs) Hair METHODS OF COLLECTION: Whole blood Sample: Sterile needle should be used while withdrawing or collecting blood. Blood stain: Should be picked up preferably on sterile cotton gauge using sterile forceps and blade. Seminal stain: Should not be touched by hand especially the stain poion. Should be picked up with sterile forceps. Hard Tissues: Bones-bones should be picked up using gloves, Kept at a place where there are no chances of environmental contamination. It should be allowed to dry completely. Soft Tissues: Body organs should be collected using forces and wearing gloves. It should be kept in a sterile container. Hair: Hair roots are preferred for the analysis. Hair roots should be picked up using sterile forceps. PRESERVATION: Whole Blood: Blood should be collected in sterile container containing an anticoagulant. The mostly preferred is EDTA. It should be mixed properly but gently for some time. The container should be covered with parafilm to avoid slippage. Should be kept it at 4degC or using ice during transpoation till it reaches laboratory for analysis. Blood stain: Blood stain should be dried properly. In semi dry stain there, is a possibility of bacterial growth thus chances of having contamination. Drying should be avoided using electric fans. After complete drying it should be wrapped in a fresh blotting paper and packed in a Zip lock poly bag. No preservative is required. It can be transpoed at environmental temperature. Seminal stain: Likewise seminal stain should also be dried properly. In semi dry stain there, is a possibility of bacterial growth thus chances of having contamination. It should not be dried using electric fans. After drying it should be wrapped in a fresh blotting paper and packed in a Zip lock poly bag. No preservative is required. It can be transpoed at environmental temperature. Hard Tissue: No preservative is required. The hard tissues should be wrapped in the blotting paper and placed in a zip lock poly bag. Soft tissue: It should be placed at 4degC or in Ice till it reaches laboratory for analysis. Hair: Hair roots should be placed in a blotting paper and then packed in a zip lock poly bag.

Ivphics / Calton system / Finger prints Finger prints are present from bih both on epidermis and dermis, remain constant through out life and can't be altered without destroying true skin. Finger print pattern is absolutely individual i. e. no two hands are entirely alike, not even identical twins. That's why, it is best (most sensitive and most specific) and most reliable method of identification (Quetelet's rule of biological variation). DNA finger printing may be same in monozygotic twins. The pattern is neither inherited nor identical in any two persons. So the paternity cannot be proved through finger print patterns. However, paternity can be proved by DNA finger printing. Loops (67% most common) > whorls (25%) > arches (7%) > composite (2% least common) are four main types of pattern. It is accepted that chances of 2 finger prints matching 16 ridge characteristic are infinitely small (Parikh's). In practice 8 - 16 (Reddy) / 16 - 20 (Seth, Simpson) points of fine comparision are accepted as proof of identity. Locard's poroscopy method is study of microscopic pores, formed by mouths of ducts of subepidermal sweat gland present on ridges of fingers. These pores are permanent, remain un changed during life and are very useful when only fragments offingerprints are available. Each milimeter contains 9 - 18 pores. Criminals may attempt to multilate finger prints by applying CO2 snow, corrosive agents, burns or eroding against hard surface. But these manners do not destroy finger prints permanently unless true skin is completely destroyed.",

The methods used are:? A) Gustafson's method: Useful only in persons older than 21 years of age, depending on the physiological changes in each of the dental tissues. Attrition - due to wear and tear from mastication, upper surface of teeth destroyed gradually, first involving the enamel - dentine - pulp (depending on the functional use of teeth and hardness of enamel). Paradentosis - recession of gums and periodontal tissue surrounding the teeth, exposing the neck and adjacent pa of root - teeth fall off (poor hygiene increases paradentosis). Secondary dentine formation - develop within the pulp cavity and decrease size of the cavity, sta from base - apex, obliterate the cavity, increase with age, caries and paradentosis. Cementum apposition - near the end of root, increase cementum, increase thickness, deposited throughout life, and form incremental lines (devised by Boyde). Root resorption - because of cementum and dentine, absorption of root sta at apex and extend upward (may be pathological). Transparency of the root - seen after 30 years of age, canal in the dentine at first widen, increase with age because of deposition of minerals. They become invisible and dentine becomes transparent (Most reliable of all the criteria). B) Mile's method: Age can be known by changes of root transparency. Q Boyde' method: On enamel of the tooth, there is a line at bih (neonatal line). With increase in age, more lines are added, study of which helps in age determination. D) Stack's method: Age of infant can be known from height and weight of erupting teeth.",

Primary impact injuries (the first pa struck) - These injuries are caused by the first impact between the vehicle and the pedestrian. 2. Secondary impact injuries (fuher injuries by the same vehicle) - These injuries are d/t subsequent impact with the same vehicle, for eg. the pedestrian may be lifted on to the vehicle after the initial impact. 3. Secondary injuries (sometimes also called teiary injuries) - These are the injuries caused d/t the victim falling on the ground or other stationary object. In primary impact injuries, the site and nature of injuries depend on the height of the pedestrian and upon the position of the person in relation to the vehicle when struck, i. e. whether crossing the road from one side to the other walking with or against the traffic. The injuries also depend upon the relative heights of various pas of the vehicle, i. e. bumper, radiator, fenders. In a typical case, the victim is struck by the front of the vehicle. An adult usually sustains injuries on the legs and a child on the head. Fracture of the tibia and, fibula of one or both legs is k/a bumper fracture. - The fracture is usually spiral or wedge shaped. The base of the triangular fragment of bone indicates the site of the impact and the apex points in the direction in which the vehicle was travelling. - In a bumber fracture, the distance from the heel to the, fracture sire gives information regarding height of the bumper and whether brakes were applied or not. When brakes are applied before the accident, the legs are injured at a lower level. (The. front bumber tends to rise during acceleration and dip under braking. If the pedestrian is hit from the side, there may be unilateral fracture of the nearest leg. If the pedestrian is facing the vehicle. he may sustain intra-abdominal injuries and/or injuries to the chest wall and thoracic contents. Sometimes the pelvis is fractured.",

Atypical drowning It refers to drowning in which even after submersion of body in water, little or no water anters respiratory passages and lungs. Hence typical findings of wet drowning in the form of froth and oedema aquosun: of lungs are not found. Atypical drowning may be: Dry drowning: On contact with water, especially cold water, there results intense laryngospasm, so that water does not enter the lungs. Death is due to asphyxia because of laryngospasm. Immersion syndrome (hydrocution/submersion inhibition/vagal inhibition): Sudden death occurs due to vagal inhibition as a result of (a) sudden impact with cold water, (b) duck diving (falling in water with feet first), and (c) horizontal entry in water with impact on epigastrium. Submersion of unconscious: If person is unconscious since before submersion in water, little or no water enters respiratory passages. It may occur in MI, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, epilepsy, cerebral aneurysm and in drunk state. Near drowning (secondary drowning syndrome/post immersion syndrome): In this drowning is survived and death occurs at a later stage after removal from water. Either the person himself comes out of water or he is recovered alive, but due to complications of submersion, he dies at a later stage. It is due to hypoxic encephalopathy and fibrosing alveolitis. The death occurs due to combined effect of cerebral hypoxia, pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonitis, electrolyte disturbances and metabolic acidosis.",

        "question": "Incised looking laceration is seen at?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Forehead LACERATIONS (Tear or Rupture) Lacerations are tears or splits of skin, mucous membrane and underlying tissue (e. g., muscle or internal organs). Lacerations are produced by application of blunt force to broad area of the body, which crush or stretch tissues beyond the limits of their elasticity. Localized poions of tissue are displaced by the impact of the blunt force, which sets up traction forces and causes tearing of tissues. Features of lacerations are:? i) Hair and hair bulb, nerves and blood vessels are crushed - There may be paralysis (nerve crushed) and hemorrhage is not pronounced (blood vessels crushed). ii) Site of injury is the site of impact. iii) Shape of injury is irregular, margins are irregular and contused/abraded and show tags of tissue. iv) Size of injury does not corresponds to impacting surface. There are following types of laceration:? 1) Split laceration: Splitting occurs by crushing of skin between two hard objects. Blunt force on areas where the skin is close to rigid structures like bone with scanty subcutaneous tissue, may produce a wound that by linear splitting of tissue may look like incised wound, i. e., incised like or incised looking wound. Examples of such area are scalp, eye brows, cheek bones (zygomatic), lower jaw, iliac crest, perineum and skin. A wound produced by a fall on knee or elbow with limb flexed and by a sharp stone also simulates incised wound. 2) Strech lacerations: Overstretching of the skin, if it is fixed, will cause laceration, for example, by kicking, sudden deformity of bone occurs after fracture, making it compound. 3) Avulsion (shearing laceration): An avulsion is a laceration produced by sufficient force (shearing force) delivered at an acute angle to detach (tear off) a poion of a traumatized surface or viscus from its attachment, the shearing and grinding force by a weight. Flaying is type of avulsion in which shearing and grinding force by weight (such as of lorry wheel passing over a limb) may produce avulsion (separation of skin from underlying tissue/degloving of a large area). 4) ears: Tears of the skin and tissues can occur from imact by a against irregular or semi-sharp objects, such as door handle of a car. This is another form of overstretching. 5) Cut laceration: Cut lacerations may be produced by a heavy sharp edged instrument.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Secondary injury Pedestrian injuries Following patterns of injuries are seen:? 1) Primary impact injuries: It is caused due to initial impact between vehicle and pedestrian. The height of the pedestrian often determines the site of impact and injuries, for example, they are usually found on head in children and on the trunk and legs in adults. Overall, the most common site is leg (85%), followed by head (50-80%) > arms > pelvis > chest or abdomen > neck and spine. 2) Secondary impact injuries: These are due to subsequent impact with the same vehicle, as may result from being lifted on to the vehicle after the initial impact:- Secondary impact injuries are also usually seen on the same side as the primary impact injuries (side facing the vehicle) when the body is thrown on the vehicle although they may be seen on other surfaces such as during ran over injuries. If the initial impact was below the centre of gravity (as occurs in adult and older child), it tends to lift the victim up onto bonnet/hood of vehicle (scooping up) or even on road behind the vehicle and cause severe head injuries, laceration (due to secondary impact or contact with windshield) and run over by passing vehicle. If the initial point of impact was at or above the centre of gravity (as occurs in children), he is directly thrown to ground (due to primary impact) and is run over by same car with consequent secondary impact under carriage injuries which may include burns from hot exhaust pipe and stains from grease oil etc. 3) Secondary injuries: These are caused by person violently falling on ground or on stationary object. These are found on pas opposite to primary impact or on head. Injuries due to contact with ground include abrasion and bruises over the face, hand, hips and legs, and laceration over the bony prominences. 4) Rolling/Runover (degloving injuries): Caused by wheel of vehicle or rolling over the victim.

        "question": "If the hemoglobin is saturated with carbon monoxide, the hypoxia involved will be: March 2007",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Anaemic hypoxia When carbon monoxide is inhaled, it takes the place of oxygen in hemoglobin Levels of carbon monoxide bound in the blood can be determined by measuring carboxyhemoglobin, which is a stable complex of carbon monoxide and hemoglobin. The affinity between carbon monoxide and hemoglobin is 240 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen. CO binds to hemoglobin, producing carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. This inhibits the transpo, delivery, and utilization of oxygen. This causes hemoglobin to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. Levels of oxygen available for tissue use are decreased. This situation is described as CO shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Blood oxygen content is actually increased in the case of carbon monoxide poisoning; because all the oxygen is in the blood, none is being given to the tissues, and this causes anemic hypoxic. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin (reducing oxygen transpoation), myoglobin (decreasing its oxygen storage capacity), and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (inhibiting cellular respiration). Hallmark pathological change following CO poisoning is bilateral necrosis of the pallidum. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when conveed to carboxyhemoglobin, so a casualty of CO poisoning is described as looking pink-cheeked and healthy. The main medical treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning is breathing 100% oxygen.",

        "question": "Most common organ affected in underwater blast?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Intestine The most common organ affected in underwater blast injury is intestine. Explosion injury An explosion is a phenomenon resulting from sudden release of energy which is then dissipated by a blast wave, by translocation of objects, or by the generation of heat. Injuries in explosion occur due to four factors:? 1) Blast or shock wave When an explosion occurs, the explosive material produces a large volume of gas and releases a large amount of energy. It produces a 'shock wave' which spread concentrically from the site of explosion. The injuries depend on the enviornment in which blast occurs:- Air blast (most common): Explosion occurs in air. There is barotrauma to air filled hollow organs. Tympanic membrane (ear drum) is most sensitive and most commonly injured. Lung is the second organ to be injured and is the most commonly injured hollow organ and most common cause of life threatening injury. Other pas injured are middle ear, cochlea, eyes, bowels, mesentery, omentum and brain. Homogenous solid organs like liver and muscles are usually not affected. Under water blast (explosion under water): Gastrointestinal tract is injured most commonly. Lungs are also injured. Solid blast: Explosive is detonated near a rigid/solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place. The injuries are mostly skeletal; fracture of legs and veebral column are more common. GIT damage is more common than lung. 2) Flame or hot gases Burns or burning of body may occur. 3) Flying missiles (debris) Flying pieces of explosive debris may be driven through air against the skin causing bruises, abrasions, lacerations, and ragged perforations. 4) Anoxia Various gases liberated during explosion may cause anoxia, e. g. carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, HCN and SO,.",

C: Edges of the wound does not gape Postmoem injury can come from various sources such as deliberate mutilation of a body by a murderer following a homicide, predation by wild animals, or careless handling in the mouary. After death, the blood stays liquid in the vessels and no longer clots. Careless handling of a cadaver may produce some post-moem bruising which may need to be distinguished from antemoem bruising. Postmoem injuries can cause confusion over the manner and cause of death. Impoant findings in postmoem wounds are: No signs of bleeding. While the person is still alive, the blood is circulating and any injuries such as cuts or stabs will bleed and signs of spuing may be seen on the body or clothes. After death, the body usually does not bleed. The edges in postmoem wounds will not gape There will be no clot or a soft clot Diminished/ absent enzyme activity.",

Technically, joule burn is an endogenous burn, i. e. burns produced due to release of heat from the body, on application of electric current. Electric burns may be of following types:? 1) Contact burns: Due to contact with live wire. 2) Spark burns: Due to sparking of current, e. g. in loose electrical fitting. 3) Flash burns: Caused on being near the main power line, without actual contact. Burns result due to arcing of current from these lines. Characteristic features of electric burns are:? 1) There may be holes in clothes or shoes. 2) There is a wound of entry and wound of exit of electric current:- Entry wound: It is non-bleeding, thick, leathery, greyish white, depressed, hard and cauliflower like, known as crater formation. High voltage current may cause burns over large areas of skin, i. e. crocodile skin lesions. The skin may get coloured due to metallic pigment: green (in brass electrode), black (in iron electrode), blue (in copper electrode) and grey (in aluminium electrode). Exit wound: It is like a laceration and is bleeding. 3) Metals from electrode may melt and as small balls (current pearls) may be carried to tissue. Calcium phosphate of bones may also melt and is radiologically seen as bone pearls (wax dripping). 4) Muscles show Zenker's degeneration. Causes of death Commonest cause of death is ventricular fibrillation. Other causes include shock, cardiopulmonary arrest, cerebral anoxia, paralysis of respiratory muscles, and mechanical injuries due to fall.",

Depending on temperature and other conditions, rigor mois lasts approximately 24- 48 hours in winter and 18-36 hours in summer. The phenomenon is caused by the skeletal muscles paially contracting. The muscles are unable to relax, so the joints become fixed in place Rigor mois can be used to help estimate time of death. The onset of rigor mois may range from 1-2 hours, depending on factors including temperature (rapid cooling of a body can inhibit rigor mois, but it occurs upon thawing). Maximum stiffness is reached around 12-24 hours post moem. It first stas in involuntary muscles (myocardium) Eyelids, neck and jaw muscles are affected first, with the rigor then spreading to other pas of the body.

Yellow (cerbera thevetia): Active principles are three glycosides: Thevetin, thevotoxin and cerberin. Conjunctivae are yellow in picric acid poisoning Corneal ulceration and conjunctival inflammation occurs in copper duct exposure. Conjunctiva and cornea are grey-blue or blue black in chronic silver poisoning. Marqui's test is used in morphine poisoning. A normal GIT rules out poisoning by corrosives (acids and alkalies).

        "exp": "Ans. is d i. e., Avulsion Types of abrasion are:? 1) Scratches (linear abrasion): It is an abrasion with legnth but no significant width produced by a sharp object e. g., pin, needles, knife, thorn and nail etc. Point scratch is a very superficial incision produced by a sharp or pointed object not sharp enough to incise but pointed enough to produce scratch. 2) Grazes (Sliding abrasion/scraping abrasion/grinding abrasion): It is the most common type of abrasion, produced when a broad surface of skin slides against rough surface, e. g., during vehicular accidents. Injury is due to friction. The surface of injury show irregular parallel lines, i. e., furrows or grooves. A violent lateral graze, due to rubbing of skin (as in dragging) is known as brush burn (Gravel rash). Friction burn (Scuff or brush abrasion) occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface or when the skin is covered by clothing. It is an extensive superficial, reddened excoriated area without bleeding and with little or no linear mark. 3) Pressure abrasions (crushing or friction abrasions): Though it is called friction abrasion, it results from pressure of the object on the body with no or little friction (it is a misnomer). It is caused by crushing of superficial epidermis due to inward directed movement of object at around 90deg to skin. Example are ligature marks in hanging/strangulation, teeth bites and nail marks. 4) Impact abrasion (Imprint or contact abrasion): It is caused by impact (but not pressure) with a rough object, when the force is applied at or near 90deg to skin surface. It is depressed below surface unless associated with contusion (bruise).",
