Rat hole is associated with Bullet injury. \"Intermediate range shotgun wounds: At a distance of 60--90 cm, single irregular circular aperture 4 to 5 cm with irregular and lacerated edges is produced. The shots are scattered after entering the wound and cause much damage to the internal tissues. At a distance of 1. 5 meters, the shot mass enters the body in one mass, producing a round defect. The margins are abraded. At a distance of 2 meters, the shot mass begins to spread.

Yaw ning bullet - It is a bullet traveling in an irregular fashion instead of traveling nose on. Tumbling bullet - It is a bullet that rotates end on end during its motion. Tandem bullet or Piggyback bullet - When unused or old weapon is fired, the bullet may fail to come out from the muzzle but when it is fired again the second bullet may go off carrying the lodged bullet with it and both the bullets may enter the body through the same entrance wound. Duplex or Tandem Catridge - This is used in military rifles and contains 2 bullets which enter the target at different points. Souvenir bullets - These are bullets which are retained in the body for a long time and usually a dense fibrous capsule surrounds it. Dum Dum bullet- Hollow bullets which on impact, breaks down and thus dissipate more force of impact. Gutter wound - Bullets may graze or rubs the top and sides of the cranium without entering it. The affected area of the skull shows an oval or elongated gutter like depression known as the gutter wound.",

RT COLLAR Parikh 6th/4. 44# This is due to the wipe of the soft metal of the bullet, or dirt present on it, or grease carried from the barrel & is deposited round the entrance wound internal to the abraded collar. The smudge ring may therefore be absent when the jacketed bullet has passed through clothing. The smudging in case of lead shot or unjacketed bullets can be detected microchemically on the targetfskin/doth). The forensic value of bullet wipe is to establish a hole as a bullet hole, to determine the entry site, & on occasion the sequence of shots or bullet's passage through multiple objectss. Gutter fracture; They are formed when part of the thickness of the bone is removed so as to form a gutter, e. g., in oblique bullet wound\"- Reddy 33rd/247; 32nd/Z35\"Abrasion coliar (Marginal abrasion): Abrasi on collar surrounds the dirt collar The abraded collar is reddish at first, but becomes reddish brown as it dries. Some contusion is present in abraded collar & as such, it is also called \"contusion collar\". These two features are proof of an entrance fi rearm wound\"- Reddy 32nd/213. FIREARM WOUND Reddy 32nd/205. They are recognized without difficulty. Wounds produced by rifled weapon may simulate wounds inflicated by a red hot poker or a burning pointed stick. Glancing wounds (striking someone or something at an angle rather than directly and with full force) may simulate incised or lacerated wounds. A bullet that pass through glass or some other object & then strikes the body may produce a wound resembling a laceration. Firearm wounds cause crushing of the tissues & produce an actual hole. FIREARM INJURIES Parikh 6th/4. 39-40# Firearm injuries are wounds caused to the body tissue due to impact, entry & passage of a missile discharged from a firearm. They generally simulate contused wounds. When a missile pass tangentially, the wound may simulate an abrasion or a gutter. Slit like exit wounds are occasionally encountered. They are due to the bullet exiting on its board side or due to exit of a fragmented bone. Such injuries may simulate incised wounds or stab wounds",

These secondary individual (or accidental) markings are specific for that particular weapon and used to exclude it from all others (bullet fingerpringing).
