Adulteration with Methanol is done because it is presumed to give the kick effect earlier with a smaller dose. Methanol is cheap and easily available. 2) Methanol as such is not a toxic agent. Methanol is metabolized to formaldehyde (by alcohol dehydrogenase) and then to formic acid (by aldehyde dehydrogenase), and these metabolites of methanol are responsible for retinal toxicity as well as metabolic acidosis. 3) Ethanol or 4 methyl pyrazole (fomepizole) are used for the treatment of methanol poisoning.
