The increase in weight is not constant and is not a reliable indication of breathing. Fodere&;s test: The lung are ligated across their hila and separated. THe average weight of the both lungs before respiration varies from 30g to 40g, and after respiration from 60g to 66g. The increase in weight is due to the increased flow of blood. Raygat's test/hydrostatic test:The hydrostatic test is based on the principle that if the infant has breathed, the lung will float in water. each lung is cut into pieces and tested for floataion in water. A piece of liver is used as control. if the liver bit floats, the test has no meaning, it is clear that putrefaction has set in. If all the pieces of lung float, they are crushed under a weight and tested again. flaotion is positive when the baby has respired. But if the piece sink after pressure, no respiration has taken place. if some piece float while otherb sink, it mean feeble respiration taken place.
