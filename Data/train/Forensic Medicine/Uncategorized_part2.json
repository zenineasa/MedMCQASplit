There is loss of appetite, nausea and intermittent vomiting and diarrhea. Second stage (catarrhal changes) : It resembles common cold, i.e. conjunctivitis, running nose and eyes, coughing etc. Third stage (skin rash) : There is classical 'rain drop pigmentation', i.e. patchy brown pigmentation of skin. At initial stages, there is a vesicular eruption which may resemble nettle rash. Hyperkeratosis of palms and soles occur. There are white transverse bands crossing the nails, known as Mee's line, and indicate periods of arrested growth due to interference with normal metabolism. There is alopecia and exfoliative dermatitis. Fouh stage (nervous disturbances) : There is sensory and motor (i.e. mixed) polyneuropathy, with painful paresthesia of hands and feet and muscle tenderness.",

        "question": "Forced alkaline diuresis is indicated in which of the following: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Phenobarbitone poisoning Forced osmotic diuresis using intravenous chlohiazide and/ or mannitol results in considerable increase in the elimination rate of barbiturates Forced diuresis It is increased urine formation by diuretics and fluid It may enhance the excretion of ceain drugs in urine and is used to treat drug overdose or poisoning of these drugs and hemorrhagic cystitis Most of the drugs are either weak acids or weak bases. When urine is made alkaline, elimination of acidic drugs in the urine is increased. The converse applies for alkaline drugs. This method is only of therapeutic significance where the drug is excreted in active form in urine and where the pH of urine can be adjusted to levels above or below the pK value of the active form of drug. For acidic drugs, urine pH should be above the pK value of that drug, and converse for the basic drugs. It is because the ionization of acidic drug is increased in alkaline urine and ionized drugs cannot easily cross plasma membrane so cannot re-enter blood from kidney tubules. This method is ineffective for drugs which are strongly protein bound (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants) or which have a large apparent volume of distribution (e.g. paracetamol, tricyclic antidepressants). Forced alkaline diuresis has been used to increase the excretion of acidic drugs like salicylates and phenobarbitone, while forced acid diuresis has been used to enhance the elimination of cocaine, amphetamine, quinine, quinidine, strychnine when poisoning by these drugs has occurred. For forced alkaline diuresis, a diuretic like furosemide is given intravenously and sodium bicarbonate is added to the infusion fluid to make blood and, in turn, urine alkaline. Potassium replacement becomes of utmost impoance in this setting because potassium is usually lost in urine. If blood levels of potassium are depleted below normal levels, then hypokalemia occurs, which promotes bicarbonate ion retention and prevents bicarbonate excretion, thus interfering with alkalinization of the urine. For forced acid diuresis, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is used. Ammonium chloride has also been used for forced acid diuresis but it is a toxic compound. Forced alkaline diuresis is also recommended for rhabdomyolysis",

AttritionQ Due to wear and tear from mastication, occlusal (upper) surface of the teeth is destroyed gradually; first involving the enamel, then dentin, and at last, pulp is exposed in the old age. It depends on the functional use of the teeth and also up on the hardness ParadentosisQ Regression of the gums and periodontal tissues surrounding the teeth takes place in the advancing age, gradually exposing the necks and adjacent pas of the roots, due to which the teeth become loose and fall off. Poor oral hygiene increases paradentosis. Secondary DentinQ * It may develop from the walls within the pulp cavity, and decrease the size of the cavity. * First it is deposited at the pulp chamber and gradually extends downwards to the apex, and may completely fill the pulp cavity. Cementum Appositiondeg The cementum increases in thickness paicularly due to changes in the tooth position, especially near the end of the root. Secondary cementum is slowly and continuously deposited throughout life and forms incremental lines. Incremental lines (devised by Boyde) appear as cross-striations on the enamel of teeth due to cementum apposition, and are thought to represent daily increments of growth. They can be seen on histological section. The age can be calculated by counting the number of lines from the neonatal line onwards. This is mainly applicable to infants. This is mainly applicable to infants. Root ResorptionQ It involves both cementum and dentin, which show characteristically sharp grooves. Absorption of the root stas first at the apex and extends upwards. It usually occurs in the late age. It may be due to pathological process. Transparency of the RootQ It is not seen until about 30 years of age. The canals in the dentin are at first wide. With age they are filled by mineral, so that they become invisible and the dentin becomes transparent. It is the most reliable of all criteriaQ.",

The fingerprints are capable of endless variation so that there is one chance in sixty four billions of two persons having identical prints. Dactylography / Dermatoglvphics / Galton system / Finger prints Finger prints are present from bih both on epidermis and dermis, remain constant through out life and can't be altered without destroying true skin. Finger print pattern is absolutely individual i.e. no two hands are entirely alike, not even identical twins. That's why, it is best (most sensitive and most specific) and most reliable method of identification (Quetelet's rule of biological variation). DNA finger printing may be same in monozygotic twins. The pattern is neither inherited nor identical in any two persons. So the paternity cannot be proved through finger print patterns. However, paternity can be proved by DNA finger printing. Loops (67% most common) > whorls (25%) > arches (7%) > composite (2% least common) are four main types of pattern. It is accepted that chances of 2 finger prints matching 16 ridge characteristic are infinitely small (Parikh's). Inpractice 8 - 16 (Reddy) / 16 - 20 (Seth, Simpson) points of fine comparision are accepted as proof of identity. Locard's poroscopy method is study of microscopic pores, formed by mouths of ducts of subepidermal sweatgland present on ridges of fingers. These pores are permanent, remain un changed during life and are very usefulwhen only fragments of fingerprints are available. Each milimeter contains 9 - 18 pores. Criminals may attempt to multilate finger prints by applying CO2 snow, corrosive agents, burns or eroding against hard surface.

Attrition - due to wear and tear from mastication, upper surface of teeth destroyed gradually, first involving the enamel - dentine - pulp (depending on the functional use of teeth and hardness of enamel). 2. Paradentosis - recession of gums and periodontal tissue surrounding the teeth, exposing the neck and adjacent pa of root - teeth fall off (poor hygiene increases paradentosis). 3. Secondary dentine formation - develop within the pulp cavity and decrease size of the cavity, sta from base - apex, obliterate the cavity, increase with age, caries and paradentosis. 4. Cementum apposition - near the end of root, increase cementum, increase thickness, deposited throughout life, and form incremental lines (devised by Boyde). 5. Root resorption - because of cementum and dentine, absorption of root sta at apex and extend upward (may be pathological). 6. Transparency of the root - seen after 30 years of age, canal in the dentine at first widen, increase with age because of deposition of minerals. They become invisible and dentine becomes transparent (Most reliable of all the criteria). B. Mile's method : Age can be known by changes of root transparency. C. Boyde' method : On enamel of the tooth, there is a line at bih (neonatal line). With increase in age, more lines are added, study of which helps in age determination. D.

Phosphorus poisoning Phosphorus is a protoplasmic poison affecting cellular oxidation and causing anoxic necorbiosis, classically affecting liver. It increases fat deposition and inhibits glycogen deposition in liver. It is used in fire works (Diwali poisoning) and as rat poison. Lethal dose is 60-120 mg. Phosphorus occurs in two forms :? 1) White/yellow phosphorus : It is white, and becomes yellow on exposure to air. It is translucent, waxy, luminous and crystalline cylinders. It has garlic like odor. It is insoluble in water and luminous in dark. Its fumes show phosphorescence. 2) Red phosphorus : It is reddish brown, ine, odourless and tasteless. It is nontoxic (thus poisoning occurs only due to white phosphorus). It is put on the sides (striking surface) of match box (along with powdered galss). Acute poisoning It has following stages : i) 1st Stage (GI irritation) : There is nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and garlic odor. This stage lasts for 8 hours to 3 days. ii) 2nd Stage (Asymptomatic) : This stage lasts for 3 days. iii) 3rd Stage : There is liver and kidney damage due to absorbed phosphorus. Initially liver is enlarged due to acute fatty infiltration. Later liver shruks due to necrosis, i.e. acute yellow atrophy. Chronic poisoning Toothache is the first symptom which is associated with loosening of teeth, necrosis of gums and osteomyelitis of jaw. Therefore chronic phosphorus poisoning is also know as phossy jaw (or glass jaw). Postmoem appearance There is garlic odor. Viscera and stool glow in dark (due to luminosity). To preserve luminosity, viscera are preserved in saturated saline solution. Rectified spirit is not used as it causes loss of luminosity.",

Takayama is a crystal test used for the confirmation of the presence of blood on samples. Benzidine test used to confirm the presence of blood - has been discontinued because the reagent is carcinogenic. It has largely been replaced by the Kastle-Meyer test, using a solution of phenolphthalein which turns pink in contact with even small traces of blood. The test works by detecting the presence of the enzyme peroxides in the blood. However, as this substance is also present in other biological materials, the Kastle-Meyer test is regarded as a screening procedure. It is highly sensitive, and positive reaction is judged presumptive of blood, and fuher confirmatory tests are carried out. Once a stain has been confirmed as blood it has to be determined whether it is human or animal. The precipitin test is used for this purpose. The precipitin test is sensitive, and will work on small traces of blood. The test is also known as the Uhlenbuth test. Spectrophotometric analysis of bloodstains allows them to be aged within the range of one day to three weeks. The Luminol test - The Luminol reacts with the iron complex in the blood's hemoglobin to produce a self-luminescence. The bloodstains literally glow in the dark with a faint bluish light.

        "question": "Greenish discoloration of the body first seen in the right iliac fossa after death is due to formation of ?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Sulph - meth hemoglobin Signs of putrefaction The signs and effects of putrefaction are as follows :? 1. Colour changes The earliest sign of decomposition is greenish discoloration of body, seen in right iliac fossa externally and under liver internally. This is due to involvement of caecum. Which contains more liquid and is full of bacteria. In these areas, it appears in 12-18 hours and slowly spreads to whole body in 24-48 hours. Greenish discoloration is due to formation of sulph-meth-haemoglobin. Morbling occurs when Hb dissociates from RBCs and the colour of Hb is taken up by vessels, which are seen as prominent lines having purple or green or brown colour. Marbling occurs in 24-48 hours. 2. Formation of foul smelling gases Due to action of bacteria, foul smelling gases are formed, e.g. SO, , H2S, ammonia, methane and CO2. 3. Effects of gases Bloating up of body occurs in 34-48 hours. At the same time following changes occurs : i) Appearance of stomach contents and froth on nose and mouth. ii) Degloving and destocking with appearance of putrefactive blisters. iii) Emptying of hea due to pressure of gas. In 48-72 hours prolapse of rectum and uterus occur and postmoem delivery may occur if the dead woman is pregnant. Color of postmoem staining also changes to brown and finally to black. False rigidity (putrefactive rigidity) may occur at this time. 4. Appearance of maggots Flies lay their eggs in wounds, exposed natural orifices and exposed moist pas of the body and folds of skin, e.g. neck, axilla, nostrils, mouth etc. Flies lay eggs in 6-12 hours after death and these eggs change in larva (maggot) in 1-2 days. Thus maggots appear in 2-3 days after the death. After fuher 4-5 days, the maggots change into pupa, which conve into adult flies in next 3-5 days. Thus adult flies will be coming out of the body after total 8-12 days of death. Thus appearance of maggot determine the time since death. 5. Other late changes In 3-5 days : Nails and teeth become loose and can be pulled out, sutures of skull may separate. In 7-12 days : Liquefaction of body (colliquative putrefaction) occurs. In 1-3 months : Skeletonization of dead body occurs. Finally : Bones also decompose : Exposed bones in 1-5 years and deep burried bone (> 2 meters) in 25-100 years. 6. Internal changes Liver becomes spongy and is called as foamy or swiss cheese or honeycombed liver. In 7-12 days lequefaction of internal organs occur. 7. Floatation of body (if body is in water) Floatation of body occurs due to occumulation of sufficient putrefactive gases. Abdomen is above (due to gases) and spine is below during floatation. Time required for floatation is ordinarily 24 hours after death in summers and 2-3 days in winter. Factors affecting floatation are :- i) Causing early.floatation : Newborn mature infant, females, in summer, clothed body, obese, in sea water and in still pond water. ii) Causing delayed floatation : Still bih/immature newborn, male, in winter, naked body, thin built, in fresh water and in running stream water. Inspiration and expiration before death has no effect on floatation as floatation is due to putrefactive gases (not due to respiratory air).",

C: Cross examination In stage of direct examination/ examination in chief, no leading questions are allowed except in those cases in which the judge is satisfied that a witness is hostile (hostile witness is one who purposely makes statement contrary to facts) Leading examination are allowed in cross-examination At re-examination, leading questions are not allowed Leading question/ suggestive interrogation It is a question that suggests the answer or contains the information the examiner is looking for. For example, this question is leading: You were at Jacky's bar on the night of July 15, weren't you? It suggests that the witness was at Jacky's bar on the night in question. The same question in a non-leading form would be: Where were you on the night of July 15? This form of question does not suggest to the witness the answer the examiner hopes to elicit. Leading questions may often be answerable with a yes or no (though not all uyes-no questions are leading). Depending on the circumstances leading questions can be objectionable or proper. The propriety of leading questions generally depends on the relationship of the witness to the pay conducting the examination. An examiner may generally ask leading questions of a hostile witness or on cross examination, but not on dire t examination. It is impoant to distinguish between leading questions and loaded questions: questions that are objectionable because they contain implicit assumptions. The classic example is: Have you stopped beating your wife? This type of question is not leading, as it does not suggest that the examiner expects any paicular answer. It is however objectionable because it assumes (among other things) that the witness (1) was married and (2) had in fact beaten his wife in the past, facts which (presumably) have not been established.",

        "exp": "Imprint abrasion Real confusion in this question is between imprint abrasion and patterned bruising. In both imprint abrasion and patterned brusing there is mark or pattern of the object causing injury. Abrasion is caused by friction and/or pressure between the skin and some rough object or surface. For abrasions to occur some movement along with pressure is essential between the object or instrument or weapon and the skin. In abrasions superficial layers of skin are crushed and damaged. Bruises or contusions are caused by blunt trauma resulting in rupture of small blood vessels which lead to effusion of blood in subcutaneous or subepithelial tissues. However skin is intact in most cases until associated with abrasions. In an accident in which victim is overrun by vehicle, there will be movement and friction between the tyre and skin along with pressure by the tyre leading to imprint or patterned abrasion. There can be intradermal bruises also which are usually associated with patterned objects. So the tyre mark will be primarily an imprint or patterned abrasion (tyre has a pattern because of ridges and grooves) associated with bruises too. Also know? Abrasions are of following types Scratches - a linear injury produced by a sharp object, such as a pin, thorn, nail or tip of any sharp weapon. Graze - An injury which is produced when a broad surface of skin slides or scraps against a rough surface. These are the most common type. Commonly seen in road accidents. Violent lateral (tangential) rubbing against a rough surface can produce abrasion known as 'brush burn' or 'gravel rash'. 'Friction burn' can occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface. 3. Patterned abrasions: In it pattern of the object causing injury is produced over the skin when the force is applied at right angle to the surface of the skin. Patterned abrasions are produced either by pressure of the object or by impact with a rough object. The .former is called pressure (crushing or friction) abrasion and the latter is known as impact (contact or imprint) abrasion. There can be associated bruising in the surrounding area. Examples are ligature mark, nail and Muir& mark, teeth bite marks, whip marks, radiator, grill or tyre marks in vehicular accidents and muzzle marks in gunshot injuries.",
