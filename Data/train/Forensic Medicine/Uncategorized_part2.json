Phosphorus poisoning Phosphorus is a protoplasmic poison affecting cellular oxidation and causing anoxic necorbiosis, classically affecting liver. It increases fat deposition and inhibits glycogen deposition in liver. It is used in fire works (Diwali poisoning) and as rat poison. Lethal dose is 60-120 mg. Phosphorus occurs in two forms:? 1) White/yellow phosphorus: It is white, and becomes yellow on exposure to air. It is translucent, waxy, luminous and crystalline cylinders. It has garlic like odor. It is insoluble in water and luminous in dark. Its fumes show phosphorescence. 2) Red phosphorus: It is reddish brown, ine, odourless and tasteless. It is nontoxic (thus poisoning occurs only due to white phosphorus). It is put on the sides (striking surface) of match box (along with powdered galss). Acute poisoning It has following stages: i) 1st Stage (GI irritation): There is nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and garlic odor. This stage lasts for 8 hours to 3 days. ii) 2nd Stage (Asymptomatic): This stage lasts for 3 days. iii) 3rd Stage: There is liver and kidney damage due to absorbed phosphorus. Initially liver is enlarged due to acute fatty infiltration. Later liver shruks due to necrosis, i. e. acute yellow atrophy. Chronic poisoning Toothache is the first symptom which is associated with loosening of teeth, necrosis of gums and osteomyelitis of jaw. Therefore chronic phosphorus poisoning is also know as phossy jaw (or glass jaw). Postmoem appearance There is garlic odor. Viscera and stool glow in dark (due to luminosity). To preserve luminosity, viscera are preserved in saturated saline solution. Rectified spirit is not used as it causes loss of luminosity.",

Takayama is a crystal test used for the confirmation of the presence of blood on samples. Benzidine test used to confirm the presence of blood - has been discontinued because the reagent is carcinogenic. It has largely been replaced by the Kastle-Meyer test, using a solution of phenolphthalein which turns pink in contact with even small traces of blood. The test works by detecting the presence of the enzyme peroxides in the blood. However, as this substance is also present in other biological materials, the Kastle-Meyer test is regarded as a screening procedure. It is highly sensitive, and positive reaction is judged presumptive of blood, and fuher confirmatory tests are carried out. Once a stain has been confirmed as blood it has to be determined whether it is human or animal. The precipitin test is used for this purpose. The precipitin test is sensitive, and will work on small traces of blood. The test is also known as the Uhlenbuth test. Spectrophotometric analysis of bloodstains allows them to be aged within the range of one day to three weeks. The Luminol test - The Luminol reacts with the iron complex in the blood's hemoglobin to produce a self-luminescence. The bloodstains literally glow in the dark with a faint bluish light.

        "question": "Leading questions can be asked in which pa of interrogation: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Cross examination In stage of direct examination/ examination in chief, no leading questions are allowed except in those cases in which the judge is satisfied that a witness is hostile (hostile witness is one who purposely makes statement contrary to facts) Leading examination are allowed in cross-examination At re-examination, leading questions are not allowed Leading question/ suggestive interrogation It is a question that suggests the answer or contains the information the examiner is looking for. For example, this question is leading: You were at Jacky's bar on the night of July 15, weren't you? It suggests that the witness was at Jacky's bar on the night in question. The same question in a non-leading form would be: Where were you on the night of July 15? This form of question does not suggest to the witness the answer the examiner hopes to elicit. Leading questions may often be answerable with a yes or no (though not all uyes-no questions are leading). Depending on the circumstances leading questions can be objectionable or proper. The propriety of leading questions generally depends on the relationship of the witness to the pay conducting the examination. An examiner may generally ask leading questions of a hostile witness or on cross examination, but not on dire t examination. It is impoant to distinguish between leading questions and loaded questions: questions that are objectionable because they contain implicit assumptions. The classic example is: Have you stopped beating your wife? This type of question is not leading, as it does not suggest that the examiner expects any paicular answer. It is however objectionable because it assumes (among other things) that the witness (1) was married and (2) had in fact beaten his wife in the past, facts which (presumably) have not been established.",

Measurements are taken at 4 sites: mid triceps (best site), biceps, subscapular and suprailiac regions. The sum of measurements _ 50 mm in girls and 240 mm in boys indicate obesity. At single mid triceps level (best site to measure SFT), thickness 18 mm in boys and 32 mm in girls indicate obesity. The instrument used to estimate SFT is Harpenden skin callipers. 2) Waist circumference (WC) and Waist / Hip ratio (WHR) These are good predictors for metabolic complications and risk of cardiovascular disease. The cut-off for waist circumference is 102 cms in boys (for India 90 cms) and 88 cms in girls (for India. 80 cms). WHR > 1. 0 in men and > 0. 85 in women indicates obesity and abdominal fat accumulation. 3) Waist-Height ratio (WHtR) It is the best indicator of cardiovascular risk. It is independent of age and sex. Cut-off value is 0. 5. 4) Indices based on weight and/or height These are:? i) Body mass index (Qetelet's index) It is used internationally as reference standard for assessing the prevalence of obesity.

        "exp": "Imprint abrasion Real confusion in this question is between imprint abrasion and patterned bruising. In both imprint abrasion and patterned brusing there is mark or pattern of the object causing injury. Abrasion is caused by friction and/or pressure between the skin and some rough object or surface. For abrasions to occur some movement along with pressure is essential between the object or instrument or weapon and the skin. In abrasions superficial layers of skin are crushed and damaged. Bruises or contusions are caused by blunt trauma resulting in rupture of small blood vessels which lead to effusion of blood in subcutaneous or subepithelial tissues. However skin is intact in most cases until associated with abrasions. In an accident in which victim is overrun by vehicle, there will be movement and friction between the tyre and skin along with pressure by the tyre leading to imprint or patterned abrasion. There can be intradermal bruises also which are usually associated with patterned objects. So the tyre mark will be primarily an imprint or patterned abrasion (tyre has a pattern because of ridges and grooves) associated with bruises too. Also know? Abrasions are of following types Scratches - a linear injury produced by a sharp object, such as a pin, thorn, nail or tip of any sharp weapon. Graze - An injury which is produced when a broad surface of skin slides or scraps against a rough surface. These are the most common type. Commonly seen in road accidents. Violent lateral (tangential) rubbing against a rough surface can produce abrasion known as 'brush burn' or 'gravel rash'. 'Friction burn' can occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface. 3. Patterned abrasions: In it pattern of the object causing injury is produced over the skin when the force is applied at right angle to the surface of the skin. Patterned abrasions are produced either by pressure of the object or by impact with a rough object. The. former is called pressure (crushing or friction) abrasion and the latter is known as impact (contact or imprint) abrasion. There can be associated bruising in the surrounding area. Examples are ligature mark, nail and Muir& mark, teeth bite marks, whip marks, radiator, grill or tyre marks in vehicular accidents and muzzle marks in gunshot injuries.",

There is barotrauma to air filled hollow organs. Tympanic membrane (ear drum) is most sensitive and most commonly injured. Lung is the second organ to be injured and is the most commonly injured hollow organ and most common cause of life threatening injury. Other pas injured are middle ear, cochlea, eyes, bowels, mesentery, omentum and brain. Homogenous solid organs like liver and muscles are usually not affected. Under water blast (explosion under water): Gastrointestinal tract is injured most commonly. Lungs are also injured. Solid blast: Explosive is detonated near a rigid/solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place.

Cardiac findings - Tachycardia and hypertension are common and expected during alcohol withdrawal. Abdominal findings - Stigmata of chronic alcoholism include caput medusae, ascites, and hepatomegaly. CNS findings - Alcohol withdrawal results in a progressive sequence of increasing anxiety, agitation, confusion, disorientation, - visual and auditory hallucinations, seizures, dysphoria, panic, and potentially violent attacks on others. Dysphoria due to opioid withdrawal may also promote negative reactions and possible violence in affected patients but are not associated with delirium. - Cranial-nerve deficits may indicate wernicke's encephalopathy (ocular nerve palsies), intracranial trauma, or bleeding - The essential features are a coarse tremor of the hands, tongue and eyelids with at least one of the above mentioned symptoms.",

Cherry red lividity In individuals with a significant carboxyhemoglobin concentration in the blood (due to carbon monoxide exposure), the livor mois has a distinctive, bright, cherry red color. The affinity of carbon monoxide to bind to hemoglobin is 200-250% that of oxygen. Cyanide may also produce a bright red coloration of the blood and muscles of the body and has a characteristic bitter almond smell. 2. Epidural hematoma In burned bodies, epidural hematoma results from blood and marrow in the cancellous diploe of the skull boiling and being extruded by the intense heat, resulting in a brown, granular, and at times foamy or dried and flaky deposit in the epidural space. This is also a postmoem heat-related aifact and is easily distinguished from an antemoem epidural hematoma by the difference in color and texture. Fuhermore, antemoem hematomas are often associated with linear skull fractures, with injury to the middle meningeal aery. 3. Fire fractures Fire fractures are another postmoem heat-related aifact and should not be confused with antemoem injuries. Because of the extreme heat, the muscle, tendons, and soft tissue are charred, resulting in exposure of the underlying bones to heat, with resultant heat-induced fractures. Skull fractures are usually seen on the temporal bones, often radiating from a central point. The fractured edges are ragged and may cross suture lines, unlike antemoem fractures that usually terminate at suture lines. Additionally, these fractures may be of paial thickness, with exposure of the cancellous layer. 4. Lichtenberg figure, ferning, keraunopathy Keraunopathy is most generally the study of lightning-related injury, and the term is also used occasionally as synonymous with ferning, the arborizing pattern of skin discoloration seen on some bodies after a lightning strike. The finding can be seen on both living individuals surviving a lightning strike and those dying of it. The Lichtenberg figure is another term for this same finding. Lichtenberg figures, or ferning, on the human body can be transient, lasting hours to days, and their cause remains unclear. 5. Pugilistic attitude The burned body assumes what appears to be a boxer's stance. This is a postmoem aifact resulting from the effects of heat on the muscle protein: denaturation and dehydration. The flexors are bulkier than the extensors, and hence, the overall effect is one of contractures, with flexion at the elbows, wrists and knees. Often the joint spaces are exposed and the aiculating surfaces of the bones are charred. Pugilistic attitude as a result of heat-related contractures. In fire-related deaths, heat-induced contractures result in exposure of the peripheral joint spaces, with charring of the aiculating surface of the bones. 6. Skin splits Skin splits are usually seen on or near joint surfaces, the extensor surfaces of the extremities, and the head. These splits can extend to the underlying adipose and skeletal muscle, dependent on the intensity of the heat. These are also a postmoem aifact. The muscles split parallel to the long axes of the myofibers rather than across them. The soft-tissue splits may be full thickness, paicularly on the abdomen, resulting in charring of the exposed bowel surface. Skin and subcutaneous splits due to intense heat. 7. Soot Soot is an amorphous black material found in the airways (mouth, nares, trachea, bronchi) of individuals inhaling smoke during a fire. Its presence in the airways at autopsy indicates that the decedent was breathing and thus alive during the fire.",

Kinetic energy i. e. E = me /2 The kinetic energy is directly propoional to weight (mass) of the bullet and the square of its velocity. Thus a bullet traveling at twice the speed of a second bullet of equal weight and similar size and shape, possesses four times much energy and injuring power. Tissue density- The greater the tissue density, the greater is the amount of energy discharged by the bullet passing through it and thus greater the injury. Thus a bullet may cause slight damage to the soft tissue, but extensive damage to hard tissue such as bone. Hydrostatic force- Hydrostatic forces increase the impact of injury.

Indian Journal of Experimental Biology; 34: 384-386, methodscollectionpreservationdna. htm DNA Fingerprinting technique, introduced by Prof. Alec Jeffrey's is widely used presently all over the globe especially for forensic purposes. All living things are composed of different cells and within the cells except red blood cells and few other minor types contain a chemical component called Nucleus. And within the nucleus of each cell is located a genetic material, referred as Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). It is this genetic material which generates genetic pattern of an individual and has shown highly polymorphic among individuals. COMMON BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES ENCOUNTERED: Whole Fresh Blood Blood Stain Seminal Stain Hard Tissues (Bones) Soft Tissues (body organs) Hair METHODS OF COLLECTION: Whole blood Sample: Sterile needle should be used while withdrawing or collecting blood. Blood stain: Should be picked up preferably on sterile cotton gauge using sterile forceps and blade. Seminal stain: Should not be touched by hand especially the stain poion. Should be picked up with sterile forceps. Hard Tissues: Bones-bones should be picked up using gloves, Kept at a place where there are no chances of environmental contamination. It should be allowed to dry completely. Soft Tissues: Body organs should be collected using forces and wearing gloves. It should be kept in a sterile container. Hair: Hair roots are preferred for the analysis. Hair roots should be picked up using sterile forceps. PRESERVATION: Whole Blood: Blood should be collected in sterile container containing an anticoagulant. The mostly preferred is EDTA. It should be mixed properly but gently for some time. The container should be covered with parafilm to avoid slippage. Should be kept it at 4degC or using ice during transpoation till it reaches laboratory for analysis. Blood stain: Blood stain should be dried properly. In semi dry stain there, is a possibility of bacterial growth thus chances of having contamination. Drying should be avoided using electric fans. After complete drying it should be wrapped in a fresh blotting paper and packed in a Zip lock poly bag. No preservative is required. It can be transpoed at environmental temperature. Seminal stain: Likewise seminal stain should also be dried properly. In semi dry stain there, is a possibility of bacterial growth thus chances of having contamination. It should not be dried using electric fans. After drying it should be wrapped in a fresh blotting paper and packed in a Zip lock poly bag. No preservative is required. It can be transpoed at environmental temperature. Hard Tissue: No preservative is required. The hard tissues should be wrapped in the blotting paper and placed in a zip lock poly bag. Soft tissue: It should be placed at 4degC or in Ice till it reaches laboratory for analysis. Hair: Hair roots should be placed in a blotting paper and then packed in a zip lock poly bag. It requires no preservative and can be transpoed at environmental temperature.",

Ivphics / Calton system / Finger prints Finger prints are present from bih both on epidermis and dermis, remain constant through out life and can't be altered without destroying true skin. Finger print pattern is absolutely individual i. e. no two hands are entirely alike, not even identical twins. That's why, it is best (most sensitive and most specific) and most reliable method of identification (Quetelet's rule of biological variation). DNA finger printing may be same in monozygotic twins. The pattern is neither inherited nor identical in any two persons. So the paternity cannot be proved through finger print patterns. However, paternity can be proved by DNA finger printing. Loops (67% most common) > whorls (25%) > arches (7%) > composite (2% least common) are four main types of pattern. It is accepted that chances of 2 finger prints matching 16 ridge characteristic are infinitely small (Parikh's). In practice 8 - 16 (Reddy) / 16 - 20 (Seth, Simpson) points of fine comparision are accepted as proof of identity. Locard's poroscopy method is study of microscopic pores, formed by mouths of ducts of subepidermal sweat gland present on ridges of fingers. These pores are permanent, remain un changed during life and are very useful when only fragments offingerprints are available. Each milimeter contains 9 - 18 pores. Criminals may attempt to multilate finger prints by applying CO2 snow, corrosive agents, burns or eroding against hard surface. But these manners do not destroy finger prints permanently unless true skin is completely destroyed.",

Attrition - due to wear and tear from mastication, upper surface of teeth destroyed gradually, first involving the enamel - dentine - pulp (depending on the functional use of teeth and hardness of enamel). Paradentosis - recession of gums and periodontal tissue surrounding the teeth, exposing the neck and adjacent pa of root - teeth fall off (poor hygiene increases paradentosis). Secondary dentine formation - develop within the pulp cavity and decrease size of the cavity, sta from base - apex, obliterate the cavity, increase with age, caries and paradentosis. Cementum apposition - near the end of root, increase cementum, increase thickness, deposited throughout life, and form incremental lines (devised by Boyde). Root resorption - because of cementum and dentine, absorption of root sta at apex and extend upward (may be pathological). Transparency of the root - seen after 30 years of age, canal in the dentine at first widen, increase with age because of deposition of minerals. They become invisible and dentine becomes transparent (Most reliable of all the criteria). B) Mile's method: Age can be known by changes of root transparency. Q Boyde' method: On enamel of the tooth, there is a line at bih (neonatal line). With increase in age, more lines are added, study of which helps in age determination. D) Stack's method: Age of infant can be known from height and weight of erupting teeth.",

Secondary injuries (sometimes also called teiary injuries) - These are the injuries caused d/t the victim falling on the ground or other stationary object. In primary impact injuries, the site and nature of injuries depend on the height of the pedestrian and upon the position of the person in relation to the vehicle when struck, i. e. whether crossing the road from one side to the other walking with or against the traffic. The injuries also depend upon the relative heights of various pas of the vehicle, i. e. bumper, radiator, fenders. In a typical case, the victim is struck by the front of the vehicle. An adult usually sustains injuries on the legs and a child on the head. Fracture of the tibia and, fibula of one or both legs is k/a bumper fracture. - The fracture is usually spiral or wedge shaped. The base of the triangular fragment of bone indicates the site of the impact and the apex points in the direction in which the vehicle was travelling. - In a bumber fracture, the distance from the heel to the, fracture sire gives information regarding height of the bumper and whether brakes were applied or not. When brakes are applied before the accident, the legs are injured at a lower level. (The. front bumber tends to rise during acceleration and dip under braking. If the pedestrian is hit from the side, there may be unilateral fracture of the nearest leg.
