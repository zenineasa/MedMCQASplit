This is called billowing. At about 25-35 years, the surface becomes granular and the ventral nd dorsal margins are well defined. A rim formation stas from the dorsal surface extends to the ventral surface. At about 35 -45 years, the upper and lower end will be raised and also the ventral margin by bony extension which is called lipping and the beaded rim development will be complete on all around the margins of the aicular surface. By 45-55 years, the beaded rim stas breaking. By 55-65 years the breakdown of the rim is more and by the end of seventh decade the breakdown of the rim will be complete.
