Profuse sweating, focal or generalized seizures, rigidity with opisthotonos, hypothermia, and hyperventilation have been observed in the course of the illness.

        "question": "The number of ATPs generated in krebs cycleare?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' > b' i. e., 24 One turn of the TCA cycle, staing with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the staing molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2. 5 ATPs and therefore, 12. 5 ATPs are produced when staing compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle. Note: Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from staing. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2. 5 ATPs and FADH produces 1. 5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs. Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per molecule of glucose when it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows:- Method of.

        "exp": "Cocaine causes contraction band necrosis by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine, resulting in excessive vasoconstriction of coronary vessels, leading to ischemia and infarction of heart tissue. Under these pathological conditions, myocardial cells switch to anaerobic metabolism and therefore glycolysis becomes the sole source of ATP substrate-level phosphorylations by phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase. Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, and its activity would therefore be increased. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is a regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis, which is induced by coisol, epinephrine, and glucagon. It functions in the hepatic synthesis of glucose when energy levels from beta-oxidation of fatty acids are adequate. Pyruvate dehydrogenase produces acetyl-CoA from pyruvate and coenzyme A, bridging glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. It requires 5 cofactors, including NAD and FAD, which would no longer be produced by the electron transpo under hypoxic conditions, decreasing its activity. Succinate dehydrogenase is a key enzyme of the Krebs cycle, producing a reduced equivalent of FAD to feed into the electron transpo chain. It is also known as Complex II. The Krebs cycle only functions if oxygen is in appropriate concentrations since it is regulated by the levels of NADH, which is only consumed by the electron transpo chain if there is enough oxygen. The absence of oxygen leads to an accumulation of NADH and a subsequent decrease in the enzyme activities of the Krebs cycle. Ref: Bender D. A., Mayes P. A. (2011). Chapter 20.

Hemoglobin electrophoresis reveals the presence of an unstable hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin Cranston (Hb. Cr), containing an abnormal b-globin chain. The normal sequence of the b-globin gene (Hb. Nl) and the sequence of the Hb. Cr b-chain are presented in the table below. Hb. Nl: AAGUAUCACUAAGCUCGC Hb. Cr: AAGAGUAUCACUAAGCUCGCUUUC >>> UAU UAA Which of the following would account for the development of Hb. Cr?",
        "exp": "Looking at the coding segment of the normal b-gene of hemoglobin, one should read the information codon by codon, as follows: AAG UAU CAC UAA GCU CGC 1 2 3 4 5 6 The normal b-globin gene has a stop codon (UAA) at the 4th position, therefore the last 2 codons (GCU and CGC) are not translated and do not code for amino acid residues found in the protein. Comparing this information to the coding segment of the mutated b-gene of hemoglobin Cranston, one would notice the following: AAG AGU AUC ACU AAG CUC GCU UUC UAU UAA 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 etc etc The inseion of two base pairs (AG) results in a frameshift mutation that eliminates the stop codon at position 4, thereby causing the addition of amino acids normally not translated in the hemoglobin b-chain of the child. Since the chain is now too long, this destabilizes the tetrameric conformation of hemoglobin. A frameshift mutation resulting in deletion of several amino acids is wrong, since such a mutation would have inseed a stop codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) before position 4. A mutation in the stop codon would have resulted in a longer-than-normal b-globin gene, but the information given does not indicate any changes in the stop codon at position 4. Interestingly, a chain elongation by mutation in the stop codon exists and is known as hemoglobin Constant Spring, affecting the a-chain of hemoglobin. A point mutation is the result of a single base pair change, which is not the case here. A point mutation resulting in the inseion of a new stop codon is called a nonsense mutation, and it would result in a shoer-than-normal protein. Ref: Weil P. (2011). Chapter 37.

Gene duplication (or chromosomal duplication or gene amplification) is any duplication of a region of DNA that contains a gene; it may occur as an error inhomologous recombination, a retrotransposition event, or duplication of an entire chromosome. The second copy of the gene is often free from selective pressure-- that is, mutations of it have no deleterious effects to its host organism. Thus it accumulates mutations faster than a functional single-copy gene, over generations of organisms. This freedom from consequences allows for the mutation of novel genes that could potentially increase the fitness of the organism or code for a new function. The two genes that exist after a gene duplication event are called paralogs and usually code for proteins with a similar function and/or structure. By contrast, ohologous genes are ones which code for proteins with similar functions but exist in different species",

The activity of telomerase, the main enzyme involved in synthesizing telomeres, is frequently elevated in cancer cells, providing one mechanism for overcoming telomere shortening.

        "question": "Fructose 2-6 bisphosphate (F26. BP) regulates glycolysis at the level of?",
        "exp": "Regulation of glycolysis Glycolysis is regulated at 3 steps which are irreversible. These reactions are catalyzed by following key enzymes: (1) Hexokinase and glucokinase, (2) Phosphofructokinase I, and (3) Pyruvate kinase. Hexokinase and glucokinase. These enzymes catalyze the first step of glycolysis, i. e., Glucose --> Glucose-6-phosphate. Glucokinase is found in liver, Whereas hexokinase is found in all tissues. Kinetic propeies of these two are different. Hexokinase has low Km, i. e., high affinity for glucose, low Vmax, and is subjected to feedback inhibition by the reaction product, glucose-6-phosphate. Hexokinase is found in most of the tissue except liver and comes into play when blood glucose is low. It is not affected by feeding or insulin. Hexokinase is not specific for glucose metabolism, it is also involved in metabolism of fructose and galactose. Glucokinase, on the other hand, is specific for glucose. It has high Km (i. e., low affinity for glucose), high Vmax and unlike hexokinase, it is not inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate. As it has low affinity for glucose (high km), it comes into play only when intracellular glucose concentration is high. It is induced by feeding and insulin. Glucagon inhibits glucokinase. Function of hexokinase is to provide glucose-6-phosphate at a constant rate, according the needs of cells, i. e., function of hexokinase is to provide constant glucose utilization by all tissues of body even when blood sugar is low. Function of glucokinase in the liver is to remove glucose from blood after a meal, providing glucose-6phosphate in excess of requirement for glycolysis so that it can be used for glycogen synthesis and lipogenesis. Phosphofructokinase IPhosphofructokinase I is the major regulatory enzyme of glycolysis. It catalyzes the 3rd reaction of glycolysis, i. e., fructose-6-P Fructose 1, 6 bis-P. This reaction is irreversible and is the \"rate -limiting step\" for glycolysis. It is also the \"commeted step\", meaning that once fructose 1, 6 bisphophate is formed it must go for the glycolytic pathway only. So, most impoant control point for glycolysis is through regulation of phosphofructokinase I. Phosphofructokinase - I is allosterically activated by: Fructose-6-phosphate, fructose 2, 6-bisphophate, AMP, ADP, K+ and phosphate. It is allosterically inhibited by: ATP, citrate, Ca+2, Mg+2, and low pH. Phosphofructokinase is an inducible enzyme that increases its synthesis in response to insulin and decreases in response to glucagon. Fructose 2, 6-bisphosphate (F-2, 6-BP) is the most impoant allosteric modulator (activator) of phosphofructokinase-I. Fructose 2, 6-bisphosphate is synthesized as a side product of glycolysis. A bifunctional enzyme named PFK-2/Fructose 2, 6 bisphosphatase is responsible for regulating the level of fructose 2, 6 bisphosphate in the liver. Phosphofuctokinase-2 (PFK-2) activity of this bifunctional enzyme is responsible for synthesis of F-2, 6-BP from fructose-6-phosphate and fructose 2, 6 bisphosphatase activity is responsible for hydrolysis of F-2, 6-BP back to fructose-6-phosphate.",

UREA CYCLE* Location: Cytosol and mitochondria of hepatocytes.* Substrates: NH 3 (as derived from oxidative deamination of glutamate); CO2; aspaate; three ATP.* Products: Urea; fumarate; H2O.* Purpose: The urea cycle allows for the excretion of NH 4+ by transforming ammonia into urea, which is then excreted by the kidneys.* Impoant enzymes: Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I: Conves ammonium and bicarbonate into carbamoyl phosphate. This is the rate-limiting step in the urea cycle. This reaction requires two ATP and occurs in the mitochondria. Ornithine transcarbamoylase: Combines ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to form citrulline. Located in mitochondria. Argininosuccinate synthetase: Condenses citrulline with aspaate to form arginosuccinate. This reaction occurs in the cytosol and requires one ATP. Argininosuccinate lyase: Splits argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate. Occurs in the cytosol. Arginase: Cleaves arginine into one molecule of urea and ornithine in the cytosol. The ornithine is then transpoed back into the mitochondria for entry back into the cycle.* Regulation: Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the cycle and is stimulated by N -acetylglutamate.* Diseases: Hyperammonemia occurs when there is a deficiency in one of more of the urea cycle enzymes, causing insufficient removal of NH 4+.

Convergence has been defined as the acquisition of morphologically similar traits between distinctly unrelated organisms. Convergence occurs at every level of biological organization. Functional Convergence This refers to molecules that serve the same function but have no sequence or structural similarity and carry out their function by entirely different mechanisms. Mechanistic convergence Mechanistic convergence occurs when the sequence and structure of molecules are very different but the mechanisms by which they act are similar. Structural Convergence This refers to molecules with very different amino acid sequences that can assume similar structural motifs, which may carry out similar functions. Sequence Convergence In sequence convergence, one or more critical amino acids or an amino acid sequence of two proteins come to resemble each other due to natural selection. (In protein evolution, sequence divergence, rather than sequence convergence is the rule.)",

Lysosomes are regarded as the digestive tract of the cell, since they are actively involved in digestion of cellular substances-namely proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids. Lysosomal enzymes are categorized as hydrolases. The lysosomal enzymes are responsible for maintaining the cellular compounds in a dynamic state, by their degradation and recycling. The degraded products leave the lysosomes usually by diffusion, for reutilization by the cell. Sometimes, however, certain residual products, rich in lipids and proteins, collectively known as Iipofuscin accumulate in the cell. Lipofuscin is the age pigment or wear and tear pigment which has been implicated in aging process.

        "question": "Which of the following is an amine hormone?",
        "exp": "Three general classes of hormone exist:? 1) Proteins and polypentide. Most of hormones in the body are polypeptides and proteins. In general, polypeptides with 100 or more aminoacids are called proteins, and those with fewer than 100 amino acids are referred to as peptides. Proteins and peptide hormones are synthesized on the rough ER. They are usually synthesized first as larger proteins (precursors) that are not biologically active (preprohormone) and cleaved in the ER to form smaller prohormones. These are then transferred to the Golgi apparatus for packing into secretory vesicles. In this process, enzymes in the vesicles cleave the prohormones to produce smaller, biologically active hormones and inactive fragments. Vesicles are stored into cytoplasm and secretion of the hormones occur by exocytosis. The peptide/protein hormones are:? Hypothalamus:- Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), coicotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), Growth-hormone releasing hormone (GHRh), Growth hormone inhibitory hormone (GHIn), i. e., somatostatin, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn. RH). Anterior pituitary:- Growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone (THS) or thyrotropin, adrenocoicotropin hormone (ACTH), prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leutinizing hormone (LH). Posterior pituitary: - Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)/vasopressin, oxytocin. Thyroid gland: - Calcitonin. Pancreas: - Insulin, glucagon. Parathyroid: - Parathormone. Placenta: - Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), Human somatomammotropin. Kidney: - Renin, erythropoietin. Heart: - Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Stomach: - Gastrin. Small intestine: - Secretin, Cholecystokinin (CCK). Adipocytes: - Leptin. Angiotensin IISome of these peptide hormones are glycoproteins, i. e., they have sugar associated with proteins. Glycoprotein hormones are FSH, LH, TSH, human chorionic gonadotropin, erythropoietin. 2) Steroid hormones. These hormones are synthesized from cholesterol. Once they are synthesized, they are simply diffuse across the cell membrane (because they are lipid soluble) and enter the interstitial fluid and then the blood. Thus, they are not stored. Steroid hormones are:? Adrenal coex: - Coisol (Glucocoicoids), Aldosterone (mineralocoicoids). Gonads: - Testosterone, estrogen, progesterone. Kidney: - 1, 25 - Dihydroxycholecalciferol3) Amine hormones. These hormones are derivatives of amino acid tyrosine. These hormones are: Thyroid gland: - Thyroxine (T4) and Triiodothyronine (T3).

        "question": "One of your patients is diagnosed with retinoblastoma. He has a single tumor in one eye. The patient is worried whether his children would suffer from the same condition. What test could be used to determine whether it is a heritable or sporadic tumor?",
        "exp": "Foy percent of retinoblastomas are heritable; the child inherits one mutant allele through the germline and a somatic mutation in the other allele occurs, resulting in the loss of function of that gene. This leads to tumor development, often with multiple tumors in both eyes. Penetrance, however, is not complete, since the second mutation is a chance event. Sixty percent of retinoblastomas are sporadic; both alleles are inactivated by somatic mutation. Because this is a rare event, tumors usually are in only one eye and present at a later age. To detect a mutation in the Rb gene and differentiate between heritable and sporadic cases of retinoblastoma, PCR is the most appropriate technique of the choices given. Using the appropriate primers, a deletion can be detected as a change in size of the DNA band amplified. In heritable cases, one chromosome will show the altered length from the deletion or the translocation in any cell in the body. In sporadic retinoblastoma, samples isolated from anywhere other than the tumor should have two normal alleles. DNA footprinting is a protocol used to detect specific protein binding to DNA molecules by comparing the fragmentation patterns of DNA bound with the protein of interest vs. unbound DNA following digestion with DNase I. If the bound protein protects against DNase I digestion, the position of the protein on the DNA can be deduced by the loss of the characteristic fragment. FACS uses antibodies coupled to fluorescent markers to determine cell surface molecules on whole cells. It is very useful for determining the stage of development or activation of cells, but does not give you any insight into the DNA. Nohern blotting, the RNA counterpa to Southern blotting, will determine the size and abundance of m. RNA of a specific gene in a given sample of RNA. RNA is not able to be cleaved by restriction enzymes the way the DNA can; however, RNA molecules for different proteins are of different lengths. The sample is separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with a specific, labeled probe. This will be exposed to film and the bands will appear, revealing the size and the abundance of specific m. RNAs.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Increased b-oxidation. Starvation is characterized by decreased insulin: glucagon ratio. This causes:? i) Increased lipolysis - More FFAs for ketogenesis. ii) Increased fi-oxidation - Increased ketogenosis. iii) Decreased oxaloacetate - Acetyl CoA is utilized in ketogenesis. Regulation of ketogenesis. Ketogenesis is regulated at three levels:? 1) Factors regulating mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissues (i. e. lipolysis):- Free fatty acids, the precursors of ketone bodies, arise from lipolysis of triglycerides in adipose tissue. Hence, factors which enhance lipolysis (e. g. glucagon) stimulate ketogensis by providing more free fatty acids. Conversely, factors that inhibit lipolysis (e. g. insulin) inbibit ketogenesis. 2) Factors regulating b-oxidation of fatty acids:- After uptake by liver, FAAs are either (i) b-oxidized to CO, or ketone bodies, or (ii) esterified to triacylglycerol. Carnitine acetyl transferase-I (CAT-I) regulates the b-oxidation of fatty acid and therefore the production of staing materials of ketogenesis i. e. acetyl. CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA (The remainder of fatty acids which do not enter b-oxidation, are estesified). Activity of CAT-1 is high in starvation and diabetes leading to increased b-oxidation of fatty acids and increased ketogenesis. CAT-1 activity is low in well fed state, resulting in decreased 13-oxidation and ketogenesis. This regulation is governed by Malonyl CoA, which is an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine acetyl transferase-1: CAT-1 (or carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1: (CPT-1). Malonyl CoA is synthesized by acetyl CoA carboxylase. Activity of acetyl CoA carboxylase is high in well fed state due to increase in insulin/ glucagon ratio, which inturn results in increased formation of malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA inhibits CAT-I (CPT-I) leading to decreased b-oxidation and ketogenesis. Hence, esterification of fatty acids is increased. Conversely, during starvation (and diabetes) insulin/glucagon ratio is decreased which results in decreased activity of acetyl CoA carboxylase and decreased production of malonyl-CoA, releasing the inhibition of CAT-I (CPT-I). This results in increase b-oxidation of fatty acids and ketogenesis. 3) Factors regulating the oxidation of acetyl CoA:- The acetyl-CoA formed in b-oxidation is oxidized in the citric acid cycle, or it enters the ketogenesis to form ketone bodies. When oxaloacetate concentration is low, little acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle and ketogenesis is oured (first reaction of TCA cycle inolves oxaloacetate, where it combines with acetyl-CoA to form citrate). Concentration of oxalaceatate is lowered if carbohydrate is unavailable or improperly utilized, e. g. in fasting and in diabetes.",

        "exp": "Positively charged (cationic) amino acids are attracted to the negative electrode (the cathode), and negatively charged (anionic) amino acids are attracted to the positive electrode (the anode). An amino acid at its isoelectric point has no net charge, so it does not move. So at the physiological pH, amino acid with positive charge will move slowest towards the anode (positively charged electrode). Thus lysine will migrate slowest to the anode end. Electrophoresis uses differences in isoelectric points to separate mixtures of amino acids. A streak of the amino acid mixture is placed in the center of a layer of acrylamide gel or a piece of filter paper wet with a buffer solution. Two electrodes are placed in contact with the edges of the gel or paper, and a potential of several thousand volts is applied across the electrodes. Positively charged (cationic) amino acids are attracted to the negative electrode (the cathode), and negatively charged (anionic) amino acids are attracted to the positive electrode (the anode). An amino acid at its isoelectric point has no net charge, so it does not move. Amino acid classification:- Acidic Amino acids: These amino acids have two - COOH groups and one -Nil, group.

This decreases the number of glucose transpoers which are insulin dependent. Insulin dependent glucose transpoers are GLUT-4, present in adipocytes, skeletal and cardiac muscles. Rest of the glucose transpoers are not insulin dependent. Harper writes-\"Glucose uptake into muscle and adipose tissue is controlled by insulin, which is secreted by the B islet cells of the pancreas in response to an increased concentration of glucose in the poal blood. An early response to insulin in muscle and adipose tissue is the migration of glucose transpoer vesicles to the cell surface, exposing active glucose transpoers (GLUT 4). These insulin-sensitive tissues will only take up glucose from the blood stream to any significant extent in the presence of the hormone. As insulin secretion falls in the starved state, so the transpoers are internalized again, reducing glucose uptake\" Glucose Transpoers Glucose enters cells either by facilitated diffusion or by secondary active transpo with No+ (in the intestine and kidneys) Glucose transpoers are a family of membrane proteins that are responsible for facilitated diffusion of glucose across cell membranes. They differ from and have no homology with the sodium-dependent glucose transpoers, SGLT 1 and SGLT 2, responsible for the secondary active transpo of glucose in the intestine and renal tubules. Seven different glucose transpoers, named GLUT 1-7 in order of discovery. have been characterized. Each transpoer appears to have evolved for special tasks.

MYC - protooncogene is expressed in almost all eukaryotic cell. MYC - protein is translocated to nucleus (sometimes as hetrodimer with MAX protein) and is a potent transcription activator.

Cells in culture undergo apoptosis if MYC activation occurs in absence of growth factorsQ, but it is not clear whether MYC induced apoptosis occurs in vivo. Retinoblastoma susceptibility protein (RB), in hypophosphorylated state, prevents cell from replicating by forming complex with transcription factor E2F (E2F/D P1/RB - complex). Phosphorylation of RB dissociates the complex, release E2F, eliminates main barrier to cell cycle progression & promotes cell replication. Cyclin D, which is the first cyclin to increase in cell cycle, (appears in GI phase but becomes detectable in S phase) activates CDK4 and form cyclin D- CDK4 complex that phosphorylates RB.

The ability to form the maximum number of hydrogen bonds, supplemented by van der Waals interactions in the core of this tightly packed structure, provides the thermodynamic driving force for the formation of an alpha helix. Since the peptide bond nitrogen of proline lacks a hydrogen atom to contribute to a hydrogen bond, proline can only be stably accommodated within the first turn of an alpha helix.

Gluconeogenesis conves glycerol into glucose and the Cori cycle conves lactate into usable glucose.

Symptoms may occur early in life, soon after birth if food or formulas containing these sugars are introduced into the diet. Early clinical manifestations resemble galactosemia and include jaundice, hepatomegaly, vomiting, lethargy, irritability and convulsions, hypoglycemia.

        "exp": "The hemoglobin tetramer binds one molecule of BPG in the central cavity formed by its four subunits. However, the space between the H helices of the chains lining the cavity is sufficiently wide to accommodate BPG only when hemoglobin is in the T state. BPG forms salt bridges with the terminal amino groups of both chains Val NA1 and with Lys EF6 and His H21. BPG therefore stabilizes deoxygenated (T-state) hemoglobin by forming additional salt bridges that must be broken prior to conversion to the R state. Residue H21 of the subunit of HbF is Ser rather than His. Since Ser cannot form a salt bridge, BPG binds more weakly to HbF than to HbA. The lower stabilization afforded to the T state by BPG accounts for HbF having a higher affinity for O2 than HbA. Ref: Kennelly P. J., Rodwell V. W. (2011). Chapter 6.

Thus total 9 ATP molecules are produced and 2 are utilized, i. e., There is net gain of 7 ATP molecules in aerobic glycolysis. In anaerobic conditions, the reoxidation of NADH by electron transpo chain is prevented and NADH gets reoxidized by conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Thus, in anaerobic glycolysis only 4 ATP are produced at substrate level. Therefore, there is net gain of 2 ATP molecules in anaerobic glycolysis. Note: - Previous calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH2 generates 2 ATPs. This will amount to a net generation of 8. ATPs per glucose molecule during glycolysis. Recent experiments show that these old values are overestimates and NADH produces 2. 5 ATPs and FADH2 produces 1. 5 ATPs. Thus, net generation is only 7. ATPs during glycolysis.",

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL): is a glycoprotein anchored to proteoglycans that decorate the capillary endothelial surfaces of adipose tissue, heart and skeletal muscle. The triglycerides of chylomicrons are hydrolyzed by LPL, and free fatty acids are released. ApoC-II, which is transferred to circulating chylomicrons from HDL, acts as a cofactor for LPL in this reaction. LPL deficiency has autosomal recessive inheritance. Both LPL and apoC-II deficiency usually present in childhood with recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain due to acute pancreatitis.

A good example is the Aneuploid Screen test which is performed on amniotic fluid cells when there is a strong clinical indication for one of the common trisomies. The sample nuclei are denatured and hybridized with DNA probes for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y and results usually obtained within 24 hours.

Examples of competitive inhibition are inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase by malonate, HMG CoA reductase by statins, carbonic anhydrase by acetazolamide and LDH by oxamate. ii) Non-competitive inhibition Inhibitor binds at a site other than the substrate-binding site. Thus inhibitor can bind to both free enzyme and enzyme substrate complex. The inhibitor therefore lowers the concentration of active enzyme.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline Impoant glycerophospholipids are:? Phosphatidylcholine (lecithin):- These glycerophospholipids contain choline. These are most abundant phospholipids in cell membrane. Dipalmitoyl lecithin (dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine) is an impoant phosphatidylcholine found in lungs, secreted by type II pneumocytes. It acts as a lung surfactant and is necessary for normal lung compliance. It reduces surface tension in alveoli and prevents alveolar collapse. Acute pulmonary respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants is due to inefficient production of surfactant dipalmitoyl lecithin (dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine). Phosphatidylethanolamine (cephaline):- They have ethanolamine instead of choline. Thromboplastin (coagulation factor 111) is composed of cephaline. Like lecithin, Phosphatidylethanolamine is also a component of cell membrane. Phosphatidylserine:- They have serine nitrogenous base. Phosphatidylserine is also a componant of cell membrane. It plays a role in apoptosis. Phosphatidylinositol:- They have inositol as the stereoisomers, myoinositol. Phosphatidylinositol4, 5? bisphosphate is an impoant constituent of cell membrane phospholipids, upon stimulation by a suitable hormone agonist, it is cleaved into diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate both of which act as second messengers. Plasmalogens:- Plasmalogens are similar to other glycerophospholipids but fatty acid at Cl of glycerol is linked through an ether, rather than ester bond as occurs in other glycerophospholipids. So, plasmalogen is called ether glycerolipid. Plasmalogens are found in brain (myelin) and cardiac muscles. Plasmalogen is a platelet activating factor (PAF) and involved in platelet aggregation and degranulation. Lysophospholipids:- Lysophospholipids are formed when one of the two fatty acid is removed from glycerophospholipids (i. e. Lysophospholipids=glycerophospholipid-1 fatty acid or lysophospholipids=glyceral + phosphoric acid + 1 fatty acid + nitrogenous base). Most common of these are lysophosphatidykholine (lysolecithine) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lysocephalin). Cardiolipin (Diphosphatidylglycerol):- Cardiolipin' is composed of two molecules of phosphatidic acid connected by a molecule of glycerol, i. e. cardiolipin phosphatidic acid + glycerol + phosphatidic acid. There is no nitrogenous base. Cardiolipin is a major lipid of inner mitochondrial membrane and is necessary for optimum functioning of ETC.",

        "question": "Frame shift mutation causes?",
        "exp": "Mutations A mutation is a permanant change in the DNA. Mutations that affect germ cells (sperm or ovum) are transmitted to progeny and may give rise to inherited disease. Mutations that affect somatic cells are not transmitted to progeny but are impoant in the genesis of cancers and congenital malformations. Mutations may be classified into three categories - 1. Gene mutations The vast majority of mutations associated with hereditary disease are gene mutations. These may of different types depending whether it involves complete gene or single base -(a) Point mutation A single nucleotide base is subustituted by a different base. When a pyrimidine base is subustituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine Transition. When a purine is substituded by a pyrimidine or vice-versa Transversion. This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i. e. in codon and leads to replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product. Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation. Example is sickle mutation in which CTC codon in 3-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid is changed to CAC codon that codes for valine. Another type of point mutation is nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon. Example is 3-thalassemia in which CAG codon in 3-chain of hemoglobin that code for glutamin is changed to stop codon UAG after point mutation. Deletion and inseions Deletion or inseion of one or two base lead to alterations in the reading frame of the DNA strand --> frame shift mutation. If the number of base pairs invoved is three or a multiple of three framshift does not occur (because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized. (c) Trinucleotide repeat mutation Normally a codon is triplet ie trinucleotide. In this type of mutation a codon, ie trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain. For example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeater of CGG. 2. Chromosome mutation Result from rearrangement of genetic material that give rise to visible structural changes in the chromosome. 3. Genome mutation Involves loss or gain of whole chromosome, e. g. monosomy - Turner syndrome, trisomy - Down syndrome.",

It is caused by an accumulation of glycogen in the lysosome due to deficiency of the lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme. It is the only glycogen storage disease with a defect in lysosomal metabolism, and the first glycogen storage disease to be identified, The disease is caused by a mutation in a gene (acid alpha-glucosidase: also known as acid maltase) on long arm of chromosome 17. Most cases appear to be due to three mutations. A transversion (T - G) mutation is the most common among adults with this disorder. This mutation interrupts a site of RNA splicing. The gene encodes a protein--acid alpha-glucosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 20)--which is a lysosomal hydrolase. The protein is an enzyme that normally degrades the alpha -1, 4 and alpha -1, 6 linkages in glycogen, maltose and isomaltose and is required for the degradation of 1-3% of cellular glycogen. The deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of structurally normal glycogen in lysosomes and cytoplasm in affected individuals. clinical features: Accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes: Juvenile onset variant, muscle hypotonia, death from heart failure by age 2; adult onset variant, muscle dystrophy",

HMP shunt is required for provision of reduced NADPH and fiver-carbon sugars e. g. ribose (Pentose phosphates) for nucleic acid synthesis. Normally, 90% of glucose is oxidized by glycolysis and 10% is oxidized by HMP shunt. However, in liver and RBCs HMP shunt accounts for oxidation of 30% glucose. HMP shunt occurs in the cytosol. It is highly active in liver, adipose tissue, adrenal coex, lens, cornea, lactating (but not the nonlactating) mammary gland. Gonads (testis, ovary) and erythrocytes.

In diet the major lipids are triglyceride and cholesterol. Cholesterol is absorbed as such in proximal small intestine and is esterified to cholesteryl ester (ChE). Triglycerides are hydrolysed by lipases to glycerol and fatty acids which are absorbed in intestine. Inside intestinal cells triglyceride is synthesized by fatty acids. Chylomicrons are synthesized in the small intestine that contain triglyceride, cholesteryl ester, cholesterol, phosphlipids, and apoprotein B-48 (apo B-48) and apo-A. These chylomicrons are secreted in the intestinal lymph and reach the systemic circulation thoracic duct. In the circulation apo E and apo C are transfered to chylomicrons by HDL, so now chylomicrons contain apo A, apo B-48, apo- E, & apo-C. In the circulation, triglycerides of chylomicrons are hydrolysed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) present on endothelial cells of vessels of skeletal muscles, adipose tissue and heart, but not in liver. The released fatty acids are utilized locally by these tissues. Adipose tissue uses these fatty acids to restore them as TGs and heart and skeletal muscle use them as source of energy. Thus, function of chylomicrons is to transpo exogenous (dietry)triglycerideQ to adipose tissue (for storage), heart (for energy) and muscle (for energy). The chylomicron paicle progressively shrinks in size by action of LPL and, cholesterol, phospholipids, apo-A and apo C are transferred to HDL, creating chylomicron remnants that contains more cholesterol, less triglycerides, apo-E & apo B-48. Chylomicron remnants are removed by liver by the LDL receptors that require apo-E as ligand.",

Twenty cycles provide an amplification of 106 (million) and 30 cycles of 109 (billion). PCR occurs in following steps -i) Isolation of target DNA sequence:- A DNA containing the sequences to be amplified is isolated. ii) Primers construction:- The sequence of flanking region (nucleotide sequence of sho segments on each side of target DNA sequence) are used to construct 2 single stranded oligonucleotides which are complementary to the respective flanking region. These oligonucleotides functions as primers in PCR reaction. iii) Denaturation of DNA:- Target DNA is heated to separate the double strand of DNA into single strands. iv) Annealing of primers to single stranded DNA:- The separated strands are cooled and allowed to anneal to the two primers, one for each strand. v) Chain extension:- DNA polymerase and deoxyribonucleotides (d. NTP) are added to the mixture. DNA polymer? ase (Taq polymerase) then uses the primer for DNA synthesis using target strands as templates. On both strands, Primer is amplified in 5'-43' direction by addition of nucleotides (d. NTP) at 3' end. The mixture is once again heated to melt (separate) all double stranded structure. There are now four strands of DNA. A second cycle of cooling, allows fuher binding of the primers and a second round of polymerization is repeated. The process of heating (denaturation), cooling (annealing) and polymerization is repeated many times.

        "exp": "Radiolabelled DNA probe Polymerase Chain Reaction. PCR is a cell-free, test tube method for amplifying a target sequence of DNA. It is much faster and more sensitive than cell-based cloning. Materials required: Two primers, each about 20-35 bases long with sequence complementary to the sequence immediately adjacent to the DNA segment of interest ( flanking sequence). DNA polymerase (e. g., Taq polymerase) which can sustain high temperature (> 600 C). A large number of free deoxynucleotides (d. NTPs). The target DNA fragment. Procedure: There are three major steps in a PCR, which are repeated for 20 or 30 cycles. a. Heat Denaturation- The DNA sample to be amplified is first heated to separate the two strandsb. Annealing- The primers bind to the two separated strands of DNA ( one for each strand ) flanking the target sequence. c. Extension- Each strand is copied by the DNA polymerase, staing at the primer site. The two DNA strands each serve as a template for the synthesis of new DNA from the two primers. The above three steps are repeated again and again. The number of copies doubles in each cycle. Typically 20-30 cycles are run during this process. There is an exponential increase in the amount of target DNA, amplifying it by a million-fold to a billion-fold. By using a heat stable DNA polymerase( Taq polymerase ), the polymerase is not denatured and, therefore does not have to be added at each successive cycle. Advantages: The major advantage of PCR over cloning as a mechanism for amplifying a specific DNA sequence aresensitivity: DNA sequences present in only trace amounts can be amplified to become the predominant sequencespeedless technically difficult than traditional cloning methods using recombinant DNA techniques.

Inability to metabolize galactose occurs in the galactosemias, which may be caused by inherited defects of galactokinase, uridyl transferase, or 4-epimerase, though deficiency of uridyl transferase is best known. The condition is more severe if it is the result of a defect in the uridyl transferase since galactose 1-phosphate accumulates and depletes the liver of inorganic phosphate. Ultimately, liver failure and mental deterioration result. Glucose oxidase test is specific for glucose and seliwanoff's test for fructose.

The substrate bind to the active site of the enzyme by noncovalent interactions like hydrogen bond, ionic (electrostatic) bond and hydrophobic bonds. There is confusion between noncovalent van der Waals forces and covalent bond. Some guides have given option `c' as the answer, which is incorrect. \"Enzymes bind to the substrate by a combination of hydrogen and ionic (electrostatic) bonds, as well as by hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions\". \"Most enzyme-substrate combinations are mostly due to noncovalent hydrogen, hydrophobic, ionic (electrostatic) and Van der Waals forces\". \"There is a precise substrate interaction that occurs at the active site of enzyme stabilized by numerous weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic contacts, and Van der Walls forces)\". Many other references have mentioned the same. Thus Van der Walls forces are also involved in enzyme substrate reaction. Now we are left with covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are also involved in some enzymatic reactions called covalent catalysis. In which there is the formation of covalent bond between enzyme and substrate. The modified enzyme then becomes a reactant. For example, the serine residue at the active site of chymotrypsin forms a covalent link with the substrate. So, all the four forces given in the options are involved in the enzyme-substrate interaction. However, amongst the given options, I will go for covalent bonds because most of the enzyme-substrate interactions involve weak non-covalent interactions, whereas covalent catalysis mechanism is found only in few enzymes like proteases (chymotrypsin and trypsin) and few others. The best option, in a given scenario, the answer is a covalent bond.",

Biosynthesis of urea occurs in five steps: 1) Carbamoyl phosphate synthase-I (CPS-I), a mitochondrial enzyme, catalyzes the formation of carbamoyl phosphate by condensation of CO2 and ammonia. Two molecules of ATP are required for the reaction. CPS-I is the rate limiting enzyme of urea cycle. It is an allosteric enzyme and allosterically activated by N-acetyl glutamate. 2) Ornithine transcarbamoylase catalyzes the formation of citrulline from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine. 3) Arginosuccinate synthase catalyzes the formation of arginosuccinate from citrulline and aspaate. This reaction requires 1. ATP, but 2 high energy phosphate bonds are consumed as ATP is conveed to AMP + PPi. The amino group of aspaate provides one of the two nitrogen atoms that appear in urea (The other one is provided by ammonia NH4). 4) Arginosuccinate lyase (arginosuccinase) catalyses the cleavage of arginosuccinate into arginine and fumarate. Fumarate enters in TCA cycle. 5) Arginase catalyses the formation of urea from arginine by hydrolytic cleavage of arginine to yield urea and ornithine. Ornithine is thus regenerated and can enter mitochondria to initiate another round of the urea cycle.",

The most important function of malate shuttle is to transport cytosolic reducing equivalents (generated in glycolysis) into the mitochondria. But, malate shuttle has no direct role in the occurrence of any reaction of glycolysis, i. e. malate shuttle does not take part in the glycolytic process itself. Its role is to generate ATP by transporting NADH into the mitochondria. You can easily understand this by the fact that anaerobic glycolysis occurs without any participation of the malate shuttle. Hence, presence or absence of malate shuttle has no direct effect on the glycolytic process itself. On the other hand, the malate shuttle is directly involved in gluconeogenesis by transporting malate out of the mitochondria into the cytosol. Thus without malate shuttle, gluconeogenesis cannot occur. Thus, malate shuttle is a part of the gluconeogenic process while it is not a part of the glycolytic process. In short Most important function of malate shuttle is to transport the reducing equivalents (generated in glycolysis) into the mitochondria. Malate shuttle is not a part of the glycolytic process itself Malate shuttle is a part of the gluconeogenic process.",

        "exp": "Gluconeogenesis is the process of synthesizing glucose or glycogen from noncarbohydrate precursors. The major substrates are the glucogenic amino acids, lactate, glycerol, and propionate. Liver and kidney are the major gluconeogenic tissues; the kidney may contribute up to 40% of total glucose synthesis in the fasting state and more in starvation. Glucagon is a hormone produced and secreted by the alpha-cells of the pancreas in response to decreases in blood glucose. Glucagon and epinephrine, hormones that are responsive to a decrease in blood glucose, inhibit glycolysis and stimulate gluconeogenesis in the liver by increasing the concentration of c. AMP. Pentose pathway and citric acid cycle are not directly affected by glucagon. Ref: Bender D. A., Mayes P. A. (2011). Chapter 20. Gluconeogenesis & the Control of Blood Glucose. In D. A. Bender, K. M.

        "exp": "Energetics of TCA cycles (Kreb's cycle). One turn of the TCA cycle, staing with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the staing molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2. 5 ATPs and therefore, 12-5 ATPs are produced when staing compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle. Note: Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from staing. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2. 5 ATPs and FADH produces 1. 5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs. Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per molecule of glucose when it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows:-",
