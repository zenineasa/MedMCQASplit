        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' > b' i. e., 24 One turn of the TCA cycle, staing with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the staing molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2. 5 ATPs and therefore, 12. 5 ATPs are produced when staing compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle. Note: Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from staing. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2. 5 ATPs and FADH produces 1. 5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs. Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per molecule of glucose when it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows:- Method of.

Glutathione is present in all mammalian cells except neurons. The sulphydryl (-SH) group of cysteine residue is the reactive poion of glutathione which can undergo oxidation and reduction. Thus, glutathione may exist as the reduced (G-SH) or oxidized form (G-S-S-G) and can play a role in some oxidation-reduction reactions. In oxidized form two molecules of glutathione are linked by disulfide bond. Cysteine in glutathione act as reducing agent FUNCTIONS: - It helps in keeping some enzyme in active state by preventing the oxidation of sulphydryl (-SH) group of enzyme. It helps in detoxification of H2. O2 by reducing it. Superoxide anion (O2) first conveed to H2. O2 by superoxide dismutase. Glutathione helps in membrane transpo H2. O2 is then reduced to H2. O2 by glutathione perioxidase, a reaction requires reduced glutathione. Thus, glutathione scavenges free radicals and superoxide anion. It helps in detoxification of xenobiotics by their conjugation (conjugation reaction). Reduced form of glutathione (GSH) with a free sulphydryl (-SH) group serves as a redox buffer, regulating redox state of the cell. Reduced glutathione is essential for maintaining the normal structure of RBCs and for keeping hemoglobin iron in ferrous state (prevents formation of methemoglobin).

The individuals have difficulty to see in dim light since the dark adaptation time is increased. Prolonged deficiency irreversibly damages a number of visual cells. Severe deficiency of vitamin A leads to xerophthalmia. This is characterized by dryness in conjunctiva and cornea, and keratinization of epithelial cells. In certain areas of conjunctiva, white triangular plaques known as Bitot's spots are seen. lf xerophthalmia persisits for a long time, corneal ulceration and degeneration occur. This results in the destruction of cornea, a condition referred to as keratomalacia, causing total blindness Vitamin A deficiency blindness is mostly common in children of the developing countries Key Concept: Night blindness (nyctalopia) is one of the earliest symptoms of vitamin A deficiency.

UCA codes for serine and CCA codes for proline in all organisms. That means specificity of codon has been conserved from very early stages of evolution. Exception to the universality of genetic coder are found in human mitochondria, where the code:- a UGA codes for tryptophan instead of serving as a stop codon. AUA codes for methionine instead of isoleucine. CUA codes for threonine instead of leucine. LI AGA and AGG serve as stop codon instead of coding for arginine. 2) Unambiguous/Specific:- A paicular codon always codes for the same amino acid. For example CCU always codes for proline and UGG always codes for tryptophan. 3) Degeneracy/Redundancy:- A given amino acid may have more than one codon. For example, CCU, CCC, CCA and CCG all four codons code for proline. Therefore, there are 61 codons for 20 amino acids. 4) Stop or termination or nonsense codons:- Three of the 64 possible nucleotide triplets UAA (amber), UAG (Ochre) and UGA (opal) do not code for any amino acid. They are called nonsense codons that normally signal termination of polypeptide chains. Thus, though there are 64 possible triplet codons, only 61 codes for 20 amino acids (as remaining three are non-sense codons). 5) Non overlapping and nonpuntate (Comma less):- During translation, the code is read sequentially, without spacer bases, from a fixed staing point, as a continuous sequence of bases, taken 3 at a time, e. g. AUGCUA GACUUU is read as AUG/CUA/GAC/UUU without \"ponctation\" (coma) between codons.",

Low-density human lipoprotein not only contains the greatest ratio of bound cholesterol to protein but also has the greatest potency in suppressing endogenous cholesterogenesis. normally suppress cholesterol synthesis by binding to a specific membrane receptor that mediates inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A reductase. In familial hypercholesterolemia the LDL receptor is dysfunctional, with the result that cholesterol synthesis is less responsive to plasma cholesterol levels. Suppression of HMG CoA reductase is attained using inhibitors (statins) that mimic the structure of mevalonic acid, the natural feedback inhibitor of the enzyme. Note: The LDL (apoB-100, E) receptor is defective in familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition in which blood LDL cholesterol levels are increased, causing premature atherosclerosis.

Biological specimens confirm the presence of cocaine and metabolites. Activity of which of the following enzymes was most likely increased in the patient's myocardial cells sholy prior to his death?",
        "exp": "Cocaine causes contraction band necrosis by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine, resulting in excessive vasoconstriction of coronary vessels, leading to ischemia and infarction of heart tissue. Under these pathological conditions, myocardial cells switch to anaerobic metabolism and therefore glycolysis becomes the sole source of ATP substrate-level phosphorylations by phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase. Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, and its activity would therefore be increased. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is a regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis, which is induced by coisol, epinephrine, and glucagon. It functions in the hepatic synthesis of glucose when energy levels from beta-oxidation of fatty acids are adequate. Pyruvate dehydrogenase produces acetyl-CoA from pyruvate and coenzyme A, bridging glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. It requires 5 cofactors, including NAD and FAD, which would no longer be produced by the electron transpo under hypoxic conditions, decreasing its activity. Succinate dehydrogenase is a key enzyme of the Krebs cycle, producing a reduced equivalent of FAD to feed into the electron transpo chain. It is also known as Complex II. The Krebs cycle only functions if oxygen is in appropriate concentrations since it is regulated by the levels of NADH, which is only consumed by the electron transpo chain if there is enough oxygen. The absence of oxygen leads to an accumulation of NADH and a subsequent decrease in the enzyme activities of the Krebs cycle. Ref: Bender D. A., Mayes P. A. (2011). Chapter 20.

Nl) and the sequence of the Hb. Cr b-chain are presented in the table below. Hb. Nl: AAGUAUCACUAAGCUCGC Hb. Cr: AAGAGUAUCACUAAGCUCGCUUUC >>> UAU UAA Which of the following would account for the development of Hb. Cr?",
        "exp": "Looking at the coding segment of the normal b-gene of hemoglobin, one should read the information codon by codon, as follows: AAG UAU CAC UAA GCU CGC 1 2 3 4 5 6 The normal b-globin gene has a stop codon (UAA) at the 4th position, therefore the last 2 codons (GCU and CGC) are not translated and do not code for amino acid residues found in the protein. Comparing this information to the coding segment of the mutated b-gene of hemoglobin Cranston, one would notice the following: AAG AGU AUC ACU AAG CUC GCU UUC UAU UAA 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 etc etc The inseion of two base pairs (AG) results in a frameshift mutation that eliminates the stop codon at position 4, thereby causing the addition of amino acids normally not translated in the hemoglobin b-chain of the child. Since the chain is now too long, this destabilizes the tetrameric conformation of hemoglobin. A frameshift mutation resulting in deletion of several amino acids is wrong, since such a mutation would have inseed a stop codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) before position 4. A mutation in the stop codon would have resulted in a longer-than-normal b-globin gene, but the information given does not indicate any changes in the stop codon at position 4. Interestingly, a chain elongation by mutation in the stop codon exists and is known as hemoglobin Constant Spring, affecting the a-chain of hemoglobin. A point mutation is the result of a single base pair change, which is not the case here. A point mutation resulting in the inseion of a new stop codon is called a nonsense mutation, and it would result in a shoer-than-normal protein. Ref: Weil P. (2011). Chapter 37.

Gene duplication (or chromosomal duplication or gene amplification) is any duplication of a region of DNA that contains a gene; it may occur as an error inhomologous recombination, a retrotransposition event, or duplication of an entire chromosome. The second copy of the gene is often free from selective pressure-- that is, mutations of it have no deleterious effects to its host organism. Thus it accumulates mutations faster than a functional single-copy gene, over generations of organisms. This freedom from consequences allows for the mutation of novel genes that could potentially increase the fitness of the organism or code for a new function. The two genes that exist after a gene duplication event are called paralogs and usually code for proteins with a similar function and/or structure. By contrast, ohologous genes are ones which code for proteins with similar functions but exist in different species",

It is also called as \"pentose phosphate pathway\", \"Dickens - Horecker pathway\", \"Shunt pathway\" or \"phosphogluconate oxidative pathway\". HMP shunt is required for provision of reduced NADPH and fiver-carbon sugars (Pentose phosphates) for nucleic acid synthesis. Normally, 90% of glucose is oxidized by glycolysis and 10% is oxidized by HMP shunt. However, in liver and RBCs HMP shunt accounts for oxidation of 30% glucose. HMP shunt occurs in the cytosol. It is highly active in liver, adipose tissue, adrenal coex, lens, cornea, lactating (but not the nonlactating) mammag gland, Gonads (testis, ovary) and erythrocytes. Activity of this pathway is minimal in muscle and brain, where almost all of the glucose is degraded by glycolysis.",

It reflects inhibition of glycolysis by oxygen and is called pasteure effect. The Pasteur effect is due to inhibition of the enzyme phosphofructokinase because of inhibitory effect caused by citrate and ATP, the compounds produced in presence of oxygen due to operation of TCA cycle. Crabtree effect This is opposite of Pasteur effect, which represents decreased respiration of cellular systems caused by high concentration of glucose. When oxygen supply is kept constant and glucose concentration is increased, the oxygen consumption by cells falls, i. e., relative anaerobiosis is produced when glucose concentration is increased in constant supply of oxygen. It is seen in cells that have a high rate of aerobic glycolysis. In such cells the glycolytic sequence consumes much of the available Pi and NAD+, which limits their availability for oxidative phosphorylation. As a result, rate of oxidative phosphorylation decreases, and oxygen consumption also shows a corresponding fall.",

In the presence of ATP and coenzyme A, the enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase (thiokinase) catalyzes the conversion of a fatty acid (or FFA) to an \"active fatty acid\" or acyl-CoA, using one high-energy phosphate and forming AMP and PPi. The PPi is hydrolyzed by inorganic pyrophosphatase with the loss of a further high-energy phosphate, ensuring that the overall reaction goes to completion.

The activity of telomerase, the main enzyme involved in synthesizing telomeres, is frequently elevated in cancer cells, providing one mechanism for overcoming telomere shortening.

        "question": "Some m. RNA has self-splicing activity. The removal of introns is/are done by",
        "exp": "In molecular biology and genetics, splicing is a modification of an RNA after transcription, in which introns are removed and exons are joined. This is needed for the typical eukaryotic messenger RNA before it can be used to produce a correct protein through translation. For many eukaryotic introns, splicing is done in a series of reactions which are catalyzed by the spliceosome a complex of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (sn. RNAs), but there are also self-splicing introns. Self-splicing Self-splicing occurs for rare introns that form a ribozyme, performing the functions of the spliceosome by RNA alone. There are three kinds of self-splicing introns, Group I, Group II and Group III. Group I and II introns perform splicing similar to the spliceosome without requiring any protein. This similarity suggests that Group I and II introns may be evolutionarily related to the spliceosome. Self-splicing may also be very ancient and may have existed in an RNA world present before protein. Although the two splicing mechanisms described below do not require any proteins to occur, 5 additional RNA molecules and over 50 proteins are used and hydrolyzes many ATP molecules. The splicing mechanisms use ATP in order to accurately splice m. RNA's. If the cell were to not use any ATP's the process would be highly inaccurate and many mistakes would occur. Two transesterifications characterize the mechanism in which group I introns are spliced: 3' OH of a free guanine, nucleoside (or one located in the intron) or a nucleotide cofactor (GMP, GDP, GTP) attacks phosphate at the 5' splice site. 3' OH of the 5 'exon becomes a nucleophile and the second transesterification results in the joining of the two exons. The mechanism in which group II introns are spliced (two transesterification reaction like group I introns) is as follows: The 2'OH of a specific adenosine in the intron attacks the 5' splice site, thereby forming the lariat. The 3'OH of the 5' exon triggers the second transesterification at the 3' splice site thereby joining the exons together. Spliceosomal and self-splicing transesterification reactions occur via two sequential transesterification reactions. First, the 2' OH of a specific branch point nucleotide within the intron that is defined during spliceosome assembly performs a nucleophilic attack on the first nucleotide of the intron at the 5' splice site forming the lariat intermediate. Second, the 3' OH of the released 5' exon then performs a nucleophilic attack at the last nucleotide of the intron at the 3' splice site thus joining the exons and releasing the intron lariat. '",

        "question": "Fructose 2-6 bisphosphate (F26. BP) regulates glycolysis at the level of?",
        "exp": "Regulation of glycolysis Glycolysis is regulated at 3 steps which are irreversible. These reactions are catalyzed by following key enzymes: (1) Hexokinase and glucokinase, (2) Phosphofructokinase I, and (3) Pyruvate kinase. Hexokinase and glucokinase. These enzymes catalyze the first step of glycolysis, i. e., Glucose --> Glucose-6-phosphate. Glucokinase is found in liver, Whereas hexokinase is found in all tissues. Kinetic propeies of these two are different. Hexokinase has low Km, i. e., high affinity for glucose, low Vmax, and is subjected to feedback inhibition by the reaction product, glucose-6-phosphate. Hexokinase is found in most of the tissue except liver and comes into play when blood glucose is low. It is not affected by feeding or insulin. Hexokinase is not specific for glucose metabolism, it is also involved in metabolism of fructose and galactose. Glucokinase, on the other hand, is specific for glucose. It has high Km (i. e., low affinity for glucose), high Vmax and unlike hexokinase, it is not inhibited by glucose-6-phosphate. As it has low affinity for glucose (high km), it comes into play only when intracellular glucose concentration is high. It is induced by feeding and insulin. Glucagon inhibits glucokinase. Function of hexokinase is to provide glucose-6-phosphate at a constant rate, according the needs of cells, i. e., function of hexokinase is to provide constant glucose utilization by all tissues of body even when blood sugar is low. Function of glucokinase in the liver is to remove glucose from blood after a meal, providing glucose-6phosphate in excess of requirement for glycolysis so that it can be used for glycogen synthesis and lipogenesis. Phosphofructokinase IPhosphofructokinase I is the major regulatory enzyme of glycolysis. It catalyzes the 3rd reaction of glycolysis, i. e., fructose-6-P Fructose 1, 6 bis-P. This reaction is irreversible and is the \"rate -limiting step\" for glycolysis. It is also the \"commeted step\", meaning that once fructose 1, 6 bisphophate is formed it must go for the glycolytic pathway only. So, most impoant control point for glycolysis is through regulation of phosphofructokinase I. Phosphofructokinase - I is allosterically activated by: Fructose-6-phosphate, fructose 2, 6-bisphophate, AMP, ADP, K+ and phosphate. It is allosterically inhibited by: ATP, citrate, Ca+2, Mg+2, and low pH. Phosphofructokinase is an inducible enzyme that increases its synthesis in response to insulin and decreases in response to glucagon. Fructose 2, 6-bisphosphate (F-2, 6-BP) is the most impoant allosteric modulator (activator) of phosphofructokinase-I. Fructose 2, 6-bisphosphate is synthesized as a side product of glycolysis. A bifunctional enzyme named PFK-2/Fructose 2, 6 bisphosphatase is responsible for regulating the level of fructose 2, 6 bisphosphate in the liver. Phosphofuctokinase-2 (PFK-2) activity of this bifunctional enzyme is responsible for synthesis of F-2, 6-BP from fructose-6-phosphate and fructose 2, 6 bisphosphatase activity is responsible for hydrolysis of F-2, 6-BP back to fructose-6-phosphate.",

In general, polypeptides with 100 or more aminoacids are called proteins, and those with fewer than 100 amino acids are referred to as peptides. Proteins and peptide hormones are synthesized on the rough ER. They are usually synthesized first as larger proteins (precursors) that are not biologically active (preprohormone) and cleaved in the ER to form smaller prohormones. These are then transferred to the Golgi apparatus for packing into secretory vesicles. In this process, enzymes in the vesicles cleave the prohormones to produce smaller, biologically active hormones and inactive fragments. Vesicles are stored into cytoplasm and secretion of the hormones occur by exocytosis. The peptide/protein hormones are:? Hypothalamus:- Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), coicotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), Growth-hormone releasing hormone (GHRh), Growth hormone inhibitory hormone (GHIn), i. e., somatostatin, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gn. RH). Anterior pituitary:- Growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone (THS) or thyrotropin, adrenocoicotropin hormone (ACTH), prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leutinizing hormone (LH). Posterior pituitary: - Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)/vasopressin, oxytocin. Thyroid gland: - Calcitonin. Pancreas: - Insulin, glucagon. Parathyroid: - Parathormone. Placenta: - Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), Human somatomammotropin. Kidney: - Renin, erythropoietin. Heart: - Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Stomach: - Gastrin.

        "question": "One of your patients is diagnosed with retinoblastoma. He has a single tumor in one eye. The patient is worried whether his children would suffer from the same condition. What test could be used to determine whether it is a heritable or sporadic tumor?",
        "exp": "Foy percent of retinoblastomas are heritable; the child inherits one mutant allele through the germline and a somatic mutation in the other allele occurs, resulting in the loss of function of that gene. This leads to tumor development, often with multiple tumors in both eyes. Penetrance, however, is not complete, since the second mutation is a chance event. Sixty percent of retinoblastomas are sporadic; both alleles are inactivated by somatic mutation. Because this is a rare event, tumors usually are in only one eye and present at a later age. To detect a mutation in the Rb gene and differentiate between heritable and sporadic cases of retinoblastoma, PCR is the most appropriate technique of the choices given. Using the appropriate primers, a deletion can be detected as a change in size of the DNA band amplified. In heritable cases, one chromosome will show the altered length from the deletion or the translocation in any cell in the body. In sporadic retinoblastoma, samples isolated from anywhere other than the tumor should have two normal alleles. DNA footprinting is a protocol used to detect specific protein binding to DNA molecules by comparing the fragmentation patterns of DNA bound with the protein of interest vs. unbound DNA following digestion with DNase I. If the bound protein protects against DNase I digestion, the position of the protein on the DNA can be deduced by the loss of the characteristic fragment. FACS uses antibodies coupled to fluorescent markers to determine cell surface molecules on whole cells. It is very useful for determining the stage of development or activation of cells, but does not give you any insight into the DNA. Nohern blotting, the RNA counterpa to Southern blotting, will determine the size and abundance of m. RNA of a specific gene in a given sample of RNA. RNA is not able to be cleaved by restriction enzymes the way the DNA can; however, RNA molecules for different proteins are of different lengths. The sample is separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with a specific, labeled probe. This will be exposed to film and the bands will appear, revealing the size and the abundance of specific m. RNAs.",

        "question": "In starvation, there is ketosis due to?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Increased b-oxidation. Starvation is characterized by decreased insulin: glucagon ratio. This causes:? i) Increased lipolysis - More FFAs for ketogenesis. ii) Increased fi-oxidation - Increased ketogenosis. iii) Decreased oxaloacetate - Acetyl CoA is utilized in ketogenesis. Regulation of ketogenesis. Ketogenesis is regulated at three levels:? 1) Factors regulating mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissues (i. e. lipolysis):- Free fatty acids, the precursors of ketone bodies, arise from lipolysis of triglycerides in adipose tissue. Hence, factors which enhance lipolysis (e. g. glucagon) stimulate ketogensis by providing more free fatty acids. Conversely, factors that inhibit lipolysis (e. g. insulin) inbibit ketogenesis. 2) Factors regulating b-oxidation of fatty acids:- After uptake by liver, FAAs are either (i) b-oxidized to CO, or ketone bodies, or (ii) esterified to triacylglycerol. Carnitine acetyl transferase-I (CAT-I) regulates the b-oxidation of fatty acid and therefore the production of staing materials of ketogenesis i. e. acetyl. CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA (The remainder of fatty acids which do not enter b-oxidation, are estesified). Activity of CAT-1 is high in starvation and diabetes leading to increased b-oxidation of fatty acids and increased ketogenesis. CAT-1 activity is low in well fed state, resulting in decreased 13-oxidation and ketogenesis. This regulation is governed by Malonyl CoA, which is an allosteric inhibitor of carnitine acetyl transferase-1: CAT-1 (or carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1: (CPT-1). Malonyl CoA is synthesized by acetyl CoA carboxylase. Activity of acetyl CoA carboxylase is high in well fed state due to increase in insulin/ glucagon ratio, which inturn results in increased formation of malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA inhibits CAT-I (CPT-I) leading to decreased b-oxidation and ketogenesis. Hence, esterification of fatty acids is increased. Conversely, during starvation (and diabetes) insulin/glucagon ratio is decreased which results in decreased activity of acetyl CoA carboxylase and decreased production of malonyl-CoA, releasing the inhibition of CAT-I (CPT-I). This results in increase b-oxidation of fatty acids and ketogenesis. 3) Factors regulating the oxidation of acetyl CoA:- The acetyl-CoA formed in b-oxidation is oxidized in the citric acid cycle, or it enters the ketogenesis to form ketone bodies. When oxaloacetate concentration is low, little acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle and ketogenesis is oured (first reaction of TCA cycle inolves oxaloacetate, where it combines with acetyl-CoA to form citrate). Concentration of oxalaceatate is lowered if carbohydrate is unavailable or improperly utilized, e. g. in fasting and in diabetes.",

        "exp": "Positively charged (cationic) amino acids are attracted to the negative electrode (the cathode), and negatively charged (anionic) amino acids are attracted to the positive electrode (the anode). An amino acid at its isoelectric point has no net charge, so it does not move. So at the physiological pH, amino acid with positive charge will move slowest towards the anode (positively charged electrode). Thus lysine will migrate slowest to the anode end. Electrophoresis uses differences in isoelectric points to separate mixtures of amino acids. A streak of the amino acid mixture is placed in the center of a layer of acrylamide gel or a piece of filter paper wet with a buffer solution. Two electrodes are placed in contact with the edges of the gel or paper, and a potential of several thousand volts is applied across the electrodes. Positively charged (cationic) amino acids are attracted to the negative electrode (the cathode), and negatively charged (anionic) amino acids are attracted to the positive electrode (the anode). An amino acid at its isoelectric point has no net charge, so it does not move. Amino acid classification:- Acidic Amino acids: These amino acids have two - COOH groups and one -Nil, group. At neutral pH their side chains are fully ionized containing a negatively charged carboxylate group (-COO). Eg.

This decreases the number of glucose transpoers which are insulin dependent. Insulin dependent glucose transpoers are GLUT-4, present in adipocytes, skeletal and cardiac muscles. Rest of the glucose transpoers are not insulin dependent. Harper writes-\"Glucose uptake into muscle and adipose tissue is controlled by insulin, which is secreted by the B islet cells of the pancreas in response to an increased concentration of glucose in the poal blood. An early response to insulin in muscle and adipose tissue is the migration of glucose transpoer vesicles to the cell surface, exposing active glucose transpoers (GLUT 4). These insulin-sensitive tissues will only take up glucose from the blood stream to any significant extent in the presence of the hormone. As insulin secretion falls in the starved state, so the transpoers are internalized again, reducing glucose uptake\" Glucose Transpoers Glucose enters cells either by facilitated diffusion or by secondary active transpo with No+ (in the intestine and kidneys) Glucose transpoers are a family of membrane proteins that are responsible for facilitated diffusion of glucose across cell membranes. They differ from and have no homology with the sodium-dependent glucose transpoers, SGLT 1 and SGLT 2, responsible for the secondary active transpo of glucose in the intestine and renal tubules. Seven different glucose transpoers, named GLUT 1-7 in order of discovery. have been characterized. Each transpoer appears to have evolved for special tasks.

Cyclin D, which is the first cyclin to increase in cell cycle, (appears in GI phase but becomes detectable in S phase) activates CDK4 and form cyclin D- CDK4 complex that phosphorylates RB.

The ability to form the maximum number of hydrogen bonds, supplemented by van der Waals interactions in the core of this tightly packed structure, provides the thermodynamic driving force for the formation of an alpha helix. Since the peptide bond nitrogen of proline lacks a hydrogen atom to contribute to a hydrogen bond, proline can only be stably accommodated within the first turn of an alpha helix.

Insulin increases the recruitment of GLUT to the surface of various cells and thus increases the uptake of insulin various cells. Insulin has got inhibitory effect on adenylyl cyclase activity and so cause dephosphorylation. Insulin increases the activity of acetyl CoA carboxylase activity and thus has got stimulatory effect on lipogenesis. Also Know: Pyruvate Dehydrogenase is also regulated by Acyl-CoA: Acyl-CoA causes an inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase by inhibiting the ATP-ADP exchange transpoer of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which leads to increased intramitochondrial (ATP)/(ADP) ratios and therefore to conversion of active to inactive pyruvate dehydrogenase, thus regulating the availability of acetyl-CoA for lipogenesis. Fuhermore, oxidation of acyl-CoA due to increased levels of free fatty acids may increase the ratios of (acetyl-CoA)/(CoA) and (NADH)/(NAD+) in mitochondria, inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase. Insulin Also Regulates Lipogenesis by Other Mechanisms: Insulin stimulates lipogenesis by several other mechanisms as well as by increasing acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity. It increases the transpo of glucose into the cell (eg, in adipose tissue), increasing the availability of both pyruvate for fatty acid synthesis and glycerol 3-phosphate for esterification of the newly formed fatty acids, and also conves the inactive form of pyruvate dehydrogenase to the active form in adipose tissue, but not in liver. Insulin also--by its ability to depress the level of intracellular c. AMP--inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue and reducing the concentration of plasma-free fatty acids and, therefore, long-chain acyl-CoA, which are inhibitors of lipogenesis. Ref: Botham K.

Myoglobin has only one polypeptide chain, thus there is no question of bonding between subunits. However, this should not be confused that there is no bonds in myoglobin. Myoglobin has secondary and tertiary structure which are stabilized by non-covalent bonds. Polypeptide chain of myoglobin is compactly folded so that the non-polar (hydrophobic) amino acids lies in the interior forming hydrophobic bonds and polar (hydrophilic) amino acid on the exterior surface forming hydrogen and electrostatic (ionic bonds).

However, the space between the H helices of the chains lining the cavity is sufficiently wide to accommodate BPG only when hemoglobin is in the T state. BPG forms salt bridges with the terminal amino groups of both chains Val NA1 and with Lys EF6 and His H21. BPG therefore stabilizes deoxygenated (T-state) hemoglobin by forming additional salt bridges that must be broken prior to conversion to the R state. Residue H21 of the subunit of HbF is Ser rather than His. Since Ser cannot form a salt bridge, BPG binds more weakly to HbF than to HbA. The lower stabilization afforded to the T state by BPG accounts for HbF having a higher affinity for O2 than HbA. Ref: Kennelly P. J., Rodwell V. W. (2011). Chapter 6.

Thus total 9 ATP molecules are produced and 2 are utilized, i. e., There is net gain of 7 ATP molecules in aerobic glycolysis. In anaerobic conditions, the reoxidation of NADH by electron transpo chain is prevented and NADH gets reoxidized by conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Thus, in anaerobic glycolysis only 4 ATP are produced at substrate level. Therefore, there is net gain of 2 ATP molecules in anaerobic glycolysis. Note: - Previous calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH2 generates 2 ATPs. This will amount to a net generation of 8. ATPs per glucose molecule during glycolysis. Recent experiments show that these old values are overestimates and NADH produces 2. 5 ATPs and FADH2 produces 1. 5 ATPs. Thus, net generation is only 7. ATPs during glycolysis.",

Tissue injury releases a characteristic pattern of LDH isoenzymes that can be separated by electrophoresis. The blood test most commonly used to confirm the existence of heart muscle damage is the creatine kinase/CK. CK-MB shows an increase above normal in a person's blood test about six hours after the sta of a heart attack. It reaches its peak level in about 24 hours and returns to normal in 48 to 72 hours. The peak level and the return to normal can be delayed in a person who's had a large heart attack, especially if they don't get early and aggressive treatment. Tests can measure the level of other cardiac muscle proteins called troponins specifically troponin T (c. TnT) and troponin I (c. TnI). These proteins control the interactions between actin and myosin, which contracts or squeezes the heart muscle. Troponins specific to heart muscle have been found, allowing the development of blood tests (assays) that can detect minor heart muscle injury (\"microinfarction\") not detected by CK-MB. Normally the level of c. TnT and c. TnI in the blood is very low. It increases substantially within several hours (on average four to six hours) of muscle damage.

The pyruvate is fermented (reduced) to lactate in single stage. The reoxidation of NADH (formed in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase step) by respiratory chain is prevented as same NADH is utilized at lactate dehydrogenase step. So, there is no net production of NADH. Thus, there is net gain of 2 ATP only. Unlike pyruvate which is conveed to acetyl CoA to enter into krebs cycle, lactate cannot be fuher utilized by fuher metabolic pathways. Thus, lactate can be regareded as dead end in glycolysis.

Inhibitor resembles substrate in structural configuration. Inhibition can be reversed by increasing the concentration of substrate. Competitive inhibition increases km of the enzyme but Vmax does not change. Examples of competitive inhibition are inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase by malonate, HMG CoA reductase by statins, carbonic anhydrase by acetazolamide and LDH by oxamate. ii) Non-competitive inhibition Inhibitor binds at a site other than the substrate-binding site. Thus inhibitor can bind to both free enzyme and enzyme substrate complex. The inhibitor therefore lowers the concentration of active enzyme.

        "question": "Main pa of surfactant is formed by?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline Impoant glycerophospholipids are:? Phosphatidylcholine (lecithin):- These glycerophospholipids contain choline. These are most abundant phospholipids in cell membrane. Dipalmitoyl lecithin (dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine) is an impoant phosphatidylcholine found in lungs, secreted by type II pneumocytes. It acts as a lung surfactant and is necessary for normal lung compliance. It reduces surface tension in alveoli and prevents alveolar collapse. Acute pulmonary respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants is due to inefficient production of surfactant dipalmitoyl lecithin (dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine). Phosphatidylethanolamine (cephaline):- They have ethanolamine instead of choline. Thromboplastin (coagulation factor 111) is composed of cephaline. Like lecithin, Phosphatidylethanolamine is also a component of cell membrane. Phosphatidylserine:- They have serine nitrogenous base. Phosphatidylserine is also a componant of cell membrane. It plays a role in apoptosis. Phosphatidylinositol:- They have inositol as the stereoisomers, myoinositol. Phosphatidylinositol4, 5? bisphosphate is an impoant constituent of cell membrane phospholipids, upon stimulation by a suitable hormone agonist, it is cleaved into diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate both of which act as second messengers. Plasmalogens:- Plasmalogens are similar to other glycerophospholipids but fatty acid at Cl of glycerol is linked through an ether, rather than ester bond as occurs in other glycerophospholipids. So, plasmalogen is called ether glycerolipid. Plasmalogens are found in brain (myelin) and cardiac muscles. Plasmalogen is a platelet activating factor (PAF) and involved in platelet aggregation and degranulation. Lysophospholipids:- Lysophospholipids are formed when one of the two fatty acid is removed from glycerophospholipids (i. e. Lysophospholipids=glycerophospholipid-1 fatty acid or lysophospholipids=glyceral + phosphoric acid + 1 fatty acid + nitrogenous base). Most common of these are lysophosphatidykholine (lysolecithine) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lysocephalin). Cardiolipin (Diphosphatidylglycerol):- Cardiolipin' is composed of two molecules of phosphatidic acid connected by a molecule of glycerol, i. e. cardiolipin phosphatidic acid + glycerol + phosphatidic acid. There is no nitrogenous base. Cardiolipin is a major lipid of inner mitochondrial membrane and is necessary for optimum functioning of ETC.",

        "question": "Frame shift mutation causes?",
        "exp": "Mutations A mutation is a permanant change in the DNA. Mutations that affect germ cells (sperm or ovum) are transmitted to progeny and may give rise to inherited disease. Mutations that affect somatic cells are not transmitted to progeny but are impoant in the genesis of cancers and congenital malformations. Mutations may be classified into three categories - 1. Gene mutations The vast majority of mutations associated with hereditary disease are gene mutations. These may of different types depending whether it involves complete gene or single base -(a) Point mutation A single nucleotide base is subustituted by a different base. When a pyrimidine base is subustituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine Transition. When a purine is substituded by a pyrimidine or vice-versa Transversion. This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i. e. in codon and leads to replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product. Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation. Example is sickle mutation in which CTC codon in 3-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid is changed to CAC codon that codes for valine. Another type of point mutation is nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon. Example is 3-thalassemia in which CAG codon in 3-chain of hemoglobin that code for glutamin is changed to stop codon UAG after point mutation. Deletion and inseions Deletion or inseion of one or two base lead to alterations in the reading frame of the DNA strand --> frame shift mutation. If the number of base pairs invoved is three or a multiple of three framshift does not occur (because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized. (c) Trinucleotide repeat mutation Normally a codon is triplet ie trinucleotide. In this type of mutation a codon, ie trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain. For example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeater of CGG. 2. Chromosome mutation Result from rearrangement of genetic material that give rise to visible structural changes in the chromosome. 3. Genome mutation Involves loss or gain of whole chromosome, e. g. monosomy - Turner syndrome, trisomy - Down syndrome.",

Most cases appear to be due to three mutations. A transversion (T - G) mutation is the most common among adults with this disorder. This mutation interrupts a site of RNA splicing. The gene encodes a protein--acid alpha-glucosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 20)--which is a lysosomal hydrolase. The protein is an enzyme that normally degrades the alpha -1, 4 and alpha -1, 6 linkages in glycogen, maltose and isomaltose and is required for the degradation of 1-3% of cellular glycogen.

Albinism is an autosomal recessive disease with defective melanin synthesis. In this condition tyrosinase is completely absent leading to defective synthesis of melanin. Type I Tyrosinemia is an inborn error of metabolism caused by a deficiency of fumarylacetoacetase, the last enzyme involved in tyrosine degradation pathway. It results in the accumulation of fumarylacetoacetate, maleylacetoacetate and succinylacetone which inturn cause liver and kidney damage.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Chylomicrons. Transpo of dietary lipids It is the transpo of lipid from intestine to liver. Chylomicrons transpo the dietry lipid from intestine to livere. In diet the major lipids are triglyceride and cholesterol. Cholesterol is absorbed as such in proximal small intestine and is esterified to cholesteryl ester (ChE). Triglycerides are hydrolysed by lipases to glycerol and fatty acids which are absorbed in intestine. Inside intestinal cells triglyceride is synthesized by fatty acids. Chylomicrons are synthesized in the small intestine that contain triglyceride, cholesteryl ester, cholesterol, phosphlipids, and apoprotein B-48 (apo B-48) and apo-A. These chylomicrons are secreted in the intestinal lymph and reach the systemic circulation thoracic duct. In the circulation apo E and apo C are transfered to chylomicrons by HDL, so now chylomicrons contain apo A, apo B-48, apo- E, & apo-C. In the circulation, triglycerides of chylomicrons are hydrolysed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) present on endothelial cells of vessels of skeletal muscles, adipose tissue and heart, but not in liver. The released fatty acids are utilized locally by these tissues. Adipose tissue uses these fatty acids to restore them as TGs and heart and skeletal muscle use them as source of energy. Thus, function of chylomicrons is to transpo exogenous (dietry)triglycerideQ to adipose tissue (for storage), heart (for energy) and muscle (for energy). The chylomicron paicle progressively shrinks in size by action of LPL and, cholesterol, phospholipids, apo-A and apo C are transferred to HDL, creating chylomicron remnants that contains more cholesterol, less triglycerides, apo-E & apo B-48. Chylomicron remnants are removed by liver by the LDL receptors that require apo-E as ligand.",

But based on calculations from its amino acid residues, p53 's mass is actually only 43. 7 K Da. o p53 prevents neoplastic transformation by three interlocking mechanisms:? 1. Activation of temporary cell cycle arrest (quiescence) o It is considered as the primordial response to DNA damage. o p53 causes arrest in late GI through p2 I. o This is temporary arrest that gives the cell \"breathing time\" to repair DNA damage. o After DNA repair, cell cycle block is relieved by MDM-3 which degrades p53. 2. Induction of permanent cell cycle arrest (senescence) o p53 induced sencence is a permanent cell cycle arrest characterized by specific changes in morphology and gene expression that differentiate it from quiescence (temporary or reversible cycle arrest). o The mechanisms of senscence is unknown, but involve epigenetic changes that result in the formation of heterochromatin at different loci throughout the genome. 3. Triggering of programmed cell death o p53 directs the transcription of several pro-apoptotic genes such as BAX and PUMA (approved name BBC3) and induces apoptosis. o It has been shown that p53 activates transcription of the mir 34 family of micro RNAs (mi.

Therefore, to work as a best buffer at physiological pH amino acid should have pka value close to physiological pH (7. 4). Amino acids can have buffering action due to three ionizable groups:- 1) a-carboxyl group- Different amino acids have pka value of c-carboxyl group between 3. 5-4. So carboxyl group of amino acids has maximum buffering capacity between pH 3. 5-4. 2) a-amino group:- Different amino acids have pka value of c-amino group between 8. 0-9. 0. Thus, a-amino group has maximum buffering capacity between pH 8. 0-9. 0. 3) Special ionizable group (in some amino acids) - Among special ionizable group of amino acids, imidazole group of histidine has pka value 6. 5-7. 4, which is closest to physiological pH. Hence, histidine (due to imidazole group) has maximum buffering capacity at physiologial pH.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Overlapping Characteristic of genetic codes. Genetic codes have following characteristics? 1. Universal:- Each codon specifically codes for same amino acid in all species, e. g. UCA codes for serine and CCA codes for proline in all organisms. That means specificity of codon has been conserved from very early stages of evolution. Exception to the universality of genetic coder are found in human mitochondria, where the code: -UGA codes for tryptophan instead of serving as a stop codon. AUA codes for methionine instead of isoleucine? CUA codes for threonine instead of leucine. AGA and AGG serve as stop codon instead of coding for arginine. 2. Unambiguous/Specific:- A paicular codon always codes for the same amino acid. For example CCU always codes for proline and UGG always codes for tryptophan. 3. Degeneracy/Redundancy:- A given amino acid may have more than one codon. For example, CCU, CCC, CCA and CCG all four codons code for proline. Therefore, there are 61 codons for 20 amino acids. 4. Stop or termination or nonsense codons:- Three of the 64 possible nucleotide triplets UAA(amber), UAG (Ochre) and UGA (opal) do not code for any amino acid. They are called nonsense codons that normally signal termination of polypeptide chains. Thus, though there are 64 possible triplet codons, only 61 codes for 20 amino acids (as remaining three are non-sense codons). 5. Non overlapping and nonpuntate (Comma less):- During translation, the code is read sequentially, without spacer bases, from a fixed staing point, as a continuous sequence of bases, taken 3 at a time, e. g. AUGCUA GACUUU is read as AUG/CUA/GAC/UUU without \"ponctation\" (coma) between codons.",

Reaction in gluconeogenesis o Gluconeogenesis involves glycolysis, the citric acid cycle plus some special reactions. Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis share the same pathway but in opposite direction. Seven reactions of glycolysis are reversible and therefore are used with same enzyme in the synthesis of glucose by gluconeogenesis. However, three of the reactions of glycolysis are irreversible and must be circumvented by four special reactions which are unique to gluconeogenesis and catalyzed by: (I) Pyruvate carboxylase, (ii) Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, Fructose-I, 6-bisphosphatase, (iv) Glucose-6-phosphatase. These four enzymes are the key enzymes of gluconeogenesis (or gluconeogenesis enzymes). Among these four, pyruvate carboxylase is a mitocondrial enzyme and other three are cytoplasmic enzymes. All three irreversible steps of glycolysis should be bypassed for gluconeogenesis to occur. These three bypass steps are circumvented by four special reactions. A) First bypass (conversion of pyruvate into phosphoenol pyruvate):- Conversion of pyruvate into phosphoenol pyruvate takes place through two reactions:? i) Carboxylation of pyruvate: - First, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is conveed into oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase. Pyruvate carboxylase is a mitochondrial enzyme, therefore this reactions occurs in mitochondria only. ii) Conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate: - Oxaloacetate produced in the mitrochondria cannot cross the membrane. It is first reduced to malate, which then moves across the mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. Malate is, then, reoxidized to oxaloacetate in the cytosol. Oxaloacetate is conveed to phosphoenol pyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase. B) Second bypass: - Conversion of fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate into fructose-6-phosphate is catalyzed by fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase. Its presence determines whether a tissue is capable of synthesizing glucose (gluconeogenesis) or glycogen (glyconeogenesis) not only from pyruvate, but also from triose phosphate. It is present in liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle, but is probably absent from heart and smooth muscle.

Twenty cycles provide an amplification of 106 (million) and 30 cycles of 109 (billion). PCR occurs in following steps -i) Isolation of target DNA sequence:- A DNA containing the sequences to be amplified is isolated. ii) Primers construction:- The sequence of flanking region (nucleotide sequence of sho segments on each side of target DNA sequence) are used to construct 2 single stranded oligonucleotides which are complementary to the respective flanking region. These oligonucleotides functions as primers in PCR reaction. iii) Denaturation of DNA:- Target DNA is heated to separate the double strand of DNA into single strands. iv) Annealing of primers to single stranded DNA:- The separated strands are cooled and allowed to anneal to the two primers, one for each strand. v) Chain extension:- DNA polymerase and deoxyribonucleotides (d. NTP) are added to the mixture. DNA polymer? ase (Taq polymerase) then uses the primer for DNA synthesis using target strands as templates. On both strands, Primer is amplified in 5'-43' direction by addition of nucleotides (d. NTP) at 3' end. The mixture is once again heated to melt (separate) all double stranded structure. There are now four strands of DNA. A second cycle of cooling, allows fuher binding of the primers and a second round of polymerization is repeated. The process of heating (denaturation), cooling (annealing) and polymerization is repeated many times. As Taq polymerase is not denatured on heating and therefore does not have to be added at each successive cycle.

        "exp": "Radiolabelled DNA probe Polymerase Chain Reaction. PCR is a cell-free, test tube method for amplifying a target sequence of DNA. It is much faster and more sensitive than cell-based cloning. Materials required: Two primers, each about 20-35 bases long with sequence complementary to the sequence immediately adjacent to the DNA segment of interest ( flanking sequence). DNA polymerase (e. g., Taq polymerase) which can sustain high temperature (> 600 C). A large number of free deoxynucleotides (d. NTPs). The target DNA fragment. Procedure: There are three major steps in a PCR, which are repeated for 20 or 30 cycles. a. Heat Denaturation- The DNA sample to be amplified is first heated to separate the two strandsb. Annealing- The primers bind to the two separated strands of DNA ( one for each strand ) flanking the target sequence. c. Extension- Each strand is copied by the DNA polymerase, staing at the primer site. The two DNA strands each serve as a template for the synthesis of new DNA from the two primers. The above three steps are repeated again and again. The number of copies doubles in each cycle. Typically 20-30 cycles are run during this process. There is an exponential increase in the amount of target DNA, amplifying it by a million-fold to a billion-fold. By using a heat stable DNA polymerase( Taq polymerase ), the polymerase is not denatured and, therefore does not have to be added at each successive cycle. Advantages: The major advantage of PCR over cloning as a mechanism for amplifying a specific DNA sequence aresensitivity: DNA sequences present in only trace amounts can be amplified to become the predominant sequencespeedless technically difficult than traditional cloning methods using recombinant DNA techniques. Disadvantages: To synthesize primers, we need to know the sequence flanking the DNA segment of interest. Applies only to sho DNA fragments, typically less than 10 kb.",

The substrate bind to the active site of the enzyme by noncovalent interactions like hydrogen bond, ionic (electrostatic) bond and hydrophobic bonds. There is confusion between noncovalent van der Waals forces and covalent bond. Some guides have given option `c' as the answer, which is incorrect. \"Enzymes bind to the substrate by a combination of hydrogen and ionic (electrostatic) bonds, as well as by hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions\". \"Most enzyme-substrate combinations are mostly due to noncovalent hydrogen, hydrophobic, ionic (electrostatic) and Van der Waals forces\". \"There is a precise substrate interaction that occurs at the active site of enzyme stabilized by numerous weak interactions (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic contacts, and Van der Walls forces)\". Many other references have mentioned the same. Thus Van der Walls forces are also involved in enzyme substrate reaction. Now we are left with covalent bonds. Covalent bonds are also involved in some enzymatic reactions called covalent catalysis. In which there is the formation of covalent bond between enzyme and substrate. The modified enzyme then becomes a reactant. For example, the serine residue at the active site of chymotrypsin forms a covalent link with the substrate. So, all the four forces given in the options are involved in the enzyme-substrate interaction. However, amongst the given options, I will go for covalent bonds because most of the enzyme-substrate interactions involve weak non-covalent interactions, whereas covalent catalysis mechanism is found only in few enzymes like proteases (chymotrypsin and trypsin) and few others. The best option, in a given scenario, the answer is a covalent bond.",
