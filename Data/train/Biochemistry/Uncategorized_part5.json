Since free ammonia is highly toxic, it is never transpoed in free form in blood.Two mechanisms are available for transpo of ammonia from the peripheral tissues to the liver :1) In the form of glutamineIn many tissues like liver, kidney and brain, ammonia combines with glutamate to yield glutamine, by the action of glutamine synthase. The brain is a rich source of glutamine synthase and it predominantly detoxifies ammonia by this routeGlutamine is a nontoxic major transpo form of ammonia. The glutamine is transpoed by blood to liver where deamination (removal of amino group) of glutamine takes place. Glutaminase cleaves glutamine to yield glutamate and free ammonia ammonium ion). \"[he ammonia is conveed by liver to urea.Formation and secretion ammonia by renal tubular cells maintain acid base balance. Ammonia is formed from glutamine by glutaminase. Excretion of ammonia increases in metabolic acidosis and decreases in metabolic alkalosis. 2) In the form of alanineAlanine transpos ammonia from muscles to liver through glucose-alanine cycle'.In muscle, glutamate is formed from ammonia and a-ketoglutarate by reversal of the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction. L-glutamate then transfers its a-amino group to pyruvate by transmination reaction to form alanine.Alanine is transpoed to liver.

        "question": "Which enzyme is deficient in Marfan's syndrome?",
        "exp": "Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, which encodes a glycoprotein called fibrillin-1, which is essential for the proper formation of the extracellular matrix including the biogenesis and maintenance of elastic fibers. Elastin fibers are found throughout the body but are paicularly abundant in the aoa, ligaments and the ciliary zonules of the eye, consequently these areas are among the worst affected. Although there are no unique signs or symptoms of Marfan syndrome, the constellation of long limbs, dislocated lenses, and aoic root dilation is sufficient to make the diagnosis with confidence. A. Skeletal System The most readily visible signs are associated with the skeletal system. Many individuals with Marfan Syndrome grow to above average height and may have long slender limbs with fingers and toes that are also abnormally long and slender (arachnodactyly). This long, slender body habitus and long, slender limbs are known as dolichostenomelia. Abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis) is common, as is abnormal indentation (pectus excavatum) or protrusion (pectus carinatum) of the sternum. B. Eyes Nearsightedness and astigmatism are common, but farsightedness can also result. Subluxation (dislocation) of the crystalline lens in one or both eyes (ectopia lentis) also occurs In Marfan's the dislocation is typically superotemporal whereas in the similar condition homocystinuria, the dislocation is inferonasal. Sometimes weakening of connective tissue may cause detachment of the retina Early onset glaucoma can be another complication. C. Cardiovascular System The most serious conditions associated with Marfan syndrome involve the cardiovascular system. The major sign is a dilated aoa or an aoic aneurysm. Because of the underlying connective tissue abnormalities that cause Marfan syndrome, there is an increased incidence of dehiscence of prosthetic mitral valve. During pregnancy, even in the absence of preconceived cardiovascular abnormality, women with Marfan syndrome are at significant risk of acute aoic dissection, which can be lethal if untreated. For this reason, women with Marfan syndrome should receive a thorough assessment prior to conception, and echocardiography should be performed every 6-10 weeks during pregnancy, to assess the aoic root diameter. D. Lungs Marfan syndrome is a risk factor for spontaneous pneumothorax. Marfan syndrome has also been associated with sleep apnea and idiopathic obstructive lung disease. E. Central nervous system Another condition that can reduce the quality of life for an individual, though not life-threatening, is dural ectasia, the weakening of the connective tissue of the dural sac. Other spinal issues associated with Marfan include degenerative disk disease and spinal cysts. Following disorders have similar signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome: Congenital Contractural Arachnodactyly (CCA) or Beals Syndrome Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Homocystinuria Loeys-Dietz syndrome MASS phenotype Stickler syndrome Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2B.",

The usual procedure of producing a chromosome spread is to arrest mitosis in dividing cells in metaphase by the use of mitotic spindle inhibitors (e.g.. colcemid) and then to stain the chromosomes. In a metaphase spread, the individual chromosomes take the form of two chromatids connected at the centromere. A karyotype is a standard arrangement of a photographed or imaged stained metaphase spread in which chromosome pairs are arranged in order of decreasing length. A variety of staining methods that allow identification of each individual chromosome on the basis of a distinctive and reliable pattern of alternating light and dark bands along the length of the chromosome have been developed. The one most commonly employed uses a Giemsa stain and is hence called G banding.\" - Robbins Pathology 7/e pl70 A karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes in the nucleus of a eukaryote cell. The term is also used for the complete set of chromosomes in a species, or an individual organism. Karyotypes describe the number of chromosomes, and what they look like under a light microscope. Attention is paid to their length, the position of the centromeres, any differences between the sex chromosomes, and any other physical characteristics. The preparation and study of karyotypes is pa of cytogenetics. The study of karyotypes is made possible by staining. Usually, a suitable dye, such as Giemsa is applied after cells have been arrested during cell division by a solution of colchicine.

The normal reference interval for Hb concentration in women is lower (12.0-16.0 gm/dL) than that for men (13.5-17.5 gm/dL) due to lower serum testosterone levels (testosterone is higher in men and stimulates erythropoiesis) and blood loss during menses. Fuhermore, women normally have about 400 mg of iron (as ferritin) in their bone marrow iron stores versus an average of 1000 mg of iron for men. In the absence of inflammation, the small circulating fraction of ferritin correlates well with ferritin stores in the bone marrow. Hence, men have different reference intervals for serum ferritin than do women (15-200 ng/mL in men versus 12-150 ng/mL in women). The mean corpuscular volume, serum alkaline phosphatase, serum glucose, and serum sodium are similar in both sexes. Ref: Beutler E. (2010). Chapter 42. Disorders of Iron Metabolism. In J.T.

Fe3+ reductase activity is associated with the iron transpoer in the brush borders of the enterocytes. Gastric secretions dissolve the iron and permit it to form soluble complexes with ascorbic acid (Vit C) and other substances that aid its reduction to the Fe2+ form. Implication: Iron deficiency anemia is a troublesome and relatively frequent complication of paial gastrectomy. Impoant Topics - Iron bioavailability is affected by the nature of the foodstuff, with heme iron (e.g. red meat) being most readily absorbed. Vegetarians are at an additional disadvantage because ceain foodstuffs that include phytates and phosphates reduce iron absorption by approximately 50%. Iron absorption takes place largely in the proximal small intestine and is a carefully regulated process. Iron absorption is influenced by a number of physiologic states. Erythroid hyperplasia stimulates iron absorption even in the face of normal or increased iron stores, and hepcidin levels are inappropriately low.

        "exp": "One mechanism by which initiation of translation in eukaryotes is effected is by phosphorylation of a small set (S) residue in the alpha subunit of eIF-2. The factor eIF-2 requires activation by interaction with GTP. The energy of GTP hydrolysis is used during translational initiation, thereby allowing eIF-2 to have GDP bound instead of GTP. In order to reactivate eIF-2, the GDP must be exchanged for DTP. This requires an additional protein of the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) family known as eIF-2B. The phosphorylated form of eIF-2, in the absence of the eIF-2B, is just as active an initiator of translation as the non-phosphorylated form. However, when eIF-2 is phosphorylated, the GDP-bound complex is stabilized and exchanged for GTP is inhibited. When eIF-2 is phosphorylated, it binds eIF-2B more tightly, thus slowing the rate of exchange. It is this inhibited exchange that affects the rate of initiation. Within reticulocytes, the phosphorylation of eIF-2 is the result of the activity called heme-controlled inhibitor (HCI). Ref: Kennelly P.J., Rodwell V.W. (2011). Chapter 6.

        "exp": "In most biochemical pathways, only one to a few enzymatic reactions are under regulatory control. These often occur either at the beginning of pathways or at pathway branch points. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex controls the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, and decarboxylates pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis) with production of NADH and acetyl CoA (the substrate for the citric acid cycle). Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in mitochondria is huge, visible as dots by electron microscopy, because it is composed of many copies of at least 5 separate enzymes. Three of these (pyruvate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, and dihydrolipoate dehydrogenase) perform the actual biochemical reactions. The other two, PDH kinase and phosphatase, add or remove phosphate groups from the PDH complex, respectively. The more active form of PDH is not phosphorylated; the less active form is. In exercise, high ADP and pyruvate concentrations inhibit PDH kinase, while increased Ca2+ stimulates PDH phosphatase. Both effects produce more of the dephosphorylated, more active form of PDH. Impoant Points - A higher, not decreased, concentration of ADP is seen with exercise and tends to turn PDH on. Intracellular calcium is increased, not decreased, with exercise and tends to turn PDH on. Increased acetyl CoA, as seen in active lipolysis, tends to turn PDH off. Ref: Bender D.A., Mayes P.A.

Secondary structure of protein refers to description of steric relationship (spatial arrangement) between aminoacids located relatively near each other in a selected segment of main polypeptide chain, without regard to the conformation of its side chains or its relationship to other segments. Examples of secondary structures include a-helix, pleated sheet and 13 turns etc. Naturally occurring L-aminoacids can (theoretically) form either right or left handed a-helices, but extended left handed a? helices are theoretically less stable and have not been observed in proteinsQ. Proline and glycine have the least tendency (proclivity) to form a-helicesQ. Large number of charged aminoacids like aspaate (aspaic acid)Q, glutamate (glutamic acid), arginine, lysine or histidine can also disrupt a-helix by forming ionic bonds or electrostatically repelling each other. Secondary structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds & disulfide bonds; Cooperative hydrogen bonding in repeating secondary structures have an impoant role in guiding the protein folding processQ. However , location of bends (including l turns) in polypeptide chain and the direction and angle of these turns are determined by the numer & location of specific bend producing aminoacid residues, such as Pro, Thr, Ser, and Gly. Interacting segments of polypeptide chains are held in their characteristic teiary (3-dimensional) positions by several kinds of weak interactionsQ (mainly hydrophobic bonds, vanderwall forces, ionic interactions) and sometimes by covalent bonds (such as disulfide cross links) between the segments. Some proteins contain 2 polypeptide chains or subunits which may be identical (homo) or different (hetero). Quaernary structure of protein refers to three dimensional arrangement of these protein subunits. Therefore, homo-or hetero-dimers formed between 2 polypeptide chains is an example of quaternary structureQ. Similarly an immunoglobin molecule represents hetero-tetrameric quaernary structure between 4 polypeptide (2 heavy + 2 light) chains.",

All non-covalent bonds that maintain higher order structure are disrupted, but peptide bond (covalent bond) remains intact. Thus, the primary structure is not altered during denaturation, i.e., amino acid sequence is not altered, but denaturation may completely disrupt secondary, teiary and quaternary structure, e.g., denaturated oligomeric proteins dissociated into subunits, each with a randam coil formation. Thus denaturation is randamization of conformation of polypeptide chain without disruption of primary structure (amino acid sequence).Denaturation is always accompanied by a loss of biological function, e.g., enzymes are inactivated and antibodies fail to act with antigens. Denaturation is generally irreversible, e.g., boiled egg does not regain its original form when kept in cold. Denatured proteins are less soluble and in many cases they precipitate.Denaturation causing agents may be heat, detergents and organic solvents, strong acid and bases, 8M urea or 6 M guanidine chloride, heavy metal ions, trichloroacetic acid, and physical agents (X-rays, UV rays, high pressure).",

Biopsy revealed binucleated acidophilic owl eye appearance with floating lymphocytes in empty space, which was CD 15, CD 30 positive. The most probable diagnosis is Hodgkin's lymphoma. Nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity and lymphocyte-depleted variants are positive for CD 15 and CD30. But Nodular sclerosis variant is most common type and more common in females. So, in the above-mentioned clinical situation, most probable diagnosis is nodular sclerosis variant of Hodgkin's lymphoma.Reed-Sternberg cells are large and are either multinucleated or have a bibbed nucleus (thus resembling an 'owl's eye' appearance) with prominent eosinophilic inclusion-like nucleoli. Reed-Sternberg cells are CD30 and CDI5 positive, usually negative for CD20 and CD45. The presence of these cells is necessary in the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma - the absence of Reed-Sternberg cells has very high negative predictive value.Nodular sclerosis:Nodular sclerosis is MC type all over the worldQNodular sclerosis is MC in femalesIt has propensity to involve the cervical, supraclavicular and mediastinal lymph nodes of adults and adolescentsLacunar cells of Reed Sternberg cells variant is seen",

And similarly promoter induction would increase the transcription rateQ.Capping, tailing, termination and splicing are not associated with promoter and so are not a consequence of promoter mutations.

The enzymes of this pathway are present in the cytoplasm of all cells, but are especially prevalent in adipose and liver cells. The hexose monophosphate shunt pathway makes ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotide synthesis, interconves 6 carbon sugars and 5 carbon sugars, and produces NADPH. NADPH, the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, is used in reductive biosynthetic reactions such as fatty acid synthesis, and in the regeneration of glutathione by glutathione reductase. Glutathione has three main roles in a cell: it keeps the protein sulfhydryl groups of cysteines reduced, it reduces peroxides, and it maintains hemoglobin in the reduced state. NADP+ is also involved in this reaction, but as a substrate, rather than a product. The various forms of NAD and FAD do not take pa. Ref: Bender D.A., Mayes P.A. (2011). Chapter 21.

This is the rate-limiting step in the urea cycle. This reaction requires two ATP and occurs in the mitochondria.Ornithine transcarbamoylase: Combines ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to form citrulline. Located in mitochondria.Argininosuccinate synthetase: Condenses citrulline with aspaate to form arginosuccinate. This reaction occurs in the cytosol and requires one ATP.Argininosuccinate lyase: Splits argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate. Occurs in the cytosol.Arginase: Cleaves arginine into one molecule of urea and ornithine in the cytosol. The ornithine is then transpoed back into the mitochondria for entry back into the cycle.* Regulation: Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the cycle and is stimulated by N -acetylglutamate.* Diseases: Hyperammonemia occurs when there is a deficiency in one of more of the urea cycle enzymes,causing insufficient removal of NH 4+ .Ammonia intoxication leads to CNS deterioration in the form of mental retardation, seizure, coma, and death.",

        "exp": "Closed circular (B form) DNA with one turn of double helix per 10.5 bp (base pair) is relaxed. An 84 bp segment of a circular DNA in the relaxed state would contain 8 double helical turns or 1 for every 10.5 bp. If one of these turns were removed, there would be 84 bp/7 = 12 bp/turn rather than 10.5 bp/turn in B-DNA. This would result in a thermodynamically strained DNA.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo, the strain is a result of the unwinding of DNA double helix in the closed circle.\nThis strain introduced by underwinding is generally accommodated by supercoiling rather than strand separation\u00a0because coiling the axis of DNA usually requires less energy than breaking the hydrogen bonds. So, supercoiling is a result of underwinding. However, underwinding represent a form of stored energy and makes separation of DNA strands easier.\nLinking number can be defined as a number of times the 2nd strand pierces the surface of the 1st strand which is visualized as a circle. It is defined as positive (+ve) if strands are interwound in right handed helix and (-ve) in left handed helix. So linking number is the number of turns.\nSuperhelical density or specific linking difference\u00a0(\u03c3) is a measure of a number of turns removed relative to the number present in relaxed DNA.\u00a0It is independent of the length of the DNA molecule. The negative sign indicates that the change in linking number is due to the underwinding of DNA. So, the supercoiling induced by underwinding is called negative supercoiling. Overwinding results in positive supercoiling.\nTopoisomerase I breaks one of the 2 strands, change the linking number in increments of 1.\nTopoisomerase II breaks both DNA strands and changes the linking number in increments of 2.",

Helices with proline after position four have a pronounced kink. a -helix: It is a spiral structure resulting from hydrogen bonding between one peptide bond and the fouh one. Stability of an a helix: The stability of an a helix arises primarily from hydrogen bonds formed between the oxygen of the peptide bond carbonyl and the hydrogen atom of the peptide bond nitrogen of the fouh residue down the polypeptide chain. The ability to form the maximum number of hydrogen bonds, supplemented by van der Waals interactions in the core of this tightly packed structure, provides the thermodynamic driving force for the formation of an a helix. Proline: The peptide bond nitrogen of proline lacks a hydrogen atom to contribute to a hydrogen bond, proline can only be stably accommodated within the first turn of an a helix. When present elsewhere, proline disrupts the conformation of the helix, producing a bend. Glycine also tends to disrupt helices because its high conformational flexibility makes it entropically expensive to adopt the relatively constrained a-helical structure.

The a-amino group must be removed from the amino acid. This can be done either transamination or oxidative deamination .In transamination, enzymes, known as aminotransferases, act to remove the amino group from specific amino acids and transfer them to another molecule.Almost every amino acid has a specific aminotransferase. ALT: Transfers amino group from alanine to a-ketoglutarate, resulting in the formation of glutamate and pyruvate.AST: Transfers amino group from glutamate to oxaloacetate, resulting in the formation of aspaate and a-ketoglutarate. Oxidative deamination acts to remove the amino group from glutamate and release it as ammonia.Stimulators: ADP and GDP activate glutamate dehydrogenase.Inhibitors: ATP and GTP inhibit glutamate dehydrogenase.2. Once the a-amino group is removed from the amino acid, the ammonia moiety must then be transpoed to the liver for metabolism into urea. This transpo occurs with the help of alanine and glutamine..3. Once in the liver, the ammonia moiety is transformed into urea the urea cycle .4. The remaining carbon skeleton are then degraded into intermediates of the citric acid cycle or can be used as building blocks for other molecules .5.

Vasudevan page 179, http://en .wikipedia. org/wiki/Citric_acid_ cycle Urea cycle and TCA cycle are interlinked and so it is called as \"Urea Bicycle\". The absence of a urea cycle enzyme can result in hyperammonemia or in the build-up of one or more urea cycle intermediates, depending on the enzyme that is missing. Excess ammonia has been shown to inhibit the citric acid cycle (Hatch, 1977) One effect of ammonia is the inhibition of the rate limiting TCA cycle enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alphaKGDH) and possibly also pyruvate dehydrogenase, but this has been regarded to be of no quantitative impoance. However, recent studies justify a revision of this point of view. Based on published data, the following sequence of events is proposed. Inhibition of alphaKGDH both enhances the detoxification of ammonia by formation of glutamine from alpha-ketoglutarate and reduces the rate of NADH and oxidative ATP production in astrocytic mitochondria.

Most commonly employed methods for dispersing peptides, proteins, and other large biomolecules into the vapor phase for mass spectrometric analysis are electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization, aka MALDI. In electrospray ionization, the molecules to be analyzed are dissolved in a volatile solvent and introduced into the sample chamber in a minute stream through a capillary . As the droplet of liquid emerges into the sample chamber, the solvent rapidly disperses leaving the macromolecule suspended in the gaseous phase. The charged probe serves to ionize the sample. Electrospray ionization is frequently used to analyze peptides and proteins as they elute from an HPLC or other chromatography column already dissolved in a volatile solvent. In MALDI, the sample is mixed with a liquid matrix containing a light-absorbing dye and a source of protons. In the sample chamber, the mixture is excited using a laser, causing the surrounding matrix to disperse into the vapor phase so rapidly as to avoid heating embedded peptides or proteins.

        "exp": "Increased Euchromatin formation Histone acetylation promotes Euchromatin formation (transcriptionally active DNA). Deacetylation and methylation promotes Heterochromatin formation (transcriptionally inactive DNA). There are five classes of histones, designated HI, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. These small proteins are positively charged at physiologic pH as a result of their high content of lysine and arginine. Because of their positive charge, they form ionic bonds with negatively charged DNA. Histones help in condensation of DNA into chromosomes. Two molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 form the structural core of the individual nucleosome \"beads.\" Around which a segment of the DNA double helix is wound nearly twice. (Histone HI, is not found in the nucleosome core, but instead binds to the linker DNA chain between the nucleosome beads.). Nucleosomes are fuher arranged into increasingly more complex structures that organize and condense the long DNA molecules into chromosomes. These histone proteins can undergo reversible modifications at their N-terminal end (like acetylation, methylation or phosphorylation). These modifications help in regulation of gene expression. Acetylation of the lysine residues at the N terminus of histone proteins removes positive charge on the lysine and thereby decreases the interaction of the histone with the negatively charged DNA. As a result, the condensed chromatin is transformed into a more relaxed structure allowing transcription factors to access specific regions on the DNA. Deacetylation restores the positive charge, causing stronger interactions between histones and DNA. Thus histone acetylation enhances transcription while histone deacetylation represses transcription. Relaxed, transcriptionally active DNA is referred to as euchromatin. More condensed, inactive DNA is referred to as heterochromatin. Histone acetylation is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATS) and histone deacetylation is catalyzed by histone deacetylases (denoted by HDs or HDACs). Another difference noted between transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin is the extent of methylation of cytosine bases in CG-rich regions (CG islands) of many genes. It has been observed that transcriptionally active genes are less methylated (hypomethylated) than their inactive counterpas. Thus formation of euchromatin is promoted by acetylationand formation of heterochromatin is promoted by deacetylation and methylation. The action of methylation is indirect and has no effect upon charge.",

There are many different types of G proteins; the primary difference among them is found in the a subunit, rather than the or the y subunits. G proteins play an impoant role in signal amplification because one receptor can activate several G proteins, which in turn effects the activity of many enzymes, such as adenylate cyclase or phospholipase C. These G proteins are divided into three major groups defined by their effect. Gs proteins activate adenylate cyclase, raising cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels; and Gp proteins activate phosphalipase C, liberating inositol triphosphate and diacylgylcerol.",

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Each of the genetic deficiencies listed may present with cardiomyopathy in childhood. LCAD affects the first step in b-oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria. Cardiac muscle and resting skeletal muscle use fatty acids and ketones as a primary energy source, thus in LCAD deficiency, muscle weakness and eventually cardiomyopathy develop. Fasting hypoglycemia and hypoketosis occurring together are strongly suggestive of a block in fatty acid oxidation. Only a carnitine uptake deficiency (choice : Carnitine uptake deficiency) or LCAD deficiency (choice : LCAD) are related to fatty acid oxidation. Since carnitine esters (long chain acyl carnitines) are accumulating in serum and in muscle tissue, a carnitine uptake deficiency is ruled out. a-L-Iduronidase deficiency, or Hurler disease (choice : a-L-Iduronidase deficiency) is another of the lysosomal storage diseases. Cardiomyopathy, valvular defects, and potential occlusion of coronary aeries, are results of specific glycosaminoglycan (heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate) accumulation. Similar substrate accumulation in other tissues results in corneal clouding, mental retardation, and skeletal abnormalities. Hypoglycemia, hypoketosis, and muscle weakness are not prominent features of Hurler disease. There would be no accumulation of carnitine derivatives. Acid maltase is a lysosomal enzyme, and its deficiency produces one of a host of lysosomal storage diseases. Acid maltase deficiency (a 1,4-glucosidase deficiency; choice : Acid maltase deficiency) or Pompe disease is also associated with cardiomyopathy. In this case glycogen fragments accumulate in the lysosomes, primarily affecting tissues that store glycogen (muscle, liver, kidney). Hypoglycemia and hypoketosis are not features of this deficiency, nor would acyl carnitines accumulate.",

        "question": "Major form of folic acid to transfer one carbon is ?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Methylene THF Folic acid The active form of folic acid (pteroyl glutamate) is tetrahydrofolate (THF). THF serves as a carrier of one-carbon (C1) unit0 during several biosynthetic reactions like nucleic acidQ and amino acid metabolism. Two other cofactors are also known to be involved in the addition of one carbon (C1) unit to a metabolic precursor, biotin in carboxylation reaction and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as methylating agent. However, folic acid is more versatile than either of these two because it can transfer the C, units in several oxidation states. THF acts as a carrier of one carbon unit0. The one carbon units can be : Methyl (C.113), methylene (CH2), methenyl (CH), formyl (CHO), orformimino (CH =NH). One carbon unit binds to THF through N5 or N1deg or both N5, N'deg position. For example, if formyl unit is attached to N-5, it is cal led N5-formyl THF; if methylene unit is attached to both N5 and 1\\\\l'deg, it is called N5, N'deg methylene THF. Carbon units attached to N5 are formyl, formimino, or methyl; attached to N'deg is formyl; and attached to both N5-N10 are methylene or methenyl. So, various possible THF are : - N5-Formyl THF, N5-formimino THF, N5-methyl THF, N1deg-formyl THF, N5-N10methylene THF and N5-N'deg-methenyl THF. THF receives the C, units from various donor molecules during catabolic reactions and can transfers them to specific acceptors for the synthesis of various compounds. The major point of entry for one-carbon unit into substituted folates is methylene THF, which is formed by the reaction of glycine, serine and choline. Serine is the most impoant source of substituted folates for biosynthetic reactions, and activity of serine hydroxymethyltransferase is regulated by the state of folate substitution and availability of folate.",

The physiologically active form of this vitamin acts as a coenzyme for which of the following enzymes?",
        "exp": "Thiamine (vitamin B1) is conveed intracellularly to its active form, thiamine pyrophosphate, which is an essential cofactor in intermediate carbohydrate metabolism. Thiamine acts as a coenzyme for enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which plays a critical role in the production of energy from food, and the pentose-phosphate pathway, which produces an impoant intermediate, ribose-5-phosphate, required for the synthesis of ATP, GTP, DNA, RNA, and NADPH. The brain is paicularly vulnerable to thiamine deficiency because it relies exclusively on carbohydrates for immediate energy demands. The selective vulnerability of ceain structures accounts for the specific clinical manifestations of Wernicke encephalopathy. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the physiologically active form of thiamine, is required for the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). PDH catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, regulating entry into the citric acid cycle for metabolites leaving glycolysis. The PDH complex is comprised of 3 separate enzymes: pyruvate dehydrogenase (decarboxylase), dihydrolipoamide transacetylase and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. Besides TPP, the complex also requires CoA, NAD, FAD, and lipoic acid as coenzymes. The mechanism of TPP action includes formation of a carbanion that can attack the electron-deficient keto carbon of pyruvate. In addition, TPP functions as a coenzyme for alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and transketolase. Pyridoxal phosphate serves as a coenzyme for glycogen phosphorylase. Vitamin B12 acts as a cofactor of L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which catalyzes conversion of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. Methionine synthase activation leads to synthesis of methionine from homocysteine with folic acid as a coenzyme.",

Variable regions of light- & heavy chains (i.e. VL & VH) bind to specifc antigen and form a pa of Fab (antigen binding fragment).IgM is natural antibody produced in primary response to antigen. It does not cross placenta, therefore, the fetus even though it carries an incompatible antigen, is protected from natural antibodies of mother. It fixes complementQ (like IgG) and agglutinates bacteria (like IgA & G). It has antigen receptors on B cells, surface (IgD is found on surface of B cells where it acts as a receptor for antigen).Newly mature B cells produce both IgM and IgD, which can switch to other class of immunoglobulin (i.e. IgG, IgA or IgE) in a process k/a isotype/class switching.",

The substrate is still able to bind the enzyme, but the enzyme cannot catalyze the reaction when inhibitor is bound.

G banding: Preparations are incubated in a variety of saline solutions using any 1 of several pretreatments and stained with Giemsa's stain. G-banding is generally preferred over Q-banding because G-band analysis is performed by light microscopy. R banding: Preparations are incubated in buffer solutions at high temperatures or at special pH and stained with Giemsa's stain. This process yields the reverse bands of G banding. C banding: Preparations are either heated in saline to temperatures just below boiling or treated with ceain alkali solutions and then stained with Giemsa's stain. This process causes prominent bands to develop in the region of the centromeres. Ref: Manipalviratn S., Trivax B., Huang A. (2013). Chapter 3. Genetic Disorders & Sex Chromosome Abnormalities.

It is more decreased in case of diabetes (viually absent in type I diabetes). There is relative excess of glucagon in both the cases. Glucagon acts through elevation in CAMP level. Blood glucose levels: Diabetics exhibit a characteristic hyperglycemia where as in starvation the individual maintain a blood glucose level that is near to normal Ketosis: The mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissue and hepatic ketogencsis are greater in diabetes than in starvation.

        "question": "In how much time does Hepatic glycogen storage depletes during starvation?",
        "exp": "The primary role of altered metabolism during fasting is to maintain blood glucose through the synthesis (gluconeogenesis) and utilization of alternate substrates. Fasting-starvation is divided in three broad categories:?Initial stage :- Lasts upto 2-3 daysIntermediate stage :- Lasts upto 24 daysAdvanced stage:- begins after 24 days.a) Initial stage (first stage):- Liver glycogen is the first main provider of energy. But due to limited storage it can not last longe (16-18 hrs.). Fuher glucose is provided by gluconeogenesis by non-carbohydrate sources (muscle protein breakdown is increased which provides amino acids alanine and glutamine for gluconeogenesis). Utilization of alternate substrates (other than glucose) stas increasing in terminal period of this stage. Free fatty acids and ketone bodies sta rising in this stage. Glycogen is completely depleted by the end of this stage. Blood glucose is slightly decreased.The first priority of metabolism in starvation is to provide sufficient glucose to brain and other tissues that are absolutely dependent on glucose.Liver glycogen provides glucose only for a sho period. Whereas, gluconeogenesis plays an essential role in maintaining blood glucose during both sho-term and prolonged starvation.The substrate for gluconeogenesis are pyruvate, lactate (from RBCs and exercising muscles), glucogenic amino acids released from muscle protein breakdown, and glycerol released from lipolysis.b) Intermediate stage (Second stage):- Free fatty acids are the major substrates for energy production. They are derived from hydrolysis of fat (triglycerides) in adipose tissue. Ketone bodies serve as additional source of energy. As glycogen source is already depleted, the only source of glucose is increased gluconeogenesis. After sometimes muscle breakdown decreases due to decreased need of glucose as a fuel for brain which has began using ketone bodies as a source of energy.c) Advanced stage (Third stage):- When fat stores are almost exhaused, energy requirment is obtained from breakdown of tissue proteins and protein stores once again enter in stage of rapid depletion.Thus the second priority of metabolism in starvation is to preserve protein. This is accomplished by using fatty acids and ketone bodies in place of glucose as a fuel.",

Almost all of the eukaryotic genome is carried on two or more linear chromosomes separated from the cytoplasm within the membrane of the nucleus. Eukaryotic cells contain mitochondria and, in some cases, chloroplasts. Within each of these organelles is a circular molecule of DNA that contains a few genes whose function relates to that paicular organelle. Most genes associated with organelle function, however, are carried on eukaryotic chromosomes. Many types of yeast contain an additional genetic element, an independently replicating 2-m circle containing about 6.3 kbp of DNA. Such small circles of DNA, termed plasmids, are frequently encountered in the genetics of prokaryotes. The small size of plasmids renders them amenable to genetic manipulation and, after their alteration, may allow their introduction into cells. Therefore, plasmids are frequently called upon in genetic engineering.",

Which of the following substances would most likely be elevated in this patient's plasma following a fatty meal?",

They are assembled in chylomicrons and eventually sent into the circulation for delivery to adipocytes and other cells. Chylomicrons are too large to enter cells, but are degraded while in the circulation by lipoprotein lipase. A defect in this enzyme would result in the accumulation of chylomicrons in the plasma. Albumin-bound free fatty acids (choice A) is incorrect because fatty acids leave the intestine esterified as triglycerides in chylomicrons. HDL is not a carrier of dietary fat from the intestine. LDL would be not be elevated in this patient after a high fat meal. However, VLDL would be elevated if the patient ate a high carbohydrate meal. In this situation, the carbohydrate would be conveed into fat in the liver and sent out into circulation as VLDL. VLDL would be unable to be degraded to LDL and, therefore, would accumulate.

These observations, made using RNA molecules derived from the organelles from plants, yeast, viruses, and higher eukaryotic cells, show that RNA can act as an enzyme, and have revolutionized thinking about enzyme action and the origin of life itself.

In contrast, homozygous deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase produces severe disease culminating in death in infancy. In addition to galactosemia and galactosuria, these patients have impaired renal tubular resorption leading to aminoaciduria, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly, cataracts, bleeding diathesis, hypoglycemia, and mental retardation. Pathologically, the CNS showed neuronal loss and gliosis and the liver shows fatty change progressing to cirrhosis. Benign disease with cataract formation is characteristic of galactokinase deficiency. Chronic emphysema is not associated with homozygous galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency, but rather with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Impaired tubular reabsorption (producing aminoaciduria) is seen within a few days or weeks of feeding milk to an infant with severe galactosemia, as opposed to chronic renal failure appearing in adolescence.

The LDL (apoB-100, E) receptor is defective in familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition which blood LDL cholesterol levels are increased, causing premature atherosclerosis. HDL concentrations vary reciprocally with plasma triacylglycerol concentrations and directly with the activity of lipoprotein lipase. This may be due to surplus surface constituents, eg, phospholipid and apo A-I, being released during hydrolysis of chylomicrons and VLDL and contributing toward the formation of pre-HDL and discoidal HDL. HDL2 concentrations are inversely related to the incidence of atherosclerosis, possibly because they reflect the efficiency of reverse cholesterol transpo. Ref: Botham K.M., Mayes P.A. (2011).

Inhibitors of electron transpo chain properThese inhibitors inhibit the flow of electrons through the respiratory chain. This occurs at following sites.Complex I (NADH to CoQ) is inhibited by : - Barbiturates (amobarbital), Piericidin A (an antibiotic), rotenone (an insectiside), chlorpromazine (a tranquilizer), and guanethidine (an ntihypeensive). These inhibitors block the transfer of reducing equivalents from FeS protein to CoQ.Complex II is inhibited by : - Carboxin and TTFA inhibit transfer of electon from FADH2 to CoQ, whereas malanate competitively inhibit from succinate to complex II. Complex III (Cytochrome b to cytochrome CI) is inhibited by : - Dimercaprol, antimycin A, BAL(British antilewisite), Naphthyloquinone. These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome b to cytochromeComplex IV (cytochrome C oxidase) is inhibited by : - Carbon monoxide, CN-, H2S and azide (N3-). These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome aa3 to molecular oxygen and therefore can totally arrest cellular respiration.2. Inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylationThese compounds directly inhibit phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. Oligomycin inhibits Fo component of F0F, ATPase. Atractiloside inhibits translocase, a transpo protein that transpos ADP into mitochondria for phosphorylation into ATP.3. UncouplesAs the name suggests, these componds block the coupeling of oxidation with phosphorylation. These compounds allow the transfer of reducing equivalents in respiratory chain but prevent the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP by uncoupling the linkage between ETC and phosphorylation. Thus the energy instead of being trapped by phosphorylation is dissipated as heat. Uncouplers may be :-Natural :- Thermogenin, thyroxineSynthetic :- 2, 4-dinitrophenol (2, 4-DNP), 2, 4-dinitrocresol (2, 4-DNC), and CCCP (chlorocarbonylcyanidephenyl hydrazone).",

These absorb upto 15 times its weight in water as it moves through GIT, producing softer stools. Its good sources are oat, flaxseeds, peas, beans, apple, citrus fruits, carrots, bareley and psyllium.Insoluble fibredeg : - These are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. These promote movement of material through digestive system and increases stool bulk. Its good sources are wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts and vegetables.",

He states that yesterday he played basketball for 4 hours, which was the first time he had exercised in 4 months. He awoke this morning with sore muscles and discolored urine. Physical examination is unremarkable. The urine is reddish-brown in color; dipstick test for blood is positive, the pH is 5.1, the specific gravity 1.03. Microscopic examination of the urine reveals no red blood cells. What is the most likely etiology for this presentation?",
        "exp": "The appearance of a dark-reddish urine is suggestive of a number of conditions, including hematuria; however, there are no red blood cells present on microscopic examination. Fuhermore, the dipstick test for blood is positive, which is suggestive of myoglobinuria. Myoglobin is a pigment that, if present in the urine, will produce a positive dipstick test, even in the absence of red blood cells. Myoglobinuria can be caused when an unconditioned individual paakes in intense physical exeion. This extreme physical activity leads to muscle cell breakdown and the release of myoglobin into the blood, which is then filtered by the kidneys and excreted into the urine. If there was hemolyzed blood in the urine , a few red blood cells should have been detected on urinalysis. Ingestion of foods that contained red dye can discolor the urine; however, it would not produce a positive dipstick test. Nephrolithiasis generally results in the appearance of blood cells in the urine. Ref: Kennelly P.J., Rodwell V.W. (2011). Chapter 6. Proteins: Myoglobin & Hemoglobin. In D.A. Bender, K.M.
