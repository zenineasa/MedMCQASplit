HDL cholesterol is the cholesterol that is removed from peripheral tissues; LDL cholesterol represents the cholesterol which is to be delivered to peripheral tissues. LDL binds to LDL receptors and whole LDL particle is endocytosed by receptor mediated endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits (not by diffusion:- diffusion and endocytosis are different processes). Intracellular cholesterol activates intracellular enzyme acyl-CoA cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT).",
