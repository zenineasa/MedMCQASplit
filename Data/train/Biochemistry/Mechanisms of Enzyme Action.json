        "exp": "Ans. b. Cyclooxygenase (Ref: Harper 27/e p204 Harrison 18/e p146. Cyclooxygenase is a suicidal enzyme. Suicidal enzyme is one. which undergoes self-destruction in order to terminate its own acitivity. e. g. Cyclooxygenase. Switching off of prostaglandin activity is partly achieved by a remarkable property of cyclooxygenaseQ, that of self-catalyzed destruction, i. e. it is a 'suicidal enzyme'. Suicidal inhibition is conversion of a substrate by the enzyme into a metabolite, which is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme; example: Xanthine oxidase converts allopurinol to alloxanthine (oxypurinol), which is a more potent inhibitor of allopurinol.",

Thiamine has a central role in energy-yielding metabolism and especially the metabolism of carbohydrates. The active from of thiamine is thiamine pyrophosphate (TTP) also called thiaminediphosphate (TDP). o Thiamine diphosphate (TDP) or TPP is the coenzyme for three multienzyme complexes that catalyze oxidative decarboxylation: i) Pyruvate dehydrogenase in carbohydrate metabolism, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. ii) a-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase in citric acid cycle, which catalyzes the conversion of a-ketoglutarate to succinyl CoA. iii) Branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of branched chain keto amino acids, i. e. leucine, isoleucine and valine. o Thiamine diphosphate is also the coenzume for transketolase, in the pentose phosphate pathway. Therefore, thiamine nutritional status is best assessed by erythrocyte (preferred) or whole blood transketolase activity. o Deficiency of thiamine causes: Beriberi.

Oxidative deaminationo It is the most important deamination process. Glutamate undergoes oxidative deamination (removal of amino group) by the action of L-glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). GDH requires NAD+ or NADP+. o Thus, the net removal of a-amino groups to form ammonia, requires the comination of glutamate transminases (AL T or AST) and glutamate dehydrogenase. The whole process of conversion of a-amino group to ammonia (transamination + oxidative deamination) is called Transdeamination. Nonoxidative deaminationo Beside oxidative deamination, deamination can also occur by non-oxidative methods,. It occurs by: -i) By Amino acid oxidases: L-amino acid oxidases of liver and kidney convert an a-amino acid to a-imino acid that decomposes to an a-keto acid with release of ammonium ion. In this reaction, O, is reduced to H, 0., which is later decomposed by catalase. ii) By amino acid dehydratase: - The a-amino group of serine and threonine can be directly deaminate into NH4+ ion by dehydratases.

        "question": "All are true about glutathione except:",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e. it converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin Glutathione prevents oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. The heme group of hemoglobin contains iron in the ferrous state. Hemoglobin can accept and transport oxygen only when the iron atom is in its ferrous form. When hemoglobin becomes oxidized, it is converted to the ferric state (Fe3+) or methemoglobin. Methemoglobin is unable to transfer oxygen. Glutathione prevents this oxidation. Glutathione. Glutathione is a tripeptide of glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine. The molecule has a sulfhydryl (-SH) or thiol group on the cysteine, which accounts for its strong electron-donating character. It exists in two forms: reduced glutathione or GSH. In the reduced state, the thiol group of cysteine is able to donate a reducing equivalent (H++ e ) to other unstable molecules, such as reactive oxygen species. In donating an electron, glutathione itself becomes reactive, but readily reacts with another reactive glutathione to form glutathione disulfide (GSSG) or oxidized glutathione. GSH can be regenerated from GSSG by the enzyme glutathione reductase. While all cells in the human body are capable of synthesizing glutathione, liver glutathione synthesis has been shown to be essential. The liver is the largest GSH reservoir. Because of its reducing property, reduced glutathione has potent antioxidant action. Functions: GSH is an extremely important cell protectant. It directly reduces reactive hydroxyl free radicals, other oxygen- centered free radicals, and radical centers on DNA and other biomolecules. GSH is the essential cofactor for many enzymes which require thiol-reducing equivalents, and helps keep redox- sensitive active sites on enzymes in the necessary reduced state. GSH is used as a cofactor bymultiple peroxidase enzymes, to detoxify peroxides generated from oxygen radical attack on biological molecules; transhydrogenases, to reduce oxidized centers on DNA, proteins, and other biomolecules; andglutathione S-transferases (GST) to conjugate GSH with endogenous substances (e. g., estrogens) and to exogenous electrophiles (e. g., arene oxides, unsaturated carbonyls, organic halides), and diverse xenobiotics. GSH is a primary protectant of skin, lens, cornea, and retina against radiation damage, and the biochemical foundation of P450 detoxication in the liver, kidneys, lungs, intestinal epithelia, and other organs. GSH acts as a carrier in transport of certain amino acids across membranes in the kidney. Glutathione (GSH) participates in leukotriene synthesis",
