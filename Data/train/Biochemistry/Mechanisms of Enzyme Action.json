Suicidal enzyme is one. which undergoes self-destruction in order to terminate its own acitivity. e. g. Cyclooxygenase. Switching off of prostaglandin activity is partly achieved by a remarkable property of cyclooxygenaseQ, that of self-catalyzed destruction, i. e. it is a 'suicidal enzyme'. Suicidal inhibition is conversion of a substrate by the enzyme into a metabolite, which is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme; example: Xanthine oxidase converts allopurinol to alloxanthine (oxypurinol), which is a more potent inhibitor of allopurinol.",

The active from of thiamine is thiamine pyrophosphate (TTP) also called thiaminediphosphate (TDP). o Thiamine diphosphate (TDP) or TPP is the coenzyme for three multienzyme complexes that catalyze oxidative decarboxylation: i) Pyruvate dehydrogenase in carbohydrate metabolism, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. ii) a-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase in citric acid cycle, which catalyzes the conversion of a-ketoglutarate to succinyl CoA. iii) Branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of branched chain keto amino acids, i. e. leucine, isoleucine and valine. o Thiamine diphosphate is also the coenzume for transketolase, in the pentose phosphate pathway. Therefore, thiamine nutritional status is best assessed by erythrocyte (preferred) or whole blood transketolase activity. o Deficiency of thiamine causes: Beriberi.
