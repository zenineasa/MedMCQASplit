        "question": "Which of the following is non-competitive inhibitor of intestinal alkaline phosphatase?",
        "exp": "Ans. d (L-Phenylalanine) (Ref. Biochemistry by Vasudevan, 4th ed., 57; 5th ed., 55-56)ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE# The pH optimum for the enzyme reaction is between 9 and 10.# It is activated by magnesium and manganese.# Zinc is a constituent ion of ALR# It is produced by osteoblasts of bone, and is associated with the calcification process.# It is localised in cell membranes (ecto-enzyme), and is associated with transport mechanisms in liver, kidney and intestinal mucosa.# For estimation, sodium phenyl phosphate is used as the substrate, pH is adjusted to 9. 9, serum sample is added as the source of ALP and incubated.# Normal serum value of ALP is 40-125 U/L.# Raised Levels: Mild increasepregnancy. Moderate (2-3 times) increase. In infective hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis or hepatocellular carcinoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, congestive cardiac failure or ulcerative colitis. Very high levels of ALP (10-12 times). In extrahepatic obstruction (obstructive jaundice) or cholestasis. Drastically high levels of ALP (10-25 times). Bone diseases where osteoblastic activity is enhanced such as Paget's disease, rickets, osteomalacia, osteoblastoma, metastatic carcinoma of bone, and hyperparathyroidism. Iso-enzymes of Alkaline Phosphatase# Alpha-1 ALP moves in alpha-1 position, it is synthesized by epithelial cells of biliary canaliculi. It is about 10% of total activity and is increased in obstructive jaundice and to some extent in metastatic carcinoma of liver.# Alpha-2 heat labile ALP is stable at 56degC; but loses its activity when kept at 65degC for 30 minutes. It is produced by hepatic cells. Therefore, exaggerated alpha-2 band suggests hepatitis. This liver iso-enzyme forms about 25% of total ALP.# Alpha-2 heat stable ALP will not be destroyed at 65degC, but is inhibited by phenylalanine. It is of placental origin, which is found in blood in normal pregnancy. An iso-enzyme closely resembling the placental form is characteristically seen in circulation in about 15% cases of carcinoma of lung, liver and gut and named as Regan iso-enzyme (after the first patient in whom it was detected) or carcinoplacental iso-enzyme. Chronic heavy smoking also increases Regan iso-enzyme level in blood. Normal level is only 1% of the total ALP.# Pre-beta ALP is of bone origin and elevated levels are seen in bone diseases. This is most heat labile (destroyed at 56degC, 10 min). Wheat germ lectin will precipitate bone isoenzyme. This constitutes about 50% of normal ALP activity.# Gamma-ALP is inhibited by phenylalanine and originates from intestinal cells. It is increased in ulcerative colitis. About 10% of plasma ALP are of intestinal variety.# Leucocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) is significantly decreased in chronic myeloid leukemia. It is increased in lymphomas and leukemoid reactions. ALANINE AMINO TRANSFERASE (ALT)# It is also called as serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT).# The enzyme needs pyridoxal phosphate as co-enzyme.# Normal serum level of AL T for male is 13^4-0 U/L and for female is 10-28 U/L.# Very high values (100 to 1000 U/L) are seen in acute hepatitis, either toxic or viral in origin.# Both ALT and AST levels are increased in liver disease, but ALT > AST.# Moderate increase (25 to 100 U/L) may be seen in chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis, Hepatoma.# A sudden fall in ALT level in cases of hepatitis is very bad prognostic sign. NUCLEOTIDE PHOSPHATASE# It is also known as 5' nucleotidase.# It is a marker enzyme for plasma membranes and is seen as an ecto-enzyme (enzyme present on the cell membrane).# Serum samples contain both ALP and NTP.# These are distinguished by Nickel ions which inhibit NTP but not ALP.- Normal NTP level in serum is 2-10 IU/L. It is moderately increased in hepatitis and highly elevated in biliary obstruction.# Unlike ALP, the level is unrelated with osteoblastic activity and therefore unaffected by bone disease. GAMMA GLUTAMYL TRANSFERASE (GGT)# The old name was gamma glutamyl transpeptidase.# It can transfer gamma glutamyl residues to substrate.# In the body it is used in the synthesis of glutathione.# It is seen in liver, kidney, pancreas, intestinal cells and prostate gland.",

The abstraction of two carbons from D-xylulose-5-P yields the 3-carbon aldose glyceraldehyde-3-P. In the Calvin cycle, transketolase catalyzes the reverse reaction, the conversion of sedoheptulose-7-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P to pentoses, the aldose D-ribose-5-P and the ketose D-xylulose-5-P. The second reaction catalyzed by transketolase in the pentose phosphate pathway involves the same thiamine diphosphate-mediated transfer of a 2-carbon fragment from D-xylulose-5-P to the aldose erythrose-4-phosphate, affording fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-P.

The most common mechanism of non-competitive inhibition involves reversible binding of the inhibitor to an allosteric site, but it is possible for the inhibitor to operate other means including direct binding to the active site.

Ligases, Synthetases, Carboxylases* Enzymes are classified into 6 classes: i) Oxidoreductasesii) Transferasesiii) Hydrolasesiv) Lyasesv) Isomerasesvi) LigasesI. Oxidoreductases catalyse oxidation or reduction reactions of the primary substrate. Hence they are in turn classified as those which mediate:# Oxidation reactions# Reduction reactions* Those which mediate oxidation reactions can be classified as those which mediate oxidation by:# Removal of hydrogen ion or# Addition of oxygen# Those which cause REMOVAL OF HYDROGEN can again be classified depending upon the acceptor* NAD/FAD/NADP as acceptor - Dehydrogenases. Examples - Lactate Dehydrogenase, Pyruvate Dehydrogenase both remove hydrogen ion from Lactate and Pyruvate respectively and donate the hydrogen ions to NAD forming NADH and H+* Oxygen as acceptor - Oxidases. Example - L Aminoacid oxidase removes hydrogen atoms from aminoacid and that is donated to Oxygen molecule forming hydrogen peroxide# Those which add oxygen can be classified depending upon whether one or both the atoms are used as. Monooxygenases* Monooxygenase allows oxygen molecule to react with a substrate. However, it incorporates only one oxygen atom into the substrate. The substrate thereby gets converted into hydroxylated form.* RH + O2 - ROH + H2O* So the other name for monooxygenases is hydroxylases* Example Phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase. Dioxygenases* Dioxygenase allows oxygen molecule to react with a substrate. It incorporates both the oxygen atoms into the substrate.* E. g., Homogentisate oxidase# Those which mediate REDUCTION REACTIONS can be given various names. Peroxidases* If hydrogen peroxide is getting reduced, it is called as peroxidase* E. g., glutathione peroxidase. Catalases* For reduction of hydrogen peroxide, if hydrogen peroxide is used as a source of hydrogen, it is catalase. Reductases* A substance is reduced using reducing equivalents. II. TRANSFERASES transfer a group from one substrate to another. Depending upon the group that is transferred, they are classified as -Kinases /Phosphotransferases# They transfer phosphate group from one substrate to another# Example hexokinase or glucokinase transfers phosphate group from ATP to glucose or any hexose respectively. Transketolases# Transfers ketone group from one substrate to another. Transaldolase# Transfers aldehyde group from one substrate to another. Acyltransferase# Transfers acyl group or fatty acid from one substrate to another# Example Glycerol phosphate acyl transferase transfers acyl group or fatty acid from acyl CoA to glycerol phosphate forming triacylglycerol. Glucosyltransferase - glycogen synthase. III. HYDROLASES catalyse cleavage of a covalent linkage by addition of water# These enzymes can cleave only ester (phosphate/peptide) / ether (glycosidic) linkages# Examples include: a) Amidasese) Phospholipasesb) Peptidasesf) Glycosidasesc) Esterasesg) Ribonucleasesd) Phosphatases. IV. LYASES catalyse cleavage of a C-N /C-C linkage without adding water# Since all reactions are reversible, they can also synthesise the same linkage back# Examples include: a) Decarboxylasesd) Aldolaseb) Hydratasee) Lyasesc) Dehydratasef) SynthasesV. ISOMERASES catalyse the conversion of one form of a substance to another form of substance without altering the molecular formula# Examples include: a) Isomerasesc) Epimeraseb) Racemased) Mutase - shifts a group from one carbon atom to another.

It interacts with histone by the action of biotinyl-transferase. Sometimes the vitamin is used in weight reduction programs. It may be prescribed as a supplement for diabetic patients due to its role in carbohydrate metabolism. Biotin is commonly found in vitamin B complex and many food sources, such as milk, yeast, egg yolk, cereal, and mushrooms. The reference daily intake for vitamin B7 is 300 micrograms. Deficiency in the vitamin may result in seborrheic dermatitis, alopecia, myalgia, hyperesthesia, and conjunctivitis. Disorders of biotin metabolism can be acquired or congenital. Biotinidase and holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency are the two better-known forms of disorders. The lack of biotin-dependent pyruvate carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase can lead to the life-threatening disorder of multiple carboxylase deficiency.

Dioxygenases. Monooxygenases (Mixed-Function Oxidases, Hydroxylases)# Incorporate Both Atoms of Molecular Oxygen Into the Substrate# They incorporate only one atom of molecular oxygen into the substrate, the other oxygen atom is reduced to water, an additional electron donor or cosubstrate (Z) being necessary for this purpose.# Both NADH and NADPH donate reducing equivalents for the reduction of these cytochromes, which in turn are oxidized by substrates in a series of enzymatic reactions collectively known as hydroxylase cycle.# Examples include the:- Liver enzymes, - Homogentisate- Dioxygenase (oxidase) and- 3-hydroxyanthranilate dioxygenase (oxidase), that contain iron; and- L-tryptophan dioxygenase (tryptophan pyrrolase), that utilizes heme.# In liver microsomes, cytochromes P450 are found together with cytochrome b5 and have an important role in detoxification.# Cytochromes P450 are heme-containing monooxygenases important for the detoxification of many drugs & for the hydroxylation of steroids.# Cytochrome P450 is considered the most versatile biocatalyst known.

A competitive inhibitor could bind to an allosteric site of the free enzyme and prevent substrate binding, as long as it does not bind to the allosteric site when the substrate is bound. For example, strychnine acts as an allosteric inhibitor of the glycine receptor in the mammalian spinal cord and brain stem. Glycine is a major post-synaptic inhibitory neurotransmitter with a specific receptor site. Strychnine binds to an alternate site that reduces the affinity of the glycine receptor for glycine, resulting in convulsions due to lessened inhibition by the glycine.

As estimating bilirubin is a measure of functional ability of liver, it takes some time for the levels of bilirubin to increase. Enzyme levels rapidly rise because any damaged hepatocyte's membrane permeability is increased.* ALT or SGPT is purely a cytoplasmic enzyme, whereas AST or SGOT is present in both cytoplasm and mitochondria. The cytoplasmic isoform of the enzyme ASTI is derived from RBC and Heart. The mitochondrial isoform of the enzyme AST2 is derived from liver.* Hence following hepatocellular injury, the cytoplasmic enzyme ALT level rises faster (Normal level of ALT is <34 IU/L in females and <52 in males) than AST (Normal level of AST is (6 to 34. IU/L in females and 8 to 40 IU/L in males). Thus AST is neither a sensitive nor a specific marker of hepatocellular damage (Not specific because it is expressed by heart as well and hence levels are elevated even after myocardial damage)* Generally when AST and ALT are elevated, AST/ALT ratio will be less than 2. If it is more than 2 it is suggestive of mitochondrial damage like alcoholic hepatitis or toxic liver injury* 5'-nucleotidase is an enzyme which catalyzes the phosphorylytic cleavage of 5'nucleotides. There are membrane bound forms and soluble forms. Membrane bound forms are GPI anchored to the cell membrane. Soluble forms are in cytoplasm. Following biliary obstruction, the bile stays in the intrahepatic biliary canaliculi. Tijs causes dissolution of liver parenchymal cell membrane and the cell bound membranes get released into circulation through hepatic sinusoids. Hence 5' nucleotidase level in circulation increases following bile duct obstruction. So, levels of 5' nucleotidase elevation along with elevation of Alkaline phosphatase confirms that the elevation of ALP is of hepatic origin (BILIARY DUCT OBSTRUCTION) not osseous (AS ALP LEVEL IS ALSO INCTREASED IN BONE RELATED CONDITIONS WITH ELEVATED OSTEOBLASTIC ACTIVITY)* Same is the case with Gamma Glutamyl Transferase. It is involved in liver conjugation reactions and absorption of neutral aminoacid along intestinal membranes. This enzyme is also a membrane bound enzyme. Hence levels are elevated following duct obstruction. But as the enzyme is involved in detoxification reactions, the enzyme gets induced by alcohol. Hence levels of GGT is high after intake of alcohol. Isolated elevation of GGT is suggestive of alcoholism. If GGT elevation is accompanied by an elevation of ALP and 5; nucleotidase, it is obstruction.",

When sufficient cholesterol is present in the cell, transcription of the gene for HMG CoA reductase is suppressed, and cellular synthesis of cholesterol is decreased. When cholesterol in diet is low, synthesis is increased Cholesterol regulates the expression of HMG CoA reductase gene and LDLR (LDL receptor) gene. A specific recognition sequence known as the sterol regulatory element (SRE) is present in DNA. SRE binding by sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) is essential for the transcription of these genes. When cholesterol levels are sufficiently high, the SREBP remains as an inactive precursor. The SREBP cleavage activator protein (SCAP), is an intracellular cholesterol sensor.

The velocity(V) is expressed in macromolecules of substrate conveed per minute. if the velocity is plotted against the substrate conc. a typical curve is seen. as substrate conc. is increased, the velocity is also correspondingly increased in the initial phases, but the curve flattens afterwords. the specificity constant also called kinetic efficiency is a measure of how efficiently an enzyme conves substrates into products. A comparison of specificity constants can also be used as a measure of the preference of an enzyme for different substrates (i. e., substrate specificity). The higher the specificity constant, the more the enzyme \"prefers\" that substrate. The following equation, known as the Michaelis-Menten model, is used to describe the kinetics of enzymes: E + S = k r k f ES - k c a t E + P where E, S, ES, and P represent enzyme, substrate, enzyme-substrate complex, and product, respectively. The Michaelis constant, in turn, is defined as follows: The Michaelis constant is equal to the substrate concentration at which the enzyme conves substrates into products at half its maximal rate and hence is related to the affinity of the substrate for the enzyme. The catalytic constant is the rate of product formation when the enzyme is saturated with the substrate and therefore reflects the enzyme&; s maximum rate. The rate of product formation is dependent on both how well the enzyme binds the substrate and how fast the enzyme conves substrate into product once the substrate is bound. For a kinetically perfect enzyme, every encounter between enzyme and substrate leads to product and hence the reaction velocity is only limited by the rate the enzyme encounters substrate in solution.

A second messenger of a cyclic AMP (c. AMP) increases in concentration due to epinephrine or glucagon, and this increase results in an enzyme cascade. Activation of phosphorylase kinase is due to increased concentrations of Ca2+ or by the phosphorylation by protein kinase A which is c. AMP-dependent. The activated kinase, in turn, activates the glycogen phosphorylase enzyme by phosphorylating the Ser-14 residue. In the liver, glucagon is the primary signal which catalyzes this enzyme cascade. Glycogen phosphorylase b is not always inactive in muscle, as it can be activated allosterically by AMP. An increase in AMP concentration, which occurs during strenuous exercise, signals energy demand. AMP activates glycogen phosphorylase b by changing its conformation from a tense to a relaxed form. This relaxed form has similar enzymatic propeies as the phosphorylated enzyme. An increase in ATP concentration opposes this activation by displacing AMP from the nucleotide binding site, indicating sufficient energy stores.",

Therefore, pyruvate needs to be transpoed from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix. The outer mitochondrial membrane contains porins, which are membrane proteins that form non-specific pores and allow free permeation of most small metabolites, including pyruvate. In contrast, the inner mitochondrial membrane is much more restrictive, and it is permeable to only those metabolites for which it contains specific carrier systems. The pyruvate carrier is an active transpoer that co-transpos pyruvate and a proton. Red blood cells and blood platelets lack mitochondria and accordingly cannot degrade pyruvate.

The basic residue or cofactor deprotonates the alpha carbon, and FAD accepts the hydride from the beta carbon, oxidizing the bound succinate to fumarate--refer to image 6. In E1cb, an enolate intermediate is formed, shown in image 7, before FAD accepts the hydride. Fuher research is required to determine which elimination mechanism succinate undergoes in Succinate Dehydrogenase. Oxidized fumarate, now loosely bound to the active site, is free to exit the protein.",

End product of even chain FA oxidation-acetyl CoA(2C). End product of odd chain FA oxidation-acetyl CoA units + 1 propionyl CoA(3C). Propionyl CoA is converted to succinyl-CoA (steps mentioned below), a constituent of the citric acid cycle, which after few steps, enters in to gluconeogenesis. Only 2 enzymes in our body requires vit B as cofactor: Methyl malonyl CoA mutase (AKA methylmalonyl-CoA isomerase). Methionine synthase (Synthesis of Methionine by methylation of homocysteine). Hence, the propionyl residue from an odd-chain fatty acid is the only part of a fatty acid that is glucogenic. Even chain fatty acids cannot synthesize glucose, because PDH reaction is irreversible. Gluconeogenesis is glucose synthesized from non-carbohydrate sources like lactate, propionyl CoA and Glucogenic amino acids.

Hence, it is not highly specific liver tissue damage indicator as it can be elevated in conditions other than liver damage. The aminotransferases catalyze the chemical reactions involving the amino acids, where an amino group is transferred from the donor amino acid to the recipient molecule. Aminotransferases are also referred to as transaminases. Another name for AST is serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). Similarly, another name for ALT is serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT). Hence, AST is also referred to as SGOT and ALT is also referred to as SGPT. By contrast, SGPT is normally present in large concentrations in the liver. Hence, due to liver damage, its level in the blood rises, thereby, serving as a specific indicator for liver injury. To regard SGOT and SGPT as liver function tests is a misnomer that is commonly prevalent in the medical community as they do not reflect the functioning of the liver.

This causes the substrate molecule to adopt a strained conformation similar to that of the transition state. According to Phillips-Mechanism, the lysozyme binds to a hexasaccharide. The lysozyme then distos the fouh sugar in hexasaccharide (the D ring) into a half-chair conformation. In this stressed state, the glycosidic bond is easily broken. The amino acid side-chains glutamic acid 35 (Glu35) and aspaate 52 (Asp52) have been found to be critical to the activity of this enzyme. Glu35 acts as a proton donor to the glycosidic bond, cleaving the C-O bond in the substrate, whereas Asp52 acts as a nucleophile to generate a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH or LD) is an enzyme found in nearly all living cells (animals, plants, and prokaryotes). LDH catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvic acid and back, as it conves NAD+ to NADH and back. A dehydrogenase is an enzyme that transfers a hydride from one molecule to another. LDH exists in four distinct enzyme classes. This aicle is specifically about the NAD(P)-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase. Other LDHs act on D-lactate and/or are dependent on cytochrome c: D-lactate dehydrogenase (cytochrome)) and L-lactate (L-lactate dehydrogenase (cytochrome)). LDH is expressed extensively in body tissues, such as blood cells and heart muscle. Because it is released during tissue damage, it is a marker of common injuries and disease such as heart failure.",

Harper Biochemistry 28th/ pg. 483; Robbin's 8th/pg. 20, 21; Table 1-3; Fig. 1-20)A series of enzymes acts as free radical-scavenging systems and breaks down H202 include the following:# Superoxide dismutases (SODs) ----- Option A----- are found in many cell types and convert oxygen free radical to H2. O2.# Catalase, ---- Option B---- present in peroxisomes, decomposes H2. O2 (2. H2. O2? 02 + 2. H2O).# Glutathione peroxidase---- Option C---- also protects against injury by catalyzing free radical breakdown(H2. O2 + 2. GSH? GSSG + 2. H2O, or 2. OH + 2. GSH? GSSG + 2. H2O). The intracellular ratio of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH) is a reflection of the oxidative state of the cell and is an important indicator of the cell's ability to detoxify ROS. REMOVAL OF FREE RADICALS: The principle free radicals (reactive Oxygen species) involved in cell injury are:# Superoxide dismutase (SOD):- in mitochondria- Converts O2 (superoxide) a H2. O2.# Catalase- In peroxisomes- Converts H2. O2 a H2O + O2.# Glutathione Peroxidase- in mitochondria.- Converts \"OH (hydroxyl radical) a H2. O2 a H2O + O2.# Peroxiredoxins- Cause conversion to HNO2.- In cytosol and mitochondria. Antioxidants either block the initiation of free radical formation or inactivate (e. g., scavenge) free radicals. Examples:# Lipid-soluble vitamins E and A as well as Vit C and glutathione in the cytosol.# Iron and copper can catalyze the formation of ROS. The levels of these reactive metals are minimized by binding of the ions to storage and transport proteins (e. g., transferrin, ferritin, lactoferrin, and ceruloplasmin), thereby minimizing the formation of ROS. GENERATION OF FREE RADICALS: Inflammation, radiation, O2 toxicity, chemicals and reperfusion injury results in free radical formation, wherein following are mainly involved:# NADPH oxidase, # Oxidases in peroxisomes# Superoxide dismutase (SOD), # NO synthase and# Generation from H2O by hydrolysis. Free radicals may be generated within cells in several ways# The reduction-oxidation reactions that occur during normal metabolic processes.# Absorption of radiant energy (e. g., ultraviolet light, x-rays).# Rapid bursts of ROS are produced in activated leukocytes during inflammation. This occurs by a precisely controlled reaction in a plasma membrane multiprotein complex that uses NADPH oxidase for the redox reaction (i. e. oxidative burst in phagocytes).# Enzymatic metabolism of exogenous chemicals or drugs# Transition metals such as iron and copper# Nitric oxide (NO), an important chemical mediator generated by endothelial cells, macrophages, neurons, and other cell types, can act as a free radical and can also be converted to highly reactive peroxynitrite anion (ONOO-) as well as NO2 and NO3.",

Ceain enzymes are activated by dephosphorylation Hepatic Protein Phosphatase-1 is a typical example where the enzyme itself is inhibited by phosphorylationof its regulatory subunit. When cyclic AMP level falls, the regulatory subunit is dephosphorylated and protein phosphatase becomes active, which in turn hydrolyzesphosphate group from the enzyme. Protein kinases, as well as protein phosphatases, are involved in the action of different hormones. The actions of c. AMP in eukaryotic cells are multifaceted and these include: A) Activation of Protein kinase and phosphorylation of effector proteins like enzymes and ion channels. These enzymes may directly phosphorylate enzymes or secondary kinases that phosphorylate other enzymes. For example, PKA phosphorylates hormone-sensitive lipase thus activating it. Phosphorylase Kinase that phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase. When ion channel proteins or transpoers are phosphorylated, the membrane potential is modified, thus regulating the influx of calcium.

When a GPCR is activated by its extracellular ligand, a conformational change is induced in the receptor that is transmitted to an attached intracellular heterotrimeric G protein complex. The Gs alpha subunit of the stimulated G protein complex exchanges GDP for GTP and is released from the complex. In a c. AMP-dependent pathway, the activated Gs alpha subunit binds to and activates an enzyme called adenylyl cyclase, which, in turn, catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cyclic adenosine monophosphate (c.

        "exp": "The replication always takes place from 5&; to 3&; direction in the new strand. The DNA polymerase enzyme is not able to synthesize the new strand at the 5&; end of the new strand. In other words, a small poion (about 300 nucleotides) in the 3&; ends of the parent strands could not be replicated (Fig. 40. 19). This end piece of the chromosome is called telomere. Therefore, another enzyme, telomere terminal transferase or telomerase takes up this job of replication of the end piece of chromosomes. After the normal replication, there is only single strand in this region; so this poion is degraded by exonucleases. This broken end leads to aberrant recombinations or end to end fusions. Unless there is some mechanism to replicate telomeres, the length of the chromosomes will go on reducing at each cell division (genes loss). The stability of the chromosome is thus lost. The shoening of the telomere end is prevented by an enzyme telomere terminal transferase or telomerase. It contains an essential RNA component, which provides the template for telomerase repeat synthesis. Telomerase acts like a reverse transcriptase. Telomerase recognizes 3&; end of the telomere, and then a small DNA strand is synthesized. Terminal restriction fragments from 70-year old donors are shoer than those from 20-year old ones. Thus, in old age, the telomerase activity is lost; leading to chromosome instability and cell death. As a general rule, cancer cells have continued presence of telomerase, and the chromosome length equilibrium is maintained, leading to continued cell division. As cancer cells have increased and persistent activity of telomerase, the cancer cells become immoal. Premature shoening of telomeres is seen in some types of aplastic anemia.

        "question": "A common feature of all serine proteases is",
        "exp": "The main player in the catalytic mechanism in the serine proteases is the catalytic triad. The triad is located in the active site of the enzyme, where catalysis occurs, and is preserved in all superfamilies of serine protease enzymes. These three key amino acids each play an essential role in the cleaving ability of the proteases. While the amino acid members of the triad are located far from one another on the sequence of the protein, due to folding, they will be very close to one another in the heart of the enzyme. The paicular geometry of the triad members are highly characteristic to their specific function: it was shown that the position of just four points of the triad characterize the function of the containing enzyme. Each amino acid in the triad performs a specific task in this process: The serine has an -OH group that is able to act as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon of the scissile peptide bond of the substrate. A pair of electrons on the histidine nitrogen has the ability to accept the hydrogen from the serine -OH group, thus coordinating the attack of the peptide bond. The carboxyl group on the aspaic acid in turn hydrogen bonds with the histidine, making the nitrogen atom mentioned above much more electronegative. The whole reaction can be summarized as follows: The polypeptide substrate binds to the surface of the serine protease enzyme such that the scissile bond is inseed into the active site of the enzyme, with the carbonyl carbon of this bond positioned near the nucleophilic serine. The serine -OH attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the nitrogen of the histidine accepts the hydrogen from the -OH of the and a pair of electrons from the double bond of the carbonyl oxygen moves to the oxygen. As a result, a tetrahedral intermediate is generated. The bond joining the nitrogen and the carbon in the peptide bond is now broken. The covalent electrons creating this bond move to attack the hydrogen of the histidine, breaking the connection. The electrons that previously moved from the carbonyl oxygen double bond move back from the negative oxygen to recreate the bond, generating an acyl-enzyme intermediate. Now, water comes in to the reaction. Water replaces the N-terminus of the cleaved peptide, and attacks the carbonyl carbon. Once again, the electrons from the double bond move to the oxygen making it negative, as the bond between the oxygen of the water and the carbon is formed. This is coordinated by the nitrogen of the histidine, which accepts a proton from the water. Overall, this generates another tetrahedral intermediate. In a final reaction, the bond formed in the first step between the serine and the carbonyl carbon moves to attack the hydrogen that the histidine just acquired. The now electron-deficient carbonyl carbon re-forms the double bond with the oxygen. As a result, the C-terminus of the peptide is now ejected.",
