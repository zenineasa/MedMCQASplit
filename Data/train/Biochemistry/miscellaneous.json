        "exp": "Marfan Syndrome Is Caused by Mutations in the Gene for Fibrillin-1. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. It affects the eyes (eg, causing dislocation of the lens, known as ectopia lentis), the skeletal system (most patients are tall and exhibit long digits and hyperextensibility of the joints), and the cardiovascular system (eg, causing weakness of the aoic media, leading to dilation of the ascending aoa). Abraham Lincoln may have had this condition. Most cases are caused by mutations in the gene (on chromosome 15) for fibrillin-1. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene have also been identified as the cause of acromicric dysplasia and geleophysic dysplasia, which are characterized by sho stature, skin thickening, and stiff joints. Congenital contractural arachnodactyly is associated with a mutation in the gene for fibrillin-2. Ref: Harper&; s Biochemistry; 30th edition; Chapter 50; The Extracellular Matrix",

The biochemical defect in MSUD involves the a-keto acid decarboxylase complex Plasma and urinary levels of leucine, isoleucine, valine, and their a-keto acids and a-hydroxy acids (reduced a-keto acids) are elevated, but the urinary keto acids derive principally from leucine. Signs and symptoms of MSUD include often fatal ketoacidosis, neurological derangements, mental retardation, and a maple syrup odor of urine. The mechanism of toxicity is unknown. Early diagnosis by enzymatic analysis is essential to avoid brain damage and early moality by replacing dietary protein by an amino acid mixture that lacks leucine, isoleucine, and valine. The molecular genetics of MSUD are heterogeneous. MSUD can result from mutations in the genes that encode E1a, E1b, E2, and E3. Based on the locus affected, genetic subtypesof MSUD are recognized. Type IA MSUD arises from mutations in the E1a gene, type IB in the E1b gene, type II in the E2 gene, and type III in the E3 gene. Reference: Harper biochemistry page no 309",

Current prenatal diagnostic methods for haemophilia are invasive and pose a risk to the fetus. Cell-free fetal DNA analysis in maternal plasma provides a noninvasive mean of assessing fetal sex in such pregnancies. However, the disease status of male fetuses remains unknown if mutation-specific confirmatory analysis is not performed. Here we have developed a noninvasive test to diagnose whether the fetus has inherited a causative mutation for haemophilia from its mother. The strategy is based on a relative mutation dosage approach, which we have previously established for determining the mutational status of fetuses for autosomal disease mutations. In this study, the relative mutation dosage method is used to deduce whether a fetus has inherited a haemophilia mutation on chromosome X by detecting whether the concentration of the mutant or wild-type allele is overrepresented in the plasma of heterozygous women carrying male fetuses. We correctly detected fetal genotypes for haemophilia mutations in all of the 12 studied maternal plasma samples obtained from at-risk pregnancies from as early as the 11th week of gestation. This development would make the decision to undeake prenatal testing less traumatic and safer for at-risk families.",

        "exp": "Antigen-presenting cells fall into two categories: professional and non-professional. Those that express MHC class II molecules along with co-stimulatory molecules and pattern recognition receptors are often called professional antigen-presenting cells. The non-professional APCs express MHC class I molecules. An antigen-presenting cell (APC) or accessory cell is a cell that displays antigen complexed with major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on their surfaces; this process is known as antigen presentation. T cells may recognize these complexes using their T cell receptors (TCRs). These cells process antigens and present them to T-cells. Professional antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages, B cells and dendritic cells, present foreign antigens to helper T cells, while other cell types can present antigens originating inside the cell to cytotoxic T cells. In addition to the MHC family of proteins, antigen presentation relies on other specialized signalling molecules on the surfaces of both APCs and T cells. Dendritic cells (DC). Dendritic cells have the broadest range of antigen presentation and are necessary for activation of naive T cells. DCs present antigen to both helper and cytotoxic T cells. They can also perform cross-presentation, a process by which they present exogenous antigen on MHC class I molecules to cytotoxic T cells. Cross-presentation allows for the activation of these T cells. Dendritic cells also play a role in peripheral tolerance, which contributes to prevention of auto-immune disease. Macrophages. Macrophages can be stimulated by T cell secretion of interferon gamma. After this activation, macrophages are able to express MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules, including the B7 complex and can, present phagocytosed peptide fragments to helper T cells. Activation can assist pathogen-infected macrophages in clearing the infection. B cellsB cells can internalize antigen that binds to their B cell receptor and presents it to helper T cells. Unlike T cells, B cells can recognize soluble antigen for which their B cell receptor is specific. They can then process the antigen and present peptides using MHC class II molecules. When a T helper cell with a TCR specific for that peptide binds, the B cell marker CD40 binds to CD40L on the T cell surface. When activated by a T cell, a B cell can undergo antibody isotype switching, affinity maturation, as well as the formation of memory cells.",

But this lactate or <a href=\" acid</a> can build up in your bloodstream faster than you can burn it off. The point when lactic acid stas to build up is called the \"lactate threshold. \"Inhibition of Pyruvate Metabolism. Leads to Lactic Acidosis. Arsenite and mercuric ions react with the 'SH groups of lipoic acid and inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase, as does a dietary deficiency of thiamin (see Chapter 44), allowing pyruvate to accumulate. Many alcoholics are thiamin deficient (both because of a poor diet and also because alcohol inhibits thiamin absorption), and may develop potentially fatal pyruvic and lactic acidosis. Patients with inherited pyruvate dehydrogenasedeficiency, which can be the result of defects in one or more of the components of the enzyme complex, also present with lactic acidosis, paicularly after a glucose load. Because of the dependence of the brain on glucose as a fuel, these metabolic defects commonly cause neurological disturbances. Inherited aldolase A deficiency and pyruvate kinase deficiency in erythrocytes cause hemolytic anemia. The exercisecapacity of patients with muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency is low, paicularly if they are on high-carbohydrate diets. By providing lipid as an alternative fuel, for example, during starvation, when blood free fatty acid and ketone bodies are increased, work capacity is improved.
