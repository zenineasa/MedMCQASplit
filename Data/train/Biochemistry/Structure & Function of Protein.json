Transaminationo Transamination involves the reversible transfer of a-amino group of a-amino acid to an a-keto acidQ to form a new amino acid and a new keto acid. The enzyme catalyze the reaction is called aminotransferase (transaminase). Most transaminases use a-ketoglutarate (a-keto acid) as a common acceptor of a-amino group of a-amino acids. All transaminases require pyridoxal phosphate (Vitamin B6) as a coenzymneQ. Some of the most important transaminases are: -i) Alanine transaminase (ALT) also called glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT): - It catalyzes the transfer of amino group of alanine to a-ketoglutarate resulting in formation of pyruvate and L-glutamate Q. ii) Aspartate transaminase (AST) also called glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT): It catalyzes the transfer of amino group of aspartate to a-ketoefutarate resulting in formation of oxaloacetate and L-glutamate.
