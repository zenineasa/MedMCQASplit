Human telomeres have a variable number of repeats of the sequence 5'-TTAGGG-3', which can extend for several kilobases.* Telomerase, is related to viral RNA-dependent DNA polymerases (reverse transcriptases) and is the enzyme responsible for telomere synthesis and thus for maintaining the length of the telomere.* Telomere shortening has been associated with both aging and malignant transformation. Because of this reason, telomerase has become an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy and drug development.",

No, glycine is simplest amino acid and not affected by p. HOption c. False. No, it is steric hinderance is there due to branched chain amino acid. Option d. False. No, false, it is not affected by pH due to guanidino group. Option e. False. No, not affected due to aromaticity. At physiological pH (around 7. 4) the carboxyl group of the amino acid is unprotonated and the amino group is protonated. Thus an amino acid with no ionizable R-group would be electrically neutral at this pH. This species is termed a zwitterion. Histidine is a unique amino acid as p. Ka of its imidazole group permits it at pH 7 to function either as a base or as an acid. A minor change in pH changes the ionization charge on histidine to buffer pH change. Therefore it can serve as a buffer and is most stable at physiological pH. However, when histidine is incorporated into a protein, its side chain can be either positively charged or neutral, depending on the ionic environment provided by the polypeptide chains of the protein. This is an important property of histidine that contributes to the role it plays in the functioning of proteins such as hemoglobin.

Steps of Synthesis of Heme* To produce 1 molecule of heme, 8 molecules each of glycine and succinyl-CoA are required.* It is divided into1. Synthesis of Porphobilinogen (Monopyrrole)2. Synthesis of Uroporphyrinogen (Tetrapyrrole)3. Conversion of Uroporphyrinogen to Protoporphyrin4. Formation of Heme by incorporation iron. 1. Synthesis of Porphobilinogen (Monopyrrole)ALA Synthase (ALAS)* Catalyse condensation reaction between succinyl-CoA and glycine to form a-amino-ketoadipic acid, which is rapidly decarboxylated to form S-aminolevulinate (ALA).* Synthesis of ALA occurs in mitochondria.* Two isoforms of ALAS# ALAS-I the Hepatic Form is the Key regulatory enzyme # ALAS-11 is the Erythropoietic form. ALA Dehydratase* Two molecules of ALA are condensed by the enzyme ALA dehydratase to form two molecules of water and one of porphobilinogen (PBG)* Takes place in the cytosol.* ALA dehydratase is a zinc-containing enzyme* This enzyme is sensitive to inhibition by lead, as can occur in lead poisoning.* Thus the first precursor pyrrole is formed. 2. Synthesis of Uroporphyrinogen (Tetrapyrrole)* The formation of a cyclic tetrapyrrole-i. e. a porphyrin- occurs by condensation of four molecules of PBG. Uroporphyrinogen -I Synthase or HMB Synthase or PBG Deaminase* Four molecules of PBG condense in a head-to-tail manner to form a linear tetrapyrrole, hydroxymethylbilane (HMB).* 4 moles of NH3, is released* Takes place in the cytosol.* The reaction is catalyzed by uroporphyrinogen I synthase, also named PBG deaminase or HMB synthase. Uroporphyrinogen III synthase* HMB is converted to Uroporphyrinogen III by Uroporphyrinogen III synthase.* Uroporphyrinogen is thus the first porphyrin precursor formed.* Under normal conditions, the uroporphyrinogen formed is almost exclusively the III isomer. But HMB cyclizes in certain porphyrias, spontaneously to form uroporphyrinogen I. 3. Conversion of Uroporphyrinogen to Protoporphyrin* Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase# Uroporphyrinogen II is converted to coproporphyrinogen III by decarboxylation of all of the acetate (A) groups, which changes them to methyl (M) substituents.# The reaction is catalyzed by uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.# This is also capable of converting uroporphyrinogen I to coproporphyrinogen I# This also takes place in the cytosol# Coproporphyrinogen III then enters the mitochondria, where it is converted to protoporphyrinogen III.# The mitochondrial enzyme coproporphyrinogen Oxidase catalyzes the decarboxylation and oxidation of two propionic side chains to form protoporphyrinogen.# This enzyme is able to act only on type-III coproporphyrinogen, which would explain why type I protoporphyrins do not generally occur in nature.* Protoporphyrinogen Oxidase# The oxidation of protoporphyrinogen to protoporphyrin is catalyzed by another mitochondrial enzyme, protoporphyrinogen oxidase. 4. Formation of Heme by incorporation of Iron* This is the final step in heme synthesis.* It involves the incorporation of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin in a reaction.* This step is catalyzed by ferrochelatase (heme synthase).* Takes place in mitochondria.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Alanine* Two mechanisms are available for transport of ammonia from the peripheral tissues to the liver. 1) In the form of glutamine# In many tissues like liver, kidney and brain, ammonia combines with glutamate to yield glutamine, by the action of glutamine synthase. The brain is a rich source of glutamine synthase and it predominantly detoxifies ammonia by this route.# Glutamine is a nontoxic major transport form of ammonia. The glutamine is transported by blood to liver where deamination (removal of amino group) of glutamine takes place. Glutaminase cleaves glutamine to yield glutamate and free ammonia (ammonium ion). The ammonia is converted by liver to urea. Glutamine. H2O-----------------Glutaminase. Glutamate + NH4# Formation and secretion ammonia by renal tubular cells maintain acid base balance. Ammonia is formed from glutamine by glutaminase. Excretion of ammonia increases in metabolic acidosis and decreases in metabolic alkalosis. 2) In the form of alanine# Alanine transports ammonia from muscles to liver through 'glucose-alanine cycle'# In muscle, glutamate is formed from ammonia and a-ketoglutarate by reversal of the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction. L-glutamate then transfers its a-amino group to pyruvate by transmination reaction to form alanine.# Alanine is transported to liver. In liver alanine is converted to pyruvate and glutamate by transamination reaction. Glutamate undergoes oxidative deamination to release free ammonia, which is converted to urea. Pyruvate is converted to glucose by gluconeogenesis.",

An iron porphyrin metalloprotein that is inducible in liver by adrenal corticosteroids and by tryptophan, tryptophan oxygenase is feedback- inhibited by nicotinic acid derivatives, including NADPH. Hydrolytic removal of the formyl group of N- formylkynurenine, catalyzed by kynurenine formylase, produces kynurenine. Since kynureninase requires pyridoxal phosphate, excretion of xanthurenate in response to a tryptophan load is diagnostic of vitamin B6 deficiency.

        "exp": "Some amino acids (isoleucine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine) are both glucogenic and ketogenic because their degradation pathway forms multiple products. a. Amino acids that are converted to pyruvate (see Figure I). (1). The amino acids that are synthesized from the intermediates of glycolysis (serine, glycine, cysteine, and alanine) are degraded to form pyruvate. (a). Serine is converted to 2-phosphoglycerate, an intermediate of glycolysis, or directly to pyruvate and NH4+ by serine dehydratase, an enzyme that requires PLP. (b). Glycine, in a reversal of the reaction utilized for its synthesis, reacts with methylene-FH4 to form serine. 1. Glycine also reacts with FH4 and NAD+ to produce CO2 and NH4+ (glycine cleavage enzyme). 2. Glycine can be converted to glyoxylate, which can be oxidized to CO2 and H2 O or converted to oxalate. (c). Cysteine forms pyruvate. Its sulfur, which was derived from methionine, is converted to H2 SO4, which is excreted by the kidneys. (d). Alanine can be transaminated to pyruvate. b. Amino acids that are converted to intermediates of the TCA cycle (see Figure II). (1). The carbons from the four groups of amino acids form the TCA cycle intermediates: a-ketoglutarate, succinyl-CoA, fumarate, and oxaloacetate. (a). Amino acids that form a-ketoglutarate (see Figure III). 1. Glutamate can be deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase or transaminated to form a- ketoglutarate. 2. Glutamine is converted by glutaminase to glutamate with the release of its amide nitrogen as NH4+ 3. Proline is oxidized so that its ring opens, forming glutamate semialdehyde, which is oxidized to glutamate. 4. Arginine is cleaved by arginase in the liver to form urea and ornithine. Ornithine is transaminated to glutamate semialdehyde, which is oxidized to glutamate. 5. Histidine is converted to formiminoglutamate (FIGLU). The formimino group is transferred to FH4, and the remaining five carbons form glutamate. (b). Amino acids that form succinyl-CoA (see Figure IV)1. Four amino acids are converted to propionyl-CoA, which is carboxylated in a biotin requiring reaction to form methylmalonyl-CoA, which is rearranged to form succinyl-CoA in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 (seen previously in the metabolism of odd-chain number fatty acids). a). Threonine is converted by a dehydratase to NH4+ and a-ketobutyrate, which is oxidatively decarboxylated to propionyl-CoA. In a different set of reactions, threonine is converted to glycine and acetyl-CoA. b). Methionine provides methyl groups for the synthesis of various compounds; its sulfur is incorporated into cysteine; and the remaining carbons form succinyl-CoA. i. Methionine and ATP form S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which donates a methyl group and forms homocysteine. ii. Homocysteine is reconverted to methionine by accepting a methyl group from the FH4 pool via vitamin B12. iii. Homocysteine can also react with serine to form cystathionine. The cleavage of cystathionine produces cysteine, NH4+, and a-ketobutyrate, which is converted to propionyl-CoA. c). Valine and isoleucine, two of the three branched-chain amino acids, form succinyl-CoA (see Figure IV). i. The degradation of all the three branched-chain amino acids begins with a transamination followed by an oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (Figure V). This enzyme, like pyruvate dehydrogenase and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, requires thiamine pyrophosphate, lipoic acid, CoA, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and NAD+. ii. Valine is eventually converted to succinyl-CoA via propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA. iii. Isoleucine also forms succinyl-CoA after two of its carbons are released as acetyl-CoA. (c). Amino acids that form fumarate1. Three amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and aspartate) are converted to fumarate (see Figure II). a). Phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase in a reaction requiring tetrahydrobiopterin and O2 (Figure VI). b). Tyrosine, obtained from the diet or by hydroxylation of phenylalanine, is converted to homogentisic acid. The aromatic ring is opened and cleaved, forming fumarate and acetoacetate. c). Aspartate is converted to fumarate via reactions of the urea cycle and the purine nucleotide cycle. d). Aspartate reacts with IMP to form AMP and fumarate in the purine nucleotide cycle. (d). Amino acids that form oxaloacetate (see Figure II)1. Aspartate is transaminated to form oxaloacetate. 2. Asparagine loses its amide nitrogen as NH4+, forming aspartate in a reaction catalyzed by asparaginase. c. Amino acids that are converted to acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate (see Figure VI). (1). Four amino acids (lysine, threonine, isoleucine, and tryptophan) can form acetyl-CoA, and phenylalanine and tyrosine form acetoacetate. Leucine is degraded to form both acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate. In maple syrup urine disease, the a-keto acid dehydrogenase involved in metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (valine, isoleucine, and leucine) is defective. Mc. Ardle disease is caused by a defective muscle glycogen phosphorylase, such that the muscle cannot generate glucose from glycogen, leading to exercise intolerance. Glycogen accumulates in the muscle because of this enzyme deficiency (Mc. Ardle disease is one of the glycogen storage disease). A defect in the synthesis or processing of collagen will lead to a variety of diseases, of which Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is one (osteogenesis imperfecta is another). Parkinson disease is caused by low levels of dopamine in the nervous system. In the initial stages of Parkinson disease, giving DOPA can reduce the severity of the symptoms because DOPA can be decarboxylated to form dopamine. DOPA can easily enter the brain, whereas dopamine cannot. Tay-Sachs disease results from an inability to degrade GM2, a ganglioside (it is also a sphingolipid). The enzyme missing is b-hexosaminidase. I. Amino acids derived from the intermediates of glycolysis. These amino acids can be synthesized from glucose and can be reconverted to glucose in the liver. II. The degradation of amino acids. A. Amino acids that produce pyruvate or the intermediates of the TCA cycle. These amino acids are considered glucogenic because their carbons can produce glucose in the liver. B. Amino acids that produce acetyl-CoA or ketone bodies. These amino acids are considered ketogenic. CoA, coenzyme A; HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA; TCA, tricarboxylic acid. III. Amino acids related through glutamate. These amino acids contain carbons that can be converted to glutamate, which can be converted to glucose in the liver. All of these amino acids except histidine can be synthesized from glucose. IV. Amino acids that can be converted to succinyl-CoA. The amino acids methionine, threonine, isoleucine, and valine, which form succinyl-CoA via methyl malonyl-CoA, are all essential. Because succinyl-CoA can form glucose, these amino acids are glucogenic. The carbons of serine are converted to cysteine and do not form succinyl-CoA by this pathway. A defect in cystathionine synthase causes homocystinuria. A defect in cystathionase causes cystathioninuria. B12-CH3, methyl cobalamin; N5-CH3-FH4, N 5- methyl tetrahydrofolate; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; TCA, tricarboxylic acid. V.

CoA, coenzyme A; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA. VI. A. Ketogenic amino acids. Some of these amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine) also contain carbons that can form glucose. Leucine and lysine are strictly ketogenic; they do not form glucose. B. A deficiency in various steps leads to the diseases indicated.

Proline and lysine residues are hydroxylated by a reaction that requires O2 and vitamin C. c. Galactose and glucose are added to hydroxylysine residues. d. The triple helix forms, and procollagen is secreted from the cell and cleaved to form collagen. e. Cross-links are produced. The side chains of lysine and hydroxylysine residues are oxidized to form aldehydes, which can undergo aldol condensation or form Schiff bases with the amino groups of lysine residues. A defect in the synthesis or processing of collagen will lead to a variety of diseases, of which Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is one (osteogenesis imperfecta is another). Parkinson disease is caused by low levels of dopamine in the nervous system. In the initial stages of Parkinson disease, giving dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) can reduce the severity of the symptoms because DOPA can be decarboxylated to form dopamine. DOPA can easily enter the brain, whereas dopamine cannot. Tay-Sachs disease results from an inability to degrade GM2, a ganglioside (it is also a sphingolipid). The enzyme missing is b-hexosaminidase. Mc. Ardle disease is caused by a defective muscle glycogen phosphorylase, such that the muscle cannot generate glucose from glycogen, leading to exercise intolerance. Maple syrup urine disease is caused by the lack of branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase activity, a necessary step in the metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine).",

Astrocytes contribute to 30% of cells in the Central Nervous System. Within astrocytes, as p. Ka of ammonia is very high, it sequestrates hydrogen ions to form ammonium ions. Ammonium ions are positively charged. Additionally, ammonia reacts with glutamate to form glutamine. Glutamine is also positively charged. Both ammonium ions and glutamine, being positively charged, they attract water (Ammonium and glutamine are osmotically active). This causes astrocytes swelling. Neuronal swelling in respiratory centre causes hyperventilation and the person presents with repiratory alkalosis.# As glutamate levels are low, the neuronal activity is reduced. This explains depression, coma and EEG abnormalities (characteristic slowing of waves with high amplitude)* Hence, all features of hepatic encephalopathy are explained by hyperammonemia.",

The ratio of these two catechola- mines in humans is roughly 8: 1, with 80% of the catecholamine output being epinephrine. Synthesis of catecholamines begins with the amino acid tyrosine, which is taken up by chromaffin cells in the medulla and converted to norepinephrine and epinephrine through the following steps: SYNTHESIS AND SECRETION OF CATECHOLAMINESSTEPS IN CATECHOLAMINE SYNTHESISCatecholamines are synthesized from the amino acid phenylalanine. Tyrosine hydroxylase is the rate limiting enzyme and its inhibition by alphamethyl-p-tyrosine results in depletion of CAs; this can be used in pheochro- mocytoma before surgery and in inoperable cases. All enzymes of CA synthesis are rather nonspecific and can act on closely related substrates, e. g. dopa decarboxylase can form 5-HT from 5-hydroxytryptophan and a methyl DA from a methyl dopa. Synthesis of NA occurs in all adrenergic neurones, while that of Adr occurs only in the adrenal medullary cells. It probably requires high cone of glucocorticoids reaching through intraadrenal portal circulation for induction of the methylating enzyme.# Secretions of Norepinephrine and epinephrine stored in electron-dense granules are stimulated by acetylcholine release from preganglionic sympathetic fibers innervating the medulla.# Many types of \"stresses\" stimulate such secretion, including exercise, hypoglycemia and trauma.# STEPS:- Tyrosine is transported into catecholamine-secreting neurons and adrenal medullary cells where catecholamine synthesis takes place.- The first step in the process requires tyrosine hydroxylase, which like phenylalanine hydroxylase requires tetrahydrobiopterin (HJB) as cofactor.- The hydroxylation reaction generates DOPA (3, 4-dihydrophenylalanine).- DOPA decarboxylase converts DOPA to dopamine, dopamine P-hydroxylase converts dopamine to norepinephrine, and phenylethanolamine.- N-methyltransferase converts norepinephrine to epinephrine.- Tyrosine=> DOPA (HYDROXYLATION)- DOPA=> Dopamine (DECARBOXYLATION)- Dopamine=> Norepinephrine (HYDROXYLATION)- Norepinephrine=> Epinephrine (METHYLATION)# This latter reaction is one of several in the body that uses SAM (S-adenosylhomocysteine) as a methyl donor.

        "question": "Bilirubin is absent in urine because it is:",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e. Lipophilic: Unconjugated bilirubin is absent in urine but conjugated bilirubin can be present in it. But I think that the examiner is talking about unconjugated bilirubin as 90% bilirubin in the serum is unconjugated. Unconjugated bilirubin is highly lipid soluble (Lipophilic) and has limited aqueous solubility thus it is not able to pass out in urine. Moreover unconjugated bilirubin is tightly bound to albumin and therefore not filtered by renal glomeruli. In contrast, conjugated bilirubin is water soluble, and easily filtered by the renal glomeruli.. Metabolism of bilirubin:** Sources of bilirubin. RBC's (old, senescent) 80%Ineffective erythropoiesis. Metabolism of other heme containing proteins. This unconjugated bilirubin is not water soluble so is bound to albumin for its transfer in plasma. Liver uptakes this unconjugated bilirubin and conjugates it with glucuronic acid, generating bilirubin glucuronide which is water soluble. Conjugated bilirubin (i. e. bilirubin glucuronide) is excreted in bile into the duodenum. Conjugated bilibrium is not reabsorbed by the intestinal mucosa. It is either excreted unchanged in the stools or metabolised by ileal and colonic bacteria to urobilinogen and related products. Urobilinogen can be reabsorbed from the small intestine and colon and enters the portal circulation. Some of the portal urobilinogen is taken up by the liver and reexcreted into the bile, and the remainder bypasses the liver and is excreted by the kidney. Urinary urobilinogen is a useful tool: for distinguishing possible causes of hyperbilirubinemia. Urinary urobilinogen excretion is increased in*:- * When production of bilirubin is greatly increased (eg. With hemolysis)** When the hepatic uptake and excretion of urobilinogen is impaired (eg in hepatocellular disease)*Urinary urobilinogen excretion is decreased in*:- * Cholestasis or extrahepatic biliary obstruction (Obstructive Jaundice)*",

Amino acids that contain an equal number of ionizablegroups of opposite charge and that therefore bear no netcharge are termed zwitter ions. The pH at which the molecule carries no net charge is known as iso-electric point or iso-electric pH (pI) At isoelectric point, the number of anions and cationspresent on protein molecule will be equal and net charge iszero. At iso-electric point the amino acid will carry no net charge, all the groups are ionized but the charges will cancel eachother.

Hyperphenylalaninemia may also be caused by deficiencies in the enzymes that synthesize or reduce the coenzyme tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4 ). It is important to distinguish among the various forms of hyperphenylalaninemia, because their clinical management is different. For example, a small fraction of PKU is a result of a deficiency in either dihydropteridine (BH2 ) reductase or BH2 synthetase. These mutations prevent synthesis of BH4, and indirectly raise phenylalanine concentrations, because phenylalanine hydroxylase requires BH4 as a coenzyme.

On supersaturation, cysteine forms a dimer which is cystine. Cystine is insoluble in water and hence it precipitates to form renal stones. Hence Cystinuria presents as recurrent renal stones.",

But when heme molecule is associated with Histidine E7 [( as occurs in myoglobin), its affinity for CO is drastically reduced, because the presence of His E7 creates a hindered environment for CO by disturbing the orientation of atoms in the heme molecule. See what Harper writes- \"Carbon monoxide (CO) binds to isolated heme about 25000times more strongly than does oxygen. The atmosphere contains traces of CO, and normal catabolism of heme itself forms small quantities of CO. Why then does not CO (rather than 02) occupy the sixth coordination position of the heme iron of myoglobin? The answer lies in the hindered environment of heme in myoglobin. The preferred orientation for CO to heme iron is with all three atoms (Fe, C, and O) perpendicular to heme ring.* While this orientation is possible for isolated heme, in myoglobin the distal histidine (His-E7) sterically hinders binding of CO at this angle. *Angles for bonding of oxygen and carbon monoxide to the heme iron of myoglobin. The distal E7 histidine hinders bonding of CO at the preferred (180-degree) angle to the plane of the heme ring. This forces CO to bind in a less favoured configuration and reduces the strength of the heme - CO bond over two orders of magnitude\"",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Protein folding* Chaperones are proteins which help in folding or unfolding of proteins* Molecular chaperones prevent aggregation and promote refolding after stress and hence promote cell survival. This so-called stress response is ubiquitous and conserved across all organisms. Hence Chaperones are otherwise known as heat shock proteins (HSP)* Chaperones are synthesized in response to heat and other stress conditions like, exposure to heavy metals, UV radiation, oxidative stress, nutrient deficiencies, dehydration, osmotic pressures and viral infections. Hence, they are otherwise called as stress proteins* Heat shock proteins are evolutionarily conserved, abundant and ubiquitous proteins in all cells and play similar roles in organisms from bacteria to humans. They are amongst the most highly expressed and can account for 1-2 % of the total protein in unstressed cells, and this can increase up to 4-6 % after heat shock* Some chaperone systems work as foldases: they support the folding of proteins in an ATP-dependent manner (for example, the Gro. EL/Gro. ES or the DnaK / DnaJ / GrpE system). Other chaperones work as holdases: they bind folding intermediates to prevent their aggregation, for example DnaJ or Hsp33* The human heat shock proteins have been renamed to the following: HSPH (former name HSP110), HSPC (HSP90), HSPA (HSP70), HSPD/E (HSP60/HSP10) and CCT (TRiC), DNAJ (HSP40), and HSPB (small HSP or s. HSP)* Despite the fact that heat shock proteins differ in their size, structures and activity, they all bind non-native proteins (some bind native proteins as well); and some exert their functions co-translationally by interacting with nascent polypeptides, while others act post-translationally by providing an environment that enhances folding.* Most heat shock proteins are ATP-dependent and require ATP to control binding and dissociation of substrate polypeptides, while some use an ATP-independent mechanism.* Thus, # Chaperones are otherwise called as heat shock proteins. But not all heat shock proteins are chaperones. Heat shock proteins also perform some function other than protein folding.# Chaperones are not always ATP dependent.# Chaperones do not always bind to specific segments of polypeptide chain, some just provide the environment for protein folding.# Chaperones act as either foldases or holdases.",

HYPERMETHIONINEMIASecondary hypermethioninemia occurs in liver disease, tyrosinemia type I, and classic homocystinuria. Hypermethioninemia has also been found in infants receiving high-protein diets, in whom it may represent delayed maturation of the enzyme methionine adenosyl-transferase. Primary hypermethioninemia is caused by the deficiency of hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase. The majority of these patients have been diagnosed in the neonatal period through screening for homocystinuria. Affected individuals with residual enzyme activity remain asymptomatic throughout life despite persistent hypermethioninemia. Some complain of unusual odor to their breath and urine (boiled cabbage). A few patients with complete enzyme deficiency have had neurologic abnormalities related to demyelination (mental retardation, dystonia, dyspraxia). The gene for methionine adenosyltransferase is on chromosome 10q22. A novel defect, glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency, also causes isolated hypermethioninemia.",

This is because only the glycine is small enough to be accommodated in the limited space available down the central core of the triple helix. Each turn of polypeptide chain (a-chain) contains three amino acid residues, and glycine (Gly) is present at every third position. Thus glycine constitutes 33% of the total amino acid residues. The repeating amino acid residues, represented as (Gly-X-Y)n, is an absolute requirement for formation of triple helix. X and Y can be any amino acids, but most of the time X is proline (10% of the total amino acid residues) and most of the time Y is hydroxyproline. Other important amino acids found in collagen are lysine and hydroxylysine.* Two amino acids helps in formation of triple-helixi). Proline: Introduces sharp bends in the polypeptide chains (a-chains)ii) Glycine: It plays an indirect role in permitting extremely tight interwinding of the a-chains.

Amino acid like Tryptophan is converted to indole in the intestine.* Following absorption, indole is converted to 3-hvdroxyindole (i. e, indoxyl, indican) in the liver, where it is conjugated with potassium sulfate or glucuronic acid. Subsequently, it is transported to the kidneys for excretion (i. e, indicanuria).* Other tryptophan degradation products which are excreted in urine are: kynurenine and serotonin.* In these patients Tubular renal transport is also defective, contributing to gross aminoaciduria.",

A vitamin B12 deficiency results in the excretion of methylmalonic acid in the urine and an increased dietary requirement for methionine. The methyl group transferred from vitamin B12 to homocysteine to form methionine comes from N5-methyl-FH4, which accumulates in a vitamin B12 deficiency, causing a decrease in free folate levels and symptoms of folate deficiency, including increased levels of FIGLU and decreased purine biosynthesis. Both B12 and folate deficiencies will lead to anemia, but only a B12 deficiency will give rise to the mental status changes and tingling in the hands and feet.

Hyper ammonia can be caused by a variety of urea cycle defects including carbamoyl phosphate synthase I deficiency (237300). c. The high levels of NH/ in the blood lead to very high levels of glutamine synthesis that may well be responsible for the subsequent brain damage. Deficiency of liver phenylalanine hydroxylase causes phenylketonuria. Consequently, high levels of phenylalanine are not converted to tyrosine. d. Phenylalanine and its metabolites accumulate in blood, leading to mental retardation if infants are not placed on a phenylalanine-restricted diet.

        "question": "Mc. Ardle disease can be caused by a problem with the metabolism of which particular compound.",
        "exp": "We will illustrate, in addition, how biochemical measurements can pinpoint a disorder and allow one to determine which enzyme is functioning improperly. a. Mouth(1). Salivary glands produce a-amylase, which cleaves a-1, 4 bonds between glucose residues in dietary starch. (Pancreatic a-amylase catalyzes the same reaction.)b. Stomach(1). Chief cells produce the proteolytic enzyme pepsin, as its inactive precursor pepsinogen. Pepsin digests proteins. (2). Parietal cells produce hydrochloric acid (HCl) and intrinsic factor. (a). HCl causes pepsinogen (the precursor of pepsin) to cleave itself (autocatalysis), producing pepsin. (b). Intrinsic factor binds dietary vitamin B12 and aids in its absorption. (c). Vitamin B12 is the cofactor for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine and methyl malonyl-CoA to succinyl-Co. Ac. Gallbladder(1). Bile salts, synthesized in the liver from cholesterol, pass through the gallbladder into the intestine, where they aid in lipid digestion. (2). Bilirubin diglucuronide, produced in the liver from bilirubin (the excretory product of heme degradation), passes through the gallbladder into the intestine. d. Pancreas(1). The pancreas produces bicarbonate (HCO3- ), which neutralizes stomach acid as it enters the intestinal lumen. The subsequent increase in pH in the lumen allows more extensive ionization of bile salts (so they serve as better detergents) and increases the activity of digestive enzymes. (2). The pancreas produces digestive enzymes (e. g., trypsin, chymotrypsin, the carboxypeptidases, elastase, a-amylase, lipase). (3). The B (or b) cells of the endocrine pancreas produce insulin (the hormone that stimulates the storage of fuels in the fed state) and the A (or a) cells produce glucagon (the hormone that stimulates the release of stored fuels during fasting). e. Intestine(1). The enzymes from the exocrine pancreas digest food in the intestinal lumen. (2). The intestinal digestive enzymes are bound to the brush borders of intestinal epithelial cells (aminopeptidases, dipeptidases and tripeptidases, lactase, sucrase, maltases, and isomaltases). (3). The absorption of digestive products occurs through the intestinal epithelial cells. (4). The intestinal epithelial cells produce chylomicrons from the digestive products of dietary fat (fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerols) and secrete the chylomicrons into the lymph. (5). Most bile salts are resorbed in the ileum and recycled by the liver. Only 5% are excreted in the feces. This excretion of bile salts, along with cholesterol secreted by the liver into the gut via the gallbladder, is the major means by which the body disposes of the cholesterol ring structure (sterol nucleus). f. Liver (the enzymic regulation of liver function is summarized in Tables below)(1). Functions of the liver include:(a). Storage of glycogen produced from dietary carbohydrate. (b). Synthesis of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), mainly from dietary carbohydrate. (c). Production of high-density lipoprotein, which transfers CII and E apolipoproteins to chylomicrons and VLDL, converts cholesterol to cholesterol esters (via the lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase reaction), and reduces blood by which cholesterol and cholesterol esters are transported from tissues to the liver (reverse cholesterol transport). (d). Maintenance of blood glucose levels during fasting via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. (e). Production of urea from nitrogen derived, in part, from amino acids because they are being converted to glucose (via gluconeogenesis) during fasting. (f). Production of ketone bodies from fatty acids derived from lipolysis of adipose triacylglycerols during fasting. (g). Synthesis of cholesterol (which is also made in other tissues). (h). Conversion of cholesterol to bile salts. (i). Production of many blood proteins (e. g., albumin, blood-clotting proteins). (j). Production of purines and pyrimidines, which are transported to other tissues via red blood cells. (k). Degradation of purines (to uric acid) and pyrimidines (to CO2, H2 O, and ammonia). (l). Oxidation of drugs and other toxic compounds via the cytochrome P450 system. (m). Conjugation of bilirubin and excretion of bilirubin diglucuronide into the bile. (n). Oxidation of alcohol via alcohol and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases and the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS). (o). Synthesis of creatine (from guanidinoacetate), which is used to produce creatine phosphate, mainly in the muscle and brain. (p). Conversion of dietary fructose to glycolytic intermediates. (2). If liver cell function is compromised (e. g., in viral hepatitis or alcoholic cirrhosis):(a). NH4+, which is toxic (particularly to the central nervous system), increases in the blood. (b). The BUN level decreases because the liver has a decreased capacity to produce urea. (c). Blood glucose decreases because of decreased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. (d). Blood cholesterol levels decrease owing to an inability to produce and secrete VLDL. (e). The production of bile salts decreases. (f). Bilirubin levels increase in the body (causing jaundice) because of reduced conjugation with glucuronic acid. (g). Lysis of damaged liver cells allows enzymes to leak into the blood. 1. Lactate dehydrogenase increases. 2. Alanine aminotransferase increases. 3. Aspartate aminotransferase increases. 4. Alkaline phosphatase increases. (h). Chronic liver problems result in decreased protein synthesis. 1. Serum proteins (e. g., albumin) decrease. 2. VLDL production decreases because of decreased apolipoprotein B-100 and triacylglycerols accumulate in the liver. A fatty liver results. g. Brain(1). Glucose is the major fuel for the brain. (2). The brain can use ketone bodies, but only after 3 to 5 days of fasting when blood ketone body levels are elevated. (3). The brain needs energy to think (i. e., memory involves RNA synthesis), conduct nerve impulses, synthesize neurotransmitters, and so on. h. Red blood cells(1). Red blood cells lack mitochondria, so they have no TCA cycle, b-oxidation of fatty acids, electron transport chain, and other pathways that occur in the mitochondria. (2). Glucose is the major fuel for red blood cells. (a). Glucose is converted to pyruvate and lactate. (3). Red blood cells carry bases and nucleosides from the liver to other tissues. (4). The major function of red blood cells is to carry O2 from the lungs to the tissues and to aid in the return of CO2 from the tissues to the lungs. i. Adipose tissue(1). The major fuel of adipose tissue is glucose. (2). Insulin stimulates the transport of glucose into adipose cells. (3). The function of adipose tissue is to store triacylglycerol in the fed state and release it (via lipolysis) during fasting. (a). In the fed state, insulin stimulates the synthesis and secretion of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which degrades the triacylglycerols of chylomicrons and VLDL in the capillaries. Fatty acids from these lipoproteins enter adipose cells and are converted to triacylglycerols and stored. Glucose provides the glycerol moiety. (Glycerol is not used because adipose cells lack glycerol kinase.)(b). During fasting, adipocyte triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase (phosphorylated and activated via a c. AMP-mediated mechanism) initiate lipolysis in adipose cells. j. Muscle(1). Muscle uses all fuels that are available (glycogen stores, and fatty acids, glucose, ketone bodies, lactate, and amino acids from the blood) to obtain energy for contraction. (2). During fasting, muscle protein is degraded to provide amino acids (particularly alanine) for gluconeogenesis. (3). Creatine phosphate transports high-energy phosphate from the mitochondria to actinomyosin fibers and provides ATP for muscle contraction. (4). Creatinine is produced nonenzymatically from creatine phosphate, and a constant amount (dependent on the body muscle mass) is released into the blood each day and excreted by the kidneys. (5). Muscle glycogen phosphorylase differs from liver phosphorylase but catalyzes the same reaction (glycogen+Pi-glucose-1-phosphate). (6). Insulin stimulates the transport of glucose into muscle cells. k. Heart(1). The heart is a specialized muscle that uses all fuels from the blood. (2). The muscle-brain (MB) isozyme of CK is found in heart muscle. Its release can be used to monitor a heart attackl. Kidney(1). The kidney excretes substances from the body via the urine, including urea (produced by the urea cycle in the liver), uric acid (from purine degradation), creatinine (from creatine phosphate), NH4+ (from glutamine via glutaminase), H2. SO4 (produced from the sulfur of cysteine and methionine), and phosphoric acid. (2). Daily creatinine excretion is constant and depends on the body muscle mass. It is used as a measure of kidney function (the creatinine-clearance rate). (3). Glutaminase action increases during acidosis and produces NH3, which enters the urine and reacts with H+ to form NH4+. NH4+ buffers the urine and removes acid (H+) from the body. (4). Uric acid excretion is inhibited by lead (Pb) and metabolic acids (ketone bodies and lactic acid). High blood uric acid can result in gout. Gout can be caused either by increased production or by decreased excretion of uric acid. Deficiency of the base salvage enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome results in increased production of uric acid. (5). Kidney dysfunction can lead to increased BUN, creatinine, and uric acid in the blood and decreased levels of these compounds in the urine. (6). During ketoacidosis, ketone bodies are excreted by the kidney, and during lactic acidosis, lactic acid is excreted. (7). Elevated blood glucose levels (over 180 mg/dL) in DM results in the excretion of glucose in the urine. Mc. Ardle disease is caused by a defective muscle glycogen phosphorylase, such that the muscle cannot generate glucose from glycogen, leading to exercise intolerance. Glycogen accumulates in the muscle because of this enzyme deficiency (Mc. Ardle disease is one of the glycogen storage disease). A defect in the synthesis or processing of collagen will lead to a variety of diseases, of which Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is one (osteogenesis imperfecta is another). Parkinson disease is caused by low levels of dopamine in the nervous system. In the initial stages of Parkinson disease, giving DOPA can reduce the severity of the symptoms because DOPA can be decarboxylated to form dopamine. DOPA can easily enter the brain, whereas dopamine cannot. Tay-Sachs disease results from an inability to degrade GM2, a ganglioside (it is also a sphingolipid). The enzyme missing is b-hexosaminidase. Maple syrup urine disease is caused by the lack of branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase activity, a necessary step in the metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine).

        "exp": "Ans. (a) Asparate. Ref: Satyanarayan Biochemistry, pg. 339. Role of Aspartate in urea cycle:* Aspartate participates in urea cycle for condensation with citrulline to form Argino succinic acid. The reaction is catalyzed by Argino succinic acid synthetase (Asparate provides one out of the two nitrogens of urea, the other nitrogen is contributed by Glutamate).* In the subsequent reaction, Argino succinic acid undergoes a lytic reaction to form Arginine and fumarate. Fumarate forms a link between TCA cycle and urea. Fumarate can be recycled to form oxaloacetate, through intermediate formation of malate that can be transmmated to form aspartate, to get reutilized in the urea cycle. Link between TCA and urea cycle. Role of Aspartate in TCA cycle* Oxaloacetate, the keto acid obtained from Aspartate by transamination is an intermediate of TCA cycle.* Oxaloacetate can either be utilized in TCA cycle or be channeled to the pathway of gluconeogenesis.* Hence asparatate is a common intermediate of TCA cycle (through oxaloacetate) and urea cycle (directly)",
