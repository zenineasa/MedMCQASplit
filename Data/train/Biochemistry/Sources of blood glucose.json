ADDITIONAL READING: Laws of thermodynamics are: 1) Zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This law defines the concept of temperature. 2) First law of thermodynamics states that energy can neither be created, nor be destroyed. It can just be conveed from one form to another. 3) Second law of thermodynamics says that entropy of a system always increases with time. This law defines the concept of entropy. 4) Third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a system attains a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero. This law tells the relation between temperature and entropy.",

        "exp": "Gluconeogenesis occurs in fasting & starvation and occurs mainly in the liver, So the answer is liver. Fasting is lack of food for 12-18 hours Starvation is lack of food for 1-3 days or longer Glycogen of liver can maintain blood glucose for 12-18 hours. After that period, liver gluconeogenesis is the main source of blood glucose during fasting/starvation. The end product of glycogenolysis of glycogen stored in Skeletal muscles is glucose- 6- phosphate and not glucose due to the absence of enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase. Hence muscle glycogen cannot contribute to blood glucose directly. Figure below shows the role of liver in fed and fasting state under hormonal control. Fed state is mainly related to glycogen metabolism while fasted state shows process related to gluconeogenesis from gluconeogenic substrates.",
