Galactose metabolism: Galactose and its derivatives play a central role in the biosynthesis of complex carbohydrates, glycoproteins and glycolipids. In many organisms galactose also can serve as an impoant source of energy. No direct catabolic pathways exist for galactose metabolism. Galactose is therefore preferentially conveed into Glucose-1. Phosphate, which may be shunted into glycolysis or into UDP galactose which can be used in synthetic pathways, including synthesis of lactose, glycoproteins, glycolipids, and glycosaminoglycans.

POLYOL PATHWAY OF GLUCOSE - Sorbitol is very poorly absorbed from intestine. It involves the reduction of glucose by aldose reductase to sorbitol, which can then be oxidized to fructose. This would amount to the interconversion of glucose to fructose. Glucose when conveed to sorbitol, cannot diffuse out of the cell easily and gets trapped there. Sorbitol is normally present in lens of eyes. But in diabetes mellitus, when glucose level is high, the sorbitol concentration also increases in the lens. This leads to osmotic damage of the tissue and development of cataract. Galactitol also causes cataract. REF: DM VASUDEVAN TEXTBOOK OF BIOCHEMISTRY, SIXTH EDITION, PG. NO., 119, 588.",

In addition, the cycle provides precursors of ceain amino acids as well as the reducing agent NADH that is used in numerous other biochemical reactions. Its central impoance to many biochemical pathways suggests that it was one of the earliest established components of cellular metabolism and may have originated abiogenically. The name of this metabolic pathway is derived from citric acid (a type of tricarboxylic acid) that is consumed and then regenerated by this sequence of reactions to complete the cycle. In addition, the cycle consumes acetate (in the form of acetyl-CoA) and water, reduces NAD+ to NADH, and produces carbon dioxide as a waste byproduct. The NADH generated by the TCA cycle is fed into the oxidative phosphorylation (electron transpo) pathway. The net result of these two closely linked pathways is the oxidation of nutrients to produce usable chemical energy in the form of ATP. Ref: DM Vasudevan, 7th edition, page no: 245",

Accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate in the nerves causes intellectual disability. Accumulation of galactitol in the lens causes oil-drop cataract.

Congruently, the end product of glycolysis has been viewed dichotomously: pyruvate in the presence of adequate oxygenation, La(-) in the absence of adequate oxygenation. In contrast, given the near-equilibrium nature of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reaction and that LDH has a much higher activity than the putative regulatory enzymes of the glycolytic and oxidative pathways, we contend that La(-) is always the end product of glycolysis. Cellular La(-) accumulation, as opposed to flux, is dependent on (1) the rate of glycolysis, (2) oxidative enzyme activity, (3) cellular O2 level, and (4) the net rate of La(-) transpo into (influx) or out of (efflux) the cell. For intracellular metabolism, we reintroduce the Cytosol-to-Mitochondria Lactate Shuttle. Our proposition, analogous to the phosphocreatine shuttle, purpos that pyruvate, NAD(+), NADH, and La(-) are held uniformly near equilibrium throughout the cell cytosol due to the high activity of LDH. La(-) is always the end product of glycolysis and represents the primary diffusing species capable of spatially linking glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation.",

This inhibition results in an accumulation of citrate in the blood. Citrate and fluorocitrate are allosteric inhibitors of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), a key enzyme in the breakdown of sugars.

But 2 molecules of ATP are used in the steps 1 and 3, hence the net yield is only 2 ATP (Table 9. 4). The whole reaction is summarized as Glucose + 2 Pi + 2 ADP --> 2 Lactate + 2 ATP iv. But when oxygen is in plenty, the two NADH molecules, generated in the glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction (step 5), can enter the mitochondrial electron transpo chain for complete oxidation. As each NADH provides 2. 5 ATPs, this reaction generates 2. 5 x 2 = 5 ATPs. Thus when oxygen is available, the net gain of energy from the glycolysis pathway is 7 ATPs (Table 9. 5). Hence the ATP yield from glycolysis is different in anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Ref: DM Vasudevan, 7th edition, page no: 112",
