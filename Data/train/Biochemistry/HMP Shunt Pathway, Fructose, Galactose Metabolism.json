Normally, 90% of glucose is oxidized by glycolysis and 10% is oxidized by HMP shunt. o However, in liver and RBCs HMP shunt accounts for oxidation of 30% glucose. o HMP shunt occurs in the cytosol. o It is highly active in liver, adipose tissue, adrenal cortex, lens, cornea, lactating (but not the nonlactating) mammary gland, Gonads0 (testis, ovary) and erythrocytes, o Activity of this pathway is minimal in muscle and brain, where almost all of the glucose is degraded by glycolysis.

In the absence of reduced glutathione, hemoglobin may become oxidized. Oxidized hemoglobin denatures and forms precipitants called Heinz bodies*.
