These individuals have a defective LDL receptor and lack receptor-mediated uptake of cholesterol carried by LDL. Consequently, cholesterol is not cleared from the blood; it accumulates and contributes to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder caused by a defect on chromosome 19. The condition is typically passed down through families in an autosomal dominant manner. The most common genetic defects in FH are LDLR mutations (prevalence 1 in 500, depending on the population), ApoB mutations (prevalence 1 in 1000), PCSK9 mutations (less than 1 in 2500) and LDLRAP1",

Lipid being insoluble (hydrophobic) cannot be transported in blood. So they are associated with 'polar' substances to form hydrophilic lipoprotein complexes 'Classification of lipoprotein on the basis of hydrated density: (As the proportion of lipids to protein decreases, the density of the lipoprotein complex increases). Chylomicrons lowest density*, highest content of lipids(TGs)*IDL (Intermediate density lipoproteins)LDL (low density lipoproteins)HDL (High density lipoproteins). After fat digestion, absorbed fatty acids are reesterified to form TGs and these TGs are converted to lipoprotein complex chylomicrons. These chylomicrons pass to blood circulation through the lymphatic ducts. In the capillaries, lipoprotein lipase (present on the surface of the endothelium) acts on the chylomicrons and removes most of the TGs from the chylomicrons Chylomicrons are thus converted into chylomicron remnants (CRs). There CRs are taken up by the liver. VLDLs are found in the liver and transport TGs formed in the liver to the extrahepatic tissues. In the blood capillaries, LPL acts on the YLDL and removes TGs from it. Thus VLDL is converted to IDL. Most of the IDL particles change into LDL (by losing their apoE and some of TGs). Some of IDL is taken up by liver and also the peripheral tissues. Most of LDL particles deliver the cholesterol to the extrahepatic tissues. Only some of the remaining LDL particles are taken up by the liver cells. HDL, is synthesized in the liver cells and removes cholesterol from the extrahepatic tissue and transfers it to the liver.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e.. Kidney o Dietary cholesterol is transported from intestine to liver by chylomicron-chylomicron remnant system, o From liver cholesterol is in corporated into VLDL and is distributed to extrahepatic tissues (like adipose tissue) through LDL (i. e. after conversion of VLDL into LDL). o HDL transports cholesterol from extra-hepatic tissues (blood vessels, adipose tissue) to liver. o VLDL carries endogenous triglycerides (triglycerides from liver to extrahepatic tissues). o Chylomicrons carry exogenous (dietiy) triglycerides to extrahepatic tissues and remaining triglyceride to liver through chylomicron remnants. Transport of lipidso There are two pathways of lipid transport in the body -1. Transport of dietry lipid (Exogenous pathway)o It is the transport of lipid from intestine to liver. o Chylomicrons transport the dietry lipid from intestine to liverr. o In diet the major lipids are triglyceride and cholesterol. o Cholesterol is absorbed as such in proximal small intestine and is esterified to cholestery! ester (ChE). Triglycerides are hydrolysed by lipases to glycerol and fatty acids which are absorbed in intestine. o Inside intestinal cells triglyceride is synthesized by fatty acids. Chylomicrons are synthesized in the small intestine that contain triglyceride, cholesteryl ester, cholesterol, phosphlipids, and apoprotein B-48 (apo B-48) and apo-A. o These chylomicrons are secreted in the intestinal lymph and reach the systemic circulation via thoracic duct. o In the circulation apo E and apo C are transfered to chylomicrons by HDL, so now chylomicrons contain apo A, apo B-48, apo- E, & apo-C. o In the circulation, triglycerides of chylomicrons are hydrolysed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) present on endothelial cells of vessels of skeletal muscles, adipose tissue and heart, but not in liver. o The released fatty acids are utilized locally by these tissues. o Adipose tissue uses these fatty acids to restore them as TGs and heart and skeletal muscle use them as source of energy. o Thus, function of chylomicrons is to transport exogenous (dietry)triglyceriderto adipose tissue (for storage), heart (for energy) and muscle (for energy). o The chylomicron particle progressively shrinks in size by action of LPL and, cholesterol, phospholipids, apo-A and apo C are transferred to HDL, creating chylomicron remnants that contains more cholesterol, less triglycerides, apo-E & apo B-48. o Chylomicron remnants are removed by liver bv the LDL receptors that require apo-E as ligand. 2. Transport of Hepatic lipids (Endogenous pathway)o VLDL is synthesized in liver that contains high triglyceride, ChE, cholesterol, phospholipid and Apo B-100. (VLDL particles resemble chylomicrones in composition except that VLDL contains Apo B-100 instead of Apo B-48). o VLDL particles are secreted in the plasma and as with chylomicron, Apo E and Apo C are transferred from HDL to VLDL. Now VLDL contains Apo B-100, Apo E and Apo C. o In plasma, triglycerides of VLDL are hydrolysed by same lipoprotein lipase (see above) and apo C is transferred to HDL and the remmants are called IDL. o 40-60% of IDL is removed by liver via LDL receptor mediated endocytosis, this process require Apo E which acts as ligand for LDL receptors. o Remaining IDL is remodeled by hepatic lipase which hydrolyzes more triglyceride to form LDL that contains maximum cholesterol. o 70% of LDL is removed by liver via LDL receptor and 30% is utilized by peripheral tissues as a source of cholesterol. o Lecithine-Cholesterol acetyltransferase (LCAT) esterifes cholesterol in HDL during reverse cholesterol transport, o All nucleated cells in different tissues synthesize cholesterol, but the excretion of cholesterol is mainly by liver in the bile or by enterocytes in gut lumen. So, cholesterol must be transported from peripheral tissue to liver for excretion2. This is facilitated by HDLQ and is called reverse cholesterol transport because it transports the cholesterol in reverse direction to that is transported from liver to peripheral tissues through VLDL --> LDL cycle. Processo HDL is synthesized in liver and smalt intestine. Nascent HDL contain phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol and Apo-Ar, C, E.

Within the HDL particle, the cholesterol is esterified by lecithin - cholesterol acetyltransferase (LCAT) to form cholesteryl ester and additional lipid are transported to HDL from VLDL and chylomicrons. Apo-A, activates LCATr. o There are twro pathway by which this cholesterol is transported to liver. Indirect pathwayo Cholesteryl ester is tranfered from HDL to VLDL and chylomicrons in exchange with triglyceride by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). o This cholesteryl ester is then transported to liver (see previous explanation). Direct pathwayo HDL cholesterol can also be taken up directly by hepatocytes via the scavenger receptors class BI (SR - BI).",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., HDL o HDL particles transport cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues to liver (i. e. reverse cholesterol transport) which is then excreted through bile. o The HDL particles are referred to as scavengers because their primary role is to remove free (unesterified) cholesterol from the extrahepatic tissues. o HDL particles transport cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues to liver (i. e. reverse cholesterol transport) which is then excreted through bile. Reverse cholesterol transporto All nucleated cells in different tissues synthesize cholesterol, but the excretion of cholesterol is mainly by liver in the bile or by enterocytes in gut lumen. So, cholesterol must be transported from peripheral tissue to liver for excretion. This is facilitated by HDL and is called reverse cholesterol transport because it transports the cholesterol in reverse direction to that is transported from liver to peripheral tissues through VLDL - LDL cycle. Processo HDL is synthesized in liver and small intestine. Nascent HDL contain phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol and Apo-A, C, E. This nascent HDL is secreted into circulation where it acquires additional unesterified cholesterol from peripheral tissues. Within the HDL particle, the cholesterol is esterified by lecithin - cholesterol acetyltransferase (LCAT) to form cholesteryl ester and additional lipid are transported to HDL from VLDL and chylomicrons. Apo-A, activates LCAT. o There are two pathway by which this cholesterol is transported to liver1. Indirect pathway. Cholesteryl ester is tranfered from HDL to VLDL and chylomicrons in exchange with triglyceride by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). This cholesteryl ester is then transported to liver (see previous explanation). 2. Direct pathway. HDL cholesterol can also be taken up directly by hepatocytes via the scavenger receptors class BI (SR-BI). o This question is a direct repeat from Ni. BE based AJ 2013-14.",

        "exp": "Ans. A. HDL increases oxidation of LDL The reverse cholesterol transport system:-a. HDL serves as a chemical shuttle that transports excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver. This pathway is called the reverse cholesterol transport system. In this system, plasma HDL takes up cholesterol from the peripheral tissues, such as fibroblasts and macrophages. b. This may occur by passive diffusion or may be mediated by the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) - binding cassette transporter 1. The latter interacts directly with free Apo A-1, generating nascent, or so-called discoidal, HDL. Cholesterol undergoes esterification by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) to produce cholesteryl ester, which results in the production of the mature spherical HDL. c. Cholesterol is also taken up from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in a process mediated by a phospholipid transfer protein (ie, CETP). d. Cholesterol is then returned to the liver by multiple routes. In the first route, cholesterol esters may be transferred from HDL to the Apo B-containing lipoproteins, such as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) or intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), by CETP. These lipoproteins undergo metabolism and subsequent uptake by the liver, primarily by a process mediated by the B, E receptor. e.

I9)\"Plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels should be measured in all adults, preferably after a 12-h overnight fast. In most clinical laboratories, the total cholesterol and TGs in the plasma are measured enzymatically, and then the cholesterol in the supernatant is measured after precipitation of apoB-containing lipoproteins to determine the HDL-C. The LDL-C is then estimated using the following equation: LDL-C = total cholesterol -- (TG/5)-HDL-C (The VLDL cholesterol content is estimated by dividing the plasma TG by 5, reflecting the ratio of TG to cholesterol in VLDL particles.) This formula (the Friedewald formula) is reasonably accurate if test results are obtained on fasting plasma and if the TG level does not exceed ~200 mg/dL; by convention it cannot be used if the TG level is >400 mg/dL. \"--Harrison 19/e p2446. Friedewald Equation. The ultra centrifugal measurement of LDL is time consuming & expensive and require specialist equipment. For this reason, LDL-cholesterol is most commonly estimated from quantitative measurements of total and HDL-chntesterol and plasma triglycerides using the empirical relationship of Friedewald et al. Total cholesterol = LDL + HDL + Triglycerides/5. Total cholesterol = LDL + HDL + Triglycerides/5300 = LDL+ 25+ 150/5. LDL = 300 - (25 + 30) = 245 mg/dl. Limitations of Friedewald Equation.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Removes cholesterol from extrahepatic tissueso The HDL particles are referred to as scavengers because their primary role is to remove free (unesterified) cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues, which is then excreted through bile. This is crucial mechanism that prevents the inappropriate accumulation of cholesterol in peripheral tissues. Because accumulation of cholesterol in tissues is strongly associated with the development of atherosclerosis, the level of HDL in serum is inversely related to the incidence of MI (myocardialinfarction). Thus, HDL is cardioprotective and anti-atherogenic in nature, and is referred to as \"good cholesterol\". o Therefore, HDL-Cholesterol appears to be the best independent predictor of coronary artery disease (inverse relationship) than any other known risk factor. That means low HDL is a much stronger predictor of coronary artery disease than increased LDL cholesterol or increased total cholesterol.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Chylomicrons o Dietry (exogenous) triglycerides are transported from intestine to various tissues by chylomicrons. In these tissues, LPL (in blood vessels) hydrolyses TGs into fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids are taken up by tissues for their use. The chylomicron is converted to chylomicron remnants, which carry the remaining dietary lipids (cholesterol, remaining TGs) to liver. o So, the starting point of chylomicrons is intestine from where they take dietary lipids. Final destination is liver. Between, starting point (intestine) and final destination (liver) chylomicrons supply TGs to various tissues (which contain lipoprotein lipase in their blood vessels).",
