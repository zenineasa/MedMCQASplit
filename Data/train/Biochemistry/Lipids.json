Vasudevan 6th edition page 283, Essential Biochemistry for Medicine by Dr Mitchell Fry 2010 edition page 78, Ganomg's 22nd ed p- 305\"Insulin inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue due to inhibition of hormone sensitive lipase\"Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) also previously known as cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH) is an enzyme that, in humans, is encoded by the LIFE gene. HSL is an intracellular neutral lipase that is capable of hydrolyzing a variety of esters. The enzyme has a long and a short form. The long form is expressed in steroidogenic tissues such as testis, where it converts cholesteryl esters to free cholesterol for steroid hormone production. The short form is expressed in adipose tissue, among others, where it hydrolyzes stored triglycerides to free fatty acids. HSL is activated when the body needs to mobilize energy stores, and so responds positively to catecholamines, ACTH, and negatively to insulin. Previously, glucagon was thought to activate HSL, however the removal of insulins inhibitory effects ('cutting the brakes\") is the source of activation. There are various types of lipases in the human body: Hormone. Function and location. Bile salt dependent lipase. Pancreas and breast. Aids in digestion of fat. Pancreatic lipase. Pancreatic juice. Lysosomal lipase. Intracellularly, in the lysosomes. Hepatic lipase. Endothelium of liver and adrenals, convert intermediate-density1, lipoprotein (IDL) to low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Lipoproteinlipase. Expressed on endothelial cells in the heart, muscle, and adipose tissue. Dual functions of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand, ''bridging factor for receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake. Hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins, such as those found in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), into two free fatty acids and one monoacylglycerol molecule. It is also involved in promoting the cellular uptake of chylomicron remnants, cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, and free fatty acids. Through catalysis, VLDL is converted to IDL and then to LDL. LPL requires Apo-CII as a cofactor. Hormone sensitive lipase. Endothelium of adipose tissue and gonads. HSL functions to hydrolyze the first fatty acid from a triacyiglycerol molecule, freeing a fatty acid and diglyceride. Enzyme is affected by hormones; hence its hormone-sensitive lipase name. It is activated by c. AMP by protein kinase. Growth hormone, glucagon, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones increase the activity, while insulin and prostaglandins decrease its activity. Gastric lipase. Gastric lipase is an acidic lipase secreted by the gastric chief cells in the fun- dic mucosa in the stomach. Gastric lipase together with lingual lipase, comprise the two acidic lipases. These lipases, unlike alkaline lipases (such as pancreatic lipase), do not require bile acid or colipase for optimal enzymatic activity.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Fatty acid oxidation * As fatty acid is nonpolar, it passively diffuses into a cell across cell membrane. As soon as it has reached cytoplasm, fatty acid has a propensity to passively diffuses back into circulation again for the same reason - it is non polar. Fatty acid has gotten into a cell for a purpose. We can't afford to miss fatty acid. So, Fatty acid has to be trapped in a polar form. That is done by acyl CoA synthetase (three types of this enzyme are available - for short chain, medium chain and long chain), which uses two high energy phosphates (ATP - AMP + PPi) and it converts fatty acid into polar acyl CoA.* Further fate of fatty acid which is in the acyl CoA depends upon the energy status of the cell. If the energy status of the cell is already high, the fatty acid need not be oxidised but has to be stored as triacylglycerol. If the energy status of the cell is low, fatty acid has to be oxidised - for which fatty acid has to get into mitochondria. As polar acyl CoA long chain fatty acids can not cross mitochondria. They need a carrier, Carnitine (SHORT CHAIN AND MEDIUM CHAIN FATTY ACIDS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON CARNITINE TO CROSS MITOCHONDRIA)* So carnitine is a carrier of long chain fatty acids and is involved in fatty acid oxidation.* The enzyme involved in the conversion of long chain fatty acyl co A to Acyl carnitine is Carnitine Acyl T ransferase-I (CAT-I)1. This enzyme is placed in the outer mitochondrial membrane.* After Acyl carnitine crosses the inner mitochondrial membrane, Carnitine acyl transferase II converts acyl carnitine to acyl coA and this acyl coA is oxidised.* Other facts about carnitine:# Carnitine is Beta hydroxyl gamma trimethyl ammonium butyrate.# It is synthesised from lysine and methionine in liver and kidney.# Vitamin C is required for the synthesis of carnitine. 'CAT I is the enzyme which commits fatty acid to oxidation. Because, until CATI acts, the fatty acids can either get into fatty acid oxidation or they can be stored as triacylglycerol. Hence CATI is considered as the rate limiting emzyme of fatty acid oxidation",

In red cells, its role is even more critical because it is the only source of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which, directly and via reduced glutathione (GSH), defends these cells against oxidative stress. G6. PD deficiency is a prime example of a hemolytic anemia due to interaction between an intra-corpuscular and an extra-corpuscular cause, because in the majority of cases hemolysis is triggered by an exogenous agent.

        "exp": "This enzyme contains a phosphopantetheine residue, derived from the vitamin pantothenic acid, and a cysteine residue; both contain sulfhydryl groups that can form thioesters with acyl groups. The growing fatty acyl chain moves from one to the other of these sulfhydryl residues as it is elongated. a. Addition of C-2 units(1). Initially, acetyl-CoA reacts with the phosphopantetheinyl residue and then the acetyl group is transferred to the cysteinyl residue. This acetyl group provides the o-carbon of the fatty acid produced by the fatty acid synthase complex. (2). A malonyl group from malonyl-CoA forms a thioester with the phosphopantetheinyl sulfhydryl group. (a). Malonyl-CoA is formed from acetyl-CoA by a carboxylation reaction that requires biotin and ATP. (b). The enzyme is acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a regulatory enzyme that is inhibited by phosphorylation, activated by dephosphorylation and citrate, and induced by insulin. The enzyme that phosphorylates acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the AMP-activated protein kinase (not protein kinase A ). (3). The acetyl group on the fatty acid synthase complex condenses with the malonyl group; the CO2 that was added to the malonyl group by acetyl-CoA carboxylase is released; and a b-ketoacyl group, containing four carbons, is produced. b. Reduction of the b-ketoacyl group(1). The b-keto group is reduced by NADPH to a b- hydroxy group. (2). Then, dehydration occurs, producing an enoyl group with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. (3). Finally, the double bond is reduced by NADPH, and a C-4 acyl group is generated. (a). The NADPH for these reactions is produced by the pentose phosphate pathway and by the malic enzyme. c. Elongation of the growing fatty acyl chain(1). The acyl group is transferred to the cysteinyl sulfhydryl group, and malonyl-CoA reacts with the phosphopantetheinyl group. Condensation of the acyl and malonyl groups occurs with the release of CO2, followed by the three reactions that reduce the b-keto group. The chain is now longer by two carbons. (2). This sequence of reactions repeats until the growing chain is 16 carbons in length. (3). Palmitate, a C-16 saturated fatty acid, is the final product released by hydrolysis from the fatty acid synthase complex. Fatty acid synthesis is maximal in the fed state when insulin is elevated and the glucagon-to-insulin ratio is low. Glucose is converted to citrate, which moves from the mitochondrion to the cytosol, where it is cleaved to oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA. The regulatory enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase requires biotin and converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which provides the 2-carbon units for the elongation of the fatty acyl chain by the fatty acid synthase complex. Thus, biotin (for the carboxylation reaction) and coenzyme A (to produce acetyl-CoA) are the required cofactors for fatty acid synthesis. NADPH provides reducing equivalents.

Additional signs and symptoms of Tangier disease include a slightly elevated amount of fat in the blood (mild hypertriglyceridemia); disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy); and enlarged, orange-colored tonsils. Affected individuals often develop atherosclerosis, which is an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries. d. Other features of this condition may include an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), clouding of the clear covering of the eye (corneal clouding), and type 2 diabetes.",

        "exp": "(Carnitine derivatives) (184-l. Iarper 28th)* Long chain fatty; acids penetrate the inner mitochondrial membrane as carnitine derivatives (184-Harper 28th)* The inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to fatty acids. A specialized carnitine carrier system (Carnitine shuttle) operates to transport activated fatty acids from cytosol to the mitochondria (288. U. Satyanarayan 3rd)* Inhibitor of carnitine shuttle is Malonyl Co. ATransport of long chain fatty acids (LCFA) in to mitochondria. After a LCFA enters a cell, it is converted in the cytosol to its CoA derivative by long chain fatty acyl CoA synthetase (thiokinase) an enzyme of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Because b-oxidation occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, the fatty acid must be transported across inner mitochondrial membrane which is impermeable to CoA. Therefore a specialized carrier transports the long chain acyl group from the cytsol into mitochondrial matrix. This carrier is carnitine and this rate limiting transport process is called the carnitine shuttle* Zellweger syndrome - is caused by the absence of peroxisomes in tissues as a result, the long chain fatty acids can not be oxidased. Entry of short and median chain fatty acids into the mitochondria (192-Lippincotf s 4th)* Fatty acids shorter than 12 carbons can cross the inner mitochondrial membrane without the aid of carnitine or the CPT system {carnitine palmitoyl transferase) once inside the mitochondria, they are activated to their CoA derivatives by matrix enzymes and are oxidized [Note- median chain fatty acids are plendiful in human milk. Because their oxidation is not dependent on CPT-1, it is not subject to inhibition by malonyl CoA)* Medium chain fatty acyl CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is one of the most common inborn errors of metabolism it causes decrease in fatty acid oxidation, resulting in hypoketonemia and severe hypoglycemia. Important Points* Hormone sensitive lipase activity is inhibited by the hormone Insulin* Two final products in P-oxidation of odd chain fatty acids are- Acetyl coA andpropionyl coA* Maximum absorption of short chain fatty acids produced by bacteria occurs in the colon*** Absorption of long chain FA is greatest in the upper parts of the small intestine* Normal fecal fat excretion is less than 6gm/day more than 6 gm 24 hours indicates malabsorptions* Steatorrhea is defined as stool fat exceeding 7 gm/day* Sudan III is the best for screening but gold standard is quantitative estimation offecal fat* Esterified FA in the form of triacylglycerols serve as the major reserve of the body* Trans Fatty Acids - Classified as unsaturated fatty acids but behave more like saturated fatty acids in the body that is they elevate serum LDL and they increase the risk of CHD** & DM* TFA are formed during the hydrogenation of liquid vegetable oils** Fried foods*** Docosahexaenoid acid (DHA) is particularly needed for development of brain and retina and is supplied via the placenta and milk***",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl cholineo Important glycerophospholipids are:-1) Phosphatidylcholine (lecithin):- These glycerophospholipids contain choline. These are most abundant phospholipids in cell membrane. Dipalmitoyl lecithin (dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine) is an important phosphatidylcholine found in lungs, secreted by type II pneumocytes. It acts as a lung surfactant and is necessary for normal lung compliance. It reduces surface tension in alveoli and prevents alveolar collapse. Acute pulmonary respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants is due to inefficient production of surfactant dipalmitoyl lecithin (dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine). 2) Phosphatidylethanolamine (cephaline) They have ethanolamine instead of choline. Thromboplastin (coagulation factor III) is composed of cephaline. Like lecithin, Phosphatidylethanolamine is also a component of cell membrane. 3) Phosphafidylserine:- They have serine nitrogenous base. Phosphatidylserine is also a componant of cell membrane. It plays a role in apoptosis. 4) Phosphatidylinositol:- They have inositol as the stereoisomers, myoinositol. Pkosphatidyiinositol 4, 5- bisphosphate is an important constituent of cell membrane phospholipids, upon stimulation by a suitable hormone agonist, it is cleaved into diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate both of which act as second messengers. 5) Plasmalogens:- Plasmalogens are similar to other glycerophospholipids but fatty acid at Cl of glycerol is linked through an ether, rather than ester bond as occurs in other glycerophospholipids. So, plasmalogen is called ether glyceroiipid. Plasmalogens are found in brain (myelin) and cardiac muscles. Plasmalogen is a platelet activating factor (PAF) and involved in platelet aggregation and degranulation. 6) Lysophospholipids:- Lysophospholipids are formed when one of the two fatty acid is removed from glycerophospholipids (i. e. Lysophospholipids=glycerophospholipid-1 fatty acid or lysophospholipids=glyceral + phosphoric acid + 1 fatty acid + nitrogenous base). Most common of these are lysophosphatidylcholine (lysolecithine) and lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lysocephalin). 7) Cardiolipin (Diphosphatidy lglyeerol). Cardiolipin' is composed of two molecules of phosphatidic acid connec ted by a molecule of glycerol, i. e. cardiolipin = phosphatidic acid + glycerol + phosphatidic acid.

Rancidity refers to appearance of an unpleasant smell and taste for fats and oils. There are three mechanisms causing rancidity:# Hydrolytic rancidity# Oxidative rancidity# Polymerization of cyclic hydrocarbons. Type. Comments. Hydrolytic rancidity Oxidative rancidity# Occurs due to partial hydrolysis of triacyl glycerol molecules due to traces of hydrolytic enzymes in naturally occurring fats and oils.# Occurs due to partial oxidation of Unsaturated Fatty Acids with resistant forms of epoxides and peroxidation of small molecular weight fatty acids by the peroxides and free radicals.# The same process if occurs in vivo will affect integrity of biomembrane, leading to cell death.# Many naturaly occurring fat cell oils may contain antioxidant (like Vitamin E) which prevents occurance of oxidative rancidity.# PUFA more easily oxidized, so vegetable oils with high PUFA are preserved by adding antioxidants. Polymerization of cyclic hydrocarbons# Fats and oils are preferred cooking media.# Overheating and repeated heating would lead to formation and polymerization of cyclic hydrocarbons, which imparts unpleasant taste and colour to the oil.# Coconut oil typically withstands this. Educational Points:# Naturally occurring antioxidants:- Vitamin E (tocopherol), which is lipid-soluble - prevents rancidity- Urate and vitamin C, which are water-soluble.- Beta-carotene is an antioxidant at low P02.# Antioxidants used as food additives:- Propyl gallate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)ANTIOXIDANTS FALL INTO TWO CLASSES# Preventive antioxidants, which reduce the rate of chain initiation- Catalase- Peroxidases such as glutathione peroxidase that react with ROOM;- Selenium, which is an essential component of glutathione peroxidase and regulates its activity and- Chelators of metal ions such as.

Lysosomes are sacs concerned with metabolising unwanted lipids, glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharides.* They are classified as# Lipid storage disorders* E. g., sphingolipidosis like Gml gangliosidosis caused by b galactosidase defect, GM2 gangliosidoses caused by hexosaminidase A defect, Fabry's disease caused by a galactosidase defect, Gaucher's disease caused by b glucosidase defect, Farber's disease caused by ceramidase defect (It is a granulomatous condition and it presents with painful subcutaneous nodules, hepatosplenomegaly and pulmonary involvement)# Mucopolysaccharidoses* E. g., Hurler syndrome caused by a defect of L-iduronidase, Hunter syndrome caused by a defect of L-iduronate sulfatase.# Glycoprotein storage disorders* E. g., Fucosidosis, Mannosidosis# Mucolipidosis* E. g., I cell disease - caused by a defect of Glc. NAC phosphotransferase. Because of this defect, the lysosomal enzymes are not labelled with mannose 6 phosphate. Mannose 6 phosphate is required as a label for targeting lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes. In this condition, lysosomal enzymes do not reach lysosomes. They are secreted out. Lysosomes are empty bags. Hence all undigested glycoproteins and lipids accumulate within all cells as Inclusions, that is why the name I cell disease or Inclusion cell disease. This condition resembles hurler syndrome# Apart from this classification, there is also lysosomal transporter defects like cystinosis caused by a defect of efflux of cysteine from lysosomes. It is characterised by fanconi's syndrome, photophobia and characteristic cysteine crystals can be observed in cornea on slit lamp examination# All these disorders are autosomal recessive disorders except Hunter syndrome and Fabry's disease, both of which are X linked recessive disorders.# All lysosomal storage disorders present as hepatosplenomegaly, mental retardation, seizures with or without deafness and blindness.# Me Ardle's disease is not a lysosomal storage disorder. It is Glycogen Storage Disorder Type V (GSDIV). It is caused by Muscle Glycogen phosphorylase defect. It presents as exercise intolerance, intolerance to anaerobic exercises. Glycogen phosphorylase is not a lysosomal enzyme, it is a cytoplasmic enzyme.# The only Glycogen storage disorder which is also a Lysosomal Storage disorder is Type IIGSD or Pompe's disease, caused by alpha glucosidase defect.",

Primary bile acids are conjugated with taurine or glycine to form bile salts and not secondary bile acids. Bile salts include glycocholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid and taurocheno deoxycholicacid.

Harper's, Illustrated, 27th/ 87-88, 176)DEHYDROGENASES# Dehydrogenases cause the transfer of hydrogen from one substrate to another in a coupled oxidation-reduction reaction.# These dehydrogenases are specific for their substrates but often utilize common coenzymes or hydrogen carriers, eg, NAD+.# This type of reaction, which enables one substrate to be oxidized at the expense of another, is particularly useful in enabling oxidative processes to occur in the absence of oxygen, such as during the anaerobic phase of glycolysis.# NADH dehydrogenase acts as a carrier of electrons between NADH and the components of higher redox potential. Other dehydrogenases such as succinate dehydrogenase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and mitochondrial glyceroI-3- phosphate dehydrogenase transfer reducing equivalents directly from the substrate to the respiratory chain.# Both NADH and NADPH donate reducing equivalents for the reduction of these cytochromes.# Most of the energy liberated during the oxidation of carbohydrate, fatty acids, and amino acids is made available within mitochondria as reducing equivalents (? H or electrons).# The reduced NADH of the respiratory chain is in turn oxidized by a metalloflavoprotein enzyme--NADH dehydrogenase. This enzyme contains FeS and FMN, is tightly bound to the respiratory chain, and passes reducing equivalents on to Q.# The pentose phosphate pathway, an alternative to part of the pathway of glycolysis, is a source of reducing equivalents (NADPH) for biosynthesis and the source of ribose for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis.# The reducing equivalents from the NADH + H+ formed in glycolysis are taken up into mitochondria for oxidation via one of the two shuttles.# NADPH is involved as donor of reducing equivalents in both the reduction of the 3-ketoacyl and of the 2, 3-unsaturated acyl derivatives.

APart of Urea cycle. Part of gluconeogenesis. Now coming to the controversial option 'Apoptosis. The below given lines from Robbins clearly indicate the involvement of mitochondria in the apoptotic process. \"Apoptosis is programmed cell death. Death agonists can generate signals that affect mitochondria in the following two ways. Apoptotic signals result in change in mitochondrial permeability. Formation of pores within the inner mitochondrial membrane results in reduction of membrane potential and mitochondrial swelling. The signals also cause increased permeability of outer mitochondrial membranes releasing an apoptotic trigger cytochrome cy from mitochondria into the cytosol. Cytochrome-c is located between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes and is an integral but soluble component of respiratory pathway. \"Remember.
