It is very heat labile, especially in basic medium. Ascorbic acid itself is an active form. Maximum amount of vitamin C is found in adrenal cortex, o Ascorbic acid functions as a reducing agent and scavanger of free radicals (antioxidant). Its major functions are:- In collagen synthesis: - Vitamin C is required for post-translational modification by hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues converting them into hydroxyproiine and hydroxy lysine. Thus vitamin C is essential for the conversion of procollagen to collagen, which is rich in hydroxyproiine and hydroxylysine. Through collagen synthesis, it plays a role in formation of matrix of bone, cartilage, dentine and connective tissue. Synthesis of norepineph rine from dopamine by dopamine-b-monoxygenase (dopamineb-hydroxylase) requires Vitamin C. Carnitine synthesis. Bile acid synthesis:- 7-a-hydroxylase requires vitamin C. Absorption of iron is stimulated by ascorbic acid by conversion of ferric to ferrous ions. During adrenal steroid synthesis, ascorbic acid is required during hydroxylation reactions. Tyrosine metabolism: - Oxidation of P-hydroxy-phenylpyruvate to homogentisate. Folate metabolism: - Folic acid is converted to its active form tetrahydrofolate by help of Vitamin C.",

Gastric acid and pepsin release the vitamin from protein binding in food and make it available to bind to cobalophilin, a binding protein secreted in the saliva. In the duodenum, cobalophilin is hydrolyzed, releasing the vitamin for binding to intrinsic factor. Pancreatic insufficiency can, therefore, be a factor in the development of vitamin B12 deficiency, resulting in the excretion of cobalophilin-bound vitamin B12. Intrinsic factor binds only the active vitamin B12 vitamers and not other corrinoids. Vitamin B12 is absorbed from the distal third of the ileum receptors that bind the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex, but not the free intrinsic factor or free vitamin. There is considerable enterohepatic circulation of vitamin B12, with excretion in the bile, then reabsorption after binding to intrinsic factor in the ileum.

Trimethylaminuria (TMAU): Fish odour syndrome or stale Fish syndrome. Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is an inherited metabolic disorder that is characterised by an offensive body odour that smells like rotting fish. This odour is due to the excessive excretion of a protein called Trimethylamine (TMA) in the urine, sweat and breath. TMAU, also known as fish odour syndrome or fish malodour syndrome is caused by defects in a protein called Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3 (FMO 3). The FMO3 protein is an enzyme produced by the liver that functions mainly to break down nitrogen-containing compounds. TMA is consumed through the diet and is normally broken down through a process called N-oygenation. the abnormal function of FMO3 results in the body&; s inability to breakdown TMA from food sources, especially choline-rich foods, such as milk, eggs and peanuts. When this process doesnot work properly, TMA builds up and is released in the person&; s sweat, urine and breath. This causes the characteristic smell associated with TMAU. The offensive odour associated with TMAU can be minimized with special diets low in trimethylamine (TMA) or its precursor. Avoiding or minimizing intake of foods that contain choline, nitrogen, and sulphur may reduce the severity of body odour given off. Riboflavin a precursor of the FAD prosthetic group of FMOs, may help maximize residual FMO3 enzyme activity in patients with Trimethylaminuria, allowing fuher breakdown of trimethylamine.

A synthetic form of vitamin K, menadione, is available. Function of vitamin K 1: Formation of g-carboxyglutamate (GLA): Vitamin K is required in the hepatic synthesis of prothrombin and blood clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. These proteins are synthesized as inactive precursor molecules. Formation of the clotting factors requires the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to Gla residues (Figure 28. 26). This forms a mature clotting factor that contains GLA and is capable of subsequent activation. The reaction requires O2, CO2, and the hydroquinone form of vitamin K. The formation of GLA is sensitive to inhibition by dicumarol, an anticoagulant occurring naturally in spoiled sweet clover, and by warfarin, a synthetic analogue of vitamin K.

        "exp": "The principal role of vitamin K is in the posttranslational modification of various blood clotting factors, in which it serves as a coenzyme in the carboxylation of ceain glutamic acid residues present in these proteins. Vitamin K exists in several forms, for example, in plants as phylloquinone (or vitamin K1), and in intestinal bacterial flora as menaquinone (or vitamin K2). A synthetic form of vitamin K, menadione, is available. Function of vitamin K 1. Formation of g-carboxyglutamate (GLA): Vitamin K is required in the hepatic synthesis of prothrombin and blood clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. These proteins are synthesized as inactive precursor molecules. Formation of the clotting factors requires the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to Gla residues (Figure 28. 26). This forms a mature clotting factor that contains Gla and is capable of subsequent activation. The reaction requires O2, CO2, and the hydroquinone form of vitamin K. The formation of GLA is sensitive to inhibition by dicumarol, an anticoagulant occurring naturally in spoiled sweet clover, and by warfarin, a synthetic analog of vitamin K.

In thiamine deficiency, pyruvate cannot be converted to acetyl Co-A a. s thiamine pyrophosphate is a coenzyme for pyruvate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl Co-A. Hence, excess of pyruvate is metabolized to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. This results in lactic acidosis. \"Pyruvate, formed in the cytosol, is transported into the mitochondrion by a proton symporter. Inside the mitochondrion, it is oxidatively decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA by a multienzyme complex that is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. This pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is analogous to the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex of the citric acid cycle. Pyruvate is decarboxylated by the pyruvate dehydrogenase component of the enzyme complex to a hydroxyethyl derivative of the thiazole ring of enzyme-bound thiamin diphosphate, which in turn reacts with oxidized lipoamide, the prosthetic group of dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, to form acetyl lipoamide. Thiamin is vitamin B1 and in deficiency, glucose metabolism is impaired, and there is significant land potentially life-threatening) lactic and pyruvic acidosis. \"--Harper 28/e p321. Thiamin (Vitamin S1). Thiamin diphosphate (TDP)Q also known as Thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP)Q is biologically active & storage form of vitamin B1, formed by transfer of pyrophosphate group from ATP. Physiological Role: Thiamin has a central role in energy yielding metabolism and especially of carbohydrates. Thiamin requirements increase in excess intake of carbohydrates and its deficiency leads to decreased energy production. Thiamin (Vitamin B1). Thiamin diphosphate* Thiamin diphosphate is the coenzyme for: 1. 3 multienzyme complexes that catalyze oxidative decarboxylation reactions: Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenaseQ involved in the metabolism of leucine, isoleucine & valine. Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenaseQ in the citric acid cycle. Pyruvate dehydrogenaseQ in carbohydrate metabolism2. Trans ketolaseQ reaction in the pentose phosphate pathway. Thiamin triphosphate.

Although the nutritional etiology of pellagra is well established, and either tryptophan or niacin prevents or cures the disease, additional factors, including deficiency of riboflavin or vitamin B6, both of which are required for synthesis of nicotinamide from tryptophan, may be impoant. A number of genetic diseases that result in defects of tryptophan metabolism are associated with the development of pellagra, despite an apparently adequate intake of both tryptophan and niacin. Hanup disease is a rare genetic condition in which there is a defect of the membrane transpo mechanism for tryptophan, resulting in large losses as a result of intestinal malabsorption and failure of renal reabsorption. In carcinoid syndrome, there is a metastasis of a primary liver tumor of enterochromaffin cells, which synthesize 5-hydroxytryptamine. Overproduction of 5-hydroxytryptamine may account for as much as 60% of the body's tryptophan metabolism, causing pellagra because of the diversion away from NAD synthesis.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e. it is co-enzyme for pyruvate dehydrogenase and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase Thiamine was the first vitamin to be identified and is therefore called as vitamin Bl. Thiamine has a central role in energy-yielding metabolism and especially the metabolism of carbohydrates. Thiamine pyrophosphate (also k/a thiamine diphosphate) is the biologically active form of the vitamin. Thiamine diphosphate is the coenzyme for: 3 multi-enzyme complexes that catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation reactions. pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA)a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase in the citric acid cycle andbranched chain keto-acid dehydrogenase involved in the metabolism of leucine, isoleucine and valine. Transketolase, in the pentose phosphate pathway. The oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and a-ketoglutarate play a key role in energy metabolism of most cells. In thiamine deficiency, the activity of these two dehydrogenase reactions is decreased, resulting in a decreased production of ATP and thus, impaired cellular function. Thiamine Deficiency. Thiamine deficiency in its early stages causes anorexia, muscle cramps, paraesthesias, and irritability. Prolonged thiamine deficiency causes beriberi, which is classically categorized as wet or dry, though there is considerable overlap. Wet beriberi primarily presents with cardiovascular symptoms characterized by marked peripheral vasodilation resulting in high-output heart failure with dyspnea, tachycardia, cardiomegaly, and pulmonary and peripheral edema, with warm extremities mimicking cellulitis. Dry beriberi presents with a symmetric peripheral neuropathy of the motor and sensory systems with diminished reflexes. The neuropathy affects the legs more than the arms. Alcoholic patients with chronic thiamine deficiency may also have central nervous system manifestations known as Wernicke's encephalopathy, consisting of horizontal nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia, cerebellar ataxia, and mental impairment. When there is additional loss of memory and a confabulatory psychosis, the syndrome is known as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. The laboratory diagnosis of thiamine deficiency is usually made by enzymatic assay of transketolase activity measured before and after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate. A more than 25% stimulation of the transketolase activity by the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate is taken as abnormal.",

Formation of g-carboxyglutamate (GLA): Vitamin K is required in the hepatic synthesis of prothrombin and blood clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. These proteins are synthesized as inactive precursor molecules. Formation of the clotting factors requires the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of glutamic acid residues to Gla residues (Figure 28. 26). This forms a mature clotting factor that contains GLA and is capable of subsequent activation. The reaction requires O2, CO2, and the hydroquinone form of vitamin K. The formation of Gla is sensitive to inhibition by dicumarol, an anticoagulant occurring naturally in spoiled sweet clover, and by warfarin, a synthetic analog of vitamin K. 2. Interaction of prothrombin with platelets: The Gla residues of prothrombin are good chelators of positively charged calcium ions, because of the two adjacent, negatively charged carboxylate groups. The prothrombin-calcium complex is then able to bind to phospholipids essential for blood clotting on the surface of platelets.

Reduction of pyruvate to lactate Lactate, formed by the action of lactate dehydrogenase, is the final product of anaerobic glycolysis in eukaryotic cells (Figure 8. 21). The formation of lactate is the major fate for pyruvate in lens and cornea of the eye, kidney medulla, testes, leukocytes and red blood cells because these are all poorly vascularized and/or lack mitochondria. 1. Lactate formation in muscle: In exercising skeletal muscle, NADH production (by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrog ease and by the three NAD+-linked dehydrogenases of the citric acid cycle, see p. 112) exceeds the oxidative capacity of the respiratory chain. This results in an elevated NADH/NAD+ratio, ouring reduction of pyruvate to lactate. Therefore, during intense exercise, lactate accumulates in muscle, causing a drop in the intracellular pH, potentially resulting in cramps. Much of this lactate eventually diffuses into the bloodstream and can be used by the liver to make glucose (see p. 118). 2. Lactate consumption: The direction of the lactate dehydrogenase reaction depends on the relative intracellular concentrations of pyruvate and lactate, and on the ratio of NADH/NAD+in the cell. For example, in liver and hea, the ratio of NADH/NAD+is lower than in exercising muscle. These tissues oxidize lactate (obtained from the blood) to pyruvate. In the liver, pyruvate is either conveed to glucose by gluconeogenesis or oxidized in the TCA cycle. Hea muscle exclusively oxidizes lactate to CO2and H2O the citric acid cycle.

It is often advised that pre-term infants be given prophylactic doses of vitamin K (1 mg Menadione iii. In children and adults, Vitamin K deficiency may be manifested as bruising tendency, ecchymotic patches, mucous membrane haemorrhage, post-traumatic bleeding Ref: DM Vasudevan - Textbook of Biochemistry, 8th edition, page no: 462",

During catabolism, the chromane ring and side chain may be oxidized and excreted in bile after conjugation with glucuronic acid. Biochemical Role of Vitamin E i. Vitamin E is the most powerful natural antioxidant (Chapter 20). Free radicals are continuously being generated in living systems. Their prompt inactivation is of great impoance. Vitamin E is a known biological antioxidant able to quench the lipid peroxidation chain and to protect the plasma membranes from the attack of free radicals. ii. The free radicals would attack bio-membranes. Vitamin E protects RBC from hemolysis. By preventing the peroxidation, it keeps the structural and functional integrity of all cells. iii. Gradual deterioration of aging process is due to the cumulative effects of free radicals. Vitamin E also boosts immune response. Fig. 33. 13.

J Vitam Res 1970: 40: 166-183. Explanation: Glutathione, in reduced form (GSH), maintains cell membrane integrity against oxidative stress by acting as a substrate for the reduction of peroxides to less damaging alcohols by glutathione peroxidase. Glutathione reductase facilitates this process by catalysing the conversion of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to GSH, thereby maintaining an adequate level of intracellular GSH. Optimal glutathione reductase activity depends on adequate availability of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), a coenzyme derived from riboflavin (vitamin B-2). Thus glutathione reductase activity is suboptimal in individuals with riboflavin deficiency. Riboflavin (vitamin B-2) is a water soluble B vitamin that serves as a precursor of FAD and flav in mononucleotide.

By preventing the peroxidation, it keeps the structural and functional integrity of all cells. It protects the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) from peroxidation reactions. Vitamin E acts as a scavenger and gets itself oxidized (to quinone form) by free radicals (R) and spares PUFA Gradual deterioration of the ageing process is due to the cumulative effects of free radicals.

Niacin is conveed to its coenzyme forms NAD and NADPTreatment of hyperlipidemia: Niacin (at doses of 1. 5 g/day or 100 times the Recommended Dietary Allowance or RDA) strongly inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue--the primary producer of circulating free fatty acids. The liver normally uses these circulating fatty acids as a major precursor for triacylglycerol synthesis. Thus, niacin causes a decrease in liver triacylglycerol synthesis, which is required for very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL, see p. 231) production. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL, the cholesterolrich lipoprotein) is derived from VLDL in the plasma. Thus, both plasma tri acylglycerol (in VLDL) and cholesterol (in VLDL and LDL) are lowered. Therefore, niacin is paicularly useful in the treatment of Type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia, in which both VLDL and LDL are elevated. Ref: Lippincott, 5th edition, page no: 380",

Methylene THFFolic acido The active form of folic acid (pteroyl glutamate) is tetrahydrofolate (THF). o THF serves as a carrier of one-carbon (C1) unitQ during several biosynthetic reactions like nucleic acidQ and amino acid metabolism. o Two other cofactors are also known to be involved in the addition of one carbon (C1) unit to a metabolic precursor, biotin in carboxylation reaction and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as methylating agent. o However, folic acid is more versatile than either of these two because it can transfer the C1 units in several oxidation states. o THF acts as a carrier of one carbon unitQ. o The one carbon units can be: Methyl (CH3) methylene (CH2), methenyl (CH), formyl (CHO), or formimino (CH =NH)o One carbon unit binds to THF through A5 or N10 or both A5, N10position. o For example, if formyl unit is attached to N-5, it is called N5-formyl THF; if methylene unit is attached to both N5 and Nro, it is called N5, N10 methylene THF. o Carbon units attached to N5 are formyl, formimino, or methyl; attached to N10 is formyl; and attached to both N5-N10 are methylene or methenyl. o So, various possible THF are: - N5-Formyl THF, N5-formimino THF, N5-methyl THF, Nl0-formyl THF, N5-Nl0-methylene THF and N5-N10-methenyl THF. o THF receives the C, units from various donor molecules during catabolic reactions and can transfers them tospecific acceptors for the synthesis of various compounds. o The major point of entry for one-carbon unit into substituted folates is methylene THF, which is formed by the reaction of glycine, serine and choline. Serine is the most important source ofsubstitutedfolates for biosynthetic reactions, and activity' of serine hydroxymethyltransferase is regulated by the state offolate substitution and availability of folate",

        "question": "Which vitamin is given in type 2B familial hyperlipidemia?",
        "exp": "Niacin or nicotinic acid is vitamin. Niacin is conveed to its coenzyme forms NAD and NADPTreatment of hyperlipidemia: Niacin (at doses of 1. 5 g/day or 100 times the Recommended Dietary Allowance or RDA) strongly inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue--the primary producer of circulating free fatty acids. The liver normally uses these circulating fatty acids as a major precursor for triacylglycerol synthesis. Thus, niacin causes a decrease in liver triacylglycerol synthesis, which is required for very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL, see p. 231) production. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL, the cholesterolrich lipoprotein) is derived from VLDL in the plasma. Thus, both plasma tri acylglycerol (in VLDL) and cholesterol (in VLDL and LDL) are lowered. Therefore, niacin is paicularly useful in the treatment of Type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia, in which both VLDL and LDL are elevated. Ref: Lippincott, 5th edition, page no: 380",

Vitamin C has a well-documented role as a coenzyme in hydroxylation reactions, for example, hydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues of collagen (see p. 47). Vitamin C is, therefore, required for the maintenance of normal connective tissue, as well as for wound healing. Vitamin C also facilitates the absorption of dietary iron from the intestine. Deficiency of ascorbic acid A deficiency of ascorbic acid results in scurvy, a disease characterized by sore and spongy gums, loose teeth, fragile blood vessels, swollen joints, and anemia (Figure 28. 9). Many of the deficiency symptoms can be explained by a deficiency in the hydroxylation of collagen, resulting in defective connective tissue. Ref: Lippincott, 5th edition, page no: 377",
