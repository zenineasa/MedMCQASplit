The first base (5'-3' direction) of the anticodon is Inosine (I). Thus, it is the wobble base of t. RNA here. Inosine (I) in the wobble base can base pair with C, A or U but not with G.

Ribosomes are usually occur in clusters called polyribosomes attached to one m. RNA molecule, an arrangement that increases the rate of polypeptide synthesis.
