        "exp": "Biochemical functions of Vitamin K The functions of vitamin K are concerned with blood clotting process. lt brings about the post- translational (after protein biosynthesis in the cell) modification of ceain blood clotting factors. The clotting factors ll (prothrombin), Vil, lX and X are synthesized as inactive precursors (zymogens) in the liver. Vitamin K acts as a coenzyme for the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues present in the proteins and this reaction is catalysed by a carboxylase (microsomal). lt involves the conversion of glutamate (Clu) to y-carboxyglutamate (Gla) and requires vitamin K, O2 and COz. The formation of y-carboxyglutamate is inhibited by dicumarol, an anticoagulant found in spoilt sweet clover. Warfarin is a synthetic analogue that can inhibit vitamin K action Vitamin K is also required for the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues of osteocalcin, a calcium binding protein present in the bone. The mechanism of carboxylation is not fully understood. lt is known that a 2, 3-epoxide derivative of vitamin K is formed as. an intermediate during the course of the reaction. Dicumarol inhibits the enzyme (reductase) that conves epoxide to active vitamin K. Ref: Biochemistry by U. Satyanarayana 3rd edition Pgno: 130",

Affinity chromatography exploits the high selectivity of most proteins for their ligands. Enzymes may be purified by affinity chromatography using immobilized substrates, products, coenzymes, or inhibitors. In theory, only proteins that interact with the immobilized ligand adhere. Bound proteins are then eluted either by competition with free, soluble ligand or, lessselectively, by disrupting protein-ligand interactions using urea, guanidine hydrochloride, mildly acidic pH, or high salt concentrations. Commercially available stationary phase matrices contain ligands such as NAD+ or ATP analogs. Purification of recombinantly expressed proteins is frequently facilitated by modifying the cloned gene to add a new fusion domain designed to interact with a specific matrix-bound ligand",

Glucokinase, which specifically phosphorylates glucose, is an inducible enzyme. The substrate glucose, probably through the involvement of insulin, induces glucokinase.

        "exp": "Proton gradient: The inner mitochondrial membrane, as such, is impermeable to protons (H+) and hydroxyl ions (OH-). The transpo of electrons through ETC is coupled with the. translocation of protons (H+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane (coupling membrane) from the matrix to the intermembrane space. The pumping of protons results in an electrochemical. or proton gradient. This is due to the. accumulation of more H+ ions (low pH) on the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane than the inner side. The proton. gradient developed due to the electron flow in the respiratory chain is sufficient to result in the synthesis of ATP from ADP and Pi. Ref: Biochemistry by U.

        "question": "Which DNA segments in the lactose operon of E. coli is a trans-acting regulatory element?",
        "exp": "Regulatory sequences in DNA are classified as cis- or trans-acting elements, depending on the mechanism of action. Cis-acting elements function only when located on the strand of DNA being regulated, relatively close to the regulated gene. The operator (0), the promoter (P), and the CAP binding site all are located just upstream from the regulated structural genes of the operon, and do not function if placed at other locations. The -galactosidase gene is one of the regulated structural genes of this operon. Trans-acting elements can function from long distances, and can even be on a different DNA molecule in the cell. The gene, which encodes the repressor protein, is an example of a trans-acting regulatory element. Because the gene encodes a diffusible product, it doesn't matter where it is placed relative to the regulated genes. Ref: Biochemistry by U. Satyanarayana 3rd edition Pgno: 567",
