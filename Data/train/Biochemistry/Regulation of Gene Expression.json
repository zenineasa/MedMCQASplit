        "question": "Same amino acid is coded by multiple codons d/t following:",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e. Degeneracy There are 20 amino acids, to be coded by 61 codons, so every amino acid except methionine and tryptophan are represented by more than one codon. This is k/a degeneracy or redundancy. The genetic code is made up of codons. Codons consist of a sequence of three nucleotides i. e. it is a triplet code. Since there are 4 different nucleotides, their various combination leads to 64 codons (43). Three of these codons do not code for any specific amino acid (known as nonsense codons) and are used as termination signals (hence also known as termination or stop codons. When one of these termination codons appear in an m. RNA sequence, it signals that polymerization of amino acids into a protein molecule is complete. Characteristics of the Genetic Code. Specific or UnambiguousA given codon designates only one single specific amino acid. Degenerate or Redundant. Although each codon corresponds to a single amino acid, a given amino acid may have more than one triplet coding for it. Exceptions are Methionine & Tryptophan, which have a single codon. Codons that represent same amino acids are called as synonyms. In general, the third nucleotide in a codon is less important than the first two in determining the specific amino acid. This is k/a third base degeneracy or wobbling phenomenon. Universal. In all living organisms the genetic code is the same, this is k/a universality of the code. Exception is found in mitochondrial genome where AUA codes for methionine and UGA for tryptophan instead of isoleucine and termination respectively. Non-overlapping. There is no overlapping i. e. no base functions as a common member of two consecutive codons. Commaless. There is no punctuation between the codons. The codons are arranged as a continuous structure. The last nucleotide of the preceding codon is immediately followed by the first nucleotide of succeeding codon.",

Mutationso A mutation is apermanant change in the DMA. o Mutations that affect germ cells (sperm or ovum) are transmitted to progeny and may give rise to inherited disease. o Mutations that affect somatic cells are not transmitted to progeny but are important in the genesis of cancers and congenital malformations, o Mutations may be classified into three categories -l. Gene mutations. The vast majority of mutations associated with hereditary disease are gene mutations. These may of different types depending whether it involves complete gene or single base -(a) Point mutationo A single nucleotide base is substituted by a different base. o When a pyrimidine base is substituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine - Transition. o When a purine is substituded by a pyrimidine or vice-versa - Transversion, o This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i. e. in codon and leads to replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product. o Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation. o Example is sickle mutation in which CTC codon in b-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid is changed to CAC codon that codes for valine, o Another type of point mutation is nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon. o Example is b-thalassemia in which CAG codon in b-chain of hemoglobin that code for glutamin is changed to stop codon UAG after point mutation. (b) Deletion and insertionso Deletion or insertion of one or two base lead to alterations in the reading frame of the DNA strand - frame shift mutation. o If the number of base pairs invoved is three or a multiple of three framshift does not occur (because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized. (c) Trinucleotide repeat mutationo Normally a codon is triplet ie trinucleotide. o In this type of mutation a codon, ie trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain, o For example in fragile X-syndrome. CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeates of CGG.

Thus it does not require post-transcriptional modification. In Eukaryotes the primary transcript of m. RNA is the hn RNA (hetrogeneous nuclear RNA). After transcription hn. RNA is extensively modified to form functional m. RNA. These modifications are as follows. The 51-capping. This is the first processing reaction. 5l-end of m. RNA is capped with 7-methylguansosine. This cap helps in initiation of translation (protein synthesis) and stabilizes the structure of m. RNA by protecting from 5'-exonuclease. Addition of poly 'A' tail As the name suggests, multiple4A' (adenylate) residues are added at 31 end. This poly-A tail is not transcribed from DNA. but rather added after transcription. These tails helps to stabilize the m. RNA (by protecting from 31-exonuclease), facilitate exit from the nucleus, and aid in translation. After m. RNA enters the cytosol, the poly-A tail is gradually shortened. Some m. RNAs do not have poly-A tail, e. g. m. RNAs of histones and some interferons. Removal of introns (splicing) Eukaryotic genes contain some coding sequences which code for protein and some intervening non-coding sequences which do not code for protein. The coding sequences are called 'exons'and intervening non-coding sequences are called 'introns'. The process by which introns are excised and exons are linked to form functional m. RNA is called splicing. Thus mature m. RNA does not contain introns.# Spitcesome:- Splicesome is an assembly made up of small nuclear RNA (sn. RNA), some proteins and hn. RNA. sn. RNA combines with proteins to form small nuclear ribnonucleoprotein particles (sn. RNPs or snurps) that mediate splicing. It is sn. RNA component of snurps that catalyzes splicing. Snurps are U1, U2, U3, U4, U5 and U6-o Only about 1[?]5% of human DNA has coding sequence (exons). Remaining is non-coding (introns). Alternate splicing:- The hn-RNA molecules from some genes can be spliced in alternative way in different tissues. Thus two or more different m. RNA (and therefore 2 or more proteins) can be synthesized from same hn. RNA. For example, difference isoforms of tropomyosin in different tissues in due to alternate splicing.",
