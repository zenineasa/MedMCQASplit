There are two limbs of the clotting cascade: the extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway relies on the exposure of tissue factor by an injury, which then activates Factor VII, the most abundant of the clotting factors. The intrinsic pathway stas when Factor XII, an inactive serine protease encounters exposed collagen from an injured blood vessel. Factor XII is transformed into an activated serine protease. Activated Factor XII cleaves inactive Factor XI into activated Factor XI. This in turn cleaves the inactive form of Factor IX, and the activated Factor IX transforms inactive Factor VII to its active form. Later events in the actual formation of the clot involve platelets, von Willebrand factor, calcium interacting with endothelial surfaces, and formation of D-dimers Ref: Freedman J. E., Loscalzo J.

        "exp": "Somatostatin, the growth-hormone-inhibiting hormone is secreted as paracrine by D cells in the pancreatic islets and by similar D cells in the gastrointestinal mucosa. It exists in tissues in two forms, somatostatin 14 and somatostatin 28, and both are secreted. Somatostatin inhibits the secretion of gastrin, VIP, GIP, secretin, and motilin. Its secretion is stimulated by acid in the lumen, and it probably acts in a paracrine fashion to mediate the inhibition of gastrin secretion produced by acid. It also inhibits pancreatic exocrine secretion; gastric acid secretion and motility; gallbladder contraction; and the absorption of glucose, amino acids, and triglycerides. Why is this question frequently asked? Somatostatin and it's analogue Octeotride is associated with a lowering of c. AMP levels in serum and in cholangiocytes. The hepatic cysts are derived from cholangiocytes that have undergone self-proliferation and differentiation and secrete fluid in pa due to the intracellular second messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (c. AMP). Renal cysts in polycystic disease grow in response to c. AMP and that a reduction in c. AMP levels attenuates kidney disease progression. Thus, the preclinical studies provides a strong rationale for evaluating the potential role of octreotide in the treatment of human polycystic disease of the liver and kidneys. This is the current area of reaseach for a possible new therapy for polycystic liver and kidney dissease. Currently there is no known medical treatment. Hence, this is an impoant current topic for exams. Ref: Longo D. L., Fauci A. S., Kasper D. L., Hauser S. L., Jameson J. L., Loscalzo J..

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescence-tagged probes to detect specific DNA sequences in tissue samples. It is not used for introducing genes into the cells. Methods for genetic manipulation: Transfection is the most commonly used method for introducing transgenes into human embryonic stem (h. ES) cells. This system is based on the use of carrier molecules that bind to foreign nucleic acids and introduce them into the cells through the plasma membrane. Electroporation is a method that employs the administration of sho electrical impulses that create transient pores in the cell membrane, allowing foreign DNA to enter into the cells. Infection is gene manipulation by viral infection which can produce a very high percentage of modified cells. Advantage over other systems are, high efficiency of DNA transfer (almost 100% efficiency) and single copy integrations. Recombination occurs by physical exchange of DNA. An endogenous gene can be replaced by a transfected gene using homologous recombination. Recombination is the result of crossing-over that occurs at chiasmata and involves two of the four chromatids.

The gene for aldolase B is on chromosome 9q22. 3. Deficiency of this enzyme activity causes a rapid accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate and initiates severe toxic symptoms when exposed to fructose. Clinical manifestations Patients with HFI are asymptomatic, until fructose or sucrose (table sugar) is ingested (usually from fruit, fruit juice or sweetened cereal). Symptoms may occur early in life, soon after birth if food or formulas containing these sugars are introduced into the diet. Early clinical manifestations resemble galactosemia and include jaundice, hepatomegaly, vomiting, lethargy, irritability and convulsions, hypoglycemia. Acute fructose ingestion produces symptomatic hypoglycemia. If the intake of the fructose persists, hypoglycemic episodes recur and liver and kidney failure progress, eventually leading to death. Chronic ingestion results in failure to thrive. Laboratory diagnosis Prolonged clotting time, hypoalbuminemia, elevation of bilirubin and transaminase levels. Proximal tubular dysfunction. Definitive diagnosis is made by assay of fructaldolase B activity in the liver. Gene-based diagnosis for the mutation. Treatment Complete exclusion of all sources of fructose.

In PCR, the DNA to be amplified is replicated by DNA polymerase of Thermus aquaticus (Taq). Taq polymerase is used because it is thermostable, not denatured at a temperature upto 95degC (in PCR DNA is to be heated to 94deg-95deg C for separation of strands). For amplifying a desired DNA sequence in DNA, we have to know sho flanking sequences on either side of the target sequence so that complementary primers can be prepared.

        "exp": "Structural organization of proteins Every protein has a unique three dimensional structure, which is referred to as its native conformation and made up of only 20 different amino acids. Protein structure can be classified into four level of organization. 1) Primary structures. The linear sequence of amino acid residues and location of disulphide bridges, if any, in a polypeptide chain constitute its primary structure. In simple words, primary structure of proteins refers to the specific sequence of amino acids. Primary structure is maintained by covalent 'peptide' bond. 2) Secondary structure. For stability of primary structure, hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen of NH and oxygen of C = 0 groups of the polypeptide chain occurs, which give rise to twisting, folding or bending of the primary structure. Thus, regular folding and twisting of the polypeptide chain brought about by hydrogen bonding is called secondary structure. Impoant types of secondary structure are a-helix, O-pleated sheet and 0-bends. 3) Teiary structure. The peptide chain, with its secondary structure, may be fuher folded and twisted about itself forming three-dimensional arrangement of polypeptide chain, i. e., teiary structure refers to the overall folding pattern of polypeptide which forms three dimensional shape. Teiary structure (three dimensional shape) is maintained by weak non-covalent interactions which include hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic bond (electrostatic bonds or salt bridges) and Van-der wall forces. Covalent linkage (disulphide bond) also plays some (but minor) role. 4) Quaternary structure. Many proteins are made up of more than one polypeptide chains (polymers). Each polypeptide chain is known as protomer (or subunit). The subunit are linked with each other by non-covalent bonds. The structure formed by union of subunits is known as quaternary structure, i. e., spatial relation of subunits (peptide chains) with one another is called quaternary structure. Mainly three non-covalent bonds stabilize quaternary structure: Hydrophobic, hydrogen and ionic (electrostatic). Dimeric proteins contain two polypeptide chains. Homodimers contain two copies of same polypeptide chain, while in a heterodimer the polypeptides differ.",

In gluconeogenesis, other enzymes are needed to bypass these key steps. Pyruvate cannot be directly conveed to phosphoenolpyruvate in gluconeogenesis. Therefore, pyruvate carboxylase (a mitochondrial enzyme;) conves pyruvate to oxaloacetate, which can be conveed to phosphoenolpyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase using two ATP equivalents per molecule of phosphoenolpyruvate. Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphataseis the enzyme that splits fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate into fructose-6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate. It is also required for gluconeogenesis. Glucose-6-phosphatase is a liver enzyme that hydrolyzes glucose-6-phosphate to glucose. A deficiency of this enzyme leads to von Gierke disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type I. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is a mitochondrial enzyme that conves pyruvate to acetyl CoA. This enzyme requires thiamine pyrophosphate, lipoamide, and FAD as cofactors. Glucokinase is a liver enzyme that conves glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Unlike hexokinase, it is specific for glucose and is unresponsive to the level of glucose-6-phosphate. Its function is to store excess glucose, so it has a very high Km (ie, a low affinity) for glucose, becoming active only when the concentration of glucose is very high. Ref: Bender D. A., Mayes P. A.

The condition was named after the yellowish (ocher-like) discoloration of the tissue seen on microscopic examination. However, macroscopically the affected tissues appear bluish grey because of a light scattering phenomenon known as the Tyndall effect. The condition is most often associated with alkaptonuria but can occur from exogenous administration of phenol complexes like hydroquinone. Alkaptonuria (black urine disease or alcaptonuria) is a rare inherited genetic disorder of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism. This is an autosomal recessive condition that is due to a defect in the enzyme homogentisate 1, 2-dioxygenase, which paicipates in the degradation of tyrosine. As a result, a toxic tyrosine byproduct called homogentisic acid (or alkapton) accumulates in the blood and is excreted in urine in large amounts (hence -uria)",

        "question": "A patient presents with retinoblastoma. He has a single tumor in one eye. Which of the following test could be used to determine whether this is a heritable or sporadic tumor?",
        "exp": "Foy percent of retinoblastomas are heritable; the child inherits one mutant allele through the germline and a somatic mutation in the other allele occurs, resulting in the loss of function of that gene. This leads to tumor development, often with multiple tumors in both eyes. Penetrance, however, is not complete, since the second mutation is a chance event. Sixty percent of retinoblastomas are sporadic; both alleles are inactivated by somatic mutation. Because this is a rare event, tumors usually are in only one eye and present at a later age. To detect a mutation in the Rb gene and differentiate between heritable and sporadic cases of retinoblastoma, PCR is the most appropriate technique of the choices given. Using the appropriate primers, a deletion can be detected as a change in size of the DNA band amplified. In heritable cases, one chromosome will show the altered length from the deletion or the translocation in any cell in the body. In sporadic retinoblastoma, samples isolated from anywhere other than the tumor should have two normal alleles. DNA footprinting is a protocol used to detect specific protein binding to DNA molecules by comparing the fragmentation patterns of DNA bound with the protein of interest vs. unbound DNA following digestion with DNase I. If the bound protein protects against DNase I digestion, the position of the protein on the DNA can be deduced by the loss of the characteristic fragment. FACS uses antibodies coupled to fluorescent markers to determine cell surface molecules on whole cells. It is very useful for determining the stage of development or activation of cells, but does not give you any insight into the DNA. Nohern blotting, the RNA counterpa to Southern blotting, will determine the size and abundance of m. RNA of a specific gene in a given sample of RNA. RNA is not able to be cleaved by restriction enzymes the way the DNA can; however, RNA molecules for different proteins are of different lengths. The sample is separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with a specific, labeled probe. This will be exposed to film and the bands will appear, revealing the size and the abundance of specific m. RNAs.",

Glycogen stores are depleted in 16-18 hours. Breakdown of fat (lipolysis) and ketogenesis occurs in the later part of the first stage. But fatty acids and ketone bodies are utilized mainly during the second and third stage. Further, lipolysis provides glycerol, which is used for gluconeogenesis. Protein degradation occurs, but it is to provide alanine for gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is maximum on the third day and it is responsible for maintenance of blood glucose in early as well as in late stages of starvation. Thus, the best answer here is gluconeogenesis. If we put except in the question, then the answer will become 'a' i. e., glycogenolysis, as glycogen stores are depleted in 16-18 hours.",

Exopeptidases catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, one at a time, from the ends of peptides. - Carboxypeptidases, secreted in the pancreatic juice, release amino acids from the free carboxyl terminal. - Aminopeptidases, secreted by the intestinal mucosal cells, release amino acids from the amino terminal. Dipeptidases and tripeptidases in the brush border of intestinal mucosal cells catalyze the hydrolysis of di-and tripeptides, which are not substrates for amino-and carboxypeptidases.

This accounts for the slow onset of the effect of SRS-A. Leukotrienes are formed from arachidonic acid by the lipoxygenase pathway and cause increased vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction. They are the principal mediators in the bronchoconstriction of asthma and are not influenced by antihistamine. Also Know: Eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A) is a tetrapeptide that exists preformed in mast cell granules. When released during anaphylaxis, it attracts eosinophils that are prominent in immediate allergic reactions. The role of eosinophils in type I hypersensitivity reactions is unceain, but they do release histaminase and arylsulfatase, which degrade two impoant mediators, histamine and SRS-A, respectively. Eosinophils may therefore reduce the severity of the type I response. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 65. Hypersensitivity (Allergy). In W.

Phenylketonuria Phenylketonuria Biochemical Defect: An autosomal recessive disorder caused by multiple loss-of-function mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase or decreased tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor for the enzyme. Pathophysiology: Phenylalanine hydroxylase is responsible for conveing phenylalanine into tyrosine. When this enzyme is deficient, phenylalanine builds up. High levels of phenylalanine lead to severe brain damage by competitively inhibiting amino acid transpo required for protein synthesis, impairing polyribosome stabilization, reducing myelin production, and decreasing the formation of norepinephrine and serotonin. Phenylalanine is also a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase, a key enzyme in the pathway of melanin synthesis, and thereby leads to hypopigmentation of the hair and skin. Clinical Manifestations: Mental and growth retardation; microcephaly; decreased pigmentation (blonde and blue-eyed); eczema; \"mousy\" body odor; heavy perspiration; mousy urine odor; hypeonia, hyperreflexia. Lab findings: Phenylketones detected in urine (phenylacetate, phenyllactate, and phenyl-pyruvate); positive Guthrie test (measures phenylalanine in blood) at bih.

The enzyme catalyze the reaction is called aminotransferase (transaminase). Most transaminases use a-ketoglutarate (a-keto acid) as a common acceptor of a-amino group of a-amino acids. All transaminases require pyridoxal phosphate (Vitamin B6) as a coenzymneQ. Some of the most impoant transaminases are: -Alanine transaminase (ALT) also called glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT): - It catalyzes the transfer of amino group of alanine to a-ketoglutarate resulting in formation of pyruvate and L-glutamate Q. ALTL-Alanine Q+ a-ketoglutarate Q _____ Pyruvate Q + L-glutamate Q PLPAspaate transaminase (AST) also called glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT): It catalyzes the transfer of amino group of aspaate to a-ketoglutarate resulting in formation of oxaloacetate and L-glutamate. ASTL-Aspaate + a-ketoglutarate Oxaloacetate + L-glutamate PLPMost amino acids undergo transamination reaction except lysine, threonine, proline and hydroxyproline. All the amino groups from amino acids that undergo transamination are collected into one common amino acid, i. e., glutamate. This is impoant because L-glutamate is the only amino acid that undergoes oxidative deamination at an appreciable rate in mammalian tissue. Thus, formation of ammonia from amino acids occurs mainly the a-amino nitrogen of glutamate. Transamination is not restricted to a-amino groups. The 6-amino group of ornithine (but not the E-amino group of lysine) undergoes transmination.",

If you got that far, you could have figured out which of the choices would inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids. Ceainly glucagon, a catabolic hormone released in response to low blood glucose, would be a likely candidate to inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids. In fact, glucagon inhibits fatty acid synthesis by a c. AMP-dependent phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Conversely, glucagon stimulates fatty acid oxidation. Citrate is a key player in fatty acid synthesis (citrate shuttle). Therefore, the presence of citrate would stimulate, not inhibit, acetyl-CoA carboxylase. A high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet (would stimulate, not inhibit, the synthesis of fatty acids. In contrast to glucagon, insulin is an anabolic hormone that promotes fatty acid synthesis and therefore would stimulate acetyl-CoA carboxylase. It does so by dephosphorylating the enzyme.

These bases are modified by methylation, reduction, acetylation or glycosylation. In t-RNA there are many modified bases, e. g. dihydrouridine, ribothymidine, pseudouridine, and 7-methylguanosine. In DNA, the most common modified base is 5-methylcytosine. Other impoant modified bases are acetylcytosine and dimethyladenine. Transfer RNA (t RNA) The function of t. RNA is to transpo amino acids in an activated form from cytosol to ribosome for protein synthesis. 10-20% bases of t. RNA may be modified and known as modified or unusual basese. A modified base is one that has been modified (altered) after nucleic acid chain has been formed, i. e. modified base is altered purine or pyrimidinee, e. g.? Dihydrouridine (D)deg in which one of the double bonds of the base is reduced. Ribothymidine (T) in which methyl group is added to uracil to form thymine. Thus, t. RNA is the only RNA that can contain thyminee though only some times. Pseudouridine (w) in which uracil is attached to ribose by a carbon-carbon bond rather than a nitrogen bond. t-RNA molecule get folded into a structure that appears like a clover leafe. There are four arms. 1. Acceptor arm: It consists of a base paired stem that terminates in the sequence CCA at the 3' end. This is the attachment site for amino acids. 2. D arm - It contains the base dihydrouridine (D). 3. Anticodon arm - It contains anticodone that base pairs with the codon of coming m. RNA. Anticodon has nucleotide sequence complementary to the codon of m. RNA and is responsible for the specificity of the t RNA. 3) Tyr C arm: It contains both ribothymidine (T) and pseudouridine (v). Proteins are synthesized from 20 amino acids. For each of these amino acids, there is at least one specific t. RNA. For some amino acids, there may be more than one species oft RNA.",

In fact, niacin therapy may actually be helpful in controlling the symptoms. The underlying problem is a defect in the epithelial transpo of neutral amino acids, including tryptophan, which can act as a precursor of niacin. The defective amino acid transpo leads to poor absorption of dietary amino acids as well as excess amino acid secretion in the urine. Alkaptonuria is characterized by urine that turns black upon standing and a debilitating ahritis. Carcinoid syndrome is seen in patients with carcinoid tumor.

The light is produced through a chemical reaction involving Luciferin, which is the substrate, Luciferase, the enzyme, ATP, and oxygen. The basic reaction sequence is: The luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of luciferin into oxyluciferin. In the process light is emitted. Since the light producing reaction is dependent on ATP, it allows researchers to determine the presence of ATP and hence the presence of life. (If ATP is present in a sample of something that is a good indication that life is occurring within that specimen). NASA has used this method to test for life on other planets. If luciferin and luciferase compounds were mixed with samples and they produced a glowing reaction this would mean the presence of ATP and hence life. This reaction is also used for antibiotic susceptibility testing. If the enzyme Luciferase is added to a cultured sample of Tuberculosis and an antibiotic is also added, the strength of the antibiotic can be tested. If the drug fails, then the bacteria will continue to thrive and glow. This research has also been employed in gene activation therapy cases, where ultraviolet cameras seek out genes treated with Luciferase. If light is visible, this means that the Luciferase gene is active. This will help researchers to know when they have made a successfully attempt at gene therapy.",

One turn of the TCA cycle, staing with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the staing molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2. 5 ATPs and therefore, 12. 5 ATPs are produced when staing compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle. Note: Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from staing. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2. 5 ATPs and FADH produces 1. 5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs.

The Stokes radius is a function of molecular mass and shape. When rapidly tumbling, an elongated protein occupies a larger effective volume than a spherical protein of the same mass. Size-exclusion chromatography employs porous beads. The pores are analogous to indentations in a riverbank. As objects move downstream, those that enter an indentation are retarded until they drift back into the main current. Similarly, proteins with Stokes radii too large to enter the pores (excluded proteins), remain in the flowing mobile phase, and emerge before proteins that can enter the pores (included proteins). Proteins thus emerge from a gel filtration column in descending order of their Stokes radii. Ref: Harper's illustrated biochemistry. 30th edition page no: 27",

It prevents the oxidation of other antioxidants,. e. g, carotenes, vitamin A and vitamin C. Vitamin E is the lipid-soluble antixodant in cell membranes and plasma lipoproteins. The main function of vitamin E is as a chain-breaking, free radical-trapping antioxidant in cell membranes and plasma lipoproteins by reacting with lipid peroxide radicals formed by peroxidation of polyunsatured fatty acid. Vitamin E prevents rancidity of fats due to its antioxidant action.",

        "question": "Starvation and Diabetes Mellitus can lead on to ketosis. Which of the following features is in our of ketosis due to diabetes mellitus?",
        "exp": "The hormone glucagon stimulates ketogenesis whereas insulin inhibits. The increased ratio of glucagons/insulin in diabetes mellitus promotes ketone bodies formation. Diabetic ketoacidosis. It arises because of a lack of insulin in the body. The lack of insulin and corresponding elevation of glucagon leads to increased release of glucose by the liver (a process that is normally suppressed by insulin) from glycogen and through gluconeogenesis. High glucose levels spill over into the urine, taking water and solutes (such as sodium and potassium) along with it in a process of osmotic diuresis. Ketones, too, paicipate in osmotic diuresis and lead to fuher electrolyte losses. This leads to polyuria, dehydration, and compensatory thirst and polydipsia. The absence of insulin also leads to the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, which are conveed, again in the liver, into ketone bodies (acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate). Beta-Hydroxybutyrate can serve as an energy source in absence of insulin-mediated glucose delivery, and is a protective mechanism in case of starvation. The ketone bodies, however, have a low pH and therefore turn the blood acidic (metabolic acidosis). The body initially buffers the change with the bicarbonate buffering system, but this system is quickly overwhelmed and other mechanisms compensate for the acidosis. One such mechanism is hyperventilation to lower the blood carbon dioxide levels (a form of compensatory respiratory alkalosis). This hyperventilation, in its extreme form, may be observed as Kussmaul respiration. Blood sugars rise, dehydration ensues, and resistance to the normal effects of insulin increases fuher by way of a vicious circle. As a result of the above mechanisms, the average adult DKA patient has a total body water shoage of about 6 liters (or 100 mL/ kg), in addition to substantial shoages in sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate, magnesium and calcium. Glucose levels usually exceed 13. 8 mmol/L or 250 mg/ d. LBeta-hydroxybutyrate, despite chemically not actually being a ketone, is the principal \"ketone body\" in diabetic ketoacidosis. DKA is cmmon in type 1 diabetes as this form of diabetes is associated with an absolute lack of insulin production by the islets of Langerhans. In type 2 diabetes, insulin production is present but is insufficient to meet the body's requirements as a result of end-organ insulin resistance. Usually, these amounts of insulin are sufficient to suppress ketogenesis. If DKA occurs in type 2 diabetics, their condition is called \"ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes\". The clinical state of DKA is associated, in addition to the above, with the release of various counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon and adrenaline as well as cytokines. Cerebral edema is the most dangerous DKA complication. It is more likely in those with more severe DKA, and in the first episode of DKA. Other factors in the development of cerebral edema are dehydration, acidosis and low carbon dioxide levels",

It is known that modification of histones is functionally impoant in this process. Enzymatic attachment of an acetyl group to ceain amino acids in histones is critical - Acetylation of histones. The acetylation of histones affects the charge interactions with DNA, resulting in unwinding of DNA at that specific location, and thereby facilitates subsequent steps required to generate nascent m. RNA. Conversely, deacetylation of histones can result in rewinding of chromatin and inhibition of gene expression. This modification of histones is carried out by a large family of enzymes termed histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Why is this topic impoant and frequently asked? 1. Cardiovascular biology: E. g. Experimental studies in mice lacking specific HATs or HDACs can profoundly alter processes such as blood vessel development or cardiac hyperophy. Because acetylation and deacetylation are enzymatic processes, they are amenable to pharmacologic manipulation. Indeed, agents such as trichostatin A have been shown to ameliorate cardiac hyperophy in rodents. 2. Chromatin modification: Acetylation is perhaps the most well-studied chromatin modification so far. However others such as lysine/arginine methylation, serine phosphorylation, and ubiquitination are also likely to be impoant areas from both a scientific and therapeutic perspective for the future.

De novo pathway (De novo synthesis) In de novo pathway, the purine nucleotides are synthesized from amphibolic intermediates. Amphibolic intermediates are the intermediary metabolites of amphibolic pathways (eg. citric acid cycle) which have dual purposes, i e. they serve in catabolism as well as in anabolism.

        "exp": "m-RNA processing. Prokaryotic m. RNA is functional immediately upon synthesis, i. e. prokaryotic primary transcript of m. RNA is functional. Thus it does not require post-transcriptional modification. In Eukaryotes the primary transcript of m. RNA is the hn RNA (hetrogeneous nuclear RNA). After transcription hn. RNA is extensively modified to form functional m. RNA. These modifications are as follows. 1) The 5'-capping:- This is the first processing reaction. 51-end of m. RNA is capped with 7-methylguansosine. This cap helps in initiation of translation (protein synthesis) and stabilizes the structure of m. RNA by protecting from 5'-exonuclease. 2) Addition of poly 'A' tail:- As the name suggests, multiple 'A' (adenylate) residues are added at 3'end. This poly-A tail is not transcribed from DNA, but rather added after transcription. These tails helps to stabilize the m. RNA (by protecting from 3'-exonuclease), facilitate exit from the nucleus, and aid in translation. After m. RNA enters the cytosol, the poly-A tail is gradually shoened. Some m. RNAs do not have poly-A tail, e. g. m. RNAs of histones and some interferons. 3) Removal of introns (splicing):- Eukaryotic genes contain some coding sequences which code for protein and some intervening non-coding sequences which do not code for protein. The coding sequences are called `exons' and intervening non-coding sequences are called `introns'. The process by which introns are excised and exons are linked to form functional m. RNA is called splicing. Thus mature m. RNA does not contain introns. Splicesome Splicesome is an assembly made up of small nuclear RNA (sn. RNA), some proteins and hn. RNA. sn. RNA combines with proteins to form small nuclear ribnonucleoprotein paicles (sn. RNPs or snurps) that mediate splicing. It is sn. RNA component of snurps that catalyzes splicing. Snurps are U4, U5 and U6. Only about 1-5% of human DNA has coding sequence (exons). Remaining is non-coding (introns). 4) Alternate splicing:- The hn-RNA molecules from some genes can be spliced in alternative way in different tissues. Thus two or more different m. RNA (and therefore 2 or more proteins) can be synthesized from same hn. RNA. For example, difference isoforms of tropomyosin in different tissues in due to alternate splicing.",

However, actin and myosin are methylated by a posttranslational reaction, forming 3-methylhistidine. During intracellular breakdown of actin and myosin, 3-methylhistidine is released and excreted into the urine.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Glycine Glutathione Glutathione is a tripeptide made up of glutamate, cysteine and glycine (T-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine). Glutathione is present in all mammalian cells except neurons. The sulphydryl (-SH) group of cysteine residue is the reactive poion of glutathione which can undergo oxidation and reduction. Thus, glutathione may exist as the reduced (G-SH) or oxidized form (G-S-S-G) and can play a role in some oxidation-reduction reactions. In oxidized form two molecules of glutathione are linked by disulfide bond. Glutathione has following function: -i) It helps in keeping some enzyme in active state by preventing the oxidation of sulphydryl (-SH) group of enzyme. ii) It helps in detoxification of H2. O2 by reducing it. Superoxide anion (O2) first conveed to H2. O2 by superoxide dismutase. H2. O2 is then reduced to H2. O2 by glutathione perioxidase, a reaction requires reduced glutathione. Thus, glutathione scavenges free radicals and superoxide anion. iii) It helps in detoxification of xenobiotics by their conjugation (conjugation reaction). iv) Reduced form of glutathione (GSH) with a free sulphydryl (-SH) group serves as a redox buffer, regulating redox state of the cell. v) Reduced glutathione is essential for maintaining the normal structure of RBCs and for keeping hemoglobin iron in ferrous state (prevents formation of methemoglobin). vi) It is involved in the transpo of amino acids across the cell membane of kidney and intestine.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Alanine. DISPOSAL/DETOXIFICATION OF AMMONIA1. First line of Defense (Trapping of ammonia). Being highly toxic, ammonia should be eliminated or detoxified, as and when it is formed. Even very minute quantity of ammonia may produce toxicity in central nervous system. But, ammonia is always produced by almost all cells, including neurons. The intracellular ammonia is immediately trapped by glutamic acid to form glutamine, especially in brain cells. The glutamine is then transpoed to liver, where the reaction is reversed by the enzyme glutaminase. The ammonia thus generated is immediately detoxified into urea. Aspaic acid may also undergo similar reaction to form asparagine. 2. Transpoation of Ammonia. Inside the cells of almost all tissues, the transamination of amino acids produce glutamic acid. However, glutamate dehydrogenase is available only in the liver. Therefore, the final deamination and production of ammonia is taking place in the liver. Thus, glutamic acid acts as the link between amino groups of amino acids and ammonia. The concentration of glutamic acid in blood is 10 times more than other amino acids. Glutamine is the transpo forms of ammonia from brain and intestine to liver; while alanine is the transpo form from muscle. 3. Final disposal. The ammonia from all over the body thus reaches liver. It is then detoxified to urea by liver cells, and then excreted through kidneys. Urea is the end product of protein metabolism. Transpo of alanine from muscle to liver (glucose-alanine cycle) has two functions:? i) Providing substrate for gluconeogenesisii) Transpo of ammonia (NH4-) to liver for urea synthesis.",
