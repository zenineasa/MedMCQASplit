Treatment with trypsin causes chromosome swelling as a secondary effect due to a proteolytic action of this enzyme and induces chromosomal bands. Banding techniques are staining procedures which are available to produce a specific pattern of bands along the length of each chromosome. 3 types of banding technique are: Q banding G banding R banding Ref: Your Easy Way to Chromosomes By Sana Nimer Abu Shihab page 158",

Two molecules of ATP are required for the reaction. CPS-I is the rate limiting enzyme of urea cycle. It is an allosteric enzyme and allosterically activated by N-acetyl glutamate. 2) Ornithine transcarbamoylase catalyzes the formation of citrulline from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine. 3) Arginosuccinate synthase catalyzes the formation of arginosuccinate from citrulline and aspaate. This reaction requires 1. ATP, but 2 high energy phosphate bonds are consumed as ATP is conveed to AMP + PPi. The amino group of aspaate provides one of the two nitrogen atoms that appear in urea (The other one is provided by ammonia NH4). 4) Arginosuccinate lyase (arginosuccinase) catalyses the cleavage of arginosuccinate into arginine and fumarate. Fumarate enters in TCA cycle. 5) Arginase catalyses the formation of urea from arginine by hydrolytic cleavage of arginine to yield urea and ornithine.

The most important function of malate shuttle is to transport cytosolic reducing equivalents (generated in glycolysis) into the mitochondria. But, malate shuttle has no direct role in the occurrence of any reaction of glycolysis, i. e. malate shuttle does not take part in the glycolytic process itself. Its role is to generate ATP by transporting NADH into the mitochondria. You can easily understand this by the fact that anaerobic glycolysis occurs without any participation of the malate shuttle. Hence, presence or absence of malate shuttle has no direct effect on the glycolytic process itself. On the other hand, the malate shuttle is directly involved in gluconeogenesis by transporting malate out of the mitochondria into the cytosol. Thus without malate shuttle, gluconeogenesis cannot occur. Thus, malate shuttle is a part of the gluconeogenic process while it is not a part of the glycolytic process. In short Most important function of malate shuttle is to transport the reducing equivalents (generated in glycolysis) into the mitochondria.

During the interview, the patient reveals that has been forcing himself to vomit after almost every meal over the last 6 weeks. He denies associated eye pain and discomfo, headache, or dysphagia. He has never experienced such symptoms in the past. Examination of the patient demonstrates slight disorientation, veical nystagmus worse on downgaze, diffuse weakness of the lower extremities, bilateral dysmetria, and hypothermia. Laboratory analyses reveal mild dehydration and hypokalemia. The patient's status has improved after an administration of a vitamin. The physiologically active form of this vitamin acts as a coenzyme for which of the following enzymes?",
        "exp": "Thiamine (vitamin B1) is conveed intracellularly to its active form, thiamine pyrophosphate, which is an essential cofactor in intermediate carbohydrate metabolism. Thiamine acts as a coenzyme for enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which plays a critical role in the production of energy from food, and the pentose-phosphate pathway, which produces an impoant intermediate, ribose-5-phosphate, required for the synthesis of ATP, GTP, DNA, RNA, and NADPH. The brain is paicularly vulnerable to thiamine deficiency because it relies exclusively on carbohydrates for immediate energy demands. The selective vulnerability of ceain structures accounts for the specific clinical manifestations of Wernicke encephalopathy. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the physiologically active form of thiamine, is required for the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). PDH catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, regulating entry into the citric acid cycle for metabolites leaving glycolysis. The PDH complex is comprised of 3 separate enzymes: pyruvate dehydrogenase (decarboxylase), dihydrolipoamide transacetylase and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. Besides TPP, the complex also requires CoA, NAD, FAD, and lipoic acid as coenzymes. The mechanism of TPP action includes formation of a carbanion that can attack the electron-deficient keto carbon of pyruvate. In addition, TPP functions as a coenzyme for alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and transketolase. Pyridoxal phosphate serves as a coenzyme for glycogen phosphorylase. Vitamin B12 acts as a cofactor of L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which catalyzes conversion of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. Methionine synthase activation leads to synthesis of methionine from homocysteine with folic acid as a coenzyme.",

The major substrates are the glucogenic amino acids, lactate, glycerol, and propionate. Liver and kidney are the major gluconeogenic tissues; the kidney may contribute up to 40% of total glucose synthesis in the fasting state and more in starvation. Glucagon is a hormone produced and secreted by the alpha-cells of the pancreas in response to decreases in blood glucose. Glucagon and epinephrine, hormones that are responsive to a decrease in blood glucose, inhibit glycolysis and stimulate gluconeogenesis in the liver by increasing the concentration of c. AMP.

When the staing molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2. 5 ATPs and therefore, 12-5 ATPs are produced when staing compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle. Note: Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from staing. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2. 5 ATPs and FADH produces 1. 5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs.

In type I glycogen storage disease (von Gierke's), glucose 6-phosphate can Not be conveed to glucose due to the deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase. This leads to increased utilization of glucose-6-phosphate by hexose monophospahet shunt (HMP shunt), resulting in increased levels of ribose-5-phosphate and PRPP, and ultimately purine overproduction. Von-Gierkes disease is also associated with increased activity of glycolysis. Due to this, lactic acid accumulates in the body which interferes with the uric acid excretion through renal tubules. The lack of feedback control by PRPP glutamylamidotransferase by purine nucleotides also leads to their elevated synthesis.

        "exp": "Somatostatin, the growth-hormone-inhibiting hormone is secreted as paracrine by D cells in the pancreatic islets and by similar D cells in the gastrointestinal mucosa. It exists in tissues in two forms, somatostatin 14 and somatostatin 28, and both are secreted. Somatostatin inhibits the secretion of gastrin, VIP, GIP, secretin, and motilin. Its secretion is stimulated by acid in the lumen, and it probably acts in a paracrine fashion to mediate the inhibition of gastrin secretion produced by acid. It also inhibits pancreatic exocrine secretion; gastric acid secretion and motility; gallbladder contraction; and the absorption of glucose, amino acids, and triglycerides. Why is this question frequently asked? Somatostatin and it's analogue Octeotride is associated with a lowering of c. AMP levels in serum and in cholangiocytes. The hepatic cysts are derived from cholangiocytes that have undergone self-proliferation and differentiation and secrete fluid in pa due to the intracellular second messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (c. AMP). Renal cysts in polycystic disease grow in response to c. AMP and that a reduction in c. AMP levels attenuates kidney disease progression. Thus, the preclinical studies provides a strong rationale for evaluating the potential role of octreotide in the treatment of human polycystic disease of the liver and kidneys. This is the current area of reaseach for a possible new therapy for polycystic liver and kidney dissease. Currently there is no known medical treatment. Hence, this is an impoant current topic for exams. Ref: Longo D. L., Fauci A. S., Kasper D. L., Hauser S. L., Jameson J. L., Loscalzo J..

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescence-tagged probes to detect specific DNA sequences in tissue samples. It is not used for introducing genes into the cells. Methods for genetic manipulation: Transfection is the most commonly used method for introducing transgenes into human embryonic stem (h. ES) cells. This system is based on the use of carrier molecules that bind to foreign nucleic acids and introduce them into the cells through the plasma membrane. Electroporation is a method that employs the administration of sho electrical impulses that create transient pores in the cell membrane, allowing foreign DNA to enter into the cells. Infection is gene manipulation by viral infection which can produce a very high percentage of modified cells. Advantage over other systems are, high efficiency of DNA transfer (almost 100% efficiency) and single copy integrations. Recombination occurs by physical exchange of DNA. An endogenous gene can be replaced by a transfected gene using homologous recombination. Recombination is the result of crossing-over that occurs at chiasmata and involves two of the four chromatids.

The molecule has a sulfhydryl (-SH) or thiol group on the cysteine, which accounts for its strong electron-donating character. It exists in two forms: reduced glutathione or GSH. In the reduced state, the thiol group of cysteine is able to donate a reducing equivalent (H+ e-) to other unstable molecules, such as reactive oxygen species. In donating an electron, glutathione itself becomes reactive, but readily reacts with another reactive glutathione to form glutathione disulfide (GSSG) or oxidized glutathione. GSH can be regenerated from GSSG by the enzyme glutathione reductase. While all cells in the human body are capable of synthesizing glutathione, liver glutathione synthesis has been shown to be essential. The liver is the largest GSH reservoir. Because of its reducing propey, reduced glutathione has potent antioxidant action. Functions: GSH is an extremely impoant cell protectant. It directly reduces reactive hydroxyl free radicals, other oxygen centered free radicals, and radical centers on DNA and other biomolecules. GSH is the essential cofactor for many enzymes which require thiol-reducing equivalents, and helps keep redox-sensitive active sites on enzymes in the necessary reduced state. GSH is used as a cofactor by? Multiple peroxidase enzymes, to detoxify peroxides generated from oxygen radical attack on biological molecules; Transhydrogenases, to reduce oxidized centers on DNA, proteins, and other biomolecules; and Glutathione S-transferases (GST) to conjugate GSH with endogenous substances (e. g., estrogens) and to exogenous electrophiles (e. g., arene oxides, unsaturated carbonyls, organic halides), and diverse xenobiotics. GSH is a primary protectant of skin, lens, cornea, and retina against radiation damage, and the biochemical foundation of P450 detoxication in the liver, kidneys, lungs, intestinal epithelia, and other organs. GSH acts as a carrier in transpo of ceain amino acids across membranes in the kidney. Glutathione (GSH) paicipates in leukotriene synthesis.",

        "exp": "Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease characterized by the deposition of cholesterol and cholesteryl ester from the plasma lipoproteins into the artery wall and is a major cause of heart disease. Elevated plasma cholesterol levels (>5. 2 mmol/L) are one of the most important factors in promoting atherosclerosis, but it is now recognized that elevated blood triacylglycerol is also an independent risk factor. Diseases in which there is a prolonged elevation of levels of VLDL, IDL, chylomicron remnants, or LDL in the blood (eg, diabetes mellitus, lipid nephrosis, hypothyroidism, and other conditions of hyperlipidemia) are often accompanied by premature or more severe atherosclerosis. There is also an inverse relationship between HDL (HDL2) concentrations and coronary heart disease, making the LDL: HDL cholesterol ratio a good predictive parameter. This is consistent with the function of HDL in reverse cholesterol transport. Susceptibility to atherosclerosis varies widely among species, and humans are one of the few in which the disease can be induced by diets high in cholesterol. Key Concept: Low LDL: HDL cholesterol ratio does not lead to arteriosclerosis. Reference: HARPERS ILLUSTRATED BIOCHEMISTRY30th ed Page no 274",

        "exp": "Glucose, galactose, and fructose are all reducing sugars, and elevations of all of these sugars can be detected with Clinitest. Neither lactose nor pyruvate can be detected, thus eliminating lactase and pyruvate dehydrogenase as plausible choices.

Of these, only fructokinase deficiency produces a mild (usually completely asymptomatic) condition known as fructosuria. Fructose 1-phosphate aldolase deficiency produces severe hereditary fructose intolerance. Galactose 1-P-uridyl transferase deficiency produces classic galactosemia.

        "exp": "Transferrin is a glycoprotein synthesized in the liver having a central role in the body's metabolism of iron. Each mole of transferrin can transpo two moles of ferric iron into circulation to sites where iron is required. Free iron is toxic, but when associated with transferrin, this toxicity is greatly diminished. When bound to transferrin, iron can be directed to cells where it is needed. Many cells have transferrin receptors and upon binding, the transferrin-receptor complex is internalized. The acidic pH of the lysosome causes the iron to disassociate from transferrin. Iron-free transferrin is then recycled to the cell surface along with its receptor where then it re-enters the circulation. Ceruloplasmin is a major copper carrier of the body and is also synthesized in the liver. Metallothioneins are found in many cells and can bind copper, zinc, cadmium and mercury. Ferritin is an intracellular iron-binding protein. It does not play a role in iron metabolism or transpo, and its function is to prevent ionized iron from reaching toxic levels within cells. Haptoglobin is a plasma glycoprotein that binds extracorpuscular hemoglobin. This function of haptoglobin is to prevent free hemoglobin from being lost through the kidneys since the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex is too large to pass through the glomerulus. Ref: Beutler E.

The gene for aldolase B is on chromosome 9q22. 3. Deficiency of this enzyme activity causes a rapid accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate and initiates severe toxic symptoms when exposed to fructose. Clinical manifestations Patients with HFI are asymptomatic, until fructose or sucrose (table sugar) is ingested (usually from fruit, fruit juice or sweetened cereal). Symptoms may occur early in life, soon after birth if food or formulas containing these sugars are introduced into the diet. Early clinical manifestations resemble galactosemia and include jaundice, hepatomegaly, vomiting, lethargy, irritability and convulsions, hypoglycemia. Acute fructose ingestion produces symptomatic hypoglycemia. If the intake of the fructose persists, hypoglycemic episodes recur and liver and kidney failure progress, eventually leading to death. Chronic ingestion results in failure to thrive. Laboratory diagnosis Prolonged clotting time, hypoalbuminemia, elevation of bilirubin and transaminase levels. Proximal tubular dysfunction. Definitive diagnosis is made by assay of fructaldolase B activity in the liver. Gene-based diagnosis for the mutation. Treatment Complete exclusion of all sources of fructose.

In PCR, the DNA to be amplified is replicated by DNA polymerase of Thermus aquaticus (Taq). Taq polymerase is used because it is thermostable, not denatured at a temperature upto 95degC (in PCR DNA is to be heated to 94deg-95deg C for separation of strands). For amplifying a desired DNA sequence in DNA, we have to know sho flanking sequences on either side of the target sequence so that complementary primers can be prepared. Primers are the synthetic oligonucleotides of 20-35 sequence, which have sequence complementary to flanking sequence, i. e. sequence of flanking region of target DNA sequence.

Protein structure can be classified into four level of organization. 1) Primary structures. The linear sequence of amino acid residues and location of disulphide bridges, if any, in a polypeptide chain constitute its primary structure. In simple words, primary structure of proteins refers to the specific sequence of amino acids. Primary structure is maintained by covalent 'peptide' bond. 2) Secondary structure. For stability of primary structure, hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen of NH and oxygen of C = 0 groups of the polypeptide chain occurs, which give rise to twisting, folding or bending of the primary structure. Thus, regular folding and twisting of the polypeptide chain brought about by hydrogen bonding is called secondary structure. Impoant types of secondary structure are a-helix, O-pleated sheet and 0-bends. 3) Teiary structure. The peptide chain, with its secondary structure, may be fuher folded and twisted about itself forming three-dimensional arrangement of polypeptide chain, i. e., teiary structure refers to the overall folding pattern of polypeptide which forms three dimensional shape. Teiary structure (three dimensional shape) is maintained by weak non-covalent interactions which include hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic bond (electrostatic bonds or salt bridges) and Van-der wall forces. Covalent linkage (disulphide bond) also plays some (but minor) role. 4) Quaternary structure. Many proteins are made up of more than one polypeptide chains (polymers). Each polypeptide chain is known as protomer (or subunit). The subunit are linked with each other by non-covalent bonds. The structure formed by union of subunits is known as quaternary structure, i. e., spatial relation of subunits (peptide chains) with one another is called quaternary structure. Mainly three non-covalent bonds stabilize quaternary structure: Hydrophobic, hydrogen and ionic (electrostatic). Dimeric proteins contain two polypeptide chains.

In gluconeogenesis, other enzymes are needed to bypass these key steps. Pyruvate cannot be directly conveed to phosphoenolpyruvate in gluconeogenesis. Therefore, pyruvate carboxylase (a mitochondrial enzyme;) conves pyruvate to oxaloacetate, which can be conveed to phosphoenolpyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase using two ATP equivalents per molecule of phosphoenolpyruvate. Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphataseis the enzyme that splits fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate into fructose-6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate. It is also required for gluconeogenesis. Glucose-6-phosphatase is a liver enzyme that hydrolyzes glucose-6-phosphate to glucose. A deficiency of this enzyme leads to von Gierke disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type I. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is a mitochondrial enzyme that conves pyruvate to acetyl CoA. This enzyme requires thiamine pyrophosphate, lipoamide, and FAD as cofactors. Glucokinase is a liver enzyme that conves glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Unlike hexokinase, it is specific for glucose and is unresponsive to the level of glucose-6-phosphate. Its function is to store excess glucose, so it has a very high Km (ie, a low affinity) for glucose, becoming active only when the concentration of glucose is very high. Ref: Bender D. A., Mayes P. A.

The condition was named after the yellowish (ocher-like) discoloration of the tissue seen on microscopic examination. However, macroscopically the affected tissues appear bluish grey because of a light scattering phenomenon known as the Tyndall effect. The condition is most often associated with alkaptonuria but can occur from exogenous administration of phenol complexes like hydroquinone. Alkaptonuria (black urine disease or alcaptonuria) is a rare inherited genetic disorder of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism. This is an autosomal recessive condition that is due to a defect in the enzyme homogentisate 1, 2-dioxygenase, which paicipates in the degradation of tyrosine. As a result, a toxic tyrosine byproduct called homogentisic acid (or alkapton) accumulates in the blood and is excreted in urine in large amounts (hence -uria)",

        "question": "A patient presents with retinoblastoma. He has a single tumor in one eye. Which of the following test could be used to determine whether this is a heritable or sporadic tumor?",
        "exp": "Foy percent of retinoblastomas are heritable; the child inherits one mutant allele through the germline and a somatic mutation in the other allele occurs, resulting in the loss of function of that gene. This leads to tumor development, often with multiple tumors in both eyes. Penetrance, however, is not complete, since the second mutation is a chance event. Sixty percent of retinoblastomas are sporadic; both alleles are inactivated by somatic mutation. Because this is a rare event, tumors usually are in only one eye and present at a later age. To detect a mutation in the Rb gene and differentiate between heritable and sporadic cases of retinoblastoma, PCR is the most appropriate technique of the choices given. Using the appropriate primers, a deletion can be detected as a change in size of the DNA band amplified. In heritable cases, one chromosome will show the altered length from the deletion or the translocation in any cell in the body. In sporadic retinoblastoma, samples isolated from anywhere other than the tumor should have two normal alleles. DNA footprinting is a protocol used to detect specific protein binding to DNA molecules by comparing the fragmentation patterns of DNA bound with the protein of interest vs. unbound DNA following digestion with DNase I. If the bound protein protects against DNase I digestion, the position of the protein on the DNA can be deduced by the loss of the characteristic fragment. FACS uses antibodies coupled to fluorescent markers to determine cell surface molecules on whole cells. It is very useful for determining the stage of development or activation of cells, but does not give you any insight into the DNA. Nohern blotting, the RNA counterpa to Southern blotting, will determine the size and abundance of m. RNA of a specific gene in a given sample of RNA. RNA is not able to be cleaved by restriction enzymes the way the DNA can; however, RNA molecules for different proteins are of different lengths. The sample is separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with a specific, labeled probe. This will be exposed to film and the bands will appear, revealing the size and the abundance of specific m. RNAs.",

Alpha oxidation is mainly used for fatty acids that have a methyl group at beta-carbon, which block beta-oxidation. This process occur mainly in endoplasmic reticulum & some also in peroxisomes. Refsum's disease is a rare neurologic disorder due to a metabolic defect that results in the accumulation of phytanic acid, which is found in dairy products and ruminant fat and meat. Phytanic acid is thought to have pathological effects on membrane function, protein prenylation, and gene expression\" (Harper 30th/231, 28th/191). Refsum disease can manifest in infancy to early adulthood with the classic tetrad of (1) peripheral neuropathy, (2) retinitis pigmentosa, (3) cerebellar ataxia, and (4) elevated CSF protein concentration. Refsum disease is genetically heterogeneous but autosomal recessive in nature. Classical Refsum disease with childhood or early adult onset is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes for phytanoyl-CoA a-hydroxylase (PAHX). Refsum disease is treated by removing phytanic precursors (phytols: fish oils, dairy products, and ruminant fats) from the diet.",

At this time (72 hours of starvation) option b, c and d all are correct. But, the best answer here is d i. e. increased gluconeogenesis. Let us see each option one by one. Glycogen stores are depleted in 16-18 hours. Breakdown of fat (lipolysis) and ketogenesis occurs in the later part of the first stage. But fatty acids and ketone bodies are utilized mainly during the second and third stage. Further, lipolysis provides glycerol, which is used for gluconeogenesis. Protein degradation occurs, but it is to provide alanine for gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis is maximum on the third day and it is responsible for maintenance of blood glucose in early as well as in late stages of starvation. Thus, the best answer here is gluconeogenesis. If we put except in the question, then the answer will become 'a' i. e., glycogenolysis, as glycogen stores are depleted in 16-18 hours.",

Exopeptidases catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, one at a time, from the ends of peptides. - Carboxypeptidases, secreted in the pancreatic juice, release amino acids from the free carboxyl terminal. - Aminopeptidases, secreted by the intestinal mucosal cells, release amino acids from the amino terminal. Dipeptidases and tripeptidases in the brush border of intestinal mucosal cells catalyze the hydrolysis of di-and tripeptides, which are not substrates for amino-and carboxypeptidases.

This accounts for the slow onset of the effect of SRS-A. Leukotrienes are formed from arachidonic acid by the lipoxygenase pathway and cause increased vascular permeability and smooth muscle contraction. They are the principal mediators in the bronchoconstriction of asthma and are not influenced by antihistamine. Also Know: Eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis (ECF-A) is a tetrapeptide that exists preformed in mast cell granules. When released during anaphylaxis, it attracts eosinophils that are prominent in immediate allergic reactions. The role of eosinophils in type I hypersensitivity reactions is unceain, but they do release histaminase and arylsulfatase, which degrade two impoant mediators, histamine and SRS-A, respectively. Eosinophils may therefore reduce the severity of the type I response. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 65. Hypersensitivity (Allergy). In W.

Example of such modification include methylation of DNA & the methylation er acetylation of histones. Epigenetic modification is critical for normal development including-regulation of tissue specific gene expression, X-chromosome inactivation & genomic imprinting. An epigenetic modification refers to a change in the genome, heritable by cell progeny, that does not involve a change in the DNA sequence. The inactivation of the second X chromosome in female cells is an example of an epigenetic silencing that prevents gene expression from the inactivated chromosome.",

Thiamine has a central role in energy-yielding metabolism and especially the metabolism of carbohydrates. Thiamine pyrophosphate (also k/a thiamine diphosphate) is the biologically active form of the vitamin. Thiamine diphosphate is the coenzyme for: A) 3 multi-enzyme complexes that catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation reactions. - pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA) - a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase in the citric acid cycle and - branched chain keto-acid dehydrogenase involved in the metabolism of leucine, isoleucine and valine. B) Transketolase, in the pentose phosphate pathway. The oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and a-ketoglutarate play a key role in energy metabolism of most cells. In thiamine deficiency, the activity of these two dehydrogenase reactions is decreased, resulting in a decreased production of ATP and thus, impaired cellular. function. Thiamine Deficiency Thiamine deficiency in its early stages causes anorexia, muscle cramps, paraesthesias, and irritability. Prolonged thiamine deficiency causes beriberi, which is classically categorized as wet or dry, though there is considerable overlap. Wet beriberi primarily presents with cardiovascular symptoms characterized by marked peripheral vasodilation resulting in high-output heart failure with dyspnea, tachycardia, cardiomegaly, and pulmonary and peripheral edema, with warm extremities mimicking cellulitis. Dry beriberi presents with a symmetric peripheral neuropathy of the motor and sensory systems with diminished reflexes. The neuropathy affects the legs more than the arms. Alcoholic patients with chronic thiamine deficiency may also have central nervous system manifestations known as Wernicke's encephalopathy. consistinv of horizontal nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia, cerebellar ataxia, and mental impairment. When there is additional loss of memory and a confabulatory psychosis, the syndrome is known as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. The laboratory diagnosis of thiamine deficiency is usually made by enzymatic assay of transketolase activity measured before and after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate. A more than 25% stimulation of the transketolase activity by the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate is taken as abnormal.",

Inhibitors of respiratory chain may be divided into three groups:? 1) Inhibitors of electron transpo chain proper. These inhibitors inhibit the flow of electrons through the respiratory chain. This occurs at following sites. i) Complex I (NADH to CoQ) is inhibited by: - Barbiturates (amobarbital), Piericidin A (an antibiotic), rotenone (an insectiside), chlorpromazine (a tranquilizer), and guanethidine (an antihypeensive). These inhibitors block the transfer of reducing equivalents from FeS protein to Coe. ii) Complex II is inhibited by: - Carboxin and TTFA inhibit transfer of electon from FADH2 to CoQ, whereas malanate competitively inhibit from succinate to complex II. iii) Complex III (Cytochrome b to cytochrome C1) is inhibited by: - Dimercaprol, antimycin A, BAL (British antilewisite), Naphthyloquinone. These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome b to cytochrome CI. iv) Complex IV (cytochrome C oxidase) is inhibited by: - Carbon monoxide, CN-, H2S and azide (N3). These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome aa3 to molecular oxygen and therefore can totally arrest cellular respiration. 2) Inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation. These compounds directly inhibit phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. Oligomycin inhibits Fo component of Fo F1 ATPase. Atractiloside inhibits translocase, a transpo protein that transpos ADP into mitochondria for phosphorylation into ATP. 3) Uncouples. As the name suggests, these componds block the coupeling of oxidation with phosphorylation. These compounds allow the transfer of reducing equivalents in respiratory chain but prevent the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP by uncoupling the linkage between ETC and phosphorylation. Thus the energy instead of being trapped by phosphorylation is dissipated as heat.

        "exp": "Bile acids. They are steroid acids found predominantly in the bile. Bile acid refers to the protonated (-COOH) form. ile salt refers to the deprotonated or ionized (-COO-) form. Bile salts are bile acids compounded with a cation, usually sodium. The salts of taurocholic acid and glycocholic acid (derivatives of cholic acid) represent approximately eighty percent of all bile salts. The two primary bile acids are cholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid. Bile acids, glycine and taurine conjugates, and 7-alpha-dehydroxylated derivatives (deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid) are all found in intestinal bile. The increase in bile flow is exhibited with an increased secretion of bile acids. e main function of bile acid is to facilitate the formation of micelles, which promotes processing of dietary fat. Bile acids are made in the liver by the cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of cholesterol. They are conjugated with taurine or the amino acid glycine, or with a sulfate or a glucuronide, and are then stored in the gallbladder, which concentrates the salts by removing the water. Rate limiting step is the addition of a hydroxyl group on position 7 of the steroid nucleus by the enzyme cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. Upon eating a meal, the contents of the gallbladder are secreted into the intestine, where bile acids serve the purpose of emulsifying dietary fats. Bile acids serve other functions, including eliminating cholesterl from the body, drivin the ow of bile to eliminabte catabolites from the liver, emulsifying lipids and fat soluble vitamins in the intestine g to form micelles thatt. can be transpoed the lacteal system, and aiding in the reduction of the bacteria flora found in the smal intes ine a biliary tract. Conjugated bile acids are more efficient at emulsifying fats because at intestinal pH, they are more ionized than unconjugated bile acs. The body produces about 800 mg of cholesterol per day and about half of that is used for bile acid synthesis. In total about 20-30 grams of bile acids are secreted into the intestine daily. About 90% of excreted bile acids are reabsorbed by active transpo in theileum and recycled in what is referred to as the enterohepatic circulation which moves the bile salts from the intestinal system back to the liver and the gallbladder.",

All the amino groups from amino acids that undergo transamination are collected into one common amino acid, i. e., glutamate. This is impoant because L-glutamate is the only amino acid that undergoes oxidative deamination at an appreciable rate in mammalian tissue. Thus, formation of ammonia from amino acids occurs mainly the a-amino nitrogen of glutamate. Transamination is not restricted to a-amino groups. The 6-amino group of ornithine (but not the E-amino group of lysine) undergoes transmination.",

        "exp": "Vitamin K is required for the post translational carboxylation of glutamic acid, which is necessary for calcium binding to -carboxylated proteins such as prothrombin (factor II); factors VII, IX, and X; protein C; protein S; and proteins found in bone (osteocalcin) and vascular smooth muscle (e. g., matrix Gla protein). Warfarin-type drugs inhibit -carboxylation by preventing the conversion of vitamin K to its active hydroquinone form. Must know: There are two natural forms of vitamin K: vitamin K1, also known as phylloquinone, from vegetable and animal sources, and vitamin K2, or menaquinone, which is synthesized by bacterial flora and found in hepatic tissue.

If you got that far, you could have figured out which of the choices would inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids. Ceainly glucagon, a catabolic hormone released in response to low blood glucose, would be a likely candidate to inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids. In fact, glucagon inhibits fatty acid synthesis by a c. AMP-dependent phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Conversely, glucagon stimulates fatty acid oxidation. Citrate is a key player in fatty acid synthesis (citrate shuttle). Therefore, the presence of citrate would stimulate, not inhibit, acetyl-CoA carboxylase. A high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet (would stimulate, not inhibit, the synthesis of fatty acids. In contrast to glucagon, insulin is an anabolic hormone that promotes fatty acid synthesis and therefore would stimulate acetyl-CoA carboxylase. It does so by dephosphorylating the enzyme.

In DNA, the most common modified base is 5-methylcytosine. Other impoant modified bases are acetylcytosine and dimethyladenine. Transfer RNA (t RNA) The function of t. RNA is to transpo amino acids in an activated form from cytosol to ribosome for protein synthesis. 10-20% bases of t. RNA may be modified and known as modified or unusual basese. A modified base is one that has been modified (altered) after nucleic acid chain has been formed, i. e. modified base is altered purine or pyrimidinee, e. g.? Dihydrouridine (D)deg in which one of the double bonds of the base is reduced. Ribothymidine (T) in which methyl group is added to uracil to form thymine. Thus, t. RNA is the only RNA that can contain thyminee though only some times. Pseudouridine (w) in which uracil is attached to ribose by a carbon-carbon bond rather than a nitrogen bond. t-RNA molecule get folded into a structure that appears like a clover leafe.

D arm - It contains the base dihydrouridine (D). 3. Anticodon arm - It contains anticodone that base pairs with the codon of coming m. RNA. Anticodon has nucleotide sequence complementary to the codon of m. RNA and is responsible for the specificity of the t RNA. 3) Tyr C arm: It contains both ribothymidine (T) and pseudouridine (v).

' Traumatic brain injury-induced phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase: a mechanism of dysregulated'Study demonstrates that TBI causes a significant reduction in PDH enzyme, disrupt-acid-base balance and increase oxidative stress in blood Also, lower PDH enzyme in blood is related to the increased gliosis and loss of its PDH El-infinity subunit PDH in brain tissue, and these effects of TBI were prevented by pyruvate treatment.

Increased ventricular CSF lactate concentration was also reliably associated with increased intracranial pressure (ICP).

The light is produced through a chemical reaction involving Luciferin, which is the substrate, Luciferase, the enzyme, ATP, and oxygen. The basic reaction sequence is: The luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of luciferin into oxyluciferin. In the process light is emitted. Since the light producing reaction is dependent on ATP, it allows researchers to determine the presence of ATP and hence the presence of life. (If ATP is present in a sample of something that is a good indication that life is occurring within that specimen). NASA has used this method to test for life on other planets. If luciferin and luciferase compounds were mixed with samples and they produced a glowing reaction this would mean the presence of ATP and hence life. This reaction is also used for antibiotic susceptibility testing. If the enzyme Luciferase is added to a cultured sample of Tuberculosis and an antibiotic is also added, the strength of the antibiotic can be tested. If the drug fails, then the bacteria will continue to thrive and glow. This research has also been employed in gene activation therapy cases, where ultraviolet cameras seek out genes treated with Luciferase. If light is visible, this means that the Luciferase gene is active. This will help researchers to know when they have made a successfully attempt at gene therapy.",

        "question": "Number of ATP generated in one TCA cycle?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., 10 In a single TCA cycle 10 molecules of ATP are produced (12 molecules according to older calculations). One turn of the TCA cycle, staing with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the staing molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2. 5 ATPs and therefore, 12. 5 ATPs are produced when staing compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle. Note: Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from staing. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2. 5 ATPs and FADH produces 1. 5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs. Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per molecule of glucose when it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows:-",

Therefore, it is called apo B-48. In the intestine, after synthesis of 2152 amino acids by their respective codons, the codon 2153 (CAA) acts as stop codon which terminates further synthesis. Therefore, in the intestine, translation stops at the 2153rd codon so that instead of a polypeptide chain of 4536 amino acids (i. e. apo B-100), a shorter polypeptide chain of 2152 amino acids (i. e. apo B-48) is synthesized.
