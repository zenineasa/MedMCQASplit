The Stokes radius is a function of molecular mass and shape. When rapidly tumbling, an elongated protein occupies a larger effective volume than a spherical protein of the same mass. Size-exclusion chromatography employs porous beads. The pores are analogous to indentations in a riverbank. As objects move downstream, those that enter an indentation are retarded until they drift back into the main current. Similarly, proteins with Stokes radii too large to enter the pores (excluded proteins), remain in the flowing mobile phase, and emerge before proteins that can enter the pores (included proteins).

Proteoglycan monomer resembles a bottle brush as it consists of a core protein to which linear GAG chains are covalently attached. Each chain may be composed of > 100 monosaccharide chains, remain separated from each other because of charge repulsion. The GAGs present in the proteoglycans are polyanions and hence bind polycations and cations such as Na+ and K+. This latter ability attracts water by osmotic pressure into the extracellularmatrix and contributes to its turgor. GAGs also gel at relatively low concentrations. Because of the long extended nature of the polysaccharide chains of GAGs and their ability to gel, the proteoglycans can act as sieves, restricting the passage of large macromolecules into the ECM but allowing relatively free diffusion of small molecules. Again, because of their extended structures and the huge macromolecular aggregates they often form, they occupy a large volume of the matrix relative to proteins. proteoglycan=GAGs + Protein ( <= 5%) = + proteins Key Concept: The GAGs present in the proteoglycans are polyanions and hence bind polycations and cations such as Na+ and K+.

        "exp": "The procedure to separate and detect DNA fragments is termed Southern blotting which is named after Edwin M. Southern. Here, DNA is first isolated and then digested into small fragments with restriction enzymes. Separation of the various segments of DNA is accomplished by incubating the DNA mixture in a gel matrix and then using electrophoresis. The same approach can be used with RNA and is termed Nohern blotting. Finally, a similar procedure can be performed to separate proteins in a procedure called Western blotting. However, in the case of proteins, hybridization is performed using an antibody to the protein of interest rather than a c. DNA probe.

        "exp": "The hormone glucagon stimulates ketogenesis whereas insulin inhibits. The increased ratio of glucagons/insulin in diabetes mellitus promotes ketone bodies formation. Diabetic ketoacidosis. It arises because of a lack of insulin in the body. The lack of insulin and corresponding elevation of glucagon leads to increased release of glucose by the liver (a process that is normally suppressed by insulin) from glycogen and through gluconeogenesis. High glucose levels spill over into the urine, taking water and solutes (such as sodium and potassium) along with it in a process of osmotic diuresis. Ketones, too, paicipate in osmotic diuresis and lead to fuher electrolyte losses. This leads to polyuria, dehydration, and compensatory thirst and polydipsia. The absence of insulin also leads to the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue, which are conveed, again in the liver, into ketone bodies (acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate). Beta-Hydroxybutyrate can serve as an energy source in absence of insulin-mediated glucose delivery, and is a protective mechanism in case of starvation. The ketone bodies, however, have a low pH and therefore turn the blood acidic (metabolic acidosis). The body initially buffers the change with the bicarbonate buffering system, but this system is quickly overwhelmed and other mechanisms compensate for the acidosis. One such mechanism is hyperventilation to lower the blood carbon dioxide levels (a form of compensatory respiratory alkalosis). This hyperventilation, in its extreme form, may be observed as Kussmaul respiration. Blood sugars rise, dehydration ensues, and resistance to the normal effects of insulin increases fuher by way of a vicious circle. As a result of the above mechanisms, the average adult DKA patient has a total body water shoage of about 6 liters (or 100 mL/ kg), in addition to substantial shoages in sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate, magnesium and calcium. Glucose levels usually exceed 13. 8 mmol/L or 250 mg/ d. LBeta-hydroxybutyrate, despite chemically not actually being a ketone, is the principal \"ketone body\" in diabetic ketoacidosis. DKA is cmmon in type 1 diabetes as this form of diabetes is associated with an absolute lack of insulin production by the islets of Langerhans. In type 2 diabetes, insulin production is present but is insufficient to meet the body's requirements as a result of end-organ insulin resistance. Usually, these amounts of insulin are sufficient to suppress ketogenesis. If DKA occurs in type 2 diabetics, their condition is called \"ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes\". The clinical state of DKA is associated, in addition to the above, with the release of various counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon and adrenaline as well as cytokines. Cerebral edema is the most dangerous DKA complication. It is more likely in those with more severe DKA, and in the first episode of DKA. Other factors in the development of cerebral edema are dehydration, acidosis and low carbon dioxide levels",

It is known that modification of histones is functionally impoant in this process. Enzymatic attachment of an acetyl group to ceain amino acids in histones is critical - Acetylation of histones. The acetylation of histones affects the charge interactions with DNA, resulting in unwinding of DNA at that specific location, and thereby facilitates subsequent steps required to generate nascent m. RNA. Conversely, deacetylation of histones can result in rewinding of chromatin and inhibition of gene expression. This modification of histones is carried out by a large family of enzymes termed histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Why is this topic impoant and frequently asked? 1. Cardiovascular biology: E. g. Experimental studies in mice lacking specific HATs or HDACs can profoundly alter processes such as blood vessel development or cardiac hyperophy. Because acetylation and deacetylation are enzymatic processes, they are amenable to pharmacologic manipulation. Indeed, agents such as trichostatin A have been shown to ameliorate cardiac hyperophy in rodents. 2. Chromatin modification: Acetylation is perhaps the most well-studied chromatin modification so far. However others such as lysine/arginine methylation, serine phosphorylation, and ubiquitination are also likely to be impoant areas from both a scientific and therapeutic perspective for the future.

Mutations in the Shine-Dalgarno sequence can reduce translation. There is a complementary sequence called anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence located at the 3' end of the 16S r. RNA in the ribosome.

        "exp": "m-RNA processing. Prokaryotic m. RNA is functional immediately upon synthesis, i. e. prokaryotic primary transcript of m. RNA is functional. Thus it does not require post-transcriptional modification. In Eukaryotes the primary transcript of m. RNA is the hn RNA (hetrogeneous nuclear RNA). After transcription hn. RNA is extensively modified to form functional m. RNA. These modifications are as follows. 1) The 5'-capping:- This is the first processing reaction. 51-end of m. RNA is capped with 7-methylguansosine. This cap helps in initiation of translation (protein synthesis) and stabilizes the structure of m. RNA by protecting from 5'-exonuclease. 2) Addition of poly 'A' tail:- As the name suggests, multiple 'A' (adenylate) residues are added at 3'end. This poly-A tail is not transcribed from DNA, but rather added after transcription. These tails helps to stabilize the m. RNA (by protecting from 3'-exonuclease), facilitate exit from the nucleus, and aid in translation. After m. RNA enters the cytosol, the poly-A tail is gradually shoened. Some m. RNAs do not have poly-A tail, e. g. m. RNAs of histones and some interferons. 3) Removal of introns (splicing):- Eukaryotic genes contain some coding sequences which code for protein and some intervening non-coding sequences which do not code for protein. The coding sequences are called `exons' and intervening non-coding sequences are called `introns'. The process by which introns are excised and exons are linked to form functional m. RNA is called splicing. Thus mature m. RNA does not contain introns. Splicesome Splicesome is an assembly made up of small nuclear RNA (sn. RNA), some proteins and hn. RNA. sn. RNA combines with proteins to form small nuclear ribnonucleoprotein paicles (sn. RNPs or snurps) that mediate splicing. It is sn. RNA component of snurps that catalyzes splicing. Snurps are U4, U5 and U6. Only about 1-5% of human DNA has coding sequence (exons). Remaining is non-coding (introns). 4) Alternate splicing:- The hn-RNA molecules from some genes can be spliced in alternative way in different tissues. Thus two or more different m. RNA (and therefore 2 or more proteins) can be synthesized from same hn. RNA. For example, difference isoforms of tropomyosin in different tissues in due to alternate splicing.",

Treatments aim at increasing genetic expression of LDL receptors (i. e., apo B-100 receptors) to enhance clearance of LDL paicles. Dietary changes, a resin drug, niacin, or an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor could be tried. Apo B-100 is the apoprotein of liver-produced lipoproteins such as VLDL, IDL and LDL.

The major noncarbohydrate precursors (substrate) for gluconeogenesis are lactate, pyruvate, glycerol, glucogenic amino acids, propionate and intermediates of the citric acid cycle. All aminoacids, except for leucine and lysine, are substrate for gluconeogenesis. Alanine is the most impoant gluconeogenic amino acid. Gluconeogenesis occurs mainly in the liver and to a lesser extent in renal coex. Some gluconeogenesis can also occur in small intestine, but it is not significant. Some of the reactions of gluconeogenesis occurs in the mitochondria but most occur in cytosol. Gluconeogenesis involves glycolysis, the citric acid cycle plus some special reactions. Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis share the same pathway but in opposite direction. Seven reactions of glycolysis are reversible and therefore are used with same enzyme in the synthesis of glucose by gluconeogenesis. However, three of the reactions of glycolysis are irreversible and must be circumvented by four special reactions which are unique to gluconeogenesis and catalyzed by: (1) Pyruvate carboxylase, (ii) Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, (iii) Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase, (iv) Glucose-6-phosphatase. These four enzymes are the key enzymes of gluconeogenesis (or gluconeogenesis enzymes). Among these four, pyruvate carboxylase is a mitocondrial enzyme and other three are cytoplasmic enzymes.",

At very high pH, DNA is resistant to hydrolysis. The resistance of DNA to alkaline hydrolysis is due to unavailability of free sugar hydroxyl group at 2' - position, and also an intermediate 2', 3' cyclic phosphates can not form as they do during hydrolysis of RNA.

CO2 is produced in the pentose phosphate pathway but not in glycolysis; Mg2+ ions are required for both glycolysis (for the phosphorylation of glucose by glucokinase) and the pentose phosphate pathway (for the functioning of transketolase and several other enzymes). Thiamine is used only in the pentose phosphate pathway (in the form of thiamine pyrophosphate as the coenzyme of transketolase). Thiamine-dependent enzymes are not involved in glycolysis taking pa on later stages when pyruvate is either conveed to acetyl CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase or (in microorganisms) is reduced to ethanol by pyruvate decarboxylase.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Alanine. DISPOSAL/DETOXIFICATION OF AMMONIA1. First line of Defense (Trapping of ammonia). Being highly toxic, ammonia should be eliminated or detoxified, as and when it is formed. Even very minute quantity of ammonia may produce toxicity in central nervous system. But, ammonia is always produced by almost all cells, including neurons. The intracellular ammonia is immediately trapped by glutamic acid to form glutamine, especially in brain cells. The glutamine is then transpoed to liver, where the reaction is reversed by the enzyme glutaminase. The ammonia thus generated is immediately detoxified into urea. Aspaic acid may also undergo similar reaction to form asparagine. 2. Transpoation of Ammonia. Inside the cells of almost all tissues, the transamination of amino acids produce glutamic acid. However, glutamate dehydrogenase is available only in the liver. Therefore, the final deamination and production of ammonia is taking place in the liver. Thus, glutamic acid acts as the link between amino groups of amino acids and ammonia. The concentration of glutamic acid in blood is 10 times more than other amino acids. Glutamine is the transpo forms of ammonia from brain and intestine to liver; while alanine is the transpo form from muscle. 3. Final disposal. The ammonia from all over the body thus reaches liver. It is then detoxified to urea by liver cells, and then excreted through kidneys. Urea is the end product of protein metabolism. Transpo of alanine from muscle to liver (glucose-alanine cycle) has two functions:? i) Providing substrate for gluconeogenesisii) Transpo of ammonia (NH4-) to liver for urea synthesis.",

There arc three impoant characteristic features in alkaptonuria? i) Urine becomes dark after being exposed to air. It is due spontaneous oxidation of homogentisate into benzoquinone acetate, which polymerse to form black-brown pigment alkapton which impas a characteristic black-brown colour to urine. ii) Alkapton deposition occurs in sclera, ear, nose, cheeks and interveebral disc space. A condition called ochronosis. There may be calcification of interveebral discs. iii) Onchronosis ahritis affecting shoulder, hips, knee.

Iron leaves the mucosal cell via a transport protein ferroportin, but only if there is free transferrin in plasma to bind to. Once transferrin is saturated with iron, any that has accumulated in the mucosal cells is lost when the cells are shed. Expression of the ferroportin gene (and possibly also that for the divalent metal ion transporter) is downregulated by hepcidin, a peptide secreted by the liver when body iron reserves are adequate. In response to hypoxia, anemia, or hemorrhage, the synthesis of hepcidin is reduced, leading to increased synthesis of ferroportin and increased iron absorption.

After the telomers get shoened by a critical length, cell stops dividing and enters into Go phase (senscence). However, germ cells, cancer cells and stem cells have an enzyme telomerase (telomerase activity) which prevents telomer shoening. Thus telomers are not shoened in these cells, and therefore these cells have ability to self replicate extensively. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase (RNA dependent DNA polymerase) and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomers (replication of end of chromosome). Thus, telomerase provide longetivity to the cells which contain this enzyme. Telomerase is absent from most of the somatic cells and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the cell cycle.",

It next makes a complementary RNA copy of the DNA template strand and then recognizes the end of the DNA sequence to be transcribed (the termination region). RNA is synthesized from its 5\u2032-end to its 3\u2032-end, antiparallel to its DNA template strand. The template is copied as it is in DNA synthesis, in which a guanine (G) on the DNA specifies a cytosine (C) in the RNA, a C specifies a G, a thymine (T) specifies an adenine (A), but an A specifies a uracil (U) instead of a T The RNA, then, is complementary to the DNA template (antisense, minus) strand and identical to the coding (sense, plus) strand, with U replacing T. Within the DNA molecule, regions of both strands can serve as templates for transcription. For a given gene, however, only one of the two DNA strands can be the template.

FISH can be used in metaphase cells to detect specific microdeletions beyond the resolution of routine cytogenetics or identify extra material of unknown origin.

All of the other choices have neutral side chains and are uncharged at physiological pH. They would most likely be found in the hydrophobic core of the protein structure. Alanine, isoleucine, and leucine all have aliphatic side chains; phenylalanine and tryptophan have aromatic side chains. Ref: Rodwell V. W. (2011). Chapter 30.

        "exp": "Ans: C.). Dihydropterin reductase. METABOLISM OF PHENYLALANINEOverview of pathway: Phenylalanine can be conveed into one of two products. If the a-amino group is removed from phenylalanine, it is transformed into phenylpyruvate, which is eventually broken down into fumarate and entered into the citric acid cycle. Alternatively, phenylalanine can be used to synthesize tyrosine. The conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine is catalyzed by phenylalanine hydroxylase.* Impoant enzymes: Phenylalanine hydroxylase: Hydroxylates phenylalanine to tyrosine. Requires tetrahydrobiopterin and O 2 as cofactors. Dihydrobiopterin reductase: Regenerates tetrahydrobiopterin by reducing dihydrobiopterin to form tetra- hydrobiopterin. Requires a molecule of NADPH.* Diseases: When phenylalanine hydroxylase or dihydropteridine reductase is deficient, phenylketonuria results. Pathophysiology: When this enzyme is deficient, phenylalanine builds up. High levels of phenylalanine lead to severe brain damage by competitively inhibiting amino acid transpo required for protein synthesis, impairing polyribosome stabilization, reducing myelin production, and decreasing the formation of norepinephrine and serotonin. Phenylalanine is also a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase, a key enzyme in the pathway of melanin synthesis, and thereby leads to hypopigmentation of the hair and skin. Clinical Manifestations. Mental and growth retardation; microcephaly; decreased pigmentation (blonde and blue-eyed); eczema; \"mousy\" body odor; heavy perspiration; musty urine odor; hypeonia, hyperreflexia. Lab findings: Phenylketones detected in urine (phenylacetate, phenyllactate, and phenyl-pyruvate); positive Guthrie test (measures phenylalanine in blood) at bih. Treatment: Decreased intake of phenylalanine (avoid aspaame, which is found in Nutrasweet) and increased dietary tyrosine (essential amino acids for patients with this disorder).",

        "exp": "The conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone is considered the rate-limiting and regulated step in steroid biosynthesis in the zona fasciculata, which secretes the glucocoicoid, coisol. ACTH binds to a membrane-associated receptor and increases c. AMP formation. The subsequent activation of protein kinases and phosphorylation results in increased expression of LDL receptors and activation of cholesterol esterase. The increase in LDL receptors increases the delivery of cholesterol to the zona fasciculata. The activation of cholesterol esterase increases the liberation of intracellular cholesterol from cholesterol esters. ACTH also induces a mitochondrial protein called steroidogenic acute regulatory (St. AR) protein. St. AR functions to shuttle cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme conves it to pregnenolone. Also Know: Coicosterone is conveed to aldosterone in the zona glomerulosa, but not in the zona fasciculata. This is also a regulated step. Angiotensin II acts a membrane-associated receptor to increase the activity of aldosterone synthase (a combination of two enzymes with 18b-hydroxylase activity) and, hence, increase aldosterone synthesis and secretion. 11-deoxycoisol is conveed to coisol primarily in the zona fasciculata, but also in the zona reticularis. The enzyme responsible is 11b-hydroxylase, a mitochondrial enzyme. 11b-hydroxylase is not regulated by ACTH. Pregnenolone is conveed to progesterone in all steroid secreting tissues. The enzymes responsible are 3b-ol dehydrogenase and D4, 5-isomerase. These enzymes are cytoplasmic, and are not regulated by ACTH. Ref: Weil P. (2011). Chapter 41.

        "question": "All are involved in fast axonal transpo. except",
        "exp": "Neurofilaments Intracellular transpo is the one of the most impoant function of the eukaryotic cell. Nothing can function without the constant shuttling of intracellular components from place to place. Intracellular transpo is orchestrated by a diverse constellation of molecular motor proteins that bind specific cargoes and convey them in a paicular direction along cytoskeletal polymer tracks. Cytoskeletal polymer tracks are made up of intracellular network of filamentous structures. Essentially all eukaryotic cells contain 3 types of filamentous structures: - actin filaments also k/a microfilaments - microtubules and - intermediate filaments. four classes of intennediate. filaments are found- Keratins, Vimentin- like proteins, Neurofilaments and Lamins. Axons are slender cylindrical processes and can extend for distances in excess of one meter in large animals, yet they are dependent on the cell body for the synthesis of many of their components. Materials destined for the axon are transpoed anterogradely, toward the axon tip, and materials destined to return are transpoed retrogradely, toward the cell body. This bidirectional transpo process, known as axonal transpo, is not fundamentally different from the pathways of macromolecular and membrane traffic that occur in all eukaryotic cells, but it is remarkable for its scale. Proteins and other molecules are transpoed along axons in association with distinct membranous and nonnzembranous cargo structures that move at different rates. Membranous organelles move most rapidly, in the fast components of axonal transpo, whereas cytoskeletal polymers and cytosolic protein complexes move more slowly, in the slow components. Membranous organelles like endocytic vesicles, lysosomes, golgi body derived vescicles are the principal cargoes of fast axonal transpo. The many proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides that move along the axon at fast rates do so by viue of their association with one or more subclasses of organelle or vesicle, either because they are sequestered within its lumen, embedded in its membrane, or bound to its surface. Membranous organelles move along both microtubule and microfilament tracks powered by molecular motor proteins (kinesins, dyneins, and myosins). Microtubules appear to be the principal tracks for long-range movements along the axis of the axon. Plus end-directed kinesin motors propel organelles along microtubules anterogradely, whereas dynein (and possibly also minus end-directed kinesin motors) propel organelles retrogradely. Non membranous cargoes like cytoskeletal polymers (microfilaments, microtubules and neurofilaments) and cytosolic protein complexes move more slowly, in the slow components. It was earlier believed that the fast and slow axonal transpo are due to fundamentally distinct mechanisms of transpo. But recent discoveries have shown that the underlying mechanism for both fast and slow transpo is. the same. They move at different rates due to difference in their duty ratio. The duty ratio is the propoion of time that a cargo structure spends actually moving. Thus the slow overall rate of movement of cytoskeletal filaments suggests that these structures move with a low duty ratio, spending most of their time not moving.

Affected children also develop life-threatening problems in other organs and tissues, such as the liver, heart, and kidneys. Children with Zellweger syndrome usually do not survive beyond the first year of life. The signs and symptoms of Zellweger syndrome typically become apparent within the first few hours or days of life. Affected newborns often have poor muscle tone (hypotonia); seizures; feeding difficulties; liver cysts with liver dysfunction.

Phytanic acid is thought to have pathological effects on membrane function, protein prenylation, and gene expression.

At its isoelectric pH, an amino acid is in zwitterion form (dipolar molecule), i. e. has both positive and negative charge on same acid, but overall molecule is electrically neutral. The carboxy (-COON) group of an amino acid can donate protein (Er) and behave as an acid forming a negatively charged anion (coo). Amino group (-N1-12) can accept proton (I-1+) and behave as a base, forming positively charged cation (NH3'). Amphoteric propey of amino acid Substances having a two-way propey are called amphoteric or ampholyte. Amino acids have both acidic and basic groups, i. e., they can donate a proton or accept a proton, hence amino acids are referred to as amphoteric. Amphoteric propey is related to:? Zwitterion or dipolar molecule Monoamine-Monocarboxylic amino acids exist as dipolar ion or zwitterions, i. e., they have both positive and negative charges on the same amino acids. The a-COOH group donate its proton to amino group (-NH2) and becomes negatively charged anion (C00). The a-NH2 group accepts proton from carboxyl group (a-COOH) to form positively charged cation (NH3').

These nonsense codons are utilized in the cell as termination signals; they specify where the polymerization of amino acids into a protein molecule is to stop. The remaining 61 codons code for 20 amino acids. Thus, there must be degeneracy in the genetic code, ie; multiple codons must decode the same amino acid. Some amino acids are encoded by several codons; for example six different codons, UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU, and AGC all specify serine. Other amino acids, such as methionine and tryptophan, have a single codon. In general, the third nucleotide in a codon is less impoant than the first two in determining the specific amino acid to be incorporated, and this accounts for most of the degeneracy of the code. However, for any specific codon, only a single amino acid is indicated; with rare exceptions, the genetic code is unambiguous--that is, given a specific codon, only a single amino acid is indicated. The distinction between ambiguity and degeneracy is an impoant concept. Ref: Weil P. (2011). Chapter 37. Protein Synthesis & the Genetic Code. In D. A. Bender, K. M. Botham, P. A. Weil, P. J.

What is the best explanation regarding the fate of the glucose in the soft drink?",
        "exp": "The Michaelis constant (Km) is a means of characterising an enzyme's affinity for a substrate. The Km in an enzymatic reaction is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half its maximum speed. Thus, a low Km value means that the enzyme has a high affinity for the substrate (as a \"little\" substrate is enough to run the reaction at half its max speed). Hexokinase has a low Km for glucose, and in the liver is saturated and acting at a constant rate under all normal conditions. Glucokinase has a considerably higher Km (lower affinity) for glucose, so that its activity increases with increases in the concentration of glucose in the hepatic poal vein. It promotes hepatic uptake of large amounts of glucose after a carbohydrate meal. It is absent from the liver of ruminants, which have little glucose entering the poal circulation from the intestines. Hexokinase is inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate and is most active with low levels of glucose 6-phosphate. Glucokinase found in the liver has a high Km for glucose and is very active after a meal. The glucose in the soft drink would likely be used for ATP production. At normal systemic-blood glucose concentrations (4. 5-5. 5 mmol/L), the liver is a net producer of glucose. However, as the glucose level rises, the output of glucose ceases, and there is a net uptake. Ref: Bender D. A., Mayes P. A. (2011). Chapter 20. Gluconeogenesis & the Control of Blood Glucose. In D.

The two forms of enzyme can be conveed into each other by a covalent modification of the enzyme molecule. The most common covalent modification is the addition or removal of a phosphate group. The covalent attachment of phosphate group conves the enzyme into phophorylated form whereas removal of phosphate group conves the same enzyme into dephosphorylated form. One of the forms of the enzyme, either phosphorylated or dephosphorylated, is active and the other is inactive. Phosphorylation of the enzyme is catalyzed by a protein kinase that transfers a phosphate group from ATP to the enzymes. Dephosphorylation of the enzyme is catalyzed by a protein phosphatase that removes the phosphate group from the enzyme. Whether the enzyme will be active or inactive at a given time depends upon the relative activities of protein kinase and protein phosphatase which are usually controlled by hormones through second messengers. An example is glycogen synthase, which is active in dephosphorylated state and inactive in phosphorylate state. Glucagon stimulates formation of c. AMP (a second messenger) which inturn stimulates protein kinase. Protein kinase catalyze the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase. Therefore, glucagon inactivate glycogen synthase.",

Once DNA damage has been incurred, p53 can elicit several different responses to either correct the errors or destroy the damaged cell. 3 Impoant actions: 1. p53 can induce G1 cell cycle arrest, which stops the cell from dividing and allows time to repair the damage before the DNA is replicated. 2. p53 can activate DNA repair proteins to drive the repair of damaged DNA. 3.

Energy source during in exercise can be summarized by: -i) Sho burst of intense activity (e. g., 100 meter sprint or weight lifting): - All energy comes from ATP and creatine phosphate. Breakdown of these compound is an anaerobic processes. ii) Little longer intense exercise (e. g., 200 meter sprint or 100 meter swim):- Besides ATP and creatine phosphate, glycogen is metabolised by anerobic glycolytic pathways to provide a ready source of energy. So, muscle work is anaerobic. iii) Longer duration exercise (e. g., jogging, marathan run): - The muscle work is aerobic and energy comes from aerobic utilization of glucose and free fatty acids.

Hair, which is composed of linear protein sequences, is curly or straight depending on the number of cystine disulfide bonds. Ref: Janson L. W., Tischler M. E. (2012). Chapter 1.

HMP shunt is required for provision of reduced NADPH and fiver-carbon sugars e. g. ribose (Pentose phosphates) for nucleic acid synthesis. Normally, 90% of glucose is oxidized by glycolysis and 10% is oxidized by HMP shunt. However, in liver and RBCs HMP shunt accounts for oxidation of 30% glucose. HMP shunt occurs in the cytosol. It is highly active in liver, adipose tissue, adrenal coex, lens, cornea, lactating (but not the nonlactating) mammary gland, Gonads (testis, ovary) and erythrocytes. Activity of this pathway is minimal in muscle and brain, where almost all of the glucose is degraded by glycolysis.",

        "exp": "The porphyrias are a group of rare, related diseases that have in common a block in the heme synthesis pathway. The block is usually paial rather than complete, and thus many of these patients have only intermittent symptoms. Most cases of porphyria present with either a neurovisceral pattern (including both psychiatric symptoms and abdominal pain) or with photosensitive skin lesions. These two patterns are associated with different forms of porphyria. Must know: Associate abnormalities of glycogen degradation (with the glycogen storage diseases, such as Von Gierke disease, Pompe disease, and Forbes disease. Associate abnormalities of lipoprotein degradation with some forms of hyperlipoproteinemia (notably Type I). Associate abnormalities of nucleotide degradation with Gout and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

        "question": "Base stacking of DNA leads to:",
        "exp": "Base stacking: stacking of the nucleotide chromophores in helical structures leads to the phenomenon of 'hypochromicity' (diminished ability of the bases to absorb ultraviolet light). The nucleotides may lay in a such a way that the faces of the ring are appositioned. The stacking is most likely to occur near chain termini where the bases move. It gives rigiditiy to the strand. Stacking of the DNA (and RNA) bases is a strong contributor to the overall stabilization of the double helix. It is detected by circular dichroism and optical rotatary dispersion. Hyperchromicity and hypochromicity: DNA maximally absorbs ultraviolet light at a wavelength of 260nm. Bases are principally responsble for absorption. Stacking of DNA diminishes the capacity of bases to absorb light resulting in hypochromicity. Elimination of stacking by denaturation or heating results in hyperchromicity. The explanation for this increase is that duplex DNA absorbs less ultraviolet light by about 40% than do individual DNA chains.

        "exp": "Nucleosides and/or nucleotides are essential components of genetic material and are, therefore, intimately involved in the proliferation of cells. Fluorocytosine, can be used as an antibiotic because it is conveed into an active \"nucleoside or nucleotide\" only in bacteria. Human cells are not affected by its presence. Because analogues has its own special synthetic process, no other nucleotides and nucleosides are affected by the drugs. Aminopterin and methotrexate are also chemotherapy agents, which act by blocking folate addition to purine rings. Unlike fluorocytosine, though, these agents also affect rapidly dividing human cells such as hair and intestines, resulting in the common chemotherapy side effects of hair loss and nausea/vomiting.
