After the telomers get shoened by a critical length, cell stops dividing and enters into Go phase (senscence). However, germ cells, cancer cells and stem cells have an enzyme telomerase (telomerase activity) which prevents telomer shoening. Thus telomers are not shoened in these cells, and therefore these cells have ability to self replicate extensively. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase (RNA dependent DNA polymerase) and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomers (replication of end of chromosome). Thus, telomerase provide longetivity to the cells which contain this enzyme. Telomerase is absent from most of the somatic cells and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the cell cycle.",

Without the galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase enzyme, the infant is unable to metabolize galactose-1- phosphate, the accumulation of which results in injury to kidney, liver and brain. Clinical features: Classic galactosemia is a serious disease with onset of symptoms typically by the 2nd half of the 1st week of life. With jaundice, vomiting, seizures, lethargy, irritability, feeding difficulties, poor weight gain or failure to regain birth weight. Hepatomegaly Oil drop cataracts, Hepatic failure. Mental retardation. Patients with galactosemia are at increased risk for Escherichia coli neonatal sepsis. Diagnosis: Demonstrating a reducing substance in several urine specimens collected while the patient is receiving human milk, cow's milk or any other formula containing lactose.

        "exp": "This question requires two logical steps: first, you need to appreciate that the hydrophilic amino acids are more likely to appear on the surface of a protein molecule, while hydrophobic amino acids are most likely be found in its interior. Next, you need to figure out which of the amino acids listed is hydrophilic. If you recall that arginine is a basic amino acid that is positively charged at physiologic pH, you should be able to answer this question right away. All of the other choices have neutral side chains and are uncharged at physiological pH. They would most likely be found in the hydrophobic core of the protein structure. Alanine, isoleucine, and leucine all have aliphatic side chains; phenylalanine and tryptophan have aromatic side chains. Ref: Rodwell V. W. (2011). Chapter 30.

        "exp": "Ans: C.). Dihydropterin reductase. METABOLISM OF PHENYLALANINEOverview of pathway: Phenylalanine can be conveed into one of two products. If the a-amino group is removed from phenylalanine, it is transformed into phenylpyruvate, which is eventually broken down into fumarate and entered into the citric acid cycle. Alternatively, phenylalanine can be used to synthesize tyrosine. The conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine is catalyzed by phenylalanine hydroxylase.* Impoant enzymes: Phenylalanine hydroxylase: Hydroxylates phenylalanine to tyrosine. Requires tetrahydrobiopterin and O 2 as cofactors. Dihydrobiopterin reductase: Regenerates tetrahydrobiopterin by reducing dihydrobiopterin to form tetra- hydrobiopterin. Requires a molecule of NADPH.* Diseases: When phenylalanine hydroxylase or dihydropteridine reductase is deficient, phenylketonuria results. Pathophysiology: When this enzyme is deficient, phenylalanine builds up. High levels of phenylalanine lead to severe brain damage by competitively inhibiting amino acid transpo required for protein synthesis, impairing polyribosome stabilization, reducing myelin production, and decreasing the formation of norepinephrine and serotonin. Phenylalanine is also a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase, a key enzyme in the pathway of melanin synthesis, and thereby leads to hypopigmentation of the hair and skin. Clinical Manifestations. Mental and growth retardation; microcephaly; decreased pigmentation (blonde and blue-eyed); eczema; \"mousy\" body odor; heavy perspiration; musty urine odor; hypeonia, hyperreflexia. Lab findings: Phenylketones detected in urine (phenylacetate, phenyllactate, and phenyl-pyruvate); positive Guthrie test (measures phenylalanine in blood) at bih. Treatment: Decreased intake of phenylalanine (avoid aspaame, which is found in Nutrasweet) and increased dietary tyrosine (essential amino acids for patients with this disorder).",

The failure of mesenchymal cells to form collagen causes the skeletal, dental, and connective tissue deterioration seen in scurvy. Thiamine, niacin, cobalamin, and pantothenic acid can all be obtained from fish or meat products.

        "exp": "3 out of 64 codons do not code for any amino acid. These have been termed nonsense codons. These nonsense codons are utilized in the cell as termination signals; they specify where the polymerization of amino acids into a protein molecule is to stop. The remaining 61 codons code for 20 amino acids. Thus, there must be degeneracy in the genetic code, ie; multiple codons must decode the same amino acid. Some amino acids are encoded by several codons; for example six different codons, UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU, and AGC all specify serine. Other amino acids, such as methionine and tryptophan, have a single codon. In general, the third nucleotide in a codon is less impoant than the first two in determining the specific amino acid to be incorporated, and this accounts for most of the degeneracy of the code. However, for any specific codon, only a single amino acid is indicated; with rare exceptions, the genetic code is unambiguous--that is, given a specific codon, only a single amino acid is indicated. The distinction between ambiguity and degeneracy is an impoant concept. Ref: Weil P. (2011). Chapter 37. Protein Synthesis & the Genetic Code. In D. A. Bender, K. M. Botham, P. A. Weil, P. J.

The enzymes needing magnesium are involved in intermediary metabolism, transcellular ion transpo, muscle contraction and oxidative phosphorylation. Impoant examples of such enzymes are hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, Glucose-6- phosphatase, enolase, creatine kinase, other phosphatases and kinases, adenylate cyclase, glutamine synthase, thiokinase, squalene synthase etc. 2. Neuromuscular excitibility. Neuromuscular excitibility is decreased by magnesium, therefore, a decrease in magnesium level results in increased nerve excitibility. 3. Other. Magnesium improves glucose tolerance, probably by enhancing insulin dependent glucose uptake. Magnesium is a constituent of bone & teeth.

Once DNA damage has been incurred, p53 can elicit several different responses to either correct the errors or destroy the damaged cell. 3 Impoant actions: 1. p53 can induce G1 cell cycle arrest, which stops the cell from dividing and allows time to repair the damage before the DNA is replicated. 2. p53 can activate DNA repair proteins to drive the repair of damaged DNA. 3. As a last reso, p53 can induce damaged cells to undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis), thereby eliminating damaged and potentially dangerous cells at risk for neoplastic transformation.

These patients have LDL receptor deficiencies and are at a great risk of advanced coronary atherosclerosis. Since it is autosomal dominant, the patient's father could have been affected as well. Type I hyperlipidemia, or familial hyperchylomicronemia, is caused by a lipoprotein lipase deficiency. These patients have high serum triglycerides and normal cholesterol. They do not have a substantially higher risk of atherosclerosis. Type IIb hyperlipidemia, or familial combined hyperlipidemia, presents as elevated serum LDL, VLDL, cholesterol, and triglycerides. These patients do have an increased incidence of atherosclerosis. Type III hyperlipidemia, or familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, presents as increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides.

Taurine has many fundamental biological roles such as conjugation of bile acids, antioxidation, osmoregulation, membrane stabilization and modulation of calcium signaling. It is essential for cardiovascular function, and development and function of skeletal muscle, the retina and the central nervous system. Taurine is unusual among biological molecules in being a sulfonic acid, while the vast majority of biologically occurring acids contain the more weakly acidic carboxyl group. Mammalian taurine synthesis occurs in the pancreas the cysteine sulfinic acid pathway. In this pathway, the sulfhydryl group of cysteine is first oxidized to cysteine sulfinic acid by the enzyme cysteine dioxygenase.

The nucleotides may lay in a such a way that the faces of the ring are appositioned. The stacking is most likely to occur near chain termini where the bases move. It gives rigiditiy to the strand. Stacking of the DNA (and RNA) bases is a strong contributor to the overall stabilization of the double helix. It is detected by circular dichroism and optical rotatary dispersion. Hyperchromicity and hypochromicity: DNA maximally absorbs ultraviolet light at a wavelength of 260nm. Bases are principally responsble for absorption. Stacking of DNA diminishes the capacity of bases to absorb light resulting in hypochromicity. Elimination of stacking by denaturation or heating results in hyperchromicity. The explanation for this increase is that duplex DNA absorbs less ultraviolet light by about 40% than do individual DNA chains.

        "question": "One bacterium receives a gene for restriction endonuclease from another by horizontal transduction. What is the likely outcome?",
        "exp": "The DNA methylase offers protection from endonucleolytic attack by the separate restriction enzyme. The descendants of cells that had lost the genes encoding DNA restriction endonucleases appeared unable to modify a sufficient number of recognition sites in their chromosomes to protect them from lethal attack by the remaining restriction enzymes, and consequently died. Hence, the fate of this bacterium which received a gene for for restriction endonuclease will be the same as given above. Restriction endonuclease: Restriction endonucleases cut DNA at specific sites when the bases are not protected (modified, usually, methylation). Bacteria synthesize restriction enzymes as a defense against invading foreign DNAs such as phages and foreign plasmids. Three major types have been recognized. Type I enzymes are single multifunctional proteins of three subunits. Type II enzymes are used most widely for genetic engineering. Type II enzymes have separate endonuclease and methylase proteins. Type III enzymes carry out restriction and modification by two proteins with a shared polypeptide.

        "question": "A 42-year-old man presents to his doctor with complaints of left-sided flank pain radiating into his groin. The pain began suddenly and has increased in intensity. He had a similar problem several years ago, but he did not seek medical attention, and his symptoms resolved spontaneously. He denies fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. He has had no diarrhea or difficulty urinating. Physical examination is remarkable for tenderness along the left flank and into the groin, but is otherwise normal. There are no inguinal hernias detected on examination. A urinalysis reveals microscopic hematuria without casts. Serum chemistry reveals: Sodium: 143 m. Eq/L Potassium: 2. 4 m. Eq/L Bicarbonate: 17 m. Eq/L Chloride: 115 m. Eq/L Blood urea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL Creatinine: 1. 0 mg/dL Glucose: 85 mg/dL Which of the following is MOST likely present in this patient?",
        "exp": "This patient's bicarbonate is lower than the normal range of 22-28 m. Eq/L. This means that there is less bicarbonate in his blood than usual. If his breathing is normal, then his CO2 level should be about normal. Bicarbonate is produced when CO2 binds to an H2O molecule, which then splits into a H+ ion and a HCO3- (bicarbonate) ion. This reaction is governed by an equilibrium constant propoional to the concentrations of the products multiplied together over the concentrations of the reactants multiplied together. By convention, the \"water\" concentration is ignored because it is \"constant. \" So, in order for the equilibrium constant to not change value, the H+ concentration must increase if the bicarbonate decreases and the CO2 remains the same. This means that an acidosis is produced. In this case, it is a metabolic acidosis, since there is no indication of respiratory disease in this patient. Neither a normal acid-base status nor a metabolic alkalosis would have a low bicarbonate. Note: The hallmark of metabolic acidosis is decreased HCO3-. Metabolic acidosis are classified by the anion gap, either normal or increased. The anion gap is the difference between readily measured anions and cations. Ref: Cho K. C. (2013). Chapter 21.

During the reduction of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase, glutathione acts as a donor of the necessary reducing equivalent generating oxidized glutathione. Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide of the structure gamma glutamyl cysteinyl-glycine, where the cysteine sulfhydryl side chains can form a disulfide bond between two molecules (designated as GSSG). To again perform the role of cofactor for glutathione peroxidase, the disulfide bond of GSSG must be reduced. This reaction is catalyzed by glutathione reductase which requires NADPH as a cofactor. Therefore, in order to maintain a red cell membrane structure, erythrocytes utilize the pentose phosphate pathway for the generation of large amounts of NADPH. Erythrocytes are enucleate and therefore do not synthesize DNA and have no need for ribose-5-phosphate. Production of 2, 3- diphosphoglycerate occurs through a side reaction of glycolysis, not the pentose phosphate pathway. The pentose phosphate pathway does not generate ATP or result in the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Ref: Bender D. A., Mayes P. A. (2011). Chapter 21.

Changes in the DNA sequence should be reflected in a change in the m. RNA sequence and, depending on codon usage, in protein sequence. An exceptions to this dogma is, coding information can be changed at the m. RNA level by RNA editing. In such cases, the coding sequence of the m. RNA differs from that in the cognate DNA. An example is the apolipoprotein B (apoB)gene and m. RNA. In liver, the single apo. Bgene is transcribed into an m. RNA that directs the synthesis of a 100-k. Da protein, apo. B100. In the intestine, the same gene directs the synthesis of the primary transcript; however, a cytidine deaminase conves a CAA codon in the m. RNA to UAA at a single specific site. Rather than encoding glutamine, this codon becomes a termination signal, and a 48-k. Da protein (apo. B48) is the result. Apo. B100 and apo. B48 have different functions in the two organs.

        "exp": "Citrate is produced by citrate synthase from acetyl CoA and oxaloacetate. This reaction takes place in the mitochondria, but citrate can move freely from the mitochondria into the cytosol. When the citric acid cycle slows down, citrate accumulates. In the cytosol, it acts as a negative allosteric regulator of phosphofructokinase I, the enzyme that catalyzes the committed step of glycolysis. Fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase breaks down fructose-2, 6-bisphosphate, a potent allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase I. Fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase is activated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Isocitrate dehydrogenase conves isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate in the citric acid cycle. It is allosterically stimulated by ADP and inhibited by ATP and NADH. This reaction produces NADH and CO2. Pyruvate carboxylase is a mitochondrial enzyme that conves pyruvate to oxaloacetate. It is impoant in gluconeogenesis and replenishes the oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle. Ref: Bender D. A., Mayes P. A. (2011). Chapter 20. Gluconeogenesis & the Control of Blood Glucose. In D. A.

Rise in intracellular Ca+2 triggers neurotransmitter release. 3) Salty-tasting substances depolarize taste cells by activating amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels. 4) Sour-tasting substances depolarize taste cells by raising the intracellular H + ion concentration, which causes closure of K+ channels. The umami taste is the fifth taste which is unique. The proposed mechanism of umami taste is through glutamate taste sensors (glutamate receptors) with release of neuronal glutamic acid.

        "exp": "Substances that reduce the activity of an enzyme are called inhibitors. Reversible inhibitors bind to an enzyme but rapidly dissociate from it. There are several types of reversible inhibitors: Competitive inhibitors usually resemble the substrate and compete with it for binding at the active site. Thus, increasing the concentration of substrate will decrease the percent inhibition of the enzyme. The Vmax is unchanged, but the Km is increased. A noncompetitive inhibitor binds with equal affinity to both enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex. This binding leads to a distoion of the substrate binding site, so new substrate cannot bind and/or the product cannot be released. In this kind of inhibition, the Vmax is decreased (choice A), but the Km is not altered. Adding more substrate will not reverse this type of inhibition. This is the equivalent of decreasing the turnover number. An uncompetitive inhibitor does not bind to free enzyme, but binds to the enzyme-substrate complex at a site other than the catalytic site. Once bound by the inhibitor, the enzyme is trapped in the enzyme-substrate complex state until the inhibitor dissociates. In this kind of inhibition, the slope of the reaction (which is the ratio Km/Vmax) remains the same, but both Vmax and Km are reduced. Ref: Janson L. W., Tischler M. E. (2012). Chapter 5.

Creatine phosphate is a phosphagen which acts as a reservoir of ATP especially in the cardiac muscle which is the highest consumer of energy.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Increasing activation energy. Enzymes increase the rate of a biochemical reaction, therefore they are called catalysts of reaction. Now the question arises that how does they do that? In a chemical reaction, the substrate has to be conveed to a higher energy form (called transition form) before it can form the reaction products. The transition state is structurally an intermediate between the substrate and the product, and represents the highest energy arrangement of atoms. Therefore, it is unstable; once formed, it decomposes almost immediately to form the reaction product. So, this high energy intermediate acts as energy barrier, separating the substrates and the products. This barrier, called the free energy of action, is the energy difference between the energy of the substrates and high energy intermediates. In other words, initially some energy must be put into the substrate for conversion into transition state (high-energy intermediate); this is the free energy of activation. The enzymes speed up the chemical reaction by lowering the magnitude of the activation energy barrier, i. e., free energy of activation. Most enzyme-substrate combinations are mostly due to weak non-covalent interactions like hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interactions, ionic (electrostate) interaction and Vander waals forces. However, covalent catalysis involves the formation of a covalent bond between the amino acyl residues of active site of enzyme and substrate. Covalent catalysis is used by serine proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsine) which bind their substrate covalently at serine side chain.",

The lack of thiamine, which is needed to conve pyruvate to acetyl Co, causes pyruvate to be conveed into lactic acid; the lactic acid then accumulates, causing acidosis. Acute beriberi due to thiamine deficiency is associated with anorexia, vomiting, lactic acidosis, altered heart rate, and cardiomegaly. Acute beriberi mostly seen in infants. In combination with proteins, riboflavin coenzymes, like flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide, function in various dehydrogenation reactions. Deficiency of riboflavin causes cheilosis, glossitis, inflammation of cornea, bloodshot eyes, dimness of vision, photophobia, itching, burning, and dryness of eyes and redness of conjunctiva. Niacin is required for the synthesis of the active forms of vitamin B3, NAD+, and NADP+. Both NAD and NADP function as cofactors for numerous dehydreogenases, e. g. lactate and malate dehydrogenases. Deficiency of niacin causes pellagra characterized by glossitis of the tongue, dermatitis, depression, dementia and diarrhoea. Pantothenic acid is a component of coenzyme A and is required for the synthesis of phosphopantotheine of fatty acid synthases complex.

Which of the following amino acids is the precursor for the neurotransmitter that is deficient in the brain of this patient?",

First, figure out the diagnosis (a classic case of Parkinson's disease), then remember which neurotransmitter is involved in the disease (dopamine), and finally, recall which amino acid serves as the precursor for that neurotransmitter (tyrosine). The hydroxylation of tyrosine by tyrosine hydroxylase results in DOPA, which is then decarboxylated to dopamine. Note that norepinephrine and epinephrine are also tyrosine derivatives, as are the melanins and the thyroid hormones, thyroxine and triiodothyronine. The other answer choices are also precursors of specialized products: Glutamate can be conveed to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA by the action of glutamate decarboxylase. Glycine is involved in the synthesis of both creatine (along with arginine and S-adenosylmethionine) and heme (along with succinyl-CoA). Histidine can be decarboxylated to histamine, an impoant inflammatory mediator. Ref: Beck-Yoo K. (2012). Chapter 19. The Nervous System. In L. W. Janson, M. E.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., UV absorption. Denaturation (melting) of DNADenaturation (melting) refers to separation of the two strands of the DNA into two component strands. When temperature of medium is raised, the hydrogen bonds linking of complementary base pair tends to break. As a result, separation of two strands occur. Melting temperature (Tm) indicates the temperature at which half of the double stranded structure is lost. Normally, Tm is between 85deg C and 95deg C. Since G and C are linked more strongly by three hydrogen bonds, in contrast to two hydrogen bonds linking A and T, G and C linking provides thermostability to DNA. Therefore, DNA molecules having higher GC content have relatively higher Tm. For every 10% increase in GC content, melting temperature increases by 5degC. Simple formula is -Tm (degC ) = 2 (number of AT base pairs) + 4 (number of GC base pairs). In addition to heat, alkali treatment and decrease of salt conentration also cause denatruation. Decrease in salt concentration decreases Tm. Therefore, increase in salt concentration increases DNA duplex stability. Denaturation affects propeies of DNA and these can be used to monitor strand separation -i) Hyperchomicity (hyperchromic effect): DNA bases (purines and pyrimidines) absorb UV light of 260 nm. Upon denaturation, this optical absorbance is increased and is called hyperchromicity of denaturation or hyperchromic effect. ii) Viscosity: Viscosity of the DNA solution decreases on melting (denaturation) because single strands are more flexible than the stiff, resilient double helix. The separated strands of denatured DNA can rejoin on gradual cooling. This is called renaturation or reannealing.",

Thiamine diphosphate (TDP) or TPP is the coenzyme for three multienzyme complexes that catalyze oxidative decarboxylation: Pyruvate dehydrogenase in carbohydrate metabolism, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. a-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase in citric acid cycle, which catalyzes the conversion of a-ketoglutarate to succinyl CoA. Branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of branched chain keto amino acids, i. e. leucine, isoleucine and valine. Thiamine diphosphate is also the coenzume for transketolase, in the pentose phosphate pathway. Therefore, thiamine nutritional status is best assessed by erythrocyte (preferred) or whole blood transketolase activity. Deficiency of thiamine causes: Beriberi.

One form occurs along with renal tubular acidosis and cerebral calcification. It is due to mutations in the gene (located on chromosome 8q22) encoding carbonic anhydrase II (CA II), one of four isozymes of carbonic anhydrase present in human tissues. In osteoclasts involved in bone resorption, CA II apparently provides protons to neutralize the OH- ions left inside the cell when H+ ions are pumped across their ruffled borders. Thus, if CA II is deficient in activity in osteoclasts, normal bone resorption does not occur, and osteopetrosis results. The mechanism of the cerebral calcification is not clear, whereas the renal tubular acidosis reflects deficient activity of CA II in the renal tubules. Harper, Ed 30, Pg No 642, 643",

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6. PD) deficiency is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait, so females would not be affected. Pyruvate kinase is a glycolytic enzyme; pyruvate kinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, affecting males and females approximately equally. If this enzyme is deficient, red cells have trouble producing enough ATP to maintain the Na+/K+ pump on the plasma membrane, secondarily causing swelling and lysis. Debranching enzyme defects produce Cori's disease, one of the glycogen storage diseases. Defects in glucose-6-phosphatase produce Von Gierke's disease, one of the glycogen storage diseases.

Being highly toxic, ammonia should be eliminated or detoxified, as and when it is formed. Even very minute quantity of ammonia may produce toxicity in central nervous system. But, ammonia is always produced by almost all cells, including neurons. The intracellular ammonia is immediately trapped by glutamic acid to form glutamine, especially in brain cells. The glutamine is then transpoed to liver, where the reaction is reversed by the enzyme glutaminase. The ammonia thus generated is immediately detoxified into urea. Aspaic acid may also undergo similar reaction to form asparagine. 2. Transpoation of Ammonia. Inside the cells of almost all tissues, the transamination of amino acids produce glutamic acid. However, glutamate dehydrogenase is available only in the liver. Therefore, the final deamination and production of ammonia is taking place in the liver. Thus, glutamic acid acts as the link between amino groups of amino acids and ammonia. The concentration of glutamic acid in blood is 10 times more than other amino acids. Glutamine is the transpo forms of ammonia from brain and intestine to liver; while alanine is the transpo form from muscle. 3. Final disposal. The ammonia from all over the body thus reaches liver. It is then detoxified to urea by liver cells, and then excreted through kidneys. Urea is the end product of protein metabolism.",

A TATA box is a DNA sequence that indicates the point at which a genetic sequence can be read and decoded. Transcription: Transcription is the process by which DNA is copied (transcribed) to m. RNA, which carries the information needed for protein synthesis. Transcription takes place in two broad steps. First, pre-messenger RNA is formed, with the involvement of RNA polymerase enzymes. Second formation of Messenger RNA. Transcription unit: is a linear sequence of DNA that extends from a transcription sta site to a transcription stop site. The transcription unit--that poion of a gene that is copied by RNA polymerase--consists of coding regions of DNA (exons) interrupted by intervening sequences of noncoding DNA (introns). After transcription, during RNA processing, introns are removed and the exons are ligated together to form the mature m. RNA that appears in the cytoplasm. 1) Transcription Steps: There are three main steps to the process of DNA transcription. Initiation: RNA Polymerase Binds to DNA. DNA is transcribed by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. Specific nucleotide sequences tell RNA polymerase where to begin and where to end. RNA polymerase attaches to the DNA at a specific area called the promoter region. Elongation: Ceain proteins called transcription factors unwind the DNA strand and allow RNA polymerase to transcribe only a single strand of DNA into a single stranded RNA polymer called messenger RNA (m. RNA). The strand that serves as the template is called the antisense strand. The strand that is not transcribed is called the sense strand. Termination: RNA polymerase moves along the DNA until it reaches a terminator sequence. At that point, RNA polymerase releases the m. RNA polymer and detaches from the DNA. 2) Pre m. RNA processing: RNA splicing: pre-m. RNAs typically include introns. Exons: are the continuous coding regions. Introns: are the noncoding intervening sequences. They may serve to separate functional domains (exons) of coding information in a form that permits genetic rearrangement by recombination to occur more rapidly than if all coding regions for a given genetic function were contiguous. Introns are removed by RNA processing in which the intron is looped out and cut away from the exons by sn. RNPs, and the exons are spliced together to produce the translatable m. RNA.

So an enzyme stimulated by glucagon might be involved in either the breakdown of glycogen to glucose (glycogenolysis) or in the creation of glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors (gluconeogenesis). Glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the first step in glycogenolysis; it makes sense that it would be stimulated by glucagon. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the first step in fatty acid synthesis, an anabolic process that would be stimulated by insulin, not glucagon. As its name implies, glycogen synthase is involved in the synthesis of glycogen. Glucagon (and epinephrine) stimulate the phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase. HMG-CoA reductase is the key enzyme involved in the synthesis of cholesterol. Since this is an anabolic process that occurs in the well-fed state, you would expect it to be stimulated by insulin and inhibited by glucagon (which it is). Ref: Bender D. A., Mayes P. A. (2011).
