Histone acetylation and deacetylation are essential pas of gene regulation. These reactions are typically catalysed by enzymes with \"histone acetyltransferase\" (HAT) or \"histone deacetylase\" (HDAC) activity. Acetylation is the process where an acetyl functional group is transferred from one molecule (in this case, Acetyl-Coenzyme A) to another. Deacetylation is simply the reverse reaction where an acetyl group is removed from a molecule. Acetylated histones, octameric proteins that organize chromatin into nucleosomes and ultimately higher order structures, represent a type of epigenetic marker within chromatin. Acetylation removes the positive charge on the histones, thereby decreasing the interaction of the N termini of histones with the negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA. As a consequence, the condensed chromatin is transformed into a more relaxed structure that is associated with greater levels of gene transcription. This relaxation can be reversed by HDAC activity. Relaxed, transcriptionally active DNA is referred to as euchromatin. More condensed (tightly packed) DNA is referred to as heterochromatin. Condensation can be brought about by processes including deacetylation and methylation; the action of methylation is indirect and has no effect upon charge.",

This process occurs in all living organisms and is the basis for biological inheritance. DNA is made up of a double helix of two complementary strands. During replication, these strands are separated. Each strand of the original DNA molecule then serves as a template for the production of its counterpa, a process referred to as semiconservative replication. Cellular proofreading and error-checking mechanisms ensure near perfect fidelity for DNA replication",

They are progressive disorders characterized by lysosomal accumulation of GAGs in various tissues, causing a range of symptoms, such as skeletal and extracellular matrix deformities, and intellectual disability. All are autosomal recessive disorders except Hunter syndrome, which is X linked. Children who are homozygous for any one of these diseases are apparently normal at bih and then gradually deteriorate. In severe cases, death occurs in childhood. There currently is no cure. Incomplete lysosomal degradation of GAGs results in the presence of oligosaccharides in the urine. These fragments can be used to diagnose the specific mucopolysaccharidosis by identifying the structure present on the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharide, because that residue would have been the substrate for the missing enzyme. Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the patient's cellular level of the lysosomal hydrolases. Bone marrow and cord blood transplants, in which transplanted macrophages produce the enzymes that degrade GAGs, have been used to treat Hurler and Hunter syndromes, with limited success.

In Rho-dependent termination, the RNA contains a binding site for a protein called Rho factor. Rho factor binds to this sequence and stas \"climbing\" up the transcript towards RNA polymerase. When it catches up with the polymerase at the transcription bubble, Rho pulls the RNA transcript and the template DNA strand apa, releasing the RNA molecule and ending transcription. Another sequence found later in the DNA, called the transcription stop point, causes RNA polymerase to pause and thus helps Rho catch up.^4 Rho-independent termination depends on specific sequences in the DNA template strand. As the RNA polymerase approaches the end of the gene being transcribed, it hits a region rich in C and G nucleotides. The RNA transcribed from this region folds back on itself, and the complementary C and G nucleotides bind together. The result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall. In a terminator, the hairpin is followed by a stretch of U nucleotides in the RNA, which match up with A nucleotides in the template DNA. The complementary U-A region of the RNA transcript forms only a weak interaction with the template DNA. This, coupled with the stalled polymerase, produces enough instability for the enzyme to fall off and liberate the new RNA transcript. Reference: Harpers illustrated biochemistry 30th edition",

A DNA sequence is a chain of many smaller molecules called nucleotides. DNA (or RNA) nucleotide sequences are read three nucleotides at a time in units called codons, and each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or stops signal. During translation, the sequence of codons is read in order from the nucleotide sequence to synthesize a chain of amino acids and form a protein. Frameshift mutations arise when the normal sequence of codons is disrupted by the inseion or deletion of one or more nucleotides, provided that the number of nucleotides added or removed is not a multiple of three. For instance, if just one nucleotide is deleted from the sequence, then all of the codons including and after the mutation will have a disrupted reading frame. This can result in the incorporation of many incorrect amino acids into the protein. In contrast, if three nucleotides are inseed or deleted, there will be no shift in the codon reading frame; however, there will be either one extra or one missing amino acid in the final protein. Therefore, frameshift mutations result in abnormal protein products with an incorrect amino acid sequence that can be either longer or shoer than the normal protein. Ref-Sathyanarayana 4/e p384",

LNS affects about one in 380, 000 live bihs. The disorder was first recognized and clinically characterized by medical student Michael Lesch and his mentor, pediatrician William Nyhan, who published their findings in 1964. The HGP deficiency causes a build-up of uric acid in all body fluids. This results in both hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria, associated with severe gout and kidney problems. Neurological signs include poor muscle control and moderate intellectual disability. These complications usually appear in the first year of life. Beginning in the second year of life, a paicularly striking feature of LNS is self-mutilating behaviors, characterized by lip and finger biting. Neurological symptoms include facial grimacing, involuntary writhing, and repetitive movements of the arms and legs similar to those seen in Huntington&; s disease. The etiology of the neurological abnormalities remains unknown. Because a lack of HGP causes the body to poorly utilize vitamin B12, some boys may develop megaloblastic anemia.",

STEP 1: Seperation (Denaturation): DNA strands are seperated ( melted ) by heating at 95 Degree Celsius for 15 sec to 2 mins. STEP 2: Priming ( Anneling ): The primers are annealed by cooling to 50 degree celsius fo 0. 5 to 2min. STEP 3: Polymerization: Nw DNA strands are symnthesized by Taq polymerase. These enzyme is derived from bactris Thermus acquaticus that are found in hot springs. Therefore the enzyme is not denatured at high temperature. The polymerase reaction is allowed to take place 72 degree celscius for 30 sec in presence of d. NTPs. Both DNA strands are duplicated in this step. STEP 4: The steps of 1, 2 and 3 are repeated.

Normally, the enzyme alanine glyoxalate amino transferase is located in hepatic peroxiomes: but in these patients the enzyme is present in mitochondria. This leads to increased pool size of glyoxalate, and excess production of oxalate. Rnal depositionof oxalateswould cause nephrolithiasis, renal colic and hematuria. Extrarenal oxalosis may be seen in heart, blood vessels, bone etc TYPE 2 primary hyperoxaluria is a milder condtion causing only urolithiasis and results from deficient activity of cytoplasmic glyoxalte oxidase.

Translation proceeds in three phases: Initiation: The ribosome assembles around the target m. RNA. The first t. RNA is attached at the sta codon. Elongation: The t. RNA transfers an amino acid to the t. RNA corresponding to the next codon. The ribosome then moves (translocates) to the next m. RNA codon to continue the process, creating an amino acid chain. Termination: When a peptidyl t. RNA encounters a stop codon, then the ribosome folds the polypeptide into its final structure. Ref satyanarayana 4e",

Formation of Carbamoyl Phosphate: Condensation of ammonium ion with bicarbonate ion resulting in the formation of carbamoyl phosphate by the help of the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthase-I present in the liver mitochondria. It requires Mg2+ and a dicarboxylic acid i. e. N-acetyl glutamate. This step requires 2 ATPs. 2. Synthesis of Citrulline: Carbamoyl phosphate formed in the first step combines with ornithine resulting in the synthesis of citrulline aided by the enzyme citrulline synthase or ornithine transcarbamoylase. Citrulline is easily permeable to the mitochondrial membrane and hence it diffuses into the cytosol. 3. Synthesis of Argininosuccinate: In the cytosol, citrulline combines with the amino acid aspaate forming argininosuccinate catalysed by the enzyme argininosuccinate synthase. It requires ATP which is hydrolysed to AMP resulting in utilization of two high energy bonds. Mg2+ acts as cofactor. 4. Cleavage of Argininosuccinate: The enzyme argininosuccinase acts reversibly to cleave argininosuccinate into Arginine and fumarate. Fumarate enters the TCA cycle (the linkage between TCA and urea cycle is known as Krebs bi-cycle). 5. Cleavage of Arginine: Arginine is lysed into ornithine and urea under the influence of the enzyme arginase. Hence arginine is known as semi-essential amino acid i. e. though it is synthesized in the body it is not available for protein synthesis. Ornithine is regenerated in this step and the urea cycle completes by the formation of urea. Ornithine and lysine are potent inhibitors of the enzyme arginase. Arginase is also present in testis, renal tubules, mammary gland and skin in minute quantities. The intermediate amino acids formed in the urea cycle i. e. ornithine, citrulline and argininosuccinate are known as non-protein amino acids. Ref-Sathyanarayana 4/e p370",

        "exp": "Puromycin is an aminonucleoside antibiotic, derived from the Streptomyces alboniger bacterium, that causes premature chain termination during translation taking place in the ribosome. Pa of the molecule resembles the 3&; end of the aminoacylated t. RNA. It enters the A site and transfers to the growing chain, causing the formation of a puromycylated nascent chain and premature chain release. The exact mechanism of action is unknown at this time but the 3&; position contains an amide linkage instead of the normal ester linkage of t. RNA. That makes the molecule much more resistant to hydrolysis and stops the ribosome. Puromycin is selective for either prokaryotes or eukaryotes. Also of note, puromycin is critical in m. RNA display. In this reaction, a puromycin molecule is chemically attached to the end of an m. RNA template, which is then translated into protein. The puromycin can then form a covalent link to the growing peptide chain allowing the m. RNA to be physically linked to its translational product. Antibodies that recognize puromycylated nascent chains can also be used to purify newly synthesized polypeptides and to visualize the distribution of actively translating ribosomes by immunofluorescence.
