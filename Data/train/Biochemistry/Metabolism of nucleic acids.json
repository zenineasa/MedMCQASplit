These two strands are always complementary in sequence. One strand serves as a template for the formation of the other during DNA replication, a major source of inheritance. This unique feature of DNA provides a mechanism for the continuity of life. The structure of DNA was found by Rosalind Franklin when she used x-ray crystallography to study the genetic material. The x-ray photo she obtained revealed the physical structure of DNA as a helix. DNA has a double helix structure. The outer edges are formed by alternating deoxyribose sugar molecules and phosphate groups, which make up the sugar-phosphate backbone. The two strands run in opposite directions, one going in a 3' to 5' direction and the other going in a 5' to 3' direction.

Histone acetylation and deacetylation are essential pas of gene regulation. These reactions are typically catalysed by enzymes with \"histone acetyltransferase\" (HAT) or \"histone deacetylase\" (HDAC) activity. Acetylation is the process where an acetyl functional group is transferred from one molecule (in this case, Acetyl-Coenzyme A) to another. Deacetylation is simply the reverse reaction where an acetyl group is removed from a molecule. Acetylated histones, octameric proteins that organize chromatin into nucleosomes and ultimately higher order structures, represent a type of epigenetic marker within chromatin. Acetylation removes the positive charge on the histones, thereby decreasing the interaction of the N termini of histones with the negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA. As a consequence, the condensed chromatin is transformed into a more relaxed structure that is associated with greater levels of gene transcription. This relaxation can be reversed by HDAC activity. Relaxed, transcriptionally active DNA is referred to as euchromatin. More condensed (tightly packed) DNA is referred to as heterochromatin. Condensation can be brought about by processes including deacetylation and methylation; the action of methylation is indirect and has no effect upon charge.",

Significant genetic variants associated with a paicular trait are discovered using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach, in which hundreds of thousands or millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are tested for their association with each trait of interest.

Fuher analysis shows approximately 10% of intact retrocopies may be under positive selection and at least 4% of retrocopies become functional copies eventually. Moreover, human intact retrocopies were found enriched in transcription-related functions.

Proteins are built from smaller units called amino acids, which are specified by three-nucleotide mRNA sequences called codons. Each codon represents a paicular amino acid, and each codon is recognized by a specific tRNA. The tRNA molecule has a distinctive folded structure with three hairpin loops that form the shape of a three-leafed clover. One of these hairpin loops contains a sequence called the anticodon, which can recognize and decode a mRNA codon. Each tRNA has its corresponding amino acid attached to its end. When a tRNA recognizes and binds to its corresponding codon in the ribosome, the tRNA transfers the appropriate amino acid to the end of the growing amino acid chain. Then the tRNAs and ribosome continue to decode the mRNA molecule until the entire sequence is translated into a protein.Ref:<a href=\"",

In eukaryotes, polyadenylation is pa of the process that produces mature messenger RNA(mRNA) for translation. It, therefore, forms pa of the larger process of gene expression. The process of polyadenylation begins as the transcription of a gene terminates. The 3'-most segment of the newly made pre-mRNA is first cleaved off by a set of proteins; these proteins then synthesize the poly(A) tail at the RNA's 3' end. In some genes, these proteins add a poly(A) tail at one of several possible sites. Therefore, polyadenylation can produce more than one transcript from a single gene (alternative polyadenylation), similar to alternative splicing. Ref satyanarayana 4e",

Hybridization of the membrane to a labeled DNA probe then determines the length of the fragments which are complementary to the probe. An RFLP occurs when the length of a detected fragment varies between individuals. Each fragment length is considered an allele and can be used in genetic analysis.RFLP analysis may be subdivided into single- (SLP) and multi-locus probe (MLP) paradigms. Usually, the SLP method is preferred over MLP because it is more sensitive, easier to interpret and capable of analyzing mixed-DNA samples.

They are progressive disorders characterized by lysosomal accumulation of GAGs in various tissues, causing a range of symptoms, such as skeletal and extracellular matrix deformities, and intellectual disability. All are autosomal recessive disorders except Hunter syndrome, which is X linked. Children who are homozygous for any one of these diseases are apparently normal at bih and then gradually deteriorate. In severe cases, death occurs in childhood. There currently is no cure. Incomplete lysosomal degradation of GAGs results in the presence of oligosaccharides in the urine. These fragments can be used to diagnose the specific mucopolysaccharidosis by identifying the structure present on the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharide, because that residue would have been the substrate for the missing enzyme. Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the patient's cellular level of the lysosomal hydrolases. Bone marrow and cord blood transplants, in which transplanted macrophages produce the enzymes that degrade GAGs, have been used to treat Hurler and Hunter syndromes, with limited success.

On the leading strand DNA replication proceeds continuously along the DNA molecule as the parent double-stranded DNA is unwound, but on the lagging strand, the new DNA is made in installments, which are later joined together by a DNA ligase enzyme.

In Rho-dependent termination, the RNA contains a binding site for a protein called Rho factor. Rho factor binds to this sequence and stas \"climbing\" up the transcript towards RNA polymerase. When it catches up with the polymerase at the transcription bubble, Rho pulls the RNA transcript and the template DNA strand apa, releasing the RNA molecule and ending transcription. Another sequence found later in the DNA, called the transcription stop point, causes RNA polymerase to pause and thus helps Rho catch up.^4 Rho-independent termination depends on specific sequences in the DNA template strand. As the RNA polymerase approaches the end of the gene being transcribed, it hits a region rich in C and G nucleotides. The RNA transcribed from this region folds back on itself, and the complementary C and G nucleotides bind together. The result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall. In a terminator, the hairpin is followed by a stretch of U nucleotides in the RNA, which match up with A nucleotides in the template DNA. The complementary U-A region of the RNA transcript forms only a weak interaction with the template DNA. This, coupled with the stalled polymerase, produces enough instability for the enzyme to fall off and liberate the new RNA transcript. Reference: Harpers illustrated biochemistry 30th edition",

Codons consisting of two nucleotides each could provide for only 16(42 )-distinct codons, whereas codons of three nucleotides could provide 64(43 )-specific codons. It is now known that each codon consists of a sequence of three nucleotides; that is, it is a triplet code (see Table 37-1). The initial deciphering of the genetic code depended heavily on in vitro synthesis of nucleotide polymers, paicularly triplets in repeated sequence. This synthetic triplet ribonucleo- tides were used as mRNAs to program protein synthesis in the test tube, and allowed investigators to deduce the genetic code.Ref: Harpers Illustrated Biochemistry, 30th edition, page no: 414",

A DNA sequence is a chain of many smaller molecules called nucleotides. DNA (or RNA) nucleotide sequences are read three nucleotides at a time in units called codons, and each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or stops signal. During translation, the sequence of codons is read in order from the nucleotide sequence to synthesize a chain of amino acids and form a protein. Frameshift mutations arise when the normal sequence of codons is disrupted by the inseion or deletion of one or more nucleotides, provided that the number of nucleotides added or removed is not a multiple of three. For instance, if just one nucleotide is deleted from the sequence, then all of the codons including and after the mutation will have a disrupted reading frame. This can result in the incorporation of many incorrect amino acids into the protein. In contrast, if three nucleotides are inseed or deleted, there will be no shift in the codon reading frame; however, there will be either one extra or one missing amino acid in the final protein. Therefore, frameshift mutations result in abnormal protein products with an incorrect amino acid sequence that can be either longer or shoer than the normal protein. Ref-Sathyanarayana 4/e p384",

        "exp": "A transposable element (TE or transposon) is a DNA sequence that can change its position within a genome, sometimes creating or reversing mutations and altering the cell&;s genome size. Transposition often results in duplication of the TE. Barbara McClintock&;s discovery of these jumping genes earned her a Nobel Prize in 1983. Transposable elements make up a large fraction of the genome and are responsible for much of the mass of DNA in a eukaryotic cell. It has been shown that TEs are impoant in genome function and evolution. In Oxytricha, which has a unique genetic system, these elements play a critical role in development. Transposons are also very useful to researchers as a means to alter DNA inside a living organism. There are at least two classes of TEs: Class I TEs or retrotransposons generally function reverse transcription, while Class II TEs or DNA transposons encode the protein transposase, which they require for inseion and excision, and some of these TEs also encode other proteinsRef: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element",

Codons consisting of two nucleotides each could provide for only 16(42 )-distinct codons, whereas codons of three nucleotides could provide 64(43 )-specific codons. It is now known that each codon consists of a sequence of three nucleotides; that is, it is a triplet code. The terms first, second, and third nucleotide refer to the individual nucleotides of a triplet codon read 5'-3', left to right. A adenine nucleotide; C, cytosine nucleotide; G, guanine nucleotide; Term, chain terminator codon; U, uridine nucleotide. AUG, which codes for Met, serves as the initiator codon in mammalian cells and also encodes for internal methionines in a protein.

LNS affects about one in 380,000 live bihs. The disorder was first recognized and clinically characterized by medical student Michael Lesch and his mentor, pediatrician William Nyhan, who published their findings in 1964. The HGP deficiency causes a build-up of uric acid in all body fluids. This results in both hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria, associated with severe gout and kidney problems. Neurological signs include poor muscle control and moderate intellectual disability. These complications usually appear in the first year of life. Beginning in the second year of life, a paicularly striking feature of LNS is self-mutilating behaviors, characterized by lip and finger biting. Neurological symptoms include facial grimacing, involuntary writhing, and repetitive movements of the arms and legs similar to those seen in Huntington&;s disease. The etiology of the neurological abnormalities remains unknown. Because a lack of HGP causes the body to poorly utilize vitamin B12, some boys may develop megaloblastic anemia.",

        "exp": "A nonsense suppressor mutation is a secondary mutation that reverses the effect of a primary nonsense or chain-termination mutation. Ordinarily, no transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule can recognize a nonsense codon; therefore, protein synthesis terminates when the ribosome reaches such a codon. A nonsense suppressor mutation usually involves the mutation of a tRNA gene, so that the anticodon of the tRNA is altered to a sequence that is complementary to a nonsense codon. The altered tRNA can then bind to the nonsense codon and inse an amino acid at that point in the protein sequence. Thus, protein synthesis is allowed to continue, and the nonsense mutation is suppressed. A silent mutation is one that causes no change in the amino acid sequence of a protein. A missense mutation causes a single amino acid change. A frameshift mutation is the result of an inseion or deletion that alters the reading frame of the ribosome, leading to the production of a garbled amino acid sequence. Ref : Biochemistry by U.

Viruses that integrate their genetic material into the host chromosome enable the viral nucleic acid to be produced along with the host genetic material in a nondestructive manner. As an autonomous unit (i.e., existing outside of the chromosome) however, the viral episome destroys the host cell as it commandeers the host&;s replication apparatuses to make new copies of itself.

However, the valine side chain of hemoglobin S interacts with a complementary sticky patch (formed by phenyl-alanine b85 and leucine b88) on another hemoglobin molecule--a patch that is exposed in deoxygenated but not in oxygenated hemoglobin. This mutation is the one that occurs in sickle-cell anemia. This alteration markedly reduces the solubility of the deoxygenated, but not the oxygenated, form of hemoglobin because the hemoglobin molecules interact with one another until a complex forms that is large enough that it cannot be solubilized.

STEP 1 :Seperation (Denaturation) : DNA strands are seperated ( melted ) by heating at 95 Degree Celsius for 15 sec to 2 mins. STEP 2 :Priming ( Anneling ) : The primers are annealed by cooling to 50 degree celsius fo 0.5 to 2min. STEP 3 :Polymerization : Nw DNA strands are symnthesized by Taq polymerase.These enzyme is derived from bactris Thermus acquaticus that are found in hot springs.Therefore the enzyme is not denatured at high temperature. The polymerase reaction is allowed to take place 72 degree celscius for 30 sec in presence of dNTPs.Both DNA strands are duplicated in this step.

In brief, it proposes that successive DNA mutations in a single cell cause cancer (monoclonality). This theory places carcinogenesis at the cellular and subcellular hierarchical levels of biological complexity. Its basic premises are that (1) cancer is a defect of the control of cell proliferation and (2) the default state of metazoan cells is quiescence. These two premises have recently been contradicted by evidence. Suppoers of the theory have dealt with these lacks of fit by incorporating ad hoc explanations similar to the use of epicycles in pre-Copernican astronomy. We propose the adoption of an alternative theory, the tissue organization field theory of carcinogenesis and neoplasia. Its basic premises are that (1) proliferation is the default state of all cells and (2) carcinogenesis and neoplasia are defects of tissue architecture. Carcinogens would act initially by disrupting the normal interactions that take place among cells in the parenchyma and stroma of an organ (the equivalent of the \"morphogenetic fields\" of developing organisms). Stroma appears as the primary target of carcinogens. Carcinogenesis and neoplasia occur entirely through emergent (supracellular) phenomena. Neoplastic cells may be reprogrammed to behave like \"normal\" cells within normal tissues. We argue that it is necessary to abandon the somatic mutation theory. Researchers will then become free to adopt alternative reliable premises to build a theory that explains carcinogenesis as another outcome, aberrant as it may be, of biological organization.",

Specificity is based on the use of two oligonucleotide primers that hybridize to complementary sequences on opposite strands of DNA and flank the target sequence. DNA synthesis is catalyzed by a heat-stable DNA polymerase purified from one of a number of different thermophilic bacteria, organisms that grow at 70degC to 80degC. Thermostable DNA polymerases withstand sho incubations at over 90deg, temperatures required to completely denature DNA. These thermostable DNA polymerases have made automation of PCR possible.DNA sequences as sho as 50 to 100 bp and as long as 10 kb can be amplified by PCR. Twenty cycles provide an amplification of 106 (ie, 220) and 30 cycles, 109 (230). Each cycle takes <=5 to 10 minutes so that even large DNA molecules can be amplified rapidly. The PCR allows the DNA in a single cell, hair follicle, or spermatozoon to be amplified and analyzed. The PCR is also used (1) to detect infectious agents, especially latent viruses; (2) to make prenatal genetic diagnoses; (3) to detect allelic polymorphisms; (4) to establish precise tissue types for transplants; and (5) to study evolution, using DNA from archeological samples (6) for quantitative RNA analyses after RNA copying and mRNA quantitation by the so-called -PCR method (cDNA copies of mRNA generated by a retroviral reverse transcriptase) or (7) to score in vivo protein-DNA occupancy using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.Ref: HArper&;s Biochemistry; 30th edition; Page no: 459",

Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene-environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life. Genes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population. These alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, which cause different phenotype traits. Colloquial usage of the term \"having a gene\" (e.g., \"good genes,\" \"hair color gene\") typically refers to having a different allele of the gene. Genes evolve due to natural selection or survival of the fittest of the alleles. The concept of a gene continues to be refined as new phenomena are discovered. For example, regulatory regions of a gene can be far removed from its coding regions, and coding regions can be split into several exons. Some viruses store their genome in RNA instead of DNA and some gene products are functional non-coding RNAs. Therefore, a broad, modern working definition of a gene is any discrete locus of heritable, genomic sequence which affects an organism&;s traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression.",

        "exp": "The protein occurs in the plasma in 2 main isoforms, ApoB48 and ApoB100. The first is synthesized exclusively by the small intestine, the second by the liver. ApoB-100 is the largest of the apoB group of proteins, consisting of 4563 amino acids. Both isoforms are coded by APOB and by a single mRNA transcript larger than 16 kb. ApoB48 is generated when a stop codon (UAA) at residue 2153 is created by RNA editing. There appears to be a trans-acting tissue-specific splicing gene that determines which isoform is ultimately produced. Alternatively, there is some evidence that a cis-acting element several thousand bp upstream determines which isoform is produced. As a result of the RNA editing, ApoB48 and ApoB100 share a common N-terminal sequence, but ApoB48 lacks ApoB100's C-terminal LDL receptor binding region. In fact, ApoB48 is so called because it constitutes 48% of the sequence for ApoB100. ApoB 48 is a unique protein to chylomicrons from the small intestine. After most of the lipids in the chylomicron have been absorbed, ApoB48 returns to the liver as pa of the chylomicron remnant, where it is endocytosed and degraded",

This homolog (originally thought to be, and often spoken of as, a single protein) is crucial in multicellular organisms, where it prevents cancer formation, thus, functions as a tumor suppressor. As such, p53 has been described as \"the guardian of the genome\" because of its role in conserving stability by preventing genome mutation. Hence TP53 is classified as a tumor suppressor gene. (Italics are used to denote the TP53 gene name and distinguish it from the protein it encodes.) The name p53 was given in 1979 describing the apparent molecular mass; SDS-PAGE analysis indicates that it is a 53-kilodalton (kDa) protein. However, the actual mass of the full-length p53 protein (p53a) based on the sum of masses of the amino acid residues is only 43.7 kDa. This difference is due to the high number of proline residues in the protein, which slow its migration on SDS-PAGE, thus making it appear heavier than it actually is. In addition to the full-length protein, the human TP53 gene encodes at least 15 protein isoforms, ranging in size from 3.5 to 43.7 kDa. All these p53 proteins are called the p53 isoforms. The TP53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene (>50%) in human cancer, indicating that the TP53 gene plays a crucial role in preventing cancer formation. TP53 gene encodes proteins that bind to DNA and regulate gene expression to prevent mutations in the genome",

The entire process is called gene expression. In translation, messenger RNA (mRNA) is decoded in the ribosome decoding center to produce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide. The polypeptide later foldsinto an active protein and performs its functions in the cell. The ribosomefacilitates decoding by inducing the binding of complementary tRNA anticodonsequences to mRNA codons. The tRNAs carry specific amino acids that are chained together into a polypeptide as the mRNA passes through and is read by the ribosome. Translation proceeds in three phases: Initiation: The ribosome assembles around the target mRNA. The first tRNA is attached at the sta codon. Elongation: The tRNA transfers an amino acid to the tRNA corresponding to the next codon. The ribosome then moves (translocates) to the next mRNA codon to continue the process, creating an amino acid chain. Termination: When a peptidyl tRNA encounters a stop codon, then the ribosome folds the polypeptide into its final structure. Ref satyanarayana 4e",

        "question": "Urea is formed from which substrate?",
        "exp": "A. Steps of Urea Cycle: 1. Formation of Carbamoyl Phosphate: Condensation of ammonium ion with bicarbonate ion resulting in the formation of carbamoyl phosphate by the help of the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthase-I present in the liver mitochondria. It requires Mg2+ and a dicarboxylic acid i.e. N-acetyl glutamate. This step requires 2 ATPs. 2. Synthesis of Citrulline: Carbamoyl phosphate formed in the first step combines with ornithine resulting in the synthesis of citrulline aided by the enzyme citrulline synthase or ornithine transcarbamoylase. Citrulline is easily permeable to the mitochondrial membrane and hence it diffuses into the cytosol. 3. Synthesis of Argininosuccinate: In the cytosol, citrulline combines with the amino acid aspaate forming argininosuccinate catalysed by the enzyme argininosuccinate synthase. It requires ATP which is hydrolysed to AMP resulting in utilization of two high energy bonds. Mg2+ acts as cofactor. 4. Cleavage of Argininosuccinate: The enzyme argininosuccinase acts reversibly to cleave argininosuccinate into Arginine and fumarate. Fumarate enters the TCA cycle (the linkage between TCA and urea cycle is known as Krebs bi-cycle). 5. Cleavage of Arginine: Arginine is lysed into ornithine and urea under the influence of the enzyme arginase. Hence arginine is known as semi-essential amino acid i.e. though it is synthesized in the body it is not available for protein synthesis. Ornithine is regenerated in this step and the urea cycle completes by the formation of urea. Ornithine and lysine are potent inhibitors of the enzyme arginase. Arginase is also present in testis, renal tubules, mammary gland and skin in minute quantities. The intermediate amino acids formed in the urea cycle i.e. ornithine, citrulline and argininosuccinate are known as non-protein amino acids. Ref-Sathyanarayana 4/e p370",

The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can sta at any age. The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 8% of cases sta before the age of 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson&;s disease. People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems. HD is typically inherited from a person&;s parents, with 10% of cases due to a new mutation. The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either of an individual&;s two copies of a gene called Huntingtin. This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called \"huntingtin\". Expansion of CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the Huntingtin protein results in an abnormal protein, which gradually damages cells in the brain, through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Diagnosis is by genetic testing, which can occur at any point in time, regardless of whether or not symptoms are present. This fact raises several ethical debates: the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing; whether parents have the right to have their children tested; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results.Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington&;s_disease",

Pa of the molecule resembles the 3&; end of the aminoacylated tRNA. It enters the A site and transfers to the growing chain, causing the formation of a puromycylated nascent chain and premature chain release. The exact mechanism of action is unknown at this time but the 3&; position contains an amide linkage instead of the normal ester linkage of tRNA. That makes the molecule much more resistant to hydrolysis and stops the ribosome.Puromycin is selective for either prokaryotes or eukaryotes.Also of note, puromycin is critical in mRNA display. In this reaction, a puromycin molecule is chemically attached to the end of an mRNA template, which is then translated into protein. The puromycin can then form a covalent link to the growing peptide chain allowing the mRNA to be physically linked to its translational product.Antibodies that recognize puromycylated nascent chains can also be used to purify newly synthesized polypeptides and to visualize the distribution of actively translating ribosomes by immunofluorescence.Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puromycin",
