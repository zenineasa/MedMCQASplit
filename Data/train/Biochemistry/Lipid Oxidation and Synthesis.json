Transfer of activated long chain FFA into mitochondria o Activated long chain fatty acid (acyl CoA) cannot penetrate inner mitochondrial membrane. o Acyl group of acyl CoA is transferred to carnitine, resulting in formation of acylcarnitine. o Acylcarnitine is then transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix by translocase. o Once inside the mitochondrion, acyl group of acylcarnitine is transferred back to CoA, resulting in formation of acvl-CoA which undergoes b-oxidation.",
