        "exp": "Ans. (b) Zinc deficiency. Ref. Harrison's 19th ed. / 96e-9* Zinc is an essential trace nutrient required for the proper function of more than 100 enzymes and plays a crucial role in nucleic acid metabolism.* Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive disorder postulated to occur as a result of mutations in the SLC39. A4 gene located on band 8q24. 3.* This protein is highly expressed in the enterocytes in the duodenum and jejunum. Therefore, affected individuals have a decreased ability to absorb zinc from dietary sources. Absence of a binding ligand needed to transport zinc may further contribute to zinc malabsorption.* Clinical manifestations include diarrhea, alopecia, muscle wasting, depression, irritability, and a rash involving the extremities, face, and perineum. The rash is characterized by vesicular and pustular crusting with scaling and erythema.* Features of acrodermatitis enteropathica start appearing in the first few months of life, if mother discontinues breast milk.
