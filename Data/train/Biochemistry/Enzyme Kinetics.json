It is usually expressed as m mole of substrate disappeared or p mole of product formed per minute. 2) Specific activity:-# It refers to the number of enzyme units per milligram of protein. It is a measure of enzyme purity; higher the enzyme purity, more is the specific activity. 3) Ttirn over number# This refers to the number of substrate molecules transformed per unit time by a single enzyme molecule (or by a single catalytic site), when the enzyme concentration alone is rate-limiting factor.# Catalase has the highest turnover number and hence is the fastest active enzyme. Carbonic anydrase has the 2nd fastest turnover number; therefore, it is 2nd fastest active enzyme (after catalase). Lysozyme has the lowest turnover number and therefore is slowest acting.",

If, in a separate experiment, one-third as much enzyme and twice as much of the substrate is combined, how long it would to take for the same amount (12 mmol) of product to be formed?",
        "exp": "Since we know that Enzyme is more impoant than substrate, so enzyme concentration we have to see first if that is reduced then it doesn't matter whether we increase substrate concentration or not time will increase only. So, since enzyme is decreased to 1/3 time will increase by 3 times irrespective of increase in substrate concentration By using Michaelis-Menten equation, that is, V0 = Vmax x / Km + and by definition Vmax = Kcat x Where is enzyme concentration, Kcat is turnover number So, Similarly, As velocity is 3 times slower than first velocity so same amount of product formation will require 3x more time.
