        "exp": "Shifting the O2 dissociation curve to right means decreasing the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin as shown in graph. *2,3 BPG is produced as a result of Rappapo Leubering cycle (RL shunt) as shown in this figure. *This molecule decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. Hence it will shift the O2 dissociation curve to the right. Extra Edge Other factors which will also shift the curve to right are: *Increased temperature *increased Carbon dioxide (CO2) *Low pH",
