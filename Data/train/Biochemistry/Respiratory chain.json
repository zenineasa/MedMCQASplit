        "question": "Which of the following is not a component of transpo system?",
        "exp": "Functions: Transpo Systems An essential role of biomembranes is to allow movement of all compounds necessary for the normal function of a cell across the membrane barrier. These compounds include a vast array of substances like sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, steroids, cations and anions to mention a few. These compounds must enter or leave the cells in an orderly manner for normal functioning of the cell. A. 1. Ion Channels Ion channels are transmembrane channels, pore-like structures composed of proteins. Specific channels for Na+, K+, Ca++, and Cl- have been identified. Cation conductive channels are negatively charged within the channel and have an average diameter of about 5 to 8 nm. All ion channels are basically made up of transmembrane subunits that come together to form a central pore through which ions pass selectively. All channels have gates and are controlled by opening and closing. Types of Gates Two types of gated channels. They are a. Ligand-gated channels: In this, a specific molecule binds to a receptor and opens the channel. Example: Acetylcholine receptor is present in the postsynaptic membrane. It is a complex of five subunits, having a binding site for acetylcholine. Acetylcholine released from the presynaptic region binds with the binding site of the postsynaptic region, which triggers the opening of the channel and influx of Na+. b. Voltage-gated channels: These channels open or close in response to changes in membrane potential. Some propeies of ion channels * Composed of transmembrane protein subunits. * Highly selective. * Well regulated by the presence of \"gates\". * Two main types of gates: Ligand-gated and voltage-gated. * Activities are affected by ceain drugs. * Mutations of genes encoding transmembrane proteins can cause specific diseases. 2. Ionophores Ceain microorganisms can synthesize small organic molecules, called ionophores, which function as shuttles for the movement of ions across the membrane. Structure: These ionophores contain hydrophilic centres that bind specific ions and are surrounded by peripheral hydrophobic regions. Types: Two types: (a) Mobile ion carriers: Like valinomycin (Refer uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation). (b) Channel formers: Like gramicidin. 3. Water Channels (Aquaporins) In ceain cells, e. g. in red blood cells, and cells of the collecting ductules of the kidney, the movement of water by simple diffusion is enhanced by movements of water through water channels, composed of tetrameric transmembrane proteins called aquaporins. About five distinct types of aquaporins have been recognised. CLINICAL ASPECT Recently mutations in the gene encoding AP-2 (Aquaporin 2) protein, have been shown to be the cause of one type of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. 4. Gap Junction Ceain cells develop specialized regions on their membranes for intercellular communications which are in close proximity. Function: They mediate and regulate the passage of ions and small molecules upto 1000 to 2000 mol wt, through a narrow hydrophilic core connecting the cytosol of adjacent cells. Structure: They are primarily composed of protein, called connexon which contains four membrane-spanning a-helices. the mitochondrial membrane also has paicularly energy coupling mechanism.

Inhibitors of electron transport chain-o Inhibitors of respiratory chain may be divided into three groups: -Inhibitors of electron transport chain proper. These inhibitors inhibit the flow of electrons through the respiratory chain. This occurs at following sites. Complex I (NADH to CoQ) is inhibited by: - Barbiturates (amobarbital), Piericidin A (an antibiotic), rotenone (an insectiside), chlorpromazine (a tranquilizer), and guanethidine (an antihypertensive). These inhibitors block the transfer of reducing equivalents from FeS protein to CoQ. Complex II is inhibited by: - Carboxin and TTFA inhibit transfer of electon from FADH2 to CoQ, whereas malanate competitively inhibit from succinate to complex II. Complex III (Cytochrome b to cytochrome Cl) is inhibited by: - Dimercaprol, antimycin A, BAL (British anti lewisite), Naphthyloquinone. These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome b to cytochrome C i. Complex IV (cytochrome C oxidase) is inhibited by: - Carbon monoxide, CN-, ITS and azide (N3). These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome aa3 to molecular oxygen and therefore can totally arrest cellular respiration. Inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation. These compounds directly inhibit phosphorylation of ADP to. ATP. Oligomycin inhibits Fo component of F0. F1 ATPase. Atractiloside inhibits translocase, a transport protein that transports ADP into mitochondria for phosphorylation into ATP. Uncouples.

Thus P: O ratio is a measure of how many moles of ATP are formed from ADP by phosphorylation per gram atom of oxygen used. This is measured as the number of moles of ADP (or Pi) that disappear per gram atom of oxygen used. Phosphate group esterified P: O ratio = ___________________________________ Electron pairs transferred P: O ratio x 7. 3 Efficiency = ______________________ x 100 51 K.

This is achieved by removal of the proton gradient. (Table 19. 5; Fig. 19. 17). The uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is useful biologically. In hibernating animals and in newborn human infants, the liberation of heat energy is required to maintain body temperature. In Brown adipose tissue, thermogenesis is achieved by this process. Thermogenin, a protein present in the inner mitochondrial membrane of adipocytes, provides an alternate pathway for protons. It is one of the uncoupling proteins (UCP).

Breakdow n of these compound is an anaerobic processes. Little longer intense exercise (e. g., 200 meter sprint or 100 meter swim). Besides ATP and creatine phosphate, glycogen is metabolised by anerobic glycolytic pathways to provide a ready source of energy. So, muscle work is anaerobic. Longer duration exercise (e. g., jogging, marathon run): - The muscle work is aerobic and energy comes from aerobic utilization of glucose and free fatty acids.

This energy is coupled to the formation of ATP molecules by phosphorylation of ADP by an enzyme F0. F1, ATPase. The phosphorylation of ADP into ATP is coupled with oxidation of reducing equivalents, therefore the process is called oxidative phosphorylation, o There are three ATP synthesizing sites of electron transport chain: (i) Site I is between NAD and CoQ. i. e., Complex I; (ii) Site II is between CoQ and cytochrome C, i. e., Complex III; and (iii) Site III is between cytochrome C and oxygen, i. e., complex IV. These sites provide energy required to make ATP from ADP by an enzyme F0. F1 ATPase. o The energy liberated of site I (complex I) is used to synthesize 1 ATP molecule, at site II (complex III) is used to synthesize 1 ATP molecule and at site III (Complex IV) is used to synthesize Vi ATP molecule.

Points to Remember * It is a cyclic process. * The cycle involves a sequence of compounds interrelated by oxidation-reduction and other reactions which finally produces CO2 and H2O. * It is the final common pathway of break down/catabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. (Phase III of metabolism). * Acetyl-CoA derived mainly from the oxidation of either glucose or b-oxidation of FA and paly from ceain amino acids combines with oxaloacetic acid (OAA) to form citrate the first reaction of citric acid cycle. In this reaction acetyl-CoA transfers its 'acetyl-group' (2-C) to OAA. * By stepwise dehydrogenations and loss of two molecules of CO2, accompanied by internal re-arrangements, the citric acid is reconveed to OAA, which again stas the cycle by taking up another acetyl group from acetyl-CoA. * A very small catalytic amount of OAA can bring about the complete oxidation of active-acetate. * Enzymes are located in the mitochondrial matrix, either free or attached to the inner surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which facilitates the transfer of reducing equivalents to the adjacent enzymes of the respiratory chain. * The whole process is aerobic, requiring O2 as the final oxidant of the reducing equivalents. Absence of O2 (anoxia) or paial deficiency of O2 (hypoxia) causes total or paial inhibition of the cycle. * The H atoms removed in the successive dehydrogenations are accepted by corresponding coenzymes. Reduced coenzymes transfer the reducing equivalents to the electron-transpo system, where oxidative phosphorylation produces ATP molecules.

        "exp": "Why body stores glucose as glycogen and not as glucose itself? Possible Reasons 1. Being insoluble it exes no osmotic pressure, and so does not disturb the intracellular fluid content and does not diffuse from its storage sites. 2. It has a higher energy level than a corresponding weight of glucose (though energy has to be expended to make it from glucose). 3. It is readily broken down under the influence of hormones and enzyme: * Into glucose in liver (to maintain blood glucose level). * Into lower intermediates in skeletal muscle and other tissues for energy. Role of Liver Glycogen * It is the only immediately available reserve store of blood glucose. * A high liver glycogen level protects the liver cells against the harmful effects of many poisons and chemicals, e. g. CCl4, ethyl alcohol, arsenic, various bacterial toxins. * Ceain forms of detoxication, e. g. conjugation with glucuronic acid; and acetylation reactions, are directly influenced by the liver glycogen level. * The rate of deamination of amino acids in the liver is depressed as the glycogen level rises so that amino acids are preserved longer in that form and so remain available for protein synthesis in the tissues. * Similarly, a high level of liver glycogen depresses the rate of ketone bodies formation. Biomedical Impoance * Liver glycogen is largely concerned with storage and supply of glucose-1-P, which is conveed to glucose, for maintenance of blood glucose, paicularly in between meals. * Muscle glycogen on the other hand, is to act as readily available source of intermediates of glycolysis for provision of energy within the muscle itself. Muscle glycogen cannot directly contribute to blood glucose level. * Inherited deficiency of enzymes in the pathway of glycogen metabolism produces ceain inherited disorders called as Glycogen storage diseases (GSD).

Coenzyme Q and cytochrome C are not parts of any complex and are not fixed in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The other components are fixed in the membrane. These components are arranged in order of increasing redox potential. Therefore, reducing equivalents (electrons) flow in one direction, I - II - III - IV, only because redox couple with low redox potential is better electron donor where as the one with high redox potential is electron acceptor. Thus, reducing equivalents (electrons) flow through the chain from the components of more negative redox potential to the components of more positive redox potential.

Since hydrolysis of ATP to ADP + Pi releases around 7. 3 K. Cal/mole, the formation ATP from ADP + Pi requires a minimum of around 8 KCal/mole. The formation of ATP is therefore not possible at the sites where the free energy released is less than 8 KCal/mole.

This ubiquitous molecule is the energy storehouse of the body. High energy compoundso The energy released during oxidation of monosaccharides, fatty acids and amino acids may not be required immediately. Therefore, there must be some way of storing energy.

        "exp": "Rotenone is a site-specific inhibitor of electron transpo. it acts at the level of complex I. Malate feeds electrons to reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), which in turn is passed into the electron transpo system at the level of complex I, through NADH dehydrogenase just before the blockage induced by this drug. Therefore, no electrons can be transpoed from NADH and no adenosine triphosphates (ATPs) are made. Succinate feeds in electrons from the reduced form of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) at the level of complex II, through the action of succinyl dehydrogenase. Complex II passes its electrons to coenzyme Q at a point beyond the site of rotenone inhibition; therefore, rotenone has no inhibitory effect and 2 ATPs are produced per atom of oxygen consumed. (The number of ATPs produced per atom of oxygen used is often expressed as the number of phosphate ions taken up divided by the atoms of oxygen used. This is called the P/O ratio.) in the absence of any inhibitor, the P/O ratio for malate is 3 and for succinate 2. Actinomycin D is an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, not oxidative phosphorylation.

Inhibitors of electron transport chain-o Inhibitors of respiratory chain may be divided into three groups: -Inhibitors of electron transport chain proper. These inhibitors inhibit the flow of electrons through the respiratory chain. This occurs at following sites. Complex I (NADH to CoQ) is inhibited by: - Barbiturates (amobarbital), Piericidin A (an antibiotic), rotenone (an insectiside), chlorpromazine (a tranquilizer), and guanethidine (an antihypertensive). These inhibitors block the transfer of reducing equivalents from FeS protein to CoQ. Complex II is inhibited by: - Carboxin and TTFA inhibit transfer of electon from FADH2 to CoQ, whereas malanate competitively inhibit from succinate to complex II. Complex III (Cytochrome b to cytochrome Cl) is inhibited by: - Dimercaprol, antimycin A, BAL (British anti lewisite), Naphthyloquinone. These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome b to cytochrome C i. Complex IV (cytochrome C oxidase) is inhibited by: - Carbon monoxide, CN-, ITS and azide (N3).

        "exp": "Current Concept, Energetics of ATP Synthesis The free energy released by electron transpo through complex I to IV must be conserved in a form that ATP synthase can perform energy coupling. The energy of electron transfer is used to drive protons out of the matrix by the complexes I, III and IV that are proton pumps. The proton gradient thus created is maintained across the inner mitochondrial membrane till electrons are transferred to oxygen to form water. The electrochemical potential of this gradient is used to synthesize ATP. According to the estimated free energy of synthesis, it was presumed that around 3 protons are required per ATP synthesized. Hence when one NADH transfers its electrons to oxygen, 10 protons are pumped out. This would account for the synthesis of approximately 3 ATP. Similarly the Fig. 19. 12. Complex IV (cytochrome oxidase) of respiratory chain pumping of 6 protons, accounting for 2 molecules of ATP. However, Peter Hinkle recently proved that the actual energy production is less, because there is always leakage of protons. This results in harnessing of energy required for the production of 2. 5 ATP from NADH and 1. 5 ATP from FADH2. The synthesis of one ATP molecule is driven by the flow of 3 protons through the ATP synthase (see below). When NADH is oxidized, 10 hydrogen ions (protons) are pumped out (Fig. 19. 13). According to recent findings, one NADH may generate only 2. 5 ATP; and one FADH2 may generate only 1. 5 ATP. So, one molecule of glucose will generate only 32 ATPs. The traditional values and the new values are compared in Table 19. 4. (Please note that there is no change in the values of ATP generation by substrate-level phosphorylation). Energy efficiency of glucose oxidation giving 32 molecules of ATP and palmitate giving 106 molecules of ATP is given as 34% and 33% respectively.

        "question": "Immediate source of energy is",
        "exp": "In the living cell, the principal high-energy intermediate or carrier compound is adenosine triphosphate (ATP) The impoance of phosphates in intermediary metabolism became evident with the discovery of the role of ATP, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and inorganic phosphate (Pi) in glycolysis. ATP plays a central role in the transference of free energy from the exergonic to the endergonic processes. The intermediate position of ATP allows it to play an impoant role in energy transfer. The high free-energy change on hydrolysis of ATP is due to relief of charge repulsion of adjacent negatively charged oxygen atoms and to stabilization of the reaction products, especially phosphate, as resonance hybrids. ATP is able to act as a donor of high-energy phosphate to form those compounds below it in Table 11-1. Likewise, with the necessary enzymes, ADP can accept high-energy phosphate to form ATP from those compounds above ATP in the table. In effect, an ATP/ADP cycle connects those processes that generate to those processes that utilize, continuously consuming and regenerating ATP. This occurs at a very rapid rate since the total ATP/ADP pool is extremely small and sufficient to maintain an active tissue for only a few seconds.

They extend pseudopodia and surround the paicles to form phagosomes which later fuse with lysosomes to form Phagolysosomes in which the paicles are digested. Biochemical mechanism is called respiratory burst, in which O2 consumption is increased and lead to formation of superoxide ion O2-. Superoxide anion O2- is conveed to H2.

O2 + O2 The electron transpo chain system responsible for the \"respiratory burst\" is \"NADPH oxidase\". In resting phagocyte it is in an inactive form, consisting of cytochrome b 558 + two polypeptides (heterodimer). The NADPH oxidase system is activated by recruitment in plasma membrane by two more cytoplasmic polypeptides. Thus: 2 Cytoplasmic polypeptides Cytb558 + 2 Polypeptides _______________________ Cytb588 (Inactive NADPH oxidase) + 4 Polypeptides (Active NADPH oxidase) NADPH oxidase is activated upon contact with various ligands like complement fragment C5a, chemotactic peptides, etc. Events resulting in activation of the NADPH oxidase system involve G proteins, activation of phospholipase C and generation of inositol-1, 4, 5-triphosphate (P3). The P3 mediates a transient increase in the level of cytosolic Ca++, which is essential for the induction of the respiratory burst. Killing of bacteria within phagolysosomes appears to depend on the combined action of elevated pH, superoxide ions or other \"free radicals\" like H2. O2, OH*, and HOCl (hypochlorous acid) and on the action of ceain bactericidal peptides, called defensins and other proteins, e. g. cathepsin G and ceain cationic proteins present in phagocytic cells.

In such a process, a macrophage may internalize 3 percent of its plasma membrane each minute or the entire membrane every 1/2 hour.

When the starting molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2. 5 ATPs and therefore, 12. 5 ATPs are produced when starting compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle. o Note: Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from starting. n. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2. 5 ATPs and FADH produces 1. 5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs. o Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per molecule of glucose when it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows Pathway Step Enzyme Source Method of ATPformation No of ATPs gained pergiucose (new calculation) No of ATPs As per old calculation Glycolysis 1 Hexokinase - Minus 1 Minus 1 Do 3 Phosphofructokinase - Minus 1 Minus 1 Do 5 Glyceraldehyde-3-p DH NADH Respiratory chain 2. 5 x 2 = 5 3*2= 6 Do 6 1, 3-BPG kinase ATP Substrate level 1x2 = 2 1 *2= 2 Do 9 Pyruvate kinase ATP Substrate level 1 x2 = 2 1 *2= 2 Pyruvate to - Pyruvate NADH Respiratory chain 2. 5x 2 = 5 3*2= 6 Acetyl CoA Dehydrogenase TCA cycle 3 Isocitrate DH NADH Respiratory chain 2. 5x2 = 5 3*2= 6 Do 4 Alpha keto glutarate DH NADH Respiratory chain 2. 5x2 = 5 3*2= 6 Do 5 Succinate thiokinase GTP Substrate level l x2 = 2 1 *2= 2 Do 6 Succicinate DHFADH2 Respiratory chain 1. 5x2 = 3 2*2= 4 Do 8 Malate DH NADH Respiratory chain 2. 5x2 = 5 3*2= 6 Net generation in glycolytic pathway Generation in pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction Generation in citric acid cycle Net generation of ATP from one glucose mole 9 minus 2 = 7 10 minus 2= 8 = 5 = 6 = 20 = 24 = 32 38",

Therefore, there must be some way of storing energy. The energy released during catabolism is captured in the form of a group of compounds known as uhigh-energy phosphates \". The most important member of this groupis ATP. o A compound that liberates 7 Kcal/mol or more on hydrolysis is called high energy compound, or a compound that on hydrolysis undergoes a large (> 7 kcal/molj decrease in free energy (DG) under standard condition is called high energy compound, i. e., DG >- 7 Kcal/mol.

        "exp": "Phagocytosis: Phagocytosis (Greek word-Phagein-to eat) is the engulfment of large paicles like viruses, bacteria, cells, or debris by macrophages and granulocytes. They extend pseudopodia and surround the paicles to form phagosomes which later fuse with lysosomes to form Phagolysosomes in which the paicles are digested. Biochemical mechanism is called respiratory burst, in which O2 consumption is increased and lead to formation of superoxide ion O2-. Superoxide anion O2- is conveed to H2. O2 and other free radicals OH* and OCl-, etc. which are potent microbial agent. O2- + O2- + 2H+ - H2. O2 + O2 The electron transpo chain system responsible for the \"respiratory burst\" is \"NADPH oxidase\". In resting phagocyte it is in an inactive form, consisting of cytochrome b 558 + two polypeptides (heterodimer). The NADPH oxidase system is activated by recruitment in plasma membrane by two more cytoplasmic polypeptides. Thus: 2 Cytoplasmic polypeptides Cytb558 + 2 Polypeptides _______________________ Cytb588 (Inactive NADPH oxidase) + 4 Polypeptides (Active NADPH oxidase) NADPH oxidase is activated upon contact with various ligands like complement fragment C5a, chemotactic peptides, etc. Events resulting in activation of the NADPH oxidase system involve G proteins, activation of phospholipase C and generation of inositol-1, 4, 5-triphosphate (P3). The P3 mediates a transient increase in the level of cytosolic Ca++, which is essential for the induction of the respiratory burst. Killing of bacteria within phagolysosomes appears to depend on the combined action of elevated pH, superoxide ions or other \"free radicals\" like H2. O2, OH*, and HOCl (hypochlorous acid) and on the action of ceain bactericidal peptides, called defensins and other proteins, e. g. cathepsin G and ceain cationic proteins present in phagocytic cells. Macrophages are extremely active and may ingest 25 percent of their volume per hour. In such a process, a macrophage may internalize 3 percent of its plasma membrane each minute or the entire membrane every 1/2 hour. CLINICAL ASPECT Chronic granulomatous disease has been recently implicated due to defective phagocytosis and respiratory burst. The disease is characterized by * Recurrent infections * Widespread granuloma formation in various tissues like lungs, lymph nodes, skin, etc. Fig. 2. 11: Sequence of events that occur in chronic granulomatous disease Defect: The disorder is attributed to mutations in the genes encoding the four polypeptides that constitute the active NADPH oxidase system. The granulomas are formed as attempts to wall off bacteria that have not been killed due to genetic deficiencies in the NADPH oxidase system.

Energy rich molecules like glucose are ultimately metabolized to CO2 and water. The metabolic intermediates of these oxidation reactions donate electrons to NAD/FAD to form energy rich coenzymes NADH/FADH2. These energy rich reduced coenzymes, in turn, donate electrons to a specialized series of electron carriers/donors arranged aft redox potential (EQ)- collectively called ETC. ETC is present in inner mitochondrial membrane and is the final common pathway in aerobic cells by which electrons obtained from different fuels of body flow to oxygen. This requirement of O2 makes the ETC the respiratory chain, which accounts for the greatest portion of body's use for oxygen. Electrons flow through the ETC through a redox span of 1. 1 volts from NAD+/NADH to O2/H2. OThe components of respiratory chain contain 4 large protein complexes (initial 2 are flavoproteins and last 2 are cytochromes) and 2 mobile electron carriers-coenzyme Q and cytochrome C. The chain reaction of e-transport starts with formation of NADH (by various substrate dehydrogenases removing hydrogen atom as in TCA cycle-isocitrate/a-ketoglutamte/malate-dehydrogenase). Transfer of hydride ion (: H-, bearing 2 electrons) and a free proton (H-) to NAD+ 1/t formation of NADH (having 2 e-) plus a free proton (H+). Component of ETCProsthetic Group/Etectron flow. Features. Complex 1: NADH dehydrogenase/ NADH-Ubiquinone (CoQ) oxidoreductase/NADH-CoQ reductase. FMN, non heme iron sulfur proteins (FeS)* It is a large L shaped 42 subunit protein which accepts 2e- and 1 H+ from NADH and transfer it to CoQ* 12 Kcal/mol of released energy is utilized to pump 4 protons (H+)Q out of mitochondria into inter membranous space. NADH - FMN | Fes | CoQ Complex II: Succinate dehydrogenase/ Succinate -Q- Reductase. FAD, FeS * It is a small 4 subunit protein which accepts e- from succinate and transfer it to CoQ.* It is not a proton pump as energy liberated is not enough to pump protons. Succinate - FAD | Fes | CoQ * It also contain heme b that is not in direct path of e- transfer but serve to reduce the frequency with which e- leak out of system, moving from succinate to molecular O2 to produce reactive oxygen species. Coenzyme Q (CoQ)/ Ubiquinone/Q* This only non-protein member of ETC is a lipid soluble benzoquinone with long hydrophobic isoprenoid tail (side chain).* It is called ubiquinone as it is ubiquitous (present everywhere) quinone derivative Menaquinone (of bacteria) and plastoquinine (of chloroplast) have analogous roles* It can accept 1 or 2 electrons to become semiquinone or ubiquinol respectively. So it can act at the junction of 2e- donor and 1e- acceptor (Q cycle).* Because it is small and hydrophobic, Q is a mobile carrier freely diffusible within the lipid bilayer of inner mitochondrial membrane and can shuttle b/w other less mobile e- carriers.* It has a central role in coupling e- flow to proton (H+) movement as it carries both e- and H+.* For transferring to complex III it accepts hydrogen atom (e- and H+) from.* FMNH2 produced in complex I (from FMN)* FADH2 produced in complex II* FADH2 produced in b-oxidation by acyl CoA dehydrogenase (through ETF-ubiquinone- oxidoreductase) and by glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase. These bypass complex II and I. Complex III: Cytochrome b. C1 complex/ Ubiquinone cytochrome C oxido-reductase/ Cytochrome reductase. Fe-S, Heme group (a porphyrin ring and iron, which is reversibly converted from Fe3+ to Fe2+ form)* It transfers electron from CoQ to cytochrome C. - 10 Kcal/mol of released energy is utilized to pump 4 protonsQ out of mitochondria into inter membranous space.* Q cycle couples e- and H+ transport in complex III and involves cytochrome b1, bH (b562, b566), cytochrome C1 and Rieske Fe - S (an unusual iron sulfur protein in which one of the iron atom is linked to 2 histidine -SH rather than 2 cysteine- SH groups), oxidation of QH2 (ubiquinol) to Q (ubiquinone) is coupled to reduction of 2 molecules of cytochrome via cytochrome CQ - Cyt b | Cyt C1 | CytC Cytochrome c* Soluble carrier protein of intermembrane space* After its single heme group accepts an electron from complex III, cytochrome c moves to complex IV to donate electron to a binuclear copper centre. Complex IV Cytochromec oxidase/cytochromeoxidase2 Heme groups (of cyt a, a3), 2 copper ions of CuA, CuB* It transfers electrons from cytochrome C to the final acceptor O2 converting (reducing) it to water (H2O).* O2 remains tightly bound to complex IV (a3) until it is fully reduced to H2O, this minimizes the release of ROS.* It pumps 2 proton (H+) out into inter membrane space for every pair of electron passing down the chain by complex IVCyt C - CuA | Cyta | Cyt a3 | CuB | O2",

TPP binds with and decarboxylates this branched-chain a-ketoacids and transfers the resulting activated -CHO groups to alipoic acid. * TPP acts as the coenzyme (Co-carboxylase) of pyruvate carboxylase in yeasts for the non-oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetaldehyde. * The coenzymes NAD+ and NADP+ operate as hydrogen and electron transfer agents by viue of reversible oxidation and reduction. The mechanism of the transfer of Hydrogen from a metabolite to oxidised NAD+, thus completing the oxidation of the metabolite and the formation of reduced NAD (NADH + H+) is shown in box.

        "exp": "Ans. D. State 4a. Respiratory Control Ensures a Constant Supply of ATP. THE rate of respiration of mitochondria can be controlled by the availability of ADP. This is because oxidation and phosphorylation are tightly coupled, ie, oxidation cannot proceed via the respiratory chain without concomitant phosphorylation of ADP. b. Table shows the five conditions controlling the rate of respiration in mitochondria. Most cells in the resting state are in state 4, and respiration is controlled by the availability of ADP. When work is performed, ATP is converted to ADP, allowing more respiration to occur, which in turn replenishes the store of ATP. Under certain conditions, the concentration of inorganic phosphate can also affect the rate of functioning of the respiratory chain, c. As respiration increases (as in exercise), the cell approaches state 3 or state 5 when either the capacity of the respiratory chain becomes saturated or the PO2 decreases below the Km for heme a3 - There is also the possibility that the ADP/ATP transporter, which facilitates entry of cytosolic ADP into and ATP out of the mitochondrion, becomes rate-limiting. States of Respiratory Control. Conditions Limiting the Rate of Respiration. State 1. Availability of ADP and substrate. State 2. Availability of substrate only. State 3. The capacity of the respiratory chain itself, when all substrates and components are present in saturating amounts. State 4. Availability of ADP only. State 5. Availability of oxygen only. Thus, the manner in which biologic oxidative processes allow the free energy resulting from the oxidation of foodstuffs to become available and to be captured is stepwise, efficient, and controlled--rather than explosive, inefficient, and uncontrolled, as in many non-biologic processes. The remaining free energy that is not captured as high-energy phosphate is liberated as heat. This need not be considered \"wasted, \" since it ensures that the respiratory system as a whole is sufficiently exergonic to be removed from equilibrium, allowing continuous unidirectional flow and constant provision of ATP. It also contributes to maintenance of body temperature.",

The system also acts as a proton pump. It is believed that 4 (four) protons are pumped across the mitochondrial membrane during the oxidation. The energy change permits ATP formation (Site II).

Rieske FeS is an unusual FeS in which one of the Fe atoms is linked to two histidine -SH groups rather than two cysteine -SH groups and is called as the Q cycle. Q may exist in three forms: * Oxidised quinone, * Reduced quinol, or * Semiquinone. The semiquinone is formed transiently during the cycle, one turn of which results in the oxidation of 2Q.

Each oxidizing or reducing agent exists as a conjugate pair of electron acceptor oxidant and electron donor reductant forms. Where 'n' is the number of electrons. The pair consisting of the oxidant and reductant forms of an oxidizing or reducing agent is known as a redox couple or conjugate redox pair, e. g. NAD+/NADH, FMN/FMNH2, Cyt-c Fe++/Cyt-c Fe+++. Oxidising agents differ in their electron affinity. The standard redox potential Eo is a measure of the tendency of a redox couple to donate or accept electrons under standard conditions. The redox potential of a given system is intimately related to its free energy change. If redox-potential of a given system is known, the corresponding free energy change which might occur in the system on oxidation or reduction may be found as follows: DF= -nf.

T state reves to O state when ATP is released. 4. L state is regenerated for fuher ADP binding. For the complete rotation of F1 head through the 3 states, 10 protons are translocated. Protons entering the system, cause conformational changes in the F1 paicle. Initially the ADP and Pi are loosely bound to the catalytic site on F1. As the Fo accepts protons, the affinity for ADP is increased (step 1, Fig. 19. 16). Fuher conformational change induces catalytic activity, and ATP is synthesized (step 2, Fig. 19. 16). This moves protons to the matrix side. As the ATPs are released, the original conformation of the enzyme is assumed (step 3, Fig. 19. 16). Then ADP is again bound and the cycle repeats (step 4, Fig. 19. 16). The energy surplus produced by the proton gradient is stored as chemical energy in ATP. The energy-requiring step is not at the synthesis of ATP, but energy is required for the conformational changes. Regulation of ATP Synthesis The availability of ADP regulates the process. When ATP level is low and ADP level is high, oxidative phosphorylation proceeds at a rapid rate. This is called respiratory control or acceptor control. The major source of NADH and FADH2 is the citric acid cycle, the rate of which is regulated by the energy charge of the cell.

Substrate-level phosphorylation is a type of metabolism that results in the formation and creation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or guanosine triphosphate (GTP) by the direct transfer and donation of a phosphoryi (POa) group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or guanosine diphosphate (GDP) from a phosphorylated reactive intermediate. Note that the phosphate group does not have to directly come from the substrate. By convention, the phosphoryl group that is transferred is referred to as a phosphate group. We use the term substrate level phosphorylation because ATP formation in glycolysis is powered by the addition/ removal of phosphate groups (phosphorylation) to molecules of glucose (the substrate). Hence the term substrate-level phosphorylation. Examples of substrate level phosphorylation that occurs in glycolysis is: The production of 1st ATP when 1, 3 bisphophoglycerate is converted into 3-phosphoglycerate by the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase.
