In the presence of ATP and coenzyme A, the enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase (thiokinase) catalyzes the conversion of fatty acid (or FFA) to an \"active fatty acid\" or acyl-CoA, using one high-energy phosphate and forming AMP and PPi. The PPi is hydrolyzed by inorganic pyrophosphatase with the loss of a fuher high-energy phosphate, ensuring that the overall reaction goes to completion. Acyl-CoA synthetases are found in the endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, and on the outer membrane of mitochondria.",

So Total ATP from complete oxidation of Palmitic Acid under normal conditions 7 x4 = 28 (beta oxidation) 8x10=80 (kreb cycle + ETC) Total 108 ATP 2 ATP require for fatty acid activation Net ATP =108-2 = 106 But the question asks about if all acetyl-CoA produced from beta oxidation is conveed to acetoacetate instead of undergoing TCA cycle then what will be ATP yield? If the final product is acetoacetate, then it will not be used in kreb cycle so 80 ATP from Kreb cycle will not be formed. Instead the acetaoacetate will form ketone bodies. Hence only beta oxidation ATP will produce 28 ATPs from 7 cycles. So net ATP will be = 28 - 2 = 26 ATP (2 ATP required for activation of fatty acid)",
