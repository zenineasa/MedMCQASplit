These viruses carry their genome in the form of ssRNA molecules. Following infection of a host cell, the viral enzyme, reverse transcriptase, uses the viral RNA as a template for the 5'- 3' synthesis of viral DMA, which then becomes integrated into host chromosomes. Reverse transcriptase activity is also seen with transposons, DNA elements that can move about the genome. In eukaryotes, such elements are transcribed to RNA, the RNA is used as a template for DNA synthesis by a reverse transcriptase encoded by the transposon, and the DNA is randomly inserted into the genome. Reverse transcriptases, then, are RNA-directed DNA polymerases.cDNA libraries: If a gene of interest is expressed at a very high level in a particular tissue, it is likely that the messenger RNA (mRNA) corresponding to that gene is also present at high concentrations in the cell. For example, reticulocyte mRNA is composed largely of molecules encoding the a-globin and b-globin chains of hemoglobin. This mRNA can be used as a template to make a complementary dsDNA (cDNA) molecule using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. The resulting cDNA is thus a double-stranded copy of mRNA. cDNA can be amplified by cloning or by the polymerase chain reaction. It can be used as a probe to locate the gene that coded for the original mRNA (or fragments of the gene) in mixtures containing many unrelated DNA fragments. If the mRNA used as a template is a mixture of many different size species, the resulting cDNA are heterogeneous. These mixtures can be cloned to form a cDNA library. Because cDNA has no interveningsequences, it can be cloned into an expression vector for the synthesis of eukaryotic proteins by bacteria . These special plasmids contain a bacterial promoter for transcription of the cDNA, and a Shine-Dalgamo sequence that allows the bacterial ribosome to initiate translation of the resulting mRNA molecule.",

The mobile complex between helicase and primase has been called a primosome.As the synthesis of an Okazaki fragment is completed and the polymerase is released, a new primer has been synthesized.The same polymerase molecule remains associated with the replication fork and proceeds to synthesize the next Okazaki fragment.",

        "question": "DNA replication and transcription occurs in which direction -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., 51 - 31 Elongation in DNA synthesiso Once the RNA primer has been synthesized at each of the replicating forks, a DNA polymerase III initiates the synthesis of new DNA strand by adding deoxyribonucleotides to the 31 end of RNA primer. Thus, both new strands are synthesized always in 51- 31 direction. Both the DNA strands are synthesized simultaneously, but in opposite direction.o During synthesis of RNA primer and synthesis of DNA strands, the nucleotides are added according to the sequence of base in the template strand, i.e. 'base pairing rule'. For example, an adenine nucleotide would enter at a thymine nucleotide.Elongation in transcriptiono The process of elongation proceeds after the formation of the first phosphodiester bond. After formation of approximately 10 phosphadiester bonds of new RNA, sigma (a) factor dissociates from the core enzyme. RNA polymerase utilize ribnucleotide triphosphate (ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP) for the formation of RNA.o RNA synthesis occurs in 51-3' direction (similar to DNA synthesis), i.e. genetic information is read in 31-51direction on template DNA and complementary base sequence is synthesized in 51-31 direction for RNA strand.o The selection of nucleotide is according to base-pairing rule, (e.g. U opposite to A and G opposite to C)o The process of elongation continues until a termiantion point is reached.",
