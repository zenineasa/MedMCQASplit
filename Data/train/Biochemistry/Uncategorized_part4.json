        "exp": "The DNA methylase offers protection from endonucleolytic attack by the separate restriction enzyme. The descendants of cells that had lost the genes encoding DNA restriction endonucleases appeared unable to modify a sufficient number of recognition sites in their chromosomes to protect them from lethal attack by the remaining restriction enzymes, and consequently died. Hence, the fate of this bacterium which received a gene for for restriction endonuclease will be the same as given above. Restriction endonuclease: Restriction endonucleases cut DNA at specific sites when the bases are not protected (modified, usually, methylation). Bacteria synthesize restriction enzymes as a defense against invading foreign DNAs such as phages and foreign plasmids. Three major types have been recognized. Type I enzymes are single multifunctional proteins of three subunits. Type II enzymes are used most widely for genetic engineering. Type II enzymes have separate endonuclease and methylase proteins. Type III enzymes carry out restriction and modification by two proteins with a shared polypeptide.

Successful treatment of this disorder is still being sought. Febuxostat has been approved for use in the treatment of chronic hyperuricemia. This drug appears to be more effective than allopurinol in preventing acute attacks of gout and reducing the size of the crystal deposits. Ref: Janson L.W., Tischler M.E. (2012). Chapter 4.

A small propoion of membrane carbohydrate is glycolipids, but most is in the form of glycoproteins.These sho carbohydrates, or oligosaccharides, are usually chains of 15 or fewer sugar molecules.

        "exp": "FISH Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) is a method to detect or comfirm gene or chromosome abnormalities. It utilizes fluorescently labeled DNA probes. The sample DNA is first denatured (a process that separates the complimentary strands within the DNA double helix structure) then fluorescently labeled probe of interest is added to the denatured sample mixture and hybridizes with the sample DNA at the target site as it reanneals (or reforms itself) back into a double helix. The probe signal can then be seen through a fluorescent microscope and the sample DNA scored for the presence or absence of the signal. Gene therapy is a technique for correcting defective genes responsible for disease development. inseed into a nonspecific location within the genome to replace a nonfunctional gene. A carrier molecule called a vector is used to deliver the therapeutic gene to the patient's target cells. Currently, the most common vector is a virus that has been genetically altered to carry normal human DNA. Besides virus-mediated gene-delivery systems, there are several nonviral options for gene delivery. The simplest method is the direct introduction of therapeutic DNA into target cells. This approach is limited in its application because it can be used only with ceain tissues and requires large amounts of DNA. Transfection is defined as the process of deliberately introducing nucleic acids into cells. The term is used notably for non-viral methods \"Transduction\" is the term often used to describe virus-mediated DNA transfer. Methods of Gene delivery There are various methods of introducing foreign DNA into a eukaryotic cell: some rely on physical treatment (electroporation, nanopaicles, magnetofection), other on chemical materials or biological paicles (viruses) that are used as carriers. Chemical-based transfection Therapeutic DNA can get inside target cells by chemically linking the DNA to a molecule that will bind to special cell receptors. Once bound to these receptors, the therapeutic DNA constructs are engulfed by the cell membrane and passed into the interior of the target cell. Methods used are: a) Calcium phosphate: (This method is dependent upon the use of a calcium chloride-containing HEPES-buffered saline solution to deliver plasmid DNA. HEPES-buffered saline solution (HeBS) containing phosphate ions is combined with a calcium chloride solution containing the DNA to be transfected. When the two are combined, a fine precipitate of the positively charged calcium and the negatively charged phosphate will form, binding the DNA to be transfected on its surface. The suspension of the precipitate is then added to the cells to be transfected (usually a cell culture grown in a monolayer). By a process not entirely understood, the cells take up some of the precipitate, and with it. the DNA.) b) Dendrimers: are highly branched organic compounds. used to bind the DNA and get it into the cell. C) Liposomes: are small, membrane-bounded bodies that are in ways similar to the structure of a cell and can actually fuse with the cell membrane, releasing the DNA into the cell. d) Cationic polymers: such as DEAE-dextran or polyethylenimine. The negatively charged DNA binds to the polycation and the complex is taken up by the cell endocytosis. Non chemical methods a) Electroporation: is a technique by which plasma membrane permeability is transiently increased using a small electric current so that it allows extracellular macromolecules (including DNA) to be taken up into the cell. b) Sonoporation: Similar to electroporation Sonoporation, is the use of sound (typically ultrasonic frequencies) for modifying the permeability of the cell plasma membrane. c)Optical transfection: is a method where a tiny (--1 pm diameter) hole is transiently generated in the plasma membrane of a cell using a highly focused laser. d) Irnpalefection: is a method of gene delivery using nanomaterials, such as carrbon nanofibers, carbon nanolubes, nanowires e)Hydrodynamic delivery: is dependent on the rapid injection of a large aqueous volume containing DNA, RNA or other molecules into the blood vessels. Paicle-based methods Gene gun: A direct approach to transfection is the gene gull, where the DNA is coupled to a nanopaicle of an ine solid (commonly gold) which is then \"shot\" directly into the target cell's nucleus. Magnetofection: or Magnet assisted transfection is a transfection method, which uses magnetic force to deliver DNA into target cells. Nucleic acids are first associated with magnetic nanopaicles. Then, application of magnetic force drives the nucleic acid paicle complexes towards and into the target cells, where the cargo is released.",

        "question": "A 42-year-old man presents to his doctor with complaints of left-sided flank pain radiating into his groin. The pain began suddenly and has increased in intensity. He had a similar problem several years ago, but he did not seek medical attention, and his symptoms resolved spontaneously. He denies fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. He has had no diarrhea or difficulty urinating. Physical examination is remarkable for tenderness along the left flank and into the groin, but is otherwise normal. There are no inguinal hernias detected on examination. A urinalysis reveals microscopic hematuria without casts. Serum chemistry reveals: Sodium: 143 mEq/L Potassium: 2.4 mEq/L Bicarbonate: 17 mEq/L Chloride: 115 mEq/L Blood urea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL Glucose: 85 mg/dL Which of the following is MOST likely present in this patient?",
        "exp": "This patient's bicarbonate is lower than the normal range of 22-28 mEq/L. This means that there is less bicarbonate in his blood than usual. If his breathing is normal, then his CO2 level should be about normal. Bicarbonate is produced when CO2 binds to an H2O molecule, which then splits into a H+ ion and a HCO3- (bicarbonate) ion. This reaction is governed by an equilibrium constant propoional to the concentrations of the products multiplied together over the concentrations of the reactants multiplied together. By convention, the \"water\" concentration is ignored because it is \"constant.\" So, in order for the equilibrium constant to not change value, the H+ concentration must increase if the bicarbonate decreases and the CO2 remains the same. This means that an acidosis is produced. In this case, it is a metabolic acidosis, since there is no indication of respiratory disease in this patient. Neither a normal acid-base status nor a metabolic alkalosis would have a low bicarbonate. Note: The hallmark of metabolic acidosis is decreased HCO3-. Metabolic acidosis are classified by the anion gap, either normal or increased. The anion gap is the difference between readily measured anions and cations. Ref: Cho K.C. (2013). Chapter 21.

These conditions can have profound effects on membrane lipids as a consequence of their attack by peroxides (paicularly hydrogen peroxide) prevalent in this environment. During the reduction of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase, glutathione acts as a donor of the necessary reducing equivalent generating oxidized glutathione. Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide of the structure gamma glutamyl cysteinyl-glycine, where the cysteine sulfhydryl side chains can form a disulfide bond between two molecules (designated as GSSG). To again perform the role of cofactor for glutathione peroxidase, the disulfide bond of GSSG must be reduced. This reaction is catalyzed by glutathione reductase which requires NADPH as a cofactor. Therefore, in order to maintain a red cell membrane structure, erythrocytes utilize the pentose phosphate pathway for the generation of large amounts of NADPH. Erythrocytes are enucleate and therefore do not synthesize DNA and have no need for ribose-5-phosphate. Production of 2, 3- diphosphoglycerate occurs through a side reaction of glycolysis, not the pentose phosphate pathway. The pentose phosphate pathway does not generate ATP or result in the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Ref: Bender D.A., Mayes P.A. (2011). Chapter 21.

Changes in the DNA sequence should be reflected in a change in the mRNA sequence and, depending on codon usage, in protein sequence. An exceptions to this dogma is, coding information can be changed at the mRNA level by RNA editing. In such cases, the coding sequence of the mRNA differs from that in the cognate DNA. An example is the apolipoprotein B (apoB)gene and mRNA. In liver, the single apoBgene is transcribed into an mRNA that directs the synthesis of a 100-kDa protein, apoB100. In the intestine, the same gene directs the synthesis of the primary transcript; however, a cytidine deaminase conves a CAA codon in the mRNA to UAA at a single specific site. Rather than encoding glutamine, this codon becomes a termination signal, and a 48-kDa protein (apoB48) is the result. ApoB100 and apoB48 have different functions in the two organs.

        "question": "The activity of which of the following enzymes is directly affected by citrate?",
        "exp": "Citrate is produced by citrate synthase from acetyl CoA and oxaloacetate. This reaction takes place in the mitochondria, but citrate can move freely from the mitochondria into the cytosol. When the citric acid cycle slows down, citrate accumulates. In the cytosol, it acts as a negative allosteric regulator of phosphofructokinase I, the enzyme that catalyzes the committed step of glycolysis. Fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase breaks down fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a potent allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase I. Fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase is activated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Isocitrate dehydrogenase conves isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate in the citric acid cycle. It is allosterically stimulated by ADP and inhibited by ATP and NADH. This reaction produces NADH and CO2. Pyruvate carboxylase is a mitochondrial enzyme that conves pyruvate to oxaloacetate. It is impoant in gluconeogenesis and replenishes the oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle. Ref: Bender D.A., Mayes P.A. (2011). Chapter 20. Gluconeogenesis & the Control of Blood Glucose. In D.A.

Patients with a deficiency in the muscle isoform of glycogen phosphorylase (McArdle disease) can tolerate mild to moderate exercise, but get muscle cramps with strenuous exercise as a consequence of the lack of glycogenolysis in the muscle cell.

Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) is a difference in homologous DNA sequences that can be detected by the presence of fragments of different lengths after digestion of the DNA samples in question with specific restriction endonucleases. RFLP, as a molecular marker, is specific to a single clone/restriction enzyme combination. An RFLP probe is a labeled DNA sequence that hybridizes with one or more fragments of the digested DNA sample after they were separated by gel electrophoresis, thus revealing a unique blotting pattern characteristic to a specific genotype at a specific locus. Sho, single- or low-copy genomic DNA or cDNA clones are typically used as RFLP probes. RFLPs are visualized by digesting DNA from different individuals with a restriction enzyme, followed by gel electrophoresis to separate fragments according to size, then blotting and hybridization to a labeled probe that identifies the locus under investigation. An RFLP is demonstrated whenever the Southern blot pattern obtained with one individual is different from the one obtained with another individual. Harrison 17/e p390 writes-\"Southern blotting is used to analyze whether genes have been deleted or rearranged. It is also used to detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Genornic DNA is digested with restriction endonucleases and separated by gel electrophoresis. Individual .fragments can then be transferred to a membrane and detected after hybridization with specific radioactive DNA probes. Because single base pair mismatches can disrupt the hybridization of sho DNA probes (oligonucleotides), a variation of the Southern blot, termed oligonucleotide-specific hybridization (OSH), uses sho oligonucleotides to distinguish normal from mutant genes.\" RFLP is an impoant tool in genome mapping, localization of genes for genetic disorders, determination of risk for disease, and paternity testing",

        "question": "A competitive inhibitor of an enzyme will?",
        "exp": "Substances that reduce the activity of an enzyme are called inhibitors. Reversible inhibitors bind to an enzyme but rapidly dissociate from it . There are several types of reversible inhibitors: Competitive inhibitors usually resemble the substrate and compete with it for binding at the active site. Thus, increasing the concentration of substrate will decrease the percent inhibition of the enzyme. The Vmax is unchanged, but the Km is increased. A noncompetitive inhibitor binds with equal affinity to both enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex. This binding leads to a distoion of the substrate binding site, so new substrate cannot bind and/or the product cannot be released. In this kind of inhibition, the Vmax is decreased (choice A), but the Km is not altered. Adding more substrate will not reverse this type of inhibition. This is the equivalent of decreasing the turnover number. An uncompetitive inhibitor does not bind to free enzyme, but binds to the enzyme-substrate complex at a site other than the catalytic site. Once bound by the inhibitor, the enzyme is trapped in the enzyme-substrate complex state until the inhibitor dissociates. In this kind of inhibition, the slope of the reaction (which is the ratio Km/Vmax) remains the same, but both Vmax and Km are reduced. Ref: Janson L.W., Tischler M.E. (2012). Chapter 5.

Therefore, it is unstable; once formed, it decomposes almost immediately to form the reaction product.So, this high energy intermediate acts as energy barrier, separating the substrates and the products.This barrier, called the free energy of action, is the energy difference between the energy of the substrates and high energy intermediates.In other words, initially some energy must be put into the substrate for conversion into transition state (high-energy intermediate); this is the free energy of activation.The enzymes speed up the chemical reaction by lowering the magnitude of the activation energy barrier, i.e., free energy of activation.Most enzyme-substrate combinations are mostly due to weak non-covalent interactions like hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interactions, ionic (electrostate) interaction and Vander waals forces.However, covalent catalysis involves the formation of a covalent bond between the amino acyl residues of active site of enzyme and substrate.Covalent catalysis is used by serine proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsine) which bind their substrate covalently at serine side chain.",

Acute beriberi due to thiamine deficiency is associated with anorexia, vomiting, lactic acidosis, altered hea rate, and cardiomegaly. Acute beriberi mostly seen in infants. In combination with proteins, riboflavin coenzymes, like flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide, function in various dehydrogenation reactions. Deficiency of riboflavin causes cheilosis, glossitis, inflammation of cornea, bloodshot eyes, dimness of vision, photophobia, itching, burning, and dryness of eyes and redness of conjunctiva. Niacin is required for the synthesis of the active forms of vitamin B3, NAD+, and NADP+. Both NAD and NADP function as cofactors for numerous dehydreogenases, e.g. lactate and malate dehydrogenases. Deficiency of niacin causes pellagra characterized by glossitis of the tongue, dermatitis, depression, dementia and diarrhoea. Pantothenic acid is a component of coenzyme A and is required for the synthesis of phosphopantotheine of fatty acid synthases complex.

First, figure out the diagnosis (a classic case of Parkinson's disease), then remember which neurotransmitter is involved in the disease (dopamine), and finally, recall which amino acid serves as the precursor for that neurotransmitter (tyrosine). The hydroxylation of tyrosine by tyrosine hydroxylase results in DOPA, which is then decarboxylated to dopamine. Note that norepinephrine and epinephrine are also tyrosine derivatives, as are the melanins and the thyroid hormones, thyroxine and triiodothyronine. The other answer choices are also precursors of specialized products: Glutamate can be conveed to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA by the action of glutamate decarboxylase. Glycine is involved in the synthesis of both creatine (along with arginine and S-adenosylmethionine) and heme (along with succinyl-CoA).

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., UV absorptionDenaturation (melting) of DNADenaturation (melting) refers to separation of the two strands of the DNA into two component strands. When temperature of medium is raised, the hydrogen bonds linking of complementary base pair tends to break. As a result, separation of two strands occur. Melting temperature (Tm) indicates the temperature at which half of the double stranded structure is lost. Normally, Tm is between 85deg C and 95deg C.Since G and C are linked more strongly by three hydrogen bonds, in contrast to two hydrogen bonds linking A and T, G and C linking provides thermostability to DNA. Therefore, DNA molecules having higher GC content have relatively higher Tm. For every 10% increase in GC content, melting temperature increases by 5degC. Simple formula is -Tm (degC ) = 2 (number of AT base pairs) + 4 (number of GC base pairs)In addition to heat, alkali treatment and decrease of salt conentration also cause denatruation. Decrease in salt concentration decreases Tm. Therefore, increase in salt concentration increases DNA duplex stability. Denaturation affects propeies of DNA and these can be used to monitor strand separation -i) Hyperchomicity (hyperchromic effect) : DNA bases (purines and pyrimidines) absorb UV light of 260 nm. Upon denaturation, this optical absorbance is increased and is called hyperchromicity of denaturation or hyperchromic effect.ii) Viscosity : Viscosity of the DNA solution decreases on melting (denaturation) because single strands are more flexible than the stiff, resilient double helix.The separated strands of denatured DNA can rejoin on gradual cooling.

Only two enzymes of those listed in the answer choices specifically involve these pathways and cause hemolytic anemia: pyruvate kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait, so females would not be affected. Pyruvate kinase is a glycolytic enzyme; pyruvate kinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, affecting males and females approximately equally. If this enzyme is deficient, red cells have trouble producing enough ATP to maintain the Na+/K+ pump on the plasma membrane, secondarily causing swelling and lysis.

A TATA box is a DNA sequence that indicates the point at which a genetic sequence can be read and decoded. Transcription: Transcription is the process by which DNA is copied (transcribed) to mRNA, which carries the information needed for protein synthesis. Transcription takes place in two broad steps. First, pre-messenger RNA is formed, with the involvement of RNA polymerase enzymes. Second formation of Messenger RNA. Transcription unit: is a linear sequence of DNA that extends from a transcription sta site to a transcription stop site. The transcription unit--that poion of a gene that is copied by RNA polymerase--consists of coding regions of DNA (exons) interrupted by intervening sequences of noncoding DNA (introns). After transcription, during RNA processing, introns are removed and the exons are ligated together to form the mature mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm. 1) Transcription Steps: There are three main steps to the process of DNA transcription. Initiation: RNA Polymerase Binds to DNA. DNA is transcribed by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. Specific nucleotide sequences tell RNA polymerase where to begin and where to end. RNA polymerase attaches to the DNA at a specific area called the promoter region. Elongation: Ceain proteins called transcription factors unwind the DNA strand and allow RNA polymerase to transcribe only a single strand of DNA into a single stranded RNA polymer called messenger RNA (mRNA). The strand that serves as the template is called the antisense strand. The strand that is not transcribed is called the sense strand. Termination: RNA polymerase moves along the DNA until it reaches a terminator sequence. At that point, RNA polymerase releases the mRNA polymer and detaches from the DNA. 2) Pre mRNA processing: RNA splicing: pre-mRNAs typically include introns.Exons:are the continuous coding regions. Introns: are the noncoding intervening sequences. They may serve to separate functional domains (exons) of coding information in a form that permits genetic rearrangement by recombination to occur more rapidly than if all coding regions for a given genetic function were contiguous. Introns are removed by RNA processing in which the intron is looped out and cut away from the exons by snRNPs, and the exons are spliced together to produce the translatable mRNA.

        "question": "Which of the following enzymes is stimulated by glucagon?",
        "exp": "Before you staed analyzing all of the answer choices you should have reminded yourself that glucagon increases serum glucose. So an enzyme stimulated by glucagon might be involved in either the breakdown of glycogen to glucose (glycogenolysis) or in the creation of glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors (gluconeogenesis). Glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the first step in glycogenolysis; it makes sense that it would be stimulated by glucagon. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the first step in fatty acid synthesis, an anabolic process that would be stimulated by insulin, not glucagon. As its name implies, glycogen synthase is involved in the synthesis of glycogen. Glucagon (and epinephrine) stimulate the phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase. HMG-CoA reductase is the key enzyme involved in the synthesis of cholesterol. Since this is an anabolic process that occurs in the well-fed state, you would expect it to be stimulated by insulin and inhibited by glucagon (which it is). Ref: Bender D.A., Mayes P.A. (2011).

        "exp": "Alkaptonuria Age of patient, calcification of interveebral disc, pigmentation and reaction with Benedict's reagent give away the diagnosis of Alkaptonuria. All the options mentioned in this question are inherited disorders of amino acid metabolism. Phenylketonuria, tyrosinemia type 2 and Arigininosuccinic aciduria present during infancy or childhood, whereas Alkaptonuria presents usually at 40 yrs of age. It may go unrecognized until middle life. Mental retardation is usually seen in all the other 3 options. (Mental retardation not seen in Alkaptonuria). Alkaptonuria Triad of: - Homogentisic aciduria - Black pigmentation of cailage and collagenous tissue (ochronosis) - Ochronotic ahritis It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of tyrosine catabolism. There is deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase which results in the accumulation of homogentisic acid pigment cailages and collagenous tissues (ochronosis). Large amount of homogentisic acid is excreted in urine which gets oxidised on exposure to air and impas urine a dark colour especially if the pH of urine is alkaline. Alkaptonuria is usually recognised by 30-40 yrs of age when degenerative joint disease and ochronosis (pigmentation) become noticeable. Ochronosis ahritis commonly involves shoulder, hips and knees. The interveebral discs are degenerated, spaces are narrowed and calcification occurs. Ochronosis or pigmentation can involve- hea valves, larynx, tympanic membrane, sclera, ear cailage and skin. Occasionally pigmented renal or prostatic calculi can occur. Homogentisic acid (HGA) is a strong reducing agent and gives positive reaction with Benedict's & Fehling's reagent. A greenish brown precipitate with brownish black supernatant develops with Benedict's reagent and transient blue green colour develops with Fehling's (FeC13) reagent. The diagnosis is confirmed by measurement of HGA concentration in urine by paper and thin layer chromatography. Low protein diet especially low in phenylalanine and tyrosine is advocated in combination with ascorbic acid, but not very effective. Addition of nitisinone (an inhibitor of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase which catalyzes the formation of homogentisic acid) drastically reduces urinary excretion of homogentisic acid might prevent the long term complication of alkaptonuria.",

Increased levels of glucagon activates c-AMP dependent protein kinase which inturn activates F2, 6 BPase (fructose 2, 6 biphosphatase or FBpase 2) and inactivates phosphofructokinase (PFK)-2 leading to conversion of F2, 6 BP (Fructose 2, 6 biphosphatse) to fructose 6 phosphate. So the concentration of F2, 6 BP is decreasedQ and fructose 6 phosphate is increased which is conveed to glucose.- Gluconeogenesis in fasting state is indicated by acetyl CoA induced instantaneous allosteric activation of hepatic pyruvate carboxylase.- Phosphofructokinase I takes pa in glycolysis and FBPase 1 in gluconeogenesis, by catalyzing the formation & breakdown of fructose 1, 6 biphosphate respectively. Whereas bifunctional enzyme phosphor fructo kinase 2 (PK-2) also has fructose 2, 6 biphosphatase (FBP ase 2 or F 2, 6 pase) activity and plays a unique role in regulation of both glycolysis & gluconeogenesis by determining the levels of fructose 2, 6 bihosphateQ.- Fructose 2, 6 bihosphate (F2, 6BP) is the most potent allosteric activator of PFK-1 (thereby increase glycolysis) and inhibitor of fructose 1, 6 biphosphatase /FBP ase 1/ Fl, 6 pase (thereby decreasing gluconegenesis) in liverQ. The reciprocal action of fructose 2, 6 biPO4, on glycolysis and gluconeogenesis ensure that both pathways, is not fully active at same time. Therefore, decreased sensitivity of FBP ase 1 to regulation (inhibition) by fructose 2, 6 biphosphate increases gluconeogenesis; thereby decreasing levels of fructose 1, 6 biphosphate, pyruvate and ATPQ.- Fructose 1, 6 biphosphate is under negative feed back control of fructose 2, 6 biphosphateQ. If fructose 1, 6 biphasphatase becomes less sensitive to the negative feed back of fructose 2, 6 biPO4, its level of activity will increase. Thus more fructose 1, 6 biPO4 will be cleaved into fructose 6-PO4 and levels of fructose 1, 6 biPO4 will decrease and be lower than normal. The cycle will be shifted more toward gluconeogenesis. Less ATP would be generated Wt decreased glycolysisQ.Glycogenic capability of cell is determined by presence (activation) of fructose 1, 6 biphosphataseQ. The conversion of fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate to fructose6-phosphate, to achieve a reversal of glycolysis, is catalyzed by fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Its presence determines whether or not a tissue is capable of synthesizing glycogen not only from pyruvate but also from triosephosphates.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Complex II During the transfer of electrons through the ETC, energy is produced. This energy is coupled to the formation of ATP molecules by phosphorylation of ADP by an enzyme F0F1 ATPase. The phosphorylation of ADP into ATP is coupled with oxidation of reducing equivalents, therefore the process is called oxidative phosphorylation. There are three ATP synthesizing sites of electron transpo chain : (i) Site 1 is between NAD and CoQ, i.e., Complex I; (ii) Site II is between CoQ and cytochrome C, i.e., Complex III; and (iii) Site III is between cytochrome C and oxygen, i.e., complex IV. These sites provide energy required to make ATP from ADP by an enzyme FoFiATPase. The energy liberated of site I (complex I) is used to synthesize 1 ATP molecule, at site II (complex III) is used to synthesize 1 ATP molecule and at site III (Complex IV) is used to synthesize 1/2 ATP molecule. Thus, when 1 NADH molecule enters the respiratory chain, it produce 2.5 molecules of ATP. When 1 molecule of FADH2 enters the respiratory chain only 1.5 molecules of ATP are produced as site I of energy liberation is bypassed. Note : Previously it was assumed the NADH produces 3 ATPs and FAD generates 2 ATPs. Recent experiments show that these old values are overestimates and NADH produces 2.5 ATPs and FADH2 produces 1.5 ATPs.",

However, glycine is much more destabilizing than aspartic acid (aspartate).\n\nAmino acids destabilizing the alpha helix\n\nProline is never found in a-helix. The peptide bond of nitrogen of proline lacks a hydrogen atom to contribute hydrogen bond (proline is imino acid:- NH, not amino -NH2). When incorporated in this structure, it causes the chain to bend sharply (as at that level stabilizing hydrogen bond is not available). This disrupts regular helical conformation. Proline can only be stably accommodated within the first turn of an a-helix.\nGlycine also tends to disrupt \u03b1-helix. Because of its high conformational flexibility and small size, it often induces bends in \u03b1-helices.\nAmino acids with charged R-groups (i.e. charged amino acids):- They interfere with the formation of \u03b1-helix because of electrostatic (ionic) attraction between the charged groups. These amino acids are:-\n\n\nPositively charged (basic):- Histidine, arginine, lysine\nNegatively charged (acidic) :- Aspartate (aspartic acid), glutamate (glutamic acid)\n\n\nAmino acid with bulky R group due to branch at \u03b2-carbon:- They destabilize \u03b1-helix because side chain of these amino acids projects out of the plane of the main a-helix chain. These amino acids are isoleucine and valine.\nAmino acids whose side chain can form hydrogen bond:- These amino acids disrupt \u03b1-helix by acting as a competitor of the main hydrogen donor and acceptors. These amino acids are serine, asparagine,\u00a0and threonine.\nYou should make it clear in your mind that destabilizing property of amino acid does not mean that they cannot occur in \u03b1-helix. They have a different propensity for \u03b1-helix.\nFor example, proline can never occur in \u03b1-helix as it cannot form a hydrogen bond, the major stabilizing force in \u03b1-helix. Glycine is also not commonly found as it is too small and induces bends in a-helix. Other amino acids destabilize \u03b1-helix when present in large numbers.\n\nPropensity of \u03b1-helix (higher the number less the chance to be found in \u03b1-helix)\n\nAlanine (0.0) > Leucine (0.21) = arginine (0.21)> Methionine (0.24) > Lysine (0.26) > glutamine (0.39) > glutamic acid (0.40) > isoleucine (0.41) > tryptophan (0.49) > serine (0.5) > tyrosine (0.53) > phenylalanine (0.54) > valine = histidine (0.61) > aspargine (0.65) > threonine (0.66) > cysteine (0.68) > aspartic acid (0.69) > glycine (1) > proline (3.16).\nThat means alanine is the most stabilizing unit.\nBeside proline and glycine, any amino acid can occur in \u03b1-helix, however with a different propensity for \u03b1-helix and also with the different destabilizing property.",

In patients with normal dentition, gum changes (swelling, bleeding, loosening of teeth) are also noted. Without supplementation with vitamin C, death may eventually occur.

Among these, a severe memory deficit, which the patient may attempt to cover by making up bizarre explanations (confabulation), is prominent. Anatomical damage to the mamillary bodies and periventricular structures has been postulated as the cause. Thiamine deficiency can also damage peripheral nerves (\"dry\" beriberi) and the hea (\"wet\" beriberi). Folic acid deficiency produces megaloblastic anemia without neurologic symptoms. Niacin deficiency produces pellagra, characterized by depigmenting dermatitis, chronic diarrhea, and anemia. Riboflavin deficiency produces ariboflavinosis, characterized by glossitis, corneal opacities, dermatitis, and erythroid hyperplasia.",
