        "exp": "Alkaptonuria Age of patient, calcification of interveebral disc, pigmentation and reaction with Benedict's reagent give away the diagnosis of Alkaptonuria. All the options mentioned in this question are inherited disorders of amino acid metabolism. Phenylketonuria, tyrosinemia type 2 and Arigininosuccinic aciduria present during infancy or childhood, whereas Alkaptonuria presents usually at 40 yrs of age. It may go unrecognized until middle life. Mental retardation is usually seen in all the other 3 options. (Mental retardation not seen in Alkaptonuria). Alkaptonuria Triad of: - Homogentisic aciduria - Black pigmentation of cailage and collagenous tissue (ochronosis) - Ochronotic ahritis It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of tyrosine catabolism. There is deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase which results in the accumulation of homogentisic acid pigment cailages and collagenous tissues (ochronosis). Large amount of homogentisic acid is excreted in urine which gets oxidised on exposure to air and impas urine a dark colour especially if the pH of urine is alkaline. Alkaptonuria is usually recognised by 30-40 yrs of age when degenerative joint disease and ochronosis (pigmentation) become noticeable. Ochronosis ahritis commonly involves shoulder, hips and knees. The interveebral discs are degenerated, spaces are narrowed and calcification occurs. Ochronosis or pigmentation can involve- heart valves, larynx, tympanic membrane, sclera, ear cailage and skin. Occasionally pigmented renal or prostatic calculi can occur. Homogentisic acid (HGA) is a strong reducing agent and gives positive reaction with Benedict's & Fehling's reagent. A greenish brown precipitate with brownish black supernatant develops with Benedict's reagent and transient blue green colour develops with Fehling's (Fe. C13) reagent. The diagnosis is confirmed by measurement of HGA concentration in urine by paper and thin layer chromatography. Low protein diet especially low in phenylalanine and tyrosine is advocated in combination with ascorbic acid, but not very effective. Addition of nitisinone (an inhibitor of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase which catalyzes the formation of homogentisic acid) drastically reduces urinary excretion of homogentisic acid might prevent the long term complication of alkaptonuria.",

        "exp": "C i. e. Increased levels of Fructose 2, 6 - Bisphosphate- Decreased concentration of glucose in blood & liver causes increased glucagon secretion (ki glucagon / insulin ratio) leading to glycogenolysis followed by gluconeogenesis in liver. Increased levels of glucagon activates c-AMP dependent protein kinase which inturn activates F2, 6 BPase (fructose 2, 6 biphosphatase or FBpase 2) and inactivates phosphofructokinase (PFK)-2 leading to conversion of F2, 6 BP (Fructose 2, 6 biphosphatse) to fructose 6 phosphate. So the concentration of F2, 6 BP is decreasedQ and fructose 6 phosphate is increased which is conveed to glucose.- Gluconeogenesis in fasting state is indicated by acetyl CoA induced instantaneous allosteric activation of hepatic pyruvate carboxylase.- Phosphofructokinase I takes pa in glycolysis and FBPase 1 in gluconeogenesis, by catalyzing the formation & breakdown of fructose 1, 6 biphosphate respectively. Whereas bifunctional enzyme phosphor fructo kinase 2 (PK-2) also has fructose 2, 6 biphosphatase (FBP ase 2 or F 2, 6 pase) activity and plays a unique role in regulation of both glycolysis & gluconeogenesis by determining the levels of fructose 2, 6 bihosphateQ.- Fructose 2, 6 bihosphate (F2, 6. BP) is the most potent allosteric activator of PFK-1 (thereby increase glycolysis) and inhibitor of fructose 1, 6 biphosphatase /FBP ase 1/ Fl, 6 pase (thereby decreasing gluconegenesis) in liverQ. The reciprocal action of fructose 2, 6 bi. PO4, on glycolysis and gluconeogenesis ensure that both pathways, is not fully active at same time. Therefore, decreased sensitivity of FBP ase 1 to regulation (inhibition) by fructose 2, 6 biphosphate increases gluconeogenesis; thereby decreasing levels of fructose 1, 6 biphosphate, pyruvate and ATPQ.- Fructose 1, 6 biphosphate is under negative feed back control of fructose 2, 6 biphosphateQ. If fructose 1, 6 biphasphatase becomes less sensitive to the negative feed back of fructose 2, 6 bi. PO4, its level of activity will increase. Thus more fructose 1, 6 bi. PO4 will be cleaved into fructose 6-PO4 and levels of fructose 1, 6 bi. PO4 will decrease and be lower than normal. The cycle will be shifted more toward gluconeogenesis. Less ATP would be generated Wt decreased glycolysisQ. Glycogenic capability of cell is determined by presence (activation) of fructose 1, 6 biphosphataseQ. The conversion of fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate to fructose6-phosphate, to achieve a reversal of glycolysis, is catalyzed by fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase. Its presence determines whether or not a tissue is capable of synthesizing glycogen not only from pyruvate but also from triosephosphates. It is present in liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle but is probably absent from heart and smooth muscle. In well fed state gluconeogenesis in liver is inhibited by ADPQ.",

These sites provide energy required to make ATP from ADP by an enzyme Fo. Fi. ATPase. The energy liberated of site I (complex I) is used to synthesize 1 ATP molecule, at site II (complex III) is used to synthesize 1 ATP molecule and at site III (Complex IV) is used to synthesize 1/2 ATP molecule. Thus, when 1 NADH molecule enters the respiratory chain, it produce 2. 5 molecules of ATP. When 1 molecule of FADH2 enters the respiratory chain only 1. 5 molecules of ATP are produced as site I of energy liberation is bypassed. Note: Previously it was assumed the NADH produces 3 ATPs and FAD generates 2 ATPs. Recent experiments show that these old values are overestimates and NADH produces 2. 5 ATPs and FADH2 produces 1. 5 ATPs.",

In nephelometry, the intensity of the scattered light is measured, usually, but not necessarily, at right angles to the incident light beam. The intensity of the scattered radiation depends on several factors, including the wavelength of the incident radiation and the paicle size; however, in a given system, the scattering is directly propoional to the concentration of the paiculate matter.",

Both glycine and aspartic acid can destabilize a-helix. However, glycine is much more destabilizing than aspartic acid (aspartate). Amino acids destabilizing the alpha helix Proline is never found in a-helix. The peptide bond of nitrogen of proline lacks a hydrogen atom to contribute hydrogen bond (proline is imino acid:- NH, not amino -NH2). When incorporated in this structure, it causes the chain to bend sharply (as at that level stabilizing hydrogen bond is not available). This disrupts regular helical conformation. Proline can only be stably accommodated within the first turn of an a-helix. Glycine also tends to disrupt \u03b1-helix. Because of its high conformational flexibility and small size, it often induces bends in \u03b1-helices. Amino acids with charged R-groups (i. e. charged amino acids):- They interfere with the formation of \u03b1-helix because of electrostatic (ionic) attraction between the charged groups. These amino acids are:- Positively charged (basic):- Histidine, arginine, lysine Negatively charged (acidic):- Aspartate (aspartic acid), glutamate (glutamic acid) Amino acid with bulky R group due to branch at \u03b2-carbon:- They destabilize \u03b1-helix because side chain of these amino acids projects out of the plane of the main a-helix chain. These amino acids are isoleucine and valine. Amino acids whose side chain can form hydrogen bond:- These amino acids disrupt \u03b1-helix by acting as a competitor of the main hydrogen donor and acceptors. These amino acids are serine, asparagine, and threonine. You should make it clear in your mind that destabilizing property of amino acid does not mean that they cannot occur in \u03b1-helix. They have a different propensity for \u03b1-helix. For example, proline can never occur in \u03b1-helix as it cannot form a hydrogen bond, the major stabilizing force in \u03b1-helix. Glycine is also not commonly found as it is too small and induces bends in a-helix. Other amino acids destabilize \u03b1-helix when present in large numbers. Propensity of \u03b1-helix (higher the number less the chance to be found in \u03b1-helix) Alanine (0. 0) > Leucine (0. 21) = arginine (0. 21)> Methionine (0. 24) > Lysine (0. 26) > glutamine (0. 39) > glutamic acid (0. 40) > isoleucine (0. 41) > tryptophan (0. 49) > serine (0. 5) > tyrosine (0. 53) > phenylalanine (0. 54) > valine = histidine (0. 61) > aspargine (0. 65) > threonine (0. 66) > cysteine (0. 68) > aspartic acid (0. 69) > glycine (1) > proline (3. 16). That means alanine is the most stabilizing unit.

The functionally absent lysosomal enzyme is b-N- acetylhexosaminidase. The elevated GM2 results in irreversible brain damage to infants, who usually die before the age of 3 years. Under normal conditions, this enzyme cleaves N- acetylgalactosamine from the oligosaccharide chain of this complex sphingolipid, allowing fuher catabolism to occur. The cause of most lipidoses (lipid storage diseases) is similar. That is, a defect in catabolism of gangliosides causes abnormal accumulation. None of the other choices result in lipidotic disorders.

Among the tissues, adipose tissue is the most sensitive to the action of the insulin. Lipogenesis. It is the process by which acetyl-CoA is conveed to fats. The former is an intermediate stage in metabolism of simple sugars, such as glucose. Through lipogenesis, the energy can be efficiently stored in the form of fats. Lipogenesis encompasses the processes of fatty acid synthesis and subsequent triglyceride synthesis (when fatty acids are esterified with glycerol to form fats). The products are secreted from the liver in the form of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Fatty acids synthesis stas with acetyl-CoA and builds up by the addition of two carbon units. The synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm in contrast to the degradation (oxidation), which occurs in the mitochondria. Many of the enzymes for the fatty acid synthesis are organized into a multienzyme complex called fatty acid synthetase. Control and regulation. Insulin is an indicator of the blood sugar level of the body, as its concentration increases propoionally with blood sugar levels. Thus, a large insulin level is associated with the fed state. As one might expect, therefore, it increases the rate of storage pathways, such as lipogenesis. Insulin stimulates lipogenesis in two main ways: The enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which forms acetyl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which forms malonyl-CoA, are obvious control points. These are activated by insulin. So a high insulin level leads to an overall increase in the levels of malonyl-CoA, which is the substrate required for fatty acids synthesis. PDH dephosphorylation",

When the bacterial cell divides, the plasmids are split between the two daughter cells.

However, it should be transpoed to liver as urea cycle (formation of urea) occurs only in liver. Since free ammonia is highly toxic, it is never transpoed in free form in blood. Two mechanisms are available for transpo of ammonia from the peripheral tissues to the liver: 1) In the form of glutamine. In many tissues like liver, kidney and brain, ammonia combines with glutamate to yield glutamine, by the action of glutamine synthase. The brain is a rich source of glutamine synthase and it predominantly detoxifies ammonia by this route. Glutamine is a nontoxic major transpo form of ammonia. The glutamine is transpoed by blood to liver where deamination (removal of amino group) of glutamine takes place. Glutaminase cleaves glutamine to yield glutamate and free ammonia ammonium ion). \"[he ammonia is conveed by liver to urea. Formation and secretion ammonia by renal tubular cells maintain acid base balance. Ammonia is formed from glutamine by glutaminase. Excretion of ammonia increases in metabolic acidosis and decreases in metabolic alkalosis. 2) In the form of alanine. Alanine transpos ammonia from muscles to liver through glucose-alanine cycle'. In muscle, glutamate is formed from ammonia and a-ketoglutarate by reversal of the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction. L-glutamate then transfers its a-amino group to pyruvate by transmination reaction to form alanine. Alanine is transpoed to liver. In liver alanine is conveed to pyruvate and glutamate by transamination reaction. Glutamate undergoes oxidative deamination to release free ammonia, which is conveed to urea.",

The usual procedure of producing a chromosome spread is to arrest mitosis in dividing cells in metaphase by the use of mitotic spindle inhibitors (e. g.. colcemid) and then to stain the chromosomes. In a metaphase spread, the individual chromosomes take the form of two chromatids connected at the centromere. A karyotype is a standard arrangement of a photographed or imaged stained metaphase spread in which chromosome pairs are arranged in order of decreasing length. A variety of staining methods that allow identification of each individual chromosome on the basis of a distinctive and reliable pattern of alternating light and dark bands along the length of the chromosome have been developed. The one most commonly employed uses a Giemsa stain and is hence called G banding. \" - Robbins Pathology 7/e pl70 A karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes in the nucleus of a eukaryote cell. The term is also used for the complete set of chromosomes in a species, or an individual organism. Karyotypes describe the number of chromosomes, and what they look like under a light microscope. Attention is paid to their length, the position of the centromeres, any differences between the sex chromosomes, and any other physical characteristics. The preparation and study of karyotypes is pa of cytogenetics. The study of karyotypes is made possible by staining. Usually, a suitable dye, such as Giemsa is applied after cells have been arrested during cell division by a solution of colchicine. The dye stains regions of chromosomes that are rich in the base pairs Adenine (A) and Thymine (T) producing a dark band.",

        "question": "In which of the following laboratory tests would you expect to find the greatest disparity in reference intervals between men and (non-pregnant) women?",
        "exp": "Men have higher reference intervals than women in tests related to iron and hemoglobin (Hb) concentration in blood. The normal reference interval for Hb concentration in women is lower (12. 0-16. 0 gm/dL) than that for men (13. 5-17. 5 gm/dL) due to lower serum testosterone levels (testosterone is higher in men and stimulates erythropoiesis) and blood loss during menses. Fuhermore, women normally have about 400 mg of iron (as ferritin) in their bone marrow iron stores versus an average of 1000 mg of iron for men. In the absence of inflammation, the small circulating fraction of ferritin correlates well with ferritin stores in the bone marrow. Hence, men have different reference intervals for serum ferritin than do women (15-200 ng/mL in men versus 12-150 ng/mL in women). The mean corpuscular volume, serum alkaline phosphatase, serum glucose, and serum sodium are similar in both sexes. Ref: Beutler E. (2010). Chapter 42. Disorders of Iron Metabolism. In J. T.

Most of the iron in the diet is in the ferric (Fe3+) form, whereas it is the ferrous (Fe2+) form that is absorbed. Fe3+ reductase activity is associated with the iron transpoer in the brush borders of the enterocytes. Gastric secretions dissolve the iron and permit it to form soluble complexes with ascorbic acid (Vit C) and other substances that aid its reduction to the Fe2+ form. Implication: Iron deficiency anemia is a troublesome and relatively frequent complication of paial gastrectomy. Impoant Topics - Iron bioavailability is affected by the nature of the foodstuff, with heme iron (e. g. red meat) being most readily absorbed. Vegetarians are at an additional disadvantage because ceain foodstuffs that include phytates and phosphates reduce iron absorption by approximately 50%. Iron absorption takes place largely in the proximal small intestine and is a carefully regulated process. Iron absorption is influenced by a number of physiologic states. Erythroid hyperplasia stimulates iron absorption even in the face of normal or increased iron stores, and hepcidin levels are inappropriately low. Ref: Barrett K. E., Barman S.

Secondary structure of protein refers to description of steric relationship (spatial arrangement) between aminoacids located relatively near each other in a selected segment of main polypeptide chain, without regard to the conformation of its side chains or its relationship to other segments. Examples of secondary structures include a-helix, pleated sheet and 13 turns etc. Naturally occurring L-aminoacids can (theoretically) form either right or left handed a-helices, but extended left handed a? helices are theoretically less stable and have not been observed in proteinsQ. Proline and glycine have the least tendency (proclivity) to form a-helicesQ. Large number of charged aminoacids like aspaate (aspaic acid)Q, glutamate (glutamic acid), arginine, lysine or histidine can also disrupt a-helix by forming ionic bonds or electrostatically repelling each other. Secondary structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds & disulfide bonds; Cooperative hydrogen bonding in repeating secondary structures have an impoant role in guiding the protein folding processQ. However, location of bends (including l turns) in polypeptide chain and the direction and angle of these turns are determined by the numer & location of specific bend producing aminoacid residues, such as Pro, Thr, Ser, and Gly. Interacting segments of polypeptide chains are held in their characteristic teiary (3-dimensional) positions by several kinds of weak interactionsQ (mainly hydrophobic bonds, vanderwall forces, ionic interactions) and sometimes by covalent bonds (such as disulfide cross links) between the segments. Some proteins contain 2 polypeptide chains or subunits which may be identical (homo) or different (hetero). Quaernary structure of protein refers to three dimensional arrangement of these protein subunits.

This genetic disease results from deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase. The deficiency impairs the ability of the liver to produce free glucose from glycogen and from gluconeogenesis. Since these are the two principal metabolic mechanisms by which the liver supplies glucose to the rest of the body during periods of fasting, it causes severe hypoglycemia and results in increased glycogen storage in liver and kidneys. This can lead to enlargement of both. Both organs function normally in childhood, but are susceptible to a variety of problems in adult years. Other metabolic derangements include lactic acidosis and hyperlipidemia. Frequent or continuous feedings of cornstarch or other carbohydrates are the principal treatment.",

        "exp": "In a 45 years old female patient, who presented with painless supraclavicular lymph node enlargement. Biopsy revealed binucleated acidophilic owl eye appearance with floating lymphocytes in empty space, which was CD 15, CD 30 positive. The most probable diagnosis is Hodgkin's lymphoma. Nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity and lymphocyte-depleted variants are positive for CD 15 and CD30. But Nodular sclerosis variant is most common type and more common in females. So, in the above-mentioned clinical situation, most probable diagnosis is nodular sclerosis variant of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Reed-Sternberg cells are large and are either multinucleated or have a bibbed nucleus (thus resembling an 'owl's eye' appearance) with prominent eosinophilic inclusion-like nucleoli. Reed-Sternberg cells are CD30 and CDI5 positive, usually negative for CD20 and CD45. The presence of these cells is necessary in the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma - the absence of Reed-Sternberg cells has very high negative predictive value. Nodular sclerosis: Nodular sclerosis is MC type all over the world. QNodular sclerosis is MC in females. It has propensity to involve the cervical, supraclavicular and mediastinal lymph nodes of adults and adolescents. Lacunar cells of Reed Sternberg cells variant is seen",

This lead to the formation of methionine and cystathionine respectively. Several enzymes regulate these pathways under normal condition in the presence of Vit. B12, B6 and Folic acid. Abnormality in any of the enzymes or vitamin deficiency may give rise to hyperhomocysteinemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been classified as: Moderate (Hcy >15 to 30 mmol/L), Intermediate (Hcy >30 to 100. mmol/L) and Severe (Hcy >100 mmol/L) Hyperhomocysteinemia and CVD Hyperhomocysteinemia induce smooth muscle proliferation, accelerate oxidation of LDL cholesterol, impair endothelial derived nitric oxide, decrease synthesis of heparan sulphate proteoglycan and also induce proinflammatory changes in the vessel wall. The exact mechanism of atherothrombosis associated with yperhomocysteinemia is not clear. Several studies have pointed to an association with inhibition of thrombomodulin activity, reduction of protein c activation, increased platelet aggregation, and predisposition to endothelial injury.

Thus, energy rich phosphagen stores (ATP and creatine phosphate) permit severe muscle contraction for 8-10 seconds only.

Energy source during in exercise can be summarized by:? Sho burst of intense activity (e. g., 100 meter sprint or weight lifting): - All energy comes from ATP and creatine phosphate. Breakdown of these compound is an anaerobic processes. Little longer intense exercise (e. g., 200 meter sprint or 100 meter swim):- Besides ATP and creatine phosphate, glycogen is metabolised by anerobic glycolytic pathways to provide a ready source of energy. So, muscle work is anaerobic. Longer duration exercise (e. g., jogging, marathan run): - The muscle work is aerobic and energy comes from aerobic utilization ofglucose and free fatty acids.

This is the rate-limiting step in the urea cycle. This reaction requires two ATP and occurs in the mitochondria. Ornithine transcarbamoylase: Combines ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to form citrulline. Located in mitochondria. Argininosuccinate synthetase: Condenses citrulline with aspaate to form arginosuccinate. This reaction occurs in the cytosol and requires one ATP. Argininosuccinate lyase: Splits argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate. Occurs in the cytosol. Arginase: Cleaves arginine into one molecule of urea and ornithine in the cytosol. The ornithine is then transpoed back into the mitochondria for entry back into the cycle.* Regulation: Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the cycle and is stimulated by N -acetylglutamate.* Diseases: Hyperammonemia occurs when there is a deficiency in one of more of the urea cycle enzymes, causing insufficient removal of NH 4+.

Helices with proline after position four have a pronounced kink. a -helix: It is a spiral structure resulting from hydrogen bonding between one peptide bond and the fouh one. Stability of an a helix: The stability of an a helix arises primarily from hydrogen bonds formed between the oxygen of the peptide bond carbonyl and the hydrogen atom of the peptide bond nitrogen of the fouh residue down the polypeptide chain. The ability to form the maximum number of hydrogen bonds, supplemented by van der Waals interactions in the core of this tightly packed structure, provides the thermodynamic driving force for the formation of an a helix. Proline: The peptide bond nitrogen of proline lacks a hydrogen atom to contribute to a hydrogen bond, proline can only be stably accommodated within the first turn of an a helix. When present elsewhere, proline disrupts the conformation of the helix, producing a bend. Glycine also tends to disrupt helices because its high conformational flexibility makes it entropically expensive to adopt the relatively constrained a-helical structure.

OVERVIEW OF AMINO ACID DEGRADATION* There are several steps involved in the degradation of amino acids. 1. The a-amino group must be removed from the amino acid. This can be done either transamination or oxidative deamination. In transamination, enzymes, known as aminotransferases, act to remove the amino group from specific amino acids and transfer them to another molecule. Almost every amino acid has a specific aminotransferase. ALT: Transfers amino group from alanine to a-ketoglutarate, resulting in the formation of glutamate and pyruvate. AST: Transfers amino group from glutamate to oxaloacetate, resulting in the formation of aspaate and a-ketoglutarate. Oxidative deamination acts to remove the amino group from glutamate and release it as ammonia. Stimulators: ADP and GDP activate glutamate dehydrogenase. Inhibitors: ATP and GTP inhibit glutamate dehydrogenase. 2. Once the a-amino group is removed from the amino acid, the ammonia moiety must then be transpoed to the liver for metabolism into urea. This transpo occurs with the help of alanine and glutamine.. 3. Once in the liver, the ammonia moiety is transformed into urea the urea cycle. 4. The remaining carbon skeleton are then degraded into intermediates of the citric acid cycle or can be used as building blocks for other molecules. 5. The branched-chain amino acids (valine, isoleucine, leucine) require specific enzyme complexes in order to be fully degraded.",

Vasudevan page 179, http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Citric_acid_ cycle Urea cycle and TCA cycle are interlinked and so it is called as \"Urea Bicycle\". The absence of a urea cycle enzyme can result in hyperammonemia or in the build-up of one or more urea cycle intermediates, depending on the enzyme that is missing. Excess ammonia has been shown to inhibit the citric acid cycle (Hatch, 1977) One effect of ammonia is the inhibition of the rate limiting TCA cycle enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (alpha. KGDH) and possibly also pyruvate dehydrogenase, but this has been regarded to be of no quantitative impoance. However, recent studies justify a revision of this point of view. Based on published data, the following sequence of events is proposed. Inhibition of alpha. KGDH both enhances the detoxification of ammonia by formation of glutamine from alpha-ketoglutarate and reduces the rate of NADH and oxidative ATP production in astrocytic mitochondria.

        "exp": "Increased Euchromatin formation Histone acetylation promotes Euchromatin formation (transcriptionally active DNA). Deacetylation and methylation promotes Heterochromatin formation (transcriptionally inactive DNA). There are five classes of histones, designated HI, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. These small proteins are positively charged at physiologic pH as a result of their high content of lysine and arginine. Because of their positive charge, they form ionic bonds with negatively charged DNA. Histones help in condensation of DNA into chromosomes. Two molecules each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 form the structural core of the individual nucleosome \"beads. \" Around which a segment of the DNA double helix is wound nearly twice. (Histone HI, is not found in the nucleosome core, but instead binds to the linker DNA chain between the nucleosome beads.). Nucleosomes are fuher arranged into increasingly more complex structures that organize and condense the long DNA molecules into chromosomes. These histone proteins can undergo reversible modifications at their N-terminal end (like acetylation, methylation or phosphorylation). These modifications help in regulation of gene expression. Acetylation of the lysine residues at the N terminus of histone proteins removes positive charge on the lysine and thereby decreases the interaction of the histone with the negatively charged DNA. As a result, the condensed chromatin is transformed into a more relaxed structure allowing transcription factors to access specific regions on the DNA. Deacetylation restores the positive charge, causing stronger interactions between histones and DNA. Thus histone acetylation enhances transcription while histone deacetylation represses transcription. Relaxed, transcriptionally active DNA is referred to as euchromatin. More condensed, inactive DNA is referred to as heterochromatin. Histone acetylation is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases (HATS) and histone deacetylation is catalyzed by histone deacetylases (denoted by HDs or HDACs). Another difference noted between transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin is the extent of methylation of cytosine bases in CG-rich regions (CG islands) of many genes. It has been observed that transcriptionally active genes are less methylated (hypomethylated) than their inactive counterpas. Thus formation of euchromatin is promoted by acetylationand formation of heterochromatin is promoted by deacetylation and methylation. The action of methylation is indirect and has no effect upon charge.",

        "exp": "Each of the genetic deficiencies listed may present with cardiomyopathy in childhood. LCAD affects the first step in b-oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria. Cardiac muscle and resting skeletal muscle use fatty acids and ketones as a primary energy source, thus in LCAD deficiency, muscle weakness and eventually cardiomyopathy develop. Fasting hypoglycemia and hypoketosis occurring together are strongly suggestive of a block in fatty acid oxidation. Only a carnitine uptake deficiency (choice: Carnitine uptake deficiency) or LCAD deficiency (choice: LCAD) are related to fatty acid oxidation. Since carnitine esters (long chain acyl carnitines) are accumulating in serum and in muscle tissue, a carnitine uptake deficiency is ruled out. a-L-Iduronidase deficiency, or Hurler disease (choice: a-L-Iduronidase deficiency) is another of the lysosomal storage diseases. Cardiomyopathy, valvular defects, and potential occlusion of coronary aeries, are results of specific glycosaminoglycan (heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate) accumulation. Similar substrate accumulation in other tissues results in corneal clouding, mental retardation, and skeletal abnormalities. Hypoglycemia, hypoketosis, and muscle weakness are not prominent features of Hurler disease. There would be no accumulation of carnitine derivatives. Acid maltase is a lysosomal enzyme, and its deficiency produces one of a host of lysosomal storage diseases. Acid maltase deficiency (a 1, 4-glucosidase deficiency; choice: Acid maltase deficiency) or Pompe disease is also associated with cardiomyopathy. In this case glycogen fragments accumulate in the lysosomes, primarily affecting tissues that store glycogen (muscle, liver, kidney).

Some of the more commonly used techniques are the following: Q banding: Fixed chromosome spreads are stained without any pretreatment using quinacrine mustard, quinacrine, or other fluorescent dyes and observed with a fluorescence microscope. G banding: Preparations are incubated in a variety of saline solutions using any 1 of several pretreatments and stained with Giemsa's stain. G-banding is generally preferred over Q-banding because G-band analysis is performed by light microscopy. R banding: Preparations are incubated in buffer solutions at high temperatures or at special pH and stained with Giemsa's stain. This process yields the reverse bands of G banding. C banding: Preparations are either heated in saline to temperatures just below boiling or treated with ceain alkali solutions and then stained with Giemsa's stain. This process causes prominent bands to develop in the region of the centromeres. Ref: Manipalviratn S., Trivax B., Huang A. (2013). Chapter 3. Genetic Disorders & Sex Chromosome Abnormalities. In A.

The three major types of ketosis are: Starvation ketosis Alcoholic ketoacidosis Diabetic ketoacidosis Starvation Ketoacidosis: Occurs secondary to starvation, is due to a diminished insulin secretion, that leads to an increase in lipolysis and ketogenesis. The acidosis even with prolonged fasting is only mild to moderate. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a state of absolute or relative insulin deficiency and is defined by the American Diabetes Association's (ADA) diagnostic criteria of Hyperglycemia, Acidosis (aerial pH Ketosis (moderate ketonuria or ketonemia) The metabolic differences between diabetes and starvation include- Insulin levels: The level of insulin is decreased in both diabetes and starvation. It is more decreased in case of diabetes (viually absent in type I diabetes). There is relative excess of glucagon in both the cases. Glucagon acts through elevation in CAMP level. Blood glucose levels: Diabetics exhibit a characteristic hyperglycemia where as in starvation the individual maintain a blood glucose level that is near to normal Ketosis: The mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissue and hepatic ketogencsis are greater in diabetes than in starvation. As a result the ketoacidosis observed in diabetes in much more severe than that observed during starvation.

        "exp": "The primary role of altered metabolism during fasting is to maintain blood glucose through the synthesis (gluconeogenesis) and utilization of alternate substrates. Fasting-starvation is divided in three broad categories:? Initial stage:- Lasts upto 2-3 days. Intermediate stage:- Lasts upto 24 days. Advanced stage:- begins after 24 days. a) Initial stage (first stage):- Liver glycogen is the first main provider of energy. But due to limited storage it can not last longe (16-18 hrs.). Fuher glucose is provided by gluconeogenesis by non-carbohydrate sources (muscle protein breakdown is increased which provides amino acids alanine and glutamine for gluconeogenesis). Utilization of alternate substrates (other than glucose) stas increasing in terminal period of this stage. Free fatty acids and ketone bodies sta rising in this stage. Glycogen is completely depleted by the end of this stage. Blood glucose is slightly decreased. The first priority of metabolism in starvation is to provide sufficient glucose to brain and other tissues that are absolutely dependent on glucose. Liver glycogen provides glucose only for a sho period. Whereas, gluconeogenesis plays an essential role in maintaining blood glucose during both sho-term and prolonged starvation. The substrate for gluconeogenesis are pyruvate, lactate (from RBCs and exercising muscles), glucogenic amino acids released from muscle protein breakdown, and glycerol released from lipolysis. b) Intermediate stage (Second stage):- Free fatty acids are the major substrates for energy production. They are derived from hydrolysis of fat (triglycerides) in adipose tissue. Ketone bodies serve as additional source of energy. As glycogen source is already depleted, the only source of glucose is increased gluconeogenesis. After sometimes muscle breakdown decreases due to decreased need of glucose as a fuel for brain which has began using ketone bodies as a source of energy. c) Advanced stage (Third stage):- When fat stores are almost exhaused, energy requirment is obtained from breakdown of tissue proteins and protein stores once again enter in stage of rapid depletion. Thus the second priority of metabolism in starvation is to preserve protein. This is accomplished by using fatty acids and ketone bodies in place of glucose as a fuel.",

It is the most common secondary structure and a vast variety of proteins contain the a-helical structure. The a-helix is produced by formation of hydrogen bonds between peptide linkages three amino acid residue apa. That means hydrogen bonds are formed between the first and the fouh peptide linkages, between the second and fifth peptide linkage and so on. Each peptide linkage in the polypeptide chain paicipates in hydrogen bonding and hydrogen bonds are formed between peptide linkages of same peptide chain. There are 3. 6 amino acids residues in each turn of the helix. The pitch (veical distance per turn) of the helix is 5. 4 Adeg. Each hydrogen bond has nitrogen to oxygen distance (N-0) 2. 8. Adeg. All hydrogen bonds are paralled, i. e., in the same direction. The helix may be right-handed (coils turn in a clockwise fashion around the axis) or left handed (coils turn in anti-clock wise fashion). Right-handed helix are more stable. Right handed a-helix is the commonest secondary structure found in proteins.",

        "question": "A 7 year old boy is referred to a specialty clinic because of digestive problems. He often experiences severe abdominal cramps after eating a high fat meal. He is worked up and diagnosed with a genetic defect resulting in a deficiency of lipoprotein lipase. Which of the following substances would most likely be elevated in this patient's plasma following a fatty meal?",
        "exp": "After eating a high fat meal, triglycerides are processed by the intestinal mucosal cells. They are assembled in chylomicrons and eventually sent into the circulation for delivery to adipocytes and other cells. Chylomicrons are too large to enter cells, but are degraded while in the circulation by lipoprotein lipase. A defect in this enzyme would result in the accumulation of chylomicrons in the plasma. Albumin-bound free fatty acids (choice A) is incorrect because fatty acids leave the intestine esterified as triglycerides in chylomicrons. HDL is not a carrier of dietary fat from the intestine. LDL would be not be elevated in this patient after a high fat meal. However, VLDL would be elevated if the patient ate a high carbohydrate meal. In this situation, the carbohydrate would be conveed into fat in the liver and sent out into circulation as VLDL. VLDL would be unable to be degraded to LDL and, therefore, would accumulate.

HDL concentrations vary reciprocally with plasma triacylglycerol concentrations and directly with the activity of lipoprotein lipase. This may be due to surplus surface constituents, eg, phospholipid and apo A-I, being released during hydrolysis of chylomicrons and VLDL and contributing toward the formation of pre-HDL and discoidal HDL.

Inhibitors of electron transpo chain proper. These inhibitors inhibit the flow of electrons through the respiratory chain. This occurs at following sites. Complex I (NADH to CoQ) is inhibited by: - Barbiturates (amobarbital), Piericidin A (an antibiotic), rotenone (an insectiside), chlorpromazine (a tranquilizer), and guanethidine (an ntihypeensive). These inhibitors block the transfer of reducing equivalents from FeS protein to CoQ. Complex II is inhibited by: - Carboxin and TTFA inhibit transfer of electon from FADH2 to CoQ, whereas malanate competitively inhibit from succinate to complex II. Complex III (Cytochrome b to cytochrome CI) is inhibited by: - Dimercaprol, antimycin A, BAL(British antilewisite), Naphthyloquinone. These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome b to cytochrome. Complex IV (cytochrome C oxidase) is inhibited by: - Carbon monoxide, CN-, H2S and azide (N3-). These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome aa3 to molecular oxygen and therefore can totally arrest cellular respiration. 2. Inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation. These compounds directly inhibit phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. Oligomycin inhibits Fo component of F0F, ATPase. Atractiloside inhibits translocase, a transpo protein that transpos ADP into mitochondria for phosphorylation into ATP. 3. Uncouples. As the name suggests, these componds block the coupeling of oxidation with phosphorylation. These compounds allow the transfer of reducing equivalents in respiratory chain but prevent the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP by uncoupling the linkage between ETC and phosphorylation. Thus the energy instead of being trapped by phosphorylation is dissipated as heat. Uncouplers may be:-Natural:- Thermogenin, thyroxine.

It is an allosteric enzyme and allosterically activated by N-acetyl glutamate. 2) Ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes the formation of citrulline from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine. 3) Argininosuccinate synthase catalyzes the formation of argininosuccinate from citrulline and aspartate. This reaction requires 1. ATP, but 2 high energy phosphate bonds are consumed as ATP is converted to AMP + PPi. The amino group of aspartate provides one of the two nitrogen atoms that appear in urea (The other one is provided by ammonia NH4). 4) Argininosuccinate lyase (argininosuccinase) catalyzes the cleavage of argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate. Fumarate enters in TCA cycle. 5) Arginase catalyzes the formation of urea from arginine by hydrolytic cleavage of arginine to yield urea and ornithine.

In herbivorous animals, intestinal microoganism breakdown these polysaccharides into acetate, propionate and butyrate. These polysaccharides contain 13-glycosidic linkages. Therefore, they cannot be digested by a-amylase present in human saliva and pancreatic juice because a-amylase breaks a-glycosidic bond (especially 1-4 a linkage). So, dietary fibers are not digested or hydrolyzed but are fermented by colonic bacteria except for lignin, which is neither digested nor fermented by intestinal microorganismsdeg. Dietary fibre absorbes water in the intestine, swells, increase bulk of stool by increasing water content of faeces and soften it, decreases transit time by facilitating colonic tansit. \"The presence of fibre shoens the transit timese and increases the stool bulk\". Dietary fibre is of two types: -Soluble fibree: - These are pectin, aliginates, and gums. These absorb upto 15 times its weight in water as it moves through GIT, producing softer stools.
