        "exp": "The DNA methylase offers protection from endonucleolytic attack by the separate restriction enzyme. The descendants of cells that had lost the genes encoding DNA restriction endonucleases appeared unable to modify a sufficient number of recognition sites in their chromosomes to protect them from lethal attack by the remaining restriction enzymes, and consequently died. Hence, the fate of this bacterium which received a gene for for restriction endonuclease will be the same as given above. Restriction endonuclease: Restriction endonucleases cut DNA at specific sites when the bases are not protected (modified, usually, methylation). Bacteria synthesize restriction enzymes as a defense against invading foreign DNAs such as phages and foreign plasmids. Three major types have been recognized. Type I enzymes are single multifunctional proteins of three subunits. Type II enzymes are used most widely for genetic engineering. Type II enzymes have separate endonuclease and methylase proteins. Type III enzymes carry out restriction and modification by two proteins with a shared polypeptide.

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is characterized by gouty ahritis but, in addition, affects the brain, resulting in mental retardation, loss of control of arm/leg/face movements, aggressive behavior, and self-mutilation by biting and scratching. Successful treatment of this disorder is still being sought. Febuxostat has been approved for use in the treatment of chronic hyperuricemia. This drug appears to be more effective than allopurinol in preventing acute attacks of gout and reducing the size of the crystal deposits. Ref: Janson L. W., Tischler M. E. (2012). Chapter 4.

        "question": "Methods of introducing gene in target cells are allexcept:",
        "exp": "FISH Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) is a method to detect or comfirm gene or chromosome abnormalities. It utilizes fluorescently labeled DNA probes. The sample DNA is first denatured (a process that separates the complimentary strands within the DNA double helix structure) then fluorescently labeled probe of interest is added to the denatured sample mixture and hybridizes with the sample DNA at the target site as it reanneals (or reforms itself) back into a double helix. The probe signal can then be seen through a fluorescent microscope and the sample DNA scored for the presence or absence of the signal. Gene therapy is a technique for correcting defective genes responsible for disease development. inseed into a nonspecific location within the genome to replace a nonfunctional gene. A carrier molecule called a vector is used to deliver the therapeutic gene to the patient's target cells. Currently, the most common vector is a virus that has been genetically altered to carry normal human DNA. Besides virus-mediated gene-delivery systems, there are several nonviral options for gene delivery. The simplest method is the direct introduction of therapeutic DNA into target cells. This approach is limited in its application because it can be used only with ceain tissues and requires large amounts of DNA. Transfection is defined as the process of deliberately introducing nucleic acids into cells. The term is used notably for non-viral methods \"Transduction\" is the term often used to describe virus-mediated DNA transfer. Methods of Gene delivery There are various methods of introducing foreign DNA into a eukaryotic cell: some rely on physical treatment (electroporation, nanopaicles, magnetofection), other on chemical materials or biological paicles (viruses) that are used as carriers. Chemical-based transfection Therapeutic DNA can get inside target cells by chemically linking the DNA to a molecule that will bind to special cell receptors. Once bound to these receptors, the therapeutic DNA constructs are engulfed by the cell membrane and passed into the interior of the target cell. Methods used are: a) Calcium phosphate: (This method is dependent upon the use of a calcium chloride-containing HEPES-buffered saline solution to deliver plasmid DNA. HEPES-buffered saline solution (He. BS) containing phosphate ions is combined with a calcium chloride solution containing the DNA to be transfected. When the two are combined, a fine precipitate of the positively charged calcium and the negatively charged phosphate will form, binding the DNA to be transfected on its surface. The suspension of the precipitate is then added to the cells to be transfected (usually a cell culture grown in a monolayer). By a process not entirely understood, the cells take up some of the precipitate, and with it. the DNA.) b) Dendrimers: are highly branched organic compounds. used to bind the DNA and get it into the cell. C) Liposomes: are small, membrane-bounded bodies that are in ways similar to the structure of a cell and can actually fuse with the cell membrane, releasing the DNA into the cell. d) Cationic polymers: such as DEAE-dextran or polyethylenimine. The negatively charged DNA binds to the polycation and the complex is taken up by the cell endocytosis. Non chemical methods a) Electroporation: is a technique by which plasma membrane permeability is transiently increased using a small electric current so that it allows extracellular macromolecules (including DNA) to be taken up into the cell. b) Sonoporation: Similar to electroporation Sonoporation, is the use of sound (typically ultrasonic frequencies) for modifying the permeability of the cell plasma membrane. c). Optical transfection: is a method where a tiny (--1 pm diameter) hole is transiently generated in the plasma membrane of a cell using a highly focused laser. d) Irnpalefection: is a method of gene delivery using nanomaterials, such as carrbon nanofibers, carbon nanolubes, nanowires e). Hydrodynamic delivery: is dependent on the rapid injection of a large aqueous volume containing DNA, RNA or other molecules into the blood vessels. Paicle-based methods Gene gun: A direct approach to transfection is the gene gull, where the DNA is coupled to a nanopaicle of an ine solid (commonly gold) which is then \"shot\" directly into the target cell's nucleus. Magnetofection: or Magnet assisted transfection is a transfection method, which uses magnetic force to deliver DNA into target cells. Nucleic acids are first associated with magnetic nanopaicles. Then, application of magnetic force drives the nucleic acid paicle complexes towards and into the target cells, where the cargo is released.",

        "question": "A 42-year-old man presents to his doctor with complaints of left-sided flank pain radiating into his groin. The pain began suddenly and has increased in intensity. He had a similar problem several years ago, but he did not seek medical attention, and his symptoms resolved spontaneously. He denies fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. He has had no diarrhea or difficulty urinating. Physical examination is remarkable for tenderness along the left flank and into the groin, but is otherwise normal. There are no inguinal hernias detected on examination. A urinalysis reveals microscopic hematuria without casts. Serum chemistry reveals: Sodium: 143 m. Eq/L Potassium: 2. 4 m. Eq/L Bicarbonate: 17 m. Eq/L Chloride: 115 m. Eq/L Blood urea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL Creatinine: 1. 0 mg/dL Glucose: 85 mg/dL Which of the following is MOST likely present in this patient?",
        "exp": "This patient's bicarbonate is lower than the normal range of 22-28 m. Eq/L. This means that there is less bicarbonate in his blood than usual. If his breathing is normal, then his CO2 level should be about normal. Bicarbonate is produced when CO2 binds to an H2O molecule, which then splits into a H+ ion and a HCO3- (bicarbonate) ion. This reaction is governed by an equilibrium constant propoional to the concentrations of the products multiplied together over the concentrations of the reactants multiplied together. By convention, the \"water\" concentration is ignored because it is \"constant. \" So, in order for the equilibrium constant to not change value, the H+ concentration must increase if the bicarbonate decreases and the CO2 remains the same. This means that an acidosis is produced. In this case, it is a metabolic acidosis, since there is no indication of respiratory disease in this patient. Neither a normal acid-base status nor a metabolic alkalosis would have a low bicarbonate. Note: The hallmark of metabolic acidosis is decreased HCO3-. Metabolic acidosis are classified by the anion gap, either normal or increased. The anion gap is the difference between readily measured anions and cations. Ref: Cho K. C. (2013). Chapter 21.

        "exp": "Erythrocytes are the specialized oxygen transpoing cells of the body. As such, they are continuously exposed to an oxidizing environment. These conditions can have profound effects on membrane lipids as a consequence of their attack by peroxides (paicularly hydrogen peroxide) prevalent in this environment. During the reduction of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase, glutathione acts as a donor of the necessary reducing equivalent generating oxidized glutathione. Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide of the structure gamma glutamyl cysteinyl-glycine, where the cysteine sulfhydryl side chains can form a disulfide bond between two molecules (designated as GSSG). To again perform the role of cofactor for glutathione peroxidase, the disulfide bond of GSSG must be reduced. This reaction is catalyzed by glutathione reductase which requires NADPH as a cofactor. Therefore, in order to maintain a red cell membrane structure, erythrocytes utilize the pentose phosphate pathway for the generation of large amounts of NADPH. Erythrocytes are enucleate and therefore do not synthesize DNA and have no need for ribose-5-phosphate. Production of 2, 3- diphosphoglycerate occurs through a side reaction of glycolysis, not the pentose phosphate pathway. The pentose phosphate pathway does not generate ATP or result in the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Ref: Bender D. A., Mayes P. A. (2011). Chapter 21.

Changes in the DNA sequence should be reflected in a change in the m. RNA sequence and, depending on codon usage, in protein sequence. An exceptions to this dogma is, coding information can be changed at the m. RNA level by RNA editing. In such cases, the coding sequence of the m. RNA differs from that in the cognate DNA. An example is the apolipoprotein B (apoB)gene and m. RNA. In liver, the single apo. Bgene is transcribed into an m. RNA that directs the synthesis of a 100-k. Da protein, apo. B100. In the intestine, the same gene directs the synthesis of the primary transcript; however, a cytidine deaminase conves a CAA codon in the m. RNA to UAA at a single specific site. Rather than encoding glutamine, this codon becomes a termination signal, and a 48-k. Da protein (apo. B48) is the result. Apo. B100 and apo. B48 have different functions in the two organs.

This reaction takes place in the mitochondria, but citrate can move freely from the mitochondria into the cytosol. When the citric acid cycle slows down, citrate accumulates. In the cytosol, it acts as a negative allosteric regulator of phosphofructokinase I, the enzyme that catalyzes the committed step of glycolysis. Fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase breaks down fructose-2, 6-bisphosphate, a potent allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase I. Fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase is activated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Isocitrate dehydrogenase conves isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate in the citric acid cycle. It is allosterically stimulated by ADP and inhibited by ATP and NADH. This reaction produces NADH and CO2. Pyruvate carboxylase is a mitochondrial enzyme that conves pyruvate to oxaloacetate. It is impoant in gluconeogenesis and replenishes the oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle. Ref: Bender D. A., Mayes P. A. (2011). Chapter 20. Gluconeogenesis & the Control of Blood Glucose. In D. A.

A major poion of CG (about 20%) in human DNA exists in methylated form. In DNA, methylation usually occurs in the CpG islands, a CG rich region, upstream of the promoter region. In humans, DNA methylation is carried out by a group of enzymes called DNA methyltransferases. DNA methylation stably alters the gene expression pattern in cells such that cells can \"remember where they have been\" or decrease gene expression. DNA methylation is essential for normal development and is associated with a number of key processes including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, suppression of repetitive elements, and carcinogenesis. Adenine or cytosine methylation is pa of the restriction modification system of many bacteria, in which specific DNA sequences are methylated periodically throughout the genome. Within the bacterium, methylation protects the host DNA from cleavage by its own restriction enzyme. Unmethylated foreign DNA is not protected from cleavage.",

        "exp": "The rate of release of FFA from adipose tissue is affected by many hormones that influence either the rate of esterification or the rate of lipolysis. Insulin inhibits the release of FFA from adipose tissue, which is followed by a fall in circulating plasma free fatty acids. Insulin also enhances lipogenesis and the synthesis of acyl-glycerol and increases the oxidation of glucose to CO2 via the pentose phosphate pathway. All of these effects are dependent on the presence of glucose and can be explained, to a large extent, on the basis of the ability of insulin to enhance the uptake of glucose into adipose cells via the GLUT-4 transporter. Another principal action of insulin in adipose tissue is to inhibit the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase, reducing the release not only of FFA, but also of glycerol. Adipose tissue is much more sensitive to insulin than many other tissues, which points to adipose tissue as a major site of insulin action in vivo. Key Concept: Adipose tissue is much more sensitive to insulin than many other tissues, which points to adipose tissue as a major site of insulin action in vivo.

The muscle depends on glycogenolysis for intense exercise, and fatigue rapidly ensues when glycogen is depleted. Patients with a deficiency in the muscle isoform of glycogen phosphorylase (Mc. Ardle disease) can tolerate mild to moderate exercise, but get muscle cramps with strenuous exercise as a consequence of the lack of glycogenolysis in the muscle cell.

Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) is a difference in homologous DNA sequences that can be detected by the presence of fragments of different lengths after digestion of the DNA samples in question with specific restriction endonucleases. RFLP, as a molecular marker, is specific to a single clone/restriction enzyme combination. An RFLP probe is a labeled DNA sequence that hybridizes with one or more fragments of the digested DNA sample after they were separated by gel electrophoresis, thus revealing a unique blotting pattern characteristic to a specific genotype at a specific locus. Sho, single- or low-copy genomic DNA or c. DNA clones are typically used as RFLP probes. RFLPs are visualized by digesting DNA from different individuals with a restriction enzyme, followed by gel electrophoresis to separate fragments according to size, then blotting and hybridization to a labeled probe that identifies the locus under investigation. An RFLP is demonstrated whenever the Southern blot pattern obtained with one individual is different from the one obtained with another individual. Harrison 17/e p390 writes-\"Southern blotting is used to analyze whether genes have been deleted or rearranged. It is also used to detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs). Genornic DNA is digested with restriction endonucleases and separated by gel electrophoresis. Individual. fragments can then be transferred to a membrane and detected after hybridization with specific radioactive DNA probes. Because single base pair mismatches can disrupt the hybridization of sho DNA probes (oligonucleotides), a variation of the Southern blot, termed oligonucleotide-specific hybridization (OSH), uses sho oligonucleotides to distinguish normal from mutant genes. \" RFLP is an impoant tool in genome mapping, localization of genes for genetic disorders, determination of risk for disease, and paternity testing",

        "question": "A competitive inhibitor of an enzyme will?",
        "exp": "Substances that reduce the activity of an enzyme are called inhibitors. Reversible inhibitors bind to an enzyme but rapidly dissociate from it. There are several types of reversible inhibitors: Competitive inhibitors usually resemble the substrate and compete with it for binding at the active site. Thus, increasing the concentration of substrate will decrease the percent inhibition of the enzyme. The Vmax is unchanged, but the Km is increased. A noncompetitive inhibitor binds with equal affinity to both enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex. This binding leads to a distoion of the substrate binding site, so new substrate cannot bind and/or the product cannot be released. In this kind of inhibition, the Vmax is decreased (choice A), but the Km is not altered. Adding more substrate will not reverse this type of inhibition. This is the equivalent of decreasing the turnover number. An uncompetitive inhibitor does not bind to free enzyme, but binds to the enzyme-substrate complex at a site other than the catalytic site. Once bound by the inhibitor, the enzyme is trapped in the enzyme-substrate complex state until the inhibitor dissociates. In this kind of inhibition, the slope of the reaction (which is the ratio Km/Vmax) remains the same, but both Vmax and Km are reduced. Ref: Janson L. W., Tischler M. E. (2012). Chapter 5.

Also Know: In Tay sach's disease gangliosides are found in highest concentration in cells of the nervous system and are normally broken down inside lysosomes by orderly removal of the sugar residues, paly by the action of the enzyme -N-acetylhexosaminidase. When this enzyme is missing or deficient, ganglioside GM2 cannot be broken down and Tay-Sachs disease results. Symptoms of weakness and delayed development of muscle skills are usually evident before the age of 1 year with subsequent blindness and death, usually by the age of 3 years.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Increasing activation energy. Enzymes increase the rate of a biochemical reaction, therefore they are called catalysts of reaction. Now the question arises that how does they do that? In a chemical reaction, the substrate has to be conveed to a higher energy form (called transition form) before it can form the reaction products. The transition state is structurally an intermediate between the substrate and the product, and represents the highest energy arrangement of atoms. Therefore, it is unstable; once formed, it decomposes almost immediately to form the reaction product. So, this high energy intermediate acts as energy barrier, separating the substrates and the products. This barrier, called the free energy of action, is the energy difference between the energy of the substrates and high energy intermediates. In other words, initially some energy must be put into the substrate for conversion into transition state (high-energy intermediate); this is the free energy of activation. The enzymes speed up the chemical reaction by lowering the magnitude of the activation energy barrier, i. e., free energy of activation. Most enzyme-substrate combinations are mostly due to weak non-covalent interactions like hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interactions, ionic (electrostate) interaction and Vander waals forces. However, covalent catalysis involves the formation of a covalent bond between the amino acyl residues of active site of enzyme and substrate. Covalent catalysis is used by serine proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsine) which bind their substrate covalently at serine side chain.",

Carnitine is impoant in transferring fatty acids from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria (the carnitine shuttle). Diacylglycerol is the alcohol common to all phospholipids.

Acute beriberi due to thiamine deficiency is associated with anorexia, vomiting, lactic acidosis, altered heart rate, and cardiomegaly. Acute beriberi mostly seen in infants. In combination with proteins, riboflavin coenzymes, like flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide, function in various dehydrogenation reactions. Deficiency of riboflavin causes cheilosis, glossitis, inflammation of cornea, bloodshot eyes, dimness of vision, photophobia, itching, burning, and dryness of eyes and redness of conjunctiva. Niacin is required for the synthesis of the active forms of vitamin B3, NAD+, and NADP+. Both NAD and NADP function as cofactors for numerous dehydreogenases, e. g. lactate and malate dehydrogenases. Deficiency of niacin causes pellagra characterized by glossitis of the tongue, dermatitis, depression, dementia and diarrhoea.

First, figure out the diagnosis (a classic case of Parkinson's disease), then remember which neurotransmitter is involved in the disease (dopamine), and finally, recall which amino acid serves as the precursor for that neurotransmitter (tyrosine). The hydroxylation of tyrosine by tyrosine hydroxylase results in DOPA, which is then decarboxylated to dopamine. Note that norepinephrine and epinephrine are also tyrosine derivatives, as are the melanins and the thyroid hormones, thyroxine and triiodothyronine. The other answer choices are also precursors of specialized products: Glutamate can be conveed to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA by the action of glutamate decarboxylase. Glycine is involved in the synthesis of both creatine (along with arginine and S-adenosylmethionine) and heme (along with succinyl-CoA). Histidine can be decarboxylated to histamine, an impoant inflammatory mediator. Ref: Beck-Yoo K. (2012). Chapter 19. The Nervous System. In L. W. Janson, M. E.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., UV absorption. Denaturation (melting) of DNADenaturation (melting) refers to separation of the two strands of the DNA into two component strands. When temperature of medium is raised, the hydrogen bonds linking of complementary base pair tends to break. As a result, separation of two strands occur. Melting temperature (Tm) indicates the temperature at which half of the double stranded structure is lost. Normally, Tm is between 85deg C and 95deg C. Since G and C are linked more strongly by three hydrogen bonds, in contrast to two hydrogen bonds linking A and T, G and C linking provides thermostability to DNA. Therefore, DNA molecules having higher GC content have relatively higher Tm. For every 10% increase in GC content, melting temperature increases by 5degC. Simple formula is -Tm (degC ) = 2 (number of AT base pairs) + 4 (number of GC base pairs). In addition to heat, alkali treatment and decrease of salt conentration also cause denatruation. Decrease in salt concentration decreases Tm. Therefore, increase in salt concentration increases DNA duplex stability. Denaturation affects propeies of DNA and these can be used to monitor strand separation -i) Hyperchomicity (hyperchromic effect): DNA bases (purines and pyrimidines) absorb UV light of 260 nm. Upon denaturation, this optical absorbance is increased and is called hyperchromicity of denaturation or hyperchromic effect. ii) Viscosity: Viscosity of the DNA solution decreases on melting (denaturation) because single strands are more flexible than the stiff, resilient double helix. The separated strands of denatured DNA can rejoin on gradual cooling. This is called renaturation or reannealing.",

Branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of branched chain keto amino acids, i. e. leucine, isoleucine and valine.

In osteoclasts involved in bone resorption, CA II apparently provides protons to neutralize the OH- ions left inside the cell when H+ ions are pumped across their ruffled borders. Thus, if CA II is deficient in activity in osteoclasts, normal bone resorption does not occur, and osteopetrosis results.

        "exp": "In general, you should associate hemolytic anemia with defects in glycolysis or the hexose monophosphate shunt (pentose phosphate pathway). Only two enzymes of those listed in the answer choices specifically involve these pathways and cause hemolytic anemia: pyruvate kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6. PD) deficiency is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait, so females would not be affected. Pyruvate kinase is a glycolytic enzyme; pyruvate kinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, affecting males and females approximately equally. If this enzyme is deficient, red cells have trouble producing enough ATP to maintain the Na+/K+ pump on the plasma membrane, secondarily causing swelling and lysis. Debranching enzyme defects produce Cori's disease, one of the glycogen storage diseases. Defects in glucose-6-phosphatase produce Von Gierke's disease, one of the glycogen storage diseases. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency produces an X-linked hemolytic anemia.",

Normal values are The most common causes of increased red cell protoporphyrin levels are absolute or relative iron deficiency and lead poisoning. Under steady-state conditions, the serum ferritin level correlates with total body iron stores; thus, the serum ferritin level is the most convenient laboratory test to estimate iron stores. The TIBC (Total Iron Binding Capacity) is an indirect measure of the circulating transferrin. The normal range for the serum iron is 50-150 g/dL; the normal range for TIBC is 300-360 g/dL. Transferrin saturation, which is normally 25-50%, is obtained by the following formula: serum iron x 100 / TIBC. Iron-deficiency states are associated with saturation levels below 20%.

Being highly toxic, ammonia should be eliminated or detoxified, as and when it is formed. Even very minute quantity of ammonia may produce toxicity in central nervous system. But, ammonia is always produced by almost all cells, including neurons. The intracellular ammonia is immediately trapped by glutamic acid to form glutamine, especially in brain cells. The glutamine is then transpoed to liver, where the reaction is reversed by the enzyme glutaminase. The ammonia thus generated is immediately detoxified into urea. Aspaic acid may also undergo similar reaction to form asparagine. 2. Transpoation of Ammonia. Inside the cells of almost all tissues, the transamination of amino acids produce glutamic acid. However, glutamate dehydrogenase is available only in the liver. Therefore, the final deamination and production of ammonia is taking place in the liver. Thus, glutamic acid acts as the link between amino groups of amino acids and ammonia. The concentration of glutamic acid in blood is 10 times more than other amino acids. Glutamine is the transpo forms of ammonia from brain and intestine to liver; while alanine is the transpo form from muscle. 3. Final disposal. The ammonia from all over the body thus reaches liver. It is then detoxified to urea by liver cells, and then excreted through kidneys. Urea is the end product of protein metabolism.",

A TATA box is a DNA sequence that indicates the point at which a genetic sequence can be read and decoded. Transcription: Transcription is the process by which DNA is copied (transcribed) to m. RNA, which carries the information needed for protein synthesis. Transcription takes place in two broad steps. First, pre-messenger RNA is formed, with the involvement of RNA polymerase enzymes. Second formation of Messenger RNA. Transcription unit: is a linear sequence of DNA that extends from a transcription sta site to a transcription stop site. The transcription unit--that poion of a gene that is copied by RNA polymerase--consists of coding regions of DNA (exons) interrupted by intervening sequences of noncoding DNA (introns). After transcription, during RNA processing, introns are removed and the exons are ligated together to form the mature m. RNA that appears in the cytoplasm. 1) Transcription Steps: There are three main steps to the process of DNA transcription. Initiation: RNA Polymerase Binds to DNA. DNA is transcribed by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. Specific nucleotide sequences tell RNA polymerase where to begin and where to end. RNA polymerase attaches to the DNA at a specific area called the promoter region. Elongation: Ceain proteins called transcription factors unwind the DNA strand and allow RNA polymerase to transcribe only a single strand of DNA into a single stranded RNA polymer called messenger RNA (m. RNA). The strand that serves as the template is called the antisense strand. The strand that is not transcribed is called the sense strand. Termination: RNA polymerase moves along the DNA until it reaches a terminator sequence. At that point, RNA polymerase releases the m. RNA polymer and detaches from the DNA. 2) Pre m. RNA processing: RNA splicing: pre-m. RNAs typically include introns. Exons: are the continuous coding regions. Introns: are the noncoding intervening sequences. They may serve to separate functional domains (exons) of coding information in a form that permits genetic rearrangement by recombination to occur more rapidly than if all coding regions for a given genetic function were contiguous. Introns are removed by RNA processing in which the intron is looped out and cut away from the exons by sn. RNPs, and the exons are spliced together to produce the translatable m. RNA.

So an enzyme stimulated by glucagon might be involved in either the breakdown of glycogen to glucose (glycogenolysis) or in the creation of glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors (gluconeogenesis). Glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the first step in glycogenolysis; it makes sense that it would be stimulated by glucagon. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes the first step in fatty acid synthesis, an anabolic process that would be stimulated by insulin, not glucagon. As its name implies, glycogen synthase is involved in the synthesis of glycogen. Glucagon (and epinephrine) stimulate the phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase. HMG-CoA reductase is the key enzyme involved in the synthesis of cholesterol. Since this is an anabolic process that occurs in the well-fed state, you would expect it to be stimulated by insulin and inhibited by glucagon (which it is). Ref: Bender D. A., Mayes P. A. (2011).

It may go unrecognized until middle life. Mental retardation is usually seen in all the other 3 options. (Mental retardation not seen in Alkaptonuria). Alkaptonuria Triad of: - Homogentisic aciduria - Black pigmentation of cailage and collagenous tissue (ochronosis) - Ochronotic ahritis It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of tyrosine catabolism. There is deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase which results in the accumulation of homogentisic acid pigment cailages and collagenous tissues (ochronosis). Large amount of homogentisic acid is excreted in urine which gets oxidised on exposure to air and impas urine a dark colour especially if the pH of urine is alkaline. Alkaptonuria is usually recognised by 30-40 yrs of age when degenerative joint disease and ochronosis (pigmentation) become noticeable. Ochronosis ahritis commonly involves shoulder, hips and knees. The interveebral discs are degenerated, spaces are narrowed and calcification occurs. Ochronosis or pigmentation can involve- heart valves, larynx, tympanic membrane, sclera, ear cailage and skin. Occasionally pigmented renal or prostatic calculi can occur. Homogentisic acid (HGA) is a strong reducing agent and gives positive reaction with Benedict's & Fehling's reagent. A greenish brown precipitate with brownish black supernatant develops with Benedict's reagent and transient blue green colour develops with Fehling's (Fe. C13) reagent. The diagnosis is confirmed by measurement of HGA concentration in urine by paper and thin layer chromatography. Low protein diet especially low in phenylalanine and tyrosine is advocated in combination with ascorbic acid, but not very effective. Addition of nitisinone (an inhibitor of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase which catalyzes the formation of homogentisic acid) drastically reduces urinary excretion of homogentisic acid might prevent the long term complication of alkaptonuria.",

Increased levels of Fructose 2, 6 - Bisphosphate- Decreased concentration of glucose in blood & liver causes increased glucagon secretion (ki glucagon / insulin ratio) leading to glycogenolysis followed by gluconeogenesis in liver. Increased levels of glucagon activates c-AMP dependent protein kinase which inturn activates F2, 6 BPase (fructose 2, 6 biphosphatase or FBpase 2) and inactivates phosphofructokinase (PFK)-2 leading to conversion of F2, 6 BP (Fructose 2, 6 biphosphatse) to fructose 6 phosphate. So the concentration of F2, 6 BP is decreasedQ and fructose 6 phosphate is increased which is conveed to glucose.- Gluconeogenesis in fasting state is indicated by acetyl CoA induced instantaneous allosteric activation of hepatic pyruvate carboxylase.- Phosphofructokinase I takes pa in glycolysis and FBPase 1 in gluconeogenesis, by catalyzing the formation & breakdown of fructose 1, 6 biphosphate respectively. Whereas bifunctional enzyme phosphor fructo kinase 2 (PK-2) also has fructose 2, 6 biphosphatase (FBP ase 2 or F 2, 6 pase) activity and plays a unique role in regulation of both glycolysis & gluconeogenesis by determining the levels of fructose 2, 6 bihosphateQ.- Fructose 2, 6 bihosphate (F2, 6. BP) is the most potent allosteric activator of PFK-1 (thereby increase glycolysis) and inhibitor of fructose 1, 6 biphosphatase /FBP ase 1/ Fl, 6 pase (thereby decreasing gluconegenesis) in liverQ. The reciprocal action of fructose 2, 6 bi. PO4, on glycolysis and gluconeogenesis ensure that both pathways, is not fully active at same time. Therefore, decreased sensitivity of FBP ase 1 to regulation (inhibition) by fructose 2, 6 biphosphate increases gluconeogenesis; thereby decreasing levels of fructose 1, 6 biphosphate, pyruvate and ATPQ.- Fructose 1, 6 biphosphate is under negative feed back control of fructose 2, 6 biphosphateQ. If fructose 1, 6 biphasphatase becomes less sensitive to the negative feed back of fructose 2, 6 bi. PO4, its level of activity will increase. Thus more fructose 1, 6 bi. PO4 will be cleaved into fructose 6-PO4 and levels of fructose 1, 6 bi. PO4 will decrease and be lower than normal. The cycle will be shifted more toward gluconeogenesis. Less ATP would be generated Wt decreased glycolysisQ. Glycogenic capability of cell is determined by presence (activation) of fructose 1, 6 biphosphataseQ. The conversion of fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate to fructose6-phosphate, to achieve a reversal of glycolysis, is catalyzed by fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase. Its presence determines whether or not a tissue is capable of synthesizing glycogen not only from pyruvate but also from triosephosphates. It is present in liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle but is probably absent from heart and smooth muscle. In well fed state gluconeogenesis in liver is inhibited by ADPQ.",

This energy is coupled to the formation of ATP molecules by phosphorylation of ADP by an enzyme F0. F1 ATPase. The phosphorylation of ADP into ATP is coupled with oxidation of reducing equivalents, therefore the process is called oxidative phosphorylation. There are three ATP synthesizing sites of electron transpo chain: (i) Site 1 is between NAD and CoQ, i. e., Complex I; (ii) Site II is between CoQ and cytochrome C, i. e., Complex III; and (iii) Site III is between cytochrome C and oxygen, i. e., complex IV. These sites provide energy required to make ATP from ADP by an enzyme Fo. Fi. ATPase. The energy liberated of site I (complex I) is used to synthesize 1 ATP molecule, at site II (complex III) is used to synthesize 1 ATP molecule and at site III (Complex IV) is used to synthesize 1/2 ATP molecule. Thus, when 1 NADH molecule enters the respiratory chain, it produce 2. 5 molecules of ATP. When 1 molecule of FADH2 enters the respiratory chain only 1. 5 molecules of ATP are produced as site I of energy liberation is bypassed. Note: Previously it was assumed the NADH produces 3 ATPs and FAD generates 2 ATPs. Recent experiments show that these old values are overestimates and NADH produces 2. 5 ATPs and FADH2 produces 1. 5 ATPs.",

In nephelometry, the intensity of the scattered light is measured, usually, but not necessarily, at right angles to the incident light beam. The intensity of the scattered radiation depends on several factors, including the wavelength of the incident radiation and the paicle size; however, in a given system, the scattering is directly propoional to the concentration of the paiculate matter.",

Both glycine and aspartic acid can destabilize a-helix. However, glycine is much more destabilizing than aspartic acid (aspartate). Amino acids destabilizing the alpha helix Proline is never found in a-helix. The peptide bond of nitrogen of proline lacks a hydrogen atom to contribute hydrogen bond (proline is imino acid:- NH, not amino -NH2). When incorporated in this structure, it causes the chain to bend sharply (as at that level stabilizing hydrogen bond is not available). This disrupts regular helical conformation. Proline can only be stably accommodated within the first turn of an a-helix. Glycine also tends to disrupt \u03b1-helix. Because of its high conformational flexibility and small size, it often induces bends in \u03b1-helices. Amino acids with charged R-groups (i. e. charged amino acids):- They interfere with the formation of \u03b1-helix because of electrostatic (ionic) attraction between the charged groups. These amino acids are:- Positively charged (basic):- Histidine, arginine, lysine Negatively charged (acidic):- Aspartate (aspartic acid), glutamate (glutamic acid) Amino acid with bulky R group due to branch at \u03b2-carbon:- They destabilize \u03b1-helix because side chain of these amino acids projects out of the plane of the main a-helix chain. These amino acids are isoleucine and valine. Amino acids whose side chain can form hydrogen bond:- These amino acids disrupt \u03b1-helix by acting as a competitor of the main hydrogen donor and acceptors. These amino acids are serine, asparagine, and threonine. You should make it clear in your mind that destabilizing property of amino acid does not mean that they cannot occur in \u03b1-helix. They have a different propensity for \u03b1-helix. For example, proline can never occur in \u03b1-helix as it cannot form a hydrogen bond, the major stabilizing force in \u03b1-helix. Glycine is also not commonly found as it is too small and induces bends in a-helix. Other amino acids destabilize \u03b1-helix when present in large numbers. Propensity of \u03b1-helix (higher the number less the chance to be found in \u03b1-helix) Alanine (0. 0) > Leucine (0. 21) = arginine (0. 21)> Methionine (0. 24) > Lysine (0. 26) > glutamine (0. 39) > glutamic acid (0. 40) > isoleucine (0. 41) > tryptophan (0. 49) > serine (0. 5) > tyrosine (0. 53) > phenylalanine (0. 54) > valine = histidine (0. 61) > aspargine (0. 65) > threonine (0. 66) > cysteine (0. 68) > aspartic acid (0. 69) > glycine (1) > proline (3. 16).

In patients with normal dentition, gum changes (swelling, bleeding, loosening of teeth) are also noted. Without supplementation with vitamin C, death may eventually occur.

Under normal conditions, this enzyme cleaves N- acetylgalactosamine from the oligosaccharide chain of this complex sphingolipid, allowing fuher catabolism to occur.

The former is an intermediate stage in metabolism of simple sugars, such as glucose. Through lipogenesis, the energy can be efficiently stored in the form of fats. Lipogenesis encompasses the processes of fatty acid synthesis and subsequent triglyceride synthesis (when fatty acids are esterified with glycerol to form fats). The products are secreted from the liver in the form of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Fatty acids synthesis stas with acetyl-CoA and builds up by the addition of two carbon units. The synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm in contrast to the degradation (oxidation), which occurs in the mitochondria. Many of the enzymes for the fatty acid synthesis are organized into a multienzyme complex called fatty acid synthetase. Control and regulation. Insulin is an indicator of the blood sugar level of the body, as its concentration increases propoionally with blood sugar levels. Thus, a large insulin level is associated with the fed state. As one might expect, therefore, it increases the rate of storage pathways, such as lipogenesis. Insulin stimulates lipogenesis in two main ways: The enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which forms acetyl-CoA, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which forms malonyl-CoA, are obvious control points.

Plasmids are circular segments of DNA, which are independent of the chromosomes and capable of replication thus producing multiple copies. When the bacterial cell divides, the plasmids are split between the two daughter cells. These daughter cells then produce more plasmids which are then passed on to their daughter cells, etc. With cells dividing as fast as every 20 minutes, a bacterium containing human DNA encoding insulin will, in a relatively short time, produce many millions of similar cells (clones) containing the same human gene. These bacteria containing insulin gene are then grown under conditions that will lead to optimal insulin production. The insulin is then collected, isolated, and purified. The process begins with obtaining a human DNA containing the insulin gene. Isolation of a specific gene from the human DNA is a laborious process. It is thus easier to start the process by obtaining insulin m. RNA from the beta cells of the pancreas where insulin is being produced in abundance. A complementary copy of DNA (c. DNA) containing the insulin gene is then produced from the insulin m. RNA using reverse transcriptase technology. This c. DNA is then cloned by inserting into the plasmid vector.",
