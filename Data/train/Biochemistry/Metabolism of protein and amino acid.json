        "exp": "The NH3 production is greatly increased in metabolic acidosis and negligible in alkalosis. It is also observed that activity of renal glutaminase is enhanced in acidosis. The NH3 mechanism is a valuable device for the conservation of fixed base. Under normal conditions, 30 to 50 m. Eq of H+ ions are eliminated per day, by combination with NH3 and about 10 to 30 m. Eq, as titratable acid, i. e. buffered with PO4. Ammonia Mechanism A third mechanism operates in the distal renal tubule cells, for the elimination of H+ ions and the conservation of Na+, by production of NH3 by the renal tubular epithelial cells. Source of NH3 in Distal Tubular Epithelial Cells 1. NH3 is produced by the hydrolysis of Glutamine by the enzyme Glutaminase which is present in these cells. 2. In addition to above, if the cells require NH3 more *NH3 can also be formed from other amino acids by oxidative deamination by L-amino acid oxidase. *NH3 can also be formed from glycine by glycineoxidase. The NH3 thus formed forms NH+4 ions by combining with H+ ions and NH+4 ions can exchange Na+ ion from Na. Cl. NH+4 ions formation *NH3 can diffuse into the tubular filtrate and there forms NH+4 ions in combination with H+ ions. *NH3 can combine with H+ ions inside the cells and then NH+4 ions come into tubular filtrate. This probably is not the principal mechanism as NH+4 ions are less SECTION FIVE readily permeable to tubular epithelial cells (Fig. 41. 4). Ref: M. N.

Laboratory tests revealed mild anemia with profound lymphocytopenia, and hypogammaglobulinemia. adenosine deaminase (ADA) enzyme activities were low. What is the diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Based on the above clinical scenerio, the diagnosis is Severe combined immunodeficiency. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), is a genetic disorder in which both \"arms\" (B cells and T cells) of the adaptive immune system are impaired due to a defect in one of several possible genes Types of SCID X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency Adenosine deaminase deficiency Omenn syndrome Bare lymphocyte syndrome JAK3 Aemis/DCLRE1C X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency Most cases of SCID are due to mutations in the gene encoding the common gamma chain (gc), a protein that is shared by the receptors for interleukins These interleukins and their receptors are involved in the development and differentiation of T and B cells. The common gamma chain is encoded by the gene IL-2 receptor gamma, or IL-2. Rg, which is located on the X-chromosome. For this reason, immunodeficiency caused by mutations in IL-2. Rg is known as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. The condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. Adenosine deaminase deficiency: The second most common form of SCID after X-SCID is caused by a defective enzyme, adenosine deaminase (ADA), necessary for the breakdown of purines. Lack of ADA causes accumulation of d. ATP. The effectiveness of the immune system depends upon lymphocyte proliferation and hence d. NTP synthesis. Without functional ribonucleotide reductase, lymphocyte proliferation is inhibited and the immune system is compromised. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency An autosomal recessive disorder involving mutations of the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) gene. PNP is a key enzyme in the purine salvage pathway. Impairment of this enzyme causes elevated d. GTP levels resulting in T-cell toxicity and deficiency. Symptoms and diagnosis of SCID: Children with SCID are at risk for life-threatening infections. From their first months of life, they have infections that may be frequent, severe, long-lasting or hard to treat. Infections may occur in the lungs (pneumonia), around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) or in the blood stream. The delay in detection is because newborns carry their mothers antibodies for the first few weeks of life and SCID babies look normal. treatment for SCID: bone marrow transplantation, Transduction of the missing gene to hematopoietic stem cells using viral vectors is being tested in ADA SCID and X-linked SCID gene therapy Reference: Harpers illustrated biochemistry 30th edition",

They include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, scrapie in sheep, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) in cattle. It is recognized that prion diseases are protein conformation diseases transmitted by altering the conformation, and hence the physical propeies, of proteins endogenous to the host. Human prion-related protein (PrP), a glycoprotein encoded on the sho arm of chromosome 20, normally is monomeric and rich in a helix. Pathologic prion proteins serve as the templates for the conformational transformation of normal PrP, known as Pr. Pc, into Pr. Psc. Since one pathologic prion or prion-related protein can serve as a template for the conformational transformation of many times its number of Pr. Pc molecules, prion diseases can be transmitted by the protein alone without the involvement of DNA or RNA.

About 5% of the weight of the cell membrane is carbohydrates; the carbohydrate groups cover the entire surface of the cell membrane, they are called glycocalyx. Functions include their role as enzymes, hormones, transpo proteins, structural proteins and receptors. iii. Glycophorin is the major membrane glycoprotein of erythrocytes.

It is composed of repeating units of N-Acetyl-glucosamine - beta-1, 4-Glucuronic acid - beta-1-3-N-Acetyl glucosamine and so on. 2. Heparin i. It is an anticoagulant widely used when taking blood in vitro for clinical studies. It is also used in vivo in suspected thrombo-embolic conditions to prevent intravascular coagulation. It activates antithrombin III, which in turn inactivates thrombin, factor X, and factor IX. ii. Heparin is present in liver, lungs, spleen, and monocytes. Commercial preparation of heparin is from animal lung tissues. iii. It contains repeating units of sulphated glucosamine - alpha-1, 4-L-iduronic acid - and so on. (Fig. 6. 24).

These BCAAs and their corresponding a-keto acids accumulate in the blood, causing a toxic effect that interferes with brain functions. The disease is characterized by feeding problems, vomiting, ketoacidosis, changes in muscle tone, neurologic problems that can result in coma (primarily due to the rise in leucine), and a characteristic maple syrup-like odor of the urine due to the rise in isoleucine. If untreated, the disease is fatal. If treatment is delayed, intellectual disability results. 1. Classification: The term \"maple syrup urine disease\" includes a classic type and several variant forms of the disorder. The classic, neonatal-onset form is the most common type of MSUD. Leukocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts from these patients show little or no BCKD activity. Infants with classic MSUD show symptoms within the first several days of life. If not diagnosed and treated, classic MSUD is lethal in the first weeks of life. Patients with intermediate forms have a higher level of enzyme activity (up to 30% of normal). The symptoms are milder and show an onset from infancy to adolescence. Patients with the rare thiamine-dependent variant of MSUD respond to large doses of this vitamin. 2. Screening and diagnosis: As with PKU, prenatal diagnosis and neonatal screening are available, and most affected individuals are compound heterozygotes. 3. Treatment: MSUD is treated with a synthetic formula that is free of BCAAs, supplemented with limited amounts of leucine, isoleucine, and valine to allow for normal growth and development without producing toxic levels. Early diagnosis and lifelong dietary treatment is essential if the child with MSUD is to develop normally.",

        "question": "If cellular proteins do not fold into a specific conformation, their function is affected. Ceain disorders arise if specific proteins are misfolded. Which of the following disorders arises due to conformational isomerization?",
        "exp": "Human Prion Diseases Prion diseases in human beings are Kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSSD) (familial CJD) and fatal familial insomnia (FFI). Cerebral coex becomes sponge-like in CJD. Thalamus is affected in FFI. In Kuru, cerebellum is affected. It is seen in Fore aborigines in Papua New Guinea. The term \"Kuru\" means \"laughing death\" in the tribal language. Baruch Blumberg showed that the disease was transmitted by ritual cannibalism (eating of brain of dead person); Carleton Gajdusek isolated the \"unconventional virus\" from the affected individuals; both of them were awarded Nobel Prize in 1976 PRIONS The central dogma in molecular biology postulated by Watson and Crick in 1953 was that genetic information passes from DNA to RNA and then to protein. In general, this rule still holds good. In 1970, Temin and Baltimore showed that DNA could be synthesized from RNA by reverse transcriptase. This has paly shattered the central dogma. But could proteins act as an information molecule? Could proteins replicate themselves? This question was considered to be heretical till a few years ago, but no longer so. There are a few diseases characterized by very long incubation period of many years. These \"slow disease agents\" were originally thought to be \"unconventional viruses\", but now they are proved as prion proteins. Prion Proteins: Abnormal Teiary Structure \"Prions\" is the acronym for \"proteinaceous infective paicles\". Stanley Prusiner has described prion proteins (PrP) in 1982, who was awarded Nobel Prize in 1997. PrP is a normal protein of 253 amino acids, found in leukocytes and nerve cells. The matured prion protein (PrP) has 210 amino acids. It exists as asialoglycoprotein, anchored on the cell surface. PrP molecules can undergo a change in structural conformation. The altered molecule is resistant to heat and proteolytic enzymes. The abnormal protein is called Pr. Psc; \"sc\" stands for scrapie, the disease in which it was first isolated. Thus, prions are proteins with correct primary structure, but with abnormal teiary structure. The PrP is in alpha-helical form, but Pr. PSc is in beta-pleated sheets (Fig. 52. 9). Protein folding occurs in a stepwise process. As the polypeptide is being synthesized by the ribosome, the initial segment of protein stas to fold. That in turn ors only ceain folding in the next pa of the protein. By this time, hydrophobic regions aggregate into interior of the protein molecule. Chaperons (Chapter 41) also help in the formation of correct folding of proteins. This process is orderly. Minor alterations in the process may alter the teiary structure. Abnormal Proteins can be infectious A normal gene makes the normal PrP protein. Disease is produced when the gene is mutated or if an abnormal Pr. Psc is injected or ingested. The \"Seeding Model\" explains that the infectious prion induces the nearby normal protein molecules to unfold to abnormal form. It is similar to the conversion of the good \"Dr. Jekyll\" to the criminal \"Mr. Hyde\" (same person with two personalities, described in the famous novel). These abnormal proteins now conve fuher normal proteins into abnormal varieties, producing a \"chain reaction\" that generates new infectious materials. Pathogenesis of Prion Diseases The lysosomal enzymes could break down the normal PrP; but Pr. Psc cannot be digested. Hence, the prions are accumulated inside the cells, and eventually the cell dies. One pa of prion protein can cause apoptosis (programmed cell death), which also leads to loss of cells. As a group, they are also called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSF), because the brain becomes riddled with small holes like a sponge. Neurons degenerate, protein deposits may accumulate as plaques and glial cells grow larger. Clinically, rapidly progressive dementia sets in with neurological defects and ataxia. All the prion diseases are slowly progressive, but eventually become fatal. Ref: DM Vasudevan - Textbook of Biochemistry, 6th edition, page no: 588 & 589",

The negative charges of SDS will cover the protein molecules, making them strongly negative. Then the separation of molecules will depend mainly on their molecular size.

The alanine is transpoed through the bloodstream to the liver, where it reacts with a-ketoglutarate to reform Pyruvate and glutamate. This reaction is catalysed by alanine transaminase. 3. The nitrogen originating from the glutamate is processed by the urea cycle. 4. When the blood glucose is low, the Pyruvate resulting from alanine transamination is used to make glucose the gluconeogenesis pathway. 5. The glucose can be returned to the skeletal muscle to supply quick energy. Thus, the transpo of alanine from muscle to Liver results in a reciprocal transfer of glucose to muscle. The entire cyclical process is referred to as the \"glucose-alanine cycle\" (Fig. 27. 5). Its impoance is propoional to the muscular activity of the organism.
