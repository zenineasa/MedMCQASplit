        "exp": "HDL Good and Bad cholesterol terminology was used earlier. Now these terms 'good' & 'bad' cholesterol are discarded. HDL was called good cholesterol because of reverse cholesterol transpo i. e. it takes cholesterol from peripheral tissue to liver. HDL conves this cholesterol into cholesterol ester with the help of enzyme LCAT-Lecithin Cholesterol Acyl Transferase. This enzyme transfers fatty acid from lecithin (a phospholipid) to cholesterol. Lecithin after losing fatty acid becomes lysolecithin (See fig below).",

When the amount of cellular cholesterol is adequate, SREBP remains inactive in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bound to SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP). Binding of SCAP to SREBP is facilitated by another transmembrane protein known as Insig (Insulin induced gene). SCAP is a cholesterol sensor. When cholesterol levels fall, SCAP escos SREBP to the Golgi complex In golgi, SREBP is cleaved by proteases. This releases the DNA-binding domain of SREBP which can go to nucleus and increase the HMG-CoA reductase transcription. Insig1 helps in degradation of HMG-CoA reductase by ubiquitin degradation system (Option 3 is true).
