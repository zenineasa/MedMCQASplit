The Fc poion of an antibody molecule is the pa of the immunoglobulin that attaches to the Fcreceptors on phagocytic cell surfaces. When a Fab poion of the antibody is attached to the pathogen and the Fc attaches to the phagocytic cell surface, the phagocyte can destroy the pathogen more efficiently. The IgG molecule is an immunoglobulin that reacts with the antigen after it has been destroyed and presented to the T cell. The IgG immunoglobulin is never involved in antigen presentation. In the endogenous antigen presentation pathway (eg, a virus infecting a cell), the cell would display epitopes from the virus in association with class I molecules to the CD8+ cytotoxic T cell.

        "question": "A 30 year old veterinarian visits her obstetrician for a first-trimester prenatal check-up. She has no complaints. Routine physical exam is significant only for mild cervical lymphadenopathy. She is prescribed spiramycin but is noncompliant. Her baby is born with hydrocephalus and cerebral calcifications. Which of the following organisms is most likely responsible?",
        "exp": "Humans become infected with Toxoplasma gondii by ingesting cysts in contaminated food or through contact with cat feces. The veterinarian in question was therefore paicularly at risk of infection. T. gondii is especially hazardous in pregnant women because the organism can be transmitted to the fetus through the placenta. (It is pa of the To. RCHeS group of congenital infections; Toxoplasma, Rubella, CMV, Herpes/HIV, Syphilis). Since infected mothers are usually asymptomatic, cases often go unnoticed. Occasionally, patients present with cervical lymphadenopathy, as did the veterinarian, and require treatment to prevent complications in the fetus. Though newborns are also often asymptomatic, they are at risk for developing the classic triad of chorioretinitis (at bih or later in life), hydrocephalus, and cerebral calcifications. Note that T. gondii is also a common cause of CNS infections (e. g., encephalitis) in HIV-positive patients. Isospora belli (choice A) is an intestinal protozoan that causes watery diarrhea, paicularly in the immunocompromised. Fecal-oral transmission of oocysts allows invasion of small intestinal mucosa, destroying the brush border. Leishmania donovani (choice B) causes kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis), which is characterized by fever, weakness, weight loss, splenomegaly, and skin hyperpigmentation. It is prevalent in regions of the Mediterranean, Middle East, Russia, and China. The vector is the sandfly. Plasmodium vivax (choice C) causes malaria and is transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito, which introduces sporozoites into the blood. These differentiate into merozoites that destroy erythrocytes. Splenomegaly ensues. Other species of this organism also cause malaria: P. malariae and P. falciparum (which causes a more severe form of the disease). Note that sickle cell trait confers resistance to this disease.

Patients with decreased gastric acidity, sickle cell disease, defects in immunity, or children younger than 4 years have a more severe course of disease. Salmonella spp. are carried in nature by animal reservoirs such as poultry, tules, cattle, pigs, and sheep. The incubation period is 8-48 hours after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Chlamydia psittaci produces an interstitial pneumonitis accompanied by headache, backache, and a dry, hacking cough. A pale, macular rash is also found on the trunk (Horder's spots). Patients at risk include pet shop workers, pigeon handlers, and poultry workers. Entamoeba histolytica produces a diarrhea (frequently bloody or heme-positive), right lower quadrant crampy abdominal pain, and fever. Patients frequently have weight loss and anorexia. There is usually a history of travel outside the U. S. Most cases are chronic. Complications include liver abscesses. Staphylococcus aureus produces a self-limited gastroenteritis due to the production of preformed, heat-stable enterotoxins. The incubation period is 16 hours.

Strongyloides has a cycle of autoinfection. Here the rhabditiform larvae mature into the infective third stage larvae during their passage down the gut. These filariform larvae cause reinfection by piercing the perianal and perineal skin during defecation. The larvae wander in the dermis of the perianal region for some time, causing a radiating perianal creeping eruption, a form of cutaneous larva migrans. They ultimately enter the lymphatics or venules and are carried to the right hea and the lungs to complete the life cycle as above. This ability to cause autoinfection explains the persistence of the infection in patients for long periods, even 30-40 years after leaving the endemic areas. Some of the organisms where autoinfection occurs are Strongyloides stercoralis, Enterobius vermicularis, Taenia solium, and Hymenolepis nana. Ref: Textbook of Medical Parasitology, 5th Ed, Page 161",

The virus can not be cultured but can be cloned in Escherichia coli. It is the commonest cause of post transfusion hepatitis and chronic hepatitis. Incubation period is 50 days (15 - 160 days). Modes of transmission of HCV are:? Blood transfusion: Most common mode of transmission and HCV is the most common cause of post-transfusion hepatitis. Percutaneous transmission: By needle punctures. Perinatal transmission: Transmission appears to be a function of the degree of maternal viremia which is detected by PCR for HCV RNA. Sexual transmission. Among hepatitis viruses, HCV has the maximum propensity for chronic hepatitis and chronic carrier state. It can also cause cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The most common indication for liver transplantation currently is cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis'C' infection. HCV usually does not cause acute liver failure (vary rare with HCV) Extrahepatic manifestation with HCV infection may be essential mixed cryoglobulinemia (more than HBV), porphyria cutanea tarda, pulmonary fibrosis and ntembrano-proliferative GN.

Septicum and Cl. novyi Crepitus A sound can be created when two rough surfaces in the human body come into contact-- for example, in osteoahritis or rheumatoid ahritis when the cailage around joints has eroded away and the joint ends grind against one another When the fracture surfaces of two broken bones rub together, it produces a sound. Crepitus is a common sign of bone fracture. In soft tissues, crepitus can be produced when gas is introduced into an area where it normally isn't present. The term can also be used when describing the sounds produced by lung conditions such as interstitial lung disease--these are also referred to as \"rales\". Crepitus is often loud enough to be heard by the human ear, although a stethoscope may be needed to detect instances caused by respiratory diseases. In times of poor surgical practice, post-surgical complications involved anaerobic infection by Clostridium perfringens strains, which can cause gas gangrene in tissues, also giving rise to crepitus. Subcutaneous crepitus (or surgical emphysema) is a crackling sound resulting from subcutaneous emphysema, or air trapped in the subcutaneous tissues. Subcutaneous emphysema/ SCE/ SE/ Tissue emphysema/ Sub Q air It occurs when gas or air is present in the subcutaneous layer of the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the cutis of the skin, and emphysema refers to trapped air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where it is able to travel from the chest cavity along the fascia. Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch, a sensation that has been described as similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air under the skin is known as subcutaneous crepitation.",

Prevention Two types of vaccine: Inactivated (salk) injectable polio vaccine. Oral (sabin) live attenuated vaccine: It provides both local immunity (by producing intestinal IgA) and systemic immunity. Vaccine progeny is excreted in feces and secondary spread occurs to household contacts so non immunized persons are immunized by replacing wild strain by vaccine strain.

        "question": "Chloramphenicol resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is due to:",
        "exp": "Bacteria have evolved in various ways to counter the toxic propeies of antimicrobial agents. These are the following: i. Inactivation of the antimicrobial drug Resistance to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics in many bacteria is due to production of an enzyme beta-lactamase, which inactivates the antimicrobial agent. Genes encoding betalactamases may be present on chromosome or plasmid. These genes may be constitutively expressed or induced by a beta-lactam antibiotic. Such form of resistance is seen in S. aureus, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae etc. Aminoglycoside modifying enzymes destroy the drug by adenylylating, phosphorylating, or acetylating them. The genes encoding for aminoglycoside modifying enzymes are usually found on plasmids and transposons. This type of resistance is seen in members of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobactersps, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, Campylobacterjejuni etc. ii. Alteration of the antimicrobial target As a result of mutation, the targets of the antimicrobial agents get lost or altered. Sometimes, the existing target may be replaced by an entirely novel protein. Resistances to penicillins/cephalosporins in MRSA, S. pneumoniae or enterococci are often to due to production of altered/novel penicillin binding proteins. Methylation of 23S ribosomal RNA renders the receptor on 50S subunit altered, thereby preventing the binding of erythromycin. Mutations in the 30S subunit of the ribosome interfere with ribosomal binding of streptomycin. Methylation of a single adenine in the bacterial 50s ribosome can lead to resistance against macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B in S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. iii. Adaptation of alternative metabolic pathway Some sulfonamide-resistant bacteria do not require extracellular PABA but, like mammalian cells, can utilize preformed folic acid. A mutational loss in bacteria make them dependent on an external supply of thymine, which contributes to trimethoprim resistance. A mutational change in H. influenzae results in overproduction of dihydrofolate reductases, leading to trimethoprim resistance. iv. Active efflux pumping out of the drug Mutations in ceain bacteria permit the over-expression of the efflux-pump protein. Sometimes, an amino acid substitution in the efflux-pump protein makes it more efficient at expo of the drug. In either case, the intracellular antibiotic concentration is decreased and the bacterium becomes less susceptible to that antibiotic. This kind of resistance is seen to chloramphenicol (P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. typhimurium, V. cholerae), macrolides (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus sps, Bacteroides sps, Pseudomonas sps and Enterobacteriaceae members), tetracyclines (S. aureus, E. coli, A. baumannii, S. typhimurium), aminoglycosides (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii) and beta-lactams (H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii). v. Decreased permeability of the drug Some strains of P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli exhibit aminoglycoside resistance due to a transpo defect or membrane impermeabilization. Resistance to cefoxitin in E. coli and K. pneumoniae is due to mutations leading to narrowed outer membrane proteins. Ref: Colour Atlas and Textbook of diagnostic Microbiology by Elmer. W.

Eight antigenic types of enterotoxins are currently known A, B, C1, C2, C3, D, E and H. Type A is responsible for most of the cases. The toxin stimulates the vagus nerve and vomiting center of brain. It acts directly on the autonomic nervous system rather than on gastrointestinal mucosa. The toxin is antigenic and neutralized by the specific antitoxin. Enterotoxins are produced when S. aureus grows on carbohydrate and protein foods. Staphylococcal food poisoning occurs after eating meat and fish, or milk and milk products as custards or potato salad. Staph food poisoning is characterized by nausea and vomiting within 1-6 hours of ingestion. Diarrhea, hypotension, and dehydration may also occur. Fever is unusual. Diagnosis can be established by demonstration of bacteria or documentation of enterotoxin in the implicated food. Staphylococcal food poisoning is self-limited illness, symptoms generally resolve within 8 to 10 hrs. Treatments are symptomatic only, no antibiotic is required.",

It was first described as a function of NK cells, which use their Fc receptor, Fcg. RIII, to bind to antibody-coated cells. Fcg. RIII/CD16 is a low-affinity receptor that binds clustered IgG molecules displayed on cell surfaces but does not bind circulating monomeric IgG. Therefore, ADCC occurs only when the target cell is coated with antibody molecules. Engagement of Fcg. RIII by antibody-coated target cells activates the NK cells to synthesize and secrete cytokines such as IFN-g as well as to discharge the contents of their granules, which mediate the killing functions of this cell type. NK cells are the major cell type that carries out antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC can also be carried out by other cells that express Fc receptors and have the machinery to kill targets. Thus neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and macrophages also carry out ADCC, although they use different effector molecules than NK cells.",

Same principles governs agglutination and precipitation, but agglutination reaction is more sensitive than precipitation reaction for detecting antibodies. The primary reaction is the binding of the Fab poion of antibody to antigenic determinants on the paiculate antigen. The secondary reaction is the result of the cross-linking by multivalent antibodies, of the paicles of multivalent antigen to form aggregates. The foregoing two-component system can in ceain instances be enhanced by the addition of a third component, complement (C'). This is exemplified by the reaction of immune hemolysis, in which the antibody \"sensitizes\" erythrocytes which are then lysed by complement. The most obvious clinical application of agglutination is blood-typing; erythrocyte blood group surface antigens (e. g., the ABO blood group factors) react with antibody that is specific for these allo-antigens to produce agglutination. The cross- matching of blood depends upon this technique. The surface antigens of bacteria also react with appropriate antibodies to produce agglutination. A patient's serum can be tested for the presence of antibody to known antigens of ceain bacteria (e. g., Salmonella typhi), giving diagnostically significant information.",

Which of the following is the most common source of this type of infection?",
        "exp": "Clues to the correct answer are the underlying disease (AIDS), which predisposes to oppounistic infections, the typical MRI appearance of the lesion (ring-enhancing mass), and the histopathologic features (presence of encysted bradyzoites). In sho, this patient has cerebral toxoplasmosis, which represents one of the most common oppounistic infections in AIDS. Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan that infects humans who ingest the oocysts from cat feces or incompletely cooked lamb or pork. Only immunosuppressed patients and fetuses are vulnerable to this infection. In the fetus, toxoplasmosis causes extensive damage to brain parenchyma and retina. Toxoplasmosis associated with AIDS manifests with necrotizing lesions surrounded by chronic inflammation. A ring-enhancing lesion is a mass that contains a rim of contrast enhancement (bright signal on MRI) surrounding a dark core corresponding to central necrosis. In AIDS, the most frequent causes of a ring-enhancing lesion are primary brain lymphoma and toxoplasmosis. Anopheles mosquitoes transmit malaria parasites. Cerebral malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum, which is able to adhere to endothelial cells of small cerebral vessels. Vascular occlusion ensues, resulting in numerous small infarcts. Bird droppings represent the vehicle of infection for two of the most common oppounistic fungal infections affecting immunocompromised patients: cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis. Cryptococcus neoformans causes meningoencephalitis, not intracerebral necrotic lesions. Histoplasma capsulatum rarely affects the brain. These fungi can be visualized in tissue sections by silver stains. Cooling systems may harbor Legionella pneumophila, spreading the bacteria in aerosolized form. L. pneumoniae is a gram-negative bacterium that causes Legionnaire's disease, a fatal form of pneumonia that first struck paicipants at a meeting of the American Legion.

In addition, the vaccine can reduce the need for medical care, biopsies and invasive procedures associated with the follow up from abnormal pap tests. Thus, helping to reduce the health care costs and anxieties related to abnormal pap tests and follow up procedures. HPV vaccines are? 1) Preventive vaccines The role of HPV vaccine is to prevent infection with ceain species of Human papillomavirus associated with the development of cervical cancer, genital was and some less common type of cancers. These vaccines are based on virus like paicles (VLPs) assembled from recombinant HPV coat proteins (major capsid protein L1). Currently, one quadrivalent product containing HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 has been licenced in US and recommended by the centres for disease control and prevention for administration to girls and young women 9-26 years of age -- type 16 and 18 are most impoant as they cause 70% of cervical cancer world wide. Another product contains HPV types 16 and 18 ( bivalent) and is likely to be available in the near future. 2) Therapeutic vaccines (under trial) In addition to above two preventive vaccines, laboratory research and several human clinical trials are focused on the development of therapetic HPV vaccines. In general these vaccines focus on the main HPV oncogenes, E6 and E7. Since expression of E6 and E7 is required for promoting the growth of cervical cancer cells and cells within was, it is hoped that immune responses against two oncogenes might eradicate established tumors.",

Prions are composed largely, if not entirely of PrP molecules. Four important points about prions are: - 1. Prions are the only known infectious vatho2ens that are devoid of nucleic acid all other infectious agents possess genomes composed of either RNA or DNA that direct the synthesis of their presence. 2. Prions disease may manifest as infectious, genetic and sporadic disorders; no other group of illness with a single etiology presents with such a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. 3. Prions disease result from the accumulation of Pr. P1 the conformation of which differs substantially from that of its precursor. 4. PrP can exist in a variety of different conformations each of which seems to specify a particular disease phenotype. Prion disease: - Prion are fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by transmissible proteins and are characterized by spongiform changes, astrocytic gliomas and neuronal loss from the deposition of insoluble protein aggregates in neural cells. Prions are caused by human prion related protein (PrP) {\u03b1 glycoprotein rich in a helix). PrP is endogenous to the host and in most people, the PrP protein folds normally leaving the person healthy. Rarely, a mutation in the PrP gene will allow the protein to be made incorrectly and it will fold incorrectly making a Pr. Psc prion. (Which is a glycoprotein rich in \u03b2 sheets). These Pr. Psc prions when exposed to PrP, which is in the process of folding will encourage that PrP to fold incorrectly too, thus creating another Pr. Psc. While PrP can be processed and cleaned out of a cell once it has been used, Pr. Psc is shaped differently enough so that it can't be cleaned out and it aggregates inside the cell. These Pr. Psc aggregates quickly builds up into plaques destroying the nervous tissue. Thus a pathological prion protein serves as the templates for the conformational transformation of normal PrP into Pr. Psc.",

Most gram-negatives (other than exceptional microorganisms, such as Mycoplasma, that lack a cell wall) have a more complex cell envelope than gram-positive microorganisms. It includes both a cytoplasmic membrane as well as an outer membrane. Between these two membranes is the periplasmic space, which contains enzymes such as phosphatase and penicillinase, binding proteins for the transpo of various nutrients, and peptidoglycan, as well as a poion of the lipoprotein that firmly anchors the outer that a baby can form with an acute membrane to the peptidoglycan. Gram-positives do not have outer membranes. The cell envelope is incorrect because both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms have this structure, which is defined as all the layers that enclose the cytosol of the bacterium. It is the composition of the envelope that differs between gram-positives and gram-negatives. Exotoxin is not exclusive to gram-negative microorganisms, but is also found in some gram-positives. By contrast, endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) is found exclusively in gram- negatives. Peptidoglycan is found in the cell walls of both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Note that there is a larger amount of peptidoglycan in gram-positive microorganisms. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013). Chapter 2. Cell Structure. In G. F.

Different guidelines have been evolved as a means of protecting microbiological workers, known as biosafety level. \"A biosafety level is the level of biocontaimnent precautions required to isolate dangerous biological agents in enclosed facility\". There are four levels of biosafety - i) Biosafety level - 1 ii) Biosafety level - 2 iii) Biosafety level - 3 iv) Biosafety level - 4 Each level has guidelines for laboratory facilities, safety equipment and laboratory practices and techniques. 1) Biosafety level - 1 (BSL -1) BSL-1 risk group contains biological agents that pose low risk to personnel and the environment. Examples - BSL-1 is found in water-testing laboratories, in high schools, and in colleges teaching introductory microbiology - Agrobacterium radiobacter - Aspergillus niger - Bacillus thuringiensis - E. coli strain K-12 - Lactobacillus acidophilus, - Micrococcus leuteus - Neurospora crassa Pseudomonas classes. Work is done on an open bench or in a fume hood. Standard microbiological practices are used when working in the laboratory. Decontamination can be achieved by treating with chemical disinfectants or by steam autoclaving. Lab coats are required and gloves are recommended. The laboratory work is supervised by an individual with general training in microbiology or a related science. ii) Biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) BSL-2 risk group contains biological agents that pose moderate risk to personnel and the environment. If exposure occurs in a laboratory situation, the risk of spread is limited and it rarely would cause infection that would lead to serious disease. Effective preventive measures and treatment are available in the event that an infection occurs. Examples - Access to the laboratory is restricted. An autoclave should be readily available for decontaminating waste materials. Bacteria Viruses Fungi MOTT * Adeno * Cryptococcus Pneurnococci * Calci * Candida Streptococci * Corona * Aspergillus Staphylococci * Herpes * Dermatophytes Enterobacteriaciae * Influenza E. coli Clostridium sp. Bacillus (except anthrax) Lab coats, gloves and face protection is required. The laboratory work must be supervised by a competent scientist who understand the risk associated with working the agents involved. iii) Biosafety level -3 (BSL-3) BSL-3 risk group contains biological agents that usually produce serious disease. These agents are usually not transmitted by casual contact. The laboratory must be a separate building or isolated zone, with double-door entry, directional inward airflow. Examples:- Bacteria Viruses - Anthrax - Lymphocytic choriome? - Brucella ningitis virus - Coxiella burnetti - Hantaan virus - Tularemia - St. Louis encephalitis virus - MAC - Japanese encephalitis virus - M. tuberculosis - West nile encephalitis virus - SARS corona virus Fungi - Coccidioides imitis - Blastomyces dermatitides - Histoplasma capsulatum - Paracoccidioides brazileinsis iv) Biosafety level- 4 (BSL-4) BSL-4 risk group contains biological agents These agents are usually easily transmitted either directly or indirectly, or by casual con Numerous special facilities and precautions Example:? - Lassa virus - Marburg virus - Ebola virus - Herpes simiac virus that usually produce very serious infection that is often untreatable. from one individual to another, from animal to human or vice-versa, tact. are required when working with these agents.",

A diffuse erythematous rash with areas of desquamation over the hands and feet is noted. Infection with which of the following agents is the most likely cause of these signs and symptoms?",
        "exp": "This patient has toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a multisystem syndrome caused by a toxin (TSST-1) formed by ceain strains of S. aureus. TSS usually affects several organ systems (gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, hematopoietic, musculoskeletal, pulmonary) and can result in death. TSS has historically been associated with the use of tampons in young women, but can also occur in other patient populations. Fever, hypotension, diarrhea, and diffuse rash with desquamation of the hands and feet are common symptoms. Management of shock, renal failure, and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are a priority if these conditions are present, in addition to appropriate antibacterial treatment. C. perfringens causes gas gangrene, with necrosis of soft tissues, usually after a traumatic wound. It is also a cause of food poisoning. Although HIV-1 can cause many diverse findings and should never be immediately ruled out, the findings in this patient are most specific for TSS. Shigella dysenteriae is a cause of dysentery characterized by fever, abdominal cramps, and bloody diarrhea. Ref: Ray C. G., Ryan K. J. (2010). Chapter 24. Staphylococci. In C. G. Ray, K. J.

        "exp": "Mycobacterium leprae is endemic to pas of Africa, Asia, and South America. Tuberculoid leprosy is an indolent disease, typically affecting cooler pas of the body, such as the nose and ears, producing dermal granulomas with very rare, acid-fast bacilli and damage to peripheral nerves. This is in marked contrast to lepromatous leprosy, which is progressive and invasive and generally characterized by the presence of numerous acid-fast bacteria in a histiocytic, but non-granulomatous tissue response. M. leprae has not been grown in any culture medium. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is due to Leishmania species that show a worldwide distribution. The infection is transmitted through a sandfly bite, and the skin lesion is typically ulcerated. Histology shows intracellular parasites within the dermis and epidermis. Granulomas are not formed. Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is a roundworm infection transmitted by black flies of Africa and South America. The microfilariae grow at the site of inoculation, and cause an inflamed subcutaneous nodule. The organism is seen on tissue sections. Rhinoscleroma is a destructive granulomatous infection of the nasopharynx caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. Gram-negative rods can be cultured from the lesions. Ref: Ray C. G., Ryan K. J.

        "question": "Most sensitive test for Treponema",
        "exp": "FTA-ABS test Most sensitive test in Syphilis The non specific tests (VDRL / RPR) test can be easily ruled out:? Their sensitivity is comparable to that of specific tests in primary and secondary syphilis but in latent or late syphilis they have quite low sensitivity. Specific Tests TPI In its time TPI was the most specific test available. for diagnosis of syphilis and was considered \"gold standard\" in. syphilis serology. However because of its extreme complexity it was available only in. few laboratories. The TP1 test has now been supplanted by other tests such as FTA-ABS and TPHA which are quite as specific and much simpler. FTA-ABS test FTA-ABS test is as specific as the TPI test and is now accepted as the standard reference test. However it can be done only in suitably equipped laboratories, it is not available for routine testing. TPHA test TPHA test is just as specific as FTA-ABS and almost as sensitive except in the primary stage. It is also much simple and more economical. These advantages have made TPHA a standard confirmations test. TPPA test The TPHA test has been replaced by the serodia TP-PA test which is more sensitive for primary syphilis. TPHA is widely available in Europe but not used in U. S. A. From the discussion above, and from the table reproduced from Harrison, it seems, the TPPA is the most sensitive test far syphilis. - Both FTA-ABS and TP-PA are equally sensitive in secondary and latent syphilis. - TP-PA has higher sensitivity in Primary syphilis. - The problem is that enough datas for TP-PA are not available. Test Primary Secondary Latent Teiary * VDRL/RPR 78 (74-87) 100 95(88-100) 71 (37-94) * FTA-ABS 84 (70-100) 100 100 96 * TP-PA 89 100 100 NA Diagnosis of syphilis:- Treponema pallidum cannot be isolated by routine culture methods therefore detection is either by direct visualization of the organisms in material. from the lesion or indirectly by immunological/serological methods. Each stage of the treponematoses requires a paicular testing modality. Absolute diagnosis during the first and second stages can be made by direct examination under dark field microscopy of a specimen from primary chancre, the maculopapular rash, or the condyloma Tatum. Since the direct visualization of spirochetes is effective only during the active stages of primary and secondary syphilis, serologic tests were developed. Serological tests in syphilis are of two types - Non specific treponemal tests - Specific treponemal tests Nonspecific treponemal tests:? Infection with syphilis results in cellular damage and the release into the serum of a number of lipids including cardiolipin and lecithin. The body produces antibodies against these antigens. - Non specific treponemal tests detects the presence of these antibodies to lipoprotein material from damged cells and cardiolipin from treponemes and as a consequence are not specific for Treponema. (Reactivity in these tests indicates host tissue damage). - If the patient has these antibodies it is assumed that he or she has syphilis. These tests are used for screening of syphilis. - If these tests are positive presence of the disease should be confirmed by specific tests. The tests commonly employed are:? - Veneral disease Research laboratory test (VDRL TEST) - Rapid plasma Regain Test (RPR test) Why are these tests nonspeciic?? - These tests measure antibodies directed against cardiolipin antigen that results, from interaction of host tissues with treponema pallidum or spirochete itself. (They do not detect the antibodies against Treponena itself). - Cardiolipin is a phospholipid and it is possible that a similar substance present in the treponemal cell or released. from damage host cells damaged by the stimulate antibody production. - Assays for nonspecific antibody, because of their low cost and technical simplicity have routinely been used as screening test. for evidence of syphilis since these tests have relatively low specificity positive results are confinned by detection of specific anti Treponemal antibody. Antibody develops in 70% of patients within 2 weeks of developing chancre and in 100% of patients with secondary syphilis. The impoant point about nonspecific treponemal tests is that they can be used quantitatively:? - Quantitative result of these tests tends to correlate with disease activity thus they are very helpful. for screening. A four, fold or greater rise in the titre may be seen during the evolution of early syphilis. in secondary syphilis, test results are always positive and often at a high titre. The nonspecific treponemal tests should become nonreactive one year after successful therapy in primary syphilis and 2 years after successful therapy in late syphilis. - There fore these tests can be used to monitor response to treatment. -After successful treatment there would be sustained four fold decrease in antibody titre. - Similarly a four fold increase in titre following therapy suggests reinfection or relapse and necessitates reevaluation. Non specific Treponemal tests for syphilis VDRL Test The VDRL test is a non specific serological test for syphilis. It uses a mixture of cardiolipin, cholesterol and lecithin as antien. With the use of these antigens, IgG or 1gM antibodies present in the serum or C. S. F. (in case of neurosyphilis) are detected. This test can be used quantitatively and increase in VDRL titre with time can be used to confirm a diagnosis of syphilis. R. P. R. It is also a nonspecific test which uses cardiolipin as antigen. Treponemal specific tests While the nonspecific tests look for antilipoidal antibodies the specific treponemal tests look for antibodies against the spirochete itself The tests included in this category are:? - Indirect immunoflorescence treponemal antibody-absorption test (FTA-ABS) test. -Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) or microhemagglutination test (MHA-TP) - Treponema pallidum immnobilisation test (TPI). - Enzyme immune assay (ELISA). - TPPA test These tests are used to confirm a positive nontreponemal reaginic test. Treponema specific tests are not completely specific for syphilis because false positive reactions can occur with other spirochetal diseases (e. g., Yaws, pinta leptospirosis, rat bite fever, relapsing degfever, lyme disease). An impoant point about these tests is that they do not correlate with disease activity. - These test findings become positive soon after infection and typically remain positive for life despite adequate treatment.",

In this cycle, the rhabditiform larva's passage through the colon to the outside world is delayed by constipation or other factors. This allows it to transform into an infective filariform larva while still within the body of its host. This larva may then invade the internal mucosa (internal autoinfection) or perianal skin (external autoinfection) without an intervening soil phase. Strongyloidiasis is diagnosed by the presence of the larvae in the stool. When it is absent in the stool, it can be isolated from duodenal or jejunal aspirates. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for antibodies to excretory-secretory or somatic antigens are now available in reference laboratories. Ref: Ray C. G., Ryan K. J. (2010). Chapter 53.

        "exp": "Causes decreased efficacy of BCG due to cross immunity Mycobacteria other than tubercle bacille (MOTT) which occassionally cause human disease resembling tuberculosis have been called atypical 'anonymous' or 'unclassified' mycobacteria. They are also called \"environmental\" or oppourustics as their natural habitat appears to be soil and water and they cause oppounistic infections in human beings. The name \"non tuberculous mycobacteria\" (NTM) has gained wide acceptance in recent years. They have also been called paratubercle', \"tuberculoid\" and MOTT (mycobacteria other than tubercle bacilli) They are usually referred as MOTT and environmental bacteria in text. Epidemiology MOTT are widely distributed in the environment and are paicularly abundant in wet soil, marshland, streams, rivers and estuaries. Human beings are therefore regularly exposed to mycobacteria as a result of drinking, washing, showering and inhalation of natural aerosols. Such repeated subclinical infection may induce sensitization to tuberculin and other mycobacterial skin testing reagents. There is also evidence that contact with MOTT or the environmental bacteria profoundly affects the subsequent ability of BCG vaccine to induce protective immunity, thereby explaining the great regional difference in the efficacy of this vaccine. They are uncommon in regions where T. B. is endemic while they are common where T. B. is rare. Pathogenesis Compared with Tubercle bacilli, MOTT are of low virulence and although man is frequently infected, ove disease is very uncommon except in those who are profoundly immunosuppressed. Person to person infection does not seem to occur. Four main types of oppounist mycobacterial disease has been described in man Localized lymphadenitis.

Some microbes form substances called hemolysins that have the specific action of destroying red blood cells; beta-hemolytic streptococci are an example. Intravenous administration of a hypotonic solution or plain distilled water will cause the red cells to fill with fluid until their membranes rupture and the cells are destroyed. Wherever either in vitro or in vivo IgG or IgM antibodies are bound to red blood cell antigens in the presence of complement, the complement cascade is triggered the final products of which include enzymes that result in holes being 'punched' in the wall of the red blood cell, allowing hemoglobin to escape and which is observed as lysis. Snake venoms and ceain plant substances may cause hemolysis. A great variety of chemical agents can lead to destruction of erythrocytes if there is exposure to a sufficiently high concentration of the substance. These chemical hemolytics include copper.

C: FT-ABS T. pallidum cannot be grown in vitro Diagnostic tests for syphilis: Tests include serologic tests for syphilis (STS), which consist of screening (reaginic) and confirmatory (treponemal) tests, and dark field microscopy. Reaginic tests use lipid antigens (cardiolipin from bovine heas) to detect reagin (human antibodies that bind to lipids). The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests are sensitive, simple, and inexpensive reaginic tests that are used for screening but are not specific for syphilis. Results may be presented qualitatively (e. g., reactive, weakly reactive, borderline, or nonreactive) and quantitatively as titers (e. g., positive at 1: 16 dilution). Many disorders other than treponemal infections (e. g., SLE, antiphospholipid antibody syndromes) can produce a positive (biologically false-positive) reagin test result. CSF reaginic tests are reasonably sensitive for early disease but less so for late neurosyphilis. CSF reagin tests can be used to diagnose neurosyphilis or to monitor response to treatment by measuring antibody titers. Treponemal tests detect antitreponemal antibodies qualitatively and are very specific for syphilis. They include the following: - Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test - Microhemagglutination assay for antibodies to T. pallidum (MHA-TP) T. pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA)",

Streptococcus pneumonia is the major cause of community acquired bacterial pneumonia and the most frequent cause of otitis media and bacteremia in infacts and children. - Thus it is impoant to distinguish streptococcus pneumonia from other alpha hemolytic streptococci which are commensuls. Two tests are commonly employed for distinguishing streptococcus pneumonia from the viridians streptococcus i. e., - Optochin sensitivity test - Bile solubility test Optochin sensitivity test Optochin (or ethylhydrocupreine) is a chemical used for distinguishing streptococcus pneumonia from other a hemolytic streptococci. - Streptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to optochin i. e., it is lysed by optochin. - Other ahemolytic streptococci are resistant to (not killed by) optochin. Bacterias that are optochin sensitive will be inhibited to grow around optochin disc while the bacteria that are optochin resistant will be unaffected. Bile Solubility test Bile solubility test is used to distinguish streptococcus pneumoniae from other ahemolytic streptococci. - Bile will selectively lyse colonies of streptococcus pneumoniae while other streptococci are immune to bile's activity.",

Inhalation of the mold microconidia, which are small enough (2 to 5 m) to reach the terminal bronchioles and alveoli, is believed to be the mode of infection. The hallmark of histoplasmosis is infection of the lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, and other elements of the reticuloendothelial system with intracellular growth in phagocytic macrophages. Progressive pulmonary disease occurs in a form similar to that of pulmonary tuberculosis, including the development of cavities, with sputum production, night sweats, and weight loss.

        "exp": "Hepatitis B can be detected in the blood, sweat, tears, saliva, semen, vaginal secretions, menstrual blood and breast milk. It is not transmitted through fecal oral route. Only Hepatitis A and E is transmitted through fecal oral route. Hepatitis B is not transmitted transplacentally to the fetus in utero, but it is acquired during the bih process by the swallowing of infected blood or fluids or through abrasions. The rate of transmission of infection is high up to 90% when infants are born to mothers who have acute hepatitis B infection or are HBs. Ag and HBe. Ag positive. Hepatitis B is an enveloped DNA virus belonging to the family Hepadnaviridae. Other than veical route it is also spread parenterally and through sexual contact. Exposure to hepatitis viruses from direct contact with blood or other body fluids, probably through needlestick injuries, has resulted in a risk of hepatitis B infection in medical personnel.

Somatic antigen '0' Is an integral pa of the cell wall A phospholipid-protein-polysaccharide complex Is identical with endotoxin. Less immunogenic than H antigen, antibody production is slow and lower in titre. Salmonellae are classified into a number of groups based on the presence of characteristic '0' antigen on the bacterial surface. 3.

This process is called \"reassoment\" of the virus. - Normally when a segmented virus infects a cell, the individual RNA segments enter the nucleus of the host. - There they are copied many times over to form RNA genomes, for new infectious virions. - The new RNA segments are expoed to the cytoplasm where they are assembled into new virus paicles which buds from the cell. If a cell is infected simultaneously with two different segmented viruses, the RNA of both the viruses are copied in the nucleus. These segmented viruses undergo a kind of \"gene swapping or exchange\" i. e., segments from viruses are interchanged or transferred to each other. - As a result new virus paicles emerge that contain RNA segments from both the viruses. - These new viruses are called \"reassoants\" and the process is called reassoment. Reassoment is an efficient process but is limited to the viruses with \"segmented genomes\". So far the only human viruses characterized with segmented genomes are RNA viruses e. g., ohomyxoviruses, reo viruses, arenaviruses, Bunya viruses. - In paicular reassoment is characteristic of \"influenza viruses\" whose genomes consists of eight distinct segment of RNA. - Reassoment is responsible for some of the major genetic shifts in the history of influenza virus which has lead to epidemics. Reassoment in Rotavirus Rotavirus is an impoant cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children. Rotavirus are segmented virus - Due to segmented nature of their genome rotavirus can exchange (reasso) genes during coinfection a features that ispredicted to generate new possibly more dangerous virus strains. - However the amount of gene reassoment occurring in nature is not known as very few Rotavirus genomes have been segmented. - In contrast to what was previously thought very few Rota viruses exchanged gene segments with each other: instead the genomic constillations of the viruses remained relatively stable.",

The test is an intradermal skin test performed by using lepromin antigen, which is a suspension of killed M. leprae obtained from infected human or armadillo tissue. The lepromin test is not used to confirm the diagnosis of leprosy. It is also not useful to indicate prior contact of the person with leprae bacilli. Healthy people residing in areas nonendemic for leprosy with no chance of contact with the bacilli may show a positive lepromin reaction. Key Points:- The lepromin test is used mainly to: Determine the type of leprosy, being positive (suggests resistance to disease) in tuberculoid leprosy and negative (suggests a lack of resistance to the disease) in lepromatous leprosy patients. Monitor the response of leprosy patients to treatment with chemotherapy. A positive reaction indicates a good prognosis, while a negative test suggests a very bad prognosis.

Hyperacute rejection occurs within minutes and the transplant must be immediately removed to prevent a severe systemic inflammatory response. Rapid agglutination of the blood occurs. This is a paicular risk in kidney transplants, and so a prospective cytotoxic crossmatch is performed prior to kidney transplantation to ensure that antibodies to the donor are not present. Hyperacute rejection is analogous to a blood transfusion reaction as it is a humoral-mediated immune response. For other organs, hyperacute rejection is prevented by transplanting only ABO-compatible grafts. Hyperacute rejection is not significant in liver allografts and cellular transplants because these tissues have remarkable regenerative abilities. Hyperacute rejection is the outcome of xenotransplanted organ in non-immunosuppressed recipients",

B: Enriched media A growth medium is considered differential if, when specific microbes are present, the medium or bacterial colonies themselves exhibit a color change that provides information about their identity. Blood agar (BAP) is a differential growth medium which is used to distinguish clinically significant bacteria from throat and sputum cultures. BAP contains 5% sheep blood. Ceain bacteria produce enzymes (hemolysins) that act on the red blood cells to lyse or break them down. Beta hemolysis means that the bacteria's hemolytic enzymes completely beak down the blood cells. The a-hemolysis pattern results in the media displaying clear halos around bacterial colonies. Alpha hemolysis (a-hemolysis) means that the bacterial enzymes only paially break down the blood cells. This results in the media showing a yellowish/greenish/brownish discoloration (like a bruise) around the colony, indicating incomplete hemolysis. Gamma hemolysis is essentially no hemolysis at all. The bacteria have no effect on the red blood cells, and there is no change to the color of the medium. Some of the terms for media are interchangeable. For example, the blood agar medium is an enriched medium but bacteria lysing red cells show a clearing around their colonies. Thus, it is an differential medium as well.",

Enteroadherent E. colil It causes diarrhoea in infants and children usually occuring as institutional out breaks. It does not produce enterotoxin, nor are they invasive. They adhere to the mucosa of small intestine and cause disruption of the brush border microvilli. These strains can be identified by their adhesion to HEP - 2 cells. Enterotoxigenic E. coli It causes traveller's diarrhoea [ETEC is the most common cause of traveller's diarrhea!. It produces enterotoxins. They can produce heat labile toxin (LT) or heat stable toxin or both. Toxin production alone may not lead to illness. The strain should first be able to adhere to intestinal mucosa. This adhesiveness is medicated by fimbrial or colonisation factor antigen (CFA). Enteroinvasive E. coli They themselves resemble shigella and their infection resembles shigellosis (remember: shiga like toxin is elaborated by enterohemorrhagic E. coli). They produce mild diarrhoea to frank dysentry and occur in adult as well as in children. They have been termed enteroinvasive because they have the capacity to invade intestinal epithelial cells in vivo and penetrate He. La or HEP - 2 cells in tissue culture. This ability of penetration is plasmid determined which codes for outer membrane antigens called the 'virulence marker antigen' (VMA). The detection of plasmid can be diagnostic. For laboratory diagnosis of EIEC, the sereny test used to be employed. These strains are non motile, do not ferment lactose or ferment it late with acid without producing any gas. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli or verotoxigenic E. coli These strains produce verocytotoxin (VT) or shiga like toxin (SLT) They can cause mild diarrhoea to fatal hemorrhagic colitis. Shiga like toxin belongs to class ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs). It inhibits protein synthesis by inhibiting ribosomal function. This toxin also acts on vascular endothelium to promote the synthesis of coagulation factor VIII, v. WF -* Platelet aggregation. They can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome paicularly in young children and the elderly. 0 157: H 7 is the most prominent serotype of EHEC, associated with HUS, but 06, 026, 055, 091, 0103, 0111, 0113 and OX3 have also been associated with this syndrome. The primary target for VT is vascular endothelium. The typical EHEC is serotype 0157: H7 which does not ferement sorbital unlike majority of E. coli (but Harrison writes that few species of this serotype can ferment sorbital). Some other serotype like 026: H1 also belongs to this group. Laboratory diagnosis of VIEC diarrhea is established by demonstration of the bacilli or VT in feces directly or in culture.",

Intravascular catheter related infections Indwelling vascular catheters are a leading source of bloodstream infections. Amongst indwelling vascular catheters, central venous catheters are the most common culprits. Pathogenesis There are four potential sources for catheter related infections? 1) The skin inseion site 2) The catheter hub 3) Hematogenous seeding from a distant infection 4) Contaminated infusate The skin inseion site and the catheter hub are by for the two most impoant sources. Approximately 65% of catheter related infections originate from the skin flora, 30% from the contaminated hub and 5% from other pathways. For sho term catheters, skin contamination is the most likely mechanism of pathogenesis. On the other hand, for long term catheters, hub contamination is more. frequent because such catheters often have to be intercepted and manipulated. Skin organisms migrate from the skin inseion site along the external surface of catheter, colonizing the distal intravascular tip of the catheter, and ultimately causing blood-stream infection. On the other hand, in hub related infections, organisms are usually introduced into the hub from the hands of medical personnel and the organisms migrate along the internal surface of the catheter, where they can cause a bloodstream infection. Microbiology Most of the micro-organisms implicated in CRIs arise from the skin flora. Staphylococci are the most frequently isolated pathogens, paricularly coagulase-negative staphylococci.
