Infection is acquired by the consumption of oocysts, after which the parasite invades intestinal epithelial cells and undergoes both sexual and asexual cycles of development.

In patients who have AIDS, infections often are not self-limited but rather resemble cryptosporidiosis, with chronic, profuse watery diarrhea. Eosinophilia, which is not found in other enteric protozoan infections, may be detectable. The diagnosis is usually made by detection of the large (25-m) oocysts in stool by modified acid-fast staining. Oocyst excretion may be low-level and intermittent; if repeated stool examinations are unrevealing, sampling of duodenal contents by aspiration or small-bowel biopsy (often with electron-microscopic examination) may be necessary.

The moality rate is 30% and most of the survivors will have neurologic impairment. Also know: CMV infections in children and adults are often asymptomatic; however, the virus is responsible for 10% of infectious mononucleosis cases (characterized by an absence of sheep RBC agglutinins). CMV also causes serious disease in immunosuppressed patients, including bone marrow recipients and AIDS patients. Ganciclovir is the drug of choice, although foscarnet has also been used with some success. Infections with hepatitis viruses, if symptomatic, are characterized by jaundice, lethargy, failure to thrive, abdominal distention, clay- colored stools, and elevated transaminase levels. Hepatitis B is the only viral hepatitis agent that is recognized as an impoant cause of neonatal disease. The infection is usually acquired during the bih process; therapy includes hyperimmune human anti-hepatitis B serum followed a few weeks later with active immunization with HBs. Ag injections. Herpes simplex can also infect the neonate. The hallmark of infection is painful skin vesicles (present in 50% of affected infants); other manifestations include encephalitis, pneumonia, hepatitis, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

CRP was so named because it was first discovered as a substance in the serum of patients with acute inflammation that reacted with the C- (capsular) polysaccharide of pneumococcus. CAP is another name for the CRP protein. CAP stands for catabolite activator protein; CRP stands for cyclic-AMP receptor protein. This can be the answer here, but it is not given in the options. So the only related option is Capsular Polysacharide in Pneumococcus. Therefore we can select it as answer of this question.

Clostridium botulinum (a common honey contaminant) was ingested and produced toxin in the infant.

Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction and impairment of this can lead to muscle weakness, failure to thrive, and in more serious cases, respiratory impairment.

Diagnostic Medical Microbiology & Clinical Correlation > Chapter 48, http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Community-acquired pneumonia Respiratory viruses are the single most impoant cause of community-acquired pneumonia in pediatric age group. Typical bacterial pathogens that cause CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae (both penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains), H influenzae (both ampicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains), and Moraxella catarrhalis (all strains penicillin-resistant). These 3 pathogens account for approximately 85% of CAP cases. S pneumoniae remains the most common agent responsible for CAP The most common combination of pathogens is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) with either respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or Mycoplasma pneumoniae Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are not typical causes of CAP in otherwise healthy hosts. S aureus may cause CAP in individuals with influenza (eg, human seasonal influenza and H1. N1 influenza). K pneumoniae CAP occurs primarily in individuals with chronic alcoholism. P aeruginosa is a cause of CAP in patients with bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis. Atypical community-acquired pneumonia pathogens: Atypical pneumonias can be divided into zoonotic and Nonzoonotic atypical pathogens. Zoonotic atypical CAP pathogens include Chlamydophilia (Chlamydia) psittaci (psittacosis), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and Coxiella burnetii (Q fever). Nonzoonotic atypical CAP pathogens are caused by Legionella species, M pneumoniae, or Chlamydophilia (Chlamydia) pneumoniae. These 3 organisms account for approximately 15% of all CAP cases.

        "exp": "Follicular dendritic cells in the germinal centers of lymph nodes are impoant reservoirs of HIV. Although some follicular dendritic cells are infected with HIV, most viral paicles are found on the surface of their dendritic processes. Follicular dendritic cells have receptors to the Fc poion of immunoglobulins that serve to trap HIV virions coated with anti-HIV antibodies. These coated HIV paicles retain the ability to infect CD4+ T cells as they traverse the dendritic cells. B lymphocytes have a surface marker (CD21 protein-a complement receptor) to which an Epstein-Barr envelope glycoprotein can bind. The virus associates with the host cell genome, producing a latent infection. These B cells undergo polyclonal activation and proliferation. Ganglion cells, paicularly the satellite cells around the ganglion cells in the dorsal root ganglia, can be infected by varicella-zoster. Herpes type I and II infect neurons that innervate skin and mucous membranes. Oligodendrocytes are directly infected by two viruses, JC virus (a polyomavirus) and measles virus. JC virus causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and measles virus produces a latent syndrome called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 58.

        "exp": "The three major causes of neonatal meningitis are group B streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae), Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. All can be found in the vaginal tract of normal women and may contaminate the infant during passage through the bih canal. They colonize the upper respiratory tract and can cause pneumonia, septicemia, and/or meningitis in the neonate. They are readily distinguished on morphological grounds; the streptococci are gram-positive cocci in chains, E. coli is a gram-negative rod, and L. monocytogenes is a gram-positive pleomorphic rod. There are other gram-positive rods that resemble Listeria (e. g., the diphtheroid bacilli found in the upper respiratory tract and on the skin), hence a motility test is done to confirm the identification. L. monocytogenes is motile at room temperature but not when grown at 37 degrees C. L. monocytogenes is also associated with drinking unpasteurized milk. Neisseria meningitidis is the most common cause of meningitis in school-age children and young adults. It is a fastidious, non-motile, gram-negative diplococcus that would be a very rare cause of meningeal disease in very young patients, such as this one. Ref: Ray C. G., Ryan K. J. (2010). Chapter 26.

Microscopy used are Dark field microscopy, and immunofluorescence microscopy (Direct fluerecent antibody test - DFA-TP). B) Serological tests These tests form the mainstay of laboratory diagnosis. Serological tests are: - 1) Non-specific tests (reagin antibody or standard tests):- Kahn test, VDRL, Rapid plasma reagin (RPR), automated VDRL-ELISA, Washermann test. These tests measure IgG & IgM against cardiolipin. 2) Group-specific test: - CFT 3) Species-specific tests: - Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) test, Treponema pallidum immobilization (TP1), Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA), ELISA. Specific treponemal tests (FTA-ABS, TPHA, TPI) are of little value as indicators of clinical cure, as they tend to remain positive inspite of Treatment. Nontreponemal tests (eg VDRL) will become nonreactive or will be reactive at lower titers after therapy, so can be used for monitoring patient's response to treatment These tests usually become negative 6-18 months after effective treatment of syphilis A four-fold or greater decrease in antibody titre indicates a response to therapy",

C sinensis is the Chinese liver fluke. Infection with any of these three species is established by ingestion of raw or inadequately cooked freshwater fish harboring metacercariae. These organisms encyst in the duodenum, releasing larvae that travel through the ampulla of Vater and mature into adult worms in bile canaliculi. Mature flukes are flat and elongated, measuring 1-2 cm in length. The hermaphroditic worms reproduce by releasing small operculated eggs, which pass with bile into the intestines and are voided with stools. The life cycle is completed in the environment in specific freshwater snails (the first intermediate host) and encystment of metacercariae in freshwater fish. Moderate to heavy infection may be associated with vague right-upper-quadrant pain. In contrast, chronic or repeated infection is associated with manifestations such as cholangitis, cholangiohepatitis, and biliary obstruction. Ref: Mahmoud A. A. (2012). Chapter 219.

After several days, she begins to pass blood per rectum, and is hospitalized for dehydration. In the hospital, she is noted to have decreasing urine output with rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Total blood count reveals anemia and thrombocytopenia, and the peripheral smear is remarkable for fragmented red cells (schistocytes). Infection with which of the following bacterial genera is most likely responsible for this syndrome?",
        "exp": "This patient has developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a complication of the Shiga toxin or Shiga-like toxin: exotoxins released by Shigella species and the enterohemorrhagic E. coli. HUS in children usually develops after a gastrointestinal or flu-like illness, and is characterized by bleeding, oliguria, hematuria and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Presumably the Shiga toxin is toxic to the microvasculature, producing microthrombi that consume platelets and RBCs, and may fragment the red cell membrane. The incorrect choices are all bacteria which may produce an enterocolitis, but do not elicit HUS. A long-term consequence of Campylobacter infection is a reactive ahritis or full-blown Reiter's syndrome. Clostridial enterocolitis is produced by Clostridium difficile, a normal inhabitant of the gut that produces pseudomembranous colitis when other gut flora are suppressed by treatment with antibiotics. Typhoid fever (produced by Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi) produces a protracted illness that progresses over several weeks and includes rash and very high fevers, but not HUS. Ref: Ray C.

Initial phase involving uptake, processing, and presentation by Langerhans-type dendritic cell in skin to T cells locally and in paracoical zones of nearby lymph nodes. T lymphocyte secretes cytokines, especially IFNgamma; macrophages are recruited and activated resulting in induration and erythema. The infiltrate of the tuberculin reaction is composed of monocytes (80-90%), CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and Langerhan cells.

But the classical glomerulopathy associated with HIV infection is collapsing ehnnerulopathy. Collapsing glomerulopathy is actually an aggressive form of focal segmental glonzerulosclerosis. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is characterized by sclerosis of some but not all glomeruli (thus it is focal) and in the affected glomeruli only a poion of the capillary tuft is involved. In contrast, collapsing glomerulopathy is characterized by collapse and sclerosis of the entire glomerular tuft (in addition to the usual. focal segmental glomerular lesions). Characteristic feature is proliferation and hyperophy of glomerular visceral epithelial cells.

There they multiply and form merozoites (Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale also form hypnozoites, a latent form). Merozoites leave the hepatocytes and infect red cells (erythrocytic phase). There they form schizonts that release more merozoites, which infect other red cells in a synchronous pattern (3 days for Plasmodium malariae; 2 days for the others). Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Pa IX.

In India, HEV is responsible for the majority of epidemic and sporadic hepatitis in adults. An epidemiological feature that distinguishes HEV from other enteric agents is the rarity of secondary person to person transmission (Secondary attack rate is very low 2-3% as against 10-20 % in HAV infection) A unique feature is the clinical severity and high case fatality rate of 20-40 % in pregnant women, especially in the last trimester of pregnancy.

These organisms also are the cause of foodborne illnesses in industrialized countries and have been associated with traveler's diarrhea and persistent diarrhea in patients with HIV. They are characterized by their specific patterns of adherence to human cells. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) are named for the cytotoxic toxins they produce. STEC has been associated with mild non-bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, a severe form of diarrhea, and with hemolytic uremic syndrome, a disease resulting in acute renal failure, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

        "exp": "Satellitism refers to the phenomenon in which ceain bacterial species like Haemophilus influenzae grows more vigorously in the immediate vicinity of the colonies of other unrelated species like Staphylococcus aureus which synthesize factor V. It demonstrates the dependence of H influenzae on the V factor, which is available in high concentrations near the staphylococcal growth and only in smaller quantities away from it. H influenzae can be isolated on chocolate agar enriched with factor X and V. The blood used in chocolate agar is heated to inactivate nonspecific inhibitors of H. influenzae growth. Definitive identification is made by Quellung reaction. Additional means of identifying encapsulated strains include fluorescent-antibody staining of the organism and counter immunoelectrophoresis or latex agglutination tests, which detect the capsular polysaccharide.

It is a rapidly developing immunological reaction occuring within minutes after the combination of an antigen with antibody bound to mast cells in individuals previously sensitized to the antigen.. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by Ig E, but T and B cells play impoant roles in the development of these antibodies.. Type I reaction requires prior sensitization to a specific antigen (allergen).. Most exposures occur either by inhalation (respiratory route) or ingestion (GIT) of antigen.. Type one hypersensitivity has two phases:? 1) Initial response. After first antigen exposure, this antigen is presented to CD-4 helper T cells (TH2 type) by antigen presenting cells. These primed TH, cells release IL-4 that acts on B-cells to form Ig E specific for that paicular antigen.. The antigen specific Ig E antibodies then bind to the surface receptors of mast cells and basophils. The process from first antigen exposure to the coating of mast cells by Ig E acts as sensitization (prior sensitization) and first exposure is also called priming or sensitizing exposure (dose). Subsequent exposure (shocking dose) to same antigen then result in activation of mast cells and basophils with release of mediator from these cells that leads to? - Smooth muscle spasm - Increase mucus secretion from the epithelial cells. - Vasodilatation - Increased vascular permeability Recuritment of inflammatory cells Note - Most of the clinical effects are due to smooth muscle spasm.",

        "exp": "Ans. A: Cholera Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Transmission occurs through direct faecal-oral contamination or through ingestion of contaminated water and food. The disease is characterized in its most severe form by a sudden onset of acute watery diarrhoea that can lead to death by severe dehydration and kidney failure. The extremely sho incubation period - two hours to five days - enhances the potentially explosive pattern of outbreaks, as the number of cases can rise very quickly. About 75% of people infected with cholera do not develop any symptoms. However, the pathogens stay in their faeces for 7 to 14 days and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other individuals. Cholera is an extremely virulent disease that affects both children and adults.",

CHEMICAL STERILIZATION \u25a0 Ethylene oxide (EO or EtO) gas - Most common sterilization method. - Used to sterilize objects sensitive to temperatures > 60\u00b0C such as plastics, optics and electrics. - Carried out at 30-60\u00b0C with relative humidity >30% & gas cone. 200-800 mg/L for at least 3 hrs. - ETO penetrates well, moving through paper, cloth, and some plastic films and is highly effective. - EtO can kill all known viruses, bacteria and fungi; including bacterial spores and is satisfactory. - Bacillus subtilis, a very resistant organism, is used as a rapid biological indicator for EO sterilizers. \u25a0 Glutaraldehyde \u25a0 Glutaraldehyde is a saturated dialdehyde that has gained wide acceptance as a high-level disinfectant and chemical sterilant. \u25a0 It is specifically effective against tubercle bacilli, fungi, and viruses. \u25a0 Has a short shelf life (<2 weeks), and is expensive. \u25a0 It is less toxic and irritant to eyes than formaldehyde. \u25a0 To kill all spores in the liquid can take upto 12 hrs with glutaraldehyde & longer with formaldehyde. \u25a0 It has no deleterious effect on the cement or lenses of instruments like cystoscopes and bronchoscopes. \u25a0 It can safely be used to treat corrugated rubber anesthetic tubes and face masks, plastic endotracheal tubes, polythene tubing, and metal instruments. \u25a0 CIDEX (2% glutaraldehyde) is commonly used for sterilization of endoscopes. \u25a0 Formaldehyde \u25a0 It is less expensive and has a much longer shelf life, but is much more volatile. \u25a0 Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent. \u25a0 Many vaccines, such as the original Salk polio vaccine, are sterilized with formaldehyde. \u25a0 Ozone is used in industrial settings to sterilize water and air, as well as a disinfectant for surfaces. It has the benefit of being able to oxidize most organic matter. On the other hand, it is a toxic and unstable gas that must be produced onsite, so it is not practical to use in many settings. \u25a0 Chlorine bleach is another accepted liquid sterilizing agent. Household bleach consists of 5. 25% sodium hypochlorite. It is usually diluted to 1/10 immediately before use; however, to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis it should be diluted only 1/5. The dilution factor must take into account the volume of any liquid waste that it is being used to sterilize. Bleach will kill many organisms immediately, but for full sterilization, it should be allowed to react for 20 minutes. Bleach will kill many, but not all spores. It is highly corrosive and may corrode even stainless steel surgical instruments. \u25a0 Chlorine and Na. OH are the most consistent agents for prions. Chlorine is too corrosive to use on certain objects. Na. OH has had many studies showing its effectiveness",

        "exp": "Influenza viruses are remarkable because of the frequent antigenic changes that occur in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Antigenic variants of influenza virus have a selective advantage over the parental virus in the presence of antibody directed against the original strain. This phenomenon is responsible for the unique epidemiologic features of influenza. Other respiratory tract agents do not display significant antigenic variation. Also know: Minor antigenic changes are termed antigenic drift; major antigenic changes in HA or NA, called antigenic shift, result in the appearance of a new subtype. Antigenic shift is most likely to result in an epidemic. Antigenic drift is caused by the accumulation of point mutations in the gene, resulting in amino acid changes in the protein. Ref: Brooks G.

Superantigens are potent activators of T-lymphocytes. Superantigens stimulate very large numbers of T cells, without relation to their epitope specificity. This leads to an excessive and dysregulated immune response with release of cytokines IL - 1, IL - 2, TNF - a and IF - y.

Which of the following organisms is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
        "exp": "The patient has developed bacteremia; the description of the causative agent is consistent with a staphylococcal organism (catalase positive, gram-positive cocci that grow on mannitol salt agar). The organism is most likely S. epidermidis as it was not able to ferment mannitol, and was not hemolytic. Both of those characteristics tend to rule out S. aureus. Two other tests that are commonly used are coagulase production and excretion of DNAse from colonies. S. aureus is positive in both tests, S. epidermidis is negative. Enterococcus faecalis might grow on the mannitol salt agar as it is relatively haloduric but these organisms are catalase negative. The enterococci are extremely variable in hemolytic ability so this characteristic is not useful in species identification. Streptococcus agalactiae is catalase negative and beta-hemolytic on sheep blood agar plates. Also, neither would grow on the mannitol salt agar. S. pyogenes is sensitive to growth inhibition by bacitracin while S. agalactiae (group B streptococci) is not. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013). Chapter 13. The Staphylococci. In G. F.

When listed numerically, the figure expressing the disinfecting power of a substance by relating it to the disinfecting power of phenol may be a function of the standardized test performed. To calculate phenol coefficient, the concentration of the test compound at which the compound kills the test organism in 10 minutes, but not in 5 minutes, is divided by the concentration of phenol that kills the organism under the same conditions. The phenol coefficient may be determined in the presence of a standard amount of added organic matter or in the absence of organic matter and the formula is given by N=1/ CT where C is the conc. of agent applied and T is the time for which agent is applied and N is the number of survivors so N is inversely propoional to dose (CT is collectively called dose)",

Every patient with S. bovis bacteremia should undergo gastrointestinal and cardiac evaluation. Up to 50% of patients with S. bovis bacteremia are repoed to have underlying colonic malignancies. In another study, 25-50% of cases of S. bovis bacteremia were associated with endocarditis, especially in patients with preexisting valvular lesions. Streptococcus agalactiae is an impoant cause of maternal and neonatal bacteremia and neonatal meningitis. It is pa of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract and the female genital tract. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia, meningitis in adults, otitis media (especially in children), and sinusitis. Spontaneous peritonitis due to S. pneumoniae is repoed in children with ascites from nephrotic syndrome. Asplenia predisposes patients to severe infections with S. pneumoniae and other encapsulated organisms. S. pneumoniae infections are also more frequent and unusually severe in patients with sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, alcoholism, and hypogammaglobulinemia. S. pneumoniae is now the leading cause of invasive bacterial respiratory disease in patients with AIDS. Streptococcus pyogenes is the most common cause of bacterial pharyngitis. Complications include peritonsillar abscesses, otitis media, and sinusitis. Long-term sequelae include rheumatic fever and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. S. pyogenes is also responsible for many skin and soft tissue infections. The organism also produces many toxins that produce a variety of diseases.",

The tick, Ixodes dammini, can infect both the white-footed mouse and large mammals such as deer during its life cycle, making them reservoirs. The tick itself is a reservoir, however, since it acquires the disease through transovarial passage of the organism. Together, these factors make Lyme disease an endemic infection with little hope for eradication. Borrelia burgdorferi is not resistant to antibiotics and disinfectants. The spirochete can be successfully treated with penicillins, tetracycline, and ceftriaxone. Borrelia burgdorferi is a delicate spirochete and is not resistant to environmental stresses. Brill-Zinsser disease is the reactivation of epidemic typhus infection caused by Rickettsia prowazekii. It can occur many years after an infection that was not treated with antibiotics.

In the carbolfuchsin (Ziehl-Neelsen) procedure, acid-fast organisms appear red against a blue background, while in the fluorochrome procedures (auramine-O, auramine-rhodamine), the acid-fast organisms appear as fluorescent rods, yellow to orange (the colour may vary with the filter system used) against a paler yellow or orange background.

Clinical presentation \u25cf Patients present with a firmt well-defined, mobile mass often in the periphery of the breast. \u25cf There is usually no nipple discharge. Pathology \u25cf Papillary proliferation of the ductal epithelium which partly fills up smaller ducts causing distension. \u25cf Grossly, well-circumscribed mass containing multiple small cysts (<2 cm) within a dense fibrous stroma (therefore sometimes termed swiss cheese disease by pathologists). \u25cf Lesions can vary in size, usually ranging from 1 to 8 cm. Radiographic features Breast ultrasound \u25cf They can appear as an ill-defined, inhomogenous hypoechoic mass with multiple small (up to 4mm) predominantly peripheral cysts. \u25cf Microcalcifications may be seen at sonography. Mammography \u25cf These lesions are usually negative on mammography. \u25cf Occasionally may show microcalcifications, an asymmetric density or a prominant intraductal pattern. Galactography \u25cf May show a multiple irregular filling defects within the breasts. Breast MRI Signal characteristics according to one report include \u25cf T1: hypo-intense lobulated mass \u25cf T2: may show- presence of multiple small internal cysts, best shown on this sequence and is considered the most specific feature \u25cf T1 C+ (Gd): may or may not show marked rapid enhancement \u25cf Dynamic sequence: shows a benign enhancement profile.

A: Slide flocculation test The VDRL test for syphilis is an example of slide flocculation Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test/ VDRL It is a blood test for syphilis and was developed by the former Venereal Disease Research Laboratory, now the Treponemal Pathogenesis and Immunology Branch, of the United States Public Health Service. Its first iteration being that developed by August Paul von Wasserman with the aid of Albe Neisser in 1906. The RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) test uses the same antigen as the VDRL, but in that test it has been bound to several other molecules including a carbon paicle to allow visualization of the flocculation reaction without the need of a microscope. The (VDRL) is a nontreponemal serological screening for syphilis that is also used to assess response to therapy, to detect CNS involvement, and as an aid in the diagnosis of congenital syphilis. The basis of the test is that an antibody produced by a patient with syphilis reacts with an extract of ox heart (diphosphatidyl glycerol). It therefore detects anti-cardiolipin antibodies (IgG, IgM or IgA), visualized through foaming of the test tube fluid, or \"flocculation\". Many other medical conditions can produce false positive results, including some viruses (mononucleosis, hepatitis), drugs, pregnancy, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid ahritis, lupus, and leprosy. The syphilis anti-cardiolipin antibodies are beta-2 glycoprotein independent, where as those that occur in the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (associated to lupus for example) are beta-2 glycoprotein dependent, and this can be used to tell them apa in an ELISA assay. This test is very useful as the trend of titres are correlated to disease activity (i. e. falling titres indicate successful treatment). It has a very good sensitivity for syphilis, except in late teiary form There are a number of treponemal-specific tests such as the Fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTAABS) test, Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assays (TPHA and MHA-TP), Treponema pallidum paicle agglutination assay (TP-PA), and the Toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST) which may be used to confirm a positive VDRL result. These tests are more specific for syphilis than non-treponemal tests and, in the presence of a positive test, more likely indicate active infection. Other treponemal infections such as yaws, bejel and pinta and possibly nonpathogenic commensal treponemes can result in a positive. All treponemal specific tests will remain positive for life once a person has been infected with syphilis, even if syphilis has been adequately treated. Therefore, these types of tests cannot be used to monitor the treatment of syphilis.",

B: H antigen The H antigen is strongly immunogenic and induces antibody formation rapidly and in high titres following infection or immunization Somatic (O) or Cell Wall Antigens They are heat stable and alcohol resistant. Surface (Envelope) Antigens Commonly observed in other genera of enteric bacteria (e. g., Escherichia coli and Klebsiella), may be found in some Salmonella serovars. Surface antigens in Salmonella may mask O antigens, and the bacteria will not be agglutinated with O antisera. One specific surface antigen is well known: the Vi antigen. Vi antigen The Vi antigen occurs in only three Salmonella serovars (out of about 2, 200): Typhi, Paratyphi C, and Dublin. Strains of these three serovars may or may not have the Vi antigen. Flagellar (H) Antigens Flagellar antigens are heat-labile proteins. Strongly immunogenic; induces antibody formation rapidly and in high titres following infection or immunization Mixing salmonella cells with flagella-specific antisera gives a characteristic pattern of agglutination (bacteria are loosely attached to each other by their flagella and can be dissociated by shaking). Also, antiflagellar antibodies can immobilize bacteria with corresponding H antigens. A few Salmonella enterica serovars (e. g., Enteritidis, Typhi) produce flagella which always have the same antigenic specificity. Such an H antigen is then called monophasic. Most Salmonella serovars, however, can alternatively produce flagella with two different H antigenic specificities. The H antigen is then called diphasic.",
