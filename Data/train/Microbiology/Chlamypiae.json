        "question": "True about chlamydia-",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., He. La ceils for isolation Enique properties of chlamvdiae areo Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular parasite. This means they can survive only by establishig residence inside animal cells. o They need their host's ATP as an energy source for their own cellular activity. They are energy parasites using a cell membrane transport system that uses ATP from the host system and gives out ADP. o This obligate intracellular existence makes it impossible to culture these organisms on nonliving artificial media. Due to their small size and failure to grow in cell - free media they were considered to be viruses, o Chlamydiae grows in cultures of a variety of eukaryotic cell lines Me Coy or He. La cells. It may be necessary to treat cells with polyanionic compounds such as DEAD-dextran to reduce the electrostatic barrier to infection. Antimetabolite such as cycloheximide is added to favour competition for host cell amino acid pools. All types of chlamydiae proliferate in embryonated eggs particulary in the yolk sac. o The special features in structure and chemical composition of chlamydiae are: The outer cell wall resembles the cell wall of gram negative bacteria. It has a relatively high lipid content. It is rigid but it does not contain typical bacterial peptidoglycan; perhaps it contain a tetrapeptide linked matrix. N Acetylmuramic acid also appears to be absent from chlamydiae cell wall, o Antibiotic susceptibility of chlamydiae: Penicillin binding proteins occur in chlamydiae cell wall and chlamydiae cell wall formation is inhibited by penicillins and other drugs that inhibit transpeptidation of bacterial peptidoglycan. But remember the important point about t/t, that cell wall inhibitors result in the production of morphologically defective forms but are not effective in clinical disease. o Inhibitors of protein synthesis (tetracyclines, erythromycins) are effective in most clinical infections. Erythromycin or tetracyclines are considered the drug of choice for chlamydiae infections.",

Chlamydia* Obligate intracellular parasites* Obligate intracellular parasite* Contain only one type of nucleic acid either DNA or RNA* Possess both DNA and RNA* Lack enzymes for protein/ nucleic acid synthesis. Depends on synthetic machinery of host for replication* Multiply by complex process(not by binary fission)* Unaffected by antibacterial antibiotics.* Have cell wall and ribosomes* Multiply by binary fission* Susceptible to usual antibiotics. The disease caused by various chlamydia are as follows: Chlamydia trachomatis: 1. Serotype A, B. C2. Serotype D to K- Trachoma- Inclusion conjunctivitis. Genital chlamydiasis. Infant pneumonia3. Serotypes L1. L2. L3- Lymphogranuloma venerum. Chlamydia psittaci--causes psittacosis. Chlamydia pneumoniae--causes acute respiratory disease. Inclusion bodies in chlamydia: Halberstaedter Prowazek (HP bodies). Levinthal Cole Lillie (LCL bodies). Miyagawas granulo corpscles (elementary body)- C. trachomatis- C. psittaci- LGVHorders spots- a faint macular spot (like rose spots of typhoid fever) is seen in psittacosis.
