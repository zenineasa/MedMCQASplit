RE can produce 'sticky' and 'blunt1 ends.# Analysis of RFLP variation is an important tool in genomic mapping, localization of genetic disease, determination of risk for a disease, genetic fingerprinting, and paternity testing.# It is the sequence that makes DNA different, obtained from different sources, and RFLP analysis is a technique that can identify differences in the sequence (when they occur in a restriction site).# The basic technique for detecting RFLPs involves fragmenting a sample of DNA by restriction enzymes, which can recognize and cut DNA wherever a specific short sequence occurs, by a process known as a restriction digest. The resulting DNA fragments are then separated by length through a process known as agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to membrane via the Southern blot procedure. Hybridization of the membrane to a labelled DNA probe then determines the size of the fragments which are complementary to the probe. An RFLP occurs when the size of a detected fragment varies between individuals. Each fragment size is considered an allele, and can be used in genetic analysis.

See APPENDIX-19 for list of \"CYTOKINES\"Synthesis of Interferons. Interferons are produced by all vertebrate species. Normal cells do not generally synthesize interferon until they are induced to do so. Infection with viruses is a potent insult leading to induction; RNA viruses are stronger inducers of interferon than DNA viruses. Interferons also can be induced by double-stranded RNA, bacterial endotoxin, and small molecules such as tilorone. IFN-g is not produced in response to most viruses but is induced by mitogen stimulation. The different classes of interferon are produced by different cell types. IFN-a and IFN-b are synthesized by many cell types, but IFN-g is produced mainly by lymphocytes, especially T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Dendritic cells are potent interferon producers; under the same virus challenge conditions, dendritic cells can secrete up to l000x more interferon than fibroblasts. APPENDIX -19. Cytokines: Name.

The phenotype (main outward appearance) of the mouse is a lack of body hair, which gives it the \"nude\" nickname. The nude mouse is valuable to research because it can receive many different types of tissue and tumor grafts, as it mounts no rejection response.

Hvbridomaso Hybridomas are cells that have been engineered to produce a specific antibody in huge numberso To achieve this, qualities of two types of cells have to be combined together Le. Cells which can produce large amount of pure antibody, and. Cells which have the ability to grow- continually. o These two types of cells are then fused together to form hybridoma. Procedureo The pure antibody secreting cells are produced by injecting specific antigen in a mouse and obtaining the antigen specific plasma cells (antibody producing cell) from the mouse's spleen, o Ceil which can grow indefinitely in culture are myeloma cells (cancerous cells). o These two cell lines are fused together. The hybrid cell which is thus produced can be cloned to produce large number of identical daughter clones. o These daughter clone cells then produce antibodies. Since these antibodies come from only one type of cell {hybridoma cell) they are called monoclonal antibodies. o HAT (hypoxanthine, Aminopterin and thymidine) medium is used for preparation of monoclonal antibodies because it allows only fused hybridoma cells to grow. It does not allow the unfused myeloma and unfused antibody cells to grow. So HAT medium is a selective medium which allows (which allow selective growth offused hybridoma). How does this happen? o Before we move on with the discussion, remember these few points about purine synthesis. o Purine synthesis is essential for the survival of cells. Purine can be synthesized in two way i. e. De novo synthesis (dihydrofolate reductase enzyme is required for this pathway). Salvage pathway (an enzyme hypoxanthine - guanine phosphoribosyl transferase is required for salvage pathways)o Myeloma cells lack HGPRTase enzyme therefore they cannot synthesize purine by salvage pathways, o Antibody cells have HGPRTase enzyme so they can use the salvage pathways, o Aminopterin inhibits dihydrofolate reductase an enzyme used in denovo synthesis of purineo When two cell lines i. e. antibody producing cell and myeloma cells are grown in HAT medium only the fused hybridoma cells survive. Myeloma cells die because they lack the enzyme HGPRTase so they cannot use the salvage pathways for purine synthesis. They also cannot use de-novo pathway, because Aminopterin present in the HAT medium inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (an enzyme essential for denovo synthesis ofpurine). o The unfused antibody producing cells die as they cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span, o Only fused hybridoma cells grow indefinitely because the antibody cell partner supplies HGPRTase and the myeloma partner gives it immortality, (as it is a cancer cell)",

Herd immunity* Vaccination provides excellent protection to a population, even if not every individual in a population is vaccinated, because of a phenomenon known as \"herd immunity\".* When a great percentage of population is already vaccinated, the infectious agent will face great difficulty to find an unprotected individual and spread the disease.* The population becomes resistant as a whole.* But herd immunity has its own limitations. If a significant number of unvaccinated individuals enter the population and contract the disease, then the infection will spread quickly to the remainder of unvaccinated people. Tolerance is simply defined as unresponsiveness of immune system to an antigen. Genetic drift is the minor genetic change that occurs due to mutations, or changes in the genetic material of a population sample. Immune evasion is a mechanism by which microbes and tumors evade host's immune response. Genetic shift is the major genetic change.

If the antibodies agglutinate with the antigen to form immune complexes, then the test is interpreted as positive. However, if too many antibodies are present that can bind to the antigen, then the antigenic sites are coated by antibodies, and few or no antibodies directed toward the pathogen are able to bind more than one antigenic paicle. Since the antibodies do not bridge between antigens, no agglutination occurs. Because no agglutination occurs, the test is interpreted as negative. In this case, the result is a false negative. The range of relatively high antibody concentrations within which no reaction occurs is called the prozone. Examples include high levels of syphilis antibodies in HIV patients or high levels of cryptococcal antigen leading to false negative tests in undiluted samples.

        "exp": "A virgin B-cell bears IgM (and possibly IgD) in its membrane; following stimulation it begins to secrete IgM into its surrounding environment. The difference between the two forms of IgM is entirely at the C-terminus. The ms (secreted) chain has a hydrophilic peptide additional to the Cm4 domain and the mm (membrane-bound) chain has a hydrophobic peptide replacing the former which anchors the molecule into the membrane. The membrane-bound form of IgM is also incapable of associating with J-chain and forming its normal pentameric structure; membrane IgM, therefore, exists exclusively in monomeric form (H2. L2), also known as Ig. MS or \"sub-unit\" IgM. Difference arises because the ms and mm chains are translated from distinct m. RNA molecules that are generated by alternative splicing and/or termination points of transcripts from a single rearranged m gene. Similar differences exist for secreted versus membrane-bound forms of IgG, IgA and IgE heavy chains. The immunoglobulin gene encodes both membrane-associated and secreted proteins through alternative RNA processing reactions. The regulatory mechanisms governing alternative RNA processing involves gene coding for competing cleavage-polyadenylation and RNA splicing reactions and the relative use of the two pathways is differentially regulated between B cells and plasma cells. General cleavage-polyadenylation and RNA splicing reactions are both altered during B cell maturation to affect immunoglobulin expression. Not the others options due to following points... Each B cell is known to express a unique combination of immunoglobulin chains, where each V-J and V-D-J recombination is different. A single productive rearrangement of each type occurs in a given lymphocyte to produce one light and one heavy chain gene. Because each event involves the expression of genes of only one homologous chromosome, the alleles on the other homologous chromosome is not expressed in this same cell. This is called allelic exclusion. Assembly of the light and heavy chains during reaarangement of the variable region of immunoglobulins involves the mechanism indicated by the presence of conserved sequences at the boundaries of all germ line segments that paicipate in joining reactions. Each conserved sequence consist of a palindromic hepatamer called recombination signal sequences (RSS). These act as facilitators of recombination process. These sequences correspond to one or two turns of DNA helix accordingly called one turn or two turn signal sequences Class switching is a process by which on antigenic stimulation, the H chain VDJ unit can join any constant heavy gene segment and express the paicular antibody class.

        "question": "In PCR, Acquaticus thermophilus is preferred over E. coli because: (PGI Dec 2007)",
        "exp": "Ans: A (Thermostable at temperature at which DNA liquefies) By using a heat stable DNA polymerase9 (for example. Taq polymerase) from a bacterium ('thermus aquations') that normally lives at high temperature, the polymerase is not denatured & therefore, does not have to added at each successive cycle\"- Lippintcott. Biochemistry 4th/482. Polymerase Chain Reaction. PCR provides a sensitive, selective & extremely rapid means of amplifying a desired sequence of DNA. Twenty cycles provide an amplificationQ of 106 & 30 cycles of 109 - Harper 27th/410-11. SpecificityQ is based on the use of two oligonucleotide primers that hybridize to complementary sequence on opposite strands of DNA & flank the target sequence. Double stranded DNA can be disrupted by heat or high pH, giving rise to single stranded DNA. The single stranded DNAQ serves as a template for synthesis of a complementary strand by replicating enzymes, the DNA polymerase. Early PCR reaction usedanE. coli DNA polymerase that was destroyed by each heat denaturation cycle. Substitution of a heat-stable DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) from Thermus aquaticus, obviates this problem & has made possible automation of the reaction, since the polymerase reactions can be run at 70deg. CPCR is a cyclic process & cycle contains three steps that involves (Chatterjea & Shinde). DenaturationQ of DNA duplex (94-98degC). AnnealingQ of primers (37-60degC). ExtensionQ of the primers with a polymerase in the presence of d. NTP (about 720C)DNA polymerase amplifies DNA in PCR, Early PCR used an E coli, DNA polymerase that was destroyed by each heat generation cycles i. e. polymerase was denatured. This difficulty is solved by using heats table DNA polymerase from 'thermusaquaticuS'\". which can withstand 70deg to 80deg C. Therefore polymerase has not to be added in each cycle.",

A variety of supports can be used, such as polystyrene microdilution plates, paddles, plastic beads, and tubes. The number of layers in the antibody-antigen sandwich varies; usually as additional layers are added, detection sensitivity is increased. The two most common enzymes are horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP). b-Galactosidase has also been employed.

During development, T cells undergo both positive selection and negative selection, while B cells undergo only negative selection. Class I MHC is expressed in on both T cells and B cells. Class I MHC molecules are expressed on nearly all nucleated cells. Since both T cells and B cells are nucleated, both of them express class I MHC molecules. Antigen receptors are found in both T cells and B cells.

Development of LymphocytesB-cell Development (Negative selection)T-cell Development (Positive selection followed by negative selection)* Immature B cells expressing membrane IgM do not proliferate and differentiate in response to antigens.* Their encounter with antigens (which are usually 'self as only' self antigens are present at that time) in the bone marrow leads to death (apoptosis) or functional irresponsiveness This property is called negative selectionQ.* B cell negative selection occurs in the bone marrow.* T cells are selected for survival much more rigorously since they should be able to recognize 'self' MHC molecules, but should not recognize 'self' peptides.* Initially immature T cells that recognize MHC molecules are selected and saved from programmed cell death. This is called positive selection and ensures that T cells only recognize antigens in association with MHC (This is important since T cells need to identify and react with infected host cells).* Next amongst positively selected immature T cells, those T cells that react strongly with 'self-peptides' on MHC molecules undergo negative selectionQ and apoptotic death leading to elimination of immature T cells specific for self antigens. This second step is called negative selection.* T cells positive and negative selection occurs in thymusQ. Central T cell tolerance is established by positive and negative selection in the thymus while central B cells tolerance is established by negative selection in the bone marrowQ.",
