Also known as spreading factor, hyaluronidase plays a role in GAS cellulitis. Erythrogenic toxin (a) is a superantigen produced by some strain of GAS lysogenized by a bacteriophage carrying the toxin gene; it causes the rash of scarlet fever. A second superantigen, streptococcal pyrogenic toxin, causes streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.

Generalised - When it involves any segment of donor DNA2. Restricted - When a specific bacteriophage transduces only a particular genetic trait eg. prophage lambda in E coli K 12 (Gal +gene - Determines fermentation of galactose)* Transduction is not confined to transfer of chromosomal DNA, episomes and plasmid may also be transduced.* The plasmid determining penicillin resistance in staphylococci are transferred from cell to cell by transduction.* Transduction appears to be the most widespread mechanism of gene transfer among prokaryotes.* Transduction is an excellent tool for the genetic mapping of bacteria.* Transduction has been proposed as a method of genetic engineering in the treatment of some inborn errors of metabolism. Lysogenic conversion* In lysogenic conversion the phage DNA itself is the new genetic element as it becomes integrated with the bacterial host DNA with which it multiplies and is transferred to daughter cells, e. g. diptheriae corynebacterium. T ransformation* This is the transfer of genetic material through the agency of free DNA (May involve taking up of soluble DNA with host DNA and codes new species through the cell wall).* Transformation was the first example of genetic exchange (horizontal gene transfer) in bacteria to have been discovered.* It was demonstrated in Streptococcus pneumoniae by Griffith in 1928.* Other organisms in which transformation has been studied are Bacillus, Haemophilus and BPH. Conjugation* Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacteria through direct cell to cell contact or through a bridge- like connection between two cells.* Conjugation is process where by a donor (male) bacterium makes physical contact with a recipient (female) bacterium.* Donor status is determined by the presence of plasmid.* This plasmid codes for specialized fimbria (sex pilus) and for self transfer.* Sex pilus (conjugation tube) helps in transfer of genetic material from male bacterium to female bacterium.* The plasmid is known as transfer factor (sex factor or fertility factor).* Plasmid may be Rfactor, which codes for transferable multiple drug resistance.* The DNA of the plasmid replicates during transfer so that each bacterium receives a copy - Recipient becomes donor and the donor retains its donor status. Summary. Gene transfer in bacteriaa) Transformation-Transfer of genetic material through the agency of free DNA (may involve taking up soluble DNA fragments across their cell wall from other species). b) Transduction-Transfer of a portion of. DNA by bacteriophage (a virus). c) Conjugation-Transfer of genetic material by physical contact. d) Lysogenic conversion-Incorporation of phage DNA into host DNA.",

Standard practice in sterilization process is to include sterility indicator along with the articles to be sterilized. The use of sterility indicators allows a direct and sensitive approach to test the effectiveness of the sterilization process. Sterility indicators can be biological or chemical Biological indicatorsA biological indicator is broadly defined as a characteristic preparation of specific microorganism that provides a defined and stable resistance to specific sterilization procedures. The biological indicators selected should provide a greater challenge to the sterilization process than the bioburden in or on the product. Microorganisms widely recognized as biological indicators are spore forming bacterias because these organisms are significantly more resistant than the normal - With the exception of ionizing radiation process, these microorganisms are significantly more resistant than the normal microflora. A biological indicator can be used to assist in the performance qualification of the sterilization equipment and in the development and establishment of a validated sterilization process for a particular process. \"Bioloeical indicator used in plasma sterilization is Bacillus stearothermophilus \". Plasma sterilization. Plasma is described as the fourth state of matter (It is neither liquid, gas nor solid). It is defined as reactive cloud of ionized atoms, electrons and neutral atomic particles. In order to generate the plasma for sterilization, matter (for example H2. O2) a gaseous state is exposed to strong electrical or magnetic field. This is performed in a vacuum so that high temperature are not required. In practice, a hydrogen peroxide solution is dispersed in a vacuum chamber creating a plasma cloud. This result in the generation (ionisation) of a cloud of charged particles and free radicals that interact with vital cell component. The free radicals generated during this process interacts with vital cell component (mainly nucleic acids and destroy them). Sterilization occurs as a result of the dual phase process of the oxidative properties of the vapour and plasma. Gas plasma is capable of penetrating medical packaging, is safe to use and the sterilization cycles are easy to control and monitor. The temperature attained in these process is not very high so there is no risk of damage of the instruments as in Heat methods.

The media containing ingredients which enhance their growth-promoting qualities are enriched media e. g. blood agar, chocolate agar and Loeffler medium. The usual media employed for cultivation of the diphtheria bacillus are Loeffler's serum slope and tellurite blood agar. Diphtheria bacilli grow on Loeffler's serum slope very rapidly and colonies can be seen in 6-8 hours, long before the other bacteria grow. TYPES OF Bacteriological Media Media. Commente. g. 1. Ordinary culture media. These are routinely employed in a laboratorye. g. nutrient broth, nutrient agar, infusion broth and lysate media. 2. Enriched media. Certain organisms do not grow on ordinary nutrient media. They require growth- promoting ingredients such as blood, glucose, serum, egg, etc. The media containing ingredients which enhance their growth- promoting qualities are enriched mediae. g. blood agar, chocolate agar and Loeffler medium. 3. Enrichment media. Enrichment media are liquid media containing chemical constituents which inhibit some normal flora and allow pathogens which may be present in very small number in the specimen, to grow unhampered and thus enriching them. Isolated colonies of these organisms may be obtained by subculturing onto solid media. An example of enrichment media is selenite F broth used for primary isolation of enteric bacteria. 4. Differential/ Indicator media. Differential media have got some chemical constituents which characterize different bacteria by their special colonial appearances in the culture e. g. Mac. Conkey agar contains lactose as a substrate and neutral red as an indicator. Bacteria fermenting lactose produce acid and this will change the colour of the indicator and thus the colonies will turn red. The red lactose fermenting colonies can be differentiated from the pale non-lactose fermenting colonies. 1. Eosin methylene blue (EMB), which is differential for lactose and sucrose fermentation2. Mac. Conkey (MCK), which is differential for lactose fermentation3. mannitol salt agar (MSA), which is differential for mannitol fermentation4. X-gal plates, which are differential for lac operon mutants5. Selective media. Selective media will selectively permit the growth of pathogens and inhibit the commensals. In addition, it may differentiate the pathogen from commensals that grow by the colour and opacity of the coloniese. g. blood tellurite medium for C. diphtheriae. Buffered charcoal yeast extract agar, which is selective for certain gram-negative bacteria, especially Legionella pneumophila6. Transport media. Transport media are also frequently used to sustain the viability of organisms when a clinical specimen is to be transported from the periphery to laboratory. The transport medium prevents the outgrowth of contaminants during transit and sustains the pathogen. Cary and Blair and Stuart media. Venkat-Ramakrishnan(VR) medium for v. cholerae. Thioglycolate broth for strict anaerobes. Loeffler Media. It is primarily used for the isolation of Corynebacterium diphtheriae from clinical specimens. It is also used to determine the proteolytic activity and pigment production of various microorganisms. PRINCIPLE: Recovery is further enhanced when Loeffler Media is used in combination with Potassium Tellurite Cystine. Agar Media and blood agar. On Loeffler Media, C. diphtheriae produces characteristic metachromatic granules that can be detected by staining with methylene blue; it also demonstrates the characteristic Chinese-letter formation which is due to the cells snapping off when they divide. With the above information, a presumptive identification can result in 16-18 hours. Loeffler Media enhances the demonstration of the organism's natural morphological and physiological characteristics, i. e. pigmentation. FORMULA: Approximate, per 250 ml of deionized filtered water.

Transformation# A phenomenon in which transfer of genetic information occurs through the agency of free DNA.# Certain cell lines, such as cancer cells, are also able to grow indefinitely in culture by this mechanism. Transduction# Transfer of a portion of DNA from one bacteria to another by bacteriophage.# It is not confined to transfer of chromosomal DNA; it transduces episomes and plasmids also.# Bacteriophages are viruses that parasitise bacteria and consist of nucleic acid core and a protein coat.# It is excellent tool for genetic mapping of bacteria. Lysogenic conversion# Phage DNA becomes integrated with bacterial chromosome as prophage, which multiplies synchronously with host DNA and is transferred to daughter cells; this is lysogeny and bacteria harbouring prophages are lysogenic bacteria.# In transduction, phage acts only as vehicle carrying bacterial genes from one cell to another, but in lysogenic conversion, phage DNA itself is new genetic element. Conjugation# The process whereby 'male' or 'donor' bacteria mates or makes physical contact with female or recipient bacteria and transfers genetic element into it. Sexduction# Process of transfer of host genes through f factor, resembles transduction. Transfection# Transfer of a gene into a cell, enabling the transfected cell to form a new gene product.",

It activates the complement and stimulates the influx of phagocytes leading to the purulent discharge. LOS also contributes to serum resistance, which is an important feature of strains that causes systemic infection. Rapidly growing Neisseria releases outer membrane blebs, which contain LOS. Pili (e) mediate the initial attachment of N. gonorrhoeae to the surface of cervical or urethral epithelial cells. Pili are attached to the cell surface and are not released. The opacity protein (d), which provides N. gonorrhoeae colonies with their opaque appearance, is an outer membrane protein. It mediates binding of N. gonorrhoeae to epithelial cells and plays a role in cell-to-cell signaling. Similar to the pili, the opacity protein is a cell-associated factor. The capsule (a) surrounds pathogenic bacteria and provides them with antiphagocytic properties. However, N. gonorrhoeae is not encapsulated.

The individuals presented with symptoms of food poisoning, including watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps, 8 to 10 hours later. The symptoms lasted 24 hours. The agent that caused the symptoms is most likely which of the following?",
        "exp": "Under harsh environmental conditions, certain gram-positive bacteria convert from the vegetative state into a dormant state or spore. The spores, which are dehydrated structures, protect bacterial DNA and other contents from the effect of the intense heat, radiation, and standard disinfectants. If spores present in the food are not killed during preparation, and if the cooked food is left for several hours at room temperature, the spores will germinate allowing vegetative bacteria to produce the enterotoxin. The spore-forming gram-positive bacteria (a), Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus, produce enterotoxins that cause watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps but no fever. While very similar, the vignette suggests C. perfringens as the etiologic agent. Onset is more rapid than with B. cereus diarrheal toxin, and while the types of food overlap, temperature-abused food is frequently associated with C. perfringens. Among the gram-positive cocci (b), Staphylococcus aureus produces enterotoxin, but the onset is more abrupt (1-6 hours) and fever may be present. The gram-negative bacilli (a) must first colonize the intestine and grow, even if an enterotoxin is at the root of the diarrhea. Thus, onset of symptoms occurs from 24 hours to several days after ingestion of the food. Opportunistic fungi (d) are not known to be involved in food poisoning. Enteric viruses (e) such as norovirus and rotavirus require 12 to 48 hours and 1 to 3 days, respectively, for symptoms to appear. They are more commonly associated with foods contaminated by food workers during preparation (salads, sandwiches, and fruit), or food prepared with contaminated water (salads, fruit, and ice).",

Most rigid endoscopes are compatible with steam, formaldehyde, ethylene oxide and certain liquid chemical disinfectants. Flexible scope can be sterilized by peracetic acid. CHEMICAL STERILIZATION# Ethylene oxide (EO or EtO) gas- Most common sterilization method.- Used to sterilize objects sensitive to temperatures > 60degC such as plastics, optics and electrics.- Carried out at 30-60degC with relative humidity >30% & gas cone. 200-800 mg/L for at least 3 hrs.- ETO penetrates well, moving through paper, cloth, and some plastic films and is highly effective.- EtO can kill all known viruses, bacteria and fungi; including bacterial spores and is satisfactory.- Bacillus subtilis, a very resistant organism, is used as a rapid biological indicator for EO sterilizers.# Glutaraldehyde# Glutaraldehyde is a saturated dialdehyde that has gained wide acceptance as a high-level disinfectant and chemical sterilant.# It is specifically effective against tubercle bacilli, fungi, and viruses.# Has a short shelf life (<2 weeks), and is expensive.# It is less toxic and irritant to eyes than formaldehyde.# To kill all spores in liquid can take upto 12 hrs with gluteraldehyde & longer with formaldehyde.# It has no deleterious effect on the cement or lenses of instruments like cystoscopes and bronchoscopes.# It can safely be used to treat corrugated rubber anesthetic tubes and face masks, plastic endotracheal tubes, polythene tubing, and metal instruments.# CIDEX (2% gluteraldehyde) is commonly used for sterilization of endoscopes.# Formaldehyde# It is less expensive and has a much longer shelf life, but is much more volatile.# Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent.# Many vaccines, such as the original Salk polio vaccine, are sterilized with formaldehyde.# Ozone is used in industrial settings to sterilize water and air, as well as a disinfectant for surfaces. It has the benefit of being able to oxidize most organic matter. On the other hand, it is a toxic and unstable gas that must be produced onsite, so it is not practical to use in many settings.# Chlorine bleach is another accepted liquid sterilizing agent. Household bleach consists of 5. 25% sodium hypochlorite. It is usually diluted to 1/10 immediately before use; however to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis it should be diluted only 1/5. The dilution factor must take into account the volume of any liquid waste that it is being used to sterilize. Bleach will kill many organisms immediately, but for full sterilization it should be allowed to react for 20 minutes. Bleach will kill many, but not all spores. It is highly corrosive and may corrode even stainless steel surgical instruments.# Chlorine and Na. OH are the most consistent agents for prions. Chlorine is too corrosive to use on certain objects.

The supervisor discovers that the last 50 specimens tested were positive. However, companion cultures were positive for only 15 of the specimens. What is the most likely reason for this discrepancy?",
        "exp": "In general, real-time PCR is more sensitive than culture (a), due to the ability of the assay to detect very few copies of bacterial DNA present in the specimen. Recently, many clinical laboratories have begun using real-time PCR for the mecA gene or the SCC mec cassette that carries mecA to detect the presence of MRSA in nasal specimens collected from patients upon admission to the hospital. Numerous studies have shown that the sensitivity of real-time PCR is slightly higher than that of optimally performed chromogenic culture for MRSA. However, even at 85% sensitivity, if the 50 positive samples were true positives, one would expect to have recovered 42 to 43 isolates in the companion cultures rather than 15. Real-time PCR was thought to be more specific than culture (b), but the appearance of increasing numbers of mecA gene variations has led to false-negative results due to primer mismatch and failure to amplify the gene even when present. Detecting SCC mec was thought to be the solution to this problem, only to come under fire because the same SCC mec cassette found in community-acquired MRSA is present in methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, leading to misclassification of patients with MRSE. This finding has led to the development of multiplex PCR tests that detect genes specific for S. aureus in addition to the mecA gene. Unfortunately, many laboratories have implemented nucleic acid testing without having access to dedicated space for sample preparation and the PCR instrument, as described in the vignette. This frequently leads to contamination of the PCR workstation with MRSA DNA (d), which is then amplified in the reaction producing a false-positive result. Failure of the thermocycler, the PCR instrument, because it needs to be calibrated (c), is a possibility, but should have been addressed through required instrument maintenance and running of appropriate controls.",

Blood culture contamination has been a common problem for decades which continues to be the cause of a diagnostic confusion and frustration for the clinicians and laboratory personnel alike. Prevalence of pathogens causing BSI, and their antibiotic susceptibility pattern do help to develop local antimicrobial guidelines. o.

Generalised - When it involves any segment of donor DNA2. Restricted - When a specific bacteriophage transduces only a particular genetic trait eg. prophage lambda in E coli K 12 (Gal +gene - Determines fermentation of galactose)* Transduction is not confined to transfer of chromosomal DNA, episomes and plasmid may also be transduced.* The plasmid determining penicillin resistance in staphylococci are transferred from cell to cell by transduction.* Transduction appears to be the most widespread mechanism of gene transfer among prokaryotes.* Transduction is an excellent tool for the genetic mapping of bacteria.* Transduction has been proposed as a method of genetic engineering in the treatment of some inborn errors of metabolism. Lysogenic conversion* In lysogenic conversion the phage DNA itself is the new genetic element as it becomes integrated with the bacterial host DNA with which it multiplies and is transferred to daughter cells, e. g. diptheriae corynebacterium. T ransformation* This is the transfer of genetic material through the agency of free DNA (May involve taking up of soluble DNA with host DNA and codes new species through the cell wall).* Transformation was the first example of genetic exchange (horizontal gene transfer) in bacteria to have been discovered.* It was demonstrated in Streptococcus pneumoniae by Griffith in 1928.* Other organisms in which transformation has been studied are Bacillus, Haemophilus and BPH. Conjugation* Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacteria through direct cell to cell contact or through a bridge- like connection between two cells.* Conjugation is process where by a donor (male) bacterium makes physical contact with a recipient (female) bacterium.* Donor status is determined by the presence of plasmid.* This plasmid codes for specialized fimbria (sex pilus) and for self transfer.* Sex pilus (conjugation tube) helps in transfer of genetic material from male bacterium to female bacterium.* The plasmid is known as transfer factor (sex factor or fertility factor).* Plasmid may be Rfactor, which codes for transferable multiple drug resistance.* The DNA of the plasmid replicates during transfer so that each bacterium receives a copy - Recipient becomes donor and the donor retains its donor status. Summary. Gene transfer in bacteriaa) Transformation-Transfer of genetic material through the agency of free DNA (may involve taking up soluble DNA fragments across their cell wall from other species). b) Transduction-Transfer of a portion of. DNA by bacteriophage (a virus). c) Conjugation-Transfer of genetic material by physical contact. d) Lysogenic conversion-Incorporation of phage DNA into host DNA.",

Ananthanarayan, Microbiology, 7th/ 31, 86)# Glutaraldehyde:- Is specifically effective against tubercle bacilli, fungi, and viruses.- Glutaraldehyde has a short shelf life (<2 weeks), and is expensive.- It is less toxic and irritant to eyes than formaldehyde.- It has no deleterious effect on the cement or lenses of instruments like cystoscopes and bronchoscopes.- It can safely be used to treat corrugated rubber anaesthetic tubes and face masks, plastic endotracheal tubes, polythene tubing, and metal instruments.# CIDEX (2% gluteraldehyde) is commonly used for sterilization of endoscopes.# Most rigid endoscopes are compatible with steam, formaldehyde, ethylene oxide and certain liquid chemical disinfectants.# Flexible scopes can also be sterilized by peracetic acid. Ethylene oxide (EO or EtO) gas# Is commonly used to sterilize objects sensitive to temperatures greater than 60degC such as plastics, optics and electrics.# Ethylene oxide treatment is generally carried out between 30degC and 60degC with relative humidity above 30% and a gas concentration between 200-800 mg/L for at least three hours.# Ethylene oxide penetrates well, moving through paper, cloth, and some plastic films and is highly effective.# Ethylene oxide sterilizers are used to process sensitive instruments which cannot be well sterilized by other methods.# EtO can kill all known viruses, bacteria and fungi, including bacterial spores and is satisfactory for most medical materials, even with repeated use.# However it is highly flammable, and requires a longer time to sterilize than any heat treatment.# Ethylene oxide is the most common sterilization method. used for over 70% of total sterilizations. and for 50% of all disposable medical devices.# Bacillus subtilis, a very resistant organism, is used as a rapid biological indicator for EO sterilizers. If sterilization fails, incubation at 37degC causes a fluorescent change within four hours, which is read by an auto-reader. The color change indicates a pH shift due to bacterial metabolism. Formaldehyde solutions# Like Glutaraldehyde, it is also accepted liquid sterilizing agents# Immersion time is sufficiently long (To kill all spores in a clear liquid can take up to 12 hours with glutaraldehyde and even longer with formaldehyde). Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent.# Many vaccines, such as the original Salk polio vaccine, are sterilized with formaldehyde. OZONE# Is used in industrial settings to sterilize water and air, as well as a disinfectant for surfaces.# It has the benefit of being able to oxidize most organic matter.# It is a toxic and unstable gas that must be produced on-site, so it is not practical to use in many settings. CHLORINE BLEACH# Household bleach consists of 5. 25% sodium hypochlorite.# It is usually diluted to 1/10 immediately before use; however to kill M. tuberculosis it should be diluted only 1/5.# Bleach will kill many organisms immediately, but for full sterilization it should react for 20 min.# Bleach will kill many, but not all spores.# It is highly corrosive and may corrode even stainless steel surgical instruments.# Chlorine and Na.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Bacillus stearothermophilus Steam sterilization is widely used as a terminal sterilization process for pharmaceutical drug products in glass ampoules, vials, syringes, and plastic containers. It is also used for sterilizing closures, filters, manufacturing equipment, cleaning equipment, and so forth. Biological indicators. Biological indicators are \"standardized\" preparations of certain microorganisms with known characteristics (a defined population, purity and resistance). The microorganisms used to prepare biological indicators are those capable of forming endospores and the microorganism is used in the \"spore state\". The principal is that if these spores are destroyed it can be assumed that any contaminating microorganism in the sterilisation load would also have been killed. Different biological indicators are used for different sterilization processes. Biological indicators are designed for use with: Ethylene oxide gas. Hydrogen peroxide vapour (plasma). Dry heat sterilization (oven). Steam sterilization (autoclave). Radiation. The microorganism used will vary depending upon the means of sterilization which requires testing. Microorganisms are selected depending upon how resistant they are to the chosen method of sterilization. Different microorganisms are more resistant than others to different types of sterilization. With steam sterilization, for example, spore- bearing microorganisms are more resistant than non-spore bearing microorganisms. A microorganism like Staphylococcus (commonly carried on human skin) would have a typical D-value at 121oC for a 15- minute autoclave cycle of only 15 seconds, whereas an endospore forming thermophilic Bacillus would have one of at least 1. 5 minutes. For steam sterilization, Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerly described as Bacillus stearothermophilus) is most commonly used. This microorganism is used due to its theoretical resistance to particular types of sterilization, including heat and it is nonpathogenic. The most commonly used biological indicator in healthcare today contains endospores of Geobacillus stearothermophilus formerly called Bacillus stearothermophilus. The Geobacillus stearothermophilus bacterium is a nonpathogenic spore former that is able to with stand the high temperatures of steam sterilization when in its spore form. When compared to pathogenic species. G stearothermophilus survives much longer. This same organism is also used to monitor gas plasma sterilization, ozone sterilization and liquid sterilisation with peracetic acid because G. stearothermophilus is highly resistant to these sterilisation methods as well. The second organism used in healthcare facilities is Bacillus atrophaeus formerly called Bacillus subtilis var niger. This organism is resistant to ethylene oxide and dry heat sterilisation methods. The efficacy of the process has been established by demonstrating a sterility assurance level of at least 10'6 with Bacillus stearothermophilus. Both, the Bacillus stearothermophilus and B. subtilis provides high degree of resistance to any sterilisation process. Earlier there were discussions whether to use B. subtilis or B. stearothermophilus for plasma sterilization. This is no lower a topic of discussion because in February of 1999 a self-contained biological indicator using 10-6. Bacillus stearothermophilus became available internationally for the routine monitoring of plasma sterilization Steam cycles >Spores of geobacillus stearothermophilus.
