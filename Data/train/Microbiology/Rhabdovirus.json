Persons allergic to eggs, should not be given this vaccine.Rabies Vaccineo Rabies vaccines are fluid or dried prepration of fixed virus grown in the neural tissues of rabbits, sheep, goats, mice or rats or in embryonated ducks egg or in ceil cultures,o Inactivation of virus is commonly done by treatment with formalin or p. Propiolactone (B.P.L.)o Antirabies vaccine fall into two main caiegries.Antirabies Vaccines1. Neural Vaccines2. Non-Neural Vaccinesa) Derived from adult sheep brain (Semple vaccine)b) Suckling (Infant) mouse brain VaccineDuck Embryo VaccineSubunit Vaccine (Still in experimental stage)Cell culture1. Human diploid cell (HDC) vaccine2. Second generation tissue culture vaccineo Neural Vaccines especially (Semple Vaccine) can cause neurological complications.o Duck embryo Vaccine has less neuroparalytic complications, but can cause allergic reactions. Persons allergic to eggs, should not be given this vaccine.o Cell culture vaccines are more potent, safer with fewer side effects and requre fewer injection than other vaccines,o Because of their potency and low cost 'Second generation tissue culture vaccines are preferred. 'o Influenza and yellow fever vaccines are also avoided in egg allergic persons.",
