        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., TSST Superantigens Ceain species of infectious microorganisms produce powerful, immunostimulatory and disease causing toxins called superantigen, so called because of their ability to polyclonally active large fraction ( up to 20% ) of T cell population. Superantigens are potent activators of T-lymphocytes. Superantigens stimulate very large numbers of T cells, without relation to their epitope specificity. This leads to an excessive and dysregulated immune response with release of cytokines IL - 1, IL - 2, TNF - a and IF - y. Conventional antigens bind to MHC class I or II molecules in the groove of the cc 13 dimer (T cell receptor). In contrast, superantigen bind directly to the lateral poion of TCR 13 chain and MHC class II 13 chain, and stimulate T cells solely on 7 13 gene segment utilized independent of the D, J and y a - sequences present - Tf3 restricted T cell mitogens. Superantigens are capable of activating up to 20% of the peripheral T-cell pool, where as conventional antigens activate < I in 10, 000.

The patient has poor peripheral venous access, and a catheter is placed in the right subclan vein. The patient subsequently develops right arm discomfo and swelling and a temperature of 40. 1 degrees C with chills. Multiple blood cultures are taken, and gram-positive cocci are isolated. The organism is catalase positive and grows on mannitol salt agar, but does not turn the agar yellow; the colonies are gamma-hemolytic on a sheep blood agar plate. Which of the following organisms is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",
        "exp": "The patient has developed bacteremia; the description of the causative agent is consistent with a staphylococcal organism (catalase positive, gram-positive cocci that grow on mannitol salt agar). The organism is most likely S. epidermidis as it was not able to ferment mannitol, and was not hemolytic. Both of those characteristics tend to rule out S. aureus. Two other tests that are commonly used are coagulase production and excretion of DNAse from colonies. S. aureus is positive in both tests, S. epidermidis is negative. Enterococcus faecalis might grow on the mannitol salt agar as it is relatively haloduric but these organisms are catalase negative. The enterococci are extremely variable in hemolytic ability so this characteristic is not useful in species identification. Streptococcus agalactiae is catalase negative and beta-hemolytic on sheep blood agar plates. Also, neither would grow on the mannitol salt agar. S. pyogenes is sensitive to growth inhibition by bacitracin while S. agalactiae (group B streptococci) is not. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013). Chapter 13. The Staphylococci. In G. F.

Most strains are motile with peritrichous flagella; colonies often swarm on agar plates, but some strains are nonflagellated and nonmotile. The presence of C tetani should be suspected on isolation of a swarming rod that produces indole and has terminal spherical spores, but does not produce acid from glucose. Toxigenic C tetani contains a plasmid that produces a toxin called tetanospasmin, but nontoxigenic strains also exist. Tetanospasmin is responsible for the infamous toxemia called tetanus.

        "exp": "Myeloma cells with mutation in salvage pathway grows well in HAT medium Hvbridomas Hybridomas are cells that have been engineered to produce a specific antibody in huge numbers To achieve this, qualities, of two types of cells have to be combined together i. e. i) Cells which can produce large amount of pure antibody. and ii) Cells which have the ability to grow continually. These two types of cells are then fused together to form hybridoma Procedure The pure antibody secreting cells are produced by injecting specific antigen in a mouse and obtaining the antigen specific plasma cells (antibody producing cell) from the mouse's spleen. Cell which can grow indefinitely in culture are myeloma cells (cancerous cells). These two cell lines are fused together. The hybrid cell which is thus produced can be cloned to produce large number of identical daughter clones. These daughter clone cells then produce antibodies. Since these antibodies come from only one type of cell (hybridoma cell) they are called monoclonal antibodies. HAT (hypoxanthine, Aminopterin and thymidine) medium is used for preparation of monoclonal antibodies because it allows only fused hybridonza cells to grow. It does not allow the unfused myeloma and! infused antibody cells to grow. So HAT medium is a selective medium which allows (which allow selective growth of fused hybridoma) How does this happen? Before we move on with the discussion, remember these few points about purine synthesis. Purine synthesis is essential for the survival of cells. Purine can be synthesized in two way i. e. - De novo synthesis (dihydrofolate reductase enzyme is required for this pathway)- - Salvage pathway (an enzyme hypoxanthine - guanine phosphoribosyl transferase is required for salvage pathways) Myeloma cells lack HGPase enzyme therefore they cannot synthesize purine by salvage pathways. Antibody cells have HGPase enzyme so they can use the salvage pathways. Aminopterin inhibits dihydrofolate reductase an enzyme used in denovo synthesis of purine When two cell lines i. e. antibody producing cell and myeloma cells are grown in HAT medium only the fused hybridoma cells survive. -Myeloma cells die because they lack the enzyme HGPase so they cannot use the salvage pathways for purine synthesis. They also cannot use de-novo pathway, because Aminopterin present in the HAT medium inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (an enzyme essential, for denovo synthesis of purine). The unfused antibody producing cells die as they cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span. Only fused hybridoma cells grow indefinitely because the antibody cell paner supplies HGPase and the myeloma paner gives it immoality. (as it is a cancer cell)",

Autoimmune diseases are syndromes caused by the activation of T or B cells or both, with no evidence of other causes such as infections or malignancies. Intense stimulation of T lymphocytes can produce nonspecific signals that bypass the need for antigen-specific helper T cells and lead to polyclonal Bcell activation with the formation of multiple autoantibodies..

When listed numerically, the figure expressing the disinfecting power of a substance by relating it to the disinfecting power of phenol may be a function of the standardized test performed. To calculate phenol coefficient, the concentration of the test compound at which the compound kills the test organism in 10 minutes, but not in 5 minutes, is divided by the concentration of phenol that kills the organism under the same conditions. The phenol coefficient may be determined in the presence of a standard amount of added organic matter or in the absence of organic matter and the formula is given by N=1/ CT where C is the conc. of agent applied and T is the time for which agent is applied and N is the number of survivors so N is inversely propoional to dose (CT is collectively called dose)",

The infecting organism is definitively diagnosed and is known to exist in distinct extracellular and intracellular forms. Which of the following is the most likely pathogen?",
        "exp": "This patient has lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (type L1, 2, or 3). Chlamydia exhibit distinct infectious and reproductive forms. The extracellular infectious form is known as the elementary body (EB), which is incapable of reproduction. It attaches to the host cell and enters through endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the EB is transformed into the reticulate body (RB) within the endosome. The RB is capable of binary fission and divides within the endosome; fusion with other endosomes occurs to form a single large inclusion. Eventually, the RBs undergo DNA condensation and disulfide bond bridgings of the major outer membrane protein, forming EBs. The EBs are then released. Note that C. trachomatis is responsible for several sexually or perinatally transmitted diseases, including ocular trachoma (types A, B, and C), neonatal conjunctivitis, nongonococcal urethritis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (types D-K). Calymmatobacterium granulomatis is a gram-negative rod that causes superficially ulcerated genital or inguinal papules that coalesce to form substantial lesions. The appearance of Donovan bodies in histiocytes is diagnostic of this infection. Haemophilus ducreyi is a gram-negative rod that causes a soft, painful penile chancre, unlike that of a chlamydial or syphilitic lesion. This infection is common in the tropics. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative diplococcus responsible for gonorrhea. Patients typically present with purulent penile discharge, not genital lesions. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Pa IX.

The tick itself is a reservoir, however, since it acquires the disease through transovarial passage of the organism. Together, these factors make Lyme disease an endemic infection with little hope for eradication. Borrelia burgdorferi is not resistant to antibiotics and disinfectants. The spirochete can be successfully treated with penicillins, tetracycline, and ceftriaxone. Borrelia burgdorferi is a delicate spirochete and is not resistant to environmental stresses.

In the carbolfuchsin (Ziehl-Neelsen) procedure, acid-fast organisms appear red against a blue background, while in the fluorochrome procedures (auramine-O, auramine-rhodamine), the acid-fast organisms appear as fluorescent rods, yellow to orange (the colour may vary with the filter system used) against a paler yellow or orange background.

The polysaccharide is referred to as the group polysaccharide and is identified as number of different groups labelled by capital letters. Initially the lancefield classification was limited only to pyogenes streptococci, subsequently serological grouping has been applied also to viridans streptococci and to enterococci and the number of serological groups has been extended to a total of 21 (A-H) and (k-w). Historically the lancefield antigens have been used as a major way of differentiating the many streptococci. However there are so many different streptococci that we now rely less on the lancefield antigens and more on a combination of tests such as the patterns of hernolysis, biochemical reactions, growth characteristics and genetic studies along with lancefield antigens.",

        "question": "Regarding clostridium perfringens gas gangrene false is?",
        "exp": "Most common toxin is hyaluronidase Clostridium are gram positive spore forming rods. - The spores enable these organisms to survive in adverse conditions e. g. in soil and dust and on skin. - Most species are obligate anaerobes i. e. their spores do not germinate and growth does not normally proceed unless a suitably low redox potential (Eb) exists. Clostridium perfringens Clostridium perfringens cause two impoant diseases:? Gas gangrene \"Clostridium perfringens is the commonest cause of gas gangrene\". The disease is characterized by rapidly spreading edema, myositis and necrosis of tissues, gas production and profound toxemia. Clostridium perfringens produces several toxins and other substance which have a role in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. \"a Toxin a phospholipase lecithinase\" is generally considered to he the most impoant toxin in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. -It is produced by all types of clostridium perfringens and most abundantly by type \"A\" strains. - It is the most impoant toxin biologically and is responsible. for profound toxemia of the gas gangrene. - It is a \"phospholipase\". Other factors which also have a role in virulence:- Hyaluronida. ve It breaks down intercellular cement substance and promotes the spread of the infection along the tissue planes Collagenases and other proteinases They break down tissues and viually liquefy muscles. Clostridium food poisoning:- Clostridium perfringens is an impoant cause of food poisoning. The. food poisoning is caused due to ingestion of spores. The spores of the clostridium perfringens strains that cause food poisoning are heat resistant. -The unique feature of spores produced by food poisoning strains of clostridium perfringens is that they are heat resistant that can survive boiling for several hours. Remember - Only those strains of clostridia which are associated with food poisoning produce heat resistant spores Where as - The classic strains of this species do not have heat resistant spores. These spores are inactivated within few minutes by boiling. Typical, food poisoning strains of clostridium perfringens occur as carrier state. These strains also occur in animals thus meat is often contaminated with heat resistant spores. The vehicle of infection is usually a precooked meat food that has been allowed to stand at a temperature. The heat resistance of the spores ensures their survival in cooking. - During the cooling period they germinate in the anaerobic environment produced by the cooked meat and multiply. - Anyone who eats this meat will consume the equivalent of cooked meat broth culture of the organisms. - Large numbers of clostridia are thus consumed which may pass unharmed by the gastric acid due to high protein in the meat and reach the intestines where they produce the enterotoxin. - After an incubation period of 8-24 hours abdominal pain diarrhoea set in. Naegeler reaction ft is used to detect alpha toxin which is a phospholipase (lecithinase C) - Lecithinase or phospholipase in the presence of Ca++ and Mg' ions splits lecithin into phosphorylcholine and diacylglycerol. This reaction is seen as an \"opalescence\" in serum or egg yolk media. Procedure CI perfringens is grown on a plate where one half of the plate is covered with alpha antitoxin. The half poion of the plate without the antitoxin produces opalescene. - Pho. spholipase or a toxin splits the lecithin into phosphorylcholine and diacyl glycerol. Which is seen as opalescnee. The other half of the plate where alpha antitoxin is present does not demonstrate opalescence because here alpha toxin or phospholipase is neutralized by the toxin.",

To maintain its complex enzootic cycle, B. burgdorferi must adapt to two markedly different environments: the tick and the mammalian host. Epidemiologic studies of patients with EM implicated ceain Ixodes ticks as vectors of the disease. Ticks of the I. ricinus complex have larval, nymphal, and adult stages. They require a blood meal at each stage. The risk of infection in a given area depends largely on the density of these ticks as well as their feeding habits and animal hosts, which have evolved differently in different locations. Note - Spirochetes are transmitted in tick-mouse-deer cycle. Ticks must feed on humans in the woods, which is their habitat. Adult and nymph stages can infect humans. Ticks feed on mice and then deer. No deer, no disease. Erythema migrans and febrile aches mark acute disease. A macule or papule appears at the site of the bite and expands to become an annular lesion with a raised, red border and central clearing forming a bull's-eye pattern. As the bull's-eye ring expands, the lesion is known as erythema migrans. Ref: Steere A. C. (2012). Chapter 173. Lyme Borreliosis. In D. L. Longo, A. S. Fauci, D. L. Kasper, S. L. Hauser, J. L.

A: Slide flocculation test The VDRL test for syphilis is an example of slide flocculation Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test/ VDRL It is a blood test for syphilis and was developed by the former Venereal Disease Research Laboratory, now the Treponemal Pathogenesis and Immunology Branch, of the United States Public Health Service. Its first iteration being that developed by August Paul von Wasserman with the aid of Albe Neisser in 1906. The RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) test uses the same antigen as the VDRL, but in that test it has been bound to several other molecules including a carbon paicle to allow visualization of the flocculation reaction without the need of a microscope. The (VDRL) is a nontreponemal serological screening for syphilis that is also used to assess response to therapy, to detect CNS involvement, and as an aid in the diagnosis of congenital syphilis. The basis of the test is that an antibody produced by a patient with syphilis reacts with an extract of ox hea (diphosphatidyl glycerol). It therefore detects anti-cardiolipin antibodies (IgG, IgM or IgA), visualized through foaming of the test tube fluid, or \"flocculation\". Many other medical conditions can produce false positive results, including some viruses (mononucleosis, hepatitis), drugs, pregnancy, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid ahritis, lupus, and leprosy. The syphilis anti-cardiolipin antibodies are beta-2 glycoprotein independent, where as those that occur in the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (associated to lupus for example) are beta-2 glycoprotein dependent, and this can be used to tell them apa in an ELISA assay. This test is very useful as the trend of titres are correlated to disease activity (i. e. falling titres indicate successful treatment). It has a very good sensitivity for syphilis, except in late teiary form There are a number of treponemal-specific tests such as the Fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTAABS) test, Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assays (TPHA and MHA-TP), Treponema pallidum paicle agglutination assay (TP-PA), and the Toluidine red unheated serum test (TRUST) which may be used to confirm a positive VDRL result. These tests are more specific for syphilis than non-treponemal tests and, in the presence of a positive test, more likely indicate active infection. Other treponemal infections such as yaws, bejel and pinta and possibly nonpathogenic commensal treponemes can result in a positive. All treponemal specific tests will remain positive for life once a person has been infected with syphilis, even if syphilis has been adequately treated. Therefore, these types of tests cannot be used to monitor the treatment of syphilis.",

Clinical disease results only when trophozoites burrow into mucosa causing ulcer and submucosal abscesses resembling lesion of amoebiasis so it 'resembles amoebiasis' causing diarrhoea or frank dysentery, so stool may contains pus cells. Treatment: Tetracyline/metronidazole/nitroimidazole b. Giardia lamblia Intestinal flagellate, the only protozoan parasite found in the lumen of human small intestine (Duodenum and upper jejunum). Infection is acquired by ingestion of cysts in contaminated food and water. It does not invade tissue (so no RBC and pus cells in faeces) but remains attached to epithelial surface by sucking disc which may cause abnormalities of villous architecture and loss of brush border enzymic activities leading to self limited mucus diarrhoea; malabsorption like syndrome; weight loss; abdominal cramps.

Its virion contains four capsid polypeptides, designated VP1 to VP4.

Hepatitis A has an incubation period of approximately 4 weeks. Its replication is limited to the liver, but the virus is present in the liver, bile, stools, and blood during the late incubation period and acute preicteric phase of illness.

Vi antigen The Vi antigen occurs in only three Salmonella serovars (out of about 2, 200): Typhi, Paratyphi C, and Dublin. Strains of these three serovars may or may not have the Vi antigen. Flagellar (H) Antigens Flagellar antigens are heat-labile proteins. Strongly immunogenic; induces antibody formation rapidly and in high titres following infection or immunization Mixing salmonella cells with flagella-specific antisera gives a characteristic pattern of agglutination (bacteria are loosely attached to each other by their flagella and can be dissociated by shaking). Also, antiflagellar antibodies can immobilize bacteria with corresponding H antigens. A few Salmonella enterica serovars (e. g., Enteritidis, Typhi) produce flagella which always have the same antigenic specificity. Such an H antigen is then called monophasic.

        "question": "Which of the following infestations lead to malabsorption: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Giardia lamblia The stool in giardial infestation is voluminous, foul smelling and contains large amount of mucus and fat but no blood. This is due to malabsorption since the parasites are coated on the mucosa, thus absorption suffers Giardia lamblia/Giardia intestinalis/Lamblia intestinalis/Giardia duodenalis) It is a flagellated protozoan parasite that colonizes and reproduces in the small intestine, causing giardiasis. The giardia parasite attaches to the epithelium by a ventral adhesive disc, and reproduces binary fission. Giardiasis does not spread the bloodstream, nor does it spread to other pas of the gastro-intestinal tract, but remains confined to the lumen of the small intestine. Giardia trophozoites absorb their nutrients from the lumen of the small intestine, and are anaerobes. If the organism is split and stained, it has a very characteristic pattern that resembles a familiar \"smilev face\" symbol. Chief pathways of human infection include - Ingestion of untreated sewage - Contamination of natural waters also occurs in watersheds where intensive grazing occurs The life cycle begins with a noninfective cyst being excreted with the feces of an infected individual. The cyst is hardy, providing protection from various degrees of heat and cold, desiccation, and infection from other organisms. A distinguishing characteristic of the cyst is four nuclei and a retracted cytoplasm. Once ingested by a host, the trophozoite emerges to an active state of feeding and motility. After the feeding stage, the trophozoite undergoes asexual replication through longitudinal binary fission. The resulting trophozoites and cysts then pass through the digestive system in the faeces. While the trophozoites may be found in the faeces, only the cysts are capable of surviving outside of the host. Distinguishing features of the trophozoites are large karyosomes and lack of peripheral chromatin, giving the two nuclei a halo appearance. Cysts are distinguished by a retracted cytoplasm. This protozoan lacks mitochondria. Colonization of the gut results in inflammation and villous atrophy, reducing the gut's absorptive capability. Symptoms of infection include (in order of frequency) diarrhea, malaise, excessive gas (often flatulence or a foul or sulphuric-tasting belch, which has been known to be so nauseating in taste that it can cause the infected person to vomit), steatorrhoea (pale, foul smelling, greasy stools), epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, diminished interest in food, possible (but rare) vomiting which is often violent, and weight loss. Pus, mucus and blood are occasionally present in the stool. It usually causes \"explosive diarrhea\" and while unpleasant, is not fatal. People with recurring Giardia infections, paicularly those with a lack, of the Immunoglobulin A antibody, may develop chronic disease. It is a cause of vitamin B12 deficiency, this a result of the problems caused within the intestinal absorption system",

The D gene and J gene recombination event occurs first, followed by V recombination with the D-J region.

This is the second event that occurs in the B-cell maturational sequence. Light chain rearrangement occurs when recombination events occur with the V gene and J gene from the light chain germline. After this recombination has occurred, and the messenger RNA for this germ line has produced the light chain protein, the light chains and heavy chains form.

Most of the serological tests used in the diagnosis of syphilis cannot accurately diagnosis neurosyphilis. Hence, the diagnosis of neurosyphilis usually depends on combination of clinical features plus C. S. F. finding and serological tests. C. S. F. findings in syphilis:? - Lymphocytic pleocytosis - Protein is moderately elevated - Glucose is usually normal Among the serological tests - \"The VDRL C. S. F. test is the standard serological test for and is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis\". - Since invasion of C. S. F. by syphilis stimulates production of antilipoidal antibodies in C. S. F., VDRL test can be performed on C. S. F. to diagnose neurosyphilis. - The VDRL test is highly specific albeit insensitive for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. - The sensitivity of VDRL for neurosyphilis is 30% and specificity is 90%. Specific treponemol tests have proved to be quite inaccurate in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis Why??? - The antibodies against the specific treponemal antigen have the tendency to cross C. S. F., so enough antibodies may be present in the C. S. F. even before neurosyphilis develops. - Therefore specific treponemal tests have no specificity for neurosyphilis. The C. S. F. becomes positive for these tests even when neurosyphilis is not present. Moreover, Specific treponemal tests cannot be used to monitor treatment because? - These tests become positive soon after infection and typically remain positive. for life despite adequate treatment. An impoant point - Like VDRL test RPR test can also be used to monitor the treatment in syphilis but it is not suitable for testing C. S. F., so it cannot be used in neurosyphilis.

It is a halophilic bacterium that causes acute gastroenteritis following ingestion of contaminated seafood such as raw fish or shellfish. After an incubation period of 12-24 hours, nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, and watery to bloody diarrhea occurs. Fecal leukocytes are often observed. The enteritis tends to subside spontaneously in 1-4 days with no treatment other than restoration of water and electrolyte balance. No enterotoxin has yet been isolated from this bacterium. Vibrio parahemolyticus when grown on TCBS agar produce blue green colonies. Negative string test and absent sucrose fermentation help to differentiate V parahemolyticus from V. cholera.

Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to all cephalosporins and also show high level of resistance to aminoglycosides.

        "exp": "The patient in this question has pneumococcal pneumonia, which must be considered in any patient with chills, fever, chest pain, and cough productive of purulent, rust-colored sputum. Streptococcus pneumoniae is an alpha;-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus that grows in chains. It can be easily distinguished from other alpha;-hemolytic streptococci because it is exquisitely sensitive to bile and bile like compounds, such as optochin. It is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and the most common cause of community-acquired meningitis in adults older than 30. The only recognized virulence factor of S. pneumoniae is its carbohydrate capsule (which contains acidic polysaccharides). Antibody to a specific capsule type is necessary to overcome infection. More than 80 capsule types have been recognized. The 23 types that most commonly cause disease are contained in a vaccine that is recommended for high-risk groups, including the elderly and those undergoing splenectomy. Increased susceptibility is also found in patients with Hodgkin disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and myeloma. The vaccine should still be given to patients with these conditions, but it is less successful. The alternative complement pathway is impoant in clearing Neisseria infections. Individuals with deficiencies in C5 through C8 are at increased risk of disease from Neisseria. The fimbria of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A alpha;-hemolytic streptococcus) is composed of an a-helically coiled M protein. Antibody against a specific M type will prevent infection. However, raising antibodies to M proteins can lead to rheumatic fever, so Strep throat infections are routinely treated with penicillin to prevent an antibody response. The C carbohydrate is an antigen of alpha;-hemolytic streptococci used to divide them into different groups. Antibody against C carbohydrate is not protective. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013). Chapter 14.

Anthrax is a disease that occur in herbivores sheep, cattle, etc. Human cases in countries are commonly found in agricultural workers, and those involved in leather and hair processing. Bacillus anthracis is a gram positive, aerobic, non-motile, capsulated spore forming bacilli. Chain of bacilli present as bamboo stick or have a box car like appearance. It produces a heat stable spore under unourable conditions. The vegetative cell produces a polypeptide capsule and exotoxin, both responsible for its high virulence. When blood film containing anthrax bacilli is stained with polychrome methylene blue and then examined under microscope, amorphous purplish material representing capsular material is noticed. This is called Mc Fadyean's reaction (characteristic of anthrax bacilli). Ref: Clinical Bacteriology By J. Keith, Robe G.

Up to two-thirds of bacteremic community-acquired pneumonias are due to this organism. 5-25% of healthy individuals carry S. pneumoniae in their pharynx. The classic description of S. pneumoniae on Gram's stain is that given in the question stem. S. pneumoniae can be verified by the Quellung reaction, or counter immunoelectrophoresis to determine serotypes of isolated strains or for case detection using sputum specimens (there are more than 80 distinct serotypes based on studies of capsular antigens). Chlamydia pneumoniae is not identified on the basis of Gram's stain, but rather, can be seen with Giemsa or immunofluorescence. Haemophilus influenzae is a gram-negative rod. Staphylococcus aureus is also a gram-positive coccus, but the classic description of this organism typically includes a reference to \"grape-like clusters. \" Also know: In 2000, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was introduced in which polysaccharide was conjugated with protein.

Primary target of VT is vascular endothelial cells. This is the pathogenesis of HUS in which characteristic renal lesions is capillary microangiopathy. Once shiga toxin enters the circulation, it binds to neutrophils and preferentially localizes in the kidney, where it causes damage to the endothelial cells. This results in platelet aggregation, which initiates the microangiopathic process. The typical EHEC is serotype o157: H7. Gastrointestinal symptoms OF HUS include abdominal pain, cramping, and vomiting. Fever is typically absent. Neurologic symptoms are common and may include lethargy, encephalopathy, seizures, and even cerebral infarction. Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia occurs when the anemia is caused due to autoantibodies produced in the body. In H. U. S. the hemolytic anemia is caused by mechanical damage to R. B. C.

        "exp": "The presence of sickle cell disease in a question stem is usually a significant clue. This question tests if you know that patients with sickle cell anemia are more susceptible to osteomyelitis caused by Salmonella. (The patient's fever, bone pain, and x-ray results indicate osteomyelitis). But note that Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive coccus) is the most common cause of osteomyelitis in both sicklers and non sicklers. If it had not been ruled out on bone culture, you should have looked for it in the answer choices. Notice that you were required to know more than just the organism's name; you needed to know its distinguishing features. Salmonella exists in over 1800 serotypes and is known to contaminate poultry. A facultative intracellular parasite is Legionella, a catalase-positive gram-negative rod. It contaminates air-conditioning cooling towers and causes Legionnaire's disease (a type of pneumonia). A non motile, facultative anaerobe is Shigella, a gram-negative rod that does not produce H2S. All Shigella contain an endotoxic lipopolysaccharide. The organism causes bacillary dysentery, with abdominal cramps, fever, and mucoid, bloody diarrhea. A comma-shaped organism that is sensitive to acidic pH is Vibrio cholerae, a gram-negative rod that causes severe enterotoxin-induced diarrhea, with \"rice-water\" stools and dehydration. The toxin acts by stimulating adenylyl cyclase to overproduce c. AMP in the brush border of the small intestine. Ref: Langford C. A. (2012). Chapter 336.

In 1983 Lue montognier and colleagues from pasteur institute, Paris isolated a retro virus from a West African patient with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy and called it lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV). In 1984 Ader Gallo repoed isolation of a retrovirus from AIDS patient and called it human T-cell lymphotrophic virus III.

ABS refers to an absorption step that removes nonspecific anti spirochetal antibodies often found in normal serum. FTA-ABS is the most sensitive test in all stages of syphilis, and is the best confirmatory test for a serum reactive to a screen such as RPR or VDRL. FTA-ABS antibodies rise more quickly in primary syphilis and remain positive in teiary syphilis. In late syphilis, approximately 1/3 of these patients may have a nonreactive VDRL or RPR. Therefore, if there is clinical suspicion of late syphilis and the VDRL or RPR is nonreactive, the FTA-ABS should be performed. This test is both sensitive and specific for syphilis infection. Less than 1% false positives are due to SLE, RA or old-age. All 1+ or minimally reactive results are considered equivocal; in the absence of historical or clinical evidence of treponemal infection, a second specimen should be submitted for serological testing.

The brain infection characteristically has a prominent perivascular character, which causes a multifocal hemorrhagic necrotizing meningoencephalitis.

Systemic antifungal agents (e. g., amphotericin) have some activity against this organism, but most cases are fatal. Entamoeba histolytica causes amoebic dysentery and liver abscess. Giardia lamblia is a flagellate, rather than an amoeba, and causes diarrhea. Naegleria fowleri is an amoebic cause of meningoencephalitis in previously healthy swimmers and divers. Ref: Ray C.

B: Clostedium difficile Pseudomembranous colitis is an acute inflammatory disease of the colon that in mild cases may appear as minimal inflammation or edema of the colonic mucosa. In more severe cases, the mucosa often is covered with loosely adherent nodular or diffuse exudates. These raised exudative plaques are 2-5 mm in size. Coalescence of these plaques generates an endoscopic appearance of yellowish pseudomembranes lining the colonic mucosa, Pseudomembranous colitis usually is associated with antibiotic use, which may alter the balance of normal gut flora and allow overgrowth of ceain organisms. C difficile, a gram-positive, spore-forming, anaerobic bacillus, is isolated in almost all of the cases of Pseudomembranous colitis. Clindamycin, lincomycin, ampicillin, and cephalosporin have been implicated in most of the repoed cases, but any antimicrobial agent (including antifungal, antiviral, and metronidazole) could incite the disease, regardless of the amount administered or the route of administration. Rare cases have been related to Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella species, Clostridium perfringens, Yersinia species, Shigella species, Campylobacter species, cytomegalovirus, Entamoeba histolytica, and Listeria species. Conditions other than antimicrobial administration could predispose to C difficile pseudomembranous colitis. Such conditions include bowel ischemia, recent bowel surgery, uremia, dietary change, change in bowel motility, malnutrition, chemotherapy, shock, and Hirschsprung disease.",

Note that Candida tends to colonize foreign bodies such as IV and Foley catheters, prosthetic valves, and ventricular shunts. Actinomyces israelii is known to cause cervicofacial infections in patients having undergone dental work. Histoplasma capsulatum causes histoplasmosis, a pulmonary infection common in the midwestern river valleys. Multi-organ involvement is usually seen only in the immunocompromised. Transmission of the organism occurs through the inhalation of airborne microconidia (infectious) spores. The organism is found in bird and bat droppings and in the soil. Nocardia asteroides is an actinomycete that causes a chronic lobar pneumonia that may metastasize to the brain. It is more common in the immunocompromised.

Core biopsy of the liver is performed to evaluate the extent of his disease, and demonstrates chronic hepatitis with severe activity and severe fibrosis. The patient is treated with interferon for 6 months, but fails to respond. His condition continues to deteriorate, and he is treated with ohotopic liver transplantation. One year after ohotopic liver transplantation, the man develops rising transaminase and bilirubin levels. In order to minimize chronic rejection injury to hepatic endothelial cells, immunosuppressive therapy should be aimed at downregulating which of the following components of the immune response?",
        "exp": "We are presently undergoing a hidden epidemic of hepatitis C infection in this country. While many individuals may have very slowly progressive courses with good health for decades, some develop cirrhosis relatively earlier in their disease process. These individuals are increasingly becoming candidates for liver transplantation, although the number of available livers is far less than the number of people with end-stage hepatitis C infection who might use one. Hepatitis C can recur in the new liver, but often does not become a serious problem. Instead, chronic rejection turns out to more often limit the longevity of the transplant. Chronic rejection of any solid organ entails cellular injury to endothelial cells, resulting in intimal proliferation, fibrosis, and eventually, ischemic injury to the graft. Immunosuppressive therapy is directed at controlling lymphocyte activity and minimizing cellular rejection. Autoantibodies are not involved in organ transplant rejection. The antibodies produced are alloantibodies directed only to the graft, but not to the host. Complement proteins are involved in the humoral component of acute rejection, and complement binding to alloantibodies increases graft damage. Complement protein production, however, is not affected by immunosuppressive therapy. HLA antigen expression is central to recognition of foreign cells in grafted tissue. HLA antigens are expressed constitutively by all normal cells, and immunosuppression does not affect their production.",

        "question": "A truck driver was involved in a serious accident and received second and third degree burns over his body. He was placed in the burn unit and, on his twelfth day of his admission, developed a wound infection with a bluish-green exudate. Treatment with chloramphenicol and tetracycline was unsuccessful. A gram-negative, motile organism was isolated that was oxidase-positive, did not ferment lactose, sucrose, or glucose, but grew on Mac. Conkey's agar and produced a fruity aroma on that medium. Which of the following organisms was most likely isolated?",
        "exp": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a very common oppounist in burn patients, in whom it classically causes secondary wound infections and septicemia. It may also cause cystitis in patients with urinary catheters and pneumonia in patients with cystic fibrosis. The organism is found in water and usually gains access to the body this source, as a contaminant in the water used in respirators or in water baths, etc. used to cleanse wounds. This organism is a non-fermenter, that is, it does not metabolize sugars by classic pathways. It produces a blue-green, water-soluble pigment (pyocyanin), and has a fruity odor when growing on laboratory media. It has a propensity for developing antibiotic resistance; current therapy employs the synergistic combination of an aminoglycoside, such as amikacin, with a cell wall synthesis inhibitor (carbenicillin, ticarcillin, or piperacillin). Candida albicans is a normal flora yeast that will appear as very large, gram- positive, spherical-to-ovoid organisms with budding daughter cells in Gram-stained preparations. Candidiasis is an oppounistic infection in individuals with a compromised immune system. The fungus usually causes mucocutaneous lesions, but in severely compromised individuals like AIDS patients, systemic disease may occur. Oral candidiasis appears as creamy, white patches of exudate that can be scraped off an inflamed tongue or buccal mucosa. Clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive, spore-forming, anaerobic rod. It is a common cause of gas gangrene when it is introduced into a wound. The organism produces a variety of toxins and enzymes that enable it to destroy muscle tissue and spread through the soft tissues of the body. Escherichia coli is a lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rod commonly seen as normal flora of the intestine of man. It is the most common cause of pyelonephritis, and sepsis in patients with indwelling urinary catheters. It is also the major cause of traveler's diarrhea with watery stools and is a very impoant pathogen in neonates, who become infected during passage through the bih canal. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013).
