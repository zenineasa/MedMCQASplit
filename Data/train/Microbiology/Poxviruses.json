Exmples are variola (smallpox virus), vaccinia, cowpox, monnkeypox, rabbitpox, buffalopox, camelpox, mousepox. ii) Parapoxvirus: Viruses of ungulates that may occasionally infact human, eg. Orf (contagious pustular dermatitis) and paravaccinia (milker's node, bovine pupular stomatitis). iii) Copripoxvirus: Viruses of goat and sheeps, eg. sheep-pox, goatpox, lumpy skin disease. iv) Leporipox virus: Viruses of of leporids (rabbits, hares, squirrels), e. g. myxoma and fibromas. v) Avipoxvirus: Virus of birds, eg. fowlpox, turkeypox, pigeonpox, canarypox. vi) Suipoxvirus: Virus of swine, eg. swinepox.",
