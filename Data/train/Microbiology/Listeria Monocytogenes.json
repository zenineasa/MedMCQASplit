This is because peritrichous flagella are produced by the bacillus optimally at 20-30degC but only scantily or not at all at 37degC. o It grows on oridinary media with in a temprature range of 1deg to 45degC. o Most cases of human disease are caused by serotypes l/2a, l/2b and 4b. o The organism can be found as a part of the gastrointestinal flora in healthy individuals. o Human disease due to L. monocytogenes generally occurs in the setting of pregnancy or immunosuppression. o Culture media used for isolation are blood agar, chocolate agar and PALCAM agar, o Listeria monocytogenes shows '\"subtle' beta hemolysis on blood agar. Because of its motility, when inoculated in a tube (in liquid or semisolid medium), L monocytogenes shows 'Umbrella-shaped' (Umbrella- 'zone') growth. o Listeria monocytogenes is CAMP-positive due to CAMP factor (like Group-B streptococci). When streaked at right angel to streak of staphylococcus aureus, there is increased zone of hemolysis near staphylococcal streak (arrow head).",
