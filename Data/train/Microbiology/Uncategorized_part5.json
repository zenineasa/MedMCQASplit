This is due to malabsorption since the parasites are coated on the mucosa, thus absorption suffers Giardia lamblia/Giardia intestinalis/Lamblia intestinalis/Giardia duodenalis) It is a flagellated protozoan parasite that colonizes and reproduces in the small intestine, causing giardiasis. The giardia parasite attaches to the epithelium by a ventral adhesive disc, and reproduces binary fission. Giardiasis does not spread the bloodstream, nor does it spread to other pas of the gastro-intestinal tract, but remains confined to the lumen of the small intestine. Giardia trophozoites absorb their nutrients from the lumen of the small intestine, and are anaerobes. If the organism is split and stained, it has a very characteristic pattern that resembles a familiar \"smilev face\" symbol. Chief pathways of human infection include - Ingestion of untreated sewage - Contamination of natural waters also occurs in watersheds where intensive grazing occurs The life cycle begins with a noninfective cyst being excreted with the feces of an infected individual. The cyst is hardy, providing protection from various degrees of heat and cold, desiccation, and infection from other organisms. A distinguishing characteristic of the cyst is four nuclei and a retracted cytoplasm. Once ingested by a host, the trophozoite emerges to an active state of feeding and motility. After the feeding stage, the trophozoite undergoes asexual replication through longitudinal binary fission. The resulting trophozoites and cysts then pass through the digestive system in the faeces. While the trophozoites may be found in the faeces, only the cysts are capable of surviving outside of the host. Distinguishing features of the trophozoites are large karyosomes and lack of peripheral chromatin, giving the two nuclei a halo appearance. Cysts are distinguished by a retracted cytoplasm. This protozoan lacks mitochondria. Colonization of the gut results in inflammation and villous atrophy, reducing the gut's absorptive capability. Symptoms of infection include (in order of frequency) diarrhea, malaise, excessive gas (often flatulence or a foul or sulphuric-tasting belch, which has been known to be so nauseating in taste that it can cause the infected person to vomit), steatorrhoea (pale, foul smelling, greasy stools), epigastric pain, bloating, nausea, diminished interest in food, possible (but rare) vomiting which is often violent, and weight loss. Pus, mucus and blood are occasionally present in the stool. It usually causes \"explosive diarrhea\" and while unpleasant, is not fatal. People with recurring Giardia infections, paicularly those with a lack, of the Immunoglobulin A antibody, may develop chronic disease. It is a cause of vitamin B12 deficiency, this a result of the problems caused within the intestinal absorption system",

The D gene and J gene recombination event occurs first, followed by V recombination with the D-J region. The cytoplasmic mu chains are the result of immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement, the production of the messenger RNA from this rearrangement, and the ribosomal synthesis of the protein mu chain. This is the second event that occurs in the B-cell maturational sequence. Light chain rearrangement occurs when recombination events occur with the V gene and J gene from the light chain germline. After this recombination has occurred, and the messenger RNA for this germ line has produced the light chain protein, the light chains and heavy chains form.

Most of the serological tests used in the diagnosis of syphilis cannot accurately diagnosis neurosyphilis. Hence, the diagnosis of neurosyphilis usually depends on combination of clinical features plus C. S. F. finding and serological tests. C. S. F. findings in syphilis:? - Lymphocytic pleocytosis - Protein is moderately elevated - Glucose is usually normal Among the serological tests - \"The VDRL C. S. F. test is the standard serological test for and is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis\". - Since invasion of C. S. F. by syphilis stimulates production of antilipoidal antibodies in C. S. F., VDRL test can be performed on C. S. F. to diagnose neurosyphilis. - The VDRL test is highly specific albeit insensitive for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. - The sensitivity of VDRL for neurosyphilis is 30% and specificity is 90%. Specific treponemol tests have proved to be quite inaccurate in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis Why??? - The antibodies against the specific treponemal antigen have the tendency to cross C. S. F., so enough antibodies may be present in the C. S. F. even before neurosyphilis develops. - Therefore specific treponemal tests have no specificity for neurosyphilis. The C. S. F. becomes positive for these tests even when neurosyphilis is not present. Moreover, Specific treponemal tests cannot be used to monitor treatment because? - These tests become positive soon after infection and typically remain positive. for life despite adequate treatment. An impoant point - Like VDRL test RPR test can also be used to monitor the treatment in syphilis but it is not suitable for testing C. S. F., so it cannot be used in neurosyphilis.

Ab) indicates the presence of the early stages of an acute infection with Hepatitis B. The presence of antibody to Hepatitis C (HCV) only indicates exposure, but not a specific time of exposure; however, 85% of patients who are infected with HCV develop chronic infections, indicating that this patient has an 85% chance of having a dual infection with HBV and HCV. The acute or chronic HCV infection can be confirmed by PCR. A dual infection of HBV and HAV is not plausible since the IgM anti-HAV serology is negative. Hepatitis A does not cause chronic disease. Chronic HBV infection is unlikely because the patient has HBc IgM Ab, which is characteristic of an acute infection, rather than a chronic infection. Ref: Ray C. G., Ryan K. J. (2010). Chapter 13.

        "exp": "The patient in this question has pneumococcal pneumonia, which must be considered in any patient with chills, fever, chest pain, and cough productive of purulent, rust-colored sputum. Streptococcus pneumoniae is an alpha;-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus that grows in chains. It can be easily distinguished from other alpha;-hemolytic streptococci because it is exquisitely sensitive to bile and bile like compounds, such as optochin. It is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and the most common cause of community-acquired meningitis in adults older than 30. The only recognized virulence factor of S. pneumoniae is its carbohydrate capsule (which contains acidic polysaccharides). Antibody to a specific capsule type is necessary to overcome infection. More than 80 capsule types have been recognized. The 23 types that most commonly cause disease are contained in a vaccine that is recommended for high-risk groups, including the elderly and those undergoing splenectomy. Increased susceptibility is also found in patients with Hodgkin disease, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and myeloma. The vaccine should still be given to patients with these conditions, but it is less successful. The alternative complement pathway is impoant in clearing Neisseria infections. Individuals with deficiencies in C5 through C8 are at increased risk of disease from Neisseria. The fimbria of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A alpha;-hemolytic streptococcus) is composed of an a-helically coiled M protein. Antibody against a specific M type will prevent infection. However, raising antibodies to M proteins can lead to rheumatic fever, so Strep throat infections are routinely treated with penicillin to prevent an antibody response. The C carbohydrate is an antigen of alpha;-hemolytic streptococci used to divide them into different groups. Antibody against C carbohydrate is not protective. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013). Chapter 14.

This organism is fastidious and difficult to culture in the laboratory, however serodiagnosis can be most helpful. Patients typically produce one or two heterophile antibodies during the course of the infection; one agglutinates human O+ RBCs in the cold (the cold hemagglutinin) while the other causes the agglutination of a strain of Streptococcus salivarius termed strain MG (the Strep MG agglutinins). Klebsiella pneumoniae is readily cultured on routine laboratory media and characteristically produces pneumonia with blood clots in the sputum (red currant jelly sputum), which may be indicative of pulmonary abscess development. Parainfluenza viruses cause croup, which is characterized by a dry, \"barking\" cough. It is more of a tracheitis, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis than a pneumonitis. No heterophile antibodies are produced in these patients. Respiratory syncytial virus causes an atypical pneumonitis in infants. It is usually diagnosed by the observation of syncytial masses in respiratory secretions. Cold hemagglutinins and Strep MG agglutinins are absent. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 23. Mycoplasmas.

        "exp": "The presence of sickle cell disease in a question stem is usually a significant clue. This question tests if you know that patients with sickle cell anemia are more susceptible to osteomyelitis caused by Salmonella. (The patient's fever, bone pain, and x-ray results indicate osteomyelitis). But note that Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive coccus) is the most common cause of osteomyelitis in both sicklers and non sicklers. If it had not been ruled out on bone culture, you should have looked for it in the answer choices. Notice that you were required to know more than just the organism's name; you needed to know its distinguishing features. Salmonella exists in over 1800 serotypes and is known to contaminate poultry. A facultative intracellular parasite is Legionella, a catalase-positive gram-negative rod. It contaminates air-conditioning cooling towers and causes Legionnaire's disease (a type of pneumonia). A non motile, facultative anaerobe is Shigella, a gram-negative rod that does not produce H2S. All Shigella contain an endotoxic lipopolysaccharide. The organism causes bacillary dysentery, with abdominal cramps, fever, and mucoid, bloody diarrhea. A comma-shaped organism that is sensitive to acidic pH is Vibrio cholerae, a gram-negative rod that causes severe enterotoxin-induced diarrhea, with \"rice-water\" stools and dehydration. The toxin acts by stimulating adenylyl cyclase to overproduce c. AMP in the brush border of the small intestine. Ref: Langford C. A. (2012). Chapter 336.

ABS refers to an absorption step that removes nonspecific anti spirochetal antibodies often found in normal serum. FTA-ABS is the most sensitive test in all stages of syphilis, and is the best confirmatory test for a serum reactive to a screen such as RPR or VDRL. FTA-ABS antibodies rise more quickly in primary syphilis and remain positive in teiary syphilis. In late syphilis, approximately 1/3 of these patients may have a nonreactive VDRL or RPR. Therefore, if there is clinical suspicion of late syphilis and the VDRL or RPR is nonreactive, the FTA-ABS should be performed. This test is both sensitive and specific for syphilis infection. Less than 1% false positives are due to SLE, RA or old-age. All 1+ or minimally reactive results are considered equivocal; in the absence of historical or clinical evidence of treponemal infection, a second specimen should be submitted for serological testing.

B: Clostedium difficile Pseudomembranous colitis is an acute inflammatory disease of the colon that in mild cases may appear as minimal inflammation or edema of the colonic mucosa. In more severe cases, the mucosa often is covered with loosely adherent nodular or diffuse exudates. These raised exudative plaques are 2-5 mm in size. Coalescence of these plaques generates an endoscopic appearance of yellowish pseudomembranes lining the colonic mucosa, Pseudomembranous colitis usually is associated with antibiotic use, which may alter the balance of normal gut flora and allow overgrowth of ceain organisms. C difficile, a gram-positive, spore-forming, anaerobic bacillus, is isolated in almost all of the cases of Pseudomembranous colitis. Clindamycin, lincomycin, ampicillin, and cephalosporin have been implicated in most of the repoed cases, but any antimicrobial agent (including antifungal, antiviral, and metronidazole) could incite the disease, regardless of the amount administered or the route of administration. Rare cases have been related to Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella species, Clostridium perfringens, Yersinia species, Shigella species, Campylobacter species, cytomegalovirus, Entamoeba histolytica, and Listeria species. Conditions other than antimicrobial administration could predispose to C difficile pseudomembranous colitis. Such conditions include bowel ischemia, recent bowel surgery, uremia, dietary change, change in bowel motility, malnutrition, chemotherapy, shock, and Hirschsprung disease.",

        "exp": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a very common oppounist in burn patients, in whom it classically causes secondary wound infections and septicemia. It may also cause cystitis in patients with urinary catheters and pneumonia in patients with cystic fibrosis. The organism is found in water and usually gains access to the body this source, as a contaminant in the water used in respirators or in water baths, etc. used to cleanse wounds. This organism is a non-fermenter, that is, it does not metabolize sugars by classic pathways. It produces a blue-green, water-soluble pigment (pyocyanin), and has a fruity odor when growing on laboratory media. It has a propensity for developing antibiotic resistance; current therapy employs the synergistic combination of an aminoglycoside, such as amikacin, with a cell wall synthesis inhibitor (carbenicillin, ticarcillin, or piperacillin). Candida albicans is a normal flora yeast that will appear as very large, gram- positive, spherical-to-ovoid organisms with budding daughter cells in Gram-stained preparations. Candidiasis is an oppounistic infection in individuals with a compromised immune system. The fungus usually causes mucocutaneous lesions, but in severely compromised individuals like AIDS patients, systemic disease may occur. Oral candidiasis appears as creamy, white patches of exudate that can be scraped off an inflamed tongue or buccal mucosa. Clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive, spore-forming, anaerobic rod. It is a common cause of gas gangrene when it is introduced into a wound. The organism produces a variety of toxins and enzymes that enable it to destroy muscle tissue and spread through the soft tissues of the body. Escherichia coli is a lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rod commonly seen as normal flora of the intestine of man. It is the most common cause of pyelonephritis, and sepsis in patients with indwelling urinary catheters. It is also the major cause of traveler's diarrhea with watery stools and is a very impoant pathogen in neonates, who become infected during passage through the bih canal. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013).

Monospot test for heterophile antibodies is more sensitive than the classical heterophile test. 2. EBV specific antibody test Used in patients who lack heterophile antibodies (children < 5 years) and for patients with atypical presentation. anti-viral capsid antigen (anti-VCA) -> most common anti-EBV nuclear antigen (anti-EBNA) anti - early antigen (anti - EA)",

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) account for ~34% of nosocomial infections. Pneumonia accounts for ~13% of nosocomial infections. Wound infections account for ~17% of nosocomial infections UTI is the most common cause of nosocomial infection. Other common cause is pneumonia and surgical procedures. Contaminated surgical equipments and from health care workers can be the cause of infection in surgical wound. Also Know: The most common pathogens in postoperative wound infections are S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enteric and anaerobic bacteria. In rapidly progressing postoperative infections, which manifest within 24-48 h of a surgical procedure, the level of suspicion regarding group A streptococcal or clostridial infection should be high.

Pseudomonas is also associated with many other clinical syndromes, including infection following traumatic wounds to the feet in persons wearing sneakers or rubber-soled shoes, since the organism can be cultured from the shoes. Must know: Haemophilus influenzae produces a variety of clinical syndromes. H. Influenzae is the third-most common cause of meningitis in children aged 1 month to 18 years. It is the most common cause of acute epiglottitis, the most common cause of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis, and the second-most common cause of otitis media. Patients at risk include those with COPD and cystic fibrosis, alcoholics, splenectomized patients, and young patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a gram-negative organism that produces a necrotizing pneumonia in diabetics and alcoholics. Patients typically present with an abrupt onset of fever, shaking chills, and purulent, foul-smelling sputum. Mucor is a fungal infection that is paicularly severe in the diabetic or the immunocompromised patient. In the acidotic diabetic, the fungus produces a life-threatening, invasive rhinocerebral infection.

However, there is now a trend to replace the CFT with the simple flocculation tests. Although CFT is considered to be a relatively simple test, it is a very exacting procedure because 5 variables are involved. In essence the test consists of two antigen-antibody reactions, one of which is the indicator system. The first reaction, between a known virus antigen and a specific antibody takes place in the presence of a predetermined amount of complement. The complement is removed or \"fixed\" by the antigen-antibody complex. The second antigen-antibody reaction consists of reacting sheep RBC with haemolysin. When this indicator system is added to the reactants, the sensitized RBCs will only lyse in the presence of free complement. The antigens used for CFT tend to be group antigens rather than type-specific antigens. In order for the CFT to be set up correctly, the optimal concentration of haemolytic serum, complement, and antigen should be determined by titration. The Wassermann test is no longer in use.",

        "exp": "Bacillus stearothermophilus Sterilization is generally defined as the process of completely destroying ble microorganisms including structures such as spores. Standandard practice in sterilization process is to include sterility indicator along with the aicles to be sterilized. The use of sterility indicators allows a direct and sensitive approach to test the effectiveness of the sterilization process. Sterility indicators can be biological or chemical. Biological indicators A biological indicator is broadly defined as a characteristic preparation of specific microorganism that provides a defined and stable ressitance to specific sterilization procedures. The biological indicators selected should provide a greater challenge to the sterilization process than the bioburden in or on the product. Microorganisms widely recognized as biological indicators are spore forming bacterias because these organisms are significantly more resistant than the normal. - With the exception of ionizing radiation process, these microorganisms are significantly more resistant than the normal micro flora. A biological indicator can be used to assist in the performance qualification of the sterilization equipment and in the development and establishment of a validated sterilization process for a paicular process. \"Biological indicator used in plasma sterilization is Bacillus stearothermophilus\". Plasma sterilization Plasma is described as the fouh state of matter (It is neither liquid, gas or solid). it is defined as reactive cloud of ionized atoms, electrons and neutral atomic paicles. In order to generate the plasma for sterilization, matter (for example H202) a gaseous state is exposed to strong electrical or magnetic. field. This is performed in a vaccum so that high temperature are not required. In practice, a hydrogen peroxide solution is dispersed in a vaccum chamber creating a plasma cloud. This result in the generation (ionisation) of a cloud of charged paicles and free radicals that interact with vital cell component. The free radicals generated during this process interacts with vital cell component (mainly nucleic acids and destroy them). Sterilization occurs as a result of the dual phase process of the oxidative propeies of the vapour and plasma. Gas plasma is capable of penetrating medical packaging, is safe to use and the sterilization cycles are easy to control and monitor. The temperature attained in these process is not very high so there is no risk of damage of the instruments as in Heat methods. Biological indicators for various sterilization methods B. stearothernzophilus spores are used to monitor -Steam sterilization - Plasma sterilization (hydrogen peroxide) - Liquid peracetic acid sterilizers",

In India, the incidence is very high (21 per million population), because of higher population of measles cases in children, more frequent subclinical measles virus infection, and perhaps, higher population of the total population below 2years of age. The clinical course in SPE is slowly progressive with death occurring within 3 years. Ten percent of cases show either a fulminant or prolonged course of the disease. Diagnosis of SSPE requires the fulfillment of at least three of the following five criteria: A typical progressive subacute mental deterioration with signs of myoclonus. Characteristic EEG changes (high amplitude slow and sharp waves occurring with slow background). Elevated CSF globulin levels greater than 20% of total CSF protein. Raised titres of measles antibodies in blood and CSF and Typical histopathological findings in brain biopsy or autopsy.",

A careful history reveals that the family has two cats in the house. The appropriate laboratory tests indicate the expectant mother is infected with Toxoplasma gondii. Months later, the woman delivers a full term baby with no obvious signs of infection with the protozoan parasite. The best test to diagnose acute infection in the neonate would be a parasite-specific ELISA for which isotype of immunoglobulin?",
        "exp": "IgM immunoglobulin directed against Toxoplasma would provide evidence of infection in the newborn baby. IgM is the only antibody that a baby can form with an acute infection. It is the first antibody that is formed in an infection and it is also the antibody that is present on the surface of immature and mature B cells. IgA is the antibody that is produced in response to mucosal infections. It cannot cross the placenta. The baby's immune system is still not well developed at bih and cannot produce IgA immunoglobulin. In adults or older children, IgA is exists in serum in a monomeric form but is present in seromucous secretions as a dimer. Ig. G1 and Ig. G4 immunoglobulins might be present in the baby, but would not indicate infection in the infant. The presence of these isotypes would indicate that the mother was infected with the organism and produced antibody that was transpoed across the placenta in utero. IgG is the only immunoglobulin that can cross the placenta, providing protection to the baby during the first few months of life. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 52. Blood & Tissue Protozoa. In W.

        "exp": "Sporothrix schenekii Multiple vesicles on hand and multiple eruptions along the lymphatics in a gardner suggest the diagnosis of cutaneous sporotrichosis. Sporotrichosis Sporotrichosis is caused by the thermally dimorphic fungus sporothrix schenckii. Because S. schencki is naturally found in soil, hay, sphagnum moss, and plants, it usually affects farmers, gardeners, and agricultural workers. This fungal disease usually affects the skin although rare forms can affect the lungs, joints, bones, and CNS. Fungus enters through small cuts and abrasions in the skin to cause the infection. Because roses can spread the disease, it is one of a few diseases referred to as rose-thorn or rose gardener's disease. Forms and symptoms of sporotrichosis I) Cutaneous (skin) sporotrichosis - This is the most common form of this disease. Symptoms of this form includes nodular lesions or bumps in the skin, at the point of entry and also along lymph nodes and vessels. - The lesion stas off as small and painless, nodule and ranges in colour from pink to purple. - Left untreated, the lesion becomes larger and look similar to a boil and more lesions will apear, until a chronic ulcer develops. Usually cutaneous sporotrichosis lesions occur in the finger, hand and arm. 2) Pulmonary sporotrichosis - This rare form of the disease occur when S. schenckii spores are inhaled. - Symptoms include productive cough, nodules, cavitations and fibrosis of lungs; and hilar lymph node enlargement. - Patients with this form of sporotrichosis are susceptible to developing tuberculosis and pneumonia. 3) Disseminated sporotrichosis - When the infection spreads from the primary site to secondary sites in the body, the disease develops into a rare and critical form called disseminated sporotrichosis. - The infection can spread to joints and bones (called osteoaicular sporotrichosis) as well as the CNS and brain (sporotrichosis meningitis). About other options Cladosporium Cladosporium genus of fungi includes some of the most common indoor and outdoor molds. Many species of cladosporium are commonly found on living and dead plant material. Some species are plant pathogens, others parasitize other fungi. Cladosporium species are rarely pathogenic to humans, but have been repoed to cause infection of the skin and toenails, as well as sinusitis and pulmonary infections.",

These coated HIV paicles retain the ability to infect CD4+ T cells as they traverse the dendritic cells. B lymphocytes have a surface marker (CD21 protein-a complement receptor) to which an Epstein-Barr envelope glycoprotein can bind.

As it cannot cross the placental barrier its presence in fetus or newborn indicates intrauterine infection.

The time required for sterilization depends upon the volume of medium in the vessel- For small volumes of liquids (100 ml or less), the time required for autoclaving is 15-20min. For large quantities (2-4 liter) 30-40 min is required. 2) Membrane filtration - Constituents like serum, trypsin, growth factors, proteins, amino acids, vitamins, hormones, carbohydrates and plant extracts are thermolabile and may decompose during autoclaving. - These must be sterilized by filtration. The porosity of the filter membrane should be no longer than 0. 2 microns (U m). - Empty glassware that is to hold media must be sterilized in an autoclave before filter sterilization. These two (autoclaving and membrane filtration) are the most commonly used methods for sterilization of culture media. But when these are not available other methods can be used; e. g.- - For media containing sugar or gelatin, an exposure of 100\u00b0C for 20 minutes on three successive days may be used. This is known as Tyndallization. Some media containing serum or egg fluid can be sterilized by heating to 80-85\u00b0C for 2-4 hours.",

B: Immunofluorescence test Diagnosis of cryptosporidium is made by demonstration of oocyst in feces Methods of detection and confirmation of cryptosporodium Wet mount-In bright-field microscopy using differential interference contrast (DIC), oocysts appear as small round structures (4 to 6 im) similar to yeasts. They do not autofluoresce. Modified acid-fast stain-Oocysts (4 to 6 im) often have distinct oocyst walls and stain from light pink to bright red. In paicular, infections that are resolving can have colorless oocyst \"ghosts. \" Mature oocysts may have discernible sporozoites (up to 4). Indirect fluorescent antibody assay-This technique offers the highest combination of sensitivity and specificity and is considered the gold standard. However, it does not provide a stained slide that can be archived. It requires special equipment (fluorescence microscope) and commercially available test kits. Methods for detection (but not confirmation) of Cryptosporidium Oocysts may be detected by the following methods, but should be confirmed by the diagnostic techniques listed above. Safranin stain-Oocysts of Cryptosporidium often (but not always) stain a bright reddish-orange color. This method, advocated for Cyclospora, is not widely used for Cryptosporidium because the Cryptosporidium oocysts may not always properly stain. - Trichrome stain-Oocysts may be detected, but should not be confirmed, by this method. This staining method is inadequate for definitive diagnosis because all oocysts will appear unstained. Oocysts appear as small round structures measuring 4 to 6 im. Other methods for detecting Cryptosporidium in stool. - Enzyme immunoassay (EIA)-The EIA does not rely on microscopy skills, is highly sensitive and specific, and is useful for screening large numbers of specimens. - Rapid immunochromatographic caridge assays-The rapid caridge assays may be used with preserved specimens and are quick and easy to perform",

This AFB appear as bright fluorescing rods against a dark background. The bacilli, because of their contrast, are visualized even under a high power objective in contrast to oil immersion objective in ZN stain, thus enabling rapid screening of the larger areas of the smear. These fluorescent-stained slides can be screened faster, because the AFB stands against the nonfluorescent background. This is the major advantage of this staining method, hence is adopted in the laboratories where many smears are to be examined for AFB.

Organisms are: V cholerae Clostridium perfringens Cryptosporidia Adenovirus ETEC B. cereus Microsporidia Staph. aureus Giardia Rotavirus Invasion of the intestinal epithelial cells (Inflammatory) The organisms have virulence factors that allow binding and invasion into cells.

Cyclosporiasis has been linked to waterborne and foodborne infections. Altered mucosal architecture with shoening of intestinal villi due to diffuse edema and infiltration of inflammatory cells leads to diarrhea, anorexia, fatigue, and weight loss. The duration of symptoms among untreated, non immune persons is often prolonged but ultimately self-limited, with remitting-relapsing symptoms lasting up to several weeks or months. The incubation period for Cyclospora infections is about 1 week, similar to infections with Cryptosporidium. The diagnosis can be made by detection of spherical 8- to 10-m oocysts in the stool, although routine stool ova and parasite (O+P) examinations are not sufficient. Specific fecal examinations must be requested to detect the oocysts, which are variably acid-fast and are fluorescent when viewed with ultraviolet light microscopy. All the parasites mentioned in the question cause chronic diarrhea (mostly in immunocompromised patients). All of them reveal oocyst on stool examination. In Giardiasis, parasite is also seen along with oocyst stool examination. Oocyst of all the organisms except giardia are acid fast. The diagnosis rests on the size of the oocyst. Ref: Brooks G.

        "exp": "Nucleic acid amplification Chlamydial infections are frequently asymptomatic. - Confirmation of chlamydial infection usually depends on taking an appropriate clinical sample. from the patient, followed by the direct detection of the organism using a suitable laboratory-based diagnostic test. The demonstration of chlamydial antibodies (serology) in an individual is rarely diagnostic. For many years, the optimum method of confirming the presence of chlamydial infection was the growth of the infecting organism in cell culture and the demonstration of characteristic chlamydial inclusions. - However, this method necessitated the availability of good transpo and cold-storage facilities in order to maintain the bility of the organism prior to inoculation. - Moreover growth and isolation of the organisms in cell culture was relatively tedious and difficult to quality control. - Chlamydial cell culture, facilities were available to relatively few clinical centres. - It is now widely recognized that cell culture techniques were, at best, only 60 to 80% sensitive. A key advance in the laboratory diagnosis of chlamydial infections has been the development of non-bility dependent tests which place less demand on specimen transpo. The first of these tests were the chlamydial antigen detection tests, which relied, either on The direct detection of chlamydial elementary bodies in clinical material using fluorochrome-labelled, chlamydial specific, monoclonal antibodies. Direct immunofluorescence - Capture and detection of chlamydial antigen in an extract of clinical material using enzyme immunoassay based procedures. These methods are still appropriate in some settings and they remain in widespread use. However, they are gradually being superseded by newer, methods based on the detection of chlamydial nucleic acid, either by -- Direct hybridization or by - Nucleic acid amplification The latter use a variety of amplification reactions including the:? - Polymerase chain reaction - Ligase chain reaction - Strand displacement amplification or transcription mediated amplification. Nucleic acid-based methods generally offer superior sensitivity and specificity to the antigen detection tests, but at greater cost and a greater requirement for trained staff. A second major advance has been the recognition that cervical or urethral specimens requiring invasive genital sampling are by no means essential for the laboratory diagnosis of chlamydial infection. Non invasive and or self collected samples which may be adequate include male and, female urine, various vulval-introital samples or vaginal fluid expressed from a tampon. More on chlamydial diagnosis Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular parasite. It cannot survive outside its host i. e. it cannot grow on cell free media. - Up until the early 1980s, the main method of confirming a diagnosis of chlamydial infection, was the inoculation of clinical material into animals, embryonated hens eggs or (usually) tissue culture cells and the demonstration of characteristic chlamydial inclusions. Generally speaking inclusions were demonstrated in cell culture? - Either by staining with iodine - By staining with Giemsa stain - Fluorochrome-labelled poly - or mono-clonal antibody - Enzyme immunohistochemistry The usual tissue culture cells were - - He. La 229, - L434 mouse fibroblasts or C'. trachomatis and C. psittaci; - Mc. Coy cells - Buffalo Green Monkey kidney cells (C. psittaci and - HL or Hep2 cells C. pneumoniae) Growth of the organisms was facilitated by the use of? - Antimetabolites directed against the host cell (cyclohexitnide; emetine or ntitomycin C) or, - By the use of charged anionic polymers such as Poly - L - lysine or DEAR dextran for C trachomatis TRIO biovar.

All Staphylococci produce catalase, an enzyme responsible for conversion of toxic hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen which accumulates during bacterial metabolism or is released following phagocytosis. Kinases dissolve fibrin clots thus enabling the organism to invade and spread throughout the body. Staphylococcus aureus produces staphylokinase which is fibrinolytic. Coagulase is the exoenzyme produced by Staphylococcus aureus and it clots the plasma. Lipase hydrolyzes lipids, and aids in the survival of staphylococci in the sebaceous glands.

These parasites live in the intestines of dogs, cats and wild animals and should not be confused with other members of the hookworm family for which humans are definitive hosts, namely Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. Colloquially called creeping eruption due to its presentation, the disease is also somewhat ambiguously known as \"ground itch\" or (in some pas of the Southern USA) \"sandworms\", as the larvae like to live in sandy soil.

Shiga toxin contains an enzymatic domain and 5 binding domains which bind to globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), a glycosphingolipid on the surface of cells and the complex is internalized. The internalized shiga toxin hydrolyse the ribosomes, preventing fuher protein synthesis. Shiga toxin is composed of two distinct peptide subunits: The first located on the larger A subnit is an N-glycosidase that hydrolyzes adenine from specific sites of ribosomal RNA of the mammalian 60s ribosomal subunit, irreversibly inhibiting protein synthesis. The second is a binding site on the B subunit that recognizes glycolipids of target cell membranes (glycolipid Gb 3). Ref: Toxins and Hemostasis: From Bench to Bedside By R.

Oct 2008: 21(4): 606-625 Candida parapsilosis is an emerging major human pathogen that has dramatically increased in significance and prevalence over the past 2 decades, such that C. parapsilosis is now the second leading causes of invasive candidal disease. Individuals at the highest risk for severe infection include neonates and patients in intensive care units. C. parapsilosis infections are especially associated with hyperalimentation solutions, prosthetic devices, and indwelling catheters, as well as the nosocomial spread of disease through the hands of health care workers. Factors involved in disease pathogenesis include the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, adhesion to prosthetics, and biofilm formation. Impoant Points about Candida parapsilosis Candida species are presently the fouh leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infection. Candida albicans is the most frequent isolate from blood cultures followed by Candida parapsilosis C. parapsilosis does not form true hyphae and exists in either a yeast phase or a pseudohyphal form. C. parapsilosis is notorious for its capacity to grow in total parenteral nutrition and to form biofilms on catheters and other implanted devices, for nosocomial spread by hand carriage. C. parapsilosis is of special concern in critically ill neonates, causing more than one-quaer of all invasive fungal infections in low-bih-weight infants. Additionally, it is the predominant fungal organism isolated in many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), where it is often associated with neonatal moality C. parapsilosis is also a normal human commensal, and it is one of the fungi most frequently isolated from the subungal space of human hands C. parapsilosis fungemia can lead to seeding of tissues, resulting in deep-seated infections, and has a moality rate ranging from 4% to 45% Compared to C. albicans, C. parapsilosis more frequently caused fungemia among neonates, in patients with intravenous lines or vascular catheters, who had received prior antifungal agents, were on parenteral nutrition, or had undergone transplantation.",

The presence of malaria pigment is very characteristic of the older stages of Plasmodium sp. P. falciparum often contains a single black dot. P. vivax often contains countless fine golden yellow/brown specks of malaria pigment. In P. ovale and P. malariae the pigment inclusions are many and brownish black. Countless fine red spots in the red blood cell (Schiiffner's dots) can be seen in P. vivax and P. ovale (the more mature the parasite, the more dots). In P. ovale the dots are sometimes called James's dots. Sometimes a few flecks can be observed in P. falciparum (Maurer's dots or clefts). P. malariae almost never exhibits dots (Ziemann's dots). The visibility of these dots depends to a great extent on the acidity (pH) with which the thin slide preparation is stained (slightly alkaline: pH = 8 is best). The acidity is impoant because blood smears are usually stained for haematological tests with a slightly acid pH.",
