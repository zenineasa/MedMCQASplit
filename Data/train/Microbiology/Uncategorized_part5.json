It produced lytic infection in fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes but could not be established in permanent cell lines.

To resolve this nomenclatural confusion, the International Committee on Virus Nomenclature in 1986 decided on the generic name 'human immunodeficiency virus' (HIV) for these viruses. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) The first indication of a new syndrome came in the summer of 1981, with repos from New York and Loss Angeles (USA) of a sudden unexplained outbreak of two very rare diseases-Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (now pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) in young adults who were homosexuals or addicted to injected narcotics. They appeared to have lost their immune competence, rendering them vulnerable to overwhelming and fatal infections with relatively avirulent micro-organisms, as well as to lymphoid and other malignancies. This condition was given the name 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' (AIDS).

Antibody fragmentation is accomplished using reducing agents and proteases that digest or cleave ceain poions of the immunoglobulin protein structure. Antibody fragments of primary interest are: Antigen-binding fragments such as Fab and b. Class-defining fragments such as Fc that do not bind antigen. Technique of antibody fragmentation Papain digestion: A nonspecific, thiol-endopeptidase defragment IgG molecules into three fragments of similar size: two Fab fragment and one Fc fragment. Pepsin digestion: A nonspecific endopeptidase produces one F(ab')2 fragment and numerous small peptides of the Fc poion. The resulting F(ab')2 fragment is composed of two disulfide-connected Fab units. Ficin digestion A thiol protease that can digest mouse monoclonal Ig. G1 into either F(ab')2 or Fab fragments, depending on the concentration of cysteine included. Types of antibody fragments F(ab')2 fragments: F(ab')2 (110, 000 daltons) fragments contain two antigen-binding regions joined at the hinge through disulfides. This fragment is void of most, but not all, of the Fc region. Fab' fragments: Fab' (55, 000 daltons) fragments can be formed by the reduction of F(ab')2 fragments. The Fab' fragment contains a free sulfhydryl group that may be alkylated or utilized in conjugation with an enzyme, toxin or other protein of interest. Fab' is derived from F(ab')2. Fab fragments: Fab (50, 000 daltons) is a monovalent fragment that is produced from IgG and IgM, consisting of the VH, CH1 and VL, CL regions, linked by an intramolecular disulfide bond. Fv fragments: Fv (25, 000 daltons) is the smallest fragment produced from IgG and IgM that contains a complete antigen-binding site. Fv fragments have the same binding propeies and similar three-dimensional binding characteristics as Fab. Fc fragments: Fc (50, 000 daltons) fragments contain the CH2 and CH3 region and pa of the hinge region held together by one or more disulfides and noncovalent interactions. Fc and Fc5jt fragments are produced from fragmentation of IgG and IgM, respectively. The term Fc is derived from the ability of these antibody fragments to crystallize. The Fc fragment cannot bind antigen, but it is responsible for the effector functions of antibodies, such as complement fixation.",

Clostridium perfringens cause two impoant diseases:? Gas gangrene \"Clostridium perfringens is the commonest cause of gas gangrene\". The disease is characterized by rapidly spreading edema, myositis and necrosis of tissues, gas production and profound toxemia. Clostridium perfringens produces several toxins and other substance which have a role in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. \"tx Toxin a phospholipase lecithinase\" is generally considered to be the most impoant toxin in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. -It is produced by all types of clostridium perfringens and most abundantly by type \"A\" strains. - It is the most impoant toxin biologically and is responsible. for profound toxemia of the gas gangrene. - It is a \"phospholipase\". Other factors which also have a role in virulence:- Hyaluronidase It breaks down intercellular cement substance and promotes the spread of the infection along the tissue planes Collagenases and other proteinases They break down tissues and viually liquefy muscles. Clostridium food poisoning:- Clostridium perfringens is an impoant cause of food poisoning. The. food poisoning is caused due to ingestion of spores. The spores of the clostridium perfringens strains that cause food poisoning are heat resistant. - The unique feature of spores produced by food poisoning strains of clostridium perfringens is that they are heat resistant that can survive boiling for several hours. Remember - Only those strains of clostridia which are associated with food poisoning produce heat resistant spores Where as - The classic strains of this species do not have heat resistant spores. These spores are inactivated within few minutes by boiling. Typical food poisoning strains of clostridium perfringens occur as carrier state. These strains also occur in animals thus meat is often contaminated with heat resistant spores. The vehicle of infection is usually a precooked meat food that has been allowed to stand at a temperature. The heat resistance of the spores ensures their survival in cooking. - During the cooling period they germinate in the anaerobic environment produced by the cooked meat and multiply. - Anyone who eats this meat will consume the equivalent of cooked meat broth culture of the organisms. - Large numbers of clostridia are thus consumed which may pass unharmed by the gastric acid due to high protein in the meat and reach the intestines where they produce the enterotoxin. - After an incubation period of 8-24 hours abdominal pain diarrhoea set in. Naegeler reaction It is used to detect alpha toxin which is a phospholipase thinaseC) - Lecithinase or phospholipase in the presence of Ca' and Mg\" ions splits lecithin into phosphorylcholine and diacylglycerol. This reaction is seen as an \"opalescence\" in serum or egg yolk media. Procedure Cl perfringens is grown on a plate where one half of the plate is covered with alpha antitoxin. The half poion of the plate without the antitoxin produces opalescene. - Phospholipase or a toxin splits the lecithin into phosphorylcholine and diacyl glycerol. Which is seen as opalescnee. The other half of the plate where alpha antitoxin is present does not demonstrate opalescence because here alpha toxin or phospholipase is neutralized by the toxin.",

These include - al- antitrypsin, al acid glycoprotein, CRP, haptoglobin and fibrinogee. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), a polypeptide released from mononuclear phagocytic cells, is the principal - but not the sole -stimulator of synthesis of majority of acute phase reactants by hepatocytes. Cytokine IL-6 are also involved. Nuclear factor Kappa-B (NFKB) is a transcription factor that has been involved in the stimulation of synthesis of acute phase proteins. CRP (a type of pentraxin protein) is synthesized by liver in response to factors released by fat cells. It binds to phosphotholine expressed on surface of dead or dying cells in order to activate classic complement pathway C1q. Its level is mainly determined by rate of production (rises within 6 hours, peak in 48 hours & t1/2 is constant)",

Which of the following is the genus of the bacterium most likely to be isolated from this patient's sputum?",
        "exp": "The clinical and radiologic characteristics of this patient's condition are consistent with lobar pneumonia, a respiratory infection that, in its classic presentation, involves a single pulmonary lobe. In 90% to 95% of cases, the etiologic agent is Streptococcus pneumoniae (AKA pneumococcus), an alpha-hemolytic streptococcus present in the throat of 40% to 70% of healthy individuals. A small minority of cases of lobar pneumonia are due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococci, streptococci other than pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas, and Proteus. Penicillin is the drug of choice for pneumococcal pneumonia, but sputum cultures are necessary to identify the infectious agent and determine its antibiotic sensitivity. S. pneumoniae is a major cause of purulent meningitis in the elderly. Other alpha-hemolytic streptococci (viridans streptococci) cause subacute endocarditis in patients with previously altered cardiac valves. Streptococcus mutans and other oral streptococci have been associated with dental caries. Bacteria belonging to the genera Haemophilus and Klebsiella cause respiratory infections; however, in immunocompetent individuals, these bacterial infections usually result in bronchopneumonia, which leads to multilobar, and often bilateral, pulmonary involvement. Beta-hemolytic streptococci cause countless infections in humans. Recall that classification of beta;-hemolytic streptococci is based on their surface antigens known as Lancefield antigens. Human diseases caused by this group of bacteria include: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A): pharyngitis, scarlet fever, erysipelas, impetigo, rheumatic fever, and glomerulonephritis. Streptococcus agalactiae (group B): neonatal sepsis and urinary infections - Enterococcus faecalis (group D): endocarditis and urinary infections. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 15.

If present in high numbers, adult worms may cause mechanical obstruction of the bowel and bile and pancreatic ducts. Worms tend to migrate if drugs such as anesthetics or steroids are given, leading to bowel perforation and peritonitis, anal passage of worms, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

Use sterile equipment and aseptic technique to collect specimens to prevent introduction of microorganisms during invasive procedures. 4) Clearly label the specimen container with patient's name, hospital number or other identifying number (i. e. bih date, requisition number), date and time of collection. 5) Collect an adequate amount of specimen. Inadequate amounts of specimen may yield false-negative results. 6) If a specimen is collected through intact skin, cleanse the skin first. For example, use 70% alcohol followed by iodine solution (1 to 2% tincture of iodine or 10% solution of povidone iodine). 7) Collect fluid specimens in sturdy, sterile, screw cap, leak proof containers with lids that do not create an aerosol when opened. Specimens obtained by a physician using needle aspiration should be transferred to a sterile tube or anaerobi transpo l prior to transpo of the specimen to the laboratory. If there is little material in the syringe, the physician should draw a small amount of sterile nonbacteriostatic 0. 85% Na. CI through the syringe and then transfer the specimen to a sterile tube. Alternatively, and ONLY if the specimen will be compromised by transferring it from the syringe, a small amount of sterile 0. 85% Na. CI may be drawn into the syringe prior to removal of the needle. DO NOT TRANSPO SYRINGES WITH NEEDLES ATTACHED AND/OR RECAPPED. Attach syringe cap ONLY if necessary.

        "question": "Stage of falciparum not seen in peripheral blood smear: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Schizont P. falciparum differs from the other forms of malarial parasites in that developing erythrocytic schizonts aggregate in the capillaries of the brain and other internal organs, so that only young ring forms are found in peripheral blood Life cycle of all Plasmodium species Infection in humans begins with the bite of an infected female Anopheline mosquito. Sporozoites are the infective form of the parasite, present in the salivary glands of the female anopheles mosquito. Sporozoites released from the salivary glands of the mosquito enter the bloodstream during feeding, quickly invading liver cells (hepatocytes). Sporozoites are cleared from the circulation within 30 minutes. During the next 14 days in the case of P. falciparum, the liver-stage parasites differentiate and undergo asexual multiplication resulting in tens of thousands of merozoites which burst from the hepatoctye. Individual merozoites invade red blood cells (erythrocytes) and undergo an additional round of multiplication producing 12-16 merozoites within a schizont. The length of this erythrocytic stage of the parasite life cycle depends on the parasite species: - Irregular cycle for P. falciparum, - 48 hours for P. vivax, and P. ovale and - 72 hours for P. malariae. The clinical manifestations of malaria, fever and chills, are associated with the synchronous rupture of the infected erythrocyte. The released merozoites go on to invade additional erythrocytes. Not all of the merozoites divide into schizonts, some differentiate into sexual forms, male and female gametocytes. These gametocytes are taken up by a female anophylean mosquito during a blood meal. Within the mosquito midgut, the male gametocyte undergoes a rapid nuclear division, producing 8 flagellated microgametes which feilize the female macrogamete. The resulting ookinete traverses the mosquito gut wall and encysts on the exterior of the gut wall as a oocyst. Soon the oocyst ruptures, releasing hundreds of sporozoites into the mosquito body cavity where they eventually migrate to the mosquito salivary gland. To diagnose malaria and determine which species of Plasmodium is causing the infection, blood film is examined. Each species has distinctive physical characteristics that are apparent under a microscope. In P. falciparum, only early (ring-form) trophozoites and gametocytes are seen in the peripheral blood. It is unusual to see mature trophozoites or schizonts in peripheral blood smears as these are usually sequestered in the tissues. The parasitised erythrocytes are not enlarged, and it is common to see cells with more than one parasite within them (multiply parasitised erythrocytes). On occasion, faint comma-shaped red dots called \"Maurer's dots\" are seen on the red cell surface. The comma-shaped dots can also appear as pear-shaped blotches. Plasmodium falciparum causes severe malaria a distinctive propey not shared by any other human malaria, that of sequestration. Within the 48-hour asexual blood stage cycle, the mature forms change the surface propeies of infected red blood cells causing them to stick to blood vessels (a process called cytoadherence). This leads to obstruction of the microcirculation and results in dysfunction of multiple organs, typically the brain in cerebral malaria.",

This autolytic activity can be augmented by surface active agents, such as bile and bile salts.

The sporozoites are taken up by hepatocytes within 30 minutes. The exo-erythrocytic phase consists of cell multiplication and differentiation into merozoites. P. vivax and P. ovale produce a latent form (hypnozoite) in the liver. This form is the cause of relapses seen with vivax and ovale malaria. The sexual cycle begins in the human red blood cells when some merozoites develop into male and others into female gametocytes. The gametocyte-containing red blood cells are ingested by the female Anopheles mosquito. Note Hence infective form for human is Sporozoites and infective form for mosquito is Gametocytes.

Impetigo - Superficial infection of skin (Pyoderma)- Occurs in young patients - Usually involves face and leg.. Cellulitis. Lymphangitis 3) Deep soft tissue infections. Necrotizing fascitis (hemolytic streptococcal gangrene) Myositis - (Most common organism causing myositis is S. aureus) 4) Abscesses - in brain, lungs, liver, and kidney. 5) Scarlet fever. Consists of pharyngitis, accompanied by a characteristic rash.. Caused by production of erythrogenic toxin. 6) Puerperal sepsis.

The disease in question is poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, as evidenced by the smoky urine, hypertension, edema, and red blood cell casts in the urine sediment. The history of the prior sore throat is a tip-off that this is a nonsuppurative sequelae of an infection due to Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta;-hemolytic Streptococci). You must remember the features of S. pyogenes. S. pyogenes can be differentiated from Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans Streptococci by its hemolytic pattern; it is beta-hemolytic, while the others are alpha-hemolytic. It can be distinguished from the other beta-hemolytic Streptococci by its sensitivity to the a ntibiotic bacitracin. Other impoant things to remember about S. pyogenes are its many virulence factors, including M protein, antiphagocytic capsule, hyaluronidase, streptolysins O and S, and erythrogenic toxins. 2nd option is incorrect because Streptococci are catalase negative, in contrast to Staphylococci, which are catalase positive. 3rd option is incorrect because S. pyogenes is coagulase negative. (In fact, a coagulase test should NOT be done on a catalase-negative organism.) The coagulase test is an impoant means of differentiating Staphylococcus aureus, which are coagulase positive, from all other species of Staphylococcus, which are coagulase negative. Ref: Ray C.

Acanthamoeba meningoencephalitis is a subacute or chronic illness that also is usually fatal. Naegleria infections associated with freshwater swimming. Histologic evidence suggests that Naegleria traverses the nasal mucosa and the cribriform plate to the central nervous system. A careful examination of the cerebrospinal fluid often provides a presumptive diagnosis of Naegleria infection. The fluid is usually bloody and demonstrates an intense neutrophilic response. The protein level is elevated and the glucose level decreased. No bacteria can be demonstrated on stain or culture. Early examination of a wet mount preparation of unspun spinal fluid reveals typical trophozoites. Staining with specific fluorescent antibody confirms the identification. Acanthamoeba encephalitis usually involve older, immunocompromised persons, and a history of freshwater swimming is generally absent. The clinical course of Acanthamoeba disease is more prolonged than that of Naegleria infection and occasionally ends in spontaneous recovery; the disease in immunocompromised hosts is invariably fatal. The spinal fluid usually demonstrates a mononuclear response. Amebas can occasionally be visualized in or cultured from the cerebrospinal fluid or biopsy specimens. Ref: Ray C. G., Ryan K. J. (2010).

Approximately 80% of all repoed cases of Travellers' Diarrhoea are due to bacterial pathogens. The most common causes in adults are said to be Campylobacter, enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and Shigella. ETEC infection E. coli bacteria which produce enterotoxins, ETEC, are the single most common cause of Traveller's Diarrhoea, responsible for an estimated one-half of all diarrhoeal episodes in travellers to high risk regions. ETEC infection leads to profuse, watery diarrhoea, which although usually self limiting can be very uncomfoable and disruptive to normal activities. One of the major ETEC toxins that cause the intestinal fluid imbalance leading to watery diarrhoea is similar in structure and function to the cholera toxin. Indeed, ETEC infections can cause disease of comparable severity to cholera. Campylobacter jejuni infection Approximately one-fouh of Travellers' Diarrhoea cases are caused by infection by Campylobacter jejuni. This pathogen is often responsible for more serious symptoms of the disease. Infection can result in mild diarrhoea to severe dysentery, frequently associated with fever, abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting. Most significantly, people recovering from Campylobacter jejuni infections can be at risk for developing long lasting conditions, including reactive ahritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome.

Though they can grow in cell free media but they have a limited biosynthetic ability so they need a rich growth medium containing natural animal protein (usually blood serum) and in most cases a sterol component. The sterol component is required beause mycoplasma contains sterol in their cell membrane. Mycoplasmas are also unique because they do not have a regular cell wall instead they are bound by a cell membrane consisting primarily of sterol. Because of their small size nzycoplasma usually do not produce turbidity in liquid media. A pH indicator is added to liquid media to detect growth by acid products. The absence of the cell wall gives two characteristic propey to mycoplasma:- The absence of cell wall makes them highly pleomorphic. Mycoplasmas are completely resistant to penicillin because, they lack the cell wall structure at which penicillin acts instead they are inhibited by tetracycline or erythromycin. Mycoplasma and L forms of bacteria (cell wall defective bacteria) L phase bacterias are cell wall defective bacterias that can replicate serially as non rigid cells and can produce colonies on solid media. L forms develop when many bacterias either spontaneously or induced by ceain cell wall inhibiting drugs lose pa or all of their cell wall and develop into L forms. Some L phase variants are stable; others are unstable and reve to their bacterial parental forms. It has been suggested that mycoplasmas may represent stable L forms of bacteria but genetic, antigenic and biochemical evidence are against the possibility. The characteristic of the cell wall defective forms may be similar to those of inycoplasma hut by definition, mycopla. smas do not reve to parental bacterial forms or originate from them.

All three of this patient's secondary infections (Pneumocystis pneumonia, Candida esophagitis, and Herpes esophagitis) are considered to be \"AIDS-defining illnesses, \" that indicate that the patient's HIV infection has progressed to the point of producing profound immunosuppression. HIV is a member of the Lentivirus subgroup of retroviruses. This viral family is characterized by prolonged infections, often with a latent period. These viruses are usually inadequately opposed by the host immune response, and often can infect the nervous system. The Retroviridae also include the oncovirus group that includes the human T-cell Leukemia/Lymphotropic virus. The family Retroviridae includes seven subfamilies members, of which two of the families infect humans with pathologic consequences: the delta retroviruses, of which human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) type I is the most impoant in humans; and lentiviruses, of which HIV is the most impoant in humans. Also Know: The Caliciviridae includes the Norwalk virus and the virus that causes Hepatitis E. Coronaviruses cause upper respiratory illnesses.

Autoinfection occurs by scratching the perianal area and transferring infective eggs to the mouth with contaminated hands. Dwarf tapeworm (Hymenolepis nana, also known as Rodentolepis nana, Vampirolepis nana, Hymenolepis fraterna, and Taenia nana) is a cosmopolitan species though most common in temperate zones, and is one of the most common cestodes infecting humans, especially children. Infection is acquired most commonly from eggs in the feces of another infected individual, which are transferred in food, by contamination. Direct contaminative infection by eggs is probably the most common route in human cases. The nematode (roundworm) Enterobius vermicularis is widely known as the human pinworm due to the female's long, pointed tail. Infection occurs via self-inoculation (transferring eggs to the mouth with hands that have scratched the perianal area) or through exposure to eggs in the environment (e. g. contaminated surfaces, clothes, bed linens, etc.) Taeniasis in humans is a parasitic infection caused by the tapeworm species Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm), Taenia solium (pork tapeworm), and Taenia asiatica (Asian tapeworm). Humans can become infected with these tapeworms by eating raw or undercooked beef (T. saginata) or pork (T. solium and T. asiatica). People with taeniasis may not know they have a tapeworm infection because symptoms are usually mild or nonexistent. Taenia solium tapeworm infections can lead to cysticercosis, which is a disease that can cause seizures Ref: https://www. cdc. gov/parasites/taeniasis/index. html https://www. cdc. gov/parasites/pinworm/biology. html https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Hymenolepis_nana",

The reaction may involve skin (uicaria and eczema), eyes (conjunctivitis), nasopharynx (rhinorrhea, rhinitis), bronchopulmonary tissues (asthma) and gastrointestinal tract (gastroenteritis). The reaction usually takes 15 - 30 minutes from the time of exposure to the antigen, although sometimes it may have a delayed onset (10 - 12 hours). For example allergic asthma, hay fever etc. Immediate hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE. Type II hypersensitivity is also known as cytotoxic hypersensitivity and may affect a variety of organs and tissues. The antigens are normally endogenous, although exogenous chemicals (haptens) which can attach to cell membranes can also lead to type II hypersensitivity. Drug-induced hemolytic anemia, granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia are such examples. Phagocytes and K cells may also play a role. The reaction time is minutes to hours. Type II hypersensitivity is primarily mediated by antibodies of the IgM or IgG classes and complement. Example include erythroblastosis fetalis, Goodpasture's nephritis Type III hypersensitivity is also known as immune complex hypersensitivity. The reaction may be general (e. g., serum sickness) or may involve individual organs including skin (e. g., systemic lupus erythematosus, Ahus reaction), kidneys (e. g., lupus nephritis), lungs (e. g., aspergillosis), blood vessels (e. g., polyaeritis), joints (e. g., rheumatoid ahritis) or other organs. This reaction may be the pathogenic mechanism of diseases caused by many microorganisms. Examples include SLE, farmer's lung disease Type IV hypersensitivity is also known as cell mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity. The classical example of this hypersensitivity is tuberculin (Montoux) reaction which peaks 48 hours after the injection of antigen (PPD or old tuberculin). The lesion is characterized by induration and erythema. Example includes tuberculin test, poison ivy, granuloma",

Symptoms include urethral discharge (often whitish and mucoid rather than frankly purulent), dysuria, and urethral itching. Physical examination may reveal meatal erythema and tenderness as well as a urethral exudate. At least one-third of male patients with C. trachomatis urethral infection have no evident signs or symptoms of urethritis.

Most other cells, include CD8 T lymphocytes (suppressor T cells) and B cells, are not paicularly susceptible to the HIV virus. HIV preferentially infects and kills helper (CD4) T lymphocytes, resulting in the loss of cell-mediated immunity and a high probability that the host will develop oppounistic infections. Other cells (e. g., macrophages and monocytes) that have CD4 proteins on their surfaces can be infected also. Also know: The genome of HIV consists of two identical molecules of single-stranded, positive-polarity RNA and is said to be diploid. In addition to the three typical retroviral genes gag, pol, and env, which encode the structural proteins, the genome RNA has six regulatory genes. Two of these regulatory genes, tat and rev, are required for replication, and the other four, nef, vif, vpr, and vpu, are not required for replication and are termed \"accessory\" genes.

Attachment to host cells is mediated by bacterial type IV pili, heat-shock proteins, and the major outer-membrane protein. Because the organisms possess pili that may mediate adherence to respiratory tract epithelial cells, conditions that impair mucociliary clearance, including cigarette smoking, lung disease, or alcoholism, predispose to Legionnaires' disease. Cell-mediated immunity is the primary mechanism of host defense against Legionella, as it is against other intracellular pathogens. Thus Legionnaires' disease is more common and its manifestations are more severe among patients with depressed cell-mediated immunity Alveolar macrophages readily phagocytose Legionella. The attachment of the bacteria to phagocytes is mediated Fc receptors and complement receptors, which attach to the bacterial major outer-membrane protein. Binding to these receptors promotes phagocytosis but fails to trigger an oxidative burst.",

Toxic shock syndrome is most commonly caused by toxic shock syndrome toxin type-I (TSST-I), which is a superantigen produced by Staphylococcus aureus.. Option 'b' is tricky one. First read following statement. \"Toxic shock syndrome (T-S. S.) was first recognized as a disease in children in 1978, but disease gained national attention in early 1980 following outbreaks in the USA in menstruating women using highly absorbent vaginal tampons withdrawl of tampon from the market resulted in a rapid decline in the incidence of this disease\".. Do not misinterpret this statement - mensturation as such is not a risk factor, rather mensturating women which use vaginal tampons were at risk and vaginal tampons were responsible for TSS in mensturating women. If mensturation would have been a risk factor, then every women in reproductive age would be at risk for TSS, which is not the case. So, option 'b' is wrong.. Anti- staphylococcal antibodies are used in the treatment of TSS. Treatment of TSS The severity of this disease frequently warrants hospotalization. Admission to the intensive care unit is often necessary for suppoive care (for aggressive fluid management, ventilation, renal replacement therapy and inotropic suppo), paicularly in the case of mutliple organ failure. Antibiotic treatment should cover both S. pyogenes and S. aureus. This may include a combination of cephalosporins, penic ill ins or vancomycin. The addition of clindamycin or gentamicin reduces toxin production and moiality.",

Neisseria gonorrhoea infections have a high prevalence and low moality where as N. meningitides infections have low prevalence and high moality. Many Neisseria species are a pa of normal flora in humans and animals. Neisseria meningitides. frequently occurs in a carrier state in the absence of any disease. However, Neisseria Gonorrhoea is an \"obligate pathogen\" and is never pa of the normal human flora under any circumstances. Gonococci is exclusive to humans Gonorrhoea is an exclusive human disease, there being no natural infection in animals. The only source of infection is a human carrier or less often a patient. In women gonococcus usually cause asymptomatic infection wheras in men the infection is usually symptomatic. Clinical features of Gonococcal infection:- Neisseria Gonorrhoea infection is acquired by sexual contacts and usually affects the mucous membrane of the urethra in males and endocervix and urethra in females. They mainly affect the host's columnar or cuboidal epithelium. - The vaginal mucosa is usually not affected in the adults because the stratified squamous epithelium is resistant to infection by the cocci and also because of the acid pH of vaginal secretions. Clinical disease as a rule is less severe in females. - In women gonococcus usually cause \"asymptomatic infection\" the existence of asymptomatic carriage in women makes them a reservoir serving to perpetuate infection among their male contacts. Gonococcal infection in men is usually \"symptomatic\". - In men the disease stas as an acute urethritis. PID - 1f gonococcal infections are asymptomatic or unrecognized may progress to P. 1. D.

Other immunoglobulin classes IgA, IgM, IgE, IgD are usually produced after bih and are not transmitted transplacentally. Increased levels of IgM at bih can indicate an intrauterine infection. CMV is the most common congenital infection. Overall risk of infection is greatest during third trimester(transplacental). CMV disease in infected newborns is characterized by jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, purpura, microcephaly, periventricular CNS infection, mental retardation and motor disability. EBV is primarily transmitted by close contact with infectious oropharyngeal secretions, it is also transmitted by blood transfusion and transplacental routes.

The initial step in infection is the binding of gp120 envelop glycoprotein to CD4 molecules. This binding leads to a conformational change that result in the formation of a new recognition site on gp120 for the coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4. The next step involves conformational changes in gp41.

Infection is acquired by the consumption of oocysts, after which the parasite invades intestinal epithelial cells and undergoes both sexual and asexual cycles of development. Oocysts excreted in stool are not immediately infectious but must undergo fuher maturation. In patients who have AIDS, infections often are not self-limited but rather resemble cryptosporidiosis, with chronic, profuse watery diarrhea. Eosinophilia, which is not found in other enteric protozoan infections, may be detectable. The diagnosis is usually made by detection of the large (25-m) oocysts in stool by modified acid-fast staining. Oocyst excretion may be low-level and intermittent; if repeated stool examinations are unrevealing, sampling of duodenal contents by aspiration or small-bowel biopsy (often with electron-microscopic examination) may be necessary.

CMV also causes serious disease in immunosuppressed patients, including bone marrow recipients and AIDS patients. Ganciclovir is the drug of choice, although foscarnet has also been used with some success. Infections with hepatitis viruses, if symptomatic, are characterized by jaundice, lethargy, failure to thrive, abdominal distention, clay- colored stools, and elevated transaminase levels. Hepatitis B is the only viral hepatitis agent that is recognized as an impoant cause of neonatal disease. The infection is usually acquired during the bih process; therapy includes hyperimmune human anti-hepatitis B serum followed a few weeks later with active immunization with HBs. Ag injections.

As the secretions of the worm contain anticoagulant activity, bleeding from the site may continue for several days adding to the blood loss.

CRP was so named because it was first discovered as a substance in the serum of patients with acute inflammation that reacted with the C- (capsular) polysaccharide of pneumococcus. CAP is another name for the CRP protein. CAP stands for catabolite activator protein; CRP stands for cyclic-AMP receptor protein. This can be the answer here, but it is not given in the options. So the only related option is Capsular Polysacharide in Pneumococcus. Therefore we can select it as answer of this question.

Clostridium botulinum (a common honey contaminant) was ingested and produced toxin in the infant.

Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction and impairment of this can lead to muscle weakness, failure to thrive, and in more serious cases, respiratory impairment.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Because of tetanospasmin Clostridium tetani is a gram (+)ve, spore forming, anaerobic bacillus. Tetanospasmin (neurotoxin) is responsible for tetanus. Tetanus is characterized by increased muscle tone (muscle spasm) and rigidity. Diagnosis of tetanus The diagnosis of tetanus is based entirely on clinical findings. The diagnosis is established on the basis of history of an injury, (paicularly one in which either soil or fecal material has been introduced) 6-12 days before the onset of typical clinical findings. Wound should be cultured in suspected cases. However, C. tetani can be isolated from wounds of patients without tetanus and frequently cannot be recovered from wounds of those with tetanus. Other laboratory findings may be - i) There may be leukocytosis ii) Muscle enzyme levels may be raised iii) Electromyogram may show continuous discharge of motor units and shoening or absence of the silent interval normally seen after an action potential. Treatment of tetanus Treatment of tetanus includes:? 1) Antimicrobial therapy:- Antibiotic therapy is administered to eradicate vegetative cells, i. e. to eliminate the source of toxins. Penicillin and metronidazole are first line drugs. Clindamycin and erythromycin are alternatives for penicillin - allergic patients. (Tetracycline is not used). 2) Antitoxin:- is given to neutralize circulating toxin. Human tetanus immune globuline (TIG) is the preparation of choice. 3) Control of muscle spasms:- Many agents, alone or in combination, have been used to treat the muscle spasms of tetanus, which are painful and can threaten ventilation by causing laryngospasm or sustained contraction of ventilatory muscles. Benzodiazepines (Diazepam, larazepam, midazolam) are used most commonly. Alternatives are Barbiturates and chlorpromazine. Mechanical ventilation with a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent may be used for spasms unresponsive to medications. Other agents include propofol, dantrolene, intrathecal beclofen, succinylcholine and magnesium sulfate. 4) Respiratory care:- Intubation or tracheostomy, with or without mechanical ventilation may be required. 5) Autonomic dysfunction:- For sympathetic overactivity labetalol, esmolol or clonidine may be used. Vaccine:- Patient recovering from tetanus should be actively immunized",

HIV tropism of a patient's virus is measured by the Trofile assay. HIV can infect a variety of cells such as CD4+ helper T- cells and macrophages that express the CD4 molecule on their surface. HIV-1 entry to macrophages and T helper cells is mediated not only through interaction of the virion envelope glycoproteins (gp120) with the CD4 molecule on the target cells but also with its chemokine coreceptors. Macrophage (M-tropic) strains of HIV-1, or non-syncitia-inducing strains (NSI) use the beta-chemokine receptor CCR5 for entry and are thus able to replicate in macrophages and CD4+ T-cells. These strains are now called R5 viruses. The normal ligands for this receptor, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1-beta and MIP- I -alpha, are able to suppress HIV-1 infection in vitro. This CCR5 coreceptor is used by almost all primary HIV-1 isolates of viral genetic subtype. T-tropic isolates, or syncitia-inducing (SI) strains replicate in primary CD4+ T-cells as well as in macrophages and use the alpha-chemokine receptor, CXCR4, for entry. These strains are now called X4 viruses. The alpha-chemokine, SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, suppresses replication of T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. It does this by down regulating the expression of CXCR4 on the surface of these cells. Viruses that use only the CCR5 receptor are termed R5, those that use CXCR4 are termed X4, and those that use both X4. R5. However, the use of coreceptor alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection.",
