Conkey (MCK)# mannitol salt agar (MSA)TRANSPORT MEDIAExamples of Transport Media Include* Thioglycolate broth for strict anaerobes* Stuart transport medium - a non-nutrient soft agar gel containing a reducing agent to prevent oxidation, and charcoal to neutralize* Certain bacterial inhibitors- for gonococci, and buffered glycerol saline for enteric bacilli.* Venkat-Ramakrishnan (VR) medium for V. cholerae.",

GROWING BACTERIAL CULTURES IN LIQUIDNUTRIENT BROTH* Nutrient broth is a liquid bacterial growth medium made of powdered beef extract and short chains of amino acids that have been dissolved in water.* Liquid medium is convenient to use for growing bacteria in test tubes, and can reveal information about the oxygen requirements of bacteria growing within.* Bacteria that require oxygen will grow close to the water s surface, and bacteria that cannot tolerate the presence of oxygen will grow at the bottom of the test tube. B GROWING BACTERIAL CULTURES ON SOUP MEDIA* Broth media can be made solid by adding agar, a gel like polysaccharide extracted from red algae.* Broth with about 1. 5% agar added will be liquid when heated, but solid at room temperature, making it easy to pour into a vessel, such as a Petri dish or test tube when hot.* The solution then becomes solid once cooled.",
