The transferable genetic material consists of two different sets of plasmid-encoded genes that may be on the same or different plasmids. One set encodes the actual resistance; the second encodes genes necessary for the bacterial conjugation process. Ref: Gumbo T. (2011). Chapter 48. General Principles of Antimicrobial Therapy. In L.

It was first described as a function of NK cells, which use their Fc receptor, Fcg. RIII, to bind to antibody-coated cells. Fcg. RIII/CD16 is a low-affinity receptor that binds clustered IgG molecules displayed on cell surfaces but does not bind circulating monomeric IgG. Therefore, ADCC occurs only when the target cell is coated with antibody molecules. Engagement of Fcg. RIII by antibody-coated target cells activates the NK cells to synthesize and secrete cytokines such as IFN-g as well as to discharge the contents of their granules, which mediate the killing functions of this cell type. NK cells are the major cell type that carries out antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC can also be carried out by other cells that express Fc receptors and have the machinery to kill targets. Thus neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and macrophages also carry out ADCC, although they use different effector molecules than NK cells.",

A biopsy showed coagulative necrosis of brain parenchyma with macrophage-rich chronic inflammatory infiltration admixed with microscopic cysts that contain characteristic bradyzoites. Which of the following is the most common source of this type of infection?",
        "exp": "Clues to the correct answer are the underlying disease (AIDS), which predisposes to oppounistic infections, the typical MRI appearance of the lesion (ring-enhancing mass), and the histopathologic features (presence of encysted bradyzoites). In sho, this patient has cerebral toxoplasmosis, which represents one of the most common oppounistic infections in AIDS. Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan that infects humans who ingest the oocysts from cat feces or incompletely cooked lamb or pork. Only immunosuppressed patients and fetuses are vulnerable to this infection. In the fetus, toxoplasmosis causes extensive damage to brain parenchyma and retina. Toxoplasmosis associated with AIDS manifests with necrotizing lesions surrounded by chronic inflammation. A ring-enhancing lesion is a mass that contains a rim of contrast enhancement (bright signal on MRI) surrounding a dark core corresponding to central necrosis. In AIDS, the most frequent causes of a ring-enhancing lesion are primary brain lymphoma and toxoplasmosis. Anopheles mosquitoes transmit malaria parasites. Cerebral malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum, which is able to adhere to endothelial cells of small cerebral vessels. Vascular occlusion ensues, resulting in numerous small infarcts. Bird droppings represent the vehicle of infection for two of the most common oppounistic fungal infections affecting immunocompromised patients: cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis. Cryptococcus neoformans causes meningoencephalitis, not intracerebral necrotic lesions. Histoplasma capsulatum rarely affects the brain. These fungi can be visualized in tissue sections by silver stains. Cooling systems may harbor Legionella pneumophila, spreading the bacteria in aerosolized form. L. pneumoniae is a gram-negative bacterium that causes Legionnaire's disease, a fatal form of pneumonia that first struck paicipants at a meeting of the American Legion.

In addition, the vaccine can reduce the need for medical care, biopsies and invasive procedures associated with the follow up from abnormal pap tests. Thus, helping to reduce the health care costs and anxieties related to abnormal pap tests and follow up procedures. HPV vaccines are? 1) Preventive vaccines The role of HPV vaccine is to prevent infection with ceain species of Human papillomavirus associated with the development of cervical cancer, genital was and some less common type of cancers. These vaccines are based on virus like paicles (VLPs) assembled from recombinant HPV coat proteins (major capsid protein L1). Currently, one quadrivalent product containing HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 has been licenced in US and recommended by the centres for disease control and prevention for administration to girls and young women 9-26 years of age -- type 16 and 18 are most impoant as they cause 70% of cervical cancer world wide. Another product contains HPV types 16 and 18 ( bivalent) and is likely to be available in the near future. 2) Therapeutic vaccines (under trial) In addition to above two preventive vaccines, laboratory research and several human clinical trials are focused on the development of therapetic HPV vaccines. In general these vaccines focus on the main HPV oncogenes, E6 and E7. Since expression of E6 and E7 is required for promoting the growth of cervical cancer cells and cells within was, it is hoped that immune responses against two oncogenes might eradicate established tumors.",

Most gram-negatives (other than exceptional microorganisms, such as Mycoplasma, that lack a cell wall) have a more complex cell envelope than gram-positive microorganisms. It includes both a cytoplasmic membrane as well as an outer membrane. Between these two membranes is the periplasmic space, which contains enzymes such as phosphatase and penicillinase, binding proteins for the transpo of various nutrients, and peptidoglycan, as well as a poion of the lipoprotein that firmly anchors the outer that a baby can form with an acute membrane to the peptidoglycan. Gram-positives do not have outer membranes. The cell envelope is incorrect because both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms have this structure, which is defined as all the layers that enclose the cytosol of the bacterium. It is the composition of the envelope that differs between gram-positives and gram-negatives. Exotoxin is not exclusive to gram-negative microorganisms, but is also found in some gram-positives. By contrast, endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) is found exclusively in gram- negatives. Peptidoglycan is found in the cell walls of both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Note that there is a larger amount of peptidoglycan in gram-positive microorganisms. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013). Chapter 2. Cell Structure. In G. F.

The nodules have grown slowly over the course of many years. Biopsy of the lesions shows dermal granulomas with giant cells but no acid-fast bacteria. Culture on blood agar and Lowenstein-Jensen medium shows no growth. These findings are most consistent with which of the following diagnoses?",
        "exp": "Mycobacterium leprae is endemic to pas of Africa, Asia, and South America. Tuberculoid leprosy is an indolent disease, typically affecting cooler pas of the body, such as the nose and ears, producing dermal granulomas with very rare, acid-fast bacilli and damage to peripheral nerves. This is in marked contrast to lepromatous leprosy, which is progressive and invasive and generally characterized by the presence of numerous acid-fast bacteria in a histiocytic, but non-granulomatous tissue response. M. leprae has not been grown in any culture medium. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is due to Leishmania species that show a worldwide distribution. The infection is transmitted through a sandfly bite, and the skin lesion is typically ulcerated. Histology shows intracellular parasites within the dermis and epidermis. Granulomas are not formed. Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is a roundworm infection transmitted by black flies of Africa and South America. The microfilariae grow at the site of inoculation, and cause an inflamed subcutaneous nodule. The organism is seen on tissue sections. Rhinoscleroma is a destructive granulomatous infection of the nasopharynx caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. Gram-negative rods can be cultured from the lesions. Ref: Ray C. G., Ryan K. J.

        "question": "Most sensitive test for Treponema",
        "exp": "FTA-ABS test Most sensitive test in Syphilis The non specific tests (VDRL / RPR) test can be easily ruled out:? Their sensitivity is comparable to that of specific tests in primary and secondary syphilis but in latent or late syphilis they have quite low sensitivity. Specific Tests TPI In its time TPI was the most specific test available. for diagnosis of syphilis and was considered \"gold standard\" in. syphilis serology. However because of its extreme complexity it was available only in. few laboratories. The TP1 test has now been supplanted by other tests such as FTA-ABS and TPHA which are quite as specific and much simpler. FTA-ABS test FTA-ABS test is as specific as the TPI test and is now accepted as the standard reference test. However it can be done only in suitably equipped laboratories, it is not available for routine testing. TPHA test TPHA test is just as specific as FTA-ABS and almost as sensitive except in the primary stage. It is also much simple and more economical. These advantages have made TPHA a standard confirmations test. TPPA test The TPHA test has been replaced by the serodia TP-PA test which is more sensitive for primary syphilis. TPHA is widely available in Europe but not used in U. S. A. From the discussion above, and from the table reproduced from Harrison, it seems, the TPPA is the most sensitive test far syphilis. - Both FTA-ABS and TP-PA are equally sensitive in secondary and latent syphilis. - TP-PA has higher sensitivity in Primary syphilis. - The problem is that enough datas for TP-PA are not available. Test Primary Secondary Latent Teiary * VDRL/RPR 78 (74-87) 100 95(88-100) 71 (37-94) * FTA-ABS 84 (70-100) 100 100 96 * TP-PA 89 100 100 NA Diagnosis of syphilis:- Treponema pallidum cannot be isolated by routine culture methods therefore detection is either by direct visualization of the organisms in material. from the lesion or indirectly by immunological/serological methods. Each stage of the treponematoses requires a paicular testing modality. Absolute diagnosis during the first and second stages can be made by direct examination under dark field microscopy of a specimen from primary chancre, the maculopapular rash, or the condyloma Tatum. Since the direct visualization of spirochetes is effective only during the active stages of primary and secondary syphilis, serologic tests were developed. Serological tests in syphilis are of two types - Non specific treponemal tests - Specific treponemal tests Nonspecific treponemal tests:? Infection with syphilis results in cellular damage and the release into the serum of a number of lipids including cardiolipin and lecithin. The body produces antibodies against these antigens. - Non specific treponemal tests detects the presence of these antibodies to lipoprotein material from damged cells and cardiolipin from treponemes and as a consequence are not specific for Treponema. (Reactivity in these tests indicates host tissue damage). - If the patient has these antibodies it is assumed that he or she has syphilis. These tests are used for screening of syphilis. - If these tests are positive presence of the disease should be confirmed by specific tests. The tests commonly employed are:? - Veneral disease Research laboratory test (VDRL TEST) - Rapid plasma Regain Test (RPR test) Why are these tests nonspeciic?? - These tests measure antibodies directed against cardiolipin antigen that results, from interaction of host tissues with treponema pallidum or spirochete itself. (They do not detect the antibodies against Treponena itself). - Cardiolipin is a phospholipid and it is possible that a similar substance present in the treponemal cell or released. from damage host cells damaged by the stimulate antibody production. - Assays for nonspecific antibody, because of their low cost and technical simplicity have routinely been used as screening test. for evidence of syphilis since these tests have relatively low specificity positive results are confinned by detection of specific anti Treponemal antibody. Antibody develops in 70% of patients within 2 weeks of developing chancre and in 100% of patients with secondary syphilis. The impoant point about nonspecific treponemal tests is that they can be used quantitatively:? - Quantitative result of these tests tends to correlate with disease activity thus they are very helpful. for screening. A four, fold or greater rise in the titre may be seen during the evolution of early syphilis. in secondary syphilis, test results are always positive and often at a high titre. The nonspecific treponemal tests should become nonreactive one year after successful therapy in primary syphilis and 2 years after successful therapy in late syphilis. - There fore these tests can be used to monitor response to treatment. -After successful treatment there would be sustained four fold decrease in antibody titre. - Similarly a four fold increase in titre following therapy suggests reinfection or relapse and necessitates reevaluation. Non specific Treponemal tests for syphilis VDRL Test The VDRL test is a non specific serological test for syphilis. It uses a mixture of cardiolipin, cholesterol and lecithin as antien. With the use of these antigens, IgG or 1gM antibodies present in the serum or C. S. F. (in case of neurosyphilis) are detected. This test can be used quantitatively and increase in VDRL titre with time can be used to confirm a diagnosis of syphilis. R. P. R. It is also a nonspecific test which uses cardiolipin as antigen. Treponemal specific tests While the nonspecific tests look for antilipoidal antibodies the specific treponemal tests look for antibodies against the spirochete itself The tests included in this category are:? - Indirect immunoflorescence treponemal antibody-absorption test (FTA-ABS) test. -Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) or microhemagglutination test (MHA-TP) - Treponema pallidum immnobilisation test (TPI). - Enzyme immune assay (ELISA). - TPPA test These tests are used to confirm a positive nontreponemal reaginic test. Treponema specific tests are not completely specific for syphilis because false positive reactions can occur with other spirochetal diseases (e. g., Yaws, pinta leptospirosis, rat bite fever, relapsing degfever, lyme disease). An impoant point about these tests is that they do not correlate with disease activity. - These test findings become positive soon after infection and typically remain positive for life despite adequate treatment.",

Then, culture the organism on an enrichment medium, namely ', Offler's serum. After that, use a selective plate known as tellurite agar which allows all Corynebacteria (including C. diphtheriae) to reduce tellurite to metallic tellurium producing brown colonies and, only in the case of C. diphtheriae, a black halo around the colonies allowing for easy differentation of the organism.",

Some microbes form substances called hemolysins that have the specific action of destroying red blood cells; beta-hemolytic streptococci are an example. Intravenous administration of a hypotonic solution or plain distilled water will cause the red cells to fill with fluid until their membranes rupture and the cells are destroyed. Wherever either in vitro or in vivo IgG or IgM antibodies are bound to red blood cell antigens in the presence of complement, the complement cascade is triggered the final products of which include enzymes that result in holes being 'punched' in the wall of the red blood cell, allowing hemoglobin to escape and which is observed as lysis. Snake venoms and ceain plant substances may cause hemolysis. A great variety of chemical agents can lead to destruction of erythrocytes if there is exposure to a sufficiently high concentration of the substance. These chemical hemolytics include copper.

Alpha hemolytic group of streptococci Alpha hemolytic streptococci may be pathogens such as streptococcus pneumonia or a pa of the normal. flora of the upper respiratory tract i. e., Viridans streptococci. Collectively conzmensal streptococci are often called viridians streptococci which refers to their ahemolytic propey. - Viridans is the Latin for \"green\" and most of the viridians streptococci are alpha hemolytic, Not quite logically this term also includes few streptococci (e. g., the salivarius and mutans groups of streptococci that induce neither a nor fi hemolysis). Moreover - In common usage this term excludes streptococcus pneumonia although this species is also ahemylytic. Streptococcus pneumonia is the major cause of community acquired bacterial pneumonia and the most frequent cause of otitis media and bacteremia in infacts and children. - Thus it is impoant to distinguish streptococcus pneumonia from other alpha hemolytic streptococci which are commensuls. Two tests are commonly employed for distinguishing streptococcus pneumonia from the viridians streptococcus i. e., - Optochin sensitivity test - Bile solubility test Optochin sensitivity test Optochin (or ethylhydrocupreine) is a chemical used for distinguishing streptococcus pneumonia from other a hemolytic streptococci. - Streptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to optochin i. e., it is lysed by optochin. - Other ahemolytic streptococci are resistant to (not killed by) optochin. Bacterias that are optochin sensitive will be inhibited to grow around optochin disc while the bacteria that are optochin resistant will be unaffected. Bile Solubility test Bile solubility test is used to distinguish streptococcus pneumoniae from other ahemolytic streptococci. - Bile will selectively lyse colonies of streptococcus pneumoniae while other streptococci are immune to bile's activity.",

This process is called \"reassoment\" of the virus. - Normally when a segmented virus infects a cell, the individual RNA segments enter the nucleus of the host. - There they are copied many times over to form RNA genomes, for new infectious virions. - The new RNA segments are expoed to the cytoplasm where they are assembled into new virus paicles which buds from the cell. If a cell is infected simultaneously with two different segmented viruses, the RNA of both the viruses are copied in the nucleus. These segmented viruses undergo a kind of \"gene swapping or exchange\" i. e., segments from viruses are interchanged or transferred to each other. - As a result new virus paicles emerge that contain RNA segments from both the viruses. - These new viruses are called \"reassoants\" and the process is called reassoment. Reassoment is an efficient process but is limited to the viruses with \"segmented genomes\". So far the only human viruses characterized with segmented genomes are RNA viruses e. g., ohomyxoviruses, reo viruses, arenaviruses, Bunya viruses. - In paicular reassoment is characteristic of \"influenza viruses\" whose genomes consists of eight distinct segment of RNA. - Reassoment is responsible for some of the major genetic shifts in the history of influenza virus which has lead to epidemics. Reassoment in Rotavirus Rotavirus is an impoant cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children. Rotavirus are segmented virus - Due to segmented nature of their genome rotavirus can exchange (reasso) genes during coinfection a features that ispredicted to generate new possibly more dangerous virus strains. - However the amount of gene reassoment occurring in nature is not known as very few Rotavirus genomes have been segmented. - In contrast to what was previously thought very few Rota viruses exchanged gene segments with each other: instead the genomic constillations of the viruses remained relatively stable.",

Hyperacute rejection occurs within minutes and the transplant must be immediately removed to prevent a severe systemic inflammatory response. Rapid agglutination of the blood occurs. This is a paicular risk in kidney transplants, and so a prospective cytotoxic crossmatch is performed prior to kidney transplantation to ensure that antibodies to the donor are not present. Hyperacute rejection is analogous to a blood transfusion reaction as it is a humoral-mediated immune response. For other organs, hyperacute rejection is prevented by transplanting only ABO-compatible grafts. Hyperacute rejection is not significant in liver allografts and cellular transplants because these tissues have remarkable regenerative abilities. Hyperacute rejection is the outcome of xenotransplanted organ in non-immunosuppressed recipients",

B: Enriched media A growth medium is considered differential if, when specific microbes are present, the medium or bacterial colonies themselves exhibit a color change that provides information about their identity. Blood agar (BAP) is a differential growth medium which is used to distinguish clinically significant bacteria from throat and sputum cultures. BAP contains 5% sheep blood. Ceain bacteria produce enzymes (hemolysins) that act on the red blood cells to lyse or break them down. Beta hemolysis means that the bacteria's hemolytic enzymes completely beak down the blood cells. The a-hemolysis pattern results in the media displaying clear halos around bacterial colonies. Alpha hemolysis (a-hemolysis) means that the bacterial enzymes only paially break down the blood cells. This results in the media showing a yellowish/greenish/brownish discoloration (like a bruise) around the colony, indicating incomplete hemolysis. Gamma hemolysis is essentially no hemolysis at all. The bacteria have no effect on the red blood cells, and there is no change to the color of the medium. Some of the terms for media are interchangeable. For example, the blood agar medium is an enriched medium but bacteria lysing red cells show a clearing around their colonies. Thus, it is an differential medium as well.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Enterohemorrhagic SCHERICHIA COLI At least six distinct \"pathotypes\" of intestinal pathogenic E. coli exist: Enteropathogenic E. coli l. Enteroadherent E. colil It causes diarrhoea in infants and children usually occuring as institutional out breaks. It does not produce enterotoxin, nor are they invasive. They adhere to the mucosa of small intestine and cause disruption of the brush border microvilli. These strains can be identified by their adhesion to HEP - 2 cells. Enterotoxigenic E. coli It causes traveller's diarrhoea [ETEC is the most common cause of traveller's diarrhea!. It produces enterotoxins. They can produce heat labile toxin (LT) or heat stable toxin or both. Toxin production alone may not lead to illness. The strain should first be able to adhere to intestinal mucosa. This adhesiveness is medicated by fimbrial or colonisation factor antigen (CFA). Enteroinvasive E. coli They themselves resemble shigella and their infection resembles shigellosis (remember: shiga like toxin is elaborated by enterohemorrhagic E. coli). They produce mild diarrhoea to frank dysentry and occur in adult as well as in children. They have been termed enteroinvasive because they have the capacity to invade intestinal epithelial cells in vivo and penetrate He. La or HEP - 2 cells in tissue culture. This ability of penetration is plasmid determined which codes for outer membrane antigens called the 'virulence marker antigen' (VMA). The detection of plasmid can be diagnostic. For laboratory diagnosis of EIEC, the sereny test used to be employed. These strains are non motile, do not ferment lactose or ferment it late with acid without producing any gas. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli or verotoxigenic E. coli These strains produce verocytotoxin (VT) or shiga like toxin (SLT) They can cause mild diarrhoea to fatal hemorrhagic colitis. Shiga like toxin belongs to class ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs). It inhibits protein synthesis by inhibiting ribosomal function. This toxin also acts on vascular endothelium to promote the synthesis of coagulation factor VIII, v. WF -* Platelet aggregation. They can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome paicularly in young children and the elderly. 0 157: H 7 is the most prominent serotype of EHEC, associated with HUS, but 06, 026, 055, 091, 0103, 0111, 0113 and OX3 have also been associated with this syndrome. The primary target for VT is vascular endothelium. The typical EHEC is serotype 0157: H7 which does not ferement sorbital unlike majority of E. coli (but Harrison writes that few species of this serotype can ferment sorbital). Some other serotype like 026: H1 also belongs to this group. Laboratory diagnosis of VIEC diarrhea is established by demonstration of the bacilli or VT in feces directly or in culture.",

It produced lytic infection in fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes but could not be established in permanent cell lines. In 1984, Robe Gallo and colleagues from the National Institute of Health, USA, repoed isolation of a retrovirus from AIDS patients and called it 'human T-cell lymphotropic virus-HI (HTLV-I11). Other similar isolates were repoed from AIDS cases under different names. To resolve this nomenclatural confusion, the International Committee on Virus Nomenclature in 1986 decided on the generic name 'human immunodeficiency virus' (HIV) for these viruses. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) The first indication of a new syndrome came in the summer of 1981, with repos from New York and Loss Angeles (USA) of a sudden unexplained outbreak of two very rare diseases-Kaposi's sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (now pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia) in young adults who were homosexuals or addicted to injected narcotics. They appeared to have lost their immune competence, rendering them vulnerable to overwhelming and fatal infections with relatively avirulent micro-organisms, as well as to lymphoid and other malignancies. This condition was given the name 'acquired immune deficiency syndrome' (AIDS). In 1983, Luc Montagnier and colleagues from the Pasteur Institute, Paris, isolated a retrovirus from a West African patient with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, which is a manifestation of AIDS, and called it lymphadenopathy associated virus' (LAV). It produced lyric infection in fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes but could not be established in permanent cell lines. In 1984, Robe Gallo and colleagues from the National Institute of Health, USA, repoed isolation of a retrovirus from AIDS patients and called it 'human T-cell lymphotropic virus-DI (HTLV-III). Other similar isolates were repoed from AIDS cases under different names. To resolve this nomenclatural confusion, the International Committee on Virus Nomenclature in 1986 decided on the generic name 'human immunodeficiency virus' (HIV) for these viruses.",

        "exp": "Ans. (b) 1 Fc and 2 Fab Antibody Fragmentation The performances of ceain immunoassay procedures are enhanced by using antibody fragments, such as Fab and F(a13'),. Antibody fragmentation is accomplished using reducing agents and proteases that digest or cleave ceain poions of the immunoglobulin protein structure. Antibody fragments of primary interest are: Antigen-binding fragments such as Fab and b. Class-defining fragments such as Fc that do not bind antigen. Technique of antibody fragmentation Papain digestion: A nonspecific, thiol-endopeptidase defragment IgG molecules into three fragments of similar size: two Fab fragment and one Fc fragment. Pepsin digestion: A nonspecific endopeptidase produces one F(ab')2 fragment and numerous small peptides of the Fc poion. The resulting F(ab')2 fragment is composed of two disulfide-connected Fab units. Ficin digestion A thiol protease that can digest mouse monoclonal Ig. G1 into either F(ab')2 or Fab fragments, depending on the concentration of cysteine included. Types of antibody fragments F(ab')2 fragments: F(ab')2 (110, 000 daltons) fragments contain two antigen-binding regions joined at the hinge through disulfides. This fragment is void of most, but not all, of the Fc region. Fab' fragments: Fab' (55, 000 daltons) fragments can be formed by the reduction of F(ab')2 fragments. The Fab' fragment contains a free sulfhydryl group that may be alkylated or utilized in conjugation with an enzyme, toxin or other protein of interest. Fab' is derived from F(ab')2. Fab fragments: Fab (50, 000 daltons) is a monovalent fragment that is produced from IgG and IgM, consisting of the VH, CH1 and VL, CL regions, linked by an intramolecular disulfide bond. Fv fragments: Fv (25, 000 daltons) is the smallest fragment produced from IgG and IgM that contains a complete antigen-binding site. Fv fragments have the same binding propeies and similar three-dimensional binding characteristics as Fab. Fc fragments: Fc (50, 000 daltons) fragments contain the CH2 and CH3 region and pa of the hinge region held together by one or more disulfides and noncovalent interactions. Fc and Fc5jt fragments are produced from fragmentation of IgG and IgM, respectively. The term Fc is derived from the ability of these antibody fragments to crystallize. The Fc fragment cannot bind antigen, but it is responsible for the effector functions of antibodies, such as complement fixation.",

Which of the following is the genus of the bacterium most likely to be isolated from this patient's sputum?",
        "exp": "The clinical and radiologic characteristics of this patient's condition are consistent with lobar pneumonia, a respiratory infection that, in its classic presentation, involves a single pulmonary lobe. In 90% to 95% of cases, the etiologic agent is Streptococcus pneumoniae (AKA pneumococcus), an alpha-hemolytic streptococcus present in the throat of 40% to 70% of healthy individuals. A small minority of cases of lobar pneumonia are due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococci, streptococci other than pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas, and Proteus. Penicillin is the drug of choice for pneumococcal pneumonia, but sputum cultures are necessary to identify the infectious agent and determine its antibiotic sensitivity. S. pneumoniae is a major cause of purulent meningitis in the elderly. Other alpha-hemolytic streptococci (viridans streptococci) cause subacute endocarditis in patients with previously altered cardiac valves. Streptococcus mutans and other oral streptococci have been associated with dental caries. Bacteria belonging to the genera Haemophilus and Klebsiella cause respiratory infections; however, in immunocompetent individuals, these bacterial infections usually result in bronchopneumonia, which leads to multilobar, and often bilateral, pulmonary involvement. Beta-hemolytic streptococci cause countless infections in humans. Recall that classification of beta;-hemolytic streptococci is based on their surface antigens known as Lancefield antigens. Human diseases caused by this group of bacteria include: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A): pharyngitis, scarlet fever, erysipelas, impetigo, rheumatic fever, and glomerulonephritis. Streptococcus agalactiae (group B): neonatal sepsis and urinary infections - Enterococcus faecalis (group D): endocarditis and urinary infections. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 15.

        "question": "Stage of falciparum not seen in peripheral blood smear: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Schizont P. falciparum differs from the other forms of malarial parasites in that developing erythrocytic schizonts aggregate in the capillaries of the brain and other internal organs, so that only young ring forms are found in peripheral blood Life cycle of all Plasmodium species Infection in humans begins with the bite of an infected female Anopheline mosquito. Sporozoites are the infective form of the parasite, present in the salivary glands of the female anopheles mosquito. Sporozoites released from the salivary glands of the mosquito enter the bloodstream during feeding, quickly invading liver cells (hepatocytes). Sporozoites are cleared from the circulation within 30 minutes. During the next 14 days in the case of P. falciparum, the liver-stage parasites differentiate and undergo asexual multiplication resulting in tens of thousands of merozoites which burst from the hepatoctye. Individual merozoites invade red blood cells (erythrocytes) and undergo an additional round of multiplication producing 12-16 merozoites within a schizont. The length of this erythrocytic stage of the parasite life cycle depends on the parasite species: - Irregular cycle for P. falciparum, - 48 hours for P. vivax, and P. ovale and - 72 hours for P. malariae. The clinical manifestations of malaria, fever and chills, are associated with the synchronous rupture of the infected erythrocyte. The released merozoites go on to invade additional erythrocytes. Not all of the merozoites divide into schizonts, some differentiate into sexual forms, male and female gametocytes. These gametocytes are taken up by a female anophylean mosquito during a blood meal. Within the mosquito midgut, the male gametocyte undergoes a rapid nuclear division, producing 8 flagellated microgametes which feilize the female macrogamete. The resulting ookinete traverses the mosquito gut wall and encysts on the exterior of the gut wall as a oocyst. Soon the oocyst ruptures, releasing hundreds of sporozoites into the mosquito body cavity where they eventually migrate to the mosquito salivary gland. To diagnose malaria and determine which species of Plasmodium is causing the infection, blood film is examined. Each species has distinctive physical characteristics that are apparent under a microscope. In P. falciparum, only early (ring-form) trophozoites and gametocytes are seen in the peripheral blood. It is unusual to see mature trophozoites or schizonts in peripheral blood smears as these are usually sequestered in the tissues. The parasitised erythrocytes are not enlarged, and it is common to see cells with more than one parasite within them (multiply parasitised erythrocytes). On occasion, faint comma-shaped red dots called \"Maurer's dots\" are seen on the red cell surface. The comma-shaped dots can also appear as pear-shaped blotches. Plasmodium falciparum causes severe malaria a distinctive propey not shared by any other human malaria, that of sequestration. Within the 48-hour asexual blood stage cycle, the mature forms change the surface propeies of infected red blood cells causing them to stick to blood vessels (a process called cytoadherence). This leads to obstruction of the microcirculation and results in dysfunction of multiple organs, typically the brain in cerebral malaria.",

P. vivax and P. ovale produce a latent form (hypnozoite) in the liver. This form is the cause of relapses seen with vivax and ovale malaria. The sexual cycle begins in the human red blood cells when some merozoites develop into male and others into female gametocytes. The gametocyte-containing red blood cells are ingested by the female Anopheles mosquito. Note Hence infective form for human is Sporozoites and infective form for mosquito is Gametocytes.

It may be localised as tonsillitis as in older children and adults or it may involve the pharynx more diffusely (pharyngitis) as in younger children. Otitis media. Mastoiditis. Quincy. Ludwig's angina. Suppurative adenitis. Pneumonia as a complication of influenza or other respiratory viral disease. 2) Skin and soft tissue infections. Erysipelas - Diffuse infection involving the superficial lymphatics. - Occurs in older patients.. Impetigo - Superficial infection of skin (Pyoderma)- Occurs in young patients - Usually involves face and leg.. Cellulitis. Lymphangitis 3) Deep soft tissue infections. Necrotizing fascitis (hemolytic streptococcal gangrene) Myositis - (Most common organism causing myositis is S. aureus) 4) Abscesses - in brain, lungs, liver, and kidney. 5) Scarlet fever. Consists of pharyngitis, accompanied by a characteristic rash.. Caused by production of erythrogenic toxin. 6) Puerperal sepsis. More often caused by group B streptococci. 7) Bacteremia 8) Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome Str. Pyogenes strains M type 1 and 3 forming pyrogenic exotoxin A are responsible.. These strains also known as flesh eating bacteria'. 9) Nonsuppurative complications. Acute Rheumatic fever - Follows persistent or repeated streptococcal throat infections (not skin infection).. Glomerulonephritis - May occur after throat or skin infection perhaps, in the tropics skin infections are more impoant than throat infections.",

The disease in question is poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, as evidenced by the smoky urine, hypertension, edema, and red blood cell casts in the urine sediment. The history of the prior sore throat is a tip-off that this is a nonsuppurative sequelae of an infection due to Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta;-hemolytic Streptococci). You must remember the features of S. pyogenes. S. pyogenes can be differentiated from Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans Streptococci by its hemolytic pattern; it is beta-hemolytic, while the others are alpha-hemolytic. It can be distinguished from the other beta-hemolytic Streptococci by its sensitivity to the a ntibiotic bacitracin. Other impoant things to remember about S. pyogenes are its many virulence factors, including M protein, antiphagocytic capsule, hyaluronidase, streptolysins O and S, and erythrogenic toxins. 2nd option is incorrect because Streptococci are catalase negative, in contrast to Staphylococci, which are catalase positive. 3rd option is incorrect because S. pyogenes is coagulase negative. (In fact, a coagulase test should NOT be done on a catalase-negative organism.) The coagulase test is an impoant means of differentiating Staphylococcus aureus, which are coagulase positive, from all other species of Staphylococcus, which are coagulase negative. Ref: Ray C.

Approximately 80% of all repoed cases of Travellers' Diarrhoea are due to bacterial pathogens. The most common causes in adults are said to be Campylobacter, enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and Shigella. ETEC infection E. coli bacteria which produce enterotoxins, ETEC, are the single most common cause of Traveller's Diarrhoea, responsible for an estimated one-half of all diarrhoeal episodes in travellers to high risk regions. ETEC infection leads to profuse, watery diarrhoea, which although usually self limiting can be very uncomfoable and disruptive to normal activities. One of the major ETEC toxins that cause the intestinal fluid imbalance leading to watery diarrhoea is similar in structure and function to the cholera toxin. Indeed, ETEC infections can cause disease of comparable severity to cholera. Campylobacter jejuni infection Approximately one-fouh of Travellers' Diarrhoea cases are caused by infection by Campylobacter jejuni. This pathogen is often responsible for more serious symptoms of the disease. Infection can result in mild diarrhoea to severe dysentery, frequently associated with fever, abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting. Most significantly, people recovering from Campylobacter jejuni infections can be at risk for developing long lasting conditions, including reactive ahritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. The disease may leave patients severely impaired.",

The Xpe MTB/RIF purifies and concentrates Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli from sputum samples, isolates genomic material form the captured bacteria by sonication and subsequently amplifies the genomic DNA by PCR. The process identifies all the clinically relevant rifampicin resistance inducing mutations in the RNA polymerase beta (rpoB) gene in the mycobacterium tuberculosis genome in a real time format using fluorescent probes called molecular beacons.

Domestic animals, especially pigs, are the main reservoir for the organism, and humans are infected after ingesting the cysts in food or water contaminated with animal or human feces. The trophozoites excyst in the small intestine, travel to the colon, and, by burrowing into the wall, cause an ulcer similar to that of Entamoeba histolytica. However, unlike the case with E. histolytica, extraintestinal lesions do not occur. Most infected individuals are asymptomatic. Diagnosis is made by finding large ciliated trophozoites or large cysts with a characteristic V-shaped nucleus in the stool. There are no serologic tests. The treatment of choice is tetracycline. Prevention consists of avoiding contamination of food and water by domestic animal feces. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 53. Minor Protozoan Pathogens. In W.

The reaction may involve skin (uicaria and eczema), eyes (conjunctivitis), nasopharynx (rhinorrhea, rhinitis), bronchopulmonary tissues (asthma) and gastrointestinal tract (gastroenteritis). The reaction usually takes 15 - 30 minutes from the time of exposure to the antigen, although sometimes it may have a delayed onset (10 - 12 hours). For example allergic asthma, hay fever etc. Immediate hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE. Type II hypersensitivity is also known as cytotoxic hypersensitivity and may affect a variety of organs and tissues. The antigens are normally endogenous, although exogenous chemicals (haptens) which can attach to cell membranes can also lead to type II hypersensitivity. Drug-induced hemolytic anemia, granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia are such examples. Phagocytes and K cells may also play a role. The reaction time is minutes to hours. Type II hypersensitivity is primarily mediated by antibodies of the IgM or IgG classes and complement. Example include erythroblastosis fetalis, Goodpasture's nephritis Type III hypersensitivity is also known as immune complex hypersensitivity. The reaction may be general (e. g., serum sickness) or may involve individual organs including skin (e. g., systemic lupus erythematosus, Ahus reaction), kidneys (e. g., lupus nephritis), lungs (e. g., aspergillosis), blood vessels (e. g., polyaeritis), joints (e. g., rheumatoid ahritis) or other organs. This reaction may be the pathogenic mechanism of diseases caused by many microorganisms. Examples include SLE, farmer's lung disease Type IV hypersensitivity is also known as cell mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity. The classical example of this hypersensitivity is tuberculin (Montoux) reaction which peaks 48 hours after the injection of antigen (PPD or old tuberculin). The lesion is characterized by induration and erythema. Example includes tuberculin test, poison ivy, granuloma",

Hemophilus ducreyi is a pleomorphic gram negative bacillus that causes chancroid, painful genital ulcers and lymphadenitis. It is grown best from scrapings of the ulcer base on chocolate agar containing 1% Iso. VitaleX and vancomycin. A painful erythematous papule appears at the site of infection after an incubation period of 4 to 10 days. One to two days later, the lesion becomes eroded, ulcerated, and often pustular. The ulcers are usually 1 to 2 cm in diameter with sharp, undermined margins and are very painful. The friable base of the ulcer is covered with yellow-gray necrotic exudates. Multiple lesions are present in up to 50% of patients and \"kissing lesions\" are frequent. Painful inguinal lymphadenopathy develops 1 to 2 weeks after primary infection. It is treated with intramuscular ceftriaxone, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or oral erythromycin often results in healing in 2 weeks.

Clues included the patient population (HIV positive), geographic area (Mississippi and Missouri river beds), and diagnostic form (encapsulated yeast). Cryptococcus is a monomorphic fungus, unlike many of the classic pathogens within the fungal group, so the encapsulated yeast form would be found both in clinical specimens and in the environment as the infectious form. Broad-based, budding yeasts would be the forms expected to be found in clinical specimens (not environmental forms) from patients infected with Blastomyces dermatitidis, which is far more likely to present with skin and bone lesions than with meningitis. Budding yeasts in a \"pilot's wheel\" arrangement would be the form expected to be found in clinical specimens (not environmental forms) from patients infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which is limited in geographic region to Central and South America and typically presents as a primary pulmonary disease.

Because the organisms possess pili that may mediate adherence to respiratory tract epithelial cells, conditions that impair mucociliary clearance, including cigarette smoking, lung disease, or alcoholism, predispose to Legionnaires' disease. Cell-mediated immunity is the primary mechanism of host defense against Legionella, as it is against other intracellular pathogens. Thus Legionnaires' disease is more common and its manifestations are more severe among patients with depressed cell-mediated immunity Alveolar macrophages readily phagocytose Legionella.

Colitis is thought to result from overgrowth of this organism after depletion of the normal commensal flora of the gut with the use of antibiotics. Pathogenic changes associated with C difficile result from production of toxin A and B. It can be diagnosed by the presence of these toxins in the stool. It can also be diagnosed endoscopically by detecting the presence of characteristic ulcers, plaques and pseudomembranes. Patients with mild disease are treated with metronidazole. Oral vancomycin is used as second line agent in patients allergic to metronidazole or in patients with recurrent disease. Ref: Bullard Dunn K. M., Rothenberger D. A. (2010). Chapter 29.

Complete pasteurization will inactivate the enzyme to below levels which are detectable by conventional methods. Because the heat stability of ALP is greater than that of pathogens which may be present in milk, the enzyme serves as an indicator of product safety. The classic test for the determination of alkaline phosphatase activity is the Scharer Rapid Phosphatase Test. Turbidity test checks sterilisation of milk and distinguishes between pasteurized and sterilised milk. Methylene blue reduction test is done for determining ble bacterial count in the milk.
