Nonfeline stage In this stage tissue cysts (containg bradyzoites) or sporulated oocysts are ingested by intermediate hosts (Human, mouse, sheep or pig). The cyst is rapidly digested by the acidic-pH gastric secretion releasing bradyzoites or sporozoites. These bradyzoites or sporozoites enter the small - intestinal epithelium and tranform into rapidly dividing tachyzoites (endozoites). The tachyzoites can infect and replicate in all mammalian cells except red blood cells. Tissue cysts containing many bradyzoite develop 7-10 days after systemic tachyzoite infection. These tissue cysts occur in a variety of host organs but persist principally within the CNS and muscle. Feline stage (sexual stage) This stage takes place in the definitive host (cat) This cycle is associated with formation of oocysts, which are excreted in cat feces.

There may be abdominal pain, bloating, nausea & vomiting, flatulence and flatus. The mechanisms by which Giardia causes alteration in small bowel function are largely unknown. Although trophozoites adhere to the epithelium, they do not cause invasive or locally destructive alterations. Fever, the presence of blood or mucus in the stools suggest a different diagnosis as all these are absent in giardiasis. Giardia may also cause traveller's diarrhea. Predisposing conditions to giardiasis are agammaglobulinemia, common variable immunodeficiency, and selective IgA-deficiency. Diagnosis and treatment The gold - standard for diagnosis of giardiasis is microscopic demonstration of the trophozoite, cyst or both in faeces. Duodenal aspirate or jejunal biopsy may be required for diagnosis.

Borrelia burgdorferi is transmitted to humans the bite of ixodes tick vector. Borrelia burgdorferi is inoculated in the skin, where local replication takes place locally and outward migration in the dermis occurs. - Days to week after the tick bite, hematogenous dissemination to secondary sites (like joints, hea eye, nervous system) takes place. If untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of anti-Borrelia burgodorferi antibodies by the immune system. The following mechanisms have been described - i) Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. - This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish the infect on. ii) Once inside the body, Borrelia burgdorferi become; a stealth invader i. e., it changes shape. - In the tick and mice which host the bacterium through most of its life cycle, the bacterium has a thick cell wall and spiral shape. If it maintains its thick cell wall and its spiral shape, immune system can control infection. However, in the human body, it can shed its cell wall and can take a different shape. When under attack from immune system, it simply changes shape so it is not recognized. iii) Borrelia burgdorferi produces antigenic variation in a \"cell surface lipoprotein VIsE\", during the course of infection - The VIsE system presents a challenge to immune system because after an immune response is generated to one version of VISE protein, a different version is quickly produced. By using this type of antigenic variation, B. burgdorferi can escape the adaptive immune system. Lyme meningitis Meningitis (meningeal involvement) is the most common neurological event that occurs in the setting of early lyme dissemination. - In this clinical setting CSF is always abnormal and shows: 1) Pleocytosis with predominantly lymphocytosisQ (not polymorphonuclear leukocytosis). 2) Increased protein 3) Glucose content is usually normal, but it. falls below the serum concentration in 20% of patients. Immunoglobulin abnormalities are common in the CSF of patients with lyme meningitis. - Specific IgM, IgG or IgA antibody against B. burgdorferi appears in CSF and indicates intrathecal antibody synthesis.",

Collect specimen with as little skin contamination as possible to ensure that the sample collected represents the infected site. Utilize appropriate collection devices. Use sterile equipment and aseptic technique to collect specimens to prevent introduction of microorganisms during invasive procedures. Clearly label the specimen container with patient's name, hospital number or other identifying number (i. e. bih date, requisition number), date and time of collection. Collect an adequate amount of specimen. Inadequate amounts of specimen may yield false-negative results. If a specimen is collected through intact skin, cleanse the skin first. For example, use 70% alcohol followed by iodine solution (1 to 2% tincture of iodine or 10% solution of povidone iodine). Collect fluid specimens in sturdy, sterile, screw cap, leak proof containers with lids that do not create an aerosol when opened.

Streptococcus agalactiae (group B strep) and Escherichia coli (not an answer choice) are the most common causes in neonates up to 1 month of age. The next most reasonable response would have been Listeria monocytogenes, another, though less common, cause of neonatal meningitis. Most cases of meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae occur in children between 6 months and 6 years of age, 90% of which result from the capsular type b strain. It has become much less prevalent since the H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine has been routinely administered to infants. Neisseria meningitidis is the most common cause of epidemic meningitis. The two organisms most often associated with sporadic cases are Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae (the most common cause in adults over 30). Ref: Ray C. G., Ryan K. J. (2010).

The C1-complex is composed of 1 molecule of Clq, 2 molecules of C1r and 2 molecules of Cls, or C1qr2s2. This occurs when Clq binds to IgM or IgG complexed with antigens. A single IgM can initiate the pathway, while multiple Ig. Gs are needed. This also occurs when Clq binds directly to the surface of the pathogen. Such binding leads to conformational changes in the C1q molecule, which leads to the activation of two Clr molecules. C1r is a serine protease. They then cleave Cls (another serine protease). The C1r2s2 component now splits C4 and then C2, producing C4a, C4b, C2a, and C2b. C4b and C2b bind to form the classical pathway C3-convease (C4b2b complex), which promotes cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b; C3b later joins with C4b2b (the C3 convease) to make C5 convease (C4b2b3b complex).

The B subunit binds to a ganglioside receptor on the surface of the enterocyte. The A subunit is inseed into the cytosol, where it catalyzes the addition of ADP-ribose to the Gs protein. This locks the Gs protein in the \"on\" position, which causes the persistent stimulation of adenylate cyclase. The resulting overproduction of cyclic AMP activates cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, an enzyme that phosphorylates ion transpoers in the cell membrane, resulting in the loss of water and ions from the cell. The watery efflux enters the lumen of the gut, resulting in a massive watery diarrhea that contains neither neutrophils nor red blood cells. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 18.

        "exp": "The antibiotic propey of vancomycin depends upon its ability to bind D-ala-D-ala, which is vital in the synthesis of peptidoglycan peptide bridges. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci instead utilize D-lactic acid in their peptide bonds, and thus are resistant to the action of vancomycin. Enzymatic deactivation of antibiotics is a common mode of resistance to aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, and sulfonamides. The most common chemical modifications are acetylation, adenylation, and phosphorylation. Penicillin that has penetrated the cell membrane is kept in place by binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Penicillin resistance may be conferred through altered PBP affinity or number. Vancomycin resistance does not depend on PBPs. beta-lactamase is a bacterial enzyme that inactivates some of the penicillins and cephalosporins, but has no activity on vancomycin. Ref: Mac.

Standard agglutination test identifies mainly the IgM antibodies, which is usually positive in acute infection but may be only weakly positive or even negative in chronic cases. Standard agglutination test is therefore useful in diagnosing acute brucellosis, not chronic brucellosis. Brucellosis is a bacterial zoonosis transmitted directly or indirectly to humans from infected animals, predominantly domesticated ruminants and swine. The disease is known as undulant fever because of its remittent character. Although brucellosis commonly presents as an acute febrile illness, its clinical manifestations vary widely, and definitive signs indicative of the disease is not present.

        "exp": "Herpes simplex is an enveloped, linear DNA virus that is a very common infectious agent; most adults will have anti-Herpes simplex antibodies in their serum, although many may not have ever had any clinical signs of disease. The hallmark of this disease is painful skin vesicles often called \"cold\" sores, or \"fever\" blisters to denote the precipitating event that preceded the appearance of the lesions. The virus has a propensity to become latent in the host, finding safe refuge in nervous tissue. Activation of the infection occurs following mild trauma (e. g., a visit to the dentist), hormonal changes (e. g., menses), and immunosuppression (e. g., following organ transplantation). Other, more serious, manifestations of disease include encephalitis, pneumonia, and hepatitis; these are paicularly likely to be seen in immunodeficient patients such as those with AIDS. Adenoviruses are naked, linear, double-stranded DNA viruses that cause acute, usually self-limiting, influenza-like illnesses occurring in winter. The symptoms include pharyngitis, fever, cough, and general malaise. Epidemic pharyngoconjunctivitis and pneumonia can occur in closed populations such as military installations. Coxsackie viruses are naked, single-stranded, polycistronic viruses with an RNA genome. They are divided into groups A and B based on their virulence in suckling mice. Coxsackie A group causes generalized myositis and flaccid paralysis, which is rapidly fatal to infant mice, whereas group B produces less severe lesions of the hea, pancreas, and central nervous system. In man, Coxsackie A causes herpangina and hand-foot-and-mouth disease, while Coxsackie B is seen in patients with pleurodynia, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Both groups cause upper respiratory infections, febrile rashes, and meningitis. Herpes zoster, the varicella virus, is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that is a very common infectious agent in children. Chickenpox is a mild, self-limiting illness in children that is evidenced as a fever followed by a macular rash that progresses to papules, then vesicles of the skin and mucous membranes. Shingles is a recurrence of a previously latent varicella infection in which the virus has taken refuge in sensory ganglia of spinal or cranial nerves. Various factors that decrease the immune status of the patient contribute to the exacerbation of the infection. Severe dermatomal pain occurs with a vesicular eruption, fever, and malaise.

SSPE appears to be due to a combination of persistent, possibly abnormal measles virus and to autoimmune damage caused by antibodies directed against the virus. Many patients developing SSPE have had measles at 2 years of age or younger; there is typically a six-year interval between measles infection and symptom development. A small propoion of cases have followed vaccination with live measles virus. Unfounately, no effective therapy has been developed, although some experimental work with drugs such as isoprinosine shows some promise.

        "exp": "Ans. B i. e. Widal test Widal test It is a presumptive serological test for enteric fever or undulant fever whereby bacteria causing typhoid fever are mixed with serum containing specific antibodies obtained from an infected individual. In case of Salmonella infections, it is a demonstration of the presence of 0-soma false-positive result. Test results need to be interpreted carefully in the light of past history of enteric fever, typhoid vaccination, and the general level of antibodies in the populations in endemic areas of the world. As with all serological tests, the rise in antibody levels needed to perform the diagnosis takes 7-14 days, which limits it applicability in early diagnosis. Other means of diagnosing Salmonella typhi (and paratyphi) include cultures of blood, urine and faeces. These organisms produce H2S from thiosulfate and can be easily identified on differential media such as Bismuth sulfite agar. Often 2-mercaptoethanol is added to the Widal test. This agent more easily denatures the IgM class of antibodies, so if a decrease in the titer is seen after using this agent, it means that the contribution of IgM has been removed leaving the IgG component. This differentiation of antibody classes is impoant; as it allows for the distinction of a recent (IgM) from an old infection (IgG). The Widal test is positive if TO antigen titer is more than 1: 160 in an active infection, or if TH antigen titer is more than 1: 160 in past infection or in immunized persons. A single Widal test is of little clinical relevance due to the number of cross reacting infections, including malaria. If no other tests (either bacteriologic culture or more specific serology) are available, a fourfold increase in the titer (e. g., from 1: 40 to 1: 160) in the course of the infection, or a conversion from an IgM reaction to an IgG reaction of at least the same titer, would be consistent with a typhoid infection.",

        "exp": "Campylobacter jejuni is a pathogen causing an invasive enteric infection associated with ingestion of raw or undercooked food products, or through direct contact with infected animals. Ingestion of contaminated poultry that has not been sufficiently cooked is the most common means of acquiring the infection. The patients typically have bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. The presence of fecal leukocytes indicates an invasive infection. The organism is a gram negative rod with a curved \"comma-shape\" or \"S-shape. \" Enterotoxigenic E. coli causes the classic traveler's diarrhea. The infection is non-invasive and is acquired the fecal-oral route through consumption of unbottled water or uncooked vegetables. The major manifestation is a copious outpouring of fluid from the GI tract presenting as explosive diarrhea. This is due to the action of one of two types of enterotoxins on the GI tract mucosa. Shigella sonnei produces a syndrome very similar to C. jejuni. However, the organism appears as a gram-negative rod on Gram's stain. It does not have a comma shape. Transmission is from person to person the fecal-oral route. Infection requires a low infective dose since the organism is fairly resistant to gastric acidity. Staphylococcus aureus produces food poisoning due to the ingestion of a pre-formed enterotoxin. The organism is present in food that is high in salt content such as potato salad, custard, milk shakes, and mayonnaise. The patient presents with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, followed by diarrhea beginning 1-6 hours after ingestion of the enterotoxin. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013). Chapter 17.

Fever is usually between 39degc and 40degc temperature returns to normal after 5-6 days or subside on about the 3rd day and rise again after 5-8 days after onset (saddle back fever). Rashes appear in 80% of cases during remission or during second febrile phase. The rash lasts for 2 hours to several days and may be followed by desquamation. B) Dengue Hemorrhagic fever (DHF)- It is a severe form of dengue fever caused by infection with more than one dengue virus. The severe illness is thought to be due to double infection with more than one dengue virus. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is believed to result from reinfection with a virus of different serotype ( due to enhancing antibodies) DHF usally occurs after sequential infection with any two of the four serotypes of dengue virus. Sequence of infection may be impoant; serotype 1 followed by serotype2 is more dangerous than serotype 4 followed by serotype 2.",

It is found typically in alcoholic males over 40 years of age with underlying diabetes or obstructive lung disease. Klebsiella pneumoniae mimics Streptococcus pneumoniae as a pulmonary pathogen except that Klebsiella has a greater tendency to progress to lung abscess and empyema. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is usually associated with patients on ventilators, paicularly in intensive care units. Immunocompetent patients usually have bilateral bronchopneumonia without cavitary lesions. Aificial ventilation is classically associated with P. aeruginosa infection. The organism thrives in a wet environment such as respirators, cleaning solutions, disinfectants, sinks, vegetables, flowers, endoscopes, and physiotherapy pools. P. aeruginosa is a very impoant pathogen. Mucoid strains of this organism infect the airways in patients with cystic fibrosis, leading to acute exacerbations and chronic progression of lung damage. Both organisms cause disease in association with diabetes. Klebsiella pneumoniae produces pulmonary disease and P. aeruginosa causes necrotic skin ulcers in diabetics. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013).

D: All of the above Four main types of clinical syndromes are caused by E. coli: Urinary tract infection, diarrhea, pyogenic infections and septicemia Escherichia coli E. coli and related bacteria constitute about 0. 1% of gut flora and fecal-oral transmission is the major route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time, which makes them ideal indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination. E. coli is Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic and non-sporulating. Cells are typically rod-shaped, and are about 2. 0 micrometers (pm) long and 0. 5 pm in diameter, with a cell volume of 0. 6 - 0. 7 (pm)3. E. coli uses mixed-acid fermentation in anaerobic conditions, producing lactate, succinate, ethanol, acetate and carbon dioxide. Optimal growth of E. coli occurs at 37degC (98. 6degF) Strains that possess flagella can swim and are motile. The flagella have a peritrichous arrangement. E. coli and related bacteria possess the ability to transfer DNA bacterial conjugation, transduction or transformation, which allows genetic material to spread horizontally through an existing population. This process led to the spread of the gene encoding shiga toxin from Shigella to E. coli 0157: H7, carried by a bacteriophage Virulent strains of E. coli can cause gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, and neonatal meningitis. In rarer cases, virulent strains are also responsible for haemolytic-uremic syndrome, peritonitis, mastitis, septicaemia and Gram-negative pneumonia.",

The incidence of these lymphomas is 1% to 2% after renal transplantations and 5% to 9% after hea-lung transplantations. Most of the patients presents with persistent fever, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. EBV is known to cause infectious mononucleosis, burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and in AIDS patients its known to cause hairy leukoplakia of tongue, interstitial lymphocytic pneumonia and lymphoma. In Sub saharan africa Burkitt lymphoma is the most common malignancy in young children. It is thought to result from an early EBV infection that produces a large pool of infected B lymphocytes. It can be diagnosed by presence of increased IgA antibody levels to both VCA and early EBV antigens. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is endemic in Southern China, where it is responsible for 25% of moality from cancer. Ref: Ray C. G., Ryan K. J. (2010). Chapter 14. Herpesviruses. In C. G. Ray, K. J.

        "exp": "Ans. D: Opsonization Phagocytosis is largely responsible for depletion of cells coated with antibodies Cells opsonized by the IgG antibodies are recognized by phagocyte Fc receptors, which are specific for the Fc poions of some IgG subclasses Agglutination When a paiculate antigen is mixed with its antibody in the presence of electrolytes at a suitable temperature and pH, the paicles are clumped or agglutinated Transduction Transfer of a poion of the DNA from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage Conjugation It is. a process by whereby a 'male' or 'donor' bacterium 'mates' or makes a physical contact with a 'female' or 'recipient' bacterium and transfers genetic element into it Opsonization It is the process by which a pathogen is marked for ingestion and destruction by a phagocyte. Opsonization involves the binding of an opsonin, e. g., antibody, to a receptor on the pathogen's cell membrane. After opsonin binds to the membrane, phagocytes are attracted to the pathogen. The Fab poion of the antibody binds to the antigen, whereas the Fc poion of the antibody binds to an Fc receptor on the phagocyte, facilitating phagocytosis. The receptor-opsin complex can also create byproducts like C3b and C4b which are impoant components of the complement system. These components are deposited on the cell surface of the pathogen and aid in its destruction. The cell can also be destroyed by a process called antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, in which the pathogen does not need to be phagocytosed to be destroyed. During this process, the pathogen is opsonized and bound with the antibody IgG its Fab domain. Then the antibody binds an immune effector cell its Fc domain and this binding triggers a release of lysis products from the bound immune effector cell (monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and natural killer cells). This process can cause inflammation of surrounding tissues and damage to healthy cells. Opsonin It is any molecule that targets an antigen for an immune response. However, the term is usually used in reference to molecules that act as a binding enhancer for the process of phagocytosis, especially antibodies, which coat the negatively-charged molecules on the membrane. Molecules that activate the complement system are also considered opsonins. Phagocytic cells do not have an FC receptor for IgM, making IgM ineffective in assisting phagocytosis. However, IgM is extremely efficient at activating complement and is, therefore, considered an opsonin. Opsonins can also refer to molecules that target a cell for destruction through the action of Natural Killer cells. Examples of opsonin molecules include: Antibodies: IgG Components of the complement system: C3b, C4b, and i. C3b Mannose-binding lectin (initiates the formation of C3b) The most impoant are IgG and C3b.",

        "exp": "Infectious mononucleosis is a benign infection caused by the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), a herpesvirus. Although B lymphocytes are infected by the virus, the characteristic atypical cells are activated suppressor T cells - thus the paracoical location (T cell zone) in the lymph node. Lymph nodes in viral infections show expansion of germinal centers without loss of normal architecture. All lymphomas, including Burkitt's, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, destroy the normal architecture of the lymph node. Burkitt's lymphoma produces a sea of monotonous, mitotically active cells in a \"starry sky\" appearance. Hodgkin's lymphoma also can show nodular or diffuse patterns, but is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells. AIDS is associated with a number of neoplastic and infectious processes that may alter the lymph node structure. The characteristic lymph node changes in AIDS are progressive transformation of the germinal centers, not paracoical hyperplasia. Ref: Brooks G. F., Carroll K. C., Butel J. S., Morse S.

Ag become undetectable 1-2 months after the onset of jaundice and rarely persists beyond 6 months. In chronic HBV infection, HBs. Ag remains detectable beyond 6 months.

HBe Ag HBe Ag appears concurrently with or sholy after HBs Ag. HBe Ag is an indicator of active intrahepatic replication and high infectivity. It is a qualitative marker of HBV replication. HBs Ag carrier mothers who are HBe. Ag positive almost invariably (> 90%) transmit hepatitis B infection to their offspring, where as HBs Ag carrier mothers with anti HBe rarely (10 to 15%) infect their offspring. HBe testing is indicated primarily during follow up of chronic infection. Anti HBc Ag o Appears within the first 1 to 2 weeks after the appearance of HBs Ag.

Its cyst form, when stained with silver stains, has the distinctive appearance described in the question stem, and is typically found in frothy material that occupies the lumen of alveoli. The trophozoites are smaller and much harder to recognize. Bronchoalveolar lavage is considered much more reliable than induced sputum as a diagnostic specimen. Pneumocystis pneumonia is a common infection among AIDS patients, and is very uncommon in other clinical settings. Formerly, many AIDS patients died with Pneumocystis pneumonia, but the combination of early drug treatment (with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or pentamidine) and prophylaxis (usually with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) has decreased the number of fatal infections.

The hypervariable regions of the H and L chains associate to form the epitope binding region known as antibody idiotype. (The pa of the antigen which binds to the antibody is called epitope). Sites on hypervariable region which make actual contact with the epitopes are called complementary determining regions (CDRS) or paratopes. The infinite range of antibody specificity of inzmunoglobulins depends on the variability of amino acid sequences at the variable unit of H and L chains. Isotype switching Isotype switching is a biological mechanism that changes a B cell's production of antibody from one class to another, for example IgM in primary response to IgG in secondary response. During this process the constant region poion of the antibody heavy chain is changed, but the variable region of the heavy chain stays the same. \"Since the variable region does not change, class switching does not effect antigen specificity\". Instead, the antibody retains affinity for the same antigen, but can interact with different effector molecules. Note No option amongst the given four is completely correct. Isotype variation is due to variations in amino-acid sequences in the constant region of carboxyterminal of heavy chains (not in both heavy and light chains).",

In this example, a virus (e. g., influenza virus) is inhaled and infects a cell of the respiratory tract. Viral envelope glycoproteins appear on the surface of the infected cell in association with class I MHC proteins. A cytotoxic T cell binds its antigen-specific receptor to the viral antigen-class I MHC protein complex and is stimulated to grow into a clone of cells by interleukin-2 produced by helper T cells. These cytotoxic T cells specifically kill influenza virus-infected cells (and not cells infected by other viruses) by recognizing viral antigen-class I MHC protein complexes on the cell surface and releasing perforins that destroy the membrane of the infected cell.

Mycoplasmas are unique organisms because they have a very small size similar to viruses but unlike viruses, they have an independent existence i. e. they can grow in cell free media. Though they can grow in cell free media but they have a limited biosynthetic ability to they need a rich growth medium containing natural animal protein (usually blood serum) and in most cases a sterol component.. The sterol component is required because mycoplasma contains sterol in their cell membrane.. Mycoplasmas are also unique because they do not have a regular cell wall instead they are bound by a cell membrane consisting primarily of sterol. The absence of the cell wall gives two characteristic propeies to mycoplasma - i) The absence of cell wall makes them highly pleomorphic. ii) Mycoplasmas are completely resistant to penicillin because, they lack the cell wall structure at which penicillin acts instead they are inhibited by tetracycline or erythromycin. Mycoplasma and L forms of bacteria (cell wall defective bacteria) L phase bacteria are cell wall defective bacteria that can replicate serially as non rigid cells and can produce colonies on solid media.. L forms develop when many bacteria either spontaneously or induced by ceain cell wall inhibiting drugs lose pa or all of their cell wall and develop into L forms. Some L phase variants are stable, others are unstable and reve to their bacterial parental forms. It has been suggested that mycoplasmas may represent stable L forms of bacteria but genetic, antigenic and biochemical evidence are against the possibility.. The characteristic of the cell wall defective forms may be similar to those of mycoplasma but by definition, mycoplasmas do not reve to parental bacterial forms or originate from them. There is no genetic relationship between mvcoplasmas and cell wall defective microbial forms or their parent bacteria.

Schizonts are small, compact and seldom seen in peripheral smear. Macrogametocytes are crescentic with deep blue cytoplasm and compact nucleus. In falciparum malaria, parasitized erythrocytes may be sequestered in tissue capillaries resulting in a falsely low parasite count in the peripheral blood ('visible' parasitemia). In such instances, the developmental stages of the parasite seen on blood smear may help to assess disease severity better than parasite count alone. The presence of more mature parasite forms (>20% of parasites as late trophozoites and schizonts) and of more than 5% of neutrophils containing malarial pigment indicates more advanced disease and a worse prognosis. One negative blood smear makes the diagnosis of malaria very unlikely (especially the severe form); however, smears should be repeated every 6-12 hours for 48 hours if malaria is still suspected",

Mechanism of central tolerance: B cell: The recognition of antigens by the immature B-cells in the bone marrow is critical to the development of immunological tolerance to self. For proper immunological function it is essential B cell do not recognize self antigen and should recognize antigen derived from pathogens. In the bone marrow the immature B cells bearing surface IgM, if recognizes self molecule undergo negative selection. This self antigen induce loss of cells from the B cell repeoire is called as clonal deletion. Thus only those B cells that do not recognizes self molecules as antigen comes out of bone marrow. T cells tolerance: T cells are selected for survival more rigorously than B cells. They undergo both positive and negative selection to produce T cells that recognizes self MHC but do not recognizes self peptides. T cell tolerance is induced in thymus. (i) Positive selection occurs in thymic coex, if a maturing T cell is able to bind to a surface MHC molecule it is saved from program cells death; whereas cells fails to recognize MHC dies. Positive selection ensures that T cell recognize antigen in association with MHC molecule only. (ii) Negative selection occurs in coex, coico-medullary junction, and the medulla. Here MTEC (modullary thymic epithelial cells) signal self reactive T cells to die apoptosis. Other Options Option b: Class I MHC are expressed by all nucleated cells and platelets. Ref. Robbin's 8/e 190 Option c: Both B cells and T cell possess antigen receptors. On B cells surface Ig acts as antigenic receptor whereas on T cell, TCR along with CD3 acts as antigenic receptors. Ref.

A bioterrorism attack is the delibrate release of viruses, bacteria or other germs ( agents) used to cause illness or death in people, animals or plants. These agents are typically found in nature, but it is possible that they could be changed to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicines or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment. Biological agents can be spread through the air, through water or in food. Terrorists may use biological agents because they can be extermely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. Some bioterrorism agents, like the small pox virus, can be spread from person to person and some like anthrax, cannot. Bioterrorism agent categories Category A. These high priority agents include organisms or toxins that pose the highest risk to the public and national security because: i) They can be easily spread or transmitted from person to person. ii) They result in high death rates and have potential for major public health impact. iii) They might cause public panic and social disruption. iv) They require special action for public health preparedness. Category B. These agents are second highest priority because: i) They are moderately easy to spread. ii) They result in moderate illness rates and low death rates. iii) They require specific enhancements of CDC's laboratory capacity and enhanced disease monitoring. Category C. These third highest priority agents include emerging pathogens that could be engineered for mass spread in the future because: i) They are easily available. ii) They are easily produced and spread. iii) They have potential for high morbidity and moality rates and major health impact.

Robeson's cooked meat medium is probably the most widely used fluid medium for the culture of anaerobes. Obligate anaerobes are bacteria that can live only in the absence of oxygen. Obligate anaerobes are destroyed when exposed to the atmosphere for as briefly as 10 minutes. Facultative anaerobes are those organisms that will grow with or without oxygen. Many anaerobes have characteristic microscopic morphology. For example, Bacteroides spp. are gram-negative rods that are pleomorphic (variable in size and shape) and exhibit irregular bipolar staining. Fusobacterium spp. are often pale gram-negative spindle-shaped rods having pointed ends. Clostridium spp. are large gram-positive rods that form spores. Blood agar is a solid culture medium consisting of agar, peptones and blood. It is an example of an enriched, non selective general purpose medium since it suppos the growth of most aerobic and aerobic bacteria.

        "question": "A pathologist repos the presence of koilocytotic atypia in a cervical biopsy from a 25 year old woman. On the basis of this histopathologic finding, which of the following conditions does this patient most likely have?",
        "exp": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of condyloma, which may occur on any mucocutaneous surface of the male or female external genitalia. Squamous epithelial cells infected by HPV show characteristic nuclear and cytoplasmic changes, referred to as koilocytosis or koilocytotic atypia, on tissue sections or Pap smears. These changes allow the diagnosis of HPV infection to be made. The nuclei are condensed and have irregular contours, acquiring a \"raisin-like\" appearance; cytoplasm vacuolization creates a perinuclear halo. HPV is a crucial etiopathogenetic factor in the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. Not all types of HPV, however, are associated with cervical carcinoma. High-risk types are 16 and 18, whereas the most frequent low-risk types are 6 and 11. HPV types 16 and 18 express proteins (E6 and E7) that inactivate p53 and Rb tumor suppressor genes, leading to neoplastic transformation. Although HPV infection is a risk factor for the development of squamous dysplasia and carcinoma, koilocytosis is not equivalent to severe squamous dysplasia (choice E) or carcinoma in situ (choice F). In the current Bethesda system for diagnosing and repoing Pap smears, koilocytosis is likened to a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, ie, mild atypia. Remember that koilocytosis (koilocytotic atypia) = HPV infection, not severe dysplasia/carcinoma. Chlamydia infection of the genital tract is due to Chlamydia trachomatis. The infection is often symptomatic in men and clinically silent in women. In addition to urethritis and lymphogranuloma venereum, C. trachomatis causes trachoma, an eye infection endemic in some developing countries. Gonococcal infection, or gonorrhea, is due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a gram-negative diplococcus. Herpes simplex type 2 virus manifests with painless blisters, which subsequently break down, forming painful erosions. Ref: Ray C. G., Ryan K. J. (2010). Chapter 19. Papilloma and Polyoma Viruses.

Production of beta-lactamase (penicillinase) It inactivates penicillin by splitting 13-lactam ring Its production is controlled by plasmid. Plasmid is transmitted by transduction (mainly) or conjugation. Penicillinase is an inducible enzyme As a result of the widespread dissemination of plasmids containing penicillinase, less than 5% strains of staph. remain susceptible to penicillin. Staphylococci produce four type of penicillinases, A to D. Hospital strains usually forms type 'A' penicillinase. 2. Changes in bacterial surface receptors by lack or inaccessibility of ceain penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) in the organism. Methicillin resistant is mainly due to this mechanism and is independent of /3 - lactamase production. It is due to production of PBP 2a. This change ( in bacterial surface receptors) is normally chromosomal in nature. The resistance gene is mec A gene which is a pa of large mobile genetic element - staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec).

Resistance to antibiotics Penicillin resistance is of three types- 1) Production of beta-lactamase (penicillinase) It inactivates penicillin by splitting \u03b2-lactam ring Its production is controlled by plasmid. Plasmid is transmitted by transduction (mainly) or conjugation. Penicillinase is an inducible enzyme As a result of the widespread dissemination of plasmids containing penicillinase, less than 5% strains of staph. remain susceptible to penicillin. Staphylococci produce four type of penicillinases, A to D. Hospital strains usually forms type 'A' penicillinase. 2) Changes in bacterial surface receptors by lack or inaccessibility of certain penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) in the organism. Methicillin resistant is mainly due to this mechanism and is independent of \u03b2 - lactamase production. It is due to production of PBP 2a. This change (in bacterial surface receptors) is normally chromosomal in nature. The resistance gene is mec A gene which is a part of large mobile genetic element - staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec). This genetic material has been transferred to Staph. aureus from S. seiuri. 3) Development of tolerance to penicillin, by which the bacterium is only inhibited but not killed.

        "exp": "This patient has a gonorrhea infection. It is more common in patients of lower socioeconomic status, patients with multiple sexual paners, and in urban settings. The causative organism is N. gonorrhoeae, a gram-negative aerobic diplococcus. Up to 80% of women that are infected with the organism will have no symptoms at all or only vague symptoms. Symptoms that are frequently noted are vaginal discharge, postcoital spotting, and urinary symptoms if the urethra is involved. Examination may reveal a cervicitis, although this is not always present. A patient found to have gonorrhea should be treated with intramuscular ceftriaxone or oral cefixime, ofloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. These medications will ffectively eradicate the gonococcus. However, because Chlamydia trachomatis can be isolated in up to 50% of women with gonorrhea and because women treated for gonorrhea only may soon go on to develop Chlamydia or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID., any woman receiving treatment for gonorrhea should also be treated for ChlamydiA. Treatment of Chlamydia is with azithromycin or doxycycline. It is also essential that this patient's paner be treated as well. When treating a patient for gonorrhea, there is no need to treat the patient with metronidazole to treat bacterial vaginosis (Choice A) as well, unless there is evidence of a bacterial vaginosis. Herpes (Choice C) often presents as painful vesicles and ulcers. Patients with onorrhea do not need to be treated for herpes as well, unless there is evidence for herpes infection. Patients with gonorrhea are at increased risk of having other sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis (Choice D). It would be prudent to check this patient for syphilis with a blood test.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Increase in c-AMP The debilitating loss of intestinal fluid is caused primarily by the release of cholera toxin, the main virulence factor of the pathogen Vibrio cholerae. Cholera toxin consists of an A subunit coupled to a B subunit: the A subunit consists of an Al domain containing the enzymatic active site, and an A2 domain while the B subunit contains five identical peptides that assemble into a pentameric ring surrounding a central pore. This AB; structure is closely related to the heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, which causes diarrhoea, often in infants. Symptoms begin when the massive secretion of water and sodium in the small intestine, a consequence of the activation of cyclic AMP, exceeds the resorptive capacity of the colon.",
