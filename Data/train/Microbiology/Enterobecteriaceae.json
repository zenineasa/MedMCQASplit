Clinical features of rhinoscleromao The disease runs through the following stagesa) Atrophic stage: It resembles atrophic rhinitis and is characterised by foul smelling purulent nasal discharge and crusting. b) Granulomatous stage: Granulomatous nodules form in nasal mucosa. There is also subdermal infiltration of lower part of external nose and upper lip giving a 'woody' feel. Nodules are painless and non-ulcerative. c) Cicatricial stage: This causes stenosis of nares, distortion of upper lip, adhesions in the nose, nasopharynx and oropharynx.

It is classically characterized by the triad of. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Thrombocytopenia. Uremia. Etiology. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is proceeded by bacterial infections. The bacterias commonly associated are: E. coli (Verocay to genic E. coli is the most common cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome) in. Nelson states \"An acute enteritis with diarrhoea caused by Shiga-like toxin producing escherichia coli (verocytotoxigenic E. coli) 0157: H7 precedes 80% or more of HUS cases in developed countries\"An important point some say that option 'a' was\"Not commonly caused by verocytotoxigenic E. coli in Asia \"If this was the option then it is a true statement. The infection associated with H. U. S. varies with region. In developed countries (North America and Europe). Verocytotoxigenic E coli or Shiga like toxin producing Escherichia coli is the most common cause (80% of all the cases). In Asia (India). Shigella dysenteriae is the chief pathogen. The anemia associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome is coomb's negative hemolytic anemia. Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia occurs when the anemia is caused due to autoantibodies produced in the body. In H. U. S. the hemolytic anemia is caused by mechanical damage to R. B. C. when they pass through micro thrombi (which are formed in capillaries due to platelet aggregation). The red cells while passing through these capillaries get attached to the thrombus and gets fragmented causing hemolysis. Autoantibodies have nothing to do with hemolytic uremic syndrome. So the anemia will not be comb positive. Thrombocytopenia in H. U. S. A low platelet count can usually but not always be detected early in the illness, but it may then become normal or even high. If a platelet count obtained within 7 days after onset of the acute gastrointestinal illness is not <150, 000/mm3, other diagnosis should be considered. Recurrence in H. U. S.
