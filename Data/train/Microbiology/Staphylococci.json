The hematogenous route of infection is the most common route in all age groups, and nearly every bacterial pathogen is capable of causing septic arthritis. In infants, group B streptococci, gram-negative enteric bacilli, and S. aureus are the most common pathogens. Since the advent of the Haemophilus influenzae vaccine, the predominant causes among children < 5 years of age have been S. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus), and (in some centers) Kingella kingae. Among young adults and adolescents, N. gonorrhoeae is the most commonly implicated organism. S. aureus accounts for most nongonococcal isolates in adults of all ages; gramnegative bacilli, pneumococci, and B-hemolyticstreptococci'particularly groups A and B but also groups C, G, and F are involved in up to one-third of cases in older adults, especially those with underlying comorbid illnesses.",

Capsules and Slime Layers. Some bacteria have a layer of material lying outside the cell wall. When the layer is well organized and not easily washed off. it is called a capsule. A slime layer is a zone of diffuse, unorganized material that is removed easily. Capsules and slime layers usually are composed of polysaccharides, but they may be constructed of other materials. For example. Bacillus anthracis has a capsule of poly-D-glutamic acid. Capsules are clearly visible in the light microscope when negative stains or special capsule stains are employed. They help bacteria resist phagocytosis. Capsules contain a great deal of water and can protect bacteria against desiccation. Also aids bacterial attachment. Gliding bacteria often produce slime, which presumably aids in their motilityS-Layers. Many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria have a regularly structured layer called an S-layer on their surface. The S-layer has a pattern something like floor tiles and is composed of protein or glycoprotein. In gram-negative bacteria the S-layer adheres directly to the outer membrane; it is associated with the peptidoglycan surface in gram-positive bacteria. It may protect the cell against ion and pH fluctuations, osmotic stress, enzymes. The S-layer also helps maintain the shape and envelope rigidity of at least some bacterial cells. It can promote cell adhesion to surfaces. The layer seems to protect some pathogens against complement attack and phagocytosis.",

Toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST): Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a potentially fatal multisystem disease presenting with fever, hypotension, myalgia, vomiting, diarrhea, mucosal hyperemia and an erythematous rash which desquamates subsequently. This is associated with infection of mucosal or sequestered sites by TSST-producing Staph, aureus strains usually belonging to bacteriophage group I. TSST type-1 (formerly also known as enterotoxin type F or pyrogenic exotoxin C) is most often responsible, though enterotoxins B or C may also cause the syndrome. TSS was first identified in 1978 in children and adolescents, but became widely known only in 1980 following out- breaks in the USA in menstruating women using highly absorbent vaginal tampons. Their vaginal swabs showed heavy growth of staph, aureus, though blood cultures were invariably negative. TSST-1 antibody is seen in convalescents. This is protective and absence of TSST-1 antibody is a factor in the pathogenesis of the condition. Though tampon-related TSS is now rare, the syndrome occurs in other infections of the skin, mucosa and other sites and also in some surgical wounds.",

Plasmid mediated inducible enzyme which is transmitted by transduction (more commonly) or conjugationb. Hospital strains mostly form Type A penicillinasec. Same plasmid carry genes for resistance to tetracycline, erythromycin, aminoglycoside too2. Altered penicillin binding protein: a. Chromosomally mediated and expressed more at 30deg C than at 37 degC. (A1. IMS)b. Responsible for resistance against penicillinase resistant penicillin such as methicillin. cloxacillinc. Strains are called MRSA (methicillin resistant Staph, aureus)3. Tolerance to penicillin. Bacteria only inhibited not killed. Transformation: The first example of genetic exchange in bacteria was described by Griffith. This is the transfer of genetic material through the agency of free DN A. This has been studied mainly in BPH: Bacillus. Hemophilus. Pneumococcus. Traasduction. Transfer of a portion of DNA from one bacterium to the other by means of a bacteriophage. This has been proposed as a method of genetic engineering and in treatment of some inborn errors of metabolism. Conjugation: Transfer of genetic elements after actual physical contact between a male donor bacterium and female recipient e. g., transfer of episomes and plasmid such as those for resistance. Bacterial conjugation was first described by Lederberg and Tatum in a strain of E. coli called K-12. Lysogenic conversion: In lysogenic conversion the phage DNA itself is the new genetic element as it becomes integrated with the bacterial host DNA with which it multiplies and is transferred to daughter cells. E. g.: Diphtheriae corynebacterium",
