Diagnosis of chlamydia. Four approaches are available for the laboratory diagnosis of chlamydial infections. Microscopic demonstration of elementary or inclusion bodies. Isolation of chlamydia (culture). Antigen detection & Nucleic acid hybridization. Serology. Microscopic demonstration of elementary or inclusion bodies, Chlamydial elementary bodies and inclusions are large enough to be seen under the light microscope. Cytological examination is important and useful only in the examination of conjunctivitis and trachoma caused by chlamydia trachomatis. Another method available for microscopic examination is Immunoflorescence using monoclonal antibody. Isolation of chlamydia. Isolation of chlamydia can be done by inoculation into: embryonated eggsexperimental animals (Hi) tissue cultures. Embryonated eggs -Chlamydia can be grown in yolk sac of 6-8 days old chick embryos. Isolation by egg inoculation is tedious and relatively insensitive and has been replaced by tissue cultures. Tissue culture. Cell culture is the preferred method for isolation of chlamydia. Cell cultures for Chlamydia Trachomatis } - Mc. Coy cells Chlamydia Psittaci } Chlamydia pneumonia -HL or HEp+2 cells. Cell cultures used for isolation of chlamydia are pretreated by irradiation or chemicals. Pretreatment with DEAD-dextran reduces the electrostatic barrier to infection before centrifugation of chlamydial or clinical specimen on to the cells. Thus it promotes contact between chlamydial particles and cell monolayer increasing chance of isolation. The cells are then usually incubated in an antimetabolite such as cycloheximide to favour chlamydial competition for host amino acid pool. Antigen detection & Nucleic acid hybridization Antigen detection can be done by two method. Direct florescent antibody (DFA) demonstration -The DFA uses monoclonal antibodies directed against a species specific antigen on the chlamydial major outer membrane protein (MOMP). Enzyme linked immunoassays (EIA'S) -This test detects the presence of genus specific lipopoly saccharide antigens extracted from the elementary bodies in the specimen. Nucleic acid detection * Molecular methods used for the detection of chlamydiae are. Polymerase chain reaction. Ligase chain reaction. Serology. Antibodies against chlamydia can be used for diagnosis. A fourfold rise in titres is diagnostic. Serological test are not useful in the diagnostic of genital chlamydia infections because of high prevalence of chlamydial genital tract infection is some societies. Also know. Hypersensitivity test -Demonstration of hypersensitivity by skin testing (Frei's test) was widely used formerly for diagnosis of L. G. V. but has been given up because of false positive results.

Among the three antibiotics that have been shown to treat legionellosis effectively (erythromycin, rifampin, and minocycline), erythromycin is clearly superior, even though in vitro studies show the organism to be susceptible to other antibiotics. Penicillin remains the drug of choice for S. pneumoniae and the group A streptococci, although a few isolates of penicillin-resistant pneumococci have been observed. Resistance among the pneumococci is either chromosomally mediated, in which case the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are relatively low, or plasmid-mediated, which results in highly resistant bacteria. The same is generally true for H. influenzae. Until the mid-1970s, virtually all isolates of H. influenzae were susceptible to ampicillin. There has been a rapidly increasing incidence of ampicillin-resistant isolates, almost 35 to 40% in some areas of the United States. Resistance is ordinarily mediated by b-lactamase, although ampicillin-resistant, b-lactamase-negative isolates have been seen. No resistance to penicillin has been seen in group A streptococci. C. difficile causes toxin-mediated pseudomembranous enterocolitis as well as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Pseudomembranous enterocolitis is normally seen during or after administration of antibiotics. One of the few agents effective against C. difficile is vancomycin. Alternatively, bacitracin can be used. Lyme disease, caused by B. burgdorferi, has been treated with penicillin, erythromycin, and tetracycline. Treatment failures have been observed.

The nonspecific tests (VDRL/RPR) test can be easily ruled out:-Their sensitivity is comparable to that of specific tests in primary and secondary syphilis but in latent or late syphilis they have quite low sensitivity. Specific Tests TPIIn its time TPI was the most specific test available for diagnosis of syphilis and was considered \"gold standard\" in syphilis serology. However because of its extreme complexity it was available only in few laboratories. The TPI test has now been supplanted by other tests such as FTA-ABS and TPHA which are quite as specific and much simpler. FTA-ABS test. FTA-ABS test is as specific as the TPI test and is now accepted as the standard reference test. However it can be done only in suitably equipped laboratories, it is not available for routine testing. TPHA test. TPHA test is just as specific as FTA-ABS and almost as sensitive except in the primary stage. It is also much simple and more economical. These advantages have made TPHA a standard confirmations test. TPPA test. The TPHA test has been replaced by the serodia TP-PA test which is more sensitive for primary syphilis. TPHA is widely available in Europe but not used in U. S. A. From the discussion above, and from the table reproduced from Harrison, it seems, the TPPA is the most sensitive test for syphilis. Both FTA-ABS and TP-PA are equally sensitive in secondary and latent syphilis. TP-PA has higher sensitivity in Primary syphilis. The problem is that enough datas for TP-PA are not available. Sensitivity of Serodiagnostic tests in Syphilis. Test. Primary. Secondary. Latent. Tertiary* VDRL/RPR78 (74-87)10095(88-100)71 (37-94)* FTA-ABS84 (70-100)10010096* TP-PA89100100. NADiagnosis of syphilis:-Treponema pallidum cannot be isolated by routine culture methods therefore detection is either by direct visualization of the organisms in material from the lesion or indirectly by immunological/serological methods. Each stage of the treponematoses requires a particular testing modality. Absolute diagnosis during the first and second stages can be made by direct examination under dark field microscopy of a specimen from primary chancre, the maculopapular rash, or the condyloma latum. Since the direct visualization of spirochetes is effective only during the active stages of primary and secondary syphilis, serologic tests were developed. Serological tests in syphilis are of two types. Nonspecific treponemal tests. Specific treponemal tests Nonspecific treponemal tests: -Infection with syphilis results in cellular damage and the release into the serum of a number of lipids including cardiolipin and lecithin. The body produces antibodies against these antigens. Nonspecific treponemal tests detects the presence of these antibodies to lipoprotein material from damaged cells and cardiolipin from treponemes and as a consequence are not specific for Treponema. (Reactivity in these tests indicates host tissue damage). If the patient has these antibodies it is assumed that he or she has syphilis. These tests are used for screening of syphilis. If these tests are positive presence of the disease should be confirmed by specific tests. The tests commonly employed are: -Venereal disease Research laboratory test (VDRL TEST). Rapid plasma Regain Test (RPR test). Why are these tests nonspecific?? These tests measure antibodies directed against cardiolipin antigen that results from interaction of host tissues with Treponema Pallidum or spirochete itself. (They do not detect the antibodies against Treponema itself). Cardiolipin is a phospholipid and it is possible that a similar substance present in the treponemal cell or released from damage host cells damaged by the stimulate antibody production. Assays for nonspecific antibody, because of their low cost and technical simplicity have routinely been used as screening test for evidence of syphilis since these tests have relatively low specificity positive results are confirmed by detection of specific anti Treponemal antibody. Antibody develops in 70% of patients within 2 weeks of developing chancre and in 100% of patients with secondary syphilis. The important point about nonspecific treponemal tests is that they can be used quantitatively: -Quantitative result of these tests tends to correlate with disease activity thus they are very helpful for screening. A fourfold or greater rise in the titre may be seen during the evolution of early syphilis. In secondary syphilis, test results are always positive and often at a high titre. The nonspecific treponemal tests should become nonreactive one year after successful therapy in primary syphilis and 2 years after successful therapy in late syphilis. Therefore these tests can be used to monitor response to treatment. - After successful treatment there would be sustained four fold decrease in antibody titre. Similarly a fourfold increase in titre following therapy suggests reinfection or relapse and necessitates re- evaluation. Nonspecific Treponemal tests for syphilis VDRL Test. The VDRL test is a nonspecific serological test for syphilis. It uses a mixture of cardiolipin, cholesterol and lecithin as antigen. With the use of these antigens, IgG or IgM antibodies present in the serum or C. S. F. (in case of neurosyphilis) are detected. This test can be used quantitatively and increase in VDRL titre with time can be used to confirm a diagnosis of syphilis. R. P. R. It is also a nonspecific test which uses cardiolipin as antigen. Treponemal specific tests. While the nonspecific tests look for anti lipoidal antibodies the specific treponemal tests look for antibodies against the spirochete itself. The tests included in this category are: -Indirect immunofluorescence treponemal antibody-absorption test (FTA-ABS) test. Treponema Pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) or microhemagglutination test (MHA-TP). Treponema Pallidum immobilization test (TPI). Enzyme immune assay (ELISA). TPPA test. These tests are used to confirm a positive nontreponemal reaginic test. Treponema specific tests are not completely specific for syphilis because false positive reactions can occur with other spirochetal diseases (e. g., Yaws, pinta leptospirosis, rat bite fever, relapsing fever, Lyme disease). An important point about these tests is that they do not correlate with disease activity. These test findings become positive soon after infection and typically remain positive for life despite adequate treatment.",

ESCHERICHIA COLIAt least six distinct \"pathotypes\" of intestinal pathogenic E. coli exist: o Enteropathoaenic E. coli [Entcroadherent E. colil. It causes diarrhoea in infants and children usually occuring as institutional out breaks. It does not produce enterotoxin, nor are they invasive. They adhere to the mucosa of small intestine and cause disruption of the brush border microvilli. These strains can be identified by their adhesion to HEP - 2 cells. o Enterotoxigenic E. coli. It causes traveller's diarrhoea [ETEC is the most common cause of traveller's diarrhea). It produces enterotoxins. They can produce heat labile toxin (LT) or heat stable toxin or both. Toxin production alone may not lead to illness. The strain should first be able to adhere to intestinal mucosa. This adhesiveness is medicated by fimbrial or colonisation factor antigen (CFA). o Enteroinvasive E. coli. They themselves resemble shigella and their infection resembles shigellosis (remember: shiga like toxin is elaborated by enterohemorrhagic E. coli). They produce mild diarrhoea to frank dvsentry and occur in adult as well as in children. They have been termed enteroinvasive because they have the capacity to invade intestinal epithelial cells in vivo and penetrate He. La or HEP - 2 cells in tissue culture. This ability of penetration is plasmid determined which codes for outer membrane antigens called the Hirulence marker antigen\" (VMA). The detection of plasmid can be diagnostic. For laboratory diagnosis of EIEC, the sereny test used to be employed. These strains are non motile, do not ferment lactose or ferment it late with acid without producing any gas. o Enterohemorrhagic E. coli or verotoxigenic E. coli. These strains produce verocytotoxin (VT) or shiga like toxin (SLT). They can cause mild diarrhoea to fatal hemorrhagic colitis. Shiga like toxin belongs to class ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs). It inhibits protein synthesis by inhibiting ribosomal function. This toxin also acts on vascular endothelium to promote the synthesis of coagulation factor VIII, v. WF - Platelet aggregation. They can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome particularly in young children and the elderly. O 157: H 7 is the most prominent serotype of EHEC, associated with HUS, but 06, 026, 055, 091, 0103, 0111, 0113 and OX3 have also been associated with this syndrome. The primary target for V. T is vascular endothelium. The typical EHEC is serotype O157: H7 which does not ferement sorbital unlike majority of E. coli (but Harrison writes that few species of this serotype can ferment sorbital). Some other serotype like O26: H1 also belongs to this group. Laboratory diagnosis of VIEC diarrhea is established by demonstration of the bacilli or VT in feces directly or in culture. o Enteroaggrecative E. coli}# In developing countries and young children.# Can cause traveller's diarrhea and persistent diarrhea.# In vitro, thev exhibit a \"stacked - brick\" adherence pattern on Hep - 2 cells. o Diffusely adherent E. coli# Enteroaggregative E. coli forms a low molecular weight heat stable enterotoxin EAST -1 (enteroaggregative heat stable enterotoxin -1).",

The motility test rapidly differentiates listeria from diphtheroids that are members of the normal microbiota of the skin. The organism has several adhesion proteins (Ami, Fbp A, and flagellin proteins) that facilitate bacterial binding to the host cells and that contribute to virulence. It has cell wall surface proteins called internalins A and B that interact with E-cadherin, a receptor on epithelial cells, promoting phagocytosis into the epithelial cells. After phagocytosis, the bacterium is enclosed in a phagolysosome, where the low pH activates the bacterium to produce listeriolysin. This enzyme, along with two phospholipases, lyses the membrane of the phagolysosome and allows the listeriae to escape into the cytoplasm of the epithelial cell. The organism proliferates, and ActA, another listerial surface protein, induces host cell actin polymerization, which propels them to the cell membrane. Pushing against the host cell membrane, they cause formation of elongated protrusions called filopods. These filopods are ingested by adjacent epithelial cells, macrophages, and hepatocytes, the listeriae are released, and the cycle begins again.

This method involves testing a pneumococcal cell suspension with pooled and specific antisera directed against the capsular polysaccharide. The antigen-antibody reactions are observed microscopically. b. A positive Quellung reaction is the result of the binding of the capsular polysaccharide of pneumococci with type specific antibody contained in the typing antiserum. The protocol has three main steps: -a. Preparation of a bacterial cell suspension, b. Mixing of cells and antisera on a glass slide, and. Note: -a. It is recommended to initially test with pooled antisera in succession until a positive reaction is observed. b. Typing should then proceed by testing with individual group and serotype-specific antisera included in the antisera pool that gave a positive reaction to determine the serogroup and serotype. c. Reading the Quellung reaction using a microscope. Principle: -a. An antigen-antibody reaction causes a change in the refractive index of the capsule so that it appears \"swollen\" and more visible. After the addition of a counter stain (methylene blue), the pneumococcal cells stain dark blue and are surrounded by a sharply demarcated halo which represents the outer edge of the capsule. b. The light transmitted through the capsule appears brighter than either the pneumococcal cell or the background. Single cells, pairs, chains, and even clumps of cells may have positive Quellung reactions.",

The coagulase-negative staphylococci are normal human flora and sometimes cause infection, often associated with implanted appliances and devices, especially in very young, old, and immunocompromised patients.* Approximately 75% of these infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci are due to S epidermidis. Staphylococci produce catalase, which converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. The catalase test differentiates the staphylococci, which are positive, from the streptococci, which are negative. S saprophyticus is typically nonpigmented, novobiocin-resistant, and nonhemolytic; it causes urinary tract infections in young women. Resistance to nafcillin (and oxacillin and methicillin) occurs in about 35% of S aureus and approximately 75% of S epidermidis isolates. So it cannot be used to differentiate them.",

It is elaborated by the organism following its colonization of the small intestine. Effect of cholera toxin leads to watery diarrhoea, the characteristic feature of cholera. Mechanism of Cholera Toxin Action. Cholera toxin consists of 2 subunits a monomeric enzymatic moiety (A subunit) a pentameric binding moiety (B subunit). The B-subunit, serves as a 'landing pad' and binds to GM1 ganglioside, a glycolipid on the surface of epithelial cells of the small intestine. This facilitates the entry of A-subunit into the epithelial cells. The entry of A-subunit into the cells leads to activation of its A1 fragment. Activated A1 interacts with cytosolic proteins called ADP-ribosylation factors (ARF). The ARF-A1 complexes catalyze ADP-ribosylation of a G-protein called GSa. The ADP-ribosylated Gsa in turn binds to and stimulates adenylate cyclase. Activated adenylate cyclase generates high levels of intracellular cyclic AMP (c. AMP) from ATP. c. AMP inhibits the absorptive sodium transport system (decreases sodium & chloride reabsorption) and activates the secretory chloride transport system (increases chloride and bicarbonate secretion). This leads to accumulation of sodium chloride in the intestinal lumen. Accumulated sodium chloride draws water into the lumen due to increased osmolality leading to watery diarrhoea.

        "question": "A 50-year-old man presented to his family doctor complaining of flu-like symptoms. The doctor gave him a shot of penicillin and sent him home. The man came back a week later and in fact, felt worse. The man was a rancher and raised a lot of cattle. He told the doctor that he had congenital heart disease and an attack of rheumatic fever when he was young. The man now complained of fever, night sweats, continual coughing, weight loss, and lethargy. The doctor had the man hospitalized because he now suspected subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE). A culture of his blood did not show any bacterial growth, but a serum analysis for antibodies against a certain bacterium was positive. As a result of finding antibodies to this organism, treatment with doxycycline was begun and the patient improved and was released from the hospital. What was the name of the organism with which the man was infected?",
        "exp": "The man had Q-fever. This disease is caused by infection with Coxiella burnetii. This organism is extremely stable and can survive in milk and soil for a very long time. Infections in man occur when the organisms become airborne from a contaminated source such as soil or milk from a farm. Man can also become infected by drinking contaminated milk. That is why it is a good idea to drink only pasteurized milk. Most of the people exposed to Coxiella burnetii suffer an asymptomatic infection and most symptoms that people do experience are flu-like. Q-fever can occur a long time after the original exposure to the organism and this occurs primarily in people with congenital heart disease. In this case, SBE is most commonly seen. The two Chlamydophila organisms (psittaci and pneumoniae) are incorrect. The man got his infection working on his cattle ranch. The Chlamydophila are not extremely stable and do not survive in dust. Chlamydia trachomatis is incorrect because this organism is not extremely stable and does not survive in dust. While the viridans streptococci do cause SBE, they did not cause this man's infection because they are sensitive to penicillin and they would have grown out in his blood culture had they been present.",

Conkey agars are colorless due to absence of lactose fermentation except S. sonnie, which ferments lactose late and forms pink colonies.# DCA and Wilson and Blair selective media are the selective media.# Infective dose of Shigella is 10-100 bacteria, while that of Salmonella is 102-105. S. boydii does not produce H2S, does not hydrolyze urea and does not grow in KCN broth. Carbohydrates are usually fermented and these include glucose (in the absence of gas production), D-mannitol, arabinose, trehalose and mannose.# Lactose fermentation is a biochemical property commonly used for to distinguish Shigella from the closely related bacterium E. coli. However, S. sonnei isolates ferment lactose at a lot slower process than other species of Shigella. S. sonnei is known to be less virulent than other Shigella species.# S. dysenteriae type 1 differs from most of the Enterobacteriaceae in that it does not produce catalase. Shigella dysenteriae type 1 produces severe disease symptoms collectively called shigellosis, which may be associated with life-threatening complications.# Shigella flexneri is a facultative anaerobe. It makes ATP via aerobic respiration in the presence of oxygen and via fermentation in the absence of oxygen. Although it is closely related to Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri can be differentiated because it fails to ferment lactose or decarboxylate lysine.# 5. boydii, when found in the intestine, go though anaerobic metabolic pathways but can survive outside of the body due to its ability to utilize aerobic pathways. More specifically, 5. boydii, typically does not have oxidase enzymes but rather catalase enzymes (catalyzes the reduction of H2. O2->H20). Methyl red testing is positive, meaning that the bacteria uses a mixed acid fermentation pathway. Voges-Proskauer and Simmons' citrate reactions are negative, meaning that this organism does not utilize the butylene glycol pathway or produce acetoin. Lysine decarboxylase, arginine dihydrolase and ornithine decarboxylase are not present. S. boydii does not produce H2S, does not hydrolyze urea and does not grow in KCN broth.

        "exp": "An understanding of normal, or indigenous, microflora is essential in order to appreciate the abnormal. Usually, anatomic sites contiguous to mucous membranes are not sterile and have characteristic normal flora. The skin flora differs as a function of location. Skin adjacent to mucous membranes may share some of the normal flora of the GI system. Overall, the predominant bacteria on the skin surface are S. epidermidis and Propionibacterium, an anaerobic diphtheroid. The mouth is part of the GI tract, but its indigenous flora shows some distinct differences. While anaerobes are present in large numbers, particularly in the gingival crevice, the eruption of teeth at 6 to 9 months of age leads to colonization by organisms such as S. mutans and Streptococcus sanguis, both a-hemolytic streptococci. An edentulous person loses b-hemolytic streptococci as normal flora. The GI tract is sterile at birth and soon develops characteristic flora as a function of diet. In the adult, anaerobes such as B. fragilis and Bifidobacterium may outnumber coliforms and enterococci by a ratio of 1000: 1. The colon contains 1011 to 1012 bacteria per gram of feces. Soon after birth, the vagina becomes colonized by lactobacilli. As the female matures, lactobacilli may still be predominant, but anaerobic cocci, diphtheroid, and anaerobic, gram-negative rods also are found as part of the indigenous flora. Changes in the chemical or microbiologic ecology of the vagina can have marked effects on normal flora and may promote infection such as vaginitis or vaginosis. Escherichia coli are among the most common group of gram-negative rods isolated in the laboratory. It is fairly easily identified in the laboratory. It ferments mannitol and is lactose positive. The organism is part of normal body flora but is a very efficient opportunist. Urinary tract infections are commonly caused with this organism.",

        "exp": "Ans. d. Cefotaxime is more active against beta-lactamase (Ref: Ananthanarayan 9/e p327, 8/e p331; Harrison 19/e p1011, 18/e p1228; Nelson 19/e p941, 942)\"Cefotaxime or ceftazidime is the drug of choice for the treatment of Hemophilus meningitis. Ampicillin and cotrimoxazole were popular for respiratory infections, but as plasmid-borne resistance to these drugs is now common, thus amoxicillin-clavulanate or clarithromycin is more effective. Plasmid for beta lactamase production makes them resistant. \"--Ananthanarayan 9/e p327\"Antibiotic Resistance: Most H, influenzae isolates are susceptible to ampicillin amoxicillin, but about a third produce a beta-lactamase and are therefore resistant beta-Lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) isolates have been identified that manifest resistance by production of a beta-lactam-insensitive cell wall synthesis enzyme called PBP3. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is uniformly active against H. influenzae clinical isolates except for the rare BLNAR isolates. Among macrolides azithromycin is active against about 99% of H. influenza isolates; in contrast, the activity of erythromycin and clarithromycin against H. influenzae clinical isolates is poor. H. influenzae resistance to 3rd- generation cephalosporins has not been documented. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is infrequent ([?]10%) and resistance to quinolones is believed to be rare. \"\"Initial therapy for meningitis due to Hib should consist of a cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. Administration of glucocorticoids to patients with Hib meningitis reduces the incidence of neurologic sequelae. Many infections caused by non-typable strains of H. influenzae, such as otitis media, sinusitis, and exacerbations of CO PD, can be treated with oral antimicrobial agents. Approximately 20-35% of non-typable strains produce B-lactamase (with the exact proportion depending on geographic location), and these strains are resistant to ampicillin. Several agents have excellent activity against non-typable H. influenzae, including amoxiciltin/clavulanic acid, various extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and the macrolides, azithromycin and clarithromycin. In addition to B-lactamase production, alteration of penicillin- binding proteins--a second mechanism of ampicillin resistance--has been detected in isolates of H. influenzae. \"--Harrison 19/e p 1011\"Clinically; meningitis caused by H. influenzae type b cannot be differentiated from meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Antimicrobial therapy should be administered intravenously for 7-14 days for uncomplicated cases. Cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin cross the blood-brain barrier during acute inflammation in concentrations adequate to treat H. influenzae meningitis. Intramuscular therapy with ceftriaxone is an alternative in patients with normal organ perfusion. \"--Nelson 19/e p941. Hemophilus influenzae (Pfeiffer's bacillus).

Among the three antibiotics that have been shown to treat legionellosis effectively (erythromycin, rifampin, and minocycline), erythromycin is clearly superior, even though in vitro studies show the organism to be susceptible to other antibiotics. Penicillin remains the drug of choice for S. pneumoniae and the group A streptococci, although a few isolates of penicillin-resistant pneumococci have been observed. Resistance among the pneumococci is either chromosomally mediated, in which case the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are relatively low, or plasmid-mediated, which results in highly resistant bacteria. The same is generally true for H. influenzae. Until the mid-1970s, virtually all isolates of H. influenzae were susceptible to ampicillin. There has been a rapidly increasing incidence of ampicillin-resistant isolates, almost 35 to 40% in some areas of the United States. Resistance is ordinarily mediated by b-lactamase, although ampicillin-resistant, b-lactamase-negative isolates have been seen. No resistance to penicillin has been seen in group A streptococci. C. difficile causes toxin-mediated pseudomembranous enterocolitis as well as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Pseudomembranous enterocolitis is normally seen during or after administration of antibiotics. One of the few agents effective against C. difficile is vancomycin. Alternatively, bacitracin can be used. Lyme disease, caused by B. burgdorferi, has been treated with penicillin, erythromycin, and tetracycline. Treatment failures have been observed. Ceftriaxone has become the drug of choice, particularly in the advanced stages of Lyme disease.",

Alpha hemolytic - They only partially lyze the RBC's leaving a greenish discoloration of the culture medium surrounding the colony. This discolored area contains analysed RBC's and a green coloured metabolite of hemoglobin.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e. Vibrio cholera Cholera produces a potent enterotoxin known as cholera toxin. This toxin consists of five B subunits and a single A subunit and has structural, functional and antigenic similarity to heat-labile toxin expressed by strains of enterotoxigenic Escherichia colt. The A subunit of the toxin is made up of two peptides (A1 and A2), linked by a single disulphide bridge. The B subunit binds to sugar residues of ganglioside GM1on the cells lining the villi and crypt of the small intestine (V. cholera never invades the intestinal epithelium but remain within the lumen and secretes the cholera toxin). It is believed that the insertion of the B subunit into the host cell membrane forms a transmembrane channel through which a toxic A subunit can pass into the cytoplasm. The cholera enterotoxin causes the transfer of adenosine diphosphoribose (ADP ribose) from nicotinamide ademine dinucleotide (NAD} to a regulatory protein, which is part of the adenylate cyclase enzyme responsible for the generation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (c. AMP). The result is irreversible activation of adenylate cyclase and overproduction of c. AMP. This in turn causes inhibition of uptake of Na+ and Cl- ions by cells lining the villi, together with hypersecretion of Cl- and HCO3-ions. This blocks the uptake of water which normally accompanies Na+ and Cl- absorption and there is passive net outflow of water across mucosal cells leading to serious loss of water and electrolytes. Heat stable toxin of E. coli acts through c. GMP.",

        "question": "Which of the following is known as battey bacillus?",
        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Mycobacterium intercellulare. REF: Principles of Microbiology by Edward Bittar P-158. An organism was isolated from patients suffering from pulmonary disease by non tuberculous mycobacterium from a hospital in Battey in Georgia in 1957. It was called the BATTEY bacillus and was later named as the Mycobacterium avium intercellulare. THE ORGANISMMycobacterium avium complex (MAC) consists of two species: M avium and M intracellulare; because these species are difficult to differentiate, they are also collectively referred to as Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI). MAC is the atypical Mycobacterium most commonly associated with human disease. Features:* MAC is primarily a pulmonary pathogen that affects individuals who are immune compromised (eg, from AIDS, hairy cell leukemia, immunosuppressive chemotherapy).* MAC is the most common cause of infection by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in patients with AIDS. M avium is the isolate in more than 95% of patients with AIDS who develop MAC infections.* MAC lung disease occurs rarely in immunocompetent hosts. Patients with underlying lung disease or immunosuppression may develop progressive MAC lung disease. M intracellulare is responsible for 40% of such infections in immunocompetent patients. Distribution: MAC is ubiquitous in distribution. It has been isolated from fresh water and salt water worldwide. The common environmental sources of MAC include the following:* Aerosolized water* Piped hot water systems (including household and hospital water supplies). Bathrooms. House dust. Soil. Birds. Farm animals. Cigarette components (eg, tobacco, filters, paper ). Diagnosis: In patients who may have pulmonary infection with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), diagnostic testing includes acid-fast bacillus (AFB) staining and culture of sputum specimens. If disseminated MAC (DMAC) infection is suspected, culture specimens should also include blood and urine. Treatment: In general, MAC infection is treated with 2 or 3 antimicrobials for at least 12 months. Commonly used first-line drugs include macrolides (clarithromycin or azithromycin), ethambutol, and rifamycins (rifampin, rifabutin). Aminoglycosides, such as streptomycin and amikacin, are also used as additional agents. MAC lymphadenitis in children is treated with surgical excision of the affected lymph node. Also know about runyon classification: RUNYON CLASSIFICATIONThe Runyon classification of nontuberculous mycobacteria based on the rate of growth, production of yellow pigment and whether this pigment was produced in the dark or only after exposure to light. The nontuberculous mycobacteria are divided into four groups. The first three groups are classified as \"Slowly growing Mycobacteria\". RUNYON CLASSIFICATIONRunyon I organisms (photochromogens). Slow growing, and produce a yellow-orange pigment when exposed to light. Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium asiaticum, and Mycobacterium simiae. Runyon II organisms (scotochromogens). Slow-growing and produce a yellow-orange pigment regardless of whether they are grown in the dark or the light. Mycobacterium Gordonae and Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium szulgai. Runyon III organisms (nonchromogens). Slow-growing and never produce pigment, regardless of culture conditions. Mycobacterium ahum and Mycobacterium intracellulare (together known as the MAI complex). Runyon fV organisms. Rapid growing for mycobacteria (colonies in 5 days). They do not produce pigment.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Enterohemorrhagic ESCHERICHIA COLIAt least six distinct \"pathotypes\" of intestinal pathogenic E. coli exist: o Enteropathoaenic E. coli [Entcroadherent E. colil. It causes diarrhoea in infants and children usually occuring as institutional out breaks. It does not produce enterotoxin, nor are they invasive. They adhere to the mucosa of small intestine and cause disruption of the brush border microvilli. These strains can be identified by their adhesion to HEP - 2 cells. o Enterotoxigenic E. coli. It causes traveller's diarrhoea [ETEC is the most common cause of traveller's diarrhea). It produces enterotoxins. They can produce heat labile toxin (LT) or heat stable toxin or both. Toxin production alone may not lead to illness. The strain should first be able to adhere to intestinal mucosa. This adhesiveness is medicated by fimbrial or colonisation factor antigen (CFA). o Enteroinvasive E. coli. They themselves resemble shigella and their infection resembles shigellosis (remember: shiga like toxin is elaborated by enterohemorrhagic E. coli). They produce mild diarrhoea to frank dvsentry and occur in adult as well as in children. They have been termed enteroinvasive because they have the capacity to invade intestinal epithelial cells in vivo and penetrate He. La or HEP - 2 cells in tissue culture. This ability of penetration is plasmid determined which codes for outer membrane antigens called the Hirulence marker antigen\" (VMA). The detection of plasmid can be diagnostic. For laboratory diagnosis of EIEC, the sereny test used to be employed. These strains are non motile, do not ferment lactose or ferment it late with acid without producing any gas. o Enterohemorrhagic E. coli or verotoxigenic E. coli. These strains produce verocytotoxin (VT) or shiga like toxin (SLT). They can cause mild diarrhoea to fatal hemorrhagic colitis. Shiga like toxin belongs to class ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs). It inhibits protein synthesis by inhibiting ribosomal function. This toxin also acts on vascular endothelium to promote the synthesis of coagulation factor VIII, v. WF - Platelet aggregation. They can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome particularly in young children and the elderly. O 157: H 7 is the most prominent serotype of EHEC, associated with HUS, but 06, 026, 055, 091, 0103, 0111, 0113 and OX3 have also been associated with this syndrome. The primary target for V. T is vascular endothelium. The typical EHEC is serotype O157: H7 which does not ferement sorbital unlike majority of E. coli (but Harrison writes that few species of this serotype can ferment sorbital). Some other serotype like O26: H1 also belongs to this group. Laboratory diagnosis of VIEC diarrhea is established by demonstration of the bacilli or VT in feces directly or in culture. o Enteroaggrecative E. coli}# In developing countries and young children.# Can cause traveller's diarrhea and persistent diarrhea.# In vitro, thev exhibit a \"stacked - brick\" adherence pattern on Hep - 2 cells. o Diffusely adherent E. coli# Enteroaggregative E. coli forms a low molecular weight heat stable enterotoxin EAST -1 (enteroaggregative heat stable enterotoxin -1).",

Although C jejuni grows well at 36-37degC, incubation at 42degC prevents growth of most of the other bacteria present in feces, thus simplifying the identification of C jejuni.

Some microorganisms like acidic or alkaline environments:-Acidophiles: Microorganisms that grow best in acidic media pH 2-5. Eg., Fungi & Helicobacter pylori.-Alkallphiles: Microorganisms that grow best in alkaline media pH. 8. 5-11. Eg., Vibrio cholera (the only alkaliphilic human pathogen).-Neutrophiles: Bacteria that can live an multiply within the range of pH 5-8. Most bacteria are neutrophiles. [?]pH: o. Most medically important bacteria grow at neutral or slightly alkaline pH (7. 2 to 7. 6). o. Very few bacteria grow below pH 4. o. Lactobacilli grow in acidic pH; cholera vibrio grow in alkaline pH. o. Growth media includes chemical buffers to prevent acid production. o. Lactobacillus bacteria, which are an important part of the normal microbiota of the vagina, can tolerate acidic environments at pH values 3. 5-6. 8 and also contribute to the acidity of the vagina (pH of 4, except at the onset of menstruation) through their metabolic production of lactic acid. o. Vagina's acidity plays an important role in inhibiting other microbes that are less tolerant of acidity. o. Foods are preserved by acids produced by bacterial fermentation. o. Growth is poor below pH 6. 0 & above 7. 8. Growth stops below pH 5. 0 & above 9. 0o. Lactobacillus species grows at acidic pH & known as acidophiles. Vibrios are sensitive to acid but tolerate alkali. [?]. Physical growth factors: o1-Acidity (pH requirements):-Pathogenic bacteria grow best at neutral or biological pH which is typically between pH 6. 8 to pH 7. 4.-Fungi such as yeasts & molds prefer slightly more acidic conditions and grow best between pH 5 to pH 6.-The pathogen Helicobacter pylori is able to survive with pH of the stomach by producing urease. So it is acidophilic bacterium.-On the other extreme, bacteria that prefer alkaline (basic) conditions are known as alkaliphiles. Ex., Vibrio cholerae (prefers pH 9). [?]. Acidophiles or acidophilic organisms are those that thrive under highly acidic conditions (at pH 2. 0 or below). o. These organisms can be found in different branches of the tree of life, including Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya.-Acidobacterium, a phylum of Bacteria-Acidithiobacillales, an order of Proteobacteria e. g. A. ferrooxidans, A. thiooxidans-Thiobacillus prosperus, T. acidophilus, T. organovorus, T. cuprinus-Acetobacter aceti, a bacterium that produces acetic acid (vinegar) from the oxidation of ethanol.-Alicyciobacillus, a genus of bacteria that can contaminate fruit juices.-Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium found in the human stomach. Other Options[?]. Neutrophile bacteria:-They grow optimally at a pH within one or two pH units of the neutral pH of 7.-Most familiar bacteria, like Escherichia coli, staphylococci, and Salmonella spp. are neutrophiles and do not fare well in the acidic pH of the stomach.-However, there are pathogenic strains of E coli, S. typhi, and other species of intestinal pathogens that are much more resistant to stomach acid. In comparison, fungi thrive at slightly acidic pH values of 5. 0-6. 0. [?]. Alkaiiphile Bacteria:-At the other end of the spectrum are alkaliphiles, microorganisms that grow best at pH between 8. 0 and 10. 5. Vibrio cholerae, the pathogenic agent of cholera, grows best at the slightly basic pH of 8. 0; it can survive pH values of 11. 0 but is inactivated by the acid of the stomach.-When it comes to survival at high pH, the bright pink archaean Natronobacterium, found in the soda lakes of the African Rift Valley, may hold the record at a pH of 10. 5.-Extreme alkaliphiles have adapted to their harsh environment through evolutionary modification of lipid and protein structure and compensatory mechanisms to maintain the proton motive force in an alkaline environment.-E. g., the alkaiiphile Bacillus firmus derives the energy for transport reactions and motility from a Na+ ion gradient rather than a proton motive force.-Many enzymes from alkaliphiles have a higher isoelectric point, due to an increase in the number of basic amino acids, than homologous enzymes from neutrophiles.",

        "exp": "Ans. D. Cholera gravis. Explanation. Vibrio cholera. They are curve (comma-shaped) gram negative, bacilli that are actively motile (single polar flagellum). Classification: Based on salt requirement. Halophilic vibrios: They can't grow in the absence of salt. They can tolerate salt at 7-10%. examples are V. parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus, V. vulnificus. Non-halophilic vibrios: They can grow without salt but 1% salt is needed. Examples are V. cholerae, V. mimicus. Heiberg classification (1934)EIGHT GROUPS based on fermentation of mannose, arabinose and sucrose. V. cholerae placed in GROUP I. Gardner and Venkatraman classification. Based on serogrouping, biotyping, serotyping and phage typing. Pathogenesis of cholera: Toxin mediated. Mode of transmission: Ingestion of contaminated water and food. Infective dose: extremely acid labile, hence high infective dose is needed to bypass gastric >> barrier (108 bacilli). Factors promoting transmission: Hypochlorhydria, use of antacids. The bacilli penetrates mucous layer - Adheres to the epithelium - Cholera toxin is produced - Toxin has fragment B and fragment A - Fragment B is binding fragment, that binds to GM1. Ganglioside receptors - Fragment A, causes ADP-ribosylation of G protein - Upregulates the activity of adenylate cyclase - Intracellular accumulation of camp - water moves out due to osmolality, which leads to watery diarrhea - Loss of fluids and electrolytes leads to shock. Clinical features of cholera: Asymptomatic infection (75% cases). Mild diarrhea or cholera (20% cases). Sudden onset of explosive and life threatening diarrhea (Cholera gravis, in 5% of cases). Watery diarrhea, rice water stools, vomiting, fever usually absent, muscle cramps due to electrolyte imbalance. Complications of cholera: Loss of body weight by. Symptoms<5%Increased thirst5-10%*. Postural hypotension*. Weakness*. Tachycardia*. Decreased skin turgor>10%Renal failure (acute tubular necrosis) and fluid loss results in:*. Oliguria*. Weak or absent pulse*. Sunken eyes*. Sunken fontanelles in infants*. Wrinkled skin*. Somnolence*. Coma. Epidemiology. History of pandemics: Home land is DELTA REGION of Ganges and Brahmaputra in West Bengal. And Bangladesh. First 6 pandemics caused by classical biotype of V. cholerae, had spread from Bengal to all over world. Seventh pandemic-only pandemic originated outside india(in Indonesia), caused by El Tor biotype. 0139 (Bengal strain) -- first isolated in Chennai in 1992. It was not agglutinated by antisera (01 to 0138), hence designated as 0139. It is capsulated, invasive causes bacteremia and extraintestinal manifestations. Cholera is a notifiable disease. National reference center for cholera is located at national institute of cholera and enteric diseases (NICED), Kolkata. Reservoir: Humans. Source: Asymptomatic cases or carriers. Carriers: (1) Incubatory carriers (1-2 days), (2) Convalescent carriers (2-3 weeks), (3) Contact or healthy carriers (<10 days), (4) Chronic carriers. Factors determining severity: People with O blood group, malnutrition, lack of preexisting immunity. Habitat: Natural habitat of coastal sea salt water and brackish estuaries, associated with crustaceans, copepods, crabs, plankton. Lab diagnosis. Specimens: Watery stool or rectal swab for carriers. Transport media: Venkataramana Ramakrishna media, Cary-Blair medium. Direct microscopy: Gram-negative rods, short curved, comma shaped (fish in stream appearance). Hanging drop demonstrates darting motility. Culture: Enrichment broth: Alkaline peptone water, Monsur's taurocholate tellurite peptone water. Selective media: Bile salt agar, Monsur's GTTT agar, TCBS agar (yellow colonies). Mac. Conkey agar-translucent non-lactose fermenting colonies. Culture smear and motility testing to be done. Biochemical identification: Catalase and oxidase positive. ICUT: Indole (+), Citrate (+/-), Urease (-), TSI: A/A, gas (-), H2S (-). Cholera red reaction is positive. String test is positive. Salt tolerance test is positive. Ferments glucose and sucrose Biotyping: To differentiate Classical and El Tor Serogrouping: To differentiate 01 and 0139. Serotyping: To differentiate Ogawa, Inaba, Hikojima serotypes of serogroup 01. Treatment. Fluid replacement: ORS solution, ringer's lactate. Antibiotics has minor role, WHO recommends antibiotic use only in severely dehydrated cases. Adults: doxycycline or tetracycline Children/pregnancy erythromycin/azithromycin.

Enteroadherent E. colil# It causes watery diarrhoea in infants and children usually occuring as institutional out breaks.# It does not produce enterotoxin, nor are they invasive. They adhere to the mucosa of small intestine and cause disruption of the brush border microvilli.# These strains can be identified by their adhesion to HEP - 2 cells. 2) Enterotoxigenic E. coli# It causes traveller's diarrhoea [ETEC is the most common cause of traveller's diarrhea).# ETEC is the most frequent bacterial cause of diarrhea in infant and children of developing countries, especially in tropical countries.# It produces enterotoxins. They can produce heat labile toxin (LT) or heat stable toxin or both.# Toxin production alone may not lead to illness. The strain should first be able to adhere to intestinal mucosa. This adhesiveness is medicated by funbrial or colonisation factor antigen (CFA).# It is non-invasive (does not invade mucosa). 3) Enteroinvasive E. coli# They themselves resemble shigella and their infection resembles shigellosis (remember: shiga like toxin is elaborated by enterohemorrhagic E. coli).# They produce mild diarrhoea to frank dysentry and occur in adult as well as in children.# They have been termed enteroinvasive because they have the capacity to invade intestinal epithelial cells in vivo and penetrate He. La or HEP - 2 cells in tissue culture.# This ability of penetration is plasmid determined which codes for outer membrane antigens called the 'virulence marker antigen' (VMA). The detection of plasmid can be diagnostic.# For laboratory diagnosis of EIEC, the sereny test used to be employed.# These strains are non motile, do not ferment lactose or ferment it late with acid without producing any gas. 4) Enterohemorrhagic E. coli or verotoxigenic E. coli# These strains produce verocytotoxin (VT) or shiga like toxin (SLT)# They can cause mild diarrhoea to fatal hemorrhagic colitis.# Shiga like toxin belongs to class ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs). It inhibits protein synthesis by inhibiting ribosomal function.# This toxin also acts on vascular endothelium to promote the synthesis of coagulation factor VIII, v. WF - Platelet aggregation.# They can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome particularly in young children and the elderly.# O 157: H7 is the most prominent serotype of EHEC, associated with HUS, but 06, 026, 055, 091, 0103, 0111, 0113 and OX3 have also been associated with this syndrome.# The primary target for V. T is vascular endothelium.# The typical EHEC is serotype 0157: H7 which does not ferement sorbital unlike majority of E. coll Therefore sorbitol Mac Conkey media (a modified Mac Conkey media containing sorbitol in place of lactase) is used for EHEC 0157: H7.# Some other serotype like 026: HI also belongs to this group.# Laboratory diagnosis of VIEC diarrhea is established by demonstration of the bacilli or VT in feces directly or in culture. 5) Enteroaggregative E. coli# In developing countries and young children.# Can cause traveller's diarrhea (2nd me cause ofter ETEC) and persistent diarrhea.# In vitro, they exhibit a \"stacked - brick\" adherence pattern on Hep - 2 cells.# Enteroaggregative E. coli forms a low molecular weight heat stable enterotoxin EAST - 1 (enteroaggregative heat stable enterotoxin - 1).",

Water and electrolyte replacement are primary management mechanisms, while oral tetracycline may help reduce stool output.

These streptococci undergo complete hemolysis of sheep red blood cells in agar and therefore shows a clear zone around colonies. Hemolysis is caused by the enzyme hemolysins. a Hemolysis. Incomplete hemolysis producing greenish discolouration around colonies. g Hemolvsis. Non hemolysis b hemolytic streptococcib. Hemolytic streptococci are further classified into lancefied groups (A-H K-V) based on the antigenic carbohydrate in the cell wall. Group A, B, C, D and G are the groups most commonly associated with human infections. Group A streptococci (streptococcus pyogenic) is responsible for a wide range of superficial and deep infections and are further classified according to M protein an antiphagocytic fibrillar molecule that interferes with deposition of complement C3b. Group A streptococci is also classified using bacitracin sensitivity test: - BACITRACIN SENSITIVITY TESTThe bacitracin sensitivity test is useful for the differentiation of B hemolytic Group A streptococci from b hemolytic non Group A streptococci. This is important because most streptococcal diseases are caused by Group A streptococci. \"Streptococcus A (pyogenes) is bacitracin sensitive while streptococcus agalactiae is bacitracin resistant. CAMP TESTThis test is used for the presumptive identification of Group B streptococcus (streptococcus agalactiae) and to differentiate it from streptococcus pyogenes group A. Group B is the only B hemolytic streptococcus which yields a positive CAMP test. This test detects a diffusible heat stable extracellular protein produced by Group B streptococcus that enhances the hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes by staphylococcus aureus. The CAMP factor acts synergistically with the beta hemolysin produced by staphylococcus aureus to induce enhanced hemolysis of sheep or bovine RBL. A known hemolytic strain of S. aureus is streaked in a straight line across the centre of the sheep blood agar plate. The test material is streaked in a straight line perpendicular to staphylococcus aureus streak but without touching it. The plate is incubated at 37deg C for 18-24 hours. A positive test for CAMP factor appears as arrowhead hemolysis between the junction of growth of staphylococcus aureus and Group B streptococcus. There is no enhanced or arrowhead hemolysis if the test isolate is not Group B streptococcus. OPTOCHINTESTOptochin sensitivity test is used to differentiate pneumococcus from other a hemolytic streptococci. a hemolytic streptococci may be pathogens such as streptococcus pneumonia or they may be a part of the flora of the upper respiratory tract i. e. viridans streptococci. Streptococcus pneumonia is sensitive to optochin therefore it does not grow around the optochin disc while bacterias that are optochin resistant will be unaffected. Bile solubility test * Bile solubility test is used to distinguish streptococcus pneumoniae from other d hemolytic streptococci. Bile will selectively lyse colonies of streptococcus pneumoniae while other streptococci are immune to bile's activity. When a bile salt such as deoxycholate is added directly to streptococcus pneumoniae growing on an agar plate or in a broth culture the bacteria will lyse and the area becomes clear. Other 5 hemolytic streptococci are resistant to (not lysed by bile) and will stay viable or turbid. Classification of Streptococci",

        "exp": "Atypical pneumonia\" is an old classification used for respiratory disease that is not lobar and is not \"typical. \" That is, it does not include pneumonia caused by pneumococcus, Klebsiella, Haemophilus, or b-hemolytic streptococci that results in a typical lobular infiltrate. In recent years, the atypical pneumonias have become much more frequent than pneumococcal pneumonia. They are characterized by a slower onset with headache, joint pain, fever, and signs of an acute upper respiratory infection. There are usually no signs of acute respiratory distress, but patients report malaise and fatigue. The most common cause of atypical pneumonia is M. pneumoniae. A quick test for M. pneumoniae infection is cold agglutinins. The test may lack both sensitivity and specificity, but it is rapid and readily available compared with culture of M. pneumoniae or specific antibody formation. In certain age groups (men over 55 years old), Legionnaires disease must be ruled out. While direct microscopy, culture, and serology are available, the detection of Legionella antigen in respiratory secretions is the most sensitive test available. Campylobacter pneumoniae may also cause respiratory infection particularly in, but not limited to, children. Diagnosis is best made by growing these energy-defective bacteria in tissue culture such as He. La cells. Serology is usually not helpful. During the winter months, Bordetella infection may be quite prevalent, particularly in those patients whose immunizations are not updated. Adult Bordetella infection may not present with typical whooping cough symptoms and must be differentiated from other forms of acute bronchitis by culture on specific media or direct fluorescent microscopy. Direct microscopy of sputum is an important preliminary test for sputum and other exudate specimens. One needs to be aware that the information obtained is limited in interpretation. No specific identity of a microorganism can be determined by gram staining and even mixtures of bacteria can be inferred. On the other hand, examination of gram stains may provide enough information for the physician to make immediate decisions on treatment and other management that may be modified by future laboratory results. Fluorescent Ab detection of an organism in sputum is more specific than gram staining. Here specific known Abs (single or in a mixture) are used to identify organisms present.",

This disease has characteristic histopathology, and membranous plaques can be seen in the colon by endoscopy. Pseudomembranous enterocolitis and antibiotic-associated diarrhea are caused by an anaerobic gram-positive rod, C. difficile. It has been recently shown that C. difficile produces a protein toxin with a molecular weight of about 250, 000. The \"toxin\" is, in fact, two toxins, toxin A and toxin B. Both toxins are always present in fecal samples, but there is approximately 1000 times more toxin B than toxin A. Toxin A has enterotoxic activity-that is, it elicits a positive fluid response in ligated rabbit ileal loops-whereas toxin B appears to be primarily a cytotoxin. The Bacteroides and clostridium organisms are anaerobic and can be found in the intestinal tract. Also, these would be killed by the antibiotics given to the patient.

A gram positive bacillus (Ref: Harrison 19/e p978, 18/e p1189-1190: Ananthanarayan 9/e p239)A 10-year old child presented with severe sore throat and a grey pseudomembrane over pharynx and tonsils. The clinical features are strongly suggestive of a diagnosis of diphtheria, caused by Corynebacterium diphtheria, a gram-positive bacillus. Respiratory Diphtheria (Caused by Corynebacterium diphtheria): Pseudomembrane in diphtheria is tightly adherent to the underlying tissues. The diphtheritic pseudomembrane is gray or whitish and sharply demarcatedQ. Diagnosis requires the isolation of C. diphtheria or the histopathologic isolation of compatible gram-positive organismsQ. The pseudomembranous lesion is most often located in the tonsillopharyngeal region. QRespiratory Diphtheria. Clinical Features: The clinical diagnosis of diphtheria is based on: Constellation of sore throat. QAdherent tonsillar, pharyngeal, or nasal pseudomembranous lesions. QLow-grade fever. QOccasionally, weakness, dysphagia, headache, and voice change are the initial manifestationsQ. Neck edema and difficulty breathing are seen in more advanced cases and carry a poor prognosisQ. The systemic manifestations of diphtheria stem from the effects of diphtheria toxin and include weakness as a result of neurotoxicity and cardiac arrhythmias or congestive heart failure due to myocarditisQ. The pseudomembranous lesion is most often located in the tonsillopharyngeal regionQ. The diphtheritic pseudomembrane is gray or whitish and sharply demarcatedQ. Pseudomembrane in diphtheria is tightly adherent to the underlying tissuesQ. Less commonly, the lesions are detected in the larynx, nares, and trachea or bronchial passages. Large pseudomembranes are associated with severe disease and a poor prognosisQ. A few patients develop swelling of the tonsils and present with \"bull-neck\" diphtheria, which results from massive edema of the submandibular and paratracheal region and is further characterized by foul breath, thick speech, and stridorous breathingQ. Unlike the exudative lesion associated with streptococcal pharyngitis, the pseudomembrane in diphtheria is tightly adherent to the underlying tissuesQ. Diagnosis: Attempts to dislodge the membrane may cause bleeding. Hoarseness suggests laryngeal diphtheria, in which laryngoscopy may be diagnostically helpful. In addition, diagnosis requires the isolation of C. diphtheria or the histopathologic isolation of compatible grampositive organismsQ.",
