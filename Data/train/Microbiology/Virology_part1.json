        "exp": "Rabies is caused by a rhabdovirus, a minus-sense, single-stranded, non-segmented RNA virus with an enveloped, bullet-shaped virion). The virus infects a wide range of warm-blooded animals, including humans. The virus is widely disseminated within the infected animals, with high levels in saliva. If the animal is captured or killed, examination of its brain for rabies virus can be done in time to determine whether rabies prophylaxis is necessary. The best means to prevent rabies begins with scrupulous wound care, including washing and probing for any foreign bodies (e.g., broken teeth) in the wound. If the animal is not available, or tests positive for rabies, and if the person has not been immunized with rabies vaccine, the treatment of choice is to give human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIg) plus rabies vaccine at separate sites (d). The HRIg should be infused into the wound and the remainder given as a deep IM injection. After onset of symptoms, neither of these should be given. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (a) may be given as part of wound care to prevent bacterial infection, but they will not prevent rabies. Acyclovir (b) and ribavirin (c), regardless of dosage or route of administration, have no role in rabies prophylaxis.

PrP can exist in a variety of different conformations each of which seems to specify a particular disease phenotype.Prion disease: -Prion are fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by transmissible proteins and are characterized by spongiform changes, astrocytic gliomas and neuronal loss from the deposition of insoluble protein aggregates in neural cells.Prions are caused by human prion related protein (PrP) {a glycoprotein rich in a helix).PrP is endogenous to the host and in most people, the PrP protein folds normally leaving the person healthy.Rarely, a mutation in the PrP gene will allow the protein to be made incorrectly and it will fold incorrectly making a PrPsc prion. (Which is a glycoprotein rich in b sheets).These PrPsc prions when exposed to PrP, which is in the process of folding will encourage that PrP to fold incorrectly too, thus creating another PrPsc.While PrP can be processed and cleaned out of a cell once it has been used, PrPsc is shaped differently enough so that it can't be cleaned out and it aggregates inside the cell. These PrPsc aggregates quickly builds up into plaques destroying the nervous tissue.Thus a pathological prion protein serves as the templates for the conformational transformation of normal PrP into PrPsc.Remember PrP - made up of a helix? PrPsc - Made up of b sheet QPathogenesis of Prion's diseaseNormal endogenous human protein (human prion related protein)(PrP)|It is a glycoprotein rich in a helix and it folds normally|Mutation in the PrP protein|Folds improperly and result in PrPsc protein {It is a glycoprotein rich in b sheets)|PrPsc comes in contact with PrP|PrP too will fold incorrectly resulting in more PrPsc|Aggregation of PrPsc|Destruction of nervous tissue Prion disease",

The duration between primary infection infection and progression to clinical disease averages about 10 years. In untreated cases, death usually occurs within 2 years after the onset of clinical symptoms. Following primary infection, there is a 4- to 11- day period between mucosal infection and initial viremia. (The viremia is detectable for about 8-12 weeks) An acute mononucleosis-like sydrome develops in many patients (50-75%) 3-6 weeks after primary infection (There is significant drop in numbers of circulating CD4 T cells at this early time) An immune response to HIV occurs 1 week to 3 months after infection, plasma viremia drops, and levels of CD4 cells rebound. The t 1/2 (half-life) of virus in plasma is about 6 hours. The virus Life-cycle from the time of infectionn of a cell to the production of new progeny that infect the next cell averages 2.6 days. CD4 lymphocytes are the major target responsible for virus production and once productively infected the half-life of a CD4 cell is about 1.6 days.

Isolated strains of influenza virus are named after the virus type (influenza A, B, or C) as well as the host and location of initial isolation, the year of isolation, and the antigenic designation of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are glycoproteins under separate genetic control, and because of this they can and do vary independently. The changes in these antigens are responsible for the antigenic drift characteristic of these viruses. The paramyxoviruses include several important human pathogens (mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus). Both paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses possess an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is a structural component of the virion and produces the initial RNA. Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) are not related to the paramyxoviruses. They are 150-nm single-stranded RNA viruses. There are 2 antigen groups, A and B, which play no role in diagnosis and treatment. While the overall mortality is 0.5%, at-risk groups may be 25 to 35% mortality if untreated.

        "exp": "Advances in the serodiagnosis of viral hepatitis have been dramatic, and the findings of specific viral antigens have led to further elucidation of the course of infections. The \"Australia antigen,\" discovered in 1960, was first renamed hepatitis-associated antigen (HAA) and then, finally, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). It appears in the blood early after infection, before onset of acute illness, and persists through early convalescence. HBsAg usually disappears within 4 to 6 months after the start of clinical illness except in the case of chronic carriers.Hepatitis B 37 antigen (HBeAg) appears during the early acute phase and disappears before HBsAg is gone, although it may persist in the chronic carrier. Persons who are HBeAg-positive have higher titers of HBV and therefore are at a higher risk of transmitting the disease. HBeAg has a high correlation with DNA polymerase activity.The hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) is found within the nuclei of infected hepatocytes and not generally in the peripheral circulation except as an integral component of the Dane particle. The antibody to this antigen, anti-HBc, is present at the beginning of clinical illness. As long as there is ongoing HBV replication, there will be high titers of anti-HBc. During the early convalescent phase of an HBV infection, anti-HBc may be the only detectable serologic marker (window phase) if HBsAg is negative and anti-HBsAg has not appeared.",

In an isomer, there is the same molecular formula but different arrangement. The DNA of herpesviruses is large (molecular weight = 90-150 x 106), encoding at least 100 proteins. There is little sequence homology in the DNA among the various members of the family (30% to 50%), Except between herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and between human herpes 6 and 7. Morphologically, however, they are indistinguishable. The nucleocapsid of herpesviruses has icosahedral symmetry. The lipid envelope, which is derived from the nuclear membrane of the infected cell during budding, contains viral glycoproteins. The area between the capsid and the envelope is the tegument, and it contains several viral proteins. Poxviruses have double-stranded, linear DNA.

An EM examination of stool for astrovirus (d) would not likely be available in most clinical settings, although EM can also reveal Rotavirus, Norovirus and other caliciviruses, and adenovirus. Enteroviruses, although they infect cells of the intestinal tract, do not usually cause acute gastroenteritis. A DFA for enterovirus on intestinal biopsy (b) would not likely be helpful in establishing the etiologic agent. See the table in the answer to question 114 for additional information.",

Only one serotype of EBV has been recognized, although molecular methods have reorganized a number of genotypes of EBV.Infectious mononucleosis is an acute disease most commonly seen in younger people. It is characterized by a proliferation of lymphocytes, lymph node enlargement, pharyngitis, fatigue, and fever. Infection in young children is usually either asymptomatic or characteristic of an acute upper respiratory infection. Diagnosis is usually made by a positive heterophil test. Heterophil antibodies are those that occur in one species (human) and react with antigens of a different species. The heterophil test may be insensitive (30 to 60%) in children. Definitive diagnosis is made by detection of antibodies to EBV components.EBV causes a variety of other syndromes including Burkitt's lymphoma, the most common childhood cancer in Africa, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, commonly seen in China.Similar mononucleosis-like diseases are caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite. CMV causes fewer than 10% of infectious mononucleosis-like diseases. CMV \"mono\" is primarily characterized by fatigue. Congenital infection with CMV almost always causes serious sequelae, such as retardation and hearing loss. T. gondii also causes a variety of clinical problems, among them encephalitis in AIDS patients and food poisoning from the ingestion of raw meat. Although CMV and T. gondii are relatively rare causes of infectious mononucleosis, they must be ruled out, particularly when EBV tests are nonreactive.",
