        "exp": "Ans. D i. e. Virus Molluscum contagiosum (MC) It is a viral infection of the skin or occasionally of the mucous membranes, sometimes called water was. It is caused by a DNA poxvirus called the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). MCV has no nonhuman-animal reservoir (infecting only humans). There are four types of MCV, MCV-1 to -4; MCV-1 is the most prevalent and MCV-2 is seen usually in adults. The virus that causes molluscum is spread from person to person by touching the affected skin. The virus may also be spread by touching a surface with the virus on it, such as a towel, clothing, or toys. Molluscum can be spread from one person to another by sexual contact. This common viral disease has a higher incidence in children, sexually active adults, and those who are immunodeficient, and the infection is most common in children aged one to ten years old. MC can affect any area of the skin but is most common on the trunk of the body, arms, groin, and legs. It is spread through direct contact or shared items such as clothing or towels.",

        "exp": "Bacteria will die as it lacks methylase Bacterias are susceptible to attack by viruses known as bacte- riophages. Bacterias have developed their defense mechanism to protect themselves. from the bacteriophages. The system that bacterias possese against the phage viruses is the restriction modification system? This system consists of restriction endonuclease enzyme and a methylase enzyme. Each bacterial species and strains have their own combination of restriction and methylating enzymes i. e., restriction modification system is species specific Restriction enzyme These are enzymes present in baeteria that recognize specific base sequences in the D. N. A. and, cut the DNA at that site (restriction site). - A restriction enzyme acts as biochemical scissors and are therefore called restriction endonuclease. Bacterias use this enzyme in defense against phage viruses (bacteriophages) When a phage virus infects bacteria it inses its DNA into bacteria so that it gets replicated The restriction enzyme prevents this replication by cutting the D. N. A of the phage virus into many pieces. - When a strain of bacterias lacking restriction enzyme is infected with phage virus most viruses can initiate a successful infection - When the same strain contains a restriction enzyme, however, the probability of successful infection decreases The presence of additional restrictive enzymes has multiplicative effect. A bacteria with four to. five restriction enzyme would be viually impregnable. The bacterial cell uses the restriction enzyme to cut the invading DNA of the virus at a specific site. This prevents the virus replication. But bacterial DNA will also contain sites that could be cleaved by the restriction enzyme. How is the bacterial cell protected. from auto destruction by restriction endonuclease???. Restriction enzyme usually occur in combination with one or two modification enzymes (DNN- methylasetransferase) that protects the cells own DNA from cleavage by the restriction enzytne Modification enzymes recognize the same DNA sequences as the restriction enzymes that they accompany, but, instead of cleaving the sequence they methylate one of the bases in each of the DNA strands. The methyl groups protrude in to the major groove of DNA at the binding site and prevents the restriction enzyme from acting upon it. \"So the viral DNA is restricted in the bacterial cell by restriction enzymes and the bacterial DNA is modified by the methylase and is provided protection from its own restriction enzyme\" -It is impoant to note that the restriction modification system is species specific i. e., each bacterial species has its own restriction modification enzyme. It is significant because the restriction enzyme may kill any virus that invade the bacteria but the methylase enzyme can only protect that paicular bacteria from lysis because it will recognize those bacterial DNA as host and protect it against restriction endonuclease. If a bacteria acquires new restriction endonuclease it would also lyse bacterial DNA because the bacteria does not have the species specific methylase enzyme to protect its DNA from the newly acquired restriction endonuclease.",

T. cruzi is commonly transmitted to humans and other mammals by an insect vector, the blood-sucking insects of the subfamily Triatominae (family Reduviidae) most commonly species belonging to the Triatoma, Rhodnius, and Panstrongylus genera. The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion and organ transplantation, ingestion of food contaminated with parasites, and from a mother to her fetus. In the early, acute stage, symptoms are mild and usually produce no more than local swelling at the site of infection. The initial acute phase is responsive to antiparasitic treatments, with 60-90% cure rates. After 4-8 weeks, individuals with active infections enter the chronic phase of Chagas disease that is asymptomatic for 60-80% of chronically infected individuals through their lifetime. The currently available antiparasitic treatments for Chagas disease are benznidazole and nifuimox, which can cause temporary side effects in many patients including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.",

        "exp": "Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), an impoant cause of traveler's diarrhea, produces a toxin that activates intestinal adenylate or guanylate cyclase. Consequently, the intestinal mucosa overexpresses c. AMP, resulting in a mild and self-limited secretory diarrhea. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) does not express a toxin, but is seen to cluster over the colonic mucosa in some individuals. Although occasionally found in patients with chronic diarrhea, no clear mechanism for mucosal pathophysiology has been determined for EAEC. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), classically associated with strain O157: H7 and present in undercooked hamburgers, expresses a Shiga-like toxin that causes bloody diarrhea and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) does not express a toxin, but rather is pathogenic through its capacity to invade the colonic mucosa and evoke an inflammatory response. The resulting dysentery-like inflammatory diarrhea generally necessitates vigilant hydration, but no antibiotics are indicated. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013). Chapter 15.

Laboratory diagnosis of toxoplasmosis Laboratory diagnosis can be made by Microscopic demonstration of the parasite Isolation of the parasite by animal inoculation or tissue culture. Polymerase chain reaction Serology The most common method of laboratory diagnosis Persons should initially be tested for the presence of Toxoplasma specific IgG antibodies to determine their immune status. A positive IgG titre indicates infection with the organism at sometime ( recent or past). Then an IgG positive person should have an IgM test. A negative test essentially excludes recent infection. However, a positive IgM test does not always mean a recent infection because toxoplasma specific IgM antibodies may persist for months to year following primary infection. Therefore:? Negative IgM with positive IgG always means a past infection. Positive IgM with positive IgG indicates possibility of recent infection, but not with 100% surety. It may or may not be recent infection. To differentiate between recent and past infection, IgG avidity test is used. It is woh noting here that a third situation is also possible when IgM test is positive but IgG test is negative. In this situation a second sample should be taken after 2-4 weeks and should be tested:? If the second sample is positive for IgG and IgM, it indicates that the first sample was taken early in the disease when IgG was not yet developed. If the second sample is still negative for IgG with positive IgM, it indicates false positive IgM test.

Pneumatocoeles are found much more often in children than in adults. They are seen paicularly in infants and children with staphylococcal pneumonia. However, they have also been described in pneumonia due to other micro-organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella, Hemophilus influenzae, and in measles pneumonitis. On chest radiographs, they appear as thin-walled, rounded radiolucencies in areas of pneumonic consolidation. They can be single or multiple. As the surrounding consolidation resolves, the pneumatocoeles become more apparent and/or enlarge. Thus, they are usually seen during the resolution stage of pneumonitis.

With disease progression, there is tissue necrosis, granulation tissue deposition, and scar formation, leading to lacrimal duct obstruction and distoion of the eyelids. With the loss of an adequate tear system, the cornea becomes vulnerable to dehydration and opacification. Also, the vigorous inflammatory response can directly involve the cornea, with resulting opacity. In developed countries, chlamydial eye infections are often transmitted venereally rather than by flies, and may cause conjunctivitis in the newborn and in sexually active young adults. Ref: Ray C.

The cyst is rapidly digested by the acidic-pH gastric secretion releasing bradyzoites or sporozoites. These bradyzoites or sporozoites enter the small - intestinal epithelium and tranform into rapidly dividing tachyzoites (endozoites). The tachyzoites can infect and replicate in all mammalian cells except red blood cells. Tissue cysts containing many bradyzoite develop 7-10 days after systemic tachyzoite infection. These tissue cysts occur in a variety of host organs but persist principally within the CNS and muscle. Feline stage (sexual stage) This stage takes place in the definitive host (cat) This cycle is associated with formation of oocysts, which are excreted in cat feces.

Streptococcus agalactiae (group B strep) and Escherichia coli (not an answer choice) are the most common causes in neonates up to 1 month of age. The next most reasonable response would have been Listeria monocytogenes, another, though less common, cause of neonatal meningitis. Most cases of meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae occur in children between 6 months and 6 years of age, 90% of which result from the capsular type b strain. It has become much less prevalent since the H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine has been routinely administered to infants. Neisseria meningitidis is the most common cause of epidemic meningitis. The two organisms most often associated with sporadic cases are Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae (the most common cause in adults over 30). Ref: Ray C. G., Ryan K. J. (2010).

The C1-complex is composed of 1 molecule of Clq, 2 molecules of C1r and 2 molecules of Cls, or C1qr2s2. This occurs when Clq binds to IgM or IgG complexed with antigens. A single IgM can initiate the pathway, while multiple Ig. Gs are needed. This also occurs when Clq binds directly to the surface of the pathogen. Such binding leads to conformational changes in the C1q molecule, which leads to the activation of two Clr molecules. C1r is a serine protease. They then cleave Cls (another serine protease). The C1r2s2 component now splits C4 and then C2, producing C4a, C4b, C2a, and C2b. C4b and C2b bind to form the classical pathway C3-convease (C4b2b complex), which promotes cleavage of C3 into C3a and C3b; C3b later joins with C4b2b (the C3 convease) to make C5 convease (C4b2b3b complex).

        "exp": "Herpes simplex is an enveloped, linear DNA virus that is a very common infectious agent; most adults will have anti-Herpes simplex antibodies in their serum, although many may not have ever had any clinical signs of disease. The hallmark of this disease is painful skin vesicles often called \"cold\" sores, or \"fever\" blisters to denote the precipitating event that preceded the appearance of the lesions. The virus has a propensity to become latent in the host, finding safe refuge in nervous tissue. Activation of the infection occurs following mild trauma (e. g., a visit to the dentist), hormonal changes (e. g., menses), and immunosuppression (e. g., following organ transplantation). Other, more serious, manifestations of disease include encephalitis, pneumonia, and hepatitis; these are paicularly likely to be seen in immunodeficient patients such as those with AIDS. Adenoviruses are naked, linear, double-stranded DNA viruses that cause acute, usually self-limiting, influenza-like illnesses occurring in winter. The symptoms include pharyngitis, fever, cough, and general malaise. Epidemic pharyngoconjunctivitis and pneumonia can occur in closed populations such as military installations. Coxsackie viruses are naked, single-stranded, polycistronic viruses with an RNA genome. They are divided into groups A and B based on their virulence in suckling mice. Coxsackie A group causes generalized myositis and flaccid paralysis, which is rapidly fatal to infant mice, whereas group B produces less severe lesions of the heart, pancreas, and central nervous system. In man, Coxsackie A causes herpangina and hand-foot-and-mouth disease, while Coxsackie B is seen in patients with pleurodynia, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Both groups cause upper respiratory infections, febrile rashes, and meningitis. Herpes zoster, the varicella virus, is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that is a very common infectious agent in children. Chickenpox is a mild, self-limiting illness in children that is evidenced as a fever followed by a macular rash that progresses to papules, then vesicles of the skin and mucous membranes. Shingles is a recurrence of a previously latent varicella infection in which the virus has taken refuge in sensory ganglia of spinal or cranial nerves. Various factors that decrease the immune status of the patient contribute to the exacerbation of the infection. Severe dermatomal pain occurs with a vesicular eruption, fever, and malaise.

SSPE appears to be due to a combination of persistent, possibly abnormal measles virus and to autoimmune damage caused by antibodies directed against the virus. Many patients developing SSPE have had measles at 2 years of age or younger; there is typically a six-year interval between measles infection and symptom development. A small propoion of cases have followed vaccination with live measles virus. Unfounately, no effective therapy has been developed, although some experimental work with drugs such as isoprinosine shows some promise. Postinfectious encephalomyelitis, rather than SSPE, can follow mumps or varicella. Latent infection with the varicella virus causes shingles (herpes zoster). Papillomaviruses are associated with was. They do not usually infect the brain. Poliovirus causes gastrointestinal disturbances, viremia, and paralysis. Ref: Ray C. G., Ryan K. J. (2010). Chapter 10.

        "exp": "Ans. B i. e. Widal test Widal test It is a presumptive serological test for enteric fever or undulant fever whereby bacteria causing typhoid fever are mixed with serum containing specific antibodies obtained from an infected individual. In case of Salmonella infections, it is a demonstration of the presence of 0-soma false-positive result. Test results need to be interpreted carefully in the light of past history of enteric fever, typhoid vaccination, and the general level of antibodies in the populations in endemic areas of the world. As with all serological tests, the rise in antibody levels needed to perform the diagnosis takes 7-14 days, which limits it applicability in early diagnosis. Other means of diagnosing Salmonella typhi (and paratyphi) include cultures of blood, urine and faeces. These organisms produce H2S from thiosulfate and can be easily identified on differential media such as Bismuth sulfite agar. Often 2-mercaptoethanol is added to the Widal test. This agent more easily denatures the IgM class of antibodies, so if a decrease in the titer is seen after using this agent, it means that the contribution of IgM has been removed leaving the IgG component. This differentiation of antibody classes is impoant; as it allows for the distinction of a recent (IgM) from an old infection (IgG). The Widal test is positive if TO antigen titer is more than 1: 160 in an active infection, or if TH antigen titer is more than 1: 160 in past infection or in immunized persons. A single Widal test is of little clinical relevance due to the number of cross reacting infections, including malaria. If no other tests (either bacteriologic culture or more specific serology) are available, a fourfold increase in the titer (e. g., from 1: 40 to 1: 160) in the course of the infection, or a conversion from an IgM reaction to an IgG reaction of at least the same titer, would be consistent with a typhoid infection.",

Autoinfection is a rare occurrence in helminthic infections, possible only with Strongyloides stercoralis, the threadworm, and Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm. Ingestion of cysts in contaminated water is the normal mechanism of infection used by intestinal protozoa. Ingestion of eggs from an infected pet occurs in visceral larva migrans, when the ascarids of dogs and cats infect the human, an aberrant host.

        "exp": "Campylobacter jejuni is a pathogen causing an invasive enteric infection associated with ingestion of raw or undercooked food products, or through direct contact with infected animals. Ingestion of contaminated poultry that has not been sufficiently cooked is the most common means of acquiring the infection. The patients typically have bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. The presence of fecal leukocytes indicates an invasive infection. The organism is a gram negative rod with a curved \"comma-shape\" or \"S-shape. \" Enterotoxigenic E. coli causes the classic traveler's diarrhea. The infection is non-invasive and is acquired the fecal-oral route through consumption of unbottled water or uncooked vegetables. The major manifestation is a copious outpouring of fluid from the GI tract presenting as explosive diarrhea. This is due to the action of one of two types of enterotoxins on the GI tract mucosa. Shigella sonnei produces a syndrome very similar to C. jejuni. However, the organism appears as a gram-negative rod on Gram's stain. It does not have a comma shape. Transmission is from person to person the fecal-oral route. Infection requires a low infective dose since the organism is fairly resistant to gastric acidity. Staphylococcus aureus produces food poisoning due to the ingestion of a pre-formed enterotoxin. The organism is present in food that is high in salt content such as potato salad, custard, milk shakes, and mayonnaise. The patient presents with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, followed by diarrhea beginning 1-6 hours after ingestion of the enterotoxin. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013). Chapter 17.

The reservoir of infection is both man and mosquito. The transmission cycle is Man-mosquito-man Dengue fever occurs both epidemically and endemically. Epidemics stas in rainy season and are usually explosive. Aedes mosquito becomes infective by feeding on a patient from the day before onset to the 5th day of illness.

Fever is usually between 39degc and 40degc temperature returns to normal after 5-6 days or subside on about the 3rd day and rise again after 5-8 days after onset (saddle back fever). Rashes appear in 80% of cases during remission or during second febrile phase. The rash lasts for 2 hours to several days and may be followed by desquamation. B) Dengue Hemorrhagic fever (DHF)- It is a severe form of dengue fever caused by infection with more than one dengue virus. The severe illness is thought to be due to double infection with more than one dengue virus. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is believed to result from reinfection with a virus of different serotype ( due to enhancing antibodies) DHF usally occurs after sequential infection with any two of the four serotypes of dengue virus.

Acidophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies (Torres bodies) are seen in the infected liver cells in the early stages. Must know: Q- fever / Query fever is caused by Coxiella burnetti.

It is found typically in alcoholic males over 40 years of age with underlying diabetes or obstructive lung disease. Klebsiella pneumoniae mimics Streptococcus pneumoniae as a pulmonary pathogen except that Klebsiella has a greater tendency to progress to lung abscess and empyema. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is usually associated with patients on ventilators, paicularly in intensive care units. Immunocompetent patients usually have bilateral bronchopneumonia without cavitary lesions. Aificial ventilation is classically associated with P. aeruginosa infection. The organism thrives in a wet environment such as respirators, cleaning solutions, disinfectants, sinks, vegetables, flowers, endoscopes, and physiotherapy pools. P. aeruginosa is a very impoant pathogen. Mucoid strains of this organism infect the airways in patients with cystic fibrosis, leading to acute exacerbations and chronic progression of lung damage. Both organisms cause disease in association with diabetes. Klebsiella pneumoniae produces pulmonary disease and P. aeruginosa causes necrotic skin ulcers in diabetics. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013).

Clinical laboratories (Level A) were at the bottom of a triangle, sending specimens to a public health laboratory (level B) or Level C (state public health laboratory) for confirmation. Isolates were ultimately sent to CDC or United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USMRIID)-Level D, for archiving ang sophisticated molecular testing. This original system has now been changed to a three-tier system in which Level A laboratories are now called Sentinel laboratories; Level B & C laboratories are called Reference laboratories & Level D are called National laboratories. The main role of Sentinel Microbiology laboratories is to raise suspicion when a targeted agent is suspected in a human specimen.

        "exp": "Ans. D: Opsonization Phagocytosis is largely responsible for depletion of cells coated with antibodies Cells opsonized by the IgG antibodies are recognized by phagocyte Fc receptors, which are specific for the Fc poions of some IgG subclasses Agglutination When a paiculate antigen is mixed with its antibody in the presence of electrolytes at a suitable temperature and pH, the paicles are clumped or agglutinated Transduction Transfer of a poion of the DNA from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage Conjugation It is. a process by whereby a 'male' or 'donor' bacterium 'mates' or makes a physical contact with a 'female' or 'recipient' bacterium and transfers genetic element into it Opsonization It is the process by which a pathogen is marked for ingestion and destruction by a phagocyte. Opsonization involves the binding of an opsonin, e. g., antibody, to a receptor on the pathogen's cell membrane. After opsonin binds to the membrane, phagocytes are attracted to the pathogen. The Fab poion of the antibody binds to the antigen, whereas the Fc poion of the antibody binds to an Fc receptor on the phagocyte, facilitating phagocytosis. The receptor-opsin complex can also create byproducts like C3b and C4b which are impoant components of the complement system. These components are deposited on the cell surface of the pathogen and aid in its destruction. The cell can also be destroyed by a process called antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, in which the pathogen does not need to be phagocytosed to be destroyed. During this process, the pathogen is opsonized and bound with the antibody IgG its Fab domain. Then the antibody binds an immune effector cell its Fc domain and this binding triggers a release of lysis products from the bound immune effector cell (monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and natural killer cells). This process can cause inflammation of surrounding tissues and damage to healthy cells. Opsonin It is any molecule that targets an antigen for an immune response. However, the term is usually used in reference to molecules that act as a binding enhancer for the process of phagocytosis, especially antibodies, which coat the negatively-charged molecules on the membrane. Molecules that activate the complement system are also considered opsonins. Phagocytic cells do not have an FC receptor for IgM, making IgM ineffective in assisting phagocytosis. However, IgM is extremely efficient at activating complement and is, therefore, considered an opsonin. Opsonins can also refer to molecules that target a cell for destruction through the action of Natural Killer cells. Examples of opsonin molecules include: Antibodies: IgG Components of the complement system: C3b, C4b, and i. C3b Mannose-binding lectin (initiates the formation of C3b) The most impoant are IgG and C3b.",

Although B lymphocytes are infected by the virus, the characteristic atypical cells are activated suppressor T cells - thus the paracoical location (T cell zone) in the lymph node.

All lymphomas, including Burkitt's, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, destroy the normal architecture of the lymph node.

In antibody formation T cells are involved earlier than B cells.. After antigen exposure, antigen presenting cells present antigen to CD 4 helper T cells, which then secrete cytokines that induce differentiation of B cells ( which have already been exposed to same antigen) to plasma cells.. Plasma cells form antibody against that specific antigen.",

Also Know: Cytotoxic (cytolytic) T lymphocytes are also specific effectors of the cellular immune response, paicularly against virus-infected cells. In this example, a virus (e. g., influenza virus) is inhaled and infects a cell of the respiratory tract. Viral envelope glycoproteins appear on the surface of the infected cell in association with class I MHC proteins. A cytotoxic T cell binds its antigen-specific receptor to the viral antigen-class I MHC protein complex and is stimulated to grow into a clone of cells by interleukin-2 produced by helper T cells. These cytotoxic T cells specifically kill influenza virus-infected cells (and not cells infected by other viruses) by recognizing viral antigen-class I MHC protein complexes on the cell surface and releasing perforins that destroy the membrane of the infected cell.

Robeson's cooked meat medium is probably the most widely used fluid medium for the culture of anaerobes. Obligate anaerobes are bacteria that can live only in the absence of oxygen. Obligate anaerobes are destroyed when exposed to the atmosphere for as briefly as 10 minutes. Facultative anaerobes are those organisms that will grow with or without oxygen. Many anaerobes have characteristic microscopic morphology. For example, Bacteroides spp. are gram-negative rods that are pleomorphic (variable in size and shape) and exhibit irregular bipolar staining. Fusobacterium spp. are often pale gram-negative spindle-shaped rods having pointed ends. Clostridium spp. are large gram-positive rods that form spores. Blood agar is a solid culture medium consisting of agar, peptones and blood. It is an example of an enriched, non selective general purpose medium since it suppos the growth of most aerobic and aerobic bacteria. Sabouraud Dextrose agar is culture medium for the growth of fungi. Thioglycollate medium is a semisolid, nutrient medium that suppos the growth of organisms of all oxygen requirements.",

        "question": "A pathologist repos the presence of koilocytotic atypia in a cervical biopsy from a 25 year old woman. On the basis of this histopathologic finding, which of the following conditions does this patient most likely have?",
        "exp": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of condyloma, which may occur on any mucocutaneous surface of the male or female external genitalia. Squamous epithelial cells infected by HPV show characteristic nuclear and cytoplasmic changes, referred to as koilocytosis or koilocytotic atypia, on tissue sections or Pap smears. These changes allow the diagnosis of HPV infection to be made. The nuclei are condensed and have irregular contours, acquiring a \"raisin-like\" appearance; cytoplasm vacuolization creates a perinuclear halo. HPV is a crucial etiopathogenetic factor in the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. Not all types of HPV, however, are associated with cervical carcinoma. High-risk types are 16 and 18, whereas the most frequent low-risk types are 6 and 11. HPV types 16 and 18 express proteins (E6 and E7) that inactivate p53 and Rb tumor suppressor genes, leading to neoplastic transformation. Although HPV infection is a risk factor for the development of squamous dysplasia and carcinoma, koilocytosis is not equivalent to severe squamous dysplasia (choice E) or carcinoma in situ (choice F). In the current Bethesda system for diagnosing and repoing Pap smears, koilocytosis is likened to a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, ie, mild atypia. Remember that koilocytosis (koilocytotic atypia) = HPV infection, not severe dysplasia/carcinoma. Chlamydia infection of the genital tract is due to Chlamydia trachomatis. The infection is often symptomatic in men and clinically silent in women. In addition to urethritis and lymphogranuloma venereum, C. trachomatis causes trachoma, an eye infection endemic in some developing countries. Gonococcal infection, or gonorrhea, is due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a gram-negative diplococcus. Herpes simplex type 2 virus manifests with painless blisters, which subsequently break down, forming painful erosions. Ref: Ray C. G., Ryan K. J. (2010). Chapter 19. Papilloma and Polyoma Viruses.

Cholera toxin consists of an A subunit coupled to a B subunit: the A subunit consists of an Al domain containing the enzymatic active site, and an A2 domain while the B subunit contains five identical peptides that assemble into a pentameric ring surrounding a central pore. This AB; structure is closely related to the heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, which causes diarrhoea, often in infants. Symptoms begin when the massive secretion of water and sodium in the small intestine, a consequence of the activation of cyclic AMP, exceeds the resorptive capacity of the colon.",

Which of the following organisms is most likely responsible?",
        "exp": "Humans become infected with Toxoplasma gondii by ingesting cysts in contaminated food or through contact with cat feces. The veterinarian in question was therefore paicularly at risk of infection. T. gondii is especially hazardous in pregnant women because the organism can be transmitted to the fetus through the placenta. (It is pa of the To. RCHeS group of congenital infections; Toxoplasma, Rubella, CMV, Herpes/HIV, Syphilis). Since infected mothers are usually asymptomatic, cases often go unnoticed. Occasionally, patients present with cervical lymphadenopathy, as did the veterinarian, and require treatment to prevent complications in the fetus. Though newborns are also often asymptomatic, they are at risk for developing the classic triad of chorioretinitis (at bih or later in life), hydrocephalus, and cerebral calcifications. Note that T. gondii is also a common cause of CNS infections (e. g., encephalitis) in HIV-positive patients. Isospora belli (choice A) is an intestinal protozoan that causes watery diarrhea, paicularly in the immunocompromised. Fecal-oral transmission of oocysts allows invasion of small intestinal mucosa, destroying the brush border. Leishmania donovani (choice B) causes kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis), which is characterized by fever, weakness, weight loss, splenomegaly, and skin hyperpigmentation. It is prevalent in regions of the Mediterranean, Middle East, Russia, and China. The vector is the sandfly. Plasmodium vivax (choice C) causes malaria and is transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito, which introduces sporozoites into the blood. These differentiate into merozoites that destroy erythrocytes. Splenomegaly ensues. Other species of this organism also cause malaria: P. malariae and P. falciparum (which causes a more severe form of the disease). Note that sickle cell trait confers resistance to this disease.

One limitation of this method is the fact that enterococci (gut streptococci) do not produce nitrite from nitrate, but can nonetheless cause urinary tract infections. Enterococcal urinary tract infections are often nosocomial and classically acquired in the intensive care unit, although they can occur in other settings. Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause urinary tract infections and would usually be picked up by the dipstick for nitrites.

Chlamydia psittaci produces an interstitial pneumonitis accompanied by headache, backache, and a dry, hacking cough. A pale, macular rash is also found on the trunk (Horder's spots). Patients at risk include pet shop workers, pigeon handlers, and poultry workers. Entamoeba histolytica produces a diarrhea (frequently bloody or heme-positive), right lower quadrant crampy abdominal pain, and fever. Patients frequently have weight loss and anorexia. There is usually a history of travel outside the U. S. Most cases are chronic. Complications include liver abscesses. Staphylococcus aureus produces a self-limited gastroenteritis due to the production of preformed, heat-stable enterotoxins. The incubation period is 16 hours.

        "exp": "Autoinfection refers to the ability of ceain parasites, paicularly helminth to establish life cycle within the host, eliminating the need for an intermediate stage and secondary host. Strongyloides has a cycle of autoinfection. Here the rhabditiform larvae mature into the infective third stage larvae during their passage down the gut. These filariform larvae cause reinfection by piercing the perianal and perineal skin during defecation. The larvae wander in the dermis of the perianal region for some time, causing a radiating perianal creeping eruption, a form of cutaneous larva migrans. They ultimately enter the lymphatics or venules and are carried to the right heart and the lungs to complete the life cycle as above. This ability to cause autoinfection explains the persistence of the infection in patients for long periods, even 30-40 years after leaving the endemic areas. Some of the organisms where autoinfection occurs are Strongyloides stercoralis, Enterobius vermicularis, Taenia solium, and Hymenolepis nana. Ref: Textbook of Medical Parasitology, 5th Ed, Page 161",

Septicum and Cl. novyi Crepitus A sound can be created when two rough surfaces in the human body come into contact-- for example, in osteoahritis or rheumatoid ahritis when the cailage around joints has eroded away and the joint ends grind against one another When the fracture surfaces of two broken bones rub together, it produces a sound. Crepitus is a common sign of bone fracture. In soft tissues, crepitus can be produced when gas is introduced into an area where it normally isn't present. The term can also be used when describing the sounds produced by lung conditions such as interstitial lung disease--these are also referred to as \"rales\". Crepitus is often loud enough to be heard by the human ear, although a stethoscope may be needed to detect instances caused by respiratory diseases. In times of poor surgical practice, post-surgical complications involved anaerobic infection by Clostridium perfringens strains, which can cause gas gangrene in tissues, also giving rise to crepitus. Subcutaneous crepitus (or surgical emphysema) is a crackling sound resulting from subcutaneous emphysema, or air trapped in the subcutaneous tissues. Subcutaneous emphysema/ SCE/ SE/ Tissue emphysema/ Sub Q air It occurs when gas or air is present in the subcutaneous layer of the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the cutis of the skin, and emphysema refers to trapped air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where it is able to travel from the chest cavity along the fascia. Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling feel to the touch, a sensation that has been described as similar to touching Rice Krispies; this sensation of air under the skin is known as subcutaneous crepitation.",

Nohern blot test is an immunologic technique for the detection of specific messenger RNAs using complementary DNA. (Called also Nohern transfer) Western blotting is a more specific test as it allows one to visualize antibodies directed against each viral protein. For this reason, it is a confirmatory test for a positive HIV ELISA. ELISA measures antibody to whole virus and gives a \"positive, \" \"negative\" or indeterminate test result. Eastern blotting is a technique to analyze proteins, lipids, or glycoconjugates, and is most often used to detect carbohydrate epitopes.",

The exposed teichoic acid is referred as 'C' substance. This 'C' substance is common to all pneumococci and is unrelated to the group specific carbohydrate of 13 hemolytic streptococci.

        "question": "Chloramphenicol resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is due to:",
        "exp": "Bacteria have evolved in various ways to counter the toxic propeies of antimicrobial agents. These are the following: i. Inactivation of the antimicrobial drug Resistance to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics in many bacteria is due to production of an enzyme beta-lactamase, which inactivates the antimicrobial agent. Genes encoding betalactamases may be present on chromosome or plasmid. These genes may be constitutively expressed or induced by a beta-lactam antibiotic. Such form of resistance is seen in S. aureus, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae etc. Aminoglycoside modifying enzymes destroy the drug by adenylylating, phosphorylating, or acetylating them. The genes encoding for aminoglycoside modifying enzymes are usually found on plasmids and transposons. This type of resistance is seen in members of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobactersps, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, Campylobacterjejuni etc. ii. Alteration of the antimicrobial target As a result of mutation, the targets of the antimicrobial agents get lost or altered. Sometimes, the existing target may be replaced by an entirely novel protein. Resistances to penicillins/cephalosporins in MRSA, S. pneumoniae or enterococci are often to due to production of altered/novel penicillin binding proteins. Methylation of 23S ribosomal RNA renders the receptor on 50S subunit altered, thereby preventing the binding of erythromycin. Mutations in the 30S subunit of the ribosome interfere with ribosomal binding of streptomycin. Methylation of a single adenine in the bacterial 50s ribosome can lead to resistance against macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B in S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. iii. Adaptation of alternative metabolic pathway Some sulfonamide-resistant bacteria do not require extracellular PABA but, like mammalian cells, can utilize preformed folic acid. A mutational loss in bacteria make them dependent on an external supply of thymine, which contributes to trimethoprim resistance. A mutational change in H. influenzae results in overproduction of dihydrofolate reductases, leading to trimethoprim resistance. iv. Active efflux pumping out of the drug Mutations in ceain bacteria permit the over-expression of the efflux-pump protein. Sometimes, an amino acid substitution in the efflux-pump protein makes it more efficient at expo of the drug. In either case, the intracellular antibiotic concentration is decreased and the bacterium becomes less susceptible to that antibiotic. This kind of resistance is seen to chloramphenicol (P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. typhimurium, V. cholerae), macrolides (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus sps, Bacteroides sps, Pseudomonas sps and Enterobacteriaceae members), tetracyclines (S. aureus, E. coli, A. baumannii, S. typhimurium), aminoglycosides (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii) and beta-lactams (H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii). v. Decreased permeability of the drug Some strains of P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli exhibit aminoglycoside resistance due to a transpo defect or membrane impermeabilization. Resistance to cefoxitin in E. coli and K. pneumoniae is due to mutations leading to narrowed outer membrane proteins. Ref: Colour Atlas and Textbook of diagnostic Microbiology by Elmer. W.

It contains single stranded RNA (ss. RNA) - Defective RNA. It has no independent existence and can survive and replicate only as long as HBV infection persists in the host. It resembles some plant viruses, such as viroids or satellite viruses. It has been classified in genus Deltavirus. Delta core of HDV is encapsidated by an outer envelope of HBs Ag, so it require cooperative function of HBV. Intracellular replication of HDV RNA can occur without HBV but liver injury requires the presence of HBV. HDV can cause two types of infection.",
