Intraery throcytic infection of Babesiosis is characterised by maltese cross. Maltese cross is a characteristic arrangement of parasites within the erythrocytes - Parasites within erythrocytes are arranged such that pointed ends of four parasites come in contact thereby giving a tetrad configuration resembling a maltese cross. Tetrad forms or 'Maltese cross' appearance is considered pathognomic of Babesiosis. o Clinically Babesiosis presents with chills, fever, mild hepatosplenomegaly, and mild hemolytic anemia, o Treatment includes Atovaquone plus azithromycin or quinine plus clindamycin. o Babesiosis can easily be confused with P. falciparum malaria. Following two features distinguish Babesiosis from malaria. Presence of maltese cross in Babesiosis (absent in malaria). Absence of pigment Hemozoin in Babesiosis (present in malaria). Note - Maltese cross is also seen in cryptococcus and aspergillus.",

Distribution and important species of Schistosoma are:# S. japonica is found in Central and Eastern China, and the Philippines and nearby islands; and primarily affects the liver and intestines.# 5. mansoni is found in Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, the Caribbean, and South America and primarily affects the liver and intestines.# S. haematobium is found in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Mediterranean and primarily affects the urinary tract.# S. mekongi is found in Southeast Asia and primarily affects the liver and intestines. Incubation:# Symptoms of acute schistosomiasis begin about a month after infection. Signs and Symptoms# Acute schistosomiasis ->>Katayama fever. Q# The last (chronic) stage varies according to species, i. e., S. japonica, 5. mansoni, and S. mekongi primarily affect liver and intestines; while S. haematobium primarily affects the urinary tract.# In general, patients with chronic schistosomiasis tend to present in developed countries with lethargy, colicky abdominal pain, mucoid/bloody diarrhea, or dysuria and hematuria.# Chronic hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is a consequence of eggs retained in tissue and prolonged infection - usually of > 10 years duration.# Fibrosis may cause portal hypertension, splenomegaly, or esophageal or gastric varices. Q# Chronic genitourinary schistosomiasis is associated with chronic 5. haematobium infection.# Hematuria and dysuria are common from the acute through chronic stages. Bladder cancer rates are increased in endemic areas. Salmonella infection concurrent with schistosomiasis is common and is resistant to treatment unless the schistosomiasis is also treated. Diagnosis# Diagnosis of S. japonicum and S. mansoni is by the presence of ova in feces or tissue. Diagnosis of S. haematobium is by the presence of ova in urine or tissue. However, ova loads are not always sufficient for diagnosis, especially in long-standing chronic illness. Immunofluorescent antibody tests and antigen detection assays are increasingly used.# \"Fetal head\" bladder calcification may be shown in X-rays in chronic S. haematobium infection. QTreatment# For S. haematobium and S. mansoni, praziquantel 20/kg po bid for one day; for S. japonica and S. mekongi, praziquantel 20/kg po tid for one day are the treatments of choice.# S. mansoni may also be treated with oxamniquine in a single po dose (with food) of 15 mg/kg. S. haematobium in North and East Africa may be treated with metrifonate 7. 5-10 mg/kg every other week for a total of 3 doses. Also Know:# The second most common urologic cancer and the most frequent malignant tumor of the urinary tract is bladder cancer. Usually a transitional cell carcinoma. Most prevalent in men during the sixth and seventh decades. Risk factors include smoking, diets rich in meat and fat, schistosomiasis, chronic treatment with cyclophosphamide, and exposure to aniline dye (a benzene derivative).# Causes of portal hypertesnion are as follows: 1. Presinusoidal: Splenic or portal vein thrombosis, schistosomiasis. granulomatous disease. 2. Sinusoidal: Cirrhosis, granulomatous disease. 3.

Babesiosis (B. microti)# Babesiosis is a worldwide protozoan disease of animals that is transmitted by ticks; humans are infected incidentally and initially develop a nonspecific febrile illness that can lead to hemolytic anemia.# Babesia organisms enter RBCs and resemble malarial parasites morphologically, posing a diagnostic problem.# Ixodid (hard-bodied) ticks, in particular Ixodes scapularis (/. dammini) and I. ricinus, are the vectors of the parasite. Transfusions are another source of babesiosis.# The incubation period for B. microti infection is 1 to 4 weeks.# Immunosuppressed patients, splenectomized individuals, and the elderly have the most severe illness.# The clinical presentation varies widely and resembles malaria or rickettsiosis; symptoms and signs include a gradual onset of irregular fever, chills, sweating, muscle pain, and fatigue. Mild hepatosplenomegaly and mild hemolytic anemia may develop, but a rash is not present.# Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films examined for small intraerythrocytic parasites. b. microti appears as a small ring form resembling P. falciparum.# Unlike infection with Plasmodium, however, Babesia does not cause the production of pigment in parasites, nor are schizonts or gametocytes formed.# A species-specific polymerase chain reaction test using the RNA gene has been used to show parasite persistence when the blood smear is negative.# Treatment of Babesiosis: Organism.

Two weeks later, miracidia develop in the egg and hatches. d. The miracidia penetrate its first intermediate host (snail). Within the snail mother sporocyst form and produce many mother rediae, which subsequently produce many daughter rediae which shed crawling cercariae into fresh water. e. The crawling cercariae penetrate fresh water crabs and encyst in its muscles becoming metacercaria. Humans or felines then eat the infected crabs raw. Once eaten, the metacercaria excyst and penetrates the gut, diaphragm and lung where it becomes an adult worm in pairs, f. The first intermediate hosts of the Paragonimus westermani are freshwater snails. g. Transmission of the parasite P. westermani to humans and mammals primarily occurs through the consumption of raw or undercooked seafoodh. Animals such as pigs, dogs, and a variety of feline species can also harbour P. westermani. i. Diagnosis is based on microscopic demonstration of eggs in stool or sputum, but these are not present until 2 to 3 months after infection. However, eggs are also occasionally encountered in effusion fluid or biopsy material. Furthermore, you can use morphologic comparisons with other intestinal parasites to diagnose potential causative agents.

Other symptoms include prolonged fever, tachycardia, fatigue, anemia, weakness, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and myocarditis.- It lasts 4-8 weeks and in rare cases may include myocarditis or meningoencephalitis.- In severe cases temporary electrocardiogram changes are seen, especially first degree A/V block.# chronic stage - Signs and Symptoms- The parasites have an affinity for smooth, skeletal, and heart muscle; and the nervous system.- The heart is the most commonly effected organ, with manifestations including CHF (often right sided), rhythm disturbances, thromboembolism, and cardiomyopathy.- Megaesophagus may occur, with dysphagia, odynophagia, chest pain, cough, and regurgitation.# Rx:- Nifurtimox",

Sporozoites infect intestinal cellsparvum can spread from infected animals to humans. Since oocysts are immediately infectious when passed in feces, person-to-person transmission takes place in day-care centers and among household contacts and medical providers. Waterborne transmission (especially that of C. hominis) accounts for infections in travelers and for common- source epidemics. Oocysts are quite hardy and resist killing by routine chlorination. Both drinking water and recreational water (e. g., pools, waterslides) have been increasingly recognized as sources of infection. Clinical features:[?] Asymptomatic infections can occur in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. [?] In immunocompetent persons, symptoms develop after an incubation period of 1 week and consist principally of watery nonbloody diarrhea, sometimes in conjunction with abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia, fever, and./ or weight loss. In these hosts, the illness usually subsides after 1-2 weeks. [?] In contrast, in immunocompromised hosts (especially those with AIDS and CD4+ T cell counts <100/L), diarrhea can be chronic, persistent, and remarkably profuse, causing clinically significant fluid and electrolyte depletion. Diagnosis:[?] Evaluation starts with fecal examination for small oocysts, which are smaller (4-5 micro meter in diameter) than the fecal stages of most other parasites. [?] Spores are acid fast. [?]. Direct immunofluorescent stains and enzyme immunoassays can be done.

        "exp": "Ans. C. Toxoplasmosis is usually symptomatic in immunocompetent person. Toxoplasmosisa. Infective stage for man: Oocyst with sporozoite & tissue cyst with bradyzoiteb. Freshly passed oocyst is not infective (needs development in the soil)c. Human infection is dead end for the parasited. The principal source of human Toxoplasma infection remains uncertain. e. Transmission usually takes place by the oral route and can be attributable to ingestion of either sporulated oocysts from contaminated soil or bradyzoite from undercooked meatf. In addition to oral transmission, direct transmission of the parasite by blood or organ products during transplantation takes place at a low rateg. In persons whose immune systems are intact, acute toxoplasmosis is usually asymptomatic and self-limited. This condition can go unrecognized in 80-90% of adults andh. children with acquired infectioni. In the immunocompromised or fetal host, the immune factors necessary to control the spread of tachyzoite infection are lacking. This altered immune state allows thej. persistence of tachyzoite and gives rise to progressive focal destruction that results in organ failure (i. e., necrotizing encephalitis, pneumonia, and myocarditis). k. Serologic testing has become the routine method of diagnosis. l. Diagnosis of acute infection with T. gondii can be established by detection of the simultaneous presence of IgG and IgM antibodies to Toxoplasma in serum. The presence ofm. circulating IgA favors the diagnosis of an acute infection. n. Human infection is a dead end for the parasite. Human infection is acquired in the following wayso. Eating uncooked or undercooked infected meat containing tissue cysts. p. Ingestion of mature oocysts through food, water or fingers contaminated with cat feces directly or indirectly. q. Intrauterine infection from infected mother to babies. r. Rarely by blood transfusion or transplantation from infected donors. Life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii.: The cat is the definitive host in which the sexual phase of the cycle is completed. Oocysts shed in cat feces can infect a wide range of animals, including birds, rodents, grazing domestic animals, and humans. The bradyzoite found in the muscle of food animals may infect humans who eat insufficiently cooked meat products, particularly lamb and pork. Although human disease can take many forms, congenital infection and encephalitis from reactivation of latent infection in the brains of immunosuppressed persons are the most important manifestations.",

When such larvae are not able to complete their journey through host&; s tissue to reach localization in their normal abode, their normal progress is arrested and they may localize in unexpected tissue or organs. This condition is called larvae migrans and is generally seen when human infection occurrs with nonhuman species of nematodes.

Over a period of time this may lead to anemia and malnutrition. It has been suggested that mechanical blockage of the appendiceal lumen by masses of whipworms may cause acute appendicitis. In heavy infection, the worm may be abundant on the colonic mucosa, even upto the rectum. Mucus diarrhoea, chronic dysentery and abdominal pain are frequently seen in such cases.

Excystment takes place in the small intestine and the liberated trophozoites reach the large intestine where they feed and multiply as lumen commensals. Infection is very often confined to the lumen and is asymptomatic. Clinical disease results only when the trophozoites burrow into the intestinal mucosa, set up colonies and initiate inflammatory reaction. This leads to mucosal ulcers and submucosal abscesses resembling the lesions in amoebiasis. Clinically also, balantidiasis resembles amoebiasis, causing diarrhoea or frank dysentery with abdominal colic, tenesmus, nausea and vomiting. Occasionally there may occur intestinal perforation with peritonitis and rarely involvement of genital and urinary tracts. Diagnosis Diagnosis is established by demonstration of the parasite in faeces. While motile trophozoites occur in diarrhoeic faeces, cysts are found in formed stools.

The resurgence of an erythrocytic infection (relapse) occurs when merozoites from hypnozoites in the liver break out, are not phagocytosed in the bloodstream, and succeed in reestablishing a red cell infection. Without treatment, P vivax and P ovale infections may persist as periodic relapses for up to 5 years. Human infection results from the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito, through which the sporozoites are injected into the bloodstream. Parasitized red cells are enlarged in P. ovale, P. malariae P vivax, P malariae, and P ovale parasitemias are a relatively low grade, primarily because the parasites our either young or old red cells but not both. P falciparum invades red cells of all ages, including the erythropoietic stem cells in bone marrow, so parasitemia may be very high. P falciparum also causes parasitized red cells to adhere to the endothelial lining of blood vessels, with resulting obstruction, thrombosis, and local ischemia. P falciparum infections are therefore far more serious than the others, with a much higher rate of severe and frequently fatal complications (cerebral malaria, malarial hyperpyrexia, gastrointestinal disorders, algid malaria, blackwater fever).

        "exp": "Toxoplasmosis is generally a mild, self-limiting disease; however, severe fetal disease is possible if pregnant women ingest Toxoplasma oocysts. Consumption of uncooked meat may result in either an acute toxoplasmosis or a chronic toxoplasmosis that is associated with serious eye disease. Most adults have antibody titers to Toxoplasma, and thus would have a positive Sabin-Feldman dye test. The Sabin-Feldman dye test measures antibodies that render the membrane of living T. gondii impermeable to methylene blue (no staining occurs). It is being replaced by IFA and ELISA tests. While we usually think of in utero infections of a developing fetus and the subsequent medical difficulties of the newborn infant, an equally important source of human exposure is raw or undercooked meat in which infective tissue cysts are frequently found. When a tissue cyst ruptures, numerous bradyzoites are released and grow, causing chorioretinitis, myocarditis, and polymyositis. Treatment is with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. Schistosomiasis is caused by blood flukes whose cercariae (larvae) penetrate skin in snail-infested water. Trichinosis is caused by the trichina worm whose larvae are found in uncooked pork. Cutaneous larva migrans consists of subcutaneous migrating larvae of hookworms. Visceral larva migrans is a condition in humans caused by the migratory larvae of certain nematodes, humans being a terminal host. Nematodes causing such zoonotic infections are Toxocara canis, Toxocara cati, and Ascaris suum. Larva currens is an itchy, cutaneous condition caused by infections with Strongyloides stercoralis that intermittently comes and goes every few hours.",

The Sabin Feldman dye test is the gold standard to which all serologic tests performed to detect anti-T. gondii antibodies are compared. It is a neutralization test in which the patients serum is incubated with complement and live Toxoplasma organisms, and a dye is employed to quantify the bound antibody. It allows early detection of the infection and has high sensitivity and specificity in both acute and chronic phases. This test makes use of the uptake by Toxoplasma tachyzoites of the dye methylene blue (in which organisms appear swollen and blue). The tachyzoites membranes lyse in the presence of complement and specific antibody (Primarily IgG) resulting thin, unstained-appearing organisms. This test has been used extensively as a screening test for toxoplasma infection; it has been recommended as the test of choice for antenatal maternal screening, but it is available only in reference laboratories. However, it is no longer used because it requires maintenance of live virulent parasites in the laboratory, and equally good, safer methods have been developed. Currently, the Sabin Feldman dye test is restricted to research centers as a method to standardize new tests.",

        "exp": "Schizogony in the Human Host: Man is the intermediate host for malaria, wherein the asexual phase of the life cycle occurs. The sporozoites inoculated by the infested mosquito initiate this phase of the cycle from the liver, and the latter pa continues within the red blood cells, which results in the various clinical manifestations of the disease. Pre-erythrocytic Phase - Schizogony in the Liver: With the mosquito bite, tens to a few hundred invasive sporozoites are introduced into the skin. Following the intradermal deposition, some sporozoites are destroyed by the local macrophages, some enter the lymphatics, and some others find a blood vessel. The sporozoites that enter a lymphatic vessel reach the draining lymph node wherein some of the sporozoites paially develop into exoerythrocytic stages and may also prime the T cells to mount a protective immune response. The sporozoites that find a blood vessel reach the liver within a few hours. It has recently been shown that the sporozoites travel by a continuous sequence of stick-and-slip motility, using the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) family and an actin-myosin motor. The sporozoites then negotiate through the liver sinusoids, and migrate into a few hepatocytes, and then multiply and grow within parasitophorous vacuoles. Each sporozoite develop into a schizont containing 10, 000-30, 000 merozoites (or more in case of P. falciparum). The growth and development of the parasite in the liver cells is facilitated by a a orable environment created by the The circumsporozoite protein of the parasite. The entire pre-eryhrocytic phase lasts about 5-16 days depending on the parasite species: on an average 5-6 days for P. falciparum, 8 days for P. vivax, 9 days for P. ovale, 13 days for P. malariae and 8-9 days for P. knowlesi. The pre-erythrocytic phase remains a \"silent\" phase, with little pathology and no symptoms, as only a few hepatocytes are affected. This phase is also a single cycle, unlike the next, erythrocytic stage, which occurs repeatedly.",

The infection in newborn occurs by congenital toxoplasmosis transmitted from mother to child. In such children fever, jaundice, hydrocephalus, microcephaly & cerebral calcifications are seen. [?]. Lab Diagnosis of Toxoplasmosis: o. The demonstration of the Toxoplasma gondii organism in blood, body fluids, or tissue. o. Detection of Toxoplasma gondii antigen in blood or body fluids by enzyme-linkedoimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. o. Of particular interest is determining acute infection in pregnant women, due to the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis. This is complicated by the fact that many women have existing IgG and IgM antibodies to T. gondii. [?]. Sabin Feldman Dye Test: o. Cytoplasm modifying antibody. o. Equal amount (0. 1ml) of diluted patient's serum (1: 17, 1: 32, 1: 64, 1: 128 and 1: 256) + toxoplasma suspension + Normal human serum (accessory factor) are incubated in a water bath at 37degC for 1 hour. o. One drop of saturated alcoholic solution of methylene blue (Ph11) is added. o. The number of toxoplasma with stained & unstained cytoplasm is counted. o. The highest dilution of the serum in which 50% or more of the organism have unstained cytoplasm is taken as the titre. o. In acute infection diagnosis confirmed by identifying toxoplasms in stained preparations of:-Lymph node aspirates, CSF, peritoneal aspirate, bone marrow. Sabin-Feldman Dye Test is a sensitive and specific neutralization test. It measures IgG antibody and is the standard reference test for toxoplasmosis. High titers suggest acute disease. Serologically IgM fluorescent antibody test detects IgM antibodies within the first week of infection, but titers fall within a few months. Toxoplasma Gondii[?]. Antibody Detection: o. Cytotoxic effect of antibodies in the presence of complements. o. End point is the dilution at which 50% of the tachyzoites are dead. o. Live tachyzoites necessary. o. Easy to read, Highly sensitive (2. IU/mI). o. Detects very early antibodies. Other Options[?]. Trypanosomiasiso. Trypanosomes cause 'sleeping sickness' in man & nagana in cattle in Africa called Trypanosomiasis. o. Diagnosis established by demonstration of trypanosomes in peripheral blood, bone marrlow, lymph nodes & CSF. o. Serological tests involve direct agglutination, IHA., ELISA & Immunofluoresenceo. Card Indirect Agglutination test for Trypanosomiasis. [?]. Kalazar or Visceral Leishmaniasis: o. Is caused by L. donovani & transmitted by female phlebotamine sandflies (Phlebotomus argentipes). o. Demonstration of parasite LD bodies in aspirates of spleen, liver, bone marrow or lymph node confirms visceral leishmaniasis. o. Aldehyde test of Napier widely used in India for diagnosis of Kala-azar. o. Serological tests: Direct agglumination test, rk 39 dipstick test, ELISA, indirect fluorecent antibody test. o. Leishmanin Test based on skin reaction, represents delayed hypersensitivity. [?]. Yellow Fever: o. It is caused by Flavivirus & spread by mosquito Aedes aegypti, causing Fever & Jaundiceo. Lab Diagnosis: Depend up on isolation of virus by intracerebral inocculation of blood of patient into mice. o. Serological Tests: of CFT nutralization & HAIo. Intranuclear inclusion bodies which are eosinophilic (red) are seen in the areas of hyaline necrosis called Councilman bodies.",

        "exp": "CLONORCHIS SINENSIS Commonly known as the Chinese liver fluke, Embryonated eggs are discharged in the biliary ducts and in the stool. Eggs are ingested by a suitable snail intermediate host. Each egg releases a miracidia, which go through several developmental stages (sporocysts, rediae, and cercariae ). The cercariae are released from the snail and after a sho period of free-swimming time in water, they come in contact and penetrate the flesh of freshwater fish, where they encyst as metacercariae. Infection of humans occurs by ingestion of undercooked, salted, pickled, or smoked freshwater fish. After ingestion, the metacercariae excyst in the duodenum and ascend the biliary tract through the ampulla of Vater. Maturation takes approximately 1 month. The adult flukes (measuring 10 to 25 mm by 3 to 5 mm) reside in small and medium sized biliary ducts. In addition to humans, carnivorous animals can serve as reservoir hosts. The migration of the larva up the bile duct induces desquamation, followed by hyperplasia and sometimes adenomatous changes. The smaller bile ducts undergo cystic dilatation. The adult worm may cause obstruction and blockage of the common bile duct leading to cholangitis. Chronic infection may result in calculus formation. A few cases go on to biliary cirrhosis and poal hypertension. Some patients with chronic clonorchiasis tend to become biliary carriers of typhoid bacilli. Chronic infection has also been linked with cholangiocarcinoma. Patients in the early stage have fever, epigastric pain, diarrhoea and tender hepatomegaly. This is followed by biliary colic, jaundice and progressive liver enlargement. Many infections are asymptomatic REF: TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL PARASITOLOGY; CKJ PANIKER; 6. TH EDITION; PAGE NO 128",

The infective larvae deposited in the skin by the bite of the vector develop at the site to adult worms. Adult worms are seen singly, in pairs or in tangled masses in subcutaneous tissues. They may occur in the subcutaneous nodules or free in the tissues. The subcutaneous nodule or onchocercoma is a circumscribed, firm, non-tender tumour formed as a result of fibroblastic reaction around the worms. Nodules vary in size from a few mm to about 10 cm. They tend to occur over anatomical sites where the bones are superficial, such as the scalp, scapulae, ribs, elbows, iliac crest, sacrum and knees. The nodules are painless and cause no trouble except for their unsightly appearance. Microfilariae cause lesions in the skin and eyes. The skin lesion is a dermatitis with pruritus, pigmentation, atrophy and fibrosis. Ocular manifestations range from photophobia to gradual blurring of vision, progressing to total blindness. Ocular lesions include punctate or sclerosing keratitis, iridocyclitis, secondary glaucoma, choroidoretinitis and optic atrophy. REF: TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL PARASITOLOGY; CKJ PANIKER; 6.

In man, they may be intracellular, in which they are called leishmanial forms; or, they may be located extracellularly in the blood, in which they are called trypanosomes. The insect vectors may have leptomonads (promastigotes) or crithidial (epimastigote) forms. Leishmaniasis (cutaneous, mucocutaneous/and visceral) only has the leishmania, intracellular forms present in man. In Mrican trypanosomiasis, only the extracellular, or trypanosomal form, is present in man. Chagas disease has both the intracellular (leishmanial) and extracellular (trypanosomal) forms. Chagas disease is rampant in South America and is the major cause of progressive heart failure and death in that area. T cruzi is a flagellated protozoan that is transmitted to man by the bite of the Reduviid bug, or kissing bug, which usually occurs during the night. Sholy after the bite, the bug defecates on the wound site and the sleeping host rubs the organisms into the wound. Periorbital inflammation develops, which is called Romana's sign. Trypanosomes circulate in the blood and leishmanial forms invade (1) the reticuloendothelial cells, producing hepatosplenomegaly; (2) the heart muscle, causing myocarditis and arrhythmias; (3) the brain, producing a meningoencephalitis; and (4) into the gastrointestinal tract, where the leishmania destroy the ganglion cells in the distal esophagus and rectum to produce acquired achalasia and Hirschsprung disease, respectively. Laboratory diagnosis is made by (1) finding trypanosomes in the blood, (2) finding leishmanial forms in tissue, (3) culture, (4) serology, and (5) xenodiagnosis. Xenodiagnosis is a method of inoculation in which sterile Reduviid bugs are fed or offered the blood of an infected patient. After a few weeks, the bug's intestinal contents are examined for presence or absence of the organism. Only 5% of patients die in the acute stage of heart failure, whereas in chronic disease, heart failure is a common cause of death. Nifuimox is the drug of choice.",

The antigen in hydatid fluid collected from animal or human cysts and sterilised by Seitz or membrane filtration and is injected (0. 2 ml) intradermally on one arm and an equal volume of saline as control on the other arm. In positive cases a large wheal, about 5 cm in diameter, with multiple pseudopodial projections appears within 20 to 30 minutes at the test site and fades in an hour. A secondary reaction consisting of oedema and induration appears after 8 hours. The test is very sensitive, but not specific and false-positive reactions may appear in a number of other conditions.

LYMPHATIC FILARIASIS# Lymphatic filariasis is caused by W. bancrofti, B. malayi, or B. timori.# Humans are the only definitive host for the parasite.# Generally, W. bancrofti is noctumally periodic. (Nocturnally periodic forms of microfilariae are scarce in peripheral blood by day and increase at night, whereas subperiodic forms are present in peripheral blood at all times and reach maximal levels in the afternoon)# Natural vectors for W. bancrofti: Culex fatigans in urban settings and anopheline or aedean mosq in rural areas.# B. malayi has 2 forms distinguished by periodicity of microfilaremia. The more common nocturnal form is transmitted in areas of coastal rice fields, while subperiodic form in forests. B. malayi naturally infects cats and humans. Diagnosis# Microfilariae can be found in blood, hydrocele fluid, or in other body fluids, detection by Knott's concentration technique.# Two tests are commercially available: one is ELISA and the other a rapid-format immunochromatographic card test. Both assays have sensitivities that range from 96 to 100% and specificities that approach 100%.# Doppler examination of the scrotum or the female breast may result in the identification of motile adult worms within dilated lymphatics (termed the filaria dance sign).# Retrogradely evolving lymphangitis is a characteristic feature that helps distinguish filarial lymphangitis from typically ascending bacterial lymphangitis. Treatment# Diethylcarbamazine (DEC, 6 mg/kg daily for 12 days), which has both macro- and microfilaricidal properties, remains the treatment of choice for the individual with active lymphatic filariasis (microfilaremia, antigen positivity, or adult worms on ultrasound), although albendazole has also demonstrated macrofilaricidal efficacy.# Side effects of DEC treatment include fever, chills, arthralgias, headaches, nausea, and vomiting.# Ivermectin has a side effect profile similar to that of DEC when used in lymphatic filariasis.",

Cutaneous There may be a dermatitis, with erythema and itching at the site of penetration of the filariform larvae, paicularly when large numbers of larvae enter the skin. In those sensitised by prior infection, there may be an allergic response. This may prevent circulation in the blood of the larvae, which may instead migrate in skin, leading to a form of creeping eruption or larva migrans. Pulmonary During escape of the larvae from the pulmonary capillaries into the alveoli, small haemorrhages occur, along with cellular infiltration into alveoli and bronchioles. Larvae may be found in the sputum. Intestinal The symptoms may resemble those of peptic ulcer or of malabsorption syndrome. Mucus diarrhoea is often present. In heavy infection, the mucosa may be honeycombed with the worm and there may be extensive sloughing, causing dysenteric stools. Hyperinfection In debilitated individuals, and paicularly in those with cellular immune defects, extensive internal reinfection takes place, leading to enormous numbers of adult worms in the intestines and lungs, and larvae in various tissues and organs. This is known as hyperinfection. Severe malnutrition, lepromatous leprosy, lymphoreticular malignancies, AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs and other situations in which cellmediated immunity is defective, predispose to this condition. Hyperinfection is an impoant hazard of steroid therapy and other instances of prolonged immunosuppression as in tansplant patients. Manifestations depend on the sites affected.

In freshly passed motion unmixed with urine or antiseptics, actively motile trophozoites of E. histolytica can be demonstrated in unstained saline mounts. The presence of ingested erythrocytes clinches the identity of E. histolytica, as they are not found in any other intestinal amoeba.

In patients with severe Raynaud's phenomenon and refractory digital ulcers due to distal ulnar artery occlusion. Anticholinesterase test. Myasthenia gravis. Apnea test. Demonstration that apnea is due to irreversible medullary damage. Bentiromide testis an indirect measure of pancreatic function and reflects intraluminal chymotrypsin activity. The test has excellent specificity but is not very sensitive. Bernstein test. Heartburn is produced by heightened mucosal sensitivity and can be reproduced by infusion of dilute (0. 1 N) hydrochloric acid. Casoni's test. Echinococcosis. Coomb's test. Is the major tool for diagnosing autoimmune hemolysis. This test relies on the ability of antibodies specific for immunoglobulins (especially IgG) or complement components (especially C3) to agglutinate RBC coated with these proteins. With specific anti-IgG and anti-C3, the direct Coombs test detects IgG or C3 on the patient's RBC, which indicates the presence of immune hemolysis and may help define its cause. Desmopressin test. Severe pituitary or nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus can be differentiated by administering desmopressin (DDAVP, 0. 03 microg/kg subcutaneously or intravenously) and repeating the measurement of urine osmolarity 1 to 2 h later. An increase of >50% indicates severe pituitary Dl, whereas a smaller or absent response is strongly suggestive of nephrogenic Dl. Dexamethasone suppression test. The best screening procedure for Pituitary-Adrenal Suppressibility is the overnight dexamethasone suppression test. Dick test. Susceptibility to scarlet fever was correlated with results of the Dick test, in which a small amount of erythrogenic toxin injected intradermally produced local erythema in susceptible individuals but elicited no response in those with specific. Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) dye test or the dihydrorhodamine (DHR) oxidation test. Deficiencies of oxidative metabolism are detected with either the two. Drop arm test. The diagnosis of a complete tear of the rotator cuff is suggested by the drop arm test in which the patient is unable to maintain his or her arm outstretched once it is passively abducted. Finkelstein's test. De. Quervains tenosynovitis resulting from inflammation of the tendon sheath(s) involving the abductor poliicis longus or extensor pollicis brevis. Hydrogen breath test. Hydrogen breath testing after lactose ingestion may be performed for suspected lactase deficiency. Gastrin provocative tests(secretin stimu- lation test, the calcium infusion study, and a standard meal test). To differentiate between the causes of hypergastrinemia. Ham test. For many years, the diagnosis of PNH depended on the demonstration of the lysis of RBC after complement activation either by acid (Ham test) or by reduction in ionic strength (sucrose lysis test). These tests are inferior to the analysis of GPI-linked proteins (e. g., CD59, DAF) on RBC and granulocytes by flow cytometry. Head tilt test. Cardinal diagnostic feature of trochlear nerve palsy (The vertical diplopia is exacerbated by tilting the head towards the side with the muscle palsy, and alleviated by tilting it away). Mc. Murray testA positive Mc. Murray test may indicate a meniscal tear. Mazzotti test. Onchocerciasis. Swinging flashlight test. To elicit relative afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil). It is an extremely useful sign in retrobulbar optic neuritis and other optic nerve diseases, where it may be the sole objective evidence for disease. Schober test. Useful measure of lumbar spine flexion. String test. Strongyloides stercoralis. Tyramine test. To evaluate postganglionic adrenergic function. In a postganglionic lesion, the response to tyramine is reduced and there is an excessive response to subthreshold doses of phenylephrine. Table tilt test. Neurocardiogenic syncope",

There are two distinct stages in the life cycle of T gondii. 1. Nonfeline stage. In this stage tissue cysts (containg bradyzoites) or sporulated oocysts are ingested by intermediate hosts (Human, mouse, sheep or pig). The cyst is rapidly digested by the acidic-pH gastric secretion releasing bradyzoites or sporozoites. These bradyzoites or sporozoites enter the small - intestinal epithelium and tranform into rapidly dividing tachyzoites (endozoites). The tachyzoites can infect and replicate in all mammalian cells except red blood cells. Tissue cysts containing many bradyzoite develop 7-10 days after systemic tachyzoite infection. These tissue cysts occur in a variety of host organs but persist principally within the CNS and muscle. 2. Feline stage (sexual stage). This stage takes place in the definitive host (cat). This cycle is associated with formation of oocysts, which are excreted in cat feces, Mature oocysts contain 2 sporocysts, each with 4 sporozoites. The formation of tissue cysts in cats constitutes the other part of feline cycle.",

        "exp": "Naegleria fowleri, the only pathogenic species of naegleria Human infection comes from water containing the amoebae and usually follows swimming or diving in ponds. Patients are mostly previously healthy young adults or children. The amoebae invade the nasal mucosa, pass through the olfactory nerve branches in the cribriform plate into the meninges and brain to initiate an acute purulent meningitis and encephalitis (primary amoebic meningoencephalitis). The incubation period is 2 days to 2 weeks. The disease almost always ends fatally within a week Diagnosis can be made by CSF examination. The fluid is cloudy to purulent, with prominent neutrophil leucocytosis, elevated proteins and low glucose, resembling pyogenic meningitis. Failure to find bacteria in such specimens should raise the possibility of PAM. Wet film examination of CSF may show the trophozoites. Cysts are never seen CSF or brain. At autopsy, trophozoites can be demonstrated in brain histologically. Culture can be obtained in agar seeded with Escherichia coli or in the usual cell cultures used for virus isolation. Both trophozoites and cysts occur in culture. Amphotericin B has been used in treatment with limited success TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL PARASITOLOGY, CKJ PANIKER, 6. TH EDITION, PAGE NO 33",
