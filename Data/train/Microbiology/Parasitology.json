Intraery throcytic infection of Babesiosis is characterised by maltese cross. Maltese cross is a characteristic arrangement of parasites within the erythrocytes - Parasites within erythrocytes are arranged such that pointed ends of four parasites come in contact thereby giving a tetrad configuration resembling a maltese cross. Tetrad forms or 'Maltese cross' appearance is considered pathognomic of Babesiosis. o Clinically Babesiosis presents with chills, fever, mild hepatosplenomegaly, and mild hemolytic anemia, o Treatment includes Atovaquone plus azithromycin or quinine plus clindamycin. o Babesiosis can easily be confused with P. falciparum malaria. Following two features distinguish Babesiosis from malaria. Presence of maltese cross in Babesiosis (absent in malaria). Absence of pigment Hemozoin in Babesiosis (present in malaria). Note - Maltese cross is also seen in cryptococcus and aspergillus.",

Incubation:# Symptoms of acute schistosomiasis begin about a month after infection. Signs and Symptoms# Acute schistosomiasis ->>Katayama fever. Q# The last (chronic) stage varies according to species, i. e., S. japonica, 5. mansoni, and S. mekongi primarily affect liver and intestines; while S. haematobium primarily affects the urinary tract.# In general, patients with chronic schistosomiasis tend to present in developed countries with lethargy, colicky abdominal pain, mucoid/bloody diarrhea, or dysuria and hematuria.# Chronic hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is a consequence of eggs retained in tissue and prolonged infection - usually of > 10 years duration.# Fibrosis may cause portal hypertension, splenomegaly, or esophageal or gastric varices. Q# Chronic genitourinary schistosomiasis is associated with chronic 5. haematobium infection.# Hematuria and dysuria are common from the acute through chronic stages. Bladder cancer rates are increased in endemic areas. Salmonella infection concurrent with schistosomiasis is common and is resistant to treatment unless the schistosomiasis is also treated. Diagnosis# Diagnosis of S. japonicum and S. mansoni is by the presence of ova in feces or tissue. Diagnosis of S. haematobium is by the presence of ova in urine or tissue. However, ova loads are not always sufficient for diagnosis, especially in long-standing chronic illness. Immunofluorescent antibody tests and antigen detection assays are increasingly used.# \"Fetal head\" bladder calcification may be shown in X-rays in chronic S. haematobium infection. QTreatment# For S. haematobium and S. mansoni, praziquantel 20/kg po bid for one day; for S. japonica and S. mekongi, praziquantel 20/kg po tid for one day are the treatments of choice.# S. mansoni may also be treated with oxamniquine in a single po dose (with food) of 15 mg/kg. S. haematobium in North and East Africa may be treated with metrifonate 7. 5-10 mg/kg every other week for a total of 3 doses. Also Know:# The second most common urologic cancer and the most frequent malignant tumor of the urinary tract is bladder cancer. Usually a transitional cell carcinoma. Most prevalent in men during the sixth and seventh decades. Risk factors include smoking, diets rich in meat and fat, schistosomiasis, chronic treatment with cyclophosphamide, and exposure to aniline dye (a benzene derivative).# Causes of portal hypertesnion are as follows: 1. Presinusoidal: Splenic or portal vein thrombosis, schistosomiasis. granulomatous disease. 2. Sinusoidal: Cirrhosis, granulomatous disease. 3.

The infective form is the cyst, which is ingested in contaminated food or drink. excystment takes place in the small intestine and the liberated trophozoites reach the large intestine where they feed and multiply as lumen commensals. Infection is very often confined to the lumen and is asymptomatic. Clinical disease results only when the trophozoites burrow into the intestinal mucosa, set up colonies and initiate inflammatory reaction. This leads to mucosal ulcers and submucosal abscesses. resembling the lesions in amoebiasis. Clinically also, balantidiasis resembles amoebiasis, causing diarrhoea or frank dysentery with abdominal colic, tenesmus, nausea and vomiting.

The species sometimes is called the Japanese Lung fluke or Oriental Lung fluke. c. Unembryonated eggs are passed in the sputum of a human or feline. Two weeks later, miracidia develop in the egg and hatches. d. The miracidia penetrate its first intermediate host (snail). Within the snail mother sporocyst form and produce many mother rediae, which subsequently produce many daughter rediae which shed crawling cercariae into fresh water. e. The crawling cercariae penetrate fresh water crabs and encyst in its muscles becoming metacercaria. Humans or felines then eat the infected crabs raw. Once eaten, the metacercaria excyst and penetrates the gut, diaphragm and lung where it becomes an adult worm in pairs, f. The first intermediate hosts of the Paragonimus westermani are freshwater snails. g. Transmission of the parasite P. westermani to humans and mammals primarily occurs through the consumption of raw or undercooked seafoodh. Animals such as pigs, dogs, and a variety of feline species can also harbour P. westermani. i. Diagnosis is based on microscopic demonstration of eggs in stool or sputum, but these are not present until 2 to 3 months after infection. However, eggs are also occasionally encountered in effusion fluid or biopsy material. Furthermore, you can use morphologic comparisons with other intestinal parasites to diagnose potential causative agents.

The larva travel through the ampulla of Vater and mature into adult worms in bile canaliculi. The adult worms release small operculated eggs which pass with bile into the intestines and are voided with stools. Most of the infections are asymptomatic because of the low worm burden.

The acute stage lasts two-four months and the chronic stage may be life-long.# Acute stage - Signs and Symptoms- About 50% of patients develop either a nodular lesion or furuncle (chagoma) at the site of the bite.- Conjunctival contamination with the vector's feces results in unilateral painless palpebral and periorbital swelling (Romana's sign) and associated lymphadenopathy of nodes draining the lesion. Other symptoms include prolonged fever, tachycardia, fatigue, anemia, weakness, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and myocarditis.- It lasts 4-8 weeks and in rare cases may include myocarditis or meningoencephalitis.- In severe cases temporary electrocardiogram changes are seen, especially first degree A/V block.# chronic stage - Signs and Symptoms- The parasites have an affinity for smooth, skeletal, and heart muscle; and the nervous system.- The heart is the most commonly effected organ, with manifestations including CHF (often right sided), rhythm disturbances, thromboembolism, and cardiomyopathy.- Megaesophagus may occur, with dysphagia, odynophagia, chest pain, cough, and regurgitation.# Rx:- Nifurtimox",

Anisakis and Gnathostoma are common agents associated with visceral Larva Migrans. Larva Migrans: The life cycle of most parasites include migration of larvae through various tissues and organs of the body. When such larvae are not able to complete their journey through host&; s tissue to reach localization in their normal abode, their normal progress is arrested and they may localize in unexpected tissue or organs. This condition is called larvae migrans and is generally seen when human infection occurrs with nonhuman species of nematodes. According to the mode of entrance and localization two type of larva migrans are recognized: Cutaneous Larva Migrans (Creeping eruption) Visceral Larva Migrans Caused by larvae that enter by skin penetration Ancylostoma (most common) Strongyloides stercoralis Ectopic infection with Fasciola & Paragonimus Caused by larvae that enter by oral route Toxocara canis (dog ascarid) Toxocara cati (cat ascarid) Anisakis (Anisakiasis) Gnathostoma (Gnathostomiasis) Transient creeping eruptions may also caused by Nector Americanus, Gnathostomiasis, Sparaganosis Creeping miasis may be caused by flies of genus Hypoderma & Gastrophillus.

Disease may result either due to mechanical effects or allergic reaction. The worms lie threaded into the caecal mucosa and even though it is not a blood feeder, oozing of blood may occur at the sites of attachment. The blood loss is about 0. 005 ml per worm per day. Over a period of time this may lead to anemia and malnutrition. It has been suggested that mechanical blockage of the appendiceal lumen by masses of whipworms may cause acute appendicitis. In heavy infection, the worm may be abundant on the colonic mucosa, even upto the rectum. Mucus diarrhoea, chronic dysentery and abdominal pain are frequently seen in such cases. Some patients, paicularly young children may develop rectal prolapse. REF: TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL PARASITOLOGY; CKJ PANIKER; 6. TH EDITION; PAGE NO165",

Infection is very often confined to the lumen and is asymptomatic. Clinical disease results only when the trophozoites burrow into the intestinal mucosa, set up colonies and initiate inflammatory reaction. This leads to mucosal ulcers and submucosal abscesses resembling the lesions in amoebiasis. Clinically also, balantidiasis resembles amoebiasis, causing diarrhoea or frank dysentery with abdominal colic, tenesmus, nausea and vomiting. Occasionally there may occur intestinal perforation with peritonitis and rarely involvement of genital and urinary tracts. Diagnosis Diagnosis is established by demonstration of the parasite in faeces. While motile trophozoites occur in diarrhoeic faeces, cysts are found in formed stools.

The Sabin Feldman dye test is the gold standard to which all serologic tests performed to detect anti-T. gondii antibodies are compared. It is a neutralization test in which the patients serum is incubated with complement and live Toxoplasma organisms, and a dye is employed to quantify the bound antibody. It allows early detection of the infection and has high sensitivity and specificity in both acute and chronic phases. This test makes use of the uptake by Toxoplasma tachyzoites of the dye methylene blue (in which organisms appear swollen and blue). The tachyzoites membranes lyse in the presence of complement and specific antibody (Primarily IgG) resulting thin, unstained-appearing organisms. This test has been used extensively as a screening test for toxoplasma infection; it has been recommended as the test of choice for antenatal maternal screening, but it is available only in reference laboratories. However, it is no longer used because it requires maintenance of live virulent parasites in the laboratory, and equally good, safer methods have been developed. Currently, the Sabin Feldman dye test is restricted to research centers as a method to standardize new tests.",

        "question": "The cycle of malaria parasite is in sequence of -",
        "exp": "Schizogony in the Human Host: Man is the intermediate host for malaria, wherein the asexual phase of the life cycle occurs. The sporozoites inoculated by the infested mosquito initiate this phase of the cycle from the liver, and the latter pa continues within the red blood cells, which results in the various clinical manifestations of the disease. Pre-erythrocytic Phase - Schizogony in the Liver: With the mosquito bite, tens to a few hundred invasive sporozoites are introduced into the skin. Following the intradermal deposition, some sporozoites are destroyed by the local macrophages, some enter the lymphatics, and some others find a blood vessel. The sporozoites that enter a lymphatic vessel reach the draining lymph node wherein some of the sporozoites paially develop into exoerythrocytic stages and may also prime the T cells to mount a protective immune response. The sporozoites that find a blood vessel reach the liver within a few hours. It has recently been shown that the sporozoites travel by a continuous sequence of stick-and-slip motility, using the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) family and an actin-myosin motor. The sporozoites then negotiate through the liver sinusoids, and migrate into a few hepatocytes, and then multiply and grow within parasitophorous vacuoles. Each sporozoite develop into a schizont containing 10, 000-30, 000 merozoites (or more in case of P. falciparum). The growth and development of the parasite in the liver cells is facilitated by a a orable environment created by the The circumsporozoite protein of the parasite. The entire pre-eryhrocytic phase lasts about 5-16 days depending on the parasite species: on an average 5-6 days for P. falciparum, 8 days for P. vivax, 9 days for P. ovale, 13 days for P. malariae and 8-9 days for P. knowlesi. The pre-erythrocytic phase remains a \"silent\" phase, with little pathology and no symptoms, as only a few hepatocytes are affected. This phase is also a single cycle, unlike the next, erythrocytic stage, which occurs repeatedly.",

        "exp": "CLONORCHIS SINENSIS Commonly known as the Chinese liver fluke, Embryonated eggs are discharged in the biliary ducts and in the stool. Eggs are ingested by a suitable snail intermediate host. Each egg releases a miracidia, which go through several developmental stages (sporocysts, rediae, and cercariae ). The cercariae are released from the snail and after a sho period of free-swimming time in water, they come in contact and penetrate the flesh of freshwater fish, where they encyst as metacercariae. Infection of humans occurs by ingestion of undercooked, salted, pickled, or smoked freshwater fish. After ingestion, the metacercariae excyst in the duodenum and ascend the biliary tract through the ampulla of Vater. Maturation takes approximately 1 month. The adult flukes (measuring 10 to 25 mm by 3 to 5 mm) reside in small and medium sized biliary ducts. In addition to humans, carnivorous animals can serve as reservoir hosts. The migration of the larva up the bile duct induces desquamation, followed by hyperplasia and sometimes adenomatous changes. The smaller bile ducts undergo cystic dilatation. The adult worm may cause obstruction and blockage of the common bile duct leading to cholangitis. Chronic infection may result in calculus formation. A few cases go on to biliary cirrhosis and poal hypertension. Some patients with chronic clonorchiasis tend to become biliary carriers of typhoid bacilli. Chronic infection has also been linked with cholangiocarcinoma. Patients in the early stage have fever, epigastric pain, diarrhoea and tender hepatomegaly. This is followed by biliary colic, jaundice and progressive liver enlargement. Many infections are asymptomatic REF: TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL PARASITOLOGY; CKJ PANIKER; 6. TH EDITION; PAGE NO 128",

The presence of G. lamblia in the glandular crypts of duodenal-jejunal mucosa may not cause any pathology. These flagellates do not invade the tissues, but feed on mucous secretions. With the sucking disc it attaches to the surface of the epithelial cells. Patient may compiain of dull epigastric pain, flatulence and chronic diarrhea of steatorrhoea type. The stool is voluminous, foul smelling and contains large amount of mucus and fat but no blood. This is due to malabsorption since the parasites are coated on the mucosa, thus absorption suffers.

        "exp": "Xenodiagnosis is used in the diagnosis of Chagas disease, which is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a hemoflagellate. There are four morphologic forms of hemoflagellates. In man, they may be intracellular, in which they are called leishmanial forms; or, they may be located extracellularly in the blood, in which they are called trypanosomes. The insect vectors may have leptomonads (promastigotes) or crithidial (epimastigote) forms. Leishmaniasis (cutaneous, mucocutaneous/and visceral) only has the leishmania, intracellular forms present in man. In Mrican trypanosomiasis, only the extracellular, or trypanosomal form, is present in man. Chagas disease has both the intracellular (leishmanial) and extracellular (trypanosomal) forms. Chagas disease is rampant in South America and is the major cause of progressive heart failure and death in that area. T cruzi is a flagellated protozoan that is transmitted to man by the bite of the Reduviid bug, or kissing bug, which usually occurs during the night. Sholy after the bite, the bug defecates on the wound site and the sleeping host rubs the organisms into the wound. Periorbital inflammation develops, which is called Romana's sign. Trypanosomes circulate in the blood and leishmanial forms invade (1) the reticuloendothelial cells, producing hepatosplenomegaly; (2) the heart muscle, causing myocarditis and arrhythmias; (3) the brain, producing a meningoencephalitis; and (4) into the gastrointestinal tract, where the leishmania destroy the ganglion cells in the distal esophagus and rectum to produce acquired achalasia and Hirschsprung disease, respectively. Laboratory diagnosis is made by (1) finding trypanosomes in the blood, (2) finding leishmanial forms in tissue, (3) culture, (4) serology, and (5) xenodiagnosis. Xenodiagnosis is a method of inoculation in which sterile Reduviid bugs are fed or offered the blood of an infected patient. After a few weeks, the bug's intestinal contents are examined for presence or absence of the organism. Only 5% of patients die in the acute stage of heart failure, whereas in chronic disease, heart failure is a common cause of death. Nifuimox is the drug of choice.",

LYMPHATIC FILARIASIS# Lymphatic filariasis is caused by W. bancrofti, B. malayi, or B. timori.# Humans are the only definitive host for the parasite.# Generally, W. bancrofti is noctumally periodic. (Nocturnally periodic forms of microfilariae are scarce in peripheral blood by day and increase at night, whereas subperiodic forms are present in peripheral blood at all times and reach maximal levels in the afternoon)# Natural vectors for W. bancrofti: Culex fatigans in urban settings and anopheline or aedean mosq in rural areas.# B. malayi has 2 forms distinguished by periodicity of microfilaremia. The more common nocturnal form is transmitted in areas of coastal rice fields, while subperiodic form in forests. B. malayi naturally infects cats and humans. Diagnosis# Microfilariae can be found in blood, hydrocele fluid, or in other body fluids, detection by Knott's concentration technique.# Two tests are commercially available: one is ELISA and the other a rapid-format immunochromatographic card test. Both assays have sensitivities that range from 96 to 100% and specificities that approach 100%.# Doppler examination of the scrotum or the female breast may result in the identification of motile adult worms within dilated lymphatics (termed the filaria dance sign).# Retrogradely evolving lymphangitis is a characteristic feature that helps distinguish filarial lymphangitis from typically ascending bacterial lymphangitis. Treatment# Diethylcarbamazine (DEC, 6 mg/kg daily for 12 days), which has both macro- and microfilaricidal properties, remains the treatment of choice for the individual with active lymphatic filariasis (microfilaremia, antigen positivity, or adult worms on ultrasound), although albendazole has also demonstrated macrofilaricidal efficacy.# Side effects of DEC treatment include fever, chills, arthralgias, headaches, nausea, and vomiting.# Ivermectin has a side effect profile similar to that of DEC when used in lymphatic filariasis.",

Cutaneous There may be a dermatitis, with erythema and itching at the site of penetration of the filariform larvae, paicularly when large numbers of larvae enter the skin. In those sensitised by prior infection, there may be an allergic response. This may prevent circulation in the blood of the larvae, which may instead migrate in skin, leading to a form of creeping eruption or larva migrans. Pulmonary During escape of the larvae from the pulmonary capillaries into the alveoli, small haemorrhages occur, along with cellular infiltration into alveoli and bronchioles. Larvae may be found in the sputum. Intestinal The symptoms may resemble those of peptic ulcer or of malabsorption syndrome. Mucus diarrhoea is often present. In heavy infection, the mucosa may be honeycombed with the worm and there may be extensive sloughing, causing dysenteric stools. Hyperinfection In debilitated individuals, and paicularly in those with cellular immune defects, extensive internal reinfection takes place, leading to enormous numbers of adult worms in the intestines and lungs, and larvae in various tissues and organs. This is known as hyperinfection. Severe malnutrition, lepromatous leprosy, lymphoreticular malignancies, AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs and other situations in which cellmediated immunity is defective, predispose to this condition. Hyperinfection is an impoant hazard of steroid therapy and other instances of prolonged immunosuppression as in tansplant patients. Manifestations depend on the sites affected.

In patients with severe Raynaud's phenomenon and refractory digital ulcers due to distal ulnar artery occlusion. Anticholinesterase test. Myasthenia gravis. Apnea test. Demonstration that apnea is due to irreversible medullary damage. Bentiromide testis an indirect measure of pancreatic function and reflects intraluminal chymotrypsin activity. The test has excellent specificity but is not very sensitive. Bernstein test. Heartburn is produced by heightened mucosal sensitivity and can be reproduced by infusion of dilute (0. 1 N) hydrochloric acid. Casoni's test. Echinococcosis. Coomb's test. Is the major tool for diagnosing autoimmune hemolysis. This test relies on the ability of antibodies specific for immunoglobulins (especially IgG) or complement components (especially C3) to agglutinate RBC coated with these proteins. With specific anti-IgG and anti-C3, the direct Coombs test detects IgG or C3 on the patient's RBC, which indicates the presence of immune hemolysis and may help define its cause. Desmopressin test. Severe pituitary or nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus can be differentiated by administering desmopressin (DDAVP, 0. 03 microg/kg subcutaneously or intravenously) and repeating the measurement of urine osmolarity 1 to 2 h later. An increase of >50% indicates severe pituitary Dl, whereas a smaller or absent response is strongly suggestive of nephrogenic Dl. Dexamethasone suppression test. The best screening procedure for Pituitary-Adrenal Suppressibility is the overnight dexamethasone suppression test. Dick test. Susceptibility to scarlet fever was correlated with results of the Dick test, in which a small amount of erythrogenic toxin injected intradermally produced local erythema in susceptible individuals but elicited no response in those with specific. Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) dye test or the dihydrorhodamine (DHR) oxidation test. Deficiencies of oxidative metabolism are detected with either the two. Drop arm test. The diagnosis of a complete tear of the rotator cuff is suggested by the drop arm test in which the patient is unable to maintain his or her arm outstretched once it is passively abducted. Finkelstein's test. De. Quervains tenosynovitis resulting from inflammation of the tendon sheath(s) involving the abductor poliicis longus or extensor pollicis brevis. Hydrogen breath test. Hydrogen breath testing after lactose ingestion may be performed for suspected lactase deficiency. Gastrin provocative tests(secretin stimu- lation test, the calcium infusion study, and a standard meal test). To differentiate between the causes of hypergastrinemia. Ham test. For many years, the diagnosis of PNH depended on the demonstration of the lysis of RBC after complement activation either by acid (Ham test) or by reduction in ionic strength (sucrose lysis test). These tests are inferior to the analysis of GPI-linked proteins (e. g., CD59, DAF) on RBC and granulocytes by flow cytometry. Head tilt test. Cardinal diagnostic feature of trochlear nerve palsy (The vertical diplopia is exacerbated by tilting the head towards the side with the muscle palsy, and alleviated by tilting it away). Mc. Murray testA positive Mc. Murray test may indicate a meniscal tear. Mazzotti test. Onchocerciasis. Swinging flashlight test. To elicit relative afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil). It is an extremely useful sign in retrobulbar optic neuritis and other optic nerve diseases, where it may be the sole objective evidence for disease. Schober test. Useful measure of lumbar spine flexion. String test. Strongyloides stercoralis. Tyramine test. To evaluate postganglionic adrenergic function.
