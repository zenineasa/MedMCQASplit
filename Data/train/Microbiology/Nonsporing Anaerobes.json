Oral cavityo Among the constituents of the oral flora, anaerobes are the predominant organisms, ranging in concentration from l09ml in saliva to 1012/ml in gingival scrapings. o In the oral cavity, the ratio of anaerobic to aerobic bacteria ranges from 1: 1 on the surface of tooth to 1000: 1 on the gingival crevices. Gastrointestinal tracto Anaerobic bacteria are not found in appreciable numbers in the normal upper intestine until the distal ileum, o In the colon, the proportion of anaerobes increases significantly as does the overall bacterial count, o For example in colon there are I011 to 1012 organism per gram of stool with an anerobe to aerobe ratio of 1000: 1. Female genital tracto In the female genital, there are ~ 10* organisms per millilitre of secretions with anaerobe to aerobe ratio ~ 10: 1.",
