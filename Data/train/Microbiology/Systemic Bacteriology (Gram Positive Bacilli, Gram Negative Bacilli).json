This disease has characteristic histopathology, and membranous plaques can be seen in the colon by endoscopy. It has been recently shown that C. difficile produces a protein toxin with a molecular weight of about 250, 000. The \"toxin\" is, in fact, two toxins, toxin A and toxin B. Both toxins are always present in fecal samples, but there is approximately one thousand times more toxin B than toxin A. Toxin A has enterotoxic activity--that is, it elicits a positive fluid response in ligated rabbit ileal loops-- whereas toxin B appears to be primarily a cytotoxin.",

Botulinum toxin is absorbed from the gut, enters the blood circulation, and binds to receptors of presynaptic membranes of motor neurons of PNS and cranial nerves. The toxin does not cross the blood brain barrier or affect the central nervous system. Botulinum toxins act by blocking the release of acetylcholine at synapses and neuromuscular junction- resulting in lack of muscle contraction and flaccid paralysis. C/F - Flaccid, symmetrical cranial nerve palsy -blurred vision, loss of pupilary reflexes. Symmetrical flaccid descending motor paralysis - Quadriparesis.",
