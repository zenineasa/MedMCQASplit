Therefore, it is called an exotoxin (i. e., a toxic protein that is secreted by bacterial cells). It is a single polypeptide chain held together by two disulfide bridges. Fragment A exhibits enzymatic activity, resulting in permanent inactivation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2), whereas fragment B binds to cells and mediates entry of the toxic poion. The diphtheria toxin binds to epithelial cells of the pharynx and initially produces local damage. However, the toxin is absorbed into the body and blood circulation (toxemia) and can induce deleterious effects distant from its site of production. Paralysis of the soft palate, pharynx, larynx, and respiratory muscles may appear weeks after onset of symptoms. The toxin may also cause myocarditis. Electrocardiography abnormalities correlate with the level of toxemia. In rare cases, hypotension, peripheral circulatory failure, and skin hemorrhages may occur.

One of the differences between syphilis and herpes simplex virus (HSV) is that an HSV lesion is excruciatingly painful. Treponemal organisms may be seen microscopically in the lesion if the lesion is scraped. If not treated, the chancre will disappear and the patient will be asymptomatic until he/she exhibits the signs/symptoms of secondary syphilis, which include a disseminated rash and systemic involvement such as meningitis, hepatitis, or nephritis. There are two kinds of tests for the detection of syphilis antibodies: nonspecific tests such as the RPR and VDRL, and specific tests such as the FTA, TPHA (Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test), and the MHTP (microhemagglutination-T. pallidum). The difference is that the nonspecific tests use a cross-reactive antigen known as cardiolipin, while the specific tests use a T. pallidum antigen. Although the nonspecific tests are sensitive, they lack specificity and often cross-react in patients who have diabetes, hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis, or who are pregnant. Some patients, especially those with autoimmune diseases, will have both nonspecific (RPR) and specific tests (FTA) positive. Resolution of such a situation can be done by molecular methods for T. pallidum such as PCR, or by the immobilization test using live spirochetes and the patient's serum.

Strains resistant to Penicillin and other antibiotics occur frequently, so it is essential to perform antibiotic sensitivity for proper therapy. Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins and offer low-level resistance to aminoglycosides. In penicillin-sensitive strains, synergism occurs with combination treatment with Penicillin and aminoglycosides. If strains showed high-level resistance to aminoglycosides, this synergism does not occur. The drug of choice in such cases is vancomycin. Recently vancomycin-resistant Enterococci have begun to emerge. The phenotypes are Van A, B, C, D and E. The mechanism is an alteration of D-alanyl-D-alanine chain in the cell wall.

Strains resistant to Penicillin and other antibiotics occur frequently, So it is essential to perform antibiotic sensitivity for proper therapy. Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins and offer low-level resistance to aminoglycosides. In penicillin-sensitive strains, synergism occurs with combination treatment with Penicillin and aminoglycosides. If strains showed high-level resistance to aminoglycosides, this synergism does not occur. The drug of choice in such cases is vancomycin. Recently vancomycin-resistant Enterococci have begun to emerge. The phenotypes are Van A, B, C, D and E. The mechanism is an alteration of the D-alanyl-D-alanine chain in the cell wall.

The first step in infection is adhesion of gonococci to the urethra or other mucosal surfaces. Pili are involved in this adhesion. Adhesion is rapid and firm so that micturition after exposure offers no protection against infection. The cocci penetrate through the intercellular spaces and reach the subepithelial connective tissue by the third day of infection. The incubation period is 2-8 days. In men, the disease stas as an acute urethritis with a mucopurulent discharge containing gonococci in large numbers. The infection extends along the urethra to prostrate, seminal vesicles and epididymis. The infection may spread to the periurethral tissues, causing abscess and multiple discharging sinuses: Watercan perineum.

Present as fever, hypotension, myalgia, vomiting, diarrhea, mucosal hyperemia and an erythematous rash which desquamates subsequently. This is associated with infection of mucosal or sequestered sites by toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST)-Producing S. aureus strains usually belonging to bacteriophage group I. TSST type I (formerly known as enterotoxin type F or pyrogenic exotoxin C)is most often responsible, though enterotoxin B or C may also cause the syndrome. Staphylococcal enterotoxins and TSST -1 are superantigens which are a potent activator of T lymphocytes. Being Vbeta-restricted T cell mitogens, such superantigens stimulates large numbers of T cells without relation to their epitope specificity. This leads to excessive and deregulated immune response, with the release of cytokines interleukins 1, 2, tumour necrosis factor and interferon gamma. This explains multisystem involvement and florid manifestation in staphylococcal food poisoning and TSS. Soft tissue infections with some M types of S. pyogens (1, 3, 12, 28) may sometimes cause a toxic shock syndrome resembling staphylococcal TSS.

It is a gram-negative microaerophilic rod found most commonly in the deeper poions of the mucous gel coating the gastric mucosa or between the mucous layer and the gastric epithelium. The paicular end result of H. pylori infection (gastritis, PUD, gastric MALT lymphoma, gastric cancer) is determined by a complex interplay between bacterial and host factors. Bacterial factors: H. pylori is able to facilitate gastric residence, induce mucosal injury, and avoid host defense. Different strains of H. pylori produce different virulence factors. A specific region of the bacterial genome, the pathogenicity island (cag-PAI), encodes the virulence factors Cag A and pic B. Vac A also contributes to pathogenicity, although it is not encoded within the pathogenicity island. These virulence factors, in conjunction with additionalbacterial constituents, can cause mucosal damage, in pa through their ability to target the host immune cells. Host factors: Elevated concentrations of multiple cytokines are found in the gastric epithelium of H. pylori-infected individuals, including interleukin (IL) 1a/b, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a, and interferon (IFN) g. H. pylori infection also leads to both a mucosal and a systemic humoral response, which does not lead to the eradication of the bacteria but fuher compounds epithelial cell injury.

The lack of a cell wall in mycoplasmas makes them intrinsically resistant to beta-lactams and to all antimicrobials which target the cell wall. Mycoplasma are susceptible to agents that interfere with protein synthesis, such as tetracyclines, macrolides and aminoglycosides and to the fluoroquinolones that act by inhibiting topoisomerases. Tetracyclines are the drug of choice for mycoplasma infections. Antibiotic resistance of Macrolides: Innate antibiotic resistance is defined as resistance that is found in all members of a group of bacteria. For mycoplasmas, two kinds of innate or intrinsic resistance have to be considered, one related to the class Mollicutes, and one related to the different mycoplasma and ureaplasma species. These differences in innate antibiotic susceptibility have been used to isolate mycoplasmas. Resistance related to class molecules Resistance to Macrolide-Lincosamide-Streptogramin-Ketolide (MLSK) group The lack of cell wall makes all the members of the class Mollicutes intrinsically resistant to Beta-lactams and to all antimicrobials such as glycopeptides and fosfomycin, which target the cell wall. In addition, mycoplasmas are also resistant to polymyxins, sulphonamides, trimethoprim, nalidixic acid and rifampin Resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin-Ketolide (MLSK) group differs between species.

L. pneumophila is a facultative intracellular pathogen and enters macrophages without activating their oxidizing capabilities. The organisms bind to macrophage C receptors, which promote engulfment.

The plate is incubated at 37degC for 24-48 hours. The toxin produced by the bacterial growth will diffuse in agar and where it meets the antitoxin at optimum concentration, will produce a line of precipitation. The presence of such arrow headlines of a precipitate indicates the strain is toxigenic. No precipitate is formed in the case of non-toxigenic strains.

        "exp": "Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a febrile illness seen predominantly, but not exclusively, in menstruating women. Clinical criteria for TSS include fever greater than 102degF (38. 9degC), rash, hypotension, and abnormalities of the mucous membranes and the gastrointestinal, hepatic, muscular, cardiovascular, or central nervous system. Usually three or more systems are involved. Treatment is suppoive, including the aggressive use of antistaphylococcal antibiotics. Ceain types of tampons may play a role in TSS by trapping O2 and depleting magnesium. Most people have protective antibodies to the toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1). Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is caused by a toxin-producing strain of Staphylococcus aureus (TSST-1). While there have been repos that S. epidermidis produces TSS, they have largely been discounted. Vaginal colonization with S. aureus is a necessary adjunct to the disease. S. aureus is isolated from the vaginal secretions, conjunctiva, nose, throat, cervix, and feces in 45 to 98% of cases. The organism has infrequently been isolated from the blood Epidemiologic investigations suggest strongly that toxic shock syndrome is related to use of tampons, in paicular, use of the highly absorbent ones that can be left in for extended periods of time. An increased growth of intravaginal S. aureus and enhanced production of TSST-1 have been associated with the prolonged intravaginal use of these hyperabsorbent tampons and with the capacity of the materials used in them to bind magnesium. The most severe cases of TSS have been seen in association with Gram-negative infection. TSST-1 may enhance endotoxin activity. Recently, group A streptococci have been repoed to cause TSS.

The term enteric fever includes typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi and paratyphoid fever caused by Salmonella paratyphi A, B and C. As bile is a good culture medium for bacilli, they multiply abundantly in the gallbladder and are discharged continuously into the intestine, where it causes inflammation and necrosis leaving behind the characteristic typhoid ulcers. Ulceration of the bowel leads to two major complications: intestinal perforation and hemorrhage. The typical features are step ladder pyrexia with relative bradycardia and toxemia. A soft palpable spleen is a constant finding. Hepatosplenomegaly is also common. Rose spots that fade on pressure appear on the skin during the second or third week.

Staphylococcal enterotoxins and TSST-1 are superantigens which are potent activators of T lymphocytes. Being V beta-restricted T cell mitogens, such superantigens stimulate very large numbers of T cells, without relation to their epitope specificity. This leads to an excessive and dysregulated immune response, with the release of cytokines interleukins 1 and 2, tumor necrosis factor and interferon gamma.

Although disease caused by M. pneumoniae can be contracted year-round, thousands of cases occur during the winter months in all age groups. The disease, if untreated, will persist for 2 weeks or longer. Rare but serious side effects include cardiomyopathies and central nervous system complications. Infection with M. pneumoniae may be treated with either erythromycin or tetracycline. The organism lacks a cell wall and so is resistant to the penicillin and the cephalosporin groups of antibiotics. Until recently, diagnostic tests have been of limited value. Up to 50% of cases may not show cold agglutinins, an insensitive and nonspecific acute-phase reactant. However, if cold agglutinins are present, a quick diagnosis can be made if signs and symptoms are characteristic. Complement fixation tests that measure an antibody to a glycolipid antigen of M. pneumoniae are useful but not routinely performed in most laboratories. Also, cross-reactions may occur. Culture of M. pneumoniae, while not technically difficult, may take up to 2 weeks before visible growth is observed. A DNA probe is available. It is an 125I probe for the 16S ribosomal RNA of M. pneumoniae. Evaluations in a number of laboratories indicate that compared with culture it is highly sensitive and specific.

Both toxins are always present in fecal samples, but there is approximately one thousand times more toxin B than toxin A.
