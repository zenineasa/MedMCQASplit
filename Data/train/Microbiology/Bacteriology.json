Once isolated, there are a variety of tests to speciate enterococci.

These isolates have become one of the most feared nosocomial pathogens in the hospital environment.

Fragment A exhibits enzymatic activity, resulting in permanent inactivation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2), whereas fragment B binds to cells and mediates entry of the toxic poion. The diphtheria toxin binds to epithelial cells of the pharynx and initially produces local damage. However, the toxin is absorbed into the body and blood circulation (toxemia) and can induce deleterious effects distant from its site of production. Paralysis of the soft palate, pharynx, larynx, and respiratory muscles may appear weeks after onset of symptoms. The toxin may also cause myocarditis. Electrocardiography abnormalities correlate with the level of toxemia. In rare cases, hypotension, peripheral circulatory failure, and skin hemorrhages may occur.

One of the differences between syphilis and herpes simplex virus (HSV) is that an HSV lesion is excruciatingly painful. Treponemal organisms may be seen microscopically in the lesion if the lesion is scraped. If not treated, the chancre will disappear and the patient will be asymptomatic until he/she exhibits the signs/symptoms of secondary syphilis, which include a disseminated rash and systemic involvement such as meningitis, hepatitis, or nephritis. There are two kinds of tests for the detection of syphilis antibodies: nonspecific tests such as the RPR and VDRL, and specific tests such as the FTA, TPHA (Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test), and the MHTP (microhemagglutination-T. pallidum). The difference is that the nonspecific tests use a cross-reactive antigen known as cardiolipin, while the specific tests use a T. pallidum antigen. Although the nonspecific tests are sensitive, they lack specificity and often cross-react in patients who have diabetes, hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis, or who are pregnant. Some patients, especially those with autoimmune diseases, will have both nonspecific (RPR) and specific tests (FTA) positive. Resolution of such a situation can be done by molecular methods for T. pallidum such as PCR, or by the immobilization test using live spirochetes and the patient's serum.

However, if the strain shows high-level resistant to aminoglycosides, this synergism does not occur. The choice of drugs for infections due to such strains is vancomycin.

Strains resistant to Penicillin and other antibiotics occur frequently, so it is essential to perform antibiotic sensitivity for proper therapy. Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins and offer low-level resistance to aminoglycosides. In penicillin-sensitive strains, synergism occurs with combination treatment with Penicillin and aminoglycosides. If strains showed high-level resistance to aminoglycosides, this synergism does not occur. The drug of choice in such cases is vancomycin. Recently vancomycin-resistant Enterococci have begun to emerge. The phenotypes are Van A, B, C, D and E. The mechanism is an alteration of D-alanyl-D-alanine chain in the cell wall.

Also causes endocarditis, infection of the biliary tract, septicemia and intra-abdominal abscess complicating diveiculitis and peritonitis. Strains resistant to Penicillin and other antibiotics occur frequently, So it is essential to perform antibiotic sensitivity for proper therapy. Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins and offer low-level resistance to aminoglycosides. In penicillin-sensitive strains, synergism occurs with combination treatment with Penicillin and aminoglycosides. If strains showed high-level resistance to aminoglycosides, this synergism does not occur. The drug of choice in such cases is vancomycin. Recently vancomycin-resistant Enterococci have begun to emerge. The phenotypes are Van A, B, C, D and E. The mechanism is an alteration of the D-alanyl-D-alanine chain in the cell wall.

This is associated with infection of mucosal or sequestered sites by toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST)-Producing S. aureus strains usually belonging to bacteriophage group I. TSST type I (formerly known as enterotoxin type F or pyrogenic exotoxin C)is most often responsible, though enterotoxin B or C may also cause the syndrome. Staphylococcal enterotoxins and TSST -1 are superantigens which are a potent activator of T lymphocytes. Being Vbeta-restricted T cell mitogens, such superantigens stimulates large numbers of T cells without relation to their epitope specificity. This leads to excessive and deregulated immune response, with the release of cytokines interleukins 1, 2, tumour necrosis factor and interferon gamma. This explains multisystem involvement and florid manifestation in staphylococcal food poisoning and TSS. Soft tissue infections with some M types of S. pyogens (1, 3, 12, 28) may sometimes cause a toxic shock syndrome resembling staphylococcal TSS.

Urea that has been with radioactive carbon isotopes (C14 or C13) is administered orally to the patient.

Detection of labelled CO2 in the patient&; s breath confirms the diagnosis of H. pylori. Assessment of success of Treatment with eradication of H. pylori should be done atleast 4 weeks after completetion of anti H. pylori therapy. Non-invasive tests are typically preferred for assessment of eradication. The test of choice for documenting eradication is urease breath test.

The most common source of infection in human patients and carriers, animals and inanimate objects being less impoant. Patients with superficial infections and respiratory infection disseminate large numbers of staphylococci into the environment. About 10-30 percent of healthy persons carry staphylococci in the nose and about 10 percent in the perineum and also on the hair. The vaginal carriage is about 5-10 percent. Staphylococcal carriage stas early in life, colonization of the umbilical stump being very common in babies born in hospitals. Some carriers called 'shedders', disseminate very large number of cocci for prolonged periods. The cocci shed by patients and carriers contaminate fomites such as handkerchiefs, bed linen and blankets and may persist on them for days or weeks. Healthcare-associated infections by staphylococci deserve special attention because of frequency and because they are caused by strains resistant to various antibiotics. Epidemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, also called EMRSA, get easily disseminated in a hospital environment and are responsible for post-operative wound infections and other cross infections in the hospital. They are multidrug-resistant most of the time. HA-MRSA (hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and CA-MRSA(community acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) are a public health concern now as the division between the two is getting blurred and both the types are circulating in the community as well as hospital.

        "exp": "Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes a respiratory infection known as primary atypical pneumonia or walking pneumonia. Although disease caused by M. pneumoniae can be contracted year-round, thousands of cases occur during the winter months in all age groups. The disease, if untreated, will persist for 2 weeks or longer. Rare but serious side effects include cardiomyopathies and central nervous system complications. Infection with M. pneumoniae may be treated with either erythromycin or tetracycline. The organism lacks a cell wall and so is resistant to the penicillin and the cephalosporin groups of antibiotics. Until recently, diagnostic tests have been of limited value. Up to 50% of cases may not show cold agglutinins, an insensitive and nonspecific acute-phase reactant. However, if cold agglutinins are present, a quick diagnosis can be made if signs and symptoms are characteristic. Complement fixation tests that measure an antibody to a glycolipid antigen of M. pneumoniae are useful but not routinely performed in most laboratories. Also, cross-reactions may occur. Culture of M. pneumoniae, while not technically difficult, may take up to 2 weeks before visible growth is observed. A DNA probe is available. It is an 125I probe for the 16S ribosomal RNA of M. pneumoniae. Evaluations in a number of laboratories indicate that compared with culture it is highly sensitive and specific.
