Typhoid bacilli grow rapidly on ordinary media and optimum temperature of growth is 37degC. Blood culture The organisms can be best isolated during the first 7-10 days of the illness, but in at least half the cases the organisms can still be isolated in the second and the third weeks. Periodic subcultures are made after day 2, 5 and 7 on Mac. Conkey agar. No growth after seven days may be regarded as negative. A positive blood culture is diagnostic, while the same significance cannot be attached to isolation from feces or urine. Cultural characters The growth on Mac. Conkey agar/ DCA is pale yellow (non lactose fermenting) colonies, 2-3 mm in diameter, moist, circular and smooth convex surface. These are catalase positive and oxidase negative. The biochemical reactions which differentiate S. typhi from other genera are: Glucose fermentation + Mannitol fermentation + Lactose fermentation? Sucrose fermentation - H2S production - Phenylalanine deaminase? Citrate utilization + Widal test In this test the patient's serum is tested by tube agglutination test for its titres of antibodies against H, 0 and Vi suspensions of enteric fever bacteria that are commonly encountered in an area such as S. typhi and S. paratyphiA.

        "exp": "This patient has Candida esophagitis. Any time a patient presents with dysphagia or odynophagia and you note white plaques in the oropharynx (thrush), you can assume that the Candida is affecting the esophagus as well. The fact that the patient is an IV drug user makes an oppounistic infection such as Candida more likely. Candida appears as budding yeast with pseudohyphae in vivo. The other answer choices represent the morphology of other impoant oppounistic fungi: Cryptococcus are encapsulated yeast. You should think about Cryptococcus neoformans when you're presented with an immunocompromised patient with neurological symptoms. The classic clue is the presence of encapsulated organisms observable in an India ink preparation. Mucor and Rhizopus are molds with nonseptate hyphae. You should think about Mucor when you are presented with a diabetic (especially ketoacidosis) or a leukemic patient with a severe sinus infection. Aspergillus is a mold with septate hyphae. In immunocompromised patients, aspergillosis can present with acute pneumonia, often with cavitation (aspergillomas = fungus balls in the lungs). Ref: Mc. Quaid K. R. (2013). Chapter 15.

Acid-fast staining demonstrates acid-fast bacilli within these lesions. No other lesions were found in the remaining organs and systems. Which of the following is the MOST accurate interpretation of these findings?",
        "exp": "The Ghon complex is the most frequent pathologic form of primary pulmonary tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis first localizes in the lung parenchyma and then in the hilar lymph nodes. In both these locations, a granulomatous reaction takes place. These lesions usually heal by fibrosis, leaving only small scars at the sites of remote tuberculous infection. In some cases, owing to immunosuppression (e. g., AIDS, immunosuppressant treatment, and lymphomas), reactivation of dormant bacilli in old lesions or additional re-exposure leads to secondary tuberculosis, with progression of lesions. Sometimes, active lesions of the Ghon complex are discovered by chance at autopsy. More frequently, scars due to remote healed tuberculosis are found postmoem and listed in autopsy repos as incidental findings. Also know: Cavitary tuberculosis and miliary tuberculosis are expressions of secondary infection, following reactivation of old, usually clinically silent, lesions. The cavitary form is characterized by development of large areas of liquefactive necrosis that empty into the air spaces, leading to cavities within the lung parenchyma. The miliary form is due to lymphohematogenous dissemination and subsequent seeding of tubercle bacilli throughout the body, with myriad small granulomas forming in the lungs, spleen, liver, bone marrow, retina, and adrenals, for example. Acid-fast bacilli suggest tuberculosis, rather than an infection with a fungus such as Histoplasma. Ref: Raviglione M. C., O'Brien R. J. (2012). Chapter 165. Tuberculosis. In D. L. Longo, A. S.

Pseudomonas is also associated with many other clinical syndromes, including infection following traumatic wounds to the feet in persons wearing sneakers or rubber-soled shoes, since the organism can be cultured from the shoes. Must know: Haemophilus influenzae produces a variety of clinical syndromes. H. Influenzae is the third-most common cause of meningitis in children aged 1 month to 18 years. It is the most common cause of acute epiglottitis, the most common cause of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis, and the second-most common cause of otitis media. Patients at risk include those with COPD and cystic fibrosis, alcoholics, splenectomized patients, and young patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a gram-negative organism that produces a necrotizing pneumonia in diabetics and alcoholics. Patients typically present with an abrupt onset of fever, shaking chills, and purulent, foul-smelling sputum. Mucor is a fungal infection that is paicularly severe in the diabetic or the immunocompromised patient. In the acidotic diabetic, the fungus produces a life-threatening, invasive rhinocerebral infection.

        "exp": "Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year. Outbreaks occur seasonally in winter and early spring. Infection does not result in lasting immunity, and reinfection can occur. Coronavirus causes the common cold (nasal obstruction and discharge, sneezing, no fever or mild fever, occasional sore throat, and/or cough) and acute pharyngitis (sore throat, with or without cervical adenopathy, ulceration, and conjunctivitis). Influenza type A is the leading cause of influenza. Influenza is a systemic illness characterized by the sudden onset of fever, headache, myalgias, malaise, and prostration, followed by cough, nasal obstruction, and sore throat. The lower respiratory tract may also be involved. Parainfluenza viruses are the leading cause of croup, or acute laryngotracheobronchitis, in children. This infection involves both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Inflammation in the subglottic area leads to hoarseness, dyspnea, a barking cough, and inspiratory stridor. Ref: Levinson W.

There are \"6\" types of capsule designated a, b, c, d, e, and f Of these, type 'b' is commonly associated with invasive H. influenzae disease in children. The polysaccharide capsule of type '13' strain is composed of polyribosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP) capsule and is the proven determinance of virulance. The PRP capsule exes its effect in the following ways: - i) It is antiphagocytic ii) It does not induce the alternative complement pathwary. This allows the bacterium to invade the blood or CSF without attracting phagocytes or provoking an inflammatory response and complement mediated bacteriolysis. For this reason anticapsular antibody which promotes both phagocytosis and lysis of bacteria is the main factor in immune defence against H. influenzae infection. Capsulated strains cause invasive diseases, amongst which meningitis is most common. Host defences against H. influenzae. H. influenzae is susceptible to lysis by antibody and complement. Therefore, host defenses against H. influenzae include: - i) Activation of the alternative and classical complement pathway. ii) Antibodies to PRP capsule. Antibodies to the Hib capsule play the primary role in conferring immunity against H. infleunzae. These bactericidal antibody directed against PRP capsule of H. influenzae type b is entirely responsible for host resistance. Newborns and infants are protected from infection upto the age of 6 months due to transplacental transfer of antibodies against the 'b' capsule from mother to fetus. When these transplacental antibodies to the capsule wane, infants are at higher risk for developing invasive H. influenzae disease.",

However, there is now a trend to replace the CFT with the simple flocculation tests. Although CFT is considered to be a relatively simple test, it is a very exacting procedure because 5 variables are involved. In essence the test consists of two antigen-antibody reactions, one of which is the indicator system. The first reaction, between a known virus antigen and a specific antibody takes place in the presence of a predetermined amount of complement. The complement is removed or \"fixed\" by the antigen-antibody complex. The second antigen-antibody reaction consists of reacting sheep RBC with haemolysin. When this indicator system is added to the reactants, the sensitized RBCs will only lyse in the presence of free complement. The antigens used for CFT tend to be group antigens rather than type-specific antigens. In order for the CFT to be set up correctly, the optimal concentration of haemolytic serum, complement, and antigen should be determined by titration. The Wassermann test is no longer in use.",

        "exp": "Bacillus stearothermophilus Sterilization is generally defined as the process of completely destroying ble microorganisms including structures such as spores. Standandard practice in sterilization process is to include sterility indicator along with the aicles to be sterilized. The use of sterility indicators allows a direct and sensitive approach to test the effectiveness of the sterilization process. Sterility indicators can be biological or chemical. Biological indicators A biological indicator is broadly defined as a characteristic preparation of specific microorganism that provides a defined and stable ressitance to specific sterilization procedures. The biological indicators selected should provide a greater challenge to the sterilization process than the bioburden in or on the product. Microorganisms widely recognized as biological indicators are spore forming bacterias because these organisms are significantly more resistant than the normal. - With the exception of ionizing radiation process, these microorganisms are significantly more resistant than the normal micro flora. A biological indicator can be used to assist in the performance qualification of the sterilization equipment and in the development and establishment of a validated sterilization process for a paicular process. \"Biological indicator used in plasma sterilization is Bacillus stearothermophilus\". Plasma sterilization Plasma is described as the fouh state of matter (It is neither liquid, gas or solid). it is defined as reactive cloud of ionized atoms, electrons and neutral atomic paicles. In order to generate the plasma for sterilization, matter (for example H202) a gaseous state is exposed to strong electrical or magnetic. field. This is performed in a vaccum so that high temperature are not required. In practice, a hydrogen peroxide solution is dispersed in a vaccum chamber creating a plasma cloud. This result in the generation (ionisation) of a cloud of charged paicles and free radicals that interact with vital cell component. The free radicals generated during this process interacts with vital cell component (mainly nucleic acids and destroy them). Sterilization occurs as a result of the dual phase process of the oxidative propeies of the vapour and plasma. Gas plasma is capable of penetrating medical packaging, is safe to use and the sterilization cycles are easy to control and monitor. The temperature attained in these process is not very high so there is no risk of damage of the instruments as in Heat methods. Biological indicators for various sterilization methods B. stearothernzophilus spores are used to monitor -Steam sterilization - Plasma sterilization (hydrogen peroxide) - Liquid peracetic acid sterilizers",

During B cell development, diversity of the antigen binding variable region of Ig is generated by an ordered set of Ig gene rearrangement.. An antibody is composed of two identical light and two identical heavy chains, and the genes specifying them are found in the 'V' ( variable ) region and the 'C' ( constant ) region.. As the name suggests, genetic rearrangement occurs in variable region, constant region remains constant, i. e. there is no rearrangement at constant region. In the heavy chain, 'V' region there are three segments; 'V', 'D' and. For heavy chain, there is first a rearrangement of D segment to J segment, followed by a second rearrangement between a V gene segment and the newly formed D-J sequence; the C segment is aligned to the V-D-J complex to yield a functional Ig heavy chain gene (V-D-J-C).. Similar rearrangements occur for light chain V- region except there are only two segments involved; 'V' and %Y.. Light chain rearrangement occurs during later stages.

This organism invades the brush border of the intestine, causing blebs to form on the luminal surface of the cells, the most superficial of all the intracellular locations within this group. Balantidium coli, which does not have a sexual phase in its life cycle, attaches to the colonic mucosa of swine.

G. lambia may cause irritation and low-grade inflammation of the duodenal or jejunal mucosa, with consequent acute or chronic diarrhea associated with crypt hyperophy, villous atrophy or flattening, and epithelial cell damage. Stools may be watery, semisolid, greasy, bulky, and foul smelling at various times during the course of the infection. Strongyloides damages intestinal mucosa and causes malabsorption syndrome. Intestinal capillariasis is caused by ingestion of raw fish infected with Capillaria philippinensis. Subsequent autoinfection can lead to a severe wasting syndrome. If untreated, progressive auto infection can lead to protein-losing enteropathy, severe malabsorption, and ultimately death from cachexia, cardiac failure, or superinfection. Ref: Weller P.

        "exp": "Ans. B: Takes 5 days to appear The secondary response is prompt, powerful and prolonged, with a shoer or negligible lag phase and much higher level of antibodies that lasts for long period (Antibody is predominantly IgG) Immune response The first time a harmful antigen is encountered in the body it triggers the primary immune response. Antibody formed in primary immune response is predominantly IgM For many days after an antigen has entered the body there are no antibodies produced in the bloodstream to fight the antigen. This lag period can last for as little as 10 days or as long as 4 weeks. During the lag phase, B-lymphocytes are preparing to become active so they can sta to divide and begin to produce antibodies. Soon antibodies specific for the harmful antigen begin to appear in the bloodstream and increase until they level off and then slowly decrease until the antibodies are barley detectable. Slowly as the primary immune response progresses, the quality of antibodies improves. The antibodies that are more effective in killing the invading antigens become predominant. The secondary immune response occurs after an antigen that has already been encountered reappears. For example, if someone had recovered from the flu and later encounters the same strain of that virus antibodies that were made specifically for that antigen will rise dramatically with almost no lag period. Also after the antigen has been killed the antibodies fall even slower than they did in the primary immune response. The most dominant antibodies are what signals the other immune cells to attack, thus the immune system is said to memory response.",

Sporotrichosis Sporotrichosis is caused by the thermally dimorphic fungus sporothrix schenckii. Because S. schencki is naturally found in soil, hay, sphagnum moss, and plants, it usually affects farmers, gardeners, and agricultural workers. This fungal disease usually affects the skin although rare forms can affect the lungs, joints, bones, and CNS. Fungus enters through small cuts and abrasions in the skin to cause the infection. Because roses can spread the disease, it is one of a few diseases referred to as rose-thorn or rose gardener's disease. Forms and symptoms of sporotrichosis I) Cutaneous (skin) sporotrichosis - This is the most common form of this disease. Symptoms of this form includes nodular lesions or bumps in the skin, at the point of entry and also along lymph nodes and vessels. - The lesion stas off as small and painless, nodule and ranges in colour from pink to purple. - Left untreated, the lesion becomes larger and look similar to a boil and more lesions will apear, until a chronic ulcer develops. Usually cutaneous sporotrichosis lesions occur in the finger, hand and arm. 2) Pulmonary sporotrichosis - This rare form of the disease occur when S. schenckii spores are inhaled. - Symptoms include productive cough, nodules, cavitations and fibrosis of lungs; and hilar lymph node enlargement. - Patients with this form of sporotrichosis are susceptible to developing tuberculosis and pneumonia. 3) Disseminated sporotrichosis - When the infection spreads from the primary site to secondary sites in the body, the disease develops into a rare and critical form called disseminated sporotrichosis. - The infection can spread to joints and bones (called osteoaicular sporotrichosis) as well as the CNS and brain (sporotrichosis meningitis). About other options Cladosporium Cladosporium genus of fungi includes some of the most common indoor and outdoor molds. Many species of cladosporium are commonly found on living and dead plant material. Some species are plant pathogens, others parasitize other fungi. Cladosporium species are rarely pathogenic to humans, but have been repoed to cause infection of the skin and toenails, as well as sinusitis and pulmonary infections.",

The human disease was recognized along the mediterranean region from very early times and has been known under various names such as Mediterranean fever, Malta fever and undulant fever. A British army doctor, David Brue isolated a small microorganism from the spleen of fatal cases in Malta and transmitted the disease to monkeys experimentally. This was named Brucella melitensis (Bruella after Bruce, melitetzis after Melita the roman name for malta) More on Brucellosis Brucella is a Grain negative cocobacilli that can infect wide range of mammals from rodents to killer whales. They are of paicular zoonotic and economic impoance as a cause of highly transmissible disease in cattle, sheep, goats and pigs. Humans acquire Brucella from direct contact with infected animal ineat or aboed placentas or ingestion of infected milk products. The patients of Brucellosis will most likely be a worker in the meat packing industry (abettoir worker), a veterinarian, a farmer or a traveller who consumes dairy products. All the names of Brucella species are based on the animals they infect: Brucella melitensis (Goats) Brucella abous (causes aboions in cows) Brucella suis Pigs Brucella Canis Dogs Pathogenesis Brucella penetrates the skin, conj unctiva, lungs or G. I. tract. However neither Buboes, nor primary skin ulcer appear. Penetration is followed by lymphatic spread, facultative intracellular growth in macrophages and blood and organ invasion. The intra cellular parasites localize in reticuloendothelial system forming abscesses or granuloinatous lesion. Clinical feature The symptoms are systemic with fever, chills, sweats, loss of appetite, backache, headache and sometimes lymphadenopathy. The fever usually peaks in the evening and slowly returns to normal by morning. The slow rise in temperature during the day, declining at night has led to its other name undulant fever. These symptoms can last from months to years, but founately the disease is rarely fatal. Diagnosis Diagnosis of active disease is best made by culture of the organism from blood, bone marrow, liver or lymph nodes. Castaneda method of blood culture is commonly used. In the absence of blood culture, the diagnosis of Brucellosis usually depends upon the serological tests, the results of which tend to vary with the stage of the infection.",

B: Liver The majority of hydatid cysts occur in the liver Echinococcosis/Hydatid disease/Echinococcal disease There are three different forms of echinococcosis found in humans, each of which is caused by the larval stages of different species of the tapeworm of genus Echinococcus. The first of the three and also the most common form found in humans is cystic echinococcosis (also known as unilocular echinococcosis), which is caused by Echinococcus granulosus. The second is alveolar echinococcosis (also known as alveolar colloid of the liver, alveolar hydatid disease, alveolococcosis, multilocular echinococcosis, \"small fox tapeworm\"), which is caused by Echinococcus multilocularis and The third is polycystic echinococcosis (also known as human polycystic hydatid disease, neotropical echinococcosis), which is caused by Echinococcus vogeli and very rarely, Echinococcus oligahus. Alveolar and polycystic echinococcosis are rarely diagnosed in humans and are not as widespread as cystic echinococcosis Definitive Hosts E. granulosus: dogs and other canidae E. multilocularis: foxes, dogs, other canidae and cats E. vogeli: bush dogs and dogs E. oligahus: wild felids Intermediate Hosts E. granulosus: sheep (optimum intermediate host), goats, swine and other wild herbivores (Man is an accidental host and leads to dead end of life cycle) E. multilocularis: small rodents E. vogeli: rodents E. oligahus: small rodents Liver cyst Majority of hydatid cyst occur in the liver, causing symptoms that may include chronic abdominal discomfo, occasionally with a palpable or visible abdominal mass.

Initially, when this and coming next questions were framed (AI 95), the best answer was shigella dysentriae because at that time new shigella enterotoxins were not discovered.. But, with discovery of new enterotoxins it is clear that all four shigella can produce enterotoxin (exotoxin) - Read text below. SHIGELLA TOXINS. Shigella dysenteriae type I forms a toxin (shiga toxin).. It is the earliest example of an exotoxin produced by a Gram negative bacilli.. Shigella has three type of toxic activity 1) Neurotoxicity Primary sites of action are blood vessels of the CNS, not the nervous tissue. Neurological effects are secondary. 2) Enterotoxicity. There are two enterotoxins - Sh. ET -1 ---> Is restricted almost exclusively S. flexneri 2a - encoded by chromosome - Sh. Et - 2 --> More widely distributed to all shigella - encoded by plasmid.. Both these enterotoxins alter electrolyte transpo by gut segment in vitro and cause net fluid secretion in ligated ileal loops in vivo. 3) Cytotoxicity. It is due to production of Shiga toxin (verocytotoxin) which is similar to VT1 expressed by EHEC.. It is produced by shigella dysentriae type 1.. Genes encoding shiga toxin are located on chromosome, while the VT1 of EHEC is phage-encoded.. Toxin constits of two subunits - b Subunits, helps is binding and A subunit which has the active poion of toxin. Subunit 'A' is divided into A1 and A2 fragment. A l fragments inhibits protein synthesis by inactivating 60s ribosome. Remember. The major factor in the pathogenicity of shigella is its ability to penetrate and multiply in colonic mucosa.. Invasive propey is related to the presence of large plasmids coding for the outer membrane protein responsible for cell penetration - Virulence marker antigen. Detection of VMA by ELISA serves as a virulence test for shigella, as for enteroinvasive E. col i.. Invasive propey of the bacillis can be demonstrated by its ability to penetrate cultured He. La or Hep - 2 cells.. Majority of lesions occur in distal colon.. Enterotoxins are produced by all four type of shigellae.",

Although some follicular dendritic cells are infected with HIV, most viral paicles are found on the surface of their dendritic processes. Follicular dendritic cells have receptors to the Fc poion of immunoglobulins that serve to trap HIV virions coated with anti-HIV antibodies. These coated HIV paicles retain the ability to infect CD4+ T cells as they traverse the dendritic cells. B lymphocytes have a surface marker (CD21 protein-a complement receptor) to which an Epstein-Barr envelope glycoprotein can bind. The virus associates with the host cell genome, producing a latent infection. These B cells undergo polyclonal activation and proliferation. Ganglion cells, paicularly the satellite cells around the ganglion cells in the dorsal root ganglia, can be infected by varicella-zoster. Herpes type I and II infect neurons that innervate skin and mucous membranes. Oligodendrocytes are directly infected by two viruses, JC virus (a polyomavirus) and measles virus.

This recognition is coupled with the ability to initiate appropriate actions (e. g., antibody production) against these microorganisms or foreign substances. Acquired humoral immunity may be subdivided into: - that acquired actively - that acquired passively Cellular immunity: * For immunity mediated by cytoxic T cells, an antigen is always a protein or a poion of a protein. * This is because only peptides (protein fragments) interact with MHC (major histocompatibility complex) and cell mediated immunity requires interaction with these MHC-associated peptides.",

The time required for sterilization depends upon the volume of medium in the vessel- For small volumes of liquids (100 ml or less), the time required for autoclaving is 15-20min. For large quantities (2-4 liter) 30-40 min is required. 2) Membrane filtration - Constituents like serum, trypsin, growth factors, proteins, amino acids, vitamins, hormones, carbohydrates and plant extracts are thermolabile and may decompose during autoclaving. - These must be sterilized by filtration. The porosity of the filter membrane should be no longer than 0. 2 microns (U m). - Empty glassware that is to hold media must be sterilized in an autoclave before filter sterilization. These two (autoclaving and membrane filtration) are the most commonly used methods for sterilization of culture media. But when these are not available other methods can be used; e. g.- - For media containing sugar or gelatin, an exposure of 100\u00b0C for 20 minutes on three successive days may be used.

        "exp": "Enterotoxigenic E. coli It is the most impoant cause of traveler's diarrhea in visitors to developing countries. Transmission is by consumption of food and water contaminated by infected human or convalescent carriers. Uncooked foods such as salads or marinated meats and vegetables are associated with the greatest risk. ETEC produce diarrhea in infants, but not commonly. There is no invasion or inflammation. The bacteria remain on the surface, where the adenylate cyclase-stimulating action of the toxins creates the flow of water and electrolytes from the enterocyte into the intestinal lumen. The mucosa becomes hyperemic but is not injured in the process. Also know: ETEC diarrhea is caused by strains of E coli that produce LT and/or ST enterotoxins in the proximal small intestine. Adherence to surface microvilli mediated by the colonizing factor (CF) pili is essential for the efficient delivery of toxin to the target enterocytes. The genes encoding the ST, LT, and the CF pili are borne in plasmids. Ref: Ray C. G., Ryan K. J. (2010). Chapter 33. Enterobacteriaceae. In C. G. Ray, K. J.

B: Immunofluorescence test Diagnosis of cryptosporidium is made by demonstration of oocyst in feces Methods of detection and confirmation of cryptosporodium Wet mount-In bright-field microscopy using differential interference contrast (DIC), oocysts appear as small round structures (4 to 6 im) similar to yeasts. They do not autofluoresce. Modified acid-fast stain-Oocysts (4 to 6 im) often have distinct oocyst walls and stain from light pink to bright red. In paicular, infections that are resolving can have colorless oocyst \"ghosts. \" Mature oocysts may have discernible sporozoites (up to 4). Indirect fluorescent antibody assay-This technique offers the highest combination of sensitivity and specificity and is considered the gold standard. However, it does not provide a stained slide that can be archived. It requires special equipment (fluorescence microscope) and commercially available test kits. Methods for detection (but not confirmation) of Cryptosporidium Oocysts may be detected by the following methods, but should be confirmed by the diagnostic techniques listed above. Safranin stain-Oocysts of Cryptosporidium often (but not always) stain a bright reddish-orange color. This method, advocated for Cyclospora, is not widely used for Cryptosporidium because the Cryptosporidium oocysts may not always properly stain. - Trichrome stain-Oocysts may be detected, but should not be confirmed, by this method. This staining method is inadequate for definitive diagnosis because all oocysts will appear unstained. Oocysts appear as small round structures measuring 4 to 6 im. Other methods for detecting Cryptosporidium in stool. - Enzyme immunoassay (EIA)-The EIA does not rely on microscopy skills, is highly sensitive and specific, and is useful for screening large numbers of specimens. - Rapid immunochromatographic caridge assays-The rapid caridge assays may be used with preserved specimens and are quick and easy to perform",

In this method, the smears are stained with auramine-rhodamine or auramine-phenol fluorescent dyes and are examined by fluorescent microscope under ultraviolet illumination. This AFB appear as bright fluorescing rods against a dark background. The bacilli, because of their contrast, are visualized even under a high power objective in contrast to oil immersion objective in ZN stain, thus enabling rapid screening of the larger areas of the smear. These fluorescent-stained slides can be screened faster, because the AFB stands against the nonfluorescent background. This is the major advantage of this staining method, hence is adopted in the laboratories where many smears are to be examined for AFB.

        "question": "Which of the following is an enrichment media: September 2009",
        "exp": "Ans. D: All of the above Culture media may be classified into several categories depending on their composition or use. A chemically-defined (synthetic) medium is one in which the exact chemical composition is known. A complex (undefined) medium is one in which the exact chemical constitution of the medium is not known. Defined media are usually composed of pure biochemicals off the shelf; complex media usually contain complex materials of biological origin such as blood or milk or yeast extract or beef extract, the exact chemical composition of which is obviously undetermined. A defined medium is a minimal medium if it provides. only the exact nutrients (including any growth factors) needed by the organism for growth. A selective medium is one which has a component(s) added to it which will inhibit or prevent the growth of ceain types or species of bacteria and/or promote the growth of desired species. A culture medium may also be a differential medium if allows to distinguish between different types of bacteria based on some observable trait in their pattern of growth on the medium. Thus a selective, differential medium for the isolation of Staphylococcus aureus, contains a very high concentration of salt (which the staph will tolerate) that inhibits most other bacteria, mannitol as a source of fermentable sugar, and a pH indicator dye. From clinical specimens, only staph will grow. S. aureus is differentiated from S. epidermidis (a nonpathogenic component of the normal flora) on the basis of its ability to ferment mannitol. Mannitol-fermenting colonies (S. aureus) produce acid which reacts with the indicator dye forming a colored halo around the colonies; mannitol non-fermenters (S. epidermidis) use other non-fermentative substrates in the medium for growth and do not form a halo around their colonies. Mac. Conkey's medium shows up lactose fermenters as pink colonies An enrichment medium contains some component that permits the growth of specific types or species of bacteria, usually because they alone can utilize the component from their environment.

This adhesion is usually mediated by fimbriae that bind to specific receptors in the intestinal cell membrane. These adhesions are called colonization factor antigens (CFAs).

It grows as mycelia forms, producing spores at 25degC on sabroud's agar and at 37degC it grows as a yeast form. This dimorphism plays a pa in human infection i. e. in their natural habitat (the soil) they grow us mycelia and release spores into the air. These spores are inhaled by humans and at the human temperature of 37degC they grow as yeast cells (Hyphae). Histoplasmosis resembles tuberculosis in ceain ways Like T. B. histoplasma infection is acquired by inhalation. Histoplasmosis is acquired by inhalation of dust paicles contaminated with bird or bat dropings that contain small spores (microconidia), the infectious form of the fungus. The clinical presentation and morphological lesions of histoplasmosis also strikingly resemble those of tuberculosis I. A self limited and often latent primary pulnionan' involvement which may result in coin lesions on chest radiography. 2. Chronic, progressive secondary lung disease which is localized to the lung apices and cause cough, fever and night sweats. 3. Localized lesions in extrapulmonary sites including mediastinum, adrenals, liver or meninges. 4. Widely disseminated involvement paicularly in immunosuppressed individual. An impoant distinguishing point in histoplasma infection is that it is never transmitted from 'non to ratan. Diagnosis of Histoplasma infection Fungal culture remains the gold standard diagnostic test for histoplasmosis. However, culture results may not be known for upto I months.

Mentation is intact in these patients, and they do not exhibit sensory changes except for those, such as the double vision, related to failure of extra- and intraocular muscles. Note: You are probably aware that botulism can follow ingestion of home canned vegetables, fish, fruits, and condiments. You may not be aware that other vehicles that have been the source of outbreaks include commercially prepared canned foods, poultry, and dairy products; and even restaurant-prepared non-canned foods including seafood, foil-wrapped baked potatoes, chopped garlic in oil, and patty melt sandwiches. For this reason, the absence of a classic history of ingestion of home canned food should not be used to exclude the diagnosis of botulism. Treatment is suppoive. Most patients recover from foodborne botulism without sequelae. You should also be aware that C. botulinum can cause true infection coupled with toxin production in wounds and in infants. Clostridium perfringens is one of the causes of gas gangrene. Clostridium ramosum has been associated with intra-abdominal infections after bowel perforation.

Cyclosporiasis has been linked to waterborne and foodborne infections. Altered mucosal architecture with shoening of intestinal villi due to diffuse edema and infiltration of inflammatory cells leads to diarrhea, anorexia, fatigue, and weight loss. The duration of symptoms among untreated, non immune persons is often prolonged but ultimately self-limited, with remitting-relapsing symptoms lasting up to several weeks or months. The incubation period for Cyclospora infections is about 1 week, similar to infections with Cryptosporidium. The diagnosis can be made by detection of spherical 8- to 10-m oocysts in the stool, although routine stool ova and parasite (O+P) examinations are not sufficient. Specific fecal examinations must be requested to detect the oocysts, which are variably acid-fast and are fluorescent when viewed with ultraviolet light microscopy. All the parasites mentioned in the question cause chronic diarrhea (mostly in immunocompromised patients). All of them reveal oocyst on stool examination. In Giardiasis, parasite is also seen along with oocyst stool examination. Oocyst of all the organisms except giardia are acid fast. The diagnosis rests on the size of the oocyst. Ref: Brooks G.

        "exp": "Nucleic acid amplification Chlamydial infections are frequently asymptomatic. - Confirmation of chlamydial infection usually depends on taking an appropriate clinical sample. from the patient, followed by the direct detection of the organism using a suitable laboratory-based diagnostic test. The demonstration of chlamydial antibodies (serology) in an individual is rarely diagnostic. For many years, the optimum method of confirming the presence of chlamydial infection was the growth of the infecting organism in cell culture and the demonstration of characteristic chlamydial inclusions. - However, this method necessitated the availability of good transpo and cold-storage facilities in order to maintain the bility of the organism prior to inoculation. - Moreover growth and isolation of the organisms in cell culture was relatively tedious and difficult to quality control. - Chlamydial cell culture, facilities were available to relatively few clinical centres. - It is now widely recognized that cell culture techniques were, at best, only 60 to 80% sensitive. A key advance in the laboratory diagnosis of chlamydial infections has been the development of non-bility dependent tests which place less demand on specimen transpo. The first of these tests were the chlamydial antigen detection tests, which relied, either on The direct detection of chlamydial elementary bodies in clinical material using fluorochrome-labelled, chlamydial specific, monoclonal antibodies. Direct immunofluorescence - Capture and detection of chlamydial antigen in an extract of clinical material using enzyme immunoassay based procedures. These methods are still appropriate in some settings and they remain in widespread use. However, they are gradually being superseded by newer, methods based on the detection of chlamydial nucleic acid, either by -- Direct hybridization or by - Nucleic acid amplification The latter use a variety of amplification reactions including the:? - Polymerase chain reaction - Ligase chain reaction - Strand displacement amplification or transcription mediated amplification. Nucleic acid-based methods generally offer superior sensitivity and specificity to the antigen detection tests, but at greater cost and a greater requirement for trained staff. A second major advance has been the recognition that cervical or urethral specimens requiring invasive genital sampling are by no means essential for the laboratory diagnosis of chlamydial infection. Non invasive and or self collected samples which may be adequate include male and, female urine, various vulval-introital samples or vaginal fluid expressed from a tampon. More on chlamydial diagnosis Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular parasite. It cannot survive outside its host i. e. it cannot grow on cell free media. - Up until the early 1980s, the main method of confirming a diagnosis of chlamydial infection, was the inoculation of clinical material into animals, embryonated hens eggs or (usually) tissue culture cells and the demonstration of characteristic chlamydial inclusions. Generally speaking inclusions were demonstrated in cell culture? - Either by staining with iodine - By staining with Giemsa stain - Fluorochrome-labelled poly - or mono-clonal antibody - Enzyme immunohistochemistry The usual tissue culture cells were - - He. La 229, - L434 mouse fibroblasts or C'. trachomatis and C. psittaci; - Mc. Coy cells - Buffalo Green Monkey kidney cells (C. psittaci and - HL or Hep2 cells C. pneumoniae) Growth of the organisms was facilitated by the use of? - Antimetabolites directed against the host cell (cyclohexitnide; emetine or ntitomycin C) or, - By the use of charged anionic polymers such as Poly - L - lysine or DEAR dextran for C trachomatis TRIO biovar.

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a systemic disease that can present with cutaneous lesions with or without internal involvement. Four subtypes have been described: - Classic KS, affecting middle aged men of Mediterranean descent; - African endemic KS; KS in iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients; and - AIDS-related KS. Classic KS tends to be indolent, presenting with erythematous or violaceous patches on the lower extremities. African endemic KS and AIDS-related KS tend to be more aggressive. The AIDS-related KS lesions often rapidly progress to plaques and nodules affecting the upper trunk, face, and oral mucosa. The diagnosis can be made with a tissue biopsy and, if clinically indicated, internal imaging should be done.",

Borrelia burgdorferi is transmitted to humans the bite of ixodes tick vector. Borrelia burgdorferi is inoculated in the skin, where local replication takes place locally and outward migration in the dermis occurs. Days to week after the tick bite, hematogenous dissemination to secondary sites (like joints, heart eye, nervous system) takes place. If untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of anti-Borrelia burgodorferi antibodies by the immune system. The following mechanisms have been described - i) Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. - This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish the infect on. ii) Once inside the body, Borrelia burgdorferi becomes a \"stealth invader\" i. e., it changes shape. In the tick and mice which host the bacterium through most of its life cycle, the bacterium has a thick cell wall and spiral shape. If it maintains its thick cell wall and its spiral shape, immune system can control infection. However, in the human body, it can shed its cell wall and can take a different shape. When under attack from immune system, it simply changes shape so it is not recognized. iii) Borrelia burgdorferi produces antigenic variation in a \"cell surface lipoprotein VIsE\", during the course of infection The VIsE system presents a challenge to immune system because after an immune response is generated to one version of VIsE protein, a different version is quickly produced. By using this type of antigenic variation, B. burgdorferi can escape the adaptive immune system. Lyme meningitis Meningitis (meningeal involvement) is the most common neurological event that occurs in the setting of early lyme dissemination. - In this clinical setting CSF is always abnormal and shows: I) Pleocytosis with predominantly lymphocytosise (not polymorphonuclear leukocytosis). 2) Increased protein 3) Glucose content is usually normal, but it falls below the serum concentration in 20% of patients.

All Staphylococci produce catalase, an enzyme responsible for conversion of toxic hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen which accumulates during bacterial metabolism or is released following phagocytosis. Kinases dissolve fibrin clots thus enabling the organism to invade and spread throughout the body. Staphylococcus aureus produces staphylokinase which is fibrinolytic.

Shiga toxin contains an enzymatic domain and 5 binding domains which bind to globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), a glycosphingolipid on the surface of cells and the complex is internalized. The internalized shiga toxin hydrolyse the ribosomes, preventing fuher protein synthesis. Shiga toxin is composed of two distinct peptide subunits: The first located on the larger A subnit is an N-glycosidase that hydrolyzes adenine from specific sites of ribosomal RNA of the mammalian 60s ribosomal subunit, irreversibly inhibiting protein synthesis. The second is a binding site on the B subunit that recognizes glycolipids of target cell membranes (glycolipid Gb 3). Ref: Toxins and Hemostasis: From Bench to Bedside By R.

Individuals at the highest risk for severe infection include neonates and patients in intensive care units. C. parapsilosis infections are especially associated with hyperalimentation solutions, prosthetic devices, and indwelling catheters, as well as the nosocomial spread of disease through the hands of health care workers. Factors involved in disease pathogenesis include the secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, adhesion to prosthetics, and biofilm formation. Impoant Points about Candida parapsilosis Candida species are presently the fouh leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infection. Candida albicans is the most frequent isolate from blood cultures followed by Candida parapsilosis C. parapsilosis does not form true hyphae and exists in either a yeast phase or a pseudohyphal form. C. parapsilosis is notorious for its capacity to grow in total parenteral nutrition and to form biofilms on catheters and other implanted devices, for nosocomial spread by hand carriage. C. parapsilosis is of special concern in critically ill neonates, causing more than one-quaer of all invasive fungal infections in low-bih-weight infants. Additionally, it is the predominant fungal organism isolated in many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), where it is often associated with neonatal moality C. parapsilosis is also a normal human commensal, and it is one of the fungi most frequently isolated from the subungal space of human hands C. parapsilosis fungemia can lead to seeding of tissues, resulting in deep-seated infections, and has a moality rate ranging from 4% to 45% Compared to C. albicans, C. parapsilosis more frequently caused fungemia among neonates, in patients with intravenous lines or vascular catheters, who had received prior antifungal agents, were on parenteral nutrition, or had undergone transplantation.",

In fact, infants born to Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs. Ag)-positive mothers are commonly infected, and approximately 90% become chronic carriers of the virus. Chronic carriers suffer from hepatocellular carcinoma at an incidence over 200 times higher than a noncarrier. The current recommendation for infants born of HBs. Ag-positive mothers is administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) in the delivery room, with the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine given at the same time or within 1 week. The second and third dose of the vaccine are then given at 1 and 6 months. With this protocol, 94% protection is achieved. The Epstein-Barr virus is the agent of heterophile-positive infectious mononucleosis. In children, primary EBV infection is often asymptomatic. The measles virus often causes a more severe disease in adults. Over the age of 20, the incidence of complications, including pneumonia, bacterial superinfection of the respiratory tract, bronchospasm and hepatitis, is much higher than in children.

Their cytoplasmic membranes also contain sterols that most likely provide added strength. All other bacteria have a cell wall Peptidoglycan prevents osmotic lysis. Under the cytoplasmic membrane, bacteria concentrate dissolved nutrients (solute) through active transpo.

Rashesare initially blanching in nature but within hours become non-blanching. In severe cases large purpuriclesions (purpura fulminons) develops. Meningitis Commonly present as fever, vomiting, headache, irritability, petechial or purpuric rash occurs in 2/3 of cases. Headache is seen in adults usually. In upto 40% of cases there are some features of septicemia too. Septicemia Can be isolated or as a accomplication of meningitis. The condition may cause death within hours. Purpura fulminans is a specific feature. Chronic meningococcemia Present as repeated episodes of petechial rash associated with fever joint pain, ahritis and splenomegaly. The main differential diagnosis is acute rheumatic fever. This condition has been associated with complement deficiently and with inadequate sulfonamide therapy. If left untreated chances of progression to meningococcal septicemia are high.

        "exp": "Trichinella spiralis is not a neuro parasite, it is seen in striated muscles. It causes trichinosis. Pigs are the most impoant reservoirs of human disease. Humans are infected by eating raw or undercooked meat containing larvae encysted in the muscle. The larvae excyst and mature into adults within the mucosa of the small intestine. Eggs hatch within the adult females, and larvae are released and distributed the bloodstream to many organs; however, they develop only in striated muscle cells. Within the muscle cells they can remain ble for several years but eventually calcify.

It is best known as the cause of infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever). It is also associated with paicular forms of cancer, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and conditions associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) such as hairy leukoplakia and central nervous system lymphomas. There is evidence that infection with the virus is associated with a higher risk of ceain autoimmune diseases, especially dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid ahritis, Sjogren's syndrome, and multiple sclerosis. Infection with EBV occurs by the oral transfer of saliva and genital secretions.",
