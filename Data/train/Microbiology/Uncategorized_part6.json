The spread of infection, especially by Mucor sp., into the cavernous sinus, can produce either CNS infection or cavernous sinus thrombosis, both of which are potentially fatal. The route from the face to the brain is not aerial. The superior sagittal sinus is located in the falx cerebri, and drains venous blood from the brain to other dural sinuses, from which it eventually drains into the jugular vein.

In mosquito phase Anopheles mosquito ingest the parasitised RBC along with blood meal, microgamates and macrogamate develops which undergo feilisation and forms ookinete. It penetrates the epithelial lining of the mosquito stomach walls and lies beneath its basement membrane. It becomes rounded into a sphere with an elastic membrane. This is oocyst. Oocyst undergoes sporogony and forms sporozoites which recharge the salivary gland of the mosquito. The mosquito is now infective. Infective stage of Plasmodium for mosquito is Gametocytes.

Diagnostic Medical Microbiology & Clinical Correlation > Chapter 48, http://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Community-acquired pneumonia Respiratory viruses are the single most impoant cause of community-acquired pneumonia in pediatric age group. Typical bacterial pathogens that cause CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae (both penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains), H influenzae (both ampicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains), and Moraxella catarrhalis (all strains penicillin-resistant). These 3 pathogens account for approximately 85% of CAP cases. S pneumoniae remains the most common agent responsible for CAP The most common combination of pathogens is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) with either respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or Mycoplasma pneumoniae Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are not typical causes of CAP in otherwise healthy hosts. S aureus may cause CAP in individuals with influenza (eg, human seasonal influenza and H1. N1 influenza). K pneumoniae CAP occurs primarily in individuals with chronic alcoholism. P aeruginosa is a cause of CAP in patients with bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis. Atypical community-acquired pneumonia pathogens: Atypical pneumonias can be divided into zoonotic and Nonzoonotic atypical pathogens. Zoonotic atypical CAP pathogens include Chlamydophilia (Chlamydia) psittaci (psittacosis), Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and Coxiella burnetii (Q fever). Nonzoonotic atypical CAP pathogens are caused by Legionella species, M pneumoniae, or Chlamydophilia (Chlamydia) pneumoniae. These 3 organisms account for approximately 15% of all CAP cases.

        "exp": "Follicular dendritic cells in the germinal centers of lymph nodes are impoant reservoirs of HIV. Although some follicular dendritic cells are infected with HIV, most viral paicles are found on the surface of their dendritic processes. Follicular dendritic cells have receptors to the Fc poion of immunoglobulins that serve to trap HIV virions coated with anti-HIV antibodies. These coated HIV paicles retain the ability to infect CD4+ T cells as they traverse the dendritic cells. B lymphocytes have a surface marker (CD21 protein-a complement receptor) to which an Epstein-Barr envelope glycoprotein can bind. The virus associates with the host cell genome, producing a latent infection. These B cells undergo polyclonal activation and proliferation. Ganglion cells, paicularly the satellite cells around the ganglion cells in the dorsal root ganglia, can be infected by varicella-zoster. Herpes type I and II infect neurons that innervate skin and mucous membranes. Oligodendrocytes are directly infected by two viruses, JC virus (a polyomavirus) and measles virus. JC virus causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and measles virus produces a latent syndrome called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 58.

        "exp": "The three major causes of neonatal meningitis are group B streptococci (Streptococcus agalactiae), Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. All can be found in the vaginal tract of normal women and may contaminate the infant during passage through the bih canal. They colonize the upper respiratory tract and can cause pneumonia, septicemia, and/or meningitis in the neonate. They are readily distinguished on morphological grounds; the streptococci are gram-positive cocci in chains, E. coli is a gram-negative rod, and L. monocytogenes is a gram-positive pleomorphic rod. There are other gram-positive rods that resemble Listeria (e. g., the diphtheroid bacilli found in the upper respiratory tract and on the skin), hence a motility test is done to confirm the identification. L. monocytogenes is motile at room temperature but not when grown at 37 degrees C. L. monocytogenes is also associated with drinking unpasteurized milk. Neisseria meningitidis is the most common cause of meningitis in school-age children and young adults. It is a fastidious, non-motile, gram-negative diplococcus that would be a very rare cause of meningeal disease in very young patients, such as this one. Ref: Ray C. G., Ryan K. J. (2010). Chapter 26.

While some bacteria may be isolated from a lesion or other clinical specimen in pure culture, more often the pathologic agent will need to be isolated from a mixture of many bacteria (including nonpathogenic normal flora). A selective medium contains an added chemical that will inhibit large numbers of unwanted bacteria (normal flora) and allow specific types to grow. For example, manuitol salt agar selects for Staphylococcus, Thayer-Main agar selects for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N meningitidis, and bile-esculin agar is selective for enterococci (enteric streptococci). Differential medium will include a system to distinguish specific species within a selected group. The mannitol in mannitol salt agar will distinguish between Staphylococcus epidermidis (mannitol negative-nonpathogenic) and S. aureus (mannitol positive- pathogenic). X and V factors are used to identify species of Haemophilus. Factor X is heme and factor V is nicotinamide (NAD) or other coenzymes. X and V are supplied to the culture system by being placed on paper strips on the agar surface. Blood agar (5% sheep RBC enriched) is an enriched medium, supplying nutrients for a wide variety of microorganisms.

Serological tests are: - 1) Non-specific tests (reagin antibody or standard tests):- Kahn test, VDRL, Rapid plasma reagin (RPR), automated VDRL-ELISA, Washermann test. These tests measure IgG & IgM against cardiolipin. 2) Group-specific test: - CFT 3) Species-specific tests: - Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) test, Treponema pallidum immobilization (TP1), Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA), ELISA. Specific treponemal tests (FTA-ABS, TPHA, TPI) are of little value as indicators of clinical cure, as they tend to remain positive inspite of Treatment. Nontreponemal tests (eg VDRL) will become nonreactive or will be reactive at lower titers after therapy, so can be used for monitoring patient's response to treatment These tests usually become negative 6-18 months after effective treatment of syphilis A four-fold or greater decrease in antibody titre indicates a response to therapy",

These granules stain reddish violet with methylene blue or toluidine blue. These granules are strongly basophilic. In the granules, there is stored phosphate in the form of linear chains of inorganic phosphate. These granules represent intracellular phosphate reserve when nucleic acid syntheis does not occur. The phosphate is incorporated into nucleic acid during the synthesis of the latter. When nucleic acid synthesis is prevented by starvation, the granules accumulate in the cytoplasm. So, volutin metachromatic granules are most frequent in cells grown under conditions of nutritional deficiency (starvation) and tend to disappear when the deficient nutrients are supplied.

C sinensis is the Chinese liver fluke. Infection with any of these three species is established by ingestion of raw or inadequately cooked freshwater fish harboring metacercariae. These organisms encyst in the duodenum, releasing larvae that travel through the ampulla of Vater and mature into adult worms in bile canaliculi. Mature flukes are flat and elongated, measuring 1-2 cm in length. The hermaphroditic worms reproduce by releasing small operculated eggs, which pass with bile into the intestines and are voided with stools. The life cycle is completed in the environment in specific freshwater snails (the first intermediate host) and encystment of metacercariae in freshwater fish. Moderate to heavy infection may be associated with vague right-upper-quadrant pain. In contrast, chronic or repeated infection is associated with manifestations such as cholangitis, cholangiohepatitis, and biliary obstruction. Ref: Mahmoud A. A. (2012). Chapter 219.

After several days, she begins to pass blood per rectum, and is hospitalized for dehydration. In the hospital, she is noted to have decreasing urine output with rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Total blood count reveals anemia and thrombocytopenia, and the peripheral smear is remarkable for fragmented red cells (schistocytes). Infection with which of the following bacterial genera is most likely responsible for this syndrome?",
        "exp": "This patient has developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a complication of the Shiga toxin or Shiga-like toxin: exotoxins released by Shigella species and the enterohemorrhagic E. coli. HUS in children usually develops after a gastrointestinal or flu-like illness, and is characterized by bleeding, oliguria, hematuria and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Presumably the Shiga toxin is toxic to the microvasculature, producing microthrombi that consume platelets and RBCs, and may fragment the red cell membrane. The incorrect choices are all bacteria which may produce an enterocolitis, but do not elicit HUS. A long-term consequence of Campylobacter infection is a reactive ahritis or full-blown Reiter's syndrome. Clostridial enterocolitis is produced by Clostridium difficile, a normal inhabitant of the gut that produces pseudomembranous colitis when other gut flora are suppressed by treatment with antibiotics. Typhoid fever (produced by Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi) produces a protracted illness that progresses over several weeks and includes rash and very high fevers, but not HUS. Ref: Ray C.

Irregularly distributed within the rod (often near the poles) are granules staining deeply with aniline dyes (metachromatic granules) that give the rod a beaded appearance. Diphtheria toxin is absorbed into the mucous membranes and causes destruction of epithelium and a superficial inflammatory response. If disulfide bonds are broken, the molecule can be split into two fragments. Fragment B (MW=38, 000), which has no independent activity, is functionally divided into a receptor domain and a translocation domain. Acidification of the translocation domain within a developing endosome leads to creation of a protein channel that facilitates movement of Fragment A into the host cell cytoplasm. Toxin fragment A inactivates EF-2 by catalyzing a reaction that yields free nicotinamide plus an inactive adenosine diphosphate-ribose-EF-2 complex (ADP-ribosylation). It is assumed that the abrupt arrest of protein synthesis is responsible for the necrotizing and neurotoxic effects of diphtheria toxin.

On physical examination, she is lethargic, with a firm and tender abdomen, and peritoneal signs are present. She is immediately referred for laparotomy for suspected diagnosis of intussusception vs. volvulus. At surgery, approximately 20 cm of small intestine is found to be markedly distended, and is resected. The section contains a tightly knotted ball of nematodes that are about 15 to 35 cm in length. The worms have tapered ends without hooks. Pa of the life cycle of this patient's parasite is a filarial stage in which larvae, hatched in the duodenum, penetrate the wall of the small intestine. The passage of migrating larvae most commonly produces symptomatic disease in which of the following organs?",
        "exp": "Ascaris infection is acquired by ingestion of the eggs, usually from contaminated soil. The ingested eggs hatch in the duodenum to produce larvae, which cross the small intestinal wall to enter the bloodstream. They then pass through the hea to lodge in the lungs. They leave the lung capillary bed to enter the airspaces. They then ascend the bronchial tree into the oropharynx, where they are again swallowed. This time, they return to the small intestine where they develop into mature worms that can live in the host for up to two years. A gravid female worm may produce up to 250, 000 eggs daily, which are shed in stool. The passage of the larvae through the lungs often produces cough and/or wheezing, and may, in severe cases, produce fever, dyspnea, fleeting patchy pulmonary infiltrates (Loeffler pneumonitis with prominent eosinophilia), and rarely hemoptysis. Passage through the hea is usually asymptomatic, as the larvae are small. A single adult worm, but not usually larval forms, can migrate into the biliary tree, leading to biliary colic, cholangitis, or gallstone formation; obstructive jaundice uncommonly occurs. The pancreas and stomach are not common sites for complications of ascariasis. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 56. Nematodes. In W. Levinson (Ed), Review of Medical Microbiology & Immunology, 12e.",

But the classical glomerulopathy associated with HIV infection is collapsing ehnnerulopathy. Collapsing glomerulopathy is actually an aggressive form of focal segmental glonzerulosclerosis. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is characterized by sclerosis of some but not all glomeruli (thus it is focal) and in the affected glomeruli only a poion of the capillary tuft is involved. In contrast, collapsing glomerulopathy is characterized by collapse and sclerosis of the entire glomerular tuft (in addition to the usual. focal segmental glomerular lesions). Characteristic feature is proliferation and hyperophy of glomerular visceral epithelial cells.

They grow rapidly on simple media as oval budding cells at 25deg to 37degC. In tissue, both yeasts and pseudohyphae are present. Candida albicans is differentiated by other candida: It forms true hyphae (mycelia) or germ tubes when grown in serum. It forms thick walled large spores called chlamydospores when grown in corn meal agar. It is dimorphic. Remember - Candida albicans can produce yeast, true hyphae and pseudohyphae.

There they multiply and form merozoites (Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale also form hypnozoites, a latent form). Merozoites leave the hepatocytes and infect red cells (erythrocytic phase).

Those in group II produce Opacity factor, do not have the same set of repeating sequences and do not cause rheumatic fever. The synthesis of M proteins is controlled by the so called virulence regulon that encodes M protein, Streptococcal C5a peptidase and opacity factor. The emm gene of S. pyogenes is the gene that encodes the M protein. The M protein, responsible for the bacterium's capacity to resist phagocytosis, is a major virulence factor in GAS. The 5' ends of emm genes are highly heterogeneous and encode for the serotype specificity used for the M-typing system Community-based outbreaks of paicular streptococcal diseases tend to be associated with ceain M types; therefore, M serotyping has been very valuable for epidemiologic studies. M1 serotypes are most commonly associated with invasive diseases and Toxic Streptococcal Syndrome. Acquired immunity to streptococcal infection is based on the development of opsonic antibodies directed against the antiphagocytic epitopes of M protein. Although such antibodies protect from infection against a homologous M protein type, they unfounately confer no immunity against other M types. This observation is one of the factors that represent a major theoretical obstacle to the S pyogenes vaccine design because more than 80 M serotypes have been described to date.

H influenzae can be isolated on chocolate agar enriched with factor X and V. The blood used in chocolate agar is heated to inactivate nonspecific inhibitors of H. influenzae growth. Definitive identification is made by Quellung reaction.

Str. mutans is impoant in causation of dental caries. The transient viridans streptococcal bacteremia induced by eating, tooth-brushing, flossing and other source of minor trauma, together with adherence to biological surfaces, is thought to account for the predilection of these organisms to cause endocarditis. Viridans streptococci are also isolated, often as a pa of a mixed flora, from sites of sinusitis, brain abscess and liver abscess.

Tetracycline (500 mg four times daily for 10 days) is an effective therapeutic agent. Ref: Weller P. F. (2012). Chapter 215. Protozoal Intestinal Infections and Trichomoniasis. In D. L. Longo, A. S.

The toughest pa was remembering that parainfluenza virus (along with measles virus, mumps virus, and respiratory syncytial virus) belongs to the paramyxovirus family. These viruses all have negative-strand RNA and an enveloped helical nucleocapsid. The papovaviruses are DNA viruses with a naked icosahedral nucleocapsid. This family includes the human papilloma viruses (which cause was and are associated with penile, laryngeal, and especially, cervical cancer), the BK virus that can affect immunosuppressed patients, the JC virus associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and the simian SV40 virus. The parvoviruses are small, single-stranded DNA viruses. Only one serotype (B19) causes diseases in humans. It causes erythema infectiosum in children (characteristic \"slapped cheek\" rash), aplastic crises in patients with hemolytic diseases, and hydrops fetalis or stillbih in anemic fetuses. The picornaviruses are positive single-stranded RNA viruses with a naked icosahedral nucleocapsid.

        "exp": "H. influenzae is a small (1. 0 x 0. 3 micro m), Gram-negative, non-motile, non-sporing bacillus, exhibiting considerable pleomorphism. In sputum, it usually occurs as clusters of coccobacillary forms, while in CSF from meningitis cases, long, bacillary and filamentous forms predominate. Cells from young cultures (18- 24 hours) are usually coccobacillary, while older cultures are distinctly pleomorphic. Strains isolated from acute infections are often capsulated. The bacillus has fastidious growth requirements. The accessory growth factors, named X and V, present in blood are essential for growth. It is aerobic but grows anaerobically also. The optimum temperature is 3 7\u00b0C. It does not grow below 20\u00b0C. Some strains require 10% CO2, especially for primary isolation from the clinical specimen. It grows on blood agar if a source of the V factor is also provided. When S. aureus is streaked across a plate of blood agar on which a specimen containing H. infiuenzae has been inoculated, after overnight incubation, the colonies of H. influenzae will be large and well developed alongside the streak of staphylococcus, and smaller farther away. This phenomenon is called satellitism and demonstrates the dependence of H. influenzae on the V factor, which is available in high concentrations near staphylococcal growth and in smaller quantities away from it. This is a routine test in clinical bacteriology for the identification of H. influenzae. Reference: Ananthanarayan Panekar microbiology 8th ed page no 333, 334",

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by Ig E, but T and B cells play impoant roles in the development of these antibodies.. Type I reaction requires prior sensitization to a specific antigen (allergen).. Most exposures occur either by inhalation (respiratory route) or ingestion (GIT) of antigen.. Type one hypersensitivity has two phases:? 1) Initial response. After first antigen exposure, this antigen is presented to CD-4 helper T cells (TH2 type) by antigen presenting cells. These primed TH, cells release IL-4 that acts on B-cells to form Ig E specific for that paicular antigen.. The antigen specific Ig E antibodies then bind to the surface receptors of mast cells and basophils. The process from first antigen exposure to the coating of mast cells by Ig E acts as sensitization (prior sensitization) and first exposure is also called priming or sensitizing exposure (dose). Subsequent exposure (shocking dose) to same antigen then result in activation of mast cells and basophils with release of mediator from these cells that leads to? - Smooth muscle spasm - Increase mucus secretion from the epithelial cells. - Vasodilatation - Increased vascular permeability Recuritment of inflammatory cells Note - Most of the clinical effects are due to smooth muscle spasm.",

Transmission occurs through direct faecal-oral contamination or through ingestion of contaminated water and food. The disease is characterized in its most severe form by a sudden onset of acute watery diarrhoea that can lead to death by severe dehydration and kidney failure. The extremely sho incubation period - two hours to five days - enhances the potentially explosive pattern of outbreaks, as the number of cases can rise very quickly. About 75% of people infected with cholera do not develop any symptoms. However, the pathogens stay in their faeces for 7 to 14 days and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other individuals.

Differential RNA processing Synthesis of an immunoglobulin in membrane bound or secretory form is determined by differential RNA processing. \"B cells express a form of IgM, which is located on the cell surface. Cell surface IgM has the same specificity as the secreted IgM antibody molecule. This is achieved by a differential RNA splicing mechanism. Later on in development of B cell, regulation of RNA processing allows expressions of a membrane-bound form of IgD, again with same antigen-binding specificity Throughout this process, the same v region segment is being expressed with different C region segments. \" Class Switching Initially, all B cells matched to an antigen carry IgM specific for that antigen and produce IgM in response to this exposure to antigen. Later gene rearrangement permits elaboration of antibodies of same antigenic specificity but of different immunoglobulin classes. In class switching, the same assembled VH gene can sequentially associate with different CH gene, so immunoglobulin produced later (IgG, IgA or IgE) has the same specificity as original IgM but different biologic characteristics. Class switching is dependent on cytokines released from T cells and also happens after antigenic stimulation. Class switching is possible through a novel recombination event between repeat regions adjacent upstream of each constant heavy region class, the S regions",

        "exp": "CD16 is a cell surface marker used to identify natural killer (NK) cells (lymphocytes lacking most T- and B-cell markers). CD16 is an Fc receptor for IgG, allowing the NK cells to bind to the coated target cell during ADCC, facilitating lysis. Also know: CD3 is a five-polypeptide cluster that represents the non-variable pa of the T-cell receptor complex. The variable pa is able to rearrange itself to adapt to specific antigens. Natural killer cells are CD3-negative. CD19 is a B-cell marker. It is a signal-transducing molecule that is expressed in early B-cell differentiation. NK cells are negative for CD19. C21 is also a B-cell marker. It is a complement receptor, and is also the same receptor the Epstein-Barr virus uses to bind to cells during infection. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 58.

This should be steam, ethylene oxide. If this is not feasible, the endoscopes must at least receive high level disinfection, which consists of a 12 - 20 minute soaking in glutaraldehyde). Endoscopes that will not enter into a sterile cavity and will not violate mucous membranes (i. e., endoscopes, bronchoscopes, cystoscopes) must at least receive a 20 minute soaking in glutaraldehyde, peracetic acid, or hydrogen peroxide before each use. Ionizing radiation carries far greater energy than UV light. It, too, causes direct damage to DNA and produces toxic free radicals and hydrogen peroxide from water within the microbial cells. Cathode rays and gamma rays from cobalt-60 are widely used in industrial processes, including the sterilization of many disposable surgical supplies such as gloves, plastic syringes, specimen containers, some foodstuffs, and the like, because they can be packaged before exposure to the penetrating radiation.

They need their host's ATP as an energy source for their own cellular activity. They are energy parasites using a cell membrane transpo system that uses ATP from the host system and gives out ADP. This obligate intracellular existence makes it impossible to culture these organisms on nonliving aificial media. Due to their small size and failure to grow in cell - free media they were considered to be viruses. Chlamydiae grows in cultures of a variety of eukaryotic cell lines Mc Coy or He. La cells. It may be necessary to treat cells with polyanionic compounds such as DEAD-dextran to reduce the electrostatic barrier to infection. Antimetabolite such as cycloheximide is added to our competition for host cell amino acid pools. All types of chlamydiae proliferate in embryonated eggs paiculary in the yolk sac. The special features in structure and chemical composition of chlamydiae are: The outer cell wall resembles the cell wall of gram negative bacteria It has a relatively high lipid content It is rigid but it does not contain typical bacterial peptidoglycan; perhaps it contain a tetrapeptide linked matrix. N Acetylmuramic acid also appears to be absent from chlamydiae cell wall. Antibiotic susceptibility of chlamydiae: Penicillin binding proteins occur in chlamydiae cell wall and chlamydiae cell wall formation is inhibited by penicillins and other drugs that inhibit transpeptidation of bacterial peptidoglycan. But remember the impoant point about t/t, that cell wall inhibitors result in the production of morphologically defective forms but are not effective in clinical disease. Inhibitors of protein synthesis (tetracyclines, erythromycins) are effective in most clinical infections. Erythromycin or tetracyclines are considered the drug of choice for chlamydiae infections.",

B: Impaired bacteriolysis Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects multiple systems of the body, and arises from a mutation in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene, LYST. It is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to failure of phagolysosome formation. As a result of disordered intracellular trafficking there is impaired lysosome degranulation with phagosomes, so phagocytosed bacteria are not destroyed by the lysosome's enzymes. In addition, secretion of lytic secretory granules by cytotoxic T cells is also affected. The disease is characterised by large lysosome vesicles in phagocytes (neutrophils), which thus have poor bactericidal function, leading to susceptibility to infections, abnormalities in nuclear structure of leukocytes, anemia, and hepatomegaly. There are several manifestations of Chediak-Hegashi syndrome. However neutropenia seems to be the most common. The syndrome is also associated with oculocutaneous albinism Persons are also prone for infection, especially with Staphylococcus aureus.

CHEMICAL STERILIZATION \u25a0 Ethylene oxide (EO or EtO) gas - Most common sterilization method. - Used to sterilize objects sensitive to temperatures > 60\u00b0C such as plastics, optics and electrics. - Carried out at 30-60\u00b0C with relative humidity >30% & gas cone. 200-800 mg/L for at least 3 hrs. - ETO penetrates well, moving through paper, cloth, and some plastic films and is highly effective. - EtO can kill all known viruses, bacteria and fungi; including bacterial spores and is satisfactory. - Bacillus subtilis, a very resistant organism, is used as a rapid biological indicator for EO sterilizers. \u25a0 Glutaraldehyde \u25a0 Glutaraldehyde is a saturated dialdehyde that has gained wide acceptance as a high-level disinfectant and chemical sterilant. \u25a0 It is specifically effective against tubercle bacilli, fungi, and viruses. \u25a0 Has a short shelf life (<2 weeks), and is expensive. \u25a0 It is less toxic and irritant to eyes than formaldehyde. \u25a0 To kill all spores in the liquid can take upto 12 hrs with glutaraldehyde & longer with formaldehyde. \u25a0 It has no deleterious effect on the cement or lenses of instruments like cystoscopes and bronchoscopes. \u25a0 It can safely be used to treat corrugated rubber anesthetic tubes and face masks, plastic endotracheal tubes, polythene tubing, and metal instruments. \u25a0 CIDEX (2% glutaraldehyde) is commonly used for sterilization of endoscopes. \u25a0 Formaldehyde \u25a0 It is less expensive and has a much longer shelf life, but is much more volatile. \u25a0 Formaldehyde is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent. \u25a0 Many vaccines, such as the original Salk polio vaccine, are sterilized with formaldehyde. \u25a0 Ozone is used in industrial settings to sterilize water and air, as well as a disinfectant for surfaces. It has the benefit of being able to oxidize most organic matter. On the other hand, it is a toxic and unstable gas that must be produced onsite, so it is not practical to use in many settings. \u25a0 Chlorine bleach is another accepted liquid sterilizing agent. Household bleach consists of 5. 25% sodium hypochlorite. It is usually diluted to 1/10 immediately before use; however, to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis it should be diluted only 1/5. The dilution factor must take into account the volume of any liquid waste that it is being used to sterilize. Bleach will kill many organisms immediately, but for full sterilization, it should be allowed to react for 20 minutes. Bleach will kill many, but not all spores. It is highly corrosive and may corrode even stainless steel surgical instruments. \u25a0 Chlorine and Na. OH are the most consistent agents for prions. Chlorine is too corrosive to use on certain objects. Na. OH has had many studies showing its effectiveness",

EHEC/verocytotoxin producing E Coli cause hemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Common in infants and young children and produce verotoxin / Shiga like toxin. Primary target for VT is vascular endothelial cells. Typical EHEC strain is stereotype 0157: H7. Also Know: After an average incubation period of 3-5 days, the illness often begins with watery diarrhea for 2-5 days, progressing to bloody diarrhea in up to 90% of patients. The diagnosis can often be suspected from the clinical presentation (bloody stools, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, but little or no fever) and is confirmed by stool cultures using sorbitol-Mac. Conkey agar. An ELISA that detects Shiga toxins in the stool is also available, but occasional false-positive results have been repoed. Hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and microangiopathic anemia are the dreaded complications of EHEC infection and occur most often in children younger than 10 years, although older children and adults are not always spared.

Antigenic variants of influenza virus have a selective advantage over the parental virus in the presence of antibody directed against the original strain. This phenomenon is responsible for the unique epidemiologic features of influenza. Other respiratory tract agents do not display significant antigenic variation. Also know: Minor antigenic changes are termed antigenic drift; major antigenic changes in HA or NA, called antigenic shift, result in the appearance of a new subtype. Antigenic shift is most likely to result in an epidemic. Antigenic drift is caused by the accumulation of point mutations in the gene, resulting in amino acid changes in the protein. Ref: Brooks G.

In addition when IgM on IgG antibodies are deposited on the surfaces of cells they may activate the complement system by the classical pathway and generates C3b and C4b. C3b and C4b gets deposited over the surface of bacterial cell and are recognized by the phagocytes. The net result is phagocytosis. Remember: Antibody mediated destruction of cells may occur by antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) also, where cells are lysed with out phagocytosis.

An MRI of the brain demonstrates widespread areas of abnormal T2 signal in the white matter. An electroencephalogram is remarkable for diffuse slowing over both cerebral hemispheres. Brain biopsy reveals demyelination with abnormal giant oligodendrocytes, some of which contain eosinophilic inclusions. This patient's condition is most closely related to which of the following diseases?",
        "exp": "The condition is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which is a rapidly progressive demyelinating disorder in which the JC virus (a papovavirus) infects oligodendroglial cells in the brain. The eosinophilic inclusions represent accumulations of JC virus. PML occurs in about 1% of AIDS patients, and is the AIDS-defining illness in half of the patients who develop the condition. There is no effective treatment for this disorder. Shingles and post-infectious encephalitis can follow chickenpox, but varicella is not associated specifically with demyelination. Measles can cause an encephalitis, and in some cases, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) may follow previous measles infection. These disorders would affect not only white matter, but gray matter as well. Also, SSPE usually occurs before the age of 18. Syphilis can cause meningitis, encephalitis, and spinal cord damage, but the disease process would not be limited to the white matter. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013). Chapter 44. AIDS and Lentiviruses.
