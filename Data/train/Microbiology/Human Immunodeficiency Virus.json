REF: Jawetz microbiology 24th ed chapter 12\"HIV infects vital cells in the human immune system such as helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and dendritic cells\"TROPISM: The term viral tropism refers to which cell types HIV infects. HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and microglial cells. Macrophage (M-tropic) strains of HIV-1 use the b-chemokine receptor CCR5 for entry and are, thus, able to replicate in macrophages and CD4+ T cells. T-tropic isolates replicate in primary CD4+ T cells as well as in macrophages and use the a-chemokine receptor, CXCR4, for entry. Dual-tropic HIV-1 strains are thought to be transitional strains of HIV-1 and thus are able to use both CCR5 and CXCR4 as co-receptors for viral entry. HIV strain. Tropism. Target.

Specific binding of virus to CD4 receptor is by the envelopc glycoprotein gp-120. However, for infection to take place, cell fusion is essential, which is brought about by the transmembrane gp41. Entry of virus into the cells also requires coreceptor moleculei) Tcells (Helper Tcells) have coreceptor CXCR4 and are infected by T-tropic isolates or syncitia-inducing (SI) strains of HIV (X4 virus). ii) Macrophages have coreceptor CCR5 and are infected by M-tropic isolates or non-syncitia-inducing (NSI) strains of HIV (R5 virus). o Virus using both coreceptors (CXCR4 and CCR5) are called R5. X4 viruses. o Follicular dendritic cells from tonsil can be infected by HIV without the involvement of CD4. o When HIV infects a cell, the viral RNA is transcribed by reverse transcriptase, first into single stranded DNA and then to double stranded DNA (Provirus). Provirus is integrated into host cell chromosome. This provirus initiates viral replication by directing synthesis of viral RNA, in response to viral promoters. Thus, the sequence in replicationis RNA - DNA - RNA & proteins. HIV infection of a cell | Viral RNA inside the cell |Reverse transcriptase. Single stranded DNA |Reverse transcriptase.
