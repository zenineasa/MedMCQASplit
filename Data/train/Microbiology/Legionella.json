Other important species is L. micdadei (Pittsburgh pneumonia agent) which is partial acid fast. o At least 14 serogroups of L. pneumophila have been identifiedo L. pneumophila serogroup l (SG 1) accounts nearly all severe infections. o L. pneumophila serogroup 6 is more commonly involved in hospital - acquired legionnaire's disease. Cultureo Strict aerobeo Has fastidious requirements and grow on complex media such as buffered charcol, yeast extract (BCYE) agar.",

Pontiac fever: It is self limiting flu-like illness with incubatium period of 24-48 hours. There is no pneumonia. 2. Legionnaire's disease: It is an atypical pneumonia with incubation period of 2-10 days. It is characterized by cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, high grade fever, diarrhea, confusion, 'relative' bradycardia and hyponatremia. If onset of symptoms occur within 10 days of discharge from the hospital, nosocomial legionnaire's disease should be suspected.
