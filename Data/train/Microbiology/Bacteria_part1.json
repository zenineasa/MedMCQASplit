Diagnosis of chlamydia. Four approaches are available for the laboratory diagnosis of chlamydial infections. Microscopic demonstration of elementary or inclusion bodies. Isolation of chlamydia (culture). Antigen detection & Nucleic acid hybridization. Serology. Microscopic demonstration of elementary or inclusion bodies, Chlamydial elementary bodies and inclusions are large enough to be seen under the light microscope. Cytological examination is important and useful only in the examination of conjunctivitis and trachoma caused by chlamydia trachomatis. Another method available for microscopic examination is Immunoflorescence using monoclonal antibody. Isolation of chlamydia. Isolation of chlamydia can be done by inoculation into: embryonated eggsexperimental animals (Hi) tissue cultures. Embryonated eggs -Chlamydia can be grown in yolk sac of 6-8 days old chick embryos. Isolation by egg inoculation is tedious and relatively insensitive and has been replaced by tissue cultures. Tissue culture. Cell culture is the preferred method for isolation of chlamydia. Cell cultures for Chlamydia Trachomatis } - Mc. Coy cells Chlamydia Psittaci } Chlamydia pneumonia -HL or HEp+2 cells. Cell cultures used for isolation of chlamydia are pretreated by irradiation or chemicals. Pretreatment with DEAD-dextran reduces the electrostatic barrier to infection before centrifugation of chlamydial or clinical specimen on to the cells. Thus it promotes contact between chlamydial particles and cell monolayer increasing chance of isolation. The cells are then usually incubated in an antimetabolite such as cycloheximide to favour chlamydial competition for host amino acid pool. Antigen detection & Nucleic acid hybridization Antigen detection can be done by two method. Direct florescent antibody (DFA) demonstration -The DFA uses monoclonal antibodies directed against a species specific antigen on the chlamydial major outer membrane protein (MOMP). Enzyme linked immunoassays (EIA'S) -This test detects the presence of genus specific lipopoly saccharide antigens extracted from the elementary bodies in the specimen. Nucleic acid detection * Molecular methods used for the detection of chlamydiae are. Polymerase chain reaction. Ligase chain reaction. Serology. Antibodies against chlamydia can be used for diagnosis. A fourfold rise in titres is diagnostic. Serological test are not useful in the diagnostic of genital chlamydia infections because of high prevalence of chlamydial genital tract infection is some societies. Also know. Hypersensitivity test -Demonstration of hypersensitivity by skin testing (Frei's test) was widely used formerly for diagnosis of L. G. V. but has been given up because of false positive results.

There is chracteristic 'Clubbed appearance'.* Characteristic feature is irregular staining due to presence of granules, called Babes Ernest or volutin granules. These granules are also called metachromatic granules or polar bodies. These granules are composed of polymetaphosphate. Volutin granules are usually stained with Loeffler's methylene blue or toluidine blue and appear reddish violet. Special stains for volutin granules are Ponder's stain, Albert's stain and Neisser's stain.",

Among the three antibiotics that have been shown to treat legionellosis effectively (erythromycin, rifampin, and minocycline), erythromycin is clearly superior, even though in vitro studies show the organism to be susceptible to other antibiotics. Penicillin remains the drug of choice for S. pneumoniae and the group A streptococci, although a few isolates of penicillin-resistant pneumococci have been observed. Resistance among the pneumococci is either chromosomally mediated, in which case the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are relatively low, or plasmid-mediated, which results in highly resistant bacteria. The same is generally true for H. influenzae. Until the mid-1970s, virtually all isolates of H. influenzae were susceptible to ampicillin. There has been a rapidly increasing incidence of ampicillin-resistant isolates, almost 35 to 40% in some areas of the United States. Resistance is ordinarily mediated by b-lactamase, although ampicillin-resistant, b-lactamase-negative isolates have been seen. No resistance to penicillin has been seen in group A streptococci. C. difficile causes toxin-mediated pseudomembranous enterocolitis as well as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Pseudomembranous enterocolitis is normally seen during or after administration of antibiotics. One of the few agents effective against C. difficile is vancomycin. Alternatively, bacitracin can be used. Lyme disease, caused by B. burgdorferi, has been treated with penicillin, erythromycin, and tetracycline. Treatment failures have been observed.

The nonspecific tests (VDRL/RPR) test can be easily ruled out:-Their sensitivity is comparable to that of specific tests in primary and secondary syphilis but in latent or late syphilis they have quite low sensitivity. Specific Tests TPIIn its time TPI was the most specific test available for diagnosis of syphilis and was considered \"gold standard\" in syphilis serology. However because of its extreme complexity it was available only in few laboratories. The TPI test has now been supplanted by other tests such as FTA-ABS and TPHA which are quite as specific and much simpler. FTA-ABS test. FTA-ABS test is as specific as the TPI test and is now accepted as the standard reference test. However it can be done only in suitably equipped laboratories, it is not available for routine testing. TPHA test. TPHA test is just as specific as FTA-ABS and almost as sensitive except in the primary stage. It is also much simple and more economical. These advantages have made TPHA a standard confirmations test. TPPA test. The TPHA test has been replaced by the serodia TP-PA test which is more sensitive for primary syphilis. TPHA is widely available in Europe but not used in U. S. A. From the discussion above, and from the table reproduced from Harrison, it seems, the TPPA is the most sensitive test for syphilis. Both FTA-ABS and TP-PA are equally sensitive in secondary and latent syphilis. TP-PA has higher sensitivity in Primary syphilis. The problem is that enough datas for TP-PA are not available. Sensitivity of Serodiagnostic tests in Syphilis. Test. Primary. Secondary. Latent. Tertiary* VDRL/RPR78 (74-87)10095(88-100)71 (37-94)* FTA-ABS84 (70-100)10010096* TP-PA89100100. NADiagnosis of syphilis:-Treponema pallidum cannot be isolated by routine culture methods therefore detection is either by direct visualization of the organisms in material from the lesion or indirectly by immunological/serological methods. Each stage of the treponematoses requires a particular testing modality. Absolute diagnosis during the first and second stages can be made by direct examination under dark field microscopy of a specimen from primary chancre, the maculopapular rash, or the condyloma latum. Since the direct visualization of spirochetes is effective only during the active stages of primary and secondary syphilis, serologic tests were developed. Serological tests in syphilis are of two types. Nonspecific treponemal tests. Specific treponemal tests Nonspecific treponemal tests: -Infection with syphilis results in cellular damage and the release into the serum of a number of lipids including cardiolipin and lecithin. The body produces antibodies against these antigens. Nonspecific treponemal tests detects the presence of these antibodies to lipoprotein material from damaged cells and cardiolipin from treponemes and as a consequence are not specific for Treponema. (Reactivity in these tests indicates host tissue damage). If the patient has these antibodies it is assumed that he or she has syphilis. These tests are used for screening of syphilis. If these tests are positive presence of the disease should be confirmed by specific tests. The tests commonly employed are: -Venereal disease Research laboratory test (VDRL TEST). Rapid plasma Regain Test (RPR test). Why are these tests nonspecific?? These tests measure antibodies directed against cardiolipin antigen that results from interaction of host tissues with Treponema Pallidum or spirochete itself. (They do not detect the antibodies against Treponema itself). Cardiolipin is a phospholipid and it is possible that a similar substance present in the treponemal cell or released from damage host cells damaged by the stimulate antibody production. Assays for nonspecific antibody, because of their low cost and technical simplicity have routinely been used as screening test for evidence of syphilis since these tests have relatively low specificity positive results are confirmed by detection of specific anti Treponemal antibody. Antibody develops in 70% of patients within 2 weeks of developing chancre and in 100% of patients with secondary syphilis. The important point about nonspecific treponemal tests is that they can be used quantitatively: -Quantitative result of these tests tends to correlate with disease activity thus they are very helpful for screening. A fourfold or greater rise in the titre may be seen during the evolution of early syphilis. In secondary syphilis, test results are always positive and often at a high titre. The nonspecific treponemal tests should become nonreactive one year after successful therapy in primary syphilis and 2 years after successful therapy in late syphilis. Therefore these tests can be used to monitor response to treatment. - After successful treatment there would be sustained four fold decrease in antibody titre. Similarly a fourfold increase in titre following therapy suggests reinfection or relapse and necessitates re- evaluation. Nonspecific Treponemal tests for syphilis VDRL Test. The VDRL test is a nonspecific serological test for syphilis. It uses a mixture of cardiolipin, cholesterol and lecithin as antigen. With the use of these antigens, IgG or IgM antibodies present in the serum or C. S. F. (in case of neurosyphilis) are detected. This test can be used quantitatively and increase in VDRL titre with time can be used to confirm a diagnosis of syphilis. R. P. R. It is also a nonspecific test which uses cardiolipin as antigen. Treponemal specific tests. While the nonspecific tests look for anti lipoidal antibodies the specific treponemal tests look for antibodies against the spirochete itself. The tests included in this category are: -Indirect immunofluorescence treponemal antibody-absorption test (FTA-ABS) test. Treponema Pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) or microhemagglutination test (MHA-TP). Treponema Pallidum immobilization test (TPI). Enzyme immune assay (ELISA). TPPA test. These tests are used to confirm a positive nontreponemal reaginic test. Treponema specific tests are not completely specific for syphilis because false positive reactions can occur with other spirochetal diseases (e. g., Yaws, pinta leptospirosis, rat bite fever, relapsing fever, Lyme disease). An important point about these tests is that they do not correlate with disease activity. These test findings become positive soon after infection and typically remain positive for life despite adequate treatment.",

The bacilli remain confined to the site of entry-, where they multiply and form the toxin. o Toxin causes local necrotic changes and the resulting fibrinous exudate, together with the disintegration and bacteria, constitute the pseudomembrane, which is characteristic of diphtheric infection, o The mechanical complications of diphtheria are due to the membrane, while the systemic effects are due to the toxin. o Toxin is heat labile. o The toxigenicity of the diphtheria bacilli depends on the presence in it of corvnephages (tox +). Nontoxigenic strains may be rendered toxigenic by infecting them with beta phage or some other larger phage. This is known as lysogenic conversion or phage conversion. o C. diphtheriae does not need to be toxigenic to establish localized infection - Jawetz 23rd.

Diphtheria toxino The diphtheria toxin acts by inhibiting protein synthesis. It inhibits polypeptide chain elongation in the presence of nicotinamide adinine dinucleotide (NAD) by inactivating elongation factor, EF - 2. o The diphtheria toxin is a protein which consists of two fragments, A and B. o Both fragments are necessary for the toxic effect: Fragment A - has enzymatic activity' and inhibits protein synthesis by inhibiting the chain elongation by inactivating the elongation factor - 2 (Ef - 2). Fragment B - responsible for binding the toxin to the cells, o Toxin has special affinity for certain tissues such as myocardium, adrenals and nerve endings. o The strain almost universally used for toxin production is the \"Park williams 8 strain \"o Toxin production is influenced by the concentration of iron in the medium. o The optimum level of iron for toxin production is 0. 1 mg per liter, while a concentration of 0. 5 mg per litre inhibits the formation of toxin.",

Humans become infected by a variety of routes, including ingestion of contaminated animal products (B. abortus in cattle), direct contact with contaminated animal material or with infected animals themselves (Y. enterocolitica and B. bronchiseptica in dogs), and animal bites (P. multocida in many different animals). The laboratory differentiation of these microbes may be difficult and must rely on a number of parameters, including biochemical and serologic reactions, development of specific antibody response in affected persons, and epidemiologic evidence of infection. Yersinia enterocolitica are motile at 77degC (25degC) and nonmotile at 98. 6degF (37degC). They are found in the intestinal tract of animals and cause a variety of clinical syndromes in humans. Transmission to humans probably occurs via animal fecal contamination of food, drink, or fomites. The brucellae are obligate parasites of animals and humans and are located intracellularly. Brucella abortus is typically found in cattle. Brucellosis (undulant fever) has an acute bacteremic phase followed by a chronic stage that may last years and involve many tissues. Brucella abortus requires CO2 for growth and is most often isolated from blood and bone marrow. Species differentiation is due to dye (thionine) sensitivity. Bordetella bronchiseptica causes diseases in animals (kennel cough in dogs) and occasionally respiratory disease and bacteremia in humans. Bordetella requires enriched medium (Bordet-Gengou) and is strongly urease-positive. Pasteurella multocida occurs worldwide in the respiratory and GI tracts of many domestic and wild animals.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Enterohemorrhagic E coii. ESCHERICHIA COLIAt least six distinct \"pathotypes\" of intestinal pathogenic E. coli exist: o Enteropathoaenic E. coli [Entcroadherent E. colil. It causes diarrhoea in infants and children usually occuring as institutional out breaks. It does not produce enterotoxin, nor are they invasive. They adhere to the mucosa of small intestine and cause disruption of the brush border microvilli. These strains can be identified by their adhesion to HEP - 2 cells. o Enterotoxigenic E. coli. It causes traveller's diarrhoea [ETEC is the most common cause of traveller's diarrhea). It produces enterotoxins. They can produce heat labile toxin (LT) or heat stable toxin or both. Toxin production alone may not lead to illness. The strain should first be able to adhere to intestinal mucosa. This adhesiveness is medicated by fimbrial or colonisation factor antigen (CFA). o Enteroinvasive E. coli. They themselves resemble shigella and their infection resembles shigellosis (remember: shiga like toxin is elaborated by enterohemorrhagic E. coli). They produce mild diarrhoea to frank dvsentry and occur in adult as well as in children. They have been termed enteroinvasive because they have the capacity to invade intestinal epithelial cells in vivo and penetrate He. La or HEP - 2 cells in tissue culture. This ability of penetration is plasmid determined which codes for outer membrane antigens called the Hirulence marker antigen\" (VMA). The detection of plasmid can be diagnostic. For laboratory diagnosis of EIEC, the sereny test used to be employed. These strains are non motile, do not ferment lactose or ferment it late with acid without producing any gas. o Enterohemorrhagic E. coli or verotoxigenic E. coli. These strains produce verocytotoxin (VT) or shiga like toxin (SLT). They can cause mild diarrhoea to fatal hemorrhagic colitis. Shiga like toxin belongs to class ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs). It inhibits protein synthesis by inhibiting ribosomal function. This toxin also acts on vascular endothelium to promote the synthesis of coagulation factor VIII, v. WF - Platelet aggregation. They can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome particularly in young children and the elderly. O 157: H 7 is the most prominent serotype of EHEC, associated with HUS, but 06, 026, 055, 091, 0103, 0111, 0113 and OX3 have also been associated with this syndrome. The primary target for V. T is vascular endothelium. The typical EHEC is serotype O157: H7 which does not ferement sorbital unlike majority of E. coli (but Harrison writes that few species of this serotype can ferment sorbital). Some other serotype like O26: H1 also belongs to this group. Laboratory diagnosis of VIEC diarrhea is established by demonstration of the bacilli or VT in feces directly or in culture. o Enteroaggrecative E. coli}# In developing countries and young children.# Can cause traveller's diarrhea and persistent diarrhea.# In vitro, thev exhibit a \"stacked - brick\" adherence pattern on Hep - 2 cells. o Diffusely adherent E. coli# Enteroaggregative E. coli forms a low molecular weight heat stable enterotoxin EAST -1 (enteroaggregative heat stable enterotoxin -1).",

The motility test rapidly differentiates listeria from diphtheroids that are members of the normal microbiota of the skin. The organism has several adhesion proteins (Ami, Fbp A, and flagellin proteins) that facilitate bacterial binding to the host cells and that contribute to virulence. It has cell wall surface proteins called internalins A and B that interact with E-cadherin, a receptor on epithelial cells, promoting phagocytosis into the epithelial cells. After phagocytosis, the bacterium is enclosed in a phagolysosome, where the low pH activates the bacterium to produce listeriolysin. This enzyme, along with two phospholipases, lyses the membrane of the phagolysosome and allows the listeriae to escape into the cytoplasm of the epithelial cell. The organism proliferates, and ActA, another listerial surface protein, induces host cell actin polymerization, which propels them to the cell membrane. Pushing against the host cell membrane, they cause formation of elongated protrusions called filopods. These filopods are ingested by adjacent epithelial cells, macrophages, and hepatocytes, the listeriae are released, and the cycle begins again.

A positive Quellung reaction is the result of the binding of the capsular polysaccharide of pneumococci with type specific antibody contained in the typing antiserum. The protocol has three main steps: -a. Preparation of a bacterial cell suspension, b. Mixing of cells and antisera on a glass slide, and. Note: -a. It is recommended to initially test with pooled antisera in succession until a positive reaction is observed. b. Typing should then proceed by testing with individual group and serotype-specific antisera included in the antisera pool that gave a positive reaction to determine the serogroup and serotype. c. Reading the Quellung reaction using a microscope. Principle: -a. An antigen-antibody reaction causes a change in the refractive index of the capsule so that it appears \"swollen\" and more visible. After the addition of a counter stain (methylene blue), the pneumococcal cells stain dark blue and are surrounded by a sharply demarcated halo which represents the outer edge of the capsule. b.

The three main species of clinical importance are Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus.* Staphylococcus aureus is coagulase-positive, which differentiates it from the other species. The coagulase-negative staphylococci are normal human flora and sometimes cause infection, often associated with implanted appliances and devices, especially in very young, old, and immunocompromised patients.* Approximately 75% of these infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci are due to S epidermidis. Staphylococci produce catalase, which converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. The catalase test differentiates the staphylococci, which are positive, from the streptococci, which are negative. S saprophyticus is typically nonpigmented, novobiocin-resistant, and nonhemolytic; it causes urinary tract infections in young women.

It is elaborated by the organism following its colonization of the small intestine. Effect of cholera toxin leads to watery diarrhoea, the characteristic feature of cholera. Mechanism of Cholera Toxin Action. Cholera toxin consists of 2 subunits a monomeric enzymatic moiety (A subunit) a pentameric binding moiety (B subunit). The B-subunit, serves as a 'landing pad' and binds to GM1 ganglioside, a glycolipid on the surface of epithelial cells of the small intestine. This facilitates the entry of A-subunit into the epithelial cells. The entry of A-subunit into the cells leads to activation of its A1 fragment. Activated A1 interacts with cytosolic proteins called ADP-ribosylation factors (ARF). The ARF-A1 complexes catalyze ADP-ribosylation of a G-protein called GSa. The ADP-ribosylated Gsa in turn binds to and stimulates adenylate cyclase. Activated adenylate cyclase generates high levels of intracellular cyclic AMP (c. AMP) from ATP. c. AMP inhibits the absorptive sodium transport system (decreases sodium & chloride reabsorption) and activates the secretory chloride transport system (increases chloride and bicarbonate secretion). This leads to accumulation of sodium chloride in the intestinal lumen. Accumulated sodium chloride draws water into the lumen due to increased osmolality leading to watery diarrhoea.

Ananthnaryan microbiology, 6th ed., 270)# Characteristics of E. coli - All members of Enterobacteriaceae family have in common the fact that they- Ferment glucose, - Oxidase negative, and- Reduce nitrates to nitrites. ENTEROBACTERIACEAEIntroduction# E. coli is the most commonly found aerobic, gram-negative bacilli in the GI tract of humans.# E. coli is responsible for over 80 percent of UTIs, and others like gastroenteritis, sepsis, and neonatal meningitis.# Most of these cause a self-limited diarrhea with the exception of enterohemorrhagic E. coli, frequently known as E. coli serotype O157: H7. which is usually acquired from eating poorly cooked meat from an infected cow.# Complications of infection with this organism include hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).# Hemolysin HlyA is particularly important in producing an inflammatory response in the urinary tract, whereas most of the other exotoxins are more pathogenic in the GI tract.# E. coli are divided into serogroups based on the O antigen found on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the cell membrane and the H antigen found on the flagella. Diagnosis# A quantitative urine culture from a symptomatic patient should demonstrate greater than 105 colony-forming units (CFUs) bacteria/mL urine to be considered significant.# E. coli would appear as pink colonies on Mac. Conkey agar indicating fermentation of lactose. A rapid spot indole test would give a preliminary identification of E. coli, which would be confirmed by biochemical analysis. Treatment and Prevention# Common antimicrobials chosen include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or a fluoroquinolone.# Most E. coli are resistant to ampicillin and penicillin.

There will be no opacity around the colonies on the half of the plate with the antitoxin; due to specific neutralization of alpha toxin. This is known as Naegler reaction. CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS (I. E., CLOSTRIDIUM WELCHII)# Clostridia are ubiquitous gram-positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobes.# In human, Clostridia normally reside in GIT and in female genital tract. They are present in normal colonic flora at concentration of 109 to 1010 per gram and are excreted in faeces.# C. perfringens is the most common of the clostridial species isolated from tissue infections and bacteremia. 80% cases of gas gangrene are caused by C. perfringens. Is an anaerobic gram positive, spore-bearing bacillus. Gas gangrene producing strains of C. perfringens produce spores that are heat-labile.# Clostridium welchii is most frequently encountered (60%) in cases of gas gangrene. Clostridium novyi and Clostridium septicum (20-40%) are next common. Clostridium tetani do not cause gas gangrene.# Other Clostridia that can cause are C. bifermantans, C. sporogenes, C. fallax, and. C. histolyticum.# Major toxins of Cl. Perfringens (i. e. Cl. welchii) are: Alpha (is phospholipase ), Beta, Epsilon and Iota.# The alpha toxin produced by C. perfringens has been associated with gas gangrene and is known to be hemolytic, to destroy platelets and PMN leukocytes and cause widespread capillary damage. It is the principal toxin, a phospholipase C (Lecithinase).# Two factors are essential for development of severe disease, tissue necrosis and low oxidation-reduction potential.# Exposure of all the affected muscles with debridement of devitalized muscle tissue is the treatment of choice though systemic antibiotics (penicillin is the drug of choice) and hyperbaric oxygen are useful adjuncts.# Anti-gas gangrene serum is of doubtful value.

Explanation: Staphylococcus. Staphylococci may be typed, based on their susceptibility to bacteriophages. An internationally accepted set of phages is used for typing. Staphylococcal phage typing is done by a pattern method. The phage type of the strain is expressed by the designations of all the phages that lyse it. Thus, if a strain is lysed only by phages 52 79 and 80, it is called phage type 52/79/80. Phage typing is of great importance in epidemiological studies of staphylococcal infections. Streptococcus. The Streptococcus are classified on the basis of their hemolytic properties as alpha, beta and gamma groups. Beta hemolytic streptococci were classified by Lancefield serologically into groups based on the nature of a carbohydrate (C) antigen on the cell wall. These are known as Lancefield groups, twenty of which have been identified so far and named A-V (without I and J). Vibrio cholerae. The El Tor strains are differentiated from Classical strains of Vibrio cholerae based on nonhemolytic nature, negative VP tests, chick cell agglutination, polymyxin sensitivity and phage susceptibility tests. Salmonella. Important pathogens such as S tvphi, S paratyphi A and B. and S typhimurium can he further typed for epidemiological purposes by phage susceptibility. Intraspecies classification of S typhi for epidemiological purposes was made possible by bacteriophage typing, first developed by Craigie and Yen (1937). They found that a bacteriophage acting on the Vi antigen of the typhoid bacillus (Vi phage II) was highly adaptable. The parent phage is called phage A. It could be made specific for a particular strain of typhoid bacillus by serial propagation in the strain. Phage typing also provides information on the trends and patterns in the epidemiology of typhoid at the local, national and international levels. The phage type is stable.",

S. boydii does not produce H2S, does not hydrolyze urea and does not grow in KCN broth. Carbohydrates are usually fermented and these include glucose (in the absence of gas production), D-mannitol, arabinose, trehalose and mannose.# Lactose fermentation is a biochemical property commonly used for to distinguish Shigella from the closely related bacterium E. coli. However, S. sonnei isolates ferment lactose at a lot slower process than other species of Shigella. S. sonnei is known to be less virulent than other Shigella species.# S. dysenteriae type 1 differs from most of the Enterobacteriaceae in that it does not produce catalase. Shigella dysenteriae type 1 produces severe disease symptoms collectively called shigellosis, which may be associated with life-threatening complications.# Shigella flexneri is a facultative anaerobe. It makes ATP via aerobic respiration in the presence of oxygen and via fermentation in the absence of oxygen. Although it is closely related to Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri can be differentiated because it fails to ferment lactose or decarboxylate lysine.# 5. boydii, when found in the intestine, go though anaerobic metabolic pathways but can survive outside of the body due to its ability to utilize aerobic pathways. More specifically, 5. boydii, typically does not have oxidase enzymes but rather catalase enzymes (catalyzes the reduction of H2. O2->H20). Methyl red testing is positive, meaning that the bacteria uses a mixed acid fermentation pathway. Voges-Proskauer and Simmons' citrate reactions are negative, meaning that this organism does not utilize the butylene glycol pathway or produce acetoin. Lysine decarboxylase, arginine dihydrolase and ornithine decarboxylase are not present. S. boydii does not produce H2S, does not hydrolyze urea and does not grow in KCN broth.

Leptospirosis is suspected. Which of the following laboratory tests is most appropriate to determine whether he has been infected with leptospira?",
        "exp": "Leptospirosis is a zoonosis of worldwide distribution. Human infection results from ingestion of water or food contaminated with leptospirae. Rats, mice, wild rodents, dogs, swine, and cattle excrete the organisms in urine and feces during active illness and during an asymptomatic carrier state. Drinking, swimming, bathing, or food consumption may lead to human infection. Children acquire the disease from dogs more often than do adults. Treatment can include doxycycline, ampicillin, or amoxicillin. Symptoms in humans range from fever and rash to jaundice through aseptic meningitis. Leptospirae are tightly coiled, thin, flexible spirochetes 5 to 15mm long, with one end bent into a hook. It stains best where silver can be impregnated into the organism. The gram stain would not be useful. The organisms derive energy from oxidation of fatty acids, so EMB or TM agar would be inadequate.
