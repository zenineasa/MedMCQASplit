This rule is especially true of media that are intended to have a selective (select for a specific group of bacteria) or differential (differentiate between a pathogenic and a normal or usual strain of a group) purpose. Bacteria and plants use photosynthetic energy to reduce carbon dioxide expending water. The organisms that can use CO2 as a sole source of carbon are termed autotrophs. Chemolithotrophs are organisms that use an inorganic substrate, such as hydrogen or thiosulfate, as a reductant and CO2 a carbon source. Heterotrophs require organic carbon for growth. Many organisms possess the ability to assimilate nitrate (NO. 3) and nitrite (NO2) reductively by conveing these forms to ammonia (NH3). Dissimilation pathways are taken by microorganisms that use these ions as terminal electron acceptors in respiration. This process is known as denitrification, with the final product being nitrogen gas (N2). Fermentation is characterized by substrate phosphorylation, in which products such as glucose are involved for energy production. Autotrophs should not be confused with auxotrophs. Auxotrophs are strains that require a nutrient that is not required by the parental or prototype strain. They are usually derived from mutants with defective synthetic capabilities.

Bacterial conjugation was first described by Lederberg and Tatum (1946) in a strain of E. coli called K12 and has been most extensively studied in strain. It takes place between a male cell and a female cell. the maleness or donor status of a cell is determined by the presence in it of a plasmid that coded for specialized fimbriae which project from the surface of the cell. the plasmid DNA replicates and a copy of it passes from the donor to the recipient attains donor status and can in turn conjugated with other female cells. the maleness in bacteria is thus a transmissible or infectious characteristic. Along with plasmid DNA, a poion of the host DNA also are sometimes transferred to the recipient the donor DNA then combines with DNA of the rrecipientaffecting genetic recombination. it was E. coli K12 that the role of the plasmid in conjugation was first recognized the plasmid responsible was termed the sex facto or feility (F)factor. When other similar similar plasmids were also discovered the term transfer factor came to be used for all such plasmids when conferred on their host cells the ability to act as da one in conjugation.

In such situations, a substance that has a stimulating effect on the bacteria to be grown or an inhibitory effect on those to be suppressed are incorporated in the medium. If such substances are added to a liquid medium the result is an absolute increase in the number of the wanted bacterium relative to other bacteria. such media are called enrichment media. for eg: tetrathionate broth where the tetrathionate inhibit coliforms while allowing typhoid -paratyphoid bacilli to grow freely, and selenite F broth for dysentery bacilli",

VT is also composed of A and B subunits. VT production is found to be phage encoded in several Esch. coli strains Besides VT1 and VT there is another toxin named VT2v toxin differs from VT1 and VT2 in that it is not cytotoxic to Hela cells and is not phage encoded pg no 226 Diphtheria toxin -the pathogenicity is due to production of a very powerful exotoxin by virulent strins of diphtheria bacilli. About 90-95% gravis and intermedius strains are toxigenic, while only 80-85% of mitis strains are so. avirulent strains are frequent among convalescents, carries and contacts. the strain most widely used for toxin production is park -williams 8 strain which has been described as a mitis strain and as an intermedius strain. the toxigenicity of the diphtheria bacillus depend=s on the presence of a tox gene which can be transferred from one bacterium to another by lysogenic bacteriophages, of which beta phage is the most impoant. Non toxic genic strains may be rendered toxigenic by infecting them with beta phage. this process is known as lysogenic conversion. the toxigenicity remains as long as the bacteria is lysogenic. When the bacteria is freed of its phage as by growing in the presence of antiphage serum, it loses the toxigenicity and becomes non toxigenic strain. in addition to beta phage other phage s are also known to carry tox genes Ref: textbook of Microbiology Dr. C.

Fimbriae function as organs of adhesion helping the cells to adhere firmly to the paicle of various kinds. This propey may serve to anchor the bacteria in nutritionally orable microenvironments. Fimbriated bacteria form surface pellicles in liquid media. Many fimbriated cells agglutinate red blood cells of guinea pigs, fowl, horses, and pigs strongly human and sheep cells weakly and ox cells scarcely. A special type of fimbriae is sex pili. They are found on male bacteria and help in the attachment of those cells to female bacteria forming hollow conjugation tubes through which it is assumed genetic material is transferred from the donor to the recipient cell.

Capasule too thin to be seen under light microscope are called micro capsule. The slime is generally but not invariably, polysaccharide or polypeptide in nature. some bacteria have both slime layer and capsule. Bacteria secreting large amount of slime produce mucoid growth on agar which is of stringy consistency when touched with loop. Slime have little affinity for basic dyes and is not visible in gram stained smears. Special capsule staining techniques are available usually employing copper salts as mordants. Capsules may be readily demonstrated by negative stainig in wet films with indian ink when they are seen as clear halos around the bacteria against a black background. Capsular material is antigenic and may be demonstrated by serological methods. When a suspension of a capsulated bacterium is mixed with its specific anticapsular serum and examined under microscope, the capsule become very prominent and appears to be swollen due to increase in its refractivity. The capsule swelling or quellung reaction was widely employed for the typing of pneumococci in the pre sulphonamide days when lobar pneumonia used to be treated with specific anticapsular sera. Capsule protect bacteria from deleterious agents such as lytic enzymes in found in nature. They also contribute to the virulence of pathogenic bacteria by inhibiting phagocytosis. Loss of capsule by mutation may render the bacterium avirulent. Repeated subcultures in vitro leads to the loss of capsule and also of virulence. REF: Ananthanarayan and Panicker's Textbook of.

Bacterial conjugation was first described by Lederberg and Tatum (1946) in a strain of E. coli called K12 and has been most extensively studied in strain. it takes place between a male cell and a female cell. the maleness or donor status of a cell is determined by the presence in it of a plasmid that coded for specialised fimbriae which project from surface of the cell..

        "exp": "Conjugation: it is the process where by a male or donor bacterium mates or makes physical contact with a female or recepient bacterium and transfer genetic material into it. This has been considered to be the bacterial equivalent of sexual mating in higher organisms but the analogy is irrelevant as following conjugation the female bacterium is in turn conveed into male cell. Bacterial conjugation was first described by Lederberg and Tatum (1946) in a strain of E. coli called K12 and has been most extensively studied in strain. it takes place between a male cell and a female cell. The maleness or donor status of a cell is determined by the presence in it of a plasmid that coded for specialised fimbriae which project from surface of the cell.. The plasmid DNA replicate and a copy of it passes from the donor to the recepirnt attains donor status and can inturn conjugate with other female cells. The maleness in bacteria is thus a transmissible or infectious characteristic. along with plasmid DNA, poion of the host DNA also are sometimes transferred to the recepient. the donor DNA then combines with DNA of the recepient effecting genetic recombination. It was E. coli K12 that the role of plasmid in conjugation was first recognised. the plasmid responsible was termed the sex facto or feility (F)factor. When other similar similar plasmids were also discovered the term transfer factor came to be used for all such plasmids when conferred on their host cells the ability to act as donor in conjugation.

An accidental observation that chicken cholera bacillus cultures left on the branch for several weeks lost their pathogenic propey but retained their ability to protect the birds against subsequent infection by them, led to the discovery of the process of attenuation and the development of a live vaccine. He attenuated cultures of the anthrax bacillus by incubation at high temperature and proved that inoculation of such cultures in animals induced specific protection against anthrax.
