This rule is especially true of media that are intended to have a selective (select for a specific group of bacteria) or differential (differentiate between a pathogenic and a normal or usual strain of a group) purpose. Bacteria and plants use photosynthetic energy to reduce carbon dioxide expending water. The organisms that can use CO2 as a sole source of carbon are termed autotrophs. Chemolithotrophs are organisms that use an inorganic substrate, such as hydrogen or thiosulfate, as a reductant and CO2 a carbon source. Heterotrophs require organic carbon for growth. Many organisms possess the ability to assimilate nitrate (NO.3) and nitrite (NO2) reductively by conveing these forms to ammonia (NH3). Dissimilation pathways are taken by microorganisms that use these ions as terminal electron acceptors in respiration. This process is known as denitrification, with the final product being nitrogen gas (N2). Fermentation is characterized by substrate phosphorylation, in which products such as glucose are involved for energy production. Autotrophs should not be confused with auxotrophs. Auxotrophs are strains that require a nutrient that is not required by the parental or prototype strain. They are usually derived from mutants with defective synthetic capabilities.

This has been considered to be the bacterial equivalent of sexual mating in higher organisms but the analogy is irrelevant as following conjugation the female bacterium is, in turn, conveed into a male cell. Bacterial conjugation was first described by Lederberg and Tatum (1946) in a strain of E.coli called K12 and has been most extensively studied in strain. It takes place between a male cell and a female cell. the maleness or donor status of a cell is determined by the presence in it of a plasmid that coded for specialized fimbriae which project from the surface of the cell. the plasmid DNA replicates and a copy of it passes from the donor to the recipient attains donor status and can in turn conjugated with other female cells.the maleness in bacteria is thus a transmissible or infectious characteristic. Along with plasmid DNA, a poion of the host DNA also are sometimes transferred to the recipient the donor DNA then combines with DNA of the rrecipientaffecting genetic recombination. it was E.coli K12 that the role of the plasmid in conjugation was first recognized the plasmid responsible was termed the sex facto or feility (F)factor. When other similar similar plasmids were also discovered the term transfer factor came to be used for all such plasmids when conferred on their host cells the ability to act as da one in conjugation.

The present was done to identify and characterize the most common plasmid-mediated ESBL genes associated with diabetic foot infections in Egypt. Methods and findings: A total of 135 Gram negative bacterial isolates were re- covered from 91 diabetic foot ulcers specimens of patients attending governmental hospitals and private clinics in Cairo, Egypt. The antibiogram analysis revealed a remarkable high resistance pattern towards different classes of the tested antimi- crobial agents. Based on CLSI, a total of 114 isolates out of 135 were considered potential ESBLs producer by using disc diffusion and broth microdilution screening assays followed by double disc synergy test (DDST). 58 out of 114 isolates were ESBLs producers and almost 14% (8 out of 58), were plasmid-mediated as deter- mined by plasmid extraction and transformation experiments. The majority of the tested plasmids (6 out of 8) carried 2 or more genes on the same plasmid. The most common combination was blaCTX-M and blaTEM (n=3/8; 37.5%), followed by blaSHV and blaCTX-M(n=2/8; 25%) and blaCTX-M+ blaTEM+ blaSHV (n=1/8;12.5%). One E.coli isolate harbored a plasmid (pECDF16) coding for the three ESBLs genes. The final nucleotide sequences of blaTEM1 and blaSHV-8 were submitted to the GenBank database under accessions coder JX976326, and JX976327, respectively. Conclusion: High prevalence of plasmid-mediated ESBLs was detected among DFIs in Egypt. Therefore, new guidelines should be undeaken in Egypt to limit or prevent the misuse and abuse of antimicrobial agents.",

Hence it is customary to use staining techniques to produce color contrast. Bacteria may be stained in the living state, but this type of staining is employed only for special purposes. Routine methods of staining of bacteria involve drying and fixing smears - procedures that kill them. Bacteria have an affinity to basic dyes due to the acidic nature of their protoplasm.

Ultra-high temperature (UHT) method Involves heating the milk at a temperature of 138oC or 280oF and holding it for atleast two seconds. Milk labelled ultra-pasteurized or UHT must be treated with the UHT method By these processes all non-sporing bacteria such as Mycobacteria, Brucella and Salmonella are destroyed.

Many fimbriated cells agglutinate red blood cells of guinea pigs, fowl, horses, and pigs strongly human and sheep cells weakly and ox cells scarcely. A special type of fimbriae is sex pili . They are found on male bacteria and help in the attachment of those cells to female bacteria forming hollow conjugation tubes through which it is assumed genetic material is transferred from the donor to the recipient cell.

Capasule too thin to be seen under light microscope are called micro capsule. The slime is generally but not invariably ,polysaccharide or polypeptide in nature. some bacteria have both slime layer and capsule. Bacteria secreting large amount of slime produce mucoid growth on agar which is of stringy consistency when touched with loop. Slime have little affinity for basic dyes and is not visible in gram stained smears. Special capsule staining techniques are available usually employing copper salts as mordants. Capsules may be readily demonstrated by negative stainig in wet films with indian ink when they are seen as clear halos around the bacteria against a black background. Capsular material is antigenic and may be demonstrated by serological methods. When a suspension of a capsulated bacterium is mixed with its specific anticapsular serum and examined under microscope , the capsule become very prominent and appears to be swollen due to increase in its refractivity. The capsule swelling or quellung reaction was widely employed for the typing of pneumococci in the pre sulphonamide days when lobar pneumonia used to be treated with specific anticapsular sera. Capsule protect bacteria from deleterious agents such as lytic enzymes in found in nature. They also contribute to the virulence of pathogenic bacteria by inhibiting phagocytosis. Loss of capsule by mutation may render the bacterium avirulent. Repeated subcultures in vitro leads to the loss of capsule and also of virulence.

This has been considered to be the bacterial equivalent of sexual mating in higher organisms but the analogy is irrelevant as following conjugation the female bacterium is in turn conveed into male cell. Bacterial conjugation was first described by Lederberg and Tatum (1946) in a strain of E.coli called K12 and has been most extensively studied in strain. it takes place between a male cell and a female cell. the maleness or donor status of a cell is determined by the presence in it of a plasmid that coded for specialised fimbriae which project from surface of the cell.. The plasmid DNA replicate and a copy of it passes from the donor to the recepirnt attains donor status and can inturn conjugate with other female cells. The maleness in bacteria is thus a transmissible or infectious characteristic . along with plasmid DNA , poion of the host DNA also are sometimes transferred to the recepient. The donor DNA then combines with DNA of the recepient effecting genetic recombination. It was E.coli K12 that the role of plasmid in conjugation was first recognised. The plasmid responsible was termed the sex facto or feility (F)factor .when other similar similar plasmids were also discovered the term transfer factor came to be used for all such plasmids when conferred on their host cells the ability to act as donor in conjugation.

An accidental observation that chicken cholera bacillus cultures left on the branch for several weeks lost their pathogenic propey but retained their ability to protect the birds against subsequent infection by them, led to the discovery of the process of attenuation and the development of a live vaccine. He attenuated cultures of the anthrax bacillus by incubation at high temperature and proved that inoculation of such cultures in animals induced specific protection against anthrax.

        "exp": "Factor: The F factor is the transfer factor that contains the genetic information necessary for the synthesis of sex pilus and for self-transfer but is devoid of other identifiable genetic markers such as drug resistance. Cells carrying the F factor have no distinguishing feature other than their ability to mate with F - cells and render them F+. he F factor is actually an episode and has the ability to exist in some cells in the integrated data or inseed into the host chromosome. Such cells are able to transfer the chromosomal gene to recipient cells with high frequency and are known as Hfr cells. following conjugation with an Hfr cell an F- only rarely becomes F+ though it receives chromosomal genes from the donors.
