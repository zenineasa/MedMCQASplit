Overall rate of migration and optimal range of size for separation are determined by the chemical nature of the gel and by the degree of its crosslinking. Highly cross-linked gels optimize the separation of small DNA fragments. The dye ethidium bromide forms a brightly fluorescent color as it binds to DNA, and so small amounts of separated DNA fragments can be photographed on gels. Specific DNA fragments can be recognized by probes containing complementary sequences. Usually performed to visualize the amplified DNA after PCR, but may be used as a preparative technique prior to use of other Just a method of visualizing the DNA after separating by size.
