        "question": "Diphtheria toxin resembles toxin of?",
        "exp": "ANSWER: (C) SnakeREF: Jawetz Microbiology 24th Ed Ch. 13Diphtheria toxin is absorbed into the mucous membranes and causes destruction of epithelium and a superficial inflammatory response. The necrotic epithelium becomes embedded in exuding fibrin and red and white cells, so that a grayish \"pseudomembrane\" is formed--commonly over the tonsils, pharynx, or larynx. Any attempt to remove the pseudomembrane exposes and tears the capillaries and thus results in bleeding. The regional lymph nodes in the neck enlarge, and there may be marked edema of the entire neck. The diphtheria bacilli within the membrane continue to produce toxin actively. This is absorbed and results in distant toxic damage, particularly parenchymatous degeneration, fatty infiltration, and necrosis in heart muscle, liver, kidneys, and adrenals, sometimes accompanied by gross hemorrhage. The toxin also produces nerve damage, resulting often in paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, or extremities. The nerve damage resembles to actions of neurotoxic snakes (Cobra).",

Toxin production is optimal at 0.14mg/ml and is suppressed at 0.5 mg/mlThe toxigenicity of the Diptheria Bacillus depends on the presence in it of corynephages (tox+ i.e. toxigenic).Non toxigenic strains may be rendered toxigenic by infecting them with Beta phage or some other tox* phage.This is known as lysogenic conversion or phage conversion.Toxin inhibits the protein synthesis by inhibiting the polypeptide chain elongation.",
