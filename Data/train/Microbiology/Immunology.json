This technique has very wide applications in DNA analysis. Northern blotting: An analogous procedure for the analysis of RNA has been called northern blotting (as opposed to Southern blotting). Here the RNA mixture is separated by gel electrophoresis, blotted and identified using labelled DNA or RNA probes. Western blotting: A similar technique for the identification of proteins (antigens) is called immunoblotting (or, in conformity with other blotting techniques, western blotting). Here the protein antigen mixture is separated by SDS- PAGE (sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), blotted on to nitrocellulose strips and identified by radiolabeled or enzyme-labeled antibodies as probes.

The role of the host immune response in the causation of SSPE has been supported by several findings including the following: (1) progression of disease despite high levels of humoral antibody; (2) presence of a factor that blocks lymphocyte-mediated immunity to SSPE-measles virus in SSPE cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); (3) lysis of brain cells from SSPE patients by SSPE serum or CSF in the presence of complement (a similar mechanism could cause in vivo tissue injury). Higher-than-normal levels of serum antibodies (Ab) to measles virus and local synthesis of measles Ab in CSF, as evidenced by the oligoclonal IgG, imply a connection between the virus and multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the other studies have implicated the other viruses. Several studies of cell-mediated hypersensitivity to measles and other viruses in MS have been done, but the results have been conflicting. Definite conclusions regarding defects in cellular immunity in this disease cannot be reached until further research is completed.",

Note: Grave's disease is known as Type V hypersensitivity. Type I hypersensitivity. Anaphylaxis-acute, systemic, potentially fatal form. Atopy- chronic, localized, non fatal, familial form (Coca, 1923). Type I HS is mediated by IgE antibodies. Eg of subatances associated with Type I HS: Proteins-foreign serum & vaccines. Food-nuts, eggs, milk, seafood. Plant pollen. Drugs-penicillin, local anesthetics. Insect products- venom (bees, wasps, ants dust mites. Mold spores. Animal hair and dander. Type II hypersensitivity. Reactions involve combination of IgG or IgM antibodies to cell fixed antigens. Examples of type II reactions. Cell surface antigens. RBC- transfusion reactions, erythroblastosis fetalis, A. I. H. AWBC- neutropenia. PLATELETS-thrombocytopenia. Tissue antigens Goodpasture's syndrome Pemphigus. Type III hypersensitivity. Antibodies (usually IgA ) directed against soluble antigens. Examples of type III hypersensitivity. Arthus reaction- localized hemorrhagic necrosis following SC injection of antigen in sensitized rabbits. Serum sickness- systemic form appears 7-12 days after injection of foreign serum. Infection (microbial antigen)-kidneys- leptospirosis, malaria. Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Autoimmune diseases- (self antigen)- kidney, skin, joints. Inhaled antigens (molds, plant pollen)-lung (Farmer's lung). Type IV hypersensitivity. Also called delayed hypersensitivity because it takes 48-72 hours to develop. Involves TDTH cells (subset of TH cells). Cannot be passively transferred by serum.

They vary in size and may be as large as 50 pm in length. Charcot-Leyden crystals are slender and pointed at both ends, consisting of a pair of hexagonal pyramids joined at their bases. Normally colorless, they are stained purplish- red by trichrome. They are indicative of a disease involving eosinophilic inflammation or proliferation, such as is found in allergic reactions and parasitic infections. Charcot-Leyden crystals are often seen pathologically in patients with bronchial asthma. During most infections, eosinophils appear unimportant. However, in invasive helminthic infections, such as hookworm, schistosomiasis, strongyloidiasis, toxocariasis, trichinosis, filariasis, echinococcosis, and cysticercosis, the eosinophil plays a central role in host defense.

Type 1 hypersensitivity ( Immediate hypersensitivity)o It is a rapidly developing immunological reaction occuring within minutes after the combination of an antigen with antibody bound to mast cells in individuals previously sensitized to the antigen, o Immediate hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by Ig E, but T and B cells play important roles in the development of these antibodies. o Type I reaction requires prior sensitization to a specific antigen (allergen), o Most exposures occur either by inhalation (respiratory route) or ingestion (GIT) of antigen, o Type one hypersensitivity has two phases1. Initial response# After first antigen exposure, this antigen is presented to CD-4 helper T ceils (TH2 type) by antigen presenting cells. These primed TH, cells release IL-4 that acts on B-cells to form Ig E specific for that particular antigen. The antigen specific Ig E antibodies then bind to the surface receptors of mast cells and basophils. The process from first antigen exposure to the coating of mast cells by Ig E acts as sensitization (prior sensitization) and first exposure is also called priming or sensitizing exposure (dose). Subsequent exposure {shocking dose) to same antigen then result in activation of mast cells and basophils with release of mediator from these cells that leads to -o Smooth muscle spasmo Increase mucus secretion from the epithelial cells, o Vasodilatationo Increased vascular permeabilityo Recuritment of inflammatory cells. Note - Most of the clinical effects are due to smooth muscle spasm. 2) Late phase response. In this phase additional leukocytes are recruited. These cells amplify and sustain the inflammatory response without additional exposure to the triggered antigen. Among the cells that are recruited in the late-phase reaction, eosinophils are particularly important. Eosinophils produce major basic protein and eosinophilic eataionic protein that are toxic to epithelial cells. Platelet activating factor (PAF) recruits and activates inflammatory cells and is most important cytokine in the inititiation of late phase response. o Type I hypersensitivity occurs in two forms: j. Anaphvlaxis - Acute, potentially fatal, systemic. Atopy - Chronic, non-fataL localized. Remembero Mast cells are the most important cells in type I hypersensitivity. o Eosinophils are the most important cells in the late phase reaction of type l hypersensitivity. o Histamine is the most important mediator in type 1 hypersensitivity. o IL-4 is particularly important, it is essential for turning on IgE secreting B cells, o PAF is the most important cytokine in the initiation of late phase reaction, o Most potent eosinophilic activating cytokine is IL-5.",

Children are ill for a few days but recover without incident. Unfounately, if a pregnant female acquires the disease in the first trimester of pregnancy, the fetus is at risk. The causative agent is thought to be a parvovirus (parvovirus B 19). Adults with no titer to varicella (VZV) are at risk for acquisition of chickenpox.

If this produces agglutination of RBCs, the direct Coombs test is positive, a visual indication that antibodies (and/or complement proteins) are bound to the surface of red blood cells. The indirect Coombs test is used in prenatal testing of pregnant women and in testing blood prior to a blood transfusion. It detects antibodies against RBCs that are present unbound in the patient's serum. In this case, the rum is extracted from the blood sample taken from the patient. Then, the serum is incubated with RBCs of known antigenicity; that is, RBCs with known reference values from other patient blood samples.

Denaturation & TM of DNADefinition#\"The strands of a given molecule of DNA separate over a temperature range. The midpoint is called melting point (T J\" It is also defined as \"the temperature at which DNA Is half denatured# At this temperature, the absorbance of DNA at 260 nm is increased by 18. 5% i. e. half of 37% increased in absorbance when DNA is completely denatured. This phenomenon is called hyperchromicity or hyperchromic effect. Factors Affecting Tm. Tm depends on both the length of molecule & specific nucleotide sequence composition of that molecule. DNA rich in G-C pairs which have 3-H bond melts at higher temperature than that rich in A-T pairs, which have 2-H bond. A tenfold increase of monovalent cation concentration increase the Tm by 16. 6 deg. CFormamideQ which commonly used in recombinant DNA technology & urea, both of them destablise H-bonds & thus lower Tm. How' ionic concentration Affects Tm: The ion concentration also influence the Tm because the negatively charged PO4. in the two strands are shielded by positively charged ion. When ionic concentration is low this shielding is decreased, thus increasing the repulsive force b/w strands & reducing Tm. What is Annealing: Once the strands are separated they can be renatured. If the melted sample of DNA is slowly cooled the absorbance of the solution decreases. This is indicator of complementary strands being paired again. This process is called as annealing. Annealing can occur only at a temperature below Tm of DNA which is about 7. GdegC. It is fastest at 20degC below (Tm) or 50degC. Application of Tm pf DNA# Amount of G & C (Guanine & Cytosine) in a genome (called \"GC content\") can be estimated by measuring the temperature at which the genomic DNA melts.

Fusion of lysosome Chediak higashi syndromeo It is an autosomal recessive disorder. o Chediak hi gash i syndrome is caused due to mutation in the LYST gene. o This gene provides instructions for making a protien known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein plays a role in transport of materials into lysosomes. o Lysosomes contain several enzyme. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down several toxins. o During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterias. o Mutation in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot fuse with phagosome to form phagolysosome. Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation. o As a result, most people with chediak higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infectionsr starting in infancy or early childhood. These infections are life threatening, o Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory / storage granules of various other cells are also affected, o The other cells involved are -Melanosomes of melanocytes. Dense bodies of platelets. Granules of schwann cellso There are giant primary granules in neutrophils and other granules bearing cells. o In pigment cells called melanocytes the melanosome become abnormally large so there is reduced production of melanin. Thus people with chediak Higashi syndrome have occulocutaneous albinism i. e the colour of skin, hair and eye is reduced. o Abnormality' in platelets produce bleeding disorders. o Defective granules in schw ann cells lead to neurological symptoms e. g. peripheral neuropathy, o Most children with chediak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage of the disorder known as accelarated phase (lymphoma like stage). o This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection (E. B. virus). In the accelarated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs, o The accelarated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections and organ failure.

ADENOSINE DEAMINASE (ADA) DEFICIENCY: ADA is expressed in the cytosol of all cells, but, in humans, lymphocytes have the highest activity of this enzyme. A deficiency of ADA results in an accumulation of adenosine, which is converted to its ribonucleotide or deoxyribonucleotide forms by cellular kinases. As d. ATP levels rise, ribonucleotide reductase is inhibited, thus preventing the production of all deoxyribose-containing nucleotides. Consequently, cells cannot make DNA and divide. In its most severe form, this autosomal recessive disorder causes a type of severe combined immunodeficiency disease, involving a decrease in both T cells and B cells. It is estimated that in the United States, ADA deficiency accounts for approximately 14% of all cases of SCID. Treatment requires either bone marrow' replacement or enzyme replacement therapy.

See APPENDIX-19 for list of \"CYTOKINES\"Synthesis of Interferons. Interferons are produced by all vertebrate species. Normal cells do not generally synthesize interferon until they are induced to do so. Infection with viruses is a potent insult leading to induction; RNA viruses are stronger inducers of interferon than DNA viruses. Interferons also can be induced by double-stranded RNA, bacterial endotoxin, and small molecules such as tilorone. IFN-g is not produced in response to most viruses but is induced by mitogen stimulation. The different classes of interferon are produced by different cell types. IFN-a and IFN-b are synthesized by many cell types, but IFN-g is produced mainly by lymphocytes, especially T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Dendritic cells are potent interferon producers; under the same virus challenge conditions, dendritic cells can secrete up to l000x more interferon than fibroblasts. APPENDIX -19. Cytokines: Name.

Therefore they are unable to mount many types of adaptive immune responses, including antibody formation that requires CD4+ helper T cell; cell-mediated immune responses, which require CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells; delayed-type hypersensitivity responses (require CD4+ T cells); killing of virus-infected or malignant cells (requires CD8+ cytotoxic cells); graft rejection (requires both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) These mice possess a vestigial thymus which is incapable of producing mature T-cells as shown by a decreased lymphocyte population carrying the theta antigen and depleted &; thymus-dependent&; areas in their peripheral lympoid organs.

Hvbridomaso Hybridomas are cells that have been engineered to produce a specific antibody in huge numberso To achieve this, qualities of two types of cells have to be combined together Le. Cells which can produce large amount of pure antibody, and. Cells which have the ability to grow- continually. o These two types of cells are then fused together to form hybridoma. Procedureo The pure antibody secreting cells are produced by injecting specific antigen in a mouse and obtaining the antigen specific plasma cells (antibody producing cell) from the mouse's spleen, o Ceil which can grow indefinitely in culture are myeloma cells (cancerous cells). o These two cell lines are fused together. The hybrid cell which is thus produced can be cloned to produce large number of identical daughter clones. o These daughter clone cells then produce antibodies. Since these antibodies come from only one type of cell {hybridoma cell) they are called monoclonal antibodies. o HAT (hypoxanthine, Aminopterin and thymidine) medium is used for preparation of monoclonal antibodies because it allows only fused hybridoma cells to grow. It does not allow the unfused myeloma and unfused antibody cells to grow. So HAT medium is a selective medium which allows (which allow selective growth offused hybridoma). How does this happen? o Before we move on with the discussion, remember these few points about purine synthesis. o Purine synthesis is essential for the survival of cells. Purine can be synthesized in two way i. e. De novo synthesis (dihydrofolate reductase enzyme is required for this pathway). Salvage pathway (an enzyme hypoxanthine - guanine phosphoribosyl transferase is required for salvage pathways)o Myeloma cells lack HGPRTase enzyme therefore they cannot synthesize purine by salvage pathways, o Antibody cells have HGPRTase enzyme so they can use the salvage pathways, o Aminopterin inhibits dihydrofolate reductase an enzyme used in denovo synthesis of purineo When two cell lines i. e. antibody producing cell and myeloma cells are grown in HAT medium only the fused hybridoma cells survive. Myeloma cells die because they lack the enzyme HGPRTase so they cannot use the salvage pathways for purine synthesis. They also cannot use de-novo pathway, because Aminopterin present in the HAT medium inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (an enzyme essential for denovo synthesis ofpurine). o The unfused antibody producing cells die as they cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span, o Only fused hybridoma cells grow indefinitely because the antibody cell partner supplies HGPRTase and the myeloma partner gives it immortality, (as it is a cancer cell)",

In the heterophil-negative cases and for atypical infections, determination of specific antibodies to EBV are useful in establishing the diagnosis. The development of IgM antibodies to the viral capsid antigen (EBV-VCA Ab) can be used for specific diagnosis of a current or recent infection. They arise early in the disease and persist for only 4 to 8 weeks On the other hand, many adults have been exposed to EBV and maintain a low level of IgG in response to this virus. A titer of greater than 1: 640 is usually diagnostic Antibodies to the early antigen of EBV (EA-EBV) show two distinct patterns of fluorescence-diffuse staining of both nuclei and cytoplasm (anti-D) and staining of cytoplasmic aggregates (anti-R). Anti-D titers appear 3 to 4 weeks after onset and are present in 70% of EBV-induced mononucleosis. Titers correlate with the severity of clinical illness and disappear after recovery. Anti-R titers appear two weeks to several months after onset and are rarely seen in cases of infectious mononucleosis. They are detectable in atypical cases and remain so for up to two years Antibodies to the nuclear antigen of EBV (EBNA-Ab) appear three to four weeks after onset and persist for life. They are useful in assessing recent infection if patients are VCA-positive, EBNA-negative, and then become EBNA-positive.

However, if too many antibodies are present that can bind to the antigen, then the antigenic sites are coated by antibodies, and few or no antibodies directed toward the pathogen are able to bind more than one antigenic paicle. Since the antibodies do not bridge between antigens, no agglutination occurs. Because no agglutination occurs, the test is interpreted as negative. In this case, the result is a false negative. The range of relatively high antibody concentrations within which no reaction occurs is called the prozone. Examples include high levels of syphilis antibodies in HIV patients or high levels of cryptococcal antigen leading to false negative tests in undiluted samples.

Taq polymerase) from a bacterium ('thermus aquations') that normally lives at high temperature, the polymerase is not denatured & therefore, does not have to added at each successive cycle\"- Lippintcott. Biochemistry 4th/482. Polymerase Chain Reaction. PCR provides a sensitive, selective & extremely rapid means of amplifying a desired sequence of DNA. Twenty cycles provide an amplificationQ of 106 & 30 cycles of 109 - Harper 27th/410-11. SpecificityQ is based on the use of two oligonucleotide primers that hybridize to complementary sequence on opposite strands of DNA & flank the target sequence. Double stranded DNA can be disrupted by heat or high pH, giving rise to single stranded DNA. The single stranded DNAQ serves as a template for synthesis of a complementary strand by replicating enzymes, the DNA polymerase. Early PCR reaction usedanE. coli DNA polymerase that was destroyed by each heat denaturation cycle. Substitution of a heat-stable DNA polymerase (Taq polymerase) from Thermus aquaticus, obviates this problem & has made possible automation of the reaction, since the polymerase reactions can be run at 70deg. CPCR is a cyclic process & cycle contains three steps that involves (Chatterjea & Shinde). DenaturationQ of DNA duplex (94-98degC). AnnealingQ of primers (37-60degC). ExtensionQ of the primers with a polymerase in the presence of d. NTP (about 720C)DNA polymerase amplifies DNA in PCR, Early PCR used an E coli, DNA polymerase that was destroyed by each heat generation cycles i. e. polymerase was denatured. This difficulty is solved by using heats table DNA polymerase from 'thermusaquaticuS'\". which can withstand 70deg to 80deg C. Therefore polymerase has not to be added in each cycle.",

Its primary use in microbiology has been for assays of aminoglycoside antibiotics. EIAs vary as to the solid support used. A variety of supports can be used, such as polystyrene microdilution plates, paddles, plastic beads, and tubes. The number of layers in the antibody-antigen sandwich varies; usually as additional layers are added, detection sensitivity is increased. The two most common enzymes are horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP). b-Galactosidase has also been employed. O-phenylenediamine is the most common substrate for HRP and b-nitrophenyl phosphate for AP.
