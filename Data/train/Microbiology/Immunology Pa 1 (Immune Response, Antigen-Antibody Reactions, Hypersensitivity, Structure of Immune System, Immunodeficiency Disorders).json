The constant region of the heavy chain has many biological functions. It is responsible for activation of the complement, binding to cell surface receptors, placental transfer, and many other biological activities. The amino-terminal half of the light or heavy chain, consisting amino acids, is known as variable or V regions (VL in light chains and VH in heavy chains). These antigen-binding sites are responsible for specific binding of antibodies with antigens. The high specificity of antibodies is primarily due to the presence of these hypervariable regions.",

IgM is not transpoed across the placenta; hence, the presence of IgM in the fetus or newborn indicates intrauterine infection. The first immunoglobulin produced in response to an antigen is IgM. after 3 monts of bih class switching is staed and then other class of immunoglobulins are synthesised. IgM is secreted as a pentamer and is composed of five H2. L2 units (similar to one IgG unit) and one moleculeof a J chain.. It is the most efficient Because its interaction with antigen can involve all 10 binding sites, it has the highest binding capacity and cross-linking of all the immunoglobulins. Option 2 IgG is the only immunoglobulin class to cross the placenta and therefore is the most abundant immunoglobulinin newborns. ( this is not the the first to be synthesised in newborn)",
