Given intravenously as micelles of sodium deoxycholate dissolved in dextrose solution, the drug is widely distributed in tissues. It does not penetrate well to the cerebrospinal fluid. Once attached to the fungal membrane, an amphotericin pore is introduced. Small molecules and ions are lost, eventually resulting in cell death. Mammalian cells are relatively resistant to amphotericin because it binds weakly to the cholesterol in mammalian cell membranes.Amphotericin B is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent with activity against coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, sporotrichosis, cryptococcosis, mucormycosis, and candidiasis.Amphotericin B does not work by any of the other four antimicrobial mechanisms of action.",
