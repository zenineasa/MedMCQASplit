Presence of multiple ulcers in the leg, along the lymphatic channels, in a farmer (outdoor worker) from the sub-himalayan region suggests the diagnosis of Sporotrichosis, caused by Sporothrix schenkii. Sporotrichosis. Sporotrichosis is a subacute or chronic granulomatous mycotic infection involving primarily the skin and subcutaneous tissue with neighboring lymphatics. Subcutaneous mycosis, caused by Sporothrix schenkii (dimorphic fungi)Q, colonies are blackish (variation in pigmentation) and shiny but becomes wrinkled and fuzzy with age. Epidemiology: Sporotrichosis is worldwide in distribution, but more common among people living in temperate and subtropical regions with high humidityQ. In India, Sporotrichosis is known to be endemic in the sub-himalayan regionsQ, ranging from Himachal Pradesh in the north-west to Assam and West Bengal in the East. Sporotrichosis most commonly infects persons involved in outdoor activity such as landscaping, gardening, farming, nursery workers and green house workersQ. Sporotrichosis is the most frequently encountered subcutaneous mycosis in the sub-himalayan beltQ. Source of Infection: Acquired from thorn pricksQ of rose, sphagnum moss, etc. into subcutaneous tissue through minor trauma. Clinical features: Most cases occur in upper limbQ, usual site of infection is extremityQ (facial lesion in case of children) A papule or nodule develops at the site of inoculation after days or weeks. The papule or nodule the softens and breaks down forming an indolent ulcer. Sporotrichosis is characterized by an asymptomatic nodule, which over a period of time becomes ulcerated nodules, lesions are usually arranged In 'linear fashion' along the lymphatic drainageQ. Pulmonary Sporotrichosis, extra-cutaneous Sporotrichosis, is usually present as single chronic cavitary upper lobe lesion, portal is probably lung. Diagnosis: Culture (most reliable)Q of pus, joint fluid, sputum or skin biopsy in which septate hyphae carrying flower like cluster of small conidia is seen. In tissues, fungus is seen as 'cigar shaped yeast'Q (yeast cell without mycelia) Sometimes 'Asteroid bodies'Q can be seen which is formed due to antigen-antibody reaction.

Once attached to the fungal membrane, an amphotericin pore is introduced. Small molecules and ions are lost, eventually resulting in cell death. Mammalian cells are relatively resistant to amphotericin because it binds weakly to the cholesterol in mammalian cell membranes. Amphotericin B is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent with activity against coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, sporotrichosis, cryptococcosis, mucormycosis, and candidiasis.

Forms and symptoms of sporotrichosis: Cutaneous (skin) sporotrichosis. This is the most common form of this disease. Symptoms of this form includes nodular lesions or bumps in the skin, at the point of entry and also along lymph nodes and vessels. The lesion starts off as small and painless, nodule and ranges in colour from pink to purple. Left untreated, the lesion becomes larger and looks similar to a boil and more lesions will appear, until a chroniculcer develops. Usually cutaneous sporotrichosis lesions occurs in the finger, hand and arm. Pulmonary sporotrichosis. This rare form of the disease occur when S. schenckii spores are inhaled. Symptoms include productive cough, nodules, cavitations and fibrosis of lungs; and hilar lymph node enlargement. Patients with this form of sporotrichosis are susceptible to developing tuberculosis and pneumonia. Disseminated sporotrichosis. When the infection spreads from the primary site to secondary sites in the body, the disease develops into a rare and critical form called disseminated sporotrichosis. The infection can spread to joints and bones (called osteoarticular sporotrichosis) as well as the CNS and brain (sporotrichosis meningitis).",

Phycomycetes:# A large, important class of parasitic or saprophytic fungi, the algal or algalike fungi.# The plant body ranges from an undifferentiated mass of protoplasm to a well-developed and much-branched mycelium.# Reproduction is mainly sexual, by the formation of conidia or sporangia; but the group shows every form of transition from this method through simple conjugation to perfect sexual reproduction by egg and sperm in the higher forms. Fungi imperfectii (genera Penicillium and Aspergillus):# A heterogenous phylum of fungi which lack a sexual phase, or of which the sexual phase is not known. Some undoubtedly represent the conidium stages of various Ascomycetes. It is not considered a natural phylum, and is also called the Deuteromycota. The group is divided into the orders Sphaeropsidales, Melanconiales, and Moniliales. They reproduce asexually by means of conidia. Zygomycetes:# Fast growing, terrestrial, largely saprobic fungi with non motile cells; cosmopolitan (665 species).# Hyphae coenocytic and mostly aseptate.# Asexual spores include chlamydoconidia, conidia and sporangiospores contained in sporangia borne on simple or branched sporangiophores. Sexual reproduction is isogamous producing a thick-walled sexual resting spore called a zygospore.

These include alterations in the drug target by mutation or overexpression, drug efflux pumps, changes in ergosterol or sterol content, and changes in uptake and metabolism. Alteration of the drug either through modification or degradation to inactive moieties has not been reported. Resistance to tolnaftate and allylamines that inhibit squalene epoxidase is not common but likely mechanisms include efflux pumps, mutation or overexpression of the enzyme and nonspecific stress adaptation. Resistance to flucytosine may occur via alteration of the permease that reduces entry into the fungal cell or at enzymatic steps, cytosine deaminase or uracil phosphoribosyl transferase, involved in metabolism of the drug to the active compounds. Resistance to azole class drugs may develop through expression of drug efflux pumps and alteration or over-expression of the drug target. In some resistant isolates, more than one mechanism may be operative. Resistance to polyenes may reflect a decrease in ergosterol content of the membrane or production of other non-polyene binding sterols.

Person is infective once microfilaria presents in the peripheral blood.* The inflammatory phase is characterised by Lymphangitis, lymphadenitis and adenolymphangitis.* It lasts for a few days, then subsides spontaneously & recurs at irregular intervals for a period of weeks to months.* These circulating microfilariae can be taken up with a blood meal by the arthropod vector; in the vector, they develop into infective larvae that can be transmitted to a new host.* Filariasis is diagnosed in microfilaraemic cases primarily through direct observation of microfilariae in the peripheral blood.* Remember: W. bancrofti is nocturnally periodic i. e. micro filariae are scarce in peripheral blood by day and increase at night.",

Forms and symptoms of sporotrichosis: Cutaneous (skin) sporotrichosis. This is the most common form of this disease. Symptoms of this form includes nodular lesions or bumps in the skin, at the point of entry and also along lymph nodes and vessels. The lesion starts off as small and painless, nodule and ranges in colour from pink to purple. Left untreated, the lesion becomes larger and looks similar to a boil and more lesions will appear, until a chroniculcer develops. Usually cutaneous sporotrichosis lesions occurs in the finger, hand and arm. Pulmonary sporotrichosis. This rare form of the disease occur when S. schenckii spores are inhaled. Symptoms include productive cough, nodules, cavitations and fibrosis of lungs; and hilar lymph node enlargement. Patients with this form of sporotrichosis are susceptible to developing tuberculosis and pneumonia. Disseminated sporotrichosis. When the infection spreads from the primary site to secondary sites in the body, the disease develops into a rare and critical form called disseminated sporotrichosis.

Antibody (Immunoglobulin)* Immunoglobulins are molecles that are produced by plasma cells in response to an immunogen.* Immunoglobulins are glycoproteins* Each immunoglobulin is composed of two light chains (L) and two heavy chains H.* The L chain has a molecular weight of 25000, and the H. chain of 50000.* The L chain is attached to H. chain by disulphide bond.* The two H chains are joined together by disulphide bonds.* Immunoglobulin isotype (ie. G, M, A, D, E) is determined by the type of Ig heavy chain present.* Hinge point is the point at which heavy and light chains join. This point can be digested by papain digestion, to produce one Fc fragment and two Fab fragments: Immunoglobulin classH. chain. Ig. Gg (gamma). Ig. Aa (alpha). Ig. Mm (mu). Ig. Dd (delta). Ig. Ee (epsilon)* The isotype variation or class of antibody is due to variation in the amino acid sequence in the constant region of the heavy chain. Because there are five potential variation in the aminoacid sequence in the constant region there are five classes of antibody i. e. IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, IgE.* These H chain differences are called isotypes and are designated by the greek letters gamma (g), alpha (a) mu (m), epsilon (e) and delta (d) respectively.* The L chains are similar in all classes of immunoglobulins either kappa or lambda (kappa being more common).* Antigen combining site is at amino-terminus and is composed by both L and H chains.* Both H and L chains consist of two units; constant and variable: H chain - One variable (VH) and three or four constant units (CH)L chain - One variable (VL ) and one constant (C2) unit.* The variable region is further subdivided into hypervariable region and frame work region.* Hypervariable regions at aminoterminal are involved in formation of antigen binding sites.* L chain has three hypervariable regions and H chain has four. Hypervariable regions are also called as 'Hot spots'.* Sites on the hypervariable regions which make actual contact with the epitopes are called complementarity determining regions (CDRs). CDR, i. e. antigen binding site is also called idiotype.* The infinite range of the antibody specificity of immunoglobulins depends on the variability of the aminoacid sequences at the variable units of H and L chains.* Fc fragment is composed of the carboxyterminal. It determines the biological activity such as complement fixation, placental transfer, skin fixation and catabolic rate.* CH 2 of Ig G and CH4 of IgM bind to C1q portion of C1.",

Microsporum species: Infect skin and hair. Epidermophyton species: Infect skin and nail. Depending on habitat, they are classified as follows: Anthropophilic: These fungal species exclusively affect humans. Zoophilic: They infect animals and birds. Geophilic: These fungal species are isolated from soil. Pathogenesis: Fungal spores are acquired by direct contact with soil, animals, humans infected. In skin, they grow in centrifugal pattern in the stratum comeum forming characteristic annular or ring shaped pruritic lesions. They invade hair shaft from within or from outside leading to alopecia: In nails, they invade through lateral or superficial nail plates. Clinical types of dermatophytoses: Clinical types. Area involved. Tinea capitis (scalp infection): Scaly patches on scalp with broken hair. It is of following types: 1. Kerion. Painful inflammatory reaction producing boggy lesions.

Sporotrichosis. Sporotrichosis is caused by the thermally dimorphic fungus Sporothrix schenckii. Because Schenckii is naturally found in soil, hay, sphagnum moss, and plants, it usually affects farmers, gardeners, and agricultural workers. This fungal disease usually affects the skin although rare forms can affect the lungs, joints, bones, and CNS. Fungus enters through small cuts and abrasions in the skin to cause the infection. Because roses can spread the disease, it is one of a few diseases referred to as rose-thorn or rose gardener's disease. Forms and symptoms of Sporotrichosis. Cutaneous (skin) Sporotrichosis. This is the most common form of this disease. Symptoms of this form includes nodular lesions or bumps in the skin, at the point of entry and also along lymph nodes and vessels. The lesion starts off as small and painless, nodule and ranges in colour from pink to purple. Left untreated, the lesion becomes larger and look similar to a boil and more lesions will appear, until a chronic ulcer develops. Usually cutaneous Sporotrichosis lesions occur in the finger, hand and arm. Pulmonary Sporotrichosis. This rare form of the disease occur when S. schenckii spores are inhaled. Symptoms include productive cough, nodules, capitations and fibrosis of lungs; and hilar lymph node enlargement. Patients with this form of Sporotrichosis are susceptible to developing tuberculosis and pneumonia. Disseminated Sporotrichosis. When the infection spreads from the primary site to secondary sites in the body, the disease develops into a rare and critical form called disseminated Sporotrichosis. The infection can spread to joints and bones (called osteoarticular Sporotrichosis) as well as the CNS and brain (Sporotrichosis meningitis). About other options Cladosporium. Cladosporium genus of fungi includes some of the most common indoor and outdoor molds. Many species of Cladosporium are commonly found on living and dead plant material. Some species are plant pathogens, others parasitize other fungi.

        "exp": "The presence of hyaline hyphae supports a diagnosis of a dermatophyte infection (see the table below). Dermatophyte infections may be exacerbated by the use of topical steroids. With such exposure the infection may not give the typical picture and may be called tinea incognito. This infection started in the groin region where such infections are known as tinea cruris or jock itch. Dermatophytes are identified in culture by the macroscopic morphology of the colony and the microscopic morphology of asexual production of conidia. Both macroconidia and microconidia may be produced but one is more abundant and used in identification while the other is rare. Trichophyton species produce numerous microconidia whose appearance and location are useful in their identification. Microsporum species (except M. audouinii) produce macroconidia that are borne singly and that have distinctive shapes and rough walls. Epidermophytonfloccosum produces only macroconidia. These are usually produced in clusters and have a distinctive clavate shape sometimes described as \"beaver-tail\". The schematic shows clavate macroconidia with this shape, which is consistent with E. floccosum. SELECTED ANTIFUNGAL DRUGS, MODE OF ACTION AND MECHANISMS OF RESISTANCEAntifungal Agent. Route.

Krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. dubliniensis, C. kejyr, and C. viswanathii. Predisposing factors that are associated with increased risk of infection with Candida include-* Physiological state: Extremes of age (infancy, old age), pregnancy* Low immunity: Patients on steroid or immunosuppressive drugs, post transplantation, malignancy, HIV* Patients on broad spectrum antibiotics suppresses the normal flora* Diabetes mellitus, febrile neutropenia and zinc or iron deficiency. Clinical Manifestations. Candida species are a part of normal flora of the skin and mucosa including gut flora. In presence of opportunistic conditions, they can cause various infections. 1. Mucosal candidiasis:* Oropharyngeal candidiasis (oral thrush) presents as white, adherent, painless patches in the mouth* Candidal vulvovaginitis thin whitish curd like vaginal discharge* Balanitis and balanoposthitis (occurring in uncircumcised males)* Esophageal candidiasis* Angular stomatitis and denture stomatitis* Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis: Seen in infants with deficient CMI, resistant to treatment. 2. Cutaneous candidiasis:* Intertrigo, Paronychia and onychomycosis (fungal infection of nail)* Diaper candidiasis in infants, Perianal candidiasis* Erosio interdigitalis blastomycetica, an infection between the digits of the hands or toes* Generalized disseminated cutaneous candidiasis, seen in infants. 3. Invasive candidiasis: Results from hematogenous or local spread of the fungi. Various forms are:* UTI, Pulmonary candidiasis, meningitis, osteomyelitis and Hepatosplenic and disseminated candidiasis* Septicemia (C. albicans and C. glabrate).* Ocular: Keratoconjunctivitis and endophthalmitis* Nosocomial candidiasis (mainly by C. glabrata)4. Allergic candidiasis include:* Candida Vesicular lesions in the web space of hands, similar to that of dermatophytid reaction (both conditions are together called 7D' reaction)* Other allergic reactions include: Gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome and eczema. Laboratory Diagnosis* Direct microscopy: Gram-positive oval budding yeast cells (4-6 pm size) with pseudohyphae.* Culture on SDA: Colonies are described as creamy white, smooth, and pasty with typical yeasty odor. Tests for species identification:* Germ tube test: It is also called Reynolds Braude phenomenon, specific test for C. albicans.* It is differentiated from pseudohyphae as there is no constriction at the origin.* Though the test is specific for C. albicans, it may also be positive for C. dubliniensis.

A. fumigatus (most common species) infections are primary pulmonary infections that may be a rapidly necrotizing pneumonia with a potential to disseminate. The organism is a mold in the environment and in the host. The hyphae are septate with acute angle, dichotomous, branching. Candida infections generally start as candidemia, which may reach the blood stream by catheters or translocation from the gut. C. albicans is the most frequent Candida isolate. This component of normal flora is generally in the yeast form as a commensal and when infection occurs the additional presence of hyphae and pseudo-hyphae is observed.

In immunocompromised patients, the conidia may germinate to produce hyphae that invade the lungs and other tissues. Progress of disease can be rapid. A diagnosis of aspergillosis is supported by a tissue biopsy showing invasion by the organism and a positive culture from a normally sterile site. Aspergilli may be airborne in the environment and be laboratory culture contaminants or present in orally obtained samples from patients without apparent clinical illness and at low risk for invasive aspergillosis and such finding should be interpreted with caution. In tissue Aspergillus spp. (most commonly A. fumigatus) have septate hyphae 3 to 6 mm in width that are described as having acute angle branching. In bone marrow transplant patient's infection may occur early after transplant or after several months as in this case. The other infections can occur in a compromised host but would differ from what is shown. Particularly, the septate hyphae and acute angle branching are not consistent with agents of mucormycosis that have wide non-septate hyphae.
