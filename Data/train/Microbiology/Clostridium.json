Treatment:# Neither the use of antibiotics to eliminate an intestinal source for possible continued toxin production nor the administration of guanidine hydrochloride and other drugs to reverse paralysis is of proven value.# After testing for hypersensitivity to horse serum, antitoxin is given# Rx of infant botulism requires supportive care and administration of human botulism immune globulin.# A pentavalent vaccine (A-E) is available for use in highly exposed individuals.

Food-borne botulism is caused by consumption of foods contaminated with botulinum toxin, which is a metabolic waste produced under anaerobic condition by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Most botubsm cases are sporadic; outbreaks are typically small, involving two or three cases. The wide variation in reported rates of botulism by region and continent probably reflects differences both in true incidence and in diagnostic and reporting capacity.

It is often, but not always, caused by the bacterium Clostridium difficile. The illness is characterized by offensivesmelling diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. In severe cases, life-threatening complications can develop, such as toxic megacolon. Pseudomembranous colitis is due infection by Clostridium difficleA gram-positive anaerobic bacillus. Not identified until 1953 because it was 'difficult' to culture. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are main culprits. Although many antibiotics have been associated with pseudomembraneous colitis, the most common are ampicillin and clindamycin. Allows colonisation by C. difficle transmitted by the faecal-oral route. Exotoxins (Toxin A & B) produced by bacteria. Toxin A is a potent enterotoxin while Toxin B is a potent cytotoxin, Pseudomembraneous colitis is diagnosed by detection of one or both C difficile toxins in stool and by endoscopic observation of pseudomembraneous or microabscesses in patients who have diarrhea and have been given antibiotics. Produces mucosal inflammation and cell damage. If severe epithelial necrosis a pseudo-membrane is formed. Consists of mucin, fibrin, leucocytes and cellular debris. The disease is treated by discontinuing administration of the offending antibiotic and orally giving either metronidazole or vancomycin. ANTIBIOTIC-ASSOCIATED DIARRHEA: The administration of antibiotics frequently leads to a mild to moderate form of diarrhea, termed antibiotic- associated diarrhea. This disease is generally less severe than the classic form of pseudomembraneouscolitis. As many as 25% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea may be associated with C difficile.",
