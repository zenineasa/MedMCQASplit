        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Agglutination test Precipitationo When a soluble antigen combines with its antibody in the presence of electrolytes (Na. CI) at a suitable temperature and pH, the antigen - antibody complex forms an insoluble precipitate, o When instead of sedimenting, the precipitate remains suspended as floccules, the reaction is knowm as flocculation. o It is very sensitive in detection of antigens and as little as 1 g of protein can be detected by precipitation tests, o Precipitation is relatively less sensitive for the detection of antibodies.

This is possible only in the zone of equivalence. o In the zone of antigen or antibody excess, the lattice does not enlarge, as the valencies of the antibody and the antigen, repectively are fully satisfied. In either cases extensive lattice cannot be formed and precipition is inhibitedo The lattice hypothesis holds good for agglutination also.",
