Although most infections by human papillomavirus are benign, some undergo malignant transformation into in situ and invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Both HPV and polyomavirus have icosahedral capsids and DNA genomes. JC virus, a polyomavirus, was first isolated from the diseased brain of a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma who was dying of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). This demyelinating disease occurs usually in immunosuppressed persons and is the result of oligodendrocyte infection by JC virus. JC virus has also been isolated from the urine of patients suffering from demyelinating disease. Cryotherapy and laser treatment are the most popular therapies for warts, although surgery may be indicated in some cases. At the present time, there is no effective antiviral therapy for treatment of infection with polyomavirus or HPV West Nile virus is an arbovirus. While prevalent in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, it was not seen in the United States until the summer of 1999. It is transmitted by mosquitoes and birds, especially crows; these animals are a reservoir. WNV causes a rather mild encephalitis in humans, the exception being older patients or those who may be immunocompromised.",

Facts about HIV infection (Jawetz): The typical course of \"untreated HIV\" infection spans around a decade (10 years) Following infection the period of clinical latency may last long as 10 years. The duration between primary infection infection and progression to clinical disease averages about 10 years. In untreated cases, death usually occurs within 2 years after the onset of clinical symptoms. Following primary infection, there is a 4- to 11- day period between mucosal infection and initial viremia. (The viremia is detectable for about 8-12 weeks) An acute mononucleosis-like sydrome develops in many patients (50-75%) 3-6 weeks after primary infection (There is significant drop in numbers of circulating CD4 T cells at this early time) An immune response to HIV occurs 1 week to 3 months after infection, plasma viremia drops, and levels of CD4 cells rebound. The t 1/2 (half-life) of virus in plasma is about 6 hours. The virus Life-cycle from the time of infectionn of a cell to the production of new progeny that infect the next cell averages 2. 6 days. CD4 lymphocytes are the major target responsible for virus production and once productively infected the half-life of a CD4 cell is about 1. 6 days.

They cause acute respiratory tract infections that usually occur in epidemics. Isolated strains of influenza virus are named after the virus type (influenza A, B, or C) as well as the host and location of initial isolation, the year of isolation, and the antigenic designation of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are glycoproteins under separate genetic control, and because of this they can and do vary independently. The changes in these antigens are responsible for the antigenic drift characteristic of these viruses. The paramyxoviruses include several important human pathogens (mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus). Both paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses possess an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is a structural component of the virion and produces the initial RNA. Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) are not related to the paramyxoviruses. They are 150-nm single-stranded RNA viruses. There are 2 antigen groups, A and B, which play no role in diagnosis and treatment. While the overall mortality is 0. 5%, at-risk groups may be 25 to 35% mortality if untreated. Some parainfluenza virus infections (type 3) may be indistinguishable from RSV, but most parainfluenza infections produce a laryngotracheobronchitis known as croup.",

Clinical manifestations* Most of the infections in immunocompetent persons are asymptomatic.* Clinical features are divided intoA) Congenital infection# Infection is acquired in pregnancy.# It causes cytomegalic inclusion disease. Most common presentation is petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly and jaundice. Other features are microcephaly, cerebral calcification, chorioretinitis, IUGR, prematurity and thrombocytopenia. B) Perinatal infection# Infection is acquired during delivery or postnatally by breast feeding. Most patients are asymptomatic. C) Beyond neonatal period# Most common presentation is heterophile antibody-negative mononucleosis (CMV mononucleosis). D) Immunocompromized host# It causes retinitis, colitis, gastritis, esophagitis, pneumonitis, fever, leukopenia and hepatitis.# Maximum risk of infection after kidney transplant is between 1-4 months after transplantation. Most common presentation is fever, leukopenia and hepatosplenomegaly.# Most common presentation after bone marrow transplantation is interstitial pneumonia. Laboratory diagnosis* Definitive diagnostic test (most specific test) is isolation of virus from urine, saliva, blood or bronchoalveolar washing.* Most sensitive test is PCRfor viral genome (DNA) detection in blood or intraocular fluid (in CMV retinitis).* Serology (IgM or IgG) is not very useful. Treatment* Ganciclovir or valganciclovir are drugs of choice. Foscarnet is used for CMV retinitis.",

They cause acute respiratory tract infections that usually occur in epidemics. Isolated strains of influenza virus are named after the virus type (influenza A, B, or C) as well as the host and location of initial isolation, the year of isolation, and the antigenic designation of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are glycoproteins under separate genetic control, and because of this they can and do vary independently. The changes in these antigens are responsible for the antigenic drift characteristic of these viruses. The paramyxoviruses include several important human pathogens (mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus). Both paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses possess an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is a structural component of the virion and produces the initial RNA. Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) are not related to the paramyxoviruses. They are 150-nm single-stranded RNA viruses. There are 2 antigen groups, A and B, which play no role in diagnosis and treatment. While the overall mortality is 0. 5%, at-risk groups may be 25 to 35% mortality if untreated.

They cause acute respiratory tract infections that usually occur in epidemics. Isolated strains of influenza virus are named after the virus type (influenza A, B, or C) as well as the host and location of initial isolation, the year of isolation, and the antigenic designation of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are glycoproteins under separate genetic control, and because of this they can and do vary independently. The changes in these antigens are responsible for the antigenic drift characteristic of these viruses. The paramyxoviruses include several important human pathogens (mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus). Both paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses possess an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is a structural component of the virion and produces the initial RNA. Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) are not related to the paramyxoviruses. They are 150-nm single-stranded RNA viruses. There are 2 antigen groups, A and B, which play no role in diagnosis and treatment. While the overall mortality is 0. 5%, at-risk groups may be 25 to 35% mortality if untreated. Some parainfluenza virus infections (type 3) may be indistinguishable from RSV, but most parainfluenza infections produce a laryngotracheobronchitis known as croup.",

The DNA of some of its members (e. g., herpes simplex viruses) can undergo genetic rearrangement, which results in four different genomic isomers. In an isomer, there is the same molecular formula but different arrangement. The DNA of herpesviruses is large (molecular weight = 90-150 x 106), encoding at least 100 proteins. There is little sequence homology in the DNA among the various members of the family (30% to 50%), Except between herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and between human herpes 6 and 7. Morphologically, however, they are indistinguishable. The nucleocapsid of herpesviruses has icosahedral symmetry. The lipid envelope, which is derived from the nuclear membrane of the infected cell during budding, contains viral glycoproteins. The area between the capsid and the envelope is the tegument, and it contains several viral proteins. Poxviruses have double-stranded, linear DNA.

Only one serotype of EBV has been recognized, although molecular methods have reorganized a number of genotypes of EBV. Infectious mononucleosis is an acute disease most commonly seen in younger people. It is characterized by a proliferation of lymphocytes, lymph node enlargement, pharyngitis, fatigue, and fever. Infection in young children is usually either asymptomatic or characteristic of an acute upper respiratory infection. Diagnosis is usually made by a positive heterophil test. Heterophil antibodies are those that occur in one species (human) and react with antigens of a different species. The heterophil test may be insensitive (30 to 60%) in children. Definitive diagnosis is made by detection of antibodies to EBV components. EBV causes a variety of other syndromes including Burkitt's lymphoma, the most common childhood cancer in Africa, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, commonly seen in China. Similar mononucleosis-like diseases are caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite. CMV causes fewer than 10% of infectious mononucleosis-like diseases. CMV \"mono\" is primarily characterized by fatigue. Congenital infection with CMV almost always causes serious sequelae, such as retardation and hearing loss. T. gondii also causes a variety of clinical problems, among them encephalitis in AIDS patients and food poisoning from the ingestion of raw meat. Although CMV and T. gondii are relatively rare causes of infectious mononucleosis, they must be ruled out, particularly when EBV tests are nonreactive.",

RNA) - Defective RNA. o It has no independent existence and can survive and replicate only as long as HBV infection persists in the host, o It resembles some plant viruses, such as viroids or satellite viruses. o It has been classified in genus Delta virus. o Delta core of HDV is encapsidated by an outer envelope of HBs Ag, so it require cooperative function of HBV. o Intracellular replication of HDV RNA can occur without HBV but liver injury requires the presence of HBV. o HDV can cause two types of infection. HDV infection. Superinfectiono In patient already infected with HBVo Has grave course with more chances of fulminant hepatitis and chronic infectiono Ig M anti HDV (+)ve and Ig M anti HBc (+)ve. Coinfectiono Infection occurs simultaneously with HBVo Comparatively mild course. o Ig M anti HDV (+)ve and ig G anti HBc (+)veo There is no association between HDV and hepatocellular carcinoma. o HDV antigen (Delta antigen) is primarily expressed in liver cell nuclei, where it can be demonstrated by immunofluorescence.",

        "exp": "Ans. d (Tat) (Ref. H-17th/114l; Figure 182-5). HIV Genome - Like other retroviruses, HIV-1 has genes that encode the structural proteins of the virus:# gog encodes the proteins that form the core of the virion (including p24 antigen);# pol encodes enzymes responsible for protease processing of viral proteins, reverse transcription, & integration;# env encodes the envelope glycoproteins. HIV-1 is more complex than other retroviruses, in that it also contains at least six other genes (tat, rev, nef vif vpr, and vpu), which code for proteins involved in the modification of the host cell to enhance virus growth and the regulation of viral gene expression. Several of these proteins are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV disease. Flanking these genes are the long terminal repeats (LTRs), which contain regulatory elements involved in gene expression. The major difference between the genomes of HIV-1 and HIV-2 is the fact that HIV-2 lacks the vpu gene and has a vpx gene not contained in HIV-1. LTR: Long terminal repeat# Contains control regions that bind host transcription factors (NF-kB, NFAT, Sp. l, TBP).# Required for the initiation of transcription# Contains RNA trans-acting response element (TAR) that binds tat. vif: Viral infectivity factor (p23)# Overcomes inhibitory effects of APOBEC, preventing hypermutation and viral DNA degradation. vpu: Viral protein U# Promotes CD4 degradation and influences virion releasenef: Negative effector (p27)# Promotes downregulation of surface CD4 and MHC 1 expression# Blocks apoptosis# Enhances virion infectivity# Alters state of cellular activation# Progression to disease slowed significantly in absence of NE. vpr: Viral protein R (pl5)# Promotes G2 cell-cycle arrest# Facilitates HIV infection of macrophages. rev: Regulator of viral gene expression (pl9)# Binds RRE# Inhibits viral RNA splicing and promotes nuclear export of incompletely spliced viral RNAs. tat: Transcriptional activator (pl4)# Binds TAR# In presence of host cyclin T1 and CDK9 enhances RNA Pol II elongation on the viral DNA template. gag: Pr55gag# Polyprotein processed by PR MA, matrix (pi7)# Undergoes myristylation that helps target gag polyprotein to lipid rafts;# CA, capsid (p24) binds cyclophilin A NC, nucleocapsid (p7) Zn finger, RNA-binding protein p6# Interacts with Vpr; contains late domain (PTAP) that binds TSG101 and participates in terminal stops of virion budding. pol: Polymerase# Encodes a variety of viral enzymes, including PR (plO), RT, and RNAase H (p66/51), and IN (p32) all processed by PR. env: gp 160 envelope protein# Cleaved in endoplasmic reticulum to gpl20 (SU) and gp41 (TM)# gpl20 mediates CD4 and chemokine receptor binding, while gp41 mediates fusion# Contains RNA response element (RRE) that binds Rev.",

First is the lytic, infectious phase characterized by nonspecific flulike symptoms (fever, chills, headache, and myalgia) that lasts about a week. This accompanied by a decrease in reticulocyte count and hemoglobin, which is not usually noticed in healthy children and adults. The second phase begins a week later when virus-specific IgG antibody appears and includes the characteristic \"slapped cheek\" appearance and lacy reticular rash. Adults often develop polyarthropathy or arthralgia. The rash and arthropathy are due to circulating antigen-antibody complexes. The rashes of rubella virus (c) and rubeola virus (measles virus) (d) occur in conjunction with fever. The lesions produced by HSV1 (a) and VZV (e) are vesicular in nature.",

AHC typically is caused by one of two enteroviruses (Coxsackie A24 or Enterovirus 70). This disease is transmitted person to person usually through contact with contaminated hands or through sharing of contaminated personal care items. No specific treatment is available for AHC; however, the illness is self limiting, and severe complications are rare. Nonetheless, because of its extremely contagious nature, AHC can disrupt the local economy and require substantial health care resources.",

The virus is therefore called varicella zoster virus (VZA).* Primary infection with VZV causes chicken pox.* Reactivation of latent VZV, when immunity has fallen to ineffective levels causes-Herpes zoster* The virus remains dormant in sensory ganglion of trigeminal nerve and reaches the eye along one or morebranches of the opthalmic division of the 5th nerve. Chicken pox* The causative agent of chicken pox is Varicella - Zoster virus (Herpes simplex type III).* It is an acute respiratory infection with incubation period 10-21 days.* Infection is acquired through respiratory tract via air droplets or rarely from conjunctiva.* Infectious period (communicable period) for chicken pox is 2 days prior to 5 days after onset of rash, with a very high secondary attack rate of 90%.* Chicken-pox usually affects children of age group 5-9 years.* Clinical features of chicken pox has two stages1) Pre-eruptive stage# Characterized by fever, back pain, malaise and shivering. 2) Eruptive stage# It is characterized by a characteristic rash with following features (which must be differentiated from rash of small pox)i) Superficial and unilocular (rash of small pox is deep seated and multilocular). ii) Symmetrical, mostly on flexor surface (rash of small-pox usually affect extensor surface). iii) Centripetal distribution (rash of smallpox has centrifugal distribution). iv) Affects axilla but spares palms and soles (rash of small-pox affects palms and soles but spares axilla). v) Pleomorphic, with appearance of all stages of rash simultaneously (rash is mon-omorphic in nature in small-pox). vi) Dew-drop on rose petal apperance (rash of small-pox has umblicated apperarance). vii) Area of inflammation around the rash (in small-pox there is no inflammation around the rash). viii) Evolution of rash is rapid, scabs begin to form 4-7 days after rash (evolution is slow, scabs begin 10-14 days after rash).* Though the disease affects children commonly, it is more severe in adults than in children.* Most common complication of varicella is secondary bacterial infection of skin, usually caused by streptococci or staphylococci. The most common extracutoneous site of involvement in children is CNS. Varicella pneumonia is the most serious complication following chicken - pox in adults. Important complications of chicken pox are:-i) Pulmonary: Pneumoniaii) CNS: Cerebellar ataxia, encephalitis, meningitis, GB syndrome, Transverse myelitis. iii) Others: Myocarditis, Nephritis, arthritis, hepatitis, corneal lesions, thrombocytopenia, bleeding diasthesis.* Latent infection is established in cranial nerve, sensory ganglia and spinal dorsal root ganglia. The virus may reactivate in immuno suppressive conditions, resulting in herpes zoter in about 10-30% of persons.",

        "exp": "The advent of triple therapy or a therapeutic \"cocktail\" has had a marked effect on AIDS patients. The combination of drugs work together as reverse transcriptive inhibitors and a protease inhibitor. Patients improve rapidly, their CD4 lymphocyte counts increase, and their HIV viral load is drastically reduced, often to <50 copies per ml. On the other hand, an untreated HIVpositive patient with a low CD4 and a high viral load a) is at increased risk of oppounistic infection and b) has a much greater chance of developing AIDS than if the viral load was <50, 000. The patient is infectious and his HIV antibody screening test will be positive. The high viral load, however, is not a predictor of response to therapy. Many patients with high viral loads do very well on triple therapy, although resistance to one or more of the agents may subsequently occur. A low CD4 count does not predict progression to AIDS but does indicate increased chance of oppounistic infection such as those listed. Kaposi's sarcoma, which has been linked to herpesvirus type 8, pneumocystis, and mycobacterial disease are three of the most prevalent oppounistic infections. While HIV-positive patients contract pneumococcal pneumonia, they are probably at no more risk than the general population, as protection against pneumococcal disease is linked to the presence of anticapsular antibody.

The physician observes disseminated lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, and a rash on the man's upper chest. The patient states that he had been to a party 2 weeks ago where he experimented with injecting drugs to get high. Needles were shared among the party-goers. A rapid latex test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies performed in the physician's office is negative. The doctor has a strong suspicion that this man has acute retroviral syndrome. Which of the following tests is most likely to support a diagnosis of HIV infection at this time?",
        "exp": "Reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR for HIV RNA (d) has recently been shown to be the most valuable test for diagnosis of acute HIV infection (acute retroviral syndrome) during the window period before antibodies can be detected. This qualitative test for detection of HIV virions is positive at the time symptoms of acute infection appear, as early as 7 days post infection; the test is also positive in asymptomatic individuals and is used to screen donated blood. The test for HIV p24 antigen (c) is the next to become positive, 17 to 38 days after infection. Antibodies appear last at 21 to 42 days (3 to 6 weeks) post infection. While there is some difference in the time to positivity of the various types of HIV antibody tests, the HIV antibody test by ELISA (b) would be no more likely to be positive this early than the latex aggregation test. The western blot for HIV antibodies (e) is used to confirm positive screening tests for antibodies. The CD4 T-cell count (a) is used to assess status of the immune system, determine the timing for treatment, suggest the likelihood of onset of various opportunistic infections, and monitor progress response of the immune system to treatment.

This occurs in transplant recipients, cancer patients on chemotherapy, and more particularly in the HIV infected. o. CMV is an important pathogen in AIDS. o. In AIDS patients, the already weakened immune response is further damaged by the nonspecific CMI inhibiting effect of CMVo. One of the glycoproteins on the surface of CMV acts as a receptor for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin molecules. This leads to masking of the virus by attachment of irrelevant immunoglobulin molecules, preventing access to specific anti-CMV antibody. o. Intrauterine infection leads to fetal death or cytomegalic inclusion disease of the newborn which is often fatal. o. This is a generalised infection associated with hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic anemia. o. The cytomegalic inclusion disease is probably the most important cause of microcephaly. o. Other manifestations include chorioretinitis and cerebral calcification resembling congenital toxoplasmosiso. Survivors may show mental retardation. o. Cytomegalic inclusion disease is seen almost exclusively in infants born to mothers developing primary CMV infection during pregnancy. o. Infants of mothers who have CMV reactivation during pregnancy tend to have chronic subclinical infection. o. Perinatal infection may be acquired from the infected mother through genital secretions or breast milk. o. Cytomegalovirus disease is rare but infection with the virus is extremely common. o. As with herpes simplex the large majority of infections are inapparent, leading to prolonged latency, with occasional reactivation. o. Clinical disease may be caused by either intrauterine or postnatal infections. Other Options[?]. Epstein Barr virus infection may lead to the following clinical conditions: o. Infectious mononucleosis. o.

Ag-positive have higher titers of HBV and therefore are at a higher risk of transmitting the disease. HBe. Ag has a high correlation with DNA polymerase activity. The hepatitis B core antigen (HBc. Ag) is found within the nuclei of infected hepatocytes and not generally in the peripheral circulation except as an integral component of the Dane particle. The antibody to this antigen, anti-HBc, is present at the beginning of clinical illness. As long as there is ongoing HBV replication, there will be high titers of anti-HBc. During the early convalescent phase of an HBV infection, anti-HBc may be the only detectable serologic marker (window phase) if HBs. Ag is negative and anti-HBs. Ag has not appeared.",

Detection of anti-HAV IgM in a single serum specimen obtained in the acute or convalescent stage is the quickest and most reliable method to diagnose hepatitis A infection. This antibody is usually present at onset of symptoms and may persist 3 to 6 months. Demonstration of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs. Ag) in serum is the most common method of diagnosing HBV infection. Other serologic markers helpful in characterizing infection with HBV include hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), anti-hepatitis B core (anti-HBc), anti-hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe), and hepatitis B e antigen (HBe. Ag). Several epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that immune serum globulin (ISG) can prevent clinical hepatitis A even when given up to 10 days after exposure. Similar studies have shown that ISG was able to decrease the incidence of hepatitis B infection in exposed persons. Purified, noninfectious HBs. Ag derived from healthy HBs. Ag carriers has been used as a vaccine for active immunization for HBV infection. Hepatitis C is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae. The viral reservoir is human. Recent retrospective \"lookbacks\" suggest that many people were infected with HCV before testing of the blood supply was initiated in the early 1990s. HCV is treatable with combinations of drugs. The genotype of the virus plays an important role in the determination of length of therapy. Hepatitis D virus is an incomplete or defective virus which requires HBs. Ag as a cofactor. Both coinfection and secondary delta infection exist with secondary infection being the most serious. Hepatitis E virus is an RNA virus.

        "exp": "Orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses are RNA viruses that contain a single-stranded RNA genome. The influenza viruses belong to the orthomyxoviruses. They cause acute respiratory tract infections that usually occur in epidemics. Isolated strains of influenza virus are named after the virus type (influenza A, B, or C) as well as the host and location of initial isolation, the year of isolation, and the antigenic designation of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are glycoproteins under separate genetic control, and because of this they can and do vary independently. The changes in these antigens are responsible for the antigenic drift characteristic of these viruses. The paramyxoviruses include several important human pathogens (mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus). Both paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses possess an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is a structural component of the virion and produces the initial RNA. Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) are not related to the paramyxoviruses. They are 150-nm single-stranded RNA viruses. There are 2 antigen groups, A and B, which play no role in diagnosis and treatment. While the overall mortality is 0. 5%, at-risk groups may be 25 to 35% mortality if untreated. Some parainfluenza virus infections (type 3) may be indistinguishable from RSV, but most parainfluenza infections produce a laryngotracheobronchitis known as croup.",

Although most infections by human papillomavirus are benign, some undergo malignant transformation into in situ and invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Both HPV and polyomavirus have icosahedral capsids and DNA genomes. JC virus, a polyomavirus, was first isolated from the diseased brain of a patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma who was dying of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). This demyelinating disease occurs usually in immunosuppressed persons and is the result of oligodendrocyte infection by JC virus. JC virus has also been isolated from the urine of patients suffering from demyelinating disease. Cryotherapy and laser treatment are the most popular therapies for warts, although surgery may be indicated in some cases. At the present time, there is no effective antiviral therapy for treatment of infection with polyomavirus or HPV West Nile virus is an arbovirus. While prevalent in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, it was not seen in the United States until the summer of 1999.

In most cases, however, the infection was transmitted from human to human. Case-fatality rates varied among outbreaks, with an overall figure of 9. 5%. The disease appeared to be somewhat milder in cases in the United States and was clearly less severe among children.

Robbin's pathology 7th/ 18-D; Ananthanarayan Microbiology, 7th/ 552)HBV is a partially double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus packaged with a core protein (HBc. Ag) and DNA polymerase, and enclosed by envelope proteins (HBs. Ag). Following receptor-mediated entry into hepatocytes, the virus enters the nucleus, where its DNA is frequently integrated into the host genome. The HBV has four genes: S, P, C, and X. The S gene codes for the \"major\" envelope protein (HBs. Ag). The largest is P gene. It codes for DNA polymerase. The C gene codes for HBe. Ag and HBc. Ag. The C gene has a precore and a core region. If translation is initiated at the precore region, the protein product is HBe. Ag. If translation begins with the core region, HBc. Ag is the protein product. HBe. Ag is a marker of HBV replication and infectivity. The precore region is not necessary for viral replication. Precore mutants can replicate. They are readily detectable by HBV DNA in serum, but hepatitis B e antigen (Hbe. Ag) is absent. The X gene codes for HBx. Ag. The product of the X gene is hepatitis B x antigen (HBx. Ag). It may be involved in carcinogenesis. Basal core promoter mutants cause a reduction in HBe. Ag production. Protein synthesis proceeds from 4 open reading frames:# Envelope proteins - Major, Middle, and Large - (HBs. Ag) from the -S gene, pre-Sl, and pre-S2 gene sequences;# The e antigen (HBe.

        "exp": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus that causes a number of syndromes; the most common is infectious mononucleosis. It is a ubiquitous enveloped DNA virus. Only one serotype of EBV has been recognized, although molecular methods have reorganized a number of genotypes of EBV. Infectious mononucleosis is an acute disease most commonly seen in younger people. It is characterized by a proliferation of lymphocytes, lymph node enlargement, pharyngitis, fatigue, and fever. Infection in young children is usually either asymptomatic or characteristic of an acute upper respiratory infection. Diagnosis is usually made by a positive heterophil test. Heterophil antibodies are those that occur in one species (human) and react with antigens of a different species. The heterophil test may be insensitive (30 to 60%) in children. Definitive diagnosis is made by detection of antibodies to EBV components. EBV causes a variety of other syndromes including Burkitt's lymphoma, the most common childhood cancer in Africa, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, commonly seen in China. Similar mononucleosis-like diseases are caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite. CMV causes fewer than 10% of infectious mononucleosis-like diseases. CMV \"mono\" is primarily characterized by fatigue. Congenital infection with CMV almost always causes serious sequelae, such as retardation and hearing loss. T. gondii also causes a variety of clinical problems, among them encephalitis in AIDS patients and food poisoning from the ingestion of raw meat. Although CMV and T. gondii are relatively rare causes of infectious mononucleosis, they must be ruled out, particularly when EBV tests are nonreactive.",

        "exp": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus that causes a number of syndromes; the most common is infectious mononucleosis. It is a ubiquitous enveloped DNA virus. Only one serotype of EBV has been recognized, although molecular methods have reorganized a number of genotypes of EBV. Infectious mononucleosis is an acute disease most commonly seen in younger people. It is characterized by a proliferation of lymphocytes, lymph node enlargement, pharyngitis, fatigue, and fever. Infection in young children is usually either asymptomatic or characteristic of an acute upper respiratory infection. Diagnosis is usually made by a positive heterophil test. Heterophil antibodies are those that occur in one species (human) and react with antigens of a different species. The heterophil test may be insensitive (30 to 60%) in children. Definitive diagnosis is made by detection of antibodies to EBV components. EBV causes a variety of other syndromes including Burkitt's lymphoma, the most common childhood cancer in Africa, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, commonly seen in China. Similar mononucleosis-like diseases are caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite. CMV causes fewer than 10% of infectious mononucleosis-like diseases. CMV \"mono\" is primarily characterized by fatigue. Congenital infection with CMV almost always causes serious sequelae, such as retardation and hearing loss. T. gondii also causes a variety of clinical problems, among them encephalitis in AIDS patients and food poisoning from the ingestion of raw meat. Although CMV and T. gondii are relatively rare causes of infectious mononucleosis, they must be ruled out, particularly when EBV tests are nonreactive.",

The tests can be quantitative when reference standards are used, and appropriate positive and negative controls must be included in each test. Because these molecular based tests are very sensitive, they form the basis for plasma viral load determinations. It is generally agreed that the amount of HIV in the blood (viral load) is of significant prognostic value. There are continual rounds of viral replication and cell killing in each patient, and the steady-state level of virus in the blood varies with individuals. A single measurement of plasma viral load approximately 6 months after infection can predict the risk of development of AIDS in men several years later. In women, viral load appears to be less predictive. The plasma viral load appears to be the best predictor of long-term clinical outcome, whereas CD4 lymphocyte counts are the best predictor of sho-term risk of developing an oppounistic disease. Plasma viral load measurements are a critical element in assessing the effectiveness of antiretroviral drug therapy. Ref:- Baveja textbook of Microbiology",
