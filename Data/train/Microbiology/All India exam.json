Mucous membranes are spared.Peripheral cyanosis is commonly caused by cold exposure with vasoconstriction in the digits.Similar physiology is found in Raynaud's phenomenon. Peripheral vascular disease and deep venous thrombosis result in slowed blood flow and increased oxygen extraction with subsequent cyanosis. Methemoglobinemia causes abnormal haemoglobin that circulates systemically. Consequently, the cyanosis associated with this disorder is systemic.Other common causes of central cyanosis include severe lung disease with hypoxemia, right-to-left intracardiac shunting, and pulmonary aeriovenous malformations.",

The only indication for fibrinolysis in pulmonary embolus (PE) is for massive PE presenting with life-threatening hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, and refractory hypoxemia.In submassive PE presenting with preserved blood pressure and evidence of right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiogram, the decision to pursue fibrinolysis is made on a case-by-case situation. In addition to fibrinolysis, the patient should also receive circulatory suppo with vasopressors.Dopamine and dobutamine are the vasopressors of choice for the treatment of shock in PE. Caution should be taken with the ongoing high-volume fluid administration as a poorly functioning right ventricle may be poorly tolerant of additional fluids.Ongoing fluids may worsen right ventricular ischemia and fuher dilate the right ventricle, displacing the interventricular septum to the left to worsen cardiac output and hypotension. If the patient had contraindications to fibrinolysis and was unable to be stabilized with vasopressor suppo, referral for surgical embolectomy should be considered.Referral for inferior vena cava filter placement is not indicated at this time. The patient should be stabilized hemodynamically as a first priority.The indications for inferior vena cava filter placement are active bleeding, precluding anticoagulation, and recurrent deep venous thrombosis on adequate anticoagulation.",

Type III enzymes are also large combination restriction-and-modification enzymes.

For one or more specific sequences in a DNA sample, quantitative PCR enables both detection and quantification. The quantity can be either an absolute number of copies or a relative amount when normalized to DNA input or additional normalizing genes. The procedure follows the general principle of polymerase chain reaction; its key feature is that the amplified DNA is detected as the reaction progresses in \"real time\". This is a new approach compared to standard PCR, where the product of the reaction is detected at its end. Two common methods for the detection of products in quantitative PCR are: (1) non-specific fluorescent dyes that intercalate with any double-stranded DNA, and (2) sequence-specific DNA probes consisting of oligonucleotides that are labelled with a fluorescent repoer which permits detection only after hybridization of the probe with its complementary sequence to quantify messenger RNA (mRNA) and non-coding RNA in cells or tissues.",

When I-125 is used therapeutically, it is encapsulated in titanium seeds and implanted in the area of a tumour, where it remains. The low energy of the gamma spectrum, in this case, limits radiation damage to tissues far from the implanted capsule.
