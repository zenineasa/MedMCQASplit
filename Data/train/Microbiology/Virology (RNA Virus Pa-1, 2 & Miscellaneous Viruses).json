In this case, encephalitis with focal lesions are present. High levels of IgG indicates chronic infection, the current infection is likely a reactivation of an earlier infection; therefore, recent exposures can be eliminated. So, Option 4 is ruled out. Exposure to pigeons suggests Cryptococcosis, which is often a reactivation infection. However, in cryptococcosis antibody levels are rarely monitored, and there is no mention of India ink stain or capsular polysaccharide in the cerebrospinal fluid, which are the major diagnostic methods. So, Option 1 is ruled out. In addition, based on the patient's symptoms, the infection is more likely to be encephalitis rather than meningitis or meningoencephalitis; also, retinochoroiditis is usually not present in cryptococcosis. The retinochoroiditis and lack of mucocutaneous lesions makes infection with Coccidioides less likely. Dese rheumatism (Coccidioides)is the disease caused by exposure to dese sand.
