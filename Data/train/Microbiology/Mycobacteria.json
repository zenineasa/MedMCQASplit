SO4 is used for discoloration (instead of 20% H2. SO4 used for M. tuberculosis). o Bacilli are bound together by lipid-like substance, the glia. These masses of bacilli arc called globi. Parallel row of bacilli in globi gives 'cigar-bundle' appearance. Globi are seen in virchow's lepra cells or foamy cells which are histocytes (tissue macrophages)o 'Phenolic gly colipid-1 (PGL-1)' acts as a virulence factor.

An infectious patient can be rendered non-infectious by dapsone treatment in 90 days or by rifampicin treatment in 3 weeks. Local application of rifampicin destroy all the bacilli within 8 days. o Source of infection - Multibacillary cases (most important), subclinical infections. The role of individuals with tuberculoid forms of the disease sources of infection is not clear. The current view is that all patients with active leprosy must be considered infectiouso Modes of transmission arei) Droplet infection: Most common mode. ii) Contact transmission: Either direct (skin to skin) or indirect (contact with contaminated soil or fomite). iii) Other: Breast milk from lepromatous leprosy, by insect vector, by tattooing needles.",

Explanation: M. uicerans and M. marinum are exclusively skin pathogens, causing chronic ulcers and granulomatous lesions on the skin. Systemic invasion does not occur and the regional lymph glands are not involved. Cutaneous localisation is because they multiply optimally at skin temperature. M. marinum: It is a natural pathogen of cold blooded animals (fish and amphibians). Human infection originates from contaminated swimming pools or fish tank. The lesion usually follows abrasions and therefore occurs on the prominences--elbows, knees, ankles, nose, fingers or toes. It begins as a papule and breaking down to form an indolent ulcer. The lesion caused by M. marinum is also known as 'swimming pool granuloma\"It has been reported from temperate countries such as North America and European countries. This bacilli grows in about two weeks at 30degC (range 25-35 degC. Infection with M. marinum may cause a low- grade tuberculin reaction. M. ulcerans: Ulcers caused by M. ulcerans are usually seen on the legs or arms and are believed to follow infection through minor injuries. After an incubation period of a few weeks, indurated nodules appear which break down, forming indolent ulcers which slowly extend under the skin. The bacillus grows on Lowenstein-Jensen medium slowly, in 4-8 weeks; growth occurs only between 30 degC and 33 deg. CA toxin is produced by M. ulcerans that causes inflammation and necrosis when injected into the skin of guinea pigs. This is the only mycobacterium species known to produce a toxin",
