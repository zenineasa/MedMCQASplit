HEPATITIS C VIRUS (HCV)o The hepatitis 'C' virus has been classified as a new' genus Hepacivirus in the family flaviviridae. o The virus can not be cultured but can be cloned in Escherichia coli. o It is the commonest cause of post transfusion hepatitis and chronic hepatitis. o Incubation period is 50 days (15 - 160 days), o Modes of transmission of HCV are:-Blood transfusion: Most common mode of transmission and HCV is the most common cause of post-transfusion hepatitis. Percutaneous transmission: By needle punctures. Perinatal transmission: Transmission appears to be a function of the degree of maternal viremia which is detected by PCR for HCV RNA. Sexual transmission. o Among hepatitis viruses, HCV has the maximum propensity for chronic hepatitis and chronic carrier state. It can also cause cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. o The most common indication for liver transplantation currently is cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis; C' infection. o HCV usually does not cause acute liver failure (vary rare with HCV)o Extrahepatic manifestation with HCV infection may be essential mixed cryoglobulinemia (more than HBV), porphyria cutanea tarda, pulmonary fibrosis and membrano-proliferative GN. Among the Hepatitis viruses, vaccine is available for HAV and HBV. Live attenuated vaccine is available for HAV only (among hepatitis viruses).",
