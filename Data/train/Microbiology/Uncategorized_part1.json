Pinworm (genus En terobius)/Threadworm/Seatworm, It is a nematode (roundworm) and a common human intestinal parasite, especially in children. It inhabits the caecum, appendix and adjacent poion of the ascending colon, lying closely applied to the mucosal surface It causes enterobiasis, or less precisely as oxyuriasis in reference to the family Oxyuridae. The pinworm appears as a white, small and delicate nematode. The adult female has a sharply pointed posterior end, is 8 to 13 millimeters long, and 0. 5 millimeter thick. The adult male is considerably smaller, measuring 2 to 5 millimeters long and 0. 2 millimeter thick, and has a curved posterior end. The eggs are translucent and have a surface that adheres to environmental objects. The eggs measure 50 to 60 micrometers by 20 to 30 micrometers, and have a thick shell that is flattened on one side. The small size and colorlessness of the eggs make them invisible to the naked eye, except in barely visible clumps of thousands of eggs. Eggs may contain a developing embryo or a fully developed pinworm larva. Inside the host, the larvae grow to 140-150 micrometers in length Pinworms spread through human-to-human transmission, by ingesting (i. e., swallowing) infectious pinworm eggs and/or by anal sex. The eggs are hardy and can remain ble (i. e., infectious) in a moist environment for up to three weeks. They do not tolerate heat well, but can survive in low temperatures: two-thirds of the eggs are still ble after 18 hours at -8 degrees Celsius (18 degF). After the eggs have been initially deposited near the anus, they are readily transmitted to other surfaces through contamination. The surface of the eggs is sticky when laid, and the eggs are readily transmitted from their initial deposit near the anus to fingernails, hands, night-clothing and bed linen. From here, eggs are fuher transmitted to food, water, furniture, toys, bathroom fixtures and other objects. Household pets often carry the eggs in their fur, while not actually being infected. Dust containing eggs can become airborne and widely dispersed when dislodged from surfaces, for instance when shaking out bed clothes and linen. Consequently the eggs can enter the mouth and nose through inhalation, and be swallowed later. Although pinworms do not strictly multiply inside the body of their human host, some of the pinworm larvae may hatch on the anal mucosa, and migrate up the bowel and back into the gastrointestinal tract of the original host. This process is called retroinfection. Despite the limited, 13 week lifespan of individual pinworms, autoinfection (i. e., infection from the original host to itself), either through the anus-to-mouth route or through retroinfection, causes the pinworms to inhabit the same host indefinitely",

The germinal layer is the site of asexual reproduction. It also secretes the hydatid fluid which fills the cavity. The fluid is clear, colourless / pale yellow with a pH of 6. 7 containing salts and protein. It is a good antigen which sensitises the host. The fluid was used as the antigen for Casoni's intradermal test and other diagnostic serological tests. From the germinal layer, small knob like excrescences / gemmules protrude into the lumen of the cyst. These enlarge and become vacuolated and filled with fluid. These are called brood capsules. They are initially attached to the germinal layer by a stalk, but later escapes free into the fluid filled cyst cavity. From the inner wall of brood capsule, protoscolices develop, which represent head of adult worm, complete with invaginated scolex, bearing suckers and hooklets. Each of these are potential tapeworm. Many of the scolices float free in the cyst fluid. These with free brood capsules are called hydatid sand. Ref: Paniker's Textbook of parasitology, 6th Ed page 151.",

It is a major agent of schistosomiasis; more specifically, it is associated with urinary schistosomiasis. Adults are found in the Venous plexuses around the urinary bladder and the released eggs traverse the wall of the bladder causing haematuria and fibrosis of the bladder. The bladder becomes calcified, and there is increased pressure on ureters and kidneys otherwise known as hydronephrosis. Inflammation of the genitals due to S. haematobium may contribute to the propagation of HIV. Studies have shown the relationship between S. haematobium infection and the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder Life cycle The female fluke lays as many as 30 eggs per day which migrate to the lumen of the urinary bladder and ureters. The eggs are eliminated from the host into the water supply with micturition. In fresh water, the eggs hatch forming free swimming miracidia which penetrate into the intermediate snail host (Bulinus spp., e. g. B. globosus, B. forskalii, B. nyassanus and B. truncatus). Inside the snail, the miracidium sheds it epithelium and develops into a mother sporocyst. After two weeks the mother begins forming daughter sporocysts. Four weeks after the initial penetration of the miracardium into the snail furcocercous cercariae begin to be released. The cercariae cycle from the top of the water to the bottom for three days in the search of a human host. Within half an hour the cercariae enter the host epithelium",

Antibodies test usually nucleic acid or antigen. B. Detection of HIV nucleic acid or antigen P24 antigen detection by ELISA can be done 16 days after infection (earlier than antibody detection). Nucleic acid detection tests are the earliest to become positive (12 days after infection), Most commonly used test is reverse transcriptase PCR, (RT-PCR), other methods used are DNA-PCR, RNA-PCR, RNA-b. DNA (branched DNA), and RNA-NASBA (nuclei acid sequenced based assay). C. Virus isolation Co-cultivation of the patient's lymphocyte with uninfected lymphocytes in the presence of IL-2.

It typically produces watery diarrhea that progress to bloody diarrhea after a few hours to few days. Fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting are associated complaints. Mechanism of enterohemorrhagic colitis appears to be vascular endothelial damage that leads to platelet aggregation and initiation of the coagulation cascade.

Prophylaxis of diphtheria. Diphtheria can be controlled by immunisation. The objective of immunisation is to increase protective level of antitoxin in circulation. Three methods of immunisation are available: 1) Active immunisation By administration of toxoid, either formal toxoid or adsorbed toxoid. It is the best method for prevention.. Usually intramuscular injection is given.. Provide herd immunity.. Primary immunization consists of 3 doses at four weeks interval. 2) Passive immunisation. By subcutaneous injection of antitoxin (antidiphtheric serum (ADS)).. This is an emergency measure to be employed when susceptibles are exposed to infection. 3) Combined immunization.

Graft versus host disease occurs most commonly in the setting of allogenic bone marrow transplantation but may also follow transplantation of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e. g. the liver) or transfusion of unirradiated blood. Recipients of bone marrow transplants are immunodeficient because of either their primary disease or prior treatment of the disease with drugs or irradiation. When such recipients receive normal bone marrow cells from allogenic donors, the immunocompetent, T cells present in the donor marrow recognizes the recipient's HLA antigen as foreign antigen and react against them. Both CD4+ and CD8+T cells recognize and attack host tissues. In clinical practice GVH can be so severe that bone marrow transplants are done only between ILIA matched donor and recipient. Acute GVH disease occurs within days to weeks after allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Although any organ may be affected, the major clinical manifestation results from involvement of the immune system and epithelia of the skin, liver and intestines. Involvement of the skin in GVH disease is manifested by a generalized rash leading to desquamation in severe cases. Destruction of small bile ducts gives rise to jaundice and mucosal ulceration of the gut results in bloody diarrhoea. Immunodeficiency is a frequent accompaniment of GVH disease. The immunodeficiency may be a result of prior treatment, myeloablative preparation for the graft, a delay in repopulation of the recipient's immune system and attack on host's immune cells by grafted lymphocytes. Affected individuals are profoundly immunosuppressed and are easy prey to infections. Although many different types of organisms may infect patients, infection with cytomegalovirus is paicularly impoant.",

        "exp": "This patient has the classic symptoms of cat scratch disease caused by the bacillus Baonella henselae. The disease is self-limited with the onset of symptoms occurring 3-10 days following an inoculating scratch. The organism can be isolated from kittens, typically less than 1 year of age, or from fleas. A history of a new kitten in the house and the papule at the site of a scratch with regional painful adenopathy defines the classic scenario. Chickens can harbor Salmonella spp. producing a gastroenteritis or enterocolitis. Chicken guano is also a orable environment for the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. The mycelial phase thrives in the rich soil. The human disease is a granulomatous infection involving the lungs and mimicking tuberculosis. Dogs or puppies carry Capnocytophaga canimorsus as pa of the normal flora of the oral cavity. Infections from licking or biting range from a self-severe infections are those with asplenia, alcoholism, or hematologic malignancies. This organism is also associated with cat bites, but the patient develops cellulitis and fulminant septicemia, especially in asplenic patients. Pasteurella multocida is another pathogen that colonizes the nasopharynx and gastrointestinal tract of cats and dogs. Cats have the highest rate of colonization (50-90%), followed by dogs (50%), swine (50%), and rats (14%). P. multocida most commonly causes a localized soft tissue infection or cellulitis after an animal bite, but systemic symptoms may be present in about 40% of the cases. These symptoms include osteomyelitis, septic ahritis, or tenosynovitis. Horses and horse manure have been associated with a pulmonary oppounistic infection with cavitation caused by Rhodococcus equi that resembles tuberculosis in immunocompromised patients. Burkholderia mallei (the cause of glanders) is characterized by non-caseating granulomatous abscesses of skin, lymphadenopathy, and pronounced involvement of the lungs. Ref: Levinson W. (2012).

Without a cell wall, they are unaffected by many common antibiotics such as penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. M. pneumonine, which is an impoant cause of atypical pneumonia Mycoplasma is by definition restricted to veebrate hosts. Cholesterol is required for the growth of species of the genus Mycoplasma. Their optimum growth temperature is often the temperature of their host if warmbodied (e. g. 37deg C in humans) or ambient temperature if the host is unable to regulate its own internal temperature. Mycoplasmas are unusual among bacteria in that most require sterols for the stability of their cytoplasmic membrane. Sterols are acquired from the environment, usually as cholesterol from the animal host. Mycoplasmas generally possess a relatively small genome of 0. 58-1. 38 megabases Additionally they use an alternate genetic code where the codon UGA is encoding for the amino acid tryptophan instead of the usual opal stop codon. They have a low GC-content (23-40 mol %). Mycoplasma cells are physically small - less than 1 - and they are therefore difficult to detect with a conventional microscope.

The lesions begin with formation of lymphoid follicles in the conjunctiva. With disease progression, there is tissue necrosis, granulation tissue deposition, and scar formation, leading to lacrimal duct obstruction and distoion of the eyelids. With the loss of an adequate tear system, the cornea becomes vulnerable to dehydration and opacification. Also, the vigorous inflammatory response can directly involve the cornea, with resulting opacity. In developed countries, chlamydial eye infections are often transmitted venereally rather than by flies, and may cause conjunctivitis in the newborn and in sexually active young adults. Ref: Ray C.

As it is not transpoed across the placenta, the presence of IgM in the fetus or newborn indicates intrauterine infection and its detection is useful in the diagnosis of congenital infections such as syphilis, rubella and toxoplasmosis. It normally circulates as pentamer. It is the oldest immunoglobulin class. It is the predominant antibody in primary antibody response. It is sho lived, disappearing earlier than IgG.. Hence, its demonstration in serum indicates recent infection. Treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol selectively destroys IgM without affecting IgG. This is a simple method for the differential estimation of IgG and IgM. The isohemagglutinins (blood group anti A, anti B) are usually IgM Being largely confined to the intravascular space, IgM is believed to be responsible for protection against blood invasion by microorganisms.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Specific antibody Hybridomas are cells that have been engineered to produce a specific antibody in huge numbers. Hybridomas Hybridomas are cells that have been engineered to produce a specific antibody in huge numbers To achieve this, qualities of two types of cells have to be combined together i. e. Cells which can produce large amount of pure antibody and Cells which have the ability to grow continually. These two types of cells are then fused together to form hybridoma. Procedure The pure antibody secreting cells are produced by injecting specific antigen in a mouse and obtaining the antigen specific plasma cells (antibody producing cell) from the mouse's spleen. Cell which can grow indefinitely in culture are myeloma cells (cancerous cells). These two cell lines are fused together. The hybrid cell which is thus produced can be cloned to produce large number of identical daughter clones. These daughter clone cells then produce antibodies. Since these antibodies come from only one type of cell (hybridoma cell) they are called monoclonal antibodies. HAT (hypoxanthine, Aminopterin and thymidine) medium is used for preparation of monoclonal antibodies because it allows only fused hybridoma cells to grow. It does not allow the unfused myeloma and unfused antibody cells to grow. So HAT medium is a selective medium which allows (which allow selective growth of fused hybridoma) How does this happen? Before we move on with the discussion, remember these few points about purine synthesis. Purine synthesis is essential for the survival of cells. Purine can be synthesized in two way i. e. De novo synthesis (dihydrofolate reductase enzyme is required for this pathway). Salvage pathway (an enzyme hypoxanthine - guanine phosphoribosyl transferase is required for salvage pathways) Myeloma cells lack HGPase enzyme therefore they cannot synthesize purine by salvage pathways. o Antibody cells have HGPase enzyme so they can use the salvage pathways. Aminopterin inhibits dihydrofolate reductase an enzyme used in denovo synthesis of purine When two cell lines i. e. antibody producing cell and myeloma cells are grown in HAT medium only the fused hybridoma cells survive. Myeloma cells die because they lack the enzyme HGPase so they cannot use the salvage pathways for purine synthesis. They also cannot use de-novo pathway, because Aminopterin present in the HAT medium inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (an enzyme essential for denovo synthesis ofpurine). The unfused antibody producing cells die as they cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span. Only fused hybridoma cells grow indefinitely because the antibody cell paner supplies HGPase and the myeloma paner gives it immoality. (as it is a cancer cell)",

Categories of effective potency Sterilants:- are capable of completely eliminating or destroying in all forms of microbial life, including spores. Disinfectants:- Destroy some, but not necessarily all organisms. The category is fuher divided into subcategories:- i) High level disinfectants:- In their usual concentration and contact period, they destroy all microorganisms, with exception of high number of bacterial spores ( small number of spores can be destroyed). It is woh noting that at higher concentrations and prolonged contact period, high level disinfectant can act as steriliant, i. e. can kill high numbers of spores as well. Examples are:-2% gluteraldehyde, 8% formaldehyde, 6-10% hydrogen peroxide and ethylene oxide gas. ii) Intermediate level disinfectants:- Inactivate even resistant organisms such as mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as vegetative bacteria, most viruses and most fungi, but do not necessarily kill bacterial spores. Examples are:-0. 5% iodine, 70-90% ethanol and isopropanol, chlorine compounds (hypochlorite), some phenolic compounds and iodophor based disinfectants. iii) Low level disinfectants:- kill most bacteria, some viruses and some fungi, but cannot be relied on to kill resistant microorganisms such as tubercular bacilli or bacterial spores. Examples are:- quaerly ammonium compounds, mercurials, some phenolic compounds and iodophores. Note:- the disinfectant levels of iodophors (iodines) and phenolic compounds may be classified as intermediate or low depending on the concentration employed.",

These granules stain reddish violet with methylene blue or toluidine blue. These granules are strongly basophilic. In the granules, there is stored phosphate in the form of linear chains of inorganic phosphate. These granules represent intracellular phosphate reserve when nucleic acid syntheis does not occur. The phosphate is incorporated into nucleic acid during the synthesis of the latter. When nucleic acid synthesis is prevented by starvation, the granules accumulate in the cytoplasm. So, volutin metachromatic granules are most frequent in cells grown under conditions of nutritional deficiency (starvation) and tend to disappear when the deficient nutrients are supplied.

B: Formaldehyde fumigation Chemical Sterilization Although heating provides the most reliable way to rid objects of all transmissible agents, it is not always appropriate, because it will damage heat-sensitive materials such as biological materials, fiber optics, electronics, and many plastics. Ethylene oxide Highly-penetrative and active against bacteria, spores and viruses - Also flammable, toxic and expensive - Leaves toxic residue on sterilised items - Instruments therefore need to be stored for prolonged period before use - Suitable for heat-sensitive items Chlorine bleach is another accepted liquid sterilizing agent. Household bleach consists of 5. 25% sodium hypochlorite. It is usually diluted to 1/10 immediately before use; however to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis it should be diluted only 1/5. Bleach will kill many organisms immediately, but for full sterilization it should be allowed to react for 20 minutes. Bleach will kill many, but not all spores. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde solutions are accepted liquid sterilizing agents, provided that the immersion time is sufficiently long. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde are volatile, and toxic by both skin contact and inhalation. Formaldehyde is less expensive and has a much longer shelf life if some methanol is added to inhibit polymerization to paraformaldehyde, but is much more volatile. Many vaccines, such as the original Salk polio vaccine, are sterilized with formaldehyde. Fumigation (sterilization) of operation theatres: - Seal the room with adhesive tapes round the edges of the doors/ windows and ventilators and apeures. - For Each 1000 cu. ft of space place 500m1 formaldehyde (40% solution) and 1000m1 of water in an electric boiler. Switch on the boiler, leave the room and seal the door. - Seal the room for 24 hrs. - Then open the door and neutralize any residual formaldehyde. Hydrogen peroxide and formic acid are mixed as needed in the Endoclens device for sterilization of endoscopes. This device has two independent asynchronous bays, and cleans (in warm detergent with pulsed air), sterilizes and dries endoscopes automatically in 30 minutes.",

        "exp": "Ans. C: Phycomycetes Phycomycetes are lower fungi which have non-septate hyphae and form endogenous asexual spores (sporangiospores) contained within sporangia Systematic classification of fungi, based on their sexual spore formation, recognizes 4 classes: Phycomycetes: Non-septate hyphae, produces sporangiospores (asexual spores), oospores and zygospores (sexual spores) Ascomycetes: Septate hyphae, Produces conidia (asexual spores) and ascospores (sexual spores) Basidiomycetes: Septate hyphae, Produces conidia (asexual spores) and basidioapores (sexual spores) Fungi imperfectii: Septate hyphae, Produces conidia (asexual spores) and Whose sexual phase has not been identified Phycomycetes It is an taxon for ceain fungi with nonseptate hyphae. These fungi are classified under Zygomycota Zygomycota/ zygote fungi, term is derived from zygosporangia, where resistant spherical spores are formed during sexual reproduction. They are mostly terrestrial in habitat, living in soil or on decaying plant or animal material. Zygomycete hyphae may be coenocytic, forming septa only where gametes are formed or to wall off dead hyphae The common example of a zygomycete is black bread mold (Rhizopus stolonifer), a member of the Mucorales. It spreads over the surface of bread and other food sources, sending hyphae inward to absorb nutrients. In its asexual phase it develops bulbous black sporangia at the tips of upright hyphae, each containing hundreds of haploid spores. As in most zygomycetes, asexual reproduction is the most common form of reproduction. Sexual reproduction in Rhizopus stolonifera, as in other zygomycetes, occurs when haploid hyphae of different mating types are in close proximity to each other. Growth of the gametangia commences after gametangia come in contact, and plasmogamy, or the fusion of the cytoplasm, occurs. Karyogamy, which is the fusion of the nuclei, follows closely after. The zygosporangia are then diploid. Zygosporangia are typically thick-walled, highly resilient to environmental hardships, and metabolically ine. When conditions improve, however, they germinate to produce a sporangium or vegetative hyphae. Meiosis occurs during germination of the zygosporagium so the resulting spores or hyphae are haploid. Grows in warm and damp conditions.",

It causes watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps and low grade fever. The common etiologies of traveler's diarrhea may vary with location and with season. However, on a world-wide basis, the organism most frequently identified in patients with traveler's diarrhea is enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. This organism accounts for between 30% and 70% of all cases of traveler's diarrhea. Transmission is usually through food or water that is fecally contaminated. The virulence factor implicated are as follows: Heat stable enterotoxin stimulates fluid secretion by activating guanylate cyclase in enteric epithelial cells. Heat labile exotoxin binds to the ganglioside at the brush border of epithelial cells of small intestine and leads to activation of adenylate cyclase. Colonization factors facilitate the attachment of ETEC to epithelial cells of intestine. Ref: Textbook of Microbiology ANANTHANARAYANAN, 8th Ed, page 274-277",

They are shorter and thinner than flagella Fimbriae can be seen only under the electron microscope. Fimbriae function as organs of adhesion, helping the cells to adhere firmly to particles of various kinds Fimbriated bacteria form surface pellicles in liquid media. Many fimbriated cells (for example Escherichia, Klebsiella) agglutinate red blood cells. Hemagglutination provides a simple method of detecting the presence of such fimbriae. The hemagglutination is specifically inhibited by D- mannose (mannose sensitive) A special type of fimbria is the sex pili. They are found on \u2018male' bacteria and help in the attachment of those cells to \u2018female' bacteria. They do not mediate attachment to epithelium Flagella Flagella are the organs of locomotion. Flagellum consists of three distinct parts the filament, the hook and the basal Flagella are made up of a protein (flagellin) Flagella are less than 0. 02 Jim in thickness and hence beyond the limit of resolution of the light microscope. They may, in some instances, be seen under dark ground illumination. They can be visualised by special staining techniques in which their thickness is increased by mordanting, or by electron microscopy Mesosoxnes Mesosomes (chondroid) are vesicular, convoluted or niultilaniinated structures formed as invaginations of the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. They are more prominent in Gram-positive bacteria. They are the principal sites of respiratory enzymes in bacteria and are analogous to the mitochondria of eukaryotes. Mesosomes are often seen in relation to the nuclear body and the site of synthesis of crosswall septa, suggesting that they coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic division during binary fission",

A positive reaction is characterized by a local inflammatory reaction that reaches maximum intensity in 4-7 days and reduces gradually. This indicates absence of immunity to C. diphtheriae. Negative reaction indicates presence of antitoxin in the individual which neutralizes the toxin injected. Such individuals are immune to C diphtheriae infection.

        "question": "Chediak higashi syndrome, defect is?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Fusion of lysosome Chediak higashi syndrome It is an autosomal recessive disorder. Chediak higashi syndrome is caused due to mutation in the LYST gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protien known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein plays a role in transpo of materials into lysosomes. Lysosomes contain several enzyme. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down several toxins. During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterias. Mutation in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot fuse with phagosome to form phagolysosome. Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation. As a result, most people with chediak higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections, staing in infancy or early childhood. These infections are life threatening. Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory /storage granules of various other cells are also affected. The other cells involved are - Melanosomes of melanocytes Dense bodies of platelets Granules of schwann cells There are giant primary granules in neutrophils and other granules bearing cells. In pigment cells called melanocytes the melanosome become abnormally large so there is reduced production of melanin. Thus people with chediak Higashi syndrome have occulocutaneous albinism i. e the colour of skin, hair and eye is reduced. Abnormality in platelets produce bleeding disorders. Defective granules in schwann cells lead to neurological symptoms e. g. peripheral neuropathy. Most children with chediak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage of the disorder known as accelarated phase (lymphoma like stage). This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection (E. B. virus). In the accelarated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs. The accelarated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections and organ failure. They are usually life threatening and lead to death.",

Two methods are commonly used to sterilize culture media? I ). Autoclaving - Constituents like water, salts and supplements like peptone, ttyptose etc., which are heat stable, are autoclaved. - Generally autoclaving is carried out at 121degC and at a pressure of 15 psi. - The time required for sterilization depends upon the volume of medium in the vessel? a) For small volumes of liquids (100 ml or less), the time required for autoclaving is 15-20min. b) For large quantities (2-4 liter) 30-40 min is required. 2) Membrane filteration - Constituents like serum, trypsin, growth factors, proteins, amino acids, vitamins, hormones, carbohydrates and plant extracts are thermolabi le and may decompose during autoclaving. - These must be sterilized by filteration. - The porosity of the filter membrane should be no longer than 0. 2 microns (U m). - Empty glassware that is to hold media must be sterilized in an autoclave before filter sterilization.. These two ( autoclaving and membrane filteration) are the most commonly used methods for sterilization of culture media. But when these are not available other methods can be used; e. g.? - For media containing sugar or gelatin, an exposure of 100degC for 20 minutes on three successive days may be used. This is known as Tyndallization. - Some media containing serum or egg fluid can be sterilized by heating to 80-85degC for 2-4 hours.",

This is the first serological test used for diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. It becomes positive 2-3 weeks after infection. It is a complement mediated neutralising antigen - antibody reaction. Also Know: Trichinosis is caused by Trichinella spiralis and is diagnosed using an intradermal test Bachman test. Trichuriasis is caused by Trichuris trichiura. Diagnosis depends on the demonstration of characteristic egg in faeces. Ref: Paniker's Textbook of parasitology, 6th Ed, Page 102.",

This technique allows for a presumptive diagnosis of syphilis even before antibodies have developed. Although, unstained living organisms may be observed with an ordinary light microscope, they are seen much more clearly and with a better resolution with a dark ground microscope, which has an optical system that enhances the contrast of unstained bodies. Principle of dark ground microscopy: The dark ground microscope creates a contrast between the object and the surrounding field, such that, the background is dark and the object is bright. The objective and the ocular lenses used in the dark ground microscope are the same as in the ordinary light microscope, however, a special condenser is used, which prevents the transmitted light from directly illuminating the specimen. Only oblique scattered/reflected light reaches the specimen and passes onto the lens system causing the object to appear bright against a dark background Transmitted light is used in the ordinary microscope.",

Other test used to diagnose hydatid disease are: Antigen detection test: Antigen in urine can be detected by counter current immunoelectrophoresis. Antigen in serum can be detected by ELISA, counter current immunoelectrophoresis, co-agglutination test, and latex agglutination test. Detection of antibody: By indirect haemagglutination test, fluorescent antibody test, counter current immunoelectrophoresis, latex agglutination test, ELISA, western blot test. MRI, Ultrasonography and CT scanning readily demonstrate cysts. The most pathognomonic finding, if demonstrable, is the presence of daughter cysts within the larger cyst.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., VDRL. Neurological symptoms in a patient with history of untreated ulcer 3 years back suggests the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. To fuher clear the doubts, all the given options are serological tests for syphilis. So, the examiner is asking about the syphilis for sure.. It has alreadys been explained that for monitoring of response of therapy non specific serological tests (VDRL or RPR) are used as the specific treponemal tests remain positive inspite of treatment. Now question arises, whether to use VDRL or RPR as both the options are there in this question. Following statement will clear your doubts? \" The VDRL ( a standard test) will often indicate cure as measured by negative serologies by 12 months after therapy, whereas the RPR shows only 50% seroconversion i. e. negative serology at one year\"....................... Annals on internal medicine Like VDRL test RPR test can also be used to monitor the treatment in syphilis but it is not suitable for testing C. S. F., so it cannot be used in neurosyphilis.. Titres are not interchangable between different test types. Hence, the same non-treponemal test should be used for follow up. e. g. if one has used VDRL at first follow up, then VDR1 should be used at every follow up. You should also keep in mind that though after adequate treatment of syphilis non treponemal tests (non specific tests) eventually become non-reactive. Sometimes even with sufficient treatment patients have a persistent low level positive nontreponemal test, reffered to as a serofast reaction.",

It is a very stable medium and can be stored for use in screw capped containers. It is a semi-solid transpo medium. At least two swabs should be inoculated. Alternative transpo media for vibrio cholera are Venkataraman-Ramakrishnan medium (V-R fluid) or alkaline peptone water. VR fluid should be prepared in 30 ml (1 oz) screw capped bottles (Mac. Caney bottles). It preserves vibrios for more than 6 weeks and has also proved to be very convenient medium for transpoation as it can be kept at room temperature after collection of specimen. If none of the transpo medium is available, collect watery stool from suspected cholera case by soaking blotting paper strip in the stool, sealing the strip in a polythene bag or an aiight container where the strip does not dry. The moist blotting paper strip can then be transpoed to the laboratory. Blotting papers have been found to be superior to the filter paper as the former can soak more moisture and retain the same over longer periods thus maintaining the bility of vibrios absorbed on it.",

The most common form of anthrax is cutaneous anthrax which is usually occurred injured skin or musous membrane Cutaneous anthrax Cutaneous anthrax usually begins 2-5 days after inoculation of spores into an exposed pa of the body typically the forearm or the hand. The initial lesion is an erythematous papule which may be mistaken. for insect bite.

D: Infectious Mononucleosis The standard diagnostic procedure for infectious mononucleosis is the Paul-Bunnell test Heterophile antibody tests Such as the Paul Bunnell or Monospot tests may be used in the diagnosis of glandular fever/ infectious mononucleosis. Heterophil antibodies have the ability to agglutinate red blood cells of different animal species. The Paul-Bunnell test uses sheep erythrocytes; the Monospot test, horse red cells. For infectious mononucleosis, the standard diagnostic procedure is the Paul-Bunnel test IgM heterophil antibodies are usually detectable for the first 3 months of infection. Characteristically, they are able to agglutinate sheep erythrocytes; it is absorbed by ox red blood cell but not guinea-pig kidney cells. Infectious mononucleosis Infectious mononucleosis occurs with infection by the Epstein-Barr virus. A similar condition can be caused by cytomegalovirus, but that one gives a negative on the heterophile antibody test. The infection is spread saliva and has an incubation period of 4-7 weeks. Symptoms usually persist for 2-3 weeks, The virus replicates first within epithelial cells in the pharynx (which causes pharyngitis, or sore throat), and later primarily within B cells (which are invaded their CD21). The host immune response involves cytotoxic (CD8-positive) T cells against infected B lymphocytes, resulting in enlarged atypical lymphocytes (Downey cells). When the infection is acute (recent onset, instead of chronic), heterophile antibodies are produced The most commonly used diagnostie-criterion is the presence of 50% lymphocytes with at least 10% atypical lymphocytes (large, irregular nuclei), while the person also has fever, pharyngitis and adenopathy. The atypical lymphocytes resembled monocytes when they were first discovered, thus the term \"mononucleosis\" was coined. The presence of splenomegaly, posterior cervical adenopathy, axillary adenopathy, and inguinal adenopathy are the most useful to suspect a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. On the other hand, the absence of cervical adenopathy and fatigue are the most useful to dismiss the idea of infectious mononucleosis as the correct diagnosis. Elevated hepatic transaminase levels is highly suggestive of infectious mononucleosis, occurring in up to 50% of patients. A fibrin ring granuloma may be present",

The Echinostomida are members of the class Trematoda, the flukes. The fluke differs from most species that parasitise large mammals, in that they inhabit the gut rather than the liver as Fasciola species do. Fasciolopsis buski generally occupies the upper region of the small intestine, but in heavy infestations can also be found in the stomach and lower regions of the intestine.

Carrier state is more common in females (cases are more common in males). Fecal carriers are more frequent than urinary carriers but urinary carriers are more dangerous. Urinary carrier state is often associated with some abnormality of the urinary tract. Fecal carrier stage is more common in patients with biliary abnormality and GI malignancy. Diagnosis of carriers: - Demonstration of Vi antigen Isolation of S. typhi by sewer swab technique. Treatment: - Ampicilin (4-6 g a day) together with probenecid for 6 week.

The sandfly vector becomes infected when feeding on the blood of an infected individual or an animal reservoir host. The leishmania parasites live in the macrophages as round, non-motile amastigotes (3-7 micrometers in diameter). The macrophages are ingested by the fly during the blood- meal and the amastigotes are relesed into the stomach of insect. Almost immediately the amastigotes transform in to the motile, elongated (10-20 micrometers), flagellate promastigote form. The promastigotes then migrate to the alimentary tract of the fly, where they live extracellularly and multiply by binary fission. Four to five days after feeding the promastigotes move forward to the oesophagus and the salivary glands of the insect. When the sandlfy next feeds on a mammalian host, it's proboscis pierces the skin and saliva containing anticoagulant is injected into the wound to prevent the blood from clotting, the leishmania promastigotes are transferred to the host along with the saliva. Once in the host the promastigotes are taken up by the macrophages where they rapidly reve to the amastigote form. The leishmania are able to resist the microbiocidal action of the acid hydrolases release form the lysozymes and so survive and multiply inside the macrophages, eventually leading to the lysis of the macrophages. The released amastigotes are taken up by additional macrophages and so the cycle continues. Ultimately all the organs containing macrophages and phagocytes are infected, especially the spleen, liver and bone marrow.",

The stationary phase occurs when nutrient depletion or toxic products cause growth to slow until the number of new cells produced balances the number of cells that die, resulting in a steady state.

These viruses are nonenveloped and have an icosahedral nucleocapsid that contains positive-sense RNA.

Ohomyxoviruses undergo transcription and RNA replication in the nucleus of the host cell because they need to cannibalize the capped 5' termini of cellular RNAs for use as primers for viral m. RNA transcription. For most DNA viruses, transcription and DNA replication occur in the nucleus of the host cell.

Which of the following receptors is most likely involved?",
        "exp": "HIV infection does not always progress to ove AIDS. In a few founate individuals (called non-progressors), the infection remains asymptomatic, with a stable CD4 cell count and low or undetectable viremia. It is not entirely clear whether these patients will eventually develop AIDS. Some are resistant to HIV infection because they carry two defective copies of the gene encoding the CCR5 coreceptor. There are 15 known coreceptors, of which CCR5 and CXCR4 are the best characterized. CCR5 is a receptor for b-chemokines and serves as a coreceptor for HIV internalization. Approximately one percent of Caucasians in the U. S. is homozygous for such a protective CCR5 variant, and 20% are heterozygotes. HIV infection follows a slower course in heterozygotes. Homozygotes for this protective CCR5 variant are not present among Black and Asian populations. Recently, a variant haplotype of CXCR1 (a leukocyte receptor for fractalkine) has been linked to rapid progression of HIV infection in homozygous individuals. Thus, investigations on HIV coreceptors are beginning to explain the variability in progression and severity of HIV infection among individuals. CD4 (2nd Choice) is an impoant receptor of helper T lymphocytes, macrophages, and Langerhans cells. It acts as the primary receptor for HIV binding. Binding to CD4, however, is not sufficient for the entry of HIV into the cells. The viral envelope gp120 protein (4th Choice) first binds CD4. This results in a conformational change in gp120 that allows this protein to bind coreceptors. Such coreceptors are present on lymphocytes and macrophages and normally serve as binding sites for chemokines. Once gp120 binds to CD4 and a coreceptor, a second viral protein, gp41, facilitates fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane, allowing \"injection\" of the viral core into the cell. Neither CD8 (5th Choice) nor the receptor for TNF-a plays a role in HIV binding to cells.",

ETEC also produce diarrhea in infants native to these countries, where they are a leading cause of morbidity and moality during the first 2 years of life. Repeated bouts of diarrhea caused by ETEC and other infectious agents are an impoant cause of growth retardation, malnutrition, and developmental delay in third-world countries where ETEC are endemic. ETEC disease is rare in industrialized nations, although recent outbreaks suggest that it may be underestimated. Also Know: Transmission is by consumption of food and water contaminated by infected human or convalescent carriers. ETEC diarrhea is caused by strains of E coli that produce LT and/or ST enterotoxins in the proximal small intestine. Strains that elaborate both LT and ST cause more severe illness. Adherence to surface microvilli mediated by the colonizing factor (CF) pili is essential for the efficient delivery of toxin to the target enterocytes. LT and/or ST cause fluid outpouring in small intestine. Infections with ETEC can stimulate immunity. This natural immunity is presumably mediated by s. IgA specific for LT and CFs. Ref: Ray C.

Macrophages do not activate cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes. The major activator of cytotoxic CD8 T lymphocytes is IL-2 from CD4+ THl cells. Delayed hypersensitivity reactions are the results of CD4+ TH1 cells. These cells do not produce antibody. They secrete gamma interferon and interleukin 2 (IL-2), stimulating more cells to become involved in the delayed hypersensitivity reaction. The cells that paicipate in lysis of virus infected cells are cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes that react with MHC class I molecules containing epitopes of the virus from the infected cell.

What is the most likely source of the Fusobacterium?",
        "exp": "Anaerobic lung abscesses commonly arise from aspirated oral secretions in patients with compromised neurological status (e. g., anesthesia, coma, intoxication), or in individuals with a depressed cough reflex. The most common anaerobic organisms isolated from lung abscesses include Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Peptococcus species, all of which are typical oral flora. Bloodborne pathogens producing lung abscesses probably originate as emboli from vegetations on the right heart. The most likely pathogens in endocarditis are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species; Fusobacterium would be very unusual. Fusobacterium usually is not pathogenic and lives in a commensal relationship with the host. Infective aerosols generally contain organisms that are intrinsically pathogenic (e. g., mycobacteria, influenza virus). It is the acidity of the gastric aspirate that most seriously injures the lung, not the gastric bacteria. Fusobacterium do inhabit the gastrointestinal tract, but ble bacteria are much more likely to be transmitted from the oral secretions than from the stomach. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013). Chapter 21.

S. pyogenes is differentiated from the other beta-hemolytic Strep by its sensitivity to the antibiotic bacitracin. The catalase test is used to differentiate Staphylococci from Streptococci. Staphylococci are catalase positive, Streptococci are catalase negative. So, S. pyogenes would be catalase negative. The coagulase test is used to differentiate Staph aureus from the other Staph spp. Staph aureus is coagulase positive; the others are negative.

The parasite is transmitted through the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito and causes the disease's most dangerous form, falciparum malaria. Unlike those of other Plasmodium species, the gametocytes of P. falciparum are elongated and crescent-shaped, by which they are sometimes identified. A mature gametocyte is 8-12 \u03bcm long and 3-6 \u03bcm wide. Haemozoin is a disposal product formed from the digestion of blood by some blood-feeding parasites, the hematophagous organisms such as malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.). In Plasmodium the food vacuole fills with hemozoin crystals, which are about 100-200 nanometres long and each contain about 80, 000 heme molecules. Detoxification through bio-crystallization is distinct from the detoxification process in mammals, where an enzyme called heme oxygenase instead breaks excess heme into biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide.

IL1, IL 6, TNF alpha are proinflammatory cytokines sometimes referred to as acute phase cytokines. IL 1 is produced mainly by activated macrophages, neutrophils, epithelial and endothelial cells. Two forms of IL 1 are IL 1alpha and IL 1 beta. IL 1a is cell associated whereas IL 1beta is the predominant form and is secreted by macrophages. TNF alpha acts on the hypothalamus to induce fever, can cause systemic metabolic changes, weight loss and loss of appetite, and enhance production of IL1, IL6, and chemokines and it promotes acute phase protein synthesis by the liver. At high concentrations, it elicits all of the functions leading to a septic shock. Ref: Principles of Cancer Biotherapy edited by Robe K.
