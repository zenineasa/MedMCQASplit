Pinworm (genus En terobius)/Threadworm/Seatworm, It is a nematode (roundworm) and a common human intestinal parasite, especially in children. It inhabits the caecum, appendix and adjacent poion of the ascending colon, lying closely applied to the mucosal surface It causes enterobiasis, or less precisely as oxyuriasis in reference to the family Oxyuridae. The pinworm appears as a white, small and delicate nematode. The adult female has a sharply pointed posterior end, is 8 to 13 millimeters long, and 0. 5 millimeter thick. The adult male is considerably smaller, measuring 2 to 5 millimeters long and 0. 2 millimeter thick, and has a curved posterior end. The eggs are translucent and have a surface that adheres to environmental objects. The eggs measure 50 to 60 micrometers by 20 to 30 micrometers, and have a thick shell that is flattened on one side. The small size and colorlessness of the eggs make them invisible to the naked eye, except in barely visible clumps of thousands of eggs. Eggs may contain a developing embryo or a fully developed pinworm larva. Inside the host, the larvae grow to 140-150 micrometers in length Pinworms spread through human-to-human transmission, by ingesting (i. e., swallowing) infectious pinworm eggs and/or by anal sex. The eggs are hardy and can remain ble (i. e., infectious) in a moist environment for up to three weeks. They do not tolerate heat well, but can survive in low temperatures: two-thirds of the eggs are still ble after 18 hours at -8 degrees Celsius (18 degF). After the eggs have been initially deposited near the anus, they are readily transmitted to other surfaces through contamination. The surface of the eggs is sticky when laid, and the eggs are readily transmitted from their initial deposit near the anus to fingernails, hands, night-clothing and bed linen. From here, eggs are fuher transmitted to food, water, furniture, toys, bathroom fixtures and other objects. Household pets often carry the eggs in their fur, while not actually being infected. Dust containing eggs can become airborne and widely dispersed when dislodged from surfaces, for instance when shaking out bed clothes and linen. Consequently the eggs can enter the mouth and nose through inhalation, and be swallowed later. Although pinworms do not strictly multiply inside the body of their human host, some of the pinworm larvae may hatch on the anal mucosa, and migrate up the bowel and back into the gastrointestinal tract of the original host. This process is called retroinfection. Despite the limited, 13 week lifespan of individual pinworms, autoinfection (i. e., infection from the original host to itself), either through the anus-to-mouth route or through retroinfection, causes the pinworms to inhabit the same host indefinitely",

A pruritic papule develops 1-7 days after entry of the organisms and rapidly changes into a necrotic ulcer. The lesion is called a malignant pustule. The anthrax bacillus is Gram positive and nonacid fast. The spores do not stain by ordinary methods. When blood films containing anthrax bacilli are stained with polychrome methylene blue for a few seconds and are examined under microscope, an amorphous purplish material is noticed around the bacilli. This represents the capsular material and is characteristic of the anthrax bacillus. This is called \"Mc. Fadyean's reaction\" and is employed for the presumptive diagnosis of anthrax.

Mycobacterium leprae is transmitted by prolonged contact with patients with lepromatous leprosy, who discharge M. leprae in large numbers in nasal secretions and from skin lesions. 2 forms of leprosy are: Tuberculoid and Lepromatous. In tuberculoid type: CMI response to the organism limits its growth, very few acid-fast bacilli are seen, and granulomas containing giant cells form. In lepromatous leprosy: CMI response to organism is poor, the skin and mucous membrane lesions contain large numbers of organisms, foamy histiocytes rather than granulomas are found, and the lepromin skin test result is negative.

This means they can survive only by establishing residence inside Animal cells They need their host's ATP as an energy source for their own cellular activity. They are energy parasites using a Cell membrane transport system that uses ATP from the host system and gives out ADP. This obligate intracellular existence makes it impossible to culture these organisms on nonliving artibacterial media. Due to their small size and failure to grow in cell - free media they were considered to be viruses. Chlamydiae grows in cultures of a variety of eukaryotic cell lines Me Coy or He. La cells. It may be necessary to Treat cells with poly anionic compounds such as DEAD-dextran to reduce the electrostatic barrier to infection. Antimetabolite such as cycloheximide is added to favour competition for host cell amino acid pools. All types of Chlamydiae proliferate in embryonated eggs particularly in the yolk sac. The special features in structure and chemical composition of chlamydiae are The outer cell wall resembles the cell wall of gram negative bacteria It has a relatively high lipid content It is rigid but it does not contain typical bacterial peptidoglycan; perhaps it contains a Tetrapeptide linked matrix. N Acetyl muramic acid also appears to be absent from chlamydiae cell wall Antibiotic susceptibility of chlamydiae. Penicillin binding proteins occur in chlamydiae cell wall and chlamydiae cell wall formation is inhibited by penicillins And other drugs that inhibit transpeptidation of bacterial peptidoglycan. But remember the important point about t/t, That cell wall inhibitors result in the production of morphologically defective forms but are not effective in clinical Disease. \u2022 Inhibitors of protein synthesis (tetracyclines, erythromycins) are effective in most clinical infections.

The germinal layer is the site of asexual reproduction. It also secretes the hydatid fluid which fills the cavity. The fluid is clear, colourless / pale yellow with a pH of 6. 7 containing salts and protein. It is a good antigen which sensitises the host. The fluid was used as the antigen for Casoni's intradermal test and other diagnostic serological tests. From the germinal layer, small knob like excrescences / gemmules protrude into the lumen of the cyst. These enlarge and become vacuolated and filled with fluid. These are called brood capsules. They are initially attached to the germinal layer by a stalk, but later escapes free into the fluid filled cyst cavity. From the inner wall of brood capsule, protoscolices develop, which represent head of adult worm, complete with invaginated scolex, bearing suckers and hooklets. Each of these are potential tapeworm. Many of the scolices float free in the cyst fluid. These with free brood capsules are called hydatid sand. Ref: Paniker's Textbook of parasitology, 6th Ed page 151.",

It is a major agent of schistosomiasis; more specifically, it is associated with urinary schistosomiasis. Adults are found in the Venous plexuses around the urinary bladder and the released eggs traverse the wall of the bladder causing haematuria and fibrosis of the bladder. The bladder becomes calcified, and there is increased pressure on ureters and kidneys otherwise known as hydronephrosis. Inflammation of the genitals due to S. haematobium may contribute to the propagation of HIV. Studies have shown the relationship between S. haematobium infection and the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder Life cycle The female fluke lays as many as 30 eggs per day which migrate to the lumen of the urinary bladder and ureters. The eggs are eliminated from the host into the water supply with micturition. In fresh water, the eggs hatch forming free swimming miracidia which penetrate into the intermediate snail host (Bulinus spp., e. g. B. globosus, B. forskalii, B. nyassanus and B. truncatus). Inside the snail, the miracidium sheds it epithelium and develops into a mother sporocyst. After two weeks the mother begins forming daughter sporocysts. Four weeks after the initial penetration of the miracardium into the snail furcocercous cercariae begin to be released. The cercariae cycle from the top of the water to the bottom for three days in the search of a human host. Within half an hour the cercariae enter the host epithelium",

Transmission to humans occurs by contact with infected meat (slaughterhouse workers), placentae of infected animals (farmers, veterinarians), or ingestion of infected unpasteurized milk or cheese. The incubation period varies from a few days to several weeks. Brucellosis is a systemic infection that may become chronic. B. melitensis infections tend to be more severe and prolonged, whereas those caused by B. abous are more self-limited. After an incubation period of 1 to 3 weeks, nonspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss occur. The onset can be acute or gradual. The undulating (rising-and-falling) fever pattern that gives the disease its name occurs in a minority of patients. The treatment of choice is tetracycline plus rifampin. Prevention of brucellosis involves pasteurization of milk, immunization of animals, and slaughtering of infected animals. There is no human vaccine. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 20.

Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Spiroplasma and Anaeroplasma cannot synthesize their own cholesterol and require it as a growth factor in culture medium. Acholeplasma synthesizes carotenol as a substitute for cholesterol, but will incorporate cholesterol if it is provided. Insensitive to cell-wall active antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins. Limited biosynthetic capabilities due to a small genome. Multiply by binary fission. However, cytoplasmic division may lag behind genome division. This results in the formation of multinucleate filaments and other shapes. Do not possess flagellae or pili, but some mycoplasmas including M. pneumoniae, exhibit gliding motility on liquid-covered surfaces. This is attributed to specialized tip structures that also help the organisms in the attachment to the cell. Non sporing Stain poorly with Grams stain. Can be stained with Giemsa and Dienes methods. Are considered as stable L forms by some researchers but this hypothesis is still not fully accepted. Aerobes and facultative anaerobes except Anaeroplasma which is strictly anaerobic. For primary isolation, an atmosphere of 95% Nitrogen and 5% Carbon dioxide is preferred. They can grow within a temperature range of 22-41degC, the parasitic species growing optimally at 35-37degC. For fermentative organisms, the initial pH of the medium is adjusted to 7. 3-7. 8, for arginine metabolizing organisms it should be around 7 and for ureaplasmas, range of pH should be 6-6. 5.

For unknown reasons, the coronary aeries of transplanted heas undergo intimal thickening associated with hyperplasia of myocytes and fibroblasts and deposition of matrix. This results in luminal stenosis and myocardial ischemia. Patients may develop myocardial infarction, which is clinically silent because the hea is denervated. The overall survival after hea transplantation is 80% at 1 year and 60% at 5 years. Do not confuse graft aeriosclerosis with graft atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is caused by accumulation of cholesterol esters and development of atheromas. Atherosclerosis may recur in the coronary aeries of transplanted heas, but is not a limiting factor in long-term success of hea transplantation. Allograft rejection is ceainly a major postoperative problem. However, thanks to early diagnosis based on periodic endomyocardial biopsy and the availability of immunosuppressant therapy, this complication can be prevented or successfully treated. Although oppounistic infections and development of Epstein-Barr related lymphomas are undesired effects of profound immunosuppression, these complications do not constitute a significant limitation to the overall outcome of cardiac transplantation.

It typically produces watery diarrhea that progress to bloody diarrhea after a few hours to few days. Fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting are associated complaints. Mechanism of enterohemorrhagic colitis appears to be vascular endothelial damage that leads to platelet aggregation and initiation of the coagulation cascade.

Coagulase (free coagulase) - Acts along with a coagulase reacting factor (CRF) in plasma. - Eight type of coagulase have been identified, most human strains form coagulase A. - Most constant association of virulence is production of enzyme coagulase and to lesser extent with mannitol fermentation.. Heat stable nuclease (DNAase) is a characteristic feature of staph aureus.. Staphylococcus produces five cytolytic toxins, consisting of four hemolysins (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) and a leucocidin.. a - hemolysin is the most impoant hemolysin.. Beta - hemolysin is a sphingomyelinase. It exhibits a hot-cold phenomenon, the hemolysis being initiated at 37degC, but becoming evident only after chilling.. Leucocidin is also called the Panton-valentine toxin.. Staphylococcal leucocidin and gamma lysin have been grouped as synergohymenotropic toxins.. Toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST) and enterotoxins are superantigens which are potent activators of T lymphocytes and lead to an excessive and dysregulated immune response with release of cytokines IL-1, IL-2, TNF-a and IFN - y.. Enterotoxin is responsible for food poisoning.. Exfoliative (epidermolytic toxin) - Responsible for staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (S. S. S.

The first example of alternate pathway was that of properdin system as a group of serum proteins contributing to antimicrobial defence without requiring specific antibodies.

Graft versus host disease occurs most commonly in the setting of allogenic bone marrow transplantation but may also follow transplantation of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e. g. the liver) or transfusion of unirradiated blood. Recipients of bone marrow transplants are immunodeficient because of either their primary disease or prior treatment of the disease with drugs or irradiation. When such recipients receive normal bone marrow cells from allogenic donors, the immunocompetent, T cells present in the donor marrow recognizes the recipient's HLA antigen as foreign antigen and react against them. Both CD4+ and CD8+T cells recognize and attack host tissues. In clinical practice GVH can be so severe that bone marrow transplants are done only between ILIA matched donor and recipient. Acute GVH disease occurs within days to weeks after allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Although any organ may be affected, the major clinical manifestation results from involvement of the immune system and epithelia of the skin, liver and intestines. Involvement of the skin in GVH disease is manifested by a generalized rash leading to desquamation in severe cases. Destruction of small bile ducts gives rise to jaundice and mucosal ulceration of the gut results in bloody diarrhoea. Immunodeficiency is a frequent accompaniment of GVH disease. The immunodeficiency may be a result of prior treatment, myeloablative preparation for the graft, a delay in repopulation of the recipient's immune system and attack on host's immune cells by grafted lymphocytes. Affected individuals are profoundly immunosuppressed and are easy prey to infections. Although many different types of organisms may infect patients, infection with cytomegalovirus is paicularly impoant.",

What type of animal is the most likely source of the infection?",
        "exp": "This patient has the classic symptoms of cat scratch disease caused by the bacillus Baonella henselae. The disease is self-limited with the onset of symptoms occurring 3-10 days following an inoculating scratch. The organism can be isolated from kittens, typically less than 1 year of age, or from fleas. A history of a new kitten in the house and the papule at the site of a scratch with regional painful adenopathy defines the classic scenario. Chickens can harbor Salmonella spp. producing a gastroenteritis or enterocolitis. Chicken guano is also a orable environment for the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. The mycelial phase thrives in the rich soil. The human disease is a granulomatous infection involving the lungs and mimicking tuberculosis. Dogs or puppies carry Capnocytophaga canimorsus as pa of the normal flora of the oral cavity. Infections from licking or biting range from a self-severe infections are those with asplenia, alcoholism, or hematologic malignancies. This organism is also associated with cat bites, but the patient develops cellulitis and fulminant septicemia, especially in asplenic patients. Pasteurella multocida is another pathogen that colonizes the nasopharynx and gastrointestinal tract of cats and dogs. Cats have the highest rate of colonization (50-90%), followed by dogs (50%), swine (50%), and rats (14%). P. multocida most commonly causes a localized soft tissue infection or cellulitis after an animal bite, but systemic symptoms may be present in about 40% of the cases. These symptoms include osteomyelitis, septic ahritis, or tenosynovitis. Horses and horse manure have been associated with a pulmonary oppounistic infection with cavitation caused by Rhodococcus equi that resembles tuberculosis in immunocompromised patients. Burkholderia mallei (the cause of glanders) is characterized by non-caseating granulomatous abscesses of skin, lymphadenopathy, and pronounced involvement of the lungs. Ref: Levinson W. (2012).

        "question": "About H. Influenza all true except a. EUR'",
        "exp": "Capsular polypeptide protein is responsible for virulence Hemophilus Infl uenzae Hemophilus influenzae is a grain negative rod. The name hemophilus influenzae shows some of its features. Hemophilus means \"blood loving\" This organism requires blood containing medium. for growth H. influenzae requires 2 erythrocyte factors for growth. Factor X hemin --> It is required, for synthesis of cytochrome Factor V nicotinanti- --> It is essential for oxidation de adenine dinucleotide reduction In the laboratory it is usually grown on chocolate blood agar which is prepared by adding blood to an agar base at 80degC. The heat releases X and V factors from the RBC and turn the medium a chocolate brown colour. Pathogenesis:? The pathogenesis of H. influenzae infection is not completely understood although the presence of type B polysaccharids capsule is known to be the major factor in virulence. H. influenzae does not secrete any exotoxins, the polysaccharide capsule is considered to be the major factor in virulence. -There are \"6\" types of capsule designated a, b, c, d, e and f of these type \"b\" is conunonly associated with invasive Hemophilus influaenzae disease in children. The polysaccharide capsule of type 'b' strain is composed of ribose ribitol and phosphate \"(PRP)\" capsule and is the proven determinance of virulence. The \"PRP capsule\" exes its effect in the following way:? It is antiphagocytic It does not induce the alternative complement pathway This allows the bacterium to invade the blood or cerebrospinal. fluid without attracting phagocytes or provoking an inflammatory response and complement mediated bacteriolysis. For this reason anticapsular antibody which promotes both phagocytosis and lysis of bacteria is the main factor in immune defense against H. influenzae infection. Non typable or nonencapsulated strains of bacteria are less virulent. They lack the invasiveness of their capsulated strains and can only cause local reactions. They frequently cause otitis media in children as well as respiratory disease in adults weakned by preexisting lung disease such as chronic bronchitis from smoking or recent viral influenza infection. Hemophilus influenzae is associated with two types of infection -Invasive infections - Non invasive infections Host defenses Host defenses include the:- - Activation of the alternative and classical complement pathways and - Antibodies to the PRP capsule H. influenzae is susceptible to lysis by antibody and complement. Antibodies to the Hib capsule plays the primary role in conferring immunity against H. influenzae. These bactericidal antibody directed against PRP capsule of H. influenzae type h is entirely responsible for host resistance. Newborns have low risk of infection The mother possesses antibodies against the \"b\" capsule which she has acquired in her life time. She passes these antibodies to the fetus transplacentally and in her breast milk. These passively acquired antibodies last for about 6 months as a result infants are immune to H Influenzae infections. When these transplacental antibodies to the capsule wane infants are at high risk for developing invasive H. influenzae disease. It takes 3-5 years of hemophilus influenzae colonization and infection for children to develop their own antibodies. So there is a \"window\" during which children are prone to be infected with hemophilus influenzae.",

Echocardiography and blood cultures suggest a diagnosis of acute bacterial endocarditis limited to the tricuspid valve. Which of the following is the most probable etiology?",
        "exp": "The most probable etiology of bacterial endocarditis involving the tricuspid valve is illicit intravenous drug use, which can introduce skin organisms into the venous system that then attack the tricuspid valve. Staphylococcus aureus accounts for between 60% and 90% of cases of endocarditis in intravenous drug users. The endocarditis associated with congenital heart disease typically involves either damaged valves or atrial or ventricular septal defects. The tricuspid valve is not paicularly vulnerable. Rheumatic fever most commonly damages the mitral and aoic valves, and tricuspid damage is usually less severe and seen only when the mitral and aoic valves are heavily involved. Consequently, secondary bacterial endocarditis involving only the tricuspid valve in a patient with a history of rheumatic fever would be unusual. Rheumatoid ahritis is not associated with bacterial endocarditis. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013). Chapter 14. The Streptococci, Enterococci, and Related Genera. In G. F.

After culture of the sputum, colorless, oxidase-positive colonies with a fruity aroma develop on the agar. The function of which of the following proteins is most likely inhibited by the bacteria responsible for this boy's infection?",
        "exp": "The boy is displaying the characteristic symptoms of cystic fibrosis with bronchiectasis (accounting for the foul-smelling sputum) and pancreatic insufficiency, producing steatorrhea. However, the question directly relates to the infectious agent causing the pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an oxidase-positive bacteria with a fruity aroma. P. aeruginosa is a strictly aerobic gram-negative rod that produces an exotoxin (exotoxin A) that ADP-ribosylates, and therefore inhibits, eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (e. EF-2), which is a G-protein involved in the eukaryotic translation of proteins. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conduction regulator (CFTR) protein is the product of the cystic fibrosis gene, a large 24 exon gene located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q31). This protein has two nucleotide binding domains. In 70% of the families with the disease, a three base pair deletion at codon 508 of exon 10 results in the deletion of a phenylalanine (DF508). This codon is critical for one of the nucleotide binding sites of the CF gene product, resulting in poor channel in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. The defective chloride channel leads to impaired secretion of chloride in the lumen and promotes the absorption of sodium inside the cells. Water follows, concentrating the airway secretions. The increased viscosity of the airway secretions predisposes the patient to repeated infections. A GTP-binding protein similar to the one coupled with & alpha; 2-adrenergic receptors refers to a G-protein that inhibits adenylate cyclase, lowering c. AMP. This G-protein is sensitive to Peussis toxin. A GTP-binding protein similar to the one coupled with & beta;-adrenergic receptors refers to a G-protein that stimulates adenylate cyclase, increasing c. AMP. This G-protein is sensitive to cholera toxin. Ref: Brooks G. F. (2013). Chapter 16. Pseudomonads, Acinetobacters, and Uncommon Gram-Negative Bacteria. In G. F.

Organic matter tends to absorb phenol and lowers the concentrationu available to kill microorganism. Do not get confused with the answer of previous question; phenols are not readily inactivated by organic matter, they are inactivated slowly and paly.. Ethylene oxide gas is a high level disinfectant ( not intermediate).. Gluteraldehyde has sporicidal activity and hypochlorite (chlorine) has virucidal activity.. Option 'c' requires detailed explanation. Categories of effective potency. Sterilants:- are capable of completely eliminating or destroying in all forms of microbial life, including spores.. Disinfectants:- Destroy some, but not necessarily all organisms. The category is fuher divided into subcategories:- i) High level disinfectants:- In their usual concentration and contact period, they destroy all microorganisms, with exception of high number of bacterial spores ( small number of spores can be destroyed). It is woh noting that at higher concentrations and prolonged contact period, high level disinfectant can act as steriliant, i. e. can kill high numbers of spores as well. Examples are:-2% gluteraldehyde, 8% formaldehyde, 6-10% hydrogen peroxide and ethylene oxide gas. ii) Intermediate level disinfectants:- Inactivate even resistant organisms such as mycobacterium tuberculosis as well as vegetative bacteria, most viruses and most fungi, but do not necessarily kill bacterial spores. Examples are:-0. 5% iodine, 70-90% ethanol and isopropanol, chlorine compounds (hypochlorite), some phenolic compounds and iodophor based disinfectants. iii) Low level disinfectants:- kill most bacteria, some viruses and some fungi, but cannot be relied on to kill resistant microorganisms such as tubercular bacilli or bacterial spores. Examples are:- quaerly ammonium compounds, mercurials, some phenolic compounds and iodophores.

F. suggests meningeal involvement Spread of infection and immune response in lyme disease Borrelia burgdorferi is transmitted to humans the bite of ixodes tick vector Borrelia burgdorferi is inoculated in the skin, where local replication takes place locally and outward migration in the dermis occurs. Days to week after the tick bite, hematogenous dissemination to secondary sites (like joints, hea eye, nervous system) takes place. If untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of anti. Borrelia burgodorferi antibodies by the immune system. The following mechanisms have been described - i) Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. - This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish the. infection. ii) Once inside the body, Borrelia burgdorferi become; a stealth invader i. e., it changes shape. - In the tick and mice which host the bacterium through most of its life cycle, the bacterium has a thick cell wall and spiral shape. If it maintains its thick cell wall and its spiral shape, immune system can control infection. However, in the human body, it can shed its cell wall and can take a different shape. When under attack from immune system, it simply changes shape so it is not recognized. iii) Borrelia burgdorferi produces antigenic variation in a \"cell surface lipoprotein VIsE\", during the course of infection - The VIsE system presents a challenge to immune system because after an immune response is generated to one version of VISE protein, a different version is quickly produced. By using this type of antigenic variation, B. burgdorferi can escape the adaptive immune system. Lyme meningitis Meningitis (meningeal involvement) is the most common neurological event that occurs in the setting of early lyme dissemination. - In this clinical setting CSF is always abnormal and shows: 1) Pleocytosis with predominantly lymphocytosis (not polymorphonuclear leukocytosis). 2) Increased protein 3) Glucose content is usually normal, but it falls below the serum concentration in 20% of patients.

Therefore, patients at high risk of CMV retinitis (CD4+ T cell count <100/micro L) should undergo an ophthalmologic examination every 3-6 months. CMV retinitis usually presents as a painless, progressive loss of vision. Patients may also complain of blurred vision, floaters and scintillations. It is usually bilateral. The characteristic retinal appearance is presence of perivascular hemorrhage and exudate. Treatment consists of oral valacyclovir, ganciclovir, IV ganciclovir, or IV foscarnet, with cidofovir as an alternative.

M. pneumonine, which is an impoant cause of atypical pneumonia Mycoplasma is by definition restricted to veebrate hosts. Cholesterol is required for the growth of species of the genus Mycoplasma. Their optimum growth temperature is often the temperature of their host if warmbodied (e. g. 37deg C in humans) or ambient temperature if the host is unable to regulate its own internal temperature. Mycoplasmas are unusual among bacteria in that most require sterols for the stability of their cytoplasmic membrane. Sterols are acquired from the environment, usually as cholesterol from the animal host. Mycoplasmas generally possess a relatively small genome of 0. 58-1. 38 megabases Additionally they use an alternate genetic code where the codon UGA is encoding for the amino acid tryptophan instead of the usual opal stop codon. They have a low GC-content (23-40 mol %). Mycoplasma cells are physically small - less than 1 - and they are therefore difficult to detect with a conventional microscope.

As it is not transpoed across the placenta, the presence of IgM in the fetus or newborn indicates intrauterine infection and its detection is useful in the diagnosis of congenital infections such as syphilis, rubella and toxoplasmosis. It normally circulates as pentamer. It is the oldest immunoglobulin class. It is the predominant antibody in primary antibody response. It is sho lived, disappearing earlier than IgG.. Hence, its demonstration in serum indicates recent infection. Treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol selectively destroys IgM without affecting IgG. This is a simple method for the differential estimation of IgG and IgM. The isohemagglutinins (blood group anti A, anti B) are usually IgM Being largely confined to the intravascular space, IgM is believed to be responsible for protection against blood invasion by microorganisms.

Hybridomas Hybridomas are cells that have been engineered to produce a specific antibody in huge numbers To achieve this, qualities of two types of cells have to be combined together i. e. Cells which can produce large amount of pure antibody and Cells which have the ability to grow continually. These two types of cells are then fused together to form hybridoma. Procedure The pure antibody secreting cells are produced by injecting specific antigen in a mouse and obtaining the antigen specific plasma cells (antibody producing cell) from the mouse's spleen. Cell which can grow indefinitely in culture are myeloma cells (cancerous cells). These two cell lines are fused together. The hybrid cell which is thus produced can be cloned to produce large number of identical daughter clones. These daughter clone cells then produce antibodies. Since these antibodies come from only one type of cell (hybridoma cell) they are called monoclonal antibodies. HAT (hypoxanthine, Aminopterin and thymidine) medium is used for preparation of monoclonal antibodies because it allows only fused hybridoma cells to grow. It does not allow the unfused myeloma and unfused antibody cells to grow. So HAT medium is a selective medium which allows (which allow selective growth of fused hybridoma) How does this happen? Before we move on with the discussion, remember these few points about purine synthesis. Purine synthesis is essential for the survival of cells. Purine can be synthesized in two way i. e. De novo synthesis (dihydrofolate reductase enzyme is required for this pathway). Salvage pathway (an enzyme hypoxanthine - guanine phosphoribosyl transferase is required for salvage pathways) Myeloma cells lack HGPase enzyme therefore they cannot synthesize purine by salvage pathways. o Antibody cells have HGPase enzyme so they can use the salvage pathways. Aminopterin inhibits dihydrofolate reductase an enzyme used in denovo synthesis of purine When two cell lines i. e. antibody producing cell and myeloma cells are grown in HAT medium only the fused hybridoma cells survive. Myeloma cells die because they lack the enzyme HGPase so they cannot use the salvage pathways for purine synthesis. They also cannot use de-novo pathway, because Aminopterin present in the HAT medium inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (an enzyme essential for denovo synthesis ofpurine). The unfused antibody producing cells die as they cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span. Only fused hybridoma cells grow indefinitely because the antibody cell paner supplies HGPase and the myeloma paner gives it immoality. (as it is a cancer cell)",

IgG is one of the two immunoglobulins that can activate complement; IgM is the other. IgG is the immunoglobulin that opsonizes. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 59. Antibodies. In W.

B: Formaldehyde fumigation Chemical Sterilization Although heating provides the most reliable way to rid objects of all transmissible agents, it is not always appropriate, because it will damage heat-sensitive materials such as biological materials, fiber optics, electronics, and many plastics. Ethylene oxide Highly-penetrative and active against bacteria, spores and viruses - Also flammable, toxic and expensive - Leaves toxic residue on sterilised items - Instruments therefore need to be stored for prolonged period before use - Suitable for heat-sensitive items Chlorine bleach is another accepted liquid sterilizing agent. Household bleach consists of 5. 25% sodium hypochlorite. It is usually diluted to 1/10 immediately before use; however to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis it should be diluted only 1/5. Bleach will kill many organisms immediately, but for full sterilization it should be allowed to react for 20 minutes. Bleach will kill many, but not all spores. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde solutions are accepted liquid sterilizing agents, provided that the immersion time is sufficiently long. Glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde are volatile, and toxic by both skin contact and inhalation. Formaldehyde is less expensive and has a much longer shelf life if some methanol is added to inhibit polymerization to paraformaldehyde, but is much more volatile. Many vaccines, such as the original Salk polio vaccine, are sterilized with formaldehyde. Fumigation (sterilization) of operation theatres: - Seal the room with adhesive tapes round the edges of the doors/ windows and ventilators and apeures. - For Each 1000 cu. ft of space place 500m1 formaldehyde (40% solution) and 1000m1 of water in an electric boiler. Switch on the boiler, leave the room and seal the door. - Seal the room for 24 hrs. - Then open the door and neutralize any residual formaldehyde. Hydrogen peroxide and formic acid are mixed as needed in the Endoclens device for sterilization of endoscopes. This device has two independent asynchronous bays, and cleans (in warm detergent with pulsed air), sterilizes and dries endoscopes automatically in 30 minutes.",

Third generation cephalosporin is highly effective as single-dose therapy for gonorrhea. Acute urethritis is the most common clinical manifestation of gonorrhea in males. Patients usually presents with urethral discharge and dysuria, usually without urinary frequency or urgency. In women it most commonly causes mucopurulent cervicitis. Other manifestations of gonococcal infections includes gonococcal vaginitis, anorectal gonorrhea, pharyngeal gonorrhea, ocular infection and gonococcal ahritis.

        "exp": "Ans. C: Phycomycetes Phycomycetes are lower fungi which have non-septate hyphae and form endogenous asexual spores (sporangiospores) contained within sporangia Systematic classification of fungi, based on their sexual spore formation, recognizes 4 classes: Phycomycetes: Non-septate hyphae, produces sporangiospores (asexual spores), oospores and zygospores (sexual spores) Ascomycetes: Septate hyphae, Produces conidia (asexual spores) and ascospores (sexual spores) Basidiomycetes: Septate hyphae, Produces conidia (asexual spores) and basidioapores (sexual spores) Fungi imperfectii: Septate hyphae, Produces conidia (asexual spores) and Whose sexual phase has not been identified Phycomycetes It is an taxon for ceain fungi with nonseptate hyphae. These fungi are classified under Zygomycota Zygomycota/ zygote fungi, term is derived from zygosporangia, where resistant spherical spores are formed during sexual reproduction. They are mostly terrestrial in habitat, living in soil or on decaying plant or animal material. Zygomycete hyphae may be coenocytic, forming septa only where gametes are formed or to wall off dead hyphae The common example of a zygomycete is black bread mold (Rhizopus stolonifer), a member of the Mucorales. It spreads over the surface of bread and other food sources, sending hyphae inward to absorb nutrients. In its asexual phase it develops bulbous black sporangia at the tips of upright hyphae, each containing hundreds of haploid spores. As in most zygomycetes, asexual reproduction is the most common form of reproduction. Sexual reproduction in Rhizopus stolonifera, as in other zygomycetes, occurs when haploid hyphae of different mating types are in close proximity to each other. Growth of the gametangia commences after gametangia come in contact, and plasmogamy, or the fusion of the cytoplasm, occurs. Karyogamy, which is the fusion of the nuclei, follows closely after. The zygosporangia are then diploid. Zygosporangia are typically thick-walled, highly resilient to environmental hardships, and metabolically ine. When conditions improve, however, they germinate to produce a sporangium or vegetative hyphae. Meiosis occurs during germination of the zygosporagium so the resulting spores or hyphae are haploid. Grows in warm and damp conditions.",

Apparently asymptomatic babies should be monitored for subsequent development of hearing loss, mental retardation, endocrinopathies, and (rarely) progressive encephalitis.

        "exp": "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is common cause of traveler's diarrhea. It is also associated with diarrhea in infants in developing countries. It causes watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps and low grade fever. The common etiologies of traveler's diarrhea may vary with location and with season. However, on a world-wide basis, the organism most frequently identified in patients with traveler's diarrhea is enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. This organism accounts for between 30% and 70% of all cases of traveler's diarrhea. Transmission is usually through food or water that is fecally contaminated. The virulence factor implicated are as follows: Heat stable enterotoxin stimulates fluid secretion by activating guanylate cyclase in enteric epithelial cells. Heat labile exotoxin binds to the ganglioside at the brush border of epithelial cells of small intestine and leads to activation of adenylate cyclase. Colonization factors facilitate the attachment of ETEC to epithelial cells of intestine. Ref: Textbook of Microbiology ANANTHANARAYANAN, 8th Ed, page 274-277",

They are shorter and thinner than flagella Fimbriae can be seen only under the electron microscope. Fimbriae function as organs of adhesion, helping the cells to adhere firmly to particles of various kinds Fimbriated bacteria form surface pellicles in liquid media. Many fimbriated cells (for example Escherichia, Klebsiella) agglutinate red blood cells. Hemagglutination provides a simple method of detecting the presence of such fimbriae. The hemagglutination is specifically inhibited by D- mannose (mannose sensitive) A special type of fimbria is the sex pili. They are found on \u2018male' bacteria and help in the attachment of those cells to \u2018female' bacteria. They do not mediate attachment to epithelium Flagella Flagella are the organs of locomotion. Flagellum consists of three distinct parts the filament, the hook and the basal Flagella are made up of a protein (flagellin) Flagella are less than 0. 02 Jim in thickness and hence beyond the limit of resolution of the light microscope. They may, in some instances, be seen under dark ground illumination. They can be visualised by special staining techniques in which their thickness is increased by mordanting, or by electron microscopy Mesosoxnes Mesosomes (chondroid) are vesicular, convoluted or niultilaniinated structures formed as invaginations of the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. They are more prominent in Gram-positive bacteria. They are the principal sites of respiratory enzymes in bacteria and are analogous to the mitochondria of eukaryotes. Mesosomes are often seen in relation to the nuclear body and the site of synthesis of crosswall septa, suggesting that they coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic division during binary fission",

The muscles of the legs are affected more often than the arm muscles. The limb becomes floppy and lifeless - a condition known as acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). More extensive paralysis, involving the trunk and muscles of the thorax and abdomen, can result in quadriplegia. In the most severe cases (bulbar polio), poliovirus attacks the motor neurons of the brain stem - reducing breathing capacity and causing difficulty in swallowing and speaking.

        "question": "Chediak higashi syndrome, defect is?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Fusion of lysosome Chediak higashi syndrome It is an autosomal recessive disorder. Chediak higashi syndrome is caused due to mutation in the LYST gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protien known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein plays a role in transpo of materials into lysosomes. Lysosomes contain several enzyme. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down several toxins. During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterias. Mutation in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot fuse with phagosome to form phagolysosome. Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation. As a result, most people with chediak higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections, staing in infancy or early childhood. These infections are life threatening. Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory /storage granules of various other cells are also affected. The other cells involved are - Melanosomes of melanocytes Dense bodies of platelets Granules of schwann cells There are giant primary granules in neutrophils and other granules bearing cells. In pigment cells called melanocytes the melanosome become abnormally large so there is reduced production of melanin. Thus people with chediak Higashi syndrome have occulocutaneous albinism i. e the colour of skin, hair and eye is reduced. Abnormality in platelets produce bleeding disorders. Defective granules in schwann cells lead to neurological symptoms e. g. peripheral neuropathy. Most children with chediak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage of the disorder known as accelarated phase (lymphoma like stage). This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection (E. B. virus). In the accelarated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs. The accelarated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections and organ failure. They are usually life threatening and lead to death.",

It never reaches 90%. Transmission of HIV 1. Sexual transmission. Most common mode of transmission.. Most common mode of infection is heterosexual transmission.. Anal intercourse > vaginal intercourse > oral sex. Male to female transmission > female to male transmission. 2. Blood and blood products. Whole blood, packed RBCs, platelets, leukocytes and plasma all can transmit the infection.. Hyperimmune gammaglobulin, hepatitis B immune globulin, plasma derived hepatitis B vaccine and Rh immune globulin are not associated with transmission.. Fresh frozen plasma or clotting factors can also transmit the infection.. Other modes are: - Aificial insemination (by semen) - Organ transplantation - Intravenous drug abuse 3. Occupational transmission. Due to exposure with needles or other sharp medical instruments. 4. Maternal-fetal / infant transmission Probability of transmission of HIV from mother to infant/fetus ranges from 15 to 25% in industrialized countries and from 25 to 35% in developing countries.. HIV can be transmitted from mother to fetus/infant in the following ways: a). In utero (During pregnancy) b). During delivery (Perinatal) Most common c). After bih by breast feeding Least common.. First - born twin is more commonly infected than the second twin.. Cesarean section results in decrease transmission to the infant.. Vit. A deficiency increases the risk of transmission.. The major risk factor of transmission is the presence of high maternal level of plasma viremia. 5. Other less common modes of transmission. Human bite. From infected children to mother during breast feeding. There is some confusion regarding choice B. The definitive diagnosis of HIV injection in children born to HIV infected mother is difficult because infected mothers transmit IgG Ab to the newborn transplacentally. Children born to infected mothers are usually Ab positive at bih but only 15-30% are actually infected.. These antibodies remain at significant level until 18 months. IgG Ab test are not reliable indicators of infection status in a child before 18 months.. But now tests are available that can diagnose definite HIV infection even in new born. These are:.

Two methods are commonly used to sterilize culture media? I ). Autoclaving - Constituents like water, salts and supplements like peptone, ttyptose etc., which are heat stable, are autoclaved. - Generally autoclaving is carried out at 121degC and at a pressure of 15 psi. - The time required for sterilization depends upon the volume of medium in the vessel? a) For small volumes of liquids (100 ml or less), the time required for autoclaving is 15-20min. b) For large quantities (2-4 liter) 30-40 min is required. 2) Membrane filteration - Constituents like serum, trypsin, growth factors, proteins, amino acids, vitamins, hormones, carbohydrates and plant extracts are thermolabi le and may decompose during autoclaving. - These must be sterilized by filteration. - The porosity of the filter membrane should be no longer than 0. 2 microns (U m). - Empty glassware that is to hold media must be sterilized in an autoclave before filter sterilization.. These two ( autoclaving and membrane filteration) are the most commonly used methods for sterilization of culture media. But when these are not available other methods can be used; e. g.? - For media containing sugar or gelatin, an exposure of 100degC for 20 minutes on three successive days may be used. This is known as Tyndallization. - Some media containing serum or egg fluid can be sterilized by heating to 80-85degC for 2-4 hours.",
