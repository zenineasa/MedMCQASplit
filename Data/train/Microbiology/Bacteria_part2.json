        "exp": "An understanding of normal, or indigenous, microflora is essential in order to appreciate the abnormal. Usually, anatomic sites contiguous to mucous membranes are not sterile and have characteristic normal flora. The skin flora differs as a function of location. Skin adjacent to mucous membranes may share some of the normal flora of the GI system. Overall, the predominant bacteria on the skin surface are S. epidermidis and Propionibacterium, an anaerobic diphtheroid. The mouth is part of the GI tract, but its indigenous flora shows some distinct differences. While anaerobes are present in large numbers, particularly in the gingival crevice, the eruption of teeth at 6 to 9 months of age leads to colonization by organisms such as S. mutans and Streptococcus sanguis, both a-hemolytic streptococci. An edentulous person loses b-hemolytic streptococci as normal flora. The GI tract is sterile at birth and soon develops characteristic flora as a function of diet. In the adult, anaerobes such as B. fragilis and Bifidobacterium may outnumber coliforms and enterococci by a ratio of 1000: 1. The colon contains 1011 to 1012 bacteria per gram of feces. Soon after birth, the vagina becomes colonized by lactobacilli. As the female matures, lactobacilli may still be predominant, but anaerobic cocci, diphtheroid, and anaerobic, gram-negative rods also are found as part of the indigenous flora. Changes in the chemical or microbiologic ecology of the vagina can have marked effects on normal flora and may promote infection such as vaginitis or vaginosis. Escherichia coli are among the most common group of gram-negative rods isolated in the laboratory. It is fairly easily identified in the laboratory. It ferments mannitol and is lactose positive. The organism is part of normal body flora but is a very efficient opportunist. Urinary tract infections are commonly caused with this organism.",

        "question": "A child was admitted to the hospital with H. influenza meningitis. Cefotaxime is preferred over ampicillin because:",
        "exp": "Ans. d. Cefotaxime is more active against beta-lactamase (Ref: Ananthanarayan 9/e p327, 8/e p331; Harrison 19/e p1011, 18/e p1228; Nelson 19/e p941, 942)\"Cefotaxime or ceftazidime is the drug of choice for the treatment of Hemophilus meningitis. Ampicillin and cotrimoxazole were popular for respiratory infections, but as plasmid-borne resistance to these drugs is now common, thus amoxicillin-clavulanate or clarithromycin is more effective. Plasmid for beta lactamase production makes them resistant. \"--Ananthanarayan 9/e p327\"Antibiotic Resistance: Most H, influenzae isolates are susceptible to ampicillin amoxicillin, but about a third produce a beta-lactamase and are therefore resistant beta-Lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) isolates have been identified that manifest resistance by production of a beta-lactam-insensitive cell wall synthesis enzyme called PBP3. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is uniformly active against H. influenzae clinical isolates except for the rare BLNAR isolates. Among macrolides azithromycin is active against about 99% of H. influenza isolates; in contrast, the activity of erythromycin and clarithromycin against H. influenzae clinical isolates is poor. H. influenzae resistance to 3rd- generation cephalosporins has not been documented. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is infrequent ([?]10%) and resistance to quinolones is believed to be rare. \"\"Initial therapy for meningitis due to Hib should consist of a cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. Administration of glucocorticoids to patients with Hib meningitis reduces the incidence of neurologic sequelae. Many infections caused by non-typable strains of H. influenzae, such as otitis media, sinusitis, and exacerbations of CO PD, can be treated with oral antimicrobial agents. Approximately 20-35% of non-typable strains produce B-lactamase (with the exact proportion depending on geographic location), and these strains are resistant to ampicillin. Several agents have excellent activity against non-typable H. influenzae, including amoxiciltin/clavulanic acid, various extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and the macrolides, azithromycin and clarithromycin. In addition to B-lactamase production, alteration of penicillin- binding proteins--a second mechanism of ampicillin resistance--has been detected in isolates of H. influenzae. \"--Harrison 19/e p 1011\"Clinically; meningitis caused by H. influenzae type b cannot be differentiated from meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Antimicrobial therapy should be administered intravenously for 7-14 days for uncomplicated cases. Cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin cross the blood-brain barrier during acute inflammation in concentrations adequate to treat H. influenzae meningitis. Intramuscular therapy with ceftriaxone is an alternative in patients with normal organ perfusion. \"--Nelson 19/e p941. Hemophilus influenzae (Pfeiffer's bacillus).

        "exp": "There are few bacteria for which antimicrobial susceptibility is highly predictable. However, some agents are the drug of choice because of their relative effectiveness. Among the three antibiotics that have been shown to treat legionellosis effectively (erythromycin, rifampin, and minocycline), erythromycin is clearly superior, even though in vitro studies show the organism to be susceptible to other antibiotics. Penicillin remains the drug of choice for S. pneumoniae and the group A streptococci, although a few isolates of penicillin-resistant pneumococci have been observed. Resistance among the pneumococci is either chromosomally mediated, in which case the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are relatively low, or plasmid-mediated, which results in highly resistant bacteria. The same is generally true for H. influenzae. Until the mid-1970s, virtually all isolates of H. influenzae were susceptible to ampicillin. There has been a rapidly increasing incidence of ampicillin-resistant isolates, almost 35 to 40% in some areas of the United States. Resistance is ordinarily mediated by b-lactamase, although ampicillin-resistant, b-lactamase-negative isolates have been seen. No resistance to penicillin has been seen in group A streptococci. C. difficile causes toxin-mediated pseudomembranous enterocolitis as well as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Pseudomembranous enterocolitis is normally seen during or after administration of antibiotics. One of the few agents effective against C. difficile is vancomycin. Alternatively, bacitracin can be used. Lyme disease, caused by B. burgdorferi, has been treated with penicillin, erythromycin, and tetracycline. Treatment failures have been observed.

Classification of streptococci based on their ability to hemolyze Red blood cells: Beta hemolytic r They completely lyse the RBC's leaving a clear zone of hemolysis around the colony. Alpha hemolytic - They only partially lyze the RBC's leaving a greenish discoloration of the culture medium surrounding the colony. This discolored area contains analysed RBC's and a green coloured metabolite of hemoglobin. Gamma hemolytic - These streptococci are unables to hemolyze the RBc's and therefore we should really not use the word hemolytic in this situation (the term non hemolytic streptococci is often used to avoid confusion). In the question the culture of the sputums yields a hemolysis colonies. So we have to look for streptococci causing a hemolysis. Streptococci causing a hemolysis are: Streptococcus pneumonia. Viridans streptococci. Enterococcus fecalis and other enterococci (group D). Now we move in the reverse direction i. e. we take each options one by one and see whether they fit in any of the above streptococci. Option 'd'It can be easily ruled out as streptococci are gram positive Option 'c'This one also falls one of favour as streptococci are catalase negative (staphylococcic are catalase positive).

        "question": "Which of the following bacteria act by increasing c. AMP.",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e. Vibrio cholera Cholera produces a potent enterotoxin known as cholera toxin. This toxin consists of five B subunits and a single A subunit and has structural, functional and antigenic similarity to heat-labile toxin expressed by strains of enterotoxigenic Escherichia colt. The A subunit of the toxin is made up of two peptides (A1 and A2), linked by a single disulphide bridge. The B subunit binds to sugar residues of ganglioside GM1on the cells lining the villi and crypt of the small intestine (V. cholera never invades the intestinal epithelium but remain within the lumen and secretes the cholera toxin). It is believed that the insertion of the B subunit into the host cell membrane forms a transmembrane channel through which a toxic A subunit can pass into the cytoplasm. The cholera enterotoxin causes the transfer of adenosine diphosphoribose (ADP ribose) from nicotinamide ademine dinucleotide (NAD} to a regulatory protein, which is part of the adenylate cyclase enzyme responsible for the generation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (c. AMP). The result is irreversible activation of adenylate cyclase and overproduction of c. AMP. This in turn causes inhibition of uptake of Na+ and Cl- ions by cells lining the villi, together with hypersecretion of Cl- and HCO3-ions. This blocks the uptake of water which normally accompanies Na+ and Cl- absorption and there is passive net outflow of water across mucosal cells leading to serious loss of water and electrolytes. Heat stable toxin of E. coli acts through c. GMP.",

        "question": "Which of the following is known as battey bacillus?",
        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Mycobacterium intercellulare. REF: Principles of Microbiology by Edward Bittar P-158. An organism was isolated from patients suffering from pulmonary disease by non tuberculous mycobacterium from a hospital in Battey in Georgia in 1957. It was called the BATTEY bacillus and was later named as the Mycobacterium avium intercellulare. THE ORGANISMMycobacterium avium complex (MAC) consists of two species: M avium and M intracellulare; because these species are difficult to differentiate, they are also collectively referred to as Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI). MAC is the atypical Mycobacterium most commonly associated with human disease. Features:* MAC is primarily a pulmonary pathogen that affects individuals who are immune compromised (eg, from AIDS, hairy cell leukemia, immunosuppressive chemotherapy).* MAC is the most common cause of infection by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in patients with AIDS. M avium is the isolate in more than 95% of patients with AIDS who develop MAC infections.* MAC lung disease occurs rarely in immunocompetent hosts. Patients with underlying lung disease or immunosuppression may develop progressive MAC lung disease. M intracellulare is responsible for 40% of such infections in immunocompetent patients. Distribution: MAC is ubiquitous in distribution. It has been isolated from fresh water and salt water worldwide. The common environmental sources of MAC include the following:* Aerosolized water* Piped hot water systems (including household and hospital water supplies). Bathrooms. House dust. Soil. Birds. Farm animals. Cigarette components (eg, tobacco, filters, paper ). Diagnosis: In patients who may have pulmonary infection with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), diagnostic testing includes acid-fast bacillus (AFB) staining and culture of sputum specimens. If disseminated MAC (DMAC) infection is suspected, culture specimens should also include blood and urine. Treatment: In general, MAC infection is treated with 2 or 3 antimicrobials for at least 12 months. Commonly used first-line drugs include macrolides (clarithromycin or azithromycin), ethambutol, and rifamycins (rifampin, rifabutin). Aminoglycosides, such as streptomycin and amikacin, are also used as additional agents. MAC lymphadenitis in children is treated with surgical excision of the affected lymph node. Also know about runyon classification: RUNYON CLASSIFICATIONThe Runyon classification of nontuberculous mycobacteria based on the rate of growth, production of yellow pigment and whether this pigment was produced in the dark or only after exposure to light. The nontuberculous mycobacteria are divided into four groups. The first three groups are classified as \"Slowly growing Mycobacteria\". RUNYON CLASSIFICATIONRunyon I organisms (photochromogens). Slow growing, and produce a yellow-orange pigment when exposed to light. Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium asiaticum, and Mycobacterium simiae. Runyon II organisms (scotochromogens). Slow-growing and produce a yellow-orange pigment regardless of whether they are grown in the dark or the light. Mycobacterium Gordonae and Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium szulgai. Runyon III organisms (nonchromogens). Slow-growing and never produce pigment, regardless of culture conditions. Mycobacterium ahum and Mycobacterium intracellulare (together known as the MAI complex). Runyon fV organisms. Rapid growing for mycobacteria (colonies in 5 days). They do not produce pigment. Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium peregrinum, Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium chelonae, Mycobacterium thermoresistibile",

It causes diarrhoea in infants and children usually occuring as institutional out breaks. It does not produce enterotoxin, nor are they invasive. They adhere to the mucosa of small intestine and cause disruption of the brush border microvilli. These strains can be identified by their adhesion to HEP - 2 cells. o Enterotoxigenic E. coli. It causes traveller's diarrhoea [ETEC is the most common cause of traveller's diarrhea). It produces enterotoxins. They can produce heat labile toxin (LT) or heat stable toxin or both. Toxin production alone may not lead to illness. The strain should first be able to adhere to intestinal mucosa. This adhesiveness is medicated by fimbrial or colonisation factor antigen (CFA). o Enteroinvasive E. coli. They themselves resemble shigella and their infection resembles shigellosis (remember: shiga like toxin is elaborated by enterohemorrhagic E. coli). They produce mild diarrhoea to frank dvsentry and occur in adult as well as in children. They have been termed enteroinvasive because they have the capacity to invade intestinal epithelial cells in vivo and penetrate He. La or HEP - 2 cells in tissue culture. This ability of penetration is plasmid determined which codes for outer membrane antigens called the Hirulence marker antigen\" (VMA). The detection of plasmid can be diagnostic. For laboratory diagnosis of EIEC, the sereny test used to be employed. These strains are non motile, do not ferment lactose or ferment it late with acid without producing any gas. o Enterohemorrhagic E. coli or verotoxigenic E. coli. These strains produce verocytotoxin (VT) or shiga like toxin (SLT). They can cause mild diarrhoea to fatal hemorrhagic colitis. Shiga like toxin belongs to class ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs). It inhibits protein synthesis by inhibiting ribosomal function. This toxin also acts on vascular endothelium to promote the synthesis of coagulation factor VIII, v. WF - Platelet aggregation. They can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome particularly in young children and the elderly. O 157: H 7 is the most prominent serotype of EHEC, associated with HUS, but 06, 026, 055, 091, 0103, 0111, 0113 and OX3 have also been associated with this syndrome. The primary target for V. T is vascular endothelium. The typical EHEC is serotype O157: H7 which does not ferement sorbital unlike majority of E. coli (but Harrison writes that few species of this serotype can ferment sorbital). Some other serotype like O26: H1 also belongs to this group. Laboratory diagnosis of VIEC diarrhea is established by demonstration of the bacilli or VT in feces directly or in culture. o Enteroaggrecative E. coli}# In developing countries and young children.# Can cause traveller's diarrhea and persistent diarrhea.# In vitro, thev exhibit a \"stacked - brick\" adherence pattern on Hep - 2 cells. o Diffusely adherent E. coli# Enteroaggregative E. coli forms a low molecular weight heat stable enterotoxin EAST -1 (enteroaggregative heat stable enterotoxin -1).",

The man also has severe chest pains which he says have bothered him for the past week. The man also says that this is unusual for him because it is summer and he usually gets his \"colds\" in the winter and not in July. When the physician examines the man's chest, he hears an abnormal or pathological sound upon auscultation. The man had pneumonia with consolidation in both lobes. No organism was isolated from his sputum on blood agar, but the physician gave him a shot of penicillin \"just in case\". As it turned out, the penicillin shot did nothing to relieve the man's distress. After 96 hours, a Gram-negative bacterium from the man's sputum did grow on buffered charcoal yeast extract. What disease did this man have?",
        "exp": "Legionnaires' disease is a disease caused by infection with Legionella pneumophila. It is a disease caused by the organism growing in the air conditioning systems in buildings. Therefore, it is a disease that is most often seen in the summer. Legionnaires' disease is a disease primarily affecting the lungs. The organism will not grow on blood agar but will grow on buffered charcoal yeast extract as a Gram-negative rod.

The mild form of Legionnaires' disease is called Pontiac fever because it was first observed in Pontiac, Michigan. Psittacosis, which is caused by Chlamydophila psittaci, is a lung infection, but the organism will not grow on buffered charcoal yeast extract agar.

The culture characteristics are most important in the isolation and identification of C jejuni. Selective media are needed, and incubation must be in an atmosphere with reduced O2 (5% O2 ) with added CO2 (10% CO2 ). Incubation of primary plates for isolation of C jejuni should be at 42degC. Although C jejuni grows well at 36-37degC, incubation at 42degC prevents growth of most of the other bacteria present in feces, thus simplifying the identification of C jejuni. Several selective media are in widespread use. Skirrow's medium contains vancomycin, polymyxin B, and trimethoprim to inhibit growth of other bacteria.",

M. pneumoniae can be cultivated on special media and identified by immunofluorescence staining and \"fried egg\" colonies on agar. Ureaplasma urealyticum (once called tiny, or T. strain) has been implicated in cases of NGU. As the name implies, this organism is able to split urea, a fact of diagnostic significance. Ureaplasma urealyticum is part of the normal flora of the genitourinary tract, particularly in women. Both M. orale and M. salivarium are inhabitants of the normal human oral cavity. These species are commensals and do not play a role in disease. The only other species of Mycoplasma associated with human disease is M. hominis. A normal inhabitant of the genital tract of women, this organism has been demonstrated to produce an acute respiratory illness that is associated with sore throat and tonsillar exudate, but not with fever. M. hominis can cause disease outside the urinary tract in immunosuppressed patients or immunocompetent patients after trauma of the genitourinary tract.

Vagina's acidity plays an important role in inhibiting other microbes that are less tolerant of acidity. o. Foods are preserved by acids produced by bacterial fermentation. o. Growth is poor below pH 6. 0 & above 7. 8. Growth stops below pH 5. 0 & above 9. 0o. Lactobacillus species grows at acidic pH & known as acidophiles. Vibrios are sensitive to acid but tolerate alkali. [?]. Physical growth factors: o1-Acidity (pH requirements):-Pathogenic bacteria grow best at neutral or biological pH which is typically between pH 6. 8 to pH 7. 4.-Fungi such as yeasts & molds prefer slightly more acidic conditions and grow best between pH 5 to pH 6.-The pathogen Helicobacter pylori is able to survive with pH of the stomach by producing urease. So it is acidophilic bacterium.-On the other extreme, bacteria that prefer alkaline (basic) conditions are known as alkaliphiles. Ex., Vibrio cholerae (prefers pH 9). [?]. Acidophiles or acidophilic organisms are those that thrive under highly acidic conditions (at pH 2. 0 or below). o. These organisms can be found in different branches of the tree of life, including Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya.-Acidobacterium, a phylum of Bacteria-Acidithiobacillales, an order of Proteobacteria e. g.

Other Options[?]. Neutrophile bacteria:-They grow optimally at a pH within one or two pH units of the neutral pH of 7.-Most familiar bacteria, like Escherichia coli, staphylococci, and Salmonella spp. are neutrophiles and do not fare well in the acidic pH of the stomach.-However, there are pathogenic strains of E coli, S. typhi, and other species of intestinal pathogens that are much more resistant to stomach acid. In comparison, fungi thrive at slightly acidic pH values of 5. 0-6. 0. [?]. Alkaiiphile Bacteria:-At the other end of the spectrum are alkaliphiles, microorganisms that grow best at pH between 8. 0 and 10. 5. Vibrio cholerae, the pathogenic agent of cholera, grows best at the slightly basic pH of 8. 0; it can survive pH values of 11. 0 but is inactivated by the acid of the stomach.-When it comes to survival at high pH, the bright pink archaean Natronobacterium, found in the soda lakes of the African Rift Valley, may hold the record at a pH of 10. 5.-Extreme alkaliphiles have adapted to their harsh environment through evolutionary modification of lipid and protein structure and compensatory mechanisms to maintain the proton motive force in an alkaline environment.-E. g., the alkaiiphile Bacillus firmus derives the energy for transport reactions and motility from a Na+ ion gradient rather than a proton motive force.-Many enzymes from alkaliphiles have a higher isoelectric point, due to an increase in the number of basic amino acids, than homologous enzymes from neutrophiles.",

        "question": "Cholera patient having stool output 1000-1500 mL/day is known as:",
        "exp": "Ans. D. Cholera gravis. Explanation. Vibrio cholera. They are curve (comma-shaped) gram negative, bacilli that are actively motile (single polar flagellum). Classification: Based on salt requirement. Halophilic vibrios: They can't grow in the absence of salt. They can tolerate salt at 7-10%. examples are V. parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus, V. vulnificus. Non-halophilic vibrios: They can grow without salt but 1% salt is needed. Examples are V. cholerae, V. mimicus. Heiberg classification (1934)EIGHT GROUPS based on fermentation of mannose, arabinose and sucrose. V. cholerae placed in GROUP I. Gardner and Venkatraman classification. Based on serogrouping, biotyping, serotyping and phage typing. Pathogenesis of cholera: Toxin mediated. Mode of transmission: Ingestion of contaminated water and food. Infective dose: extremely acid labile, hence high infective dose is needed to bypass gastric >> barrier (108 bacilli). Factors promoting transmission: Hypochlorhydria, use of antacids. The bacilli penetrates mucous layer - Adheres to the epithelium - Cholera toxin is produced - Toxin has fragment B and fragment A - Fragment B is binding fragment, that binds to GM1. Ganglioside receptors - Fragment A, causes ADP-ribosylation of G protein - Upregulates the activity of adenylate cyclase - Intracellular accumulation of camp - water moves out due to osmolality, which leads to watery diarrhea - Loss of fluids and electrolytes leads to shock. Clinical features of cholera: Asymptomatic infection (75% cases). Mild diarrhea or cholera (20% cases). Sudden onset of explosive and life threatening diarrhea (Cholera gravis, in 5% of cases). Watery diarrhea, rice water stools, vomiting, fever usually absent, muscle cramps due to electrolyte imbalance. Complications of cholera: Loss of body weight by. Symptoms<5%Increased thirst5-10%*. Postural hypotension*. Weakness*. Tachycardia*. Decreased skin turgor>10%Renal failure (acute tubular necrosis) and fluid loss results in:*. Oliguria*. Weak or absent pulse*. Sunken eyes*. Sunken fontanelles in infants*. Wrinkled skin*. Somnolence*. Coma. Epidemiology. History of pandemics: Home land is DELTA REGION of Ganges and Brahmaputra in West Bengal. And Bangladesh. First 6 pandemics caused by classical biotype of V. cholerae, had spread from Bengal to all over world. Seventh pandemic-only pandemic originated outside india(in Indonesia), caused by El Tor biotype. 0139 (Bengal strain) -- first isolated in Chennai in 1992. It was not agglutinated by antisera (01 to 0138), hence designated as 0139. It is capsulated, invasive causes bacteremia and extraintestinal manifestations. Cholera is a notifiable disease. National reference center for cholera is located at national institute of cholera and enteric diseases (NICED), Kolkata. Reservoir: Humans. Source: Asymptomatic cases or carriers. Carriers: (1) Incubatory carriers (1-2 days), (2) Convalescent carriers (2-3 weeks), (3) Contact or healthy carriers (<10 days), (4) Chronic carriers. Factors determining severity: People with O blood group, malnutrition, lack of preexisting immunity. Habitat: Natural habitat of coastal sea salt water and brackish estuaries, associated with crustaceans, copepods, crabs, plankton. Lab diagnosis. Specimens: Watery stool or rectal swab for carriers. Transport media: Venkataramana Ramakrishna media, Cary-Blair medium. Direct microscopy: Gram-negative rods, short curved, comma shaped (fish in stream appearance). Hanging drop demonstrates darting motility. Culture: Enrichment broth: Alkaline peptone water, Monsur's taurocholate tellurite peptone water. Selective media: Bile salt agar, Monsur's GTTT agar, TCBS agar (yellow colonies). Mac. Conkey agar-translucent non-lactose fermenting colonies. Culture smear and motility testing to be done. Biochemical identification: Catalase and oxidase positive. ICUT: Indole (+), Citrate (+/-), Urease (-), TSI: A/A, gas (-), H2S (-). Cholera red reaction is positive. String test is positive. Salt tolerance test is positive. Ferments glucose and sucrose Biotyping: To differentiate Classical and El Tor Serogrouping: To differentiate 01 and 0139. Serotyping: To differentiate Ogawa, Inaba, Hikojima serotypes of serogroup 01. Treatment. Fluid replacement: ORS solution, ringer's lactate. Antibiotics has minor role, WHO recommends antibiotic use only in severely dehydrated cases. Adults: doxycycline or tetracycline Children/pregnancy erythromycin/azithromycin. Prevention: General measures: Safe water, improved sanitary disposal of feces, notification, health education. Chemoprophylaxis: Tetracycline. Vaccine: Injectable killed vaccines: No longer in use. Oral cholera vaccines (OCV). Killed whole-cell vaccine. Oral live-attenuated vaccine. Killed whole-cell vaccine. Oral live-attenuated vaccine1. Whole-Cell (WC) vaccine: Composed of killed whole cells of V. cholerae 01 (Classical and El Tor Inaba and Ogawa). They use mutant strains that lack gene encoding for cholera toxin. 2.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., O 157: H7 of EHEC o Diarrhea is caused by intestinal pathogenic E. coli. o At least five distinct \"pathotypes\" of intestinal pathogenic E. coli exist: 1) Enteropathogenic E. coli l. Enteroadherent E. colil# It causes watery diarrhoea in infants and children usually occuring as institutional out breaks.# It does not produce enterotoxin, nor are they invasive. They adhere to the mucosa of small intestine and cause disruption of the brush border microvilli.# These strains can be identified by their adhesion to HEP - 2 cells. 2) Enterotoxigenic E. coli# It causes traveller's diarrhoea [ETEC is the most common cause of traveller's diarrhea).# ETEC is the most frequent bacterial cause of diarrhea in infant and children of developing countries, especially in tropical countries.# It produces enterotoxins. They can produce heat labile toxin (LT) or heat stable toxin or both.# Toxin production alone may not lead to illness. The strain should first be able to adhere to intestinal mucosa. This adhesiveness is medicated by funbrial or colonisation factor antigen (CFA).# It is non-invasive (does not invade mucosa). 3) Enteroinvasive E. coli# They themselves resemble shigella and their infection resembles shigellosis (remember: shiga like toxin is elaborated by enterohemorrhagic E. coli).# They produce mild diarrhoea to frank dysentry and occur in adult as well as in children.# They have been termed enteroinvasive because they have the capacity to invade intestinal epithelial cells in vivo and penetrate He. La or HEP - 2 cells in tissue culture.# This ability of penetration is plasmid determined which codes for outer membrane antigens called the 'virulence marker antigen' (VMA). The detection of plasmid can be diagnostic.# For laboratory diagnosis of EIEC, the sereny test used to be employed.# These strains are non motile, do not ferment lactose or ferment it late with acid without producing any gas. 4) Enterohemorrhagic E. coli or verotoxigenic E. coli# These strains produce verocytotoxin (VT) or shiga like toxin (SLT)# They can cause mild diarrhoea to fatal hemorrhagic colitis.# Shiga like toxin belongs to class ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs). It inhibits protein synthesis by inhibiting ribosomal function.# This toxin also acts on vascular endothelium to promote the synthesis of coagulation factor VIII, v. WF - Platelet aggregation.# They can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome particularly in young children and the elderly.# O 157: H7 is the most prominent serotype of EHEC, associated with HUS, but 06, 026, 055, 091, 0103, 0111, 0113 and OX3 have also been associated with this syndrome.# The primary target for V. T is vascular endothelium.# The typical EHEC is serotype 0157: H7 which does not ferement sorbital unlike majority of E. coll Therefore sorbitol Mac Conkey media (a modified Mac Conkey media containing sorbitol in place of lactase) is used for EHEC 0157: H7.# Some other serotype like 026: HI also belongs to this group.# Laboratory diagnosis of VIEC diarrhea is established by demonstration of the bacilli or VT in feces directly or in culture. 5) Enteroaggregative E. coli# In developing countries and young children.# Can cause traveller's diarrhea (2nd me cause ofter ETEC) and persistent diarrhea.# In vitro, they exhibit a \"stacked - brick\" adherence pattern on Hep - 2 cells.# Enteroaggregative E. coli forms a low molecular weight heat stable enterotoxin EAST - 1 (enteroaggregative heat stable enterotoxin - 1).",

In the treatment of patients who have cholera, the use of a drug that inhibits adenyl cyclase would be expected to have which of the following characteristics?",
        "exp": "Cholera is a toxicosis. The mode of action of cholera toxin is to stimulate the activity of adenyl cyclase, an enzyme that converts ATP to cyclic AMP. Cyclic AMP stimulates the secretion of chloride ion, and affected patients lose copious amounts of fluid. A drug that inhibits adenyl cyclase thus might block the effect of cholera toxin. Water and electrolyte replacement are primary management mechanisms, while oral tetracycline may help reduce stool output. Many antimicrobial agents are effective against V. cholerae, notably oral tetracycline. A sensitivity test would be needed for choosing the best drug to kill the bacteria. Fluid secretion would be lessened if adenyl cyclase was inhibited. Our patient would not die with the described medical treatment but be helped to overcome the infection.

HGE infection is transmitted by I. scapularis, the same tick that transmits Lyme disease. Both infections cause fever and leukopenia. A rash rarely occurs. E. chaffeensis infects monocytes, and HGE infects granulocytes; both organisms produce inclusion bodies called morulae. Francisella tularensis is a small, gram-negative, nonmotile coccobacillus. Humans most commonly acquire the organism after contact with the tissues or body fluid of an infected mammal or the bite of an infected tick. The Rickettsia C. burnetii causes Q fever, and humans are usually infected by aerosol of a spore-like form shed in milk, urine, feces, or placenta of infected sheep, cattle, or goats.

These streptococci undergo complete hemolysis of sheep red blood cells in agar and therefore shows a clear zone around colonies. Hemolysis is caused by the enzyme hemolysins. a Hemolysis. Incomplete hemolysis producing greenish discolouration around colonies. g Hemolvsis. Non hemolysis b hemolytic streptococcib. Hemolytic streptococci are further classified into lancefied groups (A-H K-V) based on the antigenic carbohydrate in the cell wall. Group A, B, C, D and G are the groups most commonly associated with human infections. Group A streptococci (streptococcus pyogenic) is responsible for a wide range of superficial and deep infections and are further classified according to M protein an antiphagocytic fibrillar molecule that interferes with deposition of complement C3b. Group A streptococci is also classified using bacitracin sensitivity test: - BACITRACIN SENSITIVITY TESTThe bacitracin sensitivity test is useful for the differentiation of B hemolytic Group A streptococci from b hemolytic non Group A streptococci. This is important because most streptococcal diseases are caused by Group A streptococci. \"Streptococcus A (pyogenes) is bacitracin sensitive while streptococcus agalactiae is bacitracin resistant. CAMP TESTThis test is used for the presumptive identification of Group B streptococcus (streptococcus agalactiae) and to differentiate it from streptococcus pyogenes group A. Group B is the only B hemolytic streptococcus which yields a positive CAMP test. This test detects a diffusible heat stable extracellular protein produced by Group B streptococcus that enhances the hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes by staphylococcus aureus. The CAMP factor acts synergistically with the beta hemolysin produced by staphylococcus aureus to induce enhanced hemolysis of sheep or bovine RBL. A known hemolytic strain of S. aureus is streaked in a straight line across the centre of the sheep blood agar plate. The test material is streaked in a straight line perpendicular to staphylococcus aureus streak but without touching it. The plate is incubated at 37deg C for 18-24 hours. A positive test for CAMP factor appears as arrowhead hemolysis between the junction of growth of staphylococcus aureus and Group B streptococcus. There is no enhanced or arrowhead hemolysis if the test isolate is not Group B streptococcus. OPTOCHINTESTOptochin sensitivity test is used to differentiate pneumococcus from other a hemolytic streptococci. a hemolytic streptococci may be pathogens such as streptococcus pneumonia or they may be a part of the flora of the upper respiratory tract i. e. viridans streptococci. Streptococcus pneumonia is sensitive to optochin therefore it does not grow around the optochin disc while bacterias that are optochin resistant will be unaffected. Bile solubility test * Bile solubility test is used to distinguish streptococcus pneumoniae from other d hemolytic streptococci. Bile will selectively lyse colonies of streptococcus pneumoniae while other streptococci are immune to bile's activity. When a bile salt such as deoxycholate is added directly to streptococcus pneumoniae growing on an agar plate or in a broth culture the bacteria will lyse and the area becomes clear. Other 5 hemolytic streptococci are resistant to (not lysed by bile) and will stay viable or turbid. Classification of Streptococci",

Risk factors include prematurity, premature rupture of membranes, and group B streptococcal carriage. The Gram's stain of cerebrospinal fluid is a rapid test for GBS disease. Although sensitive, the Gram's stain requires experience to differentiate these streptococci from other Gram-positive cocci. Latex tests for GBS antigen are also available, but sensitivity in CSF is not significantly higher than the Gram's stain. GBS can be reduced by intrapartum administration of penicillin. Experimentally, GBS polysaccharide vaccines have also been used. Screening pregnant females early in pregnancy probably offers little advantage because of the possible acquisition of GBS late in the pregnancy. There has been speculation concerning the pathogenesis of GBS. These include failure to activate complement pathways and immobilization of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) due to the inactivation of complement C5a, a potent chemoattractant.

The isolated microorganism required an atmosphere containing reduced oxygen and increased carbon dioxide for its growth. In most cases, the gastroenteritis was self-limiting.

        "exp": "Campylobacter jejuni may be part of the normal flora of different domesticated animals including poultry, sheep, and cattle. Surface waters and soil where animal graze may be contaminated with C. jejuni. Therefore, C. jejuni outbreaks, which are zoonotic, may result from the ingestion of contaminated water that has not been treated. The main symptoms of C. jejuni infection are gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, fever, and malaise. The symptoms often peak at 24 to 48 hours after onset or may last for 7 to 10 days. The disease is generally self-limited. Due to the susceptibility of Campylobacter to different antibiotics including macrolides, erythromycin is the drug of choice to treat severe enteritis caused by C. jejuni. Optimum growth of Campylobacter occurs under reduced oxygen and increased carbon dioxide (5%-10%). Infection with V. cholerae results in a massive watery diarrhea that progresses to severe dehydration and hypovolemic shock. Infection with V. parahaemolyticus is associated with explosive watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. The gastroenteritis is self-limited. V. parahaemolyticus is usually found in an estuarine and marine environment and is associated with ingestion of contaminated shellfish.

Brucella is strictly a parasite of animals. No human to human transmission has been identified and infection in human occurs only by contact with infected animals or animal products. The disease in the man is known as Malta fever, Mediterranean fever or undulant fever. Transmission of Brucella. Brucella is a widespread zoonotic disease mainly seen in cattle, sheep, goats and pigs. Brucella is strictly a parasite of animals. No human to human transmission has been identified and infection in human occurs by contact with infected animals or animal products. The possible means of acquisition of Brucella are:-Occupational exposure: Certain occupations are associated with high risk of exposure to brucella. These include people who work with farm animals especially cattle sheep, goats and pigs: e. g. farmers, farm labourers, animal attendants, stockmen, shepherds sheep rearers, abattoirs. Persons involved in the processing of animal products may be at high risk of exposure to brucellosis. These include slaughter men, butchers, meat packers, processors of hides, skins and wool renderers and dairy workers. Infection may occur by inhalation, conjunctival contamination, accidental ingestion, skin contamination especially via cuts or abrasions. Food borne transmission. Main source of brucellosis for urban population, Ingestion of fresh milk or dairy products prepared from unheated milk is the main source of infection for most populations. Pasteurization of milk kilts brucella. Therefore unpasteurized milk or milk products may pose a particular risk. Infection from contaminated environment * Brucella species can survive for long periods in dust, dung, water, slurry, aborted fetuses, soil, meat and dairy products. \"Inhalational brucellosis may then result from exposure to contaminated dusty dried dung etc\". (aerosol transmission). Contact infection may also result from contamination of skin or conjunctivae from soiled surfaces. Person to person transmission - Extremely rare. Diagnosis of Brucella. Unequivocal diagnosis of Brucellosis requires isolation of the causative agent. Blood culture is the method of choice, it provides definitive diagnosis. But Brucella is a slow growing organisms and it requires prolonged period of incubation. In addition, failure to detect the pathogen is a frequent occurrence. The organism is isolated by culture methods in no more than 20% cases. Although in the last few years PCR based laboratory tests have been proposed but they cannot be considered a routine diagnostic method. These limitations make serology for antibody detection the most useful test for lab diagnosis:-Brucellosis may present clinically as acute or as chronic and of insidious onset. The serological results may differ depending on the clinical form and stage of the infection. IgM usually appears first followed by IgG. immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody predominates for the first week of acute infection, after which the IgG antibody level starts to increase, reaches a peak after few weeks and predominates over the IgM antibody level until adequate therapy eliminates the infection. If adequate therapy is not done, the infection progresses to chronic state in which IgG level persists. Therapy only affects the IgG level. Adequate therapy reduces the IgG antibody level but not the IgM antibody level. If adequate therapy is not given, the infection may progress to a state of chronic brucellosis in which the serological activity is mainly due to IgG antibody. The routine brucella or the standard brucella agglutination test is the most frequently used type of serological test for the diagnosis of brucella. However it does not differentiate between, active and inactive disease because it does not differentiate between IgG and IgM agglutinins. The 2. ME (2-Mercapto. Ethanol) agglutination test is most useful for differentiations active from inactive brucellosis. In this test the IgM immunoglobulin is inactivated by treating with 2-Mercaptoethanol (2. ME) which breaks the disulfide bond and depolymerizes the IgM. The IgG immunoglobulin is resistant to depolymerization by 2 mercaptoethanol (2. ME). The depolymerized IgM does not contribute to agglutination therefore the titre is primarily due to \"ME resistant antibody (IgG)\"The 2. ME agglutination test is most useful for differentiating active from inactive brucellosis in persons having ill-defined complaint./ - The presence of 2. ME resistant (IgG) brucella agglutinins indicates active disease in these patients. In addition 2. ME agglutination test has been found to be superior to the routine agglutination test for determining the adequacy of antibiotic therapy. Adequate therapy reduces the IgG antibody level but not the IgM antibody level if adequate therapy is not given this infection may progress to a state of chronic brucellosis in which the serological activity is mainly due to IgG antibody. A fall in 2. ME resistant IgG antibody titre indicates satisfactory response to therapy.",

These and related organisms are unique among bacteria in that, though they have an animal reservoir, they can be transmitted to humans. Humans become infected by a variety of routes, including ingestion of contaminated animal products (B. abortus in cattle), direct contact with contaminated animal material or with infected animals themselves (Y. enterocolitica and B. bronchiseptica in dogs), and animal bites (P. multocida in many different animals). The laboratory differentiation of these microbes may be difficult and must rely on a number of parameters, including biochemical and serologic reactions, development of specific antibody response in affected persons, and epidemiologic evidence of infection. Yersinia enterocolitica are motile at 77degC (25degC) and nonmotile at 98. 6degF (37degC). They are found in the intestinal tract of animals and cause a variety of clinical syndromes in humans. Transmission to humans probably occurs via animal fecal contamination of food, drink, or fomites. The brucellae are obligate parasites of animals and humans and are located intracellularly. Brucella abortus is typically found in cattle. Brucellosis (undulant fever) has an acute bacteremic phase followed by a chronic stage that may last years and involve many tissues. Brucella abortus requires CO2 for growth and is most often isolated from blood and bone marrow. Species differentiation is due to dye (thionine) sensitivity. Bordetella bronchiseptica causes diseases in animals (kennel cough in dogs) and occasionally respiratory disease and bacteremia in humans. Bordetella requires enriched medium (Bordet-Gengou) and is strongly urease-positive. Pasteurella multocida occurs worldwide in the respiratory and GI tracts of many domestic and wild animals.

        "exp": "Atypical pneumonia\" is an old classification used for respiratory disease that is not lobar and is not \"typical. \" That is, it does not include pneumonia caused by pneumococcus, Klebsiella, Haemophilus, or b-hemolytic streptococci that results in a typical lobular infiltrate. In recent years, the atypical pneumonias have become much more frequent than pneumococcal pneumonia. They are characterized by a slower onset with headache, joint pain, fever, and signs of an acute upper respiratory infection. There are usually no signs of acute respiratory distress, but patients report malaise and fatigue. The most common cause of atypical pneumonia is M. pneumoniae. A quick test for M. pneumoniae infection is cold agglutinins. The test may lack both sensitivity and specificity, but it is rapid and readily available compared with culture of M. pneumoniae or specific antibody formation. In certain age groups (men over 55 years old), Legionnaires disease must be ruled out. While direct microscopy, culture, and serology are available, the detection of Legionella antigen in respiratory secretions is the most sensitive test available. Campylobacter pneumoniae may also cause respiratory infection particularly in, but not limited to, children. Diagnosis is best made by growing these energy-defective bacteria in tissue culture such as He. La cells. Serology is usually not helpful. During the winter months, Bordetella infection may be quite prevalent, particularly in those patients whose immunizations are not updated. Adult Bordetella infection may not present with typical whooping cough symptoms and must be differentiated from other forms of acute bronchitis by culture on specific media or direct fluorescent microscopy. Direct microscopy of sputum is an important preliminary test for sputum and other exudate specimens. One needs to be aware that the information obtained is limited in interpretation. No specific identity of a microorganism can be determined by gram staining and even mixtures of bacteria can be inferred. On the other hand, examination of gram stains may provide enough information for the physician to make immediate decisions on treatment and other management that may be modified by future laboratory results. Fluorescent Ab detection of an organism in sputum is more specific than gram staining. Here specific known Abs (single or in a mixture) are used to identify organisms present.",

This disease has characteristic histopathology, and membranous plaques can be seen in the colon by endoscopy. Pseudomembranous enterocolitis and antibiotic-associated diarrhea are caused by an anaerobic gram-positive rod, C. difficile. It has been recently shown that C. difficile produces a protein toxin with a molecular weight of about 250, 000. The \"toxin\" is, in fact, two toxins, toxin A and toxin B. Both toxins are always present in fecal samples, but there is approximately 1000 times more toxin B than toxin A. Toxin A has enterotoxic activity-that is, it elicits a positive fluid response in ligated rabbit ileal loops-whereas toxin B appears to be primarily a cytotoxin. The Bacteroides and clostridium organisms are anaerobic and can be found in the intestinal tract. Also, these would be killed by the antibiotics given to the patient. Staphylococcus aureus is resistant to many antimicrobials and can cause gastroenteritis if it becomes predominant, but it usually does not cause as serious disease as pseudomembranous enterocolitis.

Respiratory Diphtheria (Caused by Corynebacterium diphtheria): Pseudomembrane in diphtheria is tightly adherent to the underlying tissues. The diphtheritic pseudomembrane is gray or whitish and sharply demarcatedQ. Diagnosis requires the isolation of C. diphtheria or the histopathologic isolation of compatible gram-positive organismsQ. The pseudomembranous lesion is most often located in the tonsillopharyngeal region. QRespiratory Diphtheria. Clinical Features: The clinical diagnosis of diphtheria is based on: Constellation of sore throat. QAdherent tonsillar, pharyngeal, or nasal pseudomembranous lesions. QLow-grade fever. QOccasionally, weakness, dysphagia, headache, and voice change are the initial manifestationsQ. Neck edema and difficulty breathing are seen in more advanced cases and carry a poor prognosisQ. The systemic manifestations of diphtheria stem from the effects of diphtheria toxin and include weakness as a result of neurotoxicity and cardiac arrhythmias or congestive heart failure due to myocarditisQ. The pseudomembranous lesion is most often located in the tonsillopharyngeal regionQ. The diphtheritic pseudomembrane is gray or whitish and sharply demarcatedQ. Pseudomembrane in diphtheria is tightly adherent to the underlying tissuesQ. Less commonly, the lesions are detected in the larynx, nares, and trachea or bronchial passages. Large pseudomembranes are associated with severe disease and a poor prognosisQ. A few patients develop swelling of the tonsils and present with \"bull-neck\" diphtheria, which results from massive edema of the submandibular and paratracheal region and is further characterized by foul breath, thick speech, and stridorous breathingQ. Unlike the exudative lesion associated with streptococcal pharyngitis, the pseudomembrane in diphtheria is tightly adherent to the underlying tissuesQ.

They require the host's ATP as an energy source for their own metabolism. They have a cell membrane transport system that takes on ATP from the host cell and then return backs an ADP. This is called ATP/ADP translocator. Chlamydia life cycle. The chlamydia life cycle is complex as the bacteria exists in two forms (biphasic). Elementary body. It is a metabolically inert (does not divide), dense, round, small (300 nm) infectious particle. The outer membrane has extensive disulfide bond cross-linkages that confer stability for extracellular existence. It is an infectious particle that spreads from host to host. Initial body (also called reticulate body). Once inside a host cell the elementary body inhibits phagosome lysosome fusion and grows in size to 1000 nm. Its RNA content increases and binary fission occurs forming the initial body, (initial body). Although the initial body synthesizes its own DNA, RNA and proteins, it requires ATP from the host. Also know * Chlamydia trachomatis has affinity for columnar cells.",

A streptococcal isolate can be classified presumptively as GBS on the basis of biochemical tests, including hydrolysis of sodium hippurate (in which 99% of isolates are positive), hydrolysis of bile esculin (in which 99-100% are negative), bacitracin susceptibility (in which 92% are resistant), and production of CAMP factor (in which 98-100% are positive). CAMP factor is a phospholipase produced by GBS that causes synergistic hemolysis with p lysin produced by certain strains ofS. aureus'-Harrison 19th/969. Staphylococci produce catalase, which converts hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen.
