Explanation: INFECTIONS IN LABORATORY WORKERSMost Common Causes of Laboratory-Acquired Infections. Bacteria: Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Shigella. Salmonella. Campylobacter. Brucella spp. -- Occasionally. Co. xiella bumetti. Rickettsiae. Chlamydia psittaci. Francisella tularensis. B. mallei. B. pseudomallei. Viruses: Hepatitis-B virus. Hepatitis-C virus. HIV.
