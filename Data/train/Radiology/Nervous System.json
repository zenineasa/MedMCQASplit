        "exp": "Ans. a (USG cranium). (Ref. Grainger, Diagnostic Radiology, 4th ed., 2469). Cranial ultrasound of Infants# USG cranium is best method to diagnose hydrocephalus through the anterior and posterior fontanalles.# Progression of hydrocephalus can be estimated by comparison with previous studies.# USG is also helpful in following ventricular decompression in patients treated for hydrocephalus.# Neonatal hydrocephalus can also be evaluated by Doppler to assess indirectly intracranial pressure and help to determine the need for shunt placement. Cranial CT# CT enable us to evaluate the brain structure and ventricular size by noninvasive highly reliable technique.# But due to the ionizing radiations hazard, CT as a screening investigation is less preferable. Qhstretk. (Fetal) Cranial ultrasound# Obstretic ultrasound study is one of the best methods for antenatal diagnosis of hydrocephalus as it is noninvasive & hazard free not only to fetus as well as to mother. However assessment prior to GA of 20 weeks may be difficult, as ventricles constitute a large portion of cranial vault.# Signs suggestive of fetal hydrocephalus on obstretic USG study are:- Atrial size > 10 mm- Dangling \"Choroid plexus\" sign- BPD > 95th percentile- +- Polyhydramnios. Educational points:# Lemon sign:- Concave/linear frontal contour abnormality located at coronal suture strongly associated with spina bifida.# Banana sign:- Cerebellum wrapped around posterior brainstem + obliteration of cisterna magna secondary to small posterior fossa + downward traction of spinal cord in Chiari II malformation.# Key points about Obstetric color Doppler study:- Assessment of flow in MCA is important parameter to diagnose fetal anemia.- Assessment of flow in umbilical vessels is important parameter to diagnose fetoplacental insufficiency.- Reduced diastolic flow in umbilical artery is the earliest sign of fetoplacental insufficiency.- Reversal of flow in umbilical artery (as well as pulsatile flow in umbilical vein) is the most ominous sign and may indicate impending fetal death.",

The congenital malformation develops mainly during weeks 6-11 of fetal development as a persistent embryonic prosencephalic vein of Markowski; thus, VGAM is actually a misnomer. The vein of Markowski drains into the vein of Galen. It causes high-output heart failure in the newborn resulting from the decreased resistance and high blood flow in the lesion. The clinical findings include cerebral ischemic changes such as strokes or steal phenomena that result in progressive hemiparesis. The malformation may result in mass effects, which causes progressive neurological impairment. Alternatively, the malformation may cause obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow and result in hydrocephalus.",

Craniospinal irradiation is used for patients who have, or are at risk for, disseminated disease throughout the CNS that is not sufficiently responsive to chemotherapy (typically methotrexate). This includes:# Embryonal CNS malignancies (medulloblastoma, PNET, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour)# Intracranial germ cell tumour with evidence of distant CNS metastases.# Epenedymoma with evidence of distant CNS metastases or CSF involvement- Craniospinal radiation is central to the management of medulloblastoma. Depending upon the age and the use of chemotherapy, cranio-spinal irradiation (CSI) of 25 to 35 Gy and boost radiation to the posterior fossa to a total dose of 50-55. Gy over 6-7 weeks is the standard of care.- Post operative radiotherapy (localised fields to a dose of 54 Gy/30) is required in selected cases with residual cerebellar astrocytoma particularly in the brain stem. Chemotherapy is generally not indicated in these tumours.- In germinomas, Radiotherapy directed toward the craniospinal axis or tumor site alone at decreased dose levels is effective.

BRAIN TUMOR IMAGING# Tumors of brain are usually better demonstrated on MRI than on CT due to greater inherent soft tissue contrast.# An additional advantage of MRI is its ability to provide direct multiplanar imaging which helps to define the relation- ship of the tumor to adjacent structures & thus helps in planning of surgery & facilitates the distinction between intra- axial & extra-axial tumors.# MRI is vastly superior to CT in evaluating posterior fossa tumors as CT is frequently hampered by 'beam - hardening artifact' from the base of skull.# Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) have ancillary roles in the imaging of brain tumors, primarily in distinguishing tumor recurrence from tissue necrosis that can occur after irradiation.# Functional imaging with PET, MRI, magnetoencephalography may be useful in surgical/radiosurgical planning.

FLuid Attenuated Inversion Recovery sequence--as the name suggests, all fluids appear black. Option d. False. No, CSF does not show diffusion restriction and is thus, dark on diffusion- weighted imaging. Option e. False. Free diffusion showing structures appear bright on ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) maps. Ref.: Fundamentals of Diagnostic Radiology. 3rd Edition. MRI images are commonly viewed in three planes: axial, coronal, and sagittal. The routine MRI is presented as black and white images, not color. The various shades of gray are described in terms of their \"signal intensity. \" \"Low signal intensity\" means \"dark, \" and \"high signal intensity\" means \"bright. \"MRI weighting: T1, T2, others. The most commonly used techniques for MRI imaging are T1-weighted, T2-weighted, Flair and Diffusion-weighted. T1 weighted images are useful for brain parenchyma. Brain appears medium gray and CSF is dark gray, and air is nearly black. Most tumors appear dark, with low signal intensity. Fat has high signal intensity on T1 but \"drops out\" on T2 weighted images where it becomes dark. Gadolinium contrast added to the T1 may \"light up\" a tumor or abscess. If a lesion has dark signal on T1, and bright signal with gadolinium, it is a \"contrast enhancing\" lesion. The enhancement may be the same throughout the lesion, making it \"homogeneously enhancing. \"T2 weighted images are great to evaluate CSF spaces, which appear bright white. Brain appears light gray. Use the T2 sequence to check the size and symmetry of the ventricles, and look for bright signal of edema surrounding an aggressive tumor or a subacute stroke or hemorrhage. The T2 images accentuate high-water-content tissue by making it look white (hyperintense) on MRI. The flair sequence is \"a T2 with dark CSF, \" very sensitive to edema and to parenchymal abnormalities like a low grade glioma. Diffusion weighted images have one purpose: to visualize an area of acute ischemia. Remember: An MRI is the study of choice for tumor, multiple sclerosis, and ischemic stroke. Add gadolinium contrast to evaluate tumor and abscess. For brain hemorrhage, however, CT is the go-to study.",

The lesions are found predominately among women. The onset of symptoms is usually insidious, and symptoms are caused by the large size of the lesions. Patients usually present with headaches and dysfunction of the cranial nerves passing through the cavernous sinus, manifesting particularly as ptosis and diplopia. MRI reveals well-defined masses that are Hypointense or isointense on t1-weighted images and markedly hyper intense on t2-weighted images, which indicates the relationship between the lesion and the intracavernous ICA. The marked hyper-intensity on t2-weighted images and homogenous enhancement seem to distinguish these lesions from other types. Meningiomas often similar signal intensity to gray matter on both t1- and t2-weighted images. Schwannomas tend to give lower signal intensity than gray matter on t1-weighted images and almost uniformly give higher signal intensity on t2-weighted images.

The four major causes of a cerebrovascular accident, or stroke, in order of frequency, are ischemia (60% to 90% of cases), intracerebral hemorrhage (e. g., hypeensive bleed), subarachnoid hemorrhage (e. g., ruptured berry aneurysm, aeriovenous malformation), and embolic infarction (e. g., hemorrhagic infarction). As a general rule, ischemic strokes are pale (80% of cases) and the other three are hemorrhagic. The majority of ischemic strokes are due to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic infarctions are most commonly secondary to a thrombus overlying an atheromatous plaque at the origin of the internal carotid aery. Consequences of atherosclerosis involving the cerebral vessels include cerebral infarction, cerebral atrophy, ischemic encephalopathy (laminar necrosis, watershed infarcts), transient ischemic attacks, and thromboembolism of a poion of atherosclerotic plaque to a distant location. They are usually pale infarcts because the atherosclerotic plaque occludes most of the lumen and reperfusion of the infarcted area usually does not occur. Grossly, there is softening of the brain after 6 hours, with a visible loss of normal demarcation between the gray and white matter. Microscopically, \"red neurons\" (i. e., apoptosis of individual neurons), nuclear pyknosis, and degeneration of myelin are present. After 2 to 10 days, the brain tissue is gelatinous. Neutrophils transiently invade the necrotic area but are soon replaced by microglial cells, many of which have engulfed lipid and appear as gitter cells. From 10 days to 3 weeks, liquefactive necrosis produces cystic areas in the brain. The subjacent brain parenchyma contains reactive astrocytes with eosinophilic cytoplasm. Cerebral infarcts present with a gradual onset of symptoms (i. e., transient ischemic attacks; TIAs), followed by localizing neurologic signs of contra lateral hemiplegia, aphasia, and visual defects (amaurosis fugax), depending on the site of infarction and whether the dominant hemisphere is involved. The majority of patients recover and regain paial restoration of their initial deficits. TIAs occur in patients with fixed atherosclerotic disease and are often caused by dislodgment of platelet and/or cholesterol emboli into the peripheral vessels. They generally last a few seconds to a few minutes and, by definition, recovery is within 24 hours. Unilateral symptoms suggest carotid ischemia, whereas bilateral symptoms suggest veebrobasilar ischemia, especially if accompanied by veigo, dysahria, or dysphagia. Ticlopidine, which inhibits the synthesis of adenosine diphosphate, or aspirin, which decreases the synthesis of thromboxane A2, are commonly used to prevent TIAs.",

This is distinct from the 'normal' life cycle in which the undercooked pork is eaten and the larval cysts contained within mature into adult intestinal tape worm.> Extra-intestinal infection undergoes specific clinical and imaging changes at it progresses through four stages of infection.> Stages: There are four main stages (also known as Escobar's pathological stages): 1. Vesicular: viable parasite with intact membrane and therefore no host reaction. 2. Colloidal vesicular: parasite dies within 4-5 years 1 untreated, or earlier with treatment and the cyst fluid becomes turbid. As the membrane becomes leaky oedema surrounds the cyst. This is the most symptomatic stage. 3. Granular nodular: oedema decreases as the cyst retracts further; enhancement persists. 4. Nodular calcified: end-stage quiescent calcified cyst remnant; no oedema.# Location: Infection can be both intra and extra axial. Commonest location is the subarachnoid space over the cerebral hemispheres.> Other locations in order of decreasing frequency are: subarachnoid space over the cerebral hemispheres - may be large basal cisterns - may be \"grape like\" (racemose): most lack an indentifiable scolex; parenchyma ventricles - usually solitary cysts; 4th ventricle most frequent> Typically the parenchymal cysts are small (1cm) whereas the subarachnoid ones can be much bigger (up to 9cm): differential therefore being arachnoid cyst. It is the most common cause of epilepsy in endemic areas (South-east Asia, South America) with progression through the 4 stages taking anywhere between 1 to 9 years.> Radiographic features: Imaging findings depend on location and stage of infection.> Subarachnoid-intraventricular: When in the subarachnoid space/intraventricular, the the cysts typically do not have a visible scolex. In the basal cisterns they can be grape-like (racemose). The cysts are typically 1-2 cm in diameter 2. Usually the cysts are similar in signal intensity to CSF, although occasionally cyst fluid may somewhat differ.> In the ventricles there is often (79%) 2 associated ventriculitis often leading to aqueductal stenosis and hydrocephalus.> Parenchymal: Parenchymal cysts usually involve the grey white matter junction.> Vesicular: cyst with dot sign; CSF density/intensity; hyperintense scolex on T1 can sometimes be seen; no enhancement is typical, although very faint enhancement of the wall and enhancement of the scolex may be seen> Colloidal vesicular: cyst fluid becomes turbid CT: hyperdense to CSF; MRI T1: hyperintense to CSF; surrounding oedema; cyst and the wall becomes thickened and brightly enhances scolex can often still be seen as an eccentric focus of enhancement> Granular nodular: oedema decreases; cyst retracts; enhancement persists but is less marked>Nodular calcified: Endstage quiescent calcified cyst remnant, no oedema; no enhancement on CT; signal drop out on T2 and T2* sequences; some intrinsic high T1 signal may be present; long term enhancement may be evident on MRI, and may predict ongoing seizures.",

Clark, Positioning in Radiography, 10th ed., 588)MYELOGRAPHY# Myelography is the radiographic investigation of the spinal canal for the diagnosis of space occupying & obstructive lesions & requires the contrast agent to be injected into the subarchnoid space (which lies between pia mater & the arachnoid mater) usually following a lumbar puncture.# Either a negative contrast agent like air or oxygen is used or more usually a positive non reactive water-soluble preferably non-ionic, organic iodine compound (Iohexol).# Nonionic iodinated compounds have replaced myodil (iophendylate) due to its advantages like freely miscible with CSF, flows along subarachnoid spaces around the nerve roots & is absorbed from subarachnoid space within 48 hours.# They are isotonic with CSF in concentration usually used for lumbar myelography, made upto a volume of 10 cc.# They also have low viscosity and thus a narrow bone needle can be used.# Reactions like headache, nausea seldom last for more than 24 hours.# Arachnoiditis is severe most complication, however with newer contrast, it is extremely uncommon.- Iohexol (omnipaque) is nonionic contrast commonly used today. Iohexol has more evenly distributed OH groups hence has less subarachnoid toxicity.# MRI has replaced myelography and CT myelography.",
