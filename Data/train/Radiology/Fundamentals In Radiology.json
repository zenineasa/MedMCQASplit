Explanation: Bragg peak is a concept utilized in giving focused radiotherapy using ionizing radiation to a tumor without affecting the normal healthy surrounding tissues. Options B. C and D are examples of non-ionizing radiation. Bragg's peak. The Bragg peak is a peak on the Bragg curve which plots the energy loss of ionizing radiation during its travel through matter. For protons, a-rays and other ion rays, the peak occurs immediately before the particles come to rest. This is called Bragg peak. When a fast charged particle moves through matter, it ionizes atoms of the material and deposits a dose along its path. A peak occurs because the interaction cross section increases as the charged particle's energy decreases. Absorption of a beam of energetic photons (X- ravs) which is entirely different in nature; the curve is mainly exponential. The phenomenon is exploited in particle therapy of cancer, to concentrate the effect of light ion beams on the tumor being treated while minimizing the effect on the surrounding healthy tissue. Monenergistic proton beam with the sharp peak is widened by increasing the range of energies, so that a larger tumor volume can be treated. This can be achieved by using variable thickness attenuators like spinning wedges.",

Radioactive iodine, released in nuclear plant accidents, is the best known member of this group.- Plastic layers and clothing can stop most beta particles, and their penetration is measured to be a few millimeters. A large quantum of energy to the basal stratum of the skin can cause a bum that is similar to a thermal burn and is treated as such.- Pure beta emitters (Phosphorous, Strontium, Samarium, Rhenium, Yttrium, and Iodine) are used in systemic radio- therapy (e. g. strontium-89 - 8. Gy in single fraction - for palliative treatment of painful bone metastases)# Gamma (y) rays and x-rays (both photons) are similar.- Gamma rays are uncharged electromagnetic radiation (non-particulate) discharged from a nucleus as a wave or photons of energy.- Gamma (y) rays have highest penetrating power and least ionization potential.# X-rays- Are the result of abrupt mechanical deceleration of electrons striking a heavy target such as tungsten.- Gamma and X-rays have similar properties, i. e., no charge and no mass, just energy.- Both travel easily through matter, sometimes called penetrating radiation, and are the principal type of radiation to cause total-body exposure.# Neutrons (N) particles- Are heavy and uncharged, often emitted during nuclear detonation.- They possess a wide energy range; their ability to penetrate tissues is variable, depending upon their energy.- They are less likely to be present in most scenarios of radiation bioterrorism.- Neutron therapy is tried in treatment of brain tumors (e. g., cystic gliomas) - BNCT. Califomum is its importantsource.- The ionization resulting from protons, electrons, and gamma rays is either a direct or indirect (i. e., mediated through water - free radical injury) effect of particles or photons on DNA.- Ionization of DNA resulting from neutrons is secondary to the neutrons knocking electrons out of their atomic orbit and the formation of free radicals, which can also damage DNA directly.

        "question": "Which of the following radiation is not emited by radio- active isotope?",
        "exp": "Ans. A. X-rays. Alpha, beta and gamma rays are produced by radioactive isotopes, while x - rays are extranuclear in origin produced by bombarding fast moving electrons on the anode (target) of the x-ray tube (in X-ray machine or Linear acclerator). Ionization involves actual ejection of one or more electrons from the atom. Ionizing radiation is subclassified as electro- magnetic (photon) or particulate radiation. X-rays and gamma rays are examples of electromagnetic photon radiation; they differ only in their source. X-rays are produced mechanically, by making electrons strike a target, which causes the electrons to give up their kinetic energy as x-rays, while gamma rays are produced by nuclear disintegra- tion of radioactive isotopes. X-rays can be thought of as packets of energy, or photons. X-rays have no mass or charge, travel in straight lines, and attenuate continuously as they traverse tissue. X-rays differ from light in energy. Discussion:# Types of particulate radiation include electrons, protons, alpha particles, neutrons, negative pi-mesons, and heavy charged ions; these have discrete mass and charge (except for neutrons, which lack charge;- Alpha particles are helium nuclei, consisting of two protons and two neutrons. The mass and charge are great enough that these particles do not penetrate far through matter unless they have tremendous energy; even a piece of paper is enough to protect against most alpha particles. Because these particles are charged, they can be accelerated in electrical fields.- Electrons. or beta particles. are small and negatively charged and can be accelerated to close to the speed of light. They decelerate fairly rapidly in tissue and penetrate it to only a limited depth. Thus, electron beams are often used to treat superficial problems.- Protons are positively charged and have a mass about 2000 times that of an electron. Protons stop abruptly, depending on their energy; in the process of sudden deceleration, most of their energy is given up, which tends to cause ionization just before the proton stops. This region of enhanced ionization, sometimes called the Bragg peak, means that proton beams exert their effects in a relatively compact region. Therefore, protons may have advantages over other types of particulate radiation with respect to conforming the dose to the treat- ment volume.- Neutrons are similar in mass to protons (having an atomic mass of 1), but they are not charged and therefore cannot be accelerated in an electrical field. Neutron beams are produced by colliding charged particles into a suitable target or are emitted as a fission product of heavy radioactiveatoms. Heavycharged ions are nuclei of heavier elements that have a positive charge owing to the stripping away of some or all of the orbiting electrons. Additional Educational points: 1. Linear accelerator (Linac). Used to accelerate electrons, & produces X-ray beam2. Cyclotron. Produces neutrons, photons3. Microtron.

Apparatus that uses a diagnostic X-ray tube but duplicates a radiation t/t. Main function is to display the t/t field to accurately deliver the dose.

RADIOISOTOPESA radioactive substance is one which is unstable and spontaneously decays to form a more stable substance, giving out electromagnetic rays. RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS1. Naturally occurring radioactive materials# All naturally occurring radioactive materials have atomic number greater than 80 and are grouped in three radioactive families starting with uranium, thorium and actinum.# All elements with atomic no > 82 are radioactive.# It appears that as the no. of particles inside the nucleus increases, the forces that keep the particles together become less effective since chance of particle emission are increased. 2. Radioactive 'Induced\" bv neutron bombardment. Also called n-g reaction. Here the neutron enters the nucleus and some energy is liberated in the form of gamma ray. 3. Radioactive 'Induced\" bv proton bombardment. Also called p-n reaction and is caused by the proton bombardment of nucleus. The proton is positively charged. So there is increase in the electrostatic repulsion of the proton as it approaches the nucleus and the proton needs considerable energy to achieve the desired penetration. For this purpose the protons have to be accelerated in a CYCLOTRON.",

The hyperlucent gas shadow below the diaphragm suggests that there is no subdiaphragmatic pathology Unilateral elevation of the hemidiaphragm can be seen as a result of an enlargement or displacement of an abdominal organ, a subpulmonic process such as effusion, loss of volume of the lung with lobar atelectasis or surgical resection, or hemidiaphragmatic paralysis. Diaphragmatic paralysis results from interruption of the phrenic nerve supply to the diaphragm. The most common cause is malignancy, such as bronchogenic carcinoma, or postsurgical trauma. Twenty percent of patients who undergo open hea surgery sustain injury to the phrenic nerve. Other causes of diaphragmatic paralysis include polio, herpes, infections, lead poisoning, pulmonary infarctions, pneumonia, mediastinitis, and pericarditis. The diagnosis of unilateral paralysis of the diaphragm is suggested by the finding of an elevated hemidiaphragm on the chest x-ray. With diaphragmatic paralysis, the negative pleural pressure tends to pull the paralyzed diaphragm upward. Normally the right diaphragm is about 3 cm higher than the left. Confirmation of diaphragmatic paralysis is established by the sniff test. In this test the diaphragm is observed fluoroscopically as the patient sniffs. The normal diaphragm is moved downward during the sniff maneuver as the diaphragmatic muscles contract. A paralyzed diaphragm moves paradoxically upward because of negative pleural pressure. Patients with paralyzed diaphragms may be asymptomatic or may complain of dyspnea on lying down or with exeion. With complete paralysis, vital capacity and total lung capacity may be reduced about 25% from the baseline, and the maximum inspiratory pressure is reduced to about 40%",

        "exp": "Ans: (b) Gadoxetate. Ref: J Magn Resort Imaging, 2012 Nov; 36(5): 1060-71 5. Hepatobiliary MRI contrast agents are specialised agents used to aid diagnosis in MRI. They are separated into three categories: gadolinium-based agents, manganese-based agents and superparamagnetic iron oxide particles. Gadolinium-based Agents. Hepatobiliary specific gadolinium agents include two of the high relaxivity agents: gadobenate disodium (Gd-BOPTA) and gadoxetate disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA). Gadoxetate disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA): has almost equal biliary and renal excretion ( 50% each). Compared to gadobenate, it has more intense liver parenchymal enhancement. Manganese-based Agents. Mangafodipir trisodium (Mn-DPDP) is specifically taken up by hepatocytes due to its chemical similarity to Vitamin B6. This property results in the increase in signal intensity of normal hepatic parenchyma, giving high lesion-liver contrast. Unlike the gadolinium agents, mangafodipir trisodium readily dissociates to yield free manganese ions. This in vivo instability of the chelate rose concerns about potential toxicity. Free manganese, in chronic exposure, causes a parkinsonism-like syndrome due to accumulation in the brain, other neurological features and cardiac suppression. Hence, mangafodipir trisodium was effectively withdrawn from the market. Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Particles. Superparamagnetic iron oxide particles do not leak into the interstitium. They, therefore, act as intravascular contrast agents or blood pool agents as long as the vessel endothelium is intact and unaltered by any pathological process. Their elimination from the blood is by uptake into the reticuloendothelial system cells in liver, spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes and are phagocytosed by macrophages throughout the body. The superparamagnetic iron oxide particles agents are preferentially entrapped by the Kupffer cells in the liver and spleen and reduce their T2 relaxation time. Thus, normal liver appears dark on T2 weighted images. Most liver tumours which are usually deficient in Kupffer cells, do not exhibit superparamagnetic iron oxide particles agent uptake and appear relatively hyperintense.",

Lead apron* A lead apron or leaded apron is a type of protective clothing that acts as a radiation shield. It is constructed of a thin rubber exterior and an interior of lead in the shape of a hospital apron. The purpose of the lead apron is to reduce exposure of a hospital patient to x-rays to vital organs that are potentially exposed to ionizing radiation during medical imaging that uses x-rays (radiography, fluoroscopy, computed tomography).* Lead can effectively attenuate certain kinds of radiation because of its high density and high atomic number; principally, it is effective at stopping gamma rays and x-rays.* Protection of the reproductive organs with a lead apron is considered important.* The thyroid gland is especially vulnerable to x-ray exposure. Care should be taken to place a lead apron over the thyroid gland before taking dental radiographs.",

TREATMENT OF RADIONUCLIDE CONTAMINATIONTreatment for internal radionuclide contamination, also referred to as decorporation, should be started as soon as possible after suspected or known exposure. The goal is to leave the smallest amount of radionuclides possible in the body. Treatment is given to reduce absorption and enhance elimination and excretion. Clearance of the Gl tract may be achieved by stomach lavage, with emetics (such as apomorphine, 5 to 10 mg, or ipecac, 1- to 2-g capsules or 15 mL in syrup), or by using purgatives, laxatives, ion exchangers, and aluminum antacids. Prussian blue: to treat cesium 137 internal contamination. Aluminum antacids: to reduce strontium uptake in the gut. Prevention or reversal of radionuclide interaction with tissues by blocking, diluting, mobilizing, and chelating agents. Blocking agents prevent the entrance of radioactive materials. Potassium iodide (Kl), which blocks the uptake of radioactive iodine (131l) by the thyroid. Other thyroid-blocking agents include prophylthiouracil, methimazole. Diluting agents decrease the absorption of the radionuclide. Water may be used as a diluting agent in the treatment for tritium (3H) contamination and for barium overdosage. Mobilizing agents are most effective when given immediately. These agents include antithyroid drugs, parathyroid extract, glucocorticoids, ammonium chloride, diuretics, expectorants, and inhalants. All of them should induce the release of radionuclides from tissues. Chelating agents can bind many radioactive materials, after which the complexes are excreted from the human body. DTPA was approved to treat internal contamination with plutonium, americium, and curium, but it also chelates berkelium, californium, and any material with an atomic number >92. Ca-DTPA is more effective than Zn-DTPA during the first 24 hours after internal contamination, and both drugs are equally effective after the initial 24 hours. If both drugs are available, Ca-DTPA should be given as the first dose. Nebulized Zn-DTPA is recommended if the internal contamination is only by inhalation. The IV route is recommended and should be used if the route of internal contamination is not known or if multiple routes of internal contamination are likely. Treating uranium contamination with DTPA is contraindicated due to its synergistic damage to the kidneys. Lung lavage can reduce radiation-induced pneumonitis and is indicated only when a large amount of radionuclide enters the lungs and has the potential for acute radiation injury.

This is only true for a mono-energetic beam. X-ray beams consist of photons with varying energies (poly- energetic).

Radiation is energy that travels in the form of waves or high-speed particles. Radiation has a wide range of energies that span the electromagnetic spectrum; it can be divided into nonionizing and ionizing radiation. The energy of nonionizing radiation such as UV and infrared light, microwave, and sound waves, can move atoms in a molecule or cause them to vibrate, but is not sufficient to displace bound electrons from atoms. By contrast, ionizing radiation has sufficient energy to remove tightly bound electrons. Collision of electrons with other molecules releases electrons in a reaction cascade, referred to as ionization. The main sources of ionizing radiation are x-rays and gamma rays (electromagnetic waves of very high frequencies), high-energy neutrons, alpha particles (composed of two protons and two neutrons), and beta particles, which are essentially electrons. At equi%ralent amounts of energy, alpha particles induce heavy damage in a restricted area, whereas x-rays and gamma rays dissipate energy over a longer, deeper course, and produce considerably less damage per unit of tissue. About 50% of the total dose of ionizing radiation received by the U. S. population is human-made, mostly originating from medical devices and radioisotopes. In fact, the exposure of patients to ionizing radiation during radiologic imaging tests roughly doubled between the early 1980s and 2006, mainly because of much more widespread use of CT scans. Ionizing radiation is a double-edged sword. It is indispensable in medical practice, being used in the treatment of cancer, in diagnostic imaging, and in therapeutic or diagnostic radioisotopes, but it also produces adverse short- and longterm effects such as fibrosis, mutagenesis, carcinogenesis. and teratogenesis.",

The activity of a radioactive material is the number of nuclear disintegration per unit of time. The unit of activity is a becquerel (Bq); 1 Bq is equal to 1 disintegration per second. Formerly, the unit of avtivity was curie (Ci) and 1 Bq corresponds approximately to 27 picocuries. The potency of radiation is measured in THREE (three)ways (1) Roentgen: Roentgen is the unit of exposure. It is the amount of radiation absorbed in air at a given point, i. e., number of ions produced in 1 ml of air. (2) Rad: Rad is the unit of absorbed dose. It is the amount of radioactive energy absorbed per gram of tissue or any material. 1 mrad = 0. 0001 rad (3) Rem: Rem is the product of the absorbed dose and the modifying factors. The rem indicates the degree of potential danger to health. The radiation to which the average citizen is expected is made up almost of the fast moving, highly penetrating X-rays and gamma rays, where rem and rad are equal (2). The radiation units (viz roentgen, rad rem) are replaced by the new SI Units (International System of Units) which are: (a) Coulomb per kilogram (C/kg) replacing the reontgen. 1 roentgen is equal to 2. 58 x 10'4 C/kg1. It is the unit for exposure. There is no special name for this, (b) Gray (Gy) replacing the rad. It is the unit of absorbed dose, defined as the dose of ionizing radiation that impart 1 joule of energy to 1 kg of absorbing material. 1 rad is equal to 0. 01 Gy. (1), and (c) Sievert (Sv) replacing the rem. It is the SI unit of dose equivalent. The dose equivalent of 1 sievert is equal to 100 rems. Dose equivalent (H): As all types of radiation do not produce the same biological effect per unit of energy absorbed, the concept of dose equivalent has been introduced. The dose equivalent, M (Sieverts) is equal to the absorbed dose, D (grays), M (Sieverts) is equal to the absorbed dose, D (grays), multiplied by a quality factor Q which depends upon the density of ionization produced in the tissue by the radiation. H = DQThe factor Q for X-rays and Y-rays and electrons is equal to 1, whereas for a particle it is 20 (3). ARADIATION UNITSConventional Units.

Bq=l disinteg/sec)A. Radioactivity# The number of times each second a radioactive material decays and releases radiation. The old unit is curile curie & new unit is Bq. B. Absorbed Dose# The amount of radiation energy absorbed into a given mass of tissue.# Absorbed dose is the radiation quantity used to express the concentration of radiation energy actually absorbed in a specific tissue. This is the quantity that is most directly related to biological effects.# Dose values can be in the traditional unit of the rad or the SI unit of the gray (Gy).# The rad is equivalent to 100 ergs of energy absorbed in a gram of tissue and the gray is one joule of energy absorbed per kilogram of tissue. 1 gray (Gy) = 100 rads10 m. Gy = 1 rad1 m. Gy = 100 mradC. Dose (Equivalent)# Measures the energy per unit mass times adjustments for the type of radiation involved (quality factor) and the biological response in the tissue (a weighting factor).# Equivalent dose converts dose into an estimate of risk.# They are quantities that can be measured and expressed in terms of the more fundamental physical quantities like energy. Dose Equivalent, in the unit, sievert (Sv), is a quantity that expresses the relative biological impact of the radiation by including a radiation weighting factor (wR).# The relationship is: Dose Equivalent (Sv) = Dose (Gy) x wR. The value of the radiation weighting factor (wR) is a characteristic of each specific type of radiation. D. Effective Dose# It is actually a simple and very logical concept. It takes into account the specific organs and areas of the body that are exposed.# The point is that all parts of the body and organs are not equally sensitive to the possible adverse effects of radiation, such as cancer induction and mutations.# For the purpose of determining effective dose, the different areas and organs have been assigned tissue weighting factor (wT) values.# For a specific organ or body area the effective dose is: Efective Dose (Gy) = Absorbed Dose (Gy) x w. TEducational Points. CELL CYCLE AND RADIATION# G2-M interphase is most radiosensitive. (G2M interphase > M > G2)# The cell is vulnerable to radiation in the stage of mitosis (M), less so during synthesis (S) and relatively insensitive during resting periods.# 'S' phase is the most radioresistant phase of cell cycle.# But, 'S' phase is the most chemosensitive phase of cell cycle.# Radiosensitivity of a cell also depends on its histological type and oxygenation of the tissues. RADIOBIOLOGY# Four important processes that occur after radiation exposure can be summarized as the ' four R's\" of radiobiology- The first is repair. Repair is temperature dependent and is thought to represent the enzymatic mechanisms for healing intracellular injury.- The second R is reoxygenation, a process whereby oxygen (and other nutrients) are actually better distributed to viable cells following radiation injury and cell killing.- The third R is repopulation, the ability of the cell population to continue to divide and to replace dying and dead cells.- The fourth R is redistribution, which reflects the variability of a cell's radiosensitivity over the cell cycle.",

Hounsfield's number (CT number)* Hounsfield's contribution is memorialized in the Hounsfield scale, which is used to measure the X-ray attenuation in CT scanning.* The basic parameter in a CT image is CT number. The CT number is defined with respect to water X-ray absorption and is dependent on absorption / attenuation coefficient.* When an X-ray beam (used in CT) passes through the body, there is a logarithmic attenuation of its intensity over distance. A measurement of the intensity of the exiting beam is known as the linear attenuation coefficient when the attenuation thickness is 1 cm. The linear attenuation coefficient is related to the absorption in the material. This depends upon the energy of the X-ray beam and the type of material being irradiated. CT images are map of the relative linear attenuation coefficient of tissues. The relative attenuation coefficient is normally expressed in Hounsfield units (HU) or CT number.

She requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. On the second ICU day, she is difficult to ventilate, requiring increased airway pressures. On physical examination, vital signs are: pulse 159 bpm; temperature 100degF; blood pressure 90/56 mm Hg. Lung exam reveals diffuse crackles, and the patient has a palpable crunch on exam of her chest wall and abdomen. Chest radiograph is shown below.. What will you do next?",
        "exp": "This poable chest x-ray taken in the ICU shows an intubated patient with hyperlucent lines in the soft tissue with striations along the fibromuscular bundles of the neck and chest musculature. There is a faint paracardiac hyperlucent line representing air around the pericardium. The diaphragm leaflets are seen clearly across the midline due to the contrasting air shadow representing the \"continuous diaphragm sign\". All the signs mentioned are representative of a pneumomediastinum. The lower edge of the diaphragm is also visible due to a pneumoperitoneum. Alveolar rupture with increased alveolar-interstitial space gradient can cause pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. Subcutaneous emphysema may occur after trauma such as esophageal rupture with direct introduction of air in the mediastinum. It can also occur where there is abdominal and thoracic muscular contraction against a closed glottis. Infection with a gas-forming organism can cause subcutaneous gas formation. Inflammatory bronchiolitis or overinflated alveoli due to mechanical ventilation can cause alveolar rupture, especially if there is airway obstruction with air moving along the bronchovascular sheaths. Pneumomediastinum refers to abnormal air collection within the mediastinum. Air can dissect into the mediastinum from areas of the neck and thorax or from the GI tract or lungs. Pathologically there is continuity between the periaerial and the peribronchial interstitium when an alveolar rupture occurs, creating an air collection within the interstitial connective tissues. Patient-related factors that are found to predispose to volutrauma include lung disease that weakens alveolar walls, such as COPD and necrotizing pneumonia. Mediastinal air accumulates and then decompresses into the subcutaneous tissues and the retroperiteoneal areas. Later, mediastinal pleura may rupture, resulting in a pneumothorax. The Hamman sign, a crunching sound synchronous with the cardiac cycle, is seen in 40% to 50% of patients with pneumomediastinum. When the pneumomediastinum extends caudally, it shows a so-called \"continuous diaphragm sign. \" Treatment is usually conservative, with attempts to reduce airway resistance with bronchodilator therapy and minimize tidal volume and plateau pressure.",
