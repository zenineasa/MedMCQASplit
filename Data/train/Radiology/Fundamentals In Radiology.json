The hyperlucent gas shadow below the diaphragm suggests that there is no subdiaphragmatic pathology Unilateral elevation of the hemidiaphragm can be seen as a result of an enlargement or displacement of an abdominal organ, a subpulmonic process such as effusion, loss of volume of the lung with lobar atelectasis or surgical resection, or hemidiaphragmatic paralysis. Diaphragmatic paralysis results from interruption of the phrenic nerve supply to the diaphragm. The most common cause is malignancy, such as bronchogenic carcinoma, or postsurgical trauma. Twenty percent of patients who undergo open hea surgery sustain injury to the phrenic nerve. Other causes of diaphragmatic paralysis include polio, herpes, infections, lead poisoning, pulmonary infarctions, pneumonia, mediastinitis, and pericarditis. The diagnosis of unilateral paralysis of the diaphragm is suggested by the finding of an elevated hemidiaphragm on the chest x-ray. With diaphragmatic paralysis, the negative pleural pressure tends to pull the paralyzed diaphragm upward. Normally the right diaphragm is about 3 cm higher than the left. Confirmation of diaphragmatic paralysis is established by the sniff test. In this test the diaphragm is observed fluoroscopically as the patient sniffs. The normal diaphragm is moved downward during the sniff maneuver as the diaphragmatic muscles contract. A paralyzed diaphragm moves paradoxically upward because of negative pleural pressure. Patients with paralyzed diaphragms may be asymptomatic or may complain of dyspnea on lying down or with exeion. With complete paralysis, vital capacity and total lung capacity may be reduced about 25% from the baseline, and the maximum inspiratory pressure is reduced to about 40%",

She requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. On the second ICU day, she is difficult to ventilate, requiring increased airway pressures. On physical examination, vital signs are: pulse 159 bpm; temperature 100degF; blood pressure 90/56 mm Hg. Lung exam reveals diffuse crackles, and the patient has a palpable crunch on exam of her chest wall and abdomen. Chest radiograph is shown below.. What will you do next?",
        "exp": "This poable chest x-ray taken in the ICU shows an intubated patient with hyperlucent lines in the soft tissue with striations along the fibromuscular bundles of the neck and chest musculature. There is a faint paracardiac hyperlucent line representing air around the pericardium. The diaphragm leaflets are seen clearly across the midline due to the contrasting air shadow representing the \"continuous diaphragm sign\". All the signs mentioned are representative of a pneumomediastinum. The lower edge of the diaphragm is also visible due to a pneumoperitoneum. Alveolar rupture with increased alveolar-interstitial space gradient can cause pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. Subcutaneous emphysema may occur after trauma such as esophageal rupture with direct introduction of air in the mediastinum. It can also occur where there is abdominal and thoracic muscular contraction against a closed glottis. Infection with a gas-forming organism can cause subcutaneous gas formation. Inflammatory bronchiolitis or overinflated alveoli due to mechanical ventilation can cause alveolar rupture, especially if there is airway obstruction with air moving along the bronchovascular sheaths. Pneumomediastinum refers to abnormal air collection within the mediastinum. Air can dissect into the mediastinum from areas of the neck and thorax or from the GI tract or lungs. Pathologically there is continuity between the periaerial and the peribronchial interstitium when an alveolar rupture occurs, creating an air collection within the interstitial connective tissues. Patient-related factors that are found to predispose to volutrauma include lung disease that weakens alveolar walls, such as COPD and necrotizing pneumonia. Mediastinal air accumulates and then decompresses into the subcutaneous tissues and the retroperiteoneal areas. Later, mediastinal pleura may rupture, resulting in a pneumothorax. The Hamman sign, a crunching sound synchronous with the cardiac cycle, is seen in 40% to 50% of patients with pneumomediastinum. When the pneumomediastinum extends caudally, it shows a so-called \"continuous diaphragm sign.\" Treatment is usually conservative, with attempts to reduce airway resistance with bronchodilator therapy and minimize tidal volume and plateau pressure.",
