Radiosurgery is a medical procedure that allows non-invasive treatment of benign and malignant tumors. It is also known as stereotactic radiotherapy, (SRT) when used to target lesions in the brain, and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) when used to target lesions in the body. Inaddition to cancer, it has also been shown to be beneficial for the treatment of some non-cancerous conditions, including functional disorders such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and trigeminal neuralgia.",

Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) should be considered in all patients with LD (local disease) - and ED (extended disease)-Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who has responded to initial therapy. A meta-analysis including 7 trials and 987 patients with LD-SCLC who had achieved a complete remission following primary chemotherapy reported a 5. 4% improvement in overall survival for patients treated with PCI. In patients with ED-SCLC who had responded to first- line chemotherapy, PCI reduced the occurrence of symptomatic brain metastases and prolonged disease-free and overall survival compared to no radiation therapy. Long-term toxicides includingdeficits in cognition have been reported following PCI and are difficult to sort out from the effects of chemotherapy or normal aging.",

Stereotactic radiosurgery involves the delivery of a concentrated dose of radiation to a defined volume in the brainQ. Two methods of frame-based stereotactic radiosurgery are currently widely used. Gamma knife uses cobalt-201Q radiation sources focused on one point. Modified linear acceleratorsQ deliver the radiation dose in multiple arcs, thereby minimizing the effect on surrounding brain tissue. Primary risks of stereotactic radiosurgery are radiation necrosis and radiation injury to surrounding structures.
