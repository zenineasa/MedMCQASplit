Homer Wright rosette: typically seen in neuroblastomas, medulloblastomas, and primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs). It consists of a halo of tumor cells surrounding a central region containing neuropil. 2. Flexner-Wintersteiner Rosette: characteristic of retinoblastomas. It consists of tumor cells surrounding a central lumen that contains cytoplasmic extensions from the tumor cells. 3. True Ependymal Rosette: consists of tumor cells surrounding an empty lumen. Are characteristic of ependymoma, but not seen in all cases. 4. Perivascular Pseudorosette: consists of tumor cells collected around a blood vessel. It's called a pseudorosette because the central structure isn't part of the tumor. These rosettes are common in ependymomas, but you also see them in medulloblastoma, PNET, central neurocytomas, and glioblastomas. EWING'S SARCOMA# Incidence: Constitutes ~10 to 15% of all bone sarcomas.# Age: Peak incidence in the second decade of life.# Origin: Arises in the medullary cavity of the bones.# Location: involves the diaphyseal region of long bones (especially femur) & flat bones (especially pelvis).# X-ray: permeative destructive lytic lesion with \"onion peel\" periosteal reaction with soft tissue mass.# Histopathology:- It is composed of sheets of monotonous, small, round, blue cells and can be confused with lymphoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and small-cell carcinoma.- The cells are rich in glycogen (PAS positive cells). 6- The presence of \"Homer-Wright rosettes\" is indicative of neural differentiation.- Most PNETs arise in soft tissues; they include:* Peripheral neuroepithelioma, * Askin's tumor (chest wall), and* Esthesioneuroblastoma.- The presence of p30/32, the product of the mic-2 gene (which maps to the pseudoautosomal region of the X and Y chromosomes) is a cell-surface marker for Ewing's sarcoma (PNETs).- The classic cytogenetic abnormality associated with this disease (and other PNETs) is t(11; 22).- CD99 +.# It is very aggressive tumor and considered a systemic disease and mimics acute osteomyelitis.# Common sites of metastases are lung, bones (bone to bone metastases/), and bone marrow.# Rx:# Systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of therapy, often being used before surgery.# Local treatment for the primary tumor includes surgical resection, usually with limb salvage or radiation.# Ewing's is a curable tumor, even in the presence of obvious metastasis, especially in children <11 years old.

Osteosarcoma is relatively radioresistant and wide surgical resection and chemotherapy is the RX. There is no role of RT in Rx of Aneurysmal bone cyst and Chondroblastoma. EWING'S SARCOMA# Ill-defined osteolytic medullary lesion involving diaphysis.# Small round cell PNET tumor.# Age group 5-15 years with 75% patients being under the age of 20 years and having male predilection.# Extension along the length of the marrow with permeative bone destruction.# Cortical saucerization.# Classical multilaminar periosteal reaction giving 'onion-peel' appearance.# Codmann's triangles with elevated periosteum.# Soft tissue mass disproportionately large compared to the extent of osseous involvement, resembling osteomyelitis.# Bone tumor metastasizing to bone.# Ewing's sarcoma is the highly malignant primary bone neoplasm having specific cytogenetic analysis i. e. t( 11, 22), is a PNET.# CD99 is important marker# It is thought to be radiosensitive bone tumor, and supposed to melt with radiotherapy. However, Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for Ewing's primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) and rhabdomyosarcomas. External beam radiation therapy is an adjuvant to limb-sparing surgery for improved local control. Preoperative radiation therapy allows the use of smaller fields and smaller doses but results in a higher rate of wound complications. Postoperative radiation therapy must be given to larger fields, as the entire surgical bed must be encompassed, and in higher doses to compensate for hypoxia in the operated field. This results in a higher rate of late complications. Brachytherapy or interstitial therapy, in which the radiation source is inserted into the tumor bed, is comparable in efficacy (except in low- grade lesions), less time-consuming, and less expensive. Although Ewing's sarcoma is radiosensitive, systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of therapy, often being used before surgery. Doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide, etoposide, vincristine, and dactinomycin are active drugs. Topotecan or irinotecan in combination with an alkylating agent are often used in relapsed patients. Targeted therapy with an anti IGF 1 alpha antibody appears to have promising activity in refractory cases. Local treatment for the primary tumor includes surgical resection, usually with limb salvage or radiation therapy.",

It is cause by axial compression force (with or without extension force), resulting from a fall on the head from a height or mass falling on head. This mechanism of injury results in a burst fracture of ring of atlas (Cl) vertebrae, that occurs secondary to the occipital condyles being driven into the interior portions of the ring of atlas and driving the lateral masses outwards. 2. Lateral displacement of Cl lateral mass lateral the outer cortex of the C2 lateral mass raises concerns for the structural integrity of the transverse Atlantal ligament (TAL). The stability of atlas depends on TAL. 3. Due to outward movement of lateral masses, there is no encroachment on the neural canal and, usually, no neurological damage. 4. Classical Jefferson's fracture (as described by Jefferson in 1920) was four-part fracture of ring of atlas (2 part of anterior ring & 2 part of posterior ring). However more common are two part or three part fractures. 5. It is typically diagnosed on plain radiographsa. Open mouth (odontoid) view may show asymmetry of the lateral masses of Cl on C2 with overhang. b.

Disseminated form - scattered, axial skeleton predominant site; vertebrae (50%), distribution correlates with normal sites of red marrow). Solitary form - vertebrae > pelvis > skull > sternum > ribs. Spinal Plasma Cell Myeloma - sparing of posterior elements, paraspinal soft-tissue mass with extradural extension, scalloping of anterior margin of vertebral bodies. Generalized osteoporosis with accentuation of trabecular pattern. Punched out appearance of widespread osteolytic areas with endosteal scalloping & uniform size, Diffuse osteolysis, Expansile osteolytic lesions in ribs, pelvis, long bones, Soft-tissue mass adjacent to bone destruction. Sclerosis may occur after chemotherapy, radiotherapy, fluoride administration. Sclerotic form of multiple myeloma is associated with Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrine abnormalities, M-protein, Skin changes. Other Options[?]. Paget's disease (Osteitis Deformans): Multiple chronic skeletal disease due to paramyxoviral infection causes resorption and bone formation. The newly formed bone is abnormally soft with disorganized trabecular pattern (\"mosaic pattern\") causing deformity.-Active phase: Osteolytic phase (aggressive bone resorption with lytic lesions).-Inactive phase: Quiescent phase (| bone turnover with skeletal sclerosis).-Mixed pattern is common (lytic & sclerotic phases coexist). Skull - Inner & outer table thickening & Skull becomes larger (Soldier's helmet), diploic widening, osteoporosis circumscripta, \"cotton wool\" appearance, sclerosis of base of skull, Facial bones are usually not affected. Long bones - \"Candle flame\" or \"Blade of grass\" lysis results fracture. Pelvis - protrusio acetabulae, thickened trabeculae. Spine - Upper cervical, low dorsal, midlumbar vertebral involvement, \"picture frame vertebra\" (bone-within-bone), \"ivory vertebra\", ossification of spinal ligaments, paravertebral soft tissue, disk spaces. Bone scan - Increased uptake. [?]. Eosinophilic granuloma = most benign variety of LCH localized to bone. Location: bone (in children) or lung (in adults). Sites: Mostly diaphyseal; epiphyseal lesions are uncommon; Expansile lytic lesion with ill-defined / sclerotic edges; Endosteal scalloping, widening of medullary cavity; Cortical thinning, intracortical tunneling; Erosion of cortex + soft-tissue mass; Laminated periosteal reaction (frequent), may show interruptions; May appear rapidly within 3 weeks; Lesions respect joint space + growth plate. Prognosis: Excellent with spontaneous resolution of bone lesions in 6-18 months. [?]. Osteomyelitis: Acute Osteomyelitis: Initial X-rays often normal (as long as 10 days), localized soft-tissue swelling, area of bone destruction (lags 7-14 days behind pathologic changes)-Involucrum (new bone formation), periosteal reaction (develops after 20 days), sequestrum (detached dead bone appears dense radiologically), cloaca formation.-Chronic Osteomyelitis: Thick irregular sclerotic bone with radiolu- cencies, elevated psriosteum, chronic draining sinus.-Sclerosing Osteomyelitis of Garre -- Focal bulge of thickened cortex (sclerosing periosteal reaction). Brodie Abscess: Subacute pyogenic osteomyelitis (smouldering indolent infection), Central area of lucency surrounded by dense rim of reactive sclerosis. BONE SCANS (local in radiopharmaceutical uptake (positive within 24-72 hours)). Ga-67 scans - 100% sensitivity; increased uptake 1 day earlier than for Tc-99m MDP (Gallium helpful for chronic osteomyelitis). Static Tc-99m diphosphonate - 83% sensitivity. Three-phase skeletal scintigraphy - 92% sensitivity, 87% specificity. Phase: 1: Radionuclide angiography (profusion phase of regional blood flow); 2: \"blood pool\" images; 3: \"bone uptake\"WBC-scan--In-111-labeled leukocytes - best agent for acute infections--Tc-99m labeled leukocytes - preferred over in 111-leukocyte imaging especially in extremities.--WBC scans have largely replaced gallium imaging for acute osteomyelitis.",

Osteochondroma- Most common benign bone tumor.- The commonest site is in the femur or the tibia around the knee.- They have bony pedicle which grows away from the epiphyseal plate and is covered in a large cartilage cap.- If they become painful or cap > 20 mm thick, possibility of malignant change considered. Osteoid osteoma- Most common true benign tumor of bone.- These benign tumours occur in children, adolescents and young adults.- They are commonest in the femur and tibia but can occur elsewhere, even in the spine.- Typically produce a constant aching pain, most noticeable at night and is sometimes relieved by aspirin.- CT most diagnostic and appears as sclerotic lesion with the characteristic radiolucent nidus.- Osteoid osteomas also show up very hot on radioisotope scans (double density sign).- Rx: RFA or Surgical excision. - common in the hands and the feet.- The condition of multiple enchondroma is called Oilier's disease. Multiple enchondroma with hemangioma is Maffuci's disease- Malignant change is not common but many chondromata when present this risk is increased. - have the same histological structure as fibrous cortical defects, but they are larger.- Most occur in children and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 20 years.- The x-ray appearance usually is characteristic with multilocular appearance or ridges in the bony wall, sclerotic scalloped borders, and erosion of the cortex.- Although most nonossifying fibromas regress spontaneously; If surgery is indicated, prefer curettage and allogenic bone grafting.

A triangular shadow on x-ray between the cortex and raised periosteum (Codman triangle) is characteristic of osteosarcomas. Osteosarcomas typically spread hematogenousiy; Osteosarcoma# Outside of myeloma and lymphoma, osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone, accounting for approximately 20% of primary bone cancers;# Osteosarcomas occur in all age groups but some 75% of patients are younger than age 20, with a second peak occuring in the elderly, usually with other conditions, including Paget disease, bone infarcts, and prior irradiation.# Men are more commonly affected than women (1. 6: 1). Although any bone can be involved, most tumors arise in the metaphyseal region of the long bones of the extremities, with almost 60% occurring about the knee, 15% around the hip, 10% at the shoulder, and 8% in the jaw.# The most common type of osteosarcoma is primary, solitary, intramedullary, and poorly differentiated, producing a predominantly bony matrix.# Osteosarcoma typically present as painful enlarging mass, although a pathologic fracture can be the first symptom.
