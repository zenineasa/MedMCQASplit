Because of increasing use of cross-sectional imaging, many of these tumours are detected as an incidental, asymptomatic finding.- On CT scans, sunburst central calcification in a spongy mass is pathognomonic of this tumour, but this finding occurs only in 10% of patients.- Endoscopic Ultrasonography (EUS) allows better resolution of the honeycomb structure than CT. At times, the cysts may be large, a feature that makes it difficult to differentiate these cysts from MCNs. g. Hypervascularity may be demonstrated on angiograms, and some tumours occur with intra-abdominal haemorrhage.-Analysis of the cyst fluid characteristically reveals low viscosity and low levels of CEA, with negative cytologic results for malignant cells, as the vast majority of serous cystadenomas are benign.-Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for symptomatic tumours and tumours that show continuous growth.-Many of these tumours may require a Whipple procedure or distal pancreatectomy, depending on the anatomic location. Distal pancreatectomy may be performed and the spleen can be preserved, given the absence of malignant potential. Mucinous cystic neoplasmsa. Nonenhanced CT scans show a well-defined, unilocular or multilocular, externally smooth, round-to-ovoid mass with fluid attenuation. b. The attenuation values of the multilocular cysts vary according to the degree of haemorrhage or protein in the mucoidc. Visualization of nodular or papillary excrescences with irregular borders of the septae is possible. If present, calcification is curvilinear or punctate and confined to the cyst wall or septa. Contrast-enhancedd. CT scans show enhancement of the cyst wall, internal septations, mural nodules, and other intracavitary projections. CT more clearly demonstrates the enhancement of cystic walls and septa than do other studies. e. Compared with serous cystic tumours, the cysts in MCNs are larger (>20 mm in diameter) and less numerous (usually <6). f. CT guided aspiration of the cyst can provide fuher diagnostic clues and enable their differentiation from other pancreatic cystic masses (eg, pseudocyst, serous cystadenoma, and solid and pseudopapillary neoplasm). g. MCN cyst fluid typically has a high viscosity, low amylase levels, and high CEA and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 72-4 levels, and they may show malignant cytology in patients with mucinous cystadenocarcinomas. h. Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and May Grunwald/Giemsa (MGG) stains are usually positive for extracellular as well as intracellular mucin. i. Treatment is the same as that of serous cystadenoma. (REF.

Most bladder calculi are round or oval, but they may also be amorphous, laminated, or even spiculated. Bladder stones are small mineral deposits that can form in the bladder. In most cases bladder stones develop when the urine becomes very concentrated or when one is dehydrated. This allows for minerals, such as calcium or magnesium salts, to crystallize and form stones. In some cases bladder stones do not cause any symptoms and are discovered as an incidental finding on a plain radiograph. Bladder stones vary in their size, shape and texture- some are small, hard and smooth whereas others are huge, spiked and very soft. One can have one or multiple stones. Bladder stones are somewhat more common in men who have prostate enlargement. The large prostate presses on the urethra and makes it difficult to pass urine. Over time, stagnant urine collects in the bladder and minerals like calcium sta to precipitate REF: DAVID SUTTON 6. TH ED",

In the majority of cases, these forces result in damage to the cells in a way that causes cell oedema. Imaging features. The diffuse axonal injury is characterized by multiple focal lesions with a characteristic distribution: typically located at the grey-white matter junction, in the corpus callosum and in more severe cases in the brainstem CTNon-contrast CT of the brain is routine in patients presenting with head injuries. But it is not terribly sensitive to subtle diffuse axonal injury. The appearance depends on whether or not the lesions are ovely hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic lesions will be hyperdense and range in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters in diameter. Non-hemorrhagic lesions are hypodense. They typically become more evident over the first few days as edema develops around them. They may be associated with significant and dispropoionate cerebral swelling. MRIMRI is the modality of choice for assessing suspected diffuse axonal injury even in patients with entirely normal CT of the brain. SWI or GRE sequences, exquisitely sensitive to paramagnetic blood products may demonstrate small regions of susceptibility aifact at the grey-white matter junction, in the corpus callosum or the brain stem. Some lesions may be entirely non-hemorrhagic (even using high field strength SWI sequences). These will, however, be visible as regions of high FLAIR signal. MR spectroscopy.

To make an image a selenium photoreceptor, or plate is charged to a uniform surface potential on the order of 1000 volts. When this photoreceptor is exposed to x-rays, its surface charge is depleted by photoconduction in amounts propoional to the radiation intensity striking it. A residual potential pattern which is a shadowgraph of the object being x-rayed is then formed. After exposure, the electrostatic image on the plate is developed by a powder cloud technique in which charged, pigmented paicles are blown over the plate and adhere to it in the pattern of the image. This powder or toner is the ink which defines the image. Following development, the toner is transferred to paper and fixed into a permanent image by low-temperature heat fusing.

Point A is recorded for all brachytherapy treatments, even those that use image-guided techniques. Point B - Representing the pelvic sidewall/obturator nodes, Point B is located 5 cm lateral to the midline at the same level as point A. It also gives a guide as to the lateral spread of the radiation dose. ICRU Repo 38. The ICRU released repo 38 regarding dosimetry of cervical cancer brachytherapy. It discouraged the use of Point A and Point B. It also recommended that bladder and rectal point doses be included. Bladder Point - After inseion of a Foley catheter, the balloon is inflated with 7 ml of contrast. The catheter is then pulled until the balloon rests against the urethra. The bladder point is the most posterior pa of an anteroposterior line drawn through the center of the balloon. Rectal Point - The rectal point is located 5 mm posterior to the posterior vaginal wall, along with a line perpendicular to the midpoint of the activity of the ovoids. The ICRU also recommended repoing of multiple other dose points, including pelvic wall points. These are not commonly repoed. The repoing of the dose delivered to the treatment volume was based on the length, width, and depth of the pear-shaped volume generated by the treatment.

Sonographically, this appears as an echolucent fluid collection between the soft tissue over the cervical spine and an echogenic line representing the skin edge. This fluid space is called the nuchal translucency (NT). The lucency is thought to represent mesenchymal edema and is often associated with distended jugular lymphatics. The prevailing theory suggests an alteration in lymphangiogenesis and delayed lymphatic development. Other possible etiologies include cardiac failure and abnormal extracellular matrix, but these do not explain the localized and transient nature of the NT. Most likely, the etiology is a complex interaction of factors. NT normally increases with advancing gestational age, and therefore the measurement is compared to crown-rump length (CRL). A thin NT is seen in most normal fetuses. An NT greater than 95% for CRL is considered thickened. An NT greater than 99% does not change significantly with CRL and is approximately 3. 5 mm(Ref: Diagnostic Ultrasound by Carol M. Rumack, Stephanie R. Wilson, J.

        "exp": "Causes for solitary pulmonary nodule: Granulomatous1. Tuberculoma - more common in the upper lobes and on the right side. Well-defined; 0. 5-4 cm. 25% are lobulated. Calcification frequent. 80% have satellite lesions 2. Histoplasmoma - in endemic areas (Mississippi and the Atlantic coast of USA). More frequent in the lower lobes. Well-defined. Seldom larger than 3 cm. Calcification is common and may be central, producing a target appearance. Satellite lesions are common. 3. Others - e. g. coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis. Malignant tumours 1. Lung cancer - usually > 2 cm. Accounts for less than 15% of all solitary nodules at 40 years; almost 100% at 80 years. Radiological appearances suggesting malignancy include: recent appearance or rapid growth (review previous CXRs); size greater than 4 cm; the lesion crosses a fissure; ill-defined margins; umbilicated or notched margin (if present it indicates malignancy in 80%); corona radiata (spiculation), peripheral line shadows. Calcification is rare (but seen in up to 10% at CT). 2. Solitary metastasis - accounts for 3-5% of asymptomatic nodules. 25% of pulmonary metastases may be solitary. Most likely primary tumours are breast, sarcoma, seminoma and renal cell carcinoma. 3. Rare malignant lung tumours - pulmonary blastoma, pulmonary sarcoma, plasmacytoma, atypical carcinoid. Benign tumours1. Carcinoid tumour - 'typical' carcinoids account for majority (90%) of cases and tend to be more benign than atypical (accounting for 10%) tumours. However, the spectrum of biological behaviour is wide ranging, from benign to frank small cell carcinoma. Typical carcinoids are generally central whereas atypical tumours tend to be peripheral. 2. Hamaoma - 96% occur over 40 years. 90% are intrapulmonary and usually within 2 cm of the pleura. 10% cause bronchial stenosis. Usually < 4 cm diameter. Well-defined. Lobulated rather than smooth. Calcification in 30%, although incidence rises with the size of the lesion (in 75% when > 5 cm). Calcification may have a 'pop-corn' configuration, craggy or punctate. Infectious/inflammatory1. Pneumonia - especially pneumococcal. 2. Hydatid - in endemic areas. Most common in the lower lobes and more frequent on the right side. Well-defined. 1-10 cm. Solitary in 70%. May have a bizarre shape. Rupture results in the 'water lily' sign. 3. Rounded atelectasis - typically a sequela of an exudative (inflammatory) pleural effusion. Mass associated with adjacent smooth pleural thickening and parenchymal bands giving rise to 'comet tail' appearance. 4. Wegener's granulomatosis - solitary nodules in up to one-third of patients but more commonly multiple 5. Sarcoidosis* - a solitary lung nodule (simulating malignancy) is rare but recognized. 6. Organizing pneumonia - can masquerade as a (malignant) solitary pulmonary nodule Congenital1. Sequestration - may be intralobar (more common; acquired abnormality probably secondary to chronic lung suppuration; no separate pleural covering; venous drainage into pulmonary veins) or extralobar (rare; congenital lesion with separate pleural covering; venous drainage into systemic circulation). Majority in the left lower lobe; next most common site is the right lower lobe, contiguous with the diaphragm. Well-defined, round or oval. Diagnosis confirmed by identification of the mass and its blood supply. 2. Bronchogenic cyst - majority are mediastinal or hilar but occasional bronchogenic cysts are intrapulmonary (even more rarely: diaphragmatic, pleural or pericardial). Most intrapulmonary/ bronchogenic cysts are central (perihilar) and may have a systemic aerial supply. Round or oval. Smooth-walled and well-defined. 3. Intrapulmonary lymph node - usually solitary, small (< 2 cm), well-defined and discovered incidentally at CT in mid/lower zones. Vast majority within 2 cm of visceral pleura. Accounting for around 20% of all incidentally-detected solitary nodules. Vascular1. Haematoma - peripheral, smooth and well-defined. 2-6 cm. Slow resolution over several weeks. 2. Aeriovenous malformation - 66% are single. Well-defined, lobulated lesion. Feeding or draining vessels may be demonstrable. Calcification rare. Pulmonary angiography previously the gold standard for diagnosis but now supplanted by multidetector CT(Ref: Chapman and Nakielny's Aids to Radiological Differential Diagnosis 6th.
