Diagnostic mammography verses screening mammography# Diagnostic mammography should not be confused with screening mammography, which is performed after a palpable abnormality has been detected. Diagnostic mammography is aimed at evaluating the rest of the breast before biopsy is performed or occasionally is part of the triple-test strategy to exclude immediate biopsy.# Subtle abnormalities (like clustered microcalcifications, densities, and new or enlarging architectural distortion) that are first detected by screening mammography should be evaluated carefully by compression or magnified views. Mammographic features of breast cancer- \"Irregular\" \"Spiculated\" margins (of the mass) is most common feature- Architectural distortion- High density lesion 0- clusters of pleomorphic \"Microcalcifications\" is pathognomonic sign (may be seen in 30% cases of invasive carcinoma and 95% of cases of DCIS ).- Others:# \"sunburst\" appearance.# True radiolucent halo is almost always benign.# Fat-containing lesions are never malignant. 0# Granular calcification (amorphous, dot-like/elongated, fragmented, grouped very close to each other) and casting calcification (fragmented cast of calcification within ducts) favour malignancy.# Ultrasound features of breast cancer- Spiculations- Taller than wide- Angular margins- Acoustic shadowing- Branch pattern- Markedly hypoechoic- Calcifications- Duct extension- Microlobulation. Educational Points about Mammography# Screening tool of choice for Ca breast. 0# Cannot substitute biopsy.# Every female after the age of 40 yrs should undergo annual mammography screening.# If during screening a lesion with \"low index\" of suspicion for Ca is encountered, follow-up every 6 months should be done.# If while screening a lesion with \"high index\" of suspicion for Ca is found, stereotactic core biopsy should be done.# Radiation (X-ray) energy used is less than even a chest radiograph.# 'Target material\" or anode in mammography X-ray tubes should be made up of molybdenum or rhodium (not tungsten as it produces higher energy x-rays than that of Mb).# K-edege X-ray filters are used.# \"Mean/average glandular dose per mammography should be < 0. 2 m. Gy or 0. 02 c. Gy (optimum dose per mammo should be 0. 1 m. Gy or 0. 01 c. Gy).# In young females mammography is not a good screening tool because young breast are more dense, i. e., glandular tissue is more than fatty tissue in young females.# MRI is screening tool of choice for Ca breast in young females, especially in those with positive family history or for who are BRCA1 &/or 2 gene carriers.# Triple assessment consists:- Clinical examination (palpation)- Mammography# The BIRADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Dictation System) lexicon was developed by the American College of Radiology to provide a clear and concise way to report mammographic result.# MRI is more sensitive than mammography for DCIS.

Principles# The radiation treatment plan generally consists of a combination of:- External teletherapy to treat the regional nodes and to shrink the primary tumor and- Intracavitary brachytherapy to boost the central tumor.# For intracavitary insertions, point A, point B, Bladder and rectal points need to be defined with stipulated radiation dose at respective points.# Intracavitary therapy alone may be used in patients with early disease when the incidence of lymph node metastasis is negligible.# Point A:- A point 2 cm above the external os of the cervix and 2 cm lateral to the cervical canal. 0- Corresponds to obturator nodes. 0# Point B:- A point 3 cm lateral to point A or 5 cm from the cervical canal. 0- Corresponds to iliac crossing. 0# The usual doses delivered are:- 5, 000 c. Gy/rads to point AQ and (Shaw Textbook mentions < 8000 rads)- 2, 000 c. Gy/rads to point B0, (Shaw textbook mentions < 4. 500 rads)- Limiting the bladder and rectal dosage to < 6, 000 c. Gy0.# For interstitial implants, prescribed dose, dose rate, agent to be used should be known. Concurrent chemoradiation is very effective in Rx of Ca cervix stage Ilb/IIIa onwards. 0. Complications following radiation include radiation inflammation of the bladder or bowel, which may lead to pain, bleeding, or, infrequently, fistula formation. The normal cervix is resistant to radiation, and the dose can be as high as 200 to 250 Gy over 2 months. The bladder and rectum can be injured at average dosages in the range of 65 to 70 Gy. Overall moderate to severe radiation complications for treatment of all stages approximate 10%. Radiation complications of the intestine are more frequent than bladder complications.

As the early gestational sac enlarges, it becomes visible by ultrasonography. The gestational sac, however, remains within markedly thickened ipsilateral decidua. The uterine cavity remains relatively undistorted (i. e., straight) and can be delineated by ultrasonography. The gestational sac, therefore, can be seen adjacent to a straight uterine cavity within a thickened decidua. This is called an intradecidual sign.* A little later, around just after 5 weeks, the double decidual sac sign is seen. This is seen as a hyperechoic ring (the deciduas capsularis), partially surrounded by another hyperechoic ring (the decidual parietalis). These two layers of the decidua are separated by an anechoic space- the fluid within the uterine cavity. Where both layers of the decidua capsularis and parietalis merge is the decidua basalis. The decidua basalis represents the site of future placenta formation.* If a double decidual sac sign is present, then it is highly suggestive that the intrauterine fluid collection is an intrauterine pregnancy. Also know* A double bleb sign is a sonographic feature where there is visualisation of a gestational sac containing a yolk sac and amniotic sac giving an appearance of two small bubbles. The embryonic disc is located between the two bubbles. It is an important feature of an intrauterine pregnancy and thus distinguishes a pregnancy form a pseudogestational sac or decidual cast cyst.
