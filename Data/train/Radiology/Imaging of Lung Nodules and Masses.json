Bat's wings appearance - Pulmonary oedema. Pruned tree appearance (of pulmonary circulation) - Pulmonary artery hypertension. Lungs. Ground glass appearance - Hyaline membrane disease. Solitary pulmonary mass lesion > 4 cms - is most commonly due to - Bronchial adenoma. Honey Comb appearance. SarcoidosisQ. Histiocytosis X. Interstitial king diseaseQ. TuberculosisQ. Collagen disordersQ. PneumoconiosisQ. Drugs - bleomycin, busulphan, melphalan. cyclophosphamide. Meniscus sign i Crescent sign (mobile mass in pulmonary cavity) is most commonly seen in - Aspergilloma (fungal ball lesion). Egg-Shell calcification - SilicosisQ, SarcoidosisQ, Coal miner's pneumoconiosisQ, Lymphoma following radiotherupyQ. Pop-corn calcification / Craggy pop-corn calcification - Pulmonary Hamartoma. Pleural calcification - most common cause is - Tuberculosis (Asbestosis). Diaphragmatic pleura calcification - is due to - Asbestosis. Calcification in a pulmonary metastasis - is most commomly due to - Osteosarcoma. Coin shadow in the lung (single), w ith calcification in the centre - Epidermoid carcinoma. For radiologically evident pleural effusion - the minimal amount of pleural fluid that should be present is - 250 ml. Plethoric lung fields - seen in - L-R shunts (VSD. PDA. ASD). Oligemic lung fields - Pulmonary atreisa. Stenosis; Ebstein's anomaly. Perihilar fluffy opacities - seen in - Pulmonary venous hypertension. Ribs. Superior surface notch of ribs - seen in - Hyper- parathyroidsm. Neurofibromatosis, Connective tissue disorders. Inferior surface notch of ribs - seen in - Coarctation of Aorta, SVC obstruction, Chest wall AV fistula. Aortic Thrombosis. Unilateral notching of ribs - Coarctation of Left subclavian artery. Subclavian artery block, Blalock-Taussig Operation. Others. Displacement of tracheal shadow - most common cause is - Thyroid swelling. Water Lily sign - Ruptured hydatid cyst.",
