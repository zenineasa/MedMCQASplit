But Ferromagnetic objects under magnetic field can be vulnerable to 4 adverse effects: Movement (causing structural injury), Current conduction (potentially causing electrical shock), Heating (possibly causing bum injury), and Artifact generation Serious injuries can be caused by attraction of ferromagnetic objects into the magnet, which would act as missiles if brought too close to the magnet. Ferromagnetic implants, such as aneurysm clips, may torque (turn or twist) due to the magnetic field, causing damage to vessels and even death. Metallic foreign bodies in the eye have moved and caused intraocular hemorrhage. Pacemakers and pacemaker leads are a contraindication, as the pacemaker can malfunction and cause arrhythmia or even death. However with growing expansion of MR, increasing number of implant medical devices are being MR safe. So newer pacemaker and aneurysm clips are being made which are MR safe. Absolute Contraindications for the MRI scan: Electronically, magnetically, and mechanically activated implants Ferromagnetic or electronically operated active devices like automatic cardioverter defibrillators Cardiac pacemakers- but there are pacemakers available from Medtronic which are safe in MRI environment but not so widely used.

MR1 CONTRAST AGENTSMRI contrast agents are a group of contrast media used to improve the visibility of internal body structures in magnetic resonance imaging (MR!). The most commonly used compounds for contrast enhancement are gadolinium- based. Most clinically used MR! contrast agents work through shortening the T1 relaxation time ofprotons located nearby. MRI contrast agents may be administered by injection into the blood stream or orally, depending on the subject of interest. Oral administration is well suited to G. I. tract scans, while intravascular administration proves more useful for most other scans. A variety of agents of both types enhance scans routinely. MRI contrast agents can be classified in many ways including by their: 1. chemical composition2. administration route3. magnetic properties4. effect on the image5. presence and nature of metal atoms6. biodistribution and applications: I Extracellular fluid agents (also known as intravenous contrast agents)II Blood pool agents (also known as in travascular con trast agents)III Organ specific agents (i. e. Gastrointestinal contrast agents and hepatobiliary contrast agents)IV Active targeting/cell iabeling agents (i. e. tumor-specific agents)V Responsive (also known as smart or bioactivated) agents. VI pH-sensitive agents. Types of contrasts in MRI1. Gadolinium2. Iron oxide: Superparamagnetic: Two types of iron oxide contrast agents exist: superparamagnetic iron oxide (SP10) and ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (U3. PIO) e. g includes Feridex I. V. Resovist, Sinerem, Lumirem & Clariscan3. Iron Platinum: Superparamagnetic: Superparamagnetic iron platinum particles (SIPPs) have been reported and had significantly better T2 relaxivities compared with the more common iron oxide nanoparticles. SIPP swere also encapsulated with phospholipids to create multifunctional SIPP stealth immunomicelles that specifically targeted uman prostate cancer cells. 4. Manganese: Paramagnetic: Unlike the other well-studied iron oxide-based nanoparticles, research on Mn-based nanoparticles is at a relatively early stage. Manganese ions (Mn2+) are often used as a contrast agent in animal studies, usually referred to as MEMRI (Manganese Enhanced MRI). 5. Oral administration of contrast agents: A wide variety of oral contrast agents can enhance images of the gastrointestinal tract. Perflubron, a type of perfluorocarbon, has been used as a gastrointestinal MR! contrast agent for pediatric imaging. 6. Protein-based MRI contrast agents: Newer research suggests the possibility of protein based contrast agents, based on the abilities of some amino acids to bind with gadolinium. Heme-containing proteins may act as \"natural\" contrast agents, just like previously discussed iron(IH) porphyrins. Gadolinium\"Some patients undergoingan MRI scan may require an injection of an intravenous (IV) dye (contrast) known as Gadolinium, which is a paramagnetic substance that is visible on MRI scans. The contrast is delivered into your body through a small plastic tube known as an intravenous cannula, which is placed into a vein in your arm by a nurse or radiographer who are both experienced in performing this procedure. This will result in a minor discomfort, usually no more than taking blood from your arm. The IV contrast is NOT radioactive\"\"Gadolinium chelates have been approved for parenteral use since the late 1980s. Although these agents can be differentiated on the basis of stability, viscosity, and osmolality, they cannot be differentiated on the basis of efficacy. Gadolinium chelates are extremely well tolerated by the vast majority of patients in whom they are injected. Acute adverse reactions are encountered with a lower frequency than is observed after administration of iodinated contrast media\"\"Gadolinium-containing contrast agents approved for human use. Some are-gadoterate (Dotarem)gadodiamide (Omniscan), gadobenate (Multi. Hance), gadopentetate (Magnevist, Magnegita, Gado-MRT ratiopharmfgadoteridol (Pro. Hancefgadoversetamide (Opti. MARK), gadoxetate (Primovist) & gadobutrol (Gadovist). Radiocontrast agents used in Radiology# Radiocon trust agents are a type of medical contrast medium used to improve the visibility of internal bodily structures in X-ray based imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and radiography (commonly known as X-ray imaging). Radiocontrast agents are typically iodine or barium compounds.# Magnetic resonance imaging (MR!) functions through different principles and thus utilizes different contrast agents. These compounds work by altering the magnetic properties of nearby hydrogen nuclei.# Iodine-based contrast media are usually classified as ionic or non-ionic Both types are used most commonly in radiology due to their relatively harmless interaction with the body and its solubility. Contrast media are primarily used to visualize vessels and changes in tissues on radiography and CT. There are many different molecules. Some examples of organic iodine molecules are iohexol, iodixanol and ioversol. Barium sulfate is mainly used in the imaging of the digestive system. The substance exists as a water insoluble white powder that is made into a slurry with water and administered directly into the gastrointestinal tract.# Barium sulfate, an insoluble white powder is typically used for enhancing contrast in the GI tract# An older type of contrast agent, Thorotrast was based on thorium dioxide, but this was abandoned since it turned out to be carcinogenic.",

CT imaging is the gold standard in detecting calcification.* Calcifications of the pineal gland, choroid plexus, basal ganglia anal dura mater are commonly seen with aging and are usually not associated with pathological clinical phenomena. However calcium deposits can be associated with several intracranial pathologies including tumors, cerebrovascular diseases, congenital conditions, trauma and endocrine/metabolic disorders.",

HRCT utilizes thin collimation (i. e., thin slices of 1 or 2 mm.) as compared to thick slices of conventional CT scan (of 5 to 7 mm.). The field of view is reduced to increase the resolution of the image. HRCT utilizes High spatial frequency algorithms, such as bone algorithms, rather than traditional soft-tissue algorithms (as used in conventional CT scan) for image reconstruction. It smoothens the image data and gives more sharp images and finer lung details.",
