Key Concept The thyroid gland is more susceptible to radiation exposure during dental radiographic exams given its anatomic position, particularly in children. Protective thyroid collars and collimation substantially reduce radiation exposure to the thyroid during dental radiographic procedures.

        "question": "A 20 yr female come with a mass in the cavernous sinus & 6th cranial nerve palsy. In T2W MRI Hyperintense shadow is present which shows homogenous contrast enhancement. Diagnosis is:",
        "exp": "B i. e. Meningioma Tumors or lesions (like infection, thrombosis, aneurysm, fistula) of cavernous sinus can cause neuropathy/involvment of 3rd, 4th 6th and 5th (V1 >>112.) cranial nerves because of their anatomical proximity to the lateral wall of cavernous sinus. So for pin pointing the diagnosis we have to focus on other features like sex, age, incidence and MR findings. Now lets focus on differential diagnosis of cavernous sinus masses which indicates that Schwannoma & meningioma are common; cavernous sinus hemangioma is very rare and astrocytoma is almost not a cause cavernous sinus masses. Unilateral Mass Common Uncommon - SchwannomaQ - Chordoma - MeningiomaQ - Lymphoma - Metastasis Very Rare - Aneurysm (cavernous- - Lipoma internal carotid aery) - Carotid cavernous - Epidermoid fistula - Cavernous hemangiome - Osteo cailagenous tumors - Plexiform neurofibroma (NF1) Bilateral Mass Common Uncommon - Invasive pituitary adenoma - Meningioma - Metastases - Lymphoma - Cavernous sinus thrombosis Lets focus on astrocytoma to see wheter it can be completely ruled out or not - Astrocytomas either do not/mildly enhance (low grade astrocytoma) or strongly enhance (anaplastic/malignant astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiformae, PA, PXA, SEGA) but when they enhance they characteristically enhance inhomogenously (heterogenously) mostlyQ (except in PXA >PA). Now we are left with cavernous hemangioma, meningioma and schwannoma Cavernous sinus hemangioma is a rare benign tumor seen in young or middle aged (4th & 5th decade) predominantly females (F: M = 9: 1 to 3: 1). It presents as homogenous hypointense on T1 and highly hyperintense on T2 weighted images. Contrast enhancement is homogenousQ, which distinguish them from other lesions. So it seems a probable answer but lets rule out other options. Trigeminal Schwannoma (neuroma) is a common cause of cavernous sinus mass. It presents predominantly in females (F: M=2: 1) of 35 to 60 years ageQ. But it is characterized by high chances (3040%) of heterogeniety of both density and contrast enhancementQ (b/o tumor necrosis & cyst formation in larger > 1 mm tumors). So schwannoma can be easilyruled out. Meningiomas are common cause of cavernous sinus mass. It presents predominantly in females (F: M=4: 1 to 2: 1) of 35 to 70 years and even in younger patients in Wzv NF2Q. Meningiomas are characteristically homogenous hyperdense mass (with broad dural base) on CT and characteristically show homogenous (uniform) intense contrast enhancementQ. So this is the answer because it is far more common than CSH. Dont get confused that ----book mention, meningioma may be heterogenous without understanding the logic behind it. Brodly speaking any tumor may give any appearance but we are concerned about its typical / characteristic/ most common pattern of appearance. This and most of PGME question about CNS tumors are very broad concept based. Now let me rephrase this question to make it more clear: What would be your first diagnosis of cavernous sinus mass which appears hyper intense on T2 WI and shows homogenous contrast enhancement in a 20 yr old female.",

Lesions more commonly are unilateral, except for very rare extensive lesions of the maxillofacial region that are bilateral. Periphery: The periphery of fibrous dysplasia lesions most commonly is ill-defined, with a gradual blending of normal trabecular bone into an abnormal trabecular pattern. Occasionally, the boundary between normal bone and the lesion can appear sharp and even corticated, especially in young lesions. Internal Structure: The density and trabecular pattern of fibrous dysplasia lesions vary considerably. The variation is more pronounced in the mandible and more homogeneous in the maxilla. The internal aspect of bone may be more radiolucent, more radiopaque, or a mixture of these two variations compared with normal bone. The internal density is more radiopaque in the maxilla and the base of the skull. Early lesions may be more radiolucent than mature lesions. Key Concept",

Nuchal translucency thickness >3mm is associated with an increased risk of chromosomal anomaly.

In 95% cases of downs syndrome, there are three copies of chromosome 21, which occur due to non dysjunction of chromosomes. Remaining cases are either mosaics or those which occur due to trans-location of chromosomes.

Bitewing receptors are particularly valuable for detecting interproximal caries in the early stages of development, before it becomes clinically apparent. Because of the horizontal angle of the X-ray beam, these radiographs also may reveal secondary caries below restorations that may escape recognition in the periapical views. Bitewing projections are also useful for evaluating the periodontal condition. They provide a good perspective of the alveolar bone crest, and changes in bone height can be assessed accurately through comparison with the adjacent teeth. In addition, because of the angle of projection directly through the interproximal spaces, the bitewing receptor is especially effective and useful for detecting calculus deposits in interproximal areas.

The degradation of the electrical and optical performance of diodes increases with increasing fluence. The induced lattice defects in the In/sub 0. 53/Ga/sub 0. 47/As epitaxial layers and the InP substrate are studied by DLTS methods. In the In/sub 0. 53/Ga/sub-0. 47/As epitaxial layers, hole and electron capture levels are induced by irradiation. The influence of radiation source on device degradation is then discussed by comparison to 1-MeV electrons with respect to the numbers of knock-on atoms and the nonionizing energy loss (NIEL). In order to examine the recovery behavior, isochronal thermal annealing is carried out for temperatures ranging from 75 to 300/spl deg/C. After 300/spl deg/C thermal annealing, the light current only recovers to 20% of pre-irradiation for a fluence of 1/spl times/10/sup 13/ n/cm/sup 2/, while it recovers to 53% for a fluence of 1/spl times/10/sup 15/ e/cm/sup 2/.

Pulmonary (Aerial) Hypertension (PAH) It is defined as an elevation in mean pulmonary aerial pressure above 30mm. Hg during execise and above 25mm. Hg at rest in systole. An increase in PAH most commonly occurs as a result of intrinsic lung disease, which results in an increae in pulmonary vascular resistance and subsequent increase in PA pressure. PAP can also increase as a result of an increase in pulmonary venous pressure (which may be d/t impaired left ventricle function or obstruction to left sided cardiac flow eg MS etc). So radiological features may be slightly different depending on cause i. e. pulmonary aerial or pulmonary venous hypertension. Radiological features of PAH include. Vascular Signs - Enlargement of central pulmonary aeries (main pulmonary aery & its branches down to the segmental level)Q and tapering of peripheral aerial branches (vessels beyond segmental level)-termed pripheral pruningQ are seen - Enlargement of central main pulmonary aery may be extremely large with complete infilling of pulmonary aery/ventricular concavity of left hea border on X-ray. - Widest diameter of main pulmonary aery (MPA) 29mm measured on transverse section (CT) at level of PA bifurcation has 90% sensitivity & specificity - Diameter ratio of MPA to ascending aoa (measured at same level) >1 i. e. diameter of MPA>AA has strong correlation in - Transverse diameter of right descending pulmonary aery at midpoint >17mm (Grainger); diamete of left and right pulmonary aery >16mm (Wolfgang); maximum diameter of descending branch of pulmonary aery (measured lcm medial & 1 cm lateral to hilar points) >16mm for males & >15mm for females (Sutton) - Pulmonary aeries with in lungs are enlarged but there is rapid tapering of vessels (beyond segmental level) as they run towards the periphery.

        "exp": "A i. e. Mammography This answer is also an example of POC. You are free to believe that MRI is correct answer. But the latest (2012) book by authors of AIIMS-MAMC & PGI for Breast Imaging says this - Currently, nearly 90% of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are diagnosed while they are clinically occult because of mamographic detection of microcalcification (in 76%), soft tissue densities (11%) or both (13% cases). For diagnosis of DCIS, mammography is far superior (to MRI) because of its ability to pick up microcalcificationQ. MRI cannot detect this characterirstic findingQ. Only 40-50% of DCIS display an enhancement pattern typical of malignancy. These can be diagnosed on MRI alone. Remaining 50-60% can not be diagnosed on MR alone or not at all on MR. This question is based on some basic concepts of DCIS & breast imaging which are Earliest finding of DCIS is microcalcification. Mammography is most sensitive and MRI is least sensitive in detecting microcalcificationQ. (Another Q about the inability of MRI to detect calcification has already been asked many time and you have answered it but never tried to apply, that concept here.) Mammography is most sensitive for detecting early DCIS and therefore is the screeining modality of choice( 2. And MRI can't detect 50-60% early DC1S. However, because of discontinuous spread of DCIS through the ductal system, mammography may underestimate the extent of lesion. MRI is superior to mammography in determination of disease extent, size, infiltration, microinvasion and staging of DCIS (this all is done for invasive and relatively late DCIS). Screening with MRI is superior to mammography in detecting invasive breast cancer in younger women where the sensitivity of mammography is low due to presence of mammographically dense breast parenchymaQ. Although mammography remains more sensitive for detecting Ductal carcinoma in sits in. CISP. But if you still want to believe that some latest British American research is behind this question. Then my advice is, stop reding books & go for journals as you would get many of them to contradict most of the lines written in your reference tent books.

        "question": "A patient presents with acute renal failure (ARF) and complete anuria. The USG is normal. Which of the following investigation will give best information regarding renal function.",
        "exp": "D i. e. DTPA scan Antegrade pyelography (AP) & retrograde pyelography (RP) are invasive techniques. Percutaneous AP done by puncturing the collecting system & injecting contrast is rarely performed for diagnostic imaging purpose as ultrasound or CT may be used to visualize the ureter even in presence of abnormal renal function. However the indications of AP may be percutaneous nephrostomy (Whitaker test), to obtain renal urine for cyto/bactero-logical examination, to pinpoint obstruction level in dialated urinary system not adequately opacified by IVU/or after failed RP. Retrograde ureteropyelography (RP) is valuable when (IVU/IVP) is suboptimal owing to poor renal function & in cases where IV contrast administration is contraindicated. Intravenous urography/pyelography (IVU/IVP) is intravenous administration of iodinated contrast and taking renal x-rays. It is initial technique in evaluation of possible urinary obstruction. For taking additional radiographs rule of 8 (i. e. if no contrast appears in collecting system by 15 min after injection, there is a little reason to obtain next film until 2 hours (=15x8) later) prevent multiple exposure. There has been a significant decline in use of IVU as dominant imaging technique in obstruction d/ t fear of contrast induced nephrotoxicity and d/ t growth of renal sonography & low dose CT. The main draw back of IVU is that it is time consuming. Conventional gray scale sonography is good screening method for detecting subacute and chronic obstruction as demonstrated by pyelocaliectasis however, in acute obstruction pyelocaliectasis is minimal or absent. Another drawback is its inability to realibly distinguish mild hydronephrosis from normal or prominent extrarenal pelvis. Duplex & color Doppler ultrasound have yielded advances in: - distinguishing mild pyelectasis from prominent central renal blood vessels. - detecting high grade acute ureteric obstruction through analysis of ureteral jets (normal ureteral jets i. e. ejection of urine from ureter into urinary bladder are bilaterally symmetrical). - estabilishing renal resistive index (RI) as an independent hemodynamic measure of urinary obstruction. CT scan has emerged as an effective imaging tool in evaluation of acute renal obstruction esp in screening patients with acute flank pain / azotemia who are strongly suspected as having obstruction and in establishing the etiology of ureteral obstruction when other investigations have failed. Non contrast low dose CT is very quick & useful in determining the presence or absence of obstruction and have higher sensitivity for detection of ureteric stones as compared to IVU. The radionale for CT urography is that high risk patients or patients with hematuria can be fully investigated by a single imaging technique with a high degree of sensitivity & specificity. The major disadvantage is the radiation dose of CTU which is upto 5 times higher than IVU. Radionuclide renography has limited role in evaluation of acute obstruction as it lacks precise anatomical delineation of obstruction as well as ability to define the cause of obstruction. Its major use is in differentiation of a dilated non obstructed system from a paially obstructed system. When IVU demonstrates a dilated collecting system and there is doubt about the presence or absence of obstruction diuresis (frusemide) renography with Tc99 DTPA or MAG-3 will usually help to distinguish obstructive from non-obstructive dilatation & will localize the site of obstruction. The collecting system activity washes out with in 10minutes in non obstructive after diuresis challenge but no or paial response is seen in obstructive cases. Measurement of differential renal function can be made during diuresis renography or as a separate procedure using Tc99 DMSA examinationQ. MR urography is an ideal technique in pregnancy, where there is contrast allergy, renal failure patients & if radiation dose is an issue. The level of obstruction is always identified however ureteric abnormalities (if < 4mm) are poorly defined & that includes stones.",

Ultrasound and KUB X-ray are the initial screening modalityQ followed by unenhanced (i. e. non contrast) helical or spinal CT (imaging modality of choice) if screening is negative. However, IVU (intravenous urography) or IVP is still the best investigation if CT is not available. The test of choice at most centers for diagnosing an acute stone is a non contrast helical CT ScanQ. Helical CT (Non contrast) has the advantage of detecting uric acid stones in addition to the traditional radioopaques stones, and CT does not expose the patient to the risk of radio contrast agents. - Calcification is best detected by CTscanQ. MRI and PET scan have no role in diagnosing renal stone. Intravenous urography (IVP) is the only method which can detect early renal tuberculosis and papillary necrosis. It is the most sensitive and investigation modality of choice for early renal TB. However in advanced cases it should be integrated with cross sectional CT imagesQ. Micturating/Voiding cystourethrography is the best method to visualize posterior urethra, posterior urethral valve & vesico ureteric refluxQ. In post urethral valve, Voiding Cystourethrogram (VCU) shows dialation of prostatic urethra & filling defect corresponding to the valve. VU Reflux occurs when urinary bladder contracts so contrast studies of urinary bladder done during micturation is best way to see VU Reflux. Radionucleotide cystogram is Inv of 2nd choice. It's advantage is that it avoids the need for bladder catheterization. The disadvantage is its lack of anatomical detail. So it may be useful in follow up (not initial assessment).",

CECT Imaging for pleural effusion Chest X-ray Chest X-rays have long been the initial radiologic investigation for the assessment of pulmonary pathology including the presence of pleural space infections. The chest X-ray will usually show a small to moderate effusion with or without parenchymal infiltrates. Prior to the greater use of thoracic ultrasound and CT, lateral decubitus X-rays were used in the assessment of pleural collection, USG There is a significant trend worldwide to employ pleural ultrasound at the bedside to assess for the presence of pleural effusions, especially in the context of pleural infection. Pleural ultrasound is fast, safe and effective in confirming the presence of pleural fluid, and in localising the optimal site for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention in real time). CT scan Pleural effusions are commonly detected on review of CTs organised for assessment of pneumonia. In terms of diagnosis and planning of intervention, contrast enhanced thoracic CT is the imaging investigation of choice, with correct timing of contrast injection allowing better definition of the pleural abnormalities Thoracic CT allows not only assessment of the pleura itself, but chest tube position, presence and degree of loculations, parenchymal changes, endobronchial lesions and differentiation of lung abscess from empyema MRI MRI is not routinely used for the assessment of the pleural space, though it has been shown to allow assessment of complex loculated effusions, and demonstrate chest wall involvement",

        "exp": "Just before staing REF: Medical Radiology & Radiation Oncology by L. W. Brady, Philadelphia H.-P. Heilmann, Hamburg M. Molls, Munich page 223, 229, \"The oxygenation just before radiotherapy is given to render tumor cells more radiosensitive, and hypoxia is created during the radiotherapy to protect normal tissue from radiotherapy\" For complete understanding read following text: The use of oxygen in radiotherapy is based on the knowledge of the way in which the radio-sensitivity of cells varies with the oxygen tension in their immediate environment at the time of irradiation and on the belief that some tumours contain foci of anoxic cells (Gray et al., 1953; Thomlinson and Gray, 1955; Gray, 1957). Gray and his associates made the following observation in 1953: \"The radiation effect on living cells in anoxia rapidly increases with oxygenation until it reaches a near maximum effect at the P02 found in normal capillaries and tissue fluids-40 mm. Hg. Fuher increase in oxygenation does not appreciably increase the radiation effect. Therefore, unlike most cancerocidal drugs used to potentiate radiation effect, oxygen does not increase the response in normal tissues. It thus constitutes the ideal adjuvant. \" There are four \"R\"s of radiotherapy (Withers 1992; Thames et al. 1989) and include repair of sublethal cell damage, repopulation of tumour cells, redistribution of cells over different cell cycle phases with different radio-sensitivity and reoxygenation of radio-resistant hypoxic tumours after beginning of the radiotherapy course. Repair and repopulation have been identifi ed as the most impoant factors with respect to radiation response and were therefore subject of early models. A special situation arises for hypoxic tumours, in which the radio-sensitivity of cells is significantly reduced. This effect may in principal be described by introducing the oxygen enhancement ratio defined by: OER = D hypox/D Where D and Dhypox are biologically iso-effective doses for well-oxygenated and hypoxic tumours. Typical values of the OER vary between 1 (well oxygenated) and 3 (strongly hypoxic).",

Hypoechoic or hyporeflective lesions with no distal shadowing or enhancement is produced by highly cellular and hypovascular lesions. Hypoechoic metastases are seen in lymphoma, sarcoma and most adenocarcinoma such as breast, lung and pancreas (Sutton). Echopenic liver metastasis include lymphoma, pancreas, cervical cancer, lung (adenocarcinoma) and nasopharyngeal cancer (Wolfgang). - Hyper-reflective or hyper-choic (or echogenic) lesions with distal shadowing or enhancement is produced by vascular metastases due to many blood-tissue interfaces from the toous abnormal vessels. They are often seen in metastases from colorectal cancer and other gastrointestinal primaries and with vascular metastases from islet cell tumors, carcinoid, choriocarcinoma and renal cell carcinomaQ. Calcification which may be recognized by marked reflectivity and acoustic shadowing (i. e. hyperechogenecity), is most often seen in metastases from mucinous adenocarcinoma of colon (Sutton) /mucin secreting metastases from GI tract (Grainger)/mucinous metastases from colon & ovary (Berry). Echogenic liver metastases include colonic carcinoma (mucinous-adenocarcinoma)Q-54%, hepatoma (25%) and treated breast carcinoma (21%)-Wolfgang. - Presence of ill defined hypoechoic halo (indicating an aggressive tumor) around the hyperchoic lesion produces a bull's eye or target appearance. It is seen in metastases from bronchogenic carcinoma & gastrinomaQ (Sutton/Berry) Metastases of increased reflectivity can mimic hemangiomas and predominantly cystic metastases (eg ovary) can mimic simple cyst. (Grainger). Cystic metastases usually develop in patients who have a primary lesion with a cystic component for example ovarian cancer or cystadenocarcinoma of pancreas (Sutton). Cystic metatases are seen with adenocarcinoma of pancreas, ovary and colon (Berry). - Hypervascular liver metastases include primary neuroendocrine tumor (eg pancreatic islet cell tumor, neuroendocrine carcinoma = carcinoid, pheochromocytoma), renal cell carcinoma (hypernephroma), thyroid cancer, choriocarcinoma, melanoma, and also sarcomas, breast cancer, ovarian cystadenocarcinoma (Wolfgang). Cystadenomas (both serous and mucinous) are benign cystic tumors (eg of ovary). On USG serous cystadenoma presents with large (>10cm), thin walled, usually unilocular, anechoic (smooth black; darker than hypoechoic) masses which may be bilateral. Sonographically mucinous cystadenomas are larger (15-30cm), multilocular (thin septal), usually unilateral, showing variegated echogenicity sign in cystic mass (anechoic empty space, hypoechoic/low level echos d/ t mucoid material in the dependent poion of mass and difference in chemical composition of fluid, protein content & hemorrhage l/t different echogenocity). On MRI (T2. WI) stained glass appearance is seen. Sumary: Cystadenoma is never hyperechoic, although it may be anechoic, hypoechoic or show variegated echogenicity. (Anechoic means more hypoechoic, hypoechoic lesions are seen as black and hyper echoic lesions are seen as white on USG). Colorectal carcinoma (mucinous adenocarcinoma) gives rise to hypervascular metastasis and produce hyperechoic (echogenic) lesion on USGQ. It is impoant to understand that cystic lesions are an-echoic mostly but all hypoechoic lesions are not cystic.

        "exp": "A Stafne bone cyst (Stafne defect, static bone defect) is not a true cyst. It represents a developmental defect in which the submandibular gland causes a depression on the lingual aspect of the mandible. This depression either contains a portion of submandibular salivary gland tissue or \ufb01brous tissue and muscle. These lesions classically present as an asymptomatic radiolucency near the angle of the mandible and below the level of the mandibular canal. Literature states that 80% to 90% of Stafne lesions occur in male patients and, once recognized, require no treatment. Dentigerous cysts, by de\ufb01nition, are associated with the crown of an impacted tooth. There is no tooth associated with this radiolucency. Although certain malignant lesions do metastasize to the jawbones, their radiographic appearance tends to be ill-de\ufb01ned, indicating a destructive process. This lesion is well de\ufb01ned with a sclerotic border around it. In this particular case, a metastatic lesion should be considered low on the differential. Calcifying odontogenic cyst is an uncommon lesion. They can occur in both the maxilla and mandible and approximately 65% of them are found in the incisor and canine region. Lesions can be unilocular and well de\ufb01ned, and often exhibit calci\ufb01cations within the lesion. Although this lesion could, theoretically, represent a calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC), there are other lesions that this is more likely to be. Periapical or radicular cysts are associated with the apex of a nonvital tooth. Besides the fact that these teeth were stated to be vital, this lesion does not appear to be associated with the apex of a tooth in any way.

        "exp": "Explanation: \"Fluorine-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most common positron-labeled radiotracer in positron emission tomography f. PET), in most tissues, including cancer, there is little phosphatase activity. The intracellular metabolite, FDG-6-phosphate cannot undergo further conversions and is therefore trapped inside the cell. FDG is useful in staging and metastasis of Renal cell cancer by PET. \" (Ref: Wolfgang) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) \u25cf It is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that produces a three-dimensional image or picture of functional processes in the body. The system detects pairs of gamma rays emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting radionuclide (tracer), which is introduced into the body on a biologically active molecule. Three-dimensional images of tracer concentration within the body are then constructed by computer analysis. In modern scanners, three-dimensional imaging is often accomplished with the aid of a CT X-ray scan performed on the patient during the same session, in the same machine. If the biologically active molecule chosen for PET is FDG, an analogue of glucose, the concentrations of tracer imaged then give tissue metabolic activity, in terms of regional glucose uptake. The electron-positron decays result in two 511 keV gamma photons being emitted at almost 180 degrees to each other; hence, it is possible to localize their source along a straight line of coincidence (also called the line of response, or LOR). A collimator is a device that narrows a beam of particles or waves. Lead collimators are used in X-rays and linear accelerators.",

Meningioma is a malignancy arising from the meningeal layers. It typically present as an incidental, extra axial mass lesions or may present with specific signs and symptoms often in middle age females. It arise over the cerebral convexity, sphenoid wings, cavernous sinus, tuberculum and foramen magnum. Typical imaiging features of meningioma are: Calcification: 30% of meningiomas are fully calcified on CT. Calcification occur in forms such as psammomatous/sand like, focal, diffuse or rim type. Hyperostosis: Extra axial mass with skull hyperostosis is highly suggestive of meningioma. Dura tail sign: 60% of meningiomas manifest dura tail sign. A broad dural attachment of a tumor with an adjacent dural tail is highly suggestive of meningioma. Radial sunburst pattern: Globose, extra axial mass with radiating linear hypointense signal from the center to periphery in a sunburst pattern on angiography and persistent angiographic blush indicate highly vascular nature of meningioma.

It can be invasive technique as it needs the implantation of needle into the tumor (interstitial) or in the cavity (intracavitary). It is often used in brain tumors & cervical cancers. It requires trained perssonels. Maximum radiation effect can be obtained in diseased tissue. Minimum risk of radiation exposure to the normal tissue. Interstitial brachy therapy uses variety of rodionucleide implants (not only Ir) inseed into the tumors like sauamous cell carcinoma of head and neck region, skin, breast tumor, soft tissue sarcomas and many others. These implants are allowed to remain their for a definite period (temporary implants) or indefinitely (permanent implants). It decreases damage to normal tissue. Radium-226 is a radioactive decay product of uranium- 238 series and is the precursor of radon - 222. It decays very slowly by emitting a-paicles. Earlier it was used for brachytherapy etc but now its use is obsolete due to its very long half life (1600 years)Q and associated hazards. Now radium (Ra-226) and radon (Rn-222) have been completely abondened for clinical useQ. 1125 (not 1131)is used for brachytherapy. Cesium-131 (t1/2 10 days) is used as permanent implant for brachytherapy not Cs-137 (half life 30 years)Q. Because of the hazard of breaking the needle within tissue substance, the utility of 60. Co as interstitial implant remained questionableQ. Presently use of Co-60 in brachytherapy is restricted to ophthalmic applicators or for ceain after loading systems where small sources are loaded into spherical form. High dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy uses a dose of 20c Gy/minute. Isotopes used for HDR remote after loaders are Ir 192 (now most commonly used), Yb 169 and Co60Q (used in early version of HDR). Co-60Q & Cesium 137Q are used in Brachv & Teletherapy both. Carbon is used in carbon dating. Tc is used for bone scanning.",

The third type appears as a dark pigmentation of the entire crown. The incisal edges may be markedly worn. Combinations of all these lesions develop in some patients. The location, rapid course, and widespread attack distinguish radiation caries. There is also evidence that radiation caries is more likely to lead to periapical inflammatory lesions, if the periapical bone received a high dose of radiation.

Halperin, 5/e p378; Sterotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy are techinques to administer precisely directed, high-dose irradiation that tightly conforms to an intracranial target to create a desired radiobiologic response while minimizing radiation dose to surrounding normal tissue. (Stereotactic refers to using a precise three-dimensional mapping technique to guide a procedure). Stereotactic radiosurgery is an impoant alternative to invasive surgery, especially for tumors and blood vessel abnormalities located deep within or close to vital areas of the brain. Stereotactic radiosurgery works in the same way as other forms of radiation treatment. It does not actually remove the tumor; rather, it damages the DNA of tumor cells. As a result, these cells lose their ability to reproduce. When treated with radiosurgery, aeriovenous malformations (AVMs) begin to thicken and close off slowly, typically over several years. In the case of radiosurgery, all of the irradiation is done in a single session or fraction, while in stereotactic radiotherapy, more than one fraction of irradiation is administered. There are three basic kinds of stereotactic radiosurgery equipment, each of which uses different instruments and sources of radiation: The Gamma Knife(r) uses beams of highly focused gamma rays all aiming at the target region. Linear accelerator (LINAC) machines, prevalent throughout the world, deliver high-energy x-rays, also known as photons. (brand names such as Novalis Tx. TM, XKnife. TM, and Cyber. Knife(r).) Proton beam or heavy-charged-paicle radiosurgery- Proton beam offers ceain theoretical advantages over other modalities of stereotactic radiosurgery because it makes use of the quantum wave properites of protons to reduces doses to surrounding tissue beyond the target to a theoretical minimum of zero. In practice, the proton facility offers advantages for the treatment of unusually shaped brain tumors and aeriovenous malformations",

Planar imaging and SPECT uses gamma cameras. Function of gamma camera is to detect gamma radiation from the radionuclides introduced into the patient's body and to pinpoint the point of origin of radiation in the body. Gamma radiation is detected using scintillating crystal such as sodium iodide and photomultiplier tubes. To determine the direction of origin of radiation, lead collimeters are used. These collimeters ensure that only radiation coming from a narrow angular range will get through each gap in the lead, thus determining the direction to the source of the radiation.

Patients receiving radiation therapy to oral structures have an increase in Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus, and Candida. Caries results from changes in the salivary glands and saliva, including reduced flow, decreased pH, reduced buffering capacity, increased viscosity, and altered flora. The residual saliva in individuals with xerostomia also has a low concentration of Ca2+ ion; this results in greater solubility of tooth structure and reduced remineralization. Because of the reduced or absent cleansing action of normal saliva, debris accumulates quickly. There is also growing evidence that radiation has direct effects on teeth that make them more prone to breakdown with flaking of enamel, particularly in areas of occlusal loading or stress, such as at the incisal, cuspal, and cervical regions of teeth. The destruction is seen with doses greater than 30 Gy and is pronounced when the teeth receive more than 60 Gy.

A: USG For cystic echinococcosis, imaging is the main method that is relied on for diagnosis while serology tests (such as indirect hemogglutination, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), immunoblots or latex agglutination) that use antigens specific for E. granulosus are used to verify the imaging results. The imaging technique of choice for cystic echinococcosis is ultrasonography since it is not only able to visualize the cysts in the body's organs but it is also inexpensive, non-invasive and gives instant results. In addition to ultrasonography, both MRI and CT scans can and are often used although an MRI is often preferred to CT scans when diagnosing cystic echinococcosis since it gives better visualization of liquid areas within the tissue. As with cystic echinococcosis, ultrasonography is the imaging technique of choice for alveolar echinococcosis and is usually complemented by CT scans since CT scans are able to detect the largest number of lesions and calcifications that are characteristic of alveolar echinococcosis. MRIs are also used in combination with ultrasonography though CT scans are preferred. Like cystic echinococcosis, imaging is the major method used for the diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis while the same types of serologic tests (except now specific for E. multilocularis antigens) are used to verify the imaging results. It is also impoant to note that serologic tests are more valuable for the diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis than for cystic echinococcosis since they tend to be more reliable for alveolar echinococcosis since more antigens specific for E. multilocularis are available.",

It is superior to erect abdomen film for this purpose because in the later the divergent X ray beams penetrate the gas at the top of diaphragm obliquely and this area is also relatively dark due to overexposure. In the erect chest film, however, the top of diaphragm and gas beneath it are penetrated almost tangentially by the X ray beams and the exposure of the diaphragm is optimum to show small amounts of gas. A left lateral decubitus abdominal radiograph is one taken with the patient lying on the left side but with the X-ray beam horizontal.
