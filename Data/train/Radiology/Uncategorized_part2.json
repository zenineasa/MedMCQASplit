If this contact occurs early, at least before calcification begins, the two teeth may be completely united to form a single large tooth. If the contact of teeth occurs later, when a portion of the tooth crown has completed its formation, there may be union of the roots only. The dentin; however, is always confluent in cases of true fusion. The tooth may have separate or fused root canals, and the condition is common in the deciduous as well as in permanent dentition.

However, IVU (intravenous urography) or IVP is still the best investigation if CT is not available. The test of choice at most centers for diagnosing an acute stone is a non contrast helical CT ScanQ. Helical CT (Non contrast) has the advantage of detecting uric acid stones in addition to the traditional radioopaques stones, and CT does not expose the patient to the risk of radio contrast agents. - Calcification is best detected by CTscanQ. MRI and PET scan have no role in diagnosing renal stone. Intravenous urography (IVP) is the only method which can detect early renal tuberculosis and papillary necrosis. It is the most sensitive and investigation modality of choice for early renal TB. However in advanced cases it should be integrated with cross sectional CT imagesQ. Micturating/Voiding cystourethrography is the best method to visualize posterior urethra, posterior urethral valve & vesico ureteric refluxQ. In post urethral valve, Voiding Cystourethrogram (VCU) shows dialation of prostatic urethra & filling defect corresponding to the valve.

CECT Imaging for pleural effusion Chest X-ray Chest X-rays have long been the initial radiologic investigation for the assessment of pulmonary pathology including the presence of pleural space infections. The chest X-ray will usually show a small to moderate effusion with or without parenchymal infiltrates. Prior to the greater use of thoracic ultrasound and CT, lateral decubitus X-rays were used in the assessment of pleural collection, USG There is a significant trend worldwide to employ pleural ultrasound at the bedside to assess for the presence of pleural effusions, especially in the context of pleural infection. Pleural ultrasound is fast, safe and effective in confirming the presence of pleural fluid, and in localising the optimal site for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention in real time). CT scan Pleural effusions are commonly detected on review of CTs organised for assessment of pneumonia. In terms of diagnosis and planning of intervention, contrast enhanced thoracic CT is the imaging investigation of choice, with correct timing of contrast injection allowing better definition of the pleural abnormalities Thoracic CT allows not only assessment of the pleura itself, but chest tube position, presence and degree of loculations, parenchymal changes, endobronchial lesions and differentiation of lung abscess from empyema MRI MRI is not routinely used for the assessment of the pleural space, though it has been shown to allow assessment of complex loculated effusions, and demonstrate chest wall involvement",

        "exp": "Just before staing REF: Medical Radiology & Radiation Oncology by L. W. Brady, Philadelphia H.-P. Heilmann, Hamburg M. Molls, Munich page 223, 229, \"The oxygenation just before radiotherapy is given to render tumor cells more radiosensitive, and hypoxia is created during the radiotherapy to protect normal tissue from radiotherapy\" For complete understanding read following text: The use of oxygen in radiotherapy is based on the knowledge of the way in which the radio-sensitivity of cells varies with the oxygen tension in their immediate environment at the time of irradiation and on the belief that some tumours contain foci of anoxic cells (Gray et al., 1953; Thomlinson and Gray, 1955; Gray, 1957). Gray and his associates made the following observation in 1953: \"The radiation effect on living cells in anoxia rapidly increases with oxygenation until it reaches a near maximum effect at the P02 found in normal capillaries and tissue fluids-40 mm. Hg. Fuher increase in oxygenation does not appreciably increase the radiation effect. Therefore, unlike most cancerocidal drugs used to potentiate radiation effect, oxygen does not increase the response in normal tissues. It thus constitutes the ideal adjuvant. \" There are four \"R\"s of radiotherapy (Withers 1992; Thames et al. 1989) and include repair of sublethal cell damage, repopulation of tumour cells, redistribution of cells over different cell cycle phases with different radio-sensitivity and reoxygenation of radio-resistant hypoxic tumours after beginning of the radiotherapy course. Repair and repopulation have been identifi ed as the most impoant factors with respect to radiation response and were therefore subject of early models. A special situation arises for hypoxic tumours, in which the radio-sensitivity of cells is significantly reduced. This effect may in principal be described by introducing the oxygen enhancement ratio defined by: OER = D hypox/D Where D and Dhypox are biologically iso-effective doses for well-oxygenated and hypoxic tumours. Typical values of the OER vary between 1 (well oxygenated) and 3 (strongly hypoxic).",

Hypoechoic or hyporeflective lesions with no distal shadowing or enhancement is produced by highly cellular and hypovascular lesions. Hypoechoic metastases are seen in lymphoma, sarcoma and most adenocarcinoma such as breast, lung and pancreas (Sutton). Echopenic liver metastasis include lymphoma, pancreas, cervical cancer, lung (adenocarcinoma) and nasopharyngeal cancer (Wolfgang). - Hyper-reflective or hyper-choic (or echogenic) lesions with distal shadowing or enhancement is produced by vascular metastases due to many blood-tissue interfaces from the toous abnormal vessels. They are often seen in metastases from colorectal cancer and other gastrointestinal primaries and with vascular metastases from islet cell tumors, carcinoid, choriocarcinoma and renal cell carcinomaQ. Calcification which may be recognized by marked reflectivity and acoustic shadowing (i. e. hyperechogenecity), is most often seen in metastases from mucinous adenocarcinoma of colon (Sutton) /mucin secreting metastases from GI tract (Grainger)/mucinous metastases from colon & ovary (Berry). Echogenic liver metastases include colonic carcinoma (mucinous-adenocarcinoma)Q-54%, hepatoma (25%) and treated breast carcinoma (21%)-Wolfgang. - Presence of ill defined hypoechoic halo (indicating an aggressive tumor) around the hyperchoic lesion produces a bull's eye or target appearance. It is seen in metastases from bronchogenic carcinoma & gastrinomaQ (Sutton/Berry) Metastases of increased reflectivity can mimic hemangiomas and predominantly cystic metastases (eg ovary) can mimic simple cyst. (Grainger). Cystic metastases usually develop in patients who have a primary lesion with a cystic component for example ovarian cancer or cystadenocarcinoma of pancreas (Sutton). Cystic metatases are seen with adenocarcinoma of pancreas, ovary and colon (Berry). - Hypervascular liver metastases include primary neuroendocrine tumor (eg pancreatic islet cell tumor, neuroendocrine carcinoma = carcinoid, pheochromocytoma), renal cell carcinoma (hypernephroma), thyroid cancer, choriocarcinoma, melanoma, and also sarcomas, breast cancer, ovarian cystadenocarcinoma (Wolfgang). Cystadenomas (both serous and mucinous) are benign cystic tumors (eg of ovary). On USG serous cystadenoma presents with large (>10cm), thin walled, usually unilocular, anechoic (smooth black; darker than hypoechoic) masses which may be bilateral. Sonographically mucinous cystadenomas are larger (15-30cm), multilocular (thin septal), usually unilateral, showing variegated echogenicity sign in cystic mass (anechoic empty space, hypoechoic/low level echos d/ t mucoid material in the dependent poion of mass and difference in chemical composition of fluid, protein content & hemorrhage l/t different echogenocity). On MRI (T2. WI) stained glass appearance is seen. Sumary: Cystadenoma is never hyperechoic, although it may be anechoic, hypoechoic or show variegated echogenicity. (Anechoic means more hypoechoic, hypoechoic lesions are seen as black and hyper echoic lesions are seen as white on USG). Colorectal carcinoma (mucinous adenocarcinoma) gives rise to hypervascular metastasis and produce hyperechoic (echogenic) lesion on USGQ. It is impoant to understand that cystic lesions are an-echoic mostly but all hypoechoic lesions are not cystic.

PET), in most tissues, including cancer, there is little phosphatase activity. The intracellular metabolite, FDG-6-phosphate cannot undergo further conversions and is therefore trapped inside the cell. FDG is useful in staging and metastasis of Renal cell cancer by PET. \" (Ref: Wolfgang) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) \u25cf It is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that produces a three-dimensional image or picture of functional processes in the body. The system detects pairs of gamma rays emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting radionuclide (tracer), which is introduced into the body on a biologically active molecule. Three-dimensional images of tracer concentration within the body are then constructed by computer analysis. In modern scanners, three-dimensional imaging is often accomplished with the aid of a CT X-ray scan performed on the patient during the same session, in the same machine. If the biologically active molecule chosen for PET is FDG, an analogue of glucose, the concentrations of tracer imaged then give tissue metabolic activity, in terms of regional glucose uptake. The electron-positron decays result in two 511 keV gamma photons being emitted at almost 180 degrees to each other; hence, it is possible to localize their source along a straight line of coincidence (also called the line of response, or LOR). A collimator is a device that narrows a beam of particles or waves. Lead collimators are used in X-rays and linear accelerators.",

Meningioma is a malignancy arising from the meningeal layers. It typically present as an incidental, extra axial mass lesions or may present with specific signs and symptoms often in middle age females. It arise over the cerebral convexity, sphenoid wings, cavernous sinus, tuberculum and foramen magnum. Typical imaiging features of meningioma are: Calcification: 30% of meningiomas are fully calcified on CT. Calcification occur in forms such as psammomatous/sand like, focal, diffuse or rim type. Hyperostosis: Extra axial mass with skull hyperostosis is highly suggestive of meningioma. Dura tail sign: 60% of meningiomas manifest dura tail sign. A broad dural attachment of a tumor with an adjacent dural tail is highly suggestive of meningioma. Radial sunburst pattern: Globose, extra axial mass with radiating linear hypointense signal from the center to periphery in a sunburst pattern on angiography and persistent angiographic blush indicate highly vascular nature of meningioma.

The third type appears as a dark pigmentation of the entire crown. The incisal edges may be markedly worn. Combinations of all these lesions develop in some patients. The location, rapid course, and widespread attack distinguish radiation caries.

Planar imaging and SPECT uses gamma cameras. Function of gamma camera is to detect gamma radiation from the radionuclides introduced into the patient's body and to pinpoint the point of origin of radiation in the body. Gamma radiation is detected using scintillating crystal such as sodium iodide and photomultiplier tubes. To determine the direction of origin of radiation, lead collimeters are used. These collimeters ensure that only radiation coming from a narrow angular range will get through each gap in the lead, thus determining the direction to the source of the radiation.

A: USG For cystic echinococcosis, imaging is the main method that is relied on for diagnosis while serology tests (such as indirect hemogglutination, ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), immunoblots or latex agglutination) that use antigens specific for E. granulosus are used to verify the imaging results. The imaging technique of choice for cystic echinococcosis is ultrasonography since it is not only able to visualize the cysts in the body's organs but it is also inexpensive, non-invasive and gives instant results. In addition to ultrasonography, both MRI and CT scans can and are often used although an MRI is often preferred to CT scans when diagnosing cystic echinococcosis since it gives better visualization of liquid areas within the tissue. As with cystic echinococcosis, ultrasonography is the imaging technique of choice for alveolar echinococcosis and is usually complemented by CT scans since CT scans are able to detect the largest number of lesions and calcifications that are characteristic of alveolar echinococcosis. MRIs are also used in combination with ultrasonography though CT scans are preferred. Like cystic echinococcosis, imaging is the major method used for the diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis while the same types of serologic tests (except now specific for E. multilocularis antigens) are used to verify the imaging results. It is also impoant to note that serologic tests are more valuable for the diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis than for cystic echinococcosis since they tend to be more reliable for alveolar echinococcosis since more antigens specific for E. multilocularis are available.",

It is superior to erect abdomen film for this purpose because in the later the divergent X ray beams penetrate the gas at the top of diaphragm obliquely and this area is also relatively dark due to overexposure. In the erect chest film, however, the top of diaphragm and gas beneath it are penetrated almost tangentially by the X ray beams and the exposure of the diaphragm is optimum to show small amounts of gas. A left lateral decubitus abdominal radiograph is one taken with the patient lying on the left side but with the X-ray beam horizontal. In patients who are unfit to sit or stand for an erect film, it is the projection of choice to show a small pneumoperitoneum.

Acceptable lesion must be > 3 mm in diameter. CT findings of MS include focal decreased attenuation in periventricular white matter (most characteristic), contrast enhancing plaques (enhancement may be decreased or abolished by coicosteroid administration) and cerebral atrophy. MRI is imaging modality of choice and most characteristic diagnostic feature of MS plaque is not their high signal intensity (on T2. WI) but their anatomical distribution. There is a predilection for periventricular distribution & ependymal surface (especially along occipital horns >frontal horns). If not pathognomic, corpus callosum lesions are so characteristic of MS to be almost specific. Other MS sites are corona radiata, internal capsule, centrum semiovale; and surface of pons esp near 5th CN entery zone, middle cerebral paduncle (brachium pontis), floor of 4th ventricle and colliculi in posterior cranial fossa.

DXA/DEXA/Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry It is a highly accurate X-ray technique that has become the standard for measuring bone density in most centers. Standard X-rays cannot detect bone loss until 30% of bone has been lost; where as DXA can detect as little as 1% of bone loss. However DXA is a two dimensional scanning technique and cannot estimate the depths or posteroanterior length of the bone. Thus small people tend to have lower then average bone minerals density (BMD). Bone spurs, which are frequent in osteoporosis, tend to falsely increase bone density of the FDA approved indications for BMD tests are: Estrogen deficient women at risk of osteoporosis Gliicocoicoid treatment equivalent to 7. 5 mg of prednisole, or duration of therapy > 3 months Primary hyper parathyroidismQ Veebral abnormalities on X-ray suggestive of osteoporosis (osteopenia, veebral fracture) Monitoring response to an FDA-approved medication for osteoporosis Repeat BMD evaluation at > 23 month intervals, or more frequently if medically justified. Biochemical markers of bone metabolism in clinical use are spine. - Though it can be used for measurement of any skeletal site, clinical determinations are usually made of the lumbar spine and hip. Poable DXA machines have been developed that measures the heel (Calcaneus), forearm (radius & ulna) and finger (phalanges) - In DXA, two scores are used 1) T - score: is more impoant and compares individual results with to those in young population (of same race & gender) t-score Interpretation Upto -1 S.

Intravenous contrast medium may be injected when the primary purpose of examination is to show the mediastinum or hilar structures. High resolution CT (HRCT) uses very thin 1-2 mm thick. (2 High resolution chest CT (HRCT chest) is the procedure of choice for hyper sensitivity pneumonitis (HP) or extrinsic allergic alveolitisQ such as farmer's / mushroom worker's / bird fancier's / chemical worker's / hot tub / coffee worker's etc - lung. HRCT - chest is superior to plain Xray chest for early detection and confirmation of suspected interstial lung disease (ILD)Q such as fibrosing alveolitis, lymphangitic carcinoma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, eosinophilic granuloma, asbestosis, berylliosis and other industrial lung diseases etc. When lung biopsy is required, HRCT is useful for determining most appropriate area from which biopsy sample should be taken. Chest CT is specific and imaging modality of choice for confirming diagnosis of bronchiectasisQ. CT findings include airway dilation (detected as \"parallel tram tracks\" or \"signet ring sign\"), lack of bronchial tapering (showing presence of tubular structure within 1 cm from pleural surface), bronchial wall thickening, inspissated secretions (tree-in-bud pattern), or cysts originating from bronchial wall. Helical CT scanning allows collection of continuous data over a larger volume of lung during a single breath holding maneuver (faster scan with improved contrast enhancement & thinner collimation) that allows less motion aifact. Data from single imaging procedure can be reconstructed as images in planes other than the traditional axial (cross-sectional) view, including coronal, or saggital planes or even 3D representation (viual bronchoscopy) mimicking visualization through a bronchoscope. Multidetector CT (MDCT) uses higher number of detectors (upto 64) along scanning (Z) axis to obtain multiple slices in a single rotation that are thinner and can be acquired in a shoer period of time, resulting in enhanced resolution and increased image reconstruction ability. Shoer breath holds are especially beneficial for children, elderly and critically ill patients, however, at the risk of increased radiation dose. MDCT has led to improved imaging of pulmonary vasculature and the ability to detect segmental & subsegmental emboli. In contrast to pulmonary angiography, CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) by MDCT usually allows simultaneous detection of parenchymal abnormalities; and has rapidly become the test of choice in evaluation of pulmonary embolismQ (b/o equal accuracy and less risk in comparison to pulmonary angiography).",

The disadvantage of this type of dosimeter is that the dental film is subject to fog when exposed to heat or fumes, and this expo-sure could result in a false reading.

MAG3 scan can be used in the first few months of life when renal function is low and DTPA scan is ineffective. Diethylene triamine penta acetic acid (DTPA) scan is used to study the functioning status of the kidneys. In this scan gamma camera can measure the rate of excretion of isotope by each kidney and confirm functional obstruction. DMSA scan can show functional renal tissue in detail and may be useful in confirming the presence of scars in the renal coex that may occur in reflux nephropathy.

The prostate, seminal vesicles and vagina are located below the rectovesical pouch or rectouterine/vesicouterine pouches.

Although peritoneum drapes over the rectum, forming the rectovesical fold in males and the rectovaginal fold in females, the rectum would not be clearly outlined by the intraperitoneal contrast since it is not covered by peritoneum on all sides.

(Ref: Osborn Neuroradiology) Cavernous sinus hemangioma is a very rare tumor of this region. ( All the cavernous sinus tumors can cause sixth nerve palsy (and proptosis). So the diagnosis is to be made on the basis of incidence and MR chaaracterstics. MR characteristics: Menigioma - Usually hypointense to isointense on TI-weighted and isointense to hyperintense with T2-weighted images. - Somebooks write that it is mostly isointense on T2 wt sequences. - Enhances homogenously on post contrast scans. Schwannoma - Mostly hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2. - Smaller tumors show homogenous density and strong homogenous enhancement. Larger tumors demonstrate heterogeneity of both density and contrast enhancement because of the presence of intratumoral cystic degeneration & xanthomatous changes. Cavernous hemangioma - Mostly hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on 72. - Shows good homogenous contrast enhancement. Thus meningioma can be ruled out as it usually isointense on T2. We are left with Schwannoma and Cavernous hemangioma. We would personally like to go with Schwannoma as it is one of the commonest tumors of the cavernous sinus and smaller tumors have homogenous enhancement. Cavernous hemangioma though matches more with the contrast enhancement characteristics, is a very rare tumor of this region.",

Use rare-earth screens for panoramic and cephalometric film imaging or use digital systems. Reduce cone-beam CT beam field of view to region of interest.

The degree of displacement may be considerable. For instance, maxillary third molars or cuspids may be pushed to the floor of the orbit, and mandibular third molars may be moved to the condylar or coronoid regions or to the inferior cortex of the mandible. The floor of the maxillary antrum may be displaced as the cyst invaginates the antrum, or a cyst may displace the inferior alveolar nerve canal in an inferior direction. This slow-growing cyst often expands the outer cortical boundary of the involved jaw. As in the case with radicular cysts, dentigerous cysts that invaginate the sinus can drain and collapse with new bone formation at the periphery. Ref: Oral radiology White and Pharaoh; 7th ed.

The specificity for small nodules is also poor. - Spiral scanning has improved detection rate for pulmonary nodule but has not improved specificity. - The presence of calcification indicates benign lesion but 14% of carcinomas (malignant) show calcification. - The cavitation not necessarily indicates malignant lesion. So summary is, CT scan is most sensitive for detecting large pulmonary nodules ( 3mm) but neither sensitive nor specific for smaller nodules the maximum CT scan can show is calcification & cavitation, which are not always diagnostic of benign & malignant lesions respectively.
