It is divided into two types: Type I (radicular dentinal dysplasia) and Type II (coronal dentinal dysplasia). It occurs less frequently than dentinogenesis imperfecta. Clinical features Type I is the more frequent type. Teeth erupt normally with no obvious abnormality but rapidly develop mobility resulting from limited root support. In type II, the deciduous teeth are similar to those in dentinogenesis imperfecta, whereas the permanent teeth appear normal. Radiological signs In Type I, all the teeth, except the canines, have extremely short roots. The roots are conical or blunted. There is pulpal obliteration and the inferior aspects of the crown exhibit linear crescent-shaped radiolucent lines. Periapical radiolucencies are commonly seen associated with non-carious teeth in Type I dentinal dysplasia. In Type II dentinal dysplasia, obliteration of the pulp occurs post eruption in the deciduous dentition. In the permanent dentition, there is alteration in the configuration of the pulp resulting in enlarged pulp chambers extending well down into the root. The pulp contains multiple calcifications.

Gastric residues are low b/o recurrent emesisQ. The hyperophied muscle project into gastric antrum. There is a constant assocaition with hyperplasia of antral mucosa.- It is a common developmental condition (3 in 1000 live bihs), affecting boys more than girls (M: F = 4/5: 1)Q. There is a familial predisposition. Affected infant usually presents between 2-6 weeks of age, with projectile non bilious vomiting (D/D include pylorospasm, hiatus hernia & preampullary duodenal stenosis). HPS is never seen beyond 3 months of age except in premature infants in whom enteral feeding has been staed late.- Despite the recurrent vomiting, child has a voracious appetite that leads to cycle of feeding & vomiting that invariably results in severe dehydration, hypochloremichypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with eventual decrease in urine PHDiagnosis can be made clinically on the basis of history and palpation of an olive mass in the subhepatic region (right upper quadrant) and presence of visible gastric (antral peristaltic) wavesQ. Diagnosis of the HPS can be established (confirmed) by either USG (method of choice)Q or barium study. Pyloric signs include. String sign, is passing of thin barium streak through narrowed & elongated pyloric canal. It is most specific sign. Pyloric canal is almost always curved upward posteriorly. Double/triple track sign or double string sign is produced by barium caught between crowded mucosal folds in pyloric canal overlying the hyperophied muscle & parallel lines may be seen. Diamond sign or twining recess is transient triangular tent like cleft/niche in midpoion of pyloric canal with apex pointing inferiorly secondary to mucosl bulging between two seperated hyperophied muscles on the greater curvature side of pyloric canal. Apple core lesion, pyloric segment looks like apple core with under cutting of distal antral & proximal duodenal bulb. Antral signs include. Pyloric teat sign is out pouching along lesser curvature b/o disruption of antral peristalsis. Shoulder sign is impression of hyperophied muscle on distended gastric antrum. Antral beaking is noted as thick muscle narrows the barium column as it enters the pyloric canal. Olive pit sign is impression of pyloric muscle upon antrum seen as tiny amount of barium at orifice. Caterpillar sign is gastric hyperperistaltic waves. Kirklin mushroom sign is indentation of base of duodenal bulb. Ultrasonography (USG). It is the method of choice to directly visualize the HPS. The examination is typically performed with a high frequency linear transducer (>5.

The stomach should not be emptied prior to examination as this makes identification of antropyloric area difficult. If fluid is administered to make visualization better, it should be removed at the end of examination to prevent vomiting/aspiration. Features include). Doughnut appearance/Bull's eye or target sign is hypoechoic (black) ring of hyperophied pyloric muscle around echogenic (reflective) mucosa & submucosa on cross /transverse section images. Shoulder/cervix-sign is indentation of hyperophied muscle on fluid filled gastric antrum on longitudinal section. Antral nipple sign is protrusion (evagination) of redundant pyloric mucosa into distended antrum.

CT scan (EBCT & MDCT) uses calcium depositionQ as a surrogate marker for detecting the presence & amout of atherosclerosis. CT attenuation within non calcified fibrous pique (91-116) is greater than within noncalcified lipid-rich plaques (47-71 HU). However, large variability currently prevents accurate classification of non calcified plaques by CT. Agatston Coronary Aery Calcification Scoring Coronary calcium is used as a surrogate marker to detect the presence and quantify the amount of atherosclerosis. Both electron beam (EB) CT and MD-CT permit accurate detection and quantification of coronary aery calcium. With the exception of renal failure patients, calcification occurs almost exclusively in the context of atherosclerosis. Agatston developed a scoring system, which takes into account the area (in pixels) and the CT density of calcified lesion (defining calcification as densities >130 Hounsfield units) for quantifying coronary aery calcification in patients evaluated with EB-CT scans using 3mm slice thickness. Each lesion in each slice is scored based on maximum density with a paicular scale i. e. 1 = 130 to 199 HU; 2 = 200-299 HU; 3 = 300-399. HU; 4 = 400. HU or greater. Then a total score is obtained by summing the scores from all slices, broadly indicating grade of coronary aery disease (& risk of cardiovascular events +-. 0 = No; 1 to 10 = Minimal; 11 to 100 = Mild; 101 to 400 = Moderate; >400 = Severe. Currently, MDCT calcium scoring is widely used to calculate coronary clacium load, using 2. 5 to 3 mm norienhanced axial CT images obtained with a prospective ECG gated acquisition. Modified Agatston score equivalent, takes into account the area of each calcified lesion and the maximum CT value within the lesion. The volumetric and absolute mass quantfication scoring algorithms are also available, showing increased accuracy, consistency and reproducibility (however, not been validated in clinical setting). It is impoant to understand that the amount of coronary calcium correlates moderately to overall atherosclerotic plaque burden. On the other hand, not every atherosclerotic coronary plaque is calcified and calcification is a sign of neither stability nor instability of an specific plaque. The absence of coronary calcium rules out the presence of coronary aery stenoses with high predictive value. However, even pronounced coronary calcification is not necessarily a/whemodynamically relevant luminal narrowing. So even the detection of large amounts of calcium does not indicate the presence of significant stenoses & it should not prompt invasive coronary angiography in otherwise asymptomatic individuals.",

        "exp": "The term pneumoperitoneum refers to the presence of air within the peritoneal cavity. The most common cause is a perforation of the abdominal viscus--most commonly, a perforated ulcer. At least 2 radiographs should be obtained, including a supine abdominal radiograph and either an erect chest image or a left lateral decubitus image. The patient should remain in position for 5-10 minutes before a horizontal-beam radiograph is acquired. A lateral chest x-ray has been found to be even more sensitive for the diagnosis of pneumoperitoneum than an erect chest x-ray. Signs of a large pneumoperitoneum include the following: The football sign, which usually represents a large collection of air within the greater sac. The gas-relief sign, the Rigler sign, and the double-wall sign are all terms applied to the visualization of the outer wall of bowel loops caused by gas outside the bowel loop and normal intraluminal gas. The lateral umbilical ligaments, which contain the inferior epigastric vessels, may become visible as an inveed V sign in the pelvis as a result of a large pneumoperitoneum. A telltale triangle sign represents a triangular pocket of air between 2 loops of bowel and the abdominal wall. Free air under the diaphragm may depict the diaphragmatic muscle slips as arcuate soft tissue bands, arching parallel to the diaphragmatic dome. Air may be present around the spleen.",

As a rule, only sialoliths anterior to the masseter muscle can be imaged on an intraoral image.

Bitewing projections are also useful for evaluating the periodontal condition. They provide a good perspective of the alveolar bone crest, and changes in bone height can be assessed accurately through comparison with the adjacent teeth. In addition, because of the angle of projection directly through the interproximal spaces, the bitewing receptor is especially effective and useful for detecting calculus deposits in interproximal areas.

        "question": "Initial investigation for an amoebic liver abscess is September 2009",
        "exp": "Ans. A: USG Ultrasonography is the preferable initial diagnostic test. It is rapid, inexpensive, and is only slightly less sensitive than CT scan (75-80% sensitivity vs 88-95% for CT scan). Ultrasonography simultaneously evaluates the gallbladder and avoids radiation exposure. As opposed to scanning with technetium-99m, sonography often can distinguish an abscess from a tumor or other solid focal lesion. The lesions tend to be round or oval, with well-defined margins, and hypoechoic. CT scan is sensitive but the findings are not specific. The abscess typically appears low density with smooth margins and a contrast-enhancing peripheral rim. The use of injected contrast may differentiate hepatic abscesses from vascular tumors. MRI is sensitive, but the findings are not specific. This test provides information comparable with less expensive imaging procedures. Technetium-99m liver scanning is useful for differentiating an amebic liver abscess from a pyogenic abscess; however, it is not used as a first-line test. Because amebic liver abscesses do not contain leukocytes, they appear as cold lesions on hepatic nuclear scanning, with a typical hot halo or a rim of radioactivity surrounding the abscess. In contrast, pyogenic liver abscesses contain leukocytes and, therefore, typically appear as hot lesions on nuclear scanning. Gallium scanning is helpful in differentiating pyogenic abscess (similar to technetium-99m nuclear hepatic scanning) but requires delayed images, which makes the test less helpful. Hepatic angiography is only useful to differentiate liver abscesses from vascular lesions. Plain chest or abdominal films may show elevation and limitation of motion of the right diaphragm, basilar atelectasis, and right pleural effusion or gas within the abscess cavity. None of the imaging tests can definitely differentiate a pyogenic liver abscess, an amebic abscess, or malignant disease. Clinical, epidemiological, and serological correlation is needed for diagnosis.",

H+ Major difference between x-rays & light are wave length (A) & energyQ Electromagnetic radiation or photon waves are non paiculate (0-mass), non charged (0-charge) waves, that do not require a medium to travel (i. e. can travel in vaccum) and transfer energy from one location to another at the speed of light (c= 3x108 m/s). The major difference between various forms of photons/electromagnetic radiation lies in their wave length (X) and frequency (n), which accounts for their differences in energy carried. E n/A. So Xrays with shoer wave length in comparison to visible light carries 5000 times higher energies. Because for EM waves energy is propoional to frequency (n) and inversly propoional to wave length N. - EM radiation spectrum consists of photons with wave length, frequency and energy ranges over 10 orders of magnitude (the range is really infinite). From low energy to high energy these are Radar waves, Microwaves, Infra-red, Light (visible photons), Ultraviolet, X rays and Gamma rays. (Mn- \"Reliance MILL Xtra Grand\"). - When a photon beam falls, it can exit (transmitted electrons) or interact with matter (attenuation). With increasing amount of photon energy 5 possible interactions are possible, which are coherent scattering (very low energy electrons; 1. 022 to > 10 MeV), and photodisintegration (very high energy; > 8-10 MeV) - Maximum compton scattering occurs with hydrogenQ b/o highest electron density. In photoelectric effect, the most tightly bound-inner most electron completely absorbs all energy of falling low energy photonQ, so much so that the photon is completely absorbed and no longer exists and inner orbital electron (now called photoelectron) is ejected. The interaction can occur with other orbital electrons but the most probable interaction is with inner most shell electron. The vacency created in inner shell is filled by an electron from outer orbit with simultraneous emission of X-ray or Auger electron. In Compton Scattering incident higher energy photon transfers only a pa of its energy to a loosely bound outer shell electronQ. and is deflected or scattered off in a new direction with lower energy. The outer shell electron (now called compton/recoil electron) is ejected with no production of X-ray or Auger electron. Charged heavy paicles (such as protons and a-paicles) have a finite range and experience a rapid increase in energy loss near the end of their track (range/path), dumping most of their remaining energies quickly and producing an ionization curve with a peak near end (K/ a Bragg peak). - When a light mass-charged paicle (such as electron or 8-paicle) with high energy passes close to the nucleus's positive electrical field, it is deflected & decelerated by electro static attractions and loses energy in form of X-ray photons called bremsstrahlung or braking radiation. So Bragg peak is produced by charged heavy paicles mainly, whereas Bremsstrahlung radiation is produced by charged light paiclesQ. - Collisional energy losses (& heat production) dominate at lower energyies, whereas radiative losses dominate at higher energies (Vt more efficient X-ray production)Q. Because of dependency on atomic number (Z2) and 1/velocity2; collisional energy losses increases as atomic number increases and paicle velocity decreases. So electrons are stopped sooner in low Z than high Z materialsQ.",

Increasing the focal spot-to-image receptor distance and decreasing the object-to-image receptor distance minimizes image magnification. Key Point: The use of a long, open-ended cylinder as an aiming device on an X-ray machine thus reduces the magnification of image on a periapical view.

More modern formulations utilize a mixture of barium oxide, strontium oxide and calcium oxide. Another standard formulation is barium oxide, calcium oxide, and aluminium oxide in a 5: 3: 2 ratio. Thorium oxide is used as well. Oxide-coated cathodes operate at about 800-1000 degC, orange-hot. They are used in most small glass vacuum tubes, but are rarely used in high-power tubes since they are vulnerable to high voltages and oxygen ions, and undergo rapid degradation under such conditions. Hot cathodes may be either directly heated, where the filament itself is the source of electrons, or indirectly heated, where the filament is electrically insulated from the cathode; this configuration minimizes the introduction of hum when the filament is energized with alternating current. The filament is most often made of tungsten. With indirectly heated cathodes, the filament is usually called the heater instead.

        "exp": "50% reduction in KVP reduces 50% radiation dose Quantity of exposure is directly propoional to (k. Vp)2. Thus reducing k. Vp by 1/2 would reduce the radiation dose to 1/4. X rays are produced by energy conversion when a fast-moving stream of electrons is suddently decelerated in the target of an x-ray tube. The target of an x-ray tube is usually tungsten or an alloy of tungsten. The exposure dose to the patient depends on Quantity and Quality of the x ray beam. X ray Quantity, also referred to as radiation exposure, refers to the number of photons in the x ray beam. More photons increase the dose to the patient. X ray Quality refers to the energy or penetrating power of the photons in the beam. Several factors affect the quality and quantity of the x ray beam. k. Vp: The k. Vp affects both the quantity and the quality of the radiation beam. The k. Vp across the X ray tube influences the force of attraction experienced by an electron released by the filament as it moves towards the anode. Thus if the k. Vp is increased, then the kinetic energy (E) of the electron increases. As X ray production by Bremsstrahlung is propoional to E 2, quantity or Intensity will be directly propoional to k. Vp`. If the k. Vp is doubled, then the intensity increases by a factor of four. The quality or the penetrating power of the beam increases as the k. Vp increases. Quality of radiation depends almost entirely on the k. Vp. mA/m. As: mA/m. As affects the quantity of radiation. It has no effect on quality of beam. It has no effect on quality of beam. If the mA is doubled, then the quantity is doubled, and the dose is increased by a factor of two. When the current through the X-ray tube (mA) is doubled the number of electrons flowing across the tube in unit time is doubled. If all other factors remain unchanged. each electron will have the same chance of creating X ray photons and so the number of photons will be doubled. The same applies to m. As. The quantity of the X ray beam is directly propoional to the mA through the tube. Filtration: filtration affects both the quality and quantity of the beam. A filter is always inseed in the x ray beam to remove low energy photons. This removal reduces the quantity, and as a result, the mean energy to the beam increases. The beam becomes more penetrating or harder. Thicker filters reduce the quantity of the beam, but increases beam quality. A filter is intended to protect the patient by removing these low-energy photons. Target material: Target material with higher atomic numbers increase both the quantity of photons slightly and quality (energy) of the beam. Tungsten produces a significantly more efficient spectrum than molybdenum. Source to image receptor distance (SID): The SID affects the quantity of photons but has no effect on the quality. The quantity is affected by the inverse square law, which states that the intensity (quantity) is inversely propoional to the square of the distance. If the distance is increased, then the quantity decreases by 1/d2. Summary: Quantity of X-rays generated is directly propoional to atomic number (z), current (mA), length of time of exposure (s) and square of the voltage applied (k. Vp). Quantity of x-ray = (k. Vp)2 xm. AxsxZ d2 Quality of radiation depends almost entirely on the voltage (k. Vp).

        "exp": "C i. e. Spiral CT Scan (CTA) - The presence of aerial collaterals indicates that renal aery stenosis is hemodynamically significantQ. The diameter of stenotic segment may also give an indication of hemodynamic significance, but is only reliable if the stenosis is either very severe or minimal. Conventional contrast renal aeriography (or digital substraction angiography or intraaerial catheter angiography) is the gold standard for diagnosis of renal aery stenosisQ against which all other modalities are compared. On angiography, the presence of collateral vessels to the ischemic kidneyQ suggest a functionally significant lesion (i. e. a lesion that occludes >70% of lumen of affected renal aery). A lateralizing renal vein renin ratio (>1. 5 of affected side/contralateral side) has a 90% predictive value for a lesion that would respond to vascular repair and result in BP control. After percutaneous aeriography, the next most sensitive and specific screening test for diagnosis of RAS is CT angiographyQ (using spiral and more recently multidetector CT) almost equvalent to DSA. However, it requires use of large amount of iodinated contrast medium (like IVP) precluding its use in renal insufficiency and also exposes to ionizing radiation. - Captopril enahanced radionuclide renal scintigraphy, is most widely performed screening test for diagnosis of renovascular hypertension, (neither most sensitive nor most specific). 99m. Tc. MAG 3 is slightly preferred over 99m. Tc-DTPA; 131. IOIH is not used now. It can be used as screening test to establish hemodynamic significance of RAS, to predict the outcome of revascularizaation and in the follow up after successful revascularization. Disadvantages include low sensitivity in patients with azotemia or underlying renal dysfunction & with bilateral RAS. Branch aery stenosis cannot be diagnosed and provides functional not anatomical data. Summary: The decreasing order of sensitivity & specificity for diagnosis of renal aery stenosis (related renovascular hypertension) is conventional contrast / intraaerial-catheter angiography >CT angiography (using spiral/MDCT) > CE-MRA (dynamic) > SSFP non contrast. enhanced MRA > captopril enhanced radionuclide renal scintigraphy (99m.

CT scan may be indicated in cases with incomplete and increasing paralysis. MRI scan has become the imaging modality of choice for these cases. MRIs of the thoracolumbar spine provide information that is not available using CT scans. Early in an injury, T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) axial and sagittal images may demonstrate the high signal intensity related to acute hemorrhage, including the rare complicating epidural hemorrhage. Both T2-weighted fast SE (FSE) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images demonstrate the high signal intensity associated with edema of bone marrow fat. Gradient-echo T2-weighted images best outline the shape and structure of the veebral body and the posterior spinal elements. These MRI sequences are superior to CT scans for detection of a posttraumatic herniated disk, ligamentous edema, and spinal cord compression. The resolution of MRI used in the detection of spinal fractures is limited. Although gradient-echo and T1-weighted SE images outline fractures well, minimally displaced fractures are difficult to see.",

        "question": "Which of the following is the best view for detecting minimal pneumoperitoneum?",
        "exp": "D i. e. Left lateral decubitus abdominal x-ray with horizontal beam Abdominal CT in lung window setting is the most sensitive investigation for detection of free peritoneal air pneumoperitoneum)Q followed by erect radiograph (i. e. erect x-ray chest PA view)Q f/b left lateral decubitus (with right side up) abdominal x-ray with horizontal beemQ f/b erect abdomen viewQ f/b supine abdomen viewQ. CT Scan Abdomen CTscan-abdomen is the most sensitive investigation for detection of free peritoneal air (i. e. pneumoperitoneum), intra abdominal or pelvic hemorrhage (hemoperitoneuni), spleen injury (commonest injured organ following blunt trauma abdomen), liver injury (2nd most common), adrenal injury (most common retroperitoneal injury) bowel and mesenteric injuries. Whereas, CT is relatively insensitive to acute pancreatic injuries. In order not to miss small (minimal) pneumoperitoneum, abdominal CT images should be viewed in the lung window settings. Bubbles of free air may be detected over the liver, anteriorly in mid abdomen, trapped between the leaves of mesentery or in the peritoneal recesses. Sentineal clot sign (i. e. clotted blood of higher attenuation 45-75. HU) near the site of bleeding with lower attenuation and unclotted blood elsewhere in peritoneal cavity indicate hemoperitoneum. CT scan is the imaging modality of choice for diagnostic evaluation of abdominal trauma. CT is as accurate as DPL in detecting blunt abdominal injury with extra advantages of detailed anatomical evaluation of injuries, quantification of hemorrhage, detection of active aerial extravascation and better detection of retroperitoneal injuries. Wit these advantages diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) has now almost become obsolete (to be used only in few hemodynamically unstable patients). Helical CT is preferred over conventional CT as it is fast, better (less aifacts & respiratory misregistration) and offers optimal IV contrast enhancement. Contrast enhanced CT is imaging modality of choice for spleenic & liver injuriesQ. MDCT provides excellent quality coronal, saggital reconstructions and is diagnostic modality of choice for detection of bowel & mesentric injuriesQ. Administration of IV iodinated contrast is mandatory as it makes detection & location of parenchymal contusions & hematoma more clear and identifies great vessels and provides information regarding integrity of organs or extent of the injury. Plain Radiography Erect chest radiographQ is superior to erect abdominal view for demonstration of pneumoperitoneumQ (i. e. free intra abdominal gas)Q since, in the later view, the divergent x-ray beam penetrates the gas between diaphragm and liver obliquely and this area is usually overexposed for detecting small amount of gases. - Erect chest film is best view for showing small pneumoperitoneum, paicularly on right side with gas under diaphragm because the X-ray beam is passing almost tangentially (horizontally) to the free gas and the exposure of diaphragm is optimal to show small amounts of gas. On the left it can be difficult to distinguish free gas from stomach & colonic gas. Number of conditions can simulate pneumoperitoneum on erect X-ray (k/a pseudo-pneumoperitoneum) such as Chilaiditi's syndrome (i. e. distended bowel b/w liver & diaphragm), subdiaphragmatic fa. Vabscess, diaphragmatic irregularity, curvilinear lung collapse, intramural gas cysts in pneumatosis intestinalis, omental fat, distended viscus, subpulmonary pneumothorax, and apposition of gas distended loops mimicking the double wall sign. CT or lateral decubitus x-ray can differentiate by demonstrating gas b/w liver and abdominal wall. - Pneumoperitoneum can be detected in 76% of cases using an erect film only and in 90% cases if left lateral decubitus projection is also included. So in a suspected case a horizontal ray radiograph either an erect chest or left lateral decubitus (with right side up) abdomen X-ray, is mandatory. The patient should ideally remain in position for 10 min before the horizontal ray film is taken, because it takes this time for gas to rise to the highest point in the abdomen. In patients who are unfit to sit or stand for an erect film left lateral decubitus abdomenal radiograph is the projection of choice (i. e. 2nd best view) to show a small pneumoperitoneum. In this view free gas is seen b/w the edge of liver & lateral abdominal wall or sometimes over pelvis (in females, this may be the highest point). This is the best view to show a gas filled dialated duodenal loop, one of the commonest sign of acute pancreatitis. As little as lml of free gas can be demonstrated radiographically, on either an erect chest or a left lateral decubitus abdominal radiograph. A supine abdomen and an erect chest are regarded as basic standard radiographs in the acute abdomen. In many patients paicularly who are old, unconscious or critically ill, have suffered trauma, perforation (1/t pneumoperitoneum) may be clinically silent or is over shadowed by another serious medical or surgical condition, and the supine abdominal radiograph may be the only view that can be obtained. So it is impoant to be able to recognize the signs of pneumoperitoneum on supine view which are. Signs of right upper quadrant gas (best place to look for small collection) Doge's cap's sign is triangular collection of gas in Morrison's pouch (posterior hepatorenal fossa) Perihepatic (over the liver), subhepatic (postero inferior margin) and parahepatic (lateral to right edge) hyperlucency d/t gas Cupola/Mustache/Saddlebag sign is large amount of gas trapped below central tendon of diaphragm. Free gas may outline falciform ligament (most common), fissure of ligamentum teres (which is posterior free edge of falciform ligament k/a ligamentum teres sign) and ligamentum teres notch (inveed V shaped hyperlucent area along under surface of liver) Signs of large collection of gas - Football or air done sign is large amount of gas in center of abdomen over a fluid collection/or large pneumoperitoneum outlining entire abdominal cavity. - Rigler's double wall sign or bas-relief sign is visualization of both inner and outer walls of a bowel loop d/t air out lining both (luminal & serosal surface) is k/a Rigler's sign and the bowel loops then take on a ghost like appearance. - Tell tale triangular sign is small triangular collection of gas b/w 3 loops of bowel. - Free gas may outline & visualize diaphragmatic muscle slips, both lateral umblical ligaments (inveed V sign), medial umblical ligaments (containing obliterated umblical aeries) and middle umblical ligament (urachus sign). - Scrotal air through open processus vagnalis (in children)",

The protein loss into git may be due to? 1- Exudation through ulcerative lesion eg UC, gi carcinoma & peptic ulcers; 2- Altered permeabitily through nonulcerated mucosa eg menetrier's disease and; 3- Lymphatic dysfunction eg d/t enlarged lymph node or primary lymphatic disease. The diagnosis is suggested by peripheral edema, low serum albumin & globulin leves (both), in absence of kidney & liver disease (selective loss almost excludes the diagnosis). Relative lymphopenia (d/t loss of lymphocytes lymphatics) may also occur. Protein loss in GIT is documented and established by administration of radionuclide labeled proteins and its quantification in stools during a 24-or 48-hr period.

        "exp": "PET > Biopsy \"Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) have ancillary roles in the imaging of brain tumors, primarily in distinguishing tumor recurrence from tissue necrosis that can occur after irradiation. \" -Harrison I7/e p2602 \"MRI or CT scans are often unable to distinguish radiation necrosis from recurrent tumor, but PET or SPECT scans may demonstrate the increased glucose metabolism typical of tumor tissue or the decreased metabolism of necrotic tissue. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy may demonstrate a high lactate concentration with relatively low choline concentration in areas of necrosis. Biopsy is frequently required to establish the correct diagnosis. \" - Harrison 17/e p2610 PET and SPECT belong to family of Radionuclide imaging. Radionuclide imaging tests differ from most other imaging modalities in that diagnostic tests primarily show the physiological function of the system being investigated as opposed to traditional anatomical imaging such as CT or MRI. The images are obtained by mapping the distribution of an administered radiopharmaceutical within the body. These radiopharmaceuticals, once administered to the patient, can localize to specific organs or cellular receptors. These radiopharmaceuticals emit radiations. This propey of radiopharmaceuticals allows nuclear medicine to image the extent of a disease-process in the body, based on the cellular function and physiology, rather than relying on anatomical changes in the tissue anatomy. Thus, as for X-ray radiography and computed tomography, radionuclide imaging uses ionizing radiation. However, the radiation is emitted from within the patient and subsequently detected in the imaging device, rather than transmitted through the patient from an external X-ray source. Compared with CT or MRI, the spatial resolution of radionuclide scans is relatively poor, but the overall diagnostic accuracy may be greatly improved over that of anatomic/morphologic images if a sufficiently specific probe is available. It has the potential ability to diagnose and stage a malignancy, and identify distant metastases with a single scan of the entire body. The specific organ function depicted is determined by the biological behaviour of the radiopharmaceutical. For example, a radiopharmaceutical excreted by the kidney will evaluate renal function whilst one excreted in the bile will depict the biliary tree. The biological behaviour of radiopharmaceuticals can be traced to paicular cellular or molecular mechanisms. Thus, by using different radiopharmaceuticals, a range of cell types can be imaged within the same organ, or different molecular mechanisms with the same cell type Radionuclide imaging devices are highly sensitive and can detect relatively small changes in functional activity. Thus, a change in tissue function is frequently detectable before any change in structure has occurred or can be detected confidently by anatomical imaging. For example, increased glucose metabolism of cancer cells within lymph nodes can be detected using positron emission tomography (PET) before the size of the lymph node exceeds the threshold to be diagnosed as abnormal on computed tomography (CT). Similarly, successful treatment may return functional activity to normal before anatomical abnormalities have resolved and thus radionuclide imaging can be advantageous in monitoring treatment (e. g. for patients with cancer). Diagnostic tests in nuclear medicine exploit the way that the body handles substances differently when there is disease or pathology present. For example, the ligand methylene-diphosphonate (MDP) can be preferentially taken up by bone. By chemically attaching technetium-99m to MDP, radioactivity can be transpoed and attached to bone the hydroxyapatite for imaging. Any increased physiological function, such as due to a fracture in the bone, will usually mean increased concentration of the tracer. This often results in the appearance of a 'hot-spot' which is a focal increase in radio-accumulation, or a general increase in radio-accumulation throughout the physiological system. Some disease processes result in the exclusion of a tracer, resulting in the appearance of a 'cold-spot. Another advantage of radionuclide imaging is that quantification of the amount of radiophamiaceutical within a paicular organ can be achieved through counting the amount of radiation emitted within a specific time. By obtaining repeated images, the change in concentration of radiopharmaceutical over time can be measured and displayed as time--activity curves, giving additional insights into the functional status of tissues With appropriate mathematical modelling, these changes in concentration can be used to quantify paicular physiological processes, such as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or left ventricular ejection fraction.",

Tc-HDP) is injected intravenously and its activity recorded by a gamma camera at two stages - 1. shortly after injection, while it is still in the bloodstream or the perivascular space (the perfusion or blood pool phase) 2. 3 hours later when the isotope has been taken up in bone (the bone phase) 4 types of abnormality are seen - a. Increased activity in the perfusion phase this is due to increased soft tissue blood ow - one of the cardinal features of inflammation (eg. acute or chronic synovitis) b. Decreased activity in the perfusion phase This is much less common and signifies local vascular insufficiency c. Increased activity in the bone phase This is due to either excessive isotope uptake in the osseous extracellular uid or to more avid incorporation into newly forming bone tissue. There are several possible reasons for bone activity - cancer is one of them, but other reasons include arthritis, fractures and bone infections and nothing in the bone scan itself can distinguish between them. d. Diminished activity in the bone phase This is due to absent blood supply eg. in the femoral head after a fracture of the femoral neck or to a replacement of bone by pathological tissue.

Moreover, radium has a very long half-life (1620 yrs.!!). These qualities make it a significant hazard in the case of contamination. Hence, more suitable isotopes have replaced radium in clinical applications. Cesium-137 is widely used for gynecologic brachytherapy implants. It has a lower-energy gamma ray than radium (i. e., it is less penetrating and easier to shield), and it has no gaseous daughter nuclei. Palladium-103, iridium-192, and iodine-125 are used for implantation in the body for brachytherapy treatments..............................................................................

Left Atrial Enlargement LA does not form any pa of cardiac border in normal subjects (on PA view) because it lies in midline & posteriorly. It usually, enlarges postriorly & to the right causing indentation & displacement of oesophagus posteriorly (on barium swallow). Elevation of left main bronchusQ is the earliest evidence (feature) of left atrial enlargmentQ. Subequently there is splaying of carina (i. e. carinal angle widens and become right or obtused angled as compared to normal 51-71 degree). The right border of an enlarged left atrium is visible as double contour (shadow/density) adjacent to the right hea border usually within the main cardiac shadow. Double right hea border is formed d/t bulging of left atrium into right lung & eventually forming right hea border. The borders of left & right atria are differentiated by the fact that left atrial border passes medially towards spine & border of right atrium is limited below by entry of IVC (inf. venacava). With massive enlargment LA can form the most pa of right cardiac border - Left border of LA is rarely visible, although left atrial appendage, when dilated, is seen as a bulge below the main pulmonary aery. - On lateral view postero-superior pa of cardiac shadow becomes prominent. Right Atrium Enlargement - In early stage, only RA appendage fills the space b/w front of heat & back of sternum (prominent anterosuperior pa on lateral view). - It causes an increase in the curvature of right hea border, which becomes more convex, prominent and also protudes to the right away from midline (>3cm beyond right lateral veebral border). It is often accompanied by enlargment of superior venacava and increase in RA height (most reliable sign). In normal individuals, the distance b/w top of aoic arch and the junction of SVC & RA is more than the distance between the later & right cardiophrenic angle. When the reverse happens (i. e. SVC/RA to RCPA distance >AA to SVC/RA distance), the RA is said to be enlarged. Left Ventricle Enlargment On PA view, there is prominent left hea border with rounding. Hyperophy produces rounding of cardiac apex whereas dilatation causes elongation/displacement of cardiac apex to the left or to the left & downwards Lateral view shows prominent postero-inferior pa of cardiac shadow Right Ventricle Enlargement RV enlarges mainly to the left & anteriorly, so there is prominence of left hea border on PA view and prominence of anterior pa of cardiac shadow with encroachment of retrosternal space in upper pa on lateral view. Pulmonary conus (outflow tract) becomes prominent. It may form left cardiac border and can rotate LV to the left with elevation of cardiac apex.

Inadequate breath holding can impair the image quality b/o change in aerial flow rates and motion aefact during breathing. The advent of multidetector CT (MDCT) allows examination of whole lung during single breath -hold. It is noninvasive. Ventilation - perfusion lung scanning is now second line diagnostic testa for PE, and mostly used in patients who cannot tolerate intravenous contrast. Its utility is greatest when accompanied with a normal chest x-ray implying that a ventilation - perfusion mismatch is not due to parenchymal disease.

        "exp": "C i. e. Inferior mesentric aery Direct catheter aeriography (angiography) is percutaneous aerial catheterization based on original work of Seldinger (in Stockholm, 1953). The most useful and commonly used sites for inseion of catheter into the aerial tree are 1) femoral aery (most preferred & most common route) and 2) axillary aery (although most proximal poion of brachial aery is punctured rather than axillary aery, so high brachial is preferred term). The most common vessel punctured for diagnostic and therapeutic angiography is common femoral aery. Retrograde femoral aery puncture is the most common technique used to approch aeries above inguinal ligament (such as coronary, carotid etc). Antegrade femoral aery puncture is used when performing ipsilateral superficial femoral, popliteal or infragenicular aery angioplasty. In practice, femoral & axillary aeries permit investigation of most areas so other sites like popliteal, lower brachial, radial aery, common carotid, etc are used in special circumstances (eg if femoral approach is not possible d/t iliac-occlusive disease). In recent years, there has been a trend toward a greater use of upper extremity access even in those individuals with patent femoral vessels because of lower morbidity caused by small caliber catheters (and DSA technique enables adequate studies to be obtained by injection through small caliber catheters). Digital substraction angiography (DSA), digitally substract (manipuletes computer) the shadow that are present on plain films from the films taken after contrast injection resulting in an image containing detalis of opacified structures only. Selective catheterization of renal aery, coeliac axis etc is done by fluoroscopic manipulation of special shape catheters like straight flush/pigtail/cobra/sidewinder. Superselective (or subselective) catheterization is catheterization of small subsidiary aeries that themselves arise from named branch aeries mostly during embolization procedure. A co-axial catheter (one that passes through the lumen of a diagnostic or guiding catheter) is often used for catheterization of these small vessels. Damage to aerial wall (like subintimal stripping) leading to dissection occurs during puncture, manipulation and injection of saline/large volumes of contrast. The decreasing order of aery damaged during femoral route celiac angiography is external iliac aery > internal iliac aery > inferior mesenteric > gastroduodenal > celiac trunk > superior mesenteric aery.",

The 30/10 protocol is employed in the treatment of established osteoradionecrosis. No surgery should be attempted before the first 30 HBO treatments have provided sufficient angiogenesis to support surgical wounding. After 30 treatments, surgical management can be staged according to the extent of improvement achieved after HBO and the size of sequestrum or area of osteolysis. If the ORN extends to the inferior border of the mandible or if it manifests as an orocutaneous fistula or pathological fracture, discontinuity resection of the necrotic bone and soft tissue will be required to resolve the disease. Unless HBO and surgery are combined in the management of ORN, the results are not long lasting or satisfactory. Even though resection of stage three ORN seems unduly aggressive, it has stood the test of time. By using the Marx protocols in the treatment of ORN, more than 95 percent of patients can be successfully cured of their disease with predictable, functional and aesthetically acceptable outcomes.",

The purpose of the target in an X-ray tube is to convert the kinetic energy of the colliding electrons into X-ray photons. The target is made of tungsten, an element that has several characteristics of an ideal target material, including the following: High atomic number (74) High melting point (3422oC) High thermal conductivity (173 W. m-1. K-1) Low vapor pressure at the working temperature of an X-ray tube. The focal spot is the area on the target to which the focusing cup directs the electrons and from which X-rays are produced. The sharpness of a radiographic image increases as the size of the focal spot decreases. However, the heat generated per unit target area becomes greater as the focal spot decreases in size. To take advantage of a small focal spot while distributing the electrons over a larger area of the target, the target is placed at an angle to the electron beam. The apparent size of the focal spot seen from a position perpendicular to the electron beam (the effective focal spot) is smaller than the actual focal spot size. Typically, the target is inclined about 20 degrees to the central ray of the X-ray beam; this causes the effective focal spot to be approximately 1 mm x 1 mm, as opposed to the actual focal spot, which is about 1 mm x 3 mm. This smaller effective focal spot results in a small apparent source of X-rays and an increase in the sharpness of the image, with a larger actual focal spot size to improve heat dissipation.

I have references for both. \"Mammography is the most sensitive and specific diagnostic tool available\". -The physiological basis of surgery \"For DCIS, most studies have found that MRI is more sensitive than mammography for detecting multicentric disease\". -NIH DCIS \"Magnetic resonance mammography (MRI with breast coils) is the most sensitive technique for detection of breast cancel; approaching 100% for invasive cancer and 80% for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), but it has a high false positive rate (specificity is low)\". To find the answer of this question. I went through various articles, books and sites. Recent studies show MRI is a more sensitive diagnostic tool but is less specific and costlier. Following fact will also clear your doubt: \"The sensitivity of mammography for breast cancer is age dependent. The denser the breast, the less effective the method is for detecting early signs of breast cancer. Breast density tends to be higher in younger women and increased density obscures early signs of breast cancer: The sensitivity of mammography for breast cancer in women over 60 years of age approaches 95%, while mammography can be expected to detect less than 50% of breast cancer in women under 40 years age\". - Breast in women under 40 years. The sensitivity of MRI is not very much affected by age. Therefore, the overall sensitivity of MRI has to be greater than mammography. According to me, the answer to this question is MRI. You are free to choose yours. Also, read the following information: According to Author: Most sensitive investigation for breast cancer in women > 60 years of age -> Mammography. Most sensitive investigation for breast cancer in women < 40 years of age -> MRI. Overall most sensitive investigation for breast cancer -> MRI.",

So in majority of cases the diagnostic procedure is a stereotactic core needle biopsy (SCNB) using mammographic localization. Screening with MRI is superior in younger women as the sensitivity of mammogram is decreased due to the dense breast parenchyma. Mammography has a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 94%. The commonest mammographic abnormality of DCIS is microcalcification other features include asymmetric density and mass. High grade DCIS is associated with linear and branching calcification whereas low grade DCIS is associated with fine and granular calcification. Invasive cancer appear as a speculated mass.

CECT Imaging for pleural effusion Chest X-ray Chest X-rays have long been the initial radiologic investigation for the assessment of pulmonary pathology including the presence of pleural space infections. The chest X-ray will usually show a small to moderate effusion with or without parenchymal infiltrates. Prior to the greater use of thoracic ultrasound and CT, lateral decubitus X-rays were used in the assessment of pleural collection, USG There is a significant trend worldwide to employ pleural ultrasound at the bedside to assess for the presence of pleural effusions, especially in the context of pleural infection. Pleural ultrasound is fast, safe and effective in confirming the presence of pleural fluid, and in localising the optimal site for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention in real time). CT scan Pleural effusions are commonly detected on review of CTs organised for assessment of pneumonia. In terms of diagnosis and planning of intervention, contrast enhanced thoracic CT is the imaging investigation of choice, with correct timing of contrast injection allowing better definition of the pleural abnormalities Thoracic CT allows not only assessment of the pleura itself, but chest tube position, presence and degree of loculations, parenchymal changes, endobronchial lesions and differentiation of lung abscess from empyema MRI MRI is not routinely used for the assessment of the pleural space, though it has been shown to allow assessment of complex loculated effusions, and demonstrate chest wall involvement",

The use of chemotherapy is considered controversial in patients with malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Rhabdomyosarcomas are sensitive to chemotherapy and often are treated with preoperative chemotherapy. Because of the poor prognosis, the treatment plan of synol sarcoma should include aggressive wide resection, along with both radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Osteosarcoma is radioresistant; radiation therapy has no role in the routine management.
