Necrotic areas can have high signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging, and blood products can result in areas of high signal intensity within the lesion on Tl-weighted imaging. ACC can contain foci of intracytoplasmic lipid, which results in a loss of signal intensity on out-of-phase images# \"Up to 70% of pheochromocytomas show relatively high signal intensity on T2-weighted images--a feature classically known as the light bulb sign, which was originally thought to be characteristic of pheochromocytoma.
