Howerver, if the surrounding alevoli are opacified (e. g., in consolidation), air in bronchi become visible as linear branching structure. Because air in bronchi is visualized it is called air bronchogram. Air bronchogram indicates intrapulmonary pathology. It excludes any pleural or mediastinal pathology.
