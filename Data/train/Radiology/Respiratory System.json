Indirect signs are: i) opacity of the affected lobe(s)ii) crowding of the vessels and bronchi within the collapsed area: iii) displacement or bowing of the fissures. i) compensatory hyperinflation of the normal lung or lobes resulting in an increase in transradiancy with separation of the vascular marking; ii) displacement of the mediastinal structures toward the affected side. iii) displacement of the ipsilateral hilum which changes shape. Special signs of Lung Collapse: 1. Rounded atelectasis\"Comet tail\" sign (vascular shadows seen radiating from opacity). Known in Asbestosis. 2. Golden's 'S' sign. Right hilar/central mass with upper lobe collapse seen as convexity at the medial aspect of pulled up major fissure. 3. Broncholobar sign. Lower lobe bronchus is displayed within the opacity of the collapsed left lower lobe. 4. Luftsiche! sign. German words luft = air, sichel = sickle, literally describes an 'air crescent' which may be seen between the aortic arch and the medial border of the collapse. The hyperextended superior segment of the ipsilateral lower lobe accounts for the paramediastinal lucency outlining the medial surface of the collapsed right or left upper lobe.",

However, rapid accumulation of as little as 100-200ml of fluid can cause a hemodynamically significant compression of the heart, which severely impedes diastolic filling, the condition known as pericardial tamponade. c. Even in the face of preserved ejection fraction, diminished ventricular end-diastolic volume leads to reduced stroke volume. d. In addition to other clinical signs of pericardial effusion those of cardiac tamponade include pulsus paradoxus, which is exaggeration of the normal inspiratory drop in systolic blood pressure. Since acute tamponade may occur with small effusions, clinically important pericardial enlargement may be difficult to detect on plain radiographs. e. Subtle changes in cardiac contour may only be detectable by comparison with previous studies.

The physical signs are inconsistent with an infectious process. The CXR shows hilar, paratracheal LN, and parenchymal disease. Sarcoidosis may be associated with uveitis, skin lesions, bony cysts, and hypercalcemia, which is due to abnormal vitamin D metabolism. Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology characterized pathologically by widespread development of noncaseating epithelioid cell granulomas, which may resolve or conve to fibrous tissue. The disease most commonly affects hilar lymph nodes and lungs, but uveitis and involvement of other organs such as the liver, spleen, skin, bone, and salivary glands are not rare. Lab studies may show anemia, leukopoenia, elevated SED rates, blood eosinophilia, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and elevated levels of serum angiotensin-conveing enzymes. Half of the cases are detected incidentally on chest radiograph. Patients with adenopathy alone are usually asymptomatic, althoughpatients with pulmonary involvement may experience weight loss, fatigue, fever, cough, or shoness of breath. Hemoptysis is rare unless it is associated with end-stage sarcoidosis and a superimposed mycetoma. The disease is most common in African Americans, Pueo Ricans, and West Indians. Women are more susceptible than men. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by transbronchial biopsy, which can demonstrate granulomas despite the absence of radiographic evidence of this peribronchial disease. Adenopathy is the most common manifestation. Symmetrical, hilar, and classically right paratracheal involvement is seen. Unilateral hilar adenopathy is seen in less than 5% of cases. Peripheral \"eggshell\" lymph node calcification is occasionally seen. Pleural effusion is rare. Radiographic staging of sarcoid is as follows: Stage 0: normal finding, 10% at presentation, with the primary problem being nonpulmonary Stage 1: adenopathy without pulmonary disease, 50% at presentation Stage 2: adenopathy with pulmonary disease, 30% at presentation Stage 3: pulmonary disease without adenopathy, 10% at presentation Stage 4: pulmonary fibrosis, usually as a sequel to stage 3, rare at presentation Stage 1 disease resolves within a few years in most patients, and less than one-third of patients with stage I disease develop lung disease. Adenopathy is usually present when there is pulmonary disease. The lung involvement results from deposition of noncaseating granulomas along the lymphatic lining of the bronchial vascular bundles and interlobular septa. Findings include small, irregular interstitial and subpleural nodules throughout the lungs. Confluent interstitial infiltrates may be asymmetric, and cavitation is rare. The midzone and upper zone are most commonly involved, whereas the lung periphery and the bases are generally spared. Pulmonary involvement usually resolves but does progress to fibrosis in less than 20% of the cases, with architectural distoion, traction, and pleural thickening. The distribution is often patchy, in contrast to the peripheral lower lobe distribution of IPF. Occasionally, pulmonary sarcoidosis may appear as ground-glass opacities, patchy consolidation, or rounded \"cannonball\" infiltrates described as alveolar sarcoid.",

Extralobar: it is most common variety in neonates and infants, is located between the lower lobe and diaphragm, has its own pleural covering, and other anomalies are common (65%), (like pulmonary hypoplasia, horseshoe lung, CCAM, bronchogenic cysts, diaphragmatic hernia and cardiac anomalies).

Characterized by giant emphysematous bullae, which commonly develop in the upper lobes and occupy at least one-third of a hemithorax. Progressive condition. Associated with several forms of emphysema. Commonly affects young men 1-2. Associated with: Cigarette smoking. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Affected patients may be asymptomatic or experience hypoxia, severe dyspnea and/or chest pain. The bullae commonly involve the upper lobes with an asymmetric distribution and paraseptal location. Plain radiograph. Non-specific features. Bullae occupy more than one-third of the affected hemithorax (vary in size 1-20 cm), Upper lobes have greater involvement, There is bilateral and asymmetric lung involvement. May have compress effect to adjacent structures (lung parenchyma atelectasis, invert the ipsilateral diaphragm or contralateral displacement of the mediastinum and displacement of junction lines). CTBullae predominant in the subpleural location, Size of bullae ranges from 1 to 20 cm in diameter, Usually asymmetric. Presence of concomitant foci of paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema. Treatment and prognosis. The condition tends to be progressive. Criteria for bullectomy include large bullae with significant symptoms (reduced lung function or infection). Complications. Compression of surrounding lung (atelectasis), Pneumothorax, Bullae infection, Higher risk of lung cancer. Other Options: Emphysema: Lungs are large and hyper inflated. Signs of hyperinflation are: o Low set diaphragm. Flat diaphragm best determined by lateral chest, Hyper lucent lung fields, Increased AP diameter, Increased retro-sternal air. Vertical heart. Bulla. Air-filled space in the lung parenchyma due to destruction of alveolar tissue, distal to terminal bronchiole. Larger than 2 cm in distended state. Bullae + emphysema = bullous emphysema (can be congenital or complication of COPD). Giant bulla = bulla larger than one third of the hemithorax size and compression of adjacent lungparenchyma. Distinguish Giant Bulla from Pneumothorax. Important for treatment plan (bulla - no tube thoracostomy; pneumothorax - may need tube thoracostomy if large or symptomatic). Differentiation can be difficult on conventional radiography; they can coexist. Helpful signs for pneumothorax: visible visceral pleural line. Expiratory chest radiograph may help delineating a visceral pleural line of pneumothorax. CT scan is the most accurate mean to differentiate the two diagnoses. \"Double wall\" sign described in cases with ruptured bulla causing pneumothorax (air outlining both sides of the bulla wall parallel to the chest wall).",

Areas of vascular attenuation are noted especially in the upper zones, consistent with central lobar emphysema. A 3. 5 x 3-cm circular cavitary shadow is seen in the right upper zone with elevation of the horizontal fissure and the right hilum. An upper lobe cavitary lesion in a patient with underlying COPD suggests TB or NTM (MOTT). AFB-positive smears may culture out Mycobacterium kansasii or M. avium-intracellulare complex (MAC). Another possibility is nocardia infection. Actinomyces can present as upper lobe cavitary disease but is not acid-fast-positive on smear and is commonly seen with skin infection and fistula formation. The diagnosis of M. avium disease (MAC) is established by fulfilling clinical radiographic and culture criteria. The diagnosis should be suspected with symptoms of cough, fever, and weight loss with progressive infiltrates, cavitation, and multiple nodules. Patients without underlying lung disease who have chronic pulmonary infections are predominantly women and nonsmokers. High-resolution CT scan typically shows multiple small nodules with bronchiectasis. The diagnosis must be established bacteriologically since some nontuberculous mycobacteria are commonly found in nature and contamination of specimen can occur. Therefore, the diagnosis of MOTT pulmonary disease requires the following: three positive cultures with negative AFP smears; two positive cultures and one positive smear; a single bronchial specimen with a positive culture of 2 to 4+ growth; a positive AFB smear and a positive culture of any biopsy specimen; granuloma by biopsy with one positive culture from any respiratory specimen; or a growth of MAC from any usually sterile extrapulmonary site. Although transient infection with spontaneous resolution occurs, significant growth on culture means disease is present. Mycobacterial disease due to nontuberculous mycobacteria is now more common than tuberculosis in the United States. It is generally prevalent in specific areas such as the Southeast and the Gulf Coast region. According to the CDC, one-third to onefouh of all isolates of mycobacteria are due to nontuberculous mycobacteria. Natural waters appear to be the likely environmental source of these organisms, which can be isolated from tap water or even hospital water. Person-to-person transmission is thought to be unlikely. Clinical syndromes of MAI disease in nonimmune non-HIV individuals occur in older patients, paicularly smokers and alcoholics with COPD. These syndromes may present as upper lobe infiltrates or cavitary or solitary nodules. Patients can develop chronic bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis. In nonsmoking women older than 50, multiple small and medium-sized nodules may be seen. Upper lobe or lingular infiltrates have been described.

This x-ray is consistent with a necrotizing process in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe, with an air-fluid level such as in a lung abscess. The presence of a subacute illness with foul-smelling sputum and clubbing is a classical presentation for a lung abscess, which is caused by mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection. Pneumococcal pneumonia generally does not produce a necrotizing picture, and PCP in an immune-compromised patient usually appears as a diffuse reticular pattern, but cystic and cavitary areas may be present. A lung abscess represents a localized area of lung necrosis with a thick wall and an acute angle to the chest wall. An air-fluid level is seen, representing a communication with the bronchial tree. The fluid level diameter is usually similar on PA and lateral chest films with a lung abscess and is often considerably different with empyema. Differentiation between an empyema and a lung abscess is crucial since the former requires tube thoracostomy, while the latter is adequately treated with antibiotics and postural drainage. Immediate bronchoscopy may not be needed unless an endobronchial obstruction is suspected or there is a history of choking or aspiration.

        "exp": "This x-ray shows a cystic opacity in the left lower lobe behind the hea obscuring the left diaphragm but not obscuring the left hea border. These cystic-appearing shadows originate from the left lower lobe bronchus. This picture is consistent either with left lower lobe bronchiectasis or sequestration of the lung. The chest x-ray and clinical history suggest bronchiectasis of the left lower lobe. Bronchograms are not done anymore because of frequent complications and the fact that a CT scan can confirm the diagnosis. Bronchoscopy would not reveal any additional information unless there is a history of foreign body aspiration. Determination of immunoglobulin levels would be helpful in a patient with chronic generalized or multilobar infection or frequent skin infections. The differential diagnosis in this case would include pulmonary sequestration, which could present with a similar radiological picture. A pulmonary sequestration is an abnormal embryonic lung tissue that is segregated from the tracheal bronchial system and does not communicate through normal bronchus. Since the sequestrated lung is cystic, it does not function normally. There are two types of pulmonary sequestration. Intralobar sequestrations, seen most frequently in adults, are located within the visceral pleura and are contained within the lung parenchyma. Extralobar sequestrations, which are located outside the visceral pleura, have their own separate pleural covering. The most common location for intralobar sequestration is the posterior basilar segments of the lower lobe. It is characterized by bronchiectasis with cystic areas containing mucus or mucopurulent material, and is lined with ciliated columnar or cuboidal epithelium. The walls may contain cailage and glands. In the adult, multifocal epithelial changes can occur, and dysplastic or carcinomatotic changes have been repoed within intralobar sequestrations. The most common site of the region of the anomalous aerial supply in pulmonary sequestration is the thoracic aoa, followed by the abdominal aoa and intercostal aeries. Cough and hemoptysis may be the initial symptoms. On plain x-ray, intralobar sequestration appears as a solid or cystic mass located in the lower lobe. Air-fluid levels are seen and may be mistaken for pneumonia, bronchiectasis, or abscess formation. Bronchoscopy reveals no abnormality, and for a definitive diagnosis of sequestration it is impoant to demonstrate the systemic aerial supply. CT scan or aoography can accomplish this. Untreated sequestration has an associated morbidity related to infection, vascular shunting and hemoptysis; thus, resection is the treatment of choice.",

This is a classic example of a clinical scenario with a high likelihood of pulmonary embolism in a high-risk patient. The chest radiograph is often unimpressive or normal, as in this case. However, congestive atelectasis, as mentioned in the previous question, moderate bloody pleural effusion, and nodular or patchy infiltrates can be seen.

These are triangular pleural-based infiltrates with their apex toward the hilum. The increased alveolar aerial gradient seen on the aerial blood gas study suggests a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch and rules out an acute anxiety state as the cause of the symptoms. Although the patient has a history of bronchial asthma, the lung exam reveals no wheezing or expiratory prolongation and symptoms have been well controlled. Peak flows are satisfactory and hence an acute asthmatic attack is unlikely. With a hemoglobin level of 12 g/dL and no clinical evidence of heart failure, a diagnosis of high-output heart failure is incorrect. The clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism warrants fuher diagnostic steps. A V/Q scan would be most helpful in reaching a diagnosis, especially in this case with a normal CXR.

Radioisotope scan:# Lung scanning is now a second-line diagnostic test for PE and used for who cannot tolerate IV contrast.# Small particulate aggregates of albumin labelled with a gamma-emitting radionuclide are injected intravenously and are trapped in the pulmonary capillary bed.# The perfusion scan defect indicates absent or decreased blood flow, possibly due to PE.# Ventilation scans with radiolabeled gases (xenon or krypton), improve the specificity of the perfusion scan.# A normal perfusion scan virtually excludes PE because a pulmonary embolus presents as V/Q mismatch. Magnetic Resonance (MR) (Contrast-Enhanced):# When ultrasound is equivocal, MR venography is an excellent imaging modality to diagnose DVT.# MR utilizes gadolinium, which, unlike iodinated contrast used in venography or CTA, is not nephrotoxic.# MR should be considered for suspected DVT or PE patients with renal insufficiency or contrast dye allergy.# MRA detects large proximal PE but is not reliable for smaller segmental and subsegmental PE.

        "exp": "Ans. A. Tetralogy of Fallota. Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect with an incidence of approximately 420 per million live births. It is caused by malalignment of the infundibular septum, which leads to right ventricular outflow (RVOT) obstruction, a subaortic VSD with aortic override and right ventricular hypertrophy. b. Trans-thoracic echocardiography is the imaging modality of choice for initial diagnosis and assessment. Initial chest radiographic appearances may include right ventricular heart silhouette, a boot-shaped heart, small hila, pulmonary oligemia or asymmetry and concave pulmonary artery segment. The aortic arch is right sided in about 30%. c. Current management consists of early single stage reconstructive surgery, with closure of the VSD, and relief of the RVOT obstruction, with possible placement of a trans annular patch. Staged reconstruction is still required if there is significant hypoplasia of the central pulmonary arteries, with placement of a modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt--a systemic-to-pulmonary anastomosis, usually between the innominate artery and the right pulmonary artery. d. This shunt is then taken down during subsequent definitive repair. e. Cross-sectional imaging has a role in delineating pulmonary artery anatomy in the younger child, defining whether reconstructive pulmonary artery surgery is required prior to definitive surgery. f. However, the main role of imaging in patients with tetralogy of Fallot is the assessment of postoperative complications Chest radiography at this stage may show evidence of previous BT shunt surgery, asymmetric pulmonary circulation, and calcification of the trans annular patch. g. The most common late postoperative complication is pulmonary regurgitation secondary to trans annular patch reconstruction of the RVOT/pulmonary annulus and is often associated with aneurysmal dilatation of the RVOT. Surgical or transcatheter valve replacement is the current method of managing patients with severe pulmonary regurgitation. h. Accurate quantification of regurgitation and assessment of RVOT anatomy and right ventricular function are particularly important in deciding the type, timing, and multiplicity of procedures. Branch pulmonary stenosis may also be present in this patient group and is best imaged by MRA. i. This can contribute to right ventricular dysfunction, and significant obstructions should be repaired at the same time as valve replacement. The final role of MRI is in evaluating right ventricular function. j. This is important for timing of invasive therapeutic measures and evaluating the effect of any invasive procedure. It has been shown that, using a combination of MR ventricular volumetry and tricuspid and pulmonary flow maps, precise information about global and diastolic ventricular function can be assessed in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot.",

        "exp": "These x-rays show a marked degree of hyperinflation depicted radiographically by increased lung volume with flattened diaphragm and widened interspaces. Attenuation of the pulmonary vasculature in the peripheral lung zones, especially in the lower zones, is seen. These x-ray are consistent with severe emphysema. The lower lobe accentuation of hyperinflation is consistent with a1 antitrypsin deficiency causing panacinar emphysema. The physical signs and CXR suggest emphysema. This is confirmed by an obstructive ventilatory impairment with hyperinflation, air trapping, and reduced diffusion. In bronchial asthma, there would typically be marked bronchodilator response, and the patient with chronic bronchitis would present with chronic sputum production. Tuberous sclerosis presents radiographically as hyperinflation and lower zone infiltrates, but clinically is a systemic disease with a clinical triad of mental retardation, seizure disorder, and dermal angiofibromas called adenoma sebaceum. Pulmonary disease is rare (it is seen in less than 1% of cases) and presents with pneumothoraces and hemoptysis. Pulmonary emphysema is a chronic condition characterized by irreversible enlargement of airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles with destruction of the alveolar walls and intraalveolar septa. It results in a loss of lung elastic recoil causing airflow obstruction, air trapping, and hyperinflation. Pulmonary function tests reveal an obstructive pattern with elevated total lung capacity, increased residual volume, and decreased diffusion capacity. Chest x-ray reveals all signs of hyperinflation as illustrated above. CT scan is the most sensitive imaging modality to reliably detect emphysema. Although pulmonary aery enlargement and mild pulmonary aerial hypertension are common in advanced emphysema, radiographic evaluation of pulmonary aery size is a poor indicator of PA pressures. Other concomitant pulmonary disease processes such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema may present in an atypical fashion in a patient with emphysema. Forms of emphysema include the following: 1. Centrilobular emphysema is the most common form, found predominantly in cigarette smokers. The destructive process begins with involvement of the center of the secondary lobule and extends into the lung parenchyma. The upper lobes are more frequently involved. 2. Panacinar emphysema begins with the involvement of the entire secondary lobule with diffuse, widespread lung destruction. It is seen in a1 antitrypsin deficiency and has lower zone predominance. 3. Paraseptal emphysema refers to peripheral lung destruction adjacent to the visceral pleura and interlobular septa. Progressive dyspnea associated with increasing paraseptal emphysema forming bullae refers to the \"vanishing lung syndrome\" 4. Congenital emphysema is seen in the first few months of life and refers to a large hyperlucent lobe associated with compressive and mass effect on the adjacent structures. 5. Compensatory emphysema refers to hyperlucent and hyperinflated airspaces adjacent to areas of deformity, atelectasis, or resection of lung and represents overexpansion without actual lung destruction. 6. Scar emphysema is associated with conditions of fibrosis and scarring and associated honeycombing as in stage 4 sarcoidosis or chronic inflammatory conditions.",

        "exp": "These x-rays show a large area of hyperlucency with no lung markings in the right upper and middle zone bounded by a very distinct margin. The area below the margin shows increased density and compression. There is attenuation of vascular markings and increased lucency in the left upper zone also. This is consistent with a large bulla in the right upper lobe and a smaller bulla in the left upper lobe. The CXR shows a large bulla, which accounts for the symptoms of this patient. Discrepancy in total lung capacity as assessed by the helium dilution and body plethysmography methods suggests significant gas trapping in the bulla and can be used to estimate the volume of the bulla. Bullae become symptomatic as they enlarge, and the goal of surgical therapy is to excise them to enable the surrounding tissue to reexpand. CT scan is helpful to determine the size, extent, and number of bullae present. It also helps in evaluating the anatomy of the remaining lung and its potential for effective reexpansion. PFTs may show a restrictive pattern if the bulla does not communicate with the airways. If there is no diffuse, widespread emphysema and profound hypoxemia or hypercarbia is not present, surgical resection of the bulla is likely to improve the symptoms. Placement of a chest tube in this case would conve an intrapulmonary closed airspace into a bronchopleural cutaneous fistula and is therefore not an appropriate option.",

        "exp": "This is a PA, slightly lordotic chest film, although there is some failure to fully abduct the scapula. The left hemithorax is markedly hyperlucent; there is some widening of the interspaces with a depressed diaphragm and air under the hea shadow. There is a large bandlike shadow extending from the apex of the left lung down to the bottom of the hea with silhouetting of the left cardiac border. This represents a total lung collapse with atelectasis; however, some of the air totally surrounds the lung with hyperlucency around the aoic knob. Most pneumothoraces usually show a sharp edge differentiating the free air in the pleural space from the normal pulmonary parenchyma, with a line representing the pleural surfaces. In this paicular case, because of marked collapse with circumferential air, one does not see the sharp line and observes bilateral edges, i. e., differences in contrast between a more radiodense and radiolucent back-ground. The very sharp edge along the left hea border represents the contrast between the collapsed lung and the pleural space and is called the visceral pleural line. The chest wall appears irregular along the level of lateral 6th to 7th ribs, probably representing a rib fracture. The acute onset of severe shoness of breath and left-sided chest pain suggests concurrent pleural disease as pa of the differential diagnosis. This is confirmed by the chest x-ray showing a left-sided pneumothorax. Patients with COPD and/or bullous disease have chronic symptoms. With an acute exacerbation of COPD, the chest x-ray is helpful in distinguishing a pneumothorax vs. pneumonia. On physical exam, patients with pneumothorax present with absent breath sounds and hyperresonance on the side of the pneumothorax.
