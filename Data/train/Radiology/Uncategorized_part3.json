So Gadolinium enhanced MRIQ became definitive investigation for acoustic neuroma (vestibular shwanomma). Neuromas / Neurinomas / Neurolemmomas arise from Schwann cells which invest the cranial nerves; therefore they are more correctly called Schwannomas. They can arise from any cranial or spinal root except the optic and olfactory nerves, which are myelinated by oligodendroglia rather than Schwann cells. Schwannomas most frequently arise in eighth (VIII) cranial nerve and are known as vestibular or acoustic Schwannoma /Neuronia. 8th nerve tumor are the most common tumors affecting the petrous pyramid - as 80% arise within the internal auditory meatus (IAM), usually from vestibular nerve. Fifth (V) cranial nerve is the second most common site. Tumors arising from Vth (5), VIIth (7), XIth (11) or XII (12) cranial nerves may affect temporal bone. These are all very rare except in cases of neurofibromatosis (NF) type 2. Thin section T2 MRI is the standard investigation to demonstrate or exclude the presence of an acoustic neuroma. Vestibular Schwannomas are iso to hypo intense globular mass centered over IAC on T2 images and the enlargement of internal auditory canal is distinguishing feature that differentiates them from other cerebello pontine angle masses. However, gadolinium enhancement on T1 weighted images is usually used to confirm diagnosisQ. Gadolinium enhancement is also required in NF2, for follow UPS after paial or total removal of acoustic neuroma. Now, latest MRI scanners using either gradient-echo or spin- echo 3. DFT constructive interference in steady state (CISS) can produce thin section T2 images. Meningiomas are 2nd most common tumors arising in cerebello pontine angle. Unlike Schwannomas, meningiomas usually calcify & tend to have broad attachment to the petrous ridge, which may show characteristic hyperostosis. Meningiomas show intense contrast enhancement with gadolinium MRI (Gd. MR).",

        "exp": "C i. e. (Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): (without any doubt) Bunch of grapes appearance with lobulated margins is highly suggestive (and characteristic) of serous cystadenoma. It is actually a cystic tumor with multiple tiny cyst (>6 in number))measuring < 2cm in size with a high stromal content seperated by thin septa lined by epithelial cell. Therefore these lesions appear solid owing to the compact arrangement of multiple small cyst forming myriad of (many) interfaces and produce finely lobulated microcystic lesion with internal septation producing classic cluster of grapes appearance. In mucinous cystadema the cysts are mostly large (average 10cm) unilocular or multilocular (<6) with a less prominent lobulation. Intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (IPMT) produce cystic appearance b/o dilated pancreatic ductal system distal to IPMT, so it is more like a distended ductal system covered by normal pancreatic parenchyma. So in mucinous cystadenoma cysts are much larger & lesser, whereas in IPMT there is no true microcystic pattern to produce almost solid bunch of grape appearance. Now lets focus on grossly dilated ductal'system which indicates total or near total ductal obstruction. All of them can 1/t ductal obstruction & gross dilatation the only difference is that it is almost always early, intraluminal with out obstructive ductal stricture, intense and communicating (i. e. cyst communicates with pancreatic duct) in IPMT, whereas it is b/o compression of duct from outside, in mucinous & serous cystadenoma (in which case it is gradual & non communicating). Serous cystodenoma occurs in females over age of 60 years (range 35-85yrs; F: M = 2/4: 1) whereas IPMN mainly occurs in males between 60 & 80 years.

        "exp": "Clinical Features KOTs usually have no symptoms, although mild swelling may occur. Pain may occur with secondary infection. Aspiration may reveal a thick, yellow, cheesy material (keratin). In contrast to cysts, KOTs have a high propensity for recurrence, possibly because of small satellite cysts or fragments of epithelium left behind after surgical removal of the cyst. Differential Diagnosis When in a pericoronal position, a KOT may be indistinguishable from a dentigerous cyst. The lesion is likely to be a KOT if the cystic outline is connected to the tooth at a point apical to the cementoenamel junction or if no expansion of the cortical plates has occurred. Also, although KOTs can develop occlusal to developing teeth, often the follicle of the involved tooth is not enlarged as in dentigerous cysts. The typical scalloped margin and multilocular appearance of the KOT may resemble an ameloblastoma, but the latter has a greater propensity to expand. Radiographic interpretation- As with cysts, KOTs usually show evidence of a cortical border, unless they have become secondarily infected. The cyst may have a smooth, round or oval shape identical to that of other cysts, or it may have a scalloped outline (a series of contiguous arcs).

The gamma camera is composed of radiation detectors, called gamma camera heads. The most common type of gamma camera is the single-headed system. it consists of a gamma camera detector mounted on a gantry that allows the camera head to be positioned in a flexible way over different regions of the patient's body. Dual-headed gamma cameras are becoming increasingly popular. In these systems, two gamma camera heads are mounted onto the gantry.

        "exp": "Mass density The essential physics of medical imaging By Jerrold T. Bushberg 2/e p3. 56 writes? \"What do CT numbers correspond to physically in the patient? CT images are produced with a highly filtered, high-kV x-ray beam, with an average energy of about 75 keV. At this energy in muscle tissue, about 91% of x-ray interactions are Comptom scatter. For. fat and hone, Compton scattering interactions are 94% and 74%, respectively. Therefore, CT numbers and CT images derive their contrast mainly. from the physical propeies of tissue that influence Compton scatter. Density (g/cubic cm) is a very impoant discriminating propey of tissue, and the linear attenuation coefficient (p) tracks linearly with density. Other than physical density, the Compton scatter cross section depends on the electron density in tissue: Electron density = NZ/A where N is Avogadro's number (a constant) Z is the atomic number, A is the atomic mass The main constituents of soft tissue are hydrogen (Z = 1, A = 1), carbon (Z = 6, A = 12), nitrogen (Z = 7, A = 14), and oxygen (Z = 8, A = 16). Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen all have the WA ratio of 0. 5, so their electron densities are the same. Because the Z/A ratio. for hydrogen is 1. 0, the relative abundance of hydrogen in a tissue has some influence on CT number. Hydrogenous tissue such as fat is well visualized on CT Neveheless, density (g/cubic cm) plays the dominant role in forming contrast in medical CT. \" \"The difference in electron density of tissues depends upon physical density. Therefore, the soft tissue contrast achieved in an image is primarily determined by the relative physical densities of the structures, not by the relative differences in atomic numbers. \"- Neuroimaging By Robe A. Zimmerman, Wendell A. Gibby, Raymond F. Carmody P5 CT is a tomographic imaging technique that generates cross-sectional images in the axial plane. The basic concept of x-ray CT is simple. By looking at an object from multiple directions a three dimensional representation of that object can be formed. A thin beam of x-rays is passed through the body from multiple different projections. When an x-ray beam passes through the body, there is a logarithmic attenuation of its intensity over distance. A measurement of the intensity of the exiting beam is known as the linear attenuation coefficient when the attenuator thickness is 1 cm. The linear attenuation coefficient is related to the absorption of a given material both photoelectric interaction and Comptom scattering interactions. This, of course, depends upon the energy of the x-ray beam and the type of material being irradiated. CT images are maps of the relative linear attenuation coefficient of tissues. The relative attenuation coefficient is normally expressed in Hounsfield units (HU), also known as CT numbers (Named in honor of the inventor of CT, Geoffrey Hounsfield). The HU of material Xis HU = 1000 X (14-14)/1. 1.,,., where x, is the attenuation coefficient of the material X, and ix,. is the attenuation coefficient of water. By definition, the HU value for water is always zero. HU value for air is -1000 ( minus 1000) HU value for coical bone is 1000",

Left upper lobe (posterior pa) - Consolidation of apical poion of left upper lobe (LUL) will obliterate or obscure the aoic knuckle (knob) poion of cardiac shadow on chest x-ray (Mnemonic-LUL sounds like Knuckle\") * - Consolidation of lingula (anterior) obscures left heart border (i. e. left cardiac silhouette) and consolidation of righ middle lobe (RML) obliterates right heart border (right cardiac sihoutte). Mn= \"Lingula is left and RML is right\". Radiographic Mediastinal Signs Silhouette's (Obscured Margin) Sign - The normal radio-opaque margins of soft tissue mediastinal structures (such as heart, aoic arch, hilum, azygoesophageal recesses) and diaphragm are visible on chest x-ray because they are outlined by adjacent air containing radiolucent lung (i. e. b/o normal soft tissue air inteface/contrast). -Silhouette (obscured margin) sign is based on the principle, which says that if two structures have approximately the same radiographic density, and are in intimate contact with each other, then the interface between them is obliterated\". However, if there is even a small gap between them, then they are seen with their borders as separate entities. An intrathoracic lesion touching a border of heart, aoa or diaphragm and having similar radiographic density (opacity) will obliterate that border on X-ray. And a lesion not anatomically contigious with a border of these structures or having markedly dissimilar density will not obliterate that border. - Silhouette's invisible or obscured border sign is caused by any intrathoracic opacity eg consolidation, pneumonia, mass, fluid, atelectasia of same density as the adjacent normal structure. This sign is used to diagnose variety of lung/chest conditions and to localize it to a specific lobe /region of lung. Silhoutte sign is very useful in localizing lung lesions as all structures forming cardiac silhoutte (heart border, ascending descending aoa, aoic knob & hemidiaphragm) are in contact with a specific poion of lung. Silhoutte structure (which may be obscured by pathology) Lung lobe/poion in contact Upper right heart border (Superior RUL (Right upper lobe, anterior vena cava), Ascending aoa & Upper pole of hilum = Superior right mediastinum or Right Aoic border segment) & anterior segment of RML Right heart border/Right cardiac RML (Right middle lobe, medial) sithoutte >>> Right medial lower lobe Aoic knudcle/knob/arch LUL (Left upper lobe apico-posterior segment) Upper left heart border (left superior LUL (Left upper lobe anterior mediastinum) segment) Left heart border (Left cardiac silhoutte) Lingula (anterior) segment of LUL Anterior hemidiaphragm Lower lobe (anterior- basal segments) Position of oblique fissure is best index of lower lobe volume. Left hemidiaphragm, Descending aoa Left lower lobe (LL) Right hemidiaphragm Right lower lobe (RLL) - Obscuration of right heart border (right cardiac silhouette) on PA viewQ and movement of horizontal fissure and lower half of oblique fissure toward one another on lateral projection is diagnostic of right middle lobe collapse. With the exception of absence of horizontal fissure on left, radiological features of lingual collapse are similar to right middle lobe collapse. - In right upper lobe collapse, lateral end of horizontal fissure moves upward & medially (towards superior mediastinum) & its anterior end moves upward towards apex. And the upper half of oblique fissure moves anteriorly. Both fissures become concave superiorly. Cervico-Thoracic Sign It is based on the fact that upper most border anterior mediastinum ends at the level of clavicle while middle (higher) & posterior (highest) mediastinum projects above clavicle. Therefore, a well defined mass (which is sharply outlined by apical lung) above the clavicles is always posterior, whereas an anterior mass being in contact with soft tissues (of same density) rather than aerated lung, is ill defined (have unsharp borders) Hilar-Overlay Sign - It allows differentiation of true cardiomegaly from large anterior mediastinal masses. In cardiomegaly the hilum is displaced laterally whereas in the presence of anterior mediastinal mass the hilum is seen projecting medial to the lateral border of mass. With the mediastinal mass, the hilium is seen through the mass whereas with cardiomegaly the hilum is displaced so that only its lateral border is visible. Hilar Bifurcation (Convergence) Sign - It differentiates hilar masses from vascular structures in cases of hilar enlargment. - If the vessels (eg pulmonary aeries) are seen to arise directly from the hilar shadow (i. e. vessels converge into lateral border of cardiac silhoutte) then the enlargement is vascular, but if they appear to arise medial to the lateral aspect of the hilar shadow, the enlargment is caused by an extravascular mass.",

C: Scurvy Clinical symptoms and signs of infantile scurvy, in order of frequency are irritability, tenderness and weakness of lower extremities, a scorbutic rosary of the legs, bleeding of the gums (usually where teeth have erupted), and fever. Radiographic findings of scurvy: Dense metaphyseal line-This is due to an intensification of the zone of preparatory calcification, resulting from matrix formation failing, is has been referred to as the white line of Frenkel, but is non-specific, as it is also seen in healing rickets, and lead or phosphorus poisoning. Ground glass osteoporosis: This appears at the end of the shaft with blurring or disappearance of trabecular markings. Halo ossification centre: Also called the Wimberger's ring, it is the same effect that produces the white line of Frenkel, affecting the epiphyseal ossification center. Corner sign-Seen due to subepiphyseal infarction, or separation of the epiphysis from the metaphysis. Lateral spurs-These metaphyseal spurs project at right angles to the axis of the shaft, they may be seen due to mushrooming of epiphysis on the metaphysis, or may represent earliest calcification of periosteum elevated by a subperiosteal hemorrhage. Subperiosteal hematomas-These occur at the end of long bones, seen after about 2 weeks of onset of clinical symptoms; it is not the periosteal hemorrhage that calcifies, but the elevated periosteum, secondary to resumption of bone formation. Metaphyseal fractures-Subperiosteal comminuted fractures at the end of long bones, extending only paially through the width of the bone.

Advantage of this technique is that, it decreases the internal target volume and reduce the volume of normal tissue that is irradiated. Disadvantage of this approach is prolonged treatment time and lack of direct imaging of tumor position during treatment. Ref: Lung Cancer By Kemp H.

Diagnostic criteria: peak <80meq/L Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio pancreaticography (ERCP) DC: Cambridge III, dilated main pancreatic duct & >3 dilated side branch Acute Pancreatitis Any severe acute pain in abdomen or back should suggest the possibility of acute pancreatitis. Abdominal pain, is the major symptom of acute pancreatitis characteristically, the pain which is steady & boring in character, is located in epigastrium & periumbilical regionQ and often radiates to the backQ as well as to the chest, flank & lower abdomen. The patient often obtains relief by sitting with the trunk flexed and knees drawn upQ. When a patient with possible predisposition to pancreatitis (such as gall stone, alcoholism, ERCP, hyperigyceridemia, trauma, surgery and drugs like azathioprine, sulfonamides, estrogen, tetracycline, valproic acid, 6-merceptopurine & anti HIV drugs) presents with severe & constant abdominal pain frequently a/w nausea, fever, emesis, tachycardia, leukocytosis, hypocalcemia and hyperglycemia, the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is usually enteained. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires 2 of the following: typical abdominal pain, 3 fold or greater increase in serum amylase &/or lipase (which usually establishes/clinch the diagnosis if gut perforation, ischemia or infraction are excluded, however, levels does not indicate the severity) and confirmatory findings on cross sectional abdominal imaging. A CTscan can confirm the diagnosis of acute pancreatitisQ even with less than a 3 fold increase in serum amylase and lipase levels. It also indicates severity of disease, risk of morbidity and moality and evaluates complication of acute pancreatitis. However, a CTscan within 3-5 days of symptom onset may underestimate the extent of tissue injury (hence repeated again).

It also reduces patient exposure by absorbing some of the residual X-ray beam. Most importantly, if the film packet is placed backward in the patient's mouth so that the tube side of the film is facing away from the x-ray machine, the lead foil will be positioned between the subject and the film. In this circumstance, most of the radiation is absorbed by the lead foil, and the resulting radiograph is light and shows the embossed pattern in the lead foil.

        "exp": "The periphery of fibrous dysplasia lesions most commonly is ill defined, with a gradual blending of normal trabecular bone into an abnormal trabecular pattern. Occasionally, the boundary between normal bone and the lesion can appear sharp and even corticated, especially in young lesions. The abnormal trabeculae usually are shorter, thinner, irregularly shaped, and more numerous than normal trabeculae. This creates a radiopaque pattern that can vary; it may have a granular appearance (or ground-glass appearance, resembling the small fragments of a shattered windshield), a pattern resembling the surface of an orange (peau d'orange), a wispy arrangement (cotton wool), or an amorphous, dense pattern. A distinctive characteristic is the organization of the abnormal trabeculae into a swirling pattern similar to a fingerprint. Occasionally, radiolucent regions resembling cysts may occur in mature lesions of fibrous dysplasia. These are bone cavities that are analogous to simple bone cysts and occur more commonly in mandibular lesions. If the fibrous dysplasia increases the bone density, the periodontal ligament space may appear to be very narrow. Fibrous dysplasia can displace teeth or interfere with normal eruption, complicating orthodontic therapy. In rare cases, some root resorption may occur. Involved teeth may have hypercementosis. Fibrous dysplasia appears to be unique in its ability to displace the inferior alveolar nerve canal in a superior direction.

Dental radiography applies the theorem as follows. The receptor is positioned as close as possible to the lingual surface of the teeth, resting in the palate or on the floor of the mouth. The plane of the receptor and the long axis of the teeth form an angle with its apex at the point, where the receptor is in contact with the teeth along an imaginary line that bisects this angle and directs the central ray of the beam at right angles to this bisector. This forms two triangles with two equal angles and a common side (the imaginary bisector). Consequently, when these conditions are satisfied, the images cast on the receptor theoretically are the same length as the projected object. To reproduce the length of each root of a multirooted tooth accurately, the central beam must be angled differently for each root. Ref: ORAL RADIOLOGY Principles and Interpretation, Stuart C.

Focal tenderness over the gallbladder when compressed by the sonographic probe (sonographic Murphy's sign) also is suggestive of acute cholecystitis.

        "question": "Which of the following is a harmful: March 2009",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Alpha Paicle The radiation one typically encounters is one of four types: alpha radiation, beta radiation, gamma radiation, and X-radiation. Neutron radiation is also encountered in nuclear power plants and high-altitude flight and emitted from some industrial radioactive sources. A Alpha radiation is a heavy, very sho-range paicle and is actually an ejected helium nucleus. Some characteristics of alpha radiation are: Most alpha radiation is not able to penetrate human skin. Alpha-emitting materials can be harmful to humans if the materials are inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through open wounds. A thin-window Geiger-Mueller (GM) probe can detect the presence of alpha radiation. Instruments cannot detect alpha radiation through even a thin layer of water, dust, paper, or other material, because alpha radiation is not penetrating. Alpha radiation travels only a sho distance (a few inches) in air, but is not an external hazard. Alpha radiation is not able to penetrate clothing. Examples of some alpha emitters: radium, radon, uranium, thorium. Alpha paicle has poor penetration but maximum ionizing power and is most damaging. B. Beta radiation is a light, sho-range paicle and is actually an ejected electron. Some characteristics of beta radiation are: Beta radiation may travel several feet in air and is moderately penetrating. Beta radiation can penetrate human skin to the \"germinal layer, \" where new skin cells are produced. If high levels of beta-emitting contaminants are allowed to remain on the skin for a prolonged period of time, they may cause skin injury. Beta-emitting contaminants may be harmful if deposited internally. Most beta emitters can be detected with a survey instrument and a thin-window GM probe (e. g., \"pancake\" type). Examples of these difficult-to-detect beta emitters are hydrogen-3 (tritium), carbon-14, and sulfur-35. Clothing provides some protection against beta radiation. Examples of some pure beta emitters: strontium-90, carbon-14, tritium, and sulfur-35. Beta paicle has moderate penetration, moderate ionizing power and is moderate damaging. C. Gamma radiation and X-rays are highly penetrating electromagnetic radiation. Some characteristics of these radiations are: Gamma radiation or X-rays are able to travel many feet in air and many inches in human tissue. They readily penetrate most materials and are sometimes called \"penetrating\" radiation. X-rays are like gamma rays. X-rays, too, are penetrating radiation. Sealed radioactive sources and machines that emit gamma radiation and X-rays respectively constitute mainly an external hazard to humans. Gamma radiation and X-rays are electromagnetic radiation like visible light, radiowaves, and ultraviolet light. Dense materials are needed for shielding from gamma radiation. Clothing provides little shielding from penetrating radiation, but will prevent contamination of the skin by gamma-emitting radioactive materials. Gamma radiation is easily detected by survey meters with a sodium iodide detector probe. Gamma radiation and/or characteristic x rays frequently accompany the emission of alpha and beta radiation during radioactive decay. Examples of some gamma emitters: iodine-131, cesium-137, cobalt-60, radium-226, and technetium-99m. Gamma paicle are most penetrating, minimum ionizing power and is least damaging",

        "exp": "B i. e. MRI Vascular Rings Vascular rings is a condition in which an anomalous configuration of the arch and /or its associated vessels completely or incompletely surrounds the trachea & oesophagus causing compression of these structures. Neonates present with respiratory distress and older children present with stridor or dysphagia. Fouh developmental arch is most impoant. The two most common types of complete vascular rings, which account for 85-95% of cases are double aoic arch and right aoic arch with left ligamentum aeriosum Chest x-ray is the first & most commonly performed investigation. The identification of right aoic arch or ill defined arch location and compression of trachea in symptomatic child indicate the diagnosis. Many authorities consider barium oesophagoscopy to be the most impoant study in patients with suspected vascular ring and it is diagnostic in vast majority of cases. - A double aoic arch produce bilateral & posterior compression of oesophagus, which remain constant regardless of peristalsis. The right indentation is usually slightly higher than left and posterior one is usually wide & course in a downward direction from right to left. Right subclan aery takes a retrooesophageal course, there is a posterior defect slanting upward from left to right. The posterior defect is less broad than in double aoic arch. Echocardiography can be used but structures without lumen such as ligamentum aeriosum or an atretic arch are difficult to be identified. Plain x-ray & barium swallow can not reliably distinguish among the types of vascular rings. Cross section images by CT, MRI and digital substraction angiography (DSA) can be useful diagnostic tool in delineating the anatomy and aiding in presurgical planning & post surgical assessment. MR angiography (MRA) is an excellent substitute for DSA but young patients may require general anesthesia & where there is already airway compromise, this should be avoided. MRI is preferred as it is non invasive and avoids radiation riskQ. Multidetector CT is rarely used b/o radiation implication. Angiography (an invasive method) is rarely required unless cardiac catheterization is necessary for investigation of associated cardiac anomalies and if MRI is equivocal (same protocol applies for coarctation of aoa i. e. MRI > CT > Angiography).",
