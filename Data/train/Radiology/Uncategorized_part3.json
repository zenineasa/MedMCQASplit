        "exp": "Ans. D All of the above Radium was discovered in 1898 by French physicist and Nobel laureate Marie Curie in pitchblende (a uranium andradiumbearing mineral). There is about 1 gram of radium in 7 tons of pitchblende. Elemental radium was isolated by Madam Merry Curie in 1911 Radium is a naturally radioactive, silvery-white metal when freshly cut. It blackens on exposure to air. Purified radium and some radium compounds glow in the dark (luminesce). The radiation emitted by radium can also cause ceain materials, called \"phosphors\" to emit light. Mixtures of radium salts and appropriate phosphors were widely used for clock dials and gauges before the risks of radium exposure were understood. Metallic radium is highly chemically reactive. It forms compounds that are very similar to barium compounds, making separation of the two elements difficult. The various isotopes of radium originate from the radioactive decay of uranium or thorium. Radium-226, the most common isotope, is an alpha emitter, with accompanying gamma radiation, and has a half-life of about 1600 years. Radium-228, is principally a beta emitter and has a half-life of 5. 76 years. Radium-224, an alpha emitter, has a half life of 3. 66 days. Radium decays to form isotopes of the radioactive gas radon, which is not chemically reactive. Stable lead is the finalproduct of this lengthy radioactive decay series.",

Multiple studies have found that E/F-speed film is preferred because it has the same useful density range, latitude, contrast, and image quality as D-speed films and can be used in routine intraoral radiographic examinations without sacrifice of diagnostic information.

The advantages of TVS is that it can be performed in empty bladder and its ability to use higher frequency trandsducer nearer the organs of interst thus providing higher resolution of uterus, ovaries, cul de sac & adnexa. - Doppler may prove valuable in assessment of pregnancy complications & at risk factusQ. Both fetoplacental & uteroplacental circulations can be assessed. As normal pregnancy progresses, placental blood flow increases d/t reduction in placental vascular resistanceQ. - Increased placental resistance results in reduced blood flow, manifesting as decreased or absent end diastolic flow. Systolic diastolic (S/D) ratio, resistive & pulsatility indices are used to quantify these changes. Increased values of S/D ratio & R-P indices and reduction in end diastolic flow are associated with IUGR & poor fetal outcomeQ. (d/t fetoplacental insufficiency). Other associations include pregnancy induced hypertension, oligohydramnios, & cesarian section for fetal distress. Doppler USG is either continuous wave or duplex (pulsed) wave. The duplex wave from uterine & umblical aeries is useful in assessment of IUGR whereas colour & power doppler are invaluable in assessment of fetal hea & outflow tracts and other fetal vessels such as intracerebral & renal aeries. Although, predictive value of continuous wave doppler for IUGR is relatively low, reversed diastolic flow indicates severely hypoxic fetus. In head spared IUGR, diastolic flow to brain (cerebra aery obtained by colour doppler) is increased, an indication that the head is spared from the diminished flow to the body.",

DXA/DEXA/Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry It is a highly accurate X-ray technique that has become the standard for measuring bone density in most centers. Standard X-rays cannot detect bone loss until 30% of bone has been lost; where as DXA can detect as little as 1% of bone loss. However DXA is a two dimensional scanning technique and cannot estimate the depths or posteroanterior length of the bone. Thus small people tend to have lower then average bone minerals density (BMD). Bone spurs, which are frequent in osteoporosis, tend to falsely increase bone density of the FDA approved indications for BMD tests are: Estrogen deficient women at risk of osteoporosis Gliicocoicoid treatment equivalent to 7. 5 mg of prednisole, or duration of therapy > 3 months Primary hyper parathyroidismQ Veebral abnormalities on X-ray suggestive of osteoporosis (osteopenia, veebral fracture) Monitoring response to an FDA-approved medication for osteoporosis Repeat BMD evaluation at > 23 month intervals, or more frequently if medically justified. Biochemical markers of bone metabolism in clinical use are spine. - Though it can be used for measurement of any skeletal site, clinical determinations are usually made of the lumbar spine and hip.

Intravenous contrast medium may be injected when the primary purpose of examination is to show the mediastinum or hilar structures. High resolution CT (HRCT) uses very thin 1-2 mm thick. (2 High resolution chest CT (HRCT chest) is the procedure of choice for hyper sensitivity pneumonitis (HP) or extrinsic allergic alveolitisQ such as farmer's / mushroom worker's / bird fancier's / chemical worker's / hot tub / coffee worker's etc - lung. HRCT - chest is superior to plain Xray chest for early detection and confirmation of suspected interstial lung disease (ILD)Q such as fibrosing alveolitis, lymphangitic carcinoma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, eosinophilic granuloma, asbestosis, berylliosis and other industrial lung diseases etc. When lung biopsy is required, HRCT is useful for determining most appropriate area from which biopsy sample should be taken. Chest CT is specific and imaging modality of choice for confirming diagnosis of bronchiectasisQ. CT findings include airway dilation (detected as \"parallel tram tracks\" or \"signet ring sign\"), lack of bronchial tapering (showing presence of tubular structure within 1 cm from pleural surface), bronchial wall thickening, inspissated secretions (tree-in-bud pattern), or cysts originating from bronchial wall. Helical CT scanning allows collection of continuous data over a larger volume of lung during a single breath holding maneuver (faster scan with improved contrast enhancement & thinner collimation) that allows less motion aifact. Data from single imaging procedure can be reconstructed as images in planes other than the traditional axial (cross-sectional) view, including coronal, or saggital planes or even 3D representation (viual bronchoscopy) mimicking visualization through a bronchoscope. Multidetector CT (MDCT) uses higher number of detectors (upto 64) along scanning (Z) axis to obtain multiple slices in a single rotation that are thinner and can be acquired in a shoer period of time, resulting in enhanced resolution and increased image reconstruction ability. Shoer breath holds are especially beneficial for children, elderly and critically ill patients, however, at the risk of increased radiation dose. MDCT has led to improved imaging of pulmonary vasculature and the ability to detect segmental & subsegmental emboli. In contrast to pulmonary angiography, CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) by MDCT usually allows simultaneous detection of parenchymal abnormalities; and has rapidly become the test of choice in evaluation of pulmonary embolismQ (b/o equal accuracy and less risk in comparison to pulmonary angiography).",

Dosimeters should be worn in the region of the collar and should be outside a lead apron if it is used. The three basic types of dosimeters arc film badges, thermoluminescent dosimeters (ILDs), and optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLs). A film badge consists of one or two pieces of dental film that is paper wrapped and enclosed in a badgelike holder that incorporates several filters. The disadvantage of this type of dosimeter is that the dental film is subject to fog when exposed to heat or fumes, and this expo-sure could result in a false reading. TLD badges have one or more lithium fluoride crystals that absorb radiation energy and then emit the energy in the form of light when heated. They arc more durable than film badges and respond only to ionizing radiation exposure. Kinn's Medical Assistant, pg-1075",

PARALLELING TECHNIQUE: The central concept of the paralleling technique (also called the right-angle technique or long-cone technique) is that the X-ray receptor is supported parallel to the long axis of the teeth, and the central ray of the X-ray beam is directed at right angles to the teeth and receptor. This orientation of the receptor, teeth, and central ray minimizes geometric distortion and presents the teeth and supporting bone in their true anatomic relationships. To reduce geometric distortion, the X-ray source should be located relatively distant from the teeth. The use of a long source-to-object distance reduces the apparent size of the focal spot, thus increasing image sharpness, and provides images with minimal magnification.

The prostate, seminal vesicles and vagina are located below the rectovesical pouch or rectouterine/vesicouterine pouches.

Although peritoneum drapes over the rectum, forming the rectovesical fold in males and the rectovaginal fold in females, the rectum would not be clearly outlined by the intraperitoneal contrast since it is not covered by peritoneum on all sides.

(Ref: Osborn Neuroradiology) Cavernous sinus hemangioma is a very rare tumor of this region. ( All the cavernous sinus tumors can cause sixth nerve palsy (and proptosis). So the diagnosis is to be made on the basis of incidence and MR chaaracterstics. MR characteristics: Menigioma - Usually hypointense to isointense on TI-weighted and isointense to hyperintense with T2-weighted images. - Somebooks write that it is mostly isointense on T2 wt sequences. - Enhances homogenously on post contrast scans. Schwannoma - Mostly hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2. - Smaller tumors show homogenous density and strong homogenous enhancement. Larger tumors demonstrate heterogeneity of both density and contrast enhancement because of the presence of intratumoral cystic degeneration & xanthomatous changes. Cavernous hemangioma - Mostly hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on 72. - Shows good homogenous contrast enhancement. Thus meningioma can be ruled out as it usually isointense on T2. We are left with Schwannoma and Cavernous hemangioma. We would personally like to go with Schwannoma as it is one of the commonest tumors of the cavernous sinus and smaller tumors have homogenous enhancement. Cavernous hemangioma though matches more with the contrast enhancement characteristics, is a very rare tumor of this region.",

Use holders to support film or digital sensors intraorally. Make exposures with 60 to 70 k. Vp. Replace short pointed aiming tubes with open-ended aiming cylinders. Use rectangular collimation for periapical and bitewing images. Use thyroid collars. Stand at least 6 feet (2 m) away from patient and away from the X-ray machine (preferably out of X-ray room) when making exposure. With film, use time-temperature film processing rather than \"sight\" processing, or use an automatic processor. Use rare-earth screens for panoramic and cephalometric film imaging or use digital systems. Reduce cone-beam CT beam field of view to region of interest.

The degree of displacement may be considerable. For instance, maxillary third molars or cuspids may be pushed to the floor of the orbit, and mandibular third molars may be moved to the condylar or coronoid regions or to the inferior cortex of the mandible. The floor of the maxillary antrum may be displaced as the cyst invaginates the antrum, or a cyst may displace the inferior alveolar nerve canal in an inferior direction. This slow-growing cyst often expands the outer cortical boundary of the involved jaw. As in the case with radicular cysts, dentigerous cysts that invaginate the sinus can drain and collapse with new bone formation at the periphery. Ref: Oral radiology White and Pharaoh; 7th ed.

These are the lines from David Sutton? - Some 40% of solitary pulmonary nodules are malignant with other common lesions being granulomas & benign tumors. - CT scan is most sensitive imaging modality available for identification of pulmonary nodules of. 3mm diameter but relatively insensitive to smaller nodules. The specificity for small nodules is also poor. - Spiral scanning has improved detection rate for pulmonary nodule but has not improved specificity. - The presence of calcification indicates benign lesion but 14% of carcinomas (malignant) show calcification. - The cavitation not necessarily indicates malignant lesion. So summary is, CT scan is most sensitive for detecting large pulmonary nodules ( 3mm) but neither sensitive nor specific for smaller nodules the maximum CT scan can show is calcification & cavitation, which are not always diagnostic of benign & malignant lesions respectively. So the best investigation to come to a diagnosis (i. e. most specific) will be Image guided biopsy.",

So Gadolinium enhanced MRIQ became definitive investigation for acoustic neuroma (vestibular shwanomma). Neuromas / Neurinomas / Neurolemmomas arise from Schwann cells which invest the cranial nerves; therefore they are more correctly called Schwannomas. They can arise from any cranial or spinal root except the optic and olfactory nerves, which are myelinated by oligodendroglia rather than Schwann cells. Schwannomas most frequently arise in eighth (VIII) cranial nerve and are known as vestibular or acoustic Schwannoma /Neuronia. 8th nerve tumor are the most common tumors affecting the petrous pyramid - as 80% arise within the internal auditory meatus (IAM), usually from vestibular nerve. Fifth (V) cranial nerve is the second most common site. Tumors arising from Vth (5), VIIth (7), XIth (11) or XII (12) cranial nerves may affect temporal bone. These are all very rare except in cases of neurofibromatosis (NF) type 2. Thin section T2 MRI is the standard investigation to demonstrate or exclude the presence of an acoustic neuroma. Vestibular Schwannomas are iso to hypo intense globular mass centered over IAC on T2 images and the enlargement of internal auditory canal is distinguishing feature that differentiates them from other cerebello pontine angle masses. However, gadolinium enhancement on T1 weighted images is usually used to confirm diagnosisQ. Gadolinium enhancement is also required in NF2, for follow UPS after paial or total removal of acoustic neuroma. Now, latest MRI scanners using either gradient-echo or spin- echo 3. DFT constructive interference in steady state (CISS) can produce thin section T2 images. Meningiomas are 2nd most common tumors arising in cerebello pontine angle. Unlike Schwannomas, meningiomas usually calcify & tend to have broad attachment to the petrous ridge, which may show characteristic hyperostosis. Meningiomas show intense contrast enhancement with gadolinium MRI (Gd. MR).",

Film handling under a safelight should be limited to about 5 minutes because film emulsion shows some sensitivity to light from a safelight with prolonged exposure. The older ML-2 filters (yellow light) are not appropriate for fast intraoral dental film or extraoral panoramic or cephalometric film.

It may disappear during severe neonatal infections, or after major surgery coicosteroid treatmentQ, but may reappear following recovery from illness. Thymus gland is completely absent in Di-George's syndrome, an immune deficiency disease involving T lymphocyes. It is seen as a triangular arrow head or bibbed structure in children and young adult patients on CT but undergoes fatty involution in adults & elderly. Enlargement of thymus gland can be d/t thymoma, thymic hyperplasia, thymic carcinoma, lymphoma, thymo lipoma, carcinoids & germ cell tumors & thymic cysts. Thymic Hyperplasia Although uncommn & rare, it is the most common anterior mediastinal mass in paeditric age group. The most common association of thymic hyperplasia is mysthenia gravis (65%) and thyrotoxicosis (eg Grave's disease, treatment of hypothyroidism etc. Other associations include Addison's disease, acromegaly, SLE, RA, and after stress atrophy, where the thymus gland initially atrophies in patients on chemotherapy, or coicosteroid treament, irradiation, stress, severe illness (burns) or after treatment for Cushing's disorder and then becomes larger than its previous normal size (i. e. enlarges) once the treatment is stopped or stress is ended. The phenomenon is called rebound thymic hyperplasia. It is differentiated from recurrent malignant disease on the basis of a known reason for rebound and presence of normal shaped enlarged thymus Rarely cause visible enlargement, but when it does, both lobes are enlarged, usually uniformly with a diffuse symmetrical enlargment. Radiological signs include. Wave sign is a rippled thymic contour (border) d/t indentation by anterior rib ends. Notch sign is indentation at the junction of thymus with hea. Sail sign is a triangular density projection from superior mediastinum on one or both sides. Shape change with respiration & position Thymoma It is the most common tumor of thymus in adults and most common primary tumor of anterior mdidastinum in adultsQ. Most (90%) thymomas arise in upper anterior mediastinum usually anterior to ascending aoa, lying on the right ventricle outflow tract and pulmonary aery. It is rare under 20, extremely unusual below 15 and usually presents at 50 year age (earlier in those who present with mysthenia gravis) Thymoma is often asymptomatic 50% but can also present with mysthenia; red cell aplasia, hypogammaglobulinemia. About 10-25% mysthenics have thymoma and 25-50% of thymoma patients have mysthenia gravis. It may cause mediastinal wideningQ and displacement of hea and great vessels posteriorly (but not trachea)-in benign cases; and can invade mediastinal fat & pleura in invasive malignant variety. It may be undetectable on chest x-ray when small, indicating the need of CT (which is investigation of choice & most sensitive). Thymomas give rise to asymmetrical focal swelling which appear as well defined round or oval soft tissue mass projecting to one side of anterior mediastinum. It may contain punctate or curvilinear calcification and areas of low attenuation d/t cystic degenration. MRI is also useful for diagnosis. Thymic Carcinoid It presents with cushing's syndrome (d/t ACTH serection), hyperparathyroidism and inappropriate ADH secretion.

This is done by examining how fast its atoms disintegrate and measuring their disintegration per second. Roentgen, on the other hand, is a radiation unit that indicates how much radiation is present in the air of a specific environment. This is used to show how much radiation may be absorbed by standing in a paicular place for a ceain amount of time. One roentgen of gamma- or X-ray exposure produces approximately 1 rad (0. 01 gray) tissue dose. More common than these two are the rad and the rem. These two units can measure any type of ionizing radiation, including alpha, beta, neutron, gamma and \"X, \" and deal with how much radiation is absorbed by objects. Rad stands for \"radiation absorbed dose. \" One rad equals 100 ergs (an energy unit) absorbed by 1 g of material. Rads are used to show how much radiation any object, especially things like metal and stone, has absorbed. Rem (dose equivalent)is a strictly biological measurement, and stands for \"roentgen equivalent man, \" meaning that it is the same essential measurement as a roentgen, only applied to the human body, although this works only with gamma and \"X\" types of radiation. Rem is used to define limits of exposure for people who work in nuclear power plants. Rem is often divided in millirems and assigned a length of time, such as millirems per hour.

SRS (Somatostatin receptor Scintigraphy) is now the imaging modality of choice for localizing both primary and metastatic NET tumorsQ. (except for Insulinoma)Q. Best modality of localizing Insulinoma is endoscopic WS. Somatostatin receptors are of 5 types, radiolabeled octreotide binds with highest affinity to SS2 receptor. SRS is not a diagnostic investigation. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting peptides or amines (or their metabolites) secreted by the tumors in urine or serum.",

        "exp": "C i. e. (Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN): (without any doubt) Bunch of grapes appearance with lobulated margins is highly suggestive (and characteristic) of serous cystadenoma. It is actually a cystic tumor with multiple tiny cyst (>6 in number))measuring < 2cm in size with a high stromal content seperated by thin septa lined by epithelial cell. Therefore these lesions appear solid owing to the compact arrangement of multiple small cyst forming myriad of (many) interfaces and produce finely lobulated microcystic lesion with internal septation producing classic cluster of grapes appearance. In mucinous cystadema the cysts are mostly large (average 10cm) unilocular or multilocular (<6) with a less prominent lobulation. Intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (IPMT) produce cystic appearance b/o dilated pancreatic ductal system distal to IPMT, so it is more like a distended ductal system covered by normal pancreatic parenchyma. So in mucinous cystadenoma cysts are much larger & lesser, whereas in IPMT there is no true microcystic pattern to produce almost solid bunch of grape appearance. Now lets focus on grossly dilated ductal'system which indicates total or near total ductal obstruction. All of them can 1/t ductal obstruction & gross dilatation the only difference is that it is almost always early, intraluminal with out obstructive ductal stricture, intense and communicating (i. e. cyst communicates with pancreatic duct) in IPMT, whereas it is b/o compression of duct from outside, in mucinous & serous cystadenoma (in which case it is gradual & non communicating). Serous cystodenoma occurs in females over age of 60 years (range 35-85yrs; F: M = 2/4: 1) whereas IPMN mainly occurs in males between 60 & 80 years.

        "exp": "Clinical Features KOTs usually have no symptoms, although mild swelling may occur. Pain may occur with secondary infection. Aspiration may reveal a thick, yellow, cheesy material (keratin). In contrast to cysts, KOTs have a high propensity for recurrence, possibly because of small satellite cysts or fragments of epithelium left behind after surgical removal of the cyst. Differential Diagnosis When in a pericoronal position, a KOT may be indistinguishable from a dentigerous cyst. The lesion is likely to be a KOT if the cystic outline is connected to the tooth at a point apical to the cementoenamel junction or if no expansion of the cortical plates has occurred. Also, although KOTs can develop occlusal to developing teeth, often the follicle of the involved tooth is not enlarged as in dentigerous cysts. The typical scalloped margin and multilocular appearance of the KOT may resemble an ameloblastoma, but the latter has a greater propensity to expand. Radiographic interpretation- As with cysts, KOTs usually show evidence of a cortical border, unless they have become secondarily infected. The cyst may have a smooth, round or oval shape identical to that of other cysts, or it may have a scalloped outline (a series of contiguous arcs).
