Source of alpha particle is nucleus. PropertyabgX-rays. Nature2. He4 or 2a4. Charge +2 mass 4 unit-2e=b. Charge = -1. Mass almost zero. 0g0. No charge no mass. Electromagnetic waves, no charge. Source. Nucleus. Consists of electron of nuclear origin. High frequency radiation having high. Kinetic energy. Produced when a beam of high speed cathode rays strike tungsten target. Penetrating power+++++++variable. Ionizing or damaging power10, 000 x100 xX-Frequency and wavelength are inversely related. Neutrons are uncharged particles with variable penetration power. Alpha particles are positively charged heavy particles with less penetrating power. X-rays are electromagnetic waves which are generated when a beam of high speed cathode rays strike the anode.",
