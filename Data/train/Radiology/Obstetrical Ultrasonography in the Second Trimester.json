Investigations used in H. moleultrasound* Snow storm appearance in uterus* Complete molar pregnancy (chorionic villi show diffuse hydropic swelling and absence of fetal shadow)* Some fetal tissue seen* For diagnostic purpose USG alone is adequate, hormonal assays are for post molar and post chemo follow up. Serum beta HCG* Very high in molar pregnancy* > 40000 detected by R1A* Rapidly increasing levels suggest molar pregnancy. Chest X-ray* To rule out lung metastasis.
