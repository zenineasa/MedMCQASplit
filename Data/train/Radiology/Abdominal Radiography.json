Finding seen on contrast studies using primarily barium. It is caused by severe spasm secondary to irritability of the loop producing the appearance of a frayed cotton string. At first, edema and spasm narrow the loop but the narrow ing is at least partially distensible. Eventually the wall of the ileum may become fibrotic and the lumen fixed in diameter. Imaging Findings. Persistently narrowed but potentially distensible terminal ileum. First sign of Crohn's ileitis is usually shallow aphthous ulcers. Short, linear ulcers along the mesenteric border may also be seen with Crohn's ileitis. Induration of the surrounding fat may cause the loop to be separated from the other small bowel loops (Proud loop)",

USG shows echogenic focus with posterior acoustic shadowing. The most specific sign of a contracted, stone filled gallbladder is a hypoechoic wall superficial to a curvilinear echo from the stones and an acoustic shadow. WES triad (Wall, Echo, Shadow) or the \"Double arc shadow sign\". Plane x-ray. Only 10% of gall stones are radio-opaque. Therefore, plane x-ray is of limited value. Oral cholecystogram (OCG) Dye used for OCG is ipanoic acid. Filling defect, due to stones, will be seen within the gall bladder. Cholangiogrant (outline of common bile duct) intravenous injection of biligrafin is given and frequent radiograph are taken as the liver excretes the biligrafin. Impacted stone in CBD classically shows cresentic shadow or meniscus sign on cholangiogram. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC): - This is a useful procedure in obstructive lesions. It is usually done as an immediate preoperative investigation. PTC can be used for drainage, cholangioplasty and stent placement.",

Alcoholism and gall stone are the most common causes of acute pancreatitis. o Radiological features of acute pancreatitis are: -1) Plain abdominal x-rayi) Air in the duodenal C-loopii) Senital loop sign: - A focal dilated proximal jejunal loop in the left upper quadrant. iii) Colon cut off sign: - Distention of the colon upto the transverse colon with a paucity of gas distal to the splenic flexure. iv) Gasless abdomen due to vomiting. v) Renal Halo sign: - Radiolucent sign about the left kidney. 2) Contrast enhanced computerized tomograpy (CECT) is now considered the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis and staging of acute pancreatitis due to its superb capacity for demonstrating early inflammatory changes, extrapancreatic fluid collections and panceatic necrosis. CT findings of acute pancreatitis are: -i) Focal or diffuse enlargement of the pancreas due to edema. ii) Irregular or shaggy (fuzzy) contour of pancreatic margins. iii) Heterogenous enhancement of the gland. iv) Blurring of peripancreatic fat planes with streaky soft tissue stranding densites. v) Thickening of fascial planes. vi) The presence of intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal fluid collection. The fluid collections most commonly are found in the peripancreatic and anterior pararenal spaces. B. Chronic pancreatitiso Chronic pancreatitis is chracterized by progressive pancreatic damage that eventually leads to impairment of both exocrine and endocrine functions of pancreas. Most common cause of chronic pancreatitis is alcoholism. o Radiological features of chronic pancreatitis. 1) Plain abdominal x-ray:- Calcification in pancreas is pathognomonic for chronic pancreatitis. Calcification primarily represents intraductal calculi. Calcification is punctate or coarse, and it may have a focal, segmental or diffuse distribution. 2) Upper gastrointestinal barium study: - Reverse 3 sign in duodenum (similar appearance may be seen in pancreatic carcinoma) due to traction on medial wall of the duodenum. The C loop of duodenum may be widened bacause of mass effect from an enlarged pancreatic head. 3) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): - ERCP is the investigation of choice for chronic pancreatitic. ERCP findings of chronic pancreatitis are: -i) Diffuse pancreatic duct dilatation. ii) Beaded appearance due to alternating dilatation and stenosis - \"Chain of lakes\" appearance or 'string of pearl' appearance or 'hourglass' appearance. iii) Rat tail stricture of CBD: - Long smooth narrowing of the CBD with graded tapering of the distal segment due to periductal fibrosis. iv) Small, round or oval, pancreatic parenchymal cavities. v) Intraluminal filling defects due to protein plugs or calculi.",

        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Endoscopy. REF: Harrison's 18th ed chapter 292. The most sensitive investigation for corrosive stricture is barium swallow, however best / investigation of choice is endoscopy. ENDOSCOPYEndoscopy, also known as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is the best test for the evaluation of the proximal gastrointestinal tract. Modern instruments produce high-quality color images of the esophageal, gastric, and duodenal lumen. Endoscopes also have an instrumentation channel through which biopsy forceps, sclerotherapy catheters, balloon dilators, or cautery devices can be utilized. The main disadvantage of endoscopy is that it usually necessitates the use of conscious sedation with medicines such as midazolam (Versed), meperidine (Demerol), or fentanyl. The key advantages of endoscopy over barium radiography are: Increased sensitivity for the detection of mucosal lesions. Vastly increased sensitivity for the detection of abnormalities mainly identifiable by an abnormal colour such as Barrett's metaplasia. The ability to obtain biopsy specimens for histologic examination of suspected abnormalities. The ability to dilate strictures during the examination. BARIUM STUDY: The sensitivity of barium radiography for detecting oesophageal strictures is greater than that of endoscopy, especially when the study is done in conjunction with barium-soaked bread or a 13-mm barium tablet. Barium studies also provide an assessment of oesophageal function and morphology that maybe undetected on endoscopy. Hypopharyngeal pathology and disorders of the cricopharyngeal muscle are better appreciated on radiographic examination, particularly with video fluoroscopic recording. The major shortcoming of barium radiography is that it rarely obviates the need for endoscopy Either a positive or a negative study is usually followed by an endoscopic evaluation either to clarify findings in the case of a positive examination or to add a level of certainty in the case of a negative one.",

Contrast enhanced CT is generally accepted as first line of investigation for suspected pancreatic cancer. In detection and staging of small tumors EUS (Endoscopic ultrasound) is reliable. EUS is used in the detection of tumors smaller than 2 cm. EUS has a high sensitivity and specificity for pancreatic cancer, with an overall staging accuracy higher than 80%. The possibility of performing EUS-guided FNA significantly improves both diagnostic and staging capability of EUSMRI appears to be more valuable for staging the extent and spread of pancreatic carcinoma than for tumor detection of lesions smaller than 2 cm. The degree of confidence with MRI is less than that with CT at the moment because of the wide variability in MRI techniques and its limitations from motion artifacts. PET scan is usually reserved, to confirm malignancy, to differentiate between carcinoma and a focal nodular pancreatitis and to recognize distant metastasis. In general, the sensitivity of PET is high in the detection of lesions more than a centimeter in diameter.",

Bubble sign is produced by distended part of GIT with air fluid level proximal to the obstruction: -In pyloric stenosis:-Only stomach is proximal to obstruction (pyloric region) and it becomes dilated with air fluid level - Single bubble sign. Duodenal atresia Stomach and duodenal cap are proximal to obstruction - Double-bubble sign (Two air fluid levels). In jejunal atresia: - Stomach, duodenal cap and duodenal loop are proximal to obstruction - Three air fluid levels, i. e., Tripple bubble sign.
