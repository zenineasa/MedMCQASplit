In the given X-ray, epiphyseal lytic lesion in tibia with a 'soap bubble' appearance is characteristic of osteoclastoma. The tumour always abuts against the joint margin in osteoclastoma.\"X-ray (Giant-cell Tumour): Radiolucent area situated eccentrically at the end of a long bone bounded by subchondral bone plate. The centre sometimes has a soap-bubble appearance due to ridging of the surrounding bone.

This can be done either as a frozen section before proceeding with operative treatment or (especially if a more extensive operation is contemplated) as a separate procedureQ.Treatment:Well-confined, slow-growing lesions with benign histology can safely be treated by thorough curettage & \"stripping\" of the cavity, followed by swabbing with hydrogen peroxide or by the application of liquid nitrogen.More aggressive tumours & recurrent lesions: Excision followed by bone grafting",
