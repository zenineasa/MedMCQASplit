Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is a pulse sequence used in magnetic resonance imaging which was invented by Dr. Graeme Bydder. FLAIR can be used with both three-dimensional imaging (3D FLAIR) and two dimensional imaging (2D FLAIR). The pulse sequence is an inversion recovery technique that nulls fluids. Structures with more water such as CSF or edema have long T1 and T2 relaxation times, resulting in higher signal intensity on T2-weighted images. T2 images are also more sensitive for detecting demyelination, infarction, and chronic hemorrhage. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) is a type of T2- weighted image that suppresses the high-intensity signal of CSF. As a result, images created by the FLAIR technique are more sensitive to detecting water- containing things/lesions.",
