The dye has to be injected constantly via a catheter, making it an invasive procedure.

Left atrial enlargement in 5 directions:(out of all 6 directions, inferior enlargement is not seen). It is believed left atrial appendage enlargement occur early. Left atrial Appendage enlargement is seen as fullness beneath the pulmonary artery shadow. It may be the earliest finding of Left atrial enlargement in X-ray. (This may appear as straight left heart border, as in classical mitral stenosis). The Left atrial appendage enlargementis not necessarily in proportion with left atrial enlargement. Left atrium could also enlarge posteriorly by pushing the esophagus towards the spine. This is visible only in barium swallow. Then LA can enlarge either to left or right (Usually towards right) and reach the right heart border or over shoot it and form the right heart border by itself. This occurs very late in the course. The other direction LA goes on to enlarge is superiorly. When LA enlarges superiorly it hits on the left main bronchus and lifts it. This is measured by the widened subcarinal angle which is normally less than 75 degrees. LA can enlarge anteriorly sometimes, but it is resisted by right ventricle but rarely right ventricle yields to the LA push and produces a left parasternal lift which could be mistaken for RV enlargement. Inferior enlargement cannot happen in a significant way as it is limited by the AV groove and strong fibrous skeleton. The upper limit of normal LA size is around 4. 5cm.",

In ASD, Chest x-ray shows an enlarged right atrium and right ventricle, and pulmonary artery and its branches; increased pulmonary vascular markings of left-to-right shunt vascularity will diminish if pulmonary vascular disease develops. ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT (ASD)# The three types of ASD include ostium secundum or fossa ovalis defect, sinus venosus defect, and endocardial cushion defects (ECD).# If the left to right shunt (ASD) produces a shunt ratio greater than 2: 1, the heart is obviously enlarged, involving RA and RV.# There is no enlargement of the LA, except in few cases of ECD or Lutembacher syndrome.# CXR:- The heart in ASD is sometimes displaced to left.- The ascending aorta and its arch tend to appear smaller than normal, probably due to the rotation of ascending aorta by enlarged RA and RV, causing sagittal alignment of the aortic arch (Small aortic knuckle).- The central pulmonary arteries are enlarged and there is a variable degree of pulmonary plethora, depending on the size of shunt.- Septal lines (Kerley B lines) in a patient of ASD should always suggest an associated mitral valve abnormality (ECD or Lutembacher syndrome).# More features:# The \"great hilar dance\" sign characterizes ASD on fluoroscopy.# The \"Goose-neck\" deformity is seen in ASD on cardioangiography.# Rx: Operative repair, usually with a patch of pericardium or of prosthetic material or percutaneous transcatheter device closure, if the ASD is of an appropriate size and shape, should be advised for all patients with uncomplicated secundum ASD with significant left-to-right shunting, i. e., pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratios 2: 1. Excellent results may be anticipated, at low risk, even in patients >40 years, in the absence of severe pulmonary hypertension.
