Venography (also called phlebography or ascending phlebography) is a procedure in which an x-ray of the veins, a venogram, is taken after a special dye is injected into the bone marrow or veins. The dye has to be injected constantly via a catheter, making it an invasive procedure. Normally the catheter is inserted by the groin and moved to the appropriate site by navigating through the vascular system. Contrast venography is the gold standard for judging diagnostic imaging methods for deep venous thrombosis; although, because of its cost, invasiveness, and other limitations this test is rarely performed",

Left atrial enlargement in 5 directions:(out of all 6 directions, inferior enlargement is not seen). It is believed left atrial appendage enlargement occur early. Left atrial Appendage enlargement is seen as fullness beneath the pulmonary artery shadow. It may be the earliest finding of Left atrial enlargement in X-ray. (This may appear as straight left heart border, as in classical mitral stenosis). The Left atrial appendage enlargementis not necessarily in proportion with left atrial enlargement. Left atrium could also enlarge posteriorly by pushing the esophagus towards the spine. This is visible only in barium swallow. Then LA can enlarge either to left or right (Usually towards right) and reach the right heart border or over shoot it and form the right heart border by itself. This occurs very late in the course. The other direction LA goes on to enlarge is superiorly. When LA enlarges superiorly it hits on the left main bronchus and lifts it. This is measured by the widened subcarinal angle which is normally less than 75 degrees. LA can enlarge anteriorly sometimes, but it is resisted by right ventricle but rarely right ventricle yields to the LA push and produces a left parasternal lift which could be mistaken for RV enlargement. Inferior enlargement cannot happen in a significant way as it is limited by the AV groove and strong fibrous skeleton. The upper limit of normal LA size is around 4. 5cm.",

The IVC diameter is a summary measure of cardiac function as well as a marker of venous congestion. Measurements of IVC collapse are commonly reported as the \"collapsibility index\" Q which is calculated as (maximum) IVC diameter on expiration - minimum IVC diameter on inspiration/maximum IVC diameter on expiration). Mean IVC diameter correlates with CVPQ.",
