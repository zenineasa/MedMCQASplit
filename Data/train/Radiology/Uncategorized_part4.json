Chemotherapy following radiotherapy Radiation recall phenomenon When patients are exposed to ceain chemotherapy agents a few weeks or months (or, rarely, even years) after completion of radiation treatment, some acute radiation reactions may re-occur. This phenomenon was first described by Dr. D'Angio, who observed skin reactions corresponding to the outline of radiation poals after use of dactinomycin (actinomycin D) a few months following completion of radiation treatment. This is an impoant issue when multimodality therapy is considered for cancer patients, and also the reason that some agents are avoided or used in reduced doses in the weeks and months after completion of radiation therapy. In addition to skin reactions, gastrointestinal and urinary reactions as well as radiation pneumonitis have also been repoed in association with this phenomenon. Some of the chemotherapy agents that have been repoed to cause radiation recall reactions include doxorubicin (adriamycin), dactinomycin, paclitaxel (taxol), and methotrexate.",

The most common type of gamma camera is the single-headed system. it consists of a gamma camera detector mounted on a gantry that allows the camera head to be positioned in a flexible way over different regions of the patient's body. Dual-headed gamma cameras are becoming increasingly popular. In these systems, two gamma camera heads are mounted onto the gantry.

        "exp": "Mass density The essential physics of medical imaging By Jerrold T. Bushberg 2/e p3. 56 writes? \"What do CT numbers correspond to physically in the patient? CT images are produced with a highly filtered, high-kV x-ray beam, with an average energy of about 75 keV. At this energy in muscle tissue, about 91% of x-ray interactions are Comptom scatter. For. fat and hone, Compton scattering interactions are 94% and 74%, respectively. Therefore, CT numbers and CT images derive their contrast mainly. from the physical propeies of tissue that influence Compton scatter. Density (g/cubic cm) is a very impoant discriminating propey of tissue, and the linear attenuation coefficient (p) tracks linearly with density. Other than physical density, the Compton scatter cross section depends on the electron density in tissue: Electron density = NZ/A where N is Avogadro's number (a constant) Z is the atomic number, A is the atomic mass The main constituents of soft tissue are hydrogen (Z = 1, A = 1), carbon (Z = 6, A = 12), nitrogen (Z = 7, A = 14), and oxygen (Z = 8, A = 16). Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen all have the WA ratio of 0. 5, so their electron densities are the same. Because the Z/A ratio. for hydrogen is 1. 0, the relative abundance of hydrogen in a tissue has some influence on CT number. Hydrogenous tissue such as fat is well visualized on CT Neveheless, density (g/cubic cm) plays the dominant role in forming contrast in medical CT. \" \"The difference in electron density of tissues depends upon physical density. Therefore, the soft tissue contrast achieved in an image is primarily determined by the relative physical densities of the structures, not by the relative differences in atomic numbers. \"- Neuroimaging By Robe A. Zimmerman, Wendell A. Gibby, Raymond F. Carmody P5 CT is a tomographic imaging technique that generates cross-sectional images in the axial plane. The basic concept of x-ray CT is simple. By looking at an object from multiple directions a three dimensional representation of that object can be formed. A thin beam of x-rays is passed through the body from multiple different projections. When an x-ray beam passes through the body, there is a logarithmic attenuation of its intensity over distance. A measurement of the intensity of the exiting beam is known as the linear attenuation coefficient when the attenuator thickness is 1 cm. The linear attenuation coefficient is related to the absorption of a given material both photoelectric interaction and Comptom scattering interactions. This, of course, depends upon the energy of the x-ray beam and the type of material being irradiated. CT images are maps of the relative linear attenuation coefficient of tissues. The relative attenuation coefficient is normally expressed in Hounsfield units (HU), also known as CT numbers (Named in honor of the inventor of CT, Geoffrey Hounsfield). The HU of material Xis HU = 1000 X (14-14)/1. 1.,,., where x, is the attenuation coefficient of the material X, and ix,. is the attenuation coefficient of water. By definition, the HU value for water is always zero. HU value for air is -1000 ( minus 1000) HU value for coical bone is 1000",

        "question": "Consolidation of which poion of the lung is likely to obliterate the Aoic knuckle on X-ray chest:",
        "exp": "D i. e. Left upper lobe (posterior pa) - Consolidation of apical poion of left upper lobe (LUL) will obliterate or obscure the aoic knuckle (knob) poion of cardiac shadow on chest x-ray (Mnemonic-LUL sounds like Knuckle\") * - Consolidation of lingula (anterior) obscures left hea border (i. e. left cardiac silhouette) and consolidation of righ middle lobe (RML) obliterates right hea border (right cardiac sihoutte). Mn= \"Lingula is left and RML is right\". Radiographic Mediastinal Signs Silhouette's (Obscured Margin) Sign - The normal radio-opaque margins of soft tissue mediastinal structures (such as hea, aoic arch, hilum, azygoesophageal recesses) and diaphragm are visible on chest x-ray because they are outlined by adjacent air containing radiolucent lung (i. e. b/o normal soft tissue air inteface/contrast). -Silhouette (obscured margin) sign is based on the principle, which says that if two structures have approximately the same radiographic density, and are in intimate contact with each other, then the interface between them is obliterated\". However, if there is even a small gap between them, then they are seen with their borders as separate entities. An intrathoracic lesion touching a border of hea, aoa or diaphragm and having similar radiographic density (opacity) will obliterate that border on X-ray. And a lesion not anatomically contigious with a border of these structures or having markedly dissimilar density will not obliterate that border. - Silhouette's invisible or obscured border sign is caused by any intrathoracic opacity eg consolidation, pneumonia, mass, fluid, atelectasia of same density as the adjacent normal structure. This sign is used to diagnose variety of lung/chest conditions and to localize it to a specific lobe /region of lung. Silhoutte sign is very useful in localizing lung lesions as all structures forming cardiac silhoutte (hea border, ascending descending aoa, aoic knob & hemidiaphragm) are in contact with a specific poion of lung. Silhoutte structure (which may be obscured by pathology) Lung lobe/poion in contact Upper right hea border (Superior RUL (Right upper lobe, anterior vena cava), Ascending aoa & Upper pole of hilum = Superior right mediastinum or Right Aoic border segment) & anterior segment of RML Right hea border/Right cardiac RML (Right middle lobe, medial) sithoutte >>> Right medial lower lobe Aoic knudcle/knob/arch LUL (Left upper lobe apico-posterior segment) Upper left hea border (left superior LUL (Left upper lobe anterior mediastinum) segment) Left hea border (Left cardiac silhoutte) Lingula (anterior) segment of LUL Anterior hemidiaphragm Lower lobe (anterior- basal segments) Position of oblique fissure is best index of lower lobe volume. Left hemidiaphragm, Descending aoa Left lower lobe (LL) Right hemidiaphragm Right lower lobe (RLL) - Obscuration of right hea border (right cardiac silhouette) on PA viewQ and movement of horizontal fissure and lower half of oblique fissure toward one another on lateral projection is diagnostic of right middle lobe collapse. With the exception of absence of horizontal fissure on left, radiological features of lingual collapse are similar to right middle lobe collapse. - In right upper lobe collapse, lateral end of horizontal fissure moves upward & medially (towards superior mediastinum) & its anterior end moves upward towards apex. And the upper half of oblique fissure moves anteriorly. Both fissures become concave superiorly. Cervico-Thoracic Sign It is based on the fact that upper most border anterior mediastinum ends at the level of clavicle while middle (higher) & posterior (highest) mediastinum projects above clavicle. Therefore, a well defined mass (which is sharply outlined by apical lung) above the clavicles is always posterior, whereas an anterior mass being in contact with soft tissues (of same density) rather than aerated lung, is ill defined (have unsharp borders) Hilar-Overlay Sign - It allows differentiation of true cardiomegaly from large anterior mediastinal masses. In cardiomegaly the hilum is displaced laterally whereas in the presence of anterior mediastinal mass the hilum is seen projecting medial to the lateral border of mass. With the mediastinal mass, the hilium is seen through the mass whereas with cardiomegaly the hilum is displaced so that only its lateral border is visible. Hilar Bifurcation (Convergence) Sign - It differentiates hilar masses from vascular structures in cases of hilar enlargment. - If the vessels (eg pulmonary aeries) are seen to arise directly from the hilar shadow (i. e. vessels converge into lateral border of cardiac silhoutte) then the enlargement is vascular, but if they appear to arise medial to the lateral aspect of the hilar shadow, the enlargment is caused by an extravascular mass.",

In gated radiotherapy, beam is turned on only during a ceain phase of respiratory cycle, generally at the end of expiration.

Advantage of this technique is that, it decreases the internal target volume and reduce the volume of normal tissue that is irradiated. Disadvantage of this approach is prolonged treatment time and lack of direct imaging of tumor position during treatment. Ref: Lung Cancer By Kemp H.

Diagnostic criteria: peak <80meq/L Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio pancreaticography (ERCP) DC: Cambridge III, dilated main pancreatic duct & >3 dilated side branch Acute Pancreatitis Any severe acute pain in abdomen or back should suggest the possibility of acute pancreatitis. Abdominal pain, is the major symptom of acute pancreatitis characteristically, the pain which is steady & boring in character, is located in epigastrium & periumbilical regionQ and often radiates to the backQ as well as to the chest, flank & lower abdomen. The patient often obtains relief by sitting with the trunk flexed and knees drawn upQ. When a patient with possible predisposition to pancreatitis (such as gall stone, alcoholism, ERCP, hyperigyceridemia, trauma, surgery and drugs like azathioprine, sulfonamides, estrogen, tetracycline, valproic acid, 6-merceptopurine & anti HIV drugs) presents with severe & constant abdominal pain frequently a/w nausea, fever, emesis, tachycardia, leukocytosis, hypocalcemia and hyperglycemia, the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is usually enteained. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires 2 of the following: typical abdominal pain, 3 fold or greater increase in serum amylase &/or lipase (which usually establishes/clinch the diagnosis if gut perforation, ischemia or infraction are excluded, however, levels does not indicate the severity) and confirmatory findings on cross sectional abdominal imaging. A CTscan can confirm the diagnosis of acute pancreatitisQ even with less than a 3 fold increase in serum amylase and lipase levels. It also indicates severity of disease, risk of morbidity and moality and evaluates complication of acute pancreatitis. However, a CTscan within 3-5 days of symptom onset may underestimate the extent of tissue injury (hence repeated again).

It also reduces patient exposure by absorbing some of the residual X-ray beam. Most importantly, if the film packet is placed backward in the patient's mouth so that the tube side of the film is facing away from the x-ray machine, the lead foil will be positioned between the subject and the film. In this circumstance, most of the radiation is absorbed by the lead foil, and the resulting radiograph is light and shows the embossed pattern in the lead foil.

High energy cyclotron accelerates proton, deutron & a paicles producing high energy proton beams or fast neutronsQ. In linear accelerator, electrons are accelerated in straight line to high energy & are allowed to exit the machine as electron beam (for treatment of superficial cancers eg mycosis funguidesQ as paicle therapy) or are directed to a target to produce high energy (megavoltage) bremsstrahlung X-rays (to treat deep seated tumors). Betatron & Van de Graff accelerator also accelerate electrons. Cyclotron can accelerate proton, dentron and alpha paicles spirally to 35 MeV energy and can generate proton & neutrons beamsQ and other high energy charged paicles Gamma rays (y) photons are generated from decay of atomic nuclei of radioisotopes such as Cobalt & radium. X-Rays was first produced by Rontgen in 1895. Now a days X-Rays are produced by cooling tube. X Rays are produced when fast moving stream of electron produced by cathodeQ (negative charged tungsten filament) strikes the anodeQ (positive charged tungsten or molybdenum containing copper block). Scattering depends on Electron/Nucleus ratio. X-Ray is most scattered by H+ionQ. The period when fetus is most sensitive to radiation is 8-15 weeks of gestationsQ. X RaysQ & Gamma raysQ are the forms of radiation most commonly used to treat cancer. Xrays (generated by linear accelerator) and gamma rays (generated by decay of atomic nuclei of radio isotopes) are both electromagnetic, non-paiculate, non charged, zero mass, packets of energy (photons) waves that cause ejection of an orbital electron when absorbed (i. e. ionization) and kill-tumor cells by producing double strand breaks in DNA (direct) or free radicle production (indirect). Paiculate forms of radiation are also use in ceain circumstances. Total skin electron treatment (TSET) which is similar to total body irradiation (TBI) except that electrons are used instead of photons. TSET have a very low tissue penetration and are used to treat skin cancer such as mycosis fungoidesQ.

After clinical examination, scaphoid injury was suspected. A radiograph of the left wrist was obtained and found to be equivocal. What is the best next step?",
        "exp": "If initial imaging fails to show a fracture, the hand or wrist is often put in a cast before any fuher imaging, with the presumption that there is a fracture (presumptive casting). The British college recommends magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the second line approach, with bone scintigraphy and computed tomography as alternatives. The US college ors MRI or presumptive casting with repeat radiography to detect subsequently formed fracture lines; it also suggests computed tomography as a third line option. Scaphoid fractures should be suspected with trauma involving the hand and/or wrist, paicularly falls onto an outstretched hand and road traffic incidents. Such fractures most commonly occur among men aged 20-30 years, with about 10% presenting with an associated fracture. Less than 20% of patients with a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture have a true fracture. First step: Radiography of wrist, including at least a posteroanterior, lateral, and semi-pronated oblique. The ACR recommends the inclusion of a fouh view: a posteroanterior projection with ulnar detion and/or cephalad tube angulation (scaphoid view) if a scaphoid fracture is suspected.

The applications of scintigraphy include early drug development and nuclear medical imaging to view and analyse images of the human body or the distribution of medically injected, inhaled, or ingested radionuclides emitting gamma rays. Scintigraphy is the use of gamma cameras to capture emitted radiation from internal radioisotopes to create twodimensional images. SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) imaging, as used in nuclear cardiac stress testing, is performed using gamma cameras, usually one, two or three detectors or heads, are slowly rotated around the patient's torso. Multiheaded gamma cameras can also be used for Positron emission tomography scanning. Gamma camera PET is markedly inferior to PET imaging with a purpose designed PET scanner, as the scintillator crystal has poor sensitivity for the high-energy annihilation photons, and the detector area is significantly smaller. However, given the low cost of a gamma camera and its additional flexibility compared to a dedicated PET scanner, this technique is useful where the expense and resource implications of a PET scanner cannot be justified.",

Occasionally, the boundary between normal bone and the lesion can appear sharp and even corticated, especially in young lesions. The abnormal trabeculae usually are shorter, thinner, irregularly shaped, and more numerous than normal trabeculae. This creates a radiopaque pattern that can vary; it may have a granular appearance (or ground-glass appearance, resembling the small fragments of a shattered windshield), a pattern resembling the surface of an orange (peau d'orange), a wispy arrangement (cotton wool), or an amorphous, dense pattern. A distinctive characteristic is the organization of the abnormal trabeculae into a swirling pattern similar to a fingerprint. Occasionally, radiolucent regions resembling cysts may occur in mature lesions of fibrous dysplasia. These are bone cavities that are analogous to simple bone cysts and occur more commonly in mandibular lesions. If the fibrous dysplasia increases the bone density, the periodontal ligament space may appear to be very narrow. Fibrous dysplasia can displace teeth or interfere with normal eruption, complicating orthodontic therapy. In rare cases, some root resorption may occur. Involved teeth may have hypercementosis. Fibrous dysplasia appears to be unique in its ability to displace the inferior alveolar nerve canal in a superior direction.

        "question": "Panoramic radiograph is used to detect radiological abnormalities of all of the following, except:",
        "exp": "Panoramic images are most useful clinically for diagnostic problems requiring broad coverage of the jaw. Common examples include evaluation of trauma including jaw fractures, location of third molars, extensive dental or osseous disease, known or suspected large lesions, tooth development and eruption (especially in the mixed dentition), retained teeth or root tips (in edentulous patients), temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, and developmental anomalies. Panoramic imaging is often used as the initial evaluation image that can provide the required insight or assist in determining the need for other projections. Panoramic images are also useful for patients who do not tolerate intraoral procedures well. The main disadvantage of panoramic radiology is that the image does not display the fine anatomic detail available on intraoral periapical radiographs. Thus, it is not as useful as periapical radiography for detecting small carious lesions, the fine structure of the marginal periodontium, or periapical disease. The proximal surfaces of premolars also typically overlap. The availability of a panoramic radiograph for an adult patient often does not preclude the need for intraoral films for the diagnosis of most commonly encountered dental diseases. When a full-mouth series of radiographs is available for a patient requiring only general dental care, typically little or no additional useful information is gained from a simultaneous panoramic examination. Other problems associated with panoramic radiography include unequal magnification and geometric distortion across the image. Occasionally, the presence of overlapping structures, such as the cervical spine, can hide odontogenic lesions, particularly in the incisor regions. Clinically, important objects may be situated outside the focal trough and may appear distorted or not be seen at all.

MR images of the soft-tissue structures of the body -- such as the hea, liver and many other organs -- is more likely in some instances to identify and accurately characterize diseases than other imaging methods. This detail makes MRI an invaluable tool in early diagnosis and evaluation of many focal lesions and tumors. MRI has proven valuable in diagnosing a broad range of conditions, including cancer, hea and vascular disease, and muscular and bone abnormalities. MRI enables the discovery of abnormalities that might be obscured by bone with other imaging methods. MRI allows physicians to assess the biliary system noninvasively and without contrast injection. The contrast material used in MRI exams is less likely to produce an allergic reaction than the iodine-based contrast materials used for conventional x-rays and CT scanning. MRI provides a noninvasive alternative to x-ray, angiography and CT for diagnosing problems of the hea and blood vessels.",

To make the darkroom lightproof, a light-tight door or doorless maze (if space permits) is used. SAFELIGHTING The processing room should have both white illumination and safelighting. Safelighting is low-intensity illumination of relatively long wavelength (red) that does not rapidly affect open film but permits one to see well enough to work in the area. To minimize the fogging effect of prolonged exposure, the safelight should have a frosted 15-watt bulb or a clear 7. 5-watt bulb and should be mounted at least 4 feet above the surface where opened films are handled. X-ray films are very sensitive to the blue-green region of the spectrum and are less sensitive to red wavelengths. The red GBX-2 filter is recommended as a safelight in darkrooms where either intraoral or extraoral films are handled because this filter transmits light only at the red end of the spectrum. Film handling under a safelight should be limited to about 5 minutes because film emulsion shows some sensitivity to light from a safelight with prolonged exposure. The older ML-2 filters (yellow light) are not appropriate for fast intraoral dental film or extraoral panoramic or cephalometric film.

On intraoral examination, marked swelling is seen in the region of palatine papilla, situated mesial to the roots of 11 & 21. These teeth respond normally to vitality test. IOPA is given below. What is the most probable diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Clinical feature The age distribution is broad, with most cases being discovered in the fourth through sixth decades. The incidence is three times higher in males. Most of these cysts are asymptomatic or cause such minor symptoms that they are tolerated for long periods. The most frequent complaint is a small, well-defined swelling just posterior to the palatine papilla. This swelling usually is fluctuant and blue if the cyst is near the surface. The deeper nasopalatine duct cyst is covered by normal-appearing mucosa, unless it is ulcerated from masticatory trauma. If the cyst expands, it may penetrate the labial plate and produce a swelling below the maxillary labial frenum or to one side. The lesion also may bulge into the nasal cavity and distort the nasal septum. Pressure from the cyst on the adjacent nasopalatine nerves that occupy the same canal may cause a burning sensation or numbness over. Differential Diagnosis The most common differential diagnosis is a large incisive foramen. A foramen larger than 6 mm may simulate the appearance of a cyst. However, a clinical examination should reveal the expansion. A radicular cyst or granuloma associated with a central incisor is similar in appearance to an asymmetric nasopalatine cyst. The presence or absence of the lamina dura and enlargement of the periodontal ligament space around the apex of the central incisor indicate an inflammatory lesion. A vitality test of the central incisor may be useful. characteristic of a cyst and other changes that occur with a space-occupying lesion, such as displacement of teeth.

        "exp": "The bisecting-angle technique is based on a simple geometric theorem, Cieszynski's rule of isometry, which states that two triangles are equal when they share one complete side and have two equal angles. Dental radiography applies the theorem as follows. The receptor is positioned as close as possible to the lingual surface of the teeth, resting in the palate or on the floor of the mouth. The plane of the receptor and the long axis of the teeth form an angle with its apex at the point, where the receptor is in contact with the teeth along an imaginary line that bisects this angle and directs the central ray of the beam at right angles to this bisector. This forms two triangles with two equal angles and a common side (the imaginary bisector). Consequently, when these conditions are satisfied, the images cast on the receptor theoretically are the same length as the projected object. To reproduce the length of each root of a multirooted tooth accurately, the central beam must be angled differently for each root. Ref: ORAL RADIOLOGY Principles and Interpretation, Stuart C.

        "exp": "Ultrasonography is the most useful radiologic test for diagnosing acute cholecystitis. It has a sensitivity and specificity of 95%. In addition to being a sensitive test for documenting the presence or absence of stones, it will show the thickening of the gallbladder wall and the pericholecystic fluid. Focal tenderness over the gallbladder when compressed by the sonographic probe (sonographic Murphy's sign) also is suggestive of acute cholecystitis. Biliary radionuclide scanning (HIDA scan) may be of help in the atypical case. Lack of filling of the gallbladder after 4 hours indicates an obstructed cystic duct and, in the clinical setting of acute cholecystitis, is highly sensitive and specific for acute cholecystitis.

        "question": "Which of the following statements about contrast in radiography is true:",
        "exp": "A i. e. Ionic monomers have three iodine atoms per two paicles in solution Ionic contrast agents dissociate (ionize) in water in 2 ioins (or osmotic paicles) per molecule whereas nonionic agents do not ionize or dissociate. All monomers contain I benzene ring with 3 iodine atoms and dimers contains 2 benzene rings with 6 iodine atoms per molecule. Therefore ionic monomers have 3 iodine atoms per 2 ionic/ osmotic paicles in solutionQ and a contrast agent ratio of 3: 2 (i. e. 1. 5). And ionic dimers have 6 iodine atoms per 2 ionic/osmotic paicles in solution with a contrast agent ratio of 6: 2 or 3: 1. Nonionic agents donot ionize so they have only 1 osmotic paicle per molecule. And similarly monomers contain 3 iodine atom and dimers contain 6 iodine atoms per molecule of contrast agent. Therefore contrast agent ratio of nonionic monomers is 3: 1 and nonionic dimers is 6: 1. High osmolar contrast agents (HOCM) are all ionic monomersQ; whereas low osmolar contrast agents (LOCM) may be ionic dimers, and nonionic monomers or dimers (i. e. both ionic & nonionic)Q. HOCM have osmolality in range of 1500 mosmols/kg water at concentrations of 300 mg I2/ml. Whereas LOCM have osmolality which is less than half of the osmolality of HOCM (i. e. 600-700 for nonionic monomer, 560 for ionic dimer and 300 for nonionic dimer). So compred to physiological osmolality of 300 mosmols/kg water, nonionic dimers are physiologically isotonic in solution at 300 mg iodine/ml. Normal plasma osmollity is 300 mosmols/kg water at iodine concentration of 300mg/ml. So LOCM means that osmolality is lower than the HOCM (not physiological). Lowest osmolality/osmolarity is seen in non ionic dimer agents which becomes almost physiologically isotonic or iso-osmolarQ (visipaque 320 is 290 mosmol/kg and isovist 300 is 320 mosmol/kg. H2O; 320 & 300 are iodine concentrations). Osmolality is propoional to the ratio of iodine atoms to the number of paicles in solution. The contrast agent with lower ratio (3: 2) are HOCM and they have more paicles in solution per iodine atom (or in other words less iodine atoms per paicle). And agents with higher ratio (3: 1 or 6: 2 and 6: 1) are LOCM. Iohexol (omnipaque) is a nonionic monomer (LOCM with 3: 1 ratio)Q Iodinated contrast agents have low lipid solubility, low toxicity, low binding affinities for protein, receptor or membranes, low moleculer wt & are very hydrophilic. On iv injection b/o high capillary permeability they all are distributed rapidly into extravascular, extracellular interstitial space (except in CNS)Q but do not enter blood or tissue cells. Pharmacokinetics of all extracellular MRI contrast agents (all gadolinium except Gd-BOPTA) are similar to iodinated water soluble contrast media. They donot cross the blood brain barrier unless the barrier is disruptedQ. These agents accumulate in tissues with abnormal vascularity (inflammation & malignancy) and in regions where BBB is disrupted.",

        "question": "Which of the following is a harmful: March 2009",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Alpha Paicle The radiation one typically encounters is one of four types: alpha radiation, beta radiation, gamma radiation, and X-radiation. Neutron radiation is also encountered in nuclear power plants and high-altitude flight and emitted from some industrial radioactive sources. A Alpha radiation is a heavy, very sho-range paicle and is actually an ejected helium nucleus. Some characteristics of alpha radiation are: Most alpha radiation is not able to penetrate human skin. Alpha-emitting materials can be harmful to humans if the materials are inhaled, swallowed, or absorbed through open wounds. A thin-window Geiger-Mueller (GM) probe can detect the presence of alpha radiation. Instruments cannot detect alpha radiation through even a thin layer of water, dust, paper, or other material, because alpha radiation is not penetrating. Alpha radiation travels only a sho distance (a few inches) in air, but is not an external hazard. Alpha radiation is not able to penetrate clothing. Examples of some alpha emitters: radium, radon, uranium, thorium. Alpha paicle has poor penetration but maximum ionizing power and is most damaging. B. Beta radiation is a light, sho-range paicle and is actually an ejected electron. Some characteristics of beta radiation are: Beta radiation may travel several feet in air and is moderately penetrating. Beta radiation can penetrate human skin to the \"germinal layer, \" where new skin cells are produced. If high levels of beta-emitting contaminants are allowed to remain on the skin for a prolonged period of time, they may cause skin injury. Beta-emitting contaminants may be harmful if deposited internally. Most beta emitters can be detected with a survey instrument and a thin-window GM probe (e. g., \"pancake\" type). Examples of these difficult-to-detect beta emitters are hydrogen-3 (tritium), carbon-14, and sulfur-35. Clothing provides some protection against beta radiation. Examples of some pure beta emitters: strontium-90, carbon-14, tritium, and sulfur-35. Beta paicle has moderate penetration, moderate ionizing power and is moderate damaging. C. Gamma radiation and X-rays are highly penetrating electromagnetic radiation. Some characteristics of these radiations are: Gamma radiation or X-rays are able to travel many feet in air and many inches in human tissue. They readily penetrate most materials and are sometimes called \"penetrating\" radiation. X-rays are like gamma rays. X-rays, too, are penetrating radiation. Sealed radioactive sources and machines that emit gamma radiation and X-rays respectively constitute mainly an external hazard to humans. Gamma radiation and X-rays are electromagnetic radiation like visible light, radiowaves, and ultraviolet light. Dense materials are needed for shielding from gamma radiation. Clothing provides little shielding from penetrating radiation, but will prevent contamination of the skin by gamma-emitting radioactive materials. Gamma radiation is easily detected by survey meters with a sodium iodide detector probe. Gamma radiation and/or characteristic x rays frequently accompany the emission of alpha and beta radiation during radioactive decay. Examples of some gamma emitters: iodine-131, cesium-137, cobalt-60, radium-226, and technetium-99m. Gamma paicle are most penetrating, minimum ionizing power and is least damaging",

MRI Vascular Rings Vascular rings is a condition in which an anomalous configuration of the arch and /or its associated vessels completely or incompletely surrounds the trachea & oesophagus causing compression of these structures. Neonates present with respiratory distress and older children present with stridor or dysphagia. Fouh developmental arch is most impoant. The two most common types of complete vascular rings, which account for 85-95% of cases are double aoic arch and right aoic arch with left ligamentum aeriosum Chest x-ray is the first & most commonly performed investigation. The identification of right aoic arch or ill defined arch location and compression of trachea in symptomatic child indicate the diagnosis. Many authorities consider barium oesophagoscopy to be the most impoant study in patients with suspected vascular ring and it is diagnostic in vast majority of cases. - A double aoic arch produce bilateral & posterior compression of oesophagus, which remain constant regardless of peristalsis. The right indentation is usually slightly higher than left and posterior one is usually wide & course in a downward direction from right to left. Right subclan aery takes a retrooesophageal course, there is a posterior defect slanting upward from left to right. The posterior defect is less broad than in double aoic arch. Echocardiography can be used but structures without lumen such as ligamentum aeriosum or an atretic arch are difficult to be identified. Plain x-ray & barium swallow can not reliably distinguish among the types of vascular rings. Cross section images by CT, MRI and digital substraction angiography (DSA) can be useful diagnostic tool in delineating the anatomy and aiding in presurgical planning & post surgical assessment. MR angiography (MRA) is an excellent substitute for DSA but young patients may require general anesthesia & where there is already airway compromise, this should be avoided. MRI is preferred as it is non invasive and avoids radiation riskQ. Multidetector CT is rarely used b/o radiation implication. Angiography (an invasive method) is rarely required unless cardiac catheterization is necessary for investigation of associated cardiac anomalies and if MRI is equivocal (same protocol applies for coarctation of aoa i. e.

Cervical burnout produces an artifact that mimics a carious lesion near the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) area of the tooth. As the X-ray beam meets the convex proximal surface of the tooth, those X-ray photons that pass almost tangentially through the tooth surface \"see\" less tooth structure than those photons that pass deeper through the tooth. This area of convexity is commonly located apical to the CEJ, near the normal height of the alveolar crest. The thinner tooth structure here absorbs fewer X-rays; consequently the area appears relatively more radiolucent on an image. Cervical burnout can also be seen in multirooted teeth, when roots that are more buccally positioned do not overlap perfectly with a lingual or palatal root in a mesiodistal direction. The presence of a shallow furcation on either the mesial or distal surface of the tooth can make the area appear more radiolucent. However, the presence of two overlapping roots can be confirmed by identifying the periodontal ligament spaces of each root.",

        "question": "All of the following are advantages of paralleling technique except:",

Accuracy: The paralleling technique produces an image that has dimensional accuracy (A profile view of the tooth with buccal and lingual roots projected in their normal respective lengths as buccal and lingual cusps correctly related on the same plane); the image is very representative of the actual tooth. The radiographic image is free of distortion and exhibits maximum details and definition. There is no overlap of related structures (eg. the zygomatic shadow), all shadows of anatomical structures are cast in their proper anatomic position. This accuracy is due to: Increased source film distance. Object and film are parallel to each other. Central ray strikes perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth and film. Though the object film distance is increased, it is compensated by increased source film distance and therefore, there is decreased enlargement. The increased k. Vp, to reduce exposure time, as the source film distance is increased, helps by reducing secondary and unwanted, short wavelength radiations. 2. Simplicity: This technique is simple and easy to learn and use. The film holder with a beam alignment device eliminates the need for all dental surgeons to determine horizontal and vertical angulations and also eliminates chances of dimensional distortion and coning off. 3. Duplication: This technique is easy to standardize and can be accurately duplicated or repeated, when serial radiographs are indicated. As a result, comparison of serial radiographs exposed using this technique have great validity. 4. Facial screens can be used. 5. There is decreased secondary radiation. 6. The radiographs produced give, An excellent bone level assessment. No elongation or foreshortening seen in the periapical region. Interproximal caries is clearly indicated. 7. The shadow of the zygomatic bone appears above the apices of the molar teeth. 8. The periodontal bone levels are well represented. 9.
