        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Technetium-99m linked to Methylene disphosphonate (99m. Tc-MDP) o Tc 99 is the most common radiopharmaceutical used for imaging in nuclear medicine. For skeletal imaging Diphosphonate Ligands are used as these agents are deposited on sites of actively growing bone. The diphosphonate ligand has a high affinity for actively growing bone. 99. Tc-MDP is the most widely used of the diphosphonate ligands- Bone Scintigraphy. Radiopharmaceutical. Primary use. Tc-99m Medronate (MDP) (most common). Bone imaging. Tc-99m Oxidronate (HMDP).

        "exp": "Ans: B (To image radioactivity emitted from organs) Ref: Clinical Nuclear Medicine by Biersack, pg: 13. Explanation: Gamma Camera (Aka Scintillation Camera or Anger Camera). It is used to image gamma radiation emitting radioisotopes. This technique is known as scintigraph. Gamma camera is able to detect and make images from the very small amounts of ionising radiation emitted from patients having a nudear medicine study. The gamma camera detects radioactive energy that is emitted from the patient's body and converts it into an image. The gamma camera does not emit any radiation. The gamma camera is composed of radiation detectors, called gamma camera heads. The most common type of gamma camera is the singleheaded system. it consists of a gamma camera detector mounted on a gantry that allows the camera head to be positioned in a flexible way over different regions of the patient's body. Dual-headed gamma cameras are becoming increasingly popular. In these systems, two gamma camera heads are mounted onto the gantry. Also Note: SPECT involves the rotation of the gamma camera heads around the patient's body to produce more detailed, three-dimensional images.",
