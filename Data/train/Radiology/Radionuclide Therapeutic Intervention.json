        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., Technetium-99m linked to Methylene disphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) o Tc 99 is the most common radiopharmaceutical used for imaging in nuclear medicine. For skeletal imaging Diphosphonate Ligands are used as these agents are deposited on sites of actively growing bone. The diphosphonate ligand has a high affinity for actively growing bone. 99Tc-MDP is the most widely used of the diphosphonate ligands- Bone Scintigraphy.RadiopharmaceuticalPrimary useTc-99m Medronate (MDP) (most common)Bone imagingTc-99m Oxidronate (HMDP)Bone imagingTc-99m HEDPBone imagingTc-99m ApcitidePeptide imaging of DVTTc-99m ArcitumomabMonoclonal antibody for colorectal cancerTc-99m albumin colloidImaging of RES (liver/spleen)Tc-99m bicisate (ECD)Cerebral perfusion imagingTc-99m DepreotideSomatostatin receptor-bearing pulmonary massesTc-99m disofenin (DISJDA)Hepatobiliary imagingTc-99m exametazine (HMPAO)Cerebral perfusion imagingTc-99m GluceptateRenal imagingTc-99m Human Serum Albumin (HSA)Imaging of cardiac chambersTc-99m Lidofenin (HIDA)Hepatobiliary imagingTc-99m Macroaggregated Albumin (MAA)Pulmonary perfusionTc-99m MebrofeninHepatobiliary imagingTc-99m MertiatideRenal imagingTc-99m nofetumomab Merpentan NR-LU-10Monoclonal antibody Fab fragment for imaging small cell lung cancerTc-99m Pentetate (DTPA)Renal imaging and function studies; radioaerosol ventilation imagingTc-99m Pyrophosphate (PYP)Avid infarct imagingTc-99m Red Blood Cells (RBCs)Imaging of GI bleeds, cardiac chambersTc-99m SestamibiMyocardial perfusion imaging ; breast tumor imagingTc-99m Succimer (DMSA)Renal imagingTc-99m Sulfur Colloid (SC)Imaging of RES (liver/spleen), gastric emptying, GI bleedsTc-99m TeboroximeMyocardial perfusion imagingTc-99m TetrofosminMyocardial perfusion imaging",
