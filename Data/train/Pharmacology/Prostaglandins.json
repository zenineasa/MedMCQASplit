It has been primarily used for short lasting painful inflammatory conditions. Paracetamal- (acetoaminophen) It is an active metabolite of phenacetin and is responsible for its analgesic effect. It has no significant anti-inflammatory effects. In therapeutic doses, a mild increase in hepatic enzymes may occasionally occur in the absence of jaundice; this is reversible if drug is withdrawn. Ingestion of 15 grn of acetoaminophen may be fatal, death being caused by severe hepatotoxicity with centrilobular necrosis, sometimes associated with acute renal tubular necrosis. Doses more than 4g/d are not recommended and a history of alcoholism contraindicates even this dose. Diflunisal-It is derived from salicylic acid. Analgesic and anti- inflammatory effects are 4--5 times more potent than aspirin. lt undergoes an enterohepatic cycle with reabsorption of its glucoronide metabolite followed by cleavage of the glucoronide to again release the active moiety.",

Repeat in December 2010. MECHANISM OF ACTION OF ASPIRIN: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and derivatives of ibuprofen, inhibit cyclooxygenase activity of PGH2 Synthase. There are two isoforms of PGH2 Synthase: COX-1 & COX-2 (Cyclooxygenase 1 & 2). Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its non-competitive irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase (COX1 & COX2) enzyme. Cyclooxygenase is required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the COX enzyme. This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen), which are competitive reversible inhibitors CYCLOXYGENASE: COX1. COX 2. ALSO KNOWN ASPGH, synthase 1. PGH, synthase 2. EXPRESSIONAlways present, in all normal tissues. Inducible at the site of inflammation (normally very low levels) plus normally in brain & kidney. STIMULUSHumoral stimulation.
