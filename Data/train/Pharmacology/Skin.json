It penetrates the stratum comeum or follicular openings unchanged and is converted metabolically to benzoic acid within the epidermis and dermis.RETINOIC ACID & DERIVATIVESRetinoic acid, also known as tretinoin or all-trans-retmoic acid, is the acid form of vitamin A. It is an effective topical treatment for acne vulgaris. The most common adverse effects of topical retinoic acid are erythema and dryness that occur in the first few weeks of useAdapalene is a derivative of naphthoic acid that resembles retinoic acid in structure and effects. It is applied as a 0.1 % gel once daily.. Adapalene is less irritating than tretinoin and is most effective in patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris.Tazarotene is an acetylenic retinoid that is available as a 0.1 % gel and cream for the treatment of mild to moderately severe facial acne. Topical tazarotene should be used by women of childbearing age only after contraceptive counseling. It is recommended that tazarotene should not be used by pregnant women.ISOTRETINOINIsotretinoin is a synthetic retinoid currently restricted to the treatment of severe cystic acne that is recalcitrant to standard therapies. Most patients with cystic acne respond to 1-2 mg/kg, given orally in two divided doses daily for 4-5 months Common adverse effects resemble hypervitaminosis A and include dryness and itching of the skin and mucous membranes. Teratogenicity is a significant risk in patients taking isotretinoin.AZELAICACIDAzelaic acid is a straight-chain saturated dicarboxylic acid that has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of acne vulgaris and acne rosacea.",

(ACh. acetylcholine; D, dopamine; Epi. epinephrine: NE. norepinephrine; N. nicotinic receptors: M. muscarinic receptors)Parasympathetic ganglia are present near the wall of the organ innervated.Some sympathetic postganglionic filters release acetylcholine or dopamine rather than norepinephrine.The adrenal medulla, a modified sympathetic ganglion, receives sympathetic preganglionic fibers and releases epinephrine and norepinephrine into the blood.The autonomic nervous system lends itself to division on anatomic grounds into two major portions: the sympathetic (thoracolumbar) division and the parasympathetic (craniosacral) division.The sympathetic preganglionic fibers leave the central nervous system through the thoracic and lumbar spinal nerves.The parasympathetic preganglionic fibers leave the central nervous system through the cranial nerves (especially the third, seventh, ninth and tenth) and the third and fourth sacral spinal roots.Most of the sympathetic preganglionic fibers terminate in ganglia located in the paravertebral chains that lie on either side of the spinal column.The remaining sympathetic preganglionic fibers terminate in prevertehral ganglia, which lie in front of the vertebrae, usually on the surface of the aorta.From the ganglia, postganglionic sympathetic fibers run to the tissues innervated. Some preganglionic parasympathetic fibers terminate in parasympathetic ganglia located outside the organs innervated: the ciliary, ptery gopalatine, submandibular, otic, and several pelvic ganglia.The majority of parasympathetic preganglionic fibers terminate on ganglion cells distributed diffusely or in networks in the walls of the innervated organs.",
