Explanation: Aztreonam is a monobactum and has structural similarities to ceftazidime; hence, its gram- negative spectrum is similar to that of the third- generation cephalosporins. It is stable to many b lactamases with the notable exceptions being AmpC b lactamases and extended-spectrum b lactamases. A carbapenem is indicated for infections caused by susceptible organisms that are resistant to other available drugs, eg, P aeruginosa, and for treatment of mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections. Carbapenems are highly active in the treatment of enterohacter infections because they are resistant to destruction by the b lactamase. Carbapenems are also the treatment of choice for infections caused by extended-spectrum b - lactamase (ESBL) producing gram-negative bacteria. Cefepime a fourth-generation cephalosporin is more resistant to hydrolysis by chromosomal b lactamases (eg, those produced by Enterobacter). However, like the third-generation cephalosporins, it is hydrolyzed by extended- spectrum b lactamases. So cefipime and ceftazidime cannot be used.",

Drug of choice for pseudomembranous enterocolitis is oral vancomycin. Vancomycin. Glycopeptide antibiotic. QEffective against MRSAQ, Strep, viridans, Enterococcus and CL difficile. QMechanism of Action: Acts by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesisQ(binds terminal D-ala-D-ala' sequence). Uses: Oral: Antibiotic associated pseudonembranous colitis. Intravenous: Serious MRSA infection, Enterococcal endocarditis. Empirical therapy of bacterial meningitis, Pneumococcal infections. QSide-Effects: High systemic toxicity. QCauses plasma cone, dependent nerve deafnessQ which may be permanent. Dose related kidney damage. QHistamine release: Skin allergy, fall in BP and Red man syndrome. QRapid IV injection has caused chills, fever, urticaria and intense flushing called 'Red man syndrome'QPseudomembranous Colitis. PMC is caused by C. difficile, a gram-positiveQ bacillus. C. difficile colitis is the leading cause of nosocomially acquired diarrheaQ. Pathogenesis: Colitis is thought to result from overgrowth of this organism after depletion of the normal commensal flora of the gut with the use of antibioticsQ. ClindamycinQ was the first antimicrobial agent associated with C. difficile colitis, almost any antibiotic may cause this disease. Toxins produced: Toxin A (an enterotoxin) and toxin B (a cytotoxin)Q. Immunosuppression, medical comorbidities, prolonged hospitalization or nursing home residence, and bowel surgery increase the riskQ. Clinical Features: The spectrum of disease ranges from watery diarrhea to fulminant, life-threatening colitis. Diagnosis: Diagnosis is made after detection of one or both toxins by: Stool cytotoxin assay. QELISAQColonoscopy: Characteristic ulcers, plaques, and pseudomembranes. QTreatment: Immediate cessation of the offending antimicrobial agentQ. Mild disease: Oral metronidazole (10-day course): Drug of choice. QOral vancomycin: Second-line agent, used in metronidazole allergy or in recurrent diseaseQ Severe disease: Bowel rest. IV hydration, and IV metronidazole or oral vancomycinQ.
