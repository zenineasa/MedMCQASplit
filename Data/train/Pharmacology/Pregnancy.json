KDT, Pharmacology, 6th ed., p 323)ATOSIBAN# Atosiban is an oxytocin receptor antagonist with high uterine specificity.# It is effective in inhibiting preterm uterine contractions, and is at least as effective as conventional beta-agonist therapy in treating preterm labour, but with significantly fewer maternal and fetal side effects.# The incidence of maternal/fetal side effects is significantly higher with beta-agonists, and serious maternal CV side effects, such as pulmonary edema and myocardial ischemia, were also associated with beta-agonist but not atosiban therapy.# The favourable safety profile of atosiban in combination with equivalent tocolytic effectiveness would appear to represent an advance over current tocolytic therapy.
