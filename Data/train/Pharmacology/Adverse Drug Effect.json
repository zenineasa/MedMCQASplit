It was also believed to reduce vomiting in pregnancy. It was a routine hypnotics in hospitals, was even recommended to help children adapt themselves to a convalescent home atmosphere. The indiscrete use of these drugs in pregnant women resulted in an outbreak of Phocomelia. Phocomelia means \"seal extremities\", it is a congenital deformity in which the long bones of the limbs are defective and substantially normal or rudimentary hands and feet arise on or nearly on the trunk like the flippers of seal. Thalidomide was subsequently banned. Now, decades later thalidomide has received approval from the food and drug administration in certain conditions.

Impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy on ophthalmic manifestations in human immunodeficiency virus: Before the introduction of HAART, CMV retinitis affected 30-40% of HIV-infected individuals. At that time a study from our center documented CMV retinitis and cotton-wool spots caused by HIV-related microvasculopathy as the most frequently encountered ocular lesions. Additionally, a study conducted at our center in Indian children infected with HIV found a high prevalence of ocular and systemic lesions, most commonly anterior uveitis followed by CMV retinitis. Since the advent of HAART, immune recovery uveitis (IRU) has become an ocular manifestation described in patients with inactive CMV retinitis. The reported incidence of IRU has been shown to vary widely and limited data is available of possible risk factors. Some HIV-infected individuals experience clinical deterioration after initiating antiretroviral therapy that is believed to be a result of the restored immune system to mount an exuberant inflammatory response. Immune reconstitution syndrome can cause posterior segment inflammation in CMV retinitis and can lead to visual morbidity in patients with AIDS.",

Due to the risk of dangerously low blood pressure (hypotension) and loss of consciousness, ondansetron and apomorphine should not be combined. Ondansetron: (serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist). Primary drugs used to treat and prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron is also effective in controlling post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and post-radiation nausea and vomiting, and is a possible therapy for nausea and vomiting due to acute or chronic medical illness or acute gastroenteritis. A 2006 double-blind, randomized controlled trial indicated that ondansetron may have value in the treatment of schizophrenia, as an adjunct to haloperidol. Ondansetron lowers the cravings for alcohol, especially in early-onset alcoholics. Ondansetron blocks the 5-HT3 receptor in the enteric nervous system, and thereby reduces colonic contractions, sensory perception, and motility. A large number of drugs in this category, 5-HT3 antagonist, have been shown to have this effect, which positively impacts irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D).

The drug Cyclophosphamide itself is not toxic, The drug toxicity is due to its hepatic conversion to the metabolite \"acrolein\" which is excreted in the urine and causes damage to the bladder mucosa. It is believed that urothelial damage occurs due to direct contact of the bladder wall with acrolein which causes edema, ulceration, neovascularization, hemorrhage and necrosis. Thus patients receiving cyclophosphamide should always receive good hydration and a foley's catheter is often placed to ensure immediate drainage of the bladder. The hemorrhagic cystitis caused by cyclophosphamide can be reduced in intensity or prevented by intravenous administration of\"MESNA\" MESNA is a thiol compound. The free (Thiol) groups of MESNA combine directly with double bond of acrolein ot form a stable nontoxic compound. MESNA is given orallyQ.
