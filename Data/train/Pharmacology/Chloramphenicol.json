Chloramphenicol binds to 50S ribosome and interferes with peptide bond formation and transfer of peptide chain from p site to a site thereby inhibiting polypeptide elongation (Ref: essentials of medical pharmacology by KD Tripathy ) Chloramphenicol binds to 50S subunit--interferes with peptide bond formation and transfer of peptide chain from 'P' site.",
