Metronidazole manifests antibacterial activity against all Anaerobic cocci; Anaerobic gram-negative bacilli(incl. Bacteroides sp.); Anaerobic spore-forming gram-positive bacilli (such as Clostridium); and Microaerophilic bacteria such as Helicobacter and Campylobacter sp. So Metronidazole is less active against Aerobic organisms because of the lack of Radical-mediated mechanism. Nonsporulating gram-positive bacilli often are resistant, as they are aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria.",
