The Ca2+ ions after binding to calmodulin activate a membrane-associated serine/ threonine phosphatase called calcineurin which dephosphorylates regulatory protein 'nuclear factor of activated T-cell' (NFAT), permitting its intranuclear migration and transcription of cytokine genes leading to the production of IL-2 along with other interleukins, GM-CSF, TNFa, interferon, etc. Cyclosporine enters target cells and binds to cyclophilin, an immunophilin class of protein. The complex then binds to and inactivates calcineurin response of the helper T cell to antigenic stimulation fails.

G1). Abatacept is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell expression system. The drug has activity as a selective costimulation modulator with inhibitory activity on T lymphocytes. It is used in the treatment of Rheumatoid ahritis. Ordinarily, full T cell activation requires 1) binding of the T cell receptor to the antigen-MHC complex on the antigen presenting cell (APC) and 2) a costimulatory signal provided by the binding of the T cell's CD28 protein to the B7 protein on the APC. Abatacept, which contains a high-affinity binding site for B7, works by binding to the B7 protein on APCs and preventing them from delivering the costimulatory signal to T cells, thus preventing the full activation of T cells. Abatacept is the basis for the second-generation belatacept currently being tested in clinical trials. In organ transplantation, it is intended to provide extended graft survival while limiting the toxicity generated by standard immune-suppressing regimens such as calcineurin inhibitors (eg, ciclosporin).
