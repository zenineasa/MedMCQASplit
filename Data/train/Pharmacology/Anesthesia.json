As the concentration of the LA is increased, the rate of rise of AP and maximum depolarization decreases causing slowing of conduction. Finally, local depolarization fails to reach the threshold potential and conduction block ensues. The LAs interact with a receptor situated within the voltage sensitive Na+ channel and raise the threshold of channel opening: Na+ permeability fails to increase in response to an impulse or stimulus. Impulse conduction is interrupted when the Na+ channels over a critical length of the fibre (2-3 nodes of Ranvier in case of myelinated fibres) are blocked. Ref:- kd tripathi; pg num:-361",

Use in patients with head injuries: risk of elevated intracranial pressure3. Use during pregnancy: In pregnant women who are chronically using opioids, the fetus may become physically dependent in utero and manifest withdrawal symptoms in the early postpaum period. 4. Use in patients with impaired pulmonary function: In patients with borderline respiratory reserve, the depressant propeies of the opioid analgesics may lead to acute respiratory failure. 5. Use in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function: Because morphine is primarily metabolized in the liver, their use in patients in a prehepatic coma may be questioned. Half-life is prolonged in patients with impaired renal function. 6. Use in patients with endocrine disease: Patients with adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) and those with hypothyroidism (myxedema) may have prolonged and exaggerated responses to opioids.

        "exp": "The mechanism of action of local anesthetic is by blockade of sodium channels in their activated state. Local anesthetic drugs interfere with excitation and conduction by action potentials in the nervous system and in the heart by blockade of the voltage-gated Na channel. Drug affinity varies with gating state of the channel. The drugs show low affinity at slow excitation rates, but high affinity when the channels are opened and inactivated during action potentials at high frequency, as they are during pain or during a cardiac arrhythmia. The drugs are thought to access their binding site in the inner pore by passage through the membrane and entry through the inner pore vestibule. There have been three major developments in the last decade that greatly increase our understanding of their mechanism of action. Firstly, amino acid residues critical to drug binding have been located by mutagenesis, and it is possible to develop a molecular model of the drug binding site. Secondly, a path for drug access directly from the outside has been characterized in the cardiac isoform of the channel. Thirdly, the hypothesis that high affinity binding stabilizes the fast inactivated conformation of the channel has been challenged. Rather, the drug may stabilize a slow inactivated state and immobilize the voltage sensor in domain III in its activated outward position. The combination of mutational study of the cloned Na channels and patch clamp offers the oppounity to understand the detailed molecular mechanism of drug action and to resolve drug structure-function.

Excellent intubating condition viz. relaxed jaw, vocal cords apa and immobile with no diaphragmatic movements, is obtained within 1-1. 5 min. Avoided/contraindication:- It should be avoided in younger children unless absolutely necessary, because risk of hyperkalaemia and cardiac arrhythmia is higher.
