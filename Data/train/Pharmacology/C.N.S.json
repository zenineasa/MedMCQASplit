It is however advisable to perform a \"fetal echocardiography\" to exclude the possibilities of cardiac anomaly.Evaluation of studies on lithium in pregnancy shows that lithium therapy throughout pregnancy does not seem to increase the general rate of major anomalies and apparently add only a small risk for cardiovascular defects notably Ebstein's anomaly.It can be concluded that whenever lithium is the drug of choice in women with bipolar disorder, it may be continued even in pregnancy.Moreover it is advised not to discontinue lithium as it may subsequently lead to relapse of the disorder.In addition, pregnancy of lithium treated women should be considered high risk and therefore monitoring during pregnancy has to include \"fetal echocardiography\".Pregnancy interruption in lithium treated mothers can probably be considered only if severe cardiac anomaly is diagnosed.According to K.D.T.Lithium is contraindicated during pregnancy.But all other books states that lithium can be administered is during pregnancy.",

        "question": "Which of the following is a mood stabilizer?",
        "exp": "Ans: a (Lithium) Ref:Katzung, 10th ed, p 455Lithium carbonate is often referred to as an \"antimanic\" drug, and is considered a \"mood-stabilizing\" agent because of its primary action of preventing mood swings in patients with bipolar affective (manic-depressive) disorder. Concentrations considered to be effective and acceptably safe are between 0.6 and 1.25 mEq/L. The range of 0.9-1.1 mEq/L isfavoured for treatment of acutely manic or hypomanic patients. Somewhat lower values (0.6-0.75 mEq/L) are considered adequate and are safer for long-term use for prevention of recurrent manic-depressive illness.Adverse Effects & ComplicationsMany adverse effects associated with lithium treatment occur at varying times after treatment is started.Some are harmless, but it is important to be alert to adverse effects that may signify impending serious toxic reactions.A. NEUROLOGIC AND PSYCHIATRIC ADVERSE EFFECTSTremor is one of the most common adverse effects of lithium treatment, and it occurs with therapeutic doses. Propranolol and atenolol, which have been reported to be effective in essential tremor, also alleviate lithium-induced tremor. Other reported neurologic abnormalities include choreoathetosis, motor hyperactivity, ataxia, dysarthria, and aphasia. Psychiatric disturbances at toxic concentrations are generally marked by mental confusion and withdrawal. Appearance of any new neurologic or psychiatric symptoms or signs is a clear indication for temporarily stopping treatment with lithium and close monitoring of serum levels.B. DECREASED THYROID FUNCTIONLithium probably decreases thyroid function in most patients exposed to the drug, but the effect is reversible or nonprogressive. Few patients develop frank thyroid enlar gement, and fewer still show symptoms of hypothyroidism. Although initial thyroid testing followed by regular- monitoring of thyroid function has been proposed, such procedures are not cost-effective. Obtaining a serum TSH concentration every 6-12 months, however, is prudent.C. NEPHROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS AND OTHER RENAL ADVERSE EFFECTSPolydipsia and polyuria are common but reversible concomitants of lithium treatment, occurring at therapeutic serum concentrations. The principal physiologic lesion involved is loss of responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). Lithium-induced diabetes insipidus is resistant to vasopressin but responds to amiloride.An extensive literature has accumulated concerning other forms of renal dysfunction during long-term lithium therapy, including chronic interstitial nephritis and minimal-change glomerulopathy with nephritic syndrome. Some instances of decreased glomerular filtration rate have been encountered but no instances of marked azotemia or renal failure.Patients receiving lithium should avoid dehydration and the associated increased concentration of lithium in urine. Periodic tests of renal concentrating ability should be performed to detect changes.D. OEDEMAOedema is a common adverse effect of lithium treatment and may be related to some effect of lithium on sodium retention. Although weight gain may be expected in patients who become edematous, water retention does not account for the weight gain observed in up to 30% of patients taking lithium.E. CARDIAC ADVERSE EFFECTSThe bradycardia-tachycardia (\"sick sinus\") syndrome is a definite contraindication to the use of lithium because the ion further depresses the sinus node. T-wave flattening is often observed on ECG but is of questionable significance.F. USE DURING PREGNANCYRenal clearance of lithium increases during pregnancy and reverts to lower levels immediately after delivery. A patient whose serum lithium concentration is in a good therapeutic range during pregnancy may develop toxic levels following delivery. Special care in monitoring lithium levels is needed at these times. Lithium is transferred to nursing infants through breast milk, in which it has a concentration about one-third to one-half that of serum. Lithium toxicity in newborns is manifested by lethargy, cyanosis, poor suck and Moro reflexes, and perhaps hepatomegaly.An earlier report suggested an increase in the frequency of cardiac anomalies, especially Ebstein anomaly, in lithium babies. However, more recent data suggest that lithium carries a relatively low risk of teratogenic effects.G MISCELLANEOUS ADVERSE EFFECTSTransient acneiform eruptions have been noted early in lithium treatment. Some of them subside with temporary discontinuance of treatment and do not recur with its resumption. Folliculitis is less dramatic and probably occurs more frequently. Leukocytosis is always present during lithium treatment, probably reflecting a direct effect on leukopoiesis rather than mobilization from the marginal pool. This adverse effect has now become a therapeutic effect in patients with low leukocyte counts.Haloperidol is an antipsychotic and is butyrophenone derivativeThe butyrophenones and congeners tend to be more potent and to have fewer autonomic effects but greater extrapyramidal effects.",

(C) Start SSRI treatment based on side effect profile(Ref: CMDT 2010/964)Depression associated with reactive disorders usually does not call for drug therapy and can be managed by psychotherapy and the passage of time. In severe cases -- particularly when vegetative signs are significant and symptoms have persisted for more than a few weeks -- antidepressant drug therapy is often effective. Drug therapy is also suggested by a family history of major depression in first-degree relatives or a past history of prior episodes.Drug selection is influenced by the history of previous responses if that information is available. If a relative has responded to a particular drug, this suggests that the patient may respond similarly. If no background information is available, a drug such as sertraline, 25 mg orally daily and increasing gradually up to 200 mg orally, or desipramine, starting with 50 mg orally and gradually increasing to 150 mg daily, can be selected and a full trial instituted. The medication trial should be monitored for worsening mood or suicidal ideation with patient assessments every 1-2 weeks until week 6.

There is common consenses that option c was definitely 10/15andnot 10-15.Even though there is a chance that it was a typing error, going by basic mathematics the option (c) 10/15 = 0.666.This definitely falls between the range 0.6-1.25 which is considered as the effective and safe concentration of lithium. The next best option might be a) 1 -5 mEq/L.LITHIUMLithium carbonate is often referred to as an \"antimaniac\" drug and is considered as a \"mood-stabilizing\" agent because of its primary action of preventing mood swings in patients with bipolar affective (manic- depressive) disorder.Concentrations considered to be effective and acceptably safe are between 0.6 and 1.25 mEq/L.The range of 0.9-1.1 mEq/L is favoured for treatment of acutelymanic or hypo manic patients.Somewhat lower values (0.6-0.75 mEq/L) are considered adequate and are safer for long-term use for prevention of recurrent manic-depressive illness.Adverse Effects & Complications of Lithium.1) Neurological and psychiatric manifestationsTremor is one of the most common adverse effects of lithium treatment.Treatment - propranolol.Appearance of any new neurologic or psychiatric symptoms or signs is a clear indication for temporarily stopping treatment with lithium and close monitoring of serum levels.2) Decreased thyroid functions - reversibleThyroid function test (TFT) should be done before starting the drug.3) Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and other renal adverse effectsDue to loss of responsiveness to ant diuretic hormone (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). Lithium-induced diabetes insipidus is resistant to vasopressin but responds to amiloride.4) OedemaOedema is a common adverse effect of lithium treatment and may be related to some effect of lithium on sodium retention.5) Cardiac adverse effectsThe bradycardia-tachycardia (\"sick sinus\") syndrome is a definite contraindication to the use of lithium because the ion further depresses the sinus node.6) Use m pregnancyLithium is contraindicated during pregnancy. It causes fetal goiter,Ebteins anomaly etc. More recent data suggest that lithium carries a relatively low risk of teratogenic effects.7.

When GABA binds with GABA receptors the permeability of the GABA receptors for the chloride ion increases allowing more ions into the neurons and decreasing excitability.Benzodiazepenes attach with GABA receptors.The resulting Benzodiazepene GABA receptor complex enhance the effectiveness of GABA by lowering the concentration of GABA required for opening the chloride channel thus enabling GABA ergic circuits to produce a larger inhibitory effect.Simply remember, Benzodiazepenes increase the frequency of channel-opening, thus leading to inhibition.Barbiturates also act on GABA receptors to cause sedation.But in contrast to benzodiazepenes they appear to increase the duration of GABA gate chloride channel opening.Zolpidem is a newer hypnotic that also modify GABA receptors.",

        "question": "Pethidine differs from morphine is producing which of the following effect?",
        "exp": "Ans. B. Tachycardia.There are some pharmacological differences of pethidine from morphine. Pethidine produces tachycardia, dry mouth and less marked meiosis.Pethidine# It is a synthetic phenylpyperidine derivative and was originally developed as an antimuscarinic agent.# Dose: Pethidine is available as 50 mg tablets and ampoules of different strength (10 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml). For acute pain, it can be administered orally (50-150 mg), SC (50-100 mg), IM (50-100 mg) or IV (25-100 mg). The doses can be repeated every 4 hours.# Pharmacokinetics: Pethidine is 30 times more lipid soluble than morphine. Oral bio-availability is 50%. It is metabolized in the liver by ester hydrolysis to norpethidine and pethidinic acid that are excreted in urine and therefore accumulate in renal failure. At higher concentration, norpethidine can produce hallucination and convulsions. Pethidinic acid is an inactive compound. Pethidine is often used for labour analgesia. It readily crosses placenta, and a significant amount reaches to the foetus over several hours.# Effects: There are some pharmacological differences from morphine. It produces tachycardia, dry mouth and less marked meiosis. However, significant fall in BP may occur when pethidine is administered to elderly or hypovolaemic patients. It may produce less biliary tract spasm than morphine. Pethidine is absolutely contraindicated in patients on monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), as serious side effects like hypotension or hypertension, hyperpyrexia, convulsion and coma may occur. The underlying mechanism is not clear but may involve reduced metabolism of pethidine by MAOI and pethidine's effect on turnover of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the brain.# Like morphine, pethidine exerts its analgesic effects by acting as an agonist at the mu opioid receptor. It also has a kappa opioid receptor action, which is of unknown clinical significance. It has structural similarities to atropine and other tropane alkaloids and may have some of their effects and side effects. In addition to these opioidergic and anticholinergic effects, it has local anesthetic activity related to its interactions with sodium ion channels.# Pethidine is no more effective than morphine at treating biliary or renal pain, and its low potency, short duration of action, and unique toxicity (i.e., seizures, delirium, other neuropsychological effects)# It is more lipid-soluble than morphine, resulting in a faster onset of action. Its duration of clinical effect is 120-150 minutes although it is typically administered in 4-6 hour intervals.# Pethidine has been shown to be less effective than morphine, diamorphine or hydromorphone at easing severe pain, or pain associated with movement or coughing. It is also used for the treatment of postanesthetic shivering.# Like other opioid drugs, pethidine has the potential to cause physical dependence or addiction. Pethidine may be more likely to be abused than other prescription opioids, perhaps because of its rapid onset of action. When compared with oxycodone, hydromorphone, and placebo, pethidine was consistently associated with more euphoria, difficulty concentrating, confusion, and impaired psychomotor and cognitive performance when administered to healthy volunteers.Morphine# Morphine is a naturally occurring phenanthrene derivative. It is the standard drug against which all other opioids are compared.# Dose: Morphine can be given orally, intramuscularly (IM), intravenously (IV), subcutaneously (SC), rectally, epidurally and intrathecally.# The intramuscular dose is 0.1-0.2 mg/kg, time to peak effect is 30-60 minutes and duration of action is 3-4 hours. Intravenous administration should be titrated to effect (usually l-2mg boluses), but the total dose is similar. The onset of action is slightly more rapid with following IV administration, as the main factor responsible for its latency is low lipid solubility and slow penetration of blood brain barrier. Morphine may be given epidurally at 10% and intrathecally at 1% of the parenteral dose.# Pharmacokinetics: Morphine is extensively metabolised by the gut wall and the liver to morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) (70%), morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) (10%) and to sulphate conjugates. M6G is 10-20 times more potent than morphine and is normally excreted in urine. It accumulates in renal failure and accounts for increased sensitivity to morphine. Neonates are more sensitive than adults to morphine due to reduced hepatic conjugating capacity. In the elderly, owing to reduced volume of distribution, peak plasma level of morphine is higher compared to younger patient.# Effects: The main effects are mediated through MOP receptors. It is a potent analgesic with good sedative and anxiolytic properties. It may cause euphoria, dysphoria and hallucination. It produces respiratory depression and cough suppression. It has minimal effect on cardiovascular system and may produce bradycardia and hypotension. Nausea and vomiting are common side effects. Histamine release may lead to rash, itching and bronchospasm (in susceptible patients). Meiosis is common. Tolerance and dependence may develop.Pharmacokinetics of commonly used opioids MorphinePethidineFentanylAlfentanilRemifentanilpKa8.08.58.46.57.1Unionised at pH 7.4 (%)23599068Plasma protein bound (%)3040849070Terminal half life (hrs)343.51.60.06Clearance (ml/min/kg)15-308-180.8-1.04-930-40Volume of distribution (L/kg)3-53-53-50.4-1.00.2-0.3Relative lipid solubility1285809050",

KDT, 6th/pg. 459, 464)OPIOID WITHDRAWALDefinitionClinical syndrome produced by withdrawal of an opioid drug from an opioid-dependent individual, by: (1) the cessation or abrupt reduction in dosage of an opioid; or (2) the administration of an opioid antagonist including naloxone, naltrexone, and nalorphine.Clinical DiagnosisInitial symptoms and signs may develop immediately after the administration of an opioid antagonist or up to 48 hours after cessation or reduction in dosage of the opioid, depending upon the half-life of the drug concerned. These include restlessness, mydriasis, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, sneezing, piloerection, yawning, perspiration, restless sleep and aggres-sive behavior.Severe manifestations include: muscle spasms, backaches, abdominal cramps, hot and cold flushes, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachypnoea, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia and cardiac dysrhythmias. Seizures may be observed in neonates (only).Serum electrolytes (Na, K, Cl), creatinine, blood glucose and hematocrit may be of value in managing.TreatmentOne of two general approaches is commonly adopted.# The first comprises substitution of the drug with a longer-acting opioid, such as methadone, followed by a gradual reduction in dosage of the substitute drug.# The second comprises use of various pharmacological agents, such as clonidine and/or a benzodiazapine, which will mitigate symptoms and signs of withdrawal.# Clonidine suppresses sympathetic overactivity of opioid withdrawal and reduces craving to some extent. The dosage of clonidine should then be gradually reduced, typically over a one- to two-week period.# If symptoms and signs of opioid withdrawal do not respond to the use of clonidine and/or benzodiazepines, then the use of propantheline (for stomach cramps) or atropine (for diarrhea) may be considered.# Opioid-dependent individuals with co-existent medical or surgical conditions requiring pain relief should receive conventional treatment, including if necessary the administration of opioids.Nalaxone can reverse most of the actions of morphine very effectively & completely except SEDATION",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., m When used as an anaesthetic opioids may cause muscle rigidity.Opioid induced rigidity is characterized by increased muscle tone progressing at times to severe stiffness.When the rigidity increases and involves thoracic and abdominal muscle, it may impair ventilation. Rigidity of the abdominal and/or thoracic muscles was thought to underlie opioid induced impairment of spontaneous or controlled ventilation.The precise mechanism by which opioids can cause muscular rigidity is not clearly understood.Muscle rigidity is not due to direct action on muscle fibres because it can be decreased or prevented by pretreatment with muscle relaxants.In addition, opioid induced muscle rigidity is not associated with increase in creatinine kinase a finding suggesting that little or no muscle damage occurs during this period.Opioids do not have any significant effect on neuromuscular conduction and result in only minimal depression of monosynaptic reflexes associated with muscle stretch receptors.Some investigators have suggested that opioids produce rigidity by altering dopamine concentrations within the striatums of the brain.Rigidity may occur due to the result of stimulation of GABA ergic interneurons which can be blocked by lesion in the striatum.Continuous research and data seems to indicate that the main mechanism responsible for opioid induced muscle rigidity is stimulation of u receptors.Opioids appear to produce their physiological effects by binding to at least three types of opioid receptors the mu (m), delta (S) and Kappa (k) receptors.Muscle rigidity occurs after administration of supra analgesic doses of potent m preferring opioids.The present data demonstrates that whereas systemic opiate induced muscle rigidity is primarily due to the activation of central mu receptors, supraspinal delta and kappa receptors may attenuate this effect.Anaesthesia review by Michelle Bowman Howard states (p134)All opioids given in high doses may cause muscular rigidity. It is most likely related to m receptors in the caudate nucleus. It is more commonly seen with Fentanyl.",

Partial agonists of this receptor (buspirone, ipsapirone, gepirone) are useful as anti-anxiety drugs.5-HT1B/1D (presynaptic receptor) cause constriction of cranial vessels and agonists at this receptor (sumatriptan, naratriptan) are useful for the treatment of acute migraine attacks.5-HT2A/2C receptor is responsible for most of the direct actions of serotonin. Ketanserin and ritanserin are antagonists at this receptor and are useful as antihypertensive agents. Clozapine and risperidone are atypical antipsychotic agents that act through antagonistic activity at this receptor.5-HT3 receptor is an ionotropic receptor (other 5 HT receptors are GPCRs) and mediates most of the reflex and indirect actions of serotonin. Stimulation of this receptor is responsible for vomiting induced by anticancer drugs. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists like ondansetron are the drug of choice for chemotherapy induced vomiting.5-HT4 receptor is present in GIT and is responsible for increase in peristalsis.

Its adverse effects include headache, nausea and sleep disturbances.Nicotine: A transdermal patch containing nicotine is applied to the patient's body. The dose of nicotine is then slowly decreased and finally withdrawn. It is effective in only 18-20% of the patients. It is also available in the form of lozenges.Bupropion: It is an anti-depressant drug that can be used for cessation of smoking. It acts by inhibition of neuronal reuptake of 5-HT, NE and DA. The duration of treatment is for 8-10 weeks. It can result in CNS stimulation leading to seizures.Clonidine: It is a very effective drug for reducing the withdrawal effects of nicotine. It is better than nicotine chewing gum as it can be used in patients with cardiac diseases also. It decreases the craving as well as is useful for insomnia.Rimonabant: It is a cannabinoid receptor antagonist that results in the increased 5-HT and dopamine levels.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e. 5 HTIB/ID Triptans are new class of antimigrane drugs that act by safe actively activating serotonin receptor (5-HT IB/ID)Serotonin (5 Hydroxytryptamine (5 HT)) is a potent depolarizer of nerve endings and mediates various physiological action in the body. But serotonin has no application as drug. However several drugs act on various receptor subtypes of serotonin and are effective in various diseases.Serotonin mediates its action through following receptors:5-HT15 HT1A5HTIb/Id,5HT2A5-HT35-HT4The Triptans act on 5 HTIB/m receptor of the serotoninThe 5-HT] receptor is localized to the brain and is classified into two types 5HT1a - present in raphe nuclei 5HTib/id - constricts cranial blood vesselsTriptans are selective activators of 5-HTIB/ID receptor.The selective activation of 5HT1B/1D receptor results in vasoconstriction of cranial vessels. This relieves migraine as migraine is believed to be caused by the dilatation of extracerebral cranial blood flow.Dilation of blood vessels during migraine attack is believed to divert blood away from the brain parenchyma.Triptans also inhibit the release of vasodilating peptides and antiseizure agents.Sumatriptan and its congeners are currently the first line therapy for acute severe migraine attacks in most patients.The efficacy of Triptan 5-HT1B/1D agonist in migraine is equal to or greater than that of other acute drug treatments e.g. alkaloid.More on triptans * All these drugs are given orally.They are contraindicated in patients with coronary artery disease because they can cause coronary vasospasm (chest discomfort occurs in 1-5% of patients).Although the pharmacological mechanism of the Triptans is similar, their pharmacokinetic properties are distinct:Bioavailability of Triptan ranges from 14% sumatriptan to 74% naratriptan.Half life of ranges from 2 hours for sumatriptan to 25 hours for rovatriptan.",
