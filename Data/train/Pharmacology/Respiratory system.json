        "exp": "Acute paracetamol poisoning:- occurs especially in small children who have low hepatic glucoronide conjugating ability and also with over dosage. Clinical Manifestations:- nausea, vomi ting, abdominal pain and liver tenderness with no impairment of consciousness. After 12-18 hours centrilobular hepatic necrosis occurs which may be accompanied by renal tubular necrosis and hypoglycaemia that may progress to coma. Jaundice stas after 2 days. Fuher course depends on the dose taken. Fulminating hepatic failure and death are likely if the plasma levels are above the line joining 200 ug/ml at 4 hours and 30 ug/ml at 15 hours. If the levels are lower recovery with suppoive treatment is the rule. Mech of toxicity:- N acetyl- p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI) is a minor metabolite of paracetamol which is detoxified by conjugation with glutathione. When a very large dose of paracetamol is taken, glucuronidation capacity is saturated, more of the minor metabolite is formed--hepatic glutathione is depleted and this metabolite binds covalently to proteins in liver cells (and renal tubules) causing necrosis. In chronic alcoholics even 5-6 g taken in one day can result in hepatotoxicity because alcoholism induces CYP2. E1 that metabolises paracetamol to NAPQI. Paracetamol is not recommended in premature infants (< 2 kg) for fear of hepatotoxicity. Treatment:- If the patient is brought early, vomiting should be induced or gastric lavage done. Activated charcoal is given orally or through the tube to prevent fuher absorption. specific antidote:- N-acetylcysteine(MUCOMIX, ANTIFEN) infused over i. v for 15 mins.. Acetylcysteine It opens disulfide bonds in mucoproteins present in sputum--makes it less viscid, but has to be administered directly into the respiratory tract.
