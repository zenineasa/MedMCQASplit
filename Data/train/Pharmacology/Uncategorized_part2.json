She indicates that after having a new chef at home 3 months ago, she did not feel it necessary to check her blood glucose since the food is \"so healthy\" at the home. Which of the following methods of blood glucose monitoring, as a single measurement, would provide an overview of the average blood glucose level over the past several weeks?",
        "exp": "This question examines a common problem found in clinical practice. The gist of the problem is that patients often do not follow physician orders. With respect to the treatment of diabetes, an essential goal in diabetes management is the improvement of blood glucose control towards euglycemia throughout a patient's day. Improved levels of metabolic control have already been shown to decrease the morbidity associated with diabetes. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), a landmark multicenter trial, demonstrated that any improvement in blood glucose control towards euglycemia is associated with both a delay in the onset and progression of existing long-term complications associated with diabetes. In the case of the DCCT, carefully controlled blood glucose levels can be obtained at all times of the day with the use of multiple insulin injections. This treatment approach mimicked how the pancreas varies the amount of insulin secreted at different times of the day in response to meals and during periods of fasting. Although the benefits of achieving and maintaining good blood glucose control are now clear, diabetes is a self-managed disease where many challenges still remain for patients seeking to improve the quality of their lives and reduce the risk of developing complications. Therefore, it is essential that for patients with diabetes, physicians and other healthcare providers learn how to properly perform and appropriately monitor daily blood glucose levels, so that informed decisions can be made on how to follow treatment regimens recommended by their healthcare team. The glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb. A1c) reflects the patient's mean blood glucose level over the past six to eight weeks. In non-diabetics, 4-6% of the total hemoglobin is Hb. A1c. A change of 1% can equal a 25-40 mg/dL change in the mean blood glucose. This test is often used as an adjunct to patient Home Blood Glucose Monitoring (HBGM). The fasting plasma glucose (FPG) is primarily used by hospitals. Whole blood concentrations are 15% lower than FPG. Home Blood Glucose Monitoring (HBGM) helps the patient achieve euglycemia throughout the day. It instantly accesses the effect of dietary intake, drugs, exercise and illness on blood glucose levels. Some of the disadvantages of this method are that it is invasive, expensive and technical. Urine glucose tests correlate poorly with blood glucose levels and represents blood glucose \"hours ago\". They are beneficial in patients who cannot perform invasive HBGM technique.",

        "exp": "Phenylephrine Human penis is made up of two spongy structures i. e., - Corpora cavernosa - Corpora spongiosum These structures contain distensile channels that become filled with blood when the aerial circulation is increased. The enlargement of the aerial channels presses on the veins situated in these structures preventing outflow of blood through them. The collection of blood in the distensile channels due to aerial dilatation leads to penile erection. Erection is mediated by parasympathetic nerves (S2, S3, S4) and non adrenergic and noncholinergic pathways which induces release of NO from endothelium in penile vasculature. NO induces vascular smooth muscle relaxation allowing enhancement of blood flow leading to erection. The primary drugs used in erectile dysfunction e. g. Slidenafil, Tadalafil and Vardenfil act on Nitric oxide pathway to improve erectile dysfunction. Nitric oxide mediates its action by increasing c. GMP concentration. c. GMP is finally degraded by an enzyme phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). Slidenafil and other oral agents are inhibitors of phosphodiesterase enzyme (PDE-5). These enzymes inhibits PDE-5 and thus they reduce the degradation of c. GMP. Increased c. GMP facilitates the relaxation of distensile channels of penis. Besides phosphodiesterase inhibitors several other drugs are also used these days - Prostaglandin Ei. E2 - Alprostadil - Transurethral alprostadil - Injectable phentolamine - Apomorphine (used in Europe only) PQK - Intracavernous injection PGE1 is widely used for treating erectile dysfunction. - PGE2 (intrauretbrall) can also be used to increase penile blood flow and treat erectile dysfunction.

This drugs have a bronchodilator action of >12 hours and also protect against bronchoconstriction for a similar period. Albuterol is a sho acting selective 2 receptor agonist with pharmacological propeies and therapeutic indications similar to those of terbutaline. It is administered either by inhalation or orally for the symptomatic relief of bronchospasm. Pirbuterol is a sho acting and relatively selective 2 agonist. Its structure is identical to albuterol except for the substitution of a pyridine ring for the benzene ring. Pirbuterol acetate is available for inhalation therapy; dosing is typically every 4-6 hours. Pirbuterol is the only preparation available in a breath-activated meter-dose inhaler, a device meant to optimize medication delivery by releasing a spray of medication only on the patient's initiation of inspiration. Orciprenaline is a sho acting 2 adrenergic agonist. It is considered to be 2-selective, although it probably is less selective than albuterol or terbutaline and hence is more prone to cause cardiac stimulation. Ref: Westfall T. C., Westfall D. P.

Its contraction causes micturition. The other smooth muscle that plays an impoant role in micturition is the internal sphincter. Internal sphincter is a concentraction of smooth muscle at the bladder neck. It is well developed only in males and its principal. function is to prevent retrograde. flow of semen during ejaculation. When detrusor relaxes and the sphincters close urine is stored. Whereas voiding requires contraction of destrusor accompanied by relaxation of sphincters. Detrusor is innervated mainly by parasympathetic nerves which are excitatory and cause the muscle to contract where as internal sphincter is rich in aI adrenoreceptor (sympathetic nerves). Thus the mechanisms of urine voiding involves:? - Increased parasympathetic drive Contracts the detrusor - Decreased sympathetic drive Relax the sphincter Detrusor instability or unstable bladder is characterized by uninhibited, unstable contractions of the detrusor which may be of unknown etiology or secondary to an upper motor neuron lesion or bladder neck obstruction. Since detrusor contracts under parasympathetic influence, Anticholinergic (specifically antimuscarinic) drugs are used to treat overactive bladder disease or detrusor instability. These agents lower intravesical pressure, increase capacity and reduce the frequency of contractions by antagonizing para. sympa- thetic control of bladder. These agents include:? - Darifenacin - Solefenacin - Tolterodine - Trospium chloride - Oxybutynin - Solifenacin - Flavoxate Duloxetine is used in stress incontinence. It is a dual norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Its mechanism of action is thought to be centrally, by increasing urethral sphincter tone and contractility. It can be used in mixed incontinence. Comparison of different drugs used for treatment of Detrusor instability Drug Benefits Weaknesses * Generic oxvbutynin - Cheap - Recommended by NICE well established Poorly tolerated * Slow release oxybutynin - Improved side-effect profile - Escalating does regimen possible More expensive than immediate release * Oxyhutynin patches - Reduced side - effect profile Patches may cause skin Irritation limiting use * Flavoxate - Less side effects than Oxybutinn i Less offecting * Tolterodine - First of newer anticholinergics - Robust trial evidence Trial suggests not as effective as olifenacin * Trosplum - Does not cross blood- brain barrier - May have benefits in the elderly or patients with polypharmacy Broad spectrum anticholinergic side effects * Propiverine - Calcium antagonist action Recommended for frequency but not urge incontinence * Solifenacin - STAR study suggests some benefits over tolterodine at normal does Commonest side effect-dry mouth * Darifenacin - M3 selective Limited direct clinical experience outside of trials",

D. A. in 2002. As with other triazoles voriconazole impairs the biosynthesis of ergosterols by inhibiting the p450 enzyme 14a sterol demethylase. Voriconazole is administered by i. v. and oral routes. It is formulated as lyophilized powder, for solution for i. v. infusion as well as tablets and powder for suspension for oral administration. Uses of Voriconazole Varoconazole is a broad spectrum azole. It can be used in all diseases where azoles are effective. It is especially used for? Invasive aspergillosisQ In patients with invasive aspergillosis, initial therapy with voriconazole led to better responses and improved survival and resulted in. fewer side effects than the standard approach of initial therapy with amphotericin B. Emerging fungal pathogensQ Voriconazole is used in the primary treatment of amphotericin B and fluconazole resistant fungal infections e. g., Fusarium, Scendosporium. Patients with neutropenia and feverQ Pts with neutropenia and fever are often treated empirically with AMB or liposomal AMB to prevent invasive fungal infections. Voriconazole is a suitable alternative to AMB preparation for empirical antifungal therapy in patients with neutropenia and persistent fever. Those with Fluconazole resistant candida infection Voriconazole is a broad spectrum antifungal showing in vitro activity against candida species uncluding fluconazole resistant candida albicans2 and candida krusei2. Some impoant adverse effect of Voriconazole:? Teratogenecity - Voriconazole is teratogenic in animals and contraindicated in pregnancy (class 0) QTc prolongation and arrhythmias - Voriconazole like some other azoles causes a prolongation of the QTc intervals which can become significant in patient with other risk factors for Torsades-de-points.",

        "question": "Increased prolactin is associated with:",
        "exp": "Increased estradial Prolactin is a polypeptide produced by the lactotrophs of the pituitary. It is responsible. for the initiation and maintenance of lactation. As with several pituitary hormones, prolactin is secreted in a circadian, fashion with the highest levels being attained during sleep and a nadir occurring between 10 am and noon. Prolactin is secreted in a pulsatile. fashion, the amplitude and frequency of which not only varies throughout the day but is also impacted upon by a variety of physiology stimuli i. e., suckling, stress and increased level of ovarian steroids primarily estrogens. \"The general view is that lactotrophs have spontaneously high secretary activity\". Therefore pituitary prolactin secretion is under a tonic and predominantly inhibitory control exeed by the hypothalamus. - Hypothalmus releases prolactin inhibitory factor (PIF) which inhibits prolactin release. - PIE is actually dopamine and it suppresses prolactin synthesis and secretion by means of D2 receptors. - These actions constitute the physiologic basis of therapeutic effect of dopamine agonists in hyperprolactinemia. Prolactin acts on the breast tissue where in the setting of estrogen priming, it stimulates lactation. Effect of physiological hormones on prolactin secretion Glucocoicoids seem to have an inhibitory role on PRL secretion. - These hormones stimulate the differentiation of somatotrophs but suppress that of lactotrophs. - Long-term elevation of the serum glucocoicoid levels by chronic administration of coicotrophin (ACTH) or hydrocoisone or by prolonged stress decreases PRL secretion. Estrogens and thyroid hormones have opposite effects on PRL synthesis and release. - \"Estrogen increases prolactin levelQ by acting at both pituitary and hypothalamic level\" - At pituitary level it increases prolactin secretion by controlling PRL gene expression and modifying its sensitivity to physiological stimuli. - At hypothalamic level it inhibits the activity of all three types of hypothalamic neuroendocrine dopaminergic neurone. - Low thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels increase TRH-induced PRL secretion, whereas high T4 and T3 levels inhibit PRL m. RNA accumulation and release. An impoant point Increased estrogen causes hyperprolactinemia But Hyperprolactinemia causes decrease in estrogen Prolactin also acts at the hypothalamus to inhibit the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (Gn. RH). - Inhibition of Gn. RH results in a decrease in the release of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary. In females - This leads to decreased in estrogen and progesterone synthesis and secretion by the ovaries and a failure of ovarian. follicular maturation. In males - This leads to decrease in testicular production and synthesis of testosterone and a halt in spermatogenesis.

Potential complications include an irregular heabeat, which can be either too fast or too slow. Toxicity may occur over a sho period of time following an overdose or gradually during long-term treatment. Risk factors include low potassium, low magnesium, and high calcium. The most common precipitating cause of digitalis intoxication is depletion of potassium stores, which occurs often in patients with heart failure as a result of diuretic therapy and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Digoxin toxicity increases in individuals who have kidney impairment Diagnosis Serum digoxin level Therapeutic levels are 0. 6-1. 3 to 2. 6 ng/mL. Electrolytes In acute toxicity, hyperkalemia is common Chronic toxicity is often accompanied by hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia Electrocardiography Digoxin toxicity may cause almost any dysrhythmia Classically, dysrhythmias associated with increased automaticity and decreased AV conduction occur Sinus bradycardia and AV conduction blocks are the most common ECG changes in the pediatric population, while ventricular ectopy is more common in adults Nonparoxysmal atrial tachycardia with heart block and bidirectional ventricular tachycardia are paicularly characteristic of severe digitalis toxicity Management Suppoive care of digitalis toxicity includes the following: Hydration with IV fluids Oxygenation and suppo of ventilatory function Discontinuation of the drug, and, sometimes, the correction of electrolyte imbalances GI decontamination Activated charcoal is indicated for acute overdose or accidental ingestion Binding resins (eg, cholestyramine) may bind enterohepatically-recycled digoxin Treatment of electrolyte imbalance For hyperkalemia, use insulin plus glucose, and sodium bicarbonate if the patient is acidotic Treatment with digoxin Fab fragments is indicated for a K + level greater than 5 m.

It is rare at low doses used for hypertension, but may be of grave consequence, when brisk diuresis is induced or on prolonged therapy, especially if dietary K+ intake is low. Degree of hypokalaemia appears to be related to the duration of action of the diuretic; longer acting drugs cause more K+ loss. Hypokalemia is less common with standard doses of high ceiling diuretics than with thiazides, possibly because of shorter duration of action of the former, which permits intermittent operation of compensatory repletion mechanisms. Hypokalaemia can be prevented and treated by: (a) High dietary K+ intake or (b) Supplements of KCl (24- 72 m. Eq/day) or (c) Concurrent use of K+ sparing diuretics.

Compounds with a hydroxyl or carboxylic acid group are easily conjugated with glucuronic acid which is derived from glucose. Examples are- chloramphenicol, aspirin, paracetamol, lorazepam, morphine, metronidazole. Not only drugs but endogenous substrates like bilirubin, steroidal hormones and thyroxine utilize this pathway. Glucuronidation increases the molecular weight of the drug which ours its excretion in bile. Drug glucuronides excreted in bile can be hydrolysed bybacteria in the gut-the liberated drug is reabsorbed and undergoes the same fate. This enterohepatic cycling of the drug prolongs its action, e. g. phenolphthalein, oral contraceptives.",

        "exp": "Ans. A: Renal vasodilatory effect Dobutamine: In patients with low output cardiac fialure, dobutamine increases the cardiac output without increasing the heart rate. Unlike dopamine, it does not cause renal vasodilatation. Dopamine/ DA It is a catecholamine neurotransmitter In the brain, this substituted phenethylamine functions as a neurotransmitter, activating the five types of dopamine receptors -- D,, D,, D.,, D4, and D. - and their variants. Dopamine is produced in several areas of the brain, including the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. Dopamine is also a neurohormone released by the hypothalamus. Its main function as a hormone is to inhibit the release of prolactin from the anterior lobe of the pituitary. Dopamine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, dopamine given as a drug does not directly affect the central nervous system. To increase the amount of dopamine in the brains of patients with diseases such as parkinson's disease and doparesponsive dystonia, 1-dopa (the precursor of dopamine) is often given because it crosses the blood-brain barrier relatively easily",

        "question": "Free water clearance decreased by?",
        "exp": "Furosemide Free water clearance Kidney excretes some solutes in the urine daily. The volume of water in urine, excreted per unit time in excess of that required to excrete the contained solutes isoosmatically with plasma is called free water clearance. Free water clearance is positive dilute urine, negative when concentrated urine is passed and zero when isotonic urine is passed. For example, if 1 lit water is required to excrete the contained solutes per day following three conditions may occur (numerical value are just for example). - If urine output is 1. 5 litre than free water clearance will be + (positive) *5 lit/day. - If urine output is 1 litre per day, the free water clearance will be zero. - If urine output is *5 litre per day, the free water clearance will be -- (negative). 5lit/day. Action of diuretics To understand the effect of different diuretics on free water clearance one should know the following facts. The nephron of the kidney is arranged in such a way that some poion of it lies in the coex and some poion of it lies in the medulla. - Pas of nephron in the coex - Proximal convoluted tubule Distal convoluted tubule Thick ascending limb of Henle's loop Coical collecting duct - Pas of nephron in the medulla -9 *Descending thin limb of Henle's loop Ascending thin limb of Henle's loop Medullary collecting duct The coical poion of the nephron are responsible for diluting the urine (i. e., positive free water clearance) The medullary poions of the nephron are responsible for concentrating the urine (i. e.. negative free water clearance) Thus the diuretics which act on both medulla and coex can affect both the positive and negative free water clearance where as diuretics which act on either coex or medulla cannot affect both the negative and positive free water clearance. Furosentide Furosemide is a drug which act on both coex and medulla. It acts on the ascending limb of loop of henle which has both coical and medullary component i. e. the thin ascending pa is situated in the coex and the thicker poion is situated in the medulla. Furosemide acts in the following ways: - In hypovolemia medullary pa of ascending limb concentrate the --) negative free water clearance urine to preserve water --> block negative free water clearance - Furosemide blocks the concentrating ability of the ascending limb pa of medullary pa - In volume overload, coical poion of ascending limb of henle --) positive free water clearance loop dilute the urine to decrease the volume overload - Furosemide blocks this diluting ability as well block positive free water clearance. Thus Furosemide can block positive as well as negative free water clearance. Thiazide diuretics act on DCT and proximal pa of CD, block positive free water clearance but has no effect on negative free water clearance. In hypervolumia DCT dilute the urine to decrease the volume overload -4 positive free water clearance --> blocked by thiazide. As thiazide diuretics no effect on medullary interstitium (in contrast to furosamide) so it does not effect the kidney's ability to concentrate urine during hypovolemia --4 no effect on negative free water. Two more options given in the question block free water clearance Vincristine Vincristine increases the secretion of the hormone A. D. H. Inreased A. D. H blocks free water clearance. Chlorpropamide Chlorpropamide sensitizes the kidney to ADH action. Thus it may impair the free water clearance and in some patients may result in hyponatremia and water intoxication. The impoant point to remember about chlorpropamide is that its action depends on small amount of ADH it won't act in the absence of ADH. Most probably the question should have been framed as \"All of the following blocks free water clearance, except\" But if you have to choose one answer, go for Furosemide as it will always block free water clearance whereas other drugs will cause them occasionally as their adverse effect.",

Alcohol. So the withdrawl symptoms can be initially controlled by replacing alcohol with any other C. N. S. depressant drug and subsequently the dose of the C. N. S. depressant can be tapered, Most of the C. N. S. depressant drugs are effective but benzodiazepenes have the highest margin of safety and lowest cost and are therefore the preferred class of drugs. Most clinicians use long acting benzodiazepenes such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam because sho acting benzodiazepenes can produce rapidly changing blood levels. Enough dose of chlordiazepoxide is administered on day one to allete symptoms and then the dose is gradually decreased. Also know T/T of patients with delirium tremens in Alcoholic withdrawl The impoant point to consider about delirium tremens is that the course is likely to continue for 3-5 days. High doses of benzodiazepenes are used. Sometimes antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol, ziprasidone or olanzapine have been used. T/T of patients with alcohol withdrawl seizures Benzodiazepenes are used. Use of anticonvulsants is not indicated. Drugs used in Rehabilitation of Alcoholics: Naltrexone It is a opioid-antagonistic drug. It decreases the feeling of pleasure on ingestion of Alcohol. Acamprosate It inhibits NMDA receptors.

B: Quinolone Betalactam antibiotics (penicillins and most of the cephalosporins) are safe during pregnancy Erythromycin base is safe but erythromycin estolate should be avoided Quinolones and fluoroquinolones They are chemotherapeutic bactericidal drugs, eradicating bacteria by interfering with DNA replication. Quinolones inhibit the bacterial DNA gyrase or the topoisomerase II enzyme, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and transcription. Quinolones can enter cells easily porins and, therefore, are often used to treat intracellular pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. For many Gram-negative bacteria, DNA gyrase is the target, whereas topoisomerase IV is the target for many Gram-positive bacteria. Theophylline, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and coicosteroids enhance the toxicity of fluoroquinolones. Products containing multivalent cations, such as aluminum- or magnesium-containing antacids and products containing calcium, iron, or zinc, invariably result in marked reduction of oral absorption of fluoroquinolones. Many fluoroquinolones, especially ciprofloxacin, inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP1. A2. This inhibition causes an increased level of, for example, antidepressants such as amitriptyline and imipramine, clozapine (an atypical antipsychotic), caffeine, olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic). Fluoroquinolones are well tolerated, with most side effects being mild to moderate. Some of the serious adverse effects that occur more commonly with fluoroquinolones than with other antibiotic drug classes include CNS and tendon toxicity. Fluoroquinolones are sometimes associated with an QTc interval prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias, convulsions, tendon rupture, torsade de pointes and hypoglycemia. Moxifloxacin carries a higher risk of QTc prolongation Gatifloxacin has been most frequently linked to disturbed blood sugar levels, although all quinolones carry these risks. Some quinolones were withdrawn from the market because of these adverse events (for example, sparfloxacin was associated with phototoxicity and QTc prolongation, thrombocytopenia and nephritis were seen with tosufloxacin, and hepatotoxicity with trovafloxacin). Fluoroquinolones are considered high-risk antibiotics for the development of Clostridium difficile and MRSA infections. The CNS is an impoant target for fluoroquinolone-mediated neurotoxicity. Moxifloxacin came out worst among the quinolones for causing CNS toxicity. Quinolones are contraindicated if a patient has epilepsy, QT prolongation, pre-existing CNS lesions, CNS inflammation or those who have suffered a stroke. There are safety concerns of fluoroquinolone use during pregnancy and, as a result, are contraindicated except for when no other safe alternative antibiotic exists.

Proguanil is considered safe for use during pregnancy. It is remarkably safe when used in conjunction with other antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, atovaquone, tetracyclines, and other antifolates. Quinine appears to be safe in pregnancy and is used commonly for the treatment of pregnancy-associated malaria but there is increased risk of hypoglycemia. There are increased rate of stillbihs with mefloquine use, especially during the first trimester. Pregnancy should be avoided for 3 months after mefloquine use because of the prolonged t1/2 of this agent.

        "question": "Regarding COX-2 which of the following is its function a. EUR'",
        "exp": "Cell proliferation??? The enzymes that conve arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 are named cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (original name was prostaglandin H synthase). The propeies of COX-1 are different from those of COX-2. It was originally thought that the. function of COX-1 was involved in physiological phenomena where as that of COX-2 was involved in various pathologies. COX-1 is considered as the constitutive enzyme or the housekeeping enzyme that is naturally expressed on all cell surfaces. COX-2 is known as inducible enzyme which is not naturally expressed on the cells but is expressed on stimulation of cells. Functions of COX-1 and COX-2 Inflammation During inflammation, COX-1 m. RNA, protein and activity levels do not change, but COX-2 levels increase dramatically, and as a result prostaglandin production increases. - Moreover, when COX-2 specific inhibitors are administered, prostaglandin production and subsequent inflammation are significantly reduced. - These data have lead to the conclusion that COX-2 is involved in inflammation whereas COX-1 is not. - During the inflammation process, COX-I is though to contribute to resolution. The COX-2 gene is paicularly responsive to mediators of inflammation. - For example, IL-la, IL-I b, TNF-a and LPS induce COX-2 gene expression and subsequent prostaglandin production. Therefore COX-2 inhibitors have been used to attenuate the symptoms of inflammation such as osteoahritis, rheumatoid ahritis and musculoskeletal pains. Cardiovascular system It is well known that the platelet has COX-1 protein alone (no COX-2). The thromboxane A2 produced COX-1 has an impoant role in thrombosis. - It has been thought that vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells have COX-1 and that prostacyclin formed COX-1 has an impoant role in blood flow, blood pressure and antiaggregation of platelets. However, a recent work has shown that prostacyclin in vascular cells is produced by COX-2 as well as COX-1 under both physiological and pathological conditions. - These results raised the possibility of an increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with COX-2 specific inhibitors. However, trials have not confirmed these results. Tumorigenesis COX-2 causes tumorigenesis and tumour growth. - Overexpression of COX-2 in tumor cells causes cells to escape from apoptosis and to invade the matrix. - The contribution of COX-2 to tumorigenesis is mainly through three processes. a) Induction of angiogenic, factors such as VEGF b) Antiapoptosis and c) Development of malignancy In vivo, tumour associated macrophages as well as tumor cells produce \"PGE2 COX-2\" and the PGE2 produced, induces VEGF and finally VEGF stimulates angiogenesis. Renal function COX-1 is primarily expressed in podocytes and collecting duct cells and is involved in glomerulogenesis. COX-2 is detected in renal vasculature, medullary interstitial cells and the macula densa. COX-2 is involved in renal perfusion and glomerular hemodynamics. Cyclooxygenase function can also be assessed by disrupting COX-1 and COX-2 genes in mice COX-2 deficient mice demonstrates following:- Defect in female reproductive functions including ovulation, feilization and implantation and decidualization Reduction in brain injury induced by ischemia Suppression of tumorigenesis Renal nephropathy Cardiac. fibrosis Peritonitis Failure of ductus aeriosus closure Even after this extensive discussion, 1 am not sure about the answer. Since COX-2 has a role in the development of twnorigenesis, cell proliferation seems to be the appropriate answer. COX-2 causes tumorigenesis by induction of VEGF. VEGF is vascular endothelial growth factor and it causes endothelial proliferation. We are not sure of the answer. Go through the. following sites on internet. http//www. ncbi. nlm. gov/pubmed/18039779; http/Avvvw. ncbi. nlin. nih. gov/pubmed/12045254; Jun invest 2002 June 109 (11/1405=15); www. ncbi. nlm. gov/pubmed/16219005; http//www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pubmed/12444028 COX-2 seems to regulate all the, functions mentioned in the question. We have looked into numerous texts and internet sites for this one. But we cannot come up with some conclusive material on this one.

        "exp": "The laboratory results indicate that the aerial pH, aerial PCO2, and plasma HCO3- concentrations are all low. These changes clearly demonstrate metabolic acidosis, which occurs commonly when a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is administered. The carbonic anhydrase enzyme attached to the brush border of the tubular epithelial cells normally catalyzes the dissociation of carbonic acid into water and carbon dioxide. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase prevents the removal of bicarbonate ions from the tubular fluid, which initially increases urine pH. The result is heavy spillage of bicarbonate in the urine, which is the hallmark of type 2 A (renal tubular acidosis). However, once the plasma levels of bicarbonate have decreased sufficiently, the bicarbonaturia ceases and the plasma HCO3- levels stabilize at a lower than normal level. Consequently, the urine pH falls typically to 4. 5-5. 0.",

PRL also has a luteolytic effect, generating a shoened, or inadequate, luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In men, attenuated LH secretion leads to low testosterone levels and decreased spermatogenesis. These hormonal changes decrease libido and reduce feility in patients with hyperprolactinemia.

Alanine It is an alpha-adrenergic agonist (selective for alpha-2-adrenergic receptors) psychoactive drug used as a sympatholytic or antihypeensive. It continues to have a role in otherwise difficult to treat hypertension and gestational hypertension (also known as pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH)). Methyldopa is used in the clinical treatment of the following disorders: - Hypertension - Gestational hypertension (or pregnancy-induced hypertension) and pre-eclampsia Methyldopa has a dual mechanism of action: - It is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase, also known as aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, which conves L-DOPA into dopamine. - Dopamine is a precursor for norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and subsequently epinephrine (adrenaline). - This inhibition results in reduced dopaminergic and adrenergic neurotransmission in the peripheral nervous system. - This effect may lower blood pressure and cause central nervous system effects such as depression, anxiety, apathy, anhedonia, and parkinsonism. - It is conveed to alpha-methylnorepinephrine by dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH). - Alpha-methylnorepinephrine is an agonist of presynaptic central nervous system alpha-2-adrenergic receptors. - Activation of these receptors in the brainstem appears to inhibit sympathetic nervous system output and lower blood pressure. This is also the mechanism of action of clonidine. Methyldopa exhibits variable absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. It is metabolized in the liver and intestines and is excreted in urine. Side effects may include: - Psychological Depression and/or even suicidal ideation, as well as nightmares Decreased aleness, awareness, and wakefulness Cognitive and memory impairment Derealization and/or depersonalization, as well as mild psychosis Physiological Miosis Xerostomia Gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea and/or constipation Myalgia or muscle aches, ahralgia or joint pain, and/or paresthesia (\"pins and needles\") Restless legs syndrome (RLS) Parkinsonian symptoms such as muscle tremors, rigidity, hypokinesia, and/or balance or postural instability Akathisia, ataxia, dyskinesia as well as even tardive dyskinesia, and/or dystonia Bell's palsy or facial paralysis Sexual dysfunction consisting of impaired erectile dysfunction and/or anorgasmia Hyperprolactinemia or excess prolactin, gynecomastia/breast enlargement in males, and/or amenorrhoea or absence of menstrual cycles in females Bradycardia Ohostatic hypotension (also known as postural hypotension) Hepatitis, hepatotoxicity Pancreatitis Haemolytic anemia Myelotoxicity or bone marrow suppression Lichenoid reactions such as skin lesions and/or rashes",

Hepatic lipase - Conves IDL to LDL by hydrolysing the triglyceride content of IDL. Hormone sensitive lipase - Present intracellularly in peripheral tissue and causes intracellular lipolysis by hydrolysing triglycerides. Niacin (Nicotinic acid) inhibits intracellular lipolysis by inhibiting hormone sensitive lipase- intracellular FFA to liver- triglyceride synthesis. Niacin also increases the activity of lipoprotein lipase- T hydrolysis of VLDL triglyceride. Nicotinic acid also reduces the production of VLDL in liver by inhibiting TG-synthesis - indirectly the VLDL degradation products IDL and LDL are also reduced. Nicotinic acid is the most effective drug to raise HDL-CH. Increased HDL is due to interference of direct pathway of HDL cholesterol to liver which involves apo-A, - Niacin decreases apo-A, mediated hepatic clearance.

Mechanism of action In organophosphate poisoning esteratic site of cholinesterase is phosphorylated and anionic site is free. Phosphorylated cholinesterase reacts very slowly with water. However, if more reactive OH groups in the form of oximes are provided, reactivation occurs more than a million time faster. Oximes attach to anionic site and provide more reactive OH groups. Oximes are ineffective in Carbamates poisoning. Pralidoxime is contraindicated in carbamates poisoning, because not only it does not reactivate carbamylated enzyme, it has weak anti-chE activity of its own. Remember Obidoxime is more potent than pralidoxime. Pralidoxime and obidoxime are lipid insoluble, while diacetyl-monoxime (DAM) is lipid soluble so it can cross BBB and regenerate AChE in brain.

Management of anxiety associated with depression. Management of symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Insomnia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other somatic symptoms associated with anxiety. Used as an adjunct with acute mania, acute psychosis. Actions. Acts at many levels in the CNS to produce anxiolytic effect. May produce CNS depression. Effects may be mediated by GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Contra-indicated in. Hypersensitivity. Cross-sensitivity with other benzodiazepines may exist. Pre-existing CNS depression. Severe uncontrolled pain. Angle-closure glaucoma, obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary disease. Pregnancy and lactation. Concurrent itraconazole or ketoconazole. Lactation: Use in pregnancy or lactation may cause CNS depression, flaccidity, feeding difficulties, and seizures in infant. Use cautiously in. Renal Impairment, Hepatic dysfunction. Concurrent use with nefazodone, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, fluoxetine, hormonal contraceptives, propoxyphene, diltiazem, isoniazid, erythromycin, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice. History of suicide attempt or alcohol/drug dependence, debilitated patients. Pediatric age: Safety and efficacy not established. Decreased dosage and frequent monitoring required. Geriatric age: Elderly patients have increased sensitivity to benzodiazepines. Appears on Beers list and is associated with increased risk of falls and excessive CNS effects. Interactions.
