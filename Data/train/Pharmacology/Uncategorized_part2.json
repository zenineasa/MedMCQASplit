Synthetic (phase II or conjugation) reaction Metabolism involves the union of the drug with one of several polar (water-soluble) endogenous molecules that are products of intermediary metabolism, to form a water-soluble conjugate which is readily eliminated by kidney or, if the molecular weight exceeds 300, in the bile. Phase II metabolism almost invariably terminates biological activity, i. e. metabolites are usually inactive. Reactions are:- 1. Acetylation 2. Glucuronide conjugation 3. Glycine conjugation 4.

It increases effective refractory period-ERP (Le refractoriness) of A-V node by direct, vagomimetic and antiadrenergic action - the minimum interval between consecutive impulses that can successfully traverse the conducting tissue is increased. 2. A degree of A-V block is naturally established in AF. Because of the relatively long ERP of A-V node, many atrial impulses impinge on it while it is still refractory; others falling early in the relative refractory period get extinguished by decremental conduction - These concealed impulses leave upper margin ofA-V node refractory for a fuher period. Thus, any influence which increases atrial rate in AF (e. g. digitalis), by itself reduces ventricular rate. o Inhibition of Na+ K+ ATPase is responsible for inotropic action of digitalis, not for antiarrhythmic action. o Digitalis has two impoant pharmacological actions - I.

The entropy of a closed system will tend to increase to a maximum value. Whereas entropy in a biologic system does not increase as it is an open system. Entropy is a measure of the amount of molecular disorder within a closed system. A system that has a high degree of molecular disorder (such as high temperature gas) has a very high entropy value, whereas those with a very low degree of molecular disorder (such as crystalline solid) has a very low entropy value. An entropy value of zero is found in a system which has all its atoms arranged in a perfectly ordered manner.

Roxithromycin, Clarithromycin and Azithromycin are the later additions. Interestingly, the nonantibiotic macrolides: tacrolimus, pimecrolimus and sirolimus also possess immunomodulatory properties. The antibiotic effects of macrolides are mediated by inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis, through inhibition of peptidyltransferase activity. They have been frequently used in the past for treating many upper respiratory tract infections including GAS pharyngitis with adequate efficacy (>90%). Their effects on immunomodulation appear to extend beyond their antimicrobial actions as they have been shown to mitigate cytokine production in animal studies and human trials. While its antibiotic properties have been attributed to mechanisms shared by other macrolides, AZM has been shown to act primarily on the lymphokine CD4 Th1 cell line reducing the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-6, and increasing the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in macrophage cell lines after stimulation with a combination of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IFN-\u03b3. The immunomodulatory potential of AZM is not limited to suppression of production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, it also suppresses i. NOS-mediated nitric oxide production. These agents also work at a molecular level, decreasing m. RNA expression thereby promoting apoptosis of inflammatory cells and a decrease in nuclear transcription factors.",

Serotonin syndrome is due to acute overstimulation of 5-HT2A receptors caused by serotonergic drugs like SSRI (Drugs causing serotonin syndrome have been explained) Treatment of Serotonin Syndrome o Treatment of patients with serotonin syndrome begins with suppoive care and decreasing muscle rigidity. o Because muscle rigidity is thought to be paly responsible for hypehermia and death, external cooling in conjunc? tion with aggressive use of benzodiazepines should limit complication and moality. In severe cases, neuromuscular Mocker should be considered to achieve rapid muscle relaxation. Use of Cyproheptadine in patients with mild/moderate serotonin syndrome has shown effective serotonin blockage and control of symptoms. Other drugs that are antedotally repoed to be successful for the treatement of symptoms of serotonin syndrome include methysergide, chlorpromazine, atypical antipsychotics and propranolol. In most patients, the serotonin syndrome resolves within 24 hours after the offending drug is removed. o Aggressive cooling and sedation with a benzodiazepine remain the basis of therapy.",

All the insulin secretagogus increase insulin secretion from the pancreas through the same mechanism i. e., by interfering with potassium channel. All the insulin secretagogues have the potential to cause profound and persistent hypoglycemia especially in elderly individuals. Hypoglycemia is usually related to delayed meals, increased physical activity, alcohol intake or renal insufficiency. Individuals who ingest an overdose of some agents develop prolong and serious hypoglycemia and should he monitored closely in the hospital. Thiazolidinediones (Pioglitazone) Thiazolidinediones are considered \"eguglycemics\" and are efficacious in about 70% new users. Combination therapy of thiazolidinediones with sulfonyureas or insulin can lead to hypoglycemia and may require close adjustment. Biguanides (Metformin Phenformin) Biguanides lower glucose among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus largely by decreasing hepatic glucose output. It is also thought to increase glucose uptake by skeletal muscles. Because insulin secretion is unaltered hypoglycemia is not a side effect of metf. Ormin used as monotherapy. Alpha Glucosidase inhibitors (Acarbose) Lowers glucose by inhibiting intestinal enzymes that digest carbohydrate there by reducing carbohydrate digestion. Because of its mechanism of action, acarbose, when administered alone does not cause hypoglecemia in the fasting or postprandial states.

Therefore, the drugs which prevent degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators of mast cells can be used for long term prophylaxis in mild to moderate asthma. These drugs are ineffective in acute attack of asthma as degranulation of mast cells with release of inflammatory mediators has already occured. Sodium cromoglycate and nedocromil are mast cell stabilizers. Nedocromil has additional antihistaminic action, thus it is especially indicated in patient with multiple disorders (asthma, atopic dermatitis, conjuctivitis, rhinitis, uicaria and food allergy). Sodium cromoglycate is not absorbed orally, therefore it is used by inhalational route. Ketotifen is absorbed orally and is used by this route.",

This includes decreased renal perfusion, leading to decrease in urine output. o When the patient is being treated, main aim is to improve perfusion; not just to raise blood pressure. o Dopamine dilates the renal blood vessels and improves renal perfusion, therefore it is preferred in the shock. o However you should keep in mind that dopamine is preferred in shock due to this advantageous effect, i. e., renal venodilatory effect. But the primary mechanism of action which is responsible for the improvement in shock is positive chronotropic effect. o The primary defect is decreased cardiac output with inadequate tissue perfusion. o Therefore the primary mechanism of action of the drugs used in shock is to increase cardiac output by increasing the cardiac force of contraction (i. e., inotropic effect). o Dopamine has additional benefit, i. e., it dilates renal vessels. Therefore dopamine is preferred in shock. o From above discussion, you can understand that two question can be framed. (i) Primary mechanism of action of dopamine in shock --) Ionotropic effect (Cardiac stimulation/increased cardiac output). (ii) Dopamine is preferred in shock --) Because it has renal venodilatory effect. o Following statement will clear your doubt. \"An advantage of using dopamine in the treatment of shock is that its inotropic action increases cardiac output while dilating renal blood vessels and thereby increasing renal blood flow\" Modern pharmacology with clinical application. \"Dopamine is used in cardiogenic shock. Dopamine is an effective inotropic agent that causes less increase in heart rate (less chronotropic effect)\".

Like other sulphonylureas, chlorpropamide acts to increase the secretion of insulin, so it is only effective in patients who have some pancreatic beta cell function. It can cause relatively long episodes of hypoglycemia; this is one reason why shoer-acting sulfonylureas such as gliclazide or tolbutamide are used instead. The risk of hypoglycemia makes this drug a poor choice for the elderly and patients with mild to moderate hepatic and renal impairment. Chlorpropamide and other sulphonylureas encourage weight gain, so they are generally not ored for use in very obese patients. Metformin is considered a better drug for these patients. Sulfonylureas should be avoided in patients with hepatic and renal impairment, patients with porphyria, patients who are breastfeeding, and patients with ketoacidosis. Not indicated for patients more than 65 years of age. It may cause facial flushing after the ingestion of alcohol.

The main adverse effects of inhaled steroids are caused by the deposition of the drug in the upper airways, resulting in dysphonia, oropharyngeal candidiasis, and cough. These effects may be reduced by rinsing the mouth and use of a spacer device. Systemic adverse effects are clinically relevant only at doses more than 600 microgram/day. They include adrenal suppression, osteoporosis, growth suppression, skin thinning, and easy bruising. Inhaled coicosteroids use is associated with the development of posterior subcapsular and nuclear cataracts. Inhaled steroids are safe during pregnancy.",

Endoscopic surgery has been shown to be useful especially in patients who are deemed high risk and too unwell for reconstructive surgery. One of the main drawbacks of endoscopic tit and surgery is the risk of recurrence of tracheal stenosis due to granulation and fibrotic tissue. Scar formation and restenosis is the main cause. Studies have shown that most of the recurrence of tracheal stenosis occurs within one to three months after the procedure and use of mitomycin C has been repoed in case studies to reduce the rate of recurrence. - Both in vitro and invivo mitomycin C has been proved to be a potent inhibitor of human fibroblasts at concentrations of. 04 mg/L Topical mitomycin C is a useful adjunct in the management of sho concentric membranous stenosis which does not involve the cailage.",

Ivermectin and other avermectins (insecticides most frequently used in home-use ant baits) are macrocyclic lac tones derived from the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis. Ivermectin kills by interfering with nervous system and muscle function, in paicular by enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission. The drug binds and activates glutamate-gated chloride channels (Glu. Cls). Glu. Cls are inveebrate-specific members of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels present in neurons and myocytes. Ivermectin can be given either by mouth or injection. It does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier The main concern is neurotoxicity, which manifest as central nervous system depression, and consequent ataxia, as might be expected from potentiation of inhibitory GABA-ergic synapses. It is traditionally used against worms. It is mainly used in humans in the treatment of onchocerciasis, but is also effective against other worm infestations (such as strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, trichuriasis, filariasis, enterobiasis and some epidermal parasitic skin diseases (EPSDs) including scabies.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Duration of action of aspirin is primarily related to pharmacokinetic clearance of the drug form the body Inhibition of COX by Aspirin o Aspirin inhibits COX irreversibly by acetylating one of its serine residues; return of COX activity depends on synthesis offresh enzyme (not on the pharmacokinetic clearance of the drug). On the other hand, Other NSAIDs are competitive and reversible inhibitors of COX, return of activity depends on their dissociation from the enzyme which in turn is governed by the pharmakokinetic clearance from the body. o Duration of action of aspirin is dependent on synthesis of fresh COX. o Duration of action of other NSAIDs is dependent on pharmakinetic clearance of the drug from the body. o Salicylates are salts of salicylic acid, e. g., methyl saiicylate, sodium salicylate, acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin). Salicylates are rapidly metabolized to salicylic acid which is the active form (reduces PG synthesis). However, in contrast to aspirin, salicylic acid has no acetylating capacity (as it does not contain acetyl group). Therefore, it inactivates the COX reversibly (irreversible inhibition requires acetylation of COX). Antiplatelet action of aspirin o Antiplatelet effect of low dose aspirin is related to presystemic inhibition of cyclooxygenase. Aspirin inhibits the synthesis of TXA2 in platelets as well as PGI2 in vessels wall by inhibiting enzyme cyclooxygenase. However, at low doses aspirin has platelet antiaggregatory effect due to inhibition of synthesis of TXA2 because:? i) Platelets are exposed to aspirin in the poal circulation before it is deacetylated during first pass metabolism (presystemic metabolism) in liver. Here it inactivates COX and inhibits the synthesis of TXA2 As aspirin is metabolized in liver very little aspirin reaches the systemic circulation to inhibit PGI2 synthesis. ii) Aspirin irreversibly inhibit cycloxygenase of platelets. Platelets do not have nuclei, they cannot synthesize fresh enzyme. Therefore, low doses of aspirin suppresses TXA2 formation till fresh platelets are formed. On the other hand, intimal cells (endothelium) of vessel wall can synthesize fresh COX, activity returns rapidly and PGI2 synthesis restas rapidly.",

Pulmonary circulation is unique in that it accommodates a blood flow that is almost equal to that of all the other organs of body but still maintains low pressure. The factors responsible for low pressure in pulmonary circulation (even with large volume of blood) are:- - Larger diameter of pulmonary vessels due to thin wall of pulmonary aery and aerioles. - Greater compliance (distensibility) of pulmonary vessels. numoral factors responsible for maintaining pulmonary circulation:?

Mechanism of Action The bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals of bone. (The bisphosphonates have a strong affinity for bone, targeting especially bone surfaces undergoing remodeling) When osteoclasts first attach to bone in the active resorptive sites, the bisphosphonates are released from that hone. The release of these compounds locally prevents fuher osteoclastic attachment to those resorptive surfaces. The bisphosphonates also may inhibit resorption by inducing apoptosis of osteoclasts and by inhibiting release of interleukins and other compounds involved in bone resorption. The net result of action of these compounds is inhibition of bone osteoclastic resorption. Uses They are used extensively in conditions characterized by osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. including - Osteoporosis (postmenopausal osteoporosis, idiopathic and steroid induced osteoporosis) - Paget's disease, - Osteolytic bone metastasis, and - Hypercalcemia of malignancy Recent evidence suggests that second- and third-generation bisphosphonates also may be effective anticancer drugs. (May have some use in prostate cancer) Currently three bisphosphonates are available in India- Etidronate, Pamidronate and Alendronate. ** Other bisphosphonates, not yet available in India are Tiludronate, Risedronate, Zolendronate and lbandronate.",

They usually result from inadequate carbohydrate consumption, unusual physical exeion, or too large a dose of insulin. Injection of animal insulin preparations sometimes led to atrophy of subcutaneous fatty tissue at the site of injection. Since the development of human and analog insulin preparations of neutral pH, this type of immune complication is almost never seen. Lipohyperophy (enlargement of subcutaneous fat depots) has been ascribed to the lipogenic action of high local concentrations of insulin. Insulin allergy, an immediate type hypersensitivity, is a rare condition in which local or systemic uicaria results from histamine release from tissue mast cells sensitized by anti-insulin IgE antibodies.

It is colourless and pleasant-smelling, but unstable in light. It is packaged in dark-coloured bottles and contains 0. 01% thymol as a stabilising agent. It is a potent anaesthetic. It is not a good analgesic or muscle relaxant; however it potentiates competitive neuromuscular blockers. Repeated exposure to halothane in adults results in severe liver injury (Halothane hepatitis) due to the metabolism of halothane to trifluoroacetic acid oxidative reactions in the liver. All volatile anaesthetics such as halothane can trigger malignant hypehermia in genetically susceptible individuals. Its propeies include cardiac depression at high levels, cardiac sensitisation to catecholamines such as norepinephrine, and potent bronchial relaxation. Its lack of airway irritation made it a common inhalation induction agent in pediatric anaesthesia. Due to its cardiac depressive effect, it is contraindicated in patients with cardiac failure. Halothane is also contraindicated in patients susceptible to cardiac arrythmias, or in situations related to high catecholamine levels such as pheochromocytoma.",

She indicates that after having a new chef at home 3 months ago, she did not feel it necessary to check her blood glucose since the food is \"so healthy\" at the home. Which of the following methods of blood glucose monitoring, as a single measurement, would provide an overview of the average blood glucose level over the past several weeks?",
        "exp": "This question examines a common problem found in clinical practice. The gist of the problem is that patients often do not follow physician orders. With respect to the treatment of diabetes, an essential goal in diabetes management is the improvement of blood glucose control towards euglycemia throughout a patient's day. Improved levels of metabolic control have already been shown to decrease the morbidity associated with diabetes. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), a landmark multicenter trial, demonstrated that any improvement in blood glucose control towards euglycemia is associated with both a delay in the onset and progression of existing long-term complications associated with diabetes. In the case of the DCCT, carefully controlled blood glucose levels can be obtained at all times of the day with the use of multiple insulin injections. This treatment approach mimicked how the pancreas varies the amount of insulin secreted at different times of the day in response to meals and during periods of fasting. Although the benefits of achieving and maintaining good blood glucose control are now clear, diabetes is a self-managed disease where many challenges still remain for patients seeking to improve the quality of their lives and reduce the risk of developing complications. Therefore, it is essential that for patients with diabetes, physicians and other healthcare providers learn how to properly perform and appropriately monitor daily blood glucose levels, so that informed decisions can be made on how to follow treatment regimens recommended by their healthcare team. The glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb. A1c) reflects the patient's mean blood glucose level over the past six to eight weeks. In non-diabetics, 4-6% of the total hemoglobin is Hb. A1c. A change of 1% can equal a 25-40 mg/dL change in the mean blood glucose. This test is often used as an adjunct to patient Home Blood Glucose Monitoring (HBGM). The fasting plasma glucose (FPG) is primarily used by hospitals. Whole blood concentrations are 15% lower than FPG. Home Blood Glucose Monitoring (HBGM) helps the patient achieve euglycemia throughout the day. It instantly accesses the effect of dietary intake, drugs, exercise and illness on blood glucose levels. Some of the disadvantages of this method are that it is invasive, expensive and technical. Urine glucose tests correlate poorly with blood glucose levels and represents blood glucose \"hours ago\". They are beneficial in patients who cannot perform invasive HBGM technique.",

It has more prominent effect on upper GIT- increases gastric peristalsis, while relaxing the pylorus and the first pa of duodenum - speed gastric emptying. Tone of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is increased and gastroesophageal reflux opposed. But has no significant action on colonic motility. An effective antiemetic. Mechanism of action. I. 5-HT4agonism - stimulation of 5-HT4 receptor in GIT enhances the release of ACH from myenteric plexus - Main prokinetic action of metoclopropamide is due to this action. D2 antagonism - Blockade of D2 receptor in CTZ is mainly responsible for antiemetic effect. D2 receptor blockade in GIT is responsible for some prokinetic action also. Adverse effects - Sedation, dizziness, loose stools, muscle dystonia (especially in children) are the main side effects. D2 -blocking action may cause extrapyramidal symptoms (Akathsia, Parkinsonism) and hyperprolactinemia (galactorrhea, gynacomastia).",

Clomiphene citrate is a potent anti-estrogen that primarily is used for treatment of anovulation in the setting of an intact hypothalamic--pituitary axis and adequate estrogen production (e. g., PCOS). By inhibiting the negative feedback effects of estrogen at hypothalamic and pituitary levels, clomiphene increases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels--typically by ~50%--and thereby enhances follicular maturation. Clomiphene s approved for the treatment of infeility in anovulatory women. Clomiphene increases gonadotropin secretion and stimulates ovulation. It increases the amplitude of LH and FSH pulses without changing pulse frequency. This suggests that the drug is acting largely at the pituitary level to block inhibitory actions of estrogen on gonadotropin release from the gland and/or is somehow causing the hypothalamus to release larger amounts of Gn.

The enlargement of the aerial channels presses on the veins situated in these structures preventing outflow of blood through them. The collection of blood in the distensile channels due to aerial dilatation leads to penile erection. Erection is mediated by parasympathetic nerves (S2, S3, S4) and non adrenergic and noncholinergic pathways which induces release of NO from endothelium in penile vasculature. NO induces vascular smooth muscle relaxation allowing enhancement of blood flow leading to erection. The primary drugs used in erectile dysfunction e. g. Slidenafil, Tadalafil and Vardenfil act on Nitric oxide pathway to improve erectile dysfunction. Nitric oxide mediates its action by increasing c. GMP concentration. c. GMP is finally degraded by an enzyme phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). Slidenafil and other oral agents are inhibitors of phosphodiesterase enzyme (PDE-5). These enzymes inhibits PDE-5 and thus they reduce the degradation of c. GMP. Increased c. GMP facilitates the relaxation of distensile channels of penis.

Inhibition of this enzyme slows the absorption of carbohydrates from the GI tract and blunts the rate of rise of postprandial plasma glucose. These drugs also increase the release of the glucoregulatory hormone GLP-1 into the circulation, which may contribute to their glucose-lowering effects. Alpha-Glucosidase inhibitors have been demonstrated to reduce the progression from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes. The most prominent adverse effects related to alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are malabsorption, flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal bloating. In some studies acarbose has shown to reduce fibrinogen levels: Acarbose improves fibrinolytic activity in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. Acarbose decreases plasma level of plasminogen activator inhibitor and fibrinogen. Ref: Powers A. C., D'Alessio D. (2011). Chapter 43.

This drugs have a bronchodilator action of >12 hours and also protect against bronchoconstriction for a similar period. Albuterol is a sho acting selective 2 receptor agonist with pharmacological propeies and therapeutic indications similar to those of terbutaline. It is administered either by inhalation or orally for the symptomatic relief of bronchospasm. Pirbuterol is a sho acting and relatively selective 2 agonist. Its structure is identical to albuterol except for the substitution of a pyridine ring for the benzene ring. Pirbuterol acetate is available for inhalation therapy; dosing is typically every 4-6 hours. Pirbuterol is the only preparation available in a breath-activated meter-dose inhaler, a device meant to optimize medication delivery by releasing a spray of medication only on the patient's initiation of inspiration. Orciprenaline is a sho acting 2 adrenergic agonist. It is considered to be 2-selective, although it probably is less selective than albuterol or terbutaline and hence is more prone to cause cardiac stimulation. Ref: Westfall T. C., Westfall D. P.

Its contraction causes micturition. The other smooth muscle that plays an impoant role in micturition is the internal sphincter. Internal sphincter is a concentraction of smooth muscle at the bladder neck. It is well developed only in males and its principal. function is to prevent retrograde. flow of semen during ejaculation. When detrusor relaxes and the sphincters close urine is stored. Whereas voiding requires contraction of destrusor accompanied by relaxation of sphincters. Detrusor is innervated mainly by parasympathetic nerves which are excitatory and cause the muscle to contract where as internal sphincter is rich in aI adrenoreceptor (sympathetic nerves). Thus the mechanisms of urine voiding involves:? - Increased parasympathetic drive Contracts the detrusor - Decreased sympathetic drive Relax the sphincter Detrusor instability or unstable bladder is characterized by uninhibited, unstable contractions of the detrusor which may be of unknown etiology or secondary to an upper motor neuron lesion or bladder neck obstruction. Since detrusor contracts under parasympathetic influence, Anticholinergic (specifically antimuscarinic) drugs are used to treat overactive bladder disease or detrusor instability. These agents lower intravesical pressure, increase capacity and reduce the frequency of contractions by antagonizing para. sympa- thetic control of bladder. These agents include:? - Darifenacin - Solefenacin - Tolterodine - Trospium chloride - Oxybutynin - Solifenacin - Flavoxate Duloxetine is used in stress incontinence. It is a dual norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Its mechanism of action is thought to be centrally, by increasing urethral sphincter tone and contractility. It can be used in mixed incontinence. Comparison of different drugs used for treatment of Detrusor instability Drug Benefits Weaknesses * Generic oxvbutynin - Cheap - Recommended by NICE well established Poorly tolerated * Slow release oxybutynin - Improved side-effect profile - Escalating does regimen possible More expensive than immediate release * Oxyhutynin patches - Reduced side - effect profile Patches may cause skin Irritation limiting use * Flavoxate - Less side effects than Oxybutinn i Less offecting * Tolterodine - First of newer anticholinergics - Robust trial evidence Trial suggests not as effective as olifenacin * Trosplum - Does not cross blood- brain barrier - May have benefits in the elderly or patients with polypharmacy Broad spectrum anticholinergic side effects * Propiverine - Calcium antagonist action Recommended for frequency but not urge incontinence * Solifenacin - STAR study suggests some benefits over tolterodine at normal does Commonest side effect-dry mouth * Darifenacin - M3 selective Limited direct clinical experience outside of trials",

How does digitalis decrease heart rate? o Heart rate is decreased by digitalis mainly in patients with CHF.

Voriconazole is administered by i. v. and oral routes. It is formulated as lyophilized powder, for solution for i. v. infusion as well as tablets and powder for suspension for oral administration. Uses of Voriconazole Varoconazole is a broad spectrum azole. It can be used in all diseases where azoles are effective. It is especially used for? Invasive aspergillosisQ In patients with invasive aspergillosis, initial therapy with voriconazole led to better responses and improved survival and resulted in. fewer side effects than the standard approach of initial therapy with amphotericin B. Emerging fungal pathogensQ Voriconazole is used in the primary treatment of amphotericin B and fluconazole resistant fungal infections e. g., Fusarium, Scendosporium. Patients with neutropenia and feverQ Pts with neutropenia and fever are often treated empirically with AMB or liposomal AMB to prevent invasive fungal infections. Voriconazole is a suitable alternative to AMB preparation for empirical antifungal therapy in patients with neutropenia and persistent fever.

Antithyroid drugs are the t/t of choice; radioactive iodine is clearly contraindicated in pregnancy. Historically, propylthiouracil has been preferred over methimazole because transplacental spread was though to be lower, however, it has been proved that propylthiouracial and methimazole cross the placenta equally. As clearance of these drugs is very slow in the fetus, they tend to accumulate with the risk of fetal hypothyroidism and goitrogenesis. Current datas suggest that either may be used safely in the pregnant patients. The antithyroid drug dose should be minimal in order to keep the serum free thyroxine index in the upper half of the normal range. As pregnancy progresses, graves disease often improves and it is not uncommon for patients either to be on very low doses or off antithyroid drugs completely by the end of pregnancy. Propylthiouracil is the drug of choice in nursing women since very small amounts of the drug appear in the breast milk, and do not appear to affect thyroid function in the suckling baby.

It is used in toxicology for the treatment of prolonged recurrent hypoglycemia after sulfonylurea and possibly meglitinides overdose. Octreotide has also been used with varying degrees of success in infants with nesidioblastosis to help decrease insulin hypersecretion. In patients with suspected esophageal varices, octreotide can be given to help decrease bleeding. Octreotide may be useful in the treatment of thymic neoplasms. It has been used in the treatment of malignant bowel obstruction. Octreotide may be used in conjunction with midodrine to paially reverse peripheral vasodilation in the hepato-renal syndrome.

        "question": "Increased prolactin is associated with:",
        "exp": "Increased estradial Prolactin is a polypeptide produced by the lactotrophs of the pituitary. It is responsible. for the initiation and maintenance of lactation. As with several pituitary hormones, prolactin is secreted in a circadian, fashion with the highest levels being attained during sleep and a nadir occurring between 10 am and noon. Prolactin is secreted in a pulsatile. fashion, the amplitude and frequency of which not only varies throughout the day but is also impacted upon by a variety of physiology stimuli i. e., suckling, stress and increased level of ovarian steroids primarily estrogens. \"The general view is that lactotrophs have spontaneously high secretary activity\". Therefore pituitary prolactin secretion is under a tonic and predominantly inhibitory control exeed by the hypothalamus. - Hypothalmus releases prolactin inhibitory factor (PIF) which inhibits prolactin release. - PIE is actually dopamine and it suppresses prolactin synthesis and secretion by means of D2 receptors. - These actions constitute the physiologic basis of therapeutic effect of dopamine agonists in hyperprolactinemia. Prolactin acts on the breast tissue where in the setting of estrogen priming, it stimulates lactation. Effect of physiological hormones on prolactin secretion Glucocoicoids seem to have an inhibitory role on PRL secretion. - These hormones stimulate the differentiation of somatotrophs but suppress that of lactotrophs. - Long-term elevation of the serum glucocoicoid levels by chronic administration of coicotrophin (ACTH) or hydrocoisone or by prolonged stress decreases PRL secretion. Estrogens and thyroid hormones have opposite effects on PRL synthesis and release. - \"Estrogen increases prolactin levelQ by acting at both pituitary and hypothalamic level\" - At pituitary level it increases prolactin secretion by controlling PRL gene expression and modifying its sensitivity to physiological stimuli. - At hypothalamic level it inhibits the activity of all three types of hypothalamic neuroendocrine dopaminergic neurone. - Low thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels increase TRH-induced PRL secretion, whereas high T4 and T3 levels inhibit PRL m. RNA accumulation and release. An impoant point Increased estrogen causes hyperprolactinemia But Hyperprolactinemia causes decrease in estrogen Prolactin also acts at the hypothalamus to inhibit the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (Gn. RH). - Inhibition of Gn. RH results in a decrease in the release of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary. In females - This leads to decreased in estrogen and progesterone synthesis and secretion by the ovaries and a failure of ovarian. follicular maturation. In males - This leads to decrease in testicular production and synthesis of testosterone and a halt in spermatogenesis.
