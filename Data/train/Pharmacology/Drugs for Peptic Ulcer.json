        "question": "Why should one avoid combination of Ranitidine and Sucralfate in a patient of Peptic Ulcer Disease?",
        "exp": "The Acidic nature of the stomach is necessary for the action of Sucralfate as Sucralfate polymerizes at a pH<4 (acidic). The sticky gel-like consistency of it is due to crosslink formation within the molecule at acidic pH. Simultaneous use of H2 receptor blocker results in decrease acid production in the stomach, leading to increase in pH of the stomach which would prevent polymerization of Sucralfate in stomach, causing Failure of treatment. Sucralfate also binds bile salts; thus, some clinicians use Sucralfate to treat individuals with the syndromes of Biliary esophagitis or Gastritis (the existence of which is controversial).",

Due to increasing treatment failures attributable to rising Clarithromycin resistance, \"Quadruple therapy\" is now recommended as first-line treatment for patients who likely have Clarithromycin resistance due to prior exposure or to residence in regions with high clarithromycin resistance. Two 14-day treatment regimens currently are recommended. Each includes a PPI twice daily with either: (a) Bismuth subsalicylate 524mg, Metronidazole 500mg, and Tetracycline 500 mg, all given Four times daily; (b) Amoxicillin 1g, Clarithromycin 500mg, and Metronidazole 500 mg, all given Twice daily. After completion of antibiotic therapy, the PPI should be continued once daily for a total of 4-6 weeks to ensure complete ulcer healing.",
