        "exp": "IMIDAZOLES AND TRIAZOLES: These are presently the most extensively used antifungal drugs. Four irnidazoles are entirely topical, while ketoconazole is used both orally and topically. Two triazoles fluconazole and itraconazole have largely replaced ketoconazole for systemic mycosis because of greater efficacy, longer tlh, fewer side effects and drug interactions. The imidazoles and triazoles have broadspectrum antifungal activity covering dermatophytes, Candida, other fungi involved in deep mycosis (except mucor), Nocardia, some grampositive and anaerobic bacteria, e. g. Staph. aureus, Strep. faecal is, Bac. fragilis and Leishmania. The mechanism of action of irnidazoles and triazoles is the same. They inhibit the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme &; lanosterol l4--demethylase&; and thus impair ergosterol synthesis leading to a cascade of membrane abnormalities in the fungus. The lower host toxicity of triazoles compared to irnidazoles has correlated with their lower affinity for mammalian CYP450 enzymes and lesser propensity to inhibit mammalian sterol synthesis. However, because they are active against ceain bacteria as well (which do not have ergosterol), other mechanisms of action also appear to be involved. Ketoconazole (KTZ): It is the first orally effective broad-spectrum antifungal drug, useful in both dermatophytosis and deep myc osis. The oral absorption of KTZ is facilitated by gastric acidity because it is more soluble at lower pH. Hepatic metabolism is extensive; metabolites are excreted in urine and faeces. Elimination of KTZ is dose dependent: tlh varies from llh to 6 hours. Penetration in CSF is poor: not effective in fungal men ingitis. However, therapeutic concentrations are attained in the skin and vaginal fluid. ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY K. D. TRIPATHI SIXTH EDITION PAGE NO: 761, 762",

        "exp": "Amphotericin B (AMB): It is obtained from Streptomyces nodosus. Chemistry and mechanism of action The polyenes possess a macrocyclic ring, one side of which has several conjugated double bonds and is highly lipophilic, while the other side is hydrophilic with many OH groups. A polaraminosugar and a carboxylic acid group are present at one end in some. They are all insoluble in water and unstable in aqueous medium. The polyenes have high affinity for ergosterol present in fungal cell membrane: combine with it, get inseed into the membrane and several polyene molecules together orient themselves in such a way as to form a &; micropore&;. The hydrophilic side forms the interior of the pore through which ions, amino acids and other watersoluble substances move out. The micropore is stabilized by membrane sterols which fill up the spaces between the AMB molecules on the lipophilic side-constituting the outer surface of the pore. Thus, cell permeability is markedly increased. New amphotericin B formulations In an attempt to improve tolerability of i. v. infusion of AMB, reduce its toxicity and achieve targeted delivery, 3 new lipid formulations of AMB have been produced. (a) Amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC): Contains 35% AMB incorporated in ribbon like paicles of dimyristoyl phospholipids. ( b ) Amphotericin B colloidal dispersion (ABCO). Disc shaped paicles containing 50% each of AMB and cholesteryl sulfate are prepared as aqueous dispersion (c) Lpi osomal amphotericin B (small unilamellar vesicles SUV): Consists of 10% AMB incorporated in uniform sized (60-80 nM) unilamellar liposomes made up of lecithin and other biodegradable phospholipids. The special features of these preparations are: * They, except ABCD, produce milder acute reaction (especially liposomal formulation) on i. v. infusion. * They can be used in patients not tolerating infusion oi conventional AMB formulation. * They have lower nephrotoxicity. * They cause minimal anemia. * The liposomal preparation delivers AMB paicularh* to reticuloendothelial cells in liver and spleen-----especialh valuable for kala azar and in immunocompromised patients. However, some preparations, especially ABLC and ABCD, produce lower AMB levels and their clinical efficacy relative to conventional formulations appear to be lower. Though none of the above formulations is more effectivein deep mycosis than conventional AMB, the liposomal AMB reduces equivalent blood levels, has similar clinical efficacy with less acute reaction and renal toxicity. It thus apears more satisfactory. ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY K. D. TRIPATHI SIXTH EDITION PAGE NO: 757, 758, 759",

Both have very similar range of activity, but colistin is more potent on Pseudomonas, Salmonella and Shigella. Mechanism of action They are rapidly acting bactericidal agents; have a detergent-like action on the cell membrane. They have high affinity for phospholipids: the peptide molecules (or their aggregates) orient between the phospholipid and protein films in gram-negative bacterial cell membrane causing membrane distoion or pseudopore formation.

Though, resistance among P. vivax against primaquine can be induced, it is not a clinical problem. Essentials of medical pharmacology K D Tripathi Sixth edition Pg no 791",

Conjugation frequently occurs in the colon where large variety of gram-negative bacilli come in close contact. Even nonpathogenic organisms may transfer R factor to pathogenic organisms, which may become widespread by contamination of food or water. Chloramphenicol resistance of typhoid bacilli, streptomycin resistance of E. coli, penicillin resistance of Haemophilus and gonococci and many others have been traced to this mechanism.

The mechanism of action of chloroquine is not completely known. It is actively concentrated by sensitive intraerythrocytic plasmodia: higher concentration is found in infected RBCs. By accumulating in the acidic vesicles of the parasite and because of its weakly basic nature, it raises the vesicular pH and thereby interferes with degradation of hemoglobin by parasitic lysosomes. Polymerization of toxic haeme to nontoxic parasite pigment hemozoin is inhibited by formation of chloroquine-heme complex. Heme itself or its complex with chloroquine then damages the plasmodial membranes. Clumping of pigment and changes in parasite membranes follow.

Erythromycin is the first member discovered in the 1950s, Roxithromycin, Clarithromycin and Azithromycin are the later additions. Interestingly, the nonantibiotic macrolides: tacrolimus, pimecrolimus and sirolimus also possess immunomodulatory propeies. The antibiotic effects of macrolides are mediated by inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis, through inhibiton of peptidyltransferase activity. They have been frequently used in the past for treating many upper respiratory tract infections including GAS pharyngitis with adequate efficacy (>90%). Their effects on immunomodulation appear to extend beyond their antimicrobial actions as they have been shown to mitigate cytokine production in animal studies and human trials. While its antibiotic propeies have been attributed to mechanisms shared by other macrolides, AZM has been shown to act primarily on the lymphokine CD4 Th1 cell line reducing the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-6, and increasing the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in macrophage cell lines after stimulation with a combination of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IFN-g. The immunomodulatory potential of AZM is not limited to suppression of production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, it also suppresses i. NOS-mediated nitric oxide production. These agents also work at a molecular level, decreasing m. RNA expression thereby promoting apoptosis of inflammatory cells and a decrease in nuclear transcription factors.

TERBINAFI N E This orally and topically active drug against dermatophytes and Candida belongs to a new allylamine class of antifungals. In contrast to azoles which are primarily fungistatic, terbinafine is fungicidal: shoer courses of therapy are required and relapse rates are low. It acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of &; squalene epoxidase&;, an early step enzyme in ergosterol biosynthesis by fungi. Accumulation of squalene within fungal cells appears to be responsible for the fungicidal action. The mammalian enzyme is inhibited only by 1000-fold higher concentration of terbinafine. Approximately 75% of oral terbinafine is absorbed, but only 5% or less from unbroken skin. First pass metabolism fuher reduces oral bioavailability. lt is lipophilic, widely distributed in the body, strongly plasma protein bound and concentrated in sebum, stratum corneum and nail plates.

Resistance may be developed by mutation or gene transfer: Gene transfer (infectious resistance) from one organism to another can occur by: 1. Conjugation: Sexual contact through the formation of a bridge or sex pilus is common among gram-negative bacilli of the same or another species. This may involve chromosomal or extrachromosomal (plasmid) DNA. The gene carrying the &; resistance&; or &; R&; factor is transferred onlv if another &; resistance transfer factor&; (F) is also present. Conjugation frequently occurs in the colon where large variety of gram-negative bacilli come in close contact. Even nonpathogenic organisms may transfer R factor to pathogenic organisms, which may become widespread by contamination of food or water. 2. Transduction: It is the transfer of gene carrying resistance through the agency of a bacteriophage. The R factor is taken up by the phage and delivered to another bacterium which it infects. 3. Transformation: A resistant bacterium may release the resistance carrying DNA into the medium and this may be imbibed by another sensitive organism-becoming unresponsive to the drug. This mechanism is probably not clinically significant except isolated instances of pneumococcal resistance to penicillin G due to altered penicillin binding protein, and some other cases. Resistance once acquired by any of theabove mechanisms becomes prevalent due to the selection pressure of a widely used AMA, i. e. presence of che AMA provides oppounity for the resistant subpopulation to thrive in preference to the sensitive population ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY K.

The conjugated aminoglycosides do not bind to the target ribosomes and are incapable of enhancing active transpo like the unaltered drug. These enzymes are acquired mainly by conjugation and transfer of plasmids. Nosocomial microbes have become rich in such plasmids, some of which encode for multidrug resistance. This is the most impoant mechanism of development of resistance to aminoglycosides. Susceptibility of different aminoglycosides to these enzymes differs. Thus, cross resistance among different members is paial or absent. (b) Mutation decreasing the affinity of ribosomal proteins that normally bind the aminoglycoside: this mechanism can confer high degree resistance, but operates to a limited extent, e. g. E. coli that develop streptomycin resistance by single step mutation do not bind the antibiotic on the polyribosome. Only a few other instances are known. This type of resistance is specific for a paicular amino glycoside. (c) Decreased efficiency of the aminoglycoside transpoing mechanism: either the pores in the outer coat become less permeable or the acti. Ye transpo is interfered. This again is not frequently encountered in the clinical setting. In some Pseudomonas which develop resistance, the antibiotic induced 2nd phase active transpo has been found to be deficient.

Selective exposure of tumour to the drug by intraaerial infusion into a limb or head and neck; intrapleural/ intraperitoneal injectionespecially for rapidly accumulating pleural effusion or ascitis; topical application on the lesion-<m skin, buccal mucosa, vagina, etc. may reduce systemic toxicity. 6. Platelet and/ or granulocyte transfusion after treatment-to prevent bleeding or infection. 7. Use of biological response modifiers like recombinant GM-CSF /G-CSF hastens recovery from cytotoxic drug induced myelosuppression. Pemetrexed is a novel multitargeted antifolate that inhibits > or = 3 enzymes involved in folate metabolism and purine and pyrimidine synthesis. These enzymes are thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. This agent has broad antitumor activity in phase II trials in a wide variety of solid tumors, and is approved in combination with cisplatin for the therapy of malignant mesothelioma. In a recent phase III trial, pemetrexed demonstrated equivalent efficacy to docetaxel, but with significantly less toxicity, in second-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. The most common and serious toxicities of pemetrexed--myelosuppression and mucositis--have been significantly ameliorated by folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation. More impoant, vitamin supplementation has not been shown to adversely affect efficacy in some tumor types. Tumors with codeletion of the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase gene, as a consequence of p16 deletions, may be paicularly sensitive to pemetrexed REFERENCE: 1)ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY K.

The inhibition is pseudoirreversible because Mtx has 50, 000 times higher affinity for the enzyme than the normal substrate. Methotrexate has cell cycle specific actionkills cells in S phase; primarily inhibits DNA synthesis, but also affects RNA and protein synthesis. It exes major toxicity on bone marrow-low doses given repeatedly cause megaloblastic anemia, but high doses produce pancytopenia. Desquamation and bleeding may occur in g. i. t. Methotrexate is absorbed orally, 50% plasma protein bound, little metabolized and largely excreted unchanged in urine. Salicylates, sulfonamides, dicumerol displace it from protein binding sites. Aspirin and sulfonamides enhance toxicity of Mtx by decreasing its renal tubular secretion. The toxicity of. Mtx cannot be overcome by folic acid, because it will not be conveed to the active coenzyme form. However, Folinic acid (N5 formyl THFA, cirovorum factor) rapidly reverses the effects.

Rifampin is bactericidal to M. tu berculosis and many other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria like Staph. aureus, N. meningitidis, H. influenzae, E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus and Legionella. Against TB bacilli, it is as efficacious as INH and better than all other drugs. The bactericidal action covers all subpopulations of TB bacilli, but acts best on slowly or intermittently (spuers) dividing ones, as well as on many atypical mycobacteri a. Both extra- and intracellular organisms are affected. It has good sterilizing and resistance preventing actions. Rifampin inhibits DNA dependent RNA synthesis. Probably, the basis of selective toxicity is that mammalian RNA polymerase does not avidly bind rifampin. Mycobacteria and other organisms develop resistance to rifampin rather rapidly. Rifampin resistance is nearly always due to mutation in the repoB gene (for the beta subunit of RNA polymerase- the target of rifampin action) reducing its affinity for the drug. No cross resistance with any other antitubercular drug has been noted. ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY K. D. TRIPATHI SIXTH EDITION PAGE NO: 741",

DEC is absorbed after oral ingestion, distributed all over the body (V = 3-5 L/kg), metabolized in liver and excreted in urine. Excretion is faster in acidic urine. Diethylcarbamazine has a highly selective effect on microfilariae (Mf). A dose of 2 mg/kg TDS clears Mf of W. bancrofti and B. malayi from peripheral blood in 7 days. However, Mf present in nodules and transudates (hydrocoele) are not killed. The most impoant action of DEC appears to be alteration of Mf membranes so that they are readily phagocytosed by tissue fixed monocytes, but not by circulating phagocytes. Muscular activity of the Mf and adult worms is also affected causing hyperpolarization due to the piperazine moiety, so that they are dislodged.

        "question": "The bacterial drug resistance in tuberculosis results from:",
        "exp": "Drug resistance: It refers to unresponsiveness of a microorganism to an AMA, and is akin to the phenomenon of tolerance seen in higher organisms. Resistance may be developed by mutation or gene transfer. Mutation: It is a stable and heritable genetic change that occurs spontaneously and randomly among microorganisms. It is not induced by the AMA. Any sensitive population of a microbe contains a few mutant cells which require higher concentration of the AMA for inhibition. These are selectively preserved and get a chance to proliferate when the sensitive cells are eliminated by the AMA. Thus, in time it would appear that a sensitive strain has been replaced by a resistant one, e. g. when a single antitubercular drug is used. Mutation and resistance may be: (i ) Single step.- A single gene mutation may confer high degree of resistance; emerges rapidly, e. g. enterococci to streptomycin, E. coli and Staphylococci to rifampin. (ii ) Multistep.* A number of gene modifications are involved, sensitivity decreases gradually in a stepwise manner. Resistance to erythromycin, tetracyclines and chloramphenicol is developed by many organisms in this manner. Sometimes mutational acquisition of resistance is accompanied by decrease in virulence, e. g. ceain rifampin resistant staphylococci and low grade penicillin-resistant gonococci have decreased virulence",

Streptococcal pharyngitis, tonsillitis, mastoiditis and community acquired respiratory infections caused by pneumococci and H. influenzae respond equally well to erythromycin.

Metabolism of methotrexate in the liver to paly inactive 7-hydroxymethotrexate reduces plasma concentrations of methotrexate and creates competition for cellular uptake RFC, which also internalizes reduced folates and folic acid, although with low affinity for the latter. Folate receptors mediate low affinity endocytosis of methotrexate. Quantitative or qualitative alterations in RFCs or folate-receptor expression confer transpo-related resistance to methotrexate, as do high levels of exogenous folates competing for cell entry. Intracellularly, methotrexate is metabolized to polyglutamated forms by FPGS, and these are broken down by FPGH. The monoglutamated forms and, to some extent, polyglutamated forms are expelled transpoers ABCC1-ABCC5 and ABCG2. ABCB1 does not transpo anionic drugs such as methotrexate. Polyglutamated forms of methotrexate can inhibit several key enzymes in folate metabolism, such as DHFR and TS, preventing de novo purine biosynthesis by APFase and AICAFase. Enzyme inhibition, folate depletion, and direct or indirect effects on cytokine release signaling pathways (such as those mediated by NFkB and IKK) all create routes which methotrexate could suppress RA.

Sulfonamido-chrysoidine (Prontosil Red) was one of the dyes included by Domagk to treat experimental streptococcal infection in mice and found it to be highly effective. Adverse effects to sulfonamides are relatively common. These are: * Nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain. * Crystalluria is dose related, but infrequent now. Precipitation in urine can be minimized by taking plenty of fluids and by alkalinizing the urine in which sulfonamides and their acetylated derivatives are more soluble. * Hypersensitivity reactions occur in 2-5deg o patients. These are mostly in the form of rashes, uicaria and drug fever. Photosensitization is repoed. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and exfoliative dermatitis are more common with long-acting agents. * Hepatitis, unrelated to dose, occurs in 0. 1 o c patients. * Topical use of sulfonamides is not recommended because of risk of contact sensitization. However, ocular use is permitted. * Sulfonamides cause haemolysis in a dosedependent manner in individuals with G-6- PD deficiency. Neutropenia and other blood dyscrasias are rare. * Kernicterus may be precipitated in the newborn, especially premature, by displacement of bilirubin from plasma protein binding sites and more permeable blood-brain barrier.

The triphosphate of cytarabine is an inhibitor of DNA polymerase and blocks generation of cytidilic acid. However, it is now believed that its incorporation into DNA is more impoant for the expression of cellular toxicity. It also interferes with DNA repair. Cytarabine is cell cycle specific and acts primarily during S phase. Its main use is to induce remission in acute leukaemia in children, also in adults. Other uses are-Hodgkin&; s disease and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Both 5-FU and cytarabine exe primary toxicity on bone marrow and g. i. t. Genetic deficiency of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) predisposes to severe 5-FU toxicity. High-dose therapy (2, 000-3, 000 mg/m2) has been associated with severe and potentially fatal toxicities which differ from those seen with usual low doses. Ocular toxicities may include vision loss, reversible corneal toxicity (keratitis), and hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (<80%). 2, 3, 6 Ocular toxicities have been repoed 1-2 weeks after initiating therapy. Symptoms may include tearing, eye pain, foreign body sensation, photophobia, and blurred vision. Conjunctivitis may occur with rash. Toxicity can be minimized by prophylactic use of ophthalmic coicosteroids. 2. Use prednisolone 0. 12% - 1% or dexamethasone 0. 1%, 2 drops in each eye every 4 hours, beginning before the first dose of cytarabine and continuing until 48 hours after the last one. NS may also help relieve symptoms. Neurotoxicity (8-10%) typically occurs 3-8 days after initiating therapy. Cerebellar dysfunction is characterized by difficulty with speech, trouble standing or walking, and tremors. Cerebral dysfunction may be seen concomitantly and is characterized by somnolence, confusion, personality changes, cognitive dysfunction, memory loss, psychosis, or seizures. Seizures are usually self-limited. In most patients, neurologic dysfunction resolves in 5-10 days. There is a high incidence (~60%) of recurrent cerebellar toxicity in patients who have already experienced toxicity.

        "exp": "Cisplatin belongs to the group of medicines known as alkylating agents. It is used to treat cancer of the bladder, ovaries, and testicles. It is a platinum coordination complex that is hydrolysed intracellularly to produce a highly reactive moiety which causes cross linking of. DNA. Theoured siteis N&; ofguanineresidue. It can also react with -SH groups in proteins and has radiomimetic propey. It is bound to plasma proteins, enters tissues and is slowly excreted unchanged in urine with a tlh about 72 hrs. Negligible amounts enter brain. Leukemia is cancer of the body&; s blood-forming tissues, including the bone marrow and the lymphatic system. Alkylating agents are chemo drugs that interfere with a cell's DNA in a ceain way. These drugs can sometimes cause AML and MDS. Often MDS develops first, which then progresses to AML. The chemo drugs cisplatin and carboplatin are not an alkylating agents, but they attack cancer cells in much the same way. These drugs seem to increase the risk of leukemia (mainly AML), too, but the risk is not as great as with the alkylating agents. This leukemia is hard to treat and tends to have a poor outcome, much like the leukemia linked to the alkylating agents. The risk of leukemia rises as the amount of drug used gets higher. The risk of developing leukemia increases even more if radiation is given along with cisplatin or carboplatin. REFERENCE: ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY(K. D.

        "exp": "Chloramphenicol was initially obtained from Streptomyces venezuelae in 1947. It was soon synthesized chemically and the commercial product now is all synthetic. Adverse effects 1. Bone marrow depression Of all drugs, chloramphenicol is the most impoant cause of aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia. Two forms are recognized: (a) Non-dose related idiosyncratic reaction: This is rare (1 in 40, 000), unpredictable, but serious, often fatal, probably has a genetic basis and is more common after repeated courses. Aplastic anemia is the most common manifestation. Apparently, a longer latent period of onset of marrow aplasia is associated with higher moality. Many victims, even if they survive, develop leukaemias later. (b) Dose and duration of therapy related myelosuppression: a direct toxic effect, predictable and probably due to inhibition of mitochondrial enzyme synthesis. This is often reversible without long-term sequelae. Liver and kidney disease predisposes to such toxicity. 2. Hypersensitivity reactions Rashes, fever, atrophic glossitis, angioedema are infrequent 3. Irritative effects Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pain on injection. 4. Superinfections These are similar to tetracyclines, but less common. 5. Gray baby syndrome It occurred when high doses (-100 mg/kg) were given prophylactically to neonates, especially premature. The baby stopped feeding, vomited, became hypotonic and hypothermic, abdomen distended, respiration became irregular; an ashen gray cyanosis developed in many, followed by cardiovascular collapse and death. Blood lactic acid was raised. It occurs because of inability of the newborn to adequately metabolize and excrete chloramphenicol. At higher concentration, chloramphenicol blocks electron transpo in the liver, myocardium and skeletal muscle, resulting in the above symptoms.

Streptococcal pharyngitis, tonsillitis, mastoiditis and community acquired respiratory infections caused by pneumococci and H. influenzae respond equally well to erythromycin. It is an alternative drug for prophylaxis of rheumatic fever and SABE. However, many bacteria resistant to penicillin are also resistant to erythromycin. 2. Diphtheria: acute stage as well as for carriers-7 day treatment. Some prefer it over penicillin. Antitoxin is the primary treatment. 3. Tetanus: as an adjuvant to antitoxin, toxoid therapy. 4. Syphilis and gonorrhoea: only if other alternative drugs, including tetracyclines also cannot be used: relapse rates are higher. 5.

Antiemetics are routinely administered before infusing it. The most impoant toxicity is renal impairment which is dependent on total dose administered. Renal toxicity can be reduced by maintaining good hydration. Tinnitus, deafness, neuropathy and hyperuricaemia are other problems. Shock like state sometimes occurs during i. v. infusion.

They competitively inhibit utilization of the normal substrate or get themselves incorporated forming dysfunctional macromolecules. Methotrexate (Mtx): It is one of the oldest and highly efficacious antineoplastic drugs; inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFRase)-blocking the conversion of dihydrofolic acid (DHFA) to tetrahydrofolic acid (THFA) which is an essential coenzyme required for one carbon transfer reactions in de novo purine synthesis and amino acid interconversions. The inhibition is pseudoirreversible because Mtx has 50, 000 times higher affinity for the enzyme than the normal substrate. Calcineurin inhibitors: (Specific T-cell inhibitors) >Cyclosporine: It is a cyclic polypeptide with 11 amino acids, obtained from a fungus and introduced in 1977 as a highly selective immunosuppressant which has markedly increased the success of organ transplantations. It profoundly and selectively inhibits T lymphocyte proliferation, IL-2 and other cytokine production and response of inducer T cells to IL-l, without any effect on suppressor T-cells. Lymphocytes are arrested in G0 or G1 phase. Etoposide: It is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin, a plant glycoside. It is not a mitotic inhibitor, but arrests cells in the G2 phase and causes DNA breaks by affecting DNA topoisomerase II function. While the cleaving of double stranded DNA is not interfered, the subsequent resealing of the strand is prevented. It has been primarily used in testicular tumours, lung cancer, Hodgkin&; s and other lymphomas, carcinoma bladder. Alopecia, leucopenia and g. i. t. disturbances are the main toxicity. Vinblastine: It is primarily employed with other drugs in Hodgkin&; s disease and testicular carcinoma.

These include: Cancer of the prostate in men Cancer of the breast in women if it develops before or around the time of menopause Endometriosis, a painful condition caused by extra tissue growing inside or outside of the uterus, and Thinning of the lining of the uterus before surgery on the uterus. When given regularly as an implant, goserelin works every day to decrease the amount of estrogen and testosterone in the blood. Reducing the amount of estrogen in the body is one way of treating endometriosis and cancer of the breast, and can help thin the uterus lining before surgery. Goserelin prevents the growth of tissue associated with endometriosis in adult women during treatment and for up to 6 months after treatment is discontinued. Reducing the amount of testosterone in the body is one way of treating cancer of the prostate. Suppressing estrogen can thin the bones or slow their growth. This is a problem for adult women whose bones are no longer growing like the bones of children. This is why goserelin is used only for up to 6 months in adult women treated for endometriosis. This medicine is to be given only by or under the supervision of doctor. REFERENCE: www. mayoclinic. org",

Adverse effects: The toxicity of AMB is high. 1)acute reaction This occurs with each infusion and consists of chills, fever, aches and pain all over, nausea, vomiting and dyspnoea lasting for 2-5 hour, probably due to release of cytokines (IL, TNF). When these are severe--the dose is increased gradually. Injection of hydrocoisone 0. 6 mg/kg with the infusion may reduce the intensity of reaction. Thrombophlebitis of the injected vein can occur. 2). Long term toxicity: Nephrotoxicity is the most impoant.

        "exp": "To achieve synergism Every AMA has a specific effect on selected microorganisms. Depending on the drug pair as well as the organism involved, either synergism (supra-additive effect), additive action, indifference or antagonism may be observed when two AMAs belonging to different classes are used together. Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment in S pneumoniae infections. Until the 1970s, essentially all pneumococcal isolates were sensitive to easily achievable levels of most commonly used antibiotics, including penicillins, macrolides, clindamycin, cephalosporins, rifampin, vancomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole The mechanism of pneumococcal resistance to penicillin and cephalosporins is through alteration in the molecular cell wall targets, penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Mutations that alter the PBPs result in decreased affinity for binding to these agents, rendering them less effective. This type of resistance can be overcome if the antibiotic concentration at the site of infection exceeds the MIC of the organism for 40%-50% of the dosing interval. Penicillin-resistant pneumococci are often resistant to multiple additional classes of antibiotics, including other penicillin derivatives, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (through amino acid changes), macrolides (through methylation or an efflux pump), quinolones (through decreased permeability, efflux pumps, and alteration of enzymes), and chloramphenicol (through inactivating enzymes). Resistance is obtained as pa of a cassette of genetic information, or a transposon, that encodes resistance to multiple antibiotics. Resistance rates of pneumococcal isolates in the United States to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and the macrolides are relatively high. Some isolates (< 10% in the United States) that are resistant to macrolides are also resistant to clindamycin. Vancomycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates have not been repoed in the United States. The phenomenon of tolerance (survival but not growth in the presence of a given antibiotic) has been observed, but its clinical relevance is unknown. Any strain with an in vitro MIC greater than 1 ug/mL to vancomycin should be immediately repoed to the state health depament and arrangements made for confirmatory testing at the CDC. In the United States, most pneumococcal isolates remain susceptible to fluoroquinolones. In ceain countries and specific populations in whom the use of \"respiratory fluoroquinolones\" is more prevalent (eg, nursing homes), an increase in resistance to these agents has been seen.

Acyclovir is preferentially taken up by the virus infected cells. Because of selective generation of the active inhibitor in the virus infected cell and its greater inhibitory effect on viral DNA synthesis, acyclovir has low toxicity for host cells: a several hundred-fold chemotherapeutic index has been noted. Acyclovir is active only against herpes group of viruses; H. simplex type I is most sensitive followed by H. simplex type II > varicella-zoster virus= Epstein-Barr virus; while cytomegalovirus (CMV) is practically not affected. Both H. simplex and varicella-zoster virus have been found to develop resistance to acyclovir during therapy; the former primarily due to mutants deficient in thymidine kinase activity and the latter primarily by change in specificity of virus directed enzyme so that its affinity for acyclovir is decreased.

Amphotericin B (AMB): It is obtained from Streptomyces nodosus. Chemistry and mechanism of action The polyenes possess a macrocyclic ring, one side of which has several conjugated double bonds and is highly lipophilic, while the other side is hydrophilic with many OH groups. A polar aminosugar and a carboxylic acid group are present at one end in some. They are all insoluble in water and unstable in aqueous medium. Pharmacokinetics: AMB is not absorbed orally; it can be given orally for intestinal candidiasis without systemic toxicity. Administered i. v. as asuspension made with the help of deoxycholate (DOC), it gets widely distributed in the body, but penetration in CSF is poor. It binds to sterols in tissues and to lipoproteins in plasma and stays in the body for long periods. Administration and dose Amphotericin B can be administered orally (50-100 mg QID) for intestinal moniliasis; also topically for vaginitis, otomycosis, etc.: FUNGIZONE OTIC 3% ear drops. For systemic mycosis, it is available as dry powder along with DOC for extemporaneous dispersion before use: FUNGIZONE INTRA VENOUS, MYCOL 50 mg l It is first suspended in 10 rnl water and then diluted to 500 ml with glucose solution (saline tends to make the suspension coarse). Initially 1 mg test dose is injected i. v over 20 minutes. If no serious reaction follows, 0. 3 mg/kg is infused over 4-8 hours. Daily dose may be gradually increased to 0. 7 mg/kg depending on tolerance of the patient. The total dose of AMB for majority of cases is 3- 4 g given over 2-3 months. Intrathecal injection of 0. 5 mg twice weekly has been given in fungal meningitis. New amphotericin B formulations In an attempt to improve tolerability of i. v. infusion of AMB, reduce its toxicity and achieve targeted delivery, 3 new lipid formulations of AMB have been produced. (a) Amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC): Contains 35% AMB incorporated in ribbon like paicles of dimyristoyl phospholipids. ( b ) Amphotericin B colloidal dispersion (ABCO). Disc shaped paicles containing 50% each of AMB and cholesteryl sulfate are prepared as aqueous dispersion (c) Lpi osomal amphotericin B (small unilamellar vesicles SUV): Consists of 10% AMB incorporated in uniform sized (60-80 nM) unilamellar liposomes made up of lecithin and other biodegradable phospholipids. The special features of these preparations are: * They, except ABCD, produce milder acute reaction (especially liposomal formulation) on i. v. infusion. * They can be used in patients not tolerating infusion oi conventional AMB formulation. * They have lower nephrotoxicity. * They cause minimal anemia. * The liposomal preparation delivers AMB paicularh* to reticuloendothelial cells in liver and spleen-----especialh valuable for kala azar and in immunocompromised patients. However, some preparations, especially ABLC and ABCD, produce lower AMB levels and their clinical efficacy relative to conventional formulations appear to be lower.

Pharmacokinetics: Ampicillin is not degraded by gastric acid; oral absorption is incomplete but adequate. Food interferes with absorption.

Pharmacokinetics: Dapsone is completely absorbed after oral administration and is widely distributed in the body, though penetration in CSF is poor. It is 70% plasma protein bound, but more impoantly concentrated in skin (especially lepromatous skin), muscle, liver and kidney. Dapsone is acetylated as well as glucuronide and sulfate conjugated in liver. Metabolites are excreted in bile and reabsorbed from intestine, so that ultimate excretion occurs mostly in urine.

Mechanism of action Erythromycin is bacteriostatic at low but cidal (for ceain bacteria) at high concentrations. Cidal action depends on the organism concerned and its rate of multiplication. Sensitive gram-positive bacteria accumulate erythromycin intracellularly by active transpo which is responsible for their high susceptibility to this antibiotic. It is several fold more active in alkaline medium, because the nonionized (penetrable) form of the drug is oured at higher pH. Erythromycin acts by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. It combines with 50S ribosomes subunits and interferes with 'translocation'. After peptide bond formation between the newly attached amino acid and the nacent peptide chain at the acceptor (A) site the elongated peptide is translocated back to the peptidyl (P) site, making the A site available for next aminoacyl t. RNA attachment. This is prevented by erythromycin and the ribosome fails to move along the m. RNA to expose the next codon. As an indirect consequence, peptide chain may be prematurely terminated: synthesis of larger proteins is especifically suppressed.

It enhances polymerization of tubulin: a mechanism opposite to that of vinca alkaloids. The microtubules are stabilized and their depolymerization is prevented. This stability results in inhibition of normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic functions. Abnormal arrays or &; bundles&; of microtubules are produced throughout the cell cycle. Cytotoxic action of paclitaxel emphasizes the impoance of tubulin-microtubule dynamic equilibrium. The approved indications of paclitaxel are metastatic ovarian and breast carcinoma after failure of first line chemotherapy and relapse cases. It has also shown efficacy in advanced cases of head and neck cancer, small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma and hormone refractory prostate cancer. ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY K.

It enhances polymerization of tubulin: a mechanism opposite to that of vinca alkaloids. The microtubules are stabilized and their depolymerization is prevented. This stability results in inhibition of normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic functions. Abnormal arrays or &; bundles&; of microtubules are produced throughout the cell cycle. Cytotoxic action of paclitaxel emphasizes the impoance of tubulin-microtubule dynamic equilibrium. The approved indications of paclitaxel are metastatic ovarian and breast carcinoma after failure of first line chemotherapy and relapse cases. It has also shown efficacy in advanced cases of head and neck cancer, small cell lung cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma and hormone refractory prostate cancer. The major toxicity is reversible myelosuppression and &; stocking and glove&; neuropathy. Chest pain, ahralgia, myalgia, mucositis and edema can be troublesome. The syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion is attributed to excessive ADH release.

Fast multiplying organisms are rapidly killed, but quiescent ones are only inhibited. It acts on extracellular as well as on intracellular TB (bacilli present within macrophages); is equally active in acidic and alkaline medium. It is one of the cheapest antitubercular drugs. However, most atypical mycobacteria are not inhibited by INH. The most plausible mechanism of action of INH is inhibition of synthesis of mycolic acids which are unique fatty acid component of mycobacterial cell wall. This may explain the high selectivity of INH for mycobacteria (it is not active against any other microorganism). The lipid content of mycobacteria exposed to INH is reduced. A gene labelled inh A which encodes for a fatty acid synthase enzyme is the target of INH action. Adverse effects INH is well tolerated by most patients. Peripheral neuritis and a variety of neurological manifestations (paresthesias, numbness, mental disturbances, rarely convulsions) are the most impoant dose-dependent toxic effects. These are due to interference with utilization of pyridoxine and its increased excretion in urine Pyridoxine given prophylactically (10 mg / day) prevents the neurotoxicity even with higher doses, but routine use is not mandatory. INH neurotoxicity is treated by pyridoxine l. OO mg/day. Hepatitis, a major adverse effect of i. NH, is rare in children, but more common in older people and in alcoholics. It is due to dose-related damage to liver cells and is reversible on stopping the drug. Other side effects are rashes, fever, acne and ahralgia. ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY K. D.

        "exp": "Klebsiella organisms are resistant to multiple antibiotics. This is thought to be a plasmid-mediated propey. Length of hospital stay and performance of invasive procedures are risk factors for acquisition of these strains. Treatment depends on the organ system involved. In general, initial therapy of patients with possible bacteremia is empirical. The choice of a specific antimicrobial agent depends on local susceptibility patterns. Once bacteremia is confirmed, treatment may be modified. Agents with high intrinsic activity against K pneumoniae should be selected for severely ill patients. Examples of such agents include third-generation cephalosporins (eg, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), carbapenems (eg, imipenem/cilastatin), aminoglycosides (eg, gentamicin, amikacin), and quinolones. These agents may be used as monotherapy or combination therapy. Some expes recommend using a combination of an aminoglycoside and a third-generation cephalosporin as treatment for non-ESBL-producing isolates. Others disagree and recommend monotherapy. Aztreonam may be used in patients who are allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics. Quinolones are also effective treatment options for susceptible isolates in patients with either carbapenem allergy or major beta-lactam allergy. Other antibiotics used to treat susceptible isolates include ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanate, ceftazidime, cefepime, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, moxifloxacin, meropenem, and eapenem. Treatment of Klebsiella pneumonia has discrepant results. For patients with severe infections, a clinically prudent approach is the use of an initial sho course (48-72 h) of combination therapy with an aminoglycoside, followed by a switch to an extended-spectrum cephalosporin when susceptibility is confirmed.

Griseofulvin is active against most dermatophytes, including Epidermophyton, Trichophyton, Microsporum, etc., but not against Candida and other fungi causing deep mycosis. Bacteria are also insensitive. Dermatophytes actively concentrate it: this feature probably accounts for its selective toxicity. Resistance can be induced in vitro and this is associated with loss of concentrating ability. However, emergence of resistance during clinical use is rare. Griseofulvin interferes with mitosis-multinucleated and stunted fungal hyphae result from its action. It also causes abnormal metaphase configurations. However, unlike the typical mitotic inhibitors (colchicine, vinca alkaloids), it does not cause metaphase arrest; rather the daughter nuclei fail to move apa or move only a sho distance. It does not inhibit polymerization of tubulin (microtubular protein which pulls the chromosomes apa), but binds to polymerized microtubules and somehow disorients them.

Therapeutic plasma concentrations are in the range of 15-30 ng/ml. However, it has no effect on pre- and exo-erythrocytic phases of the parasite-does not prevent relapses in vivax and ovale malaria. Resistance in P. falciparum is associated with a decreased ability of the parasite to accumulate chloroquine. Veraparnil, a Ca2+ channel blocker, has been found to restore both the chloroquine concentrating ability as well as sensitivity to this drug. For pediatric patients, the treatment options are the same as for adults except the drug dose is adjusted by patient weight. The pediatric dose should never exceed the recommended adult dose. Pediatric dosing may be difficult due to unavailability of non-capsule forms of quinine. If unable to provide pediatric doses of quinine, consider one of the other three options. If using a quinine-based regimen for children less than eight years old, doxycycline and tetracycline are generally not indicated; therefore, quinine can be given alone for a full 7 days regardless of where the infection was acquired or given in combination with clindamycin as recommended above. In rare instances, doxycycline or tetracycline can be used in combination with quinine in children less than 8 years old if other treatment options are not available or are not tolerated, and the benefit of adding doxycycline or tetracycline is judged to outweigh the risk. If infections initially attributed to \"species not identified\" are subsequently diagnosed as being due to P. vivax or P. ovale, additional treatment with primaquine should be administered.

        "question": "Which of the following parameters is not monitored in a patient on methotrexate therapy:",
        "exp": "Methotrexate is an antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent that binds to the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which is involved in the synthesis of purine nucleotides. This interferes with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis and disrupts cell multiplication. Methotrexate has long been known to be effective in the treatment of leukemias, lymphomas, and carcinomas of the head, neck, breast, ovary, and bladder. It has also been used as an immunosuppressive agent in the prevention of graft versus host disease and in the treatment of severe psoriasis and rheumatoid ahritis. The effectiveness of methotrexate on trophoblastic tissue has been well established and is derived from experience gained in using this agent in the treatment of hydatiform moles and choriocarcinomas. As used in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy, methotrexate is administered in a single or in multiple intramuscular (IM) injections. Treatment with methotrexate is an especially attractive option when the pregnancy is located on the cervix or ovary or in the interstitial or the cornual poion of the tube. Surgical treatment in these cases is often associated with increased risk of hemorrhage, often resulting in hysterectomy or oophorectomy. Indications Medical therapy for ectopic pregnancy involving methotrexate may be indicated in ceain patients. To determine acceptable candidates for methotrexate therapy, first establish the diagnosis by one of the following criteria: Abnormal doubling rate of the beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG) level and ultrasonographic identification of a gestational sac outside of the uterus Abnormal doubling rate of the b-HCG level, an empty uterus, and menstrual aspiration with no chorionic villi A number of other factors must also be considered once the diagnosis is established, as follows: The patient must be hemodynamically stable, with no signs or symptoms of active bleeding or hemoperitoneum (must be met by every patient) The patient must be reliable, compliant, and able to return for follow-up care (must be met by every patient) The size of the gestation should not exceed 4cm at its greatest dimension (or exceed 3. 5 cm with cardiac activity) on ultrasonographic measurement - Exceeding this size is a relative, but not absolute, contraindication to medical therapy Absence of fetal cardiac activity on ultrasonographic findings - The presence of fetal cardiac activity is a relative contraindication No evidence of tubal rupture - Evidence of tubal rupture is an absolute contraindication b-HCG level less than 5000 m. IU/mL - Higher levels are a relative contraindication Methotrexate Treatment Protocols A number of accepted protocols with injected methotrexate exist for the treatment of ectopic pregnancy. Multiple-dose regimen Initial experience used multiple doses of methotrexate with leucovorin to minimize adverse effects. Leucovorin is folinic acid that is the end product of the reaction catalyzed by dihydrofolate reductase, the same enzyme inhibited by methotrexate. Normal dividing cells preferentially absorb leucovorin; hence, it decreases the action of methotrexate, thereby decreasing methotrexate's adverse systemic effects. This regimen involves administration of methotrexate as 1 mg/kg IM on days 0, 2, 4, and 6, followed by 4 doses of leucovorin as 0. 1 mg/kg on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Because of a higher incidence of adverse effects and the increased need for patient motivation and compliance, the multiple dosage regimen has fallen out of or in the United States. Single-dose regimen The more popular regimen today is the single-dose injection, which involves injection of methotrexate as 50 mg/m2 IM in a single injection or as a divided dose injected into each buttock. Studies comparing the multiple methotrexate dosage regimen with the single dosage regimen have demonstrated that the 2 methods have similar efficacy. With smaller dosing and fewer injections, fewer adverse effects are anticipated, and the use of leucovorin can be abandoned. The protocol for single-dose methotrexate is detailed below. Using this protocol, Stovall et al achieved a 96% success rate with a single injection of methotrexate. Day 0 Obtain b-HCG level, ultrasonography, and +/- dilatation and curettage. Day 1 Obtain levels of the following: b-HCG Liver function - Eg, aspaate aminotransferase (AST or serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase ), alanine aminotransferase (ALT or serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase ) Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Creatinine Evidence of hepatic or renal compromise is a contraindication to methotrexate therapy.
