(i) Release of calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum, (ii) inhibition of phosphodiesterase and (iii) blockade of adenosine receptors. Coicosteroids benefit in asthma by reducing bronchial hyper-reactivity, mucosal edema and by suppressing inflammatory response to antigen: antibody reaction or other trigger stimuli. Beta agonists/sympathomimetics causes bronchodilatation through beta2 receptor stimulation --n increased c. AMP formation in bronchial muscle cell relaxation. Cholinergic drugs will precipitate asthma, by causing bronchoconstriction (instead anticholinergic drugs/atropine is used, which causes bronchodilatation by blocking cholinergic constrictor tone).",

Causal prophylaxis: This prevents the establishment of infection in the liver by inhibiting the pre-erythrocytic schizogony. Primaquine and proguanil are effective as causal prophylactic drugs. Suppressive prophylaxis: Use of blood schizonticides suppresses the blood forms of the malaria parasite and thus protects against clinical illness. However, P. vivax and P. ovale may cause relapses from the hypnozoites and to prevent this, terminal prophylaxis may be needed. (B) Terminal Prophylaxis: Terminal prophylaxis is the administration of Primaquine for two weeks after returning from travel to tackle the hypnozoites of P. vivax and P. ovale that can cause relapses of malaria. It is indicated only for persons who have had prolonged exposure in malaria-endemic regions, such as expatriates and long-term travellers like missionaries and Peace Corps volunteers.

Methadone is a synthetic opioid chemically dissimilar but pharmacologically very similar to morphine. Methadone is used as substitution therapy in opioid dependence. The basic aim is to replace an opioid with another opioid that has the following propeies. - Lower abuse/addiction potential - Incapable of a giving a kick - Where tolerance develops slowly - Withdrawl syndrome develops gradually - Legally accessible - Can be taken orally and has a relatively long half life. These propeies of the drug help in blocking heroin induced euphoria while decreasing craving. - Methadone occupies the opioid receptor thus reducing the desire to take other opioids. - Addicts who are cooperative enough to take oral methadone experience reduced craving and less kick/buzz/rush from intravenous heroin because their opioid receptor are already occupied by methadone and the intravenous drug must compete with it. - This helps the patient to maintain abstinence for opioids. - Over three quaers off patients in well supervised clinics are likely to remain heroin free for 26 months. - After a period of maintenance (usually 6 months to -2. 1 year) the dose of methadone is gradually tapered off. Alternative medicines that have been used for maintenance treatment are:? Buprenorphine: - Buprenorphine is a paial agonist at the p receptor. Buprenorphine has several advantages over methadone. - Low overdose danger - Potentially easier detoxification than with methadone. - Probable ceiling effect in which higher doses do not increase euphoria. Opioid antagonists (Naltrexone) Naltrexone is a competitive opioid antagonist at it, cS, 7C It is long acting. It can be used orally to assist in the rehabilitation of ex opioid abusers who are fully withdrawn from opioids (otherwise it will induce an acute withdraw! syndrome). A patient who then takes an opioid fails to experience the \"kick\" or euphoria. Naltrexone does not reduce the craving. Use of clonidine in opioid withdrawl: -(Goodman Gilman 11th/e p. 619) Clonidine is an a2 adrenergic agonist that decreases adrenergic neurotransmission from locus ceruleus. Most of the autonomic symptoms of opioid withdrawl results from loss of opioid suppression of locus ceruleus. Clonidine acts distinct receptor but by cellular mechanisms that mimic opioid effects. So it can allete many of the symptoms of opioid withdrawl. Postural hypotension is common with opioid withdrawl, therefore, dose of clonidine, must be titrated according to the stage and severity of withdraw!. Ioxfexidine It is also an a2 adrenergic agonist. It has greater selectivity for a2. Aadrenergic receptors and is associated with less hypotension.",

        "exp": "Spironolactone is a competitive antagonist of the aldosterone receptor. Hypokalemia and hypertension in patients with primary aldosteronism can be controlled by spironolactone, 50-100 mg/d. Although spironolactone is an effective aldosterone receptor antagonist, it is not without side effects that can limit its use in the chronic treatment of this disease. The most impoant are anti-androgenic reactions. Spironolactone acts as an antiandrogen by decreasing the production of testosterone by the adrenal gland and by preventing DHT (dihydrotestosterone) from binding to its androgen receptor. As a result of this, in the long run, gynecomastia occurs in more than 10% of the treated men. Impotence, loss of libido, and menstrual irregularities are also common side effects of spironolactone therapy. On the other side, these spironolactone features are the basis for its usage in the treatment of hirsutism, acne, and alopecia. Spironolactone is also used by transsexuals in the feminizing regimen because of its anti-androgenic actions. Cardiac arrhythmia is not a frequent adverse reaction to spironolactone treatment, and it is seen only in the presence of significant hyperkalemia. Dehydration is usually very mild, and can be prevented with adequate water intake. Hyperkalemia develops in 5-10% of treated patients, especially if renal function is compromised, or the patient is diabetic, or elderly. Also Know: Spironolactone (Aldactone) is a direct aldosterone receptor antagonist in collecting tubules. It acts to inhibit aldosterone-mediated Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion. Ref: Morgan, Jr. G.

        "question": "Herceptin is used for which cancer?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Breast Herceptin (Trastuzumab) Herceptin is a humanized antibody and is used in breast cancers which are HER2 positive. HER2 stands for:- human epidermal growth factor receptor. HER2 gene produces HER2 protein also called HER2 receptor. The HER2 protein is found on the surface of some normal cells in the body. In normal cells HER2 protein help send growth signals from outside the cell to the inside of the cell. These signals tell the cell to grow and divide. In HER2 (+ve) breast cancer the cancer cells have abnormally high number of HER2 genes per cell when this happens too much HER2 protein appears on the surface of these cancer cells. This is called HER2 protein over expression. Too much HER2 protein is thought to cause cancer cells to grow and divide uncontrollably. Herceptin acts in two ways: a) Herceptin attaches to HER2+ cancer cells and stimulates the bodys immune system to target the HER2-icancer cells b) Herceptin attaches itself to the HER2 receptors on the surface and blocks them from receiving the signals. Currently transtuzumab is approved for HER2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer in combination with paclitaxel as initial treatment or as monotherapy following chemotherapy.",

Mechanism of action: The. 4, drugs act by activating lipoprotein lipase which is a key enzyme in the degradation of VLDL. This effect is exeed through nuclear receptor, PPAR a (peroxisome proliferators activated receptor alpha) - The PPAR a are class of intracellular receptor that modulate carbohydrate and fat metabolism and adipose tissue differentiation. Major effect of the fibrates is to reduce triglycerides TG (contained in VLDL) and to increase HDL. Fibrates also reduce plasma fibrinogen level. They are first line drugs in dysbetalipoproteinenzias and hyperiglyceridimias Pharmacokinetics of fibrates:? Fibric acid derivatives are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, extensively bound to plasma proteins and are excreted mainly by the kidney as unchanged drug or metabolite. Absorption of fibrates in improved when the drug in taken with food. They are contraindicated when hepatic or renal function is severely impaired. Adverse effects of fibrates:? Fibrates can induce a myositis like syndrome, the risk is greater in patient with poor renal function and in those who are also receiving a statin.

Variant angina o Variant angina occurs due to coronary vasospasm. b-blockers exacerbates coronary vasconstriction by unopposed alpha-mediated action. 3. Paial and complete heart block o b1-receptors increase conduction in AV node. b-blockers decrease conduction by reducing sympathetic drive on b1-receptors --> Worsening of block. 4. Bradycardia o P-blockers reduce heart rate by reducing sympathetic tone on b1 receptors --> worsening of bradycardia (Cardiac arrest may occur). 5. Hypoglycemia b2 receptors increase blood glucose by enhancing glycogenolysis and gluconeogenosis. o b blocker cause worsening of hypoglycemia by blocking normal sympathetic-mediated homeostatic mechanism for maintaining the blood glucose b2 receptors. 6. Decompensated heart failure o First let me clear, what is decompensated heart failure. o Acute heart failure (acute left ventricular failure) is called decompensated heart failure. o The two primary hemodynamic derangement in acute HF are elevated left ventricular filling pressure and decreased cardiac output. o Because these derangement are not compensated by compensatory mechanism in acute LF it is called decompensated HF. o Sympathetic system provide critical suppo to hea for compensation. o b-blockers are contraindicated in this condition because they will fuher depress the hea. About option 'd' o Congesitive heart failure (CHF) is chronic or compensated heart failure. o In CHF the primary pathological changes are due to overactivity of sympathetic system and RAA system. o Overactivity of cardiac b-receptors in CHF accelerate myocyte apoptosis and promotes functionallly unourable remodeling. o So, in CHF ft-blocker can be used, but they should be staed at lowest possible dose with gradual increment. o b-blockers are one of the group of drugs which decrease diseae progression and moality in CHF (Other drugs are ACE inhibitors, AT, antagonists, Spironolactone). Remember o b-blockers are contraindicated in decompensated or acute HF. o b-blockers can be used in congestive, chronic or compensated HF. 7.

        "question": "Which of the following drugs is both antiresoptiveand bone formative?",
        "exp": "Strontium Ranelate Osteoporosis is an abnormal decrease in amount orbone, but whatever left, is of normal quality. It results from bone loss due to age related changes in bone remodelling. In adult bones, remodelling is the principal metabolic skeletal process. - During remodelling the bone is, first resorbed by osteoclasts and is then replaced by an equal amount of bone tissue due to action of osteoblasts. - This process of bone resorption and formation goes on throughout the adult life, and it serves two purposes. - To repair the microdamage within the skeleton. - To supply calcium. from the skeleton to maintain serum calcium. In young adult the resorbed bone is replaced by an equal amount of new bone tissue. Thus the mass of skeleton remains constant after peak bone mass in achieved in adulthood. However after the age of 35-40 the resorption and formation processes becomes imbalanced and resorption exceeds formation. - Excessive bone loss can be due to an increase in osteoclastic activity and or decrease in osteoblastic activity. Mechanism of action of Strontium Ranelate in the tit of osteoporosis. Strontium Ranelate increases bone mass throughout the skeleton. It appears to be modestly antiresorptive while at the same time not causing much decrease in bone fonnation. - Strontium is incorporated into hydroxyappatite replacing calcium, a feature that might explain some of its. fracture benefit. It is approved in several European countries for the t/ t of osteoporosis. Pharmacological agents used to manage osteoporosis either act by - Decreasing the rate of bone resorption (antiresorptive therapy.) - Promoting bone formation (anabolic therapy). Since bone remodelling is a coupled process, antiresorptive drugs ultimately decrease the rate of bone. formation and therefore do not promote substantial gains in BMD. \"Thus, Strontium renelate is unique because it decreases osteoclastosis as well as promote bone formation. \" More on tit of osteoporosis Pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis is generally aimed at restoring bone strength and preventing. fractures. The long standing centrepiece of this approach has been antiresorptive drugs such as:? - Biphosphonate - Estrogen - Selective estrogen receptor modulator, Raloxifene - Calcitonin Until recently, antiresorptive drugs were the only drugs approved in the United States, for treating osteoporosis. This situation changed in 2002 when FDA approved Teriparatide (the biologically active PTH fragment). Teriparatide acts by increasing the bone mass - Because teriparatide stimulates bone formation whereas biphosphonates reduce bone resorption, it was predicted that therapy combining the two would enhance the effect on bone marrow density more than treatment with either one alone. - However addition of teriparatide to alendronate provided no additional bebefit for bone mass density. Before the advent of strontium Ranelate there was'nt any drug which combined the two processes i. e., increasing bone formation and at the same time, decreasing bone resorption. Strontium Ranelate has a novel mechanism of action for an osteoporotic drug as it acts on bone resorption to reduce the rate of hone growth but also acts on bone formation promoting the growth of new bone. More on antiresorptive therapies for osteoporosis: Biphosphonates Alendronate, Pamidronctte Most effective drugs currently approved for prevention and t/t of osteoporosis. They suppress bone resorption at doses that do not inhibit mineralization. Thiazide diuretics They are not strictly antiresorptive but they reduce urinary Cat` excretion and constrain bone loss in patients with hypercalciurea. Estrogen There is an unambiguous relationship between estrogen deficiency and osteoporosis. Post menopausal status or estrogen deficiency at any stage significantly increases patient's risk. for osteoporosis. Selective Estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) These are estrogenic compounds with tissue selective activities. Raloxifene (SERM) acts as an estrogen agonist on bone and liver and is inactive on the uterus. Calcitonin Calcitonin inhibits oteoclastic bone resorption.",

        "exp": "Competitive inhibition _of ATP binding site of ABL kinase [Ref. Harrison 16thie p 4781 CML is characterized by the presence of a distinctive molecular abnormality namely philadelphia chromosome. Philadelphia chromosome in formed as a result of reciprocal translocation between long arm of chromosome 22 and chromosome 9 i. e. t (9; 22). ABL protooncogene from chromosome 9 is translocated to chromosome 22 where BCR is present and results in formation of BCR-ABL fusion chimeric gene. The drug imatinib mesylate is a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase signal transduction inhibitor. This drug acts as a inhibitor of the ATP binding site on the protein and prevents its phosphorylation and thus its activity. An impoant point CML is caused by reciprocal translocation between BCR and ABL gene located on chromosome 9 and 22. Imatinib mesylate does not block this translocation i. e., BCR ABL translocation. - Instead, it blocks the constitutive abnormal tyrosine kinase, BCR-ABL that is created by the Philadelphia chromose (BCR-ABL). - The drug inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis in BCR-ABL positive cells. Also know Protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors Protein kinases are ubiquitous and critical components of signal transduction pathways that transmit information concerning extra cellular or cytoplasmic conditions to the nucleus, thereby influencing gene transcription and/or DNA synthesis. The protein kinases can be classified into three categories: (i) Tyrosine kinase (ii) Serine threonine kinase (iii) Kinases with activity for all three residues Abnormal activation of specific tyrosine kinase has been demonstrated in many human neoplasms. Thus they can be targeted in ceain cancer therapies. There currently are three small-molecular weight protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are FDA approved and many others are in clinical trials. i) Imatinib Imatinib has efficacy in diseases in which the ABL, KIT or PDGFR have dominant roles in driving the proliferation of the tumour. Thus, imatinib shows remarkable therapeutic benefits in patients with - CML (BCR-ABL) - GIST (KIT mutation positive) - CMML (EVT6-PDGFR) ii) Gefitinib The epidennal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the family of tyrosine kinase. Gefitinid is a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase that competitively inhibits ATP binding. EGFR is overexpressed in non-small cell carcinoma of lung, thus Gefitinib has been approved for use in non-small cell carcinoma. iii) Erlotinib It is a human HERI/EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is indicated for patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Acetaminophen Patterns of liver injuries A. Zonal Necrosis This is the most common type of drug induced liver cell necrosis where the injury is largely confined to a paicular zone of the liver lobule. It may manifest as very high level of ALT and severe disturbance of liver function leading to acute liver failure. Causes include: Carbon tetrachloride Paracetamol Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is usually well tolerated in prescribed dose but overdose is the most common cause of drug induced liver disease and acute liver failure worldwide. Damage to the liver is not due to the drug itself but to a toxic metabolite (N-acetyl- p-benzoquinone imine NAPQI, or NABQI) which is produced by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. In normal circumstances this metabolite is detoxified by conjugating with glutathione in phase 2 reaction. In overdose large amount of NAPQI is generated which overwhelm the detoxification process and lead to damage to liver cells. Administration of Acetylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione, can limit the severity of the liver damage by capturing the toxic NAPQI. B. Hepatitis In this pattern hepatocellular necrosis is associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells. There can be three types of drug induced hepatitis. Viral hepatitis type picture is the commonest, where histological features are similar to acute viral hepatitis. Causes include: Halothane, isoniazid, phenytoin In the focal or non specific hepatitis scattered foci of cell necrosis may accompany lymphocytic infiltrate. Causes include: Aspirin Chronic hepatitis type is very similar to autoimmune hepatitis clinically, serologically as well as histologically. Causes include: Methyldopa, diclofenac C. Cholestasis Liver injury leads to impairment of bile flow and clinical picture is predominated by itching and jaundice. Histology may show inflammation (cholestatic hepatitis) or it can be bland without any parenchymal inflammation. In rare occasions it can produce features similar to primary biliary cirrhosis due to progressive destruction of small bile ducts (Vanishing duct syndrome). Causes include: Bland: Oral contraceptive pills, anabolic steroid, androgens Inflammatory: Allopurinol, co-amoxiclav, carbamazepine Ductal: Chlorpromazine, flucloxacillin D. Steatosis Hepatotoxicity may manifest as triglyceride accumulation which leads to either small droplet (microvesicular) or large droplet (macrovesicular) fatty liver. There is a separate type of steatosis where phospholipid accumulation leads to a pattern similar to the diseases with inherited phospholipid metabolism defects (e. g. Tay-Sachs disease). Causes include: Microvesicular: Aspirin (Reye's syndrome), ketoprofen, tetracycline Macrovesicular: Acetamenophen, methotrexate Phospholipidosis: Amiodarone, total parenteral nutrition E. Granuloma Drug induced hepatic granulomas are usually associated with granulomas in other tissues and patients typically have features of systemic vasculitis and hypersensitivity. Causes include: Allopurinol, phenytoin, isoniazid, quinine, penicillin, quinidine F. Vascular lesions They result from injury to the vascular endothelium. Peliosis hepatis: anabolic steroid Hepatic vein thrombosis: Oral contraceptives G. Neoplasm Neoplasms have been described with prolonged exposure to some medications or toxins. Hepatocellular carcinoma, angiosarcoma and liver adenomas are the ones usually repoed. Causes include: Vinyl chloride, combined oral contraceptive pill, anabolic steroid, arsenic, thorotrast",

At the \u03b11B-adrenoceptor of the rat spleen and rabbit corpus cavernosum penis, tamsulosin again acted as a competitive antagonist but with a significantly lower affinity (p. KB=8. 9-9. 2). Tamsulosin acted as an insurmountable antagonist of the \u03b11A-adrenoceptor-mediated responses of the rat and human vas deferens, reducing maximal responses to phenylephrine by 20% and 50%, respectively, at an antagonist concentration of 1 nm. Responses of depolarized (100 mm KCl) rat vas deferens preparations were unaffected by 10 nm tamsulosin but this concentration reduced maximal responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in this tissue. When longer antagonist incubation periods (\u2a7e60 min) were used, tamsulosin behaved as a competitive antagonist on the human prostate with a significantly higher affinity (p.

        "exp": "Ans. C: Lorazepam Intravenous Lorazepam is now the treatment of choice for controlling seizures in status epilepticus Status epilepticus/SE It is a life-threatening condition in which the brain is in a state of persistent seizure. Definitions vary, but traditionally it is defined as one continuous unremitting seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes, or recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness between seizures for greater than 5 minutes. It is always considered a medical emergency. There is some evidence that 5 minutes is sufficient to damage neurons and that seizures are unlikely to self-terminate by that time. The moality rate of status epilepticus has the potential to be quite high (at least 20%), especially if treatment is not initiated quickly. Only 25 percent of people who experience seizures or status epilepticus have epilepsy. Causes include: - Stroke - Hemorrhage - Insufficient dosage of a medication already prescribed to the patient. Such causes of this include: Forgetfulness on the pa of the patient in taking scheduled doses, or failure to take doses at the scheduled times Taking medicine at wrong times as a result of a time zone change while traveling Dislike of the medication or its side effects - Sudden withdrawal from a seizure medication. Such causes include: - Consumption of alcoholic beverages while on an anticonvulsant, or alcohol withdrawal. Dieting or fasting while on an anticonvulsant - Staing on a new medication that reduces the effectiveness of the anticonvulsant - Developing a resistance to an anticonvulsant already being used Gastroenteritis while on an anticonvulsant. This is because the digestive system may force out the anticonvulsant, thereby rendering the body with a lack of protection - Metabolic disturbances--such as affected kidney and liver Status epilepticus can be divided into two categories -- convulsive and nonconvulsive, the latter of which is underdiagnosed The benzodiazepine of choice is lorazepam for initial treatment due to its relatively long (2-8 hour) duration of action when injected, and its rapid onset of action, which is thought to be due to its high affinity for GABA receptors and to its low lipid solubility which causes it to remain in the vascular compament. If lorazepam is not available, or intravenous access is not possible, then diazepam should be given. Paicularly in children another, increasingly popular treatment choice is buccal and intranasal midazolam, which can be given into the side of the mouth.",

        "exp": "Ans. A: Formic Acid The initial step in the metabolism of methanol involves the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). First, methanol is slowly oxidized by ADH to yield formaldehyde. Next, formaldehyde is oxidized by formaldehyde dehydrogenase to yield formic acid (or formate, depending on the pH). This oxidation occurs rapidly so that little formaldehyde accumulates in the serum. Finally, formic acid is metabolized to carbon dioxide and water, which are excreted by the kidneys and lungs. The accumulation of formic acid is responsible for the presence of metabolic acidosis. Formic acid also inhibits cellular respiration leading to lactic acidosis. The ocular injury caused by methanol may be due to retinal injury, which results from intra-retinal metabolism of methanol and the accumulation of formic acid. Alternatively, it may be caused be the inhibition of normal metabolism in optic nerve calls.",

        "exp": "Ans. C: General Anesthesia Alpha-adrenoceptor agonists bind to alpha-receptors on vascular smooth muscle and induce smooth contraction and vasoconstriction, thus mimicking the effects of sympathetic adrenergic nerve activation to the blood vessels. Vascular smooth muscle has two types of alpha-adrenoceptors: alphal and alpha2. The alphal-adrenoceptors are the predominant alpha-receptor located on vascular smooth muscle. Depending on the tissue and type of vessel, there are also alpha2-adrenoceptors found on the smooth muscle. There are also alpha2-adrenoceptors located on the sympathetic nerve terminals that inhibit the release of norepinephrine and therefore act as a feedback mechanism for modulating the release of norepinephrine. Alpha-agonists constrict both aeries and veins; however, the vasoconstrictor effect is more pronounced in the aerial resistance vessels (small aeries and aerioles). Alphal-adrenoceptor agonists (systemic vasoconstrictors) Methoxamine Phenylephrine Oxymetazoline Tetrahydralazine Xylometazoline Methoxamine and phenylephrine are used as pressor agents in treating hypotension and shock. Oxymetazoline, tetrahydralazine, xylometazoline and some preparations of phenylephrine are used as nasal decongestants.

Oligomycin A is an inhibitor of ATP synthase. Oligomycin A inhibits ATP synthase by blocking its proton channel (Fo subunit), which is necessary for oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to ATP (energy production). The inhibition of ATP synthesis by oligomycin A will significantly reduce electron flow through the electron transpo chain; however, electron flow is not stopped completely due to a process known as proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling. This process is due to the facilitated diffusion of protons into the mitochondrial matrix through an uncoupling protein such as thermogenin, or UCP 1.

A: Inhibits the synthesis of uric acid Allopurinol is a structural isomer of hypoxanthine (a naturally occurring purine in the body) and is an enzyme inhibitor, inhibiting xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase is responsible for the successive oxidation of hypoxanthine and xanthine resulting in the production of uric acid, the product of human purine metabolism. In addition to blocking uric acid production, inhibition of xanthine oxidase causes an increase in hypoxanthine and xanthine, which are conveed to closely related purine ribotides adenosine and guanosine monophosphates. Increased levels of these ribotides cause feedback inhibition of amidophosphoribosyl transferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of purine biosynthesis. Allopurinol therefore decreases both uric acid formation and purine synthesis.",

        "question": "All of the following drug is CYP3A inhibitor except a. EUR'",
        "exp": "Saquinavir Drug metabolism Drug metabolism is divided into two genera! categories of phase I and phase II transformation reactions. Phase I This involves structural alteration of drug typically by processes involving oxidation, hydrolysis and reduction. - Phase I reactions introduce functional groups in drugs. - Reactions carried out by phase 1 enzymes usually lead to inactivation of an active drug. Phase II Phase II reactions usually involve conjugation reactions (glucuronidation, suftation, methylation). - Phase 11 reactions produce a metabolite with improved water solubility and increased molecular weight which serves to facilitate the elimination of the drug from the tissue. Most phase I reactions are carried out by P 450 family of isozymes The cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) enzymes are found primarily in the gut and liver. Their name is derived from their characteristic of maximal absorption at wavelength of 450 nm. The cytochrome P 450 is a large superfamily of \"haem\" proteins. All enzymes in the superfamily contain a molecule of haem. The cytochrome P 450 isoenzymes are also indicated by the letter \"CYP\" (from cytochrome P 450) followed by number denoting a, family group, then a subfamily letter and then a number for the individual enzyme within the family. Thus, CYP3. A4 is Family Subfamily No. of the individual enzyme within the family The \"CYP\" isoenzymes have many features that give them great variability in action, both within and among individual. The CYP's have a tremendous capacity to metabolize a large number of structurally diverse chemicals. This is both due to multiple forms of CYP's and the capacity of a single CYP to metabolize many structurally distinct chemicals.. In contrast to other enzymes of the body which are highly specific, CYP's are promiscuous in nature i. e. they catalyze large no of substrates. - This unsual feature of extensive overlapping substrate specificities by the CYP's is one of the underlying reasons for the predominance of drug -- drug interactions. - When two coadministered drugs are both metabolized by a single CYP, they compete for binding to the enzymes active site. - This can result in the inhibition of the metabolism of one or both of the drugs, leading to elevated plasma levels of the drug. Induction and inhibition of CYP's is also an impoant source of drug-drug interactions. Some drugs can also inhibit CYP's independently of being substrates for CYP's. - For example ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3. A4 and other CYPS and coadministration of ketoconazole with other drugs such as the HIV viral protease inhibitors reduce the clearance of those drugs and increases their plasma concentration and the risk of toxicity. Some drugs are CYP inducers that can induce not only their own metabolism but also induce metabolism of other coadministered drugs. CYP3A is the most abundant, clinically significant group of cytochrome P-450 isoetzzymes. The CYP3A group is composed of four major isoenzymes CYP3. A3 - CYP3. A4 - CYP3. A5 - CYP3. A7 Among these CYP3. A4 is the most common and is implicated in the majority of drug interactions. - However since these enzymes are so closely related (having as much as 97% sequence homology they often are referred to collectively by the subfamily name CYP3A). Upto 60% of the liver's total cytochrome P-450 is CYP3A and nearly 50% of all clinically relevant medications are metabolized by CYP3A.

        "question": "Increased prolactin is associated with a. EUR'",
        "exp": "Increased estradial Prolactin is a polypeptide produced by the lactotrophs of the pituitary. It is responsible. for the initiation and maintenance of lactation. As with several pituitary hormones, prolactin is secreted in a circadian, fashion with the highest levels being attained during sleep and a nadir occurring between 10 am and noon. Prolactin is secreted in a pulsatile. fashion, the amplitude and frequency of which not only varies throughout the day but is also impacted upon by a variety of physiology stimuli i. e., suckling, stress and increased level of ovarian steroids primarily estrogens. \"The general view is that lactotrophs have spontaneously high secretary activity\". Therefore pituitary prolactin secretion is under a tonic and predominantly inhibitory control exeed by the hypothalamus. - Hypothalmus releases prolactin inhibitory factor (PIF) which inhibits prolactin release. - PIE is actually dopamine and it suppresses prolactin synthesis and secretion by means of D2 receptors. - These actions constitute the physiologic basis of therapeutic effect of dopamine agonists in hyperprolactinemia. Prolactin acts on the breast tissue where in the setting of estrogen priming, it stimulates lactation. Effect of physiological hormones on prolactin secretion Glucocoicoids seem to have an inhibitory role on PRL secretion. - These hormones stimulate the differentiation of somatotrophs but suppress that of lactotrophs. - Long-term elevation of the serum glucocoicoid levels by chronic administration of coicotrophin (ACTH) or hydrocoisone or by prolonged stress decreases PRL secretion. Estrogens and thyroid hormones have opposite effects on PRL synthesis and release. - \"Estrogen increases prolactin levelQ by acting at both pituitary and hypothalamic level\" - At pituitary level it increases prolactin secretion by controlling PRL gene expression and modifying its sensitivity to physiological stimuli. - At hypothalamic level it inhibits the activity of all three types of hypothalamic neuroendocrine dopaminergic neurone. - Low thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels increase TRH-induced PRL secretion, whereas high T4 and T3 levels inhibit PRL m. RNA accumulation and release. An impoant point Increased estrogen causes hyperprolactinemia But Hyperprolactinemia causes decrease in estrogen Prolactin also acts at the hypothalamus to inhibit the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (Gn. RH). - Inhibition of Gn. RH results in a decrease in the release of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary. In females - This leads to decreased in estrogen and progesterone synthesis and secretion by the ovaries and a failure of ovarian. follicular maturation. In males - This leads to decrease in testicular production and synthesis of testosterone and a halt in spermatogenesis.

        "question": "Resistance to drugs in tuberculosis develops by: March 2011, March 2013",
        "exp": "Ans. D: Mutation MDR-TB strains could arise as a consequence of sequential accumulation of mutations conferring resistance to single agents, or by a single step process such as acquisition of an MDR element. Resistance to common anti-TB drugs The most common mechanism of INH resistance is by mutation of the catalas-peroxidase gene so that the bacilli do not generate the active metabolite of 1. NH. Rifampicin resistance is nearly always due to mutation in the repoB gene (for the beta subunit of RNA polymerase-the target of rifampin action) reducing its affinity for the drug Resistance to Pyrazinamide develops due to mutation in the pncA gene which encodes for the enzyme generating the active metabolite of pyrazinamide Classification of mutation A. By effect on structure: Small-scale mutations, such as those affecting a small gene in one or a few nucleotides, including: - Point mutations, often caused by chemicals or malfunction of DNA replication, exchange a single nucleotide for another. - These changes are classified as transitions or transversions. - Most common is the transition that exchanges a purine for a purine (A 4-, G) or a pyrimidine for a pyrimidine, (C T). - A transition can be caused by nitrous acid, base mis-pairing, or mutagenic base analogs such as 5-bromo-2 deoxyuridine (BrdU). - Less common is a transversion, which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine (C/T A/G). - An example of a transversion is adenine (A) being conveed into a cytosine (C). - A point mutation can be reversed by another point mutation, in which the nucleotide is changed back to its original state (true reversion) or by second-site reversion (a complementary mutation elsewhere that results in regained gene functionality). - Point mutations that occur within the protein coding region of a gene may be classified into three kinds, depending upon what the erroneous codon codes for: Silent mutations: which code for the same amino acid. Missense mutations: which code for a different amino acid. Nonsense mutations: which code for a stop and can truncate the protein. - Inseions add one or more extra nucleotides into the DNA. They are usually caused by transposable elements, or errors during replication of repeating elements. - Inseions in the coding region of a gene may alter splicing of the m. RNA (splice site mutation), or cause a shift in the reading frame (frameshift), both of which can significantly alter the gene product. - Inseions can be reveed by excision of the transposable element. - Deletions remove one or more nucleotides from the DNA. - Like inseions, these mutations can alter the reading frame of the gene. - They are generally irreversible Note that a deletion is not the exact opposite of an inseion: the former is quite random while the latter consists of a specific sequence inseing at locations that are not entirely random or even quite narrowly defined. Large-scale mutations in chromosomal structure, including: Amplifications (or gene duplications) leading to multiple copies of all chromosomal regions, increasing the dosage of the genes located within them. - Deletions of large chromosomal regions, leading to loss of the genes within those regions. - Mutations whose effect is to juxtapose previously separate pieces of DNA, potentially bringing together separate genes to form functionally distinct fusion genes (e. g. bcr-abl). These include: Chromosomal translocations: Interchange of genetic pas from nonhomologous chromosomes. Interstitial deletions: An intra-chromosomal deletion that removes a segment of DNA from a single chromosome, thereby apposing previously distant genes. For example, cells isolated from a human astrocytoma, a type of brain tumor, were found to have a chromosomal deletion removing sequences between the \"fused in glioblastoma\" (fig) gene and the receptor tyrosine kinase \"ros\", producing a fusion protein (FIG-ROS). The abnormal FIG-ROS fusion protein has constitutively active kinase activity that causes oncogenic transformation (a transformation from normal cells to cancer cells). Chromosomal inversions: Reversing the orientation of a chromosomal segment. - Loss of heterozygosity: Loss of one allele, either by a deletion or recombination event, in an organism that previously had two different alleles. B. By effect on function Loss-of-function mutations are the result of gene product having less or no function. When the allele has a complete loss of function (null allele) it is often called an amorphic mutation. Phenotypes associated with such mutations are most often recessive. Exceptions are when the organism is haploid, or when the reduced dosage of a normal gene product is not enough for a normal phenotype (this is called haploinsufficiency). Gain-of-function mutations change the gene product such that it gains a new and abnormal function. These mutations usually have dominant phenotypes. Often called a neomorphic mutation. Dominant negative mutations (also called antimorphic mutations) have an altered gene product that acts antagonistically to the wild-type allele. These mutations usually result in an altered molecular function (often inactive) and are characterised by a dominant or semi-dominant phenotype. In humans, Marfan syndrome is an example of a dominant negative mutation occurring in an autosomal dominant disease. In this condition, the defective glycoprotein product of the fibrillin gene (FBN1) antagonizes the product of the normal allele. Lethal mutations are mutations that lead to the death of the organisms which carry the mutations. A back mutation or reversion is a point mutation that restores the original sequence and hence the original phenotype. C. By effect on fitness In applied genetics it is usual to speak of mutations as either harmful or beneficial A harmful mutation is a mutation that decreases the fitness of the organism. A beneficial mutation is a mutation that increases fitness of the organism, or which promotes traits that are desirable. In theoretical population genetics, it is more usual to speak of such mutations as deleterious or advantageous. A neutral mutation has no harmful or beneficial effect on the organism. Such mutations occur at a steady rate, forming the basis for the molecular clock. A deleterious mutation has a negative effect on the phenotype, and thus decreases the fitness of the organism. An advantageous mutation has a positive effect on the phenotype, and thus increases the fitness of the organism. A nearly neutral mutation is a mutation that may be slightly deleterious or advantageous, although most nearly neutral mutations are slightly deleterious. D. By pattern of inheritance: The human genome contains two copies of each gene - a paternal and a maternal allele. A heterozygous mutation is a mutation of only one allele. A homozygous mutation is an identical mutation of both the paternal and maternal alleles. Compound heterozygous mutations or a genetic compound comprises two different mutations in the paternal and maternal alleles. A wildtype or homozygous non-mutated organism is one in which neither allele is mutated. (Just not a mutation) E. By impact on protein sequence A frameshift mutation is a mutation caused by inseion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not evenly divisible by three from a DNA sequence. Due to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons, the inseion or deletion can disrupt the reading frame, or the grouping of the codons, resulting in a completely different translation from the original. The earlier in the sequence the deletion or inseion occurs, the more altered the protein produced is. In contrast, any inseion or deletion that is evenly divisible by three is termed an in-frame mutation A nonsense mutation is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon, or a nonsense codon in the transcribed m. RNA, and possibly a truncated, and often nonfunctional protein product Missense mutations or nonsynonymous mutations are types of point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to cause substitution of a different amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa, sickle-cell disease. A neutral mutation is a mutation that occurs in an amino acid codon which results in the use of a different, but chemically similar, amino acid. The similarity between the two is enough that little or no change is often rendered in the protein. For example, a change from AAA to AGA will encode arginine, a chemically similar molecule to the intended lysine. Silent mutations are mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid sequence of a protein. They may occur in a region that does not code for a protein, or they may occur within a codon in a manner that does not alter the final amino acid sequence. The phrase silent mutation is often used interchangeably with the phrase synonymous mutation; however, synonymous mutations are a subcategory of the former, occurring only within exons. The name silent could be a misnomer. For example, a silent mutation in the exon/intron border may lead to alternative splicing by changing the splice site, thereby leading to a changed protein. Silent mutations occur because of the degenerate nature of the genetic code. F. Special classes Conditional mutation is a mutation that has wild-type (or less severe) phenotype under ceain \"permissive\" environmental conditions and a mutant phenotype under ceain \"restrictive\" conditions. For example, a temperature-sensitive mutation can cause cell death at high temperature (restrictive condition), but might have no deleterious consequences at a lower temperature (permissive condition).",

Hepatic lipase - Conves IDL to LDL by hydrolysing the triglyceride content of IDL. Hormone sensitive lipase - Present intracellularly in peripheral tissue and causes intracellular lipolysis by hydrolysing triglycerides. Niacin (Nicotinic acid) inhibits intracellular lipolysis by inhibiting hormone sensitive lipase - intracellular FFA to liver - 4. 1, triglyceride synthesis. Niacin also increases the activity of lipoprotein lipase - T hydrolysis of VLDL triglyceride. Nicotinic acid also reduces the production of VLDL in liver by inhibiting TG-synthesis - indirectly the VLDL degradation products IDL and LDL are also reduced. Nicotinic acid is the most effective drug to raise HDL-CH. Increased HDL is due to interference of direct pathway of HDL cholesterol to liver which involves apo-Ai - Niacin decreases apo- A, mediated hepatic clearance.

This leads to disruption of the mitotic spindle apparatus and results in metaphase arrest since the chromosomes are unable to segregate. Since these drugs interfere with mitosis, they are considered cell-cycle specific for the M phase. Cytarabine belongs to the class of antineoplastics that are antimetabolites. This drug class interferes with normal metabolic pathways by competing for enzymatic sites. Specifically, cytarabine (Ara-C) is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog. It interrupts DNA synthesis and function by inhibiting DNA polymerase and incorporating into the DNA or RNA of the cell. As you would expect, this drug is cell-cycle specific for the S phase. Daunorubicin is one of the antibiotic antineoplastic agents (others include dactinomycin, doxorubicin, bleomycin, plicamycin, and mitomycin). These agents work by disrupting DNA functioning. Daunorubicin binds to DNA between base pairs on adjacent strands, resulting in uncoiling of the helix and destruction of the DNA template. While this drug has its maximum effect during the S phase, it is not cell-cycle specific. (Note: the only antibiotic that is cell-cycle specific is bleomycin.) Hydroxyurea works by interfering with ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, the enzyme responsible for generating the deoxyribonucleotides needed for DNA synthesis. It is S-phase specific.

Whereas voiding requires contraction of detrusor -accompanied by relaxation of sphincters. Since detrusor contracts under parasympathetic influence, anticholinergic (specifically antimuscarinic) drugs are used to treat overactive bladder disease or detrusor instability. Overactive urinary bladder can be successfully treated with muscarinic receptor antagonists. These agents can lower intravesical pressure, increase capacity, and reduce the frequency of contractions by antagonizing parasympathetic control of the bladder; they also may alter bladder sensation during filling. Solifenacin is relatively selective for muscarinic receptors of the M3 subtype, giving it a orable efficacy. Oxybutynin, Tolterodine are commonly used drugs competitively bind to cholinergic receptors. These medications appear to work at the level of the detrusor muscle by competitively inhibiting acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors (M2 and M3). These agents thereby blunt detrusor contractions to reduce the number of incontinence episodes and volume lost with each. These medications are significantly better than placebo at improving symptoms of urge urinary incontinence and overactive bladder. Duloxetine is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It is approved for the treatment of major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain in adults. It is not used for detrusor instability. Ref: Brown J.

This reduces the bronchoconstriction otherwise caused by the leukotriene, and results in less inflammation.

Again because of its very specific focus of operation, it does not interact with other allergy medications such as theophylline. Another leukotriene receptor antagonist is zafirlukast.

The lesions are initially sharply demarcated, erythematous, and purpuric. They may resolve or progress to large, irregular, hemorrhagic bullae that can eventually lead to necrosis. The mechanism for this reaction is related to warfarin's ability to deplete protein C, which can lead to a state of hypercoagulability and thrombosis in the cutaneous microvasculature. Aspirin is commonly used for its antiplatelet effect; however, it would not be indicated for anticoagulation of a patient with a recent cardiac valve replacement. Fuhermore, aspirin is not associated with the development of this type of skin necrosis. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic commonly used as a perioperative prophylactic agent. If the patient was allergic to this antibiotic, an erythematous rash might have appeared. However, the rash would not lead to the appearance of large, hemorrhagic bullae.

H has been shown to reduce the risk of osteoporosis in women. But long term use of estrogen leads to range of adverse effect including cardiovascular disease, stroke, pulmonary emboli and invasive breast cancer. These serious adverse effect made to look for other options. Selective estrogen receptor modulators These are class of compounds that act on estrogen receptors. Their characteristic feature is that they do not have pure agonist or antagonistic action on estrogen receptors. - Their selective action distinguishes these substances. from pure receptor agonist or antagonist. - SERMS are \"selective\" that means SERMS block estrogen in some tissues and activate estrogen action in others. - All the SERMS bind to the estrogen receptor but each agent produces a unique receptor drug conformation. - As a result specific coactivator or co-oppressor proteins are bound to the receptor resulting in differential effects. Two SERMS are currently being used Raloxifens For the t/t and prevention of osteoporosis Tamoxifen --> For the t/t and prevention of Breast Ca The. first SERM to reach the market was Tamoxifen which blocks the stimulative effect of estrogen on breast tissue and is used in breast cancer. Raloxifene is the second SERM to be approved by the FDA. Raloxifens has been approved for the tit and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Raloxifens acts like estrogen on bone and helps to build and maintain bone density. - Raloxifen has been shown in clinical trials to increase bone density in the spine and hip and to reduce the risk of spinal fractures in women with osteoporosis. While it acts like estrogen on bone, it blocks the action of estrogen on breast and uterus. - This profile makes it very useful for the t/t of osteoporosis because Raloxifene provides the bone benefits of estrogen without increasing the risk for estrogen related breast and uterine cancers. Raloxifene in Breast cancer Due to its antiestrogenic effect on breast, Raloxifene has been shown to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in women who are taking it for osteoporosis. Raloxifene reduces the risk of breast cancer by 50-70% in both low risk and high risk postmenopausal women. The national cancer institute U. S. A. funded the STUDY OF TAMOXIFEN AND RALOXIFEN (STAR) a clinical trial comparing raloxtfens with tamoxifen in preventing breast cancer, in postmenopausal women who are at increased risk of developing the disease. The study found that tamoxifen and Raloxifen are equally effective in reducing invasive breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women who are at increased risk of the disease. The study also. found out that women who took raloxifen had fewer uterine cancer and. fewer blood clots than women who took tamoxifen. However, Raloxifen did not decrease the risk of noninvasive breast Ca. On September 14 2007, the US. food and drug administration announced approval of raloxifens for reducing the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and in postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive cancer.",

D: N significant interaction with warfarin Barbiturates stimulates hepatic microsomal catabolism of warfarin Phenobarbital/ Phenobarbitone It is a barbiturate It is the most widely used anticonvulsant worldwide, and the oldest still commonly used. The World Health Organization recommends its use as first-line for paial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (those formerly known as grand mal) in developing countries. It is still commonly used to treat neonatal seizures. Phenobarbital is indicated in the treatment of all types of seizures except absence seizures. Sedation and hypnosis are the principal side effects (occasionally, they are also the intended effects) of phenobarbital. Central nervous system effects like dizziness, nystagmus and ataxia are also common. In elderly patients, it may cause excitement and confusion while in children, it may result in paradoxical hyperactivity. Another very rare side effect is amelogenesis imperfecta Contraindication: Acute intermittent porphyria, oversensitivity for barbiturates, prior dependence on barbiturates, severe respiratory insufficiency and hyperkinesia in children The principal mechanism of action of barbiturates is believed to be their affinity for the GABAA receptor (Acts on GABA: BDZ receptor Cl- channel complex). GABA is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS). Barbiturates bind to the GABAA receptor at the alpha subunit, which are binding sites distinct from GABA itself. Like benzodiazepines, barbiturates potentiate the effect of GABA at this receptor. In addition to this GABA-ergic effect, barbiturates also block the AMPA receptor, a subtype of glutamate receptor. Phenobarbital has an oral bioavailability of approximately 90%. Peak plasma concentrations are reached 8 to 12 hours after oral administration. It is one of the longest-acting barbiturates available - it remains in the body for a very long time (half-life of 2 to 7 days) and has very low protein binding (20 to 45%). Phenobarbital is metabolized by the liver, mainly through hydroxylation and glucuronidation, and induces many isozymes of the cytochrome P450 system. Cytochrome P450 2. B6 (CYP2. B6) is specifically induced by Phenobarbital It is excreted primarily by the kidneys Phenobarbital markedly reduces effect of warfarin",

Like the other schizontocides, vivax hypnozoites are not affected. Lumefantrine is highly lipophilic; absorption starts after 2 hours of ingestion and peaks at 6-8 hours. Antimalarial action is slower than CQ. Plasma protein binding is 99%, and it is metabolized predominantly by CYP3. A4. Terminal t\u00bd is 2- 3 days, which is prolonged to 4 -6 days in malaria patients. \u200b Lumefantrine is used only in combination with artemether, as FDC tablets. The two components protect each other from plasmodial resistance. \u200b As such, no clinically relevant resistance has developed so far. Clinical efficacy is high achieving 95- 99% cure rate.

The therapeutic index represents the ratio between the median lethal dose (LD50) and the median effective dose ( ED50) of a drug. This calculation of LD50/ DD50 generates an index that is the therapeutic window between the dose that produces the desired effect and the dose that results in toxic effects. Like all indices, the T. I. is dimensionless since the dose units, usually express in \"mg-kg \", cancel each other. The therapeutic index conveniently represents the safety merger of a drug. The greater the therapeutic ratio, or spread, between the ED50 and LD50, the greater the drug safety. Therefore a T. I. of one thousand represents a drug with a far greater safety profile than a drug with a T. I. of two. Ref: Von Zastrow M. (2012). Chapter 2. Drug Receptors & Pharmacodynamics. In B. G. Katzung, S.

However, in many areas resistant S. typhi have appeared and now it is seldom used. Cotrimoxazole in chancroid Corimoxazole for 7 days is a 3rd choice inexpensive alternative to ceftriaxone, erythromycin or iprofloxacin. Cotrimoxazole It is a combination of sulfonamide (sulfamethoxazole) and trime- thoprim in the ratio of 1: 5. Cotrimoxazole was claimed to be more effective than either of its components individually in treating bacterial infections. Because of its associated greater incidence of adverse effects including allergic responses its widespread use has been restricted in many countries to very specific circumstances where its improved efficacy is demonstracted. Uses of Cotrimoxazole Upper and lower respiratory tract infections - Exacerbations of chronic bronchitis - For otitis media and sinusitis. - It should never be used for streptococcal pharyngitis. Urinary tract infections -Uncomplicated cystitis in non pregnant women. Especially valuable for chronic and recurrent cases. - Prostatitis (cotrimoxazole is concentrated in goodamounts in prostate) Pneumocystic carinii pneumonia -Drug of choice next to pentamidine for the treatment and prophylaxis of pneumonias caused by Pneumocystic Jirovecci (commonly seen in imtnunocompromised patients including those suffering from HIV/AIDS). Other conditions where cotrimoxazole finds its use. -Listeria monocytogens infections - Meliodosis - Shigellosis - Traveller's diarrhoeas (E. coli, Campylobacter, Shigella, Y. enterocolitica) - Prophylaxis of cerebral toxoplasmosis - Whipple's disease - Salmonella (typhoid) initially it was responsive but now resistant strains have emerged. - Chancroid According to K.
