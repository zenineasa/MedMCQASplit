Substance P acts on these receptors and is responsible for chemotheraphy induced nausea and vomiting. Aprepitant acts as a substance P antagonist on NK1 receptors. Aprepitant has little or no affinity for Serotonin 5-HT3, dopamine or coicosteroid receptors. Aprepitant crosses the blood brain barrier. Aprepitant is used for chemotherapy induced nausea & vomiting (CINV), and post- operative nausea & vomiting (PONY). After absorption aprepitant is bound extensively to plasma proteins (>95%); it is metabolized avidly, primarily by hepatic CYP 3. A4 and is excreted in the stools. Aprepitant is contraindicated in patients on cisapride or pimozide, in which life threatening QT prolongation has been repoed.

        "exp": "It follows zero order kinetics [Ref KDT 6th/e p. 403-405J There are three pharmacokinetic characteristic of phenytoin: -- Marked binding to serum protein - Nonlinearity of its elimination kinetics (1t. follows saturation kinetics) - Metabolism by the CY P'S Phenytoin follows saturation kinetics:? - At their therapeutic concentrations most of the drugs occupy only a small fraction of their metabolizing sites so their metabolic rate increases as the drug concentration increase. - In such cases the metabolic rate of the drug is a constant fraction of the drug present in the body (rather than a constant amount of drug/h) i. e., the drug has a specific half life. This is. first order kinetics. For example If the concentration of the drug is 500 mg at time zero - After metabolism at 1 hr the drug concentration would be -4250mg - After metabolism at 2hr the drug concentration would be 125 mg However - When most of the enzymes are occupied metabolism occurs at a maximal rate i. e., it is saturated and does not change in propoion to the drug concentration i. e., a fixed amount of drug is metabolized per unit time. This is zero order kinetics. For example - Drug concentration at time zero --> 500 mg - After metabolism at 1 hr --> 450 mg - After metabolism at 2 hr --> 400 mg As the drug concentration increases metabolic sites and their metabolism shifts from first order to zero order. The drug whose kinetic changes from first order to zero at therapeutic concentration are said to follow zero? order kinetics saturation kinetics now small increase in drug dose produces marked side effects. - Phenvtoin is one of the few drug whose elimination varies as a function of its concentration i. e., the rate is nonlinear, as the drug concentration increases the kinetics shift to zero order. Phenytoin is hydroxylated extensively in the liver and this process becomes saturated at about doses needed for therapeutic effects. - Thus phenytoin at low doses exhibit. - First order kinetics - As the therapeutic concentration increases - Zero order kinetic develops. - Now a small increment in dose produces dispropoionate rise in steady state plasma concentration. - Thus dose increments should become smaller as the dose increased. Enzyme induction and inhibition We have seen above that the metabolism of phenytoin is saturable i. e., the enzymes metabolizing it gets saturated. - Because its metabolism is saturable, the other drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes can inhibit the metabolism of phenytoin and increase its concentration. Conversely the degradation rate of other drugs that are substrates for these enzymes can be inhibited by phenytoin. One such drug is warfarin - And addition of phenytoin to a patient receiving warfarin can lead to bleeding disorders. Another mechanism for drug interaction in phenytoin:- It arises from phenytoins ability to induce diverse CYPs. -Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic enzymes that metabolize other drugs. - Coadministration of phenytoin and medication metabolized by these enzymes can lead to an increased degradation of such medication. - Of paicular note in this regard are oral contraceptive. - Treatment with phenytoin could enhance the metabolism of oral contraceptives and lead to unplanned pregnancy. Phenytoin is highly bound to proteins (90%) mainly albumin - Small variations in the percentage of phenytoin that is bound dramatically affect the absolute amount of free (active) drug. Therefore increased propoion of free drug are evident in Patients with hypoalbuminemia, uremic patients and neonates. Terato. Renic effects of phenytoin The total plasma level decreases when the percentage that is bound decreases as in uremia or hypoalbuminemia. Phenytoin is metabolized to Arene oxide compound that is responsible for its teratogenic effect (Fetal hydantion syndrome):- - Hypoplastic phalanges - Cleft palate - Hair lip - Microcephaly",

Intravascular volume is often depleted, and initial fluids to restore volume should include isotonic saline or lactated Ringer's solution.

IV fluids containing 5-10% dextrose (glucose) should be used when the serum glucose levels fall to 200-300 mg/dL, since high doses of rapidly acting insulin can cause life-threatening hypoglycemia. Additionally, the serum potassium concentration should be watched very carefully, since potassium is co transpoed into cells with glucose in the presence of insulin. It is often the case that hyperkalemia is present initially, secondary to decreased cellular uptake of potassium with decreased cellular uptake of glucose. However, this can rapidly change when insulin drives glucose (with potassium) into cells, and a life-threatening hypokalemia can develop.

        "question": "All are true about Exenatide except a. EUR'",
        "exp": "Used in type I diabetes mellitus Exenatide belongs to class of drugs called \"incretins\". Incretins are insulin stimulation hypoglycemic factor found in the duodenum. - Incretin hormones are produced in the gastrointestinal tract in response to nutrient entry. Incretins, in turn, stimulate insulin, secretion. - Glucagon like polypeptide (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) are two examples of incretins. Glucagon like peptide (GLP-1) is a naturally occurring peptide that enhances insulin secretion in response to raised plasma glucose concentrations. It can lower blood glucose level by other methods too. It does so by:? - Increasing the secretion of insulin from the pancreas. - Slows absorption of glucose from the gut. - Reduces the action of glucagon (Glucagon increases glucose production by liver). These actions of GLP-1 lead to lowering of blood sugar levels. Thus, the compound has unique propeies to reduce postprandial glucose level. But these propeies are offset by very impoant adverse effect. - GLP-1 is rapidly (1-2 minutes) deactivated by the dipeptidyl peptidase IV DPP (IV) enzyme. Thus GLP-1 must be infused continuously to have therapeutic benefits. Consequently, considerable work has been performed to produce GLP- 1 receptor agonist that maintain the physiological effects of native incretin but are resistant to the action of DPP IV. Exenatide is a synthetic GLP-1 receptor agonist that is resistant to DPP-IV and has full agonistic activity for GLP-1 receptors. Exenatide is approved only for use as an adjunctive therapy to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are taking metformin, sulfonylurea or a combination of both hut have not achieved adequate glycemic control. -This drug is effective in lowering glycosylated hemoglobin concentration and promotes weight loss in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Exenatide is injected \"subcutaneously\" within 60 minutes before meal. - When exenatide is added to preexisting sulfottylurea therapy the oral hypoglycemic dosage should be reduced to prevent hypoglycemia.",

Naloxone is an opioid antagonist and it promptly reverses the respiratory depressant propey of opioids. - Other agnostic effects of opioids such as effects. on CNS and blood pressure is also reversed by opioids. - Naloxane is commonly used to reverse respiratory depression produced by opioid. The antagonism of opioid effects by naloxone is often accompanied by \"overshoot\" phenomenon i. e., while reversing the effect produced by the opioids it tends to overcorrect it. - The respiratory rate depressed by opioids transiently become higher than that before the period of depression. - Rebound release of catecholamine may cause \"hypertension\", \"tachycardia\" and \"ventricular arrhythmias\". - \"Pulmonary edema\" has also been repoed after naloxone administration. Naloxone may precipitate seizures but they are seen only in patients who are addicted to or dependent on opioids. - Small subcutaneous doses of naloxone precipitates a moderate to severe withdraw! syndrome that is very similar to that seen after abrupt withdrawl of opioids excepts that the syndrome appears within minutes of administration and subsides in about 2 hours. - However, seizure cannot be considered an adverse effect of naloxone. Seizure occur as a pa of withdrawl syndrome when naloxone is administered to those who are addicted or dependent on opioids. When naloxone is administered in nonnal individuals to treat opioid overdose, it does not precipitate withdrawl syndrome and seizures do not occur. - On the other hand the cardiac effects i. e., arrhythmia, hyper- tension and pulmonary edema are produced when naloxone is administered in normal individual to reverse the effect of opioids. - These effects do not require the prior administration of opioids.",

Factors that affect the duration of the post antibiotic effect include duration of antibiotic exposure, bacterial species, culture medium and class of antibiotic. It has been suggested that an alteration of DNA function is possibly responsible for post antibiotic effect following the observation that most inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis (listed below), induce long-term PAE against susceptible bacteria. Aminoglycosides, Fluoroquinolones, Tetracyclines, Clindamycin, Rifampicin and rifabutin Theoretically, the ability of an antibiotic to induce a PAE is an attractive propey of an antibiotic since antibiotic concentrations could fall below the MIC for the bacterium yet retain their effectiveness in their ability to suppress the growth",

        "question": "All of the following are true regarding diuretics except: March 2008",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Thiazides act by inhibiting Sodium-potassium-chloride cotranspo High Efficacy diuretics: - High ceiling diuretics/Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, inhibit the body's ability to reabsorb sodium (by inhibiting sodium-potassium-chloride cotranspo) at the ascending loop in the kidney which leads to a retention of water in the urine as water normally follows sodium back into the extracellular fluid (ECF). Other examples of high ceiling loop diuretics include ethacrynic acid, torasemide and bumetanide. Medium efficacy diuretics: - Thiazide-type diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, Clopamide, act on the distal convoluted tubule and inhibit the sodium-chloride sympoer leading to retention of water in the urine, as water normally follows penetrating solutes. The sho-term anti-hypeensive action is based on the fact that thiazides decrease preload, decreasing blood pressure. On the other hand the long-term effect is due to an unknown vasodilator effect that decreases blood pressure by decreasing resistance. - Thiazide like diuretics includes chlohalidone, metolazone, xipamide, indapamide Weak/adjunctive drugs: - Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors inhibit the enzyme carbonic anhydrase which is found in the proximal convoluted tubule. This results in several effects including bicarbonate retention in the urine, potassium retention in urine and decreased sodium absorption. Drugs in this class include acetazolamide and methazolamide. - Potassium-sparing diuretics do not promote the secretion of potassium into the urine; thus, potassium is spared and not lost as much as in other diuretics. The term \"potassium-sparing\" refers to an effect rather than a mechanism or location; nonetheless, the term almost always refers to two specific classes that have their effect at similar locations: Aldosterone antagonists: spironolactone, which is a competitive antagonist of aldosterone. Aldosterone normally adds sodium channels in the principal cells of the collecting duct and late distal tubule of the nephron. Spironolactone prevents aldosterone from entering the principal cells, preventing sodium reabsorption. A similar agent is potassium canreonate. Epithelial sodium channel blockers: amiloride and triamterene. Osmotic diuretics as mannitol are filtered in the glomerulus, but cannot be reabsorbed. Their presence leads to an increase in the osmolarity of the filtrate. To maintain osmotic balance, water is retained in the urine.",

These drugs reduce proteinuria in diabetic as well as non-diabetic renal disease and also prevent the manifestations of scleroderma crisis which are mediated by angiotensin II. Most frequent adverse effect associated with these agents is dry cough. It can be reduced by iron supplements and asprin. ACEI can also cause angioedema. Both cough and angioedema is due to elevated levels of bradykinin. These can cause hyperkalemia if used along with other agents causing elevation of serum potassium (like potassium sparing diuretics). Other adverse effects include rashes, dysguesia (altered taste sensation), and acute renal failure (if used in bilateral renal artery stenosis). It is important to distinguish between acute renal failure and a normal predictable rise in serum creatinine secondary to ACE inhibitor therapy. An increase in serum creatinine upto 30% within 2-5 days can be expected in most patients started on ACE inhibitors. It stabilizes in 2-3 weeks and is reversible on stopping drug therapy. These drugs are contra-indicated in pregnancy (teratogenic in second half of pregnancy) and when serum creatinine is more than 3. 5 mg/dl. All patients with diabetic nephropathy, whether hypertensive or normotensive, deserve ACE inhibitor therapy. Deterioration of retinopathy in diabetics also appears to be retarded by ACE inhibitors.

Binding of RANK-ligand to these receptors causes differentiation and activation of osteoclast progenitors to mature osteoclasts. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that prevents the binding of RANK-ligand with RANK. This prevents activation of osteoclasts and it can, therefore, be used in osteoporosis. Osteoblasts synthesize and release osteoprotegerin (OPG), identical with RANK, which functions as a decoy receptor. OPG thus inhibits the binding to RANK-L to RANK. Hence OPG analogs can be the potential therapeutic agents of osteoporosis.",

Laboratory examination reveals a blood urea of 77 mg/dL and a serum creatinine of 3. 1 mg/dL. Urinalysis shows mild proteinuria and eosinophils, but is negative for glucose and ketones. The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes, and osteoahritis. Which of the following medications most likely caused the appearance of her signs and symptoms?",
        "exp": "Acute interstitial nephritis is due to a hypersensitivity reaction usually caused by a drug. Drugs implicated in the pathogenesis of acute interstitial nephritis include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and indomethacin; beta-lactam antibiotics, such as cephalothin and methicillin; sulfonamides; diuretics, such as furosemide and thiazides; and drugs like phenytoin, cimetidine, and methyldopa. The typical presentation for acute interstitial nephritis is the development of acute renal failure, fever, a maculopapular rash, and eosinophilia. The patient's periorbital edema and wheezing are also consistent with acute interstitial nephritis. Ibuprofen is the most likely causative agent for the development of the patient's signs and symptoms. Although the exact mechanism by which NSAIDs cause this disorder is not fully understood, it is believed to be related to their ability to decrease prostaglandin formation, which leads to a reduction in renal blood flow. None of the other medications are associated with the development of acute interstitial nephritis. Acarbose is an antidiabetic agent that delays the absorption of glucose from the intestinal tract. Clonidine is a centrally-acting antihypeensive agent used in the treatment of hypertension and prophylaxis of migraines. It has been shown to be efficacious in ameliorating symptoms of alcohol, tobacco, opiate, and benzodiazepine withdrawal. It is also used in the treatment of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity. Metformin is an antidiabetic agent that increases the binding of insulin to its receptor.

The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, which covers 23 strains, is only administered in ceain groups (e. g. those who have had a splenectomy); it does not elicit a significant immune response in all recipients, e. g. small children.

        "question": "Drug used in anaphylaxis: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Epinephrine Adrenaline 1: 1000 solution intramuscularly produces a dramatic reversal of the hypotension, bronchospasm and laryngeal edema and is life saving. Anaphylaxis It is defined as \"a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death\". It can result in a number of symptoms including throat swelling, an itchy rash, and low blood pressure. On a pathophysiologic level it is an acute multi-system type I hypersensitivity reaction. \"True\" anaphylaxis is caused by degranulation of mast cells or basophils mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE), and pseudo-anaphylaxis occurs without IgE mediation The most common areas affected include: skin (80% to 90%), respiratory (70%), gastrointestinal (30% to 45%), hea and vasculature (10% to 45%), and central nervous system (10% to 15%) Skin involvement may include generalized hives, itchiness, flushing, and swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat. Respiratory symptoms may include shoness of breath, wheezes or stridor, and low oxygen. Gastrointestinal symptoms may include crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Anaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen. Common triggers include insect bites or stings, foods, medication, and latex rubber. Foods are the most common trigger in children and young adults while medications and insect bites and stings are more common in older adults. Biphasic anaphylaxis is the recurrence of symptoms within 1-72 hours with no fuher exposure to the allergen. Anaphylactic shock is anaphylaxis associated with systemic vasodilation that results in low blood pressure. It is also associated with severe bronchoconstriction to the point where the individual is unable to breathe. Pseudoanaphylaxis has a similar presentation and treatment to that of anaphylaxis, however, it does not involve an allergic reaction but is due to direct mast cell degranulation. This can result from morphine, radiocontrast, aspirin and muscle relaxants. Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis with no absolute contraindication to its use. It is recommended that it be given intramuscularly into the mid anterolaterial thigh as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. Minor adverse effects from epinephrine include tremors, anxiety, headaches, and palpitations.",

Alternatively, dexamethasone, 0. 1 mg/kg every 8 hours, may be used without disruption of diagnostic testing. Once diagnostic testing has been done, hydrocoisone is the drug of choice because it has both glucocoicoid and mineralocoicoid functions. Once patients are stable, the dose may be tapered gradually over 1-2 weeks. Patients receiving less than 50 mg/d of hydrocoisone will likely need mineralocoicoid suppo as well. Fludrocoisone, 0. 05-0. 2 mg/d, is the drug of choice. Ref: Huecker M. R., Danzl D. F. (2011). Chapter 43. Metabolic & Endocrine Emergencies. In R. L. Humphries, C.

The primary mechanism of acquired resistance is the production of penicillinase. Some resistant bacteria become penicillin tolerant and not penicillin destroying. Their target enzymes are altered to have low affinity for penicillin, e. g. highly resistant pneumococci isolated in some areas have altered PBPs. The methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA) has acquired a PBP which has a very low affinity for Beta-lactam antibiotics. Some penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci have altered PBPs. The low-level penicillin-resistant gonococci are less permeable to the drug, while high degree resistant ones produce penicillinase, as do highly resistant H. influenzae.

        "exp": "The laboratory results indicate that the aerial pH, aerial PCO2, and plasma HCO3- concentrations are all low. These changes clearly demonstrate metabolic acidosis, which occurs commonly when a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is administered. The carbonic anhydrase enzyme attached to the brush border of the tubular epithelial cells normally catalyzes the dissociation of carbonic acid into water and carbon dioxide. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase prevents the removal of bicarbonate ions from the tubular fluid, which initially increases urine pH. The result is heavy spillage of bicarbonate in the urine, which is the hallmark of type 2 A (renal tubular acidosis). However, once the plasma levels of bicarbonate have decreased sufficiently, the bicarbonaturia ceases and the plasma HCO3- levels stabilize at a lower than normal level. Consequently, the urine pH falls typically to 4. 5-5. 0. Ref: Reilly R. F., Jackson E. K. (2011). Chapter 25. Regulation of Renal Function and Vascular Volume. In L. L. Brunton, B. A. Chabner, B. C.

Ifosfamide is a cyclophosphamide analogue thus it has all the potential adverse effects of cyclophosphamide. Ifosfamide metabolite, rather than the parent drug is responsible for toxicity of Ifosfamide. Ifosfamide is a prodrug that requires metabolic activation by microsomal liver enzymes to produce biologically active compounds. Activation is mediated by cytochrome p450 - CYP3. A4 and deactivated by CYP3A-4 AND CYP2. B6. The metabolic activation of Ifosfamide is an autoinducible process and besides producing active cytotoxic metabolites it also results in generation of some toxic metabolic byproducts that are responsible for its side effects. The two well known toxic nzetabolities of Ifosfamide are acrolein and chloracetaldehyde. - \"Acrolein is responsible for Ifosfamide induced hemorrhagic cystitis where as chloroacetaldehyde is responsible for renal tubular damage and neutrotoxicity\". Acrolein - Hemorrhagic cystitis Chloroacetaldehyde - Nephrotoxicity (Renal tubular danage) - Neurotoxicity At equivalent doses, the rate of chloroacetaldehyde generation with ifosfamide is 40 times greater than with cyclophosphamide. -This explains why cyclophosphamide although structurally related has viually no nephrotoxicity and less neurotoxic. Goodman Gilman Says - At equivalent doses, the rate of chloroacetaldehyde generation with ifosfamide is 40 times greater than with cyclophosphamide therefore it produces more platelet suppression, neurotoxicity, urothelial damage. Neurotoxicity in ifosfamide Neurotoxity in ifosfamide is caused by the active metabolite of ifosfamide i. e., chloralacetaldehyde These metabolites enter brain and produce neurological symptoms which are encephalopathy and seizure. These symptoms almost always resolve with discontinuation of the drug. Patients who have mild to moderate symptoms can continue to receive the drug.",

High doses of salicylates have synergistic hypoprothrombinemic action and also displace warfarin from protein binding site. Long acting sulfonamides, indomethacin, phenytoin and probenecid: displace warfarin from plasma protein binding. Chloramphenicol, erythromycin, celecoxib, cimetidine, allopurinol, amiodarone and metronidazole: inhibit warfarin metabolism. Tolbutamide and phenytoin: Inhibit warfarin metabolism and vice versa.

Carbamazepine, rifampin and griseofulvin induce the metabolism of warfarin.

Tacrolimus acts as imnmunosuppressant by acting against calcineurin. The other calcineurin inhibitor is cyclosporine. Calcineurin inhibitors Calcineurin inhibitors are perhaps the most effective immuno-suppressive drugs in routine use. Role of calcineurin Calcineurin acts as a intracellular signal transductor. Once the T cell receptors are activated, signals are sent to the nucleus through the calcineurin, for the transcription of cytokine genes. This leads to production of IL-2 along with other interleukins. Interleukin-2 and other cytokines leads to the proliferation of cellular and humoral immunity. Calcineurin inhibitors, inhibitins the calcineurin. Mechanism of action of cyclosporin Cyclosporin enters the target cells and binds to a cytoplasmic protein called cyclophilin --> the complex then binds to and inactivates calcineurin -- decreased production of IL-2 --)decreased immune response. Tacrolimus The mechanism of action is almost similar to cyclosporine. The slight difference is that it binds to different cycoplasnzic protein which is FKBP, but the subsequent steps are same i. e. inhibition of calcineurin --4 decreased production of IL-2 -1 decreased immune response. More on Tacrolimus It is 10 times more potent than cyclosporine. Because of more potent action it is also suitable for suppressing acute rejection that has set in. It is paiculary valuable in liver transplantation because its absorption is not dependent on bile. It has the same toxicity profile as cyclosporine.",

C: Ethambutol Approximately 50% of the oral dose of Ethambutol is eliminated unchanged in the urine within 24 hours; 15% of the drug is excreted in the form of 2 metabolites Its serious toxicity is ocular Ethambutol/ EMB/ E It is a bacteriostatic antimycobacterial drug Adverse effects of ethambutol are: - Optic neuritis: Hence contraindicated in children below 6 yrs of age. - Red-green color blindness - Peripheral neuropathy - Ahralgia - Hyperuricaemia - Veical nystagmus - Milk skin reaction Ethambutol is bacteriostatic against actively growing TB bacilli. It works by obstructing the formation of cell wall. Mycolic acids attach to the 5'-hydroxyl groups of D-arabinose residues of arabinogalactan and form mycolylarabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex in the cell wall. It disrupts arabinogalactan synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme arabinosyl transferase. Disruption of the arabinogalactan synthesis inhibits the formation of this complex and leads to increased permeability of the cell wall It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and well distributed in body tissues and fluids, 50% is excreted unchanged in urine.",

This results in prolongation of the QRS complex and the PR/QT intervals with a predisposition to cardiac arrhythmias.

        "question": "Which one of the following is most likely to result in contraction alkalosis?",
        "exp": "The term \"contraction alkalosis\" refers to the development of metabolic alkalosis (excess plasma HCO3-) when there is a loss of extracellular fluid volume (hypovolemia). Hypovolemia evokes numerous homeostatic reflexes that act to normalize extracellular fluid volume, including stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In the kidney, elevated levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone increase Na reabsorption through processes that are ultimately coupled to hydrogen secretion. Consequently, volume regulation results in a net increase in plasma HCO3-. Correction is obtained when the lost volume is replenished through intake of water and sodium. Loop diuretics such as furosemide act primarily on the thick segment of the medullary and coical ascending limbs of Henle's loop. They inhibit the coupled transpo of Na+ and Cl- that results in the production of large volumes of relatively iso osmotic urine. Excessive use of these drugs can result in hypovolemia and contraction alkalosis. Antacid and infant formula can result in metabolic alkalosis but not as a result of hypovolemia. In patients with renal insufficiency, antacids containing calcium carbonate can increase the plasma HCO3- concentration. Infant formulas that contain sodium but very little chloride enhance Na+ reabsorption in the renal tubule and, like volume contraction, this results in an increase in urinary H+ secretion. Administration of laxatives or acetazolamide promotes metabolic acidosis. Laxatives result in the loss of intestinal fluids that are relatively alkaline and contain large amounts of HCO3-. Acetazolamide inhibits the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. As a result, acetazolamide reduces the reabsorption of HCO3- in the renal tubule. Acetazolamide is often used in combination with loop diuretics to correct the alkalosis caused by these compounds. Ref: Barrett K. E., Barman S. M., Boitano S., Brooks H. L. (2012). Chapter 35.

Fever Muscular rigidity Altered mental status Autonomic dysfunction The underlying pathological abnormality is thought to be central D2 receptor blockade or dopamine depletion in the hypothalamus and nigrostriatal / spinal pathways. This leads to an elevated temperature set point, impairment of normal thermal homeostasis and extrapyramidally induced muscle regidity. Thus it is usually associated with potent neuroleptics such as haloperidol and fluphenazine, which block central D2 receptors but it has now been repoed to occur with all drugs that affect the central dopaminergic system (including dopamine agonists and levodopa). In these cases neurolept malignant syndrome is precipitated by rapid withdrawl of the dopaminergic agonists. Amantadine Amantadine is a dopamine agonist and its withdrawl precipitates neurolept malignant syndrome. N. M. S. is also associated with other drugs that have central D2 receptor antagonist activity e. g. Metoclopromide. Metoclopromide is a D2 blocker. Can cross the C. N. S. and cause neurolept malignant syndrome. Domperidone Like metoclopromide is a D2 blocker and is similar to metoclopromide in all respects, except that, Domeperidone does not cross C. N. S. and so it does not generally cause neurolept malignant syndrome. But rare cases of N. M. S. of have been repoed with Domeperidone, too.

Cyclooxygenase is required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme. This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen), which are reversible inhibitors. Very low-dose, long-term aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. This anticoagulant propey makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of hea attacks. 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large propoion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin 12 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain fuher inhibition The main undesirable side effects of aspirin are gastrointestinal ulcers, stomach bleeding, and tinnitus, especially in higher doses. In children and adolescents, aspirin is no longer used to control flu-like symptoms or the symptoms of chickenpox or other viral illnesses, because of the risk of Reye's syndrome.

Antihistamine and andidepressant Antihistamine and antidepressants have significant sedative effect. But - They can also be used as sedatives. According to Katzung 11th/e p. 521 After major depression, anxiety disorders represent the most common application of antidepressants. A number of SSRIs and SNRIs have been approved for all the major anxiety disorders. About Antihistaminic agent Katzung says p (271) and 409. A common effect of first generation HI antagonist is sedation. The effect is sufficiently prominent with some agents to make them useful as sleep aids. Diphenhydramine and doxylamine are antihistamines will well documented CNS depressants effects ans are used as sleeping aids (should not be used. for more than two weeks). But KDT has opposite views on this (6th/e p 389) Some antihistamines (promethazine, diphenyl hydramine) some anticholinergic (hyoscine) and opioids (morphine, pethidine) have significant sedative action but are not reliable for treatment of insomnia. Phenytoin appears to be a safer option because at higher dses it causes sedation and is never used as sedative. It seems to be the more correct option.

Staph. aureus, though originally very sensitive, has acquired resistance to such an extent that it must be counted out of PnG spectrum. Gram negative cocci-Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis are susceptible to PnG, though increasing number of gonococci have developed partial and other high degree resistance. Bacilli: Gram-positive bacilli - majority of B. anthracis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and practically all Clostridia (tetani and others), listeria are highly sensitive, so are spirochetes (Treponema pallidum, Leptospira, and others), but Bacteroides fragilis is largely resistant. Actinomyces israelii is only moderately sensitive. Majority of aerobic gram-negative bacilli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rickettsiae, chlamydiae, protozoa, fungi and viruses are totally insensitive to PnG. Gonorrhea: PnG has become unreliable for the treatment of gonorrhoea. Syphilis: T. pallidum has not shown any resistance and PnG is the drug of choice. Early and latent syphilis is treated either with daily i. m. injection of 1. 2 MU of procaine penicillin for 10 days or with 1-3 weekly doses of 2. 4 MU benzathine penicillin. For late syphilis, benzathine penicillin 2. 4 MU weekly for 4 weeks is recommended. Cardiovascular and neurosyphilis requires sod. PnG 5 MU i. m 6 hourly for 10-14 days followed by the above regimen.

Prior to surgical of tumor, patients are treated with phenoxybenzamine, an alpha blocker to preclude the hypeensive crisis that can result from manipulation of the tissues. Beta blockers or other antihypeensives should not used without first blocking the alpha adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction. The goal of pre operative management is relaxation of constricted vasculature, expansion of reduced plasma volume and normalization of blood pressure. Beta blockers can be added to it if tachycardia persists, and CCBs and ACEIs can be added if BP is not controlled with phenoxybenzamine alone. Elevated levels of plasma and urinary catecholamines and the methylated metabolites, metanephrines, are the cornerstone for the diagnosis. T2-weighted MRI with gadolinium contrast is optimal for detecting pheochromocytomas and is somewhat better than CT for imaging extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.
