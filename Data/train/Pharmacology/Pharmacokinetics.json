Pharmacologically Brinzolamide is a highly specific noncompetitive reversible and effective inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II) which is able to suppress formation of aqueous humour in the eye. Carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the reversible reaction of water and carbon di-oxide to form negatively charged bicarbonate ions. In human tissues there are 7 different isoenzymatic forms of carbonic anhydrase, pancreas, eyes, central nervous system and lungs. In the eye the enzyme is expressed mainly in the ciliary processes of the ciliary body. The main ocular effect of Brinzolamide. Brinzolamide suppresses the formation of aqueous humour in the ciliary body and thus decrease intraocular pressure. In the ciliary epithelium the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase slows the formation of bicarbonate ions and their secretion into the posterior chamber of the eye. This reduces the sodium transport into the posterior chamber and decrease aqueous humour production resulting in lower intraocular pressure. Brinzolamide is used in ocular hypertension and primary oven angle glaucoma. Intraocular pressure reduction is fundamental in primary open angle glaucoma or in ocular hypertension to delay the onset or prevent the onset of primary open angle glaucoma in ocular hypertension or the progression of damage in primary open angle glaucoma.",

Nitroglycerine is effective as sublingual medication because it is non-ionic and highly lipid soluble. \"Sublingual Administration. Absorption from the oral mucosa has special significance for certain drags despite the fact that the surface area available is small. Venous drainage from the mouth is to the superior vena cava, bypassing the portal circulation and thereby protecting the drug from rapid intestinal and hepatic first-pass metabolism. For example, nitroglycerin is effective when retained sublingually because it is non-ionic and has very high lipid solubility. Thus, the drug is absorbed very rapidly. Nitroglycerin also is very potent: absorption of a relatively small amount produces the therapeutic effect. \"--Goodman Gillman 12/e p22. Systemic Routes of Drug Administration1.
