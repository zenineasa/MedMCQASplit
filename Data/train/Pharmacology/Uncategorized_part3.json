Increased level of lysosomal enzyme 2 glutamyl hydrolase that hydrolyse methotrexate polyglutamates Decreased transpo A common mechanism of methotrexate resistance is reduced. folale transpo carrier The decreased transpo is common mechanism to methotrexate resistance in relapsed ALL. Impaired Polyglutammation The polyglutammated. forms of methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase. The intracellular content of polyglutammate derivatives of methotrexate is controlled by a balance between folypolyglutamate synthetase and glutamyl hydrolase activity. Folypolyglutamate synthetase produces polyglutammate while A glutamyl hydrolase conves its bact to monoglutamate form A lower content of methotrexate polyglutamate could he due to decreased synthesis or an increased catabolism of methotrexate polyglutamates by A glutamate hydrolase. Increased DHFR The main mechanism of action of methotrexate is inhibition of the enzyme DHFR. - Methotrexate is a tight binding inhibitor of DHFR and the concentration of methotrexate required to achieve enzyme activity increases in direct propoion to the amount of enzyme in target cells. - If is now well established that an impoant mechanism of resistance of cells to methotrexate is an increase in DHFR production due to amphification of the DHFR gene Mutation in DHFR Mutation is DHFR genes may be responsible. for methotrexate resistance.

C: Antipsychotics Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) refers to the combination of hypehermia, rigidity, and autonomic dysregulation that can occur as a serious complication of the use of antipsychotic drugs. The list of atypical antipsychotic drugs that may cause NMS include olanzapine, risperidone, paliperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, amisulpride, and quetiapine. Clozapine may also be associated with the development of NMS, but it appears to be less likely to manifest with extrapyramidal features, including rigidity and tremor. The most widely accepted mechanism by which antipsychotics cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome is that of dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Central D2 receptor blockade in the hypothalamus, nigrostriatal pathways, and spinal cord leads to increased muscle rigidity and tremor extrapyramidal pathways. Hypothalamic D2 receptor blockade results in an elevated temperature set point and impairment of heat-dissipating mechanisms. Peripherally, antipsychotics lead to increased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in increased contractility, which can contribute to hypehermia, rigidity, and muscle cell breakdown.",

        "question": "To treat Methotrexate toxicity,......... is used: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Folinic Acid Folinic acid's only use is in the treatment of toxicity due to folic acid antagonists like methotrexate. Folinic acid/Leucovorin It generally administered as calcium or sodium folinate (or leucovorin calcium/sodium) It is an adjuvant used in cancer chemotherapy involving the drug methotrexate. It is also used in synergistic combination with the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil. Folinic acid should be distinguished from folic acid. Folinic acid is a 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid. It is readily conveed to other reduced folic acid derivatives (e. g., tetrahydrofolate), and, thus, has vitamin activity that is equivalent to that of folic acid. However, since it does not require the action of dihydrofolate reductase for its conversion, its function as a vitamin is unaffected by inhibition of this enzyme by drugs such as methotrexate. Folinic acid, therefore, allows for some purine/pyrimidine synthesis to occur in the presence of dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, so that some normal DNA replication and RNA transcription processes can proceed. Methotrexate It competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that paicipates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about one thousand-fold that of folate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Folic acid is needed for the de novo synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is needed for purine base synthesis, so all purine synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins. Methotrexate acts specifically during DNA and RNA synthesis, and thus it is cytotoxic during the S-phase of the cell cycle. Logically, it therefore has a greater toxic effect on rapidly dividing cells (such as malignant and myeloid cells, and gastrointestinal and oral mucosa), which replicate their DNA more frequently, and thus inhibits the growth and proliferation of these noncancerous cells, as well as causing the side effects. Methotrexate is a weak dicarboxylic acid with p. Ka 4. 8 and 5. 5, and thus it is mostly ionized at physiologic pH. Oral absorption is saturatable and thus dose-dependent Mean oral bioavailability is 33% (13-76% range), and there is no clear benefit to subdividing an oral dose. Mean intramuscular bioavailability is 76%. Methotrexate is metabolized by intestinal bacteria to the inactive metabolite 4-amino-4-deoxy-N-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA), which accounts for less than 5% loss of the oral dose. Factors that decrease absorption include food, oral nonabsorbable antibiotics (e. g. vancomycin, neomycin, and bacitracin) and more rapid transit through the gastrointestinal tract (GI) tract, such as diarrhea, while slower transit time in the GI tract from constipation will increase absorption. The most common adverse effects include: ulcerative stomatitis, low white blood cell count and thus predisposition to infection, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, dizziness and rarely pulmonary fibrosis. Methotrexate is a highly teratogenic drug",

Intravascular volume is often depleted, and initial fluids to restore volume should include isotonic saline or lactated Ringer's solution.

IV fluids containing 5-10% dextrose (glucose) should be used when the serum glucose levels fall to 200-300 mg/dL, since high doses of rapidly acting insulin can cause life-threatening hypoglycemia. Additionally, the serum potassium concentration should be watched very carefully, since potassium is co transpoed into cells with glucose in the presence of insulin. It is often the case that hyperkalemia is present initially, secondary to decreased cellular uptake of potassium with decreased cellular uptake of glucose. However, this can rapidly change when insulin drives glucose (with potassium) into cells, and a life-threatening hypokalemia can develop.

Some very impoant facts about second generation antihistaminics: Terfenadine Fastest acting antihistaminic Associated with Torsades De Pointes (Polymorph ventricular tachycardia) when given with drugs that inhibit CYP3. A4 - erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole. This toxicity is based on blockade of delayed rectifier K+ channels in the heart. Due to this toxicity, terfenadine has been withdrawn. Astemizole Slowest acting Like terfenadine it can cause ventricular arrhythmia. o It has also been banned for the same reason. Fexofenadine Active metabolite of terfenadine (also available as a separate drug). It has low propensity to block delayed rectifier K+ channels in the heart. It is largely free of arrhythmogenic potential, but some cases of ventricular arrhythmia in patients with prexisting long QT interval have been repoed. Thus, it is not entirely safe in patients with long QT, bradycardia or hypokalemia. Cetrizine Active metabolite of first generation antihistaminic drug, hydroxyzine (also available as a separate drug). In addition to H1 receptor blocking activity it inhibits release of histamine and cytotoxic mediators from platelets as well as eosinophil chemotoxis. Levocetrizine (1-isomer of cetrizine) is more potent and less sedative. Azelastine Has maximum topical activity and can be given by nasal spray for allergic rhinitis.

        "question": "A 15-year-old boy is subjected to recurrent attacks of asthma. A careful clinical history reveals that the asthma attacks occur most frequently after aspirin administration. Which of the following is the pathogenetic mechanism in this form of asthma?",
        "exp": "Aspirin-induced asthma is an infrequent form of asthma. It is related to the direct pharmacologic action of aspirin on the metabolism of arachidonic acid. Aspirin inhibits the cyclooxygenase pathway without affecting the lipoxygenase pathway, leading to a decreased ratio of prostaglandins (bronchodilators) to leukotrienes (bronchoconstrictors). The disrupted balance between these two groups of arachidonic acid metabolites leads to bronchoconstriction in predisposed patients. Direct release of bronchoconstrictor substances is one of several pathogenetic mechanisms that may mediate occupational asthma, triggered by inhalation of a number of chemicals, including epoxy resins, plastics, cotton fibers, toluene, formaldehyde, and penicillin products. Enhanced vagal stimulation plays an essential role in non-atopic asthma. This variety of asthma, AKA non reaginic asthma, is initiated by viral infections of the upper respiratory tract (e. g., common cold and flu), which appear to lower the threshold of respiratory mucosa to parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. Recall that vagal stimulation exes a bronchoconstrictor influence on the lungs. Type I hypersensitivity reactions are crucial in the pathogenesis of atopic asthma following prior exposure to a number of allergens. T-cell activation instructs B cells to produce IgE directed against a given allergen. On re-exposure, IgE on the surface of mast cells binds the allergen and induces mast cell degranulation. The mediators released from mast cells cause bronchospasm and recruit more inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, lymphocytes, and basophils. Ref: Barnes P. J. (2012). Chapter 254. Asthma. In D.

This allows absorption of the medication to provide availability to the proton pumps when they are activated by the meal. This drug when taken before meals provide the best intragastric pH control.

They react covalently with SH group of the H+ K+ ATPase enzyme and inactivate it irreversibly. Acid secretion resumes when new H+ K+ ATPase molecules are synthesized.

Calcineurin is crucial for normal lymphokine gene activation, and its inhibition by cyclosporine consequently interferes with the production of interleukins-2, -3, and -4 (IL-2, IL-3, and IL-4), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), and other impoant mediators of inflammation. In turn, specific and potent inhibition of T-cell activation (especially CD4 cells) is achieved. Adverse effects: The most frequently encountered problem with cyclosporine is nephrotoxicity, and in many patients cyclosporine causes a rise in serum creatinine level and a reduction of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

Therefore, it does not have antiemetic action or cause extrapyramidal effects (extreme CNS stimulation). Mosapride is a new congener of cisapride with similar gastrokinetic and LES tonic action due to 5-HT4 agonistic (major) and 5-HT3 antagonistic (minor) action in the myenteric plexus, but has not caused Q-Tc prolongation or arrhythmias. Like cisapride, it has no clinically useful antiemetic action and does not produce extrapyramidal/hyperprolactinemic side effects due to absence of D2 blocking propey.

        "exp": "b blockers Mel Harrison 16th/e p 273) Among the anti hypeensive agents thiazide diuretics and fl lockers are implicated most commonly for impotence. Erection requires increased blood flow into the erectile tissues of the penis i. e. corpora cavernosa and corpora spongiosa. The erectile tissue are large cavernous sinusoids which are normally relatively empty of blood but becomes dilated tremendously when aerial blood flows rapidly into them under pressure while the venous outflow is paially occluded. Erection is caused by parasympathetic impulses that pass from sacral poion of spinal cord. These parasympathetic nerve fibres in contrast to most other parasympathetic fibres are believed to secrete nitric oxide and/or vasoactive intestinal peptide in addition to acetylcholine. The nitric oxide especially relaxes the aeries of the penis as well as relaxes the trabecular meshwork of smooth muscle fibres in the erectile tissue of the corpora cavernosa and corpora spongiosum. 13 blockers inhibit this vasodilation and cause erectile dysfunction. Medicated induced erectile dysfunction is estimated to occur in 25% of men. Among the antihypeensive agents the thiazide diuretics and fiblockers have been implicated most frequently. Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin conveing enzyme inhibitors are less frequently cited. Drugs associated with erectile dysfunction: Diuretics Tranquilizers Thiazide * Butyrophenones Spironolactone * Phenothiazines Antihypeensives H2 antagonists Calcium channel blockers * Ranitidine Methyldopa * Cimetidine Clonidine Hormones Reserpine * Progesterone 13 blockers * Estrogens Guanethidine * Coicosterolds Cardiac/antihyperlipidemics * Gn. RH agonists Digoxin * 5a reductase inhibitors Gemifibrozil * Cyprote rune acetate Clofibrate Cytotoxic agents Antidepressants * Cvclophosphamide Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors * Methotrexate Tricyclic antidepressants * Roferon-A Lithium Recreational M.

Patients with pyridoxine deficiency may experience neurologic symptoms, such as convulsions and fasciculations. The treatment of this disorder is slow IV administration of 2-5 g of pyridoxine. Niacin deficiency, also known as pellagra, is a disease that involves several organs, including the skin, the gastrointestinal system, and the nervous system. A useful mnemonic for remembering the symptoms of pellagra is the \"4 D's\": dermatitis, dementia, diarrhea, and death. These symptoms are not consistent with the patient history described in the question. Riboflavin deficiency is not typically seen alone, but rather in conjunction with other vitamin deficiencies. Dermatitis and glossitis are the most frequent clinical manifestations. Thiamine deficiency, or beri-beri, presents with dry skin and paralysis, rather than convulsions. Severe thiamine deficiency produces Wernicke's encephalopathy, with disorientation, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. This deficiency is typically seen in alcoholic patients. Ref: Amato A. A., Barohn R.

The presence of inherent drug resistance is thought to be associated with genomic instability that gave rise io the cancer. (ii) Acquired resistance In these cases the cancers were initially drug sensitive and became drug resistant, later on in the course of therapy. It can be:- Single drug resistance Cancer is resistant to a single drug and is based on change in genetic apparatus of a given tumour cell. Multi drug resistance Resistance develops to a variety of anticancer drugs. It is associated with increased expression of a normal gene --)MDR1 gene. MDRI gene encodes for P-glycoprotein Pcgp). P glycoprotein is a protective mechanism possessed by normal cells. Pgp is an ATP dependent membrane efflux pump. Its function is to expel a variety of foreign molecules including antitumour drugs from the cell. Long lived cells such as the haemopoietic stern cells, cells on excretory surfaces such as biliarr hepatocytes, proximal renal tubules and intestinal cells and the cells of the blood- brain barrier, all have high expression of Pgp. The MDR phenomenon illustrates how tumour cells adapt and enhance normal cell mechanism to deal with the effects of chemotherapy and how repeated cycles of chemotherapy select out a population of cells which have developed adaptive survival mechanism e. g. in myeloma where MDR proteins are rare at diagnosis but common at progression.",

Direct entry of M.+ along electrochemical gradient. Nat-K* sympo along with active reabsorption of glucose, aminoacids, organic anions and PO43. Exchange with W by Na* IW exchanger located in the luminal membrane of proximal tubule (PT) epithelial cells. The PT cells secrete W with the help of carbonic anhydrase. W ion exchanges with Nat- present in tubular fluid through Na+-H+ exchanger (antipoer) and forms H2. CO3 by combining with HCO3-. This H2. CO3 is broken into H20 + CO2 by brush border carbonic anhydrase; both CO2 and H20 diffuse inside the cell and recombine to form H2. CO3 with the help of intracellular carbonic anhydrase. This H, CO3 is the source of F1*. The dissociated HCO3- in the cell is transpoed to coical E. C. F. by basolateral membrane Na-F-HCO3- sympoer resulting in net reabsorption of Na. HCO3. Carbonic anydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide) act predominantly in PCT and inhibit Na. HCO3 reabsorption. The disropoionately large HCO3-, acetate, PO4-3, passive driving forces for Cl- to diffuse through the paracellular pathway, paicularly in the later PT. This takes Na' and H, 0 along to maintain electrical neutrality and isotonicity; reabsorption in PT is isotonic. Osmotic diuretics (mannitol) are solutes which are not absorbed in proximal tubule and therefore retain water. Site II Ascending limb of loop of Henle The thick ascending limb can be distinguished into two distinct poion. Medullary poion lined by cuboidal cells. Coical poion lined by flattened cells. Both poions are relatively impermeable to water but absorb salt actively and thus dilute tubular fluid. In the medullary poion a distinct luminal membrane carrier transpos ions in ratio of Nee-K+-2a. The sodium enters the cell is pumped to ECF by Na ATPase at the basolateral membrane. This Na+--K+--2. C1: sympo is inhibited by loop diuretics (eg-Furosemide). In addition, a Na*-C1- sympoer moves CI- down its electrochemical gradient into ECF and carries Na+ along. Site III - coical diluting segment of loop of Henle and early DT This segment is also impermeable to H20 and continues to absorb salt through Nat-Ct sympoer. Thiazide diuretics act at this site. Site IV - late distal tubule and collecting duct In late DT and CD, Na is actively reabsorbed; the cation-anion balance being maintained paly by passive CI-diffusion and paly by secretion of K+ and Fr. Absorption of Na+ at this site occurs through a specific amiloride sensitive Net' channel and is controlled to a large extent by aldosterone. K paring diuretics act at this site. Collecting tubule is the most impoant site of IC secretion by the kidney and the site at which viually all diuretic induced changes in KE balance occur - as IC secretion occurs in exchange of Nat, higher the Na+ load in CD higher will be K+ excretion in urine --> Diuretics which act on PCT (maximum absoion of Na+ occurs at PCT) like acetazolamide will cause maximum kaliuresis (IC excretion in urine). The principal cells are the major sites of Nat, IC-, and water transpo, and intercalated cells are the primary sites of Ft' secretion. The collecting tubule is also the site at which the final urine concentration is determined. ADH (vasopressin) controls the permeability of this segment to water by regulating the inseion of preformed water channels (aquaporin2, AQP2) into the apical membrane a G protein - coupled c.

        "exp": "The primary effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide is to inhibit both H+ secretion and Na. HCO3 reabsorption, making the urine alkaline. NH4+ excretion is reduced as a result of the diminished H+ secretion. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors restrict H+ secretion by inhibiting the intracellular hydration of CO2, a primary source of intracellular H+. The decline in H+ secretion inhibits the Na+-H+ exchange at the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule, which is the primary site of Na. HCO3 diuresis. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors also block the dehydration of H2. CO3 formed in the tubular lumen. Chronic doses of such drugs can lead to hyperchloremic acidosis (metabolic acidosis). Ref: Mc.

It is clinically applied for IgE immediate allergies, especially hay fever, uicaria. Ethylenediamines (Prototype: Pyrilamine): These include some of the most specific H1 antagonists.

        "exp": "A nondepolarizing skeletal muscle blockade caused by antagonists such as d-tubocurarine is produced when these drugs pharmacologically antagonize acetylcholine and bind N2-nicotinic receptors of the motor end plate. This binding hyperpolarizes the muscle cell membrane. Reversal of a nondepolarizing block requires additional acetylcholine to compete with the neuromuscular blocking agent. Indirect acting cholinergic drugs such as cholinesterase inhibitors potentiate acetylcholine levels, resulting in a non selective mechanism of action at cholinergic receptors. It is the nicotinic action of acetylcholine at N2-nicotinic sites that is responsible for reversing a nondepolarizing neuromuscular block. Sympathomimetics and sympatholytics are ineffective in reversing non depolarizing blockade because there are no adrenergic nerves innervating skeletal muscle. (There are a few b2-adrenergic receptors located on skeletal muscle cell membranes. Stimulation of such adrenoceptors may result in skeletal muscle fasciculation, but would not be sufficient to reverse muscle paralysis caused by a nondepolarizing blocker.) Parasympatholytics (also known as muscarinic antagonists) have no effect at the neuromuscular junction because muscarinic receptors are not found at such locations. Ref: Taylor P. (2011). Chapter 10.

A: Tetracycline Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection caused by unique serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis (L1, L2, L3) that are unlike those that typically cause urethritis, cervicitis, and proctitis (A-K). The hallmark of LGV is unilateral or bilateral tender lymphadenopathy that dramatically evolves 2 to 6 weeks after the primary lesion. The involved lymph nodes increase rapidly in size, and pain and erythema are common. If adjacent to one another, several involved lymph nodes may coalesce. The central areas of such lymph nodes can then undergo necrosis. Fluctuant and suppurative lymph nodes then develop, causing the classic 'bubo' of LGV. The bubo may then rupture and drain purulent material, which is associated with relief from symptoms. The 'groove sign' characteristic of LGV is seen if both the inguinal and the femoral nodes are involved. Tetracycline is the first choice drugs for LGV. Apa from LGV, tetracyclines are drug of choice for: STDs-Chlamydial non-specific urethritis/endocervicitis, granuloma inguinale Atypical pneumonia Cholera Brucellosis Plague Relapsing fever Rickettsial infections-typhus, rocky mountain spotted fever, Q fever etc.",

Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can reduce the amount of the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hypehyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect.

It is rarely a myelosuppressnat. Bleomycin. It is a glycopeptide antibiotic produced by the bacterium Streptomyces veicillus. Bleomycin refers to a family of structurally related compounds. When used as an anticancer agent, the chemotherapeutical forms are primarily bleomycin A2 and B2. It works by causing breaks in DNA. The drug is used in the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma (as a component of the ABVD regimen), squamous cell carcinomas, and testicular cancer, as well as in the treatment of plantar was and as a means of effecting pleurodesis. Bleomycin acts by induction of DNA strand breaks. DNA cleavage by bleomycin depends on oxygen and metal ions, at least in vitro. Therefore bleomycin is used in combination with doxorubicin in Hodgkins lymphoma, as they have additive and complementary effects on the DNA, since doxorubicin acts by intercalating between DNA strands, and also acts on topoisomerase II enzyme thus relaxing the topoisomerase complexes. The most serious complication of bleomycin is pulmonary fibrosis and impaired lung function. It has been suggested that bleomycin induces sensitivity to oxygen toxicity. Other side effects include fever, rash, dermatographism, hyperpigmentation, alopecia (hair loss) and Raynaud's phenomenon (discoloration of fingers and toes).",

        "exp": "Ans. C: Adenosine Initial measures to terminate SVT should include vagal maneuvers. If unsuccessful, termination can be achieved with antiarrhythmic drugs whose primary effects increase refractoriness and/ or decrease conduction (negative dromotropic effect) over the AV node. These drugs can have direct (e. g., verapamil blocks the slow-inward calcium current of the AV node) or indirect effects (e. g., digoxin increases vagal tone to the AV node). In most patients, the drug of choice is either adenosine or verapamil. The advantages of adenosine include its rapid onset of action (usually within 10-25 seconds a peripheral vein), sho half-life (less than 10 seconds) and high degree of efficacy. Its sho half-life minimizes the severity of side effects, such as facial flushing, chest tightness, dyspnea and transient sinus arrest and/or atrioventricular block. In general, adenosine has an excellent safety record, but pause-dependent torsade de pointes may infrequently occur and transient atrial fibrillation may occur due to shoening of the atrial action potential. Adenosine should be given with caution to patients with bronchospasm and is contraindicated in those with sinus node dysfunction or second- or third-degree heart block. Dipyridamole potentates adenosine's effects by blocking its cellular uptake and aminophylline blunts its effects by competitive receptor antagonism. Sequential dosing can be given at 60 second intervals due to adenosine's rapid metabolism. In AV node reentry the most common site of termination is the anterograde slow pathway. Termination may also occur indirectly, i. e., due to adenosine - induced atrial or ventricular premature beats",

PTT/ APTT It is a performance indicator measuring the efficacy of both the \"intrinsic\" (now referred to as the contact activation pathway) and the common coagulation pathways. Apa from detecting abnormalities in blood clotting, it is also used to monitor the treatment effects with heparin, a major anticoagulant. It is used in conjunction with the prothrombin time (PT) which measures the extrinsic pathway. Kaolin cephalin clotting time (KccT) is a historic name for the activated paial thromboplastin time Blood samples are collected in tubes with oxalate or citrate to arrest coagulation by binding calcium. The specimen is then delivered to the laboratory. In order to activate the intrinsic pathway, phospholipid, an activator (such as silica, celite, kaolin, ellagic acid), and calcium (to reverse the anticoagulant effect of the oxalate) are mixed into the plasma sample. The time is measured until a thrombus (clot) forms. The test is termed \"paial\" due to the absence of tissue factor from the reaction mixture The typical reference range is between 25 seconds and 39 s (depending on laboratory). Shoening of the PTT has little clinical relevance. Normal PTT times require the presence of the following coagulation factors: I, II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII. Notably, deficiencies in factors VII or XIII will not be detected with the PTT test. Prolonged APTT may indicate: - Use of heparin (or contamination of the sample) - Antiphospholipid antibody (especially lupus anticoagulant, which paradoxically increases propensity to thrombosis) - Coagulation factor deficiency (e. g. hemophilia) To distinguish the above causes, mixing tests are performed, in which the patient's plasma is mixed (initially at a 50: 50 dilution) with normal plasma. If the abnormality does not disappear, the sample is said to contain an \"inhibitor\" (either heparin, antiphospholipid antibodies or coagulation factor specific inhibitors), while if it does correct a factor deficiency is more likely. Deficiencies of factors VIII, IX, XI and XII and rarely von Willebrand factor (if causing a low factor VIII level) may lead to a prolonged a. PTT correcting on mixing studies.",

It is rarely a myelosuppressnat Bleomycin It is a glycopeptide antibiotic produced by the bacterium Streptomyces veicillus. Bleomycin refers to a family of structurally related compounds. When used as an anticancer agent, the chemotherapeutical forms are primarily bleomycin A2 and B2. It works by causing breaks in DNA. The drug is used in the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma (as a component of the ABVD regimen), squamous cell carcinomas, and testicular cancer, as well as in the treatment of plantar was and as a means of effecting pleurodesis Bleomycin acts by induction of DNA strand breaks. DNA cleavage by bleomycin depends on oxygen and metal ions, at least in vitro. Therefore bleomycin is used in combination with doxorubicin in Hodgkins lymphoma, as they have additive and complementary effects on the DNA, since doxorubicin acts by intercalating between DNA strands, and also acts on topoisomerase II enzyme thus relaxing the topoisomerase complexes The most serious complication of bleomycin is pulmonary fibrosis and impaired lung function. It has been suggested that bleomycin induces sensitivity to oxygen toxicity Other side effects include fever, rash, dermatographism, hyperpigmentation, alopecia (hair loss) and Raynaud's phenomenon (discoloration of fingers and toes).",

MRSA is by definition any strain of staphylococcus aureus that is resistant to a 13-lactams including penicillin, methicillin, cloxacillin, nafcillin, oxacillin and cephalosporins. Resistance develops due to alteration in transpeptidase (penicillin binding protein) on which all 13-lactam antibiotic act: so, MRSA is resistant to all 0-lactam antibiotics. MRSA (especially community acquired MRSA; CA-MRSA) display enhanced virulence, spreading more rapidly and causing disease much more severe than traditional staphylococcus aureus.",

        "question": "Spironolactone is least commonly used in which of the following: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Hypertension As an add-on drug, spironolcatone may be useful in hypeensive patients with significant hyperuricemia, hypokalemia, or glucose intolerance Spironolactone It is a synthetic 17-lactone drug that is a renal competitive aldosterone antagonist in a class of potassium-sparing diuretics It used primarily to treat heart failure, ascites in patients with liver disease, low-renin hypertension, hypokalemia, secondary hyperaldosteronism (such as occurs with hepatic cirrhosis), and Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism). On its own, spironolactone is only a weak diuretic because its effects target the distal nephron (collecting tubule), where urine volume can only be slightly modified; but it can be combined with other diuretics to increase efficacy. Due to its antiandrogen effect, it can also be used to treat hirsutism. It is also used for treating hair loss and acne in women, and can be used as a topical medication for treatment of male baldness. It is commonly used to treat symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) such as excess facial hair and acne. Spironolactone can cause gynecomastia in males and, unless regularly monitored, should not be given with potassium supplementation for fear of development of hyperkalemia. Spironolactone inhibits the effect of aldosterone by competing for intracellular aldosterone receptors in the coical collecting duct. This decreases the reabsorption of sodium and water, while decreasing the secretion of potassium. Spironolactone has a fairly slow onset of action, taking several days to develop, and, so, the effect diminishes slowly. Spironolactone has anti-androgen activity by directly binding to and blocking androgens from interacting with the androgen receptor, by blocking androgen production, and by increasing estrogen levels. Production of androgens is decreased by inhibiting 17alpha-hydroxylase and 17, 20-desmolase, which are enzymes in the testosterone biosynthesis pathway. Estrogen levels are increased by enhancing the peripheral conversion of testosterone to estradiol and by displacing estradiol from sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) Spironolactone is a synthetic steroid that acts as a competitive antagonist to aldosterone. Its onset and duration of action are determined by the kinetics of the aldosterone response in the target tissue. Substantial inactivation of spironolactone occurs in the liver and hepatitis or cirrhosis can lead to secondary aldosteronism, which is one indication for treatment. Spironolactone is associated with an increased risk of bleeding from the stomach and duodenum Because it also affects androgen receptors and other steroid receptors, it can cause gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities and testicular atrophy. Spironolactone often increases serum potassium levels and can cause hyperkalemia, therefore, it is recommended that people using this drug avoid potassium supplements and salt substitutes containing potassium. Long-term administration of spironolactone gives the histologic characteristic of spironolactone bodies in the adrenal coex. Spironolactone bodies are eosinophilic, round, concentrically laminated cytoplasmic inclusions surrounded by clear halos in preparations stained with hematoxylin and eosin.",

A: Sucralfate Sucralfate has very poor acid neutralizing capacity and it has no antisecretory propey Sucralfate It is a cytoprotective agent, primarily indicated for the treatment of active duodenal ulcers. Sucralfate is also used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and stress ulcers. Unlike the other classes of medications used for treatment of peptic ulcers, sucralfate is a sucrose sulfate-aluminium complex that binds to the mucosa, thus creating a physical barrier that impairs diffusion of hydrochloric acid in the gastrointestinal tract and prevents degradation of mucus by acid. It also stimulates bicarbonate output and acts like an acid buffer with cytoprotective propeies Sucralfate is a locally acting substance that in an acidic environment (pH < 4) reacts with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to form a cross-linking, viscous, paste-like material capable of acting as an acid buffer for as long as 6 to 8 hours after a single dose. It also attaches to proteins on the surface of ulcers, such as albumin and fibrinogen, to form stable insoluble complexes. These complexes serve as protective barriers at the ulcer surface, preventing fuher damage from acid, pepsin, and bile. In addition, it prevents back diffusion of hydrogen ions, and adsorbs both pepsin and bile acids.",

        "question": "Which of the following drug is contraindicated in glaucoma: September 2009",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Atropine Most categories of drugs that list glaucoma as a contraindication or adverse effect are concerned with inducing acute angle-closure glaucoma. These medications will incite an attack only in those individuals with occludable angles (ie, very narrow anterior chamber angles). The classes of medications that have the potential to induce angle closure are: - Topical anticholinergic (Atropine) or sympathomimetic dilating drops - Tricyclic antidepressants - Monoamine oxidase inhibitors Antihistamines - Antiparkinsonian drugs - Antipsychotic medications - Antispasmolytic agents. Sulfa containing medications may induce angle-closure glaucoma by a different angle-closure mechanism, involving anterior rotation of the ciliary body. Typically, the angle closure is bilateral and occurs within the first several doses of the sulfonamide-containing medication. Patients with narrow or wide open angles are potentially susceptible to this rare and idiosyncratic reaction. * Drug-induced elevation of IOP is more common by an open-angle mechanism: -- Coicosteroids are a class of drugs that may produce IOP elevation by this mechanism Atropine: Topical atropine is used as a cycloplegic, to temporarily paralyze the accommodation reflex, and as a mydriatic, to dilate the pupils. Atropine degrades slowly, typically wearing off in 7 to 14 days, so it is generally used as a therapeutic mydriatic, whereas tropicamide (a shoer-acting cholinergic antagonist) or phenylephrine (an alpha-adrenergic agonist) is preferred as an aid to ophthalmic examination. Atropine induces mydriasis by blocking contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle, which is normally stimulated by acetylcholine release, thereby allowing the radial pupillar dilator muscle to contract and dilate the pupil. Atropine induces cycloplegia by paralyzing the ciliary muscles, whose action inhibits accommodation to allow accurate refraction in children, helps to relieve pain associated with iridocyclitis, and treats ciliary block (malignant) glaucoma. Atropine is contraindicated in patients pre-disposed to narrow angle glaucoma. Adverse reactions to atropine include ventricular fibrillation, supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia, dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, loss of balance, dilated pupils, photophobia, dry mouth and potentially extreme confusion, dissociative hallucinations and excitation especially amongst the elderly. These latter effects are because atropine is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. A common mnemonic used to describe the physiologic manifestations of atropine overdose is: \"hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet, and mad as a hatter\". These associations reflect the specific changes of warm, dry skin from decreased sweating, blurry vision, decreased sweating/ lacrimation, vasodilation, and central nervous system effects on muscarinic receptors, type 4 and 5. This set of symptoms is known as anticholinergic toxidrome, and may also be caused by other drugs with anticholinergic effects, such as diphenhydramine, phenothiazine antipsychotics and benztropine. The antidote to atropine is physostigmine or pilocarpine.",

A first generation of antipsychotics, known as typical antipsychotics, was discovered in the 1950s. Most of the drugs in the second generation, known as atypical antipsychotics, have been developed more recently. All antipsychotic drugs tend to block D2 receptors in the dopamine pathways of the brain, but atypicals tend to act on serotonin as well. A number of (adverse) effects have been observed, including extrapyramidal effects on motor control - including: - Akathisia (constant discomfo to a varying degree causing restlessness), - Tremor, and abnormal muscle contractions, - An involuntary movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia, and - Elevations in prolactin (resulting in breast enlargement in men, breast milk discharge, or sexual dysfunction).",
