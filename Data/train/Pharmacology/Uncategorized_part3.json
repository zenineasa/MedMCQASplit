GABAA Flumazenil is a highly selective competitive antagonist at benzodiazepine receptors so does not oppose sedation due to non benzodiazepine e. g., barbiturates alcohol. Gamma Amino. Butyric acid (GABA) is the most impoant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the C. N. S. comprising up of 40% of all synapses. Its main action is to inhibit transmission along neurons in which they are present. Normally proper functioning of the brain is ensured by a balance between the action of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. - Simply put, excitatory neurotransmitters conduct the impulses forward where as inhibitory neurotransmitters do not conduct the impulse, forward. The GABAA receptor not only binds to the endogenous ligand GABA but is also the binding site for various other external ligands such as Benzodiazepenes, Barbiturates. (GABAA receptor has several binding sites) An impoant point to emphasize here is that though the benzodiazepine drugs bind to GABAA receptors; their binding site is distinct from the binding site of the endogenous GABA ligand. - In fact, it produces different effect on binding too. - When Benzodiazepenes bind to its site on the GABA receptor it does not directly increase the entry of chlorides rather it enhances the effectiveness of GABA producing a larger inhibitory effect. Other drugs that act on the GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complex Barbiturates too act on the GABAA receptor. - But their site of action is different from Benzodiazepenes. They also enhance the GABA. function but at high doses have the additional capacity directly to open the membrane chloride channel. This explains why barbiturates and alcohol are more toxic in overdose than the benzodiazepenes. Not only the binding site of benzodiazepenes is distinct from Barbiturates but the mechanism of action too is different. Benzodiazepenes Causing burst of chloride channel opening to occur more often. Barbiturates Causing duration of bursts of chloride channel opening to become longer. It is evident from the above diagram that though benzodiazepem and barbiturates act on the same receptor i. e., GABAA -benzodiazepem receptor complex, their binding site is site is quite distinct from each other. Once again, Even though benzodiazepenes and barbiturates act on the same receptor their binding site on the receptor is quite distinct from each other. - Flumazenil is highly selective competitive antagonist at benzodiazepene receptor, so it does not oppose sedation due to non benzodiazepenes e. g., barbiturates, alcohol. An impoant point:? There is ceain other class of hypnotic that act on the same receptor site as the benzodiazepens on the GABAA benzodiazepene receptor complex, 50 their action too is blocked by Benzodiazepene antagonist i. e., Flumazenil. Non Benzodiazepene hypnotics that act at the GABAA- Benzodiazepene receptor complex. - Zopiclone - Zolpidem - Zaleplon",

It is rare at low doses used for hypertension, but may be of grave consequence, when brisk diuresis is induced or on prolonged therapy, especially if dietary K+ intake is low. Degree of hypokalaemia appears to be related to the duration of action of the diuretic; longer acting drugs cause more K+ loss. Hypokalemia is less common with standard doses of high ceiling diuretics than with thiazides, possibly because of shorter duration of action of the former, which permits intermittent operation of compensatory repletion mechanisms. Hypokalaemia can be prevented and treated by: (a) High dietary K+ intake or (b) Supplements of KCl (24- 72 m. Eq/day) or (c) Concurrent use of K+ sparing diuretics.

Glucuronidation occurs mainly in the liver, although the enzyme responsible for its catalysis, UDP? glucuronyltransferase, has been found in all major body organs (e. g., intestine, kidneys, brain, adrenal gland, spleen, and thymus). Compounds with a hydroxyl or carboxylic acid group are easily conjugated with glucuronic acid which is derived from glucose. Examples are- chloramphenicol, aspirin, paracetamol, lorazepam, morphine, metronidazole. Not only drugs but endogenous substrates like bilirubin, steroidal hormones and thyroxine utilize this pathway. Glucuronidation increases the molecular weight of the drug which ours its excretion in bile. Drug glucuronides excreted in bile can be hydrolysed bybacteria in the gut-the liberated drug is reabsorbed and undergoes the same fate. This enterohepatic cycling of the drug prolongs its action, e. g. phenolphthalein, oral contraceptives.",

The specific receptor subtypes it activates are present on the cranial aeries and veins. Acting as an agonist at these receptors, Sumatriptan reduces the vascular inflammation associated with migraine. It causes constriction of dilated cranial extracerebral blood vessels, especially the aerio-venous shunts in the carotid aery. Dilatation of these shunt vessels during migraine attack is believed to dive blood flow away from the brain parenchyma. Sumatriptan is administered in several forms; tablets, subcutaneous injection, and nasal spray. Oral administration (as succinate) suffers from poor bioavailability, paly due to presystemic metabolism -- some of it gets broken down in the stomach and bloodstream before it reaches the target aeries. Sumatriptan is metabolised primarily by monoamine oxidase A into an indole acetic acid analogue, pa of which is fuher conjugated with glucuronic acid. These metabolites are excreted in the urine and bile. Large doses of sumatriptan (200 mg/ day) can cause sulfhemoglobinemia, a rare condition in which the blood changes from red to greenish-black, due to the integration of sulfur into the hemoglobin molecule. Serious cardiac events include coronary aery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.",

For option a & c you should know the following impoant facts: o As I have explained in previous explanation; usually inactive confirmation (Ri) of receptor predominate in the absence of agonist and the signal output is low. If the preexisting or basal equilibrium for unliganded receptors lies far. in the direction of inactive confirmation (Ri), it may be very difficult to demonstrate inverse agonism because receptors are already existing in inactive state and inverse agonist has nothing to do (inverse agonist shifts the equilibrium towards inactive confirmation, but the receptors are already existing in inactive confirmation). o Some times receptor can adopt active confirmation (in the absence of agonist) that can produce a cellular response spontaneously -3 constitutional spontaneous activity without an agonist. In this situation, the tissue behaves as if there were agonist present. In this situation. i) Inverse agonism can be easily observed as inverse agonist shifts the equilibrium towards inactive state. So, it inhibits the agonist-independent constitutional signaling which can be easily observed. ii) Antagonist will have no effect as antagonist has equal affinity for active (Ra) as well as inactive (Ri) state of receptor. So, the equilibrium will remain the same. iii) It will be difficult to demonstrate activity of agonist as agonist shifts the equilibrium towards active confirmation, but the receptors are already existing in active confirmation (constitutional spontaneous active state). o Now you can easily understand: A.

Oxybutynin both exes a direct antispasmodic effect and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle.

In addition, oxybutynin will not interact with her current medication regimen. Bumetanide is a \"loop\" diuretic used in the treatment of edematous states secondary to a wide variety of pathologic conditions. Since this agent promotes diuresis, it would most likely worsen the signs and symptoms of persistent urinary urgency, and urge incontinence. Metoprolol is a beta-1 selective receptor blocking agent indicated for the treatment of hypertension and tachyarrhythmias. The use of this agent would not have an effect on this patient's persistent urinary problems. Fuhermore, this agent is generally not used in diabetic patients, since it can block the normal premonitory signs of hypoglycemia. Neostigmine inhibits acetylcholine hydrolysis in the synaptic cleft acetylcholinesterase inhibition. The net effect is an increase in cholinergic activity, leading to detrusor muscle contraction.

        "question": "Free water clearance decreased by?",
        "exp": "Furosemide Free water clearance Kidney excretes some solutes in the urine daily. The volume of water in urine, excreted per unit time in excess of that required to excrete the contained solutes isoosmatically with plasma is called free water clearance. Free water clearance is positive dilute urine, negative when concentrated urine is passed and zero when isotonic urine is passed. For example, if 1 lit water is required to excrete the contained solutes per day following three conditions may occur (numerical value are just for example). - If urine output is 1. 5 litre than free water clearance will be + (positive) *5 lit/day. - If urine output is 1 litre per day, the free water clearance will be zero. - If urine output is *5 litre per day, the free water clearance will be -- (negative). 5lit/day. Action of diuretics To understand the effect of different diuretics on free water clearance one should know the following facts. The nephron of the kidney is arranged in such a way that some poion of it lies in the coex and some poion of it lies in the medulla. - Pas of nephron in the coex - Proximal convoluted tubule Distal convoluted tubule Thick ascending limb of Henle's loop Coical collecting duct - Pas of nephron in the medulla -9 *Descending thin limb of Henle's loop Ascending thin limb of Henle's loop Medullary collecting duct The coical poion of the nephron are responsible for diluting the urine (i. e., positive free water clearance) The medullary poions of the nephron are responsible for concentrating the urine (i. e.. negative free water clearance) Thus the diuretics which act on both medulla and coex can affect both the positive and negative free water clearance where as diuretics which act on either coex or medulla cannot affect both the negative and positive free water clearance. Furosentide Furosemide is a drug which act on both coex and medulla. It acts on the ascending limb of loop of henle which has both coical and medullary component i. e. the thin ascending pa is situated in the coex and the thicker poion is situated in the medulla. Furosemide acts in the following ways: - In hypovolemia medullary pa of ascending limb concentrate the --) negative free water clearance urine to preserve water --> block negative free water clearance - Furosemide blocks the concentrating ability of the ascending limb pa of medullary pa - In volume overload, coical poion of ascending limb of henle --) positive free water clearance loop dilute the urine to decrease the volume overload - Furosemide blocks this diluting ability as well block positive free water clearance. Thus Furosemide can block positive as well as negative free water clearance. Thiazide diuretics act on DCT and proximal pa of CD, block positive free water clearance but has no effect on negative free water clearance. In hypervolumia DCT dilute the urine to decrease the volume overload -4 positive free water clearance --> blocked by thiazide. As thiazide diuretics no effect on medullary interstitium (in contrast to furosamide) so it does not effect the kidney's ability to concentrate urine during hypovolemia --4 no effect on negative free water. Two more options given in the question block free water clearance Vincristine Vincristine increases the secretion of the hormone A. D. H. Inreased A. D. H blocks free water clearance. Chlorpropamide Chlorpropamide sensitizes the kidney to ADH action. Thus it may impair the free water clearance and in some patients may result in hyponatremia and water intoxication. The impoant point to remember about chlorpropamide is that its action depends on small amount of ADH it won't act in the absence of ADH. Most probably the question should have been framed as \"All of the following blocks free water clearance, except\" But if you have to choose one answer, go for Furosemide as it will always block free water clearance whereas other drugs will cause them occasionally as their adverse effect.",

There is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing will be recovered from the sale of that drug.

Alcohol. So the withdrawl symptoms can be initially controlled by replacing alcohol with any other C. N. S. depressant drug and subsequently the dose of the C. N. S. depressant can be tapered, Most of the C. N. S. depressant drugs are effective but benzodiazepenes have the highest margin of safety and lowest cost and are therefore the preferred class of drugs. Most clinicians use long acting benzodiazepenes such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam because sho acting benzodiazepenes can produce rapidly changing blood levels. Enough dose of chlordiazepoxide is administered on day one to allete symptoms and then the dose is gradually decreased. Also know T/T of patients with delirium tremens in Alcoholic withdrawl The impoant point to consider about delirium tremens is that the course is likely to continue for 3-5 days. High doses of benzodiazepenes are used. Sometimes antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol, ziprasidone or olanzapine have been used. T/T of patients with alcohol withdrawl seizures Benzodiazepenes are used. Use of anticonvulsants is not indicated.

However it potentiates the hypoglycemic action of insulin and sulfonylureas Biguanide Examples of biguanides: - Metformin - widely used in treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 - Phenformin - withdrawn from the market in most countries due to toxic effects - Buformin - withdrawn from the market due to toxic effects - Proguanil - an antimalarial drug Biguanides do not affect the output of insulin, unlike other hypoglycemic agents such as sulfonylureas and meglitinides. Therefore, not only are they effective in Type 2 diabetics but they can also be effective in Type 1 patients in conce with insulin therapy. The mechanism of action of biguanides is not fully understood. However, in hyperinsulinemia, biguanides can lower fasting levels of insulin in plasma. Their therapeutic uses derive from their tendency to reduce gluconeogenesis in the liver, and, as a result, reduce the level of glucose in the blood. Biguanides also tend to make the cells of the body more willing to absorb glucose already present in the blood stream, and there again reducing the level of glucose in the plasma. The most common side effect is diarrhea and dyspepsia, occurring in up to 30% of patients. The most impoant and serious side effect is lactic acidosis, therefore metformin is contraindicated in renal insufficiency. Renal functions should be assessed before staing metformin. Phenformin and buformin are more prone to cause acidosis than metformin; therefore they have been practically replaced by it. However, when metformin is combined with other drugs (combination therapy), hypoglycemia and other side effects are possible.",

Mechanism of action Pioglitazone is a potent and higly selective agonist for peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPAR - PPAR receptors are, found in tissues impoant. for insulin action such as adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver. - PPAR is. found in highest level in adipose tissue. - Activation of PPAR7 nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism. -Pioglitazone appears to reduce insulin resistance by enhancing fatty acids storage and possibly by increasing adinopectin levels. - In animal models of diabetes pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperiglyceridemia which are characteristic of insulin resistant states. Pioglitazone depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action. - Since piogletazone acts by enhancing the effect of circulating insulin it does not lower blood glucose in persons that lack endogenous insulin, - Circulating insulin level decrease with the use of pioglitazone indicating decrease in insulin resistance. Thiazolidinediones are considered euglycemics. -The overall response is similar to sulfonylureas and biguanide monotherapy. - Because their mechanism of action involves gene regulation, the thiazolidinediones have a slow onset and offset of activity over weeks or even months. - Combination therapy with sulfonylurea or insulin may lead to hypoglycemia. Metabolism of Pioglitazone Pioglitazone is extensively metabolized in liver by hydroxylation and oxidation. aiims pgmee answers & explanations - May 2011 Multiple CYP isoforms are involved in the metabolism of pioglitazone. - The cytochromes p450 isoforms primarily invove are: -CYP2 C8 - CYP 3. A4 (to a lesser degree) Liver function should be monitored in patients receiving thiazolidinediones even though pioglitazone and rosiglitazone rarely have been associated with hepatotoxicity. Originally three member of thiazolidinedione family were introduced - Pioglitazone - Rosiglitazone - Troglitazone (This was withdrawn from the market due to an increase incidence of drug induced hepatitis). The withdraw! of troglitazone has also led to concerns of other thiazolidinediones also increasing the incidence of hepatitis and potential liver failure. Because of this FDA, recommends two to three months checks of liver enzyme for the first year of thiazolidinedione therapy, to check for this rare but potentially catastrophic complication. - Till date newer thiazolidinediones have been free of this problem. Thiazolidinediones should not be used in patients with New. York Hea association class III or IV failure. The main side effect of all thiazolidinediones is water retention leading to edema. Sometimes there is significant water retention leading to decompensation of potentially previously unrecognized heart failure. herefore thiazolidinediones should be prescribed with both caution and patient warnings about the potential, for water retention/weight gain especially in patients with decreased ventricular function.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Quinolone Betalactam antibiotics (penicillins and most of the cephalosporins) are safe during pregnancy Erythromycin base is safe but erythromycin estolate should be avoided Quinolones and fluoroquinolones They are chemotherapeutic bactericidal drugs, eradicating bacteria by interfering with DNA replication. Quinolones inhibit the bacterial DNA gyrase or the topoisomerase II enzyme, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and transcription. Quinolones can enter cells easily porins and, therefore, are often used to treat intracellular pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. For many Gram-negative bacteria, DNA gyrase is the target, whereas topoisomerase IV is the target for many Gram-positive bacteria. Theophylline, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and coicosteroids enhance the toxicity of fluoroquinolones. Products containing multivalent cations, such as aluminum- or magnesium-containing antacids and products containing calcium, iron, or zinc, invariably result in marked reduction of oral absorption of fluoroquinolones. Many fluoroquinolones, especially ciprofloxacin, inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP1. A2. This inhibition causes an increased level of, for example, antidepressants such as amitriptyline and imipramine, clozapine (an atypical antipsychotic), caffeine, olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic). Fluoroquinolones are well tolerated, with most side effects being mild to moderate. Some of the serious adverse effects that occur more commonly with fluoroquinolones than with other antibiotic drug classes include CNS and tendon toxicity. Fluoroquinolones are sometimes associated with an QTc interval prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias, convulsions, tendon rupture, torsade de pointes and hypoglycemia. Moxifloxacin carries a higher risk of QTc prolongation Gatifloxacin has been most frequently linked to disturbed blood sugar levels, although all quinolones carry these risks. Some quinolones were withdrawn from the market because of these adverse events (for example, sparfloxacin was associated with phototoxicity and QTc prolongation, thrombocytopenia and nephritis were seen with tosufloxacin, and hepatotoxicity with trovafloxacin). Fluoroquinolones are considered high-risk antibiotics for the development of Clostridium difficile and MRSA infections. The CNS is an impoant target for fluoroquinolone-mediated neurotoxicity. Moxifloxacin came out worst among the quinolones for causing CNS toxicity. Quinolones are contraindicated if a patient has epilepsy, QT prolongation, pre-existing CNS lesions, CNS inflammation or those who have suffered a stroke. There are safety concerns of fluoroquinolone use during pregnancy and, as a result, are contraindicated except for when no other safe alternative antibiotic exists. They are also contraindicated in children due to the risks of damage to the musculoskeletal system.",

The other smooth muscle that plays an impoant role in micturition is the internal sphincter. Internal sphincter is a concentraction of smooth muscle at the bladder neck. It is well developed only in males and its principal function is to prevent retrograde. flow of semen during ejaculation. When detrusor relaxes and the sphincters close urine is stored. Whereas voiding requires contraction of destrusor accompanied by relaxation of sphincters. Detrusor is innervated mainly by parasympathetic nerves which are excitatory and cause the muscle to contract where as internal sphincter is rich in al adrenoreceptor (sympathetic nerves). Thus the mechanisms of urine voiding involves:? - Increased parasympathetic drive Contracts the detrusor - Decreased sympathetic drive ---> Relax the sphincter Detrusor instability or unstable bladder is characterized by uninhibited, unstable contractions of the detrusor which may be of unknown etiology or secondary to an upper motor neuron lesion or bladder neck obstruction. Since detrusor contracts under parasympathetic influence, Anticholinergic (specifically antimuscarinic) drugs are used to treat overactive bladder disease or detrusor instability. These agents lower intravesical pressure, increase capacity and reduce the. frequency of contractions by antagonizing parasympathetic control of bladder. These agents include: -Darifenacin -Solefenacin - Tolterodine -Trospium chloride -Oxybutynin - -Solifenacin - Flavoxate Duloxetine is used in stress incontinence. It is a dual norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Its mechanism of action is thought to be centrally, by increasing urethral sphincter tone and contractility. It can be used in mixed incontinence.

        "question": "All of the following drugs cause osteoporosis except: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Alendronate Biphosphonates are the first drug of choice for treating post-menopausal osteoporosis PLEASE NOTE: A biphosphonate (pamidronate or zolendronic acid) inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption and is paicularly useful in hypercalcemia of malignancy as well Osteoporosis In osteoporosis the bone mineral density (BMD) is reduced, bone microarchitecture is deteriorating, and the amount and variety of proteins in bone is altered. Osteoporosis is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a bone mineral density that is 2. 5 standard detions or more below the mean peak bone mass (average of young, healthy adults) as measured by DXA; the term \"established osteoporosis\" includes the presence of a fragility fracture. The disease may be classified as primary type 1, primary type 2, or secondary. The form of osteoporosis most common in women after menopause is referred to as primary type 1 or postmenopausal osteoporosis. Primary type 2 osteoporosis or senile osteoporosis occurs after age 75 and is seen in both females and males at a ratio of 2: 1. Finally, secondary osteoporosis may arise at any age and affects men and women equally. This form of osteoporosis results from chronic predisposing medical problems or disease, or prolonged use of medications such as glucocoicoids, when the disease is called steroid- or glucocoicoid-induced osteoporosis (SIOP or GIOP). Ceain medications have been associated with an increase in osteoporosis risk; only steroids and anticonvulsants are classically associated Steroid-induced osteoporosis (SIOP) arises due to use of glucocoicoids - analogous to Cushing's syndrome and involving mainly the axial skeleton. The synthetic glucocoicoid prescription drug prednisone is a main candidate after prolonged intake. Barbiturates, phenytoin and some other enzyme-inducing antiepileptics - These probably accelerate the metabolism of vitamin D. L-Thyroxine over-replacement may contribute to osteoporosis, in a similar fashion as thyrotoxicosis does. Anticoagulants - Long-term use of heparin is associated with a decrease in bone density, and warfarin (and related coumarins) have been linked with an increased risk in osteoporotic fracture in long-term use. Proton pump inhibitors - These drugs inhibit the production of stomach acid; it is thought that this interferes with calcium absorption. Chronic phosphate binding may also occur with aluminium-containing antacids. Thiazolidinediones (used for diabetes) - Rosiglitazone and possibly pioglitazone, inhibitors of PPAR-gamma, have been linked with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture. Chronic lithium therapy has been associated with osteoporosis The diagnosis of osteoporosis can be made using conventional radiography and by measuring the bone mineral density (BMD). The most popular method of measuring BMD is dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA). There are several medications used to treat osteoporosis, depending on gender. Medications themselves can be classified as antiresorptive or bone anabolic agents. Antiresorptive agents work primarily by reducing bone resorption, while bone anabolic agents build bone rather than inhibit resorption. Bisphosphonates are the main pharmacological measures for treatment. However, newer drugs have appeared in the 1990s, such as teriparatide and strontium ranelate. In confirmed osteoporosis, bisphosphonate drugs are the first-line treatment in women. The most often prescribed bisphosphonates are presently sodium alendronate, risedronate or ibandronate. Oral bisphosphonates are relatively poorly absorbed, and must therefore be taken on an empty stomach, with no food or drink to follow for the next 30 minutes. They are associated with inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) Estrogen replacement therapy remains a good treatment for prevention of osteoporosis. Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) are a class of medications that act on the estrogen receptors throughout the body in a selective manner. Normally, bone mineral density (BMD) is tightly regulated by a balance between osteoblast and osteoclast activity in the trabecular bone. Estrogen has a major role in regulation of the bone formation-resorption equilibrium, as it stimulates osteoblast activity. Some SERMs such as raloxifene, act on the bone by slowing bone resorption by the osteoclasts. Raloxifene has the added advantage of reducing the risk of invasive breast cancer. Calcitonin works by directly inhibiting osteoclast activity the calcitonin receptor. Teriparatide (recombinant parathyroid hormone residues 1-34) has been shown to be effective in osteoporosis. It acts like parathyroid hormone and stimulates osteoblasts, thus increasing their activity. It is used mostly for patients with established osteoporosis (who have already fractured), have paicularly low BMD or several risk factors for fracture or cannot tolerate the oral bisphosphonates. Calcium salts come as water insoluble and soluble formulations. Calcium carbonate is the primary water insoluble drug, while calcium citrate, lactate, and gluconate are water soluble. Sodium fluoride treatment in patients with osteoporosis has been shown to cause skeletal changes such as pronounced bone density with increased number and thickness of trabeculae, coical thickening, and paial obliteration of the medullary space. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that mimics the activity of osteoprotegerin. It binds to RANKL, thereby preventing RANKL from interacting with RANK and reducing its bone resorption. Oral strontium ranelate is an alternative oral treatment, belonging to a class of drugs called \"dual action bone agents\" (DABAs). Strontium ranelate has side effect benefits over the bisphosphonates, as it does not cause any form of upper GI side effect, which is the most common cause for medication withdrawal in osteoporosis. Calcium is required to suppo bone growth, bone healing and maintain bone strength and is one aspect of treatment for osteoporosis. A high intake of vitamin D reduces fractures in the elderly It did increase formation of kidney stones by 17%. Calcium and vitamin D are currently recommended for the primary prevention of osteoporosis and the primary and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures.",

Its mechanism of action appears to involve inhibition of hormone secretion, including 5-HT and various other GI peptides (e. g., gastrin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), insulin, secretin, etc.). Octreotide has been used off label, with varying success, in other forms of secretory diarrhea such as chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, diarrhea associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and diabetes-associated diarrhea. Its greatest utility, however, may be in the \"dumping syndrome\" seen in some patients after gastric surgery and pyloroplasty. A long-acting preparation of octreotide acetate enclosed in biodegradable microspheres is available for use in the treatment of diarrheas associated with carcinoid tumors and VIP-secreting tumors, as well as in the treatment of acromegaly.

        "question": "Regarding COX-2 which of the following is its function a. EUR'",
        "exp": "Cell proliferation??? The enzymes that conve arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 are named cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (original name was prostaglandin H synthase). The propeies of COX-1 are different from those of COX-2. It was originally thought that the. function of COX-1 was involved in physiological phenomena where as that of COX-2 was involved in various pathologies. COX-1 is considered as the constitutive enzyme or the housekeeping enzyme that is naturally expressed on all cell surfaces. COX-2 is known as inducible enzyme which is not naturally expressed on the cells but is expressed on stimulation of cells. Functions of COX-1 and COX-2 Inflammation During inflammation, COX-1 m. RNA, protein and activity levels do not change, but COX-2 levels increase dramatically, and as a result prostaglandin production increases. - Moreover, when COX-2 specific inhibitors are administered, prostaglandin production and subsequent inflammation are significantly reduced. - These data have lead to the conclusion that COX-2 is involved in inflammation whereas COX-1 is not. - During the inflammation process, COX-I is though to contribute to resolution. The COX-2 gene is paicularly responsive to mediators of inflammation. - For example, IL-la, IL-I b, TNF-a and LPS induce COX-2 gene expression and subsequent prostaglandin production. Therefore COX-2 inhibitors have been used to attenuate the symptoms of inflammation such as osteoahritis, rheumatoid ahritis and musculoskeletal pains. Cardiovascular system It is well known that the platelet has COX-1 protein alone (no COX-2). The thromboxane A2 produced COX-1 has an impoant role in thrombosis. - It has been thought that vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells have COX-1 and that prostacyclin formed COX-1 has an impoant role in blood flow, blood pressure and antiaggregation of platelets. However, a recent work has shown that prostacyclin in vascular cells is produced by COX-2 as well as COX-1 under both physiological and pathological conditions. - These results raised the possibility of an increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with COX-2 specific inhibitors. However, trials have not confirmed these results. Tumorigenesis COX-2 causes tumorigenesis and tumour growth. - Overexpression of COX-2 in tumor cells causes cells to escape from apoptosis and to invade the matrix. - The contribution of COX-2 to tumorigenesis is mainly through three processes. a) Induction of angiogenic, factors such as VEGF b) Antiapoptosis and c) Development of malignancy In vivo, tumour associated macrophages as well as tumor cells produce \"PGE2 COX-2\" and the PGE2 produced, induces VEGF and finally VEGF stimulates angiogenesis. Renal function COX-1 is primarily expressed in podocytes and collecting duct cells and is involved in glomerulogenesis. COX-2 is detected in renal vasculature, medullary interstitial cells and the macula densa. COX-2 is involved in renal perfusion and glomerular hemodynamics. Cyclooxygenase function can also be assessed by disrupting COX-1 and COX-2 genes in mice COX-2 deficient mice demonstrates following:- Defect in female reproductive functions including ovulation, feilization and implantation and decidualization Reduction in brain injury induced by ischemia Suppression of tumorigenesis Renal nephropathy Cardiac. fibrosis Peritonitis Failure of ductus aeriosus closure Even after this extensive discussion, 1 am not sure about the answer. Since COX-2 has a role in the development of twnorigenesis, cell proliferation seems to be the appropriate answer. COX-2 causes tumorigenesis by induction of VEGF. VEGF is vascular endothelial growth factor and it causes endothelial proliferation. We are not sure of the answer. Go through the. following sites on internet. http//www. ncbi. nlm. gov/pubmed/18039779; http/Avvvw. ncbi. nlin. nih. gov/pubmed/12045254; Jun invest 2002 June 109 (11/1405=15); www. ncbi. nlm. gov/pubmed/16219005; http//www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pubmed/12444028 COX-2 seems to regulate all the, functions mentioned in the question. We have looked into numerous texts and internet sites for this one. But we cannot come up with some conclusive material on this one. There are ceain texts which say that COX-2 is implicated in tumors genesis through all the following mechanisms Cellular proliferation Antiapoptosis Cellular differentiation Cellular migration Cellular adhesion If the question is repeated again with the same options we would go for cellular proliferation.",

Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase prevents the removal of bicarbonate ions from the tubular fluid, which initially increases urine pH. The result is heavy spillage of bicarbonate in the urine, which is the hallmark of type 2 A (renal tubular acidosis). However, once the plasma levels of bicarbonate have decreased sufficiently, the bicarbonaturia ceases and the plasma HCO3- levels stabilize at a lower than normal level.

RH and pituitary gonadotropin secretion and by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis in both women and men. In the ovary, PRL blocks folliculogenesis and inhibits granulosa cell aromatase activity, leading to hypoestrogenism and anovulation. PRL also has a luteolytic effect, generating a shoened, or inadequate, luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In men, attenuated LH secretion leads to low testosterone levels and decreased spermatogenesis. These hormonal changes decrease libido and reduce feility in patients with hyperprolactinemia.

Many patients have durable responses--up to 12-18 months in refractory disease and even longer in some patients treated at diagnosis. The success of thalidomide in myeloma has led to numerous clinical trials in other diseases such as myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia, and graft-versus-host disease, as well as in solid tumors like colon cancer, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and prostate cancer, with variable results to date. Thalidomide has been used for many years in the treatment of some manifestations of leprosy and has been reintroduced in the USA for erythema nodosum leprosum; it is also useful in management of the skin manifestations of lupus erythematosus.

Alanine It is an alpha-adrenergic agonist (selective for alpha-2-adrenergic receptors) psychoactive drug used as a sympatholytic or antihypeensive. It continues to have a role in otherwise difficult to treat hypertension and gestational hypertension (also known as pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH)). Methyldopa is used in the clinical treatment of the following disorders: - Hypertension - Gestational hypertension (or pregnancy-induced hypertension) and pre-eclampsia Methyldopa has a dual mechanism of action: - It is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme DOPA decarboxylase, also known as aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, which conves L-DOPA into dopamine. - Dopamine is a precursor for norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and subsequently epinephrine (adrenaline). - This inhibition results in reduced dopaminergic and adrenergic neurotransmission in the peripheral nervous system. - This effect may lower blood pressure and cause central nervous system effects such as depression, anxiety, apathy, anhedonia, and parkinsonism. - It is conveed to alpha-methylnorepinephrine by dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH). - Alpha-methylnorepinephrine is an agonist of presynaptic central nervous system alpha-2-adrenergic receptors. - Activation of these receptors in the brainstem appears to inhibit sympathetic nervous system output and lower blood pressure. This is also the mechanism of action of clonidine. Methyldopa exhibits variable absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. It is metabolized in the liver and intestines and is excreted in urine. Side effects may include: - Psychological Depression and/or even suicidal ideation, as well as nightmares Decreased aleness, awareness, and wakefulness Cognitive and memory impairment Derealization and/or depersonalization, as well as mild psychosis Physiological Miosis Xerostomia Gastrointestinal disturbances such as diarrhea and/or constipation Myalgia or muscle aches, ahralgia or joint pain, and/or paresthesia (\"pins and needles\") Restless legs syndrome (RLS) Parkinsonian symptoms such as muscle tremors, rigidity, hypokinesia, and/or balance or postural instability Akathisia, ataxia, dyskinesia as well as even tardive dyskinesia, and/or dystonia Bell's palsy or facial paralysis Sexual dysfunction consisting of impaired erectile dysfunction and/or anorgasmia Hyperprolactinemia or excess prolactin, gynecomastia/breast enlargement in males, and/or amenorrhoea or absence of menstrual cycles in females Bradycardia Ohostatic hypotension (also known as postural hypotension) Hepatitis, hepatotoxicity Pancreatitis Haemolytic anemia Myelotoxicity or bone marrow suppression Lichenoid reactions such as skin lesions and/or rashes",

Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry of the hip had shown her to have osteoporosis. She became menopausal at age 50 and did not begin hormone replacement therapy because of a strong family history of breast cancer. She now fears a future hip fracture and would like to begin a bone loss prevention regime. Which of the following pharmaceutical agents is most appropriate for this patient?",
        "exp": "Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that helps prevent osteoporosis by lessening bone resorption and reducing bone turnover. It lowers risk for veebral fractures by 40% to 50%. It is a bone-preserving alternative for women who prefer to avoid estrogen. Raloxifene does not cause breast pain and may lessen the risk for breast cancer in menopausal women. There is also a orable effect on LDL and cholesterol. Calcitonin nasal spray is an osteoclastic bone resorption inhibitor that modestly increases bone mineral density and reduces the incidence of veebral fracture. Although it is an estrogen alternative for bone preservation, its impact on hip fracture is not known. It is also lacks the anti-breast cancer propeies of raloxifene. Oral conjugated estrogen and transdermal estradiolare not the best choices, as this patient wants to avoid estrogen because of a strong family history of breast cancer. The route of administration of estrogen has been shown to have similar effects on bone preservation, even though the transdermal dosage is generally half that of the oral dosage. Breast cancer risk, however, is slightly increased with the unopposed higher dosage oral estrogen replacement. Tamoxifen, while indicated in the long-term care of breast cancer patients, is not alone useful for treatment or prevention of osteoporosis. Tamoxifen is an anti-estrogen agent that competes with estrogen for binding sites. Ref: Shoback D. (2013). Chapter 58. Osteoporosis & Glucocoicoid-Induced Osteoporosis. In J. B. Imboden, D. B.

Like other foreign substances (xenobiotics), body tries to eliminate drugs by various mechanisms for ridding itself of chemical intruders. Biotransformation means chemical alteration of the drug in the body. Why drug transformation is necessary? Kidney plays a pivotal role in terminating the activity of drugs. For renal excretion the drug tends to be polar (lipid insoluble/water soluble) so that it can not diffuse back from tubular lumen and can be excreted. But pharmacologically active organic molecules (drugs) tend to be lipophlic (nonpolar) and remains unionized or only paially ionized at physiological pH. Biotransformation is needed to render nonpolar (lipid soluble) compounds polar (water soluble) so that they are not reabsorbed in the renal tubules and are excreted. Sites and processes of biotransformation Primary site of drug metabolism is liver, others are - kidney, intestine, lung and plasma. Biotransformation of drugs may lead to:- Active metabolite from an active drug Many drugs are paially conveed to one or more active metabolites. The effects observed are the sumtotal of that due to the parent drug and its active metabolite. Activation of inactive drugs Few drugs are inactive as such and need conversion in the body to one or more active metabolites. Such a drug is called prodrug.",

Hepatic lipase - Conves IDL to LDL by hydrolysing the triglyceride content of IDL. Hormone sensitive lipase - Present intracellularly in peripheral tissue and causes intracellular lipolysis by hydrolysing triglycerides. Niacin (Nicotinic acid) inhibits intracellular lipolysis by inhibiting hormone sensitive lipase- intracellular FFA to liver- triglyceride synthesis. Niacin also increases the activity of lipoprotein lipase- T hydrolysis of VLDL triglyceride. Nicotinic acid also reduces the production of VLDL in liver by inhibiting TG-synthesis - indirectly the VLDL degradation products IDL and LDL are also reduced. Nicotinic acid is the most effective drug to raise HDL-CH. Increased HDL is due to interference of direct pathway of HDL cholesterol to liver which involves apo-A, - Niacin decreases apo-A, mediated hepatic clearance.

Mechanism of action In organophosphate poisoning esteratic site of cholinesterase is phosphorylated and anionic site is free. Phosphorylated cholinesterase reacts very slowly with water. However, if more reactive OH groups in the form of oximes are provided, reactivation occurs more than a million time faster. Oximes attach to anionic site and provide more reactive OH groups. Oximes are ineffective in Carbamates poisoning. Pralidoxime is contraindicated in carbamates poisoning, because not only it does not reactivate carbamylated enzyme, it has weak anti-chE activity of its own. Remember Obidoxime is more potent than pralidoxime. Pralidoxime and obidoxime are lipid insoluble, while diacetyl-monoxime (DAM) is lipid soluble so it can cross BBB and regenerate AChE in brain.
