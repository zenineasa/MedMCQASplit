Factors governing the volume of drug distribution:# Lipid: Water partition Co-efficient of the drug: Lipid insoluble drugs do not enter cells - V approximates extracellular fluid volume, e. g. streptomycin, gentamicin 0. 25L/kg.# p. Ka value of the drug.# Degree of plasma protein binding: The volume of distribution of drugs extensively bound to plasma proteins but not to tissue components approaches plasma volume (are largely restricted to the vascular compartment) and hence have low V values e. g. diclofenac and warfarin (99% bound) V = 0. 15L/kg.# Affinity for different tissues: By contrast, for drugs highly bound to tissues, the volume of distribution can be far greater than any physiologic space. Thus, drugs sequestrated in tissues may have, V much more than total body water or even body mass, e. g. digoxin 6 L/kg, propranolol 4L/kg, morphine 3. 5 L/kg, because most of the drug is present in other tissues and plasma concentration is low. Thus, in case of poisoning, drugs with large volume of distribution are not easily removed by hemodialysis.# Fat: lean body mass ratio, which can very with age, sex, obesity, etc.# Diseases like CHF, uremia, cirrhosis.

Small lipophilic molecules, especially if bound to tissue protein. Harrison's 17th edition, page 29............. DRUG DISTRIBUTIONIn a typical 70-kg human, plasma volume is ~3 L, blood volume is ~5. 5 L, and extracellular water outside the vasculature is ~42 L. The volume of distribution of drugs extensively bound to plasma proteins but not to tissue components approaches plasma volume; warfarin is an example. By contrast, for drugs highly bound to tissues, the volume of distribution can be far greater than any physiologic space. For example, the volume of distribution of digoxin and tricyclic antidepressants is hundreds of liters, obviously exceeding total-body volume. Such drugs are not readily removed by dialysis, an important consideration in overdose. Only when distribution is near-complete does the concentration of digoxin in plasma reflect pharmacologic effect. For this reason, there should be a 6-8 h wait after administration before plasma levels of digoxin are measured as a guide to therapy. Educational points. Clinical Implications of Altered Protein Binding. The acute-phase reactant? l-acid glycoprotein binds to basic drugs, such as lidocaine or quinidine, and is increased in a range of common conditions, including myocardial infarction, surgery, neoplastic disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and burns. This increased binding can lead to reduced pharmacologic effects at therapeutic concentrations of total drug. Conversely, conditions such as hypoalbuminemia, liver disease, and renal disease can decrease the extent of drug binding, particularly of acidic and neutral drugs, such as phenytoin. Here, plasma concentration of free drug is increased, so drug efficacy and toxicity are enhanced if total (free + bound) drug concentration is used to monitor therapy.",

Sometimes rapid achievement of desired plasma concentrations of drugs is needed to produce the prompt response (e. g. in serious infections or arrhythmias). When the time to reach steady state is long, as it is for drugs with long half-lives and having high volume of distribution (Vd) due to their tissue affinities, it may be desirable to administer a large dose (loading dose) to achieve the desired plasma levels rapidly. The volume ot distribution is the proportionality factor that relates the total amount of drug in the body to the concentration in the plasma (Cp). LOADING DOSE= Vd X Desired steady state plasma concentration. Loading dose can be given as single dose or multiple doses over a short time. E. g. in case of treatment of AF by digoxin (longer acting drug with high Vd), loading dose is must to saturate the tissues and to achieve desired plasma concentration rapidly (otherwise it would take about a week for digoxin to achieve the steady state plasma concentration). Loading dose of Chloroquine is also required to treat the malaria. On the other hand, maintenance dose is dependent of the clearance (Cl) as we have to maintain the steady state concentration in view of the volume of the plasma cleared of drug per unit time. Hence, equation for maintenance dose is. MAINTENANCE DOSE= Cl X Desired steady state plasma concentration",

        "exp": "D i. e. Dexmeditomidine. Ref: KDT, 7th edition, page 384. Explanation: Simple way to answer this is to ask, whether these are available as Transdermal patch. Scopolamine, Nitroglycerine and Clonidine are available as Transdermal patch because they can penetrate intact skin. Scopolamine is L-Hyoscine. Hyoscine: Most effective drug for motion sickness. Valuable in highly susceptible individuals and for vigorous motions. Drug should be given prophylactically (0. 2 mg oral), because administration after symptoms have set in is less effective; action lasts 4-6 hours. A transdermal preparation applied behind the pinna 4 hours before journey has been shown to protect for 3 days. Side effects with low oral doses and transdermal medication are few, but dry mouth and sedation can occur: driving is risky. Another anticholinergic used for motion sickness is Dicyclomine. Nitroglycerine: Sublingual route is used when terminating angina or aborting an imminent one is the aim. Cutaneous application as ointment was found to produce haemodynamic effects for 4-6 hours. A transdermal patch in which the drug is incorporated into a polymer bonded to adhesive plaster has been developed which provides steady delivery for 24 hours. It starts working within 60 min and has a bioavailability of 70-90%. However, development of tolerance and dependence may jeopardise its value. It is advised that the patch be taken off for 8 hours daily. A transmucosal dosage form which has to be stuck to the gums under the upper lip has also been produced--acts in 5 min and releases the drug for 4-6 hours. Clonidine: Isa partial agonist with high affinity and high intrinsic activity at a2 receptors, especially a2A subtype in brainstem. Also activates imidazoline receptors. Activation of medullary imidazoline receptors also causes decreased sympathetic outflow and fall in BP. Transdermal delivery patch permits continuous administration of clonidine as an alternative to oral therapy. The drug is released at an approximately constant rate for a week; 3-4 days are required to reach steady- state concentrations in plasma. When the patch is removed, plasma concentrations remain stable for ~8 hours and then decline gradually over a period of several days. Dexmeditomidine: Acts by stimulation of central a2 adrenergic receptors. Known to cause sedation and analgesia. Used for sedating critically ill/ventilated patients in intensive care units. Also being used as an adjunct to anaesthesia. Analgesia and sedation are produced with little respiratory depression, amnesia or anaesthesia. Sympathetic response to stress and noxious stimulus is blunted. It is administered by I. V. infusion.",

        "exp": "MICROSOMAL ENZYME INDUCTION Many drugs and carcinogens interact with DNA and increase the synthesis of microsomal enzyme protein, especially cytochrome P-450 and UGTs As a result rate of metabolism of inducing drug itself and/or other drugs is increased. Different inducers are relatively selective for ceain cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme families, e. g.: * Anticonvulsants (phenobarbitone, phenytoin, carbamazepine), rifampin, glucocoicoids induce CYP3A isoenzymes. * Phenobarbitone also induces CYP2. B1 and rifampin also induces CYP2. D6. * Isoniazid and chronic alcohol consumption induce CYP2. E1. * Polycyclic hydrocarbons like 3-methylcholanthrene and benzopyrene found in cigarette smoke, charcoalbroiled meat, omeprazole and industrial pollutants induce CYP1A isoenzymes. * Other impoant enzyme inducers are: phenylbutazone, griseofulvin, DDT. Consequences of microsomal enzyme induction 1. Decreased intensity and/or duration of action of drugs that are inactivated by metabolism, e. g. failure of contraception with oral contraceptives. 2. Increased intensity of action of drugs that are activated by metabolism. Acute paracetamol toxi-city is due to one of its metabolites--toxicity occurs at lower doses in patients receiving enzyme inducers. 3. Tolerance--if the drug induces its own metabolism (autoinduction), e. g. carbamazepine, rifampin. 4. Some endogenous substrates (steroids, bili rubin) are also metabolized faster. 5. Precipitation of acute intermittent porphyria: enzyme induction increases porphyrin synthesisby derepressing d-aminolevulenic acid synthetase. 6. Intermittent use of an inducer may interfere with adjustment of dose of another drug prescribed on regular basis, e. g. oral anticoagulants, oral hypoglycaemics, antiepileptics, antihypeensives.

Hence drugs given as watery solution is absorbed fasterthan when the drug is given in solid form. Concentration: Passive diffusion depends on concentrationgradient; drug given as concentrated solution is absorbedfaster than from dilute solution. Area of absorbing surface: Larger the area, faster theabsorption. Vascularity of the absorbing surface: Blood circulationremoves drug from site of absorption. Increased blood flow increases drug absorption. Route of administration: When a drug is given intramuscularly, the drug is deposited near the capillaries.

Post marketing detection of adverse reaction - several strategies exist to detect adverse reactions after marketing of a drug, but debate continues about the most efficient and effective method. Formal approaches for estimation of the magnitude of an adverse drug effect are the follow-up or \"cohort\" study of patients who are receiving a particular drug, the \"case control\" study where the potential for a drug to cause a particular disease is assessed, and meta-analysis of pre and post marketing (61-62-Goodman & Gillman's 10th)",
