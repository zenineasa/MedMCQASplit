Ka value of the drug.# Degree of plasma protein binding: The volume of distribution of drugs extensively bound to plasma proteins but not to tissue components approaches plasma volume (are largely restricted to the vascular compartment) and hence have low V values e. g. diclofenac and warfarin (99% bound) V = 0. 15L/kg.# Affinity for different tissues: By contrast, for drugs highly bound to tissues, the volume of distribution can be far greater than any physiologic space. Thus, drugs sequestrated in tissues may have, V much more than total body water or even body mass, e. g. digoxin 6 L/kg, propranolol 4L/kg, morphine 3. 5 L/kg, because most of the drug is present in other tissues and plasma concentration is low.

Small lipophilic molecules, especially if bound to tissue protein. Harrison's 17th edition, page 29............. DRUG DISTRIBUTIONIn a typical 70-kg human, plasma volume is ~3 L, blood volume is ~5. 5 L, and extracellular water outside the vasculature is ~42 L. The volume of distribution of drugs extensively bound to plasma proteins but not to tissue components approaches plasma volume; warfarin is an example. By contrast, for drugs highly bound to tissues, the volume of distribution can be far greater than any physiologic space. For example, the volume of distribution of digoxin and tricyclic antidepressants is hundreds of liters, obviously exceeding total-body volume. Such drugs are not readily removed by dialysis, an important consideration in overdose. Only when distribution is near-complete does the concentration of digoxin in plasma reflect pharmacologic effect. For this reason, there should be a 6-8 h wait after administration before plasma levels of digoxin are measured as a guide to therapy. Educational points. Clinical Implications of Altered Protein Binding. The acute-phase reactant? l-acid glycoprotein binds to basic drugs, such as lidocaine or quinidine, and is increased in a range of common conditions, including myocardial infarction, surgery, neoplastic disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and burns. This increased binding can lead to reduced pharmacologic effects at therapeutic concentrations of total drug. Conversely, conditions such as hypoalbuminemia, liver disease, and renal disease can decrease the extent of drug binding, particularly of acidic and neutral drugs, such as phenytoin. Here, plasma concentration of free drug is increased, so drug efficacy and toxicity are enhanced if total (free + bound) drug concentration is used to monitor therapy.",

Sometimes rapid achievement of desired plasma concentrations of drugs is needed to produce the prompt response (e. g. in serious infections or arrhythmias). When the time to reach steady state is long, as it is for drugs with long half-lives and having high volume of distribution (Vd) due to their tissue affinities, it may be desirable to administer a large dose (loading dose) to achieve the desired plasma levels rapidly. The volume ot distribution is the proportionality factor that relates the total amount of drug in the body to the concentration in the plasma (Cp). LOADING DOSE= Vd X Desired steady state plasma concentration. Loading dose can be given as single dose or multiple doses over a short time. E. g. in case of treatment of AF by digoxin (longer acting drug with high Vd), loading dose is must to saturate the tissues and to achieve desired plasma concentration rapidly (otherwise it would take about a week for digoxin to achieve the steady state plasma concentration). Loading dose of Chloroquine is also required to treat the malaria. On the other hand, maintenance dose is dependent of the clearance (Cl) as we have to maintain the steady state concentration in view of the volume of the plasma cleared of drug per unit time. Hence, equation for maintenance dose is. MAINTENANCE DOSE= Cl X Desired steady state plasma concentration",

Scopolamine, Nitroglycerine and Clonidine are available as Transdermal patch because they can penetrate intact skin. Scopolamine is L-Hyoscine. Hyoscine: Most effective drug for motion sickness. Valuable in highly susceptible individuals and for vigorous motions. Drug should be given prophylactically (0. 2 mg oral), because administration after symptoms have set in is less effective; action lasts 4-6 hours. A transdermal preparation applied behind the pinna 4 hours before journey has been shown to protect for 3 days. Side effects with low oral doses and transdermal medication are few, but dry mouth and sedation can occur: driving is risky. Another anticholinergic used for motion sickness is Dicyclomine. Nitroglycerine: Sublingual route is used when terminating angina or aborting an imminent one is the aim. Cutaneous application as ointment was found to produce haemodynamic effects for 4-6 hours. A transdermal patch in which the drug is incorporated into a polymer bonded to adhesive plaster has been developed which provides steady delivery for 24 hours. It starts working within 60 min and has a bioavailability of 70-90%. However, development of tolerance and dependence may jeopardise its value. It is advised that the patch be taken off for 8 hours daily. A transmucosal dosage form which has to be stuck to the gums under the upper lip has also been produced--acts in 5 min and releases the drug for 4-6 hours. Clonidine: Isa partial agonist with high affinity and high intrinsic activity at a2 receptors, especially a2A subtype in brainstem. Also activates imidazoline receptors. Activation of medullary imidazoline receptors also causes decreased sympathetic outflow and fall in BP. Transdermal delivery patch permits continuous administration of clonidine as an alternative to oral therapy. The drug is released at an approximately constant rate for a week; 3-4 days are required to reach steady- state concentrations in plasma. When the patch is removed, plasma concentrations remain stable for ~8 hours and then decline gradually over a period of several days. Dexmeditomidine: Acts by stimulation of central a2 adrenergic receptors. Known to cause sedation and analgesia. Used for sedating critically ill/ventilated patients in intensive care units. Also being used as an adjunct to anaesthesia. Analgesia and sedation are produced with little respiratory depression, amnesia or anaesthesia. Sympathetic response to stress and noxious stimulus is blunted. It is administered by I. V. infusion.",

        "exp": "A drug that binds to the receptor at the same site as the agonist and produces an effo opposite to the agonist is termed as A reverse Agonist. Inverse/Reverse Agonist: is an agent that binds to the receptor as an agonist but induces an intrinsic response opposite to that of an agonist. A Competitive Antagonist: is an agent that binds to the same site as the agonist and induces no intrinsic response. (No intrinsic activity; does not activate). The antagonism is acheived because it blocks the action of the agonist. The antagonist effect is only observed if the agonist is also present (it cannot block the agonist effect if no agonist is present) Agonist Antagonist A drug that binds to and activates a receptor. Can be full, paial or Inverse. A Full Agonist has high efficacy, producing a full response while occupying a relatively low propoion of receptors A Paial Agonist has lower efficacy than a full agonist. It produces sub-maximal activation even when occupying the total receptor population, therefore cannot produce the maximal response, irrespective of the concentration applied. A paial antagonist antagonizes the action of a full agonist. An Inverse Agonist produces an effect opposite to that of an agonist, yet binds to the same receptor binding-site as an agonist. A drug that attenuates the effect of an agonist. Can be competitive or non-competitive, each of which can be reversible or irreversible A Competitive Antagonist binds to the same site as the agonist but does not activate it, thus blocks the agonist&; s action. A Non-competitive Antagonist binds to an allosteric (non-agonist) site on the receptor to prevent activation of the receptor. Any non-competitive inhibitor may thus also be termed as an Allosteric Inhibitor. A Reversible Antagonist binds non-covalently to the receptor, therefore can be \"washed out\" An Irreversible Antagonist binds covalently to the receptor and cannot be displaced by either completing ligands or washing Ref: KDT 7th edition",

        "exp": "MICROSOMAL ENZYME INDUCTION Many drugs and carcinogens interact with DNA and increase the synthesis of microsomal enzyme protein, especially cytochrome P-450 and UGTs As a result rate of metabolism of inducing drug itself and/or other drugs is increased. Different inducers are relatively selective for ceain cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme families, e. g.: * Anticonvulsants (phenobarbitone, phenytoin, carbamazepine), rifampin, glucocoicoids induce CYP3A isoenzymes. * Phenobarbitone also induces CYP2. B1 and rifampin also induces CYP2. D6. * Isoniazid and chronic alcohol consumption induce CYP2. E1. * Polycyclic hydrocarbons like 3-methylcholanthrene and benzopyrene found in cigarette smoke, charcoalbroiled meat, omeprazole and industrial pollutants induce CYP1A isoenzymes. * Other impoant enzyme inducers are: phenylbutazone, griseofulvin, DDT. Consequences of microsomal enzyme induction 1. Decreased intensity and/or duration of action of drugs that are inactivated by metabolism, e. g. failure of contraception with oral contraceptives. 2. Increased intensity of action of drugs that are activated by metabolism. Acute paracetamol toxi-city is due to one of its metabolites--toxicity occurs at lower doses in patients receiving enzyme inducers. 3. Tolerance--if the drug induces its own metabolism (autoinduction), e. g. carbamazepine, rifampin. 4. Some endogenous substrates (steroids, bili rubin) are also metabolized faster. 5. Precipitation of acute intermittent porphyria: enzyme induction increases porphyrin synthesisby derepressing d-aminolevulenic acid synthetase. 6. Intermittent use of an inducer may interfere with adjustment of dose of another drug prescribed on regular basis, e. g. oral anticoagulants, oral hypoglycaemics, antiepileptics, antihypeensives.

Eg: Oxidation: Eg - Hydroxylation (most important oxidation reaction) is by cytochrome P 450. Reduction. Hydrolysis. Phase II: It is also called synthetic or conjugation reaction. These reactions involve conjugation of the M drug or phase I metabolite with an endogenous substance to form a polar highly ionized and water soluble organic acid which is easily excreted in urine.* Eg - Glucuronide conjugation* Acetylation* Methylation* Sulfate conjugation* Glycine conjugation* Glutathione conjugation* Nucleotide synthesis After phase II reaction most of the metabolite become inactive (except morphine and minoxidil), so the (a) choice is partially correct.

Ka is the negative logarithm of acidic disassociation constant of the weak electrolyte, which is equivalent to the pH at which 50% drug is ionized and 50% is unionized. E. g. if a drug has p. Ka 3. 5, it means at pH 3. 5 it is 50% ionized and 50% unionized. pH=p. Ka+log Ionization is the process in which ions are formed from neutral compounds. pH is the measure of acidity. p. Ka of a drug is the measure of the acid strength (i. e., its tendency to dissociate) with reference to pH scale. Many drugs are weak acids or bases that are present in the solution as both ionized & non-ionised form. Drug ionization reduces a drug's ability to cross a lipid bilayer. The non-ionised molecules are lipid soluble and cross the membrane. The ionised molecules are water soluble and cannot cross the membrane. Amount of ionization depends on p. Ka (dissociation constant). For acids, the smaller the p. Ka, the more acidic the substance is (the more easily a proton is lost, thus the lower the pH). E. g. an acid with a p. Ka of 2 is 10 X as strong as an acid with p. Ka of 3. The basic strength of drugs increases with the p. Ka, a basic drug of p. Ka of 9 is 10X as strong as base with p. Ka 8. The relationship between pH, p. Ka and the extent of ionization is given by Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. WEAK ELECTROLYTES AND THE INFLUENCE OF p. HMany drugs are weak acids or bases that are present in solution as both the non-ionized & ionized species. Non-ionized molecules usually are more lipid soluble and can diffuse readily across the cell membrane. Ionized molecules usually are less able to penetrate the lipid membrane because of their low lipid solubility, & passage will depend on the leakiness of the membrane related to the membrane's electrical resistance. Transmembrane distribution of a weak electrolyte is influenced by its p. Ka and the pH gradient across the membrane. p.

        "exp": "Ans) a ( Inactive drug...) Ref Goodman and gilman ll'h ed, KDT 7\"1 ed, general pharmacology. Direct pick from KDTBiotrasformation means chemical alteration of drug in the body. lt is needed to render nonpolar compounds polar, so that they are not reabsorbed in the renal tubules and are excreated. The primary site for drug metabolism is liver; other are kidney, intestine, lungs and plasma. Biotransformation of drugs may lead to the following and are considered useful1. Inactivation of active drug metabolite2. Active metabolite from an active drug3. Activation of an inactive drug. So coversion of inactive drug to inactive metabolite is useless in biotransformation. Most metabolic biotransformations occur at some point between absorption of the drug into the general circulation and its renal elimination. A few transformations occur in the intestinal lumen or intestinal wall. In general, all of these reactions can be assigned to one of two major categories called phase I and phase II reactions. Phase I reactions usually convert the parent drug to a more polar metabolite by introducing or unmasking a functional group (-OH, -NH2, -SH). Often these metabolites are inactive, although in some instances activity is only modified or even enhanced. Some times phase I undergo a subsequent reaction in which an endogenous substrate such as glucuronic acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, or an amino acid combines with the newly incorporated functional group to form a highly polar conjugate. Such conjugation or synthetic reactions are the hallmarks of phase II metabolism. For example, the hydrazide moiety of isoniazid is known to form an /V-acetyl conjugate in a phase II reaction. This conjugate is then a substrate for a phase I type reaction, namely, hydrolysis to isonicotinic acid. Thus, phase II reactions may actually precede phase I reactions.",

The units for Volume of Distribution are typically reported in (ml or liter)/kg body weight. Therefore the dose required to give a certain plasma concentration can be determined if the VD for that drug is known. The VD is not a physiologic value; it is more a reflection of how a drug will distribute throughout the body depending on several physicochemical properties, e. g. solubility, charge, size, etc. For example, these are volume of distribution of some of the drugs. Warfarin - 8L - Reflects a high degree of plasma protein binding. Theophylline. Ethanol - 30L Represents distribution in total body water. Chloroquine -15000L Shows highly lipophilic molecules which sequester into total body fat. The apparent volume of distribution reflects a balance between binding to tissues, which decreases plasma concentration and makes the apparent volume larger, and binding to plasma proteins, which increases plasma concentration and makes the apparent volume smaller. Changes in either tissue or plasma binding can change the apparent volume of distribution determined from plasma concentration measurements. Older people have a relative decrease in skeletal muscle mass and tend to have a smaller apparent volume of distribution of digoxin (which binds to muscle proteins). The volume of distribution may be overestimated in obese patients if based on body weight and the drug does not enter fatty tissues well, as is the case with digoxin. In contrast, theophylline has a volume of distribution similar to that of total body water. Adipose tissue has almost as much water in it as other tissues, so that the apparent total volume of distribution of theophylline is proportional to body weight even in obese patients. Abnormal accumulation of fluid- edema, ascites, pleural effusion- can markedly increase the volume of distribution of drugs such as gentamicin that are hydrophilic and have small volumes of distribution.",
