Fab dose can be determined by two different methods. First method is based on the amount of digoxin ingested whereas the second method is based on the serum digoxin concentration and the weight of the person. Other treatment that may be used to treat life-threatening arrhythmias until Fab is acquired are magnesium, phenytoin, and lidocaine. Magnesium suppresses digoxin-induced ventricular arrhythmias while phenytoin and lidocaine suppresses digoxin-induced ventricular automaticity and delay afterdepolarizations without depressing AV conduction.

The reversal of this exchanger causes an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration that is available to the contractile proteins. Increased intracellular calcium lengthens phase 4 and phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, which leads to a decrease in heart rate. Increased amounts of Ca2+ also leads to increased storage of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing a corresponding increase in the release of calcium during each action potential.

It selectively binds to extracellular face of the membrane associated Na+K+ ATPase of myocardial fibres and inhibitis this enzyme.

During depolarization Ca2+ ions enter the cell driven by the steep Ca2+ gradient through voltage sensitive L type Ca2+ channels. This triggers release of larger amount of Ca2+ stored in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through Ryanodine calcium channel 2 (RYR2) - cytosolic Ca2+ increases transiently (calcium transients) - triggers contraction by activating troponin C on myofibrils.

Sacubitril is also undergoing clinical testing for its role in the treatment of hypertension. Neprilysin (NEP) is an endopeptidase that metabolizes different vasoactive peptides especially natriuretic peptides including Atrial and Brain Natriuretic peptides thereby promoting diuresis, natriuresis and vasodilation. Sacubitril is a prodrug that once activated inhibits the enzyme Neprilysin, which is responsible for the degradation of atrial and brain natriuretic peptide. Sacubitril/Valsaan: Angiotensin Receptor blocker-Neprilysin Inhibitor (ARNI) combination: Sacubitril/Valsaan is a first-in-class medicine that contains a Neprilysin (NEP) inhibitor (Sacubitril) and an Angiotensin II (Ang-II) receptor blocker (Valsaan) Neprilysin(NEP) is an endopeptidase that metabolize different vasoactive peptides including natriuretic peptides, bradykinin and Ang-II. NEP substrates may have biological opposing action and the total effect of the inhibition depends on the net effect of the individual metabolized substrates. Neprilysin inhibition not only increases the levels of both, natriuretic peptides (promoting diuresis, natriuresis and vasodilatation) but also increases the level of Ang-II (producing an opposite action of vasoconstriction and aldosterone release) The benefits of increasing the Natriuretic peptides (NP) system may thus be lost by increasing Ang-II, therefore a simultaneous suppression of the RAAS is necessary. Addition of Valsaan (angiotensin receptor blocker) blocks the undesirable effects of Ang-II (thereby reducing the undesirable effects of vasoconstriction and aldosterone release) Consequently, the ARNI is expected to promote the beneficial effects natriuresis, diuresis and vasodilatation of aerial and venous blood vessels and to inhibit thrombosis, fibrosis, cardiac myocyte hyperophy, and renin release.

Selective blockade of If current by ivabradine results in heart rate reduction without any other electrophysiological or negative inotropic or negative lucitropic (slowing of myocardial relaxation) effect.
