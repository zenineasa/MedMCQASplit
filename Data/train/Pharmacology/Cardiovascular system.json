This antidote has been shown to be highly effective in treating life-threatening signs of digoxin toxicity such as hyperkalemia, hemodynamic instability, and arrhythmias. Fab dose can be determined by two different methods. First method is based on the amount of digoxin ingested whereas the second method is based on the serum digoxin concentration and the weight of the person. Other treatment that may be used to treat life-threatening arrhythmias until Fab is acquired are magnesium, phenytoin, and lidocaine. Magnesium suppresses digoxin-induced ventricular arrhythmias while phenytoin and lidocaine suppresses digoxin-induced ventricular automaticity and delay afterdepolarizations without depressing AV conduction.

These drugs have lost much of their clinical impoance because of their unourable side-effects (sedation, dry mouth, impotence), which are also mediated by alpha2-adrenoceptors, although in other anatomical regions. Moxonidine and rilmenidine are the examples of a new class of centrally acting antihypeensives, which cause peripheral sympathoinhibition mediated by imidazoline (I1)-receptors in the rostral ventromedulla (RVLM). Their side-effect profile appears to be better than that of clonidine and alpha-methyl-DOPA, probably because of a weaker affinity for alpha2-adrenoceptors. The mode of action, haemodynamic profile, antihypeensive efficacy and adverse reactions of the classic and newer centrally acting antihypeensives are the subject of the present survey.

The most consistent action of verapamil is prolongation of A-V nodal ERP. As a result A-V conduction is markedly slowed (P-R interval increases) and reentry involving A-V node is terminated.

The reversal of this exchanger causes an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration that is available to the contractile proteins. Increased intracellular calcium lengthens phase 4 and phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, which leads to a decrease in hea rate. Increased amounts of Ca2+ also leads to increased storage of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing a corresponding increase in the release of calcium during each action potential.

Venodilators, such as nitrates, decrease ventricular filling pressures by redistributing blood so that more is pooled in peripheral veins. Vasodilators that produce both effects (nitro-prusside, prazosin, captopril, for example) are usually helpful in sho-term improvement of hemodynamics. Long-term treatment with nonparenteral vasodilators often reduces symptoms and increases exercise tolerance, although there is inconclusive evidence regarding the effects of these agents on moality. In acute myocardial infarction, intravenous vasodilators frequently improve cardiac performance. Evidence regarding their beneficial effects on infarct size and immediate moality is encouraging but inconclusive.

But when rapid control of the ventricular rate is required to arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, a slow infusion of verapamil is the agent of choice. In general, verapamil may be added to digoxin or given intravenously while a digoxin effect is awaited, unless there is digitalis toxicity. In digitalis toxicity, lignocaine remains the agent of choice for ventricular arrhythmias, and is given in the same doses as for acute myocardial infarction; phenytoin is used for digitalis-arrhythmias with A-V block. Verapamil may be infused very cautiously for digitalis-induced supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. The use of oral agents such as quinidine, disopyramide and mexilitene for chronic prophylaxis of ventricular ectopic beats is of doubtful effectiveness, unless the ectopic activity is symptomatic. Serious ventricular arrhythmias may be induced by quinidine and disopyramide. Beta-blockade is especially useful for ectopic beats associated with anxiety, or when arrhythmias are associated with angina of effo or hypeension. As always, major contraindications to the use of beta-blockade include cardiomegaly, hea failure or asthma",

        "exp": "Sacubitril is a prodrug Neprilysin inhibitor approved for the treatment of hea failure in conjunction with the Angiotensin Receptor Blockade, Valsaan(Sacubitril/Valsaan). Sacubitril is also undergoing clinical testing for its role in the treatment of hypeension. Neprilysin (NEP) is an endopeptidase that metabolizes different vasoactive peptides especially natriuretic peptides including Atrial and Brain Natriuretic peptides thereby promoting diuresis, natriuresis and vasodilation. Sacubitril is a prodrug that once activated inhibits the enzyme Neprilysin, which is responsible for the degradation of atrial and brain natriuretic peptide. Sacubitril/Valsaan: Angiotensin Receptor blocker-Neprilysin Inhibitor (ARNI) combination: Sacubitril/Valsaan is a first-in-class medicine that contains a Neprilysin (NEP) inhibitor (Sacubitril) and an Angiotensin II (Ang-II) receptor blocker (Valsaan) Neprilysin(NEP) is an endopeptidase that metabolize different vasoactive peptides including natriuretic peptides, bradykinin and Ang-II. NEP substrates may have biological opposing action and the total effect of the inhibition depends on the net effect of the individual metabolized substrates. Neprilysin inhibition not only increases the levels of both, natriuretic peptides (promoting diuresis, natriuresis and vasodilatation) but also increases the level of Ang-II (producing an opposite action of vasoconstriction and aldosterone release) The benefits of increasing the Natriuretic peptides (NP) system may thus be lost by increasing Ang-II, therefore a simultaneous suppression of the RAAS is necessary. Addition of Valsaan (angiotensin receptor blocker) blocks the undesirable effects of Ang-II (thereby reducing the undesirable effects of vasoconstriction and aldosterone release) Consequently, the ARNI is expected to promote the beneficial effects natriuresis, diuresis and vasodilatation of aerial and venous blood vessels and to inhibit thrombosis, fibrosis, cardiac myocyte hyperophy, and renin release.

The resulting inward current (If) determines the slope of phase 4 depolarization. Selective blockade of If current by ivabradine results in hea rate reduction without any other electrophysiological or negative inotropic or negative lucitropic (slowing of myocardial relaxation) effect. Hea rate reduction decreases cardiac O2 demand and prolongation of diastole tends to improve myocardial perfusion (O2 supply).

Medical useEdit Irregular heabeatEdit The most common indications for digoxin are atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, though beta blockers and/or calcium channel blockers are often preferred. There is tentative evidence that digoxin may increase the risk of death, though another meta-analysis in 2015 repoed no change in moality. Hea failureEdit Digoxin is no longer the first choice for hea failure; it has fallen out of or in people with hea failure because it may increase the risk of death. Currently, the recommendation for hea failure is a triple therapy of ACE inhibitor, beta blocker and mineralocoicoid antagonists. Digoxin is a third-line therapy. AboionEdit Digoxin is also used intrafetally or amniotically during aboions in the late second trimester and third trimester of pregnancy. It typically causes fetal demise(measured by cessation of cardiac activity) within hours of administration. Side effectsEdit Main aicle: List of side effects of digoxin Fuher information: Digoxin toxicity The occurrence of adverse drug reactions is common, owing to its narrow therapeutic index (the margin between effectiveness and toxicity). Gynaecomastia (enlargement of breast tissue) is mentioned in many textbooks as a side effect, thought to be due to the estrogen-like steroid moiety of the digoxin molecule, but when systematically sought, the evidence for this is equivocal as of 2005. The combination of increased (atrial) arrhythmogenesis and inhibited atrioventricular (AV) conduction (for example paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with AV block - so-called \"PAT with block\") is said to be pathognomonic(that is, diagnostic) of digoxin toxicity.",
