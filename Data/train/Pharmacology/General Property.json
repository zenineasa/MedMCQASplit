Time dependent effect# Action depends on length of time concentration remains above MIC, e.g. for macrolides fi-lactam. clindamycin, linezolid, tetracycline, and streptogramin.2. Concentration dependent effect# Action is dependent on peak concentration of drug, e.g. for aminoglyco-sides, quinolones, daptomycin, and metronidazole.o Post-antibiotic effect (PAE) is persistent suppression of microbial growth that occurs after levels of antibiotic have fallen below MIC.
