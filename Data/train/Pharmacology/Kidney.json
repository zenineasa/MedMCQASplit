Adverse effects:- The side effects are drowsiness, ataxia, mental confusion, epigastric distress and loose motions. Spironolactone interacts with progestin and androgen receptors as well.

This Na+ entry paially depolarizes the luminal membrane creating a -15 mV transepithelial potential difference which promotes secretion of K+ into the lumen through K+ channels. Though there is no direct coupling between Na+ and K+ channels, more the delivery of Na+ to the distal nephron--greater is its entry through the Na+ channel--luminal membrane is depolarized to a greater extent--driving force for K+ secretion is augmented. As such, all diuretics acting proximally (loop diuretics, thiazides, CAse inhibitors) promote K+ secretion. Amiloride and triamterene block the luminal Na+ channels and indirectly inhibit K+ excretion( Pottasium sparing diuretic). side effects:- Nausea, diarrhoea and headache. Uses:- Amiloride blocks entry of Li+ through Na+ channels in the CD cells and mitigates diabetes insipidus induced by lithium.

Carbonic anhydrase thus functions in CO2 and HCO3 - transpo and in H+ ion secretion. The enzyme is present in renal tubular cell (especially PT) gastric mucosa, exocrine pancreas, ciliary body of eye, brain and RBC. Acetazolamide:- Mech of action:- It is a sulfonamide derivative which noncompetitively but reversibly inhibits CAse (type II) in PT cells resulting in slowing of hydration of CO2 ->decreased availability of H+ to exchange with luminal Na+ through the Na+-H+ antipoer. Inhibition of brush border CAse (type IV) retards dehydration of H2CO3 in the tubular fluid so that less CO2 diffuses back into the cells. The net effect is inhibition of HCO3 - (and accompanying Na+) reabsorption in PT. However, the resulting alkaline diuresis is only mild (maximal fractional Na+ loss 5%), because pa of the Na+ (but not HCO3 - ) rejected in the PT is reabsorbed at the high capacity AscLH. The urine produced under acetazola mide action is alkaline and rich in HCO3 - which is matched by both Na+ and K+. Continued action of acetazolamide depletes body HCO3 - and causes acidosis.
