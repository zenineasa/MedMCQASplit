The main effects attributable to lithium are increased cardiac malformation in the fetus especially \"Ebsteins anomaly\". Lithium may increase the incidence of Ebstein9s anomaly in fetus but it is not contraindicated during pregnancy. Lithium is not considered a major human teratogen and the risk for Ebstein's anomaly is only. 5% for babies whose mother takes lithium during pregnancy. Therefore lithium is not contraindicated during pregnancy. It is however advisable to perform a \"fetal echocardiography\" to exclude the possibilities of cardiac anomaly. Evaluation of studies on lithium in pregnancy shows that lithium therapy throughout pregnancy does not seem to increase the general rate of major anomalies and apparently add only a small risk for cardiovascular defects notably Ebstein's anomaly. It can be concluded that whenever lithium is the drug of choice in women with bipolar disorder, it may be continued even in pregnancy. Moreover it is advised not to discontinue lithium as it may subsequently lead to relapse of the disorder. In addition, pregnancy of lithium treated women should be considered high risk and therefore monitoring during pregnancy has to include \"fetal echocardiography\". Pregnancy interruption in lithium treated mothers can probably be considered only if severe cardiac anomaly is diagnosed. According to K. D. T. Lithium is contraindicated during pregnancy.

        "question": "Which of the following is a mood stabilizer?",
        "exp": "Ans: a (Lithium) Ref: Katzung, 10th ed, p 455. Lithium carbonate is often referred to as an \"antimanic\" drug, and is considered a \"mood-stabilizing\" agent because of its primary action of preventing mood swings in patients with bipolar affective (manic-depressive) disorder. Concentrations considered to be effective and acceptably safe are between 0. 6 and 1. 25 m. Eq/L. The range of 0. 9-1. 1 m. Eq/L isfavoured for treatment of acutely manic or hypomanic patients. Somewhat lower values (0. 6-0. 75 m. Eq/L) are considered adequate and are safer for long-term use for prevention of recurrent manic-depressive illness. Adverse Effects & Complications. Many adverse effects associated with lithium treatment occur at varying times after treatment is started. Some are harmless, but it is important to be alert to adverse effects that may signify impending serious toxic reactions. A. NEUROLOGIC AND PSYCHIATRIC ADVERSE EFFECTSTremor is one of the most common adverse effects of lithium treatment, and it occurs with therapeutic doses. Propranolol and atenolol, which have been reported to be effective in essential tremor, also alleviate lithium-induced tremor. Other reported neurologic abnormalities include choreoathetosis, motor hyperactivity, ataxia, dysarthria, and aphasia. Psychiatric disturbances at toxic concentrations are generally marked by mental confusion and withdrawal. Appearance of any new neurologic or psychiatric symptoms or signs is a clear indication for temporarily stopping treatment with lithium and close monitoring of serum levels. B. DECREASED THYROID FUNCTIONLithium probably decreases thyroid function in most patients exposed to the drug, but the effect is reversible or nonprogressive. Few patients develop frank thyroid enlar gement, and fewer still show symptoms of hypothyroidism. Although initial thyroid testing followed by regular- monitoring of thyroid function has been proposed, such procedures are not cost-effective. Obtaining a serum TSH concentration every 6-12 months, however, is prudent. C. NEPHROGENIC DIABETES INSIPIDUS AND OTHER RENAL ADVERSE EFFECTSPolydipsia and polyuria are common but reversible concomitants of lithium treatment, occurring at therapeutic serum concentrations. The principal physiologic lesion involved is loss of responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). Lithium-induced diabetes insipidus is resistant to vasopressin but responds to amiloride. An extensive literature has accumulated concerning other forms of renal dysfunction during long-term lithium therapy, including chronic interstitial nephritis and minimal-change glomerulopathy with nephritic syndrome. Some instances of decreased glomerular filtration rate have been encountered but no instances of marked azotemia or renal failure. Patients receiving lithium should avoid dehydration and the associated increased concentration of lithium in urine. Periodic tests of renal concentrating ability should be performed to detect changes. D. OEDEMAOedema is a common adverse effect of lithium treatment and may be related to some effect of lithium on sodium retention. Although weight gain may be expected in patients who become edematous, water retention does not account for the weight gain observed in up to 30% of patients taking lithium. E. CARDIAC ADVERSE EFFECTSThe bradycardia-tachycardia (\"sick sinus\") syndrome is a definite contraindication to the use of lithium because the ion further depresses the sinus node. T-wave flattening is often observed on ECG but is of questionable significance. F. USE DURING PREGNANCYRenal clearance of lithium increases during pregnancy and reverts to lower levels immediately after delivery. A patient whose serum lithium concentration is in a good therapeutic range during pregnancy may develop toxic levels following delivery. Special care in monitoring lithium levels is needed at these times. Lithium is transferred to nursing infants through breast milk, in which it has a concentration about one-third to one-half that of serum. Lithium toxicity in newborns is manifested by lethargy, cyanosis, poor suck and Moro reflexes, and perhaps hepatomegaly. An earlier report suggested an increase in the frequency of cardiac anomalies, especially Ebstein anomaly, in lithium babies. However, more recent data suggest that lithium carries a relatively low risk of teratogenic effects. G MISCELLANEOUS ADVERSE EFFECTSTransient acneiform eruptions have been noted early in lithium treatment. Some of them subside with temporary discontinuance of treatment and do not recur with its resumption. Folliculitis is less dramatic and probably occurs more frequently. Leukocytosis is always present during lithium treatment, probably reflecting a direct effect on leukopoiesis rather than mobilization from the marginal pool. This adverse effect has now become a therapeutic effect in patients with low leukocyte counts. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic and is butyrophenone derivative. The butyrophenones and congeners tend to be more potent and to have fewer autonomic effects but greater extrapyramidal effects.",

        "exp": "Ans: c (10/15 ) Ref: Katzung, 10th ed, p. 455. Surprised!!!? There is common consenses that option c was definitely 10/15andnot 10-15. Even though there is a chance that it was a typing error, going by basic mathematics the option (c) 10/15 = 0. 666. This definitely falls between the range 0. 6-1. 25 which is considered as the effective and safe concentration of lithium. The next best option might be a) 1 -5 m. Eq/L. LITHIUMLithium carbonate is often referred to as an \"antimaniac\" drug and is considered as a \"mood-stabilizing\" agent because of its primary action of preventing mood swings in patients with bipolar affective (manic- depressive) disorder. Concentrations considered to be effective and acceptably safe are between 0. 6 and 1. 25 m. Eq/L. The range of 0. 9-1. 1 m. Eq/L is favoured for treatment of acutelymanic or hypo manic patients. Somewhat lower values (0. 6-0. 75 m. Eq/L) are considered adequate and are safer for long-term use for prevention of recurrent manic-depressive illness. Adverse Effects & Complications of Lithium. 1) Neurological and psychiatric manifestations. Tremor is one of the most common adverse effects of lithium treatment. Treatment - propranolol. Appearance of any new neurologic or psychiatric symptoms or signs is a clear indication for temporarily stopping treatment with lithium and close monitoring of serum levels. 2) Decreased thyroid functions - reversible. Thyroid function test (TFT) should be done before starting the drug. 3) Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and other renal adverse effects. Due to loss of responsiveness to ant diuretic hormone (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). Lithium-induced diabetes insipidus is resistant to vasopressin but responds to amiloride. 4) Oedema. Oedema is a common adverse effect of lithium treatment and may be related to some effect of lithium on sodium retention. 5) Cardiac adverse effects. The bradycardia-tachycardia (\"sick sinus\") syndrome is a definite contraindication to the use of lithium because the ion further depresses the sinus node. 6) Use m pregnancy. Lithium is contraindicated during pregnancy. It causes fetal goiter, Ebteins anomaly etc. More recent data suggest that lithium carries a relatively low risk of teratogenic effects. 7. Miscellaneous adverse effects. Transient acneiform eruptions. Folliculitis. BRIDGE Leukocytosis is always present during lithium treatment (direct effect on leucopoiesis) - used therapeutically in patients with low leukocyte counts.",

The important point to emphasize about the treatment of Alcohol Withdrawl is that it is caused by the removal of a CNS depressant i. e. Alcohol. So the Withdrawl symptoms can be initially controlled by replacing alcohol with any other C. N. S. depressant drug and subsequently the dose of the C. N. S. depressant can be tapered. Most of the C. N. S. depressant drugs are effective but benzodiazepines have the highest margin of safety and lowest cost and are therefore the preferred class of drugs. Most clinicians use long acting benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam because short acting benzodiazepines can produce rapidly changing blood levels.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., m When used as an anaesthetic opioids may cause muscle rigidity. Opioid induced rigidity is characterized by increased muscle tone progressing at times to severe stiffness. When the rigidity increases and involves thoracic and abdominal muscle, it may impair ventilation. Rigidity of the abdominal and/or thoracic muscles was thought to underlie opioid induced impairment of spontaneous or controlled ventilation. The precise mechanism by which opioids can cause muscular rigidity is not clearly understood. Muscle rigidity is not due to direct action on muscle fibres because it can be decreased or prevented by pretreatment with muscle relaxants. In addition, opioid induced muscle rigidity is not associated with increase in creatinine kinase a finding suggesting that little or no muscle damage occurs during this period. Opioids do not have any significant effect on neuromuscular conduction and result in only minimal depression of monosynaptic reflexes associated with muscle stretch receptors. Some investigators have suggested that opioids produce rigidity by altering dopamine concentrations within the striatums of the brain. Rigidity may occur due to the result of stimulation of GABA ergic interneurons which can be blocked by lesion in the striatum. Continuous research and data seems to indicate that the main mechanism responsible for opioid induced muscle rigidity is stimulation of u receptors. Opioids appear to produce their physiological effects by binding to at least three types of opioid receptors the mu (m), delta (S) and Kappa (k) receptors. Muscle rigidity occurs after administration of supra analgesic doses of potent m preferring opioids. The present data demonstrates that whereas systemic opiate induced muscle rigidity is primarily due to the activation of central mu receptors, supraspinal delta and kappa receptors may attenuate this effect. Anaesthesia review by Michelle Bowman Howard states (p134). All opioids given in high doses may cause muscular rigidity. It is most likely related to m receptors in the caudate nucleus. It is more commonly seen with Fentanyl.",

Partial agonists of this receptor (buspirone, ipsapirone, gepirone) are useful as anti-anxiety drugs. 5-HT1B/1D (presynaptic receptor) cause constriction of cranial vessels and agonists at this receptor (sumatriptan, naratriptan) are useful for the treatment of acute migraine attacks. 5-HT2A/2C receptor is responsible for most of the direct actions of serotonin. Ketanserin and ritanserin are antagonists at this receptor and are useful as antihypertensive agents. Clozapine and risperidone are atypical antipsychotic agents that act through antagonistic activity at this receptor. 5-HT3 receptor is an ionotropic receptor (other 5 HT receptors are GPCRs) and mediates most of the reflex and indirect actions of serotonin. Stimulation of this receptor is responsible for vomiting induced by anticancer drugs. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists like ondansetron are the drug of choice for chemotherapy induced vomiting. 5-HT4 receptor is present in GIT and is responsible for increase in peristalsis.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e. 5 HTIB/ID Triptans are new class of antimigrane drugs that act by safe actively activating serotonin receptor (5-HT IB/ID). Serotonin (5 Hydroxytryptamine (5 HT)) is a potent depolarizer of nerve endings and mediates various physiological action in the body. But serotonin has no application as drug. However several drugs act on various receptor subtypes of serotonin and are effective in various diseases. Serotonin mediates its action through following receptors: 5-HT15 HT1. A5. HTIb/Id, 5. HT2. A5-HT35-HT4. The Triptans act on 5 HTIB/m receptor of the serotonin. The 5-HT] receptor is localized to the brain and is classified into two types 5. HT1a - present in raphe nuclei 5. HTib/id - constricts cranial blood vessels. Triptans are selective activators of 5-HTIB/ID receptor. The selective activation of 5. HT1B/1D receptor results in vasoconstriction of cranial vessels. This relieves migraine as migraine is believed to be caused by the dilatation of extracerebral cranial blood flow. Dilation of blood vessels during migraine attack is believed to divert blood away from the brain parenchyma. Triptans also inhibit the release of vasodilating peptides and antiseizure agents. Sumatriptan and its congeners are currently the first line therapy for acute severe migraine attacks in most patients. The efficacy of Triptan 5-HT1B/1D agonist in migraine is equal to or greater than that of other acute drug treatments e. g. alkaloid. More on triptans * All these drugs are given orally. They are contraindicated in patients with coronary artery disease because they can cause coronary vasospasm (chest discomfort occurs in 1-5% of patients). Although the pharmacological mechanism of the Triptans is similar, their pharmacokinetic properties are distinct: Bioavailability of Triptan ranges from 14% sumatriptan to 74% naratriptan. Half life of ranges from 2 hours for sumatriptan to 25 hours for rovatriptan.",

Drugs active at the benzodiazepine receptor may be divided into four categories based on their elimination half-lives:(1) Ultra short acting: Midazolam(2) Short acting (t]/2 <6 hours): Triazolam, the nonbenzodiazepine zolpidem (t1/2 =2 hours) and zopiclone (t1/2 = 5-6 hours). (3) Intermediate-acting (t1/2 = 6-24 hours): Estazolam and temazepam. (4) long-acting (t1/2 >24 hours): Flurazepam, diazepam, and quazepam. Flurazepam has the longest half life of 50-100 hrs.",

KD Tripathi, Pharmacology/6th. 453)# Tramadol is synthetic centrally acting opioid analgesic having modest affinity for ji receptors.# Unlike other opioids, it inhibits reuptake of NA and 5-HT and thus activates monoaminergic spinal inhibition of pain.# Its oral bioavailability is good and it has minimal hemodynamic effects and hence safer in patients with compromised CVS function.# It is indicated for medium intensity short lasting pain due to diagnostic procedures, injury, surgery, etc as well as for chronic cancer pain.",
