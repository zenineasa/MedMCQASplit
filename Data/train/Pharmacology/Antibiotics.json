It binds to the terminal dipeptide 'D-ala-D-ala' sequence of peptidoglycan units-- prevents its release from the bactoprenol lipid carrier so that assembly of the units at the cell membrane and their cross linking to form the cell wall cannot take place. pharmacokinetics:- Vancomycin is not absorbed orally. After i. v. administration, it is widely distributed, penetrates serous cavities, inflamed meninges and is excreted mainly unchanged by glomerular filtration with a t 1/2 of 6 hours.

Skin allergy and fall in BP during i. v. injection can occur. Vancomycin has the potential to release histamine by direct action on mast cells.

This active metabolite attains much higher concentration inside CMV infected cells. The precursor cells in bone marrow are also quite sensitive to ganciclovir, and this may account for its bone marrow toxicity.

Systemic toxicity:- Toxicity of ganciclovir is high: bone marrowdepression, rash, fever, vomiting, neuropsychiatric disturbances. uses:- Use is restricted to prophylaxis and treatment of severe CMV infections (pneumonia/colitis/retinitis) in immunocompromised (AIDS, transplant recipient)patients.

        "exp": "POLYENE ANTIBIOTICS Amphotericin B (AMB) Mech of action:- The polyenes have high affinity for ergosterol present in fungal cell membrane. They combine with it, get inseed into the membrane and several polyene molecules together orient themselves in such a way as to form a 'micropore'. The hydrophilic side forms the interior of the pore through which ions, amino acids and other water-soluble substances move out. The micropore is stabilized by membrane sterols which fill up the spaces between the AMB molecules on the lipophilic side--constituting the outer surface of the pore. Thus, cell permeability is markedly increased. Ref:- kd tripathi; pg num:-787",

Thymidylic acid is a component of DNA. 5-FC is a narrow spectrum fungistatic, active against Cryptococcus neoformans, Torula, Chromoblastomyces; and a few strains of Candida. Adverse effects:- Toxicity of 5-FC consists of dose-dependent bone marrow depression and gastrointestinal disturbances, paicularly enteritis and diarrhoea. Liver dysfunction is mild and reversible.

Entecavir is an HBV nucleoside analog that only weak/paial HIV activity and is not preferred for use against HIV as it can induce HIV resistance. Designated drugs that have sufficient dual-activity against both HIV and HBV, and hence should be used in HBV-HIV-Co-Infected persons to provide effective treatment also against HIV: Emtrictrabine(FTC) Lamivudine(3. TC) Tenofovir (Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) and Tenofovir Alfenamide (TAF) Entecavir (+/-) TAF is a Tenofovir prodrug with HBV activity and potentially less renal and bone toxicities than TDF. Entecavir: Entecavir is a guanosine analogue that is highly potent against HBV and has weak/paial activity against HIV. It is typically not preferred for use against HIV as it can induce HIV Resistance. When Entecavir is used to treat HBV in patients with HBV/HIV coinfection who are not on A, the drug may select for the M184V mutation that confers HIV resistance to 3. TC and FTC. Therefore, Entecavir should only be used in HBV/HIV coinfected patient in addition to (and should not replace components of) fully suppressive A. It should be used as an add-on-drug to also treat HBV in cases only where the other drugs used in A have insufficient HBV activity. Ref: Goodman and Gilman 13th edition",
