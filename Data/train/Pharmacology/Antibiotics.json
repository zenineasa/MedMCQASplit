It binds to the terminal dipeptide 'D-ala-D-ala' sequence of peptidoglycan units-- prevents its release from the bactoprenol lipid carrier so that assembly of the units at the cell membrane and their cross linking to form the cell wall cannot take place. pharmacokinetics:- Vancomycin is not absorbed orally. After i. v. administration, it is widely distributed, penetrates serous cavities, inflamed meninges and is excreted mainly unchanged by glomerular filtration with a t 1/2 of 6 hours. Dose reduction is needed in renal insufficiency. Toxicity:- Systemic toxicity of vancomycin is high. It can cause plasma concentration dependent nerve deafness which may be permanent. Kidney damage is also dose-related. Other oto- and nephrotoxic drugs like aminoglycosides must be very carefully administered when vancomycin is being used. Skin allergy and fall in BP during i. v. injection can occur. Vancomycin has the potential to release histamine by direct action on mast cells. Rapid i. v. injection has caused chills, fever, uicaria and intense flushing-- called 'Red man syndrome'.

This active metabolite attains much higher concentration inside CMV infected cells. The precursor cells in bone marrow are also quite sensitive to ganciclovir, and this may account for its bone marrow toxicity. Pharmacokinetics:- It has poor oral absorption, bioavailability of ganciclovir is low (<10%). Valganciclovir, the valyl prodrug, has ~ 8 times higher bioavailability, and is preferred, where available. Ganciclovir and its active metabolite are mostly excreted unchanged in urine. The plasma t 1/2 of ganciclovir is 2-4 hrs, but that of its triphosphate inside CMV infected cells is > 24 hrs. These factors account for its high activity against CMV infections. Systemic toxicity:- Toxicity of ganciclovir is high: bone marrowdepression, rash, fever, vomiting, neuropsychiatric disturbances. uses:- Use is restricted to prophylaxis and treatment of severe CMV infections (pneumonia/colitis/retinitis) in immunocompromised (AIDS, transplant recipient)patients. Treatment may be initiated with i. v. infusion of ganciclovir 10 mg/kg/day which can prevent blindness in AIDS patients with CMV retinitis. Ref:- kd tripathi; pg num:-801",
