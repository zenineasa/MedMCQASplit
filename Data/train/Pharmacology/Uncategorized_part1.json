Colchicine reduces the inflammation caused by the urate crystals by inhibiting leukocyte migration and phagocytosis secondary to an effect on microtubule assembly. Allopurinol and its metabolite, oxypurinol, inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that forms uric acid from hypoxanthine. Therapy with this agent should be begun 1-2 weeks after the acute attack has subsided. Aspirin competes with uric acid for tubular secretion, thereby decreasing urinary urate excretion and raising serum uric acid levels. At high doses (more than 2 gm daily) aspirin is a uricosuric. Probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are uricosuric agents, increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid, hence decreasing serum levels of the substance.

A: Sodium Nitroprusside Antihypeensive therapy in acute aoic dissection aims specifically to lessen pulsatile load or aoic stress, in order to retard the propagation of the dissection and prevent aoic rupture. The goals of treatment are to prevent myocardial ischemia, decrease left ventricular afterload, decrease myocardial oxygen consumption, and prevent rupture and bleeding from suture lines Nitroprusside is a potent direct aerial and venous dilator, acting through release of nitric oxide. It has a rapid onset of action, and a shoer half-life and thus is given in the form of continuous infusion. The hypotensive effects of nitroprusside can be unpredictable because it simultaneously causes potent venodilatation and peripheral aerial vasodilatation. This is especially the case for patients with severe left ventricular hyperophy and preload-dependent diastolic dysfunction. It has been shown to cause coronary steal; it can cause a significant reflex tachycardia, and it can decrease oxygen circulation. It is photosensitive, so it requires special handling. Its most serious adverse effect is in the form of cyanide toxicity, which occurs due to accumulation of its metabolites thiocyanate/ cyanide and its clinical presentation may vary leading to difficulty in diagnosis. Thus, it is recommended that this drug be used only when other intravenous antihypeensive agents are not available",

        "exp": "Ans. C: Valproate Sodium valproate is effective in absence/petit-mal seizures, combined grand mal and petit mal, myoclonic epilepsy, paial epilepsy, maniac depressive psychosis and as a prophylactic in febrile convulsion Absence seizures/Petit mal seizures (from the French for \"little illness\", a term dating from the late 18th century). Absences seizures are brief (usually less than 20 seconds), generalized epileptic seizures of sudden onset and termination. They have 2 essential components: - Clinically the impairment of consciousness (absence) - EEG generalized spike-and-slow wave discharges Absence seizures are broadly divided in typical and atypical absence seizures. Typical absence seizures usually occur in the context of idiopathic generalised epilepsies and EEG shows fast >2. 5 Hz generalised spike-wave discharges. Atypical absence seizures: - Occur only in the context of mainly severe symptomatic or cryptogenic epilepsies of children with learning difficulties who also suffer from frequent seizures of other types such as atonic, tonic and myoclonic - Onset and termination is not so abrupt and changes in tone are more pronounced - Ictal EEG is of slow less than 2. 5 Hz spike and slow wave. - The discharge is heterogeneous, often asymmetrical and may include irregular spike and slow wave complexes, fast and other paroxysmal activity. - Background interictal EEG is usually abnormal. Treatment of patients with absence seizures only is mainly with sodium valproate or ethosuximide, which are of equal efficacy controlling absences in around 75% of patients. Sodium valproate as a single drug is the DOC if tonic clonic seizures are also present or emerge during the therapy with ethosuximide Lamotrigine monotherapy is less effective with nearly half of the patients becoming seizure free.",

However, when pain has become severe-larger doses are needed and control may be achieved only after few hours. Oral/sublingual route is preferred. 1 mg is given at half hour intervals till relief is obtained or a total of 6 mg is given. Parenteral administration, though rapid in action is more hazardous. Ergotamine acts by constricting the dilated cranial vessels and/or by specific constriction of carotid A-V shunt channels. Ergotamine and DHE have also been shown to reduce neurogenic inflammation and leakage of plasma in duramater that occurs due to retrograde stimulation of periascular afferent nerves. These actions appear to be mediated through partial agonism at 5-HTID/IB receptors in and around cranial vessels.

        "exp": "Epinephrine is a non selective adrenergic agonist and a valuable resuscitative drug because of its effects at multiple adrenergic receptor subtypes. In the treatment of anaphylaxis, epinephrine increases myocardial contractility, accelerates heart rate, causes constriction of vascular smooth muscle, and causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. The principal pharmacologic effects of epinephrine that are beneficial in anaphylaxis are mediated: alpha-1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle, resulting in vasoconstriction, beta-1 receptors in the hea, resulting in increased contractility, and beta-2 receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, resulting in relaxation and relief of bronchoconstriction. (One simple mnemonic for the respective locations of beta1 and beta2 receptors is \"one hea, two lungs. \") Beta-2 receptors are also found, however, in vascular smooth muscle (especially in skeletal muscle beds), were, just as in bronchial smooth muscle, they promote relaxation. (Epinephrine dilates skeletal muscle vascular beds to maximize oxygen delivery for the \"fight-or-flight\" response.) The resulting vasodilation in skeletal muscle vascular beds would, by itself, tend to decrease blood pressure, which might tend to worsen the effects of anaphylactic shock, but this effect is mitigated by the intense alpha-1 receptor stimulation, causing vasoconstriction in multiple beds. The principal action of alpha-2 receptors is at the presynaptic nerve terminal, where receptor stimulation reduces the release of norepinephrine from the nerve terminal. Epinephrine does stimulate these receptors, but it does not really contribute to the beneficial actions of epinephrine in resuscitation. Alpha-2 receptors are not located in the hea (except at presynaptic nerve terminals), alpha-2 receptors do not have a significant beneficial effect in resuscitation, and beta-1 receptors are not located in bronchial smooth muscle, but are located in the hea. Beta-1 receptors are located in the hea, not in bronchial smooth muscle. The adrenergic receptor that produces bronchial smooth muscle relaxation is beta-2. Alpha-2 receptors are located primarily at presynaptic nerve terminals, and because the beta-2 receptors in vascular smooth muscle cause vasodilation, this not a helpful effect of epinephrine in this case. Also Know: Epinephrine is indicated for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions and acute asthma exacerbations. It is considered a first-line agent in the treatment of cardiac arrest (i. e., pulseless ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity). Epinephrine also causes bronchodilation and antagonizes the effects of histamine. Epinephrine significantly increases myocardial oxygen consumption and thus can exacerbate ventricular irritability in the setting of myocardial ischemia. Extravasation causes necrosis and sloughing, and requires prompt infiltration of the affected area with phentolamine. Ref: Miller B. A., Clements E. A. (2011). Chapter 24.

It is given by subcutaneous route & used in type 2 DM Nausea is most impoant side effect. Sitagliptin This is orally active inhibitor of DPP-4. It prevents degradation of endogenous GLP-1 and other incretins, potentiating their action, resulting in limitation of postprandial hyperglycemia. It is used in type 2 DM. Other DPP-4 inhibitor is vildagliptin Pramlintide This is a synthetic amylin analogue (Amylin is a polypeptide produced by pancreatic (3-cells which reduces glucagon secretion from a-cells and delays gastric emptying). Pramlintide attenuates postprandial hyperglycemia and exes a centrally mediate anorectic action. o It is given by subcutaneous route and is used in both Type 1 and Type 2 DM. Glucomannan This is powdered extract from tuber of konjar. It is promoted as a dietary adjunct for diabetes. It swells in stomach by absorbing water and is claimed to reduce appetite, blood sugar, serum lipids and relieve constipation. Bromocriptine Recently bromocriptine has been approved by FDA, as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 DM. It has been found that dopamine alter insulin resistance by acting on hypothalmus and bromocriptine blocks O2 receptors.",

C: Ulcerative Colitis The mainstay of drug therapy for mild and moderate ulcerative colitis is sulfasalazine and other aminosalicylic acid (ASA) compounds and coicosteroids Sulfasalazine It is a sulfa drug, a derivative of mesalazine (also called 5-aminosalicylic acid, or 5-ASA) Sulfasalazine is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It is also indicated for use in rheumatoid ahritis and used in other types of inflammatory ahritis (e. g. psoriatic ahritis) where it has a beneficial affect. It is often well tolerated compared to other DMARDS. It is usually not given to children under 2 years of age. It yields the metabolite sulfapyridine which gives rise to side-effects such as agranulocytosis and hypospermia. The other metabolite of sulfasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is attributed to the drug's therapeutic effect. Therefore, 5-ASA and other derivatives of 5-ASA, are now usually preferred and given alone (as mesalazine), despite their increased cost, due to their more ourable side-effect profile. Sulfasalazine, and its metabolite 5-ASA, are poorly absorbed from the gut.",

        "exp": "It is a monoclonal antibody produced by injecting HER-2 antigen; 'cl' i. e., The protein HER2/NEU is expressed in increased amount by breast cancer cells Cancer cells express ceain antigen on their surface. These antigens can be made the target of chemotherapies. Specific antibodies have been developed against these cell surface receptors. Because the antibodies were produced from one cell that was grown into a clone of identical cells it is called monoclonal antibody. These antibodies were originally developed as mice antibody but because human have immune reactions to mouse proteins, these antibodies are usually chimerized or humanized when used as therapeutic reagents. i. e., the antibodies have both human and mouse component. These antibodies kill the cells by following mechanism:? - Antibody dependent cellular toxicity - Complement dependent cytotoxicity - Diret induction of apoptosis However, the clinically relevant mechanism still remains unceain. Herceptin (Trastuzumab) Herceptin is a humanized antibody and is used in breast cancers which are HER2 positive. (Major poion of it is composed of human component and a small pa is composed of mouse protein). HER2 stands for --4 human epidermal growth factor receptor. HER2 gene produces HER2 protein also called HER2 receptor. The HER2 protein is found on the surface of some normal cells in the body. In normal cells HER2 protein help send growth signals from outside the cell to the inside of the cell. These signals tell the cell to grow and divide. In HER2 (+ve) breast cancer the cancer cells have abnormally high number of HER2 genes per cell when this happens too much HER2 protein appears on the surface of these cancer cells. This is called HER2 protein over expression. Too much HER2 protein is thought to cause cancer cells to grow and divide uncontrollably. Herceptin acts in two ways a) Herceptin attaches to HER2+ cancer cells and stimulates the bodys immune system to target the HER2+ cancer cells b) Herceptin attaches itself to the HER2 receptors on the surface and blocks them from receiving the signals. Herceptin also acts by antibody dependent cell c) mediated cytotoxicity. We are not sure if it is increased antibody response Uses of Herceptin (trastuzumab) Currently transtuzumab is approved for HER2/ neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer in combination with paclitaxel as initial treatment or as monotherapy following chemotherapy.",

Unpredictably, severe myelosuppression with pemetrexed, seen especially in patients with pre-existing homocysteinemia and possibly reflecting folate deficiency, is largely eliminated by concurrent administration of low dosages of folic acid, 350-1000 mg/day, beginning 1-2 weeks prior to pemetrexed and continuing while the drug is administered.

Diazoxide prevents smooth muscle contraction and relaxes the aerioles Diazoxide is a potassium channel activator which causes local relaxation in smooth muscle by increasing membrane permeability to potassium ions. This switches off voltage gated calcium ion channel which inhibits the generation of action potential. When used as an intravenous antihypeensive agent diazoxide causes excessive hypotension. Diazoxide was formerlyused as an intravenous bolus dose for the at of hypeensive emergencies. But the dangers of excessive hypotension are now recognized to outweigh the benefit, and its emergency use is obsolete. Hypotension due to diazoxide has resulted in stroke and myocardial infarction. - The reflex sympathetic response due to hypotension can provoke angina, electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia and cardiac failure in patients with ischemic heart disease and diazoxide should be avoided in this situation. Diazoxide produces hyperglycemia by increasing insulin secretion, therefore it is used to treat various forms of hypoglycemia Diazoxide activates the same potassium channel in the pancreatic islet cells that is blocked by sulfonylureas. Sull. Onylureas close the potassium channels and increase insulin secretion whereas diazoxide opens the potassium channel in pancreatic islet cells and decrease insulin secretion. Due to its hyperglycemic action it is a useful drug for patients with chronic hypoglycemia from excess endogenous insulin secretion, either from an iselt cell tumour (insulinoma) or islet cell hyperplasia. According to Lawerence Diazoxide stimulates the ATP dependent r channel that is blocked by the sulphonylureas. Therefore its chronic use as an antihypeensive agent is precluded by the development of diabetes. Indeed its use in therapeutics should now be confined to rare indication of treating hypoglycemia due to islet cell tumour (insulinoma). Diazoxide is chemically related to thiazide diuretics. But in contrast to the structurally related thiazide diuretics, diazoxide causes renal salt and water retention.",

Thalidomide was chiefly sold during the late 1950s and early 1960s to pregnant women, as an antiemetic to combat morning sickness. Children were born with severe malformities, including phocomelia, because their mothers had taken thalidomide during pregnancy. Apa from its infamous tendency to induce bih defects and peripheral neuropathy, the main side effects of thalidomide include fatigue and constipation. It also is associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis especially when combined with dexamethasone, for treatment of multiple myeloma. In multiple myeloma patients, concomitant use with zoledronic acid may lead to increased incidence of renal dysfunction. High doses can lead to pulmonary oedema, atelectasis, aspiration pneumonia and refractory hypotension. It is very effective in dermatolgical conditions like: ENL, aphthous stomatitis, Behcet's disease, LE, and prurigo nodularis",

The primary noticeable difference of salmeterol to salbutamol is that the duration of action lasts approximately 12 hours in comparison with 4-6 hours of salbutamol. When used regularly every day as prescribed, inhaled salmeterol decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, like all LABA medications, it is not for use for relieving an asthma attack that has already staed.

Alkalinisation Alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate seems to have beneficial effect. Alkalinization correct hypotension and arrhythmias. The mechanism of this effect is a subject of debate. - It is believed that plasma protein binding of amitriptylline increases with a more alkaline pH. - The protein bound. form is inactive.

Arryhthmias In general antiarryhthmic agents should be avoided and the correction of hypoxia, hypotension, acidosis, hypokalemia should be done to reduce the cardiotoxic effects of tricyclics. Seizures Seizures are usually self limiting but where t/t is necessary benzodiazepenes are the t/t of choice. Cardiac arrest Prolonged resuscitation may be required.

Mechanism: Colchicine binds to tubulin and causing its depolymerization. This disrupts the mobility of granulocytes thereby decreasing its migration to the affected area. It also blocks cell division by binding to mitotic spindles. Uses: Colchicine is used in the treatment of acute gouty attacks as well as chronic gout. It is neither uricosuric nor an analgesic agent but it relieves pain in acute attacks of gout. It does not prevent progression of gout to acute gouty ahritis, but it has a suppressive, prophylactic effect that reduces the frequency of acute attacks and relieves pain.

(ii) Gastric lavage (gastric decontamination): Gastric lavage may be considered for potentially life threatening TCA overdoses only when it can be delivered within 1 hour of ingestion and the airway is protected.

Because trimethoprim is more lipid-soluble than sulfamethoxazole, it has a larger volume of distribution than the latter drug.

Right vagus mainly innervates SA node, right atrium and left vagus innervates left atrium, AV node, a bundle of His. But vagal innervation of the ventricle is sparse. Hence, vagal stimulation strongly inhibits heart rate (strong - negative chronotropic effect) and poorly affects the force of contraction (weak - negative inotropic effect). Moreover, vagus dominates sympathetic nerve in controlling SA node activity at rest. Therefore, basal heart rate mainly depends on the vagal tone. Ejection fraction, stroke volume, LVET (Left Ventricular Ejection Time) are mainly influenced by sympathetic stimulation as the vagus has a weaker inotropic effect.",

A: N-acetyl cysteine In paracetamol poisoning, depletion of hepatic and renal glutathione potentiates the toxicity whereas treatment with sulfhydryl compounds such as cysteamine, 1- methionine and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is beneficial Acetylcysteine/ N-acetylcysteine/ N-acetyl-L-cysteine/ NAC) It is used primarily as a mucolytic agent and in the management of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose. Other uses include sulfate repletion in conditions, such as autism, where cysteine and related sulfur amino acids may be depleted. Acetylcysteine is a derivative of cysteine; an acetyl group is attached to the nitrogen atom. It is used as a cough medicine because it breaks disulfide bonds in mucus and liquefies it, making it easier to cough up. It is also this action of breaking disulfide bonds that makes it useful in thinning the abnormally thick mucus in Cystic Fibrosis patients Intravenous acetylcysteine is indicated for the treatment of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose. When paracetamol is taken in large quantities, a minor metabolite called N-acetyl- p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI ) accumulates within the body. It is normally conjugated by glutathione, but when taken in excess, the body's glutathione reserves are not sufficient to inactivate the toxic NAPQI. This metabolite is then free to react with key hepatic enzymes, therefore damaging hepatocytes. This may lead to severe liver damage and even death by fulminant liver failure. For this indication, acetylcysteine acts to augment the glutathione reserves in the body and, together with glutathione, directly bind to toxic metabolites. These actions serve to protect hepatocytes in the liver from NAPQI toxicity. Although both IV and oral acetylcysteine are equally effective for this indication, oral administration is poorly tolerated because high oral doses are required due to low oral bioavailability, because of its very unpleasant taste and odour, and because of adverse effects, paicularly nausea and vomiting. Inhaled acetylcysteine is indicated for mucolytic (\"mucus-dissolving\") therapy as an adjuvant in respiratory conditions with excessive and/or thick mucus production.",

The trick to determining the effect of a ganglionic blocker is to first know the predominant tone of the end organ in question. The blocker will produce the opposite effect of the predominant tone. The vessels, aerioles and veins, are predominantly under sympathetic tone. Most everything else is under parasympathetic tone. The hea is under predominantly parasympathetic control. Parasympathetic stimulation of the hea causes bradycardia. Removal of this tone with trimethaphan would result in tachycardia. The eye is predominantly under parasympathetic control. Parasympathetic stimulation causes the eye to accommodate (focus for near vision). Removal of this tone with trimethaphan would produce focusing for far vision. Aerioles are predominantly under sympathetic control. Sympathetic stimulation produces vasoconstriction and possibly hypertension. Removal of this tone with trimethaphan would produce vasodilatation and hypotension. The gut is predominantly under parasympathetic control, which increases gut motility. Removal of parasympathetic tone with trimethaphan would diminish gut motility. Ref: Pappano A. J. (2012). Chapter 8. Cholinoceptor-Blocking Drugs. In B. G. Katzung, S. B. Masters, A. J.

In spite of its present classification as class 3 drug, amiodarone also significantly blocks inactivated sodium channels. It also has weak adrenergic and calcium channel blocking actions. Consequence of these actions include slowing of the heart rate and AV node conduction. Amiodarone is the most powerful antiarryhthmic drug available for the treatment and prevention of both atrial and ventricular anyhthmias. Adverse effect:? Even sho term use of Amiodarone causes serious toxicity. Amiodarone accumulates in many tissues which includes hea, lung, liver and skin. Pulmonary toxicity It is the most impoant adverse effect. It is dose related. Fatal pulmonary fibrosis may be observed even in low doses. Patient usually presents with cough, chest pain and shoness of breath. Symptoms usually sta with dry cough and dvspnoea. Remember, that patients on amiodarone often have dypnoea attributable to other problems such as heart failure, so amiodarone lung toxicity is difficult to diagnose. Liver toxicity Abnormal liver function and hepatitis develops during amiodarone therapy. (1 have not got any documented evidence Oliver cirrhosis). Skin deposits Skin deposits results in photoderrnatitis and gray blue skin discoloration in sun exposed areas e. g. the malar region. Corneal microdeposits Corneal microdeposits are seen in viually all patients treated with Amiodarone after few weeks of treatment. Sometimes optic neuritis may develop and progress to blindness. Effect of Amiodarone on Thyroid Amiodarone is a potential source of large amount of inorganic iodine and it also blocks the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3). Thus Amiodarone may result in hypothyroidism or hypehyroidism. Thyroid function should be evaluated prior to initiation of treatment and monitored periodically. Cardiac toxicity Amiodarone may produce symptomatic bradycardia and heart block in patients with preexisting sinus or A-V node disease.",

        "exp": "Heparin is often administered to individuals diagnosed with acute embolism or thrombosis by continuous IV infusion at a rate sufficient to raise the activated paial thromboplastin time (APTT) to 1. 5-2 times the control value. In other words, the anticoagulant effect of heparin should be continually monitored to ensure that the patient's APTT does not exceed 1. 5-2 times the control value. If the control APTT value is exceeded, the risk for internal bleeding can substantially increase. The bleeding time is a measure of platelet function and correlates well with the propensity to bleed. A complete blood count is a measure of all the cell components contained in the blood, e. g., the number of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Both the international normalized ratio (INR) and prothrombin time (PT) are used to monitor the anticoagulant effect of coumarin anticoagulants, such as warfarin. Coumarin anticoagulants are dosed to raise the PT to 1. 5-3. 5 times the control value. However, the thromboplastins used to monitor PT values vary among institutions, leading to different control values and subsequently different levels of anticoagulation for a given patient. In other words, there is no absolute consistency for a PT value taken at two different hospitals. Therefore, INR values are commonly used because the INR at one institution will equal that at another.",

        "question": "Nitrates are not used in",
        "exp": "Renal colic The main pharmacological action of Nitrates Nitroglycerine relaxes all types of smooth muscle irrespective of the state of the preexisting muscle tone. The most prominent action is exeed on the vascular smooth muscle. - Apa. from vascular smooth muscle nitrates also cause relaxation of the smooth muscles of the bronchi, gastrointestinal tract (including biliary system) and genitourinary tract. Nitrates are rapidly denitrated in the smooth muscle to release nitric oxide which activates cytosolic guanyl cyclase which in turn increases CGMP that leads to vasodilation Effect of nitrate on cardiovascular system Enzymes activates Nitrates --4 NO --> Gyanylcyclase 1' CGMP Vasodilation Nitrates cause relaxation of all the components of vascular system from large aeries to veins, aerioles and capillaries. Veins respond at the lowest concentrations and aeries at slightly higher one (Veins express greater amount of the enzyme that generates NO )from organic nitrates). The primary direct result of an effective dose of nitroglycerine is marked relaxation of veins with increased venous capacitance and decreased ventricular preload. This leads to reduction in pulmonary vascular pressure and hea size. Effect of nitrates on coronary circulation '* In normal subjects without coronary disease - Nitroglycerine can induce a significant if transient increase in total coronary blood flow. In patients with angina due to atherosclerosis - There is no evidence that total coronary. flow is increased in patients with angina due to atherosclerotic obstructive coronary aery disease. However, in these patients - Nitrates cause redistribution of coronary blood flow from normal to ischemic regions which may play role in therapeutic effect. There are two types of vessels in coronary circulation: Larger conducting aeries They run epicardially and send perforating branches to deeper tissue. Smaller resistance vessels These are the perforating branches of larger conducting aeries. These aerioles supply blood to endocardium. If there is ischemia in any region of endocardium the perforating vessels of those region are dilated due to autoregulation (hypoxia causes vasodilation). Nitrates preferentially dilates larger conducting vessels. This pattern of action ours more blood flow towards the ischaemic zone as the smaller endocardial vessels are already dilated as a result of hypoxia / ischaemia. Nitrates in heart failure Nitrates afford relief by causing venous pooling of blood. - Nitrates reduce venous return (preload) decreases end diastolic volume -4 improvement in left ventricular function by Laplace law regression of pulmonary congestion. Nitrates are used in cyanide poisoning Cyanide poisoning results from complexing of cytochrome iron by the CV ion. - Methemoglobin has a very affinity for CN ion. - Methemoglobin combines with CN to form cyamnethemoglobin which is rapidly excreted by the body. It is a well known fact that Nitrates generate generate Methemoglobin when they combine with Hb. - Thus administration of nitrates will generate large amount of methemoglobin. - Due to its high offinity. for cyanide, methemoglobin combines with cyanide. forming cyanmethemoglobin. - This will regenerate active cytochrome. - However this may again dissociate to release cyanide. - The cynamethemoglobin can be fuher detoxified by the intravenous administration of sodium thiosulfate. This results in formation of thiocyanate ion a less toxic ion that is readily excreted. Biliary colic Esophageal spasm Sublingual GIN promptly relieves pain. Nitrates taken before a meal facilitate feeding in esophageal achalasia by reducing esophageal tone. Also remember these impoant propeies of Nitrates. Oral availability of Nitrates is low The liver contains a high capacity organic nitrate reductase that removes nitrate groups in a stepwise _fashion from the parent molecule and ultimately inactivates the drug. Therefore oral bioavailability of the traditional organic nitrates e. g. nitroglycerine and isosorbidedinitrate is very low. For this reason sublingual route is preferred for nitrates. Nitroglycerine and isosorbide dintrate are both absorbed effectively by this route and reach therapeutic blood levels within a few minutes. Nitrates develop tolerance With continued exposure smooth muscles develop tolerance to nitrates. The mechanism by which tolerance develops are not completely understood. As noted above diminished release of nitric oxide resulting from depletion of tissue thiol compounds may be paly responsible, for tolerance to nitrates. Some student argue that cyanide poisoning should be the answer because nitrites not nitrates are used in cyanide poisoning but we are not convinced. All the standard books group them together and do not differentiate between nitrates or nitrites. More so Nitrates have'nt found wide clinical use in Renal colic - None of the standard text books mention use of nitrates in renal colic. - Both Goodman Gilman and KDT says that unlike its consistent effect on muscles of biliary tract, the action of nitrates on ureteric muscles is variable therefore it has not found application in renal colic. - None of the studies and research papers convincingly state that nitrates should be used in renal colic. Nitrates have been anecdotally used only in uruguay to treat renal colic. A trial was conducted based on this but it did'nt come out with conclusive results. - It states that large trials and studies should be undeaken before nitrates before nitrates use is begun clinically.",

Which of the following would be the most effective pharmacotherapy?",
        "exp": "The gross specimen shows a typical peptic ulcer of the first poion of the duodenum. The great majority of these ulcers are associated with chronic H. pylori infection, which plays a pathogenetic role. Eradication of H. pylori is necessary not only for rapid healing of active ulcers, but also to prevent future recurrence. Therefore, drugs that eradicate this gram-negative bacillus are used for treatment of active peptic ulcer disease. Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole or lansoprazole) also have activity against H. pylori, but alone are not sufficient to achieve eradication. This treatment must be combined with at least one of the antibiotics (usually two) that are effective against H. pylori. Clarithromycin is usually used in combination with either metronidazole or amoxicillin. Aluminum or magnesium-containing antacids are probably the most common over-the-counter medications used by patients with peptic ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux for prompt relief of epigastric pain and discomfo. These drugs are no longer recommended as first-line agents for treatment of peptic disease nor do they have anti-H. pylori activity. H2-receptor blocking agents, including cimetidine, famotidine, and ranitidine are not effective in eradicating H. pylori infection. However, they provide rapid symptomatic relief and promote ulcer healing. Prostaglandin analogs (e. g. misoprostol) are used exclusively as prophylactic agents to prevent NSAIDs-induced ulcers, not as a standard treatment of peptic ulcers. These drugs act by stimulating mucus and bicarbonate production.",

This can be treated by Lv. injection of a rapidly acting a-blocker eg, phentolamine. Prazosin and chlorpromazine are alternative. 2. Reserpine, guanethidine, tricyclic antidepressant. o Rise in BP and body temprature can occur when these drugs are given with MAO inhibits --> due to their initial NA releasing or uptake inhibiting action. 3.

For example, limited CSF penetration may be enhanced by the presence of inflamed meninges. The orable penetration of vancomycin into skin tissues may be significantly impaired in patients with diabetes. Vancomycin penetration into lung epithelial lining fluid is limited relative to that of simultaneous serum concentration (the ratio of lung tissue to serum concentration is about 0. 25). Vancomycin's primary route of elimination is renal excretion of unchanged drug. The rate of elimination is directly related to creatinine clearance.

Clonazepam is occasionally used as adjunctive therapy for certain types of seizures, whereas lorazepam and diazepam are the drugs of choice in terminating status epilepticus. Due to cross-tolerance, chlordiazepoxide, clorazepate, diazepam, lorazepam, and oxazepam are useful in the acute treatment of alcohol withdrawal and reduce the risk of withdrawal-related seizures.\u200b One area of concern regarding the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety is the potential for habituation, dependence, and abuse. Patients with certain personality disorders or a history of drug or alcohol abuse are particularly susceptible. However, the risk of dependence must be balanced with the need for treatment, since benzodiazepines are effective in both short- and long-term treatment of patients with sustained or recurring bouts of anxiety. Further, premature discontinuation of benzodiazepines, in the absence of other pharmacological treatment, results in a high rate of relapse. Withdrawal of benzodiazepines after chronic treatment, particularly those with short duration of action, can include increased anxiety and seizures. For this reason, it is important that discontinuation be earned out in a gradual manner. Benzodiazepines cause many adverse effects. including sedation, mild memory impairments. decreased alertness, and slowed reaction time (which may lead to accidents). Memory problems can include visual-spatial deficits, but will manifest clinically in a variety of ways, including difficulty in word-finding. Occasionally, paradoxical reactions can occur with benzodiazepines such as an increase in anxiety, sometimes reaching panic attack proportions. Other pathological reactions can include irritability, aggression, or behavioral disinhibition. Amnesic reactions (i. e., loss of memory for particular periods) can also occur. Benzodiazepines should not be used in pregnant women; there have been rare reports of craniofacial defects. In addition, benzodiazepines taken prior to delivery may result in sedated, under-responsive newborns and prolonged withdrawal reactions. In the elderly, benzodiazepines increase the risk of falls and must be used cautiously. These drugs are safer than classical sedative-hypnotics in overdosage and typically are fatal only if combined with other CNS depressants.

Patients with type 11 diabetes mellitus should be stopped oral hypoglycemics several days prior to surgery (especially metformin which is known to contribute to postoperative lactic acidosis) About other options Antihypeensive agents With rare exceptions antihypeensive drug therapy should be continued upto the time of surgery. Some clinicians withhold ACE inhibitors on the morning of surgery because of their association with an increased incidence of intraoperative hypotension. However withholding these agents increases the risk of marked perioperative hypertension and the need for parenteral antihypeensive agents. Surgical procedures on patients with sustained preoperative diastolic blood pressure higher than 110 mm. Hg-paicularly those with evidence of endorgan damage should be delayed until blood pressure is better controlled over the course of several days. Beta blockers A sudden stop can result in rebound hypertension, tachycardia and recurrent myocardial ischemia. They are continued up to and including morning of surgery and restaed immediately afterwards. Antianginal drugs Antianginal drugs such as calcium channel blockers or nitrates (GTN) should not be stopped before surgery without a very specific reason or angina may recur. Calcium channel blockers They have antiischaemic propey despite a theoretical risk of increased bleeding. They should be continued upto including the day of surgery. Nitrates To be continued up to and including day of surgery. About other classes of drugs Statins They should have a beneficial effect on outcome especially after coronary aery bypass grafting thus they are continued up to the day of surgery. Alpha 2 agonists Abrupt withdrawl an result in extreme hypertension and myocardial ischemia. So it should be continued upto and including the day of surgery. Diuretics There is risk of hypovolemia and hypotension but still should be continued up to the day of surgery. Digoxin and antiarryhthmics Should be continued upto the day of surgery. ACE inhibitors Continued use can result in perioperative hemodynamic instability For hypertension: continued to the day of surgery For heart failure: discontinue on the day of surgery especially if baseline blood pressure is low. Drugs that should be stopped before surgery Lithium It should be stopped 2 days before major surgery as it potentiates the non depolarizing group of relaxants and in emergency cases suxamethonium and regional blocks should be considered as alternative. Oestrogen containing oral contraceptive pills They are stopped before surgery beause they increase the risk of deep venous thrombosis. Surgery and the combined pill both reduce the activity of antithrombin Combined pills, should if possible be discontinued 4 weeks before major elective surgery or leg surgery such as varicose veins and staed again at the first period following an interval of 2 weeks after the operation. Aspirin Use may be associated with increased bleeding due to platelet dysfunction. They should be stopped 5-7 days before surgery if possible. Oral anticoagulants (warfarin) Should be stopped 4 days prior to surgery and substituted by iv heparin. Oral hypoglycemics Patients with type II diabetes mellitus should stop oral hypoglycemics several days prior to surgery (especially metformin which is known to contribute to postoperative lactic (acidosis) Patients on insulin (SC or iv) should omit their morning dose. Also know about these Monoamine oxidase inhibitors These drugs irreversibly inhibit monoamine oxidase. Stopping these drugs three weeks prior to anaesthesia to allow resynthesis of the enzyme is no longer considered necessary. Tricyclic antidepressants It competitively blocks norepinephrine reuptake by postganglionis sympathetic nerve endings. Patients taking these drugs are therefore more sensitive to catecholamines so any sympathominetic given simultaneously may cause hypertension and arryhthmia. These drugs were discontinued earlier but nowdays they are used.",
