The goals of treatment are to prevent myocardial ischemia, decrease left ventricular afterload, decrease myocardial oxygen consumption, and prevent rupture and bleeding from suture lines Nitroprusside is a potent direct aerial and venous dilator, acting through release of nitric oxide. It has a rapid onset of action, and a shoer half-life and thus is given in the form of continuous infusion. The hypotensive effects of nitroprusside can be unpredictable because it simultaneously causes potent venodilatation and peripheral aerial vasodilatation. This is especially the case for patients with severe left ventricular hyperophy and preload-dependent diastolic dysfunction. It has been shown to cause coronary steal; it can cause a significant reflex tachycardia, and it can decrease oxygen circulation. It is photosensitive, so it requires special handling. Its most serious adverse effect is in the form of cyanide toxicity, which occurs due to accumulation of its metabolites thiocyanate/ cyanide and its clinical presentation may vary leading to difficulty in diagnosis. Thus, it is recommended that this drug be used only when other intravenous antihypeensive agents are not available",

C: Valproate Sodium valproate is effective in absence/petit-mal seizures, combined grand mal and petit mal, myoclonic epilepsy, paial epilepsy, maniac depressive psychosis and as a prophylactic in febrile convulsion Absence seizures/Petit mal seizures (from the French for \"little illness\", a term dating from the late 18th century). Absences seizures are brief (usually less than 20 seconds), generalized epileptic seizures of sudden onset and termination. They have 2 essential components: - Clinically the impairment of consciousness (absence) - EEG generalized spike-and-slow wave discharges Absence seizures are broadly divided in typical and atypical absence seizures. Typical absence seizures usually occur in the context of idiopathic generalised epilepsies and EEG shows fast >2. 5 Hz generalised spike-wave discharges. Atypical absence seizures: - Occur only in the context of mainly severe symptomatic or cryptogenic epilepsies of children with learning difficulties who also suffer from frequent seizures of other types such as atonic, tonic and myoclonic - Onset and termination is not so abrupt and changes in tone are more pronounced - Ictal EEG is of slow less than 2. 5 Hz spike and slow wave. - The discharge is heterogeneous, often asymmetrical and may include irregular spike and slow wave complexes, fast and other paroxysmal activity. - Background interictal EEG is usually abnormal. Treatment of patients with absence seizures only is mainly with sodium valproate or ethosuximide, which are of equal efficacy controlling absences in around 75% of patients. Sodium valproate as a single drug is the DOC if tonic clonic seizures are also present or emerge during the therapy with ethosuximide Lamotrigine monotherapy is less effective with nearly half of the patients becoming seizure free.",

Oral/sublingual route is preferred. 1 mg is given at half hour intervals till relief is obtained or a total of 6 mg is given. Parenteral administration, though rapid in action is more hazardous. Ergotamine acts by constricting the dilated cranial vessels and/or by specific constriction of carotid A-V shunt channels. Ergotamine and DHE have also been shown to reduce neurogenic inflammation and leakage of plasma in duramater that occurs due to retrograde stimulation of periascular afferent nerves.

        "question": "In the beginning of resuscitation effos, 0. 5 mg of epinephrine is administered subcutaneously. Which adrenergic receptors, in which tissues, are responsible for the beneficial effect of epinephrine in this patient?",
        "exp": "Epinephrine is a non selective adrenergic agonist and a valuable resuscitative drug because of its effects at multiple adrenergic receptor subtypes. In the treatment of anaphylaxis, epinephrine increases myocardial contractility, accelerates heart rate, causes constriction of vascular smooth muscle, and causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. The principal pharmacologic effects of epinephrine that are beneficial in anaphylaxis are mediated: alpha-1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle, resulting in vasoconstriction, beta-1 receptors in the heart, resulting in increased contractility, and beta-2 receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, resulting in relaxation and relief of bronchoconstriction. (One simple mnemonic for the respective locations of beta1 and beta2 receptors is \"one heart, two lungs. \") Beta-2 receptors are also found, however, in vascular smooth muscle (especially in skeletal muscle beds), were, just as in bronchial smooth muscle, they promote relaxation. (Epinephrine dilates skeletal muscle vascular beds to maximize oxygen delivery for the \"fight-or-flight\" response.) The resulting vasodilation in skeletal muscle vascular beds would, by itself, tend to decrease blood pressure, which might tend to worsen the effects of anaphylactic shock, but this effect is mitigated by the intense alpha-1 receptor stimulation, causing vasoconstriction in multiple beds. The principal action of alpha-2 receptors is at the presynaptic nerve terminal, where receptor stimulation reduces the release of norepinephrine from the nerve terminal. Epinephrine does stimulate these receptors, but it does not really contribute to the beneficial actions of epinephrine in resuscitation. Alpha-2 receptors are not located in the heart (except at presynaptic nerve terminals), alpha-2 receptors do not have a significant beneficial effect in resuscitation, and beta-1 receptors are not located in bronchial smooth muscle, but are located in the heart. Beta-1 receptors are located in the heart, not in bronchial smooth muscle. The adrenergic receptor that produces bronchial smooth muscle relaxation is beta-2. Alpha-2 receptors are located primarily at presynaptic nerve terminals, and because the beta-2 receptors in vascular smooth muscle cause vasodilation, this not a helpful effect of epinephrine in this case. Also Know: Epinephrine is indicated for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions and acute asthma exacerbations. It is considered a first-line agent in the treatment of cardiac arrest (i. e., pulseless ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity). Epinephrine also causes bronchodilation and antagonizes the effects of histamine. Epinephrine significantly increases myocardial oxygen consumption and thus can exacerbate ventricular irritability in the setting of myocardial ischemia. Extravasation causes necrosis and sloughing, and requires prompt infiltration of the affected area with phentolamine. Ref: Miller B. A., Clements E. A. (2011). Chapter 24.

Exenatide is resistant to DPP-4. It acts similar to GLP-1 - Enhancement of postprandial insulin release, suppression of glucagon release and appetite as well as slowing of gastric emptying. It is given by subcutaneous route & used in type 2 DM Nausea is most impoant side effect. Sitagliptin This is orally active inhibitor of DPP-4. It prevents degradation of endogenous GLP-1 and other incretins, potentiating their action, resulting in limitation of postprandial hyperglycemia. It is used in type 2 DM. Other DPP-4 inhibitor is vildagliptin Pramlintide This is a synthetic amylin analogue (Amylin is a polypeptide produced by pancreatic (3-cells which reduces glucagon secretion from a-cells and delays gastric emptying).

C: Ulcerative Colitis The mainstay of drug therapy for mild and moderate ulcerative colitis is sulfasalazine and other aminosalicylic acid (ASA) compounds and coicosteroids Sulfasalazine It is a sulfa drug, a derivative of mesalazine (also called 5-aminosalicylic acid, or 5-ASA) Sulfasalazine is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It is also indicated for use in rheumatoid ahritis and used in other types of inflammatory ahritis (e. g. psoriatic ahritis) where it has a beneficial affect. It is often well tolerated compared to other DMARDS. It is usually not given to children under 2 years of age. It yields the metabolite sulfapyridine which gives rise to side-effects such as agranulocytosis and hypospermia. The other metabolite of sulfasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is attributed to the drug's therapeutic effect. Therefore, 5-ASA and other derivatives of 5-ASA, are now usually preferred and given alone (as mesalazine), despite their increased cost, due to their more ourable side-effect profile. Sulfasalazine, and its metabolite 5-ASA, are poorly absorbed from the gut.",

Unpredictably, severe myelosuppression with pemetrexed, seen especially in patients with pre-existing homocysteinemia and possibly reflecting folate deficiency, is largely eliminated by concurrent administration of low dosages of folic acid, 350-1000 mg/day, beginning 1-2 weeks prior to pemetrexed and continuing while the drug is administered.

Thalidomide was chiefly sold during the late 1950s and early 1960s to pregnant women, as an antiemetic to combat morning sickness. Children were born with severe malformities, including phocomelia, because their mothers had taken thalidomide during pregnancy. Apa from its infamous tendency to induce bih defects and peripheral neuropathy, the main side effects of thalidomide include fatigue and constipation. It also is associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis especially when combined with dexamethasone, for treatment of multiple myeloma. In multiple myeloma patients, concomitant use with zoledronic acid may lead to increased incidence of renal dysfunction. High doses can lead to pulmonary oedema, atelectasis, aspiration pneumonia and refractory hypotension. It is very effective in dermatolgical conditions like: ENL, aphthous stomatitis, Behcet's disease, LE, and prurigo nodularis",

Because trimethoprim is more lipid-soluble than sulfamethoxazole, it has a larger volume of distribution than the latter drug. Therefore, when 1 pa of trimethoprim is given with 5 pas of sulfamethoxazole (the ratio in the formulation), the peak plasma concentrations are in the ratio of 1: 20, which is optimal for the combined effects of these drugs in vitro.

Therefore, it only paially reverses the anticoagulant activity of LMWHs and has no effect on fondaparinux. The very sho molecules of fondaparinux do not bind protamine.

A: N-acetyl cysteine In paracetamol poisoning, depletion of hepatic and renal glutathione potentiates the toxicity whereas treatment with sulfhydryl compounds such as cysteamine, 1- methionine and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is beneficial Acetylcysteine/ N-acetylcysteine/ N-acetyl-L-cysteine/ NAC) It is used primarily as a mucolytic agent and in the management of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose. Other uses include sulfate repletion in conditions, such as autism, where cysteine and related sulfur amino acids may be depleted. Acetylcysteine is a derivative of cysteine; an acetyl group is attached to the nitrogen atom. It is used as a cough medicine because it breaks disulfide bonds in mucus and liquefies it, making it easier to cough up. It is also this action of breaking disulfide bonds that makes it useful in thinning the abnormally thick mucus in Cystic Fibrosis patients Intravenous acetylcysteine is indicated for the treatment of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose. When paracetamol is taken in large quantities, a minor metabolite called N-acetyl- p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI ) accumulates within the body. It is normally conjugated by glutathione, but when taken in excess, the body's glutathione reserves are not sufficient to inactivate the toxic NAPQI. This metabolite is then free to react with key hepatic enzymes, therefore damaging hepatocytes. This may lead to severe liver damage and even death by fulminant liver failure. For this indication, acetylcysteine acts to augment the glutathione reserves in the body and, together with glutathione, directly bind to toxic metabolites. These actions serve to protect hepatocytes in the liver from NAPQI toxicity. Although both IV and oral acetylcysteine are equally effective for this indication, oral administration is poorly tolerated because high oral doses are required due to low oral bioavailability, because of its very unpleasant taste and odour, and because of adverse effects, paicularly nausea and vomiting. Inhaled acetylcysteine is indicated for mucolytic (\"mucus-dissolving\") therapy as an adjuvant in respiratory conditions with excessive and/or thick mucus production.",

        "exp": "Trimethaphan is a ganglionic blocker that is sometimes administered during surgery to maintain controlled hypotension and to minimize blood loss. The trick to determining the effect of a ganglionic blocker is to first know the predominant tone of the end organ in question. The blocker will produce the opposite effect of the predominant tone. The vessels, aerioles and veins, are predominantly under sympathetic tone. Most everything else is under parasympathetic tone. The heart is under predominantly parasympathetic control. Parasympathetic stimulation of the heart causes bradycardia. Removal of this tone with trimethaphan would result in tachycardia. The eye is predominantly under parasympathetic control. Parasympathetic stimulation causes the eye to accommodate (focus for near vision). Removal of this tone with trimethaphan would produce focusing for far vision. Aerioles are predominantly under sympathetic control. Sympathetic stimulation produces vasoconstriction and possibly hypertension. Removal of this tone with trimethaphan would produce vasodilatation and hypotension. The gut is predominantly under parasympathetic control, which increases gut motility. Removal of parasympathetic tone with trimethaphan would diminish gut motility. Ref: Pappano A. J. (2012). Chapter 8. Cholinoceptor-Blocking Drugs. In B. G. Katzung, S. B. Masters, A. J.

The most prominent action is exeed on the vascular smooth muscle. - Apa. from vascular smooth muscle nitrates also cause relaxation of the smooth muscles of the bronchi, gastrointestinal tract (including biliary system) and genitourinary tract. Nitrates are rapidly denitrated in the smooth muscle to release nitric oxide which activates cytosolic guanyl cyclase which in turn increases CGMP that leads to vasodilation Effect of nitrate on cardiovascular system Enzymes activates Nitrates --4 NO --> Gyanylcyclase 1' CGMP Vasodilation Nitrates cause relaxation of all the components of vascular system from large aeries to veins, aerioles and capillaries. Veins respond at the lowest concentrations and aeries at slightly higher one (Veins express greater amount of the enzyme that generates NO )from organic nitrates). The primary direct result of an effective dose of nitroglycerine is marked relaxation of veins with increased venous capacitance and decreased ventricular preload. This leads to reduction in pulmonary vascular pressure and heart size. Effect of nitrates on coronary circulation '* In normal subjects without coronary disease - Nitroglycerine can induce a significant if transient increase in total coronary blood flow. In patients with angina due to atherosclerosis - There is no evidence that total coronary. flow is increased in patients with angina due to atherosclerotic obstructive coronary aery disease. However, in these patients - Nitrates cause redistribution of coronary blood flow from normal to ischemic regions which may play role in therapeutic effect. There are two types of vessels in coronary circulation: Larger conducting aeries They run epicardially and send perforating branches to deeper tissue. Smaller resistance vessels These are the perforating branches of larger conducting aeries. These aerioles supply blood to endocardium. If there is ischemia in any region of endocardium the perforating vessels of those region are dilated due to autoregulation (hypoxia causes vasodilation). Nitrates preferentially dilates larger conducting vessels. This pattern of action ours more blood flow towards the ischaemic zone as the smaller endocardial vessels are already dilated as a result of hypoxia / ischaemia. Nitrates in heart failure Nitrates afford relief by causing venous pooling of blood. - Nitrates reduce venous return (preload) decreases end diastolic volume -4 improvement in left ventricular function by Laplace law regression of pulmonary congestion. Nitrates are used in cyanide poisoning Cyanide poisoning results from complexing of cytochrome iron by the CV ion. - Methemoglobin has a very affinity for CN ion. - Methemoglobin combines with CN to form cyamnethemoglobin which is rapidly excreted by the body. It is a well known fact that Nitrates generate generate Methemoglobin when they combine with Hb. - Thus administration of nitrates will generate large amount of methemoglobin. - Due to its high offinity. for cyanide, methemoglobin combines with cyanide. forming cyanmethemoglobin. - This will regenerate active cytochrome. - However this may again dissociate to release cyanide. - The cynamethemoglobin can be fuher detoxified by the intravenous administration of sodium thiosulfate. This results in formation of thiocyanate ion a less toxic ion that is readily excreted. Biliary colic Esophageal spasm Sublingual GIN promptly relieves pain. Nitrates taken before a meal facilitate feeding in esophageal achalasia by reducing esophageal tone. Also remember these impoant propeies of Nitrates. Oral availability of Nitrates is low The liver contains a high capacity organic nitrate reductase that removes nitrate groups in a stepwise _fashion from the parent molecule and ultimately inactivates the drug. Therefore oral bioavailability of the traditional organic nitrates e. g. nitroglycerine and isosorbidedinitrate is very low. For this reason sublingual route is preferred for nitrates. Nitroglycerine and isosorbide dintrate are both absorbed effectively by this route and reach therapeutic blood levels within a few minutes. Nitrates develop tolerance With continued exposure smooth muscles develop tolerance to nitrates. The mechanism by which tolerance develops are not completely understood. As noted above diminished release of nitric oxide resulting from depletion of tissue thiol compounds may be paly responsible, for tolerance to nitrates. Some student argue that cyanide poisoning should be the answer because nitrites not nitrates are used in cyanide poisoning but we are not convinced. All the standard books group them together and do not differentiate between nitrates or nitrites. More so Nitrates have'nt found wide clinical use in Renal colic - None of the standard text books mention use of nitrates in renal colic. - Both Goodman Gilman and KDT says that unlike its consistent effect on muscles of biliary tract, the action of nitrates on ureteric muscles is variable therefore it has not found application in renal colic. - None of the studies and research papers convincingly state that nitrates should be used in renal colic. Nitrates have been anecdotally used only in uruguay to treat renal colic. A trial was conducted based on this but it did'nt come out with conclusive results. - It states that large trials and studies should be undeaken before nitrates before nitrates use is begun clinically.",

The other type (less common) is progressive subtype, which is characterized by a steady functional decline from disease onset. o Therapy for MS can be divided into several categories:? 1. Treatment of acute attack Coicosteroids (Methylprednisolone, prednisolone) are used 2. Treatment with disease-modifing agents that reduce the biological activity of MS Disease modifying agents for multiple sclerosis are (i)IFN-f1 la; (ii) IFN-fl lb, (iii) Glatiramer; (iv) Natalizumab; (v) Finoglimod: (vi) Mitoxantrone; (vii) Cladaribine. 3.

Patients with type 11 diabetes mellitus should be stopped oral hypoglycemics several days prior to surgery (especially metformin which is known to contribute to postoperative lactic acidosis) About other options Antihypeensive agents With rare exceptions antihypeensive drug therapy should be continued upto the time of surgery. Some clinicians withhold ACE inhibitors on the morning of surgery because of their association with an increased incidence of intraoperative hypotension. However withholding these agents increases the risk of marked perioperative hypertension and the need for parenteral antihypeensive agents. Surgical procedures on patients with sustained preoperative diastolic blood pressure higher than 110 mm. Hg-paicularly those with evidence of endorgan damage should be delayed until blood pressure is better controlled over the course of several days. Beta blockers A sudden stop can result in rebound hypertension, tachycardia and recurrent myocardial ischemia. They are continued up to and including morning of surgery and restaed immediately afterwards. Antianginal drugs Antianginal drugs such as calcium channel blockers or nitrates (GTN) should not be stopped before surgery without a very specific reason or angina may recur. Calcium channel blockers They have antiischaemic propey despite a theoretical risk of increased bleeding. They should be continued upto including the day of surgery. Nitrates To be continued up to and including day of surgery. About other classes of drugs Statins They should have a beneficial effect on outcome especially after coronary aery bypass grafting thus they are continued up to the day of surgery. Alpha 2 agonists Abrupt withdrawl an result in extreme hypertension and myocardial ischemia. So it should be continued upto and including the day of surgery. Diuretics There is risk of hypovolemia and hypotension but still should be continued up to the day of surgery. Digoxin and antiarryhthmics Should be continued upto the day of surgery. ACE inhibitors Continued use can result in perioperative hemodynamic instability For hypertension: continued to the day of surgery For heart failure: discontinue on the day of surgery especially if baseline blood pressure is low. Drugs that should be stopped before surgery Lithium It should be stopped 2 days before major surgery as it potentiates the non depolarizing group of relaxants and in emergency cases suxamethonium and regional blocks should be considered as alternative. Oestrogen containing oral contraceptive pills They are stopped before surgery beause they increase the risk of deep venous thrombosis. Surgery and the combined pill both reduce the activity of antithrombin Combined pills, should if possible be discontinued 4 weeks before major elective surgery or leg surgery such as varicose veins and staed again at the first period following an interval of 2 weeks after the operation. Aspirin Use may be associated with increased bleeding due to platelet dysfunction. They should be stopped 5-7 days before surgery if possible. Oral anticoagulants (warfarin) Should be stopped 4 days prior to surgery and substituted by iv heparin. Oral hypoglycemics Patients with type II diabetes mellitus should stop oral hypoglycemics several days prior to surgery (especially metformin which is known to contribute to postoperative lactic (acidosis) Patients on insulin (SC or iv) should omit their morning dose. Also know about these Monoamine oxidase inhibitors These drugs irreversibly inhibit monoamine oxidase. Stopping these drugs three weeks prior to anaesthesia to allow resynthesis of the enzyme is no longer considered necessary. Tricyclic antidepressants It competitively blocks norepinephrine reuptake by postganglionis sympathetic nerve endings. Patients taking these drugs are therefore more sensitive to catecholamines so any sympathominetic given simultaneously may cause hypertension and arryhthmia. These drugs were discontinued earlier but nowdays they are used.",

It increases effective refractory period-ERP (Le refractoriness) of A-V node by direct, vagomimetic and antiadrenergic action - the minimum interval between consecutive impulses that can successfully traverse the conducting tissue is increased. 2. A degree of A-V block is naturally established in AF. Because of the relatively long ERP of A-V node, many atrial impulses impinge on it while it is still refractory; others falling early in the relative refractory period get extinguished by decremental conduction - These concealed impulses leave upper margin ofA-V node refractory for a fuher period. Thus, any influence which increases atrial rate in AF (e. g. digitalis), by itself reduces ventricular rate. o Inhibition of Na+ K+ ATPase is responsible for inotropic action of digitalis, not for antiarrhythmic action. o Digitalis has two impoant pharmacological actions - I.

Roxithromycin, Clarithromycin and Azithromycin are the later additions. Interestingly, the nonantibiotic macrolides: tacrolimus, pimecrolimus and sirolimus also possess immunomodulatory properties. The antibiotic effects of macrolides are mediated by inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis, through inhibition of peptidyltransferase activity. They have been frequently used in the past for treating many upper respiratory tract infections including GAS pharyngitis with adequate efficacy (>90%). Their effects on immunomodulation appear to extend beyond their antimicrobial actions as they have been shown to mitigate cytokine production in animal studies and human trials. While its antibiotic properties have been attributed to mechanisms shared by other macrolides, AZM has been shown to act primarily on the lymphokine CD4 Th1 cell line reducing the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-6, and increasing the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in macrophage cell lines after stimulation with a combination of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IFN-\u03b3. The immunomodulatory potential of AZM is not limited to suppression of production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, it also suppresses i. NOS-mediated nitric oxide production.

All the insulin secretagogus increase insulin secretion from the pancreas through the same mechanism i. e., by interfering with potassium channel. All the insulin secretagogues have the potential to cause profound and persistent hypoglycemia especially in elderly individuals. Hypoglycemia is usually related to delayed meals, increased physical activity, alcohol intake or renal insufficiency. Individuals who ingest an overdose of some agents develop prolong and serious hypoglycemia and should he monitored closely in the hospital. Thiazolidinediones (Pioglitazone) Thiazolidinediones are considered \"eguglycemics\" and are efficacious in about 70% new users. Combination therapy of thiazolidinediones with sulfonyureas or insulin can lead to hypoglycemia and may require close adjustment. Biguanides (Metformin Phenformin) Biguanides lower glucose among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus largely by decreasing hepatic glucose output. It is also thought to increase glucose uptake by skeletal muscles. Because insulin secretion is unaltered hypoglycemia is not a side effect of metf. Ormin used as monotherapy. Alpha Glucosidase inhibitors (Acarbose) Lowers glucose by inhibiting intestinal enzymes that digest carbohydrate there by reducing carbohydrate digestion. Because of its mechanism of action, acarbose, when administered alone does not cause hypoglecemia in the fasting or postprandial states.

This includes decreased renal perfusion, leading to decrease in urine output. o When the patient is being treated, main aim is to improve perfusion; not just to raise blood pressure. o Dopamine dilates the renal blood vessels and improves renal perfusion, therefore it is preferred in the shock. o However you should keep in mind that dopamine is preferred in shock due to this advantageous effect, i. e., renal venodilatory effect. But the primary mechanism of action which is responsible for the improvement in shock is positive chronotropic effect. o The primary defect is decreased cardiac output with inadequate tissue perfusion. o Therefore the primary mechanism of action of the drugs used in shock is to increase cardiac output by increasing the cardiac force of contraction (i. e., inotropic effect). o Dopamine has additional benefit, i. e., it dilates renal vessels. Therefore dopamine is preferred in shock. o From above discussion, you can understand that two question can be framed. (i) Primary mechanism of action of dopamine in shock --) Ionotropic effect (Cardiac stimulation/increased cardiac output). (ii) Dopamine is preferred in shock --) Because it has renal venodilatory effect. o Following statement will clear your doubt. \"An advantage of using dopamine in the treatment of shock is that its inotropic action increases cardiac output while dilating renal blood vessels and thereby increasing renal blood flow\" Modern pharmacology with clinical application. \"Dopamine is used in cardiogenic shock. Dopamine is an effective inotropic agent that causes less increase in heart rate (less chronotropic effect)\".

They benefit by reducing bronchial hyperreactivity, mucosal edema and by suppressing inflammatory response to antigen antibody reaction or other trigger stimuli. The main adverse effects of inhaled steroids are caused by the deposition of the drug in the upper airways, resulting in dysphonia, oropharyngeal candidiasis, and cough. These effects may be reduced by rinsing the mouth and use of a spacer device. Systemic adverse effects are clinically relevant only at doses more than 600 microgram/day. They include adrenal suppression, osteoporosis, growth suppression, skin thinning, and easy bruising. Inhaled coicosteroids use is associated with the development of posterior subcapsular and nuclear cataracts. Inhaled steroids are safe during pregnancy.",

Its beneficial effects in spasticity result from actions at spinal and supraspinal sites. Baclofen can also be used to treat hiccups A very beneficial propey of baclofen is that tolerance does not seem to occur to any significant degree -- baclofen retains its therapeutic anti-spasmodic effects even after many years of continued use. Baclofen is widely used for the treatment of spastic movement disorders, especially in instances of spinal cord injury, spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease), peripheral neuropathy and trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgias The drug is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and is widely distributed throughout the body. Biotransformation is low and the drug is predominantly excreted in the unchanged form by the kidneys. Discontinuation of baclofen can be associated with a withdrawal syndrome which resembles benzodiazepine withdrawal and alcohol withdrawal.",

With the development of interventrical pulmonology field in the last 20 years definitive management of tracheal stenosis using minimally invasive endoscopic methods becomes a possibility. Endoscopic surgery has been shown to be useful especially in patients who are deemed high risk and too unwell for reconstructive surgery. One of the main drawbacks of endoscopic tit and surgery is the risk of recurrence of tracheal stenosis due to granulation and fibrotic tissue. Scar formation and restenosis is the main cause. Studies have shown that most of the recurrence of tracheal stenosis occurs within one to three months after the procedure and use of mitomycin C has been repoed in case studies to reduce the rate of recurrence. - Both in vitro and invivo mitomycin C has been proved to be a potent inhibitor of human fibroblasts at concentrations of. 04 mg/L Topical mitomycin C is a useful adjunct in the management of sho concentric membranous stenosis which does not involve the cailage.",

Specific management Calcium channel blockers Patients who have substantial reductions in pulmonary aerial pressure in response to sho acting vasodilators at the time of cardiac catheterization should he initially treated with calcium channel blockers. Endothelin receptor antagonist Bostenan is a non-selective endothelium receptor antagonist, is an approved t/t, for patients who are NYHA. functional classes III and IV.

Pulmonary circulation is unique in that it accommodates a blood flow that is almost equal to that of all the other organs of body but still maintains low pressure. The factors responsible for low pressure in pulmonary circulation (even with large volume of blood) are:- - Larger diameter of pulmonary vessels due to thin wall of pulmonary aery and aerioles. - Greater compliance (distensibility) of pulmonary vessels. numoral factors responsible for maintaining pulmonary circulation:?

It prevents endothelin mediated contraction of vessels. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors Nitric oxide mediates its action through increasing c. GMP concentration. Increased c. GMP relaxes the vessels. c. GMP is degraded by an enzyme phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5). - Slidenafanil is a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor. It reduces the degradation of c. GMP, thus causing vascular relaxation and reducing pulmonary hypertension. Prostacyclins In pulmonary hypertension, the level of prostacycline is reduced.

It is one of the four main alkaloids found in the bark of the Cinchona tree and is the only drug which over a long period of time has remained largely effective for treating the disease. Quinine has similar activity to chloroquine in that it is likely to interfere with the parasite's enzymatic digestion.

The liver clears most insulin during first-pass transit, whereas the kidney clears most of the insulin in systemic circulation. Degradation normally involves endocytosis of the insulin-receptor complex, followed by the action of insulin-degrading enzyme.
