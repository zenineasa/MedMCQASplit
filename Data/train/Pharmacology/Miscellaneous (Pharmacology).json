They are sometimes also used to treat anxiety disorders, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic rteuropathic pain, Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS), and for the relief of menopausal symptoms. SNRIs act upon, and increase, the levels of two neurotransmitters in the brain known to play an important part in mood: serotonin, and norepinephrine. These can be contrasted with the more widely-used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) which act upon serotonin alone.> Venlafaxine: The first and most commonly used SNRI. Reuptake effects of venlafaxine are dose-dependent. At low doses (<150 mg/day), it acts only on serotonergic transmission. At moderate doses (>150 mg/day), it acts on serotonergic and noradrenergic systems, whereas at high doses (>300 mg/day), it also affects dopaminergic neurotransmission.> Desvenlafaxine: The active metabolite of Venlafaxine. It is believed to work in a similar manner, though some evidence suggests lower response rates compared to venlafaxine and duloxetine.> Duloxetine: Duloxetine is contraindicated in patients with heavy alcohol use or chronic liver disease, as duloxetine can increase the levels of certain liver enzymes that can lead to acute hepatitis or other diseases in certain at risk patients. Currently, the risk of liver damage appears to be only for patients already at risk, unlike the antidepressant nefazodone, which, though rare, can spontaneously cause liver failure in healthy patients. Duloxetine is also approved for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), chronic musculoskeletal pain, including chronic osteoarthritis pain and chronic low back pain (as of October, 2010), and is one of the only three medicines approved by the FDA for Fibromyalgia.> Sibutramine: An SNRI, which, instead of being developed for the treatment of depression, was widely marketed as an appetite suppressant for weight loss purposes.> Bicifadine: By DOV Pharmaceutical, potently inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine (and dopamine to a lesser extent), but rather than being developed for the already-crowded antidepressant market, it is being researched as a non-optoid, non-NSAID analgesic.",

The hormone ADH is partly responsible for this process by controlling the amount of water the body retains from the kidney when filtering the blood stream.# Vasopressin has three main effects:> Increasing the water permeability of distal convoluted tubule & collecting duct cells in the kidney, thus allowing water reabsorption & excretion of more concentrated urine, i. e., antidiuresis. This occurs through increased transcription and insertion of water channels (Aquaporin-2) into the apical membrane of distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct epithelial cells. Aquaporins allow water to move down their osmotic gradient and out of the nephron, increasing the amount of water re-absorbed from the filtrate (forming urine) back into the bloodstream. This effect is mediated by V2 receptors. Vasopressin also increases the concentration of calcium in the collecting duct cells, by episodic release from intracellular stores. Vasopressin, acting through c. AMP, also increases transcription of the aquaporin-2 gene, thus increasing the total number of aquaporin-2 molecules in collecting duct cells.> Increasing permeability of the inner medullary portion of the collecting duct to urea by regulating the cell surface expression of urea transporters, which facilitates its reabsorption into the medullary interstitium as it travels down the concentration gradient created by removing water from the connecting tubule, cortical collecting duct, and outer medullary collecting duct.> Acute increase of sodium absorption across the ascending loop of Henle. This adds to the countercurrent multiplication which aids in proper water reabsorption later in the distal tubule and collecting duct.# Drug Stimulators of Vasopressin secretion: Vincristine, cyclophosphamide, tricyclic antidepressants, nicotine, epinephrine, and high doses of morphine. Lithium, which inhibits the renal effects of vasopressin, also enhances vasopressin secretion. Inhibitors of vasopressin secretion: Ethanol, phenytoin, low doses of morphine, glucocorticoids, fluphenazine, haloperidol, promethazine, oxilorphan, and butorphanol.

Overdose produces hepatic necrosis; acetaminophen metabolite (NAPQI) depletes glutathione and forms toxic tissue adducts in liver. N-acetylcysteine is antidote--regenerates glutathione. ACETAMINOPHEN OVERDOSAGEAcetaminophen is metabolized predominantly by a phase II reaction to innocuous sulfate and glucuronide metabolites. Acetaminophen can cause severe centrilobular hepatic necrosis when ingested in large amounts. Fatal fulminant disease is usually associated with ingestion of micro25 g. Blood levels of acetaminophen correlate with the severity of hepatic injury (levels > 300 microg/ mL 4 h are predictive of the severe damage; levels < 150 microg/ m. Lsuggest that hepatic injury is highly unlikely). Renal failure and myocardial injury may be present. Rx:# Treatment includes gastric lavage, supportive measures, and oral administration of activated charcoal or cholestyramine to prevent absorption of residual drug (effective if given >30 min after ingestion).# In patients with high acetaminophen blood levels (>200 mg/mL measured at 4 h or >100 mg/mL at 8 h after ingestion), the administration of sulfhydryl compounds (e. g., cysteamine, cysteine, or N-acetylcysteine) reduces the severity of hepatic necrosis. It appear to act by providing a reservoir of sulfhydryl groups to bind the toxic metabolites or by stimulating synthesis and repletion of hepatic glutathione.# Therapy should be begun within 8 h of ingestion but may be effective even if given as late as 24-36 h after overdose. Later administration of sulfhydryl compounds is of uncertain value.# Routine use of N-acetylcysteine has substantially reduced the occurrence of fatal acetaminophen hepatotoxicity.# When given orally, N- acetylcysteine is diluted to yield a 5% solution. A loading dose of 140 mg/ kg is given, followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 h for 15-20 doses.# Rx can be stopped when plasma acetaminophen levels indicate that the risk of liver damage is low.# If signs of hepatic failure (e. g., progressive jaundice, coagulopathy confusion) occur despite N-acetylcysteine therapy for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, liver transplantation is only option.

High doses of steroids or Tirilazad are thought to minimize the secondary effects of acute SCI.> 30-mg/kg bolus of methylprednisolone administered within 8 hours of injury, whereas the study evaluated methylprednisolone 5. 4 mg/kg/h for 24 or 48 hours versus tirilazad 2. 5 mg/kg q6h for 48 hours. (Tirilazad is a potent lipid preoxidation inhibitor.)> Between the 2 studies, it was determined that: (1) in patients treated earlier than 3 hours after injury, the administration of methyl- prednisolone for 24 hours was best; (2) in patients treated 3-8 hours after injury, the use of methylprednisolone for 48 hours was best; (3) Tirilazad was equivalent to methylprednisolone for 24 hours.> Both NASCIS studies evaluated the patients' neurologic status at baseline on enrollment into the study, at 6 weeks, and at 6 months and found absolutely no evidence suggests that giving the medication earlier (eg, in the first hour) provides more be nefit than giving it later (eg, between hours 7 and 8).> The authors concluded that there was only a benefit if methylprednisolone or tirilazad were given within 8 hours of injury.> Use of high-dose methylprednisolone in non-penetrating acute SCI had become the standard of care in North America. An increased incidence of infection and avascular necrosis has been documented.> Revised recommendations pertaining to steroid therapy in SCI:- The American College of Surgeons (ACS) has modified their advanced trauma life support (ACLS) guidelines to state that methylprednisolone is \"a recommended treatment\" rather than \"the recommended treatment. \" Updated guidelines issued in 2013 by the CNS and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) recommend against the use of steroids early after an acute SCI. Guidelines recommend that methylprednisolone not be used for the treatment of acute SCI within the first 24-48 hours following injury. Previous standard was revised because of a lack of medical evidence supporting the benefits of steroids in clinical settings and evidence that high-dose steroids are associated with harmful adverse effects. Overall, the benefit from steroids is considered modest at best, but for patients with complete or incomplete quadriplegia, a small improvement in motor strength in one or more muscles can provide important functional gains. Administration of steroids remains an institutional and physician preference in spinal cord injury. Administration of high-dose steroids within 8 hours of injury for all patients with acute spinal cord injury is practiced by most physicians. Current recommendation is to treat all patients with spinal cord injury according to the local/regional protocol. If steroids are recommended, they should be initiated within 8 hours of injury with the following steroid protocol: Methylpred- nisolone 30 mg/kg bolus over 15 minutes and an infusion of methylprednisolone at 5. 4 mg/kg/h for 23 hours beginning 45 minutes after the bolus.",
