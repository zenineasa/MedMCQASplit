Patient with malaria can achieve high plasma level of quinine with few signs of toxicity because of the elevated plasma alpha 1 acid glycoproteins, produced during acute phase of infection. It prevents quinine toxicity through binding of most of the drug in the plasma. Peak plasma level which a person can achieve without producing toxicity. a. in severely ill patients -15-20 mg/litreb. in persons without malaria - 10 mg/litre. About quinine.
