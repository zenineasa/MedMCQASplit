Thromboxane A2 (Ref: Goodman Gilman 12/e p868; Katzung 12/e p638; KDT 7/e p195, 6/e p186, 609)Aspirin causes several different effects in the body, mainly the reduction of inflammation, analgesia, the prevention of clotting, and the reduction of fever. Much of this is believed to be due to decreased production of prostaglandins and TXA2.\"In platelets, the major cyclooxygenase product is TxA2 (thromboxane A 2), a labile inducer of platelet aggregation and a potent vasoconstrictor. Aspirin blocks production of TxA2 by acetylating a serine residue near the active site of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), the enzyme that produces the cyclic endoperoxide precursor of TxA2. Because platelets do not synthesize new proteins, the action of aspirin on platelet COX-1 is permanent, lasting for the life of the platelet (7-10 days).

Platelets contain two purinergic receptors, P2Y1 and P2Y12; both are GPCRs for ADR The ADP-activated platelet P2Y1 receptor couples to the Gq-PLC-IP3-Ca2+ pathway and induces a shape change and aggregation. Activation of the P2Y12 receptor by ADP couples via Gi to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, resulting in lower levels of cyclic AMP and thereby less cyclic AMP-dependent inhibition of platelet activation. Apparently; both receptors must be stimulated for platelet activation, and inhibition of either receptor is sufficient to block platelet activation. Ticlopidine (TICLID) is a thieno pyridine that inhibits the P2Y12 receptor.CLOPIDOGREL The thieno pyridine dopidogrel (PLAVIX) is closely related to ticlopidine and appears to have a slightly more favorable toxicity profile with less frequent thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, although TTP has been reportedABCIXIMAB Abciximab (REOPRO) is the Fab fragment of a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the IIa3h receptor.ASPIRIN: In platelets, the major cyclooxygenase product is thromboxane A2, a labile inducer of platelet aggregation and a potent vasoconstrictor.
