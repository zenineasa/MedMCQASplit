Hypotension is rarer but also serious and most often is associated with excessively rapid intravenous infusions of quinine or Quinidine. Quinine diluted preferably in 5% (w/v) glucose solution to counteract hypoglycemia. In the absence of glucose, physiological saline may be used. This method of administration minimizes the danger of severe hypotension and subsequent respiratory collapse. Don't give quinine as bolus.
