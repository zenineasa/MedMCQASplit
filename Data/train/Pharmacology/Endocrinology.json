Somatostatin acts primarily as a negative regulator of a variety of different types of cells blocking processes such as cell secretion, cell growth and smooth muscle contraction. It is secreted from the hypothalamus into the portal circulation and travels to the anterior pituitary gland where it inhibits the production and release of both growth hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone: Somatostatin is present in many tissues other than hypothalamus.

Levosimendan also inhibits phosphodiesterase, and is used in acute heart failure. Cinacalcet (calcimimetics) is the first representative of a new-' class of drugs that activates the calcium sensing receptor (CaR). CaR has greatest concentration in the parathyroid gland.

It facilitates the movement of potassium ions through lipid membranes \"down\" the electrochemical potential gradient. A very little literature is available regarding valinomycin.

It enhances the transcription of several insulin responsive genes. Glitazones tend to reverse insulin resistance by enhancing GLUT4 expression and translocation. Entry of glucose into muscle and fat is improved. Hepatic gluconeo- genesis is also suppressed. Activation of genes regulating fatty acid metabolism and lipogenesis in adipose tissue contributes to the insulin sensitizing action. Lipolysis and plasma fatty acid levels are reduced. Adipocyte turnover and differentiation is accelerated by glitazones. Thus, fatty tissue is a major site of their action. Improved glycaemic control results inlowering of circulating Hb. A1C and insulin levels in type 2 DM patients. Pioglitazone, in addition, lowers serum triglyceride level and raises HDL level without much change in LDL level, probably because it acts on PPARa as well to induce expression of reverse cholesterol transpoer and some apoproteins.

With anti-thyroid drugs risk of foetal hypothyroidism and goiter are there.# However, low doses of propylthiouracil are preferred as it has greater protein binding, allowing less transfer to foetus. For the same reason it is preferred in nursing mothers also. HYPERTHYROIDISM IN PREGNANCYHyperthyroidism in pregnancy should be aggressively evaluated and treated. It is most commonly caused by Graves disease, but autonomously functioning nodules, gestational trophoblastic disease, thyroiditis, and hyperemesis gravidarum should also be considered. Methimazole crosses the placenta to a greater degree than propylthiouracil and has been associated with fetal aplasia cutis. However, propylthiouracil can be associated with liver failure. Some experts recommend propylthiouracil in the first trimester and methimazole thereafter. Radioiodine should not be used during pregnancy, either for scanning or treatment, because of effects on the fetal thyroid. In emergent circumstances, additional treatment with beta blockers and a saturated solution of potassium iodide may be necessary. Hyperthyroidism is most difficult to control in the first trimester of pregnancy and easiest to control in the third trimester.",

Buserelin, Goserelin, Leuprolide, Nafarelin, Triptorelin, have been developed: are 15-150 times more potent than natural Gn RH and longer acting. The superactive Gn. RH agonists are used as nasal spray or injected s. c. Long-acting preparations for once a month s. c. injection have been produced (triptorelin depot). The resulting reversible pharmacological oophorectomy /orchiectomy is being used in precocious puberty, prostatic carcinoma, endometriosis, premenopausal breast cancer, uterine leiomyoma, PCOD and to assist induced ovulation. It also has potential to be used as contraceptive for both males and females.# Goserelin is a drug often used in prostate carcinoma. Goserelin can cause gynecomastia as a side effect.# Anastrozole is a selective nonsteroidal inhibitor of aromatase. It is presently approved for first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer that is ER-positive.# Letrozole is a nonsteroidal competitive inhibitor of aromatase that is significantly more potent than aminoglutethimide and acts in the same way as anastrozole. It is also indicated for first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.# Exemestane is a steroidal hormonal agent that binds to and irreversibly inactivates aromatase. It is indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed on tamoxifen therapy. 1. Bicalutamide. Nonsteroidal anti-androgens2.

Tamsulosin. Alpha blocker# Prostate cancer is classically treated with diethylstilbesterol (DES) acting as an estrogen at the level of the hypothalamus to downregulate hypothalamic luteinizing hormone (LH) production, resulting in decreased elaboration of testosterone by the testicle. For this reason, orchiectomy is equally as effective as moderate-dose DES.# In the event that orchiectomy is not accepted by the patient, testicular androgen suppression can also be effected by luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists such as leuprolide and goserelin. These agents cause tonic stimulation of the LHRH receptor, with the loss of its normal pulsatile activation resulting in its desensitization and decreased output of LH by the anterior pituitary. Therefore, as primary hormonal manipulation in prostate cancer one can choose orchiectomy or leuprolide, not both.# The addition of actual antagonists of androgens acting at the androgen receptor, including flutamide or bicalutamide, is of uncertain additional benefit in extending overall response duration, but it clearly prevents the activation of androgen receptors by adrenal androgens, and the combined use of orchiectomy or leuprolide plus flutamide is referred to as \"total androgen blockade. \"",

Improve insulin availability. Overcome insulin resistance* Exogenous insulin* Sulfonylureas* Meglinitinide/ phenylalanine analogues* Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4ls)* Biguanides* Thiazolidinediones* Alpha glucosidase inhibitors. Major limitations (except for DPP-4ls). Major limitations* Hypoglycaemic episodes* Weight gain* Concern about premature Atherosclerosis d/t hyperinsulinemia. Inability to achieve normoglycaemia by themselves in many patients, especially moderate-to-severe cases. INSULIN (Discovered by Banting and Best in 1921). Preparations: Conventional preparations are obtained from pork (porcine) and beef (bovine). Addition of zinc makes it long acting. Insulin may be: o Ultra short acting (insulin lispro, glulisine and aspart)o Short acting (regular insulin and semi lente)o Intermediate acting (lente insulin and neutral protamine hagedron). o Long acting (ultra lente and protamine zinc insulin)o Ultra long acting (insulin detemir, glargine, degludec)* Single peak insulin and mono component insulin: less immunogenic.* Rapid-acting and short-acting insulins are clear solutions at neutral pH and contain small amounts of zinc to improve their stability and shelf-life.* All others except insulin glargine are dispensed as turbid suspensions at neutral pH with either protamine in phosphate buffer (neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin) or varying concentrations of zinc in acetate buffer (ultralente and lente insulins).* Insulin glargine is the only soluble, \"peakless\" ultralong- acting insulin analog.* When lente insulin is mixed with regular insulin, some of the regular insulin may form a complex with the protamine or Zn2+* D/t its acidic pH, insulin glargine cannot be mixed with other insulin preparations that are formulated at neutral pH.* Prevalence of hypoglycemia is reduced by 20-30% with insulin lispro, and glucose control, as assessed by Hb. Alc, is modestly but significantly improved.* Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Devices: most physiologic method of insulin replacement.* Best drug of choice to combine with insulin: metformin.* Major and dose limiting side effect of insulin therapy: Hypoglycemia.* Insulin detemir: not approved in pregnancy.* Degludec: action lasts for 72 hours. (? Weekly twice dosage). Main types of insulin preparation. Type. Onset. Peak. Duration. Comments. Rapid-acting insulin analogue5-15 min30-60 min2-5 hr. Can be injected at the start of a meal. Short-acting(soluble/ regular insulin)30 min1-3 hr4-8 hr. Usually injected 15-30 minutes before a meal. Clear solution. Intermediate or long-actin Insulin1-2 hr(NPH, Lente) 2-3 hr4-8 hr8-12 hr(NPH). Used to control glucose levels between meals. May be combined with(isophane or zinc insulin)(Ultralente)4-8 hr8-24 hr(Ultralente)short-octing insulin. Long-acting insulin analogue30-60 min. No pee k16-24 hr. Usually taken once daily. Route of administration* All preparations can be given by S. C. route.* Only regular (crystalline zinc) insulin can be given i. v.* Inhalational route (Exubera), oral insulin, buccal delivery of insulin- under trial. Basal-bolus regimen:* 3-4 daily injections.* A long-acting insulin (glargine) is injected once daily either before breakfast or before bed-time for basal coverage along with 2-3 meal - time injections of a rapid acting preparation (insulin lispro or aspart). Complications of insulin therapy* Most common complication is hypoglycemia.* Lipodystrophy (less with highly purified and recombinant forms)* Allergic reactions can occur with conventional preparation* Short lived edema due to Na+ retention. ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTSDRUGS ACTING BY THE RELEASE OF INSULIN* This group includes Sulfonyl ureas and meglitinides. These drugs inhibit ATP sensitive K+ channels and cause depolarization of b cells resulting in the release of insulin.* These drugs are effective only if 30% or more of the b cells in the pancreas are available.* Major limitation of these drugs is hypoglycemia. Sulfonvlureas:* These may be first generation (Tolbutamide, chlorpropamide) or second generation (glibenclamide, glipizide, gliclazide and glimepiride) compounds.* Tolbutamide is the shortest acting whereas chlorpropamide is the longest acting sulfonylurea.* Second generation drugs are most the potent.* They can cause weight gain (less chance with glipizide and gliclazide).* Chlorpropamide has additional actions like dilutional hyponatremia (ADH like action), cholestatic jaundice and disulfiram like reaction (intolerance to alcohol).* Glimepiride: Sulfonylurea of choice, Have beneficial effects in regard to ischemic preconditioningo Enhances GLUT-4 translocation. o Inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation.* Sequestered in beta cells, Higher incidence of hypoglycemia (maximum with glibenclamide)* Glibenclamide: releases duodenal insulin releasing agent (DIRA), responsible for sustained effect* Gliclazide has additional antiplatelet action, beneficial effect on fibrinolysis.* Glipizide: better control of post prandial hyperglycemia.* Chlorpropamide: now used in diabetes insipidus.* Can precipitate Steven Johnson syndrome, but do not exhibit cross reactivity with sulfonamides Meglitinides: Nateglinide and repaglinide (mainly for post prandial hyperglycemia-\"treat while you eat\")DRUGS ACTING BY OTHER MECHANISMSBiguanides:* Extracted initially from French lilac.* Metformin and phenformin: preferred agents for obese patients (cause weight loss).* Decreases the production (inhibit gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis) and increasing the utilization (stimulation of glycolysis and tissue uptake of glucose).* Actions of metformino Anorexigenic effecto Decreases glucose absorption in intestineo Decreases hepatic gluconeogenesiso Increases the number of insulin receptorso Increases GLUT-4 transporterso Decreases TGL synthesis in livero Facilitates conversion of atherogenic LDL to non atherogenic LDL.* 1st line drug in the management of diabetes; shown to prevent progression of IGT to diabetes* Only anti-diabetic drug approved for pediatric use in USA.* Lactic acidosis-type-B (more with phenformin) and Megaloblastic anemia (more with metformin) due to vitamin B12 deficiency are the major adverse effects of these drugs.* Lactic acidosis is more likely to occur in the presence of hepatic and renal impairment or alcohol ingestion.* Used in PCOD & it is the only drug that reduces macrovascular complications in type-II DM. Thiazolidinediones;* Troglitazone, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone act as agonists of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARy). These drugs increase HDL. (favorable lipid profile)* These drugs are used to reverse insulin resistance in type II DM.* Troglitazone was withdrawn due to serious hepatotoxicity and monitoring of hepatic function is recommended for other glitazones also.* Glitazones are avoided in CHF due to the risk of edema (fuid retention), increases the risk of osteoporotic fractures.* Usually not combined with insulin (d/t weight gain)* Stimulant of ovulation.* Rosiglitazone is associated with increased incidence of Ml & Pioglitazone with bladder Ca.* Increases subcutaneous fat with decreased visceral fat* Thiazolidinedione paradox: improves insulin sensitivity despite increasing subcutaneous adiposity. a-Glucosidase inhibitors:* Inhibitors of a glucosidase (voglibose, acarbose and miglitol) decrease carbohydrate absorption from the GIT.* Not as potent as other oral agents in lowering the A1C but is unique because it reduces the postprandial glucose rise even in individuals with type 1 DM.* Most specific agent for sucrose and maltase enzymes: Voglibose* Major adverse effect - flatulence due to fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates. GLP-1 AGONISTS* Exenatide: a recombinant glucagon like peptide (GLP) analogue. o GLP is normally secreted (in GIT) when food enters the stomach and it stimulates release of insulin. o GLP is normally metabolized by dehydro peptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), o Exenatide is a GLP analogue resistant to DPP-4 and can be used for the treatment of DM. o Major adverse effect: lifr threatening pancreatitis* Liraglutide: o Long-acting GLP-1 agonist, closely related to the native peptide but its tight binding to plasma proteins extends t1/2to > 12 hours and duration of action to >20 hours, o MC adverse effects: nausea and diarrhea. o Use of liraglutide- weight loss & being evaluated as an antiobesity drug even for nondiabetics. o Carries a black box warning because of an increased risk of thyroid C-cell tumors in rodents, o Contraindicated in medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and MEN syndromes. o Hypoglycaemia is rare with exenatide/liraglutide mono-therapy.* Recent drugs: albiglutide, dulaglutide and semaglutide. DPP-4 INHIBITORS* Sitagliptin, Vildagliptin, Linagliptin & Saxagliptin: It is a DPP-4 inhibitor and thus decreases the metabolism of endogenous GLP.* Sitagliptin achieves peak concentrations within 1-4 hours, and has a half-life of 12 hours.* Linagliptin: no dose adjustement needed in renal failure.* The usual dosage is 100 mg orally once daily.* Sitagliptin can be used as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, sulfonylureas, and Tzds.* Therapy with sitagliptin has resulted in HbA lc reductions of between 0. 5% and 1. 0%.* Boosts post prandial insulin release & decreases glucagon secretion.* Nasopharyngitis & cough can occur d/t prevention of Substance-P degradation.* Pancreatitis is rare.* Recent drugs: alogliptin, teneligliptin. NEWER DRUGS* Pramlintide, an analogue of amylin: given parenterally, delays gastric emptying and suppresses glucagon secretion. Reduce postprandial glycemic excursions in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients taking insulin.* Bromocriptine mesylate: alter insulin resistance by acting on hypothalamus & bromocriptine targets D-2 receptors.* Dapagliflozin/canaglifozin: produces round-the-clock glycosuria and lowers blood glucose levels. Resulting glycosuria can predispose to urinary and genital infections, electrolyte imbalance and increased urinary frequency. Contraindicated in renal failure. NOTE:* Colesevelam hydrochloride: Initially developed as a bile acid sequestrant and cholesterol- lowering drug, is now approved as an antihyperglycemic therapy for persons with type 2 diabetes who are taking other medications or have not achieved adequate control with diet and exercise.* Epalrestat: o Sorbitol is a minor metabolite of glucose generated by the enzyme aldose reductase, o In diabetics, excess sorbitol is deposited in nerves and other tissues diabetic neuropathy and other complications. o Epalrestat is an aldose reductase inhibitor - delays sorbitol accumulation & delays progression of diabetic neuropathy. o Nausea, vomiting and elevation of liver enzymes are the adverse effects. Important facts:* Glucose-lowering agents other than insulin (with the exception of amylin analogue and a- glucosidase inhibitors) are ineffective in type 1 DM.* Glucagon is suppressed by: incretin analogues & DPP-IV inhibitors.* All others are used only in type 2 DM.* Injectable drugs for DM: Insulin, Exenatide, Pramlinitide, Liraglutide.* The only bile acid binding resin approved for type 2 DM is cholesevelam.* D2 agonist approved for type 2 DM is Bromocriptine* Weight gain is seen with--Insulin, insulin secretagogues (sulfonyl ureas, meglinitinides), thiazolidinediones* Weight reduction is seen with - Metformin, pramlintide, GLP-l agonist* Weight neutral- DDP4 inhibitors* Alpha glucosidase inhibitor will reduce the progression of IGT to type 2 DM MOAHb.

DPP-IV inhibitors inhibit degradation of native GLP-1 and thus enhance the incretin effect. DPP-IV, which is widely expressed on the cell surface of endothelial cells and some lymphocytes, degrades a wide range of peptides (not GLP-1 specific). DPP-IV inhibitors promote insulin secretion in the absence of hypoglycemia or weight gain, and appear to have a preferential effect on postprandial blood glucose. DPP-IV inhibitors are used either alone or in combination with other oral agents in adults with type 2 DM. Reduced doses should be given to patients with renal insufficiency. These agents have relatively few side effects. Reduction in Hb. A1 C: 0. 5-0. 8 %Do not cause hypoglycaemia. Reduce dose with renal disease.

Maximum FDA recommended dose is 4gm/day* Peak plasma concentration: 30-60 minutes* Half-life: 2 hours* Metabolism of acetaminophen in liver by:# Hepatic conjugation with glucuronic acid (~60%), # Sulfuric acid (~35%), # Cysteine (~3%);# CYP mediated N-hydroxylation to form NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine)* Note: NAPQI is one of the highly reactive intermediate metabolite of acetaminophen metabolism. This usually reacts with sulfhydryl groups is GSH - rendered harmless.* In hepatotoxicity condition GSH level depleted. SIDE EFFECTS* The most serious acute adverse effect of over dosage of acetaminophen is a potentially fatal hepatic necrosis.* Due to hepatotoxicity there is saturation of glucuronide and sulfate conjugation and increasing amounts undergo CYP-mediated N-hydroxylation to form excess of NAPQI (it accumulates due to depletion of GSH).* The highly reactive NAPQI causes enzymatic dysfunction, produces oxidative stress and apoptosis.* In adults hepatotoxicity may occur after ingestion of single dose of 10-15g.

The PPAR receptors are found in muscle, fat and liver. PPAR-g receptors are complex and modulate the expression of the genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism, insulin signal transduction, and adipocyte and other tissue differentiation. Because their MOA involves gene regulation, the Tzds have a slow onset and offset of activity over weeks or even months. Tzds are considered \"euglycemics\" and are efficacious in about 70% of new users. Drugs used for Rx of DM: Glucose-Lowering Therapies for Type 2 Diabetes. Mechanism of Action.

Several drug classes (biguanides, thiazolidinediones ) increase insulin sensitivity. THIAZOLIDINEDIONES# MOA- Thiazolidinediones (Tzds) act to | insulin resistance.- Primary action is the regulation of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation (PPAR receptors).- In persons with diabetes, a major site of Tzd action is adipose tissue, where the drug promotes glucose uptake and utilization and modulates synthesis of lipid hormones or cytokines and other proteins involved in energy regulation.- In addition to targeting adipocytes, myocytes, and hepatocytes, Tzds also have significant effects on vascular endothelium, the immune system, the ovaries, and tumor cells. Some of the responses may be independent of the PPAR-g pathway. 0- Tzds also regulate adipocyte apoptosis and differentiation.# Currently available:- Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone (Troglitazone withdrawn from the market because of hepatic toxicity).- Pioglitazone (PPAR-a as wel as PPAR-g activity): It is absorbed within 2 hours of ingestion;* Food may delay uptake, but total bioavailability is not affected.* Pioglitazone is metabolized by CYP2. C8 and CYP3. A4 to active metabolites.* The bioavailability of numerous other drugs also degraded by these enzymes may be affected by pioglitazone therapy, including estrogen-containing OC pills.* Pioglitazone may be taken once daily; the usual starting dose is 15-30 mg.* The triglyceride lowering effect is more significant than that observed with rosiglitazone, presumably because of its PPAR-a binding characteristics.* Pioglitazone therapy reduces mortality and macrovascular events (myocardial infarction and stroke).* Pioglitazone is approved as a monotherapy and in combination with metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.- Rosiglitazone* Is rapidly absorbed and highly protein-bound.* It is metabolized in the liver to minimally active metabolites, predominantly by CYP2. C8 and to a lesser extent by CYP2. C9.* It is administered once or twice daily; 4-8 mg is the usual total dose.* Rosiglitazone shares the common Tzd adverse effects but does not seem to have any significant drug interactions.* The drug is approved for use in type 2 diabetes as monotherapy or in combination with a biguanide, sulfonylurea, in combination with a biguanide and sulfonylurea, and insulin. Adverse Effects# Fluid retention, which presents as a mild anemia and peripheral edema.# Some reports have suggested an increased risk of heart failure.# Rarely, macular edema has been reported in association with rosiglitazone treatment.# Should not be used during pregnancy or in the presence of significant liver disease (ALT more than 2. 5 upper limit of normal), or if there is a concurrent diagnosis of heart failure.# Anovulatory women may resume ovulation and should be counseled on the increased risk of pregnancy.# Hepatotoxicity has not been associated with rosiglitazone or pioglitazone.# Thiazolidinediones have an emerging benefit in the prevention of type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes.",

        "question": "Which of the following drugs is both anti-receptive and bone formative?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Strontium Ranelate Osteoporosis is an abnormal decrease in amount of bone, but whatever left, is of normal quality. It results from bone loss due to age related changes in bone remodelling. In adult bones, remodelling is the principal metabolic skeletal process. During remodelling the bone is first resorbed by osteoclasts and is then replaced by an equal amount of bone tissue due to action of osteoblasts. This process of bone resorption and formation goes on throughout the adult life, and it serves two purposes. To repair the micro damage within the skeleton. To supply calcium from the skeleton to maintain serum calcium. In young adult the resorbed bone is replaced by an equal amount of new bone tissue. Thus the mass of skeleton remains constant after peak bone mass in achieved in adulthood. However after the age of 35-40 the resorption and formation processes becomes imbalanced and resorption exceeds formation. Excessive bone loss can be due to an increase in osteoclastic activity and or decrease in osteoblastic activity. Mechanism of action of Strontium Ranelate in the t/t of osteoporosis. Strontium Ranelate increases bone mass throughout the skeleton. It appears to be modestly anti resorptive while at the same time not causing much decrease in bone formation. Strontium is incorporated into hydroxyapatite replacing calcium, a feature that might explain some of its fracture benefit.* It is approved in several European countries for the t/t of osteoporosis. Pharmacological agents used to manage osteoporosis either act by. Decreasing the rate of bone resorption (anti resorptive therapy.). Promoting bone formation (anabolic therapy). Since bone remodelling is a coupled process, anti resorptive drugs ultimately decrease the rate of bone formation and therefore do not promote substantial gains in BMD. \"Thus, Strontium ranelate is unique because it decreases osteoblastosis as well as promote bone formation. \"More on t/t of osteoporosis. Pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis is generally aimed at restoring bone strength and preventing fractures. The long standing centrepiece of this approach has been anti resorptive drugs such as: -Biphosphonate. Estrogen. Selective estrogen receptor modulator, Raloxifene. Calcitonin. Until recently, anti resorptive drugs were the only drugs approved in the United States for treating osteoporosis. This situation changed in 2002 when FDA approved Teriparatide (the biologically active PTH fragment). Teriparatide acts by increasing the bone mass. Because teriparatide stimulates bone formation whereas biphosphonates reduce bone resorption, it was predicted that therapy combining the two would enhance the effect on bone marrow density more than treatment with either one alone. However addition of teriparatide to alendronate provided no additional benefit for bone mass density. Before the advent of strontium Ranelate there wasn't any drug which combined the two processes i. e., increasing bone formation and at the same time, decreasing bone resorption. Strontium Ranelate has a novel mechanism of action for an osteoporotic drug as it acts on bone resorption to reduce the rate of bone growth but also acts on bone formation promoting the growth of new bone. More on anti resorptive therapies for osteoporosis: Bisphosphonates. Alendronate, Pamidronate. Most effective drugs currently approved for prevention and t/t of osteoporosis. They suppress bone resorption at doses that do not inhibit mineralization. Thiazide diuretics. They are not strictly anti resorptive but they reduce urinary Ca2+ excretion and constrain bone loss in patients with hypercalciuria. Estrogen. There is an unambiguous relationship between estrogen deficiency and osteoporosis. Post-menopausal status or estrogen deficiency at any stage significantly increases patient's risk for osteoporosis. Selective Estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). These are estrogenic compounds with tissue selective activities. Raloxifene (SERM) acts as an estrogen agonist on bone and liver and is inactive on the uterus. Calcitonin. Calcitonin inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption.",

Explanation: Insulin sensitivity refers to the amount of glucose that can be cleared from the blood with a given dose of insulin Insulin sensitivity may be altered b\\ age. body weight, exercise, diseases and drugs. Active persons are found to be more sensitive to insulin compared to those with sedentary life style. Insulin sensitivity has been found to be inversely related to age with insulin resistance more common in the elderly due to reduced physical activity. In hyperglycemic state, metformin decreases blood glucose by lowering hepatic glucose production and enhancing peripheral glucose uptake. This is attributed to increase in insulin sensitivity and reduction in insulin resistance. Acarbose an u-glucosidase inhibitor by reducing postprandial plasma glucose increases the release of glucoregulatory hormone. GLIM. As a result acarbose increases insulin sensitivity and reduces blood glucose. Easting leads to hypoglycemia which is associated with reduction of insulin secretion and the release of counter regulatory hormones namely epinephrine, glucagon, glucocorticoids etc. Hence the answer to above question is fasting which does not increase insulin sensitivity.",

Lente insulin is a combination of 30% semilente (amorphous) and 70% ultralente (crystalline) insulin zinc suspension.# One of the problems with regular insulin is it peaks 2 to 3 hours after administration and sustains over 6 to 8 hours, which does not mimic the physiological insulin response. This leads to postprandial hyperglycemia and intermittent hypoglycemia. To overcome this, long-acting 'modified' or 'retard' preparations of insulin were developed.# Retard preparations, are obtained by making insulin insoluble either by:# Complexing it with protamine (isophane) or# By precipitating it with excess zinc and increasing the particle size (ultralente, semilente, lente). Insulin-zinc suspension. Isophane (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn or NPH) insulin. Two types of insulin-zinc suspensions have been produced* Protamine is added in a quantity just sufficient to complex all insulin molecules* Neither of the two is present in free form* On S. C. injection, the complex dissociates slowly to yield an intermediate duration of action* Mostly used in combination with regular insulin (70: 30 or 50: 50)1. Ultralente # Large particles # Crystalline # Long-acting # Insoluble in water2. Semilente# Smaller particles# Amorphous# Short acting* Lente = ultralente + semilente in the ratio of 7: 3 (It can be remembered like this: 70% bigger particle and 30% smaller particle)# Therefore lente insulin which is 70% ultralente + 30% semilente can be written in different ways as follows:# 70 % large particle + 30% small particle# 70 % crystalline + 30% amorphous (Answer)# 70 % long acting + 30% short acting# Apart from the above mentioned retard preparations, recently other insulin analogs like rapidly acting (lispro, aspart, glulisine) peakless and long-acting (glargine and detemir) have become available.

Endometrium and cervical mucus may be modified.* The chief use of clomiphene is for infertility due to failure of ovulation: 50 mg once daily for 5 days starting from 5th day of cycle. Treatment is given monthly. Conception occurs in many women who previously were amenorrhoeic or had anovular cycles.* If 1-2 months treatment does not result in conception--the daily dose may be doubled for 2-3 cycles. No more than 6 treatment cycles should be tried.* The antiestrogenic effect of clomiphene on developing follicle, endometrium or cervical mucus can be counterproductive. Luteal phase dysfunction has also been blamed for therapeutic failures.* Addition of menotropins or chorionic gonadotropin on the last 2 days of the course improves the success rate.* Clomiphene is well absorbed orally, gets deposited in adipose tissue and has long t1/2 of ~6 days.

Explanation: Patients with T2. DM have dysfunction in incretin hormones (such as glucagon-like peptide-1 or GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide or GIP). By inhibiting the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) enzyme, it is possible to slow the inactivation of GLP-1 and GIP, promoting blood glucose level decrease in a glucose-dependent manner. Linagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor DPP IV inhibitor. Linagliptin is approved by FDA and EMA for the T2. DM treatment as an anti-hyperglycemic agent that can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other medications (metformin, sulphonylurea, pioglitazone, metformin plus sulphonylurea or insulin). NOTE: Linagliptin is safe in renal failure, as it is eliminated majorly by biliary excretion and it also undergoes enterohepatic recycling. Chemical and metabolic characteristics of DPP-4 inhibitors.

Cutaneous atrophy localized to the site occurs with topical application as well. 3) Hyperglycaemia, may be glycosuria, precipitation of diabetes. 4) Muscular weakness: proximal (shoulder, arm, pelvis, thigh) muscles are primarily affected. Myopathy occurs occasionally, warrants withdrawal of the corticoids. 5) Susceptibility to infection: this is nonspecific for all types of pathogenic organisms. Latent tuberculosis may flare; opportunistic infections with low grade pathogens (Candida, etc.) set in. Delayed healing: of wounds and surgical incisions. 6) Peptic ulceration: risk is doubled; bleeding and silent perforation of ulcers may occur. Dyspeptic symptoms are frequent with high dose therapy. 7 Osteoporosis: especially involving vertebrae and other flat spongy bones. Compression fractures of vertebrae and spontaneous fracture of long bones can occur, especially in the elderly. 8) Posterior subcapsular cataract may develop after several years of use, especially in children. 9) Glaucoma: may develop in susceptible individuals after prolonged topical therapy. 10) Growth retardation: in children occurs even with small doses if given for long periods. Large doses do inhibit GH secretion, but growth retardation may, in addition, be a direct cellular effect of corticoids. Recombinant GH given concurrently can prevent growth retardation, but risk/benefit of such use is not known. 11) Foetal abnormalities: Cleft palate and other defects are produced in animals, but have not been encountered on clinical use in pregnant women. The risk of abortion, stillbirth or neonatal death is not increased, but intrauterine growth retardation can occur after prolonged therapy, and neurological/ behavioral disturbances in the offspring are feared. Prolonged corticosteroid therapy during pregnancy increases the risk of gestational diabetes, pregnancy induced hypertension and preeclampsia. 12) Psychiatric disturbances: mild euphoria frequently accompanies high dose steroid treatment. 13) Suppression of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis: occurs depending both on dose and duration of therapy. In time, adrenal cortex atrophies and stoppage of exogenous steroid precipitates withdrawal syndrome consisting of malaise, fever, anorexia, nausea, postural hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, weakness, pain in muscles and joints and reactivation of the disease for which they were used.

Thyroxine (T4)- 3, 5, 3', 5' - tetraiodothyronine. T3- 3, 5, 3' triiodothy. Tonineo Thyroid hormones are synthesized and stored in the thyroid follicles as a part of thvroglobulin molecule, o Synthesis of thvroid hormones1. Iodide uptakeo First step in the synthesis of T3 & T4 is iodide uptake. o Thyroid cells (follicular cells) have active transport system for iodine uptake - Na+: I- symporter. o This trapping is stimulated by TSH. o The iodide concentrating mechanism (Na+: I- symporter) is also found in skin, salivary glands, gastric mucosa, intestine, mammary glands and placenta, but uptake in these organs is not stimulated by TSH. 2. Oxidation and iodinationo Iodide trapped by follicular cells is transported to colloid. o In colloid it is oxidised by membrane bound thyroid peroxidase to iodinium ion (I+) or hypoiodous acid (HOI) or enzyme - linked hypoiodate (E-OI). o These oxidized forms of iodine combines with tyrosine residues of thvroglobulin to form monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyorosine (DIT) (in this reaction no enzyme is required), o These MIT and DIT are attached to thvroglobulin. 3. Couplingo Pairs of iodinated tyrosine residues couple together to form T3 and T4. o Coupling is an oxidation reaction and is catalysed by same membrane bound thyroid peroxidase, o Normally more T4 is formed than T3. o Oxidation and coupling are stimulated by TSH. 4. Storage and releaseo Thyroglobulin containing MIT, DIT, T3 & T4 is transported into the follicular cells by endocytosis. o Inside the cells thyroglobulin is broken down by lysosomal proteases. o Released T4 & T3 are secreted into the circulation, released MIT and DIT are deiodinated and the iodide released is reutilized. o The uptake (endocytosis) and proteolysis of thyroglobuline are stimulated by TSH. 5. Peripheral conversion of T4 to T3o Peripheral tissues, especially liver and kidney, convert T4 to T3. o Target tissues take up Tj from circulation for their metabolic need, except brain and pituitary which take up T4 and convert it to T3 within their own cells. o Propylthiouracil, propranolol, amiodarone and glucocorticoids inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.",

All the insulin secretagogues increase insulin secretion from the pancreas through the same mechanism i. e., by interfering with potassium channel. All the insulin secretagogues have the potential to cause profound and persistent hypoglycemia especially in elderly individuals. Hypoglycemia is usually related to delayed meals, increased physical activity, alcohol intake or renal insufficiency. Individuals who ingest an overdose of some agents develop prolong and serious hypoglycemia and should be monitored closely in the hospital. Thiazolidinediones (Pioglitazone). Thiazolidinediones are considered \"euglycemic\" and are efficacious in about 70% new users. Combination therapy of thiazolidinediones with sulfonylureas or insulin can lead to hypoglycemia and may require dose adjustment. Biguanides (Metformin Phenformin). Biguanides lower glucose among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus largely by decreasing hepatic glucose output. It is also thought to increase glucose uptake by skeletal muscles. Because insulin secretion is unaltered hypoglycemia is not a side effect of metformin used as monotherapy. Alpha Glucosidase inhibitors (Acarbose). Lowers glucose by inhibiting intestinal enzymes that digest carbohydrate there by reducing carbohydrate digestion. Because of its mechanism of action, acarbose, when administered alone does not cause hypoglucemia in the fasting or postprandial states.
