RaloxifeneThis SERM is different from tamoxifen in that it has antagonistic action on endometrium (Tamoxifen has partial agonistic action) - No risk of endometrial proliferation amd carcinoma.All other actions are same.It is mainly used as first line drug for prevention and treatment of osteoprorosis.4. QrmeloxifeneIt also has antagonistic action on endometrium - has been approved for dysfunctional uterine bleeding.o Fulvestrant - It is a selective estrogen receptor down regulators (SERDs) or pure estrogen antagonist. In contrast to tomoxifen, it inhibits estrogen receptor (ER) dimerization so that ER interaction with DNA is prevented and receptor degradation is enhanced. The ER is thus down regulated resulting in more complete suppresion of ER responsive gene function. It is used for ER positive metastatic breast cancer.",

Lets see.GnRH agonists increases Gn secretion.But after 1 -2 weeks they cause desensitization and down-regulation of FSH/LH receptors, (continous exposure to agonist may cause down regulation of receptors) - suppression of gonadal function.Spermatogenesis/ovulation cease and testosterone/estrogen levels fall to castration level because the action of Gonadotropins (FSH & LH) is not there (these hormones promote gametogenesis and secretion of gonadal hormones).o Preparation of superactive GnRH analogues are - Busereline, Goserelin, Leuprolide, Nafarelin, Triptorelin.o Superactive/Long acting GnRH are used as nasal spray or SC injection.o Cetrorelix, ganirelix and abarelix are GnRh antagonists.

Two SERMS are currently beins usedRaloxifens - For the t/t and prevention of osteoporosisTamoxifen --> For the t/t and prevention of Breast CaThe first SERM to reach the market was Tamoxifen which blocks the stimulative effect of estrogen on breast tissue and is used in breast cancer.Raloxifene is the second SERM to be approved by the FDA.Raloxifens has been approved for the t/t and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.Raloxifens acts like estrogen on bone and helps to build and maintain bone density.Raloxifen has been shown in clinical trials to increase bone density in the spine and hip and to reduce the risk of spinal fractures in women with osteoporosis.While it acts like estrogen on bone, it blocks the action of estrogen on breast and uterus.This profile makes it very useful for the t/t of osteoporosis because Raloxifene provides the bone benefits of estrogen without increasing the risk for estrogen related breast and uterine cancers.Raloxifene in Breast cancerDue to its antiestrogenic effect on breast, Raloxifene has been shown to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in women who are taking it for osteoporosis.Raloxifene reduces the risk of breast cancer by 50-70% in both low risk and high risk postmenopausal women.The national cancer institute U.S.A. funded the STUDY OF TAMOXIFEN AND RALOXIFEN (STAR) a clinical trial comparing raloxifens with tamoxifen in preventing breast cancer, in postmenopausal women who are at increased risk of developing the disease.The study found that tamoxifen and Raloxifen are equally effective in reducing invasive breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women who are at increased risk of the disease.The study also found out that women who took raloxifen had fewer uterine cancer and fewer blood clots than women who took tamoxifen. However, Raloxifen did not decrease the risk of noninvasive breast Ca.On September 14 2007, the U.S. food and drus administration announced approval of raloxifens for reducing the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and in postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive cancer.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., Aromatase inhibitors Aromatase inhibitorso Aromatase inhibitors are drugs which inhibit the enzyme Aromatase.o Aromatase is an enzyme responsible for the conversion of testosterone (androgens) to estrogens.o This conversion of androgens to estrogens occur in several tissues including ovary, adrenal cortex, peripheral tissues.o Inhibition of Aromatase leads to decrease in estrogen level.o Aromatase inhibitors prevent the conversion of androgens to estrogens only in postmenopausal women, not in premenopausal women.o In premenopausal women, as the level of estrogens decrease it activates the pituitary hypothalamic axis. Activation of pituitary hypothalamic axis leads to increased secretion of pituitary gonadotropins. The pituitary gonadotropins inturn increase the secretion of estrogens. Thus the estrogen level returns back to their normal level.o On the other hand aromatase inhibitors effectively decrease the secretion of estrogen in postmenopausal women.o In postmenopausal women, the production of estrogen from androgens occurs, only in extraovarian sites such as peripheral tissues where the conversion of androgens to estrogens is blocked by aromatase inhibitors.Use of aromatase inhibitorso Aromatase inhibitors are used in the t/t of Hormone receptor positive breast carcinomas in postmenopausal women. They are not effective in premenopausal women.How are Aromatase inhibitors useful in Breast carcinomas ?o In breast carcinomas, estrogen delivers growth signals to the hormone receptors. The hormone receptors upon receiving the growth signals, cause the proliferation of tumor cells,o After the inhibition by aromatase inhibitors, estrogen level decreases, this leads to lesser delivery of growth signals and in turn lesser proliferation of tumor cells.Aromatase inhibitors are of two types :o Type I (steroidal) aromatase inhibitor - They cause irreversible inhibition of aromatase, e.g. Exmestane. formestane.o Type II (non-steroidal) aromatase inhibitor - They cause reversible inhibition of aromatase e.g. Anastrazole, Letrozole, vorozale.o Above classification is based on chemical structure (steroidal or non-steroidal ) and type of inhibition (reversible or irreversible). Based on the evolution the aromatase inibitors are:First generation - AminoglotethimideSecond generation - Steroidal type I(Example, formestane), non-steroidal type II (Anastrazole, Letrozole, Vorozole, fadrozole)o Side effects - Hot flushes, nausea, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, thinning of hair and Joint Pain (Arthralgia) and increased risk of fracture.o There is no endometrial proliferation (no risk of endometrial carcinoma), no risk of venous thromboembolism and no deterioration of lipid profile.Remembero Anastrozole and letrozole are nonsteroidol compound, while exemestane is steroidol.o Exemestane also has weak androgenic activity',o Anastrozole is more potent than letrozole.o First generation aromatase inhibitors - Aminoglutethimide.o Second generation aromatase inhibitors - Letrozole, anastrozole, fadrozole and exemestone.",
