Substance P acts on these receptors and is responsible for chemotheraphy induced nausea and vomiting. Aprepitant acts as a substance P antagonist on NK1 receptors. o Aprepitant has little or no affinity for Serotonin 5-HT3, dopamine or corticosteroid receptors, o Aprepitant crosses the blood brain barrier. o Aprepitant is used for chemotherapy induced nausea & vomiting (CINV), and post- operative nausea & vomiting (PONV). o After absorption aprepitant is bound extensively to plasma proteins (>95%); it is metabolized avidly, primarily by hepatic CYP 5. A4 and is excreted in the stools. o Aprepitant is contraindicated in patients on cisapride or pimozide, in which life threatening QT prolongation has been reported. o The recommended adult dose of a prepitant is 125 mg administered 1 hour before chemotherapy on day one, followed by 8 mg once daily in the morning on day 2 and 3 of the treatment regimen.",
