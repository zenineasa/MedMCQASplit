        "exp": "Prolactin is inhibited by dopamine, so, any drug which blocks D2 recptor will lead to increase in prolactin. Anti-psychotics are D2 blocking drugs. They are of two types: * Typical anti-psychotic drug are amily D2 blocker. * Atypical anti-psychotics are mainly 5HT2 blocker but among them the maximum D2 blocking action is caused by Resperidone. So, Resperidone has the maximum chance of causing hyerprolactinema and also the maximum chance of causing EPS(Extra pyramidal symptoms) among the atypical anti-psychotics. Clozapine and Olanzapine are 5HT2 and D2 blocker. Aripiprazole is D2 paial agonist so, no chances of hyper-prolactinemia.",
