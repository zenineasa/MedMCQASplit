It does so, of course, by inhibiting both COX-I and -2. Acetaminophen lacks this propey, and so acetaminophen is much less efficacious for managing inflammation. Aspirin and acetaminophen are equally efficacious (and, for all practical purposes, equipotent) for relieving the simple headache for most patients. (Note, however, when pain involves a component of inflammation, aspirin is clearly superior to acetaminophen because it suppresses both the inflammation and the pain caused by it.) Aspirin usually helps normalize or lower body temperature in febrile states, but this, too, involves inhibited synthesis of prostaglandins (peripherally perhaps, leading to increased heat loss through diaphoresis, but also in such central structures as the hypothalamus, which is a prime temperature regulating structure). Aspirin does not exe bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects (at any level encountered in vivo), and so antibiotic effects do not contribute to its antipyretic actions. Although aspirin is an effective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, it has no effects on the lipoxygenase pathway that leads to leukotriene synthesis. It does not affect uric acid synthesis (xanthine oxidase) at all. Ref: KD Tripathi 8th ed.",

Analgesic-antipyretics with poor anti-inflammatory action 1.para aminophenol derivatives: Paracetamol 2.Pyrazolone derivative: Metamizole, Propyphenazone. 3.Benzoxazine derivative: Nefopam Mechanism of action of NSAIDs 1.Anti-inflammatory effect due to the inhibition of the enzymes that produce prostaglandin H synthase (cyclooxygenase, or COX), which conves arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, and to TXA2 and prostacyclin. Aspirin irreversibly inactivates COX-1 and COX-2 by acetylation of a specific serine residue. This distinguishes it from other NSAIDs, which reversibly inhibit COX-1 and COX-2. 2.Analgesic effect A. The analgesic effect of NSAIDs is thought to be related to: the peripheral inhibition of prostaglandin production may also be due to the inhibition of pain stimuli at a subcoical site. B.NSAIDs prevent the potentiating action of prostaglandins on endogenous mediators of peripheral nerve stimulation (e.g., bradykinin). 3.Antipyretic effect The antipyretic effect of NSAIDs is believed to be related to: inhibition of production of prostaglandins induced by interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the hypothalamus the \"resetting\" of the thermoregulatory system, leading to vasodilatation and increased heat loss ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY;7TH EDITION;KD TRIPATHI;PAGE NO;193",

Mech of peptic ulcer formation:- Inhibition of COX-1 mediated synthesis of gastroprotective PGs (PGE2, PGI2) is clearly involved. Deficiency of PGs reduces mucus and HCO3- secrection, tends to enhance acid secretion and may promote mucosal ischaemia. Thus, NSAIDs enhance aggressive factors and contain defensive factors in gastric mucosa--are ulcerogenic. Paracetamol, a very weak inhibitor of COX is practically free of gastric toxicity and selective COX-2 inhibitors are relatively safer.

        "exp": "Aspirin: Aspirin is Acetylsalicylic acid which conves to salicylic acid in body ACTIONS 1.Analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory actions: Aspirin is a weaker analgesic than morphine-type drugs. Aspirin 600 mg < Codeine 60 mg < 6 mg Morphine it effectively relieves inflammation, tissue injury, connective tissue, and integumental pain, but is relatively ineffective in severe visceral and ischaemic pain. The analgesic action is mainly due to obtunding of peripheral pain receptors and prevention of PG-mediated sensitization of nerve endings. No sedation, subjective effects, tolerance or physical dependence is produced. Aspirin resets the hypothalamic thermostat and rapidly reduces fever by promoting heat loss, but does not decrease heat production. Anti-inflammatory action is exeed at high doses (3-6 g/ day or 100 mg/kg/ day) 2. Metabolic effects: significant only at anti-inflammatory doses Cellular metabolism is increased, especially in skeletal muscles, due to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation leads to increased heat production. There is increased utilization of glucose leads to blood sugar may decrease (especially in diabetics) and liver glycogen is depleted. Chronic use of large doses cause negative N2 balance by increased conversion of protein to carbohydrate. Plasma free fatty acid and cholesterol levels are reduced. 3.Respiration: Effects are dose-dependent. At antiinflammatory doses, respiration is stimulated by peripheral (increased C02 production) and central (increased sensitivity of respiratory center to C02) actions. Hyperventilation is prominent in salicylate poisoning. The fuher rise in salicylate level causes respiratory depression; death is due to respiratory failure. 4. Acid-base and electrolyte balance: Antiinflammatory doses produce significant changes in the acid-base and electrolyte composition of body fluids. Initially, respiratory stimulation predominates and tends to wash out C02 despite increased production ....respiratory alkalosis, which is compensated by increased renal excretion of HCO3; (with accompanying Na+, K+, and water). Still higher doses cause respiratory depression with C02 retention, while excess C02 production continues.... respiratory acidosis. 5.CVS: Aspirin has no direct effect in therapeutic doses. Larger doses increase cardiac output to meet increased peripheral O2 demand and cause direct vasodilatation. Toxic doses depress vasomotor center: BP may fall. Because of increased cardiac work as well as Na+ and water retention, CHF may be precipitated in patients with low cardiac reserve. 6.GIT: Aspirin and released salicylic acid irritate gastric mucosa, cause epigastric distress, nausea, and vomiting. It also stimulates CTZ. 7.Urate excretion: Aspirin in high dose reduces renal tubular excretion of urate 8. Blood: Aspirin, even in small doses, irreversibly inhibits TXA2 synthesis by platelets. Thus, it interferes with platelet aggregation and bleeding time is prolonged to nearly twice the normal value. long-term intake of large dose decreases synthesis of clotting factors in liver and predisposes to bleeding; can be prevented by prophylactic vit K therapy.

        "question": "Select the drug which is neither analgesic, nor anti- inflammatory, nor uricosuric, but is highly efficacious in acute gout",
        "exp": "Colchicine Colchicine is neither analgesic nor anti- inflammatory, but it specifically suppresses gouty inflammation. It does not inhibit the synthesis or promote the excretion of uric acid. Thus, it has no effect on blood uric acid levels. pathophysiology of gout:- An acute attack of gout is staed by the precipitation of urate crystals in the synol fluid. On being engulfed by the synol cells, they release mediators and sta an inflammatory response. Chemotactic factors are produced - granulocyte migration into the joint; they phagocytose urate crystals and release a glycoprotein which aggravates the inflammation by: (i) Increasing lactic acid production from inflammatory cells - local pH is reduced - more urate crystals are precipitated in the affected joint. (ii) Releasing lysosomal enzymes which cause joint destruction. mech of action of colchicine:- Colchicine does not affect phagocytosis of urate crystals, but inhibits release of chemotactic factors and of the glycoprotein, thus suppressing the subsequent events. By binding to fibrillar protein tubulin, it inhibits granulocyte migration into the inflamed joint and thus interrupts the vicious cycle Toxicity:- Nausea, vomiting, watery or bloody diarrhoea and abdominal cramps occur as dose limiting adverse effects.
