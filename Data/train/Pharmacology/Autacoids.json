        "exp": "Aspirin inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins that are impoant in the pathophysiology, signs, and symptoms of a host of inflammatory or ahritic states. It does so, of course, by inhibiting both COX-I and -2. Acetaminophen lacks this propey, and so acetaminophen is much less efficacious for managing inflammation. Aspirin and acetaminophen are equally efficacious (and, for all practical purposes, equipotent) for relieving the simple headache for most patients. (Note, however, when pain involves a component of inflammation, aspirin is clearly superior to acetaminophen because it suppresses both the inflammation and the pain caused by it.) Aspirin usually helps normalize or lower body temperature in febrile states, but this, too, involves inhibited synthesis of prostaglandins (peripherally perhaps, leading to increased heat loss through diaphoresis, but also in such central structures as the hypothalamus, which is a prime temperature regulating structure). Aspirin does not exe bacteriostatic or bactericidal effects (at any level encountered in vivo), and so antibiotic effects do not contribute to its antipyretic actions. Although aspirin is an effective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, it has no effects on the lipoxygenase pathway that leads to leukotriene synthesis. It does not affect uric acid synthesis (xanthine oxidase) at all. Ref: KD Tripathi 8th ed.",

        "exp": "Colchicine Colchicine is neither analgesic nor anti- inflammatory, but it specifically suppresses gouty inflammation. It does not inhibit the synthesis or promote the excretion of uric acid. Thus, it has no effect on blood uric acid levels. pathophysiology of gout:- An acute attack of gout is staed by the precipitation of urate crystals in the synol fluid. On being engulfed by the synol cells, they release mediators and sta an inflammatory response. Chemotactic factors are produced - granulocyte migration into the joint; they phagocytose urate crystals and release a glycoprotein which aggravates the inflammation by: (i) Increasing lactic acid production from inflammatory cells - local pH is reduced - more urate crystals are precipitated in the affected joint. (ii) Releasing lysosomal enzymes which cause joint destruction. mech of action of colchicine:- Colchicine does not affect phagocytosis of urate crystals, but inhibits release of chemotactic factors and of the glycoprotein, thus suppressing the subsequent events. By binding to fibrillar protein tubulin, it inhibits granulocyte migration into the inflamed joint and thus interrupts the vicious cycle Toxicity:- Nausea, vomiting, watery or bloody diarrhoea and abdominal cramps occur as dose limiting adverse effects.
