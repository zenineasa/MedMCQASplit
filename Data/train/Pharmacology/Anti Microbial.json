Of these drugs, only rifampin is bactericidal.* The sulfones (folate antagonists), the foremost of which is dapsone, were the first antimicrobial agents found to be effective for the treatment of leprosy and are still the mainstay of therapy.* Other antimicrobial agents active against M. leprae in animal models and at the usual daily doses used in clinical trials include ethionamide/prothionamide; the aminoglycosides streptomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin (but not gentamicin or tobramycin); minocycline; clarithromycin; and several fluoroquinolones, particularly preferred is ofloxacin.* Next to rifampin, minocycline, clarithromycin, and ofloxacin appear to be most bactericidal for M. leprae, but these drugs have not been used extensively in leprosy control programs. Most recently, rifapentine and moxifloxacin have been found to be especially potent against M. leprae in mice.

Enterococci are resistant to all cephalosporins; therefore this class of antibiotics should not be used for treatment of enterococcal infections. Usual treatment for enterococci is combination of penicillin or ampicillin with an aminoglycoside. If patient is penicillin allergic, vancomycin can be used instead. Treatment options for anti biotic-resistant enterococcal infections. Resistance Pattern. Beta-Lactamase production. Recommended Therapy. Gentamicin plus ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanate, imipenem, or vancomycin. Beta-Lactam resistance, but no beta-lactamase production. Gentamicin plus vancomycin. High-level gentamicin resistance. Streptomycin-sensitive isolate: Streptomycin plus ampicillin or vancomycin. Streptomycin-resistant isolate; No proven therapy(continuous-infusion ampicillin, prolonged treatment). Vancomycin resistance. Ampicillin plus gentamicin. Vancomycin and beta-lactam resistance. No uniformly bactericidal drugs; linezolid (all enterococci) or quinupristin/dalfopristin ( only). Linezolid is a member of the oxazolidinediones, a new class of synthetic antimicrobials. It is active against gram-positive organisms including staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, gram-positive anaerobic cocci, and gram-positive rods such as corynebacteria and Listeria monocytogenes. It is primarily a bacteriostatic agent except for streptococci, for which it is bactericidal. The principal toxicity of linezolid is hematologic-reversible and generally mild. Thrombocytopenia is the most common manifestation. Neutropenia may also occur, most commonly in patients with a predisposition to or underlying bone mairow suppression. Linezolid is 100% bioavailable after oral administration. Linezolid is approved for vancomycin-resistant E. faeciuminfections; nosocomial pneumonia; community- acquired pneumonia; and skin infections, complicated or uncomplicated. It should be reserved for treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. TEICOPLANINTeicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is very similar to vancomycin in mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum. It can be given intramuscularly as well as intravenously.

ISONIAZID* It is primarily tuberculocidal. Fast multiplying organisms are rapidly killed but quiescent ones are only inhibited.* Acts on intracellular as well as extracellular TB bacilli and is equally active in acidic and alkaline medium.* MOA: Inhibit synthesis of mycolic acid, which is a unique fatty acid component of mycobacterial cell wall.* If given alone, resistance occurs in about 2-3 months* Most common mechanism of INH resistance: Mutation of catalase-peroxidase gene > Mutation of inh-A gene.* Adverse effects:# Isoniazid-induced hepatitis is the most common major toxic effect# Peripheral neuropathy is observed in 10-20% of patients# Neuropathy is due to a relative pyridoxine (Vit B6) deficiency. Isoniazid promotes excretion of pyridoxine, and this toxicity is readily reversed by administration of pyridoxine.# Central nervous system toxicity, which is less common, includes memory loss, psychosis, and seizures. PYRAZINAMIDE* It is weakly tuberculocidal. PYZ is more lethal to intracellularly located bacilli and to those at sites showing an inflammatory response.* MOA: Resembles that of INH. It inhibits mycolic acid synthesis but by interacting with a different fatty acid synthase encoding gene.* Resistance of PYZ due to mutation in pncA gene.* Adverse effects: Hepatotoxicity, nausea, vomiting, drug fever, and hyperuricemia. ETHAMBUTOL* Selectively tubecolostatic agent and clinically as active as streptomycin. Fast multiplying bacilli are more susceptible as are many atypical mycobacteria.* MOA: Poorly understood, but it has been found to inhibit arabinosyl transferases involved in arabinogalactan synthesis and to interfere with mycolic acid incorporation in mycobacterial cell wall.* Resistance of ethambutol due to alteration in the drug target gene- emb gene.* Adverse effects: Retrobulbar neuritis, resulting in loss of visual acuity and red-green color blindness. STREPTOMYCIN* Tuberculocidal agent, acts only on extracellular bacilli. It penetrates the tubercular cavities but doesn't crosses the CSF. Has poor action on acidic medium.* Adverse effects: Ototoxic and nephrotoxic.* Resistance is due to a point mutation in either the rpsL gene or rrs gene.",

RIFAMPICINIntroduction# Rifampin is a semisynthetic derivative of Streptomyces mediterranei.# It is considered the most important and potent antituberculous agent.# It is also active against a wide spectrum of other organisms, including some gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, Legionella spp., M. kansasii, and M. marinum. Pharmacology# Rifampin is a fat-soluble complex macrocyclic antibiotic that is absorbed readily after either oral or intravenous administration.# Serum levels of 10 to 20 pg/mL follow a standard adult oral dose of 600 mg.# Rifampin distributes well throughout most body tissues, including inflamed meninges.# The fact that rifampin turns body fluids (urine, saliva, sputum, tears) a red-orange color makes it simple and inexpensive to check on patients' compliance with therapy. 0# Rifampin is excreted primarily through the bile and the enterohepatic circulation, while 30 to 40% of a dose is excreted via the kidneys. 0# The drug is administered either twice weekly or daily at a dose of 600 mg for adults (10 mg/kg) and 10 to 20 mg/kg for children. Adverse Effects# The most common adverse event is gastrointestinal upset.# Hepatitis.# Rash (0. 8%), -Hemolytic anemia (<1%), -Thrombocytopenia, and -Immunosuppression of unknown importance.# Rifampin is a potent inducer of the hepatic microsomal enzymes and thereby decreases the half-life of a number of drugs, including digoxin, warfarin, prednisone, cyclosporine, methadone, oral contraceptives, clarithromycin, the HIV protease inhibitors, the HIV nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and quinidine.

Oxacillin - resistant Staphylococcus spp. Aminoglycosides (except high concentrations), cephalosporins, Clindamycin & trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole. Enterococcus spp.#Important resistance mechanisms to beta lactam antibiotics: Beta lactamase Resistance: Many bacteria produce enzymes that are capable of destroying the beta-lactam ring of penicillin, these enzymes are referred to as penicillinases or beta-lactamases and they make the bacteria that possess them resistant to many penicillins. Clavulanic acid is inhibits beta-lactamase enzymes, thereby increasing the longevity of beta-lactam antibiotics in the presence of penicillinase-producing bacteria. Clavamox is a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate. Combination of the beta-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam and piperacillin. Summary of beta lactam / beta lactamase inhibitor on treatment of ESBL - producing organisms: Limited clinical information: Class A ESBLs are susceptible to clavulanate & tazobactam in vitro, nevertheless many producers are resistant to beta lactamase inhibitor due to:-Hyperproduction of the ESBLs - overwhelm inhibitor.-Co-production of inhibitor-resistant penicillinases (E. g., OXA-1) or AmpC enzyme.-Relative impermeability of the host strain. Beta-lactam/beta lactamase inhibitor should not be used not be used to treat serious infections with ESBL producing organisms. Beta lactamase inhibitors: Almost all have weak antibacterial activitiy. Important in combination with penicillins sensitive to beta lactamase degradation. Clavulanic acid is the first one of this class. Natural product from streptomyces. Has a powerful & irreversible inhibition of beta lactamase enzymes because it will covalently bind to two positions in the active site. Normally used in combination with amoxicillin & other beta lactamase sensitive penicillins. Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL): Enzymes that are produced by Gram negative bacteria. Confer resistance to Cephalosporins, Penicillins & Monobactam (Aztreonam) by opening the beta lactam ring inactivating the antibiotic. Cannot attack Cephamycins (cefoxitin, cefotetan) or the carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, doripe- nem). Generally susceptible to beta-lactamase inhibitors (Tazobactam). Plasmid mediated TEM, SHV, CTX-M beta lactamases are the most common. Therapy for ESBL producing gram negative rods: Carbapenems: Imipenem, Macropenem, Doripenem, Ertapenem. Piperacillin / Tazobactam - Tazobactam blocks beta lactamase action. Beta lactam / beta lactamase inhibitor on treatment of ESBL - producing organisms: Most ESBLs are susceptible to clavulanate & tazobactam in vitro. Nevertheless some ESBL producers are resistant to beta lactamase inhibitor due to: Hyperproduction of the ESBLs - overwhelm inhibitor. Co-production of inhibitor - resistent penicillinases or AmpC enzyme. Relative impermeability of the host strain.

Resistance to penicillins and other b-lactams is due to one of four general mechanisms: (1) inactivation of antibiotic by b-lactamase, (2) modification of target PBPs, (3) impaired penetration of drug to target PBPs, and (4) efflux. b-Lactamase production is the most common mechanism of resistance. Altered target PBPs (penicillin binding proteins)are the basis of methicillin resistance in staphylococci and of penicillin resistance in pneumococci and enterococci. Resistance due to impaired penetration of antibiotic to target PBPs occurs only in gram-negative species because of their impermeable outer cell wall membrane, which is absent in gram-positive bacteria. Notes. Piperacillin in combination with a beta- lactamase inhibitor (piperacillin -tazobactam) has the broadest antibacterial spectrum of the penicillins. Piperacillin is most effective anti-pseudomonal penicillin.",

To measure the PAE of an antibiotic ca test culture is first incubated in antibiotic containing medium anfd then transferred to antibiotic free medium. PAE is defined as the length of time it takes (after the transfer) for the culture to acheeve log phase growth. Antimicrobial drugs exhibiting a long PAE (several hours) often require only one dose per day. For example aminoglycosides and fluoroquinilones, exhibit a long PAE, particularly against gram negative bacteria.

Unlike rifampicin. Rifabutin (as compared to rifampicin) is* Less effective against TB* More effective against MAC* Longer acting, ti/2 (45 hours)* Less potential to induce microsomal enzymes* Donot require dose adjustment in liver disease. RIFAPENTIN:* Similar in action to rifampicin and shows cross resistance to rifampicin.* Potent Inducer of cytochrome P-450. Can cause light chain proteinuria.* Metabolized to 25-desacetyl rifapentin.* Should not be used in HIV individuals as it leads to drug resistance & more prone for toxicity. RIFAXIMIN: indicated for traveler's diarrhea (E. coli) & hepatic encephalopathy. OTHER DRUGS* Thiacetazone: tuberculostatic drug. Major adverse effects include hepatitis, bone marrow suppression and Steven Johnson syndrome (not used in HIV positive patients).* Para amino salicylic acid (PAS): bacteriostatic. It can cause kidney, liver and thyroid dysfunction.* Cycloserine is a cell wall synthesis inhibiting drug and can cause neuropsychiatric adverse effects.* Kanamycin, capreomycin and amikacin are injectable aminoglycosides, used in MDR tuberculosis.* Ethionamide: tuberculostatic can cause hepatitis, optic neuritis and impotence. Also used in leprosy. o Ethionamide also inhibit mycolic acid biosynthesis with consequent impairment of cell-wall synthesis. o Resistance can develop rapidly in vivo when ethionamide is used as a single-agent treatment, including low-level cross-resistance to isoniazid.* Fluoroquinolones: ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, moxifloxacin& sparfloxacin. Effective against MAC in AIDS patients.* Newer macrolides like azithromycin and clarithromycin are effective against non-tubercular atypical mycobacteria.* Bedaquiline is an inhibitor of mycobacterial ATP synthase. It is indicated as a part of MDT in adults with pulmonary MDR-TB. It can cause QT prolongation. MULTI DRUG RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS (MDR-TB)* Resistance to both Isoniazid & Rifampicin and may be any number of other anti-TB drugs.* Treatment is mainly based on culture sensitivity.* Usually fluoroquinolones are added.* For H resistance: RZE is given for 12 months.* For H+R resistance: ZE + S/ Kanamycin/Amikacin/ Capreomycin + cipro/Ofloxacin + Ethionamide. EXTENSIVELY DRUG RESISTANT TUBERCULOSIS (XDR-TB)* Resistance to four most effective drugs: H, R, a fluoroquinolone, one of Kanamycin/Amikacin/ Capreomycin and may be any number of other anti-TB drugs* Virtually untreatable: high mortality, particularly among HIV positive patients.",

Antibiotics for treatment of Toxic shock syndrome (TSS)TSS is usually managed in the intensive care setting and the main line of management is supportive management along with appropriate antibiotic therapy to eradicate Staph, aureus which is mostly the causative organism. Because of the increasing frequency of methicillin-resistant Staphylococci in the community, vancomycin is often recommended*. Beta lactamase resistant penicillins are not very effective due to emerging resistance and they may increase TSST-1 production in vitro probably due to cell lysis. Hence, if they are prescribed they are usually coprescribed with clindamycin which inhibits bacterial protein toxin production. Other treatment options are a combination of vancomycin and clindamycin for suspected serious staphylococcal infections pending culture and sensitivity. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; which presumably acts in part via neutralizing antibodies against toxins) has been used and appears to have significant promise. At present, IVIG is used in severe or recalcitrant cases. Treatment of choice: Vancomycin (15 mg/kg q12h) plus Clindamycin (600 mg q8h).

RNA sequence for the major immediate--early region of CMV and inhibits CMV replication through sequence- specific and nonspecific mechanisms, including inhibition of vims binding to cells. Fomivirsen is active against CMV strains resistant to ganciclovir, foscamet, and cidofovir. Fomivirsen is given by intravitreal injection for patients intolerant or unresponsive to other therapies for CMV retinitis. Following injection, it is cleared from the vitreous humor with a t|/2of ~55 hours through distribution to the retina and probably local exonuclease digestion. In HIV infected patients with refractory, sight- threatening CMV retinitis, fomivirsen injections significantly delay retinitis progression. Ocular side effects include iritis in up to 25% of patients, which can be managed with topical glucocorticoids, vitritis, cataracts, and increased intraocular pressure in 15-20% of patients. Recent cidofovir use may increase the risk of inflammatory reactions. Notes on antiviral therapy. Intravenous acyclovir is the treatment of choice for herpes simplex encephalitis, neonatal HSV infection, and serious HSV or VZV infections. Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope in the A antigen site on the F surface protein of RSV. It is licensed for the prevention of RSV infection in high-risk infants and children such as premature infants and those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital heart disease. Intravenous foscamet is used for CMV retinitis, including ganciclovir-resistant infections, other types of CMV infection, and acyclovir-resistant HSV and VZV infections. Foscamet's major dose-limiting toxicides are nephrotoxicity and hypocalcemia. The neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir, analogs of sialic acid, interfere with release of progeny influenza virus from infected to new host cells, thus halting the spread of infection within the respiratory tract. Unlike amantadine and rimantadine, zanamivir and oseltamivir have activity against both influenza A and influenza B viruses.",

RNA Tetracyclineso Tetracyclines are classified into three groups -# Group 1 - Tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline.# Group II - Lymecycline, Demeclocycline.# Group III - Minocycline, Doxycycline. o Tetracyclines are bacteriostatic and broad spectrum antibiotics. o Tetracycline interact with small ribosomal subunits, blacking access of aminoacyl- t. RNA to the nu. RNA-ribos- ome complex. o Oral absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by food except doxycycline and minocycline which are absorbed completely irrespective of food. o Most tetracyclines are primarily excreted in urine by glomerular filtration; dose has to be reduced in renal failure; doxycycline is an exception - doxycycline can be used in renal failure. o Tetracyclines can cross placenta and secreted in milk - contraindicated during pregnancy and lactation.",
