Q# It should not be used in diabetics. Mechanism of Action# Niacin inhibits VLDL secretion, in turn decreasing production of LDL.# Increased clearance of VLDL via the LPL pathway contributes to triglyceride reduction.# Niacin has no effect on bile acid production.# Excretion of neutral sterols in the stool is increased acutely as cholesterol is mobilized from tissue pools and a new steady state is reached. The catabolic rate for HDL is decreased.# Fibrinogen levels are reduced, and levels of tissue plasminogen activator appear to increase.# Niacin inhibits the intracellular lipase of adipose tissue via receptor-mediated signaling, possibly reducing VLDL production by decreasing the flux of free fatty acids to liver.# Nicotinic acid decreases both LDL-C and VLDL-C, while raising plasma HDL1-C, and is frequently effective for this condition when used in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.# Niacin is the only currently available lipid-lowering drug that significantly reduces plasma levels of LP(a), # It is the most effective drug currently available for raising HDL-C levels. Therapeutic Uses & Dosage# In combination with a resin or reductase inhibitor, niacin normalizes LDL in most patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and other forms of hypercholesterolemia.# These combinations are also indicated in some cases of nephrosis.# In severe mixed lipemia that is incompletely responsive to diet, niacin often produces marked reduction of triglycerides, an effect enhanced by marine omega-3 fatty acids.# It is useful in patients with combined hyperlipoproteinemia and in those with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.# Niacin reduces levels of LP(a) in many subjects.# It is clearly the most effective agent for increasing levels of HDL.# For treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, most patients require 2-6 g of niacin daily.# It is contraindicated in diabetics.# It is particularly useful in patients with combined hyperlipidemia and low plasma levels of HDL-C and is effective in combination with statins. Toxidty# Qraneous vasodilation and sensation of warmth after each dose# Tachyphylaxis# Pruntus, rashes, dry skin or mucous membranes, and acanthosis nigricans# Niacin should be avoided in patients with severe peptic disease.# Rarelj, true hepatotoxicity may occur and is an indication for discontinuing the drug.# Niacin may be given to diabetics who are receiving insulin and to some receiving oral agents if insulin resistance is not increased.# Hyperuricemia occurs in some patients.# Rarely, mein is associated with arrhythmias, mostly atrial, and a reversible toxic amblyopia.# Patients should be instructed to report blurring of distance vision.# Niacin may potentiate the action of antihypertensive agents, requiring adjustment of their dosages.# Dryness cf mucous membranes is occasional.

Cholesterol ivithin the lumen of the small intestine is derived from the diet (about one-third) and the bile (about two-thirds) and is actively absorbed by the enter ocyte through a process that involves the protein N PCI LI. Ezetimibe is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor that binds directly to and inhibits NPCILI and blocks the intestinal absorption of cholesterol. Ezetimibe (10 mg) inhibits cholesterol absorption by almost 60%, resulting in a reduction in delivery of dietary sterols in the liver and an increase in hepatic LDL receptor expression. The mean reduction in plasma LDL-C on Ezetimibe (10 mg) is 18%, and the effect is additive when used in combination with a statin. Effects on triglyceride and HDL-C levels are negligible, and no cardiovascular outcome data have been reported. When used in combination with a statin, monitoring of liver transaminases is recommended. The only role for Ezetimibe in monotherapy is in patients who do not tolerate statins; the drug is often added to a statin in patients who require further LDL-C reduction.",

Additional Educational Points# HMG-CoA like Lovastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin are most effective in reducing LDL. Other effects include decreased oxidative stress and vascular inflammation with increased stability of atherosclerotic lesions. 2# FIBRIC ACID DERIVATIVES (FIBRATES) like Gemfibrozil and fenofibrate decrease levels of VLDL and, in some patients, LDL as well. Their effect is exerted through PPAR-a. Fibrates are drug class of choice in severe hypertriglyceridemia & firs dine in moderate hypertriglyceridemia). Q In a patient with poor glycemic control, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, fibrates would be best drug for Rx without the risk of myositis. In diabetics, fibrates have some efficacy and should be considered when the HDL is low in the setting of a mild elevation of the LDL. Myopathy is uncommon with fibrates.# Niacin (but not niacinamide) decreases VLDL and LDL levels, and Lp(a) in most patients. It often increases HDL levels significantly (highest efficacy to increase HDL) 0/f significantly increases lipoprotein-a levels. 0 Niacin is the most effective available HDL-C-raising therapeutic agent and can be associated with increases in plasma HDL-C by up to -30%. 0# High doses (>2 g/d) may worsen glycemic control and increase insulin resistance.
