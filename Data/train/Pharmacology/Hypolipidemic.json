The catabolic rate for HDL is decreased.# Fibrinogen levels are reduced, and levels of tissue plasminogen activator appear to increase.# Niacin inhibits the intracellular lipase of adipose tissue via receptor-mediated signaling, possibly reducing VLDL production by decreasing the flux of free fatty acids to liver.# Nicotinic acid decreases both LDL-C and VLDL-C, while raising plasma HDL1-C, and is frequently effective for this condition when used in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.# Niacin is the only currently available lipid-lowering drug that significantly reduces plasma levels of LP(a),# It is the most effective drug currently available for raising HDL-C levels.Therapeutic Uses & Dosage# In combination with a resin or reductase inhibitor, niacin normalizes LDL in most patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and other forms of hypercholesterolemia.# These combinations are also indicated in some cases of nephrosis.# In severe mixed lipemia that is incompletely responsive to diet, niacin often produces marked reduction of triglycerides, an effect enhanced by marine omega-3 fatty acids.# It is useful in patients with combined hyperlipoproteinemia and in those with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.# Niacin reduces levels of LP(a) in many subjects.# It is clearly the most effective agent for increasing levels of HDL.# For treatment of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, most patients require 2-6 g of niacin daily.# It is contraindicated in diabetics.# It is particularly useful in patients with combined hyperlipidemia and low plasma levels of HDL-C and is effective in combination with statins.Toxidty# Qraneous vasodilation and sensation of warmth after each dose# Tachyphylaxis# Pruntus, rashes, dry skin or mucous membranes, and acanthosis nigricans# Niacin should be avoided in patients with severe peptic disease.# Rarelj, true hepatotoxicity may occur and is an indication for discontinuing the drug.# Niacin may be given to diabetics who are receiving insulin and to some receiving oral agents if insulin resistance is not increased.# Hyperuricemia occurs in some patients.# Rarely, mein is associated with arrhythmias, mostly atrial, and a reversible toxic amblyopia.# Patients should be instructed to report blurring of distance vision.# Niacin may potentiate the action of antihypertensive agents, requiring adjustment of their dosages.# Dryness cf mucous membranes is occasional.DrugIndicationsMechanismCommon side effects1HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins)Elevated LDL-C| Cholesterol synthesis, | hepatic LDL receptors, |VLDL productionMyalgias,Arthralgias,Elevated transaminases,Dyspepsia2Cholesterol absorption inhibitors ( Eretimibe)Elevated LDL-Cintestinal cholesterol absorptionElevated transaminases3Bile acid sequestrants (Cholestyramire, Colestipol, Colesevelam)Elevated LDL-C| Bile acid excretion and |LDL receptorsBloating,Constipation,Elevated triglycerides4Nicotinic acidElevated LDL-C,Low HDL-C,Elevated TG|VLDL hepatic synthesisCutaneous flushing,Gl upset,Elevated glucose, uric acid, and liver function tests5Fibric acid derivativesElevated TG, elevated remnants| LPL, |VLDL synthesisDyspepsia, Myalgia,Gallstones, Elevated transaminases6Omega-3 fatty acidsElevated TG| TG catabolismDyspepsia,Diarrhea,Fishy odor to breath",

Effects on triglyceride and HDL-C levels are negligible, and no cardiovascular outcome data have been reported.When used in combination with a statin, monitoring of liver transaminases is recommended.

        "exp": "Ans. a (Ezetimibe) (Ref. KDT 6th/618; H-17th/Table 350-6; p. 2428).KDT 6th/618:Ezetimibe acts by inhibiting inetstinal absorption of cholestroi and phytosterols. It interferes with a specific CH transport protein NPC1C1 in the intsetinal mucosa and reduces absorption of both dietary and biliary CH. It is a weak hypocholestrolemic drug if used alone. Its primary clinical effect is reduction of LDL levels. Reversible hepatic dysfunction and rarley myositis are side effects.CHOLESTEROL ABSORPTION INHIBITORS (EZETIMIBE)# Cholesterol within the lumen of the small intestine is derived from the diet (about one-third) and the bile (about two- thirds) and is actively absorbed by the enterocyte through a process that involves the protein NPC1L1.# Ezetimibe is a cholesterol absorption inhibitor that binds directly to and inhibits NPC1L1 and blocks the intestinal absorption of cholesterol.# The result of inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption is likely to be reduction in hepatic cholesterol and an increase hepatic LDL receptor expression.# Effects on TG and HDL-C levels are negligible.# No cardiovascular outcome data have been reported.# When used in combination with a statin, monitoring of liver transaminases is recommended.# USES: Ezetimibe has become the preferred drug to add to a statin in patients who require further LDL-C reduction.# Widely used in patients who are statin-intolerant.DrugMajor indicationsMechanismCommon side effectsHMG-CoA reductase\\ inhibitors (statins)Elevated (LDL)|Cholesterol synthesis;| LDL receptors, | hepatic VLDL productionMyalgias, arthralgias, DyspepsiaBile acid sequestrantsElevated TGs| Bile acid excretion and | LDL receptorsBloating, constipation.Nicotinic acidElevated LDL, JHDL, Elevated TG|VLDL hepatic synthesis and | HDL.Cutaneous flushing; GI upset; Elevated glucose, uric acid, LFTsFibric acid derivates(drug class of choice in severe & first line in moderate hypertrigly- ceridemia).Elevated remnants| LPL, |VLDL (their effect is exerted through PPAR-a,a gene transcription regulating receptor in liver,fat,muscle.Dyspepsia myalgia; gallstones.Cholesterol Absorption Inhibitors (Ezetimibe)Preferred to add to a statin in pts who need further LDL-C reduction and in pts who are statin-intolerantInhibits NPC1L1 and blocks the intestinal absorption of cholesterol; Primarily i LDL.Reversible hepatic dysfunction and rarley myositisAdditional Educational Points# HMG-CoA like Lovastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin are most effective in reducing LDL. Other effects include decreased oxidative stress and vascular inflammation with increased stability of atherosclerotic lesions.2# FIBRIC ACID DERIVATIVES (FIBRATES) like Gemfibrozil and fenofibrate decrease levels of VLDL and, in some patients, LDL as well. Their effect is exerted through PPAR-a. Fibrates are drug class of choice in severe hypertriglyceridemia & firs dine in moderate hypertriglyceridemia).Q In a patient with poor glycemic control, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL, fibrates would be best drug for Rx without the risk of myositis. In diabetics, fibrates have some efficacy and should be considered when the HDL is low in the setting of a mild elevation of the LDL. Myopathy is uncommon with fibrates.# Niacin (but not niacinamide) decreases VLDL and LDL levels, and Lp(a) in most patients. It often increases HDL levels significantly (highest efficacy to increase HDL) 0/f significantly increases lipoprotein-a levels.0 Niacin is the most effective available HDL-C-raising therapeutic agent and can be associated with increases in plasma HDL-C by up to -30%. 0# High doses (>2 g/d) may worsen glycemic control and increase insulin resistance. The most frequent side effect of niacin is cutaneous flushing.0 Niacin can raise fasting plasma glucose levels (niacin should not be used in diabetics) -- KPTl6^/p. 618. Thus, in a patient with Type II diabetes mellitus on anti-lipidemic drug therapy for increased LDL and decreased HDL levels if the hyperglycemia worsened, the likely culprit is nicotinic acid.# ACID-BINDING RESINS like Colestipol, cholestyramine, and colesevelam are useful only for isolated increases in LDL. In patients who also have hypertriglyceridemia, VLDL levels may be further increased during Rx with resins.",

Lipoprotein lipase - Present in blood vessels and causes hydrolysis of tryglvceride content of VLDL and chylomicrones.2. Hepatic lipase - Converts IDL to LDL by hydrolysing the triglyceride content of IDL,Hormone sensitive lipase - Present intraceliularly in peripheral tissue and causes intracellular lipolysis by hydrolysing triglycerides.o Niacin (Nicotinic acid) inhibits intracellular lipolysis by inhibiting hormone sensitive lipase - |- intracellular FFA to liver -| triglyceride synthesis.o Niacin also increases the activity of lipoprotein lipase - | hydrolysis of VLDL triglyceride.o Nicotinic acid also reduces the production of VLDL in liver by inhibiting TG-synthesis - indirectly the VLDL degradation products IDL and LDL are also reduced,o Nicotinic acid is the most effective drug to raise HDL-CH.o Increased HDL is due to interference of direct pathway of HDL cholesterol to liver which involves apo-Al - Niacin decreases apo-A1 mediated hepatic clearance,o Nicotinic acid is used in type I, III, IV & V hyperlipoproteinemias.",
