All cardiac glycosides are potent and highly selective inhibitors of the active transport of Na+ and K+ across cell membranes by their reversible binding to the alpha subunit of the. Na+, K+- ATPase the elimination 11 /2 for digoxin is 36 hours in patients with nonnal renal function. Digoxin is excreted by the kidney with a clearance rate that is proportional to the glomerular filtration rate. It is now recommended that digoxin be reserved for patients with heart failure who are in atrial fibrillation, or for patients in sinus rhythm who remain symptomatic despite maximal therapy with ACE inhibitors and beta adrenergic receptor antagonists. Although the drug has no net effect on mortality, it reduces hospitalization and death, from progressive heart failure at the expense of an increase in sudden death. Other than heart failure digitalis is useful in the management of atrial arrhythmias because of its cardioselective parasympathomimetic effects. In atrial flutter and fibrillation, the depressant effect of the drug on atrioventricular conduction will help control an excessively high ventricular rate. Digitalis has also been used in the control of paroxysmal atrial and atrioventricular nodal tachycardia. Toxicity. Extracardiac. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting are usually first symptoms of toxicity. Other complaints include fatigue, malaise, headache, mental confusion, restlessness, disorientation, psychosis and visual disturbances. Cardiac. Almost every type of arrhythmia can be produced by digitalis: pulsus bigeminis, nodal and ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Partial to complete A-V block, severe bradycardia. Atrial extra systoles, AF or atrial flutter have also been noted. Treatmenta) For tachyarrythmias: KC1 infusion 20 m mol /hr IV or give orally in mild cases. b) For ventricular arrythmias: Lidocaine IV repeated as required is the drug of choice. c) For supraventricular arrythmias: Propranolol may be given IV or oral depending on urgencyd) For A-V block and bradycardia: Atropine 0. 6-1. 2 mg IM may help: otherwise cardiac pacing is recommended. Therapy of toxicity manifested as visual changes or gastrointestinal disturbances generally requires no more than reducing the dose of the drug. Immunotherapy with purified Fab fragments from bovine antidigoxin antisera (DIGIBIND) provides an effective antidote for lifethreatening digoxin toxicity. Precautions and contraindications. Hypokalaemia: enhances digitalis toxicityby increasing its binding to Na+ K+ATPase elderly, renal or severe hepatic disease Myocardial infarction: sever arrythmias are more likely thyrotoxicosis-reduces responsiveness to digitalis. Myxedema: these patienst eliminate digoxin more slowly, toxicity can appear. Ventricular tachycardia: digitalis is contraindicated, may precipitate ventricular fibrillation. It is explicitly contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation",

Drugs used in hypertension are: 1) Diuretics - Low-dose thiazide diuretics are often used as first-line agents, alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs e. g., hydrochlorthiazide, chlorthalidone. 2) ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers - ACE inhibitors decrease the production of angiotensin n, increase bradykinin levels, and reduce sympathetic nervous system activity. Angiotensin II receptor blockers provide selective blockade of AT1 receptors. 3) Beta Blockers - a adrenergic receptor blockers lower blood pressure by decreasing cardiac output, due to a reduction of heart rate and contractility. Other actions include renin inhibition. 4) Calcium Channel Blockers - Calcium channel antagonists reduce vascular resistance through L- channel blockade, which reduces intracellular calcium and blunts vasoconstriction. 5) Aldosterone Antagonists - It may be a particularly effective agent in patients with low-renin essential hypertension, resistant hypertension, and primary aldosteronism. The newer agent, eplerenone, which is a selective aldosterone antagonist have lesser side effects than spironolactone. 6) a adrenergic blockers - They lower blood pressure by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance. 7) Sympatholytic Agents - Centrally acting a2 agonists lower blood pressure by inhibiting sympathetic outflow and thereby decreasing peripheral resistance e. g., clonidine. 8) Direct vasodilators - These agents decrease peripheral resistance. Hydralazine is a potent direct vasodilator. S/e: lupus-like syndrome. Minoxidil is another vasodilator and is most frequently used in patients with renal insufficiency that is refractory to all other drugs. S/e: hypertrichosis and pericardial effusion. 9) Adrenergic neuron-blocking agents-These drugs lower blood pressure by preventing normal physiological release of norepinephrine from postganglionic sympathetic neurons.

It selectively binds to extracellular face of the membrane associated Na+K+ ATPase of myocardial fibres and inhibitis this enzyme. Inhibition of this cation pump results in accumulation of Na+intracellularly. This indirectly results in intracellular Ca2+ accumulation. CARDIAC GLYCOSIDESMechanism of Action# These inhibit the monovalent cation transport enzyme-coupled Na+-K+-ATPase and increase intracellular; the latter, in turn, increases intracellular through a Na+-Ca2+ exchange carrier mechanism. The increased myocardial augments Ca2+ released to the myofilaments during excitation and, therefore, invokes a positive inotropic response.# Cardiac glycosides causes increased automaticity and ectopic impulse activity.# They also prolong the effective refractory period of the atrioventricular node and thereby slow ventricular rate in atrial flutter and fibrillation. Pharmacokinetics# Digoxin is not extensively metabolized in humans; almost two-thirds is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.# Its renal clearance is proportional to creatinine clearance.# Liver impairment does not significantly prolong the half-life of digitoxin.# Digitoxin is metabolized in the liver and excreted into the gut via the bile. Cardioactive metabolites (which include digoxin) as well as unchanged digitoxin can then be reabsorbed from the intestine, thus establishing an enterohepatic circulation that contributes to the very long half-life of this agent.# Digoxin toxicity is enhanced by renal failure as it is excreted through kidneys, whereas digitoxin toxicity is enhanced by liver failure because it is eliminated by hepatic metabolism.# Hepatic dysfunction does not affect digoxin elimination.# Reduced tolerance to digoxin may be seen in:- Advanced age- Acute myocardial infarction/ischemia/hypoxemia- Magnesium depletion- Hypercalcemia- Hypothyroidism- Renal insufficiency- Electrical cardioversion.# The administration of following drugs raises the serum concentration of digoxin (by reducing both the renal and nonrenal elimination of digoxin and by reducing its volume of distribution)- Quinidine- Verapamil- Amiodarone- Propafenone.

Drug therapy is recommended for individuals with blood pressures >140/90 mm. Hg. Drugs used in hypertension are: 1. Diuretics -Low-dose thiazide diuretics are often used as first-line agents, alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs, e. g., hydrochlorthiazide, chlorthalidone. 2. ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers ACE inhibitors decrease the production of angiotensin II, increase bradykinin levels, and reduce sympathetic nervous system activity. Angiotensin II receptor blockers provide selective blockade of AT 1 receptors. 3. Beta blockers - beta adrenergic receptor blockers lower blood pressure by decreasing cardiac output, due to a reduction of heart rate and contractility. Other actions include renin inhibition. 4. Calcium channel blockers - Calcium channel antagonists reduce vascular resistance through L-channel blockade, which reduces intracellular calcium and blunts vasoconstriction. 5. Aldosterone antagonists - It may be a particularly effective agent in patients with low-renin essential hypertension, resistant hypertension, and primary aldosteronism. The newer agent, eplerenone, which is a selective aldosterone antagonist have lesser side effects than spironolactone. 6. Alpha adrenergic blockers - They lower blood pressure by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance. 7. Sympatholytic agents - Centrally acting a 2 agonists lower blood pressure by inhibiting sympathetic outflow and thereby decreasing peripheral resistance, e. g., clonidine. 8. Direct vasodilators - These agents decrease peripheral resistance. Hydralazine is a potent direct vasodilator. S/e: lupus-like syndrome. 9. Adrenergic neuron-blocking agents - These drugs lower blood pressure by preventing normal physiological release of nor epinephrine from postganglionic sympathetic neurons, e. g., Guanethidine, reserpine. Newer drugs. Renin Inhibitors The orally active renin inhibitor aliskiren is now available for the treatment of hypertension. Drugs used in management of hypertensive emergencies. The drug most commonly used to treat hypertensive emergencies is the vasodilator sodium nitroprusside. Other parenteral drugs that may be effective include fenoldopam, nitroglycerine, labetalol, enalaprilat, calcium channel blockers (IV nicardipine), diazoxide, and hydralazine. Esmolol is often used to manage intra operative and postoperative hypertension. Fenoldopam is a peripheral arteriolar dilator used for hypertensive emergencies and postoperative hypertension. It acts primarily as an agonist of dopamine D1 receptors, resulting in dilation of peripheral arteries and natriuresis.",

It dilates resistant coronary vessels and diverts blood from ischaemic zone to non-ischaemic zone leading to \"coronary steal phenomenon. \"# It is used for assessment of myocardial injury by dipyridamol-induced stress scan. DIPYRIDAMOL (PERSANTIN). Introduction. Dipyridamole is a relatively weak antiplatelet agent on its own, but an extended-release formulation of dipyridamole combined with low-dose aspirin, a preparation known as Aggrenox, is used for prevention of stroke in patients with transient ischemic attacks. Mechanism of Action. By inhibiting phosphodiesterase, dipyridamole blocks the breakdown of c. AMP. Increased levels of c. AMP reduce intracellular calcium and inhibit platelet activation. Dipyridamole also blocks the uptake of adenosine by platelets and other cells. This produces a further increase in local c. AMP levels because the platelet adenosine A2 receptor is coupled to adenylate cyclase. Side Effects. Because dipyridamole has vasodilatory effects, it must be used with caution in patients with coronary artery disease (coronary steal phenomenon). Coronary steal phenomenon can also be caused by adenosine. GI complaints, headache, facial flushing, dizziness, and hypotension can also occur. These symptoms often subside with continued use of the drug. Indications. Dipyridamole plus aspirin was compared with aspirin or dipyridamole alone, or with placebo, in patients with an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Aggrenox is often used for stroke prevention. However, because of its vasodilatory effects and the paucity of data supporting the use of dipyridamole in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease, Aggrenox should not be used for stroke prevention in such patients.",

In variant angina - nitrates work by dilating the large coronary vessels. Mechanism of action of other antianginal drugs. Beta blockers - they decrease heart rate, inotropic state and mean BP. This results in reduced cardiac work. Calcium channel blockers - it causes smooth muscle (vascular) relaxation and negative chronotropic, inotropic and dromotropic actionK+ channel openers - e. g., nicorandil. It causes smooth muscle relaxation. Dipyridamole - prevents uptake and degradation of adenosine. Adenosine is a vasodilator. Trimetazidine - it improves myocardial glucose utilization through inhibition of fatty acid metabolism (LC3- KAT inhibitor). Ranolazine - it inhibits late I current (funny current inhibitor). It also inhibits LC3- KAT. Notes on Nitrates. MOA - it is more venodilator than arteriolar dilator. Short acting - Glyceryltrinitrate. Nitroglycerine. Long acting - Isosorbide dinitrate (short acting if sublingual). Isosorbide mononitrate. Adverse effects- Headache Flushing, weakness, palpitation Methhemoglobinaemia Rashes.

C in hypertensive emergency) Prazosin Antihypertensives to be avoided during pregnancy Diuretics Tends to reduce blood volume - accentuate uteroplacental perfusion deficit (of toxemia) - increased risk of foetal wastage, placental infarcts, miscarriage, still birth. ACE inhibitors, AT1 antagonists Risk of foetal damage, growth retardation. Reserpine Suicidal depression in mother, nasal obstruction, deranged respiratory and temperature control in the new bom. Nonselective b blockers Propranolol has been implicated to cause low birth weight decreased placental size, neonatal bradycardia and hypoglycemia. Sodium Nitroprusside Contraindicated in eclampsia Pregnancy hypertension There is a lack of good clinical trial evidence, on which to base recommendations of one agent over another. Instead, drug usage reflects longevity of use without obvious harm to the fetus. Hence methyldopa is still the drug of choice for many obstetricians. Calcium channel blockers (especially nifedipine) are common second line drugs. Parenteral hydralazine is reserved for emergency reduction of blood pressure in late pregnancy, preferably in combination a b blocker to avoid unpleasant tachycardia (labetalol and atenolol) are often effective and probably the drug of choice in the third trimester. There is anecdotal evidence to suggest growth retardation with b blockade used in first and second trimester. Diuretics reduce the chance of developing preeclampsia but are avoided in pre-eclampsia itself because these patients, already have a contracted circulatory volume. Spironolactone is a diuretic which is avoided in pregnancy because of its antiandrogenic effect on fetus. ACE inhibitors (and by implication angiotensin AT1receptor antagonist) are absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy where they cause fetal death, typically midtrimester (they can be prescribed during first trimester) Note: There is no evidence that ACE inhibitors - or any of the commonly used antihypertensive drugs are teratogenic and women who become pregnant while receiving these should be reassured but should, of course, then discontinue the ACE inhibitor or AT1receptor antagonist.",
