It involves acute paralysis secondary to persistent depolarization at the neuromuscular junction caused by persistent stimulation by excessive Ach. Treatment of choice is atropine with or without oximes. Type. IIIt is also called as intermediate syndrome. It develops 1-4 days after resolution of acute cholinergic symptoms. It is manifested as paralysis and respiratory distress. It involves proximal muscles with relative sparing of distal muscle groups. The pathogenesis presumed to be dysfunction of neuromuscular junction caused by downregulation of presynaptic and postsynaptic nicotinic receptors due to release of excessive Ach and Ca^ respectively. Atropine is ineffective, symptomatic treatment is given. Type IIIIt involves OP-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDN). It occurs 1-3 weeks after exposure and is associated with demyelination of axons. It is not caused by cholinesterase inhibition but rather by neuropathy target esterase (NTE) inhibition.
