        "exp": "Ans: A (Bromocriptine) Ref: Basic & Clinical Pharmacology, Katzung 12th ed. Explanation: Dopamine agonists suppress prolactin release very effectively in patients with hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine and cabergoline are ergot derivatives with a high affinity for dopamine D2. receptors. Quinagoiide. a drug approved in Europe, is a non ergot agent with similarly high D: receptor affinity. ADR: Dopamine agonists can cause nausea, headache, light-headedness, orthostatic hypotension and fatigue. Psychiatric manifestations occasionally occur, even at lower doses, and may take months to resolve. Erythromelalgia occurs rarely. High dosages of ergot-derived preparations can cause cold- induced peripheral digital vasospasm. Pulmonary infiltrates have occurred with chronic high- dosage therapy. Cabergoline appears to cause nausea less often than bromocriptine. Receptor subtypes. Agonist. Antagonist. Mechanism. GlutamateX-Methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)NMDA2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate Dizocilpine.
