        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Bronchoconstrction CNSo Atropine has an overall CNS stimulant action, while Hyoseine produces CNS depression, o Due to its amnestic and CNS depressant action, hyoseine induces \"twilight sleep \" and has been used as lie detector or truth serum in suspects. o Atropine stimulates medullary centres - vagal, respiratory, vasomotor, o Atropine depresses vestibular excitation and has anti motion sickness property. o Transdermal patch of scopolamine (hyoseine), applied behind the pinna is used to prevent motion sickness. o Atropine suppresses tremor and rigidity of parkinsonism by blocking relative cholinergic overactivity in basal ganglia. o Central cholinergic agents like benztropine, benzhexol (trihexiphenidyl) and biperiden are drug of choice for drug induced parkinsonism. CVSo The most prominent effect of atropine is to cause tachycardia. o On im/sc injection transient initial bradycardia often occurs due to blockade of muscarinic autoreceptors (Ml) on vagal nerve endings augmenting ACH release. o Atropine abbrevates refractory period of A-V node and facilitates A-V conduction, PR interval is shortened, o Atropine does not have any consistent or marked effect on BP. o Atropine can be used in arrhythmias like AV block and digitalis induced arrhythmia. Eyeo Atropine causes mydriasis, abolition of light reflex and cycloplegia (paralysis of accomodation), o Due to dilatation of iris, iris comes closer to angle of anterior chamber and trabecular meshwork at the base of ciliary muscle is closed - | aqueous out flow - | IOT. o Atropine increases intraocular tension - Contraindicated in glaucoma. Smooth muscleso Tone and amplitude of contractions of stomach and intestine are reduced, constipation may occur, o Atropine causes bronchodilatation and reduced airway resistance, especially in COPD and asthma patients, o Atropine relaxes urinary bladder, urinary retention may occur, o Effect on biliary tract is less marked and on uterus is minimal. Glandso Atropine decreases sweat, salivary, tracheobronchial and lacrimal secretion, o Atropine decreases secretion of acid, pepsin and mucus in the stomach, o Intestinal and pancreatic secretions are not significantly reduced, o Bile production is not affected. At higher doses atropine causes rise in body temperature --> Contraindicated in children due to risk of hyperthermia. Atropine has mild anaesthetic property on the cornea.",

Explanation: Diphenoxylate is an opioid agonist without any analgesic property. It has Antimotilitv action hence it is used in non-infective diarrhoea. It can cause drug dependence since it has CNS effects. Atropine in small doses (0. 025 mg) is added with diphenoxylate 2. 5 mg to discourage overdose since this may cause atropine side effects which unpleasant",
