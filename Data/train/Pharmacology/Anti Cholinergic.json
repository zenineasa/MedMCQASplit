EFFECTS OF ATROPINE: CNS* Stimulates medullary, vasomotor and respiratory center* Depresses vestibular excitation, hence anti motion sickness* Suppresses cholinergic activity in basal ganglia, hence decreases tremor.* High doses may cause cortical excitation, restlessness, disorientation and hallucinations. CVS* Tachycardia* Abbreviates A-V refractory period* Facilitates A-V conduction* No consistent effect on BPEYE* Mydriaisis* Abolition of light reflexes* Cycloplegia* Rise of IOTSmooth musdes* All visceral smooth muscles are relaxed* Constipation* Bronchodilation* Urinary retention* Urinary bladder and ureter relaxation* Effect on uterus is minimal* Effect of biliary tract is less marked. Glands* Decrease sweat, salivary, tracheobronchial and lachrymal secretions* Decreases secretion of acid and pepsin. Body temperature* rise. Local anesthetic* effect present",

Explanation: Diphenoxylate is an opioid agonist without any analgesic property. It has Antimotilitv action hence it is used in non-infective diarrhoea. It can cause drug dependence since it has CNS effects. Atropine in small doses (0. 025 mg) is added with diphenoxylate 2. 5 mg to discourage overdose since this may cause atropine side effects which unpleasant",
