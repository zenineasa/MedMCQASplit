        "exp": "Ans. A: Oral The first-pass effect/first-pass metabolism/presystemic metabolism is a phenomenon of drug metabolism whereby the concentration of a drug is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. It is the fraction of lost drug during the process of absorption which is generally related to the liver and gut wall. Notable drugs that experience a significant first-pass effect are Imipramine, Propranolol, and Lidocaine. After a drug is swallowed, it is absorbed by the digestive system and enters the hepatic poal system. It is carried through the poal vein into the liver before it reaches the rest of the body. The liver metabolizes many drugs, sometimes to such an extent that only a small amount of active drug emerges from the liver to the rest of the circulatory system. This first pass through the liver thus greatly reduces the bioavailability of the drug. Routes of administration like suppository/rectal, intravenous, intramuscular, inhalational aerosol and sublingual avoid the first-pass effect because they allow drugs to be absorbed directly into the systemic circulation. The four primary systems that affect the first pass effect of a drug are the enzymes of the gastrointestinal lumen, gut wall enzymes, bacterial enzymes, and hepatic enzymes.",

Patients on prazosin should be told not to stand up too quickly, since their poor baroreflex may cause them to faint as all their blood rushes to their feet. The nasal congestion is due to dilation of vessels in the nasal mucosa. One phenomenon associated with prazosin is known as the \"first dose response\", in which the side effects of the drug, especially ohostatic hypotension and fainting, are especially pronounced after the first dose.

One of the primary disadvantages of using this agent, with respect to other H2-receptor antagonists famotidine and ranitidine, is that it is a relatively potent hepatic enzyme inhibitor. Therefore, this medication is likely to decrease the metabolism of other hepatically metabolized medications, such as phenobarbital. When the metabolism of a medication is decreased, the blood levels will increase, leading to an extension of the therapeutic effect and/or toxicity. Phenobarbital is a barbiturate indicated for the treatment of tonic-clonic seizures and status epilepticus. When the blood concentration of this medication increases, lethargy and feelings of intoxication may occur. Lansoprazole is a gastric acid proton-pump inhibitor indicated for the sho-term and maintenance treatment of duodenal and gastric ulceration, as well as gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Hypocalcemia can result in seizures but the level should be very low. Further, if we correct calcium with serum albumin, it will come in normal range. Corrected calcium level in the serum can be calculated by adding 0. 8 mg/dL With every 1. 0 g/dL decrease in serum albumin below the normal value of 4. 0 g/dL. Hence, in this patient, corrected serum calcium level will be 7. 5 + 0. 8 x (4. 0 - 1. 5) = 9. 5 mg/ dL It is in the normal range (8. 5-10. 5 mg/dL) and thus cannot be the cause of seizures in this person. Uremia Although blood urea is elevated (78 mg/dL as compared to normal value of 15-40 mg/dL) but serum creatinine is normal (0. 5 mg/dL).

HER-2/neu erh-B, stands for Human e i idermal * rowth factor rece i tor. It is a molecule present in small amounts on the surface of ceain types of cells such as breast cells and ovarian cells.

Therefore it is also called orphan receptor. - Instead of activation by direct ligand binding it exhibits \"constitutive activity\" in the absence of ligand. The constitutive activity of the HER-2 is increased by overexpression of HER-2. - The most common mechanism by which HER-2 gets activated and transforms cells is by overexpression of normal HER-2. This phenomenon is observed in breast cancers.

A: Propyl-thiouracil Thioamide drugs (methyl and propyl thiouracil, methimazole and carbimazole) can also be used during pregnancy (the lowest possible dose should be used) The foetal thyroid is extremely susceptible to radiation and may be quickly destroyed. Propylthiouracil/ PTU/ 6-n-Propylthiouracil It is a thioamide drug used to treat hypehyroidism (including Graves' disease) by decreasing the amount of thyroid hormone produced by the thyroid gland. Its notable side effects include a risk of agranulocytosis. PTU inhibits the enzyme thyroperoxidase, which normally acts in thyroid hormone synthesis by oxidizing the anion iodide (I-) to iodine (10), facilitating iodine's addition to tyrosine residues on the hormone precursor thyroglobulin. This is one of the essential steps in the formation of thyroxine (T4). PTU does not inhibit the action of the sodium-dependent iodide transpoer located on follicular cells' basolateral membranes. Inhibition of this step requires competitive inhibitors, such as perchlorate and thiocyanate. PTU also acts by inhibiting the enzyme 5'-deiodinase (tetraiodothyronine 5' deiodinase), which conves T4 to the active form T3. (This is in contrast to methimazole, which shares propylthiouracil's central mechanism, but not its peripheral one) Administration is oral, with peak serum concentrations occurring in one hour, and actively concentrated to the thyroid gland. The drug is approximately 70% protein-bound and significantly ionized at normal physiologic pH, while the antithyroid agent methimazole is substantially less protein bound. However both are equally transferred across the placenta. Less than 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged, with the remaining fraction undergoing extensive hepatic metabolism glucuronidation. One side effect is agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia A more life threatening side effect is sudden, severe, fulminant hepatic failure occurs in up to 1 in 10, 000 people taking propylthiouracil. PTU is preferred over methimazole only in the first trimester of pregnancy and in woman who may become pregnant. In the second and third trimester, methimazole is preferred.",

        "exp": "Diuretics lead to aldosterone excess and hypokalemia by a variety of mechanisms. Diuretic induced volume depletion stimulates the formation of angiotensin II, which, in turn, causes a secondary increase in plasma aldosterone concentration. This increase in plasma aldosterone stimulates potassium excretion, contributing to the hypokalemia. The saline diuresis increased sodium delivery to the collecting tubule. The increased availability of sodium along with the elevated plasma aldosterone augments sodium reabsorption iin the collecting tubule, thereby raising luminal negativity. This high luminal negativity in the collecting tubule promotes secretion of cations, especially hydrogen ions, which raises bicarbonate reabsorption. The saline diuresis causes rapid fluid flow in the distal tubule, which, in turn, keeps luminal potassium concentration low by carrying it away and thus preventing the accumulation of any potassium that enters the lumen. This low luminal concentration of potassium creates a steep concentration gradient for additional potassium losses in the urine. The treatment of edema with thiazide or loop diuretics is the most common cause of metabolic alkalosis. Aerial pH is increased and aerial H+ concentration is decreased with metabolic alkalosis. Sodium depletion tends to decrease plasma sodium levels, although the effect is usually small. Overuse of the thiazide diuretic has caused depletion of sodium and potassium by the kidneys, not retention of sodium and potassium.",

V. node refractoriness Digitalis in arrhythma Digitalis is the drug of choice for controlling ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation (AF) with heart failure. Digitalis reduces the ventricular rate in AF by decreasing the number of impulses that are able to pass down the A-V node and bundle of His. It increases effective refractory period-ERP refractoriness) of A-V node by direct, vagomimetic and antiadrenergic action - the minimum interval between consecutive impulses that can successfully traverse the conducting tissue is increased. A degree of A-V block is naturally established in AF. Because of the relatively long ERP of A-V node, many atrial impulses impinge on it while it is still refractory; others falling early in the relative refractory period get extinguished by decremental conduction - These concealed impulses leave upper margin of A-V node refractory for a fuher period. Thus, any influence which increases atrial rate in AF (e. g. digitalis), by itself reduces ventricular rate.",

They are the most effective antisecretory medication available because they block the hydrogen potassium/adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) pump, the final common pathway, regardless of the stimulus. The acid environment in the stomach allows for the release of the prodrug granules, which are then absorbed in the duodenum. Once in the systemic circulation, they are taken up by gastric parietal cells and diffuse into the extracellular canaliculus. The PPI then covalently and irreversibly binds to the proton pump. PPIs require acid for accumulation and activation, which is why they are most efficacious on an empty stomach. PPIs are rapidly and almost completely absorbed. The peak plasma concentration is reached in 1-3 hours. The prodrug is quickly metabolized by the liver, primarily by cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme CYP2. C19, resulting in a half-life of roughly 1 hour. Despite the sho half-life of PPIs, the irreversible covalent bonding to the proton pump provides sustained antisecretory effects; therefore, the effect is not due to plasma concentration of the drug but rather the area under the plasma concentration curve.",

Causal prophylaxis: This prevents the establishment of infection in the liver by inhibiting the pre-erythrocytic schizogony. Primaquine and proguanil are effective as causal prophylactic drugs. Suppressive prophylaxis: Use of blood schizonticides suppresses the blood forms of the malaria parasite and thus protects against clinical illness. However, P. vivax and P. ovale may cause relapses from the hypnozoites and to prevent this, terminal prophylaxis may be needed. (B) Terminal Prophylaxis: Terminal prophylaxis is the administration of Primaquine for two weeks after returning from travel to tackle the hypnozoites of P. vivax and P. ovale that can cause relapses of malaria. It is indicated only for persons who have had prolonged exposure in malaria-endemic regions, such as expatriates and long-term travellers like missionaries and Peace Corps volunteers. Primaquine is administered after the traveller leaves an endemic area and usually in conjunction with Chloroquine during the last 2 weeks of the 4-week period of prophylaxis after exposure in an endemic area has ended Drugs used in malaria prophylaxis and their doses: Drugs Dosage Pros and Cons Adults Children Atovaquone plus Adult Pediatric tablet of 62. 5 Daily dosing; only have to Proguanil(Malarone) tablet of mg atovaquone and 25 mg continue for 7 days after 250 mg proguanil: exposure; not in pregnancy and atovaquone and 100 mg proguanil - 1 tab. daily 5-8 kg: 1/2 tablet daily >8-10 kg: 3/4 tablet daily >10-20 kg: 1 tablet daily >20-30 kg: 2 tablets daily lactation >30-40 kg: 3 tablets daily >40 kg: 1 adult tablet daily Chloroquine 300 mg base 5mg/kg base weekly; Long-term safety known; (Tablet with 150mg base) once weekly maximum 300 mg Chloroquine resistance repoed from most pas of the world; not for persons with epilepsy, psoriasis Proguanil 200 mg daily < 2 yrs: 50 mg/day; Used in combination 2-6 yrs: 100 mg/d 7-9 yrs: 150 mg/day; >9 yrs: 200 mg/d Doxycycline(100mg) 100mg once 1. 5mg base/kg once daily Daily dosing required; not in daily (max. 100 mg) pregnancy and lactation < 25kg or <8 yr: Not given 25-35kg or 8-10 yr: 50mg 36-50kg or 11-13 yr: 75mg >50kg or >14 yr: 100mg Mefloquine(Tablet with 250 mg base <15 kgs: 5mg of salt/kg; Weekly dosing; occasional repos 250mg base, 274mg salt) once weekly 15-19 kg: % tab/wk; 20-30 kg: 1/2 tab/wk; 31-45 kg: 3/4 tab/wk; >45 kg: 1 tab/wk of severe intolerance; not in first trimester of pregnancy, breast feeding, high altitudes or deep sea diving, patients with epilepsy, psychosis, heart blocks, receiving 13 blockers",

        "exp": "Disulfiram Pharmacological treatment of opioid dependence (Harrison 17' Ye p. 2732) Methadone maintenance:? Methadone is a synthetic opioid chemically dissimilar but pharmacologically very similar to morphine. Methadone is used as substitution therapy in opioid dependence. The basic aim is to replace an opioid with another opioid that has the following propeies. - Lower abuse/addiction potential - Incapable of a giving a kick - Where tolerance develops slowly - Withdrawl syndrome develops gradually - Legally accessible - Can be taken orally and has a relatively long half life. These propeies of the drug help in blocking heroin induced euphoria while decreasing craving. - Methadone occupies the opioid receptor thus reducing the desire to take other opioids. - Addicts who are cooperative enough to take oral methadone experience reduced craving and less kick/buzz/rush from intravenous heroin because their opioid receptor are already occupied by methadone and the intravenous drug must compete with it. - This helps the patient to maintain abstinence for opioids. - Over three quaers off patients in well supervised clinics are likely to remain heroin free for 26 months. - After a period of maintenance (usually 6 months to -2. 1 year) the dose of methadone is gradually tapered off. Alternative medicines that have been used for maintenance treatment are:? Buprenorphine: - Buprenorphine is a paial agonist at the p receptor. Buprenorphine has several advantages over methadone. - Low overdose danger - Potentially easier detoxification than with methadone. - Probable ceiling effect in which higher doses do not increase euphoria. Opioid antagonists (Naltrexone) Naltrexone is a competitive opioid antagonist at it, cS, 7C It is long acting. It can be used orally to assist in the rehabilitation of ex opioid abusers who are fully withdrawn from opioids (otherwise it will induce an acute withdraw! syndrome). A patient who then takes an opioid fails to experience the \"kick\" or euphoria. Naltrexone does not reduce the craving. Use of clonidine in opioid withdrawl: -(Goodman Gilman 11th/e p. 619) Clonidine is an a2 adrenergic agonist that decreases adrenergic neurotransmission from locus ceruleus. Most of the autonomic symptoms of opioid withdrawl results from loss of opioid suppression of locus ceruleus. Clonidine acts distinct receptor but by cellular mechanisms that mimic opioid effects. So it can allete many of the symptoms of opioid withdrawl. Postural hypotension is common with opioid withdrawl, therefore, dose of clonidine, must be titrated according to the stage and severity of withdraw!. Ioxfexidine It is also an a2 adrenergic agonist. It has greater selectivity for a2. Aadrenergic receptors and is associated with less hypotension.",

        "exp": "Spironolactone is a competitive antagonist of the aldosterone receptor. Hypokalemia and hypertension in patients with primary aldosteronism can be controlled by spironolactone, 50-100 mg/d. Although spironolactone is an effective aldosterone receptor antagonist, it is not without side effects that can limit its use in the chronic treatment of this disease. The most impoant are anti-androgenic reactions. Spironolactone acts as an antiandrogen by decreasing the production of testosterone by the adrenal gland and by preventing DHT (dihydrotestosterone) from binding to its androgen receptor. As a result of this, in the long run, gynecomastia occurs in more than 10% of the treated men. Impotence, loss of libido, and menstrual irregularities are also common side effects of spironolactone therapy. On the other side, these spironolactone features are the basis for its usage in the treatment of hirsutism, acne, and alopecia. Spironolactone is also used by transsexuals in the feminizing regimen because of its anti-androgenic actions. Cardiac arrhythmia is not a frequent adverse reaction to spironolactone treatment, and it is seen only in the presence of significant hyperkalemia. Dehydration is usually very mild, and can be prevented with adequate water intake. Hyperkalemia develops in 5-10% of treated patients, especially if renal function is compromised, or the patient is diabetic, or elderly. Also Know: Spironolactone (Aldactone) is a direct aldosterone receptor antagonist in collecting tubules. It acts to inhibit aldosterone-mediated Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion. Ref: Morgan, Jr. G.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Breast Herceptin (Trastuzumab) Herceptin is a humanized antibody and is used in breast cancers which are HER2 positive. HER2 stands for:- human epidermal growth factor receptor. HER2 gene produces HER2 protein also called HER2 receptor. The HER2 protein is found on the surface of some normal cells in the body. In normal cells HER2 protein help send growth signals from outside the cell to the inside of the cell. These signals tell the cell to grow and divide. In HER2 (+ve) breast cancer the cancer cells have abnormally high number of HER2 genes per cell when this happens too much HER2 protein appears on the surface of these cancer cells. This is called HER2 protein over expression. Too much HER2 protein is thought to cause cancer cells to grow and divide uncontrollably. Herceptin acts in two ways: a) Herceptin attaches to HER2+ cancer cells and stimulates the bodys immune system to target the HER2-icancer cells b) Herceptin attaches itself to the HER2 receptors on the surface and blocks them from receiving the signals. Currently transtuzumab is approved for HER2/neu overexpressing metastatic breast cancer in combination with paclitaxel as initial treatment or as monotherapy following chemotherapy.",

Harrison 16thie p 4781 CML is characterized by the presence of a distinctive molecular abnormality namely philadelphia chromosome. Philadelphia chromosome in formed as a result of reciprocal translocation between long arm of chromosome 22 and chromosome 9 i. e. t (9; 22). ABL protooncogene from chromosome 9 is translocated to chromosome 22 where BCR is present and results in formation of BCR-ABL fusion chimeric gene. The drug imatinib mesylate is a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase signal transduction inhibitor. This drug acts as a inhibitor of the ATP binding site on the protein and prevents its phosphorylation and thus its activity. An impoant point CML is caused by reciprocal translocation between BCR and ABL gene located on chromosome 9 and 22. Imatinib mesylate does not block this translocation i. e., BCR ABL translocation. - Instead, it blocks the constitutive abnormal tyrosine kinase, BCR-ABL that is created by the Philadelphia chromose (BCR-ABL). - The drug inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis in BCR-ABL positive cells. Also know Protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors Protein kinases are ubiquitous and critical components of signal transduction pathways that transmit information concerning extra cellular or cytoplasmic conditions to the nucleus, thereby influencing gene transcription and/or DNA synthesis. The protein kinases can be classified into three categories: (i) Tyrosine kinase (ii) Serine threonine kinase (iii) Kinases with activity for all three residues Abnormal activation of specific tyrosine kinase has been demonstrated in many human neoplasms. Thus they can be targeted in ceain cancer therapies. There currently are three small-molecular weight protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are FDA approved and many others are in clinical trials. i) Imatinib Imatinib has efficacy in diseases in which the ABL, KIT or PDGFR have dominant roles in driving the proliferation of the tumour. Thus, imatinib shows remarkable therapeutic benefits in patients with - CML (BCR-ABL) - GIST (KIT mutation positive) - CMML (EVT6-PDGFR) ii) Gefitinib The epidennal growth factor receptor (EGFR) belongs to the family of tyrosine kinase. Gefitinid is a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase that competitively inhibits ATP binding. EGFR is overexpressed in non-small cell carcinoma of lung, thus Gefitinib has been approved for use in non-small cell carcinoma. iii) Erlotinib It is a human HERI/EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

        "exp": "Ans. B: Acetaminophen Patterns of liver injuries A. Zonal Necrosis This is the most common type of drug induced liver cell necrosis where the injury is largely confined to a paicular zone of the liver lobule. It may manifest as very high level of ALT and severe disturbance of liver function leading to acute liver failure. Causes include: Carbon tetrachloride Paracetamol Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is usually well tolerated in prescribed dose but overdose is the most common cause of drug induced liver disease and acute liver failure worldwide. Damage to the liver is not due to the drug itself but to a toxic metabolite (N-acetyl- p-benzoquinone imine NAPQI, or NABQI) which is produced by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. In normal circumstances this metabolite is detoxified by conjugating with glutathione in phase 2 reaction. In overdose large amount of NAPQI is generated which overwhelm the detoxification process and lead to damage to liver cells. Administration of Acetylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione, can limit the severity of the liver damage by capturing the toxic NAPQI. B. Hepatitis In this pattern hepatocellular necrosis is associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells. There can be three types of drug induced hepatitis. Viral hepatitis type picture is the commonest, where histological features are similar to acute viral hepatitis. Causes include: Halothane, isoniazid, phenytoin In the focal or non specific hepatitis scattered foci of cell necrosis may accompany lymphocytic infiltrate. Causes include: Aspirin Chronic hepatitis type is very similar to autoimmune hepatitis clinically, serologically as well as histologically. Causes include: Methyldopa, diclofenac C. Cholestasis Liver injury leads to impairment of bile flow and clinical picture is predominated by itching and jaundice. Histology may show inflammation (cholestatic hepatitis) or it can be bland without any parenchymal inflammation. In rare occasions it can produce features similar to primary biliary cirrhosis due to progressive destruction of small bile ducts (Vanishing duct syndrome). Causes include: Bland: Oral contraceptive pills, anabolic steroid, androgens Inflammatory: Allopurinol, co-amoxiclav, carbamazepine Ductal: Chlorpromazine, flucloxacillin D. Steatosis Hepatotoxicity may manifest as triglyceride accumulation which leads to either small droplet (microvesicular) or large droplet (macrovesicular) fatty liver. There is a separate type of steatosis where phospholipid accumulation leads to a pattern similar to the diseases with inherited phospholipid metabolism defects (e. g. Tay-Sachs disease). Causes include: Microvesicular: Aspirin (Reye's syndrome), ketoprofen, tetracycline Macrovesicular: Acetamenophen, methotrexate Phospholipidosis: Amiodarone, total parenteral nutrition E. Granuloma Drug induced hepatic granulomas are usually associated with granulomas in other tissues and patients typically have features of systemic vasculitis and hypersensitivity. Causes include: Allopurinol, phenytoin, isoniazid, quinine, penicillin, quinidine F. Vascular lesions They result from injury to the vascular endothelium. Peliosis hepatis: anabolic steroid Hepatic vein thrombosis: Oral contraceptives G. Neoplasm Neoplasms have been described with prolonged exposure to some medications or toxins. Hepatocellular carcinoma, angiosarcoma and liver adenomas are the ones usually repoed. Causes include: Vinyl chloride, combined oral contraceptive pill, anabolic steroid, arsenic, thorotrast",

C: Lorazepam Intravenous Lorazepam is now the treatment of choice for controlling seizures in status epilepticus Status epilepticus/SE It is a life-threatening condition in which the brain is in a state of persistent seizure. Definitions vary, but traditionally it is defined as one continuous unremitting seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes, or recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness between seizures for greater than 5 minutes. It is always considered a medical emergency. There is some evidence that 5 minutes is sufficient to damage neurons and that seizures are unlikely to self-terminate by that time. The moality rate of status epilepticus has the potential to be quite high (at least 20%), especially if treatment is not initiated quickly. Only 25 percent of people who experience seizures or status epilepticus have epilepsy. Causes include: - Stroke - Hemorrhage - Insufficient dosage of a medication already prescribed to the patient. Such causes of this include: Forgetfulness on the pa of the patient in taking scheduled doses, or failure to take doses at the scheduled times Taking medicine at wrong times as a result of a time zone change while traveling Dislike of the medication or its side effects - Sudden withdrawal from a seizure medication. Such causes include: - Consumption of alcoholic beverages while on an anticonvulsant, or alcohol withdrawal. Dieting or fasting while on an anticonvulsant - Staing on a new medication that reduces the effectiveness of the anticonvulsant - Developing a resistance to an anticonvulsant already being used Gastroenteritis while on an anticonvulsant. This is because the digestive system may force out the anticonvulsant, thereby rendering the body with a lack of protection - Metabolic disturbances--such as affected kidney and liver Status epilepticus can be divided into two categories -- convulsive and nonconvulsive, the latter of which is underdiagnosed The benzodiazepine of choice is lorazepam for initial treatment due to its relatively long (2-8 hour) duration of action when injected, and its rapid onset of action, which is thought to be due to its high affinity for GABA receptors and to its low lipid solubility which causes it to remain in the vascular compament. If lorazepam is not available, or intravenous access is not possible, then diazepam should be given. Paicularly in children another, increasingly popular treatment choice is buccal and intranasal midazolam, which can be given into the side of the mouth.",

Next, formaldehyde is oxidized by formaldehyde dehydrogenase to yield formic acid (or formate, depending on the pH). This oxidation occurs rapidly so that little formaldehyde accumulates in the serum. Finally, formic acid is metabolized to carbon dioxide and water, which are excreted by the kidneys and lungs. The accumulation of formic acid is responsible for the presence of metabolic acidosis. Formic acid also inhibits cellular respiration leading to lactic acidosis. The ocular injury caused by methanol may be due to retinal injury, which results from intra-retinal metabolism of methanol and the accumulation of formic acid. Alternatively, it may be caused be the inhibition of normal metabolism in optic nerve calls.",

The inhibition of ATP synthesis by oligomycin A will significantly reduce electron flow through the electron transpo chain; however, electron flow is not stopped completely due to a process known as proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling. This process is due to the facilitated diffusion of protons into the mitochondrial matrix through an uncoupling protein such as thermogenin, or UCP 1.

        "question": "Increased prolactin is associated with a. EUR'",
        "exp": "Increased estradial Prolactin is a polypeptide produced by the lactotrophs of the pituitary. It is responsible. for the initiation and maintenance of lactation. As with several pituitary hormones, prolactin is secreted in a circadian, fashion with the highest levels being attained during sleep and a nadir occurring between 10 am and noon. Prolactin is secreted in a pulsatile. fashion, the amplitude and frequency of which not only varies throughout the day but is also impacted upon by a variety of physiology stimuli i. e., suckling, stress and increased level of ovarian steroids primarily estrogens. \"The general view is that lactotrophs have spontaneously high secretary activity\". Therefore pituitary prolactin secretion is under a tonic and predominantly inhibitory control exeed by the hypothalamus. - Hypothalmus releases prolactin inhibitory factor (PIF) which inhibits prolactin release. - PIE is actually dopamine and it suppresses prolactin synthesis and secretion by means of D2 receptors. - These actions constitute the physiologic basis of therapeutic effect of dopamine agonists in hyperprolactinemia. Prolactin acts on the breast tissue where in the setting of estrogen priming, it stimulates lactation. Effect of physiological hormones on prolactin secretion Glucocoicoids seem to have an inhibitory role on PRL secretion. - These hormones stimulate the differentiation of somatotrophs but suppress that of lactotrophs. - Long-term elevation of the serum glucocoicoid levels by chronic administration of coicotrophin (ACTH) or hydrocoisone or by prolonged stress decreases PRL secretion. Estrogens and thyroid hormones have opposite effects on PRL synthesis and release. - \"Estrogen increases prolactin levelQ by acting at both pituitary and hypothalamic level\" - At pituitary level it increases prolactin secretion by controlling PRL gene expression and modifying its sensitivity to physiological stimuli. - At hypothalamic level it inhibits the activity of all three types of hypothalamic neuroendocrine dopaminergic neurone. - Low thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels increase TRH-induced PRL secretion, whereas high T4 and T3 levels inhibit PRL m. RNA accumulation and release. An impoant point Increased estrogen causes hyperprolactinemia But Hyperprolactinemia causes decrease in estrogen Prolactin also acts at the hypothalamus to inhibit the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (Gn. RH). - Inhibition of Gn. RH results in a decrease in the release of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary. In females - This leads to decreased in estrogen and progesterone synthesis and secretion by the ovaries and a failure of ovarian. follicular maturation. In males - This leads to decrease in testicular production and synthesis of testosterone and a halt in spermatogenesis.

        "question": "Resistance to drugs in tuberculosis develops by: March 2011, March 2013",
        "exp": "Ans. D: Mutation MDR-TB strains could arise as a consequence of sequential accumulation of mutations conferring resistance to single agents, or by a single step process such as acquisition of an MDR element. Resistance to common anti-TB drugs The most common mechanism of INH resistance is by mutation of the catalas-peroxidase gene so that the bacilli do not generate the active metabolite of 1. NH. Rifampicin resistance is nearly always due to mutation in the repoB gene (for the beta subunit of RNA polymerase-the target of rifampin action) reducing its affinity for the drug Resistance to Pyrazinamide develops due to mutation in the pncA gene which encodes for the enzyme generating the active metabolite of pyrazinamide Classification of mutation A. By effect on structure: Small-scale mutations, such as those affecting a small gene in one or a few nucleotides, including: - Point mutations, often caused by chemicals or malfunction of DNA replication, exchange a single nucleotide for another. - These changes are classified as transitions or transversions. - Most common is the transition that exchanges a purine for a purine (A 4-, G) or a pyrimidine for a pyrimidine, (C T). - A transition can be caused by nitrous acid, base mis-pairing, or mutagenic base analogs such as 5-bromo-2 deoxyuridine (BrdU). - Less common is a transversion, which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine (C/T A/G). - An example of a transversion is adenine (A) being conveed into a cytosine (C). - A point mutation can be reversed by another point mutation, in which the nucleotide is changed back to its original state (true reversion) or by second-site reversion (a complementary mutation elsewhere that results in regained gene functionality). - Point mutations that occur within the protein coding region of a gene may be classified into three kinds, depending upon what the erroneous codon codes for: Silent mutations: which code for the same amino acid. Missense mutations: which code for a different amino acid. Nonsense mutations: which code for a stop and can truncate the protein. - Inseions add one or more extra nucleotides into the DNA. They are usually caused by transposable elements, or errors during replication of repeating elements. - Inseions in the coding region of a gene may alter splicing of the m. RNA (splice site mutation), or cause a shift in the reading frame (frameshift), both of which can significantly alter the gene product. - Inseions can be reveed by excision of the transposable element. - Deletions remove one or more nucleotides from the DNA. - Like inseions, these mutations can alter the reading frame of the gene. - They are generally irreversible Note that a deletion is not the exact opposite of an inseion: the former is quite random while the latter consists of a specific sequence inseing at locations that are not entirely random or even quite narrowly defined. Large-scale mutations in chromosomal structure, including: Amplifications (or gene duplications) leading to multiple copies of all chromosomal regions, increasing the dosage of the genes located within them. - Deletions of large chromosomal regions, leading to loss of the genes within those regions. - Mutations whose effect is to juxtapose previously separate pieces of DNA, potentially bringing together separate genes to form functionally distinct fusion genes (e. g. bcr-abl). These include: Chromosomal translocations: Interchange of genetic pas from nonhomologous chromosomes. Interstitial deletions: An intra-chromosomal deletion that removes a segment of DNA from a single chromosome, thereby apposing previously distant genes. For example, cells isolated from a human astrocytoma, a type of brain tumor, were found to have a chromosomal deletion removing sequences between the \"fused in glioblastoma\" (fig) gene and the receptor tyrosine kinase \"ros\", producing a fusion protein (FIG-ROS). The abnormal FIG-ROS fusion protein has constitutively active kinase activity that causes oncogenic transformation (a transformation from normal cells to cancer cells). Chromosomal inversions: Reversing the orientation of a chromosomal segment. - Loss of heterozygosity: Loss of one allele, either by a deletion or recombination event, in an organism that previously had two different alleles. B. By effect on function Loss-of-function mutations are the result of gene product having less or no function. When the allele has a complete loss of function (null allele) it is often called an amorphic mutation. Phenotypes associated with such mutations are most often recessive. Exceptions are when the organism is haploid, or when the reduced dosage of a normal gene product is not enough for a normal phenotype (this is called haploinsufficiency). Gain-of-function mutations change the gene product such that it gains a new and abnormal function. These mutations usually have dominant phenotypes. Often called a neomorphic mutation. Dominant negative mutations (also called antimorphic mutations) have an altered gene product that acts antagonistically to the wild-type allele. These mutations usually result in an altered molecular function (often inactive) and are characterised by a dominant or semi-dominant phenotype. In humans, Marfan syndrome is an example of a dominant negative mutation occurring in an autosomal dominant disease. In this condition, the defective glycoprotein product of the fibrillin gene (FBN1) antagonizes the product of the normal allele. Lethal mutations are mutations that lead to the death of the organisms which carry the mutations. A back mutation or reversion is a point mutation that restores the original sequence and hence the original phenotype. C. By effect on fitness In applied genetics it is usual to speak of mutations as either harmful or beneficial A harmful mutation is a mutation that decreases the fitness of the organism. A beneficial mutation is a mutation that increases fitness of the organism, or which promotes traits that are desirable. In theoretical population genetics, it is more usual to speak of such mutations as deleterious or advantageous. A neutral mutation has no harmful or beneficial effect on the organism. Such mutations occur at a steady rate, forming the basis for the molecular clock. A deleterious mutation has a negative effect on the phenotype, and thus decreases the fitness of the organism. An advantageous mutation has a positive effect on the phenotype, and thus increases the fitness of the organism. A nearly neutral mutation is a mutation that may be slightly deleterious or advantageous, although most nearly neutral mutations are slightly deleterious. D. By pattern of inheritance: The human genome contains two copies of each gene - a paternal and a maternal allele. A heterozygous mutation is a mutation of only one allele. A homozygous mutation is an identical mutation of both the paternal and maternal alleles. Compound heterozygous mutations or a genetic compound comprises two different mutations in the paternal and maternal alleles. A wildtype or homozygous non-mutated organism is one in which neither allele is mutated. (Just not a mutation) E. By impact on protein sequence A frameshift mutation is a mutation caused by inseion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not evenly divisible by three from a DNA sequence. Due to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons, the inseion or deletion can disrupt the reading frame, or the grouping of the codons, resulting in a completely different translation from the original. The earlier in the sequence the deletion or inseion occurs, the more altered the protein produced is. In contrast, any inseion or deletion that is evenly divisible by three is termed an in-frame mutation A nonsense mutation is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon, or a nonsense codon in the transcribed m. RNA, and possibly a truncated, and often nonfunctional protein product Missense mutations or nonsynonymous mutations are types of point mutations where a single nucleotide is changed to cause substitution of a different amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as Epidermolysis bullosa, sickle-cell disease. A neutral mutation is a mutation that occurs in an amino acid codon which results in the use of a different, but chemically similar, amino acid. The similarity between the two is enough that little or no change is often rendered in the protein. For example, a change from AAA to AGA will encode arginine, a chemically similar molecule to the intended lysine. Silent mutations are mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid sequence of a protein. They may occur in a region that does not code for a protein, or they may occur within a codon in a manner that does not alter the final amino acid sequence. The phrase silent mutation is often used interchangeably with the phrase synonymous mutation; however, synonymous mutations are a subcategory of the former, occurring only within exons. The name silent could be a misnomer. For example, a silent mutation in the exon/intron border may lead to alternative splicing by changing the splice site, thereby leading to a changed protein. Silent mutations occur because of the degenerate nature of the genetic code. F. Special classes Conditional mutation is a mutation that has wild-type (or less severe) phenotype under ceain \"permissive\" environmental conditions and a mutant phenotype under ceain \"restrictive\" conditions. For example, a temperature-sensitive mutation can cause cell death at high temperature (restrictive condition), but might have no deleterious consequences at a lower temperature (permissive condition).",

Hepatic lipase - Conves IDL to LDL by hydrolysing the triglyceride content of IDL. Hormone sensitive lipase - Present intracellularly in peripheral tissue and causes intracellular lipolysis by hydrolysing triglycerides. Niacin (Nicotinic acid) inhibits intracellular lipolysis by inhibiting hormone sensitive lipase - intracellular FFA to liver - 4. 1, triglyceride synthesis. Niacin also increases the activity of lipoprotein lipase - T hydrolysis of VLDL triglyceride. Nicotinic acid also reduces the production of VLDL in liver by inhibiting TG-synthesis - indirectly the VLDL degradation products IDL and LDL are also reduced. Nicotinic acid is the most effective drug to raise HDL-CH. Increased HDL is due to interference of direct pathway of HDL cholesterol to liver which involves apo-Ai - Niacin decreases apo- A, mediated hepatic clearance.

This leads to disruption of the mitotic spindle apparatus and results in metaphase arrest since the chromosomes are unable to segregate. Since these drugs interfere with mitosis, they are considered cell-cycle specific for the M phase. Cytarabine belongs to the class of antineoplastics that are antimetabolites. This drug class interferes with normal metabolic pathways by competing for enzymatic sites. Specifically, cytarabine (Ara-C) is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog. It interrupts DNA synthesis and function by inhibiting DNA polymerase and incorporating into the DNA or RNA of the cell. As you would expect, this drug is cell-cycle specific for the S phase. Daunorubicin is one of the antibiotic antineoplastic agents (others include dactinomycin, doxorubicin, bleomycin, plicamycin, and mitomycin). These agents work by disrupting DNA functioning. Daunorubicin binds to DNA between base pairs on adjacent strands, resulting in uncoiling of the helix and destruction of the DNA template. While this drug has its maximum effect during the S phase, it is not cell-cycle specific. (Note: the only antibiotic that is cell-cycle specific is bleomycin.) Hydroxyurea works by interfering with ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, the enzyme responsible for generating the deoxyribonucleotides needed for DNA synthesis. It is S-phase specific.

Which of the following medications most likely caused the patient's rash?",
        "exp": "Warfarin is a coumarin anticoagulant used for the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with cardiac valve replacement and atrial fibrillation, as well as the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Warfarin may cause necrosis of the skin (typically on the breasts, thighs, and buttocks) generally between the third and tenth days of therapy. The lesions are initially sharply demarcated, erythematous, and purpuric. They may resolve or progress to large, irregular, hemorrhagic bullae that can eventually lead to necrosis. The mechanism for this reaction is related to warfarin's ability to deplete protein C, which can lead to a state of hypercoagulability and thrombosis in the cutaneous microvasculature. Aspirin is commonly used for its antiplatelet effect; however, it would not be indicated for anticoagulation of a patient with a recent cardiac valve replacement. Fuhermore, aspirin is not associated with the development of this type of skin necrosis. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic commonly used as a perioperative prophylactic agent. If the patient was allergic to this antibiotic, an erythematous rash might have appeared. However, the rash would not lead to the appearance of large, hemorrhagic bullae. Heparin is an intravenous anticoagulant indicated for the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with cardiac valve replacement and atrial fibrillation.

H has been shown to reduce the risk of osteoporosis in women. But long term use of estrogen leads to range of adverse effect including cardiovascular disease, stroke, pulmonary emboli and invasive breast cancer. These serious adverse effect made to look for other options. Selective estrogen receptor modulators These are class of compounds that act on estrogen receptors. Their characteristic feature is that they do not have pure agonist or antagonistic action on estrogen receptors. - Their selective action distinguishes these substances. from pure receptor agonist or antagonist. - SERMS are \"selective\" that means SERMS block estrogen in some tissues and activate estrogen action in others. - All the SERMS bind to the estrogen receptor but each agent produces a unique receptor drug conformation. - As a result specific coactivator or co-oppressor proteins are bound to the receptor resulting in differential effects. Two SERMS are currently being used Raloxifens For the t/t and prevention of osteoporosis Tamoxifen --> For the t/t and prevention of Breast Ca The. first SERM to reach the market was Tamoxifen which blocks the stimulative effect of estrogen on breast tissue and is used in breast cancer. Raloxifene is the second SERM to be approved by the FDA. Raloxifens has been approved for the tit and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Raloxifens acts like estrogen on bone and helps to build and maintain bone density. - Raloxifen has been shown in clinical trials to increase bone density in the spine and hip and to reduce the risk of spinal fractures in women with osteoporosis. While it acts like estrogen on bone, it blocks the action of estrogen on breast and uterus. - This profile makes it very useful for the t/t of osteoporosis because Raloxifene provides the bone benefits of estrogen without increasing the risk for estrogen related breast and uterine cancers. Raloxifene in Breast cancer Due to its antiestrogenic effect on breast, Raloxifene has been shown to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in women who are taking it for osteoporosis. Raloxifene reduces the risk of breast cancer by 50-70% in both low risk and high risk postmenopausal women. The national cancer institute U. S. A. funded the STUDY OF TAMOXIFEN AND RALOXIFEN (STAR) a clinical trial comparing raloxtfens with tamoxifen in preventing breast cancer, in postmenopausal women who are at increased risk of developing the disease. The study found that tamoxifen and Raloxifen are equally effective in reducing invasive breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women who are at increased risk of the disease. The study also. found out that women who took raloxifen had fewer uterine cancer and. fewer blood clots than women who took tamoxifen. However, Raloxifen did not decrease the risk of noninvasive breast Ca. On September 14 2007, the US. food and drug administration announced approval of raloxifens for reducing the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and in postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive cancer.",

It is the accumulation of formic acid which causes toxic effects in methanol poisoning. Accumulation of formic acid results in lactic acidosis/high anion gap metabolic acidosis with low plasma bicarbonates, blindness due to retinal damage, papilledema. Methanol poisoning can be treated by suppoive measures, gastric lavage and sodium bicarbonate (to treat acidosis). Ethanol is useful because it competitively inhibits the conversion of methanol to formic acid. Fomepizole can also be used as it is a specific inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase. Folic acid or folinic acid. Enhance the metabolism formic acid to CO2. Hemodialysis may also be used.",

        "exp": "Although factors such as idiosyncratic reactions or allergic reactions can contribute to the overall safety profile of a drug, the therapeutic index gives a reliable indication of the drugs safety margin if other considerations are assumed to be equal. The therapeutic index represents the ratio between the median lethal dose (LD50) and the median effective dose ( ED50) of a drug. This calculation of LD50/ DD50 generates an index that is the therapeutic window between the dose that produces the desired effect and the dose that results in toxic effects. Like all indices, the T. I. is dimensionless since the dose units, usually express in \"mg-kg \", cancel each other. The therapeutic index conveniently represents the safety merger of a drug. The greater the therapeutic ratio, or spread, between the ED50 and LD50, the greater the drug safety. Therefore a T. I. of one thousand represents a drug with a far greater safety profile than a drug with a T. I. of two. Ref: Von Zastrow M. (2012). Chapter 2. Drug Receptors & Pharmacodynamics. In B. G. Katzung, S.

Other treatment modalities in salicylate poisoning are external cooling and intravenous fluids with sodium, potassium, bicarbonate and glucose. Gastric lavage is done to remove the unabsorbed drug. Blood transfusion and vitamin K is given if bleeding occurs. Fatal dose in salicylate poisoning is 15-30gm. Serious toxicity occur at serum salicylate levels >50mg/dl. Manifestations include vomiting, dehydration, acidotic breathing, hypoglycemia, delirium, hallucinations, convulsion, coma and death due to respiratory failure and cardiovascular collapse.
