NH4+ excretion is reduced as a result of the diminished H+ secretion. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors restrict H+ secretion by inhibiting the intracellular hydration of CO2, a primary source of intracellular H+. The decline in H+ secretion inhibits the Na+-H+ exchange at the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule, which is the primary site of Na. HCO3 diuresis. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors also block the dehydration of H2. CO3 formed in the tubular lumen. Chronic doses of such drugs can lead to hyperchloremic acidosis (metabolic acidosis). Ref: Mc.

Cimetidine may have weak anti androgenic side effects resulting in reversible gynecomastia and impotence, primarily in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods of time. H2 receptor blockers like cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine inhibit gastric acid secretion but otherwise share no effects with H1 agents, do not produce significant intoxication. Also Know: Cetirizine have competitive antagonism/inverse agonism at H1 Receptors. It reduces or prevents histamine effects on smooth muscle, immune cells. It is clinically applied for IgE immediate allergies, especially hay fever, uicaria. Ethylenediamines (Prototype: Pyrilamine): These include some of the most specific H1 antagonists. Although their central effects are relatively feeble, somnolence occurs in a fair propoion of patients. GI side effects are quite common. Atropine sulfate, a naturally occurring antimuscarinic drug, competitively antagonizes the effects of acetylcholine and other muscarinic agents. It increases sinus node automaticity and AV conduction by blocking vagal activity. It thus has been termed a parasympatholytic drug. Ref: Skidgel R. A., Erdos E. G. (2011). Chapter 32.

        "exp": "A nondepolarizing skeletal muscle blockade caused by antagonists such as d-tubocurarine is produced when these drugs pharmacologically antagonize acetylcholine and bind N2-nicotinic receptors of the motor end plate. This binding hyperpolarizes the muscle cell membrane. Reversal of a nondepolarizing block requires additional acetylcholine to compete with the neuromuscular blocking agent. Indirect acting cholinergic drugs such as cholinesterase inhibitors potentiate acetylcholine levels, resulting in a non selective mechanism of action at cholinergic receptors. It is the nicotinic action of acetylcholine at N2-nicotinic sites that is responsible for reversing a nondepolarizing neuromuscular block. Sympathomimetics and sympatholytics are ineffective in reversing non depolarizing blockade because there are no adrenergic nerves innervating skeletal muscle. (There are a few b2-adrenergic receptors located on skeletal muscle cell membranes. Stimulation of such adrenoceptors may result in skeletal muscle fasciculation, but would not be sufficient to reverse muscle paralysis caused by a nondepolarizing blocker.) Parasympatholytics (also known as muscarinic antagonists) have no effect at the neuromuscular junction because muscarinic receptors are not found at such locations. Ref: Taylor P. (2011). Chapter 10.

A: Tetracycline Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection caused by unique serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis (L1, L2, L3) that are unlike those that typically cause urethritis, cervicitis, and proctitis (A-K). The hallmark of LGV is unilateral or bilateral tender lymphadenopathy that dramatically evolves 2 to 6 weeks after the primary lesion. The involved lymph nodes increase rapidly in size, and pain and erythema are common. If adjacent to one another, several involved lymph nodes may coalesce. The central areas of such lymph nodes can then undergo necrosis. Fluctuant and suppurative lymph nodes then develop, causing the classic 'bubo' of LGV. The bubo may then rupture and drain purulent material, which is associated with relief from symptoms. The 'groove sign' characteristic of LGV is seen if both the inguinal and the femoral nodes are involved. Tetracycline is the first choice drugs for LGV. Apa from LGV, tetracyclines are drug of choice for: STDs-Chlamydial non-specific urethritis/endocervicitis, granuloma inguinale Atypical pneumonia Cholera Brucellosis Plague Relapsing fever Rickettsial infections-typhus, rocky mountain spotted fever, Q fever etc.",

        "exp": "When high doses of ceain drugs are given their mechanism of elimination gets saturated and elimination kinetics changes from first order to zero order. Examples of such drugs are phenytoin, propranolol, theophylline, salicylates, and tolbutamide. Drugs that obey zero order kinetics are phenytoin, salicylates, ethanol, furosemide and indomethacin. In zero order kinetics only a constant amount of drug is excreted rather than a constant percentage or propoion. For drugs exhibiting zero order kinetics small increments in dose may cause dispropoionately large increase in serum concentration. Clearance and t1/2 of the drug varies with concentration of the drug. I st order kinetics: In this type of elimination, a fixed fraction of the drug present in the body is eliminated in unit time. Most of the drugs follow this type of kinetics. It works within physiological limits until elimination mechanisms are saturated. Ref: Pharmacology Re.

Indinavir Nelfinavir Saquinavir Ritonavir Lopinavir Pharmacokinetics of protease inhibitors are:? All HIV protease inhibitors are both substrates and inhibitors of CYP isoforms (family of P-450 isoenzymes) All the protease inhibitors undergo oxidative metabolism by CYP3. A4. The metabolism occurs predominantly in liver. All the protease inhibitors are inhibitors of CYP isoforms The rank order of CYP3. A4 inhibitor potency is ritonavir > (indinavir, amprenavir, nelfinavir > saquinavir). All HIV protease inhibitors are also substrates for P-glycoprotein, the multidrug efflux pump encoded by MDR-1. - This suggests that cells in the patient that express MDRI transpoer will be relatively, resistant to protease inhibitors. More about protease inhibitors Oral bioavailability of indinavir is decreased by food. It can cause thrombocytopenia and kidney stones. To prevent renal damage good hydration must be maintained. Side effects of Protease inhibitors Diabetes (hyperglycemia, insulin resistance) Lipodystrophy (hyperlipidemia, redistribution of body fat) Liver toxicity (less common side effect).",

D: Chronic Alcoholism Many commonly-used antibiotics, such as metronidazole or the macrolides, will greatly increase the effect of warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics can reduce the amount of the normal bacterial flora in the bowel, which make significant quantities of vitamin K, thus potentiating the effect of warfarin. In addition, food that contains large quantities of vitamin K will reduce the warfarin effect. Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements; hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment, while hypehyroidism (overactive thyroid) boosts the anticoagulant effect. Liver diseases, chronic alcoholism may enhance effect as synthesis of clotting factor may be deficient.",

Enhanced motility due to injected cholinergic drugs is more completely antagonised than that due to vagal stimulation, because intramural neurons which are activated by vagus utilize a number of noncholinergic transmitters as well.

It is rarely a myelosuppressnat. Bleomycin. It is a glycopeptide antibiotic produced by the bacterium Streptomyces veicillus. Bleomycin refers to a family of structurally related compounds. When used as an anticancer agent, the chemotherapeutical forms are primarily bleomycin A2 and B2. It works by causing breaks in DNA. The drug is used in the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma (as a component of the ABVD regimen), squamous cell carcinomas, and testicular cancer, as well as in the treatment of plantar was and as a means of effecting pleurodesis. Bleomycin acts by induction of DNA strand breaks. DNA cleavage by bleomycin depends on oxygen and metal ions, at least in vitro. Therefore bleomycin is used in combination with doxorubicin in Hodgkins lymphoma, as they have additive and complementary effects on the DNA, since doxorubicin acts by intercalating between DNA strands, and also acts on topoisomerase II enzyme thus relaxing the topoisomerase complexes. The most serious complication of bleomycin is pulmonary fibrosis and impaired lung function. It has been suggested that bleomycin induces sensitivity to oxygen toxicity. Other side effects include fever, rash, dermatographism, hyperpigmentation, alopecia (hair loss) and Raynaud's phenomenon (discoloration of fingers and toes).",

        "exp": "Ans. C: Adenosine Initial measures to terminate SVT should include vagal maneuvers. If unsuccessful, termination can be achieved with antiarrhythmic drugs whose primary effects increase refractoriness and/ or decrease conduction (negative dromotropic effect) over the AV node. These drugs can have direct (e. g., verapamil blocks the slow-inward calcium current of the AV node) or indirect effects (e. g., digoxin increases vagal tone to the AV node). In most patients, the drug of choice is either adenosine or verapamil. The advantages of adenosine include its rapid onset of action (usually within 10-25 seconds a peripheral vein), sho half-life (less than 10 seconds) and high degree of efficacy. Its sho half-life minimizes the severity of side effects, such as facial flushing, chest tightness, dyspnea and transient sinus arrest and/or atrioventricular block. In general, adenosine has an excellent safety record, but pause-dependent torsade de pointes may infrequently occur and transient atrial fibrillation may occur due to shoening of the atrial action potential. Adenosine should be given with caution to patients with bronchospasm and is contraindicated in those with sinus node dysfunction or second- or third-degree heart block. Dipyridamole potentates adenosine's effects by blocking its cellular uptake and aminophylline blunts its effects by competitive receptor antagonism. Sequential dosing can be given at 60 second intervals due to adenosine's rapid metabolism. In AV node reentry the most common site of termination is the anterograde slow pathway. Termination may also occur indirectly, i. e., due to adenosine - induced atrial or ventricular premature beats",

        "question": "Parameter which should be tested before staing heparin therapy: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. D: Activated paial thromboplastin time Monitoring of heparin therapy is done by either whole blood clotting time (kept 2-3 times the normal) or activated paial thromboplastin time (kept upto 1. 5-2 times the normal) Paial thromboplastin time/ PTT/ activated paial thromboplastin time (a. PTT/ APTT It is a performance indicator measuring the efficacy of both the \"intrinsic\" (now referred to as the contact activation pathway) and the common coagulation pathways. Apa from detecting abnormalities in blood clotting, it is also used to monitor the treatment effects with heparin, a major anticoagulant. It is used in conjunction with the prothrombin time (PT) which measures the extrinsic pathway. Kaolin cephalin clotting time (KccT) is a historic name for the activated paial thromboplastin time Blood samples are collected in tubes with oxalate or citrate to arrest coagulation by binding calcium. The specimen is then delivered to the laboratory. In order to activate the intrinsic pathway, phospholipid, an activator (such as silica, celite, kaolin, ellagic acid), and calcium (to reverse the anticoagulant effect of the oxalate) are mixed into the plasma sample. The time is measured until a thrombus (clot) forms. The test is termed \"paial\" due to the absence of tissue factor from the reaction mixture The typical reference range is between 25 seconds and 39 s (depending on laboratory). Shoening of the PTT has little clinical relevance. Normal PTT times require the presence of the following coagulation factors: I, II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII. Notably, deficiencies in factors VII or XIII will not be detected with the PTT test. Prolonged APTT may indicate: - Use of heparin (or contamination of the sample) - Antiphospholipid antibody (especially lupus anticoagulant, which paradoxically increases propensity to thrombosis) - Coagulation factor deficiency (e. g. hemophilia) To distinguish the above causes, mixing tests are performed, in which the patient's plasma is mixed (initially at a 50: 50 dilution) with normal plasma. If the abnormality does not disappear, the sample is said to contain an \"inhibitor\" (either heparin, antiphospholipid antibodies or coagulation factor specific inhibitors), while if it does correct a factor deficiency is more likely. Deficiencies of factors VIII, IX, XI and XII and rarely von Willebrand factor (if causing a low factor VIII level) may lead to a prolonged a. PTT correcting on mixing studies.",

        "question": "Features of atropine poisoning are all of the following except: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Hypothermia Sign and symptoms of atropine poisoning are due to peripheral muscarinic blockade (dilatation of pupils, hyperpyrexia due to inhibition of sweating) and central effects (initial stimulation and subsequent depresion of CNS; confusion and hallucination) Atropine It is a naturally occurring tropane alkaloid extracted from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), Jimson weed (Datura stramonium), mandrake (Mandragora officinarum) and other plants of the family Solanaceae. Atropine increases firing of the sinoatrial node (SA) and conduction through the atrioventricular node (AV) of the hea, opposes the actions of the vagus nerve, blocks acetylcholine receptor sites, and decreases bronchial secretions. Atropine lowers the parasympathetic activity of all muscles and glands regulated by the parasympathetic nervous system. This occurs because atropine is a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (acetylcholine being the main neurotransmitter used by the parasympathetic nervous system). Therefore, it may cause swallowing difficulties and reduced secretions Adverse reactions to atropine include ventricular fibrillation, supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia, dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, loss of balance, dilated pupils (mydriasis), photophobia, dry mouth and potentially extreme confusion, dissociative hallucinations and excitation especially amongst the elderly. These latter effects are because atropine is able to cross the blood-brain barrier The antidote to atropine is physostigmine or pilocarpine. A common mnemonic used to describe the physiologic manifestations of atropine overdose is: as per Jon Blinkey \"hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet, and mad as a hatter\". These associations reflect the specific changes of warm, dry skin from decreased sweating, blurry vision, decreased sweating/ lacrimation, vasodilation, and central nervous system effects on muscarinic receptors, type 4 and 5. This set of symptoms is known as anticholinergic toxidrome, and may also be caused by other drugs with anticholinergic effects, such as diphenhydramine, phenothiazine antipsychotics and benztropine",

        "exp": "Ans. D: Follows zero order kinetics at lower doses Phenytoin acts to dampen the unwanted, runaway brain activity seen in seizure by reducing electrical conductance among brain cells by stabilizing the inactive state of voltage gated sodium channels. Absorption of phenytoin by oral route is slowit is widely distributed in the body and 80-90% bound to plasma proteins. Phenytoin is metabolized in liver by hydroxylation and glucuronide conjugation. The kinetics of metabolism is capacity limited; changes from first order to zero order over the therapeutic range-small increments in dose produce dispropoionately high plasma concentrations. The plasma half life (12-24 hours) progressively increases (upto 60 hours) when plasma concentration rises above 10 microgram/ ml as metabolizing enzyme gets saturated. Aside from seizures, it is an option in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia as well as ceain cardiac arrhythmias. At therapeutic doses, phenytoin produces horizontal gaze nystagmus At toxic doses, patients experience sedation, cerebellar ataxia, and ophthalmoparesis, as well as paradoxical seizures. Idiosyncratic side effects of phenytoin, as with other anticonvulsants, include rash and severe allergic reactions. Phenytoin causes a reduction in folic acid levels, predisposing patients to megaloblastic anemia. Folic acid is presented as polyglutamate in foods, it is then conveed into monoglutamates by intestinal conjugase. Phenytoin acts by inhibiting this enzyme therefore causing folate deficiency. Phenytoin is a known teratogen. The syndrome consists of craniofacial anomalies (broad nasal bridge, cleft lip and palate, microcephaly) and a mild form of mental retardation (average IQ=71). This syndrome resembles the well-described Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and has also been called the \"fetal hydantoin syndrome. \" Phenytoin may accumulate in the cerebral coex over long periods of time, as well as causing atrophy of the cerebellum when administered at chronically high levels. Despite this, the drug has a long history of safe use and it is a common \"first line of defense\" in seizure cases. Phenytoin has been known to cause Drug-induced Lupus. Phenytoin has been associated with drug induced gingival enlargement (hyperplasia) in the oral cavity probably due to folate defiency. Patients whose epilepsy is treated with drugs face about twice the risk of suicidal thoughts compared to placebo-takers Phenobarbitone competitively inhibits phenytoin metabolism, while by enzyme induction both enhance each other's degradation. Phenytoin induces microsomal enzymes and increases degradation of steroids (failure of oral contraceptives), digitoxin, doxycycline, theophylline.",

D: Both subcutaneous and intramuscular route A depot injection is an injection, usually subcutaneous or intramuscular, of a pharmacological agent which releases its active compound in a consistent way over a long period of time. Depot injections are usually either solid or oil-based. Depot injections may be available as ceain forms of a drug, such as decanoate salts or esters. Examples of depot injections include Depo Provera and haloperidol decanoate. The advantages of using a long-acting depot injection include increased medication compliance due to reduction in the frequency of dosing, as well as more consistent serum concentrations. A significant disadvantage is that the drug is not immediately reversible, since it is slowly released.",

D: All of the above Medical care for Cushing syndrome can be summarized as follows: Agents that inhibit steroidogenesis, such as mitotane, ketoconazole, metyrapone, aminoglutethimide, trilostane, and etomidate, have been used to cause medical adrenalectomy. These medications are used rarely and often are toxic at the doses required to reduce coisol secretion. Efficacy of these medical interventions can be assessed with serial measurements of 24-hour urinary free coisol. - Patients receiving these medications may require glucocoicoid replacement to avoid adrenal insufficiency. - Metyrapone and trilostane are agents that competitively inhibit a single steroidogenic enzyme. Ketoconazole and aminoglutethimide act at several sites. Because ACTH production may persist or increase in patients with Cushing disease, radiation therapy of the pituitary is often required after unsuccessful initial therapy, either surgical or medical. These agents have higher efficacy when used in combination because they may act synergistically. Ketoconazole is probably the most popular and effective of these agents for long-term use and usually is the agent of choice",

The principal classes of xenobiotics of medical relevance are drugs, chemical carcinogens, and various compounds that have found their way into our environment by one route or another, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and ceain insecticides. In phase 1, the major reaction involved is hydroxylation, catalyzed mainly by members of a class of enzymes referred to as monooxygenases or cytochrome P450s. Hydroxylation may terminate the action of a drug, though this is not always the case. In addition to hydroxylation, these enzymes catalyze a wide range of reactions, including those involving deamination, dehalogenation, desulfurization, epoxidation, pre oxygenation, and reduction. Reactions involving hydrolysis (eg, catalyzed by esterases) and ceain other non-P450-catalyzed reactions also occur in phase 1. In phase 2, the hydroxylated or other compounds produced in phase 1 are conveed by specific enzymes to various polar metabolites by conjugation with glucuronic acid, sulfate, acetate, glutathione, or ceain amino acids, or by methylation. Conjugation reaction occurs in phase 2 and not in phase 1. Ref: Murray R. K. (2011). Chapter 53. Metabolism of Xenobiotics. In D. A. Bender, K. M. Botham, P. A. Weil, P. J. Kennelly, R. K. Murray, V.

It is rarely a myelosuppressnat Bleomycin It is a glycopeptide antibiotic produced by the bacterium Streptomyces veicillus. Bleomycin refers to a family of structurally related compounds. When used as an anticancer agent, the chemotherapeutical forms are primarily bleomycin A2 and B2. It works by causing breaks in DNA. The drug is used in the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma (as a component of the ABVD regimen), squamous cell carcinomas, and testicular cancer, as well as in the treatment of plantar was and as a means of effecting pleurodesis Bleomycin acts by induction of DNA strand breaks. DNA cleavage by bleomycin depends on oxygen and metal ions, at least in vitro. Therefore bleomycin is used in combination with doxorubicin in Hodgkins lymphoma, as they have additive and complementary effects on the DNA, since doxorubicin acts by intercalating between DNA strands, and also acts on topoisomerase II enzyme thus relaxing the topoisomerase complexes The most serious complication of bleomycin is pulmonary fibrosis and impaired lung function. It has been suggested that bleomycin induces sensitivity to oxygen toxicity Other side effects include fever, rash, dermatographism, hyperpigmentation, alopecia (hair loss) and Raynaud's phenomenon (discoloration of fingers and toes).",

Long acting miotic Atropine in ophthalmology Topical atropine is used as a cycloplegic, to temporarily paralyze the accommodation reflex, and as a mydriatic, to dilate the pupils. Atropine degrades slowly, typically wearing off in 7 to 14 days, so it is generally used as a therapeutic mydriatic, whereas tropicamide (a shoer-acting cholinergic antagonist) or phenylephrine (an alpha-adrenergic agonist) is preferred as an aid to ophthalmic examination. Atropine induces mydriasis by blocking contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle, which is normally stimulated by acetylcholine release, thereby allowing the radial pupillary dilator muscle to contract and dilate the pupil. Atropine induces cycloplegia by paralyzing the ciliary muscles, whose action inhibits accommodation to allow accurate refraction in children, helps to relieve pain associated with iridocyclitis, and treats ciliary block (malignant) glaucoma. Atropine is contraindicated in patients pre-disposed to narrow angle glaucoma.",

So, most of the time it is given by injection. But oral preparations are also available \"Despite the convenience of oral administration of penicillin G, this route should be used only in infections in which clinical experience has proven its efficacy\". -Goodman & Gilman So, option b is absolutely wrong and is the answer of our question. o Now see option C Penicillin G is a narrow spectrum penicillin, i. e. activity is limited primarily to gram positive bacteria but it has activity against some gram negative organisms also, e. g. meningococci, gonococci (if strains are sensitive), few strains of E. coli. So, option C is paially correct. About other options o Penicillin is primarily excreted by kidney --> 10-20% by glomerular filtration and 80-90% by active tubular secretion --> Active secretion'is inhibited by probenacid which increases blood concentration of penicillin. o Penicillin acts by inhibiting cell wall synthesis. Also know o Penicillin G (benzyl penicillin) has a sho VA. So, it has to be given 6-12 hourly. o Procaine penicillin and benzathine penicillin (longest acting) are long acting due to slow release. o Extended (broad) spectrum penicillins (Aminopenicillins, Carboxypenicillins and ureidopenicillins) are active against gram negative organisms as well (in addition to gram positive oraganisms, though their activity against gram positive organisms is less than penicillin G). o Activity of penicillins against gram positive organisms --> Penicillin G (max) > Extendend spectrum penicilins > b- lactamase resistant penicillins (methicillin & others).",

        "question": "Spironolactone is least commonly used in which of the following: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Hypertension As an add-on drug, spironolcatone may be useful in hypeensive patients with significant hyperuricemia, hypokalemia, or glucose intolerance Spironolactone It is a synthetic 17-lactone drug that is a renal competitive aldosterone antagonist in a class of potassium-sparing diuretics It used primarily to treat heart failure, ascites in patients with liver disease, low-renin hypertension, hypokalemia, secondary hyperaldosteronism (such as occurs with hepatic cirrhosis), and Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism). On its own, spironolactone is only a weak diuretic because its effects target the distal nephron (collecting tubule), where urine volume can only be slightly modified; but it can be combined with other diuretics to increase efficacy. Due to its antiandrogen effect, it can also be used to treat hirsutism. It is also used for treating hair loss and acne in women, and can be used as a topical medication for treatment of male baldness. It is commonly used to treat symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) such as excess facial hair and acne. Spironolactone can cause gynecomastia in males and, unless regularly monitored, should not be given with potassium supplementation for fear of development of hyperkalemia. Spironolactone inhibits the effect of aldosterone by competing for intracellular aldosterone receptors in the coical collecting duct. This decreases the reabsorption of sodium and water, while decreasing the secretion of potassium. Spironolactone has a fairly slow onset of action, taking several days to develop, and, so, the effect diminishes slowly. Spironolactone has anti-androgen activity by directly binding to and blocking androgens from interacting with the androgen receptor, by blocking androgen production, and by increasing estrogen levels. Production of androgens is decreased by inhibiting 17alpha-hydroxylase and 17, 20-desmolase, which are enzymes in the testosterone biosynthesis pathway. Estrogen levels are increased by enhancing the peripheral conversion of testosterone to estradiol and by displacing estradiol from sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) Spironolactone is a synthetic steroid that acts as a competitive antagonist to aldosterone. Its onset and duration of action are determined by the kinetics of the aldosterone response in the target tissue. Substantial inactivation of spironolactone occurs in the liver and hepatitis or cirrhosis can lead to secondary aldosteronism, which is one indication for treatment. Spironolactone is associated with an increased risk of bleeding from the stomach and duodenum Because it also affects androgen receptors and other steroid receptors, it can cause gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities and testicular atrophy. Spironolactone often increases serum potassium levels and can cause hyperkalemia, therefore, it is recommended that people using this drug avoid potassium supplements and salt substitutes containing potassium. Long-term administration of spironolactone gives the histologic characteristic of spironolactone bodies in the adrenal coex. Spironolactone bodies are eosinophilic, round, concentrically laminated cytoplasmic inclusions surrounded by clear halos in preparations stained with hematoxylin and eosin.",

        "question": "Effect of beta blocker's on hea are all of the following except: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Decreases duration of systole In the presence of increased sympathetic tone, beta blocker reduces the automaticity and prevents rise in heart rate; reduces myocardial contractility, cardiac output and stroke work; slows AV conduction, reduces myocardial oxygen demand and improves exercise tolerance Beta blockers/Beta-adrenergic blocking agents/Beta-adrenergic antagonists/Beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists/Beta antagonists They are paicularly for the management of cardiac arrhythmias, cardioprotection after myocardial infarction, and hypertension. As beta adrenergic receptor antagonists, they diminish the effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) and other stress hormones. Beta blockers block the action of endogenous catecholamines epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) in paicular, on beta-adrenergic receptors, pa of the sympathetic nervous system which mediates the \"fight or flight\" response. There are three known types of beta receptor, designated beta-1, beta-2 and beta-3 receptors. Beta-1-adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the hea and in the kidneys. Beta-2-adrenergic receptors are located mainly in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, uterus, vascular smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle. Beta-3-adrenergic receptors are located in fat cells. Stimulation of beta-1 receptors by epinephrine induces a positive chronotropic and inotropic effect on the hea and increases cardiac conduction velocity and automaticity. Stimulation of beta-1 receptors on the kidney causes renin release. Stimulation of beta-2 receptors induces smooth muscle relaxation, induces tremor in skeletal muscle, and increases glycogenolysis in the liver and skeletal muscle. Stimulation of beta-3 receptors induces lipolysis. Beta blockers inhibit these normal epinephrine-mediated sympathetic actions, but have minimal effect on resting subjects. That is, they reduce excitement/physical exeion on heart rate and force of contraction, and also tremor and breakdown of glycogen, but increase dilation of blood vessels and constriction of bronchi. It is therefore expected that non-selective beta blockers have an antihypeensive effect. Antianginal effects result from negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, which decrease cardiac workload and oxygen demand. Negative chronotropic propeies of beta blockers allow the lifesaving propey of heart rate control. The antiarrhythmic effects of beta blockers arise from sympathetic nervous system blockade - resulting in depression of sinus node function and atrioventricular node conduction, and prolonged atrial refractory periods. Sotalol, in paicular, has additional antiarrhythmic propeies and prolongs action potential duration through potassium channel blockade. Blockade of the sympathetic nervous system on renin release leads to reduced aldosterone the renin angiotensin aldosterone system with a resultant decrease in blood pressure due to decreased sodium and water retention Referred to as intrinsic sympathomimetic effect, this term is used paicularly with beta blockers that can show both agonism and antagonism at a given beta receptor, depending on the concentration of the agent (beta blocker) and the concentration of the antagonized agent (usually an endogenous compound such as norepinephrine). Some beta blockers (e. g. oxprenolol, pindolol, penbutolol and acebutolol) exhibit intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). These agents are capable of exeing low level agonist activity at the beta-adrenergic receptor while simultaneously acting as a receptor site antagonist. These agents, therefore, may be useful in individuals exhibiting excessive bradycardia with sustained beta blocker therapy. Agents with ISA (intrinsic sympathomimetic acitivity) are not used in post-myocardial infarction as they have not been demonstrated to be beneficial. They may also be less effective than other beta blockers in the management of angina and tachyarrhythmia Some beta blockers (e. g. labetalol and carvedilol) exhibit mixed antagonism of both beta- and alpha-1-adrenergic receptors, which provides additional aeriolar vasodilating action. They can also be used to treat glaucoma because they decrease intraocular pressure by lowering aqueous humor secretion. Non-selective agents - Alprenolol - Bucindolol - Caeolol - Carvedilol (has additional a-blocking activity) - Labetalol (has additional a-blocking activity) - Nadolol - Oxprenolol - Penbutolol (has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) - Pindolol (has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) - Propranolol - Timolol Beta-I-Selective agents Acebutolol (has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) - Atenolol - Betaxolol - Bisoprolol - Celiprolol Esmolol - Metoprolol - Nebivolol Beta-2-Selective agents Butaxamine (weak alpha-adrenergic agonist activity) - No common clinical applications.

Sucralfate is also used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and stress ulcers. Unlike the other classes of medications used for treatment of peptic ulcers, sucralfate is a sucrose sulfate-aluminium complex that binds to the mucosa, thus creating a physical barrier that impairs diffusion of hydrochloric acid in the gastrointestinal tract and prevents degradation of mucus by acid. It also stimulates bicarbonate output and acts like an acid buffer with cytoprotective propeies Sucralfate is a locally acting substance that in an acidic environment (pH < 4) reacts with hydrochloric acid in the stomach to form a cross-linking, viscous, paste-like material capable of acting as an acid buffer for as long as 6 to 8 hours after a single dose. It also attaches to proteins on the surface of ulcers, such as albumin and fibrinogen, to form stable insoluble complexes. These complexes serve as protective barriers at the ulcer surface, preventing fuher damage from acid, pepsin, and bile. In addition, it prevents back diffusion of hydrogen ions, and adsorbs both pepsin and bile acids.",

        "question": "Which of the following drug is contraindicated in glaucoma: September 2009",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Atropine Most categories of drugs that list glaucoma as a contraindication or adverse effect are concerned with inducing acute angle-closure glaucoma. These medications will incite an attack only in those individuals with occludable angles (ie, very narrow anterior chamber angles). The classes of medications that have the potential to induce angle closure are: - Topical anticholinergic (Atropine) or sympathomimetic dilating drops - Tricyclic antidepressants - Monoamine oxidase inhibitors Antihistamines - Antiparkinsonian drugs - Antipsychotic medications - Antispasmolytic agents. Sulfa containing medications may induce angle-closure glaucoma by a different angle-closure mechanism, involving anterior rotation of the ciliary body. Typically, the angle closure is bilateral and occurs within the first several doses of the sulfonamide-containing medication. Patients with narrow or wide open angles are potentially susceptible to this rare and idiosyncratic reaction. * Drug-induced elevation of IOP is more common by an open-angle mechanism: -- Coicosteroids are a class of drugs that may produce IOP elevation by this mechanism Atropine: Topical atropine is used as a cycloplegic, to temporarily paralyze the accommodation reflex, and as a mydriatic, to dilate the pupils. Atropine degrades slowly, typically wearing off in 7 to 14 days, so it is generally used as a therapeutic mydriatic, whereas tropicamide (a shoer-acting cholinergic antagonist) or phenylephrine (an alpha-adrenergic agonist) is preferred as an aid to ophthalmic examination. Atropine induces mydriasis by blocking contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle, which is normally stimulated by acetylcholine release, thereby allowing the radial pupillar dilator muscle to contract and dilate the pupil. Atropine induces cycloplegia by paralyzing the ciliary muscles, whose action inhibits accommodation to allow accurate refraction in children, helps to relieve pain associated with iridocyclitis, and treats ciliary block (malignant) glaucoma. Atropine is contraindicated in patients pre-disposed to narrow angle glaucoma. Adverse reactions to atropine include ventricular fibrillation, supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia, dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, loss of balance, dilated pupils, photophobia, dry mouth and potentially extreme confusion, dissociative hallucinations and excitation especially amongst the elderly. These latter effects are because atropine is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. A common mnemonic used to describe the physiologic manifestations of atropine overdose is: \"hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet, and mad as a hatter\". These associations reflect the specific changes of warm, dry skin from decreased sweating, blurry vision, decreased sweating/ lacrimation, vasodilation, and central nervous system effects on muscarinic receptors, type 4 and 5. This set of symptoms is known as anticholinergic toxidrome, and may also be caused by other drugs with anticholinergic effects, such as diphenhydramine, phenothiazine antipsychotics and benztropine. The antidote to atropine is physostigmine or pilocarpine.",

Most of the drugs in the second generation, known as atypical antipsychotics, have been developed more recently. All antipsychotic drugs tend to block D2 receptors in the dopamine pathways of the brain, but atypicals tend to act on serotonin as well. A number of (adverse) effects have been observed, including extrapyramidal effects on motor control - including: - Akathisia (constant discomfo to a varying degree causing restlessness), - Tremor, and abnormal muscle contractions, - An involuntary movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia, and - Elevations in prolactin (resulting in breast enlargement in men, breast milk discharge, or sexual dysfunction).",

        "exp": "Abdominal pain is the most common symptom in Acute intermittent porphyria and is usually steady and poorly localized but may be cramping. Seizures can be due to neurologic effects or to hyponatremia. Treatment of seizures is difficult because most anti seizure drugs can exacerbate AIP (clonazepam may be safer than phenytoin or barbiturates). The drugs which precipitate attacks of acute intermittent porphyria are microsomal enzyme inducers. They are metabolized by p450 enzyme. In response to these drugs the synthesis of cytochrome p450 proteins increases, leading to an enhanced consumption of heme, a component of p450 proteins. This in turn causes a decrease in the concentration of heme in the liver. Since the patient is deficient in enzymes synthesizing porphyrins it cannot makeup for the increase in demand of porphyrins. This leads to increased accumulation of porphyrin precursors precipitating attacks of porphyria.

        "exp": "The patient in this question was diagnosed with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. One of the most impoant initial measures in the treatment of this condition is to control the acid hypersecretion. Proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and lansoprazole, are given at a dose of 40-120 mg/day, and titrated to achieve a basal acid output of In standard doses, proton pump inhibitors inhibit 90-98% of 24-hour acid secretion. Proton pump inhibitors undergo rapid first-pass and systemic hepatic metabolism and have negligible renal clearance. Also know: Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein, normally produced in the kidneys, that stimulates stem cells to differentiate into rubriblasts, increases the rate of mitosis, increases the release of reticulocytes from the bone marrow and increases hemoglobin (Hgb) formation. EPO is indicated for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure, zidovudine therapy, chemotherapy, and for reduction of allogeneic blood transfusions in surgery patients. Famotidine is an H2-antagonist that decreases gastric acid secretion by competitively and reversibly inhibiting histamine receptors on parietal cells. Although famotidine could potentially be used in the treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a proton pump inhibitor is a more appropriate treatment measure. Fluorouracil or 5-FU, is an example of an antimetabolite that blocks the methylation reaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid. This results in interference with DNA synthesis, and to a lesser extent, RNA synthesis. 5-FU is indicated for the palliative management of colon rectum, breast, stomach and pancreatic carcinoma.
