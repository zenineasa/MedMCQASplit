Thromboxane antagonism, aspirin, and iron supplementation reduce cough induced by ACE inhibitors. Once ACE inhibitors are stopped, the cough disappears, usually within 4 days. Important points on ACE inhibitors. Enalapril, fosinopril, perindopril, and ramipril are prodrags. Captopril & lisinopril does not require hydrolysis to become active ACE inhibitor. Enalapril is converted in the body into enalaprilat. Enalaprilat differs from captopril in that it is an analog of a tripeptide rather than a dipeptide. Adverse effects of ACE inhibitors are cough; hypotension; hyperkalaemia; acute renal failure in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis, stenosis of the artery to a single remaining kidney, heart failure, or volume depletion owing to diarrhea or diuretics; teratogenicity; skin rash; proteinuria, angioedema and dysguesia.",

Sacubitril is a pro-drug used in combination with valsartan to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) and reduced ejection fraction. o. It acts by inhibiting neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase) which is responsible for the degradation of atrial and brain natriuretic peptide. o. ANP & BNP are released under atrial and ventricle stress, which activate downstream receptors leading to vasodilation, natriuresis and diuresis. o. Inhibition of neprilysin leads to reduced breakdown and increased concentration of endogenous natriuretic peptides in addition to increased levels of vasoconstricting hormones such as angiotensin II. o. It is given in combination with valsartan which is an aangitensin receptor blocker, resulting in a decrease in vascular resistance and blood pressure. o. Most common adverse reactions (>=5%) are hypotension, hyperkalemia, cough, dizziness, & renal failure. o. Cardiovascular & renal effects of sacubitril is a result of the increased levels of peptides that are normally degraded by neprilysin. PHARMACOKINETICS OF SACUBITRIL* Class.
