Longstanding, stable, mild cases of rheumatoid arthritis can be treated with analgesics and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, it is now believed that the disease is best treated aggressively in its early phase before erosions and extra-articular pathology can occur. The treatment is with DMARDs such as methotrexate, gold, sulphasalazine/Salazopyrin, leflunomide, penicillamine and ciclosporin. The most recent development are anti- TNF drugs such as etanercept and infliximab and monoclonal antibodies like rituximab and ibritumomab.

D 28 protein on the T. cell. the result activated T. lymphocytes responsible for the release of pro inflammatory cytokines and maintenance of inflammation in RAAbatacept is a soluble recombinant fusion protein made up of the extracellular domain of human CTLAA and it competes with CD28 for binding on CD80/ CD86 protein thereby preventing full T-cell activation. Uses- in moderate to severe RA who had an inadquate respose to DMARDs such as mothotrexate or TNa inhibitors* RITUXIMAB - B- lymphocyte are derived from the bone marrow and are necessary for efficient immune response however in RA, B-cell can perpetuate the inflammatory process in the synovium by1. activating T-lymphocytes 2. producing autoantibodies such as anti CCP (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody) and rheumatoid factor and3. producing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF a and IL-1.

Too much HER2 protein is thought to cause cancer cells to grow and divide uncontrollably.
