The anticoagulant actions of warfarin occurs due to antagonism of Vitamin K, so quiet obviously, vitamin K is used for reversal of anticoagulant action of warfarin. Three forms of vitamin K are available for therapeutic use i. e. Phytonadione. Menaquinone. Menadione. To reverse the effect of overdose of oral anticoagulants, phytonadione is the preparation of choice because it acts most rapidly. Dose depends upon the severity of hypoprothrombinemia (measured INR) and bleeding. Unnecessary high dose is to be avoided because it will render the patient unresponsive to oral anticoagulants for several days. Management of bleeding due to over anticoagulation. Management of bleeding due to over anticoagulation is guided by the clinical state and the prothrombin time (it is expressed as International normalised ratio (INR), which is the ratio of prothrombin time in the patient to that in a normal (non anticoagulated person)INR 2. 0-4. 5-It is the normal therapeutic range.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Vitamin K o Dicumarol (Bishydroxycoumarin) is an oral anticoagulant, which act by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K dependent clotting factors. Oral anticogulantso They act indirectly by interfering with the synthesis of vit K dependent clotting factors in liver, o They interfere with regeneration of the active hydroquinone form of vit K, which is required for the final step gamma carboxylating glutamate residues of prothrombin (factor II) andfactor VII, IX and X. This carboxylation is essential for the ability of the clotting factors to bind Ca+2 and to get bound to phospholipid surface, necessary for coagulation sequence to proceed. Mechanism of actiono During g- carboxylation of the coagulant factor II, VII, IX and X in the liver, active vitamin K (Vit K hydroquinone) is oxidized to an epoxide (vit K epoxide). o Vit K epoxide must be reduced to vit K hydroquinone to become active once again (vit K cycle), o Vit K epoxide is reduced to vit K hydroquinone by vit K reductase. o This vit K reductase is inhibited by oral anticoagulants. o Factor VII has the shortest plasma t 1/2 (6 hrs), its level falls first when warfarin is given, followed by factor IX (t 1/2 24 hrs), factor X (i 1/2 40 hrs) and prothrombin (t 1/2 60 hrs). o Though the synthesis of clotting factors diminishes within 2-4 hours of warfarin administration, anticoagulant effect develops gradually over the next 1-3 days as the levels of the clotting factors already present in plasma decline progressively. Thus oral anticoagulants are used for maintenance for anticoagulation (for initiation heparin is used). o Protein C, protein S, osteocalcin are also inhibited because these proteins also contain glutamate residues that require vit K dependent gamma carboxylation. o Protein C and Protein S are anticoagulant factor and have a shorter t 1/2 than the procoagulant factors (II, VII, IX & X), and their more rapid decline in concentration creates a \"transient hvpercoagulahle \" state - Initiate anticoagulation with heparin until the effect of warfarin is well established. o Warfarin is the most popular oral anticoagulant. o Bishydroxycoumarin (Dicumarol) is the longest acting oral anticoagulant. o Ethylbiscoumacetate is the shortest acting anticoagulant. o Warfarin is rapidly and completely absorbed from intestines and is 99% plasma protein bound. Its kinetics changes from first order to zero order at higher concentrations. o For monitoring the effect of oral anticoagulant prothrombin time (PT) is used because they selectively inhibit the extrinsic pathway.",

Explanation: Heparin treatment is monitored using activated partial thromboplastin time (a. PTT). An a. PTT two to three times the normal mean a. PTT value generally is therapeutic. Prothrombin time (International Normalized Ratio) is used to monitor warfarin therapy. The low molecular weight heparin such as enoxaparin and tinzaparin and fondaparinux do not require a. PTT monitoring as with unfractionated heparin. Hence they can be administered even for out-of -hospital management. Another advantage with LMYV heparin is that they can be given by subcutaneous injection once or twice daily. Heparin and fondaparinux are mainly used in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism. Fondaparinux is a factor Xa inhibitor, which also has the same advantages of LMW - subcutaneous injection, no need of lab monitoring. Fondaparinux should not be used in the setting of angioplasty as it has a greater risk of catheter thrombosis. Anticoagulation ibn pregnancy is best managed with UFH, LMW heparin and fondaparinux since they do not cross placenta to cause fetal malformations as seen with warfarin. Fondaparinux is least likely to cause thrombocytopenia among the anti-coagulants.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Inhibiting Vitamin K dependent carboxylation o Warfarin inhibits vitamin K dependent carboxylation of clotting factors by inhibiting the enzyme Vitamin K epoxide reductase. Oral anticogulantso They act indirectly by interfering with the synthesis of vit K dependent clotting factors in liver, o They interfere with regeneration of the active hydroquinone form of vit K, which is required for the final step gamma carboxylating glutamate residues ofprothrombin (factor 11) and factor VII, IX and X. This carboxylation is essential for the ability of the clotting factors to bind Ca+2 and to get bound to phospholipid surface, necessary for coagulation sequence to proceed. Mechanism of actiono During g - carboxylation of the coagulant factor II, VII, IX and X in the liver, active vitamin K (Vit K hydroquimme) is oxidized to an epoxide (vit K epoxide), o Vit K epoxide must be reduced to vit K hydroquinone to become active once again (vit K cycle), o Vit K epoxide is reduced to vit K hydroquinone by vit K reductase. o This vit K reductase is inhibited by oral anticoagulants. o Factor VII has the shortest plasma t 1/2 (6 hrs), its level falls first when warfarin is given, followed by factor IX (t 1/2 A 24 hrs), factor X (t 1/2 40 hrs) and prothrombin (t t 1/2 60 hrs). o Though the synthesis of clotting factors diminishes within 2-4 hours of warfarin administration, anticoagulant effect develops gradually over the next 1-3 days as the levels of the clotting factors already present in plasma decline progressively. Thus oral anticoagulants are used for maintenance for anticoagulation (for initiation heparin is used). o Protein C, protein S, osteocalcin are also inhibited because these proteins also contain glutamate residues that require vit K dependent gamma carboxylation. o Protein C and Protein S are anticoagulant factor and have a shorter t 1/2 than the procoagulantfactors (II, VII, IX & X), and their more rapid decline in concentration creates a \"transient hvpercoagulable\" state - Initiate anticoagulation with heparin until the effect of warfarin is well established. o Warfarin is the most popular oral anticoagulant. o Bishydroxycoumarin (Dicumarol) is the longest acting oral anticoagulant. o Ethylbiscoumacetate is the shortest acting anticoagulant. o Warfarin is rapidly and completely absorbed from intestines and is 99% plasma protein bound. Its kinetics changes from first order to zero order at higher concentrations. o For monitoring the effect of oral anticoagulant prothrombin time (PT) is used because they selectively inhibit the extrinsic pathway.",

Vit K is usually ineffective because synthesis of clotting factor in liver is impaired.
