Gpl20 ofvirus interact with CD4 receptor of host cells. After fusion (binding) virus gets entry (in preintegration complex form) in the host cells. This step is inhibited by fusion inhibitors, also called entry inhibitors.Reverse transcription :- As the preintegration complex (virus) traverses the cytoplasm to reach the host nucleus, the viral reverse transcriptase catalyses the reverse transcription of the viral RNA into DNA. This step is inhibited by reverse transcriptase inhibitors.Integration :-After reverse transcription, viral DNA (synthesized from reverse transcription of RNA) is inte grated into the host chromosome by virus integrase (has endonuclease activity). This step is inhibited byIntegrase inhibitors.Replication (Transcription & translation) :-Viral DNA replicate with host genome and transcripts to form mRNA which is translated into protein. These proteins are inactive viron.Post- translational modification :- Inactive virion is transformed into active virion by post-translational modi- fication, a step catalysed by protease. This step is inhibited by protease inhibitors.The active virion is released from the host cell, which then is available to infect other host cells.Antiretroviral drugsNucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTls) -Zidovudin, Didanosine, Zalcitabine, Stavudine, Lami\\mdine,,4PS>><<c<<vr>.Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor - Tenofovir (Katzung 1 CP/e)Nonucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIS) - Nevirapine, Efavirenz, Delavirdine.
