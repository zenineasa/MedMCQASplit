This enzyme is relatively deficient in lung tissue.

As in the case of MTX, it is transported into the cell via the reduced folate carrier and requires activation by the enzyme FPGS to yield higher polyglutamate forms.While this agent targets DHFR and enzymes involved in de novo purine nucleotide synthesis, its main site of action is via inhibition of thymidylate synthase.At present, this anti folate is approved for use in combination with cisplatin in the treatment of mesothelioma - and as a single agent in the second-line therapy of non-small cell lung cancer.Cisplatin# Although the precise mechanism of action of cisplati n is still undefined, it is thought to exert its cytotoxic effects in the same manner as alkylating agents.It kills cells in all stages of the cell cycle, binds DNA through the formation of intrastrand and interstrand cross-links, and inhibits DNA synthesis and function.

Sickle cell anemia (Ref: Katzung l1/e p631-632; KDT 7/e p210, 863, 882, 6/e p203, 841]Methotrexate is not used in sickle cell anemia.\"Methotrexate is now considered the first line DMA RD agent for most patients with Rheumatoid arthritis. The anti- inflammatory effect of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis appears to be related at least in part to interruption of adenosine and possible effect on TNF pathways.\"Which DMARD should be the drag of first choice remains controversial and trials have failed to demonstrate a consistent advantage ofone over the other? Despite this, methotrexate has emerged as the DMARD of choice especially in individuals with risk factors for the development of bone erosions or persistent synovitis of >3 months duration because of its relatively rapidity of actiont its capacity to effect sustained improvement with ongoing therapy and the higher level of patient retention on therapy\"\"Methotrexate is a folate antagonist, it causes reduction in cells reproductive abilities. Methotrexate affects cells, which divides quickly. In psoriasis cells divide more than usual. Methotrexate binds to these cells and inhibits enzymes involved in rapid growth of skin cells. It is commonly used to stop the progression ofpsoriatic arthritis and less commonly used in the treatment of severe psoriasis with no arthritis component Methotrexate is an effective antipsoriasis agent. It is especially useful in acute generalized pustular psoriasis, psoriatic erythroderma, psoriatic arthritis and extensive chronic plaque psoriasis.Methotrexate although widely used has not been shown benefit in ankylosing spondylitis. There is not enough evidence to be certain of the benefit and harms of methotrexatefor ankylosing spondylitis amhnore research is needed. In ankylosing spondylitis the use of methotrexate is not recommended for the axial manifestations. The drug may have some efficacy- in the peripheral involvement. For this disease there is lack of clinical trials and most of the trials did not show efficacy on the axial symptoms of the disease.",

Cyclosporine (Ref: Goodman Gilman life p1008; Katzung I2/e p986; KDT 7/ep880, 6/e p837-839)Cyclosporine is a caicineurin inhibitor, which targets intracellular signaling pathways induced as a consequence of T celt--receptor activation.\"Perhaps the most effective immunosuppressive drugs in routine use are the caicineurin inhibitors. cyclosporine and tacrolimus, which target intracellular signaling pathways induced as a consequence of T cell-receptor activation. Although they are structurally unrelated and bind to distinct (albeit related) molecular targets. they inhibit normal T-cell signal transduction essentially by the same mechanism. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus do not act per se as immunosuppressive agents. Instead, these drugs bind to an immunophilin (cyclophilin for cyclosporine or FKBP-12 for tacrolimus). resulting in subsequent interaction with caicineurin to block its phosphatase activity. \"-- Goodman Gilman 12e p1008CyclosporineCyclosporine is produced by fungus Beauveria niveaQ.Cyclosporine suppresses some humoral immunity but is more effective against T cell dependent immune mechanisms such as those underlying transplant rejection and some forms of autoimmunityQ.Mechanism of Action:It preferentially inhibits antigen-triggered signal transduction in T lymphocytes, blunting expression of many lymphokines, including 1L-2 & expression of anti-apoptoiic proteins.Cyclosporine forms a complex with cyclophilin, a cytoplasmic-receptor protein present in target cells. This complex binds to calcineurin, inhibiting Ca2+ stimulated dephosphorylation of the cytosolic component of NFATQ.Calcineurin phosphatase activity is inhibited after physical interaction with the cyclosporine/ cyclophilin complexQ.Cyclosporine increases expression of TGF-b, a potent inhibitor of IL- 2-stimulated T-cell proliferation and generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)Q.Therapeutic Uses:Clinical indications for cyclosporine are kidney, liver, heart & other organ transplantation: rheumatoid arthritis; and psoriasisQ.Approved by the FDA to prevent & treat graft-versus-host disease in bone-marrow transplantationQSide-effects:Renal dysfunction, hypertension; tremor, hirsutism, hyperlipidemia & gum hyperplasiaQHypertension occurs in ~50% of renal transplant and almost all cardiac transplant patientsQ.Hyperuricemia may lead to worsening of gout, increased P-glycoprotein activity, and hypercholesterolemiaQ.Nephrotoxicity occurs in the majority of patients and is the major reason for cessation or modification of therapyQ.It is nephrotoxic, neurotoxic, causes hypertension (due to renal vasoconstriction & increased sodium reabsorption ), and increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma & infectionsQ.",

This activation occurs to a greater extent in normal tissue sites than in tumor cells.The free thiol acts as a potent scavenger of free radicals and superoxide anions to inactivate the reactive species of cisplatin and radiation therapy.Uses:To reduce the incidence of nephrotoxicity in ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer in conjunction with cisplatin-based chemotherapy andTo reduce the incidence of xerostomia in patients undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Sickle cell anemia Methotrexate in Rheumatoid arthritisMethotrexate is now considered the first line DMARD agent for most patients with Rheumatoid arthritis.Methotrexate is effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of Rheumatoid arthritis as well as slowing or halting radiographic damage.It has relatively rapid onset of action at therapeutic doses good efficacy, favourable toxicity profile, ease of administration and relatively low cost.The antiinflammatory effect of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis appears to be related at least in part to interruption of adenosine and possible effect on TNF pathways.Which DMARD should be the drug of first choice remains controversial and trials have failed to demonstrate a consistent advantage of one over the other. Despite this, methotrexate has emerged as the DMARD of choice especially in individuals with risk factors for the development of bone erosions or persistent synovitis of> 3 months duration because of its relatively rapidity of action, its capacity to effect sustained improvement with ongoing therapy and the higher level of patient retention on therapy.Methotrexate in PsoriasisMethotrexate is a folate antagonist. It causes reduction in cells reproductive abilities.Methotrexate affects cells which divides quickly.In psoriasis cells divide more than usual.Methotrexate binds to these cells and inhibits enzymes involved in rapid growth of skin cells.It is commonly used to stop the progression of psoriatic arthritis and less commonly used in the t/t of severe psoriasis with no arthritis component.Methotrexate is an effective antipsoriasis agent It is especially useful in.Acute generalized pustular psoriasis.Psoriatic erythrodermaPsoriatic arthritis andExtensive chronic plaque psoriasisMethotrexate in Ankylosing spondylitisMethotrexate although widely used has not been shown benefit in ankylosing spondylitis. There is not enough evidence to be certain of the benefit and harms of methotrexate for ankylosing spondylitis and more research is needed.In ankylosing spondylitis the use of methotrexate is not recommended for the axial manifestations.The drug may have some efficacy in the peripheral involvement.For this disease there is lack of clinical trials and most of the trials did not show efficacy on the axial symptoms of the disease.",
