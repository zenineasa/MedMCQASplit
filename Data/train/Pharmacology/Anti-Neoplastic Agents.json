This enzyme is relatively deficient in lung tissue. This may explain relative sensitivity of bleomycin to lung tissue. Type I pneumocytes are more vulnerable to bleomycin toxicity' and are destroyed by bleomycin.

Traditionally tracheal stenosis has been managed by thoracic and otorhinolaryngology surgeons. Endoscopic procedures are usually performed as bridge to definitive surgical intervention. With the development of interventricular pulmonology field in the last 20 years definitive management of tracheal stenosis using minimally invasive endoscopic methods becomes a possibility. Endoscopic surgery has been shown to be useful especially in patients who are deemed high risk and too unwell for reconstructive surgery. One of the main drawbacks of endoscopic t/t and surgery is the risk of recurrence of tracheal stenosis due to granulation and fibrotic tissue. Scar formation and restenosis is the main cause. Studies have shown that most of the recurrence of tracheal stenosis occurs within one to three months after the procedure and use of mitomycin C has been reported in case studies to reduce the rate of recurrence. Both in vitro and invivo mitomycin C has been proved to be a potent inhibitor of human fibroblasts at concentrations of. 04 mg/LTopical mitomycin C is a useful adjunct in the management of short concentric membranous stenosis which does not involve the cartilage.",

Pemetrexed. It is a pyrrolopyrimidine antifolate analogue'Jwifh activity in the S phase of the cell cycle. As in the case of MTX, it is transported into the cell via the reduced folate carrier and requires activation by the enzyme FPGS to yield higher polyglutamate forms.

Methotrexate is not used in sickle cell anemia. \"Methotrexate is now considered the first line DMA RD agent for most patients with Rheumatoid arthritis. The anti- inflammatory effect of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis appears to be related at least in part to interruption of adenosine and possible effect on TNF pathways. \"Which DMARD should be the drag of first choice remains controversial and trials have failed to demonstrate a consistent advantage ofone over the other? Despite this, methotrexate has emerged as the DMARD of choice especially in individuals with risk factors for the development of bone erosions or persistent synovitis of >3 months duration because of its relatively rapidity of actiont its capacity to effect sustained improvement with ongoing therapy and the higher level of patient retention on therapy\"\"Methotrexate is a folate antagonist, it causes reduction in cells reproductive abilities. Methotrexate affects cells, which divides quickly. In psoriasis cells divide more than usual. Methotrexate binds to these cells and inhibits enzymes involved in rapid growth of skin cells. It is commonly used to stop the progression ofpsoriatic arthritis and less commonly used in the treatment of severe psoriasis with no arthritis component Methotrexate is an effective antipsoriasis agent. It is especially useful in acute generalized pustular psoriasis, psoriatic erythroderma, psoriatic arthritis and extensive chronic plaque psoriasis. Methotrexate although widely used has not been shown benefit in ankylosing spondylitis. There is not enough evidence to be certain of the benefit and harms of methotrexatefor ankylosing spondylitis amhnore research is needed. In ankylosing spondylitis the use of methotrexate is not recommended for the axial manifestations. The drug may have some efficacy- in the peripheral involvement. For this disease there is lack of clinical trials and most of the trials did not show efficacy on the axial symptoms of the disease.",

Mechanism of action of mitomycin. Intracellularly it is converted to a metabolite, which acts as an alkylating agent that kills cells at G1-M phase. It inhibits DNA synthesis and cross links DNA at the N6 position of adenine and at the O6 and N7 position of guanine. In addition single stranded breakage of DNA and chromosomal breaks are caused by mitomycin. Some important points about mitomycin. Mitomycin acts preferentially on hypoxic cells. It is a potent radiosensitizer. It is absorbed consistently from G. L tract so it administered by intravenous infusion. Uses of mitomycin. Used as a combination therapy for the t/t of carcinoma of the colon or stomach. It is also used by direct instillation into the bladder to treat superficial carcinomas of bladder. Adverse effect.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Overproduction of DHFR \\Ref: Goodman Gilman 11/ep. 1336; Katzung 10/ep. 887\\Mechanism of action of methotrexate. Methotrexate enter the cell by reduced folate carrier. Once inside the cell methotrexate is poly glutamylated. The poly glutamylated forms of methotrexate are potent inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase. The poly glutamased forms of methotrexate are converted back to mono glutamate form in lysosomes by the glutamyl hydrolase and is subsequently effluxed from the cell. Methotrexate resistance can occur through any of the following five mechanism. Decreased entry into the cell due to impaired transport. Decreased retention as a consequence of lack of polyglutamate formation. An increase in DHFRAn altered mutated DHFR that binds less avidly than the normal enzyme to the drug. Increased level of lysosomal enzyme l glutamyl hydrolase that hydrolyse methotrexate poly glutamates. Decreased transportA common mechanism of methotrexate resistance is reduced folate transport carrier. The decreased transport is common mechanism to methotrexate resistance in relapsed ALL. Impaired Polvslutammation. The poly glutamated forms of methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase. The intracellular content of polyglutamate derivatives of methotrexate is controlled by a balance between fol polyglutamate synthetase and glutamyl hydrolase activity. Fol polyglutamate synthetase produces polyglutamate while l glutamyl hydrolase converts its bact to mono glutamate formA lower content of methotrexate polyglutamate could be due to decreased synthesis or an increased catabolism of methotrexate poly glutamates by l glutamate hydrolase. Increased DHFRThe main mechanism of action of methotrexate is inhibition of the enzyme DHFR. Methotrexate is a tight binding inhibitor of DHFR and the concentration of methotrexate required to achieve enzyme activity increases in direct proportion to the amount of enzyme in target cells. If is now well established that an important mechanism of resistance of cells to methotrexate is an increase in DHFR production due to amplification of the DHFR gene. Mutation in DHFRMutation is DHFR genes may be responsible for methotrexate resistance. Mutation in DHFR causes production of altered forms of DHFR that have decreased affinity for the inhibitor.",

TH edition, page 871, Lehninger biochemistry, 4th edition, page 877\"Protein that confers the ability to withstand methotrexate is an inhibitor of dehydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Methotrexate resistance occurs usually as a result of mutation or amplification of the DHFR gene\"During thymidylate synthesis, N5, N10- methylene tetrahydrofolate is converted to 7, 8-dihydrofolate. This cycle is a major target of several chemo therapeutic agents (5. FU & methotrexate). In cells, fluorouracil is converted to Fd. UMP, which inhibits thymidylate synthase. Methotrexate (structural analogue of tetrahydrofolate) inhibits dihydrofolate reductase by competitive inhibition. Remember: structural analogue and agonist are two different things: Methotrexate is structural analogue of H4 Folate still it antagonises Folate by reducing dihydrofolate conversion to H4 Folate by competitive inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase. Also know: AM1. NOPTERIN is another Folate analogue, identical to methotrexate except that it lacks a methyl group. TRIMETHOPRIM is another inhibitor of bacterial dihydrofolate reductase that was developed as an antibiotic. PROGUANIL is an antimalarial drug, which is a folate antagonist",

        "exp": "Ans, a. Cyclosporine (Ref: Goodman Gilman life p1008; Katzung I2/e p986; KDT 7/ep880, 6/e p837-839). Cyclosporine is a caicineurin inhibitor, which targets intracellular signaling pathways induced as a consequence of T celt--receptor activation. \"Perhaps the most effective immunosuppressive drugs in routine use are the caicineurin inhibitors. cyclosporine and tacrolimus, which target intracellular signaling pathways induced as a consequence of T cell-receptor activation. Although they are structurally unrelated and bind to distinct (albeit related) molecular targets. they inhibit normal T-cell signal transduction essentially by the same mechanism. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus do not act per se as immunosuppressive agents. Instead, these drugs bind to an immunophilin (cyclophilin for cyclosporine or FKBP-12 for tacrolimus). resulting in subsequent interaction with caicineurin to block its phosphatase activity. \"-- Goodman Gilman 12e p1008. Cyclosporine. Cyclosporine is produced by fungus Beauveria niveaQ. Cyclosporine suppresses some humoral immunity but is more effective against T cell dependent immune mechanisms such as those underlying transplant rejection and some forms of autoimmunityQ. Mechanism of Action: It preferentially inhibits antigen-triggered signal transduction in T lymphocytes, blunting expression of many lymphokines, including 1L-2 & expression of anti-apoptoiic proteins. Cyclosporine forms a complex with cyclophilin, a cytoplasmic-receptor protein present in target cells. This complex binds to calcineurin, inhibiting Ca2+ stimulated dephosphorylation of the cytosolic component of NFATQ. Calcineurin phosphatase activity is inhibited after physical interaction with the cyclosporine/ cyclophilin complexQ. Cyclosporine increases expression of TGF-b, a potent inhibitor of IL- 2-stimulated T-cell proliferation and generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)Q. Therapeutic Uses: Clinical indications for cyclosporine are kidney, liver, heart & other organ transplantation: rheumatoid arthritis; and psoriasisQ. Approved by the FDA to prevent & treat graft-versus-host disease in bone-marrow transplantation. QSide-effects: Renal dysfunction, hypertension; tremor, hirsutism, hyperlipidemia & gum hyperplasia. QHypertension occurs in ~50% of renal transplant and almost all cardiac transplant patientsQ. Hyperuricemia may lead to worsening of gout, increased P-glycoprotein activity, and hypercholesterolemiaQ. Nephrotoxicity occurs in the majority of patients and is the major reason for cessation or modification of therapyQ. It is nephrotoxic, neurotoxic, causes hypertension (due to renal vasoconstriction & increased sodium reabsorption ), and increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma & infectionsQ.",

        "exp": "Ans is 'b' i. e. Radioprotector Amifostine is an organic thio phosphate analog designed to produce preferential cytoprotection of normal tissues from cytotoxic therapies. The preferential cytoprotection is due to the activation of amifostine by membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase to the free thiol, WR-1065, the active form. This activation occurs to a greater extent in normal tissue sites than in tumor cells. The free thiol acts as a potent scavenger of free radicals and superoxide anions to inactivate the reactive species of cisplatin and radiation therapy. Uses: To reduce the incidence of nephrotoxicity in ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer in conjunction with cisplatin-based chemotherapy and. To reduce the incidence of xerostomia in patients undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. (Amifostine does not appear to adversely affect the antitumor activity of cisplatin or radiation therapy). To reduce the incidence of pneumonitis and esophagitis secondary to combined modality therapy for non-small cell lung cancer.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Sickle cell anemia Methotrexate in Rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate is now considered the first line DMARD agent for most patients with Rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate is effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of Rheumatoid arthritis as well as slowing or halting radiographic damage. It has relatively rapid onset of action at therapeutic doses good efficacy, favourable toxicity profile, ease of administration and relatively low cost. The antiinflammatory effect of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis appears to be related at least in part to interruption of adenosine and possible effect on TNF pathways. Which DMARD should be the drug of first choice remains controversial and trials have failed to demonstrate a consistent advantage of one over the other. Despite this, methotrexate has emerged as the DMARD of choice especially in individuals with risk factors for the development of bone erosions or persistent synovitis of> 3 months duration because of its relatively rapidity of action, its capacity to effect sustained improvement with ongoing therapy and the higher level of patient retention on therapy. Methotrexate in Psoriasis. Methotrexate is a folate antagonist. It causes reduction in cells reproductive abilities. Methotrexate affects cells which divides quickly. In psoriasis cells divide more than usual. Methotrexate binds to these cells and inhibits enzymes involved in rapid growth of skin cells. It is commonly used to stop the progression of psoriatic arthritis and less commonly used in the t/t of severe psoriasis with no arthritis component. Methotrexate is an effective antipsoriasis agent It is especially useful in. Acute generalized pustular psoriasis. Psoriatic erythroderma. Psoriatic arthritis and. Extensive chronic plaque psoriasis. Methotrexate in Ankylosing spondylitis. Methotrexate although widely used has not been shown benefit in ankylosing spondylitis. There is not enough evidence to be certain of the benefit and harms of methotrexate for ankylosing spondylitis and more research is needed. In ankylosing spondylitis the use of methotrexate is not recommended for the axial manifestations. The drug may have some efficacy in the peripheral involvement. For this disease there is lack of clinical trials and most of the trials did not show efficacy on the axial symptoms of the disease.",
