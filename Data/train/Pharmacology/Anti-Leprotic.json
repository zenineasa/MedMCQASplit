Ref. katzung 11th ed. /1468* Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic blistering skin condition, characterised by blisters filled with a watery fluid.* DH is neither related to nor caused by herpes virus: the name means that it is a skin inflammation having an appearance similar to herpes.* It characterized by intensely itchy, chronic papulovesicular eruptions, usually distributed symmetrically on extensor surfaces (buttocks, back of neck, scalp, elbows, knees, back, hairline, groin, or face).* Diagnosis is confirmed by a simple blood test for IgA antibodies, and by a skin biopsy in which the pattern of IgA deposits in the dermal papillae, revealed by direct immunofluorescence, distinguishes it from linear IgA bullous dermatosis and other forms of dermatitis.* Treatment: Dapsone is considered as drug of choice for DH.* In case of intolerance to dapsone, other drugs which can be used are: Colchicine, Tetracycline, Sulfapyridine.",

The tuberculoid leprosy has a shorter incubation period. Culture -M. Leprae can be cultured in footpad of mice. In fact it is the only certain way to identify mycobacterium leprae. It is 10 times more sensitive at detecting M leprae than are slit Skin smears. Drugs effective against M leprae - Rifampicin. Dapsone - Quinolone. Clofazimine - Minocycline. Ethionamide and protionamide - Clarithromycin. INH has no role in the t/t of M leprae. It is highly effective against M. Tuberculosis. Anti leprosy vaccine. Several 'candidate' vaccines have been tried against M. leprae but none of them have attained (Vaccinehood9 as yet. The most effective vaccine against M. Leprae is BCG vaccine + heat killed M. leprae Also know-Globi are characteristic of lepromatous leprosy. They are actually macrophages stuffed with Lepra bacilli and they form clumps.",
