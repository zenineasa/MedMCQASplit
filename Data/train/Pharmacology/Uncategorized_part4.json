        "question": "A girl on sulphonamides developed abdominal pain and presented to emergency with seizure. What is the probable diagnosis?",
        "exp": "Abdominal pain is the most common symptom in Acute intermittent porphyria and is usually steady and poorly localized but may be cramping. Seizures can be due to neurologic effects or to hyponatremia. Treatment of seizures is difficult because most anti seizure drugs can exacerbate AIP (clonazepam may be safer than phenytoin or barbiturates). The drugs which precipitate attacks of acute intermittent porphyria are microsomal enzyme inducers. They are metabolized by p450 enzyme. In response to these drugs the synthesis of cytochrome p450 proteins increases, leading to an enhanced consumption of heme, a component of p450 proteins. This in turn causes a decrease in the concentration of heme in the liver. Since the patient is deficient in enzymes synthesizing porphyrins it cannot makeup for the increase in demand of porphyrins. This leads to increased accumulation of porphyrin precursors precipitating attacks of porphyria.

        "exp": "The patient in this question was diagnosed with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. One of the most impoant initial measures in the treatment of this condition is to control the acid hypersecretion. Proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and lansoprazole, are given at a dose of 40-120 mg/day, and titrated to achieve a basal acid output of In standard doses, proton pump inhibitors inhibit 90-98% of 24-hour acid secretion. Proton pump inhibitors undergo rapid first-pass and systemic hepatic metabolism and have negligible renal clearance. Also know: Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein, normally produced in the kidneys, that stimulates stem cells to differentiate into rubriblasts, increases the rate of mitosis, increases the release of reticulocytes from the bone marrow and increases hemoglobin (Hgb) formation. EPO is indicated for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure, zidovudine therapy, chemotherapy, and for reduction of allogeneic blood transfusions in surgery patients. Famotidine is an H2-antagonist that decreases gastric acid secretion by competitively and reversibly inhibiting histamine receptors on parietal cells. Although famotidine could potentially be used in the treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a proton pump inhibitor is a more appropriate treatment measure. Fluorouracil or 5-FU, is an example of an antimetabolite that blocks the methylation reaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid. This results in interference with DNA synthesis, and to a lesser extent, RNA synthesis. 5-FU is indicated for the palliative management of colon rectum, breast, stomach and pancreatic carcinoma.

Substance P acts on these receptors and is responsible for chemotheraphy induced nausea and vomiting. Aprepitant acts as a substance P antagonist on NK1 receptors. Aprepitant has little or no affinity for Serotonin 5-HT3, dopamine or coicosteroid receptors. Aprepitant crosses the blood brain barrier. Aprepitant is used for chemotherapy induced nausea & vomiting (CINV), and post- operative nausea & vomiting (PONY). After absorption aprepitant is bound extensively to plasma proteins (>95%); it is metabolized avidly, primarily by hepatic CYP 3. A4 and is excreted in the stools. Aprepitant is contraindicated in patients on cisapride or pimozide, in which life threatening QT prolongation has been repoed.

If streptokinase is given to this patient, it may produce thrombolysis after binding to which of the following proteins?",

Plasmin directly cleaves fibrin, both between and within the fibrin polymers, thus breaking up thrombi and potentially restoring blood flow to ischemic cardiac muscle. This same mechanism of fibrinolysis is shared by urokinase and tissue-plasminogen activator (t. PA). Antithrombin III is a coagulation inhibitor that binds to and inactivates thrombin. Antithrombin III is anticoagulant, not fibrinolytic. Fibrin is not directly acted upon by streptokinase. It is indirectly cleaved through the action of plasmin. Protein C is a glycoprotein that modulates coagulation by inhibiting the procoagulant activities of factors V/Va and VIII/VIIIa. Protein C has no inherent fibrinolytic activity.",

Intravascular volume is often depleted, and initial fluids to restore volume should include isotonic saline or lactated Ringer's solution.

IV fluids containing 5-10% dextrose (glucose) should be used when the serum glucose levels fall to 200-300 mg/dL, since high doses of rapidly acting insulin can cause life-threatening hypoglycemia. Additionally, the serum potassium concentration should be watched very carefully, since potassium is co transpoed into cells with glucose in the presence of insulin. It is often the case that hyperkalemia is present initially, secondary to decreased cellular uptake of potassium with decreased cellular uptake of glucose. However, this can rapidly change when insulin drives glucose (with potassium) into cells, and a life-threatening hypokalemia can develop.

B: INH A long PAE has been noted with fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics Post antibiotic effect (PAE) It is defined as persistent suppression of bacterial growth after a brief exposure (1 or 2 h) of bacteria to an antibiotic even in the absence of host defense mechanisms. Factors that affect the duration of the post antibiotic effect include duration of antibiotic exposure, bacterial species, culture medium and class of antibiotic. It has been suggested that an alteration of DNA function is possibly responsible for post antibiotic effect following the observation that most inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis (listed below), induce long-term PAE against susceptible bacteria. Aminoglycosides, Fluoroquinolones, Tetracyclines, Clindamycin, Rifampicin and rifabutin Theoretically, the ability of an antibiotic to induce a PAE is an attractive propey of an antibiotic since antibiotic concentrations could fall below the MIC for the bacterium yet retain their effectiveness in their ability to suppress the growth",

Since this platelet mass acts as a matrix for fibrin clot formation, blocking platelets prevents clot formation. This mechanism has been utilized in patients with atherosclerotic disease to prevent intravascular clot formation, but may aggravate bleeding conditions such as this. Aspirin does not decrease the serum level of factor VIII. Factor VIII deficiency is the pathophysiology behind hemophilia A. Factor IX deficiency is associated with hemophilia.

The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes, and osteoahritis. Which of the following medications most likely caused the appearance of her signs and symptoms?",
        "exp": "Acute interstitial nephritis is due to a hypersensitivity reaction usually caused by a drug. Drugs implicated in the pathogenesis of acute interstitial nephritis include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and indomethacin; beta-lactam antibiotics, such as cephalothin and methicillin; sulfonamides; diuretics, such as furosemide and thiazides; and drugs like phenytoin, cimetidine, and methyldopa. The typical presentation for acute interstitial nephritis is the development of acute renal failure, fever, a maculopapular rash, and eosinophilia. The patient's periorbital edema and wheezing are also consistent with acute interstitial nephritis. Ibuprofen is the most likely causative agent for the development of the patient's signs and symptoms. Although the exact mechanism by which NSAIDs cause this disorder is not fully understood, it is believed to be related to their ability to decrease prostaglandin formation, which leads to a reduction in renal blood flow. None of the other medications are associated with the development of acute interstitial nephritis. Acarbose is an antidiabetic agent that delays the absorption of glucose from the intestinal tract. Clonidine is a centrally-acting antihypeensive agent used in the treatment of hypertension and prophylaxis of migraines. It has been shown to be efficacious in ameliorating symptoms of alcohol, tobacco, opiate, and benzodiazepine withdrawal. It is also used in the treatment of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity. Metformin is an antidiabetic agent that increases the binding of insulin to its receptor.

In cases of meningococcal meningitis, prophylactic treatment of close contacts with antibiotics (e. g. rifampicin, ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone) can reduce their risk of contracting the condition, but does not protect against future infection Routine vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), which is active against seven common serotypes of this pathogen, significantly reduces the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis. The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, which covers 23 strains, is only administered in ceain groups (e. g. those who have had a splenectomy); it does not elicit a significant immune response in all recipients, e. g. small children.

        "question": "Drug used in anaphylaxis: September 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Epinephrine Adrenaline 1: 1000 solution intramuscularly produces a dramatic reversal of the hypotension, bronchospasm and laryngeal edema and is life saving. Anaphylaxis It is defined as \"a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death\". It can result in a number of symptoms including throat swelling, an itchy rash, and low blood pressure. On a pathophysiologic level it is an acute multi-system type I hypersensitivity reaction. \"True\" anaphylaxis is caused by degranulation of mast cells or basophils mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE), and pseudo-anaphylaxis occurs without IgE mediation The most common areas affected include: skin (80% to 90%), respiratory (70%), gastrointestinal (30% to 45%), heart and vasculature (10% to 45%), and central nervous system (10% to 15%) Skin involvement may include generalized hives, itchiness, flushing, and swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat. Respiratory symptoms may include shoness of breath, wheezes or stridor, and low oxygen. Gastrointestinal symptoms may include crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Anaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen. Common triggers include insect bites or stings, foods, medication, and latex rubber. Foods are the most common trigger in children and young adults while medications and insect bites and stings are more common in older adults. Biphasic anaphylaxis is the recurrence of symptoms within 1-72 hours with no fuher exposure to the allergen. Anaphylactic shock is anaphylaxis associated with systemic vasodilation that results in low blood pressure. It is also associated with severe bronchoconstriction to the point where the individual is unable to breathe. Pseudoanaphylaxis has a similar presentation and treatment to that of anaphylaxis, however, it does not involve an allergic reaction but is due to direct mast cell degranulation. This can result from morphine, radiocontrast, aspirin and muscle relaxants. Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis with no absolute contraindication to its use. It is recommended that it be given intramuscularly into the mid anterolaterial thigh as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. Minor adverse effects from epinephrine include tremors, anxiety, headaches, and palpitations.",

Angiotensin conveing enzyme inhibitors include benazepril, captopril and lisinopril. They interfere with the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, act in the proximal convoluted tubule. They cause a self-limited sodium bicarbonate diuresis. They are used to alkalinize the urine, and for the treatment of metabolic alkalosis and glaucoma. Potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, triamterene, and amiloride inhibit the action of aldosterone. They are used in the treatment of hyperaldosteronism and potassium depletion.

        "exp": "The laboratory results indicate that the aerial pH, aerial PCO2, and plasma HCO3- concentrations are all low. These changes clearly demonstrate metabolic acidosis, which occurs commonly when a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is administered. The carbonic anhydrase enzyme attached to the brush border of the tubular epithelial cells normally catalyzes the dissociation of carbonic acid into water and carbon dioxide. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase prevents the removal of bicarbonate ions from the tubular fluid, which initially increases urine pH. The result is heavy spillage of bicarbonate in the urine, which is the hallmark of type 2 A (renal tubular acidosis). However, once the plasma levels of bicarbonate have decreased sufficiently, the bicarbonaturia ceases and the plasma HCO3- levels stabilize at a lower than normal level. Consequently, the urine pH falls typically to 4. 5-5. 0. Ref: Reilly R. F., Jackson E. K. (2011). Chapter 25. Regulation of Renal Function and Vascular Volume. In L. L. Brunton, B. A. Chabner, B. C.

For patients in whom medical therapy fails, other options include paralysis of the lower esophageal sphincter with intrasphincteric injection of botulinum toxin, pneumatic dilatation, and a Heller myotomy (which interrupts the muscles of the lower esophageal sphincter). Also know: Diphenoxylate is an opiate antidiarrheal, and would not be useful for achalasia. Famotidine is an H2 antagonist that would be useful in reducing stomach acidity, but would not directly affect lower esophageal pressure. Other drugs in this class include cimetidine, ranitidine, and nizatidine. Granisetron is a 5. HT3 antagonist and is used to prevent nausea and vomiting in patients who receive chemotherapy, and after general anesthesia. Other members of this drug class include ondansetron and dolasetron.

Tacrolimus acts as imnmunosuppressant by acting against calcineurin. The other calcineurin inhibitor is cyclosporine. Calcineurin inhibitors Calcineurin inhibitors are perhaps the most effective immuno-suppressive drugs in routine use. Role of calcineurin Calcineurin acts as a intracellular signal transductor. Once the T cell receptors are activated, signals are sent to the nucleus through the calcineurin, for the transcription of cytokine genes. This leads to production of IL-2 along with other interleukins. Interleukin-2 and other cytokines leads to the proliferation of cellular and humoral immunity. Calcineurin inhibitors, inhibitins the calcineurin. Mechanism of action of cyclosporin Cyclosporin enters the target cells and binds to a cytoplasmic protein called cyclophilin --> the complex then binds to and inactivates calcineurin -- decreased production of IL-2 --)decreased immune response. Tacrolimus The mechanism of action is almost similar to cyclosporine. The slight difference is that it binds to different cycoplasnzic protein which is FKBP, but the subsequent steps are same i. e. inhibition of calcineurin --4 decreased production of IL-2 -1 decreased immune response. More on Tacrolimus It is 10 times more potent than cyclosporine. Because of more potent action it is also suitable for suppressing acute rejection that has set in. It is paiculary valuable in liver transplantation because its absorption is not dependent on bile. It has the same toxicity profile as cyclosporine.",

Pituitary prolactin secretion is regulated by neuroendocrine neurons in the hypothalamus, the most impoant ones being the neurosecretory tuberoinfundibulum (TIDA) neurons of the arcuate nucleus, which secrete dopamine to act on the dopamine-2 receptors of lactotrophs, causing inhibition of prolactin secretion. Thyrotropin-releasing factor (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) has a stimulatory effect on prolactin release. Vasoactive intestinal peptide and peptide histidine isoleucine also help to regulate prolactin secretion in humans.",

        "question": "Which one of the following is most likely to result in contraction alkalosis?",
        "exp": "The term \"contraction alkalosis\" refers to the development of metabolic alkalosis (excess plasma HCO3-) when there is a loss of extracellular fluid volume (hypovolemia). Hypovolemia evokes numerous homeostatic reflexes that act to normalize extracellular fluid volume, including stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. In the kidney, elevated levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone increase Na reabsorption through processes that are ultimately coupled to hydrogen secretion. Consequently, volume regulation results in a net increase in plasma HCO3-. Correction is obtained when the lost volume is replenished through intake of water and sodium. Loop diuretics such as furosemide act primarily on the thick segment of the medullary and coical ascending limbs of Henle's loop. They inhibit the coupled transpo of Na+ and Cl- that results in the production of large volumes of relatively iso osmotic urine. Excessive use of these drugs can result in hypovolemia and contraction alkalosis. Antacid and infant formula can result in metabolic alkalosis but not as a result of hypovolemia. In patients with renal insufficiency, antacids containing calcium carbonate can increase the plasma HCO3- concentration. Infant formulas that contain sodium but very little chloride enhance Na+ reabsorption in the renal tubule and, like volume contraction, this results in an increase in urinary H+ secretion. Administration of laxatives or acetazolamide promotes metabolic acidosis. Laxatives result in the loss of intestinal fluids that are relatively alkaline and contain large amounts of HCO3-. Acetazolamide inhibits the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. As a result, acetazolamide reduces the reabsorption of HCO3- in the renal tubule. Acetazolamide is often used in combination with loop diuretics to correct the alkalosis caused by these compounds. Ref: Barrett K. E., Barman S. M., Boitano S., Brooks H. L. (2012). Chapter 35.

By mechanism The underlying mechanism can be immunological (such as in drug allergies) or non-immunological (for example, in photodermatitis or as a side effect of anticoagulants). A fixed drug eruption is the term for a drug eruption that occurs in the same skin area every time the person is exposed to the drug. Eruptions can occur frequently with a ceain drug (for example, with phenytoin), or be very rare (for example, Sweet's syndrome following the administration of colony-stimulating factors). By drug Examples of common drugs causing drug eruptions are antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs, sulfa drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), biopharmaceuticals, chemotherapy agents, anticonvulsants, and psychotropic drugs. - Common examples include photodermatitis due to local NSAIDs (such as piroxicam) or due to antibiotics (such as minocycline), and the rash following ampicillin in cases of mononucleosis",

        "exp": "Ans. D: Aspirin Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase enzyme. Cyclooxygenase is required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme. This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen), which are reversible inhibitors. Very low-dose, long-term aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation. This anticoagulant propey makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks. 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large propoion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin 12 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain fuher inhibition The main undesirable side effects of aspirin are gastrointestinal ulcers, stomach bleeding, and tinnitus, especially in higher doses. In children and adolescents, aspirin is no longer used to control flu-like symptoms or the symptoms of chickenpox or other viral illnesses, because of the risk of Reye's syndrome.

According to Katzung 11th/e p. 521 After major depression, anxiety disorders represent the most common application of antidepressants. A number of SSRIs and SNRIs have been approved for all the major anxiety disorders. About Antihistaminic agent Katzung says p (271) and 409. A common effect of first generation HI antagonist is sedation. The effect is sufficiently prominent with some agents to make them useful as sleep aids. Diphenhydramine and doxylamine are antihistamines will well documented CNS depressants effects ans are used as sleeping aids (should not be used. for more than two weeks). But KDT has opposite views on this (6th/e p 389) Some antihistamines (promethazine, diphenyl hydramine) some anticholinergic (hyoscine) and opioids (morphine, pethidine) have significant sedative action but are not reliable for treatment of insomnia. Phenytoin appears to be a safer option because at higher dses it causes sedation and is never used as sedative. It seems to be the more correct option.

The classic example of this mechanism is the quinidine group of drugs. The Fc poion of the antibody molecule is not involved in the binding process. - Drug binds to Fc, and drug-antibody complex binds and activates platelets. Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the classic example of this phenomenon. In HIT, the heparin-antibody-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex binds to Fc receptors on the surface of the platelet. Since Fc poion of the antibody is bound to the platelets, they are not available to the Fc receptors of the reticulo-endothelial cells, so therefore this system cannot destroy platelets as usual. This may explain why severe thrombocytopenia is not a common feature of HIT. -- Abciximab induced thrombocytopenia. Aspirin inhibits the release of ADP from platelets and their sticking to each other. However, it has no effect on platelet survival time and their adhesion to the damaged vessel wall.",

Currently, its main uses are in bone marrow transplantation, especially in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), where it is used as a conditioning drug. Its mechanism of action through alkylation produces guanine-adenine intrastrand crosslinks. This occurs through an SN2 reaction in which the relatively nucleophilic guanine N7 attacks the carbon adjacent to the mesylate leaving group.

C: Cyclophosphamide The oxazaphosphorine-alkylating agents cyclophosphamide is chemotherapeutic drug that is useful in the treatment of lymphoma, leukemia, and ceain solid tumors. It is inactive as such: prodeuces few acute effects and is not locally damaging. Transfromation into active metabolites (aldophosphamide, phosphoramide mustard) occurs in the liver. It is less damaging to the platelets, but alopecia and cystitis (due to another metabolite acrolein) are prominent. Congener of cyclophosphamide is Ifosfamide, whose dose limiting toxicity is hemorrhagic cystitis. To prevent it, mesna is routinely given with it. In rare cases, penicillins have been repoed to cause hemorrhagic cystitis in ceain patients. Case repos have implicated methicillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, and penicillin VK. Treatment with danazol, a semisynthetic anabolic steroid, has caused hemorrhagic cystitis in patients with hereditary angioedema. Other medications that have been implicated in the development of hemorrhagic cystitis in limited repos include temozolomide, bleomycin, tiaprofenic acid, allopurinol, methaqualone, methenamine mandelate, gentian violate, nonoxynol-9 suppositories inadveently placed in the urethra, and intravesical acetic acid.

Since folate is needed by rapidly dividing cells to make thymine, this effect may be used to therapeutic advantage. For example, methotrexate is used as cancer chemotherapy because it can prevent neoplastic cells from dividing. Bacteria also need DHFR to grow and multiply and hence inhibitors selective for bacterial vs. host DHFR have found application as antibacterial agents Variety of drug act as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase: The antibiotic trimethoprim and its derivatives brodimoprim, tetroxoprim, and iclaprim. The antimalarial drug pyrimethamine. The chemotherapeutic agents methotrexate and pemetrexed. Methotrexate acts on this enzyme binding to it some 1000 times more tightly than folate itself.",

They may be used to smoothen off the 'wearing off', increase 'on' time and decrease 'off' time, improve activities of daily living and allow levodopa dose to be reduced. Tolcapone It is a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). It is a selective, potent and reversible nitrocatechol-type inhibitor of the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). In comparison with entacapone, another nitrocatechol COMT inhibitor, tolcapone has a longer half life (2. 9 hours vs. 0. 8 hours) and can better penetrate the blood-brain barrier, acting both in the central nervous system and in the periphery. However, entacapone is less toxic for the liver. Tolcapone improves the bioavailability and reduces the clearance of levodopa and subsequently dopamine from the CNS. Without administration of tolcapone, the beneficial effects of levodopa tend to wear off more quickly, resulting in motor fluctuations.",

        "question": "Which of the following is not an example of nonlinear kinetics -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Metabolism of diazepam Pharmacological basis of zero order kinetics o At higher concentration, the kinetics of some drugs changes from linear (first order) to non-linear (zero-order). o This is because, metabolic or other elimination pathway become saturated, so the drug can not be eliminated at the same rate as in lower concentrations. How does it occur? o Elimination of a drug is dependent on metabolism or other pathway of elimination (for example renal excretion). o At higher concentration these elimination pathways (metabolsim and renal excretion) becomes saturated. o Taking an example of a drug that is metabolized: - a Suppose, 1000 molecules of an enzyme are available to metabolize a drug and the usual concentration of drug is 100 molecules. Then only 100 out of 1000 molecules of the enzyme are required to metabolize the drug and they metabolize the 50% of drug in 5 hours (t% 5 hours). Now, we give double dose of drug, 200 out of 1000 molecules will be required and they will metabolize the 50% of drug in same t1/2 (as all enzyme molecules have same metabolizing propeies). That means at lower Concentrations:-0 P/2 remains constant ii) Rate of elimination is propoional to plasma concentration (In this example), when the concentration was 100 molecules, 50 molecules (50% of 100 molecules) were metabolized in one 0/2; and when the concentration was 200 molecules, 100 molecules (50% of 200 molecules) were metabolized in one t1/2 --> Constant fraction of drug is eliminated per unit time. iii) Clearance remains constant becuase, as the plasma concentration increases, rate of elimination increases propoionaly. iv) This is first order kinetic So drug will follow first order kinetic up to the dose of 1000 molecules. However, if we give sufficiently high dose, e. g., 1500 molecules, 1500 molecules of enzyme will be required to metabolize the drug. But we have only 1000 molecules of enzyme. Therefore all enzyme molecules will act only on 1000 molecules of drugs and remaining 500 will he metabolize latter when the enzyme molecules become free from the already existing metabolic reaction (metabolism of first 1000 molecules of drug). Therefore, at higher concentration. -0 t% increases with increasing concentration as the enzyme molecules can metabolize 1000 molecules of drug and above this concentration t1/2 will increase with increasing concentration. ii) Constant amount of drug is eliminated per unit time (In this example 1000 molecules). iii) Clearance is more at lower concentration and less at higher concentration (CL = rate of elimination/ Plasma conc.). In sho o At lower concentration ofdrug, elimination pathways (metabolism or excretion) are present in sufficient amount and are not a limiting factor for elimination Drug metabolism follows first order kinetics. o At higher concentration of drug, elimination pathways become saturated and are a limiting factor for drug elimination --) Drug metabolism follows zero order kinetics. So, the drug whose elimination pathway become saturated at higher concentration follows zero order kinetics at higher concentration. Examples are Aspirin, Alcohol, Warfarin, Theophylline, Tolbutamide. o It should be kept in the mind that non-linear kinetics (zero-order) is not: only due to saturation of metabolism, it may also occur due to saturation of other elimination pathway e. g. Renal excretion, Biliary secretion. Process saturated Drugs o Metabolism Phenytoin, alcohol, theophylline, warfarine, aspirin, toibutamide o Renal excretion Naproxen, mezlocillin o Biliary secretion Cimitidine, Isotretinoin, BSA o Absorption Riboflavin, Peniefilins",

Anti TNF a the therapy in Hepatitis B For the treatment of HBV, Anti TNF- atherapy showed cases of fulminant HBV reactivation. But any HBV reactivation was treated success fully with lamivudine therapy, thus it was concluded that physicians should consider antiviral therapy in patients with HBV (with or without active viral replication) and initiated treatment should continue for 3-6 months after stopping anti TNF- therapy. Both published British society of Rheumatology guidelines and British society of Gastroenterology guidelines concludes:- Successful treatment of active RA with anti TNF a in patients chronically infected with HBV is possible and can be safe. Our findings together with those of others, suggest that chronic HBV infection need not preclude therapy with anti TNF a where clinically indicated but an individualized approach is required including careful counseling, collaboration with colleagues in gastroenterology and intensive monitoring. HIV and anti TNF- a therapy As of now there are only eight patients treated with HIV and Rheumatoid disease. Retrospective series of eight patients suggests that treatment with anti TNF- a therapy can be used in HIV patients without advanced disease with associated rheumatic diseases. HCV and anti TNF-- cc therapy Anti TNF- a therapy is safe in patients with HCV and Rheumatoid ahritis. In a study involving 31 patients with RA with concomitant HCV infection, TNF a blocker seemed to be safe provided there is close monitoring of clinical virological data.

Carisoprodol is metabolized into meprobamate. Enalapril is conveed by esterase to the active enalaprilat. Acyclovir is conveed into the active acyclovir triphosphate. Fosamprenavir is hydrolysed to the active amprenavir. Levodopa is conveed by DOPA decarboxylase to the active dopamine. Chloramphenicol succinate ester is used as an intravenous prodrug of chloramphenicol, because pure chloramphenicol does not dissolve in water. Psilocybin is dephosphorylated to the active psilocin. Heroin is deacetylated by esterase to the active morphine. Codeine is demethylated by the liver enzyme CYP2. D6 to the active morphine, as well as several other compounds that may be active in analgesia. Molsidomine is metabolized into SIN-1 which decomposes into the active compound nitric oxide. Paliperidone is an atypical antipsychotic for schizophrenia. It is the active metabolite of risperidone. Prednisone, a synthetic coico-steroid drug, is conveed by the liver into the active drug prednisolone, which is also a steroid. Primid one is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes into phenobarbital, which is major and phenylethylmalonamide, which is minor. Dipivefrine, given topically as an anti-glaucoma drug, is conveed to epinephrine. Lisdexamfetamine is metabolized in the small intestine to produce dextroamphetamine at a controlled (slow) rate for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Diethylpropion is a diet pill that does not become active as a monoamine releaser or reuptake inhibitor until it has been N-dealkylated to ethylpropion. Fesoterodine is an antimuscarinic that is conveed to tolterodine. Alpha-methyldopa is conveed into alpha-methylnorepinephrine. Sulindac is conveed into sulfide metabolite. Proguanil is conveed into cycloguanil.",

The precise mechanism by which opioids can cause muscular rigidity is not clearly understood. Muscle rigidity is not due to direct action on muscle fibres because it can be decreased or prevented by pretreatment with muscle relaxants. In addition, opioid induced muscle rigidity is not associated with increase in creatinine kinase a. finding suggesting that little or no muscle damage occurs during this period. - Opioids do not have any significant effect on neuromuscular conduction and result in only minimal depression of monosynaptic reflexes associated with muscle stretch receptors. - Some investigators have suggested that opioids produce rigidity by altering dopamine concentrations within the striatum. s of the brain. Rigidity may occur due to the result of stimulation of GABA ergic interneurons which can be blocked by lesion in the striatum. Continuous research and data seems to indicate that the main mechanism responsible for opioid induced muscle rigidity is stimulation of it receptors. - Opioids appear to produce their physiological effects by. binding to at least three types of opioid receptors the mu (p), delta (8) and Kappa (x) receptors. - Muscle rigidity occurs after administration of supra analgesic doses of potent p preferring opioids. - The present data demonstrates that whereas systemic opiate induced muscle rigidity is primarily due to the activation of central mu receptors, supraspinal delta and kapp receptors may attenuate this effect. Anaesthesia review by Michelle Bowman Howard states (p134) -All opioids given in high doses may cause muscular rigidity. It is most likely related to I. i receptors in the caudate nucleus.

This increased sensitivity is due to increased number of b-receptors. So, quick relief can be obtained by blocking b-receptors.

Orlistat may cause frequent, oily bowel movements (steatorrhea), but if fat in the diet is reduced, symptoms often improve. Sibutramine is an anorectic or appetite suppressant, reducing the desire to eat. Sibutramine may increase blood pressure and may cause dry mouth, constipation, headache, and insomnia. Rimonabant is a recently developed anti-obesity medication. It is cannabinoid (CB1) receptor antagonist that acts centrally on the brain thus decreasing appetite. It may also act peripherally by increasing thermogenesis and therefore increasing energy expenditure. In people with Diabetes mellitus type 2, the drug metformin can reduce weight. olestra is a sucrose polyester which can be used as a cooking medium in place of fat.

Muscle relaxation is produced by action on medulla. Ataxia is due to action on cerebellum. BZDs acts on GABAA receptors. GABA,,, receptor has 5 subunits a / p, p, a / y. GABA binding site is on p. subunit, while BZDs binding site is on a / y subunit. BZDs receptor increase the conductance of Cl- channel. BZDs do not themselves increase Cl- conductance, i. e. they have only GABA facilitatory but no GABA mimetic action. (Barbiturates have both GABA facilitatory and GABA mimetic actions). Effect on CNS In contrast to barbiturates, BZDs are not general depressant, but exe relatively selective anxiolytic, hypnotic, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant effects. The antianxiety action of BZDs is not dependent on their sedative propey --> with chronic administration relief of anxiety is maintained, but drowsiness wanes off due to development of tolerance. Stage 2 sleep is increased, while REM, Stage 3 & 4 sleep are decreased. Nitrazepam is the only benzodiazepine, which increases REM sleep. Clonazepan and diazepam have more marked muscle relaxant propey. Clonazepam, diazepam, nitrazepam and flurazepam have more prominent anticonvulsant activity than other BZDs. Diazepam (but not other BZDs) has analgesic action. Diazepam produces sho lasting coronary dilatation on i. v. injection. Diazepam decreases nocturnal gastric secretion and prevents stress ulcers.",
