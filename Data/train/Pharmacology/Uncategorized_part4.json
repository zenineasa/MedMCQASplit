Lactic acidosis was found in patients with concurrent conditions that can cause poor tissue perfusion such as sepsis, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, renal failure.

He states that this \"flare-up\" is one of the worst he has ever experienced. Radiographic examination reveals evidence of ulceration, stricture, and fistula development of the colon and small bowel. Which of the following drugs would be MOST useful for treating this patient?",
        "exp": "The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of Crohn's disease, which is an idiopathic inflammatory process that can affect any poion of the alimentary tract. This condition is often characterized by intermittent bouts of low-grade fever, diarrhea, malaise, and weight loss, as well as focal tenderness and a palpable tender mass in the lower abdomen. There is radiographic evidence of ulceration, stricturing, or fistulas of the small intestine and colon. Nonpharmacologic therapy can be efficacious in some cases, but more severe cases may require coicosteroids, such as prednisone, which dramatically suppress the clinical signs and symptoms. Antidiarrheal agents (eg, diphenoxylate with atropine or loperamide) should be used very cautiously in these patients since there is a very high risk of toxic megacolon. Hydrocoisone suppositories are indicated for the treatment of distal ulcerative colitis, not Crohn's disease. Hyoscyamine is an anticholinergic agent that may allete the postprandial abdominal pain of a patient with irritable bowel syndrome when administered 30-60 minutes before a meal. Mesalamine is a 5-aminosalicylic acid derivative indicated for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Although this agent may provide some benefit in the treatment of Crohn's disease, prednisone is the drug of choice for treatment of acute \"flare-ups\" seen in patients with this disease.",

Gn. RH agonists have action similar to Gonadotropin releasing hormone, i. e., they increase the secretion of gonadotropins (FSH, LH). Then how do they suppress gonadol function? Lets see. Gn. RH agonists increases Gn secretion. But after 1-2 weeks they cause desensitization and down-regulation of FSH/LH receptors. (continous exposure to agonist may cause down regulation of receptors) --> suppression of gonadal function. Spermatogenesis/ovulation cease and testosterone/estrogen levels fall to castration level because the action of Gonadotropins (FSH & LH) is not there (these hormones promote gametogenesis and secretion of gonadal hormones). Preparation of superactive Gn. RH analogues are --> Busereline, Goserelin, Leuprolide, Nafarelin, Triptorelin. Superactive/Long acting Gn. RH are used as nasal spray or SC injection.

Combinations of Mg2+ (rapidly reacting) and A13+ (slowly reacting) hydroxides provide a relatively balanced and sustained neutralizing capacity and are preferred by most expes.

Impaired Polyglutammation The polyglutammated. forms of methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase.

It is the range of dosage that can effectively treat a condition while still remaining safe, i. e. therapeutic window is the range between the lowest dose that has a positive effect and the highest dose before the negative effects outweigh the positive effect. Doses below the therapeutic window are too weak to have any effect and doses above the window cause unacceptable side effects. o In a literal sense, therapeutic window is same as therapeutic range. o So, every drug will have a therapeutic window, i. e. the range of dose or plasma concentration below which the drug is ineffective and above which the drug causes unacceptable side effects. But, in general the drugs which have narrow therapeutic window (narrow therapeutic range) are considered to show therapeutic window phenomenon. o These drugs have already been listed in previous explanations. Drugs are i) Antiepileptics --> Phenytoin, carhamazepine, Lignocaine v) Lithium ii) Tricyclin antidepressants -- imipraminc vi) Aminoglycosides iii) Theophylline vii) Digoxin iv) Cyclosporine Note: According to KDT answer is 'd' i. e., clonidine: Read below Therapeutic window phenomenon Optimal therapeutic effect is exeed only over a narrow range of plasma drug concentration or drug doses; both above and below this range, beneficial effects are suboptimal ie. the effect declines if the doses arc increased beyond a ceain level.

Bupropion belongs to the chemical class of aminoketones and is similar in structure to stimulants cathinone and diethylpropion, and to phenethylamines in general.

Diuretics remains an important component of the symptomatic management of patients with CHF, but severely II patients may require additional agents. One option frequently used in patients who exhibit resistance to loop diuretics is an infusion of low-dose dopamine. Combination diuretics may effectively increase urine output, with the addition of thiazide or spironolactone. Documentation of the clinical benefit of ACE inhibitors represents the most important advance in therapeutics for CHF in the last decade. ACE inhibitors improve left the ventricular function, and survival and unless contraindicated, patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction should receive high dose ACE inhibitor with a diuretic if there is peripheral edema. For patients who cannot take an ACE inhibitor the combination of hydralazine and nitrates may offer some prognostic benefit.

Sulfonylureas are only useful in Type II diabetes, as they act on SURI receptors on pancreatic beta cell membrane, stimulating endogenous release of insulin. They work best with patients over 40 years old, who have had diabetes mellitus for under ten years. They cannot be used with type I diabetes, or diabetes of pregnancy. They can be safely used with metformin or -glitazones. The primary side effect is hypoglycemia. Meglitinides (Repaglinide/ nateglinide) help the pancreas produce insulin and are often called \"sho-acting secretagogues. \" They act on the same potassium channels as sulfonylureas, but at a different binding site. By closing the potassium channels of the pancreatic beta cells, they open the calcium channels, hence enhancing insulin secretion Biguanides (Metformin) reduce hepatic glucose output and increase uptake of glucose by the periphery, including skeletal muscle. Although it must be used with caution in patients with impaired liver or kidney function, metformin, a biguanide, has become the most commonly used agent for type 2 diabetes in children and teenagers. Amongst common diabetic drugs, metformin is the only widely used oral drug that does not cause weight gain Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) (rosiglitazone) bind to PPARd, a type of nuclear regulatory protein involved in transcription of genes regulating glucose and fat metabolism. These PPARs act on Peroxysome Proliferator Responsive Elements (PPRE). The PPREs influence insulin sensitive genes, which enhance production of m. RNAs of insulin dependent enzymes.

C: Antipsychotics Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) refers to the combination of hypehermia, rigidity, and autonomic dysregulation that can occur as a serious complication of the use of antipsychotic drugs. The list of atypical antipsychotic drugs that may cause NMS include olanzapine, risperidone, paliperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, amisulpride, and quetiapine. Clozapine may also be associated with the development of NMS, but it appears to be less likely to manifest with extrapyramidal features, including rigidity and tremor. The most widely accepted mechanism by which antipsychotics cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome is that of dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Central D2 receptor blockade in the hypothalamus, nigrostriatal pathways, and spinal cord leads to increased muscle rigidity and tremor extrapyramidal pathways. Hypothalamic D2 receptor blockade results in an elevated temperature set point and impairment of heat-dissipating mechanisms. Peripherally, antipsychotics lead to increased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in increased contractility, which can contribute to hypehermia, rigidity, and muscle cell breakdown.",

        "question": "To treat Methotrexate toxicity,......... is used: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Folinic Acid Folinic acid's only use is in the treatment of toxicity due to folic acid antagonists like methotrexate. Folinic acid/Leucovorin It generally administered as calcium or sodium folinate (or leucovorin calcium/sodium) It is an adjuvant used in cancer chemotherapy involving the drug methotrexate. It is also used in synergistic combination with the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil. Folinic acid should be distinguished from folic acid. Folinic acid is a 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid. It is readily conveed to other reduced folic acid derivatives (e. g., tetrahydrofolate), and, thus, has vitamin activity that is equivalent to that of folic acid. However, since it does not require the action of dihydrofolate reductase for its conversion, its function as a vitamin is unaffected by inhibition of this enzyme by drugs such as methotrexate. Folinic acid, therefore, allows for some purine/pyrimidine synthesis to occur in the presence of dihydrofolate reductase inhibition, so that some normal DNA replication and RNA transcription processes can proceed. Methotrexate It competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that paicipates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about one thousand-fold that of folate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Folic acid is needed for the de novo synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is needed for purine base synthesis, so all purine synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins. Methotrexate acts specifically during DNA and RNA synthesis, and thus it is cytotoxic during the S-phase of the cell cycle. Logically, it therefore has a greater toxic effect on rapidly dividing cells (such as malignant and myeloid cells, and gastrointestinal and oral mucosa), which replicate their DNA more frequently, and thus inhibits the growth and proliferation of these noncancerous cells, as well as causing the side effects. Methotrexate is a weak dicarboxylic acid with p. Ka 4. 8 and 5. 5, and thus it is mostly ionized at physiologic pH. Oral absorption is saturatable and thus dose-dependent Mean oral bioavailability is 33% (13-76% range), and there is no clear benefit to subdividing an oral dose. Mean intramuscular bioavailability is 76%. Methotrexate is metabolized by intestinal bacteria to the inactive metabolite 4-amino-4-deoxy-N-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA), which accounts for less than 5% loss of the oral dose. Factors that decrease absorption include food, oral nonabsorbable antibiotics (e. g. vancomycin, neomycin, and bacitracin) and more rapid transit through the gastrointestinal tract (GI) tract, such as diarrhea, while slower transit time in the GI tract from constipation will increase absorption. The most common adverse effects include: ulcerative stomatitis, low white blood cell count and thus predisposition to infection, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever, dizziness and rarely pulmonary fibrosis. Methotrexate is a highly teratogenic drug",

Additionally, the serum potassium concentration should be watched very carefully, since potassium is co transpoed into cells with glucose in the presence of insulin.

Some very impoant facts about second generation antihistaminics: Terfenadine Fastest acting antihistaminic Associated with Torsades De Pointes (Polymorph ventricular tachycardia) when given with drugs that inhibit CYP3. A4 - erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole. This toxicity is based on blockade of delayed rectifier K+ channels in the heart. Due to this toxicity, terfenadine has been withdrawn. Astemizole Slowest acting Like terfenadine it can cause ventricular arrhythmia. o It has also been banned for the same reason. Fexofenadine Active metabolite of terfenadine (also available as a separate drug). It has low propensity to block delayed rectifier K+ channels in the heart. It is largely free of arrhythmogenic potential, but some cases of ventricular arrhythmia in patients with prexisting long QT interval have been repoed. Thus, it is not entirely safe in patients with long QT, bradycardia or hypokalemia. Cetrizine Active metabolite of first generation antihistaminic drug, hydroxyzine (also available as a separate drug). In addition to H1 receptor blocking activity it inhibits release of histamine and cytotoxic mediators from platelets as well as eosinophil chemotoxis. Levocetrizine (1-isomer of cetrizine) is more potent and less sedative. Azelastine Has maximum topical activity and can be given by nasal spray for allergic rhinitis.

        "question": "A 15-year-old boy is subjected to recurrent attacks of asthma. A careful clinical history reveals that the asthma attacks occur most frequently after aspirin administration. Which of the following is the pathogenetic mechanism in this form of asthma?",
        "exp": "Aspirin-induced asthma is an infrequent form of asthma. It is related to the direct pharmacologic action of aspirin on the metabolism of arachidonic acid. Aspirin inhibits the cyclooxygenase pathway without affecting the lipoxygenase pathway, leading to a decreased ratio of prostaglandins (bronchodilators) to leukotrienes (bronchoconstrictors). The disrupted balance between these two groups of arachidonic acid metabolites leads to bronchoconstriction in predisposed patients. Direct release of bronchoconstrictor substances is one of several pathogenetic mechanisms that may mediate occupational asthma, triggered by inhalation of a number of chemicals, including epoxy resins, plastics, cotton fibers, toluene, formaldehyde, and penicillin products. Enhanced vagal stimulation plays an essential role in non-atopic asthma. This variety of asthma, AKA non reaginic asthma, is initiated by viral infections of the upper respiratory tract (e. g., common cold and flu), which appear to lower the threshold of respiratory mucosa to parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. Recall that vagal stimulation exes a bronchoconstrictor influence on the lungs. Type I hypersensitivity reactions are crucial in the pathogenesis of atopic asthma following prior exposure to a number of allergens. T-cell activation instructs B cells to produce IgE directed against a given allergen. On re-exposure, IgE on the surface of mast cells binds the allergen and induces mast cell degranulation. The mediators released from mast cells cause bronchospasm and recruit more inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, lymphocytes, and basophils. Ref: Barnes P. J. (2012). Chapter 254. Asthma. In D.

        "question": "All are true about ESBL except a. EUR'",
        "exp": "3rd and 4th generation sensitivity is must Penicillins were the earliest antibiotics to be developed. Penicillins and their related group of antibiotics were called fi lactam antibiotics because they contained a. four carbon ring called )3 lactam ring. Within a few years of introduction of penicillin, bacterias staed acquiring resistance against penicillins by producing penicillinase. To overcome this problem penicillinase resistant penicillins came into picture. Sholy afterwards, the broad spectrum penicillin and first gene- ration cephalosporins were introduced. They remained, first line antibiotics for several years. * Over a period of time bacterias developed resistance even against these organisms by producing fi lactamase. 13 lactamase are enzymes that break open the 13 lactam ring and deactivate the antibiotic. The fi lactamases hydrolyze penicillins and narrow spectrum cephalo- sporin, such as cephalothin or cefazolin, and are resistant to them. To counteract the problems against fi lactamases new classes of /3 lactams were developed. These are cephalosporins containing oxy- minio side chain e. g. ceftizoxime, cefotaxine, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone (broad spectrum cephalosporins). - Consequently, when these oxymino side chain containing corn- pounds were introduced they were effective against a broad group of otherwise resistant bacterias. - /3 lactamases cannot hydrolyze higher generation cephalosporins with an oxymino side chain (cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime). But not long ago after these cephalosporins came into use strains of klebsiella pneumonia were discovered which were resistant even to oxyimino containing cephalosporins e. g. (cefotaxime, cefazidime, ceftriaxone) The mechanism of this resistance was production of extended spectrum fi lactamase enzyme (ESBL). These bacterias are called ESBL bacterias Bucterias are classified as extended spectrum )3 lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria, when a simple point mutation occurs in genes normally responsible for beta lactamase mediated resistance. The mutation usually responsible is (TEM). As a result of the mutation, organisms, are able to produce novel beta lactamases that can hydrolyze all the 13 lactam containing antibiotics which includes even the oxyminio group containing cephalosporins (ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone), Aztreonam and all the older fi lactam drugs. Because of their greatly extended substrate range these enzymes were called extended spectrum filactamase ESBLS are capable of efficiently hydrolyzing:- Penicillins Narrow spectrum cephalosporins Many extended spectrum cephalosporins Oxyimino group containing cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime) Monobactams (aztreonams) Beta lactcunase inhibitors (clavulanic acid sulhactam) An impoant point None of the ESBLS described till to date are able to hydrolyze cephamycin or carbepenems (imipenem, meropenems) ESBL producing organisms are associated with gram negative bacterias and most of these organisms are in the family. Enterobacteriaeae and has been discovered in almost all members of the enterobacteriaceae family. The enterobacteriacea species most commonly associated with ESBL are klebsiella (Klebsiella pneumonia predominantly) and E. coli. Laboratory diagnosis of ESBLs Detection of bacterias expressing ESBL is difficult. Although a paicular ESBL will typically confer resistance to at least one paicular extended spectrum cephalosporin or aztreonam, the minimum inhibitory concentration may not be high enough for the strain to be called resistant under current interpretations of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. Because of the clinical significance of ESBL a specific guideline for the detection of ESBL expressing organisms were proposed in 1999 by NCCLS. The presence of an ESBL is suggested if:? - Bacterial growth is observed despite a concentration of I p g/ml of at least one of three extended spectrum cephalosporins (ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) or Aztreonam or growth occurs despite a concentration of 4 p g/ml of cefpodoxime. Classification of fl lactamase The number of 13 lactamase enzyme is continuously increasing at an alarming rate. Various classifications have been proposed. for lactamases. The earliest classification by sawai was based on Antisera. /3 lactamases have also been classified based on substrate profile, \"correlation of substrate and inhibitory propeies\". A modern system of classification ambler is based on the \"molecular\" structure. Recently a new classification system has been developed by Bush Jacoby medeiors to integrate functional and molecular characteristics. This scheme puts 178 fi lactamases from naturally occurring bacterial isolates into four groups bused on substrate and inhibitor profiles. Treatment of ESBL'S Of all the available fl lactams carbepenents are the most effective and reliable as they are highly resistant to the hydrolytic activity of the iglactamase. - None of the ESBLS described till todate are able to hydrolyze cephamycin or Carbepenem (imipenem. nteropetzem) Meropenem is the most active with MIC generally lower than those of imipenem. Beta lactamase inhibitors (Clavulanic acid, sulbactam. Tazobactam) Although ESBL activity is inhibited by clavulanic acid the only infections that may be treated safely with fi lactam /Q lactamase inhibitor combinations are those involving the urinary tract. - In this instance p lactamase inhibitor concentration is high enough to counteract the hydrolytic activity of ESBL's clavulinic acid appears more efficient than sulbactam (It takes about eight times more sulbactam to obtain a protection similar to that given by clavulinic acid). Non plactam antibiotics Non, B lactam antimicrobial agents (aininoglycosides, fluoro- quinolones) may be beneficial however, coresistance rates against these agents are frequent.",

        "question": "All of the following are inotropic agents except: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Amiodarone Effects of amiodarone includes depression of automaticity of sinus, atria and AV node; prolongation of ERP (effective refractory period) of myocardial cells, AV nodes and abnormal pathway; slowing the conduction in AV node and specialized conducting tissue. Amiodarone It is an antiarrhythmic agent used for various types of tachyarrhythmias (fast forms of irregular heart beat), both ventricular and supraventricular (atrial) arrhythmias. Amiodarone is categorized as a class III antiarrhythmic agent, and prolongs phase 3 of the cardiac action potential. It has numerous other effects however, including actions that are similar to those of antiarrhythmic classes Ia, II, and IV. Amiodarone shows beta blocker-like and potassium channel blocker-like actions on the SA and AV nodes, increases the refractory period sodium- and potassium-channel effects, and slows intra-cardiac conduction of the cardiac action potential, sodium-channel effects. Amiodarone resembles thyroid hormone, and its binding to the nuclear thyroid receptor might contribute to some of its pharmacologic and toxic actions. * Because amiodarone has a low incidence of pro-arrhythmic effects, it has been used both in the treatment of acute life-threatening arrhythmias as well as the chronic suppression of arrhythmias. It is useful both in supraventricular arrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias. Individuals who are pregnant or may become pregnant are strongly advised to not take amiodarone. Since amiodarone can be expressed in breast milk, women taking amiodarone are advised to stop nursing. It is contraindicated in individuals with sinus nodal bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and second or third degree heart block who do not have an aificial pacemaker. Individuals with baseline depressed lung function should be monitored closely if amiodarone therapy is to be initiated. The injection should not be given to neonates, because the benzyl alcohol it contains may cause the fatal \"gasping syndrome\". Amiodarone can worsen the cardiac arrhythmia brought on by Digitalis toxicity. Not to be given with Lidocaine increases risk of asystole Amiodarone is extensively metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 3. A4, and can affect the metabolism of numerous other drugs. It interacts with digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin and others. The major metabolite of amiodarone is desethylamiodarone (DEA), which also has antiarrhythmic propeies. The metabolism of amiodarone is inhibited by grapefruit juice, leading to elevated serum levels of amiodarone. Doses of digoxin should be halved in individuals taking amiodarone. Amiodarone potentiates the action of warfarin. Individuals taking both of these medications should have their warfarin dose halved and their anticoagulation status (measured as prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR)) measured more frequently. Amiodarone inhibits the action of the cytochrome P450 isozyme family. This reduces the clearance of many drugs, including the following:? - Cyclosporine - Digoxin - Flecainide - Procainamide - Quinidine - Sildenafil - Simvastatin - Theophylline - Warfarin Excretion is primarily hepatic and biliary with almost no elimination the renal route and it is not dialyzable. Elimination half-life average of 58 days (ranging from 25-100 days There is 10-50% transfer of amiodarone and DEA in the placenta as well as presence in breast milk. Accumulation of amiodarone and DEA occurs in adipose tissue and highly perfused organs (i. e. liver, lungs), therefore, if an individual was taking amiodarone on a chronic basis, if it is stopped it will remain in the system for weeks to months. The most serious reaction that is due to amiodarone is interstitial lung disease. Both under- and overactivity of the thyroid may occur on amiodarone treatment. Corneal micro-deposits (Corneal veicillata, also called voex keratopathy) are almost universally present (over 90%) in individuals taking amiodarone for at least 6 months. These deposits typically do not cause any symptoms. Abnormal liver enzyme results are common in patients on amiodarone. Much rarer are jaundice, hepatomegaly, and hepatitis Low-dose amiodarone has been repoed to cause pseudo-alcoholic cirrhosis. Long-term administration of amiodarone is associated with a blue-grey discoloration of the skin. Individuals taking amiodarone may become more sensitive to the harmful effects of UV-A light. Long-term administration of amiodarone has been associated with peripheral neuropathies. Amiodarone is sometimes responsible for epididymitis, a condition of the scrotum normally associated with bacterial infections but which can also occur as a non-bacterial inflammatory condition. It tends to resolve if amiodarone is stopped. Some cases of gynecomastia have been repoed with men on amiodarone",

        "question": "Regarding ACE inhibitor which of the following is truea. EUR'",
        "exp": "Omission of prior diuretic dose decreases the risk of postural hypotension Angiotensin conveing enzyme inhibitors Renin is an enzyme produced by the kidney in response to sodium depletion and increased adrenergic activity. Renin conves a circulating glycoprotein (angiotensinogen) into the biologically ine angiotensin I, which is then conveed by angiotensin conveing enzyme (ACE or kininase II) into the highly potent vasoconstrictor Angiotensin II. Angiotensin conveing enzyme or (ACE) is located on the luminal surface of capillary endothelial cells, paicularly in the lungs. Angiotensin II exes its effect by acting on two receptors i. e. ATi and AT2. Main actions of Angiotensin II a). Vasoconstriction Angiotensin II is the most potent vasoconstrictor in the body. It increases total peripheral resistance by constricting precapillary aerioles and to a lesser extent postcapillary venules by activating ATi receptors. Angiotensin II also produces peripheral vasoconstriction by enhancement of peripheral noradrenergic neurotransmission. b) Release of Aldosterone from adrenal coex Angiotensin II stimulates the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal coex to increase the synthesis and secretion of aldosterone. c) Altered renal hemodynamics Angiotensin II variably influences glomerular filtration rate several mechanisms - i) Constriction of the afferent aerioles which reduces intraglomerular pressure and tends to reduce GFR. ii) Contraction of measangial cells which decreases the capillary surface area which reduces GFR. iii) Constriction of efferent aerioles which increases intraglomerular pressure and tends to increase GFR. - The outcome of these opposing effects on GFR depends upon the physiological state:- Normally G. F. R is slighthy reduced by angiotensin II. d) Effect of Angiotensin II on cardiac structure:- i) Increased wall to lumen ratio in blood vessels ii) Concentric cardiac hyperophy iii) Eccentric cardiac hyperophy iv) Thickening of intimal surface of blood vessels ACE inhibitors ACE inhibitors are drugs which exe their action by inhibiting the conversion of Angiotensin Ito Angiotensin R. They inhibit the angiotensin conveing enzyme. Example of ACE inhibitors:? Captopril Enalapril Lisinopril Ramipril Trandolapril Perindropil Therapeutic uses of ACE inhibitors:? ACE inhibitors in hypertension Inhibition of ACE lowers systemic vascular resistance. ACE inhibitors lower mean, diastolic and systolic blood pressure in various hypeensive states. The initial change in blood pressure is directly related to plasma renin activity. Elevated plasma renin activity renders patients hyperre. sponsive to ACE inhibitor induced hypotension and initial dosages of all ACE inhibitors should he reduced in patients with high plasma level of renin (e. g. patients with heart failure and salt depleted patients). ACE inhibitors in left ventricular systolic dysfunction ACE inhibitors should be given to all patients with impaired left ventricular systolic. function. Although the mechanism by which ACE inhibitors improve outcome in patients with systolic dysfunction are not completely understood, the induction of a more ourable hemodynamic state most likely plays an impoant role. Inhibition of ACE commonly reduces afterload and systolic wall stress, and both cardiac output and cardiac index increases as do indices of stroke work and stroke volume. There is over whelming evidence that ACE inhibitors should be used in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with a depressed Ejection fraction (< 40%). Although the role of ACE inhibitors in left ventricular systolic dysfunction is firmly established whether these drugs improve diastolic dysfunction is an impoant open question. Infusion of enalaprilat into the left coronary aeries of patients with left ventricular hyperophy significantly improves diastolic function. Remember, This impoant point about the use of ACE in heart failure. Severe hypotension may result in patient taking diuretics or who are hypovolemic, hyponatremic, elderly, have renal impainnent or with systolic blood pressure < 100 min. Hg. A test dose of captopril 6. 25 mg by mouth may be given because its effect lasts only 4-61t. If tolerated, the preferred long acting ACE inhibitor may then be initiated in low dose. ACE inhibitors in myocardial infarction Several large prospective, randomized clinical studies involving thousands of patients provide convincing evidence that ACE inhibitors reduce overall moality when treatment is begun during peri-infarction period. ACE inhibitors in chronic renal failure Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of renal disease. In patients with type I diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy captopril prevents or delays the progression of renal disease. Specific renoprotection by ACE inhibitors is more di'. ficult to demonstrate in type 2 diabetics. Several mechanisms paicipate in renal protection afforded by ACE inhibitors. Increased glomerular capillary pressure induces glomerular injury and ACE inhibitors reduce this parameter both by decreasing aerial blood pressure and by dilating renal efferent aerioles. Adverse effect of ACE inhibitors Hypotension A steep fall in blood pressure may occur following the first dose of an ACE inhibitor in patients with elevated PRA (plasma renin activity). In this regard, care should he exercised in patients who are - Salt depleted - In patients being treated with multiple antihypeensive drugs, - In patients who have congestive heart. failure - In patients who are on diuretics. The doses of ACE inhibitors should be initiated in low doses followed by gradual increment if the lower doses have been well tolerated. Pharmacokinetics All ACE inhibitors except captopril and lisinopril are prodrugs and are conveed to the active agents by hydrolysis primarily in the liver. Enalapril is an oral prodrug that is conveed by hydrolysis in liver to an active form Enalaprilat. Enalaprilat itself is available only for intravenous use primarily for hypeensive emergencies. Enalapril has a half life of only 1. 3 hours but enalaprilat because of tight binding to ACE has a plasma half life of about 11 hours. Lisinopril is the lysine analogue of enalapril. Unlike enalapril, Lisinopril itself is active and its half life in plasma is about 12 hours. All ACE inhibitors are cleared as the intact compound by the kidney (except fosinopril and moexipril).",

Erection requires increased blood flow into the erectile tissues of the penis i. e. corpora cavernosa and corpora spongiosa. The erectile tissue are large cavernous sinusoids which are normally relatively empty of blood but becomes dilated tremendously when aerial blood flows rapidly into them under pressure while the venous outflow is paially occluded. Erection is caused by parasympathetic impulses that pass from sacral poion of spinal cord. These parasympathetic nerve fibres in contrast to most other parasympathetic fibres are believed to secrete nitric oxide and/or vasoactive intestinal peptide in addition to acetylcholine. The nitric oxide especially relaxes the aeries of the penis as well as relaxes the trabecular meshwork of smooth muscle fibres in the erectile tissue of the corpora cavernosa and corpora spongiosum. 13 blockers inhibit this vasodilation and cause erectile dysfunction. Medicated induced erectile dysfunction is estimated to occur in 25% of men. Among the antihypeensive agents the thiazide diuretics and fiblockers have been implicated most frequently. Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin conveing enzyme inhibitors are less frequently cited. Drugs associated with erectile dysfunction: Diuretics Tranquilizers Thiazide * Butyrophenones Spironolactone * Phenothiazines Antihypeensives H2 antagonists Calcium channel blockers * Ranitidine Methyldopa * Cimetidine Clonidine Hormones Reserpine * Progesterone 13 blockers * Estrogens Guanethidine * Coicosterolds Cardiac/antihyperlipidemics * Gn.

According to international journal of pediatrics otorhinolaryttgology \"Despite extensive precautions for its use, isotretinoin remains a cause of major bih defects including sensorieneural, conductive or mixed hearing loss\". Isotretinoin is one of the most potent teratogene in common use. Abnormalities commonly occur after 1st trimester. Any organ system can be affected by isotretinoin exposure but malformations typically involve the cranium, face, heart, central nervous system and thymus. Facial defects include cleft palate and maldevelopment of the facial bones and cranium. Cardiac anomalies include conotruncal or outflow tract defects. Hydrocephalus is the most common central nervous defect. Thymic abnormalities include aplasia, hypoplasia or malposition.

Patients with pyridoxine deficiency may experience neurologic symptoms, such as convulsions and fasciculations. The treatment of this disorder is slow IV administration of 2-5 g of pyridoxine. Niacin deficiency, also known as pellagra, is a disease that involves several organs, including the skin, the gastrointestinal system, and the nervous system. A useful mnemonic for remembering the symptoms of pellagra is the \"4 D's\": dermatitis, dementia, diarrhea, and death. These symptoms are not consistent with the patient history described in the question. Riboflavin deficiency is not typically seen alone, but rather in conjunction with other vitamin deficiencies. Dermatitis and glossitis are the most frequent clinical manifestations. Thiamine deficiency, or beri-beri, presents with dry skin and paralysis, rather than convulsions. Severe thiamine deficiency produces Wernicke's encephalopathy, with disorientation, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. This deficiency is typically seen in alcoholic patients. Ref: Amato A. A., Barohn R.

Urine Through the kidney It is the most impoant channel of excretion for most drugs. Net renal excretion = (Glomerular filtration + tubular secretion) - Tubular reabsorption. Glomerular filtration Depends on plasma protein binding and renal blood flow. Does not depend on lipid solubility. Tubular reabsorption Depends on lipid solubility More lipid soluble drugs are absorbed more and less excreted. Ionized drugs, being less lipid soluble, are more excreted. Acidic drugs (salicylates, barbiturates) are more ionized at alkaline pH. So urine should be alkalinized in poisoning of these drugs. Similarly, urine should be acidified in poisoning of basic drugs (morphine). Tubular secretion Does not depend on plasma protein binding or lipid solubility. This is active transpo of organic acid and bases by two separate classes of relatively nonspecific transpoers (OAT and OCT). In addition, efflux transpoers P-gp and MRP2 are located in the luminal membrane of proximal tubular cells. Organic acid transpo (through OAT) for Penicillin, Probenecid, uric acid, salicylates and sulfinpyrazone. Organic base transpo (through OCT) for diuretics (thiazide, amiloride, furosamide, triameterene), quinine and procainamide. Both transpo processes are bidirectional, for drugs, secretion into the tubular lumen predominates, whereas an endogenous substrate like uric acid is predominantly reabsorbed. 2. Faeces Drugs present in the faeces are derived from unabsorbed fraction plus actively secreted into bile. Drugs that attain high concentration in bile are - Erythromycin ral contraceptives Rifampin Ampicillin Tetracycline Phenolphthalein 4. Exhaled air Gases and volatile liquids are eliminated by lungs. 4. Saliva and sweat These are of minor impoance. Lithium, Pot. iodide and rifampin are present in these secretions. 5.

These are of two types:- (i) Primary resistance When there is absence of response to drug on first exposure e. g. Malignant melanoma, Renal cell cancer and brain cancer. The presence of inherent drug resistance is thought to be associated with genomic instability that gave rise io the cancer. (ii) Acquired resistance In these cases the cancers were initially drug sensitive and became drug resistant, later on in the course of therapy. It can be:- Single drug resistance Cancer is resistant to a single drug and is based on change in genetic apparatus of a given tumour cell. Multi drug resistance Resistance develops to a variety of anticancer drugs. It is associated with increased expression of a normal gene --)MDR1 gene. MDRI gene encodes for P-glycoprotein Pcgp). P glycoprotein is a protective mechanism possessed by normal cells. Pgp is an ATP dependent membrane efflux pump. Its function is to expel a variety of foreign molecules including antitumour drugs from the cell. Long lived cells such as the haemopoietic stern cells, cells on excretory surfaces such as biliarr hepatocytes, proximal renal tubules and intestinal cells and the cells of the blood- brain barrier, all have high expression of Pgp. The MDR phenomenon illustrates how tumour cells adapt and enhance normal cell mechanism to deal with the effects of chemotherapy and how repeated cycles of chemotherapy select out a population of cells which have developed adaptive survival mechanism e. g. in myeloma where MDR proteins are rare at diagnosis but common at progression.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., DCT Tubular absorption can be divided into four sites. Site 1- Proximal tubule Four mechanisms of Na' transpo have been defined in this segment? Direct entry of M.+ along electrochemical gradient. Nat-K* sympo along with active reabsorption of glucose, aminoacids, organic anions and PO43. Exchange with W by Na* IW exchanger located in the luminal membrane of proximal tubule (PT) epithelial cells. The PT cells secrete W with the help of carbonic anhydrase. W ion exchanges with Nat- present in tubular fluid through Na+-H+ exchanger (antipoer) and forms H2. CO3 by combining with HCO3-. This H2. CO3 is broken into H20 + CO2 by brush border carbonic anhydrase; both CO2 and H20 diffuse inside the cell and recombine to form H2. CO3 with the help of intracellular carbonic anhydrase. This H, CO3 is the source of F1*. The dissociated HCO3- in the cell is transpoed to coical E. C. F. by basolateral membrane Na-F-HCO3- sympoer resulting in net reabsorption of Na. HCO3. Carbonic anydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide) act predominantly in PCT and inhibit Na. HCO3 reabsorption. The disropoionately large HCO3-, acetate, PO4-3, passive driving forces for Cl- to diffuse through the paracellular pathway, paicularly in the later PT. This takes Na' and H, 0 along to maintain electrical neutrality and isotonicity; reabsorption in PT is isotonic. Osmotic diuretics (mannitol) are solutes which are not absorbed in proximal tubule and therefore retain water. Site II Ascending limb of loop of Henle The thick ascending limb can be distinguished into two distinct poion. Medullary poion lined by cuboidal cells. Coical poion lined by flattened cells. Both poions are relatively impermeable to water but absorb salt actively and thus dilute tubular fluid. In the medullary poion a distinct luminal membrane carrier transpos ions in ratio of Nee-K+-2a. The sodium enters the cell is pumped to ECF by Na ATPase at the basolateral membrane. This Na+--K+--2. C1: sympo is inhibited by loop diuretics (eg-Furosemide). In addition, a Na*-C1- sympoer moves CI- down its electrochemical gradient into ECF and carries Na+ along. Site III - coical diluting segment of loop of Henle and early DT This segment is also impermeable to H20 and continues to absorb salt through Nat-Ct sympoer. Thiazide diuretics act at this site. Site IV - late distal tubule and collecting duct In late DT and CD, Na is actively reabsorbed; the cation-anion balance being maintained paly by passive CI-diffusion and paly by secretion of K+ and Fr. Absorption of Na+ at this site occurs through a specific amiloride sensitive Net' channel and is controlled to a large extent by aldosterone. K paring diuretics act at this site. Collecting tubule is the most impoant site of IC secretion by the kidney and the site at which viually all diuretic induced changes in KE balance occur - as IC secretion occurs in exchange of Nat, higher the Na+ load in CD higher will be K+ excretion in urine --> Diuretics which act on PCT (maximum absoion of Na+ occurs at PCT) like acetazolamide will cause maximum kaliuresis (IC excretion in urine). The principal cells are the major sites of Nat, IC-, and water transpo, and intercalated cells are the primary sites of Ft' secretion. The collecting tubule is also the site at which the final urine concentration is determined. ADH (vasopressin) controls the permeability of this segment to water by regulating the inseion of preformed water channels (aquaporin2, AQP2) into the apical membrane a G protein - coupled c. AMP - mediated process. ADH also stimulates the inseion of urea transpoer UT1 molecules into the apical membranes of medullary collecting tubule cells. Urea concentration in the medulla plays an impoant role maintaining the high osmolarity of the medulla and in the concentration of urine.",

        "exp": "Severe hyperkalemia requires emergent treatment directed at minimizing membrane depolarization, shifting K+ into cells, and promoting K+ loss. Administration of calcium gluconate decreases membrane excitability. The effect begins within minutes but is short-lived (30-60 min), and the dose can be repeated if no change in the electrocardiogram is seen after 5-10 min. Insulin causes IC to shift into cells and will temporarily lower the plasma IC concentration. Although glucose alone will stimulate insulin release from normal pancreatic beta cells, a more rapid response generally occurs when exogenous insulin is administered (with glucose to prevent hypoglycemia). The plasma K+ concentration will fall by 0. 5-1. 5 mmol/L in 15-30 min, and the effect will last for several hours. Alkali therapy with intravenous Na. HCO3 can also shift K+ into cells. This should be reserved for severe hyperkalemia associated with metabolic acidosis. Patients with end-stage renal disease seldom respond to this intervention and may not tolerate the Na+ load and resultant volume expansion. When administered parenterally or in nebulized form, beta 2-adrenergic agonists promote cellular uptake of K+ The onset of action is 30 min and the effect lasts 2-4 h.
