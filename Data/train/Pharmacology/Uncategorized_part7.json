The classic example of this mechanism is the quinidine group of drugs. The Fc poion of the antibody molecule is not involved in the binding process. - Drug binds to Fc, and drug-antibody complex binds and activates platelets. Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the classic example of this phenomenon. In HIT, the heparin-antibody-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex binds to Fc receptors on the surface of the platelet. Since Fc poion of the antibody is bound to the platelets, they are not available to the Fc receptors of the reticulo-endothelial cells, so therefore this system cannot destroy platelets as usual. This may explain why severe thrombocytopenia is not a common feature of HIT. -- Abciximab induced thrombocytopenia.

Currently, its main uses are in bone marrow transplantation, especially in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), where it is used as a conditioning drug. Its mechanism of action through alkylation produces guanine-adenine intrastrand crosslinks.

C: Cyclophosphamide The oxazaphosphorine-alkylating agents cyclophosphamide is chemotherapeutic drug that is useful in the treatment of lymphoma, leukemia, and ceain solid tumors. It is inactive as such: prodeuces few acute effects and is not locally damaging. Transfromation into active metabolites (aldophosphamide, phosphoramide mustard) occurs in the liver. It is less damaging to the platelets, but alopecia and cystitis (due to another metabolite acrolein) are prominent. Congener of cyclophosphamide is Ifosfamide, whose dose limiting toxicity is hemorrhagic cystitis. To prevent it, mesna is routinely given with it. In rare cases, penicillins have been repoed to cause hemorrhagic cystitis in ceain patients. Case repos have implicated methicillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, and penicillin VK. Treatment with danazol, a semisynthetic anabolic steroid, has caused hemorrhagic cystitis in patients with hereditary angioedema. Other medications that have been implicated in the development of hemorrhagic cystitis in limited repos include temozolomide, bleomycin, tiaprofenic acid, allopurinol, methaqualone, methenamine mandelate, gentian violate, nonoxynol-9 suppositories inadveently placed in the urethra, and intravesical acetic acid.

        "exp": "Change cerftriaxone to Imipenem Penicillins were the earliest antibiotics to be developed. Penicillins and their related group of antibiotics were called fl lactam antibiotics because they contained a four carbon ring called fi lactam ring. Within a. few years of introduction of penicillin, bacterias staed acquiring resistance against penicillins by producing penicillinase To overcome this problem penicillinase resistant penicillins came into picture. Sholy afterwards, the broad spectrum penicillin and first gene- ration cephalosporins were introduced. They remained, first line antibiotics. for several years. Over a period of tune bacterias developed resistance even against these organisms by producing filactamase. fi lactamase are enzymes that break open the fi lactam ring and deactivate the antibiotic. The, B lactamases hydrolyze penicillins and narrow spectrum cephalo- sporin, such as cephalothin or cefazolin, and are resistant to them. To counteract the problems against fl lactamases new classes of /I lactams were developed. These are cephalosporins containing oxy- minio side chain e. g. ceftizoxime, cefotaxine, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone (broad spectrums cephalosporins). - Consequently, when these oxymino side chain containing com- pounds were introduced they were effective against a broad group of otherwise resistant bacterias. - f3luctamases cannot hydrolyze higher generation cephalosporins with an oxymino side chain (cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime). But not long ago after these cephalosporins came into use strains of klebsiella pneumonia were discovered which were resistant even to oxyimino containing cephalosporins e. g. (cefotaxime, cefazidime, ceftriaxone) The mechanism of this resistance was production of extended spectrum /3 lactanzase enzyme (ESBL). These bacterias are called ESBL bacterias -Bacterias are classified as extended spectrum fl lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria, when a simple point mutation occurs in genes normally responsible. for beta lactamase mediated resistance. The mutation usually responsible is (TEM). - As a result of the mutation, organisms, are able to produce novel beta lactamases that can hydrolyze all the fi lactam containing antibiotics which includes even the ox-pninio group containing cephalosporins (ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone), Aztreonam and all the older fi lactam drugs. Because of their greatly extended substrate range these enzymes were called extended spectrum 13 lactamase ESBLS are capable of efficiently hydrolyzing:- -Folic illins - Narrow spectrum cephalosporins - Many extended spectrum cephalosporins - Oxyimino group containing cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime) - Monobactams (aztreonams) - Beta lactatnase inhibitors (clavulinic acid sulbactam) An impoant point None of the ESBLS described till to date are able to hydrolyze cephamycin or carbepenems (imipenenz, meropenems) ESBL producing organisms are associated with gram negative bacterias and most of these organisms are in the family. Enterobacteriaeae and has been discovered in almost all members of the enterobacteriaceae family. The enterobacteriacea species most commonly associated with ESBL are klebsiella (Klebsiella pneumonia predominantly) and E. coli. Treatment of ESBL'S Of all the available fllactams \"carbepenenzs\" are the most effective and reliable as they are highly resistant to the hydrolytic activity of the fl lactamase. - None of the ESBLS described till todate are able to hydrolyze cephamycin or Carbepenem (imipenem, meropenem) Meropenem is the most active with MIC generally lower than those of imipenem. Beta lactamase inhibitors (Clavulanic acid, sulbactam, Tazobactam) Although ESBL activity is inhibited by clavulinic acid the only infections that may be treated safely with b lactam / f3lactamase inhibitor combinations are those involving the urinary tract. - In this instance i3lactamase inhibitor concentration is high et, ough to counteract the hydrolytic activity of ESBI:. s clavulinic acid appears more efficient than sulbactam (It takes about eight times more sulbactam to obtain a protection similar to that given by clavulinic acid). Non 13 lactam antibiotics Non fi lactam antimicrobial agents (amino glycosides, fluoro- quinolones) may be beneficial however, coresistance rates against these agents are frequent.",

In comparison with entacapone, another nitrocatechol COMT inhibitor, tolcapone has a longer half life (2. 9 hours vs. 0. 8 hours) and can better penetrate the blood-brain barrier, acting both in the central nervous system and in the periphery. However, entacapone is less toxic for the liver. Tolcapone improves the bioavailability and reduces the clearance of levodopa and subsequently dopamine from the CNS.

Then only 100 out of 1000 molecules of the enzyme are required to metabolize the drug and they metabolize the 50% of drug in 5 hours (t% 5 hours). Now, we give double dose of drug, 200 out of 1000 molecules will be required and they will metabolize the 50% of drug in same t1/2 (as all enzyme molecules have same metabolizing propeies). That means at lower Concentrations:-0 P/2 remains constant ii) Rate of elimination is propoional to plasma concentration (In this example), when the concentration was 100 molecules, 50 molecules (50% of 100 molecules) were metabolized in one 0/2; and when the concentration was 200 molecules, 100 molecules (50% of 200 molecules) were metabolized in one t1/2 --> Constant fraction of drug is eliminated per unit time. iii) Clearance remains constant becuase, as the plasma concentration increases, rate of elimination increases propoionaly. iv) This is first order kinetic So drug will follow first order kinetic up to the dose of 1000 molecules. However, if we give sufficiently high dose, e. g., 1500 molecules, 1500 molecules of enzyme will be required to metabolize the drug. But we have only 1000 molecules of enzyme. Therefore all enzyme molecules will act only on 1000 molecules of drugs and remaining 500 will he metabolize latter when the enzyme molecules become free from the already existing metabolic reaction (metabolism of first 1000 molecules of drug). Therefore, at higher concentration. -0 t% increases with increasing concentration as the enzyme molecules can metabolize 1000 molecules of drug and above this concentration t1/2 will increase with increasing concentration. ii) Constant amount of drug is eliminated per unit time (In this example 1000 molecules). iii) Clearance is more at lower concentration and less at higher concentration (CL = rate of elimination/ Plasma conc.). In sho o At lower concentration ofdrug, elimination pathways (metabolism or excretion) are present in sufficient amount and are not a limiting factor for elimination Drug metabolism follows first order kinetics. o At higher concentration of drug, elimination pathways become saturated and are a limiting factor for drug elimination --) Drug metabolism follows zero order kinetics. So, the drug whose elimination pathway become saturated at higher concentration follows zero order kinetics at higher concentration. Examples are Aspirin, Alcohol, Warfarin, Theophylline, Tolbutamide. o It should be kept in the mind that non-linear kinetics (zero-order) is not: only due to saturation of metabolism, it may also occur due to saturation of other elimination pathway e. g. Renal excretion, Biliary secretion. Process saturated Drugs o Metabolism Phenytoin, alcohol, theophylline, warfarine, aspirin, toibutamide o Renal excretion Naproxen, mezlocillin o Biliary secretion Cimitidine, Isotretinoin, BSA o Absorption Riboflavin, Peniefilins",

Anti TNF a the therapy in Hepatitis B For the treatment of HBV, Anti TNF- atherapy showed cases of fulminant HBV reactivation. But any HBV reactivation was treated success fully with lamivudine therapy, thus it was concluded that physicians should consider antiviral therapy in patients with HBV (with or without active viral replication) and initiated treatment should continue for 3-6 months after stopping anti TNF- therapy. Both published British society of Rheumatology guidelines and British society of Gastroenterology guidelines concludes:- Successful treatment of active RA with anti TNF a in patients chronically infected with HBV is possible and can be safe. Our findings together with those of others, suggest that chronic HBV infection need not preclude therapy with anti TNF a where clinically indicated but an individualized approach is required including careful counseling, collaboration with colleagues in gastroenterology and intensive monitoring. HIV and anti TNF- a therapy As of now there are only eight patients treated with HIV and Rheumatoid disease. Retrospective series of eight patients suggests that treatment with anti TNF- a therapy can be used in HIV patients without advanced disease with associated rheumatic diseases. HCV and anti TNF-- cc therapy Anti TNF- a therapy is safe in patients with HCV and Rheumatoid ahritis. In a study involving 31 patients with RA with concomitant HCV infection, TNF a blocker seemed to be safe provided there is close monitoring of clinical virological data.

More severe side effects include anemia and neutropenia. Myopathy, lactic acidosis, hepatomegaly, convulsions and encephalopathy are infrequent. AZT has been shown to work additively or synergistically with many anti-HIV agents; however, acyclovir and ribavirin decrease the antiviral effect of AZT. Drugs that inhibit hepatic glucuronidation, such as indomethacin, acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) and trimethoprim, decrease the elimination rate and increase the toxicity.

Carisoprodol is metabolized into meprobamate. Enalapril is conveed by esterase to the active enalaprilat. Acyclovir is conveed into the active acyclovir triphosphate. Fosamprenavir is hydrolysed to the active amprenavir. Levodopa is conveed by DOPA decarboxylase to the active dopamine. Chloramphenicol succinate ester is used as an intravenous prodrug of chloramphenicol, because pure chloramphenicol does not dissolve in water. Psilocybin is dephosphorylated to the active psilocin. Heroin is deacetylated by esterase to the active morphine. Codeine is demethylated by the liver enzyme CYP2. D6 to the active morphine, as well as several other compounds that may be active in analgesia. Molsidomine is metabolized into SIN-1 which decomposes into the active compound nitric oxide. Paliperidone is an atypical antipsychotic for schizophrenia. It is the active metabolite of risperidone. Prednisone, a synthetic coico-steroid drug, is conveed by the liver into the active drug prednisolone, which is also a steroid. Primid one is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes into phenobarbital, which is major and phenylethylmalonamide, which is minor. Dipivefrine, given topically as an anti-glaucoma drug, is conveed to epinephrine. Lisdexamfetamine is metabolized in the small intestine to produce dextroamphetamine at a controlled (slow) rate for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Diethylpropion is a diet pill that does not become active as a monoamine releaser or reuptake inhibitor until it has been N-dealkylated to ethylpropion. Fesoterodine is an antimuscarinic that is conveed to tolterodine. Alpha-methyldopa is conveed into alpha-methylnorepinephrine. Sulindac is conveed into sulfide metabolite. Proguanil is conveed into cycloguanil.",

The precise mechanism by which opioids can cause muscular rigidity is not clearly understood. Muscle rigidity is not due to direct action on muscle fibres because it can be decreased or prevented by pretreatment with muscle relaxants. In addition, opioid induced muscle rigidity is not associated with increase in creatinine kinase a. finding suggesting that little or no muscle damage occurs during this period. - Opioids do not have any significant effect on neuromuscular conduction and result in only minimal depression of monosynaptic reflexes associated with muscle stretch receptors. - Some investigators have suggested that opioids produce rigidity by altering dopamine concentrations within the striatum. s of the brain. Rigidity may occur due to the result of stimulation of GABA ergic interneurons which can be blocked by lesion in the striatum. Continuous research and data seems to indicate that the main mechanism responsible for opioid induced muscle rigidity is stimulation of it receptors. - Opioids appear to produce their physiological effects by. binding to at least three types of opioid receptors the mu (p), delta (8) and Kappa (x) receptors. - Muscle rigidity occurs after administration of supra analgesic doses of potent p preferring opioids. - The present data demonstrates that whereas systemic opiate induced muscle rigidity is primarily due to the activation of central mu receptors, supraspinal delta and kapp receptors may attenuate this effect. Anaesthesia review by Michelle Bowman Howard states (p134) -All opioids given in high doses may cause muscular rigidity. It is most likely related to I. i receptors in the caudate nucleus.

By binding to fibrillar protein tubulin, it inhibits granulocyte migration into the inflamed joints. Other actions (not related to gout) Antimitotic Causes metaphase arrest by binding to microtubules of mitotic spindle. Increases gut motility through neural mechanisms. Toxicity Nausea, vomiting, watery or bloody diarrhea, and abdominal pain are the most common side effects. Accumulation of the drug in intestine and inhibition of mitosis in its rapid turnover mucosa is responsible for the toxicity. In overdose, colchicine produces kidney damage, CNS depression, intestinal bleeding; death is due to muscular paralysis and respiratory failue.

Muscle relaxation is produced by action on medulla. Ataxia is due to action on cerebellum. BZDs acts on GABAA receptors. GABA,,, receptor has 5 subunits a / p, p, a / y. GABA binding site is on p. subunit, while BZDs binding site is on a / y subunit. BZDs receptor increase the conductance of Cl- channel. BZDs do not themselves increase Cl- conductance, i. e. they have only GABA facilitatory but no GABA mimetic action. (Barbiturates have both GABA facilitatory and GABA mimetic actions). Effect on CNS In contrast to barbiturates, BZDs are not general depressant, but exe relatively selective anxiolytic, hypnotic, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant effects. The antianxiety action of BZDs is not dependent on their sedative propey --> with chronic administration relief of anxiety is maintained, but drowsiness wanes off due to development of tolerance. Stage 2 sleep is increased, while REM, Stage 3 & 4 sleep are decreased. Nitrazepam is the only benzodiazepine, which increases REM sleep. Clonazepan and diazepam have more marked muscle relaxant propey. Clonazepam, diazepam, nitrazepam and flurazepam have more prominent anticonvulsant activity than other BZDs. Diazepam (but not other BZDs) has analgesic action. Diazepam produces sho lasting coronary dilatation on i. v. injection. Diazepam decreases nocturnal gastric secretion and prevents stress ulcers.",

A full agonist is sufficiently selective for the active confirmation that at a saturating concentration it will drive the receptor essentially completely to active state -3 maximum activity can be produced by agonist. o Paial agonist has only moderately higher affinity for the active confirmation (Ra) than inactive confirmation (Ri). Its effect will be less, even at saturating concentrations, so paial agonist cannot produce a full biological response at any concentration --> paial agonist has submaximal intrinsic activity. o Antagonist has equal affinity for both active (Ra) and inactive (Ri) confirmation. So, antagonist will not alter the equilibrium between Ra & Ri, and will not produce an effect --> antagonist has no intrinsic activity. o Inverse agonist has greater affinity for inactive confirmation (Ri) and drives the equilibrium to the inactive state. So, inverse agonist has an effect opposite to that of an agonist --> inverse agonist has intrinsic activity with a minus sign that means opposite intrinsic activity. Examples of such inverse agonists at G-protein coupled receptors are Famotidine, losaan, metoprolol and risperidone. 1. Agonist has affinity for active configuration (Ra) 2. Paial agonist has affinity for bath active (Ra) as well as inactive (Ri) confirmation, but has more affinity for active configuration (Ra > Ri) 3.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Oral The first-pass effect/first-pass metabolism/presystemic metabolism is a phenomenon of drug metabolism whereby the concentration of a drug is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. It is the fraction of lost drug during the process of absorption which is generally related to the liver and gut wall. Notable drugs that experience a significant first-pass effect are Imipramine, Propranolol, and Lidocaine. After a drug is swallowed, it is absorbed by the digestive system and enters the hepatic poal system. It is carried through the poal vein into the liver before it reaches the rest of the body. The liver metabolizes many drugs, sometimes to such an extent that only a small amount of active drug emerges from the liver to the rest of the circulatory system. This first pass through the liver thus greatly reduces the bioavailability of the drug. Routes of administration like suppository/rectal, intravenous, intramuscular, inhalational aerosol and sublingual avoid the first-pass effect because they allow drugs to be absorbed directly into the systemic circulation. The four primary systems that affect the first pass effect of a drug are the enzymes of the gastrointestinal lumen, gut wall enzymes, bacterial enzymes, and hepatic enzymes.",

The ohostatic hypotension and syncope are associated with the body's poor ability to control blood pressure without active alpha-adrenergic receptors. Patients on prazosin should be told not to stand up too quickly, since their poor baroreflex may cause them to faint as all their blood rushes to their feet. The nasal congestion is due to dilation of vessels in the nasal mucosa. One phenomenon associated with prazosin is known as the \"first dose response\", in which the side effects of the drug, especially ohostatic hypotension and fainting, are especially pronounced after the first dose. Another common side effect of prazosin (and doxazosin) is priapism.",

There is also evidence that ACE inhibitors have a proteinuria-sparing effect in type I diabetics with normal B. P. o All patients with diabetic nephropathy, whether hypeensive or normotensive deserve ACE inhibitor therapy. o AT-II antagonists have better renoprotective effect in type 2 DM with nephropathy. IV) Myocardial infarction? o Following MI, the LVF may occur from the loss of functional tissue or from a process of remodelling of the scarred ventricular wall. o Angiotensin II plays a key role in both these processes. o ACE inhibitors given after M. I. markedly reduce the incidence of heart failure. V) Scleroderma crisis? o ACE inhibitors cause dramatic improvement in patients of scleroderma crisis with marked rise in B. P. and deterioration in renal function.

Therefore, this medication is likely to decrease the metabolism of other hepatically metabolized medications, such as phenobarbital.

Phenobarbital is a barbiturate indicated for the treatment of tonic-clonic seizures and status epilepticus.

The risks of bleeding is increased when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The risk may also be increased in elderly patients and in patients on hemodialysis. A rare but serious complication resulting from treatment with warfarin is warfarin necrosis, which occurs more frequently in patients with a deficiency of protein C, leading to massive thrombosis with skin necrosis and gangrene of limbs. Its natural counterpa, purpura fulminans, occurs in children who are homozygous for protein C mutations. Warfarin could reduce bone mineral density and there is a direct link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. Another rare complication that may occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks) is purple toe syndrome. It results from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and flowing into the blood vessels in the skin of the feet, which causes a blueish purple color and may be painful. It is typically affects the big toe. The effects of warfarin can be reversed with vitamin K, or, when rapid reversal is needed (such as in case of severe bleeding), with prothrombin complex concentrate--which contains only the factors inhibited by warfarin--or fresh frozen plasma in addition to intravenous vitamin K.",

He states that he just returned from a convention, and had noticed increasing pain in his right foot during his plane trip home. Physical examination is remarkable for swelling and erythema of the right great toe as well as small nodules on the patient's external ear. Aspiration of the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the affected toe demonstrates needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals. Which of the following agents would provide the most immediate relief for this patient?",
        "exp": "The patient has gout, which is due to precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in joint spaces (notably the great toe) and soft tissues (causing tophi, which are often found on the external ears). Colchicine reduces the inflammation caused by the urate crystals by inhibiting leukocyte migration and phagocytosis secondary to an effect on microtubule assembly. Allopurinol and its metabolite, oxypurinol, inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that forms uric acid from hypoxanthine. Therapy with this agent should be begun 1-2 weeks after the acute attack has subsided. Aspirin competes with uric acid for tubular secretion, thereby decreasing urinary urate excretion and raising serum uric acid levels. At high doses (more than 2 gm daily) aspirin is a uricosuric. Probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are uricosuric agents, increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid, hence decreasing serum levels of the substance. Therapy with these agents should be begun 1-2 weeks after the acute attack has subsided. Ref: Grosser T., Smyth E. (2011). Chapter 34.

        "exp": "To get to the answer, we will look at the options one by one. Hypocalcemia Serum calcium in this boy is 7. 5 mg/dL. Hypocalcemia can result in seizures but the level should be very low. Further, if we correct calcium with serum albumin, it will come in normal range. Corrected calcium level in the serum can be calculated by adding 0. 8 mg/dL With every 1. 0 g/dL decrease in serum albumin below the normal value of 4. 0 g/dL. Hence, in this patient, corrected serum calcium level will be 7. 5 + 0. 8 x (4. 0 - 1. 5) = 9. 5 mg/ dL It is in the normal range (8. 5-10. 5 mg/dL) and thus cannot be the cause of seizures in this person. Uremia Although blood urea is elevated (78 mg/dL as compared to normal value of 15-40 mg/dL) but serum creatinine is normal (0. 5 mg/dL). For diagnosis of uremia, serum creatinine must be 3 times the normal value. Thus, uremia cannot be the answer. Hyponatremia Serum sodium is at lower normal value (136-152 m. Eq/L). For causing seizures, serum sodium should be less than 125 m. Eq/L. Therefore, this option can also be ruled out. Tacrolimus toxicity This child is on tacrolimus therapy.

Overexpression HER-2/neu also predicts good response to herceptin but is not a good predictor of response to chemotherapy and overall survival.

HER-2/neu erh-B, stands for Human e i idermal * rowth factor rece i tor. It is a molecule present in small amounts on the surface of ceain types of cells such as breast cells and ovarian cells. HER-2 belongs to Erb protein family commonly known as epidermal growth factor receptor family (EGFR). - The epidermal growth factor receptor are present on the cell surface and are involved in the signal transduction pathways leading to cell growth and differentiation. Activation of epidermal growth receptor (EGFR) Ligand binds to the EGFR Dimerisation of EGFR Activation of EGFR vir Signal transduction to nucleus 'Jr Cell growth and differentiation Although HER-2 is highly hontologus to EGFR, it does not have any specific ligand for it. Therefore it is also called orphan receptor. - Instead of activation by direct ligand binding it exhibits \"constitutive activity\" in the absence of ligand. The constitutive activity of the HER-2 is increased by overexpression of HER-2. - The most common mechanism by which HER-2 gets activated and transforms cells is by overexpression of normal HER-2. This phenomenon is observed in breast cancers. There are ceain types of breast cancers that overexpress HER-2/neu receptors on their surfaces. - In 1 out of every 5 breast cancers the cancer cells make an excess of HER-2/neu. - HER-2 positive breast cancers tend to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer. - Overexpression of this receptor in breast cancer is associated with increased disease recurrence and worse prognosis. - They are also less responsive to hormone treatment However drugs that specifically target HER-2 are very effective. -Herceptin (Transtuzumb) is a drug that specifically targets HER-2 receptors and blocks their action. - Herceptin or transtuzumab is approved for HER-2/neu overexpressing breast cancer.

        "exp": "Ans. A: Propyl-thiouracil Thioamide drugs (methyl and propyl thiouracil, methimazole and carbimazole) can also be used during pregnancy (the lowest possible dose should be used) The foetal thyroid is extremely susceptible to radiation and may be quickly destroyed. Propylthiouracil/ PTU/ 6-n-Propylthiouracil It is a thioamide drug used to treat hypehyroidism (including Graves' disease) by decreasing the amount of thyroid hormone produced by the thyroid gland. Its notable side effects include a risk of agranulocytosis. PTU inhibits the enzyme thyroperoxidase, which normally acts in thyroid hormone synthesis by oxidizing the anion iodide (I-) to iodine (10), facilitating iodine's addition to tyrosine residues on the hormone precursor thyroglobulin. This is one of the essential steps in the formation of thyroxine (T4). PTU does not inhibit the action of the sodium-dependent iodide transpoer located on follicular cells' basolateral membranes. Inhibition of this step requires competitive inhibitors, such as perchlorate and thiocyanate. PTU also acts by inhibiting the enzyme 5'-deiodinase (tetraiodothyronine 5' deiodinase), which conves T4 to the active form T3. (This is in contrast to methimazole, which shares propylthiouracil's central mechanism, but not its peripheral one) Administration is oral, with peak serum concentrations occurring in one hour, and actively concentrated to the thyroid gland. The drug is approximately 70% protein-bound and significantly ionized at normal physiologic pH, while the antithyroid agent methimazole is substantially less protein bound. However both are equally transferred across the placenta. Less than 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged, with the remaining fraction undergoing extensive hepatic metabolism glucuronidation. One side effect is agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia A more life threatening side effect is sudden, severe, fulminant hepatic failure occurs in up to 1 in 10, 000 people taking propylthiouracil. PTU is preferred over methimazole only in the first trimester of pregnancy and in woman who may become pregnant. In the second and third trimester, methimazole is preferred.",

Diuretic induced volume depletion stimulates the formation of angiotensin II, which, in turn, causes a secondary increase in plasma aldosterone concentration. This increase in plasma aldosterone stimulates potassium excretion, contributing to the hypokalemia. The saline diuresis increased sodium delivery to the collecting tubule. The increased availability of sodium along with the elevated plasma aldosterone augments sodium reabsorption iin the collecting tubule, thereby raising luminal negativity. This high luminal negativity in the collecting tubule promotes secretion of cations, especially hydrogen ions, which raises bicarbonate reabsorption. The saline diuresis causes rapid fluid flow in the distal tubule, which, in turn, keeps luminal potassium concentration low by carrying it away and thus preventing the accumulation of any potassium that enters the lumen. This low luminal concentration of potassium creates a steep concentration gradient for additional potassium losses in the urine. The treatment of edema with thiazide or loop diuretics is the most common cause of metabolic alkalosis. Aerial pH is increased and aerial H+ concentration is decreased with metabolic alkalosis. Sodium depletion tends to decrease plasma sodium levels, although the effect is usually small. Overuse of the thiazide diuretic has caused depletion of sodium and potassium by the kidneys, not retention of sodium and potassium.",

This enhances influx of Ca+2 - degranulation. They do not cause hypoglycemia in pancreatectomized animals and type 1 diabetes (Presence of at least 30% of functional b-cells in essential for their action). A minor action reducing glucagon secretion by increasing insulin and somatostatin release has been demonstrated. Extrahepatic action On chronic administration they sensitize the target cells (especially the liver) to the action of insulin. On chronic administration their action on pancrease (to release insuline) declines due to down regulation of sulfonylurea receptors. But glycemic control is maintained due to extrahepatic action.",

Digitalis reduces the ventricular rate in AF by decreasing the number of impulses that are able to pass down the A-V node and bundle of His. It increases effective refractory period-ERP refractoriness) of A-V node by direct, vagomimetic and antiadrenergic action - the minimum interval between consecutive impulses that can successfully traverse the conducting tissue is increased. A degree of A-V block is naturally established in AF. Because of the relatively long ERP of A-V node, many atrial impulses impinge on it while it is still refractory; others falling early in the relative refractory period get extinguished by decremental conduction - These concealed impulses leave upper margin of A-V node refractory for a fuher period. Thus, any influence which increases atrial rate in AF (e. g. digitalis), by itself reduces ventricular rate.",

Second generation cephalosporins:? More active against gram negative organism, Also has some activity against gram positive organisms. Some members also have activity against anaerobes e. g., cefotetan, Cefnzetazole and cefoxitin. Among the second generation cephalosporins, cefuroxime attains higher C. S. F. concentration. Third generation cephalosporins: - Have highly augumented activity against gram negative enterobacteriacea. Less active against gram (+ve) cocci and anaerobes. Highly resistant to [3 lactamases from negative bacteria. Some third generation cephalosporins have antipseudomonal activity: - e. g., Ceftazidime and cefoperazone. Ceftazidime + aminoglycoside is the treatment of choice for pseudomonas infections. Fouh generation cephalosporins:? These drug possess activity against gram negative organisms (including pseudomonas) resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins. Their efficacy against gram positive cocci is similar to 3rd generation compounds but an impoant point to remember is that they are not active against anaerobes. General features of Cephalosporins:- (Some impoant points to remember) Cephalosporin like other lactam antibiotics exe their action by inhibiting cell wall synthesis. Cephalosporins are excreted primarily by the kidney therefore they require dose reduction in renal failure. Probenecid slows the tubular secretion of most of the cephalosporins. Cefpiranzide, ceftriaxone and cefperazone are exceptions because they are excreted predominantly in the bile. Cefotaxime is deacetylated in vivo. The metabolite has less antimicrobial activity than the parent compound and is excreted by the kidneys. None qf the other cephalosporins appears to undergo appreciable metabolism. Several cephalosporins penetrate into C. S. F. in sufficient concentrations to be useful for the treatment of meningitis. These include:? Cefotaxime Ceftriaxone Cefepime Cephalosporins also cross the placenta and they are found in high concentrations in synol and pericardial fluids. Penetration into the aqueous humour of the eye is relatively good after systemic administration of the third generation agents but penetration into the vitreous humour is poor. No cephalosporins is active against enterococcus fecalis, MRSA and listeria monocytogens. Concentrations in bile usually are high with those achieved after administration of cefoperazone and cefpiranzide being the highest. Adverse reactions Most common side effect of cephalosporin is hypersensitivity reaction. Immediate reactions such as anaphylaxis, bronchosposam and uicaria are observed. Cephalosporins have been implicated as potentially nephrotoxic agents (cephaloridine is considered the most nephrotoxic cephalosporin. It is no longer available in the united states). Cephalothin is another cephalosporin that produces renal toxicity, it causes acute tubular necrosis. Cephalosporins cause disulfiram like reaction (e. g., cefamandole, cefotetan, cefoperazone). These are caused by drugs which have rnethylthiotetrazole group. Cephalosporins have been associated with diarrhoea (is more frequent with cefoperazone because of its greater biliary excretion).",

        "exp": "Ans. A: Powerful anticoagulant only in vivo Heparin is a powerful and instantaneously acting anticoagulant, effective both in vivo and in vitro. At low concentrations of heparin, factor Xa mediated conversion of prothrombin to thrombin is selectively affected. The anticoagulant action is exeed mainly by inhibition of the factor Xa as well as thrombin (Ha) mediated conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Routes of Administration are l/ V infusion and S/C injection. Heparin should not be given by IM injection. Contraindications Thrombocytopenia When lab facilities for monitoring of TT/ APTT (Thrombin time/ activated paial thromboplastin time) are not available. Bleeding condition like active peptic ulcer, esophageal varices, piles etc, and blood dyscrasias. Uncontrolled hypertension, bacterial endocarditis. Recent surgery or trauma. Menstruation. Hypersensitivity to heparin. Intracranial haemorrhage. Proliferative retinopathy. Severe liver disease and renal failure. Aminoglycosides are incompatible with heparin and should not be given in the same cannula. Drug Interactions Potentially fatal: - Use with care in conjunction with oral anticoagulants and avoid concomitant use of drugs affecting platelet functions like aspirin, dipyridamole, phenylbutazone, indomethacin and other NSAIDs. Non-fatal: - Glycerl trinitrate reduces the activity of heparin by increasing its excretion. - Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine may decrease the effects of heparin. Adverse Effects Common effects: - Haemorrhage - can be minor (bleeding from venepuncture sites) or major (internal bleeds). - Thrombocytopenia - due to platelet aggregation induced by heparin. Local irritation - pain, erythema, ulceration. Rare effects: - Hypersensitivity - chills, fever, uicaria, anaphylactoid reactions may occur. Following Long-term use - osteoporosis, SCOT and SGPT elevation can occur. Drug Toxicity Continuous infusion has led to serious complications (hemorrhage) and acute thromobocytopenia, leading to shock and death. Treatment of Toxicity Slow intravenous infusion of protamine sulfate (calculate the dose of protamine sulphate to be given by the principle: 1 mg of protamine sulphate neutralizes 100 units of heparin). Not more than 50 mg of protamine sulphate to be injected per dose. Alternatively, give fresh blood or plasma or clotting factors.",

Group 1 These drugs reduce plasma glucose by stimulating insulin production, therefore called insulin secretogogues. Hypoglycemia is a well known side effect. Examples are: Sulfonylureas: first generation (chlorpropamide, tobutamide); second generation (Glimipiride, glyburide, glipizide, gliclazide). Megalitinnide/D-phenylalanine analogues: Nateglinide, Rapaglinide. 2. Group 2 These drugs reduce blood glucose without stimulating insulin production, therefore are insulin non-secretogogues. These durgs do not cuase hypoglycemia when used alone and can cause hypoglycemia, only when used with other oral hypoglycemics. Examples are: Biguanides: Metformin, Phenformin Thiazolidinediones: Rosiglitazone, Pioglitazone, Troglitazone. a-glucosidase inhibitors: Acarbose, miglital.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Omeprazole Proton pump inhibitors have become the first-line treatment in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. They are the most effective antisecretory medication available because they block the hydrogen potassium/adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) pump, the final common pathway, regardless of the stimulus. The acid environment in the stomach allows for the release of the prodrug granules, which are then absorbed in the duodenum. Once in the systemic circulation, they are taken up by gastric parietal cells and diffuse into the extracellular canaliculus. The PPI then covalently and irreversibly binds to the proton pump. PPIs require acid for accumulation and activation, which is why they are most efficacious on an empty stomach. PPIs are rapidly and almost completely absorbed. The peak plasma concentration is reached in 1-3 hours. The prodrug is quickly metabolized by the liver, primarily by cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme CYP2. C19, resulting in a half-life of roughly 1 hour. Despite the sho half-life of PPIs, the irreversible covalent bonding to the proton pump provides sustained antisecretory effects; therefore, the effect is not due to plasma concentration of the drug but rather the area under the plasma concentration curve.",
