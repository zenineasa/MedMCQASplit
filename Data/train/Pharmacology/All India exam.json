It acts in multiple ways to reduce inflammation. It is rapidly and completely absorbed. t/2 is 2 days and hence single daily administration is usually sufficient. It is suitable to use for sho-term analgesic and long-term anti-inflammatory drug - RA, OA, ankylosing spondylitis, acute gout, musculoskeletal injuries, dentistry, episiotomy, and dysmenorrhoea. Phenylbutazone (lippincott 2'd edition, page 410,411) It has powerful anti -inflammatory effects but weak analgesic and antipyretic effects It is not a first line drug Uses - sho-term therapy for acute gout and in acute RA, when other NSAIDS have failed. The usefulness is limited by its toxicity. Pharmacokinetics - rapidly and completely absorbed after oral and rectal administration, OXYPHENBUTAZONE is the active metabolite. It is extensively bound to plasma proteins, which causes displacement of warfarin, oral hypoglycemic drugs and sulfonamides from binding sites of plasma proteins, causing the transient elevation in the free fraction of these drugs.",

        "exp": "Propylthiouracil works primarily by inhibiting the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. The thyroid extracts iodide from the plasma and, in an oxidative process, iodinated tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin molecules. Monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine are formed and then coupled to produce either thyroxine (tetraiodothyronine, T4) or triiodothyronine (T3). Proteolytic cleavage of thyroglobulin molecules leads to free T3 or T4, which is then released into the circulation; T3 is several times more potent than T4. Peripheral deiodination of T4 at the 5&; position leads to T3 formation (mainly in the liver); this step is inhibited by propylthiouracil. Decreasing the efficacy of TSH binding, decreasing the rate of thyroglobulin proteolysis, increasing the amount of rT3 formation, and inhibiting the uptake of iodide into the thyroid, would all tend to decrease the formation of thyroid hormones in the thyroid itself.
