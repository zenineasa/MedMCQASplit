        "exp": "ANSWER- (A) Stratified squamous Non-keratinized. REF: Gray's anatomy 39t edition chapter 106, Novak's gynecology 12th edition p-50\"The vagina is a fibromuscular tube lined by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium\"The vagina is composed of three layers: Mucosa: non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, without glands. Vaginal lubrication occurs by transudation primarily, with contributions from cervical and Bartholin gland secretions. The mucosa has a characteristic pattern of transverse ridges and furrows, known as rugae. It is hormonally sensitive, responding to stimulation by estrogen with proliferation and maturation. The mucosa is colonized by mixed bacterial flora with lactobacillus predominant; normal pH is 3. 5 to 4. 5. Muscularis--contains connective tissue and smooth muscle, loosely arranged in inner circular and outer longitudinal layers. Adventitia--consists of endopeivic fascia, adherent to the underlying muscularis. Also know: The blood supply of the vagina includes the vaginal artery and branches from the uterine, middle rectal and internal pudendal arteries. The innervation of the vagina is as follows: the upper vagina--uterovaginal plexus; the distal vagina--pudendal nerve",
