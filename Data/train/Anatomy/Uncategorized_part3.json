The Levator Ani Muscles and the Perineal Body: They form a broad muscular sheet. They effectively suppo the pelvic viscera. The medial edges of the anterior pas of the levator ani muscles are attached to the cervix of the uterus by the pelvic fascia. Transverse cervical ligaments are fibromuscular condensations of pelvic fascia that pass to the cervix and the upper end of the vagina from the lateral walls of the pelvis. Pubocervical Ligaments: The pubocervical ligaments consist of two firm bands of connective tissue that pass to the cervix from the posterior surface of the pubis. They are positioned on either side of the neck of the bladder, to which they give some suppo (pubovesical ligaments). Sacrocervical Ligaments: The sacrocervical ligaments consist of two firm fibromuscular bands of pelvic fascia that pass to the cervix and the upper end of the vagina from the lower end of the sacrum. They form two ridges, one on either side of the rectouterine pouch (pouch of Douglas). The broad ligaments and the round ligaments of the uterus are lax structures, and the uterus can be pulled up or pushed down for a considerable distance before they become taut. Clinically, they are considered to play a minor role in suppoing the uterus. The round ligament of the uterus, which represents the remains of the lower half of the gubernaculum, helps keep the uterus anteveed (tilted forward) and anteflexed (bent forward) but is considerably stretched during pregnancy.",

The relative youthfulness of the patient often rules out prostatic enlargement, which characteristically occurs after the age of 50. As the stream becomes narrower, micturition is prolonged and is followed by postmicturition dribbling as a result of urine trickling from the dilated urethra proximal to the stricture. Urinary frequency by day and night is common and is due to incomplete bladder emptying, coexisting detrusor overactivity or urinary infection. If the stricture is tight enough, the patient will go into acute retention, although this is rare. If this happens, there is a danger that clumsy attempts to pass a urethral catheter will result in a false passage. If a patient has gone into retention because of a urethral stricture, its lumen will be too narrow to pass even a tiny catheter and suprapubic catheterisation is required. Investigation involves uroflowmetry, urethroscopy, urethrography and ultrasound scanning to assess bladder emptying and to detect any upper tract dilatation. The urinary flow rate is typically prolonged and plateau shaped while urethroscopy allows the stricture to be viewedas a circumferential scar. Openings of false passages commemorate previous misguided attempts to pass a urethral catheter. Urethrography using a water-soluble contrast medium will show the extent and severity of the stricture Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1482",

It increases the level of calcium (Ca2+) in the blood by (1) increasing the uptake of calcium from the gut into the blood, (2) decreasing the transfer of calcium from blood to the urine by the kidney, and (3) increasing the release of calcium into the blood from bone Calcitriol increases blood calcium levels () by promoting absorption of dietary calcium from the gastrointestinal tract and increasing renal tubular reabsorption of calcium thus reducing the loss of calcium in the urine. Calcitriol also stimulates release of calcium from bone by its action on the osteoblasts, causing them to release RANKL, which in turn activates osteoclasts. Calcitriol acts in conce with parathyroid hormone (PTH) in all three of these roles. For instance, PTH also stimulates osteoclasts. However, the main effect of PTH is to increase the rate at which the kidneys excrete inorganic phosphate (Pi), the counterion of Ca2+. The resulting decrease in serum phosphate causes Ca5 (PO4)30H to dissolve out of bone thus increasing serum calcium. PTH also stimulates the production of calcitriol. Many of the effects of calcitriol are mediated by its interaction with the calcitriol receptor, also called the vitamin D receptor or VDR.The maintenance of electroneutrality requires that the transpo of Ca2+ ions catalyzed by the intestinal epithelial cells be accompanied by counterions, primarily inorganic phosphate. Thus calcitriol also stimulates the intestinal absorption of phosphate.Calcitriol also inhibits the release of calcitonin, a hormone which reduces blood calcium primarily by inhibiting calcium release from bone. Calcitriol is produced in the cells of the proximal tubule of the nephron in the kidneys by the action of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase, a mitochondrial oxygenase and an enzyme which catalyzes the hydroxylation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (calcifediol). The activity of the enzyme is stimulated by PTH. The reaction is an impoant control point in Ca2+ homeostasis. The production of calcitriol is also increased by prolactin, a hormone which stimulates lactogenesis, a process which requires large amounts of calcium.",

The weakness is present on the side of the stance leg. The body is not able to maintain the center of gravity on the side of the stance leg. Normally, the body shifts the weight to the stance leg, allowing the shift of the center of gravity and consequently stabilizing or balancing the body. However, in unilateral superior gluteal nerve injury, when the patient lifts the opposing leg, the shift is not created and the patient cannot maintain balance leading to instability. Bilateral superior gluteal nerve injury results in a waddling gaitNOTE:Not to be confused with Trendelenburg's sign.

Motor nerve supply of buccinator is the buccal branch of the facial nerve.See the references below in suppo of the answer:Last's anatomy By Chummy S. Sinnatamby, Raymond Jack Last 11/e p364\"Buccinator muscle is pierced by the parotid duct opposite the third upper molar tooth. The duct also passes through the buccal fat pad which lies on the outer surface of buccinator and is paicularly prominent is infants, giving them their chubby cheeks. Beneath the fat lie a few small molar glands; their ducts pierce the muscle to open on the mucous membrane of the cheek, which lines the muscle's inner surface and to which muscle fibers are attached.\"Complications in Cutaneous Surgery By Hugh M.

        "exp": "A i.e. Aerial blood pressure- In standing position, venous return from the lower limb depends largely on muscular activity, especially contraction of calf and foot muscles, known as muscle pump, whose efficiency is aided by the tight sleeve of deep fascia and valves in perforating veins- In standing position, venous return from leg depends largely on the muscular activity of the triceps surae. The efficiency of calf pump is improved by the deep fascia that invests the muscle like an elastic stocking. The blood is prevented from flowing back in superficial veins by presence of valves in perforating veins. If valves become incompetent the blood is forced into superficial veins during calf muscle contraction and by hydrostatic pressure (of blood column) when straining of standing and these veins become high pressure leaks during muscle contraction leading to varicosity .- Within the closed fascial compament, thin walled, valved deep veins are subjected to intermittent pressure. The pulsation of adjacent aeries and contraction of large muscles within the compament compress these deep veins and force the blood up in limb. Presence of valves in perforating veins prevent backward flowing of blood from high pressure deep veins to low pressure superficial veins. More over as the muscles in closed deep fascial compament relax, venous blood is sucked from superficial into deep veins. - So by this time it must be very clear that venous return in lower limb is dependent on muscle pump, deep fascia, valves in perforators, and pulsation of adjacent aeriesQ- Blood flow in blood vessels including veins is primarily because of pumping action of hea. However, venous flow is aided by hea beat (in great veins draining into atrium), the increase in negative intrathoracic pressure (especially in great veins, intrathoracic & intraabdominal veins), and muscle pump (lower limb veins).",

Small spaces appear in lateral plate mesoderm which later fuse to form intraembryonic coelom. This space divides the lateral plate mesoderm into : (i) an outer parietal layer (somatopleuric mesoderm) continous with mesoderm covering the amnion, and (ii) an inner visceral layer (splanchnopleuric mesoderm) continous with mesoderm covering the yolk sac. During 2nd month the intraembryonic coelom is divided into three cavities : (i) pericardial cavity (ii) pleural cavity, and (iii) peritoneal cavity. Somatopleuric mesoderm forms the parietal layer of these cavities (i.e., parietal pericardium, perietal layer of pleura and parietal peritoneum) and splanchnopleuric mesoderm forms the visceral layer of these cavities. Paraxial mesoderm differentiates into somites. By the end of 20th day, the first pair of somites have formed in neck region. After this, about 3 pairs of somites are formed per day and by the end of 5th week about 42-44 somite pairs are formed (4-occipital, 8-cervical, 12-thoracic, 5-lumbar, 5-sacral and 8-10 cooccygeal).

It takes place in the middle segment (ampulla) of fallopian tube. Before feilization, the ovum and sperms reach the ampulla for feilization. Fusion of spermatocyte and ovum leads to formation of zygote. First week of development begins immediately after feilization and includes :?Cleavage of zygote : Zygote (feilized ovum) stas dividing immediately and large zygote is subdivided into smaller daughter cells called blastomeres. Blastomeres are still surrounded by zona pellucida. Cleavage occurs in fallopian tube (uterine tube).Formation of morula : At about 16 cells stage the blastomeres tightly align by the process of compaction to form a compact ball of cells called morula (mulberry). This process of compaction leads to segregation of cells into two groups (i) inner cells (inner cell mass), and (ii) outer cells (outer cell mass). Morula enters uterine cavity 4 days after feilization.Formation of blastocyst : As the morula enters the uterine cavity, uterine fluid diffuses through zona pellucida and fills small intercellular gaps between blastomeres, and morula is conveed to blastocyst. Blastocyst consists of :?Zona pellucida : Outer covering.Embryoblast : A group of centerally located cells of inner cell mass and later give rise to tissues of embryo proper.Trophoblast : A thin outer layer of cells formed from outer cells mass and later give rise extraembryonic tissues.Blastocele : Cavity of blastocyst :The region of blastocyst containing embryoblast is known as embryonic pole and the opposite pole, the abembryonic pole. The trophoblasts overlying the embryoblast at embryonic pole is called polar trophoblast and that occupying the rest of wall called mural trophoblast. Between 5-6 days after feilization, blastocyst hatches from zona pellucida, and this naked blastocyst is ready for implantation.Implantation : About 6-7 days after feilization the blastocyst attaches to the endometrium, a process called as implantation or embedding. Normal site of implantation is posterior wall of the body of uterus close to fundus (at junction offundus with body).",

        "question": "Which passive movement causes pain in deep posterior compament syndrome?",
        "exp": "Dorsiflexion of foot Compament syndrome (CS) occurs whenever increased tissue pressure in a myofascial compament compromises blood flow to the muscles and nerves within that compament, resulting in tissue and nerve damage. The compaments of the lower leg and the volar forearm are paicularly prone to developing elevated compament pressures.Two types of CS have been identified, acute and chronic.Acute CS typically occurs subsequent to a traumatic event, most commonly fractures. Symptoms worsen acutely, and irreversible nerve injury and muscle necrosis occur within hours.Chronic CS (also known as chronic exeional CS, exeional CS, recurrent CS, or subacute CS) is a recurrent syndrome that occurs with exercise or work.Relevant Anatomy There are 4 osteofascial compaments of leg enclosed by the unyielding deep fascia and separated from each other by the bones of die leg and interosseeous membrane and by the anterior and posterior intermuscular septa. Each ofthe compaments is \"sealed\" spaces containing muscles, aeries, and nerves.Anterior or extensor compamento Dorsiflexor muscles of the ankle and footTibialis anterior- Extensor digitorum longus- Extensor hallucis longus- Peroneus teiuso Anterior tibial aery - Commonly injured in lateral tibial plateau fractureso Deep peroneal nerve - Provides sensation to the first dorsal web spaceLateral compamento Peroneus (fibularis) brevis and peroneus (fibularis) longus - Plantar flexor and eveor muscles of the foot o Superficial peroneal nerve - Provides sensation to the dorsum of the footDeep posterior compamento Plantar flexor and phalangeal flexor muscles- Tibialis posterior- Flexor digitorum longus (FDL)- Flexor hallucis longus(and Popliteus, which acts on the,knee joint)o Posterior tibial and peroneal aerieso Posterior tibial nerve - Provides sensation to the sole of the footSuperficial posterior compamento Plantar flexor muscles of the foot- Gastrocnemius- Plantaris- Soleuso Sural nerveAcute compament syndromes are medical emergencies that may require immediate surgical treatment. Acute compament syndromes are usually the result of a traumatic incident. The swelling from the contusion causes the increased pressure in the compament. These injuries are most often seen in the emergency room and are not athletic injuries.Chronic CS is seen more often in the athletic community. Diagnosing this injury is one of exclusion. A complete examination should rule out medial tibial stress syndrome, stress fractures, and Achilles tendon injuries.The athlete presents with pain that is present during weight bearing training. Activities such as running, stair climbing, and jumping are the most common offenders.There will be pain on passive stretch of the muscles of the compament.So in the: Deep posterior compament syndrome- there will be pain on passive dorsiflexion of the foot and on toeextension (since muscles in the deep post compament are plantar flexors and phalangeal flexors )Anterior compament syndrome- there will be pain on passive plantar flexion of the foot and toe flexion.Lateral compament syndrome- there will be pain on passive foot inversion.Superficial posterior compament syndrome- pain is on passive dorsiflexion of foot.Definitive diagnosis of a chronic CS can be made with an intracompamental pressure test. A catheter is inseed into the offending compament to measure its pressure.Once the diagnosis is confirmed with a positive compament measurement, a treatment course is to be chosen. Conservative treatment is the first option. Rehabilitation should include: low impact cross training, flexibility training, appropriate strength training for weakened muscles, and/or the use of ohotics to correct biomechanical abnormalities.If conservative treatment fails, surgical intervention in the next step. Afasciotomy is the procedure of choice.",

Gonadal development is apparent from about 5 weeks of gestation as a thickened area of the urogenital ridge. The differentiation of the gonadal ridge into the testis by 43-50 days (7-8 wks) of gestation is a rapid phenomenon that contrasts with the slower and delayed development of the ovary, which will not become apparent until 140 days (20 weeks) of gestation with the formation of granular cells. Leydig cells are apparent by about 60 days and differentiation of the male external genitals occurs by 65-77 days of gestation.
