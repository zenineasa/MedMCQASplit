Failure of a lateral palatine process to fuse with the median palatine process, which is synonymous with a failure of the primary palate to fuse with the secondary palate, results in a primary cleft palate. Primary clefts of the palate are found anterior to the incisive foramen of the palate. Primary cleft palates may occur along with cleft lips but are the result of a separate developmental defect. Failure of the right and left medial nasal prominences to merge results in a median cleft lip. This is a rare anomaly.

In the orbit, the aery pierces the dura mater, ascends over the lateral side of the optic nerve, and crosses above the nerve from lateral to medial side along with the nasociliary nerve. It then runs forwards along the medial wall of the orbit between the superior oblique and the medial rectus muscles, and parallel to the nasociliary nerve. It terminates near the medial angle of the eye by dividing into the supratrochlear and dorsal nasal branches. Branches Ophthalmic aery gives following branches: 1. Central aery of retina. 2.

It enlarges with age due to enlargement of the underlying median lobe of the prostate and may inhibit complete bladder emptying. Urinary bladder: is a musculomembranous sac which acts as a reservoir for the urine, lies posterior to pubic bones and pubic symphysis. When empty is tetrahedron in shape and lies entirely within true pelvic cavity; spherical when full and may reach as high as umbilicus. When empty has a base (posterior surface) and a superior and two inferolateral surfaces. Base (posterior surface) of bladder defined internally by two ureteric openings at superolateral corners and internal urethral opening inferiorly. Neck of bladder is where base and inferolateral sides meet, inferiorly. Anterior angle or apex is site of attachment of urachus (fibrous remnant of fetal allantois) which is seen as the median umbilical ligament on the anterior abdominal wall. Trigone: Triangular area defined by these opening is the vesicle trigone. The Uvula Vesicae, a small pointed production terminating the trigone in front, and formed by a projection of the medial lobe of the prostate gland into the cavity of the bladder. Ridge between two urethral openings is the interureteric fold. Muscles: Bladder wall is composed of a thick layer of interwoven bundles of smooth muscle running transversely, longitudinally, and obliquely (detrusor muscle). In region of neck, detrusor muscle runs circularly as involuntary internal sphincter. Bladder mucosa is thrown into rugae except within trigone, which is smooth. Aeries: Superior vesical aeries (branches of internal iliac aery) supply apex and superior pa of bladder. Inferior vesical aeries supply fundus and neck in males. Vaginal aeries (branches of uterine aeries) supply fundus and neck in females. Obturator aeries (branches of internal iliac aery) provide aerial twigs. Veins: Vesical venous plexus drains to internal iliac plexus inferior vesical veins. Communicates with prostatic venous plexus in males and uterovaginal venous plexus in females.

Because the extrinsic extensors of the hand are not opposed by the intrinsic flexors of the hand, the metacarpophalangeal joint hyperextends and is unable to extend the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. The proximal and distal interphalangeal joints continue to flex because the extrinsic flexors are not opposed by the intrinsic extensors of the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints. The result is extension of the metacarpophalangeal joint and flexion of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. Hypothenar atrophy also seen. Ref: Moon D. A., Foreman K. B., Albeine K. H.

Upper pole (tubal end) is related to ovarian fimbria of fallopian tube and external iliac aery. Suspensory ligament of ovary (infundibulopelvic ligament) connents it with pelvic brim. Lower pole (uterine end) is connected with lateral angle of uterus by ligament of the ovary, just posteroinferior to the attachment of fallopian tube. Lateral surface is related to ovarian fossa and is covered with peritoneum which separates it from Obturator vessels and nerve. Medial surface is related to fallopian tube and is separated by a peritoneal recess, called ovarian bursa. Anterior border (mesovarian border) is straight and related to fallopian tube and obliterated umblical aery.

Later vessels develop by angiongenesis, sprouting and branching from the endothelium of pre existing vessels.

Also check APPENDIX-3 for list of \"Gait abnormalities\" CLINICAL TESTING OF GLUTEUS MEDIUS AND MINIMUS:\"Sufferers from unilateral paralysis of gluteus medius and minimus have a characteristic lurching gait\". Hip girdle muscles are responsible for keeping the pelvis level when walking. Weakness on one side will lead to a drop in the pelvis on the contralateral side of the pelvis while walking (Trendelenburg sign, lurching gait). With bilateral weakness there will be dropping of the pelvis on both sides during walking leading to waddling. This gait is seen in patient with bilateral superior gluteal nerve injury and myopathies, such as muscular dystrophy. Positive Trendelenburg's sign due to Injury to Superior Gluteal Nerve: The Trendelenburg's sign is said to be positive if, when standing on one leg, the pelvis drops on the side opposite to the stance leg. The weakness is present on the side of the stance leg. The body is not able to maintain the center of gravity on the side of the stance leg. Normally, the body shifts the weight to the stance leg, allowing the shift of the center of gravity and consequently stabilizing or balancing the body. However, in unilateral superior gluteal nerve injury, when the patient lifts the opposing leg, the shift is not created and the patient cannot maintain balance leading to instability (Lurching gait). Bilateral superior gluteal nerve injury results in a waddling gait. NOTE: Not to be confused with Trendelenburg's sign. The Trendelenburg Test or Brodie. Trendelenburg test is a test which can be carried out as pa of a physical examination to determine the competency of the valves in the superficial and deep veins of the legs in patients with varicose veins.",

Following collateral connections may be seen: In the anterior thoracic wall, the internal mammary aeries (arising from subclan aeries) and the epigastric aeries join to form collaterals which supply the abdominal wall and the lower extremities.- Internal mammary aery gives rise to anterior intercostal aeries which forms anastomoses with the posterior intercostals (post intercostals arise from descending aoa).- Superior epigastric aery is terminal branch of internal mammary aery and anastomoses with inferior epigastric aery which arises from external iliac aery. Musculophrenic aery is terminal branch of internal mammary aery and it anastomoses with inferior phrenic and post intercostals.

Immediately within the bony veebra is the epidural space, which lies between the bone and the dura. The epidural space contains a considerable amount of fat and a venous plexus. Because the muscles of the back are located on either side of the midline, no muscle is penetrated when doing a lumbar puncture.
