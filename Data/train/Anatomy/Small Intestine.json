BDC, Vol. II, 3rd ed., 212)THE DUODENAL GLANDS OF BRUNNER (BRUNNER'S GLAND)# These lie in the SUBMUCOSA of the duodenum.# These are small, compound tubuloacinar glands.# They secrete mucus. Region. Major characteristics. Mucosal cell types at surface. Function of surface mucosal cells. Esophagus# Nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium# Skeletal muscle in muscularia externa (upper 1/3)# Smooth muscle (lower 1/3)--Stomach (body and fundus). Rugae: shallow pits; deep glands. Mucous cells. Secrete mucus; form protective layer against acid; tight junctions between these cells probably contribute to the acid barrier of the epithelium Chief cells. Secrete pepsinogen and lipase precursor Parietal cells. Enteroendocrine (EE) cells. Secrete HCI and intrinsic factor. Secrete a variety of peptide hormones. Pylorus. Deep pits; shallow branched glands. Mucous cells. Parietal cells. EE cells. Same as above. Same as above. High concentration of gastrin. Small intestine. Villi, plicae, and crypts. Columnar absorptive cells. Contain numerous microvilli that greatly increase the luminal surface area, facilitating absorption. Duodenum. Brunner glands, which discharge alkaline secretion. Goblet cells. Secrete acid glycoproteins that protect mucosal linings. Paneth cells. Contain granules that contain lysozyme. May play a role in regulating intestinal flora. EE cells. High concentration of cells that secrete cholecystokinin and secretin. Jejunum. Villi, well developed plica, crypts. Same cell types as found in the duodenal epithelium. Same as above. Ileum. Aggregations of lymph nodes called Peyer patchesM cells found over lymphatic nodules and Peyer patches. Endocytose and transport antigen from the lumen to lymphoid cells. Large intestine. Lacks villi, crypts. Mainly mucus-secreting and absorptive cells. Transport Na+ (active) and water (passively) out of lumen",
