Indirect repeat in December 2010. WALLS OF THE ORBIT: The orbit possesses four walls; a roof, lateral wall, floor, and medial wall.* The roof (frontal and sphenoid bones) presents the fossa for the lacrimal gland anterolaterally and the trochlear pit for the cartilaginous or bony pulley of the superior oblique muscle anteromedially. The optic canal lies in the posterior part of the roof, between the roots of the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone. It transmits the optic nerve and ophthalmic artery from the middle cranial fossa. The posterior aspect of the lateral wall (zygomatic and sphenoid bones) is demarcated by the superior and inferior orbital fissures, The superior orbital fissure lies between the greater and lesser wings of the sphenoid bone. It communicates with the middle cranial fossa and transmits cranial nerves III, IV, and VI, the three branches of the ophthalmic nerve, and the ophthalmic veins. The inferior orbital fissure communicates with the infratemporal and pterygopalatine fossae and transmits the zygomatic nerve. The lateral walls of the two orbits are set at approximately a right angle from one another, whereas the medial walls are nearly parallel to each other. The floor (maxilla, zygomatic, and palatine bones) presents the infraorbital groove and canal for the nerve and artery of the same name. The inferior oblique muscle arises anteromedially, immediately lateral to the nasolacrimal canal. The medial wall (ethmoid, lacrimal, and frontal bones) is very thin. Its main component (the orbital plate of the ethmoid) is papyraceous (paper-thin). At the junction of the medial wall with the roof, the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramina transmit the nerves and arteries of the same name.",

The greater petrosal nerve, derived from the facial nerve, supplies the parasympathetic autonomic component of the lacrimal gland. The greater petrosal nerve traverses alongside branches of the V1 and V2 divisions of the trigeminal nerve. The parasympathetic nerve supply originates from the lacrimatory nucleus of the facial nerve in the pons. From the pons nucleus preganglionic parasympathetic fibres run in the nervus intermedius (small sensory root of facial nerve) to the geniculate ganglion but they do not synapse there. Then, from the geniculate ganglion, the preganglionic fibres run in the greater petrosal nerve (a branch of the facial nerve) which carries the parasympathetic secretomotor fibers through the foramen lacerum, where it joins the deep petrosal nerve (which contains postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglion) to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal (vidian nerve) which then traverses through the pterygoid canal to the pterygopalatine ganglion. Here, the fibers synapse and postganglionic fibers join the fibers of the maxillary nerve. In the pterygopalatine fossa itself, the parasympathetic secretomotor fibers branch off with the zygomatic nerve and then branch off again, joining with the lacrimal branch of the ophthalmic division of CN V, which supplies sensory innervation to the lacrimal gland along with the eyelid and conjunctiva.",

Otic Ganglion# Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the inferior salivary nucleus travel on the lesser superficial petrosal branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve and synapse at the otic ganglion.# Postganglionic fibers from the otic ganglion join the auriculotemporal branch of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve to reach the parotid gland. Visceral Ganglia# The vagus nerve is the only cranial nerve that leaves the head and neck.# It carries preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the rest of the body, with the exception of the pelvic organs and organs associated with the hindgut.# These fibers synapse at ganglia in the walls of the organ being innervated, from where short postganglionic fibers serve their secretomotor role.
