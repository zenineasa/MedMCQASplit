Umbilical cord is covered by amniotic epithelium and contains a core of mesenchyme known as whartan's jelly. o Contents of umbilical cord are: (i) Wharton fsjelly, (ii) Two umbilical arteries, (iii) One (left) umbilical vein, (iv) Remnant of yolk sac, and (v) Remnant of allanto-enteric diverticulum. Initially 2 umbilical arteries and 2 umbilical veins develop in mesoderm, but right umbilical vein disappears. Left umbilical vein persists along with 2 umbilical arteries. o At full term, the umbilical cord measures 1 -2cm in diameter, and 50-55cm in length and generally attached to the center of fetal surface of placenta.",
