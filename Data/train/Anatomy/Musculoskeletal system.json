Current evidence suggests that the neoplas- tic cells of giant cell tumor are primitive osteoblast precur- sors but they represent only a minority of the tumor cells. The bulk of the tumor consists of non-neoplastic osteoclasts and their precursors. The neoplastic cells express high levels of RANKL, which promotes the proliferation of osteoclast precursors and their differentiation into mature osteoclasts RANK expressed by these cells. However, the feedback between osteoblasts and osteoclasts that nor- mally regulates this process during bone remodeling is absent. What results is a localized but highly destructive resorption of bone matrix by reactive osteoclasts. Giant cell tumors arise in the epiphysis but may extend into the metaphysis. The majority arise around the knee (distal femur and proximal tibia), but viually any bone can be involved. The typical location of these tumors near joints frequently causes ahritis-like symptoms. Occa- sionally, they present with pathologic fractures. Most are solitary;",

They are subclassified histologically as conven- tional (hyaline cailage producing), clear cell, dedifferenti- ated, and mesenchymal variants. Conventional tumors are fuher subdivided by site as central (intramedullary) and peripheral (juxtacoical). Conventional central tumors con- stitute about 90% of chondrosarcomas. Chondrosarcoma is about half as common as osteosarcoma and is the second most common malignant matrix-producing tumor of bone. Individuals with chondrosarcoma are usually in their 40s or older. The clear cell and especially the mesenchymal variants occur in younger patients, in their teens or 20s. These tumors affect men twice as frequently as women. Chondrosarcomas commonly arise in the axial skeleton, especially the pelvis, shoulder, and ribs. Unlike benign enchondroma, the distal extremities are rarely involved. On imaging, the calcified matrix appears as foci of flocculent densities. A slow-growing, low-grade tumor causes reac- tive thickening of the coex, whereas a more aggressive high-grade neoplasm destroys the coex and forms a soft tissue mass. The clear cell variant is unique in that it origi- nates in the epiphyses of long tubular bones",

The tumors frequently destroy the surrounding coices and produce soft tissue masses. They spread exten- sively in the medullary canal, infiltrating and replacing hemato- poietic marrow. Infrequently, they penetrate the epiphyseal plate or enter the joint. When joint invasion occurs, the tumor grows into it along tendoligamentous structures or through the attachment site of the joint capsule. The tumor cells vary in size and shape and frequently have large hyperchromatic nuclei. Bizarre tumor giant cells are common, as are mitoses, some of them abnormal (e. g. tripolar). Vascular invasion is usually conspicuous, and some tumors also exhibit extensive necrosis. The formation of bone by the tumor cells is diagnostic",
