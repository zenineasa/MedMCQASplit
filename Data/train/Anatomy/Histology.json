From this sinus, a number of radial cortical sinuses run through the cortex towards the medulla. Reaching the medulla, the sinuses join to form larger medullary' sinuses. In turn, the medullary' sinuses join to form one efferent vessel through which lymph leaves the node. Special histological features about other options: SPLEEN: White pulp of the spleen is formed of a mass of T and B lymphoctytes arranged as lymphoid nodules. Each nodule has an eccentrically placed central arteriole. Blood passes outwards from the central arteriole to reach the marginal zone surrounding the white pulp. The nodules are also called Malpigian bodies. The red pulp is made up of a mesh of leaky sinusoids! vascular sinuses) through which the red cells are squeezed. Cells lining the sinusoids are phagocytic. So the red pulp surrounds the lymphoid follicles (white pulp). The part of the red pulp immediately surrounding the white pulp is called the marginal zone. The marginal zone contains antigen presenting cells. THYMUS: 1. Hassall's corpuscles found in the medulla are highly specific. THYROID: 1. The gland is covered by a fibrous capsule, septae from which divide it into lobules. Each lobule is made up of an aggretation of follicles, lined by follicular cells. The follicle has a cavity filled with a homogenous material called colloid. Apart from the follicular cells, the thyroid gland contains C-cells or parafollicular cells which intervene between the follicular cells and the basement membrane. Lymph nodeso Lymph nodes are placed along the course of lymphatic vessels. o They are surrounded by a fibrous capsule from which trabeculae penetrate into the nodes, o There are two zones in lymph nodes. Outer cortex. Inner medullao Subcapsular sinus lies immediately deep to the capsule and immediately above the cortex, i. e. between the capsule and cortex. Cortexo In cortex, there is accumulation of proliferating lymphocytes to form follicle (primary follicle), o Beside proliferating lymphocytes, cortical follicle also contains dendritic macrophages, o On antigenic stimulation, germinal centers (secondary follicles) develop writhin the primary follicles. Medullao The lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages are arranged as donated branching bands; i. e. Medullary Cords. o Cortical follicles and medullary cords contain B-lymphocytes. o Between the corticle follicle and medullary cords, there is paracortical area which contains T-lymphocytes.",

        "exp": "Ans. D. All of the above > A. Proliferating T cells. Lymph Nodes: Lymph nodes are located at sites throughout the body, strategically placed to process antigens present in lymph drained from most organs via the afferent lymphatics. Lymph nodes have a capsule, a cortex, a medulla, and sinuses (subcapsular, cortical, and medullary) The sinuses contain macrophages that take up and process antigen, which may then be presented to lymphocytes. The cortex is divided into follicular and diffuse (paracortical) regions, and the medulla into medullary cords and sinuses. The paracortex contains high endothelial venules (HEV) (through which both T and B lymphocytes enter the node) and specialized antigen-presenting cells (APCs), the interdigitating dendritic cell, and which may be related to the cutaneous Langerhans cell, and which present antigen to cells. Both T cell and early B cell reactions to antigen occur in the paracortex, while the germinal center (GC) reaction occurs in the follicular cortex. The follicular cortex also contains a specific type of accessory cell, the follicular dendritic cell (FDC); adhesion to the FDC- antigen complex is important in the differentiation of B cells in response to antigen. Plasma cells and effector T cells generated by immune reactions accumulate in the medullary cords and exit via the medullary sinuses. Lymphnode is a 2deg lymphoid organ that has many afferents, 1 or more efferents. Encapsulated, with trabeculae. Functions are nonspecific filtration by macrophages, storage of B and T cells, and immune response activation. The hmph node is associated with afferent and efferent lymphatic vessels. It is surrounded by a capsule, has trabeculae, and can be divided into outer cortical, inner cortical (paracortical), and medullary regions. Follicle. Site of B-cell localization and proliferation. In outer cortex. 1deg follicles are dense and dormant. 2deg follicles have pale central germinal centers and are active. Medulla. Consists of medullary cords (closely packed lymphocytes and plasma cells) and medullary sinuses. Medullary sinuses communicate with efferent lymphatics and contain reticular cells and macrophages. Paracortex. Houses T cells. Region of cortex between follicles and medulla. Contains high endothelial venules through which T and B cells enter from blood. Not well developed in patients with Di. George syndrome. Paracortex enlarges in an extreme cellular immune response (e. g., viral infection). Structure of Lymph node",
