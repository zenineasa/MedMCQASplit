Penetrance (the percentage of carriers who develop breast cancer) varies from 30% to 90% depending on the specific mutation present. Mutations in BRCA1 also markedly increase the risk of developing ovarian carcinoma, which occurs in as many as 20% to 40% of carriers. BRCA2 confers a smaller risk for ovarian carci- noma (10% to 20%) but is associated more frequently with male breast cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers are also at higher risk for other epithelial cancers, such as prostatic and pancreatic carcinomas. BRCA1 (on chromosome 17q21) and BRCA2 (on chro- mosome 13q12. 3) are both large genes, and hundreds of different mutations distributed throughout their coding regions have been associated with familial breast cancers.",

        "exp": "Almost all (>95%) of breast malignancies are adenocarci- nomas that first arise in the duct/lobular system as carci- noma in situ; at the time of clinical detection the majority (at least 70%) will have breached the basement mem- brane and invaded the stroma. Carcinoma in situ refers to a neoplastic proliferation of epithelial cells that is confined to ducts and lobules by the basement membrane. Invasive carcinoma (synonymous with \"infiltrating\" carcinoma) has penetrated through the basement membrane and grows within stroma. Here, the cells have the potential to invade into the vasculature and thereby reach regional lymph nodes and distant sites. The terms ductal and lobular are still used to describe subsets of both in situ and invasive carcinomas, but most evidence suggests all breast carcinomas actually arise from cells in the terminal duct lobular unit. Carcinoma in situ was originally classified as DCIS or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) based on the resemblance of the involved spaces to normal ducts or lobules. It is now recognized that these growth patterns are not related to the cell of origin, but rather reflect differences in tumor cell genetics and biology. By current convention, \"lobular\" refers to invasive carci- nomas that are biologically related to LCIS, and \"ductal\" is used more generally for adenocarcinomas that cannot be classified as a special histologic type.",
