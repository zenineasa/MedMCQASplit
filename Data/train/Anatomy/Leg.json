        "exp": "ANSWER: (C) Tibialis anterior. REF: Grays anatomy 40th ed chapter 83, Snell's 8th ed ch: 10. Tibialis anterior is a superficial muscle and is therefore readily palpable lateral to the tibia. It arises from the lateral condyle and proximal half to two-thirds of the lateral surface of the tibial shaft; the adjoining anterior surface of the interosseous membrane; the deep surface of the deep fascia; and the intermuscular septum between itself and extensor digitorum longus.
