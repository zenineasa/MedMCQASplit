It arises from the lateral condyle and proximal half to two-thirds of the lateral surface of the tibial shaft; the adjoining anterior surface of the interosseous membrane; the deep surface of the deep fascia; and the intermuscular septum between itself and extensor digitorum longus.Muscles of the Anterior/Extensor Fascial Compartment of the LegMuscleOriginInsertionNerveSupplyNerveRootsActionTibialisanteriorLateral surface of shaft of tibia and interosseous membraneMedial cuneiform and base of first metatarsal boneDeepperonealnerveL4, 5Extends foot at ankle joint; inverts foot at subtalar and transverse tarsal joints; holds up medial longitudinal arch of footExtensordigitorurnlongusAnterior surface of shaft of fibulaExtensor expansion of lateral four toesDeepperonealnerve15; SIExtends toes; extends foot at ankle jointPeroneustertius(Fibuiaristertius)Anterior surface of shaft of fibulaBase of fifth metatarsal boneDeepperonealnerveL5; SIExtends foot at ankle joint; everts foot at subtalar and transverse tarsal jointsExtensorhallucislongusAnterior surface of shaft of fibula1 Base of distal phalanx of great toeDeepperonealnerveL5; SIExtends big toe; extends foot at ankle joint; inverts foot at subtalar and transverse tarsal jointsExtensordigitorurnbrevisCalcaneumBy four tendons into the proximal phalanx of big toe and long extensor tendons to second, third, and fourth toesDeepperonealnerveL5-S1Extends toes Muscles of the Lateral Fascial Compartment of the LegMuscleOriginInsertionNerveSupplyNerveRootsActionPeroneuslongusLateral surface of shaft of fibulaBase of first metatarsal and the medial cuneiformSuperficialperonealnerveL5; SI,2Plantar flexes foot at ankle joint; everts foot at subtalar and transverse tarsal joints; supports lateral longitudinal and transverse arches of footPeroneusbrevisLateral surface of shaft fibulaBase of fifth metatarsal boneSuperficialperonealnerveL5; SI,2Plantar flexes foot at ankle joint; everts foot at subtalar and transverse tarsal joint; supports lateral longitudinal arch of foot",
