That makes the PCA circulation the most impoant pa of the ocular and ONH circulation. Therefore, disturbances in the PCA circulation can result in a variety of ocular and ONH vascular disorders, causing varying degrees of visual loss. I have investigated various aspects of the PCA circulation in health and disease by anatomic, experimental, and clinical studies since 1955. The objective of this lecture is essentially to summarize the main findings of those studies.

Pulp is covered by a layer of tall columnar cells called odontoblasts. The space-occupying pulp is called pulp cavity. Dentine is a calcified material surrounding the pulp cavity. It forms the basis of the tooth and contains spiral tubulesradiating from the pulp cavity. Each tubule is occupied by a protoplasmic process from the odontoblast. In dentine, calcium and organic matter are in the same propoion as bone. Cementum is the bony covering over the neck and root of tooth. It commonly overlaps the lower pa of enamel.

When cut horizontally the bend in the V is called the genu, the pa in front of the genu is the anterior limb, and the pa behind the genu is called the posterior limb. There is also a retrolenticular and a sublenticular pa to the internal capsule. The posterior limb of the internal capsule contains coicospinal fibers and sensory fibers from the body. The genu contains coicobulbar (or coico-nuclear) fibers, which run between the coex and the brainstem. The retrolenticular pa contains fibers from the optic system, coming from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus More posteriorly, this becomes the optic radiation. Some fibers from the medial geniculate nucleus (which carry auditory information) also pass in the sublenticular pa. Blood supply Striate aeries, which come off the middle cerebral aery, enter through the anterior perforated substance in the base of the brain. Infarctions to the internal capsule tend to be small, punctate lesions.

It usually manifests in the neonate or in early infancy (occasionally present at bih) The swelling is soft and paially compressible and invariably increases in size when the child coughs or cries. The characteristic that distinguishes it from all other neck swellings is that it is brilliantly translucent. The cysts are filled with clear lymph and are lined by endothelium. Mostly these are multiple cysts but occasionally they can be unilocular. It may show spontaneous regression. Treatment There are two methods of treatment: Surgical excision & Sclerotherapy \"Complete surgical excision is the preferred treatment; however, this may be impossible because of the hygroma infiltrating within and around impoant neurovascular structures. Because hygromas are not neoplastic tumors, radical resection with removal of major blood vessels and nerves is not indicated. Injection of sclerosing agents such as bleomycin or the derivative of Streptococcus progenies OK-432 have also been repoed to be effective in the management of cystic hygromas. Intracystic injection of sclerosants appears to be most effective for macrocystic hygromas, as opposed to the microcystic variety. \" \"The modern management of most cystic hygromas includes the combination of surgical excision and image-guided sclerotherapy. \" Ref: Love & Bailey 25/e p729",

Paresis of isolated muscles innervated by oculomotor branches is almost always due to a lesion of their branches within the orbit or to disease processes that affect the muscle or myoneural junction. Nuclear lesions, however, may cause isolated weakness of one of the muscles innervated by the oculomotor nerve, except the superior rectus muscle (crossed innervation noted previously), the levator palpebrae superioris (a single caudal subnucleus innervates the levators bilaterally), the pupillary constrictors (visceral nuclei are spread throughout the oculomotor nucleus), and the medial rectus muscle (three separate subnuclei). Thus, isolated unilateral palsies of the inferior rectus muscle have been associated with lesions of the inferior rectus subnucleus. More characteristic of nuclear involvement is unilateral palsy of the third cranial nerve in conjunction with weaknessf the ipsilateral and contralateral superior rectus muscles and bilateral incomplete ptosis. Occasionally, only the superior rectus muscle contralateral to the lesion is involved. Bilateral palsies of the third cranial nerve but with sparing of the levator muscles of the eyelid may be caused by bilateral nuclear lesions that spare the central caudal levator subnucleus. Conversely, isolated bilateral ptosis and sparing of the extraocular muscles and pupils have been described with lesions that involve the levator subnucleus and spare more rostral oculomotor subnuclei.

        "question": "Structures present in Radical neck node resection",
        "exp": "Radical neck dissection (RND) was attributed to Crile in 1906 and was considered the gold standard for the removal of nodal metastases (Fig. 33-4). Through a subsequent close reading of Crile's surgical notes, it was found that he had begun to modify his surgical technique to remove only selected regions of the neck, depending on the site of the primary tumor; this has become common surgical practice for HNSCC at the present time. All modifications of neck dissection are described in relation to the standard RND, which removes nodal levels I through V and the sternocleidomastoid muscle, internal jugular vein, cranial nerve XI, cervical plexus, and submandibular gland. Preservation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, internal jugular vein, or cranial nerve XI in any combination is referred to as a modified RND, and the structures preserved are specified for nomenclature. A modified neck dissection may also be referred to as a Bocca neck dissection, named after the surgeon who demonstrated that not only is modi- fied RND equally as effective in controlling neck disease as RND when structures are preserved that are not directly involved in tumor, but also the functional outcomes of patients after modified RND are superior to functional outcomes after RND. 18 Although resection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle or one internal jugular vein is relatively nonmorbid, loss of cranial nerve XI leaves a denervated trapezius muscle, which can cause a painful chronic frozen shoulder. RND or modified RND can be performed for removal of detectable nodal disease. Preservation of any of levels I through V during neck dissection is referred to as selective neck dissection and is based on knowledge of the patterns of spread to neck regions. Selective neck dissection is performed on a clinically negative (N0) neck, with preservation of nodal groups carrying less than a 20% chance of being involved with metastatic disease. Regional control has been shown to be as effective after selective neck dissection as after modified RND in patients with a clinically negative neck. Studies evaluating treatment of an N0 neck inves- tigated the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy, which attempts to predict the disease status of the neck based on the first echelon of nodes that drain the tumor. 19 Although sentinel lymph node biopsy has been used extensively with melanoma, its use in HNSCC has come about more gradually. Early results using iso- sulfan blue dye alone suggested that this technique cannot con- sistently identify the sentinel node in HNSCC. More recent results using a gamma probe were more encouraging, although the isolated node should be serial step-sectioned at a thickness of 150 nm and be examined through permanent processing. Recom- mendations at the present time are that the technique should be restricted to early-stage (T1 or T2) oral and oropharyngeal cancers, with clinically N0 necks; the gamma probe continues to be an investigational tool pending validation by large randomized clini- cal trials.

In Ranid frogs, the hypoglossal nerve emerges as the ventral ramus of the second spinal nerve. The first spinal nerve, though present in tadpoles, is absent as a separate nerve in adults. To investigate the central nervous system components of the hypoglossal nerve in Rana pipiens, we soaked identified, transected branches of this nerve in horseradish peroxidase, a retrograde and anterograde tracer. We found that the hypoglossal nerve in these frogs originates from two efferent nuclei located in the caudal medulla, a medial and a lateral one. Afferent fibers, primarily from the tongue, are also found in the hypoglossal nerve and travel in the dorsolateral funiculus of the spinal cord, descending to thoracic levels of the cord. Efferents to intrinsic tongue muscles and the genioglossus muscle originate in the medial medullary nucleus. Efferents to the sternohyoid muscle, which travel through the hypoglossal nerve, originate in the lateral medullary nucleus. Since in mammals the sternohyoid muscle is innervated by the first spinal nerve, we have obtained experimental evidence that the hypoglossal nerve in Rana pipiens contains components of this spinal nerve.",
