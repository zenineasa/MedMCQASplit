Other than the clavicle, it is the first long bone to ossify. The process starts in the midshaft in the seventh prenatal week and extends to produce a miniature shaft that is largely ossified at birth. Secondary centres appear in the distal end (from which the condyles and epicondyles are formed) during the ninth month, in the head during the first six months after birth, in the greater trochanter during the fourth year and in the lesser between the twelfth and fourteenth year. The femur is ossified from five centers in the following order of appearance. Shaft7th intrauterine month. Lower end9th month of fetal life. Head. During first 6 months after birth.

BDC, Vol. II, 3rd ed., 132, 135, 136)# The head of talus rests directly on the upper surface of the Plantar calcaneonavicular ligament (Spring ligament), which is covered by fibrocartilage.# The plantar calcanonavicular ligament, as the name sugests, runs from the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneum to the navicular bone on its inferior aspect. The upper surface of the ligament is covered by fibrocartilage and strongly supports the head of the talus from below. It also acts like a tie beam to support the medial longitudinal arch.# Most commonly the lateral collateral ligament is sprained, mostly so anterior talo-fibular component. 2. Also remember: Talar neck fractures are the commonest injury and are usually high energy (historically termed 'aviator's astragalus'). A significant complication is avascular necrosis of the talus. The goal of treatment is anatomical reduction and stable fixation, which helps reduce the risk of osteonecrosis. Hawkins' sign can be seen approximately 6-8 weeks after injury on plain radiographs. This appears as subchondral lucency of the talar dome, which signifies bony reabsorption, i. e. a viable bone.",
