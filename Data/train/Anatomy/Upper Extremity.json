The biceps brachii is the most powerful supinator muscle. Injury to this nerve would result in weakness of supination and forearm flexion and lateral forearm sensory loss. Injury to the radial nerve would result in weakened extension and a characteristic wrist drop. Injury to the median nerve causes paralysis of flexor digitorum superficialis and other flexors in the forearm and results in a characteristic flattening of the thenar eminence.

The ulnar nerve is not implicated in these symptoms. It does not provide sensation to digits 1 to 3.

The four dorsal interossei muscles are bipennate in nature. They are larger in size compare to palmar interossei. They are arising from the adjacent sides of two metacarpal bones. The first and largest muscle is called as abductor indicis. It is attached to the radial side of the proximal phalanx of the index finger. The second attached to the radial and third are attached to the ulnar sides of the middle finger. The fourth may be wholly attached to the digital expansion, but it often sends an additional slip to the proximal phalanx. Palmar Interossei. Palmar interossei are smaller compare to dorsal interossei and lie on the palmar surfaces of the metacarpal bones rather than between them. The first arises from the ulnar side of the palmar surface of the base of the first metacarpal bone and is inserted into a sesamoid bone on the ulnar side of the proximal phalanx. The middle finger has no palmar interosseous. The second arises from the ulnar side of the second metacarpal bone and is inserted into the same side of the digital expansion of the index finger. The third arises from the radial side of the fourth metacarpal bone and is inserted together with the third lumbrical.

        "exp": "The radial nerve descends posteriorly between the long and lateral heads of the triceps and passes inferolaterally on the back of the humerus between the medial and lateral heads of the triceps.

The deep branch of the radial nerve winds laterally around the radius and runs between the two heads of the supinator and continues as the posterior interosseous nerve, innervating extensor muscles of the forearm. Because this injury does not result in loss of sensation over the skin of the upper limb, it is likely that the superficial branch of the radial nerve is not injured. If the radial nerve were injured very proximally, the woman would not have extension of her elbow. The branches of the radial nerve to the triceps arise proximal to where the nerve runs in the spiral groove. The anterior interosseous nerve arises from the median nerve and supplies the flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus, and pronator quadratus, none of which seem to be injured in this example.

        "exp": "Ans. C. Serratus Anteriora. Winged scapula occurs due to damage to the serratus anterior muscle causes the deformation of the back. b. The serratus anterior muscle attaches to the medial anterior aspect of the scapula (i. e. it attaches on the side closest to the spine and runs along the side of the scapula that faces the ribcage) and normally anchor the scapula against the rib cage. c. When the serratus anterior contracts, upward rotation, abduction, and weak elevation of the scapula occurs, allowing the arm to be raised above the head. d. The long thoracic nerve innervates the serratus anterior; therefore, damage to or impingement of this nerve can result in weakening or paralysis of the muscle. e. If this occurs, the scapula may slip away from the rib cage, giving it the wing-like appearance on the upper back. f. This characteristic may particularly be seen when the affected person pushes against resistance. The person may also have limited ability to lift their arm above their head. Causes: a. The most common cause of scapular winging is anterior paralysis. This is typically caused by damage (i. e. lesions) to the long thoracic nerve. b. This nerve supplies the serratus anterior, which is located on the side of the thorax and acts to pull the scapula forward. c. Serratus anterior palsy is a dysfunction that is characteristic of traumatic, non-traumatic, and idiopathic injury to the long thoracic nerve",

This nerve is most likely affected in a fracture of the scapula as described in the question. The thoracodorsal nerve runs behind the axillary artery and lies superficial to the subscapularis muscle and would therefore be protected. The axillary nerve passes posteriorly through the quadrangular space, which is distal to the suprascapular notch. The subscapular nerve originates from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, which is distal to the site of fracture.",
