        "exp": "Anal manometry has been used in the study of patients who have fecal incontinence as an attempt to quantify anal sphincter function. Typical basic parameters are resting pressure and squeeze pressure. Resting pressure denotes resting tonicity and thus is used as an index parameter for internal anal sphincter which is in charge of that tonicity, while squeeze pressure denotes the strength of voluntary contraction and is used for contractility of external anal sphincter. But resting pressure is usually regarded more reliable as an index of continence function judging from physical propeies during metric procedure because squeeze pressure depends more on patient's subjective effo with resultant more variation. Resting pressure has, however, a restriction that it represents cross sectional status of the anal canal without taking into consideration its three dimensional structure. Resting pressure gradient (RPG) of the anal canal is devised as one of the advanced parameters to make up for such a restriction. The RPG is given by the ratio of pressure difference between maximum resting pressure and basal resting pressure to interval distance between their levels. Therefore, it can be said that it has 2 components as factors of determination, which are pressure and length factor, respectively. Ref - pubmed. com <a href=\"",

The duodena recess include: Superior duodenal recess lies directly to the fouh pa of the duodenum, adjacent to L2 veebrae, and behind a cresentric superior duodenal fold. Inferior duodenal recess lies to the left of the fouh pa of the duodenum, adjacent to L3 veebrae, behind a triangular inferior duodenal fold. Paraduodenal recess lies a little to the left and slightly behind the fouth pa of the duodenum, behind a falciparum fold of peritneum. Its right free edge contains the inferior mesentric vein and ascending branch of the left colic aery. Retroduodenal recess is the largest among duodenal recesses. It lies behind the third and fouh pas of the duodenum in front of the abdominal aoa. It has a wide orifice flanked by the duodenalparietal folds of peritoneum. Mesentericoparietal recess lies just below the third pa of the duodenum and forms a pocket in the upper pa of the mesentry towards the right. It has a large, left facing orifice behind a fold of mesentry raised by the superior mesentric aery.
