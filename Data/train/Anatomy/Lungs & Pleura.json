Tertiary bronchus o It is supplied independently by a segmental (tertiary ) bronchus and a tertiary branch of the pulmonary artery'. o Each branchopulmonary segment is drained by intersegment parts of pulmonary' vein that lie in intersegmentai space and drain adjacent segments. o Thus each segment does not have its independent segmetal vein and each segment drains into more than one vein. Each vein drains more than one segment. Features of bronchopulmonary segmentso Characteristic features of each bronchopulmonary'segment are. Is a pyramidal shaped segment of lung, with its apex facing the lung root and its base at the pleural surface. Is the largest subdivision of a lobe. Is an independent respiratory unit. Is separated from adjacent segments by connective tissue septa which form intersegemental planes. Is surrounded by connective tissue which is continuous on the surface with pulmonary pleura. Is supplied independently by a segmental (tertiary) bronchus and a tertiary branch of the pulmonary artery. Is named according to the segmental bronchus supplying it. Is drained by intersegmentai parts of the pulmonary veins that He in intersegmentai space and drain adjacent segments. Thus each segment has more than one vein and each vein drains more than one segment. Is not a bronchovascular segment, because it does not have its own vein. Is surgically resectable: During removal, the surgeon works along the pulmonary' vein to isolate a particular segment. Distal portions of adjacent bronchopulmonary segments",

The right main bronchus gives rise to its first branch, the superior lobar bronchus, then enters the right lung opposite the fifth thoracic vertebra. The left principal bronchus, which is narrower and less vertical than the right, is 5 cm long. Passing to the left inferior to the aortic arch, it crosses anterior to the oesophagus, thoracic duct and descending aorta; the left pulmonary artery is at first anterior and then superior to it. Itenters the hilum of the Is ft lung at the level of the sixth thoracic vertebra and divides into a superior and an inferior lobar bronchus.",
