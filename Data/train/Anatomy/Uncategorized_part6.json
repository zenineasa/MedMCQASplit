        "exp": "Barrett&; s esophagus is more common in men than in women (3: 1 ratio) Barrett&; s esophagus can be reversed but only with antireflux surgery (response to medications is not good). A fundoplication may promote regression of the columnar epithelium. Many studies have shown that regression occurs in 15-50% of patients when the length of the Barrett segment is less than 3 cm. \" The common belief that Barrett&; s epithelium cannot be reversed is likely false. De. Meester and associates repoed that, after antireflux surgery, loss of IM (intestinal metaplasia) in patients with visible BE was rare, but occurred in73% of patients with inapparent IM of the cardia. This suggests that the metaplastic process may indeed be reversible if reflux is eliminated early in its process, that cardiac mucosa is dynamic, and that, as opposed to IM extending several centimeters into the esophagus, IM of the cardia is more likely to regress following antireflux surgery. More about the tit of Barret&; s oesophagus First, the natural course of Barrett&; s oesophagus. - Barrett&; s esophagus develops during healing of erosive esophagitis with continued acid reflux and the Barrett&; s esophagus progresses through a dysplastic stage before developing into adenocarcinoma. The stages are - Erosive esophagitis - Metaplasia (Barrett&; s esophagus) - Low grade dysplasia - high grade dysplaisa - Adenocarcinoma Treatment of Barrett&; s esophagus is same as for reflux esophagitis - Conservative (antacids, H2 blocking agents, elevation of the head of bed, and avoidance of smoking and alcohol etc.) and Anti-reflux surgery (Nissen&; s fundoplication is anti-reflux procedure of choice) As there is substantial increased risk of cancer with Barrett&; s esophagus, a regular follow-up with endoscopy and biopsy is done. This allows detection of cancer at an early stage with improved long-term survival after resection In the absence of dysplasia - Surveillance endoscopy every 12-24 months. In the presence of low-grade dysplasia - Patients with low grade dysplasia should be treated for 12 weeks with high-dose acid suppression therapy and then biopsy repeated. (the rationale for this approach is to decrease the mucosal inflammation by blocking acid secretion, allowing the pathologist a more accurate reading), If the repeated biopsy show metaplasia or high-grade dysplasia, the patient should be managed accordingly. If repeated low-grade dysplasia is seen- surveillance endoscopy is done every 6-12 months. If high grade dysplasia is detected (the diagnosis must be confirmed by two experienced pathologist) - esophagectomy with removal of all columnar lined epithelium or if resection is not done, then the patient should be strictly followed at 3 monthly interval. If cancer is detected resection is done. Rationale for esophagectomy in high grade dysplasia is based on the following considerations- (a) cancer is already present in about 30 to 50% of patients operated for high grade dysplasia. (b) cancer develops in about 50% fo patients during follow up.) Ref: CSDT 13/e p438; Schwaz 9/e p841",

Left renal vein is at the level of L2, Abdominal aoa at the level of T12, Spinal cord terminates at the lower border of L1. Urinary bladder when empty is located within the pelvis, as it fills it expands and extends upwards into the abdominal cavity, reaching up to the umbilicus or even higher. Thus in a penetrating injury of lower abdomen urinary bladder is the only structure that could have been pierced. Penetrating injuries of bladder: Bladder injuries can occur as a result of either penetrating or blunt trauma. Bladder injuries are classified as extraperitoneal (60%), intraperitoneal (30%), or both (10%). Stab or gun shot wound to the lower abdomen or perineum can injure the bladder. Gross hematuria is seen in 90% of patients. Classification: Bladder injury can be classified by AAST Bladder Organ Injury Scale. Grade. Type of injury. Injury Description. AIS 90. IHaematoma. Contusion, intramural haematoma2. ILaceration. Paial thickness3. ILaceration. Extraperitoneal bladder wall laceration <2cm4. IIILaceration. Extraperitoneal (>2cm) or intra-peritoneal (4. IVLaceration. Intraperitoneal bladder wall laceration >2cm4. VLaceration.

The number of elements of the veebral column has been repoed to vary between 32 and 35. Addition to a group is frequently seen, which occurs through the reduction in number of veebrae of an adjacent group, the total number being. The location of such a veebra is predominately at the ends of the column and at the levels of transition between its regions. Thus, sacralization of the fifth lumbar, lumbar-like aicular processes in the eleventh thoracic, and thoracic costal facets on the seventh cervical are observed. unchanged. In this variation, the veebra added is usually intermediate in form between the adjacent groups. The levels of transition may be shifted cephalad, resulting in 23 mobile veebrae, or shifted caudad, resulting in 25 presacral veebrae. Such variations may occur in 2-11% of the population. The number of veebrae comprising the sacrum maybe increased to six, resulting from the fusion of the first coccygeal (50% in whites, 30% in Negroes) or, less often, of the last lumbar (sacralization) (8% in whites, 11% in Negroes); or it maybe increased to seven, resulting from the fusion of the first coccygeal and the last lumbar (4% in whites, 1. 5% in Negroes).

The indirect inguinal hernia can be summarized as follows:- It is the remains of the processus vaginalis and therefore is congenital in origin.- It is more common than a direct inguinal hernia.- It is much more common in males than females.- It is more common on the right side.- It is most common in children and young adults. The hernial sac enters the inguinal canal through the deep inguinal ring and lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels. The neck of the sac is narrow. The hernial sac may extend down into the scrotum or labium majus. A direct inguinal hernia can be summarized as follows: It is common in old men with weak abdominal muscles and is rare in women.

Duodenum lies opposite Ll, L2 and L3 veebrae. Duodenum is C-shaped curve which encloses the head of pancreas and is subdivided into four pas: 1. First pa (Superior pa): It is 5 cm (2 inches) long.

It is veical pa which begins at superior duodenal flexure and meet the third pa at inferior duodenal flexure. The interior of second pa of duodenum shows following features: i) Major duodenal papilla: It is present 8-10 cm distal to the pylorus. The hepatopancreatic ampulla or ampulla of Vater (joint pa of bile duct and pancreatic duct) opens here. ii) Minor duodenal papilla: It is present 6-8 cm distal to the pylorus.

        "exp": "The spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI) is a motor nerve (special visceral efferent) that innervates the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. The trapezius, a broad, flat, triangular muscle, has fibers in its superior pa that originate from the external occipital protuberance and the superior nuchal line, the ligamentum nuchae, and the spinous processes of veebrae C-7 through T-4. These upper fibers pass laterally to inse onto the acromion and the spine of the scapula. Activation of this pa of the muscle results in elevation of the point of the shoulder (acromion moves superiorly), as in shrugging. The muscles that promote movement of the arm away from the midline of the body include the deltoid, subscapularis, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles which are innervated by branches of the brachial plexus, not the spinal accessory nerve (CN XI). When there is damage to the spinal accessory nerve, they may also have difficulty elevating (abducting) the arm above a horizontal plane because the superior fibers of the trapezius, along with the serratus anterior, externally rotate the scapula about an anteroposterior axis, which is required for elevation of the arm beyond a horizontal plane. However, this is a question of \"magnitude\": loss of trapezius function would have greater effect on scapular elevation than rotation (i. e. serratus anterior is better able to compensate for loss of external rotation than levator scapulae can for elevation). The trapezius adducts the scapula, whereas the major arm adductors include the pectoralis major, teres major, latissimus dorsi, and coracobrachialis muscles. These muscles are innervated by branches of the brachial plexus. The muscles that act to laterally rotate the arm include the teres minor, infraspinatus, supraspinatus, and the dorsal poion of the deltoid muscles. These muscles are innervated by branches of the brachial plexus, not the spinal accessory nerve (CN XI). Ref: Ropper A. H., Samuels M. A. (2009). Chapter 47. Diseases of the Cranial Nerves. In A. H.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Popliteus Locking and Unlocking of knee joint. Locking is a mechanism that allows the knee to remain in the position of full extension as in standing without much muscular effo. Locking occurs as a result of medial rotation of the femur during the last stage of extension. The anteroposterior diameter of the lateral femoral condyle is less than that of the medial condyle. As a result, when the lateral condylar aicular surface is fully 'used up' by extension, pa of the medial condylar surface remains unused. At this stage the lateral condyle rotates backwards, i. e. medial rotation of the femur occurs, so that the remaining pa of the media condylar surface is also 'taken up'. This movement locks the knee joint. Locking is aided by the oblique pull of ligaments during the last stages of extension. When the knee is locked, it is completely rigid and all ligaments of the joint are taut. Locking is produced by continued action of the same muscles that produce extension, i. e. the quadriceps femoris, especially the vastus medialis pa. The locked knee joint can be flexed only after it is unlocked by a reversal of the medial rotation, i. e. by lateral rotation of the femur. Unlocking is brought about by the action of the popliteus muscle.",

It contains (passes) spermatic cord in males, round ligament in females and ilioinguinal nerve in both sexesQ Constituents of spermatic cord include vas (ductus) deferens, aery of ductus deferens with autonomic sympathetic nerves around it; testicular aery, lymphatics and vein (pampiniform plexus); cremasteric aery & genital branch of genitofemoral nerveQ supplying cremasteric muscle; and remains of processes vaginalis. Round ligament is 10-12 cm long flattened band that is attached medially to upper pa of uterus, run in upper pa of broad ligament, enter deep inguinal ring, traverse inguinal canal before terminating in mons pubis above the labium majus. It contains blood vessels, nerves & lymphaticsQ. The lymphatics drain the uterine region around the entery of uterine tube to the superficial inguinal lymph nodes. Remains of processus vaginalis (projection of peritoneum) is carried with the round ligament for a sho distance into the inguinal canal in the fetus but is mostly obliterated in adults. In the inguinal canal the round ligament receives the same (but thinner) coverings as the spermatic cord, although being thinner they blend with ligament and may not reach mons pubis. Genital branch of genitofemoral nerve enters the inguinal canal by deep ring and supplies cremaster muscle and skin of scrotum in males. In females, it accompanies the round ligament and ends in the skin of mons pubis & labium majusQ (sensory supply). Superficial inguinal ring is a triangular hiatus (opening) in external oblique aponeurosis, just above & lateral (i. e. suprolateral) to pubic crest (Gray's)/ to pubicle tubercleQ (Moore). Inferior epigastric vessels neither pass through deep or superficial inguinal rings nor does it travel through inguinal canalQ. However, inferior epigastric vessels are impoant posterior relations of medial end of inguinal canal.

It is directly continuous with the transverse sinus, and begins in the posterior compament of the jugular foramen, at the base of the skull. The thoracic duct on the left side and the right lymphatic duct on the right side open into the angle of union of the internal jugular and subclan veins. The external jugular vein: It is formed by the junction of the posterior division of the posterior facial with the posterior auricular vein. It commences in the substance of the parotid gland, on a level with the angle of the mandible.

Specific job functions of health assistant (male) includes collecting thick and thin smears from any fever case he come across and will administer presumptive treatment of prescribed dosage of antimalarial drugs. Health care system. The health care services' organization in the country extends from the national level to village level. At the national level it consists of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, which has three depaments, viz. - Depament of Health and Family Welfare, Depament of AYUSH and Depament of Health Research. One Community Health Center (CHC) has been established for every 80, 000 to 1, 20, 000 population, and this center provides the basic specialty services in general medicine, pediatrics, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology. CHCs are being established and maintained by the State Government. It is manned by four medical specialists i. e. Surgeon, Physician, Gynecologist and Pediatrician suppoed by 21 paramedical and other staff. It has 30 in-door beds with one OT, Xray, Labour Room and Laboratory facilities. It serves as a referral center for 4 PHCs. PHCs are the cornerstone of rural health services- a first po of call to a qualified doctor of the public sector in rural areas for the sick and those who directly repo or referred from Subcenters for curative, preventive and promotive health care. One Primary Health Center covers about 30, 000 (20, 000 in hilly, dese and difficult terrains) or more population. At present, a PHC is manned by a Medical Officer suppoed by 14 paramedical and other staff. It acts as a referral unit for 6 sub-centers and refer out cases to Community Health Centers (CHCs-30 bedded hospital)/ sub-district/ district hospitals. It has 4-6 indoor beds for patients. The Sub-center is the most peripheral and first contact point between the primary health care system and the community. Sub-centers are assigned tasks relating to interpersonal communication in order to bring about behavioral change and provide services in relation to maternal and child health, family welfare, nutrition, immunization, diarrhoea control and control of communicable diseases programmes. The Sub-centers are provided with basic drugs for minor ailments needed for taking care of essential health needs of men, women and children. Currently a Sub-center is staffed by one Female Health Worker commonly known as Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) and one Male Health Worker commonly known as Multi Purpose Worker (Male). One Health Assistant (Female) commonly known as Lady Health Visitor (LHV) and one Health Assistant (Male) located at the PHC level are entrusted with the task of supervision of all the Sub-centers (generally six sub centers) under a PHC. The overall objective of Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) is to provide health care that is quality oriented and sensitive to the needs of the community. In order to provide optimal level of quality health care, a set of standards are being recommended for Community Health Center /Primary Health Center/Sub center with reference to Infrastructure, Functioning and Staffing including responsibilities of each. The Medical Officer of Primary Health Center (PHC) is responsible for implementing all activities grouped under Health and Family Welfare delivery system in PHC area. He/she is responsible in his individual capacity, as well as over all in charge for his curative, preventive and promotive care of the patients. He will organize training programmes including continuing education for the staff and carry out all administrative activities required for smooth running of the PHC. The health assistant female will supervise, guide and train the Health Worker Female, Dais and ASHAs; and also visit each Sub-center at least once a week. The Health Assistant Male will strengthen the knowledge and skills of the health worker male and supervise and guide him in the delivery of health care service to the community; and visit each Health Worker Male at least once a week. They maintain records and carry out a team work at PHC. Health Worker Female (ANM) provides MCH care, Family planning, identify the women requiring help for MTP and identify cases of malnutrition among infants and young children and refer them. She will immunize pregnant women with tetanus toxoid, administer DPT, oral polio, measles and BCG vaccine to all infants and children, (Hepatitis-B in pilot areas) as per immunization schedule. Dai Training, identifying, notifying and referring various Communicable Diseases and recording the vital events are some of her impoant jobs. The Health worker Male will make a visit to each family once a fonight and performs the prescribed duties peaining to different National Health Programmes like NVBDCP, NLEP, RNTCP, UIP, National Blindness Control Programme and others. He will chlorinate the public water sources including wells at regular intervals and educate the community. A trained female community health worker - ASHA - is being provided in each village in the ratio of one per 1000 population. She must be a primary resident of the village with formal education upto Class VIII and preferably in the age group 25-45. She would be selected by the Gram Sabha and would be fully accountable to Panchayat. Though she would not be paid any honorarium, she would be entitled for performance based compensation. ASHAs would reinforce community action for universal immunization, safe delivery, newborn care, prevention of water-borne and other communicable diseases, nutrition and sanitation.",

        "exp": "Ans. D: Halibut liver oil Halibut liver oil is the richest source of vitamin D (and also vitamin A) Vitamin D It is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in very few foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is also produced endogenously when ultraviolet rays from sunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D obtained from sun exposure, food, and supplements is biologically ine and must undergo two hydroxylations in the body for activation. The first occurs in the liver and conves vitamin D to 25-hydroxyvitamin D, also known as calcidiol. The second occurs primarily in the kidney and forms the physiologically active 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D, also known as calcitriol. Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations to enable normal mineralization of bone and to prevent hypocalcemic tetany. It is also needed for bone growth and bone remodeling by osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Without sufficient vitamin D, bones can become thin, brittle, or misshapen. Vitamin D sufficiency prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Vitamin D has other roles in the body, including modulation of cell growth, neuromuscular and immune function, and reduction of inflammation. Serum concentration of 25(OH)D is the best indicator of vitamin D status. It reflects vitamin D produced cutaneously and that obtained from food and supplements and has a fairly long circulating half-life of 15 days. Serum 25(OH)D levels do not indicate the amount of vitamin D stored in body tissues. In contrast to 25(OH)D, circulating 1, 25(OH)2D is generally not a good indicator of vitamin D status because it has a sho half-life of 15 hours and serum concentrations are closely regulated by parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphate. Levels of 1, 25(OH)2D do not typically decrease until vitamin D deficiency is severe The flesh of fatty fish (such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel) and fish liver oils (Shark-30-100 microgram/ 100 gram; Cod-200-750 microgram/ 100 gram; Halibut-500-10, 000 microgram/ 100 gram) are among the best sources. Small amounts of vitamin D are found in beef liver, cheese, and egg yolks. Vitamin D in these foods is primarily in the form of vitamin D3 and its metabolite 25(OH)D3.",

Phenotypically, the patient appears female, but has a blindly ending vagina and lacks a uterus or other female internal reproductive organs. The patient has an XY genotype.

Seoli cells at this stage will secrete MIF, a substance that suppresses the paramesonephric ducts, preventing the formation of female internal reproductive organs. This patient would not have a streak ovary, a finding in Turner's syndrome that is associated with a 45, XO genotype. In fact, the patient would have testes, since the genetic complement contained a Y chromosome. The testes in individuals with testicular feminization syndrome are often undescended and are usually removed surgically. This patient would not possess a uterus or an oviduct.
