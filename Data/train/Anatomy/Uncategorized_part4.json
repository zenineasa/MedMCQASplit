Fluid also accumulates proximal to the block and distends the ventricles when the foramens of Luschka and Magendie are blocked or there is obstruction within the ventricular system (internal hydrocephalus, noncommunicating hydrocephalus).

Subacromial - subdeltoid bursa:- These are usually continuous with each other. It is one of the largest bursa of body. It separates coracoacromial arch and deltoid muscle from supraspinatus tendon and joint capsule. This bursa facilitates abduction and during this movement it moves beneath the acromion process. In subacromeal bursitis, pain is elicited when the deltoid is pressed just below the acromian process, the arm being in adducted position. When the arm is abducted to 90deg pain can not be elicited by pressure on the same point because bursa disappears under the acromian. This is called Dawbarn's sign. Subscapular bursa:- It lies between anterior capsule and subscapularis muscle. It is always in continuity with the joint cavity. Infraspinatus bursa:- It lies between posterior capsule and infraspinatus tendon. Sometimes, it may communicates with joint cavity.",

Health care system. The health care services' organization in the country extends from the national level to village level. At the national level it consists of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, which has three depaments, viz. - Depament of Health and Family Welfare, Depament of AYUSH and Depament of Health Research. One Community Health Center (CHC) has been established for every 80, 000 to 1, 20, 000 population, and this center provides the basic specialty services in general medicine, pediatrics, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology. CHCs are being established and maintained by the State Government. It is manned by four medical specialists i. e. Surgeon, Physician, Gynecologist and Pediatrician suppoed by 21 paramedical and other staff. It has 30 in-door beds with one OT, Xray, Labour Room and Laboratory facilities. It serves as a referral center for 4 PHCs. PHCs are the cornerstone of rural health services- a first po of call to a qualified doctor of the public sector in rural areas for the sick and those who directly repo or referred from Subcenters for curative, preventive and promotive health care. One Primary Health Center covers about 30, 000 (20, 000 in hilly, dese and difficult terrains) or more population. At present, a PHC is manned by a Medical Officer suppoed by 14 paramedical and other staff. It acts as a referral unit for 6 sub-centers and refer out cases to Community Health Centers (CHCs-30 bedded hospital)/ sub-district/ district hospitals. It has 4-6 indoor beds for patients. The Sub-center is the most peripheral and first contact point between the primary health care system and the community. Sub-centers are assigned tasks relating to interpersonal communication in order to bring about behavioral change and provide services in relation to maternal and child health, family welfare, nutrition, immunization, diarrhoea control and control of communicable diseases programmes. The Sub-centers are provided with basic drugs for minor ailments needed for taking care of essential health needs of men, women and children. Currently a Sub-center is staffed by one Female Health Worker commonly known as Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) and one Male Health Worker commonly known as Multi Purpose Worker (Male). One Health Assistant (Female) commonly known as Lady Health Visitor (LHV) and one Health Assistant (Male) located at the PHC level are entrusted with the task of supervision of all the Sub-centers (generally six sub centers) under a PHC. The overall objective of Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) is to provide health care that is quality oriented and sensitive to the needs of the community. In order to provide optimal level of quality health care, a set of standards are being recommended for Community Health Center /Primary Health Center/Sub center with reference to Infrastructure, Functioning and Staffing including responsibilities of each. The Medical Officer of Primary Health Center (PHC) is responsible for implementing all activities grouped under Health and Family Welfare delivery system in PHC area. He/she is responsible in his individual capacity, as well as over all in charge for his curative, preventive and promotive care of the patients. He will organize training programmes including continuing education for the staff and carry out all administrative activities required for smooth running of the PHC. The health assistant female will supervise, guide and train the Health Worker Female, Dais and ASHAs; and also visit each Sub-center at least once a week. The Health Assistant Male will strengthen the knowledge and skills of the health worker male and supervise and guide him in the delivery of health care service to the community; and visit each Health Worker Male at least once a week. They maintain records and carry out a team work at PHC. Health Worker Female (ANM) provides MCH care, Family planning, identify the women requiring help for MTP and identify cases of malnutrition among infants and young children and refer them. She will immunize pregnant women with tetanus toxoid, administer DPT, oral polio, measles and BCG vaccine to all infants and children, (Hepatitis-B in pilot areas) as per immunization schedule. Dai Training, identifying, notifying and referring various Communicable Diseases and recording the vital events are some of her impoant jobs. The Health worker Male will make a visit to each family once a fonight and performs the prescribed duties peaining to different National Health Programmes like NVBDCP, NLEP, RNTCP, UIP, National Blindness Control Programme and others. He will chlorinate the public water sources including wells at regular intervals and educate the community. A trained female community health worker - ASHA - is being provided in each village in the ratio of one per 1000 population. She must be a primary resident of the village with formal education upto Class VIII and preferably in the age group 25-45. She would be selected by the Gram Sabha and would be fully accountable to Panchayat. Though she would not be paid any honorarium, she would be entitled for performance based compensation. ASHAs would reinforce community action for universal immunization, safe delivery, newborn care, prevention of water-borne and other communicable diseases, nutrition and sanitation.",

Functions to open the glottis by rotary motion on the arytenoid cailages. Also tenses cords during phonation. 2. Lateral cricoarytenoid functions to close glottis by rotating arytenoids medially. 3. Transverse arytenoid only unpaired muscle of the larynx. Functions to approximate bodies of arytenoids closing posterior aspect of glottis. 4. Oblique arytenoid this muscle plus action of transverse arytenoid function to close laryngeal introitus during swallowing. 5. Thyroarytenoid - very broad muscle, usually divided into three pas: Thyroarytenoideus internus (vocalis) - adductor and major tensor of free edge of vocal fold. Thyroarytenoideus externus - major adductor of vocal fold. Thyroepiglotticus - shoens vocal ligaments.

The nerve ascends alongside the spinal cord and enters the skull through the foramen magnum. It then turns laterally to join the cranial root. The two roots unite and leave the skull through the jugular foramen. The roots then separate: The cranial root joins the vagus nerves and is distributed in its branches to the muscles of the soft palate and pharynx ( the pharyngeal plexus) and to the muscles of the larynx (except the cricothyroid muscle). The spinal root runs downward and laterally and enters the deep surface of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which it supplies, and then crosses the posterior triangle of the neck to supply the trapezius muscle. The accessory nerve thus brings about movements of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx and controls the movements of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Diffusion Oxygen is transferred from the alveoli to the pulmonary capillaries by the process of diffusion. The diffusion occurs across the respiratory membrane. As oxygen diffuses into the blood, it combines with hemoglobin. However, the oxygen, in combination with hemoglobin, does not contribute to the PO2 of blood. Therefore the alveolar - capillary gradient of PO2 is maintained much longer than it would be if hemoglobin were not present. The sequence mey be visualized as follows:- i) Oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the plasma due to the PO2 gradient. ii) To sta with, the PO2 in the RBC fluids is the same as in the plasma. As soon as diffusion from the alveoli to plasma raises the PO2 of plasma above that of the RBC fluids, oxygen diffuses from the plasma into the RBC. iii) As soon as oxygen enters the RBC, it combines with hemoglobin, which mops up oxygen but does not let PO2 rise. The process continues till hemoglobin cannot pick up any more oxygen. iv) Then the PO2 in the RBC fluids rises to equal that in the plasma and diffusion from the plasma to RBC stops. v) After that the PO2 in the plasma also rises to equal that in the alveoli, and consequently diffusion from the alveoli to the plasma stops. Thus, the presence of hemoglobin makes an enormous difference to the amount of oxygen transferred. By mopping up oxygen without letting the PO2 rise, it lets the diffusion of oxygen continue much longer. While the PO2 gradient determines the direction of diffusion of oxygen, it is actually hemoglobin that lays the trap for carrying large amounts of oxygen in the blood.",

(\"q\" refers to the French word \"queue\" meaning 'tail'). Metacentric: A chromosome is metacentric if its two arms are roughly equal in length. In some cases, a metacentric chromosome is formed by balanced Robesonian translocation: the fusion of two acrocentric chromosomes to form one metacentric chromosome. Example 1, 3, 16, 19, 20. Submetacentric: If arms' lengths are unequal, the chromosome is said to be Submetacentric. Example-X chromosome, 2, 4, 12, 17, 18. Acrocentric: If the p (sho) arm is so sho that is hard to observe, but still present, then the chromosome is acrocentric (The \"acro-\" in acrocentric refers to the Greek word for \"peak\"). The human genome includes acrocentric Y-chromosomes, 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22. Telocentric: A telocentric chromosome's centromere is",

When the physician passively moves the patient's right great toe upward or downward, the patient cannot accurately repo the direction of motion, although his perception of light touch and painful stimuli is unimpaired. This finding can best be explained by a lesion of which of the following structures?",
        "exp": "The patient's inability to detect the position of his toe reflects a lack of conscious proprioception for this pa of his body. Conscious proprioception, discriminative touch, and vibration sense are all carried by the dorsal column/medial lemniscus system. The fact that he can still perceive light touch and painful stimuli indicates that his anterolateral system is unimpaired. In the dorsal column/medial lemniscus system, the primary neuron's cell body is located in the dorsal root ganglia and sends its projection to the cord through the dorsal roots. The fibers do not synapse in the cord, but rather ascend the cord in the dorsal columns. Fibers carrying information from the legs ascend in the fasciculus gracilis; those receiving input from the arms project in the fasciculus cuneatus. Both ascend to the caudal medulla, where they terminate in the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus, respectively. The secondary neurons originating from these nuclei cross as the internal arcuate fibers, ascend as the medial lemniscus, then synapse in the ventroposterolateral (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus. Teiary neurons from the VPL project to the ipsilateral somatosensory coex. Therefore, a lack of conscious proprioception from the right toe could result from lesions to the right fasciculus gracilis, the right nucleus gracilis, the left medial lemniscus, the left VPL, or left somatosensory coex. The right fasciculus cuneatus carries discriminative touch, proprioception, and vibration information from the upper extremities. The right lateral lemniscus, pa of the auditory system, receives input from the contralateral cochlear nuclei and from the superior olivary nuclei, and projects to the inferior colliculus. The right medial lemniscus carries discriminative touch, proprioception, and vibration information from the left side of the body. Ref: Waxman S. G. (2010). Chapter 5. The Spinal Cord. In S. G.

The central and peripheral zones of the prostate are not as close to the urethra. If they enlarged, they would not restrict the flow of urine quite as much. The ejaculatory duct is the duct formed once the ductus deferens joins with the duct of the seminal vesicle. It passes through the prostate gland, but its enlargement would have no effect on the prostate or the urethra. Ref: La Rochelle J., Shuch B., Belldegrun A. (2010). Chapter 40. Urology. In F. C.
