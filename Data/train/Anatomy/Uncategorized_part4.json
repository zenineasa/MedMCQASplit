Costoclavicular ligament connects the clavicle to the upper surface of the first rib and its cailage. This ligament is very strong and is the major stabilizing factor of the sternoclavicular joint. The Coracoacromial Ligament is a strong ligament, extending between the coracoid process and the acromion. This ligament, together with the coracoid process and the acromion, forms the coracoacromial arch which prevents upward dislocation of the humerus. It extends between two processes of the scapula and takes no pa in transmission of weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton.",

When the primitive streak appears, fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) is secreted by cells in the node and primitive streak and induces expression of Nodal but only on the left side of the embryo. Later, as the neural plate is induced, FGF8 maintains Nodal expression in the lateral plate mesoderm, as well as LEFTY-2, and both of these genes up-regulate PITX2. PITX2 is a homeobox-containing transcription factor responsible for establishing left-sidedness. Also, it is expressed on the left side of the heart, stomach, and gut primordia, and, if expressed ectopically, it results in laterality defects. Simultaneously, LEFTY is expressed on the left side of the floor plate of the neural tube and may act as a barrier to prevent left-sided signals from crossing over. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) may also function in this role as well as serving as a repressor for left-sided gene expression on the right. Ref: Langman's embryology 11th edition Chapter 35.",

The iliohypogastric nerve innervates the abdominal wall. It runs between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles, then pierces the internal oblique at the anterior superior iliac spine to run between the internal and external obliques. The ovarian aery and vein are branches from the descending aoa and inferior vena cava which supply the ovary in the pelvis. The pectineal ligament is a thick layer of fascia over the pectineal line of the pubis. Although the pectineal ligament helps define the boundaries of the inguinal canal, you can't really say that the pectineal ligament traverses the canal.

Pituitary gland lies within hypophyseal/pituitary fossa or sella turcica of sphenoid bone which is roofed by diaphragm sellae.

It is related anterosuperiorly to optic chiasma, laterally to cavernous sinus and inferiorly to sphenoid air sinuses in the body of sphenoid. Pituitary gland is oval in shape, measures 8 x12 mm, and weighs about 500 mg. Pituitary gland has two main subdivisions:- (i) Adenohypophysis (anterior lobe), and (ii) Neurohypophysis (posterior lobe). Adenohypophysis (anterior lobe) include:- (i) pars anterior or pars distalis or pars glandularis or anterior lobe proper, (ii) pars intermedia (intermediate lobe); and (iii) tuberal lobe (pars tuberalis).

Neurohypophysis (posterior lobe) include (i) pars posterior or pars nervosa or neural lobe or posterior lobe proper; (ii) infundibulum (infundibular stem); and (iii) median eminence. It develops from a downgrowth from the 3' ventricle/diencephalon (neuroectoderm) called infundibulum. Anterior lobe contains many hormone secreting cells: chromophils (acidophils, basophils), chromophobes and follicullostellate cells. Posterior pituitary contain neuroglia like pituicytes which do not secrete any hormone.

The average testicular dimensions are 5 cm (length), 25 cm (breath), 3cm (anteroposterior diameter or thickness) and 10. 5-14 gms (weight). The epididymis is attached to is posterolateral surface. Vas (ductus) deference arises from lower pole of epididymis. Lateral pa of epididymis is separated from testis by an extension of cavity of tunica vaginalis, called sinus of epididymis. There is small oval body attached to upper pole of testis called appendix of testis, a remnant of paramesonephric duct. Testis is covered by three coats (from outside to inside):- (i) tunica vaginalis (which has a parietal and a visceral layer); (ii) tunica albuginea; and (iii) tunica vasculosa. Outside these three coats, there are layers of scrotum. Structure. Testis consists of 200-300 lobules. Each lobules consists of 2-3 seminiferous tubules (where spermatozoa are formed). Seminiferous tubules join at the apex of lobules to form straight tubules, which anastomose with each other to form rete testis. Which emerge from upper pole and enter the epididymis. Each tubule becomes highly coiled to form a lobe of the head of epididymis. All tubules end in a single duct which is coiled on itself to form the body and tail of the epididymis. It is continuous with ductus deference. Aerial supply. Testes are supplied by testticular aery, a branch of abdominal aoa, arises at L2 veebral level. Venous drainage. The veins emerging from the testis and epididymis form the pampiniform plexus. Anterior pa of the plexus is arranged around the testicular aery, middle pa around ductus deferens and its aery, and posterior pa is isolated. The plexus condenses into 4 veins at the superficial inguinal ring and 2 veins at the deep inguinal ring. Ultimately, one vein is formed which drains into inferior vena cava on the right and into left renal vein on the left side. Lymphatic drainage. Lymphatics from the testis run back with the testicular aery to para-aoic nodes along side the aoa at the level of origin of testicular aeries (L2 veebra).",

On either side of this groove are the raised neural folds. These neural folds then begin to fuse in the midline at approximately the midpoint of the neural plate. Fusion proceeds in a rostral and caudal direction; once completed, there still remains an open area of the \"tube\" at both the rostral and caudal ends. These openings are referred to as the rostral and the caudal neuropore. The rostral neuropore closes around day 26 and the caudal neuropore closes on approximately day 28. With the closure of the caudal neuropore, closure of the neural tube is completed. It has been convincingly shown that folic acid plays an impoant role in the closure of the neural tube. By giving women of childbearing age folic acid supplements, the rate of neural tube defects can be reduced dramatically. Yet, based on the embryology of the neural tube (with closure of the tube roughly by day 28), it is obvious that in order for folic acid supplementation to work, it should be staed pregestationally. Unfounately, most women do not seek prenatal care until after the neural tube has undergone its period of closure. Bone, muscle, and spleen are all derivatives of the mesoderm. This mesoderm is formed at the end of the second week post-feilization, when some cells of the primitive streak migrate laterally between the endodermal and the ectodermal layer.

Failure of a lateral palatine process to fuse with the median palatine process, which is synonymous with a failure of the primary palate to fuse with the secondary palate, results in a primary cleft palate. Primary clefts of the palate are found anterior to the incisive foramen of the palate. Primary cleft palates may occur along with cleft lips but are the result of a separate developmental defect. Failure of the right and left medial nasal prominences to merge results in a median cleft lip. This is a rare anomaly.

If the sciatic nerve was completely paralyzed, the compaments innervated by its two branches: the common fibular and tibial nerves, would lose function. This would mean that the hamstrings and all the muscles of below the knee would lose their innervation. (Luckily, complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve is very rare). The hip joint is very stable, so it is difficult to dislocate the femur. Most dislocations occur when the hip is flexed and the thigh is adducted. In flexion, the joint capsule is lax, and the femoral head tends to dislocate posteriorly when forces drive the femur posteriorly. This means that the sciatic nerve will be very vulnerable when the femur is dislocated! The other nerves listed in the question are not closely related to the hip joint. The femoral nerve innervates the quadriceps and is on the anterior of the thigh. The lumbosacral trunk is located in the pelvis. The obturator nerve innervates the adductor compament, and is on the anteromedial side of the thigh.

Hemorrhage occurs into the muscle and may be detected as a small, rounded during the early weeks after bih. Later, this becomes invaded by fibrous tissue, which contracts and shoens the muscle. The mastoid process is thus pulled down toward the sternoclavicular joint of the same side, the cervical spine is flexed, and the face looks upward to the opposite side. If left untreated, asymmetrical growth changes occur in the face, and the cervical veebrae may become wedge shaped. Spasmodic Toicollis. Spasmodic toicollis, which results from repeated chronic contractions of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, is usually psychogenic in origin.

Urinary bladder: is a musculomembranous sac which acts as a reservoir for the urine, lies posterior to pubic bones and pubic symphysis. When empty is tetrahedron in shape and lies entirely within true pelvic cavity; spherical when full and may reach as high as umbilicus. When empty has a base (posterior surface) and a superior and two inferolateral surfaces. Base (posterior surface) of bladder defined internally by two ureteric openings at superolateral corners and internal urethral opening inferiorly. Neck of bladder is where base and inferolateral sides meet, inferiorly. Anterior angle or apex is site of attachment of urachus (fibrous remnant of fetal allantois) which is seen as the median umbilical ligament on the anterior abdominal wall. Trigone: Triangular area defined by these opening is the vesicle trigone. The Uvula Vesicae, a small pointed production terminating the trigone in front, and formed by a projection of the medial lobe of the prostate gland into the cavity of the bladder. Ridge between two urethral openings is the interureteric fold. Muscles: Bladder wall is composed of a thick layer of interwoven bundles of smooth muscle running transversely, longitudinally, and obliquely (detrusor muscle). In region of neck, detrusor muscle runs circularly as involuntary internal sphincter. Bladder mucosa is thrown into rugae except within trigone, which is smooth. Aeries: Superior vesical aeries (branches of internal iliac aery) supply apex and superior pa of bladder. Inferior vesical aeries supply fundus and neck in males. Vaginal aeries (branches of uterine aeries) supply fundus and neck in females. Obturator aeries (branches of internal iliac aery) provide aerial twigs.

Deep inguinal ring is oval or circular orifice in transversalis fascia (posterior wall of inguinal canal) 1. 25 cm above mid inguinal point. It is larger in male. Inferior epigastric vessels run upward and medially along the medial margin of deep inguinal ring. Indirect inguinal hernia enters inguinal canal through it. Superficial inguinal ring is a triangular apeure in the external oblique aponeurosis. Base is formed by pubic crests margins are known as crura. Lateral crus is stronger and is formed by medial end of inguinal ligament. Center of the ring is above and medial to pubic tubercle. It is larger in males.",
