        "exp": "Coracoacromial ligament The weight of the upper limb is transmitted from the scapula to the clavicle through the acromioclavicular joint and from the clavicle to the axial skeleton through the sternoclavicular joint. Thus the ligaments maintaining the stability of these two joints transmit the weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton. Acromioclavicular joint Acromioclavicular joint is formed by aiculation between the lateral end of the clavicle and the medial margin of the acromial process of the scapula. Ligaments stabilizing the joint are: - Acromioclavicular ligament - Coracoclavicular ligament (this is the major ligament transmitting upper limb weight to the clavicle) Sternoclavicular joint Sternoclavicular joint is the only skeletal aiculation between the upper limb and the axial skeleton. It is a compound joint with 3 elements taking pa in the joint: 1) medial end of the clavicle 2) the clavicular notch of the manubrium sterni and 3) first costal cailage The ligaments of the joint are: - the anterior and posterior sternoclavicular ligaments , - the costoclavicular ligaments on each side, _ and the midline interclavicular ligament. The interclavicular ligament passes between the sterna ends of the right and left clavicles, with some of the fibres attached to the upper border of the manubrium sterni. Costoclavicular ligament connects the clavicle to the upper surface of the first rib and its cailage. This ligament is very strong and is the major stabilizing factor of the sternoclavicular joint. The Coracoacromial Ligament is a strong ligament, extending between the coracoid process and the acromion. This ligament, together with the coracoid process and the acromion, forms the coracoacromial arch which prevents upward dislocation of the humerus. It extends between two processes of the scapula and takes no pa in transmission of weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton.",

The cells demonstrate metachromasia of the cytoplasm when stained with Giemsa stain. Which of the following products would these cells be most likely to secrete?",
        "exp": "The cells in question are mast cells, which play an impoant role in IgE-mediated allergic responses. They are a normal (minor) constituent of dermal skin and are most definitely identified with stains, such as the Giemsa stain, that highlight the granularity of their cytoplasm (mast cells are closely related to blood basophils). Mast cells secrete histamine, serotonin, many leukotrienes, and platelet aggregating factor (PAF). Their histamine secretion after IgE stimulation helps to trigger the acute inflammatory pa of the allergic response. Bradykinin is a nonapeptide found in the plasma. It is a potent vasodilator and stimulates pain receptors. Complement factor 3a is a plasma protein that induces vascular leakage as pa of the acute inflammatory response. Interleukin 2 is secreted by lymphocytes and augments the immune response. Ref: Mescher A.L. (2013). Chapter 5. Connective Tissue. In A.L. Mescher (Ed),Junqueira's Basic Histology, 13e.",

Later, as the neural plate is induced, FGF8 maintains Nodal expression in the lateral plate mesoderm, as well as LEFTY-2, and both of these genes up-regulate PITX2. PITX2 is a homeobox-containing transcription factor responsible for establishing left-sidedness. Also, it is expressed on the left side of the hea, stomach, and gut primordia, and, if expressed ectopically, it results in laterality defects. Simultaneously, LEFTY is expressed on the left side of the floor plate of the neural tube and may act as a barrier to prevent left-sided signals from crossing over. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) may also function in this role as well as serving as a repressor for left-sided gene expression on the right. Ref: Langman's embryology 11th edition Chapter 35.",

The iliohypogastric nerve innervates the abdominal wall. It runs between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles, then pierces the internal oblique at the anterior superior iliac spine to run between the internal and external obliques. The ovarian aery and vein are branches from the descending aoa and inferior vena cava which supply the ovary in the pelvis. The pectineal ligament is a thick layer of fascia over the pectineal line of the pubis. Although the pectineal ligament helps define the boundaries of the inguinal canal, you can't really say that the pectineal ligament traverses the canal.

It is related anterosuperiorly to optic chiasma, laterally to cavernous sinus and inferiorly to sphenoid air sinuses in the body of sphenoid. Pituitary gland is oval in shape, measures 8 x12 mm, and weighs about 500 mg. Pituitary gland has two main subdivisions:- (i) Adenohypophysis (anterior lobe), and (ii) Neurohypophysis (posterior lobe).Adenohypophysis (anterior lobe) include :- (i) pars anterior or pars distalis or pars glandularis or anterior lobe proper, (ii) pars intermedia (intermediate lobe); and (iii) tuberal lobe (pars tuberalis). It develops from an upward growth (Rathke's pouch) from the ectodermal roof of stomodeum.Neurohypophysis (posterior lobe) include (i) pars posterior or pars nervosa or neural lobe or posterior lobe proper; (ii) infundibulum (infundibular stem); and (iii) median eminence. It develops from a downgrowth from the 3' ventricle/diencephalon (neuroectoderm) called infundibulum.Anterior lobe contains many hormone secreting cells: chromophils (acidophils, basophils), chromophobes and follicullostellate cells. Posterior pituitary contain neuroglia like pituicytes which do not secrete any hormone.

About the middle of the length of the urethral crest, the colliculus seminalis (or verumontanum) forms an elevation. Ref: Textbook of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia By Roger S. Kirby, John M.

Outside these three coats, there are layers of scrotum. StructureTestis consists of 200-300 lobules.Each lobules consists of 2-3 seminiferous tubules (where spermatozoa are formed).Seminiferous tubules join at the apex of lobules to form straight tubules, which anastomose with each other to form rete testis.Which emerge from upper pole and enter the epididymis. Each tubule becomes highly coiled to form a lobe of the head of epididymis.All tubules end in a single duct which is coiled on itself to form the body and tail of the epididymis. It is continuous with ductus deference.Aerial supplyTestes are supplied by testticular aery, a branch of abdominal aoa, arises at L2 veebral level. Venous drainageThe veins emerging from the testis and epididymis form the pampiniform plexus.Anterior pa of the plexus is arranged around the testicular aery, middle pa around ductus deferens and its aery, and posterior pa is isolated.The plexus condenses into 4 veins at the superficial inguinal ring and 2 veins at the deep inguinal ring. Ultimately, one vein is formed which drains into inferior vena cava on the right and into left renal vein on the left side.Lymphatic drainageLymphatics from the testis run back with the testicular aery to para-aoic nodes along side the aoa at the level of origin of testicular aeries (L2 veebra).",

        "question": "Which of the following is a derivative of the ectoderm of the trilaminar embryo?",
        "exp": "The neural plate, a thickened area of ectoderm, gives rise to the nervous system. The first step is the development of a groove in the neural plate. On either side of this groove are the raised neural folds. These neural folds then begin to fuse in the midline at approximately the midpoint of the neural plate. Fusion proceeds in a rostral and caudal direction; once completed, there still remains an open area of the \"tube\" at both the rostral and caudal ends. These openings are referred to as the rostral and the caudal neuropore. The rostral neuropore closes around day 26 and the caudal neuropore closes on approximately day 28. With the closure of the caudal neuropore, closure of the neural tube is completed. It has been convincingly shown that folic acid plays an impoant role in the closure of the neural tube. By giving women of childbearing age folic acid supplements, the rate of neural tube defects can be reduced dramatically. Yet, based on the embryology of the neural tube (with closure of the tube roughly by day 28), it is obvious that in order for folic acid supplementation to work, it should be staed pregestationally. Unfounately, most women do not seek prenatal care until after the neural tube has undergone its period of closure. Bone, muscle, and spleen are all derivatives of the mesoderm. This mesoderm is formed at the end of the second week post-feilization, when some cells of the primitive streak migrate laterally between the endodermal and the ectodermal layer. Germ cells are derived from the endodermal layer of the trilaminar embryo. They migrate as primordial sex cells from the endoderm of the yolk sac to the urogenital ridge.",

Primary clefts of the palate are found anterior to the incisive foramen of the palate.

In the orbit, the aery pierces the dura mater, ascends over the lateral side of the optic nerve, and crosses above the nerve from lateral to medial side along with the nasociliary nerve. It then runs forwards along the medial wall of the orbit between the superior oblique and the medial rectus muscles, and parallel to the nasociliary nerve. It terminates near the medial angle of the eye by dividing into the supratrochlear and dorsal nasal branches. Branches Ophthalmic aery gives following branches : 1. Central aery of retina. 2.

If the sciatic nerve was completely paralyzed, the compaments innervated by its two branches: the common fibular and tibial nerves, would lose function. This would mean that the hamstrings and all the muscles of below the knee would lose their innervation. (Luckily, complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve is very rare). The hip joint is very stable, so it is difficult to dislocate the femur. Most dislocations occur when the hip is flexed and the thigh is adducted. In flexion, the joint capsule is lax, and the femoral head tends to dislocate posteriorly when forces drive the femur posteriorly. This means that the sciatic nerve will be very vulnerable when the femur is dislocated!The other nerves listed in the question are not closely related to the hip joint. The femoral nerve innervates the quadriceps and is on the anterior of the thigh. The lumbosacral trunk is located in the pelvis. The obturator nerve innervates the adductor compament, and is on the anteromedial side of the thigh. Although the superior gluteal nerve innervates muscles near the hip socket (gluteus medius, minimus, and tensor fasciae latae), it would not be damaged by a dislocated hip.",

They drain blood from the posterior pas of the intercostal spaces, the posterior abdominal wall, the pericardium, the diaphragm, the bronchi, and the esophagus. Azygos vein is often formed by the union of the right ascending lumbar vein and the right subcostal vein. It ascends through the aoic opening in the diaphragm on the right side of the aoa to the level of the fifth thoracic veebra.

When empty has a base (posterior surface) and a superior and two inferolateral surfaces. Base (posterior surface) of bladder defined internally by two ureteric openings at superolateral corners and internal urethral opening inferiorly. Neck of bladder is where base and inferolateral sides meet, inferiorly. Anterior angle or apex is site of attachment of urachus (fibrous remnant of fetal allantois) which is seen as the median umbilical ligament on the anterior abdominal wall. Trigone: Triangular area defined by these opening is the vesicle trigone. The Uvula Vesicae, a small pointed production terminating the trigone in front, and formed by a projection of the medial lobe of the prostate gland into the cavity of the bladder. Ridge between two urethral openings is the interureteric fold. Muscles: Bladder wall is composed of a thick layer of interwoven bundles of smooth muscle running transversely, longitudinally, and obliquely (detrusor muscle). In region of neck, detrusor muscle runs circularly as involuntary internal sphincter. Bladder mucosa is thrown into rugae except within trigone, which is smooth.
