These tumors are designated endome- trioid because of their histologic similarity to normal endometrial glands. Risk factors for this type of carcinoma include (1) obesity, (2) diabetes, (3) hypertension, (4) infeil- ity, and (5) exposure to unopposed estrogen. Many of these risk factors result in increased estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium and are associated with endometrial hyperpla- sia. In fact, it is well recognized that prolonged estrogen replacement therapy and estrogen-secreting ovarian tumors increase the risk of endometrioid type of endometrial carci- noma. Additionally, breast carcinoma (which also is estrogen- dependent) occurs in women with endometrial cancer (and vice versa) more frequently than by chance alone. Muta- tions in mismatch repair genes and the tumor sup- pressor gene PTEN are early events in the stepwise development of endometrioid carcinoma. Women with germline mutations in PTEN (Cowden syndrome) are at high risk for this cancer. TP53 mutations occur but are rela- tively uncommon and are believed to be late events in the genesis of this tumor type. The serous type of endometrial carcinoma is much less common, accounting for roughly 15% of tumors. Nearly all cases have mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, whereas mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes and PTEN are rare.",

Such chemical states are extremely unstable, and free radicals readily react with inorganic and organic chemicals; when generated in cells, they avidly attack nucleic acids as well as a variety of cel- lular proteins and lipids. In addition, free radicals initiate reactions in which molecules that react with free radicals are themselves conveed into other types of free radicals, thereby propagating the chain of damage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a type of oxygen- derived free radical whose role in cell injury is well estab- lished. Cell injury in many circumstances involves damage by free radicals; these situations include ischemia- reperfusion (discussed later on), chemical and radiation injury, toxicity from oxygen and other gases, cellular aging, microbial killing by phagocytic cells, and tissue injury caused by inflammatory cells. There are different types of ROS, and they are produced by two major pathways (Fig. 1-18). * ROS are produced normally in small amounts in all cells during the reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions that occur during mitochondrial respiration and energy genera- tion. In this process, molecular oxygen is sequentially reduced in mitochondria by the addition of four elec- trons to generate water. This reaction is imperfect, however, and small amounts of highly reactive but sho-lived toxic intermediates are generated when oxygen is only paially reduced. These intermediates include superoxide (O2 * ), which is conveed to hydro- gen peroxide (H2. O2) spontaneously and by the action of the enzyme superoxide dismutase. H2. O2 is more stable than O2 * and can cross biologic membranes. In the pres- ence of metals, such as Fe2+, H2. O2 is conveed to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical * OH by the Fenton reaction",

The TCR complex and CD4 each bind to distinct regions of the antigen-presenting MHCII molecule - a1/b1 and b2, respectively. In CD4 the interaction involves its extracellular D1 domain. The resulting close proximity between the TCR complex and CD4 (extracellular and intracellular) allows the tyrosine kinase Lck bound to the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 to tyrosine-phosphorylate the Immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs (ITAM) on the cytoplasmic domains of CD3 to amplify the signal generated by the TCR. Lck is essential for the activation of many molecular components of the signaling cascade of an activated T cell. Depending on the signal, different types of T helper cells result. Phosphorylated ITAM motifs on CD3 recruit and activate SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) such as Zap70 to fuher mediate downstream signalling through tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to transcription factor activation including NF-kB and consequent T cell activation.",

Finer variations form the basis of the subdivisions into Brodmann's areas. Other workers divide the coex into five broad varieties. These are as follows. In the agranular coex the external and internal granular laminae are inconspicuous. This type of coex is seen most typically in the precentral gyrus (area 4) and is, therefore, believed to be typical of 'motor' areas. It is also seen in some other areas. In the granular coex the granular layers are highly developed while the pyramidal and ganglionic layers are poorly developed or absent. In the visual area the external band of Baillarger is prominent and forms a white line that can be seen with the naked eye when the region is freshly cut across. This stria of Gennari gives the name striate coex to the visual coex. Between the two extremes represented by the agranular and granular varieties of coex, three intermediate types are described as follows. Frontal coex Parietal coex and Polar coex. The frontal type is nearest to the agranular coex, the pyramidal cells being prominent, while the polar type is nearest to the granular coex.

Paicularly in the latter two patterns, it may be difficult to radiologically distinguish regenerative cirrhotic nodules from neoplasms of similar size. Discrete tumor masses usually are yellow- white, punctuated sometimes by bile staining and areas of hemorrhage or necrosis. HCC has a strong propensity for vascular invasion. Extensive intrahepatic metastases are characteristic, and occasionally snakelike masses of tumor invade the poal vein (with occlusion of the poal circula- tion) or inferior vena cava, extending even into the right side of the hea. On histologic examination, HCCs range from well- differentiated lesions that reproduce hepatocytes arranged in cords, trabeculae or glandular patterns (Fig. 15-34), to poorly differentiated lesions, often composed of large, multinucleate anaplastic giant cells. In the better-differentiated vari- ants, globules of bile may be found within the cyto- plasm of cells and in pseudocanaliculi between cells. Acidophilic hyaline inclusions within the cytoplasm may be present, resembling Mallory bodies. There is little stroma in most hepatocellular carcinomas, explaining their soft consistency. A distinctive clinicopathologic variant of HCC is the fibrolamellar carcinoma. It occurs in young male and female adults (20 to 40 years of age) with equal incidence and has no association with cirrhosis or other risk factors. It usually consists of a single tumor with fibrous bands coursing through it, superficially resembling focal nodular hyperplasia. The fibrolamellar variant has a better prognosis than that of the other, more common variants.",

        "question": "Characteristics of SLE of kidney is",
        "exp": "Ref Robbins 9/e p224 Kidneys. Kidney involvement is one of the most impoant clinical features of SLE, with renal failure being the most common cause of death. The focus here is on glomerular pathology, although interstitial and tubular lesions are also seen in SLE. The pathogenesis of all forms of glomerulonephritis in SLE involves deposition of DNA-anti-DNA complexes within the glomeruli. These evoke an inflammatory response that may cause proliferation of the endothelial, mesangial, and/or epithelial cells and, in severe cases, necrosis of the glomeruli. Although the kidney appears normal by light microscopy in 25% to 30% of cases, almost all cases of SLE show some renal abnormality if examined by immuno- fluorescence and electron microscopy. According to the current International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathol- ogy Society morphologic classification, there are six patterns of glomerular disease in SLE (none of which is specific to the disease): class I, minimal mesangial lupus nephritis; class II, mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis; class III, focal lupus nephritis; class IV, diffuse lupus nephritis; class V, membra- nous lupus nephritis; and class VI, advanced sclerosing lupus nephritis. * Minimal mesangial lupus nephritis (class I) is rarely encountered in renal biopsies. Immune complexes are present in the mesangium, but there are no concomitant structural alterations detectable by light microscopy. * Mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis (class II) is seen in 10% to 25% of cases and is associated with mild clinical symptoms. Immune complexes deposit in the mesangium, with a mild to moderate increase in the mesangial matrix and cellularity. * Focal lupus nephritis (class III) is seen in 20% to 35% of cases. Lesions are visualized in fewer than half the glomeruli, and they may be segmentally or globally distrib- uted within each glomerulus. Active lesions are character- ized by swelling and proliferation of endothelial and mesangial cells, infiltration by neutrophils, and/or fibrinoid deposits with capillary thrombi (Fig. 4-18, A). The clinical presentation may range from only mild microscopic hema- turia and proteinuria to a more active urinary sediment with red blood cell casts and acute, severe renal insufficiency. * Diffuse lupus nephritis (class IV) is the most serious form of renal lesions in SLE and is also the most commonly encountered in renal biopsies, occurring in 35% to 60% of patients. It is distinguished from focal lupus nephritis (class III) by involvement of half or more of glomeruli. Most of the glomeruli show endothelial and mesangial prolifera- tion, leading to diffuse hypercellularity of these structures (Fig. 4-18, B) and producing in some cases epithelial crescents that fill Bowman's space. When extensive, sub- endothelial immune complexes create a circumferential thickening of the capillary wall, resembling rigid \"wire loops\" on routine light microscopy (Fig. 4-18, C). Electron microscopy reveals prominent electron-dense subendo- thelial immune complexes (between endothelium and basement membrane) (Fig. 4-18, D), but immune com- plexes are also usually present in other pas of the capil- lary wall and in the mesangium. Immune complexes can be visualized by staining with fluorescent antibodies directed against immunoglobulins or complement, result- ing in a granular fluorescent staining pattern (Fig. 4-18, E). In due course, glomerular injury may give rise to scarring (glomerulosclerosis). Most affected patients have hematu- ria with moderate to severe proteinuria, hypertension, and renal insufficiency. * Membranous lupus nephritis (class V) occurs in 10% to 15% of cases and is the designation for glomerular disease characterized by widespread thickening of the capillary wall due to deposition of subepithelial immune complexes. Membranous glomerulonephritis associated with SLE is very similar to that encountered in idiopathic membranous nephropathy (Chapter 13). Thickening of capillary walls is caused by increased deposition of base- ment membrane-like material, as well as accumulation of immune complexes. Patients with this histologic change almost always have severe proteinuria with ove nephrotic syndrome (Chapter 13). * Advanced sclerosing lupus nephritis (class VI) is characterized by complete sclerosis of greater than 90% of glomeruli and corresponds to clinical end stage renal disease.",

Proto-oncogenes code for proteins that help to regulate the cell growth and differentiation. Proto-oncogenes are often involved in signal transduction and execution of mitogenic signals, usually through their protein products. Upon acquiring an activating mutation, a proto-oncogene becomes a tumor-inducing agent, an oncogene. Examples of proto-oncogenes include RAS, WNT, MYC, ERK, and TRK. The MYC gene is implicated in Burkitt's lymphoma, which stas when a chromosomal translocation moves an enhancer sequence within the vicinity of the MYC gene. The MYC gene codes for widely used transcription factors. When the enhancer sequence is wrongly placed, these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates. Another example of an oncogene is the Bcr-Abl gene found on the Philadelphia chromosome, a piece of genetic material seen in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia caused by the translocation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22.

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 7/e p290-291 Your Position: Cell Cycle Inhibitor Proteins Cell Cycle Inhibitor Proteins Creat Cell Cycle Inhibitor Proteins The cell cycle is the series of events which regulate the life of the cell. This regulation results from a combination of several signals from different regulatory pathways that are activated in response to specific stimuli. The cell cycle has a central role in controlling cell growth and proliferation. It frequently becomes the target of genetic alteration, the accumulation of which may lead to the deregulation of these ordered events and may be related to the onset of cancer. With the growing understanding of the impoant role of cell cycle regulation in tumor formation and apoptosis, cell cycle inhibitors have been fuher studied in the field of cancer treatment. Cyclin-dependent Kinase (CDK) Inhibitors Progression through the cell cycle is ensured by paicular protein complexes, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The CDKs are a family of highly conserved serine/threonine kinases, which share a high homology in a paicular region. CDKs may control the cell cycle by phosphorylating different targets, which may in turn be activated or inactivated. Regulation of CDK/cyclin activity can occur through regulatory proteins, such as CDK Inhibitors (CKIs). The CKIs can inhibit the activity of CDK by associating in vivo with the CDK subunit, the cyclin or the cyclin/CDK complex. This inhibition may occur in different ways, such as inhibition of the CDK kinase activity, interference with CAK mediated CDK activation, or competition with cyclins in binding to the catalytic subunit. The inhibitory process can be carried out by one or a combination of these mechanisms. The expression of these CKIs may be induced by stimuli such as senescence, contact inhibition, extracellular anti-mitogenic factors and cell cycle checkpoints. Their role in controlling cell cycle is crucial. In several forms of cancer, CKIs such as p16 and p27 are mutated. Also, they have been found to be degraded in several types of cancer. Low levels of p27 levels are correlated with poor clinical prognosis. These inhibitors can be upregulated when required, thus blocking the activation of the CDK by a cyclin. This arrests the cell in a paicular pa of the cell cycle until conditions are such that it can continue towards proliferation or, if necessary, be steered towards cell death.",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 7/e p195, 9/e p286 Ras proteins function as binary molecular switches that control intracellular signaling networks. Ras-regulated signal pathways control such processes as actin cytoskeletal integrity, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell adhesion, apoptosis, and cell migration. Ras and Ras-related proteins are often deregulated in cancers, leading to increased invasion and metastasis, and decreased apoptosis. Ras activates several pathways, of which the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade has been well-studied. This cascade transmits signals downstream and results in the transcription of genes involved in cell growth and division. Another Ras-activated signaling pathway is the PI3K/AKT/m. TOR pathway, which stimulates protein synthesis and cellular growth, and inhibits When Ras is 'switched on' by incoming signals, it subsequently switches on other proteins, which ultimately turn on genes involved in cell growth, differentiation and survival. Mutations in ras genes can lead to the production of permanently activated Ras proteins. As a result, this can cause unintended and overactive signaling inside the cell, even in the absence of incoming signals. Because these signals result in cell growth and division, overactive Ras signaling can ultimately lead to cancer. The 3 Ras genes in humans (HRas, KRas, and NRas) are the most common oncogenes in human cancer; mutations that permanently activate Ras are found in 20% to 25% of all human tumors and up to 90% in ceain types of cancer (e. g., pancreatic cancer). For this reason, Ras inhibitors are being studied as a treatment for cancer and other diseases with Ras overexpression.",

The p53 protein thwas neoplastic transformation by three interlocking mechanisms: activation of temporary cell cycle arrest (termed quiescence), induction of permanent cell cycle arrest (termed senescence), or triggering of pro- grammed cell death (termed apoptosis). If Rb \"senses\" external signals, p53 can be viewed as a central monitor of internal stress, directing the stressed cells toward one of these three pathways. A variety of stresses trigger the p53 response pathways, including anoxia, inappropriate oncoprotein activity (e. g., MYC or RAS), and damage to the integrity of DNA. By managing the DNA damage response, p53 plays a central role in maintaining the integrity of the genome, as described next. In nonstressed, healthy cells, p53 has a sho half-life (20 minutes) because of its association with MDM2, a protein that targets p53 for destruction. When the cell is stressed, for example, by an assault on its DNA, \"sensors\" that include protein kinases such as ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) are activated. These activated complexes catalyze post-translational modifications in p53 that release it from MDM2 and increase its half-life and enhance its ability to drive the transcription of target genes. Hundreds of genes whose transcription is triggered by p53 have been found. These genes suppress neoplastic transformation by three mechanisms: * p53-mediated cell cycle arrest may be considered the primor- dial response to DNA damage (Fig. 5-23). It occurs late in the G1 phase and is caused mainly by p53-dependent transcription of the CDKI gene CDKN1A (p21). The p21 protein, as described earlier, inhibits cyclin-CDK com- plexes and prevents phosphorylation of Rb, thereby arresting cells in the G1 phase. Such a pause in cell cycling is welcome, because it gives the cells \"breathing time\" to repair DNA damage",

Postganglionic neurons meant for these structures lie amongst the nerve fibres forming these plexuses. REF: Inderbir Singh's Textbook of Human Histology, SEVENTH EDITION, PG. NO., 263.",

Some people apparently inherit genes that make them susceptible to allergies. This susceptibility is manifested by the propen- sity of such persons to mount strong TH2 responses and, subsequently, to produce IgE antibody against the aller- gens. The IgE is central to the activation of the mast cells and release of mediators that are responsible for the clinical and pathologic manifestations of the reaction.

Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of cancer. A person with hereditary retinoblastoma may inherit an altered copy of the RB1 gene from one parent, or the altered gene may be the result of a new mutation that occurs in an egg or sperm cell or just after feilization. For retinoblastoma to develop, a mutation involving the other copy of the RB1 gene must occur in retinal cells during the person's lifetime. This second mutation usually occurs in childhood, typically leading to the development of retinoblastoma in both eyes. In the non-hereditary form of retinoblastoma, typically only one eye is affected and there is no family history of the disease. Affected individuals are born with two normal copies of the RB1 gene. Then, usually in early childhood, both copies of the RB1 gene in ceain retinal cells acquire mutations. People with non-hereditary retinoblastoma are not at risk of passing these RB1 gene mutations to their children. However, without genetic testing it can be difficult to tell whether a person with retinoblastoma in one eye has the hereditary or the non-hereditary form of the disease.",

After extravasating from the blood, leuko- cytes move toward sites of infection or injury along a chem- ical gradient by a process called chemotaxis. Both exogenous and endogenous substances can be chemotactic for leuko- cytes, including the following: * Bacterial products, paicularly peptides with N-formyl- methionine termini * Cytokines, especially those of the chemokine family * Components of the complement system, paicularly C5 * Products of the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, paicularly leukotriene B4 (LTB4) These mediators, which are described in more detail later, are produced in response to infections and tissue damage and during immunologic reactions. Leukocyte infiltration in all of these situations results from the actions of various combinations of mediators. Chemotactic molecules bind to specific cell surface receptors, which triggers the assembly of cytoskeletal con- tractile elements necessary for movement. Leukocytes move by extending pseudopods that anchor to the ECM and then pull the cell in the direction of the extension. The direction of such movement is specified by a higher density of chemokine receptors at the leading edge of the cell. Thus, leukocytes move to and are retained at the site where they are needed. The type of emigrating leukocyte varies with the age of the inflammatory response and with the type of stimulus. In most forms of acute inflammation, neutrophils predomi- nate in the inflammatory infiltrate during the first 6 to 24 hours and are replaced by monocytes in 24 to 48 hours (Fig. 2-6). Several factors account for this early abundance of neutro- phils: These cells are the most numerous leukocytes in the blood, they respond more rapidly to chemokines, and they may attach more firmly to the adhesion molecules that are rapidly induced on endothelial cells, such as P- and E-selectins. In addition, after entering tissues, neutrophils are sho-lived--they die by apoptosis and disappear within 24 to 48 hours--while monocytes survive longer. There are exceptions to this pattern of cellular infiltration,",

        "exp": "Oncogenic RNA Viruses The study of oncogenic retroviruses in animals has pro- vided spectacular insights into the genetic basis of cancer. However, only one retrovirus, the human T cell lympho- tropic virus-1 (HTLV-1), has been demonstrated to cause cancer in humans. HTLV-1 is associated with a form of T cell leukemia/lymphoma that is endemic in ceain pas of Japan and the Caribbean basin but is found sporadically elsewhere, including the United States. Similar to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HTLV-1 has tropism for CD4+ T cells, and this subset of T cells is the major target for neoplastic transformation. Human infec- tion requires transmission of infected T cells through sexual intercourse, blood products, or breastfeeding. Leukemia develops only in about 3% to 5% of infected persons after a long latent period of 20 to 50 years. There is little doubt that HTLV-1 infection of T lympho- cytes is necessary for leukemogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms of transformation are not clear. The HTLV-1 genome does not contain a viral oncogene, and in contrast with ceain animal retroviruses, no consistent integration site next to a cellular oncogene has been discovered. Indeed, the long latency period between initial infection and devel- opment of disease suggests a multistep process, during which many oncogenic mutations are accumulated. The genome of HTLV-1 contains, in addition to the usual retroviral genes, a unique region called pX. This region contains several genes, including one called TAX. The TAX protein has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for cellular transformation. By interacting with several transcription factors, such as NF-kB, the TAX protein can transactivate the expression of genes that encode cytokines, cytokine receptors, and costimulatory molecules. This inappropriate gene expression leads to autocrine signaling loops and increased activation of promitogenic signaling cascades. Fuhermore, TAX can drive progression through the cell cycle by directly binding to and activating cyclins. In addition, TAX can repress the function of several tumor suppressor genes that control the cell cycle, including CDKN2A/p16 and TP53. From these and other observa- tions, the following scenario is emerging (Fig. 5-31): The TAX gene turns on several cytokine genes and their recep- tors (e. g., the interleukins IL-2 and IL-2R and IL-15 and IL-15R), setting up an autocrine system that drives T cell proliferation. Of these cytokines, IL-15 seems to be more impoant, but much remains to be defined. Additionally, a parallel paracrine pathway is activated by increased pro- duction of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which stimulates neighboring macrophages to produce other T cell mitogens. Initially, the T cell prolifera- tion is polyclonal, because the virus infects many cells, but because of TAX-based inactivation of tumor suppressor genes such as TP53, the proliferating T cells are at increased risk for secondary transforming events (mutations), which lead ultimately to the outgrowth of a monoclonal neoplas- tic T cell population.",

It is a loss in the uniformity of individual cells and in their architectural orientation. Dysplastic cells exhibit considerable pleomorphism and often possess hyperchro- matic nuclei that are abnormally large for the size of the cell. Mitotic figures are more abundant than usual and frequently appear in abnormal locations within the epithe- lium. In dysplastic stratified squamous epithelium, mitoses are not confined to the basal layers, where they normally occur, but may be seen at all levels and even in surface cells. There is considerable architectural anarchy. For example, the usual progressive maturation of tall cells in the basal layer to flattened squames on the surface may be lost and replaced by a disordered scrambling of dark basal- appearing cells (Fig. 5-6). When dysplastic changes are marked and involve the entire thickness of the epithelium, the lesion is referred to as carcinoma in situ, a preinvasive stage of cancer (Chapter 18). Although dysplastic changes often are found adjacent to foci of malignant transforma- tion, and long-term studies of cigarette smokers show that epithelial dysplasia almost invariably antedates the appear- ance of cancer, the term dysplasia is not synonymous with cancer; mild to moderate dysplasias that do not involve the entire thickness of the epithelium sometimes regress completely, par- ticularly if inciting causes are removed. Clinical Features Although most of these lesions arise in the skin, they also may involve the oral and anogenital mucosal surfaces, the esophagus, the meninges, and the eye. The following com- ments apply to cutaneous melanomas. Melanoma of the skin usually is asymptomatic, although pruritus may be an early manifestation. The most impoant clinical sign is a change in the color or size of a pigmented lesion. The main clinical warning signs are 1. Rapid enlargement of a preexisting nevus 2. Itching or pain in a lesion 3. Development of a new pigmented lesion during adult life 4. Irregularity of the borders of a pigmented lesion 5. Variegation of color within a pigmented lesion These principles are expressed in the so-called ABCs of melanoma: asymmetry, border, color, diameter, and evolu- tion (change of an existing nevus). It is vitally impoant to recognize melanomas and intervene as rapidly as pos- sible. The vast majority of superficial lesions are curable surgically, while metastatic melanoma has a very poor prognosis. The probability of metastasis is predicted by measuring the depth of invasion in millimeters of the veical growth phase nodule from the top of the granular cell layer of the overlying epidermis (Breslow thickness). Metastasis risk also is increased in tumors with a high mitotic rate and in those that fail to induce a local immune response. When metastases occur, they involve not only regional lymph nodes but also liver, lungs, brain, and viually any other site that can be seeded hematogenously. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (of the first draining node of a primary melanoma) at the time of surgery provides additional information on biologic aggressiveness. In some cases, metastases may appear for the first time many years after complete surgical excision of the primary tumor, suggesting a long phase of dormancy, during which time the tumor may be held in check by the host immune response. Recognition of the likely role of the host immune response has led to therapeutic trials of immunomodula- tors. Some impressive responses in patients with advanced",

The severity of the inflammatory response, its specific cause, and the paicular tissue involved all can modify the basic morphology of acute inflammation, pro- ducing distinctive appearances. The impoance of recog- nizing these morphologic patterns is that they are often associated with different etiology and clinical situations. MORPHOLOGY * Serous inflammation is characterized by the outpour- ing of a watery, relatively protein-poor fluid that, depend- ing on the site of injury, derives either from the plasma or from the secretions of mesothelial cells lining the perito- neal, pleural, and pericardial cavities. The skin blister resulting from a burn or viral infection is a good example of the accumulation of a serous effusion either within or immediately beneath the epidermis of the skin (Fig. 2-11). Fluid in a serous cavity is called an effusion. * Fibrinous inflammation occurs as a consequence of more severe injuries, resulting in greater vascular perme- ability that allows large molecules (such as fibrinogen) to pass the endothelial barrier. Histologically, the accumu- lated extravascular fibrin appears as an eosinophilic mesh- work of threads or sometimes as an amorphous coagulum (Fig. 2-12). A fibrinous exudate is characteristic of inflam- mation in the lining of body cavities, such as the meninges, pericardium, and pleura. Such exudates may be degraded by fibrinolysis, and the accumulated debris may be removed by macrophages, resulting in restoration of the normal tissue structure (resolution). However, exten- sive fibrin-rich exudates may not be completely removed, and are replaced by an ingrowth of fibroblasts and blood vessels (organization), leading ultimately to scar- ring that may have significant clinical consequences. For example, organization of a fibrinous pericardial exudate forms dense fibrous scar tissue that bridges or obliterates the pericardial space and restricts myocardial function. * Suppurative (purulent) inflammation and abscess formation. These are manifested by the collection of large amounts of purulent exudate (pus) consisting of neutrophils, necrotic cells, and edema fluid. Ceain organ- isms (e. g., staphylococci) are more likely to induce such localized suppuration and are therefore referred to as pyogenic (pus-forming). Abscesses are focal collections of pus that may be caused by seeding of pyogenic organ- isms into a tissue or by secondary infections of necrotic foci. Abscesses typically have a central, largely necrotic region rimmed by a layer of preserved neutrophils (Fig. 2-13), with a surrounding zone of dilated vessels and fibroblast proliferation indicative of attempted repair. As time passes, the abscess may become completely walled off and eventually be replaced by connective tissue. Because of the underlying tissue destruction, the usual outcome with abscess formation is scarring.",

        "question": "All are affected in graft versus host reaction",
        "exp": "Ref Robbins 9/e p236 REJECTION OF TRANSPLANTS The major barrier to transplantation of organs from one individual to another of the same species (called allografts) is immunologic rejection of the transplanted tissue. Rejec- tion is a complex phenomenon involving both cell- and antibody-mediated reactions that destroy the graft. The key to successful transplantation has been the development of therapies that prevent or minimize rejection. Discussed next is how grafts are recognized as foreign and how they are rejected. Immune Recognition of Allografts Rejection of allografts is a response mainly to MHC molecules, which are so polymorphic that most individuals in an outbred population differ in at least some of the MHC molecules they express (except, of course, for identical twins). There are two main mechanisms by which the host immune system recognizes and responds to the MHC mol- ecules on the graft (Fig. 4-23): * Direct recognition. Host T cells directly recognize the allo- geneic (foreign) MHC molecules that are expressed on graft cells. Direct recognition of foreign MHC seems to violate the rule of MHC restriction, which states that in every individual, all of the T cells are educated to recog- nize foreign antigens displayed by only that individual's MHC molecules. It is postulated that allogeneic MHC molecules (with any bound peptides) structurally mimic self MHC and foreign peptide, and so direct recognition of the allogeneic MHC is essentially an immunologic cross-reaction. Because DCs in the graft express high levels of MHC as well as costimulatory molecules, they are believed to be the major culprits contributing to direct recognition. The most impoant consequence of direct recognition is the activation of host CD8+ T cells that recognize class I MHC (HLA-A, -B) molecules in the graft. These T cells differentiate into CTLs, which kill the cells in the graft. Host CD4+ helper T cells may be trig- gered into proliferation and cytokine production by rec- ognition of donor class II MHC (HLA-D) molecules and drive an inflammatory response. Indirect recognition. In this pathway, host CD4+ T cells recognize donor MHC molecules after these molecules are picked up, processed, and presented by the host's own APCs. This sequence is similar to the physiologic processing and presentation of other foreign (e. g., microbial) antigens. The activated CD4+ T cells then recognize APCs displaying graft antigens and secrete cytokines that induce inflammation and damage the graft. The indirect pathway is also involved in the pro- duction of antibodies against graft alloantigens; if these antigens are proteins, they are picked up by host B cells, and peptides are presented to helper T cells, which then stimulate antibody responses. Effector Mechanisms of Graft Rejection Both T cells and antibodies reactive with the graft are involved in the rejection of most solid-organ allografts (Fig. 4-23). T Cell-Mediated Rejection CTLs kill cells in the grafted tissue, causing parenchymal and endothelial cell death (the latter resulting in thrombo- sis and graft ischemia). Cytokine-secreting CD4+ T cells trigger inflammatory reactions resembling DTH in the tissues and blood vessels, with local accumulation of mononuclear cells (lymphocytes and macrophages). Acti- vated microphages can injure graft cells and vasculature. The microvascular injury also results in tissue ischemia, which contributes to graft destruction. Antibody-Mediated Rejection Although T cells are of paramount impoance in allograft rejection, antibodies also mediate some forms of rejection. Alloantibodies directed against graft MHC molecules and other alloantigens bind to the graft endothelium and cause vascular injury through complement activation and recruit- ment of leukocytes. Superimposed on the resulting endo- thelial damage and dysfunction is thrombosis, adding fuher ischemic insult to the injury. Hyperacute rejection is a special form of rejection occur- ring if pre-formed anti-donor antibodies are present in the circulation of the host before transplantation. This may happen in multiparous women who have anti-HLA anti- bodies against paternal antigens encountered during preg- nancy, or in individuals exposed to foreign HLA (on platelets or leukocytes) from previous blood transfusions. Obviously, such antibodies also may be present in a patient who has previously rejected an organ transplant. Subse- quent transplantation in such patients will result in imme- diate rejection (within minutes to hours) because the MORPHOLOGY On the basis of the time course and morphology of rejection reactions, they have been classified as hyperacute, acute, and chronic (Fig. 4-24). This classification is helpful for under- standing the mechanism of rejection, because each pattern is caused by a different type of dominant immunologic reaction. The morphology of these patterns is described in the context of renal transplants; however, similar changes are encoun- tered in other vascularized organ transplants. Hyperacute Rejection Hyperacute rejection occurs within minutes to a few hours after transplantation in a presensitized host and typically is recognized by the surgeon just after the vascular anastomosis is completed. In contrast with a nonrejecting kidney graft, which regains a normal pink color and tissue turgor and promptly excretes urine, a hyperacutely rejecting kidney rapidly becomes cyanotic, mottled, and flaccid and may excrete only a few drops of bloody fluid. The histologic picture is characterized by widespread acute aeritis and aeriolitis, vessel thrombosis, and ischemic necrosis, all resulting from the binding of preformed antibodies to graft endothelium. Viually all aerioles and aeries exhibit char- acteristic acute fibrinoid necrosis of their walls, with narrow- ing or complete occlusion of the lumens by precipitated fibrin and cellular debris (Fig. 4-24, A). circulating antibodies rapidly bind to the endothelium of the grafted organ, with resultant complement activation and vascular thrombosis. With the current practice of screening potential recipients for pre-formed anti-HLA antibodies and cross-matching (testing recipients for the presence of antibodies directed against the donor's lym- phocytes), hyperacute rejection occurs in less than 0. 4% of transplant recipients. Acute Rejection Acute rejection may occur within days to weeks of transplan- tation in a nonimmunosuppressed host or may appear months or even years later, even in the presence of adequate immunosuppression. Acute rejection is caused by both cel- lular and humoral immune mechanisms, and in any one patient, one or the other may predominate, or both may be present. On histologic examination, cellular rejection is marked by an interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrate with asso- ciated edema and parenchymal injury, whereas humoral rejection is associated with vasculitis. Acute cellular rejection most commonly is seen within the first months after transplantation and typically is accom- panied by clinical signs of renal failure. Histologic examination usually shows extensive interstitial CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration with edema and mild interstitial hemorrhage (Fig. 4-24, B). Glomerular and peritubular capillaries contain large numbers of mononuclear cells, which also may invade the tubules, leading to focal tubular necrosis. In addition to tubular injury, CD8+ T cells also may injure the endothelium, causing an endothelitis. Cyclosporine (a widely used immu- nosuppressive agent) is also nephrotoxic and induces so- called aeriolar hyaline deposits. Renal biopsy is used to distinguish rejection from drug toxicity. Accurate recogni- tion of cellular rejection is impoant, because patients typi- cally respond promptly to increased immunosuppressive therapy. Acute humoral rejection (rejection vasculitis) caused by antidonor antibodies also may paicipate in acute graft rejection. The histologic lesions may take the form of necro- tizing vasculitis with endothelial cell necrosis; neutrophilic infiltration; deposition of antibody, complement, and fibrin; and thrombosis. Such lesions may be associated with isch- emic necrosis of the renal parenchyma. Somewhat older subacute lesions are characterized by marked thickening of the intima by proliferating fibroblasts, myocytes, and foamy macrophages (Fig. 4-24, C). The resultant narrowing of the aerioles may cause infarction or renal coical atrophy. The proliferative vascular lesions mimic aeriosclerotic thickening and are believed to be caused by cytokines that stimulate proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Local deposi- tion of complement breakdown products (specifically C4d) is used to detect antibody-mediated rejection of kidney allografts. Chronic Rejection Patients present with chronic rejection late after transplanta- tion (months to years) with a progressive rise in serum cre- atinine levels (an index of renal function) over a period of 4 to 6 months. Chronic rejection is dominated by vascular changes, interstitial fibrosis, and loss of renal parenchyma; there are typically only mild or no ongoing cellular parenchy- mal infiltrates. The vascular changes occur predominantly in the aeries and aerioles, which exhibit intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis (Fig. 4-24, D). These lesions ultimately compromise vascular perfusion and result in renal ischemia manifested by loss or hyalinization of glomeruli, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. The vascular lesion may be caused by cytokines released by activated T cells that act on the cells of the vas- cular wall, and it may be the end stage of the proliferative aeritis described earlier.",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 8/e 523_524 KS is caused by a virus called human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV). KS develops when infected cells that line lymph or blood vessels begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues. Whereas most cancers begin in one pa of the body and may later spread to other areas, KS usually appears as lesions (abnormal bumps, spots or patches) on the skin or on mucosal surfaces (such as inside the mouth or in the genitals). Lesions can also develop in other pas of the body, such as in the lungs, lymph nodes or gastrointestinal tract. Having visible KS lesions can be upsetting. Nonetheless, they may develop very slowly without causing any serious complications. If KS is confined to the skin or lymph nodes without causing any swelling, it usually responds very well to treatment with anti-HIV drugs. Infection with HHV-8, the virus which causes KS, is widespread among gay men and in African countries. The virus can be found in saliva and may be passed on during sex, including through wet kissing, oral sex, and using saliva as a lubricant during sex. It can also be spread when adults pre-chew food for infants. There isn't a vaccine to prevent HHV-8 infection. A normally functioning immune system can usually keep HHV-8 infections under control and suppress the abnormal growth of cells into KS lesions. Most people who have HHV-8 never get KS. However, when the immune system is weakened and an unhelpful activation of the immune system in response to HHV-8 occurs, KS may develop. Generally, KS is a rare cancer in people who don't have HIV. Nonetheless, cases do occur in HIV-negative people, paicularly in people who take medications that suppress the immune system (such as coicosteroids). It is also one of the most common cancers in African countries, with large numbers of cases in people who don't have HIV.",

The key steps in this reaction are the production of microbicidal substances within lysosomes and fusion of the lysosomes with phago- somes, thus exposing the ingested paicles to the destruc- tive mechanisms of the leukocytes (Fig. 2-8). The most impoant microbicidal substances are reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lysosomal enzymes. The production of ROS involves the following steps: * Phagocytosis and the engagement of various cellular receptors stimulate an oxidative burst, also called the respiratory burst, which is characterized by a rapid increase in oxygen consumption, glycogen catabolism (glycogenolysis), increased glucose oxidation, and production of ROS. The generation of the oxygen metabolites is due to rapid activation of a leukocyte NADPH oxidase, called the phagocyte oxidase, which oxi- dizes NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleo- tide phosphate) and, in the process, conves oxygen to superoxide ion (O2 * ) (see Fig. 1-18, B, Chapter 1). * Superoxide is then conveed by spontaneous dismuta- tion into hydrogen peroxide (O2 * + 2H+ - H2. O2). These ROS act as free radicals and destroy microbes by mecha- nisms that were described in Chapter 1. * The quantities of H2. O2 produced generally are insuffi- cient to kill most bacteria (although superoxide and hydroxyl radical formation may be sufficient to do so). However, the lysosomes of neutrophils (called azuro- philic granules) contain the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO), and in the presence of a halide such as Cl-, MPO conves H2. O2 to HOCl* (hypochlorous radical). HOCl* is a powerful oxidant and antimicrobial agent (Na. OCl is the active ingredient in chlorine bleach) that kills bacteria by halogenation, or by protein and lipid peroxidation. Founately, the phagocyte oxidase is active only after its cytosolic subunit translocates to the membrane of the pha- golysosome; thus, the reactive end products are generated mainly within the vesicles, and the phagocyte itself is not damaged. H2. O2 is eventually broken down to water and O2 by the actions of catalase, and the other ROS also are degraded (Chapter 1). Reactive nitrogen species, paicu- larly nitric oxide (NO), act in the same way as that described for ROS.",

Lck is essential for the activation of many molecular components of the signaling cascade of an activated T cell. Depending on the signal, different types of T helper cells result.

The sequence of events in the recruitment of leuko- cytes from the vascular lumen to the extravascular space consists of (1) margination and rolling along the vessel wall; (2) firm adhesion to the endothelium; (3) transmigra- tion between endothelial cells; and (4) migration in inter- stitial tissues toward a chemotactic stimulus (Fig. 2-5). Rolling, adhesion, and transmigration are mediated by the interactions of adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial surfaces (see later on). Chemical mediators-- chemoattractants and ceain cytokines--affect these pro- cesses by modulating the surface expression and binding affinity of the adhesion molecules and by stimulating direc- tional movement of the leukocytes. Margination and Rolling. As blood flows from capillaries into postcapillary venules, circulating cells are swept by laminar flow against the vessel wall. Because the smaller red cells tend to move faster than the larger white cells, leukocytes are pushed out of the central axial column and thus have a better oppounity to interact with lining endothelial cells, especially as stasis sets in. This process of leukocyte accumulation at the periphery of vessels is called margination. If the endothelial cells are activated by cytokines and other mediators produced locally, they express adhesion molecules to which the leukocytes attach loosely. These cells bind and detach and thus begin to tumble on the endothelial surface, a process called rolling. Adhesion. The rolling leukocytes are able to sense changes in the endothelium that initiate the next step in the reaction of leukocytes, which is firm adhesion to endothelial sur- faces.

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 9/e p209 Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), described next, is an illustrative model of T cell-mediated inflammation and tissue injury. The same reactions are the underlying basis for several diseases. Contact dermatitis is an example of tissue injury resulting from T cell-mediated inflammation. It is evoked by contact with pentadecylcatechol (also known as urushiol, the active component of poison ivy and poison oak, which probably becomes antigenic by binding to a host protein). On reexposure of a previously exposed person to the plants, sensitized TH1 CD4+ cells accumulate in the dermis and migrate toward the antigen within the epidermis. Here they release cytokines that damage kera- tinocytes, causing separation of these cells and formation of an intraepidermal vesicle, and inflammation manifested as a vesicular dermatitis. It has long been thought that several systemic diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and mul- tiple sclerosis, are caused by TH1 and TH17 reactions against self antigens, and Crohn disease may be caused by uncon- trolled reactions involving the same T cells but directed against intestinal bacteria. T cell-mediated inflammation also plays a role in the rejection of transplants, described later in the chapter. Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity DTH is a T cell-mediated reaction that develops in response to antigen challenge in a previously sensitized individual. In contrast with immediate hypersensitivity, the DTH reac- tion is delayed for 12 to 48 hours, which is the time it takes for effector T cells to be recruited to the site of antigen chal- lenge and to be activated to secrete cytokines. The classic example of DTH is the tuberculin reaction, elicited by chal- lenge with a protein extract of M. tuberculosis (tuberculin) in a person who has previously been exposed to the tuber- cle bacillus. Between 8 and 12 hours after intracutaneous injection of tuberculin, a local area of erythema and indura- tion appears, reaching a peak (typically 1 to 2 cm in diam- eter) in 24 to 72 hours and thereafter slowly subsiding. On histologic examination, the DTH reaction is characterized by perivascular accumulation (\"cuffing\") of CD4+ helper T cells and macrophages (Fig. 4-13). Local secretion of cyto- kines by these cells leads to increased microvascular per- meability, giving rise to dermal edema and fibrin deposition; the latter is the main cause of the tissue induration in these responses. DTH reactions are mediated primarily by TH1 cells; the contribution of TH17 cells is unclear. The tubercu- lin response is used to screen populations for people who have had previous exposure to tuberculosis and therefore have circulating memory T cells specific for mycobacterial proteins. Notably, immunosuppression or loss of CD4+ T cells (e. g., resulting from HIV infection) may lead to a nega- tive tuberculin response even in the presence of a severe infection. Prolonged DTH reactions against persistent microbes or other stimuli may result in a special morphologic pattern of reaction called granulomatous inflammation. The initial perivascular CD4+ T cell infiltrate is progressively replaced by macrophages over a period of 2 to 3 weeks. These accumulated macrophages typically exhibit morphologic evidence of activation; that is, they become large, flat, and eosinophilic, and are called epithelioid cells. The epitheli- oid cells occasionally fuse under the influence of cytokines (e. g., IFN-g) to form multinucleate giant cells. A micro- scopic aggregate of epithelioid cells, typically surrounded by a collar of lymphocytes, is called a granuloma (Fig. 4-14, A). The process is essentially a chronic form of TH1-mediated inflammation and macrophage activation (Fig. 4-14, B). Older granulomas develop an enclosing rim of fibroblasts and connective tissue. Recognition of a granuloma is of diagnostic impoance because of the limited number of conditions that can cause it (Chapter 2).",

The basis for this disorder is defective DNA repair. Ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight cause cross-linking of pyrimidine residues, preventing normal DNA replication. Such DNA damage is repaired by the nucleotide excision repair system. Several proteins are involved in nucleotide excision repair, and an inherited loss of any one of these can give rise to xeroderma pigmentosum. Diseases with Defects in DNA Repair by Homologous Recombination A group of autosomal recessive disorders comprising Bloom syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, and Fanconi anemia is characterized by hypersensitivity to other DNA- damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation (in Bloom syn- drome and ataxia-telangiectasia), or to DNA cross-linking agents, such as nitrogen mustard (in Fanconi anemia). Their phenotype is complex and includes, in addition to predisposition to cancer, features such as neural symptoms (in ataxia-telangiectasia), anemia (in Fanconi anemia), and developmental defects (in Bloom syndrome). The gene mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia is ATM, which encodes a protein kinase that is impoant in recognizing DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation and initiating p53 activation. Evidence for the role of DNA repair genes in the origin of cancer also comes from the study of hereditary breast cancer. Mutations in two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, account for 50% of cases of familial breast cancer. In addi- tion to breast cancer, women with BRCA1 mutations have a substantially higher risk of epithelial ovarian cancers, and men have a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer. Like- wise, mutations in the BRCA2 gene increase the risk of breast cancer in both men and women, as well as cancer of the ovary, prostate, pancreas, bile ducts, stomach, melano- cytes, and B lymphocytes. Although the functions of these genes have not been elucidated fully, cells that lack these genes develop chromosomal breaks and severe aneuploidy. Indeed, both genes seem to function, at least in pa, in the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway. For example, BRCA1 forms a complex with other proteins in the homologous recombination pathway and also is linked to the ATM kinase pathway. BRCA2 was identified as one of several genes mutated in Fanconi anemia, and the BRCA2 protein has been shown to bind to RAD51, a protein required for homologous recombination. Similar to other tumor suppressor genes, both copies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 must be inactivated for cancer to develop. Although linkage of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to familial breast cancers is estab- lished, these genes are rarely inactivated in sporadic cases of breast cancer. In this regard, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are dif- ferent from other tumor suppressor genes, such as APC and TP53, which are inactivated in both familial and spo- radic cancers. ref Robbins 8/e p275; 9/e p314",

It may be seen in disorders ranging from obstetric complications to advanced malignancy. The thrombi are generally microscopic in size, yet so numerous as to often cause circulatory insufficiency, paicularly in the brain, lungs, hea, and kidneys. To complicate matters, the widespread microvascular thrombosis consumes plate- lets and coagulation proteins (hence the synonym con- sumption coagulopathy), and at the same time, fibrinolytic mechanisms are activated. Thus, an initially thrombotic disorder can evolve into a bleeding catastrophe.

Each of these molecules is a heterodimer, con- sisting of a polymorphic 44-k. Da a chain noncovalently associated with an invariant 12-k. Da b2-microglobulin polypeptide (encoded by a separate gene on chromo- some 15). The extracellular poion of the a chain contains a cleft where the polymorphic residues are located and where foreign peptides bind to MHC mol- ecules for presentation to T cells, and a conserved region that binds CD8, ensuring that only CD8+ T cells can respond to peptides displayed by class I molecules. In general, class I MHC molecules bind and display pep- tides derived from proteins synthesized in the cyto- plasm of the cell (e. g., viral antigens). Because class I MHC molecules are present on all nucleated cells, all virus-infected cells can be detected and eliminated by CD8+ CTLs. * Class II MHC molecules are encoded by genes in the HLA-D region, which contains at least three subregions: DP, DQ, and DR. Class II MHC molecules are heterodi- mers of noncovalently linked polymorphic a and b sub- units (Fig. 4-3). The extracellular poion of the class II MHC heterodimer contains a cleft for the binding of antigenic peptides and a region that binds CD4. Class II MHC expression is restricted to a few types of cells, mainly APCs (notably, dendritic cells ), macro- phages, and B cells. In general, class II MHC molecules bind to peptides derived from proteins synthesized outside the cell (e. g., those derived from extracellular bacteria) and ingested into the cell. This propey allows CD4+ T cells to recognize the presence of extracellular pathogens and to orchestrate a protective response. * Several other proteins are encoded in the MHC locus, some of which have been called \"class III molecules. \" These include complement components (C2, C3, and Bf) and the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin.

Russell bodies are thought to have originated as an SOS compament, where abnormal proteins that are not secreted, but have fled intracellular degradation, can gather without blocking normal secretory pathways. The excess immunoglobulin builds up and forms intracytoplasmic globules, which is thought to be a result of insufficient protein transpo within the cell. This causes the proteins to neither be degraded or secreted and stay stored in dilated cisternae. In 1949, Pearse discovered that Russell bodies also contain mucoproteins that are secreted by plasma cells. Russell bodies are not tissue specific; during research they were induced in rat glioma cells. Russell bodies were found to have positive reactions to PAS stain, CD 38 and CD 138 stains. Plasma cellsthat contain Russell bodies and are stained with H&E stain are found to be autofluorescent, while those without Russell bodies are not autofluorescent.

Recent studies indicate that there are at least 8 genetically distinct FA groups (A, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G). To date, 6 genes (for A, C, D2, E, F, and G) have been cloned. In this review, we describe the structures and functions of FA proteins. Increasing evidence indicates that the multiple FA proteins cooperate in a biochemical pathway and/or a multimer complex. FANCD2, a downstream component of the FA pathway, has recently been shown to be ubiquitinated in response to DNA damage and to translocate to nuclear foci containing BRCA1, a breast cancer susceptibility gene product, suggesting a role for this protein in DNA repair functions. We also describe 2 emerging issues: genotype-phenotype relationships and mosaicism. The FA pathway is likely to play a critical role as a caretaker of genomic integrity in hematopoietic stem cells. Clarifying the molecular basis of this disease may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of bone marrow failure syndromes and myeloid malignancies.",

The p53 protein thwas neoplastic transformation by three interlocking mechanisms: activation of temporary cell cycle arrest (termed quiescence), induction of permanent cell cycle arrest (termed senescence), or triggering of pro- grammed cell death (termed apoptosis). If Rb \"senses\" external signals, p53 can be viewed as a central monitor of internal stress, directing the stressed cells toward one of these three pathways. A variety of stresses trigger the p53 response pathways, including anoxia, inappropriate oncoprotein activity (e. g., MYC or RAS), and damage to the integrity of DNA. By managing the DNA damage response, p53 plays a central role in maintaining the integrity of the genome, as described next. p53-mediated cell cycle arrest may be considered the primor- dial response to DNA damage (Fig. 5-23). It occurs late in the G1 phase and is caused mainly by p53-dependent transcription of the CDKI gene CDKN1A (p21). The p21 protein, as described earlier, inhibits cyclin-CDK com- plexes and prevents phosphorylation of Rb, thereby arresting cells in the G1 phase. Such a pause in cell cycling is welcome, because it gives the cells \"breathing time\" to repair DNA damage.",

Granulo- mas can form under three settings: * With persistent T-cell responses to ceain microbes (such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, T. pallidum, or fungi), in which T cell-derived cytokines are responsible for chronic macrophage activation. Tuberculosis is the proto- type of a granulomatous disease caused by infection and should always be excluded as the cause when granulomas are identified. * Granulomas may also develop in some immune- mediated inflammatory diseases, notably Crohn disease, which is one type of inflammatory bowel disease and an impoant cause of granulomatous inflammation in the United States. * They are also seen in a disease of unknown etiology called sarcoidosis, and they develop in response to rela- tively ine foreign bodies (e. g., suture or splinter), forming so-called foreign body granulomas. The formation of a granuloma effectively \"walls off\" the offending agent and is therefore a useful defense mechanism.

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 9/e p206 Antibody-Mediated Diseases (Type II Hypersensitivity) Antibody-mediated (type II) hypersensitivity disorders are caused by antibodies directed against target antigens on the surface of cells or other tissue components. The antigens may be normal molecules intrinsic to cell membranes or in the extracellular matrix, or they may be adsorbed exoge- nous antigens (e. g., a drug metabolite). Antibody-mediated abnormalities are the underlying cause of many human diseases; examples of these are listed in Table 4-3. In all of these disorders, the tissue damage or functional abnormali- ties result from a limited number of mechanisms. Mechanisms of Antibody-Mediated Diseases Antibodies cause disease by targeting cells for phagocyto- sis, by activating the complement system, and by interfer- ing with normal cellular functions (Fig. 4-10). The antibodies that are responsible typically are high-affinity antibodies capable of activating complement and binding to the Fc receptors of phagocytes. * Opsonization and phagocytosis. When circulating cells, such as erythrocytes or platelets, are coated (opsonized) with autoantibodies, with or without complement pro- teins, the cells become targets for phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages (Fig. 4-10, A). These phagocytes express receptors for the Fc tails of IgG anti- bodies and for breakdown products of the C3 comple- ment protein, and use these receptors to bind and ingest opsonized paicles. Opsonized cells are usually elimi- nated in the spleen, and this is why splenectomy is of Table 4-3 Examples of Antibody-Mediated Diseases (Type II Hypersensitivity) clinical benefit in autoimmune thrombocytopenia and some forms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. * Inflammation. Antibodies bound to cellular or tissue anti- gens activate the complement system by the \"classical\" pathway (Fig. 4-10, B). Products of complement activa- tion serve several functions (see Fig. 2-18, Chapter 2), one of which is to recruit neutrophils and monocytes, triggering inflammation in tissues. Leukocytes may also be activated by engagement of Fc receptors, which rec- ognize the bound antibodies. This mechanism of injury is exemplified by Goodpasture syndrome and pemphi- gus vulgaris. * Antibody-mediated cellular dysfunction. In some cases, antibodies directed against cell surface receptors impair or dysregulate cellular function without causing cell injury or inflammation (Fig. 4-10, C). In myasthenia gravis, antibodies against acetylcholine receptors in the motor end plates of skeletal muscles inhibit neuromuscular transmission, with resultant muscle weakness. Antibodies can also stimulate cellular Figure 4-10 Mechanisms of antibody-mediated injury. A, Opsonization of cells by antibodies and complement components, and ingestion of opso- nized cells by phagocytes. B, Inflammation induced by antibody binding to Fc receptors of leukocytes and by complement breakdown products. C, Antireceptor antibodies disturb the normal function of receptors. In these examples, antibodies against the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor activate thyroid cells in Graves disease, and acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antibodies impair neuromuscular transmission in myasthenia g responses excessively. In Graves disease, antibodies against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor stim- ulate thyroid epithelial cells to secrete thyroid hormones, resulting in hypehyroidism. Antibodies against hor- mones and other essential proteins can neutralize and block the actions of these molecules, causing functional derangements.",

The pathways are schematically pre- sented in Figure 3-8; only general principles are discussed here. The coagulation cascade is a successive series of ampli- fying enzymatic reactions. At each step in the process, a proenzyme is proteolyzed to become an active enzyme, which in turn proteolyzes the next proenzyme in the series, eventually leading to the activation of thrombin and the formation of fibrin. Thrombin has a key role, as it acts at numerous points in the cascade (highlighted in Fig. 3-8). Thrombin proteolyzes fibrinogen into fibrin monomers that polymerize into an insoluble gel; this gel encases platelets and other circulating cells in the definitive secondary hemostatic plug. Fibrin polymers are stabilized by the cross-linking activity of factor XIIIa, which also is activated by thrombin. Each reaction in the pathway depends on the assembly of a complex composed of an enzyme (an activated coagula- tion factor), a substrate (a proenzyme form of the next coag- ulation factor in the series), and a cofactor (a reaction accelerator). These components typically are assembled on a phospholipid surface (provided by endothelial cells or platelets) and are held together by interactions that depend on calcium ions (explaining why blood clotting is preventedby calcium chelators). Figure 3-8 The coagulation cascade. Factor IX can be activated by either factor XIa or factor VIIa: In laboratory tests, activation is predominantly dependent on factor XIa, whereas in vivo, factor VIIa appears to be the predominant activator of factor IX. Factors in red boxes represent inactive molecules; activated factors, indicated with a lowercase a, are in green boxes. Note that thrombin (factor IIa) (in light blue boxes) contributes to coagula- tion through multiple positive feedback loops.

Other examples of diseases associated with trinucleotide repeat mutations are Huntington disease and myotonic dystrophy. About 40 diseases are now known to be caused by this type of mutation, and all dis- orders discovered so far are associated with neurodegen- erative changes. In each of these conditions, amplification of specific sets of three nucleotides within the gene disrupts its func- tion. Ceain unique features of trinucleotide repeat muta- tions, described later, are responsible for the atypical pattern of inheritance of the associated diseases. Fragile X syndrome results from a mutation in the FMR1 gene, which maps to Xq27. 3. The syndrome gets its name from the karyotypic appearance of the X chromosome inthe original method of diagnosis: Culturing patient cells in a folate-deficient medium typically revealed a discontinuity of staining or constriction in the long arm of the X chromosome. This method has now been supplanted by DNA-based analysis of triplet repeat size as discussed later. With a frequency of 1 in 1550 for affected males and 1 in 8000 for affected females, fragile X syndrome is the second most common genetic cause of mental retardation, after Down syndrome. Clini- cally affected males have moderate to severe mental retar- dation. The characteristic physical phenotype includes a long face with a large mandible, large eveed ears, and large testicles (macroorchidism). Although characteristic of fragile X syndrome, these abnormalities are not always present or may be quite subtle. The only distinctive physi- cal abnormality that can be detected in at least 90% of postpubeal males with fragile X syndrome is macroorchidism. As with all X-linked diseases, fragile X syndrome pre- dominantly affects males. Analysis of several pedigrees, however, reveals some patterns of transmission not typi- cally associated with other X-linked recessive disorders (Fig. 6-17). These include the following: * Carrier males: Approximately 20% of males who, by ped- igree analysis and by molecular tests, are known to carry a fragile X mutation are clinically and cytogeneti- cally normal. Because carrier males transmit the trait through all their daughters (phenotypically normal) to affected grandchildren, they are called normal transmit- ting males.",

Remnants may persist and give rise to a chordoma. Notogenesis is the development of the notochord by the epiblast(s) that make up the floor of the amnion cavity The notochord forms during gastrulation and soon after induces the ectoderm to form the neural plate (neurulation), synchronizing the development of the neural tube. On the ventral aspect of the neural groove, an axial thickening of the endoderm takes place. This thickening assumes the appearance of a furrow (the chordal furrow) the margins of which come into contact, and so conve it into a solid rod of polygonal-shaped cells (the notochord) which is then separated from the endoderm.",

It is loosely defined as any alteration of the coagulation pathways that predis- poses affected persons to thrombosis, and can be divided into primary (genetic) and secondary (acquired) disorders (Table 3-2). Primary (inherited) hypercoagulability most often is caused by mutations in the factor V and prothrombin genes: * Approximately 2% to 15% of whites carry a specific factor V mutation (called the Leiden mutation, after the Dutch city where it was first described). The mutation alters an amino acid residue in factor V and renders it resistant to protein C. Thus, an impoant antithrom- botic counter-regulatory mechanism is lost. Heterozy- gotes carry a 5-fold increased risk for venous thrombosis, with homozygotes having a 50-fold increased risk. * A single-nucleotide substitution (G to A) in the 3'-untranslated region of the prothrombin gene is a fairly common allele (found in 1% to 2% of the general population). This variant results in increased prothrom- bin transcription and is associated with a nearly three- fold increased risk for venous thromboses. Less common primary hypercoagulable states include inherited deficiencies of anticoagulants such as anti- thrombin III, protein C, or protein S; affected patients typically present with venous thrombosis and recurrent thromboembolism in adolescence or early adult life. Congenitally elevated levels of homocysteine contribute to aerial and venous thromboses (and indeed to the development of atherosclerosis)",

Acute cellular rejection: T cells destroy graft parenchyma (and vessels) by cytotoxicity and inflammatory reactions. Acute humoral rejection: Antibodies damage graft vasculature.
