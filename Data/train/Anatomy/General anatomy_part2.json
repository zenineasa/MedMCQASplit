Although any organ can be affected, brain, heart, kidneys, adrenals, and gastrointestinal tract are most commonly involved. Fibrin thrombi can form in any tissue but typically are most readily visualized in kidney glomeruli. Adrenal cor- tical cell lipid depletion is akin to that seen in all forms of stress and reflects increased utilization of stored lipids for steroid synthesis. While the lungs are resistant to hypoxic injury in hypovolemic shock occurring after hemorrhage, sepsis or trauma can precipitate diffuse alveolar damage (Chapter 12), leading to so-called shock lung. Except for neuronal and cardiomyocyte loss, affected tissues can recover completely if the patient survives.",

It can also be caused by syphilis and ceain fungi. A similar appearance can be associated with histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and coccidioidomycosis. Appearance. Edit In caseous necrosis no histological architecture is preserved. On microscopic examination with H&E staining, it is characterized by acellular pink areas of necrosis surrounded by a granulomatousinflammatory process. When the hilar lymph node for instance is infected with tuberculosis and leads to caseous necrosis, its gross appearance can be a cheesy tan to white, which is why this type of necrosis is often depicted as a combination of both coagulative and liquefactive necrosis. However, in the lung, extensive caseous necrosis with confluent cheesy tan granulomas is typical. The tissue destruction is so extensive that there are areas of cavitation (also known as cystic spaces). See Ghon's complex",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 8/e 523_524 KS is caused by a virus called human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV). KS develops when infected cells that line lymph or blood vessels begin to divide without stopping and spread into surrounding tissues. Whereas most cancers begin in one pa of the body and may later spread to other areas, KS usually appears as lesions (abnormal bumps, spots or patches) on the skin or on mucosal surfaces (such as inside the mouth or in the genitals). Lesions can also develop in other pas of the body, such as in the lungs, lymph nodes or gastrointestinal tract. Having visible KS lesions can be upsetting. Nonetheless, they may develop very slowly without causing any serious complications. If KS is confined to the skin or lymph nodes without causing any swelling, it usually responds very well to treatment with anti-HIV drugs. Infection with HHV-8, the virus which causes KS, is widespread among gay men and in African countries. The virus can be found in saliva and may be passed on during sex, including through wet kissing, oral sex, and using saliva as a lubricant during sex. It can also be spread when adults pre-chew food for infants. There isn't a vaccine to prevent HHV-8 infection. A normally functioning immune system can usually keep HHV-8 infections under control and suppress the abnormal growth of cells into KS lesions. Most people who have HHV-8 never get KS. However, when the immune system is weakened and an unhelpful activation of the immune system in response to HHV-8 occurs, KS may develop. Generally, KS is a rare cancer in people who don't have HIV. Nonetheless, cases do occur in HIV-negative people, paicularly in people who take medications that suppress the immune system (such as coicosteroids). It is also one of the most common cancers in African countries, with large numbers of cases in people who don't have HIV.",

The key steps in this reaction are the production of microbicidal substances within lysosomes and fusion of the lysosomes with phago- somes, thus exposing the ingested paicles to the destruc- tive mechanisms of the leukocytes (Fig. 2-8). The most impoant microbicidal substances are reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lysosomal enzymes. The production of ROS involves the following steps: * Phagocytosis and the engagement of various cellular receptors stimulate an oxidative burst, also called the respiratory burst, which is characterized by a rapid increase in oxygen consumption, glycogen catabolism (glycogenolysis), increased glucose oxidation, and production of ROS. The generation of the oxygen metabolites is due to rapid activation of a leukocyte NADPH oxidase, called the phagocyte oxidase, which oxi- dizes NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleo- tide phosphate) and, in the process, conves oxygen to superoxide ion (O2 * ) (see Fig. 1-18, B, Chapter 1). * Superoxide is then conveed by spontaneous dismuta- tion into hydrogen peroxide (O2 * + 2H+ - H2. O2). These ROS act as free radicals and destroy microbes by mecha- nisms that were described in Chapter 1. * The quantities of H2. O2 produced generally are insuffi- cient to kill most bacteria (although superoxide and hydroxyl radical formation may be sufficient to do so). However, the lysosomes of neutrophils (called azuro- philic granules) contain the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO), and in the presence of a halide such as Cl-, MPO conves H2. O2 to HOCl* (hypochlorous radical). HOCl* is a powerful oxidant and antimicrobial agent (Na. OCl is the active ingredient in chlorine bleach) that kills bacteria by halogenation, or by protein and lipid peroxidation. Founately, the phagocyte oxidase is active only after its cytosolic subunit translocates to the membrane of the pha- golysosome; thus, the reactive end products are generated mainly within the vesicles, and the phagocyte itself is not damaged. H2. O2 is eventually broken down to water and O2 by the actions of catalase, and the other ROS also are degraded (Chapter 1). Reactive nitrogen species, paicu- larly nitric oxide (NO), act in the same way as that described for ROS.",

The sequence of events in the recruitment of leuko- cytes from the vascular lumen to the extravascular space consists of (1) margination and rolling along the vessel wall; (2) firm adhesion to the endothelium; (3) transmigra- tion between endothelial cells; and (4) migration in inter- stitial tissues toward a chemotactic stimulus (Fig. 2-5). Rolling, adhesion, and transmigration are mediated by the interactions of adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial surfaces (see later on). Chemical mediators-- chemoattractants and ceain cytokines--affect these pro- cesses by modulating the surface expression and binding affinity of the adhesion molecules and by stimulating direc- tional movement of the leukocytes. Margination and Rolling. As blood flows from capillaries into postcapillary venules, circulating cells are swept by laminar flow against the vessel wall. Because the smaller red cells tend to move faster than the larger white cells, leukocytes are pushed out of the central axial column and thus have a better oppounity to interact with lining endothelial cells, especially as stasis sets in. This process of leukocyte accumulation at the periphery of vessels is called margination. If the endothelial cells are activated by cytokines and other mediators produced locally, they express adhesion molecules to which the leukocytes attach loosely. These cells bind and detach and thus begin to tumble on the endothelial surface, a process called rolling. Adhesion. The rolling leukocytes are able to sense changes in the endothelium that initiate the next step in the reaction of leukocytes, which is firm adhesion to endothelial sur- faces. This adhesion is mediated by integrins expressed on leukocyte cell surfaces interacting with their ligands on endothelial cells",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 9/e p209 Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), described next, is an illustrative model of T cell-mediated inflammation and tissue injury. The same reactions are the underlying basis for several diseases. Contact dermatitis is an example of tissue injury resulting from T cell-mediated inflammation. It is evoked by contact with pentadecylcatechol (also known as urushiol, the active component of poison ivy and poison oak, which probably becomes antigenic by binding to a host protein). On reexposure of a previously exposed person to the plants, sensitized TH1 CD4+ cells accumulate in the dermis and migrate toward the antigen within the epidermis. Here they release cytokines that damage kera- tinocytes, causing separation of these cells and formation of an intraepidermal vesicle, and inflammation manifested as a vesicular dermatitis. It has long been thought that several systemic diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and mul- tiple sclerosis, are caused by TH1 and TH17 reactions against self antigens, and Crohn disease may be caused by uncon- trolled reactions involving the same T cells but directed against intestinal bacteria. T cell-mediated inflammation also plays a role in the rejection of transplants, described later in the chapter. Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity DTH is a T cell-mediated reaction that develops in response to antigen challenge in a previously sensitized individual. In contrast with immediate hypersensitivity, the DTH reac- tion is delayed for 12 to 48 hours, which is the time it takes for effector T cells to be recruited to the site of antigen chal- lenge and to be activated to secrete cytokines. The classic example of DTH is the tuberculin reaction, elicited by chal- lenge with a protein extract of M. tuberculosis (tuberculin) in a person who has previously been exposed to the tuber- cle bacillus. Between 8 and 12 hours after intracutaneous injection of tuberculin, a local area of erythema and indura- tion appears, reaching a peak (typically 1 to 2 cm in diam- eter) in 24 to 72 hours and thereafter slowly subsiding. On histologic examination, the DTH reaction is characterized by perivascular accumulation (\"cuffing\") of CD4+ helper T cells and macrophages (Fig. 4-13). Local secretion of cyto- kines by these cells leads to increased microvascular per- meability, giving rise to dermal edema and fibrin deposition; the latter is the main cause of the tissue induration in these responses. DTH reactions are mediated primarily by TH1 cells; the contribution of TH17 cells is unclear. The tubercu- lin response is used to screen populations for people who have had previous exposure to tuberculosis and therefore have circulating memory T cells specific for mycobacterial proteins. Notably, immunosuppression or loss of CD4+ T cells (e. g., resulting from HIV infection) may lead to a nega- tive tuberculin response even in the presence of a severe infection. Prolonged DTH reactions against persistent microbes or other stimuli may result in a special morphologic pattern of reaction called granulomatous inflammation. The initial perivascular CD4+ T cell infiltrate is progressively replaced by macrophages over a period of 2 to 3 weeks. These accumulated macrophages typically exhibit morphologic evidence of activation; that is, they become large, flat, and eosinophilic, and are called epithelioid cells. The epitheli- oid cells occasionally fuse under the influence of cytokines (e. g., IFN-g) to form multinucleate giant cells. A micro- scopic aggregate of epithelioid cells, typically surrounded by a collar of lymphocytes, is called a granuloma (Fig. 4-14, A). The process is essentially a chronic form of TH1-mediated inflammation and macrophage activation (Fig. 4-14, B). Older granulomas develop an enclosing rim of fibroblasts and connective tissue. Recognition of a granuloma is of diagnostic impoance because of the limited number of conditions that can cause it (Chapter 2).",

Diseases with Defects in DNA Repair by Homologous Recombination A group of autosomal recessive disorders comprising Bloom syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, and Fanconi anemia is characterized by hypersensitivity to other DNA- damaging agents, such as ionizing radiation (in Bloom syn- drome and ataxia-telangiectasia), or to DNA cross-linking agents, such as nitrogen mustard (in Fanconi anemia). Their phenotype is complex and includes, in addition to predisposition to cancer, features such as neural symptoms (in ataxia-telangiectasia), anemia (in Fanconi anemia), and developmental defects (in Bloom syndrome). The gene mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia is ATM, which encodes a protein kinase that is impoant in recognizing DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation and initiating p53 activation. Evidence for the role of DNA repair genes in the origin of cancer also comes from the study of hereditary breast cancer. Mutations in two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, account for 50% of cases of familial breast cancer. In addi- tion to breast cancer, women with BRCA1 mutations have a substantially higher risk of epithelial ovarian cancers, and men have a slightly higher risk of prostate cancer. Like- wise, mutations in the BRCA2 gene increase the risk of breast cancer in both men and women, as well as cancer of the ovary, prostate, pancreas, bile ducts, stomach, melano- cytes, and B lymphocytes. Although the functions of these genes have not been elucidated fully, cells that lack these genes develop chromosomal breaks and severe aneuploidy. Indeed, both genes seem to function, at least in pa, in the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway. For example, BRCA1 forms a complex with other proteins in the homologous recombination pathway and also is linked to the ATM kinase pathway. BRCA2 was identified as one of several genes mutated in Fanconi anemia, and the BRCA2 protein has been shown to bind to RAD51, a protein required for homologous recombination. Similar to other tumor suppressor genes, both copies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 must be inactivated for cancer to develop. Although linkage of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to familial breast cancers is estab- lished, these genes are rarely inactivated in sporadic cases of breast cancer. In this regard, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are dif- ferent from other tumor suppressor genes, such as APC and TP53, which are inactivated in both familial and spo- radic cancers. ref Robbins 8/e p275; 9/e p314",

It may be seen in disorders ranging from obstetric complications to advanced malignancy. The thrombi are generally microscopic in size, yet so numerous as to often cause circulatory insufficiency, paicularly in the brain, lungs, heart, and kidneys. To complicate matters, the widespread microvascular thrombosis consumes plate- lets and coagulation proteins (hence the synonym con- sumption coagulopathy), and at the same time, fibrinolytic mechanisms are activated.

Each of these molecules is a heterodimer, con- sisting of a polymorphic 44-k. Da a chain noncovalently associated with an invariant 12-k. Da b2-microglobulin polypeptide (encoded by a separate gene on chromo- some 15). The extracellular poion of the a chain contains a cleft where the polymorphic residues are located and where foreign peptides bind to MHC mol- ecules for presentation to T cells, and a conserved region that binds CD8, ensuring that only CD8+ T cells can respond to peptides displayed by class I molecules. In general, class I MHC molecules bind and display pep- tides derived from proteins synthesized in the cyto- plasm of the cell (e. g., viral antigens). Because class I MHC molecules are present on all nucleated cells, all virus-infected cells can be detected and eliminated by CD8+ CTLs. * Class II MHC molecules are encoded by genes in the HLA-D region, which contains at least three subregions: DP, DQ, and DR. Class II MHC molecules are heterodi- mers of noncovalently linked polymorphic a and b sub- units (Fig. 4-3). The extracellular poion of the class II MHC heterodimer contains a cleft for the binding of antigenic peptides and a region that binds CD4. Class II MHC expression is restricted to a few types of cells, mainly APCs (notably, dendritic cells ), macro- phages, and B cells. In general, class II MHC molecules bind to peptides derived from proteins synthesized outside the cell (e. g., those derived from extracellular bacteria) and ingested into the cell. This propey allows CD4+ T cells to recognize the presence of extracellular pathogens and to orchestrate a protective response. * Several other proteins are encoded in the MHC locus, some of which have been called \"class III molecules. \" These include complement components (C2, C3, and Bf) and the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin.

They are found in the peripheral areas of tumors. Russell bodies are thought to have originated as an SOS compament, where abnormal proteins that are not secreted, but have fled intracellular degradation, can gather without blocking normal secretory pathways. The excess immunoglobulin builds up and forms intracytoplasmic globules, which is thought to be a result of insufficient protein transpo within the cell. This causes the proteins to neither be degraded or secreted and stay stored in dilated cisternae. In 1949, Pearse discovered that Russell bodies also contain mucoproteins that are secreted by plasma cells. Russell bodies are not tissue specific; during research they were induced in rat glioma cells. Russell bodies were found to have positive reactions to PAS stain, CD 38 and CD 138 stains. Plasma cellsthat contain Russell bodies and are stained with H&E stain are found to be autofluorescent, while those without Russell bodies are not autofluorescent. Russell bodies tend to be found in places with chronic inflammation. Multiple aggregates of Russell bodies create what are known as Mott cells",

Mitochondria are sensitive to many types of injurious stimuli, including hypoxia, chemi- cal toxins, and radiation. Mitochondrial damage may result in several biochemical abnormalities: * Failure of oxidative phosphorylation leads to progres- sive depletion of ATP, culminating in necrosis of the cell, as described earlier. * Abnormal oxidative phosphorylation also leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species, which have many deleterious effects, described below. * Damage to mitochondria is often associated with the formation of a high-conductance channel in the mito- chondrial membrane, called the mitochondrial permea- bility transition pore. The opening of this channel leads to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potentialand pH changes, fuher compromising oxidative phosphorylation. * The mitochondria also contain several proteins that, when released into the cytoplasm, tell the cell there is internal injury and activate a pathway of apoptosis, dis- cussed later.",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 9/e p206 Antibody-Mediated Diseases (Type II Hypersensitivity) Antibody-mediated (type II) hypersensitivity disorders are caused by antibodies directed against target antigens on the surface of cells or other tissue components. The antigens may be normal molecules intrinsic to cell membranes or in the extracellular matrix, or they may be adsorbed exoge- nous antigens (e. g., a drug metabolite). Antibody-mediated abnormalities are the underlying cause of many human diseases; examples of these are listed in Table 4-3. In all of these disorders, the tissue damage or functional abnormali- ties result from a limited number of mechanisms. Mechanisms of Antibody-Mediated Diseases Antibodies cause disease by targeting cells for phagocyto- sis, by activating the complement system, and by interfer- ing with normal cellular functions (Fig. 4-10). The antibodies that are responsible typically are high-affinity antibodies capable of activating complement and binding to the Fc receptors of phagocytes. * Opsonization and phagocytosis. When circulating cells, such as erythrocytes or platelets, are coated (opsonized) with autoantibodies, with or without complement pro- teins, the cells become targets for phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages (Fig. 4-10, A). These phagocytes express receptors for the Fc tails of IgG anti- bodies and for breakdown products of the C3 comple- ment protein, and use these receptors to bind and ingest opsonized paicles. Opsonized cells are usually elimi- nated in the spleen, and this is why splenectomy is of Table 4-3 Examples of Antibody-Mediated Diseases (Type II Hypersensitivity) clinical benefit in autoimmune thrombocytopenia and some forms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. * Inflammation. Antibodies bound to cellular or tissue anti- gens activate the complement system by the \"classical\" pathway (Fig. 4-10, B). Products of complement activa- tion serve several functions (see Fig. 2-18, Chapter 2), one of which is to recruit neutrophils and monocytes, triggering inflammation in tissues. Leukocytes may also be activated by engagement of Fc receptors, which rec- ognize the bound antibodies. This mechanism of injury is exemplified by Goodpasture syndrome and pemphi- gus vulgaris. * Antibody-mediated cellular dysfunction. In some cases, antibodies directed against cell surface receptors impair or dysregulate cellular function without causing cell injury or inflammation (Fig. 4-10, C). In myasthenia gravis, antibodies against acetylcholine receptors in the motor end plates of skeletal muscles inhibit neuromuscular transmission, with resultant muscle weakness. Antibodies can also stimulate cellular Figure 4-10 Mechanisms of antibody-mediated injury. A, Opsonization of cells by antibodies and complement components, and ingestion of opso- nized cells by phagocytes. B, Inflammation induced by antibody binding to Fc receptors of leukocytes and by complement breakdown products. C, Antireceptor antibodies disturb the normal function of receptors. In these examples, antibodies against the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor activate thyroid cells in Graves disease, and acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antibodies impair neuromuscular transmission in myasthenia g responses excessively. In Graves disease, antibodies against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor stim- ulate thyroid epithelial cells to secrete thyroid hormones, resulting in hypehyroidism. Antibodies against hor- mones and other essential proteins can neutralize and block the actions of these molecules, causing functional derangements.",

The pathways are schematically pre- sented in Figure 3-8; only general principles are discussed here. The coagulation cascade is a successive series of ampli- fying enzymatic reactions. At each step in the process, a proenzyme is proteolyzed to become an active enzyme, which in turn proteolyzes the next proenzyme in the series, eventually leading to the activation of thrombin and the formation of fibrin. Thrombin has a key role, as it acts at numerous points in the cascade (highlighted in Fig. 3-8). Thrombin proteolyzes fibrinogen into fibrin monomers that polymerize into an insoluble gel; this gel encases platelets and other circulating cells in the definitive secondary hemostatic plug. Fibrin polymers are stabilized by the cross-linking activity of factor XIIIa, which also is activated by thrombin. Each reaction in the pathway depends on the assembly of a complex composed of an enzyme (an activated coagula- tion factor), a substrate (a proenzyme form of the next coag- ulation factor in the series), and a cofactor (a reaction accelerator). These components typically are assembled on a phospholipid surface (provided by endothelial cells or platelets) and are held together by interactions that depend on calcium ions (explaining why blood clotting is preventedby calcium chelators).

Factor IX can be activated by either factor XIa or factor VIIa: In laboratory tests, activation is predominantly dependent on factor XIa, whereas in vivo, factor VIIa appears to be the predominant activator of factor IX. Factors in red boxes represent inactive molecules; activated factors, indicated with a lowercase a, are in green boxes. Note that thrombin (factor IIa) (in light blue boxes) contributes to coagula- tion through multiple positive feedback loops.

Other examples of diseases associated with trinucleotide repeat mutations are Huntington disease and myotonic dystrophy. About 40 diseases are now known to be caused by this type of mutation, and all dis- orders discovered so far are associated with neurodegen- erative changes. In each of these conditions, amplification of specific sets of three nucleotides within the gene disrupts its func- tion. Ceain unique features of trinucleotide repeat muta- tions, described later, are responsible for the atypical pattern of inheritance of the associated diseases. Fragile X syndrome results from a mutation in the FMR1 gene, which maps to Xq27. 3. The syndrome gets its name from the karyotypic appearance of the X chromosome inthe original method of diagnosis: Culturing patient cells in a folate-deficient medium typically revealed a discontinuity of staining or constriction in the long arm of the X chromosome. This method has now been supplanted by DNA-based analysis of triplet repeat size as discussed later. With a frequency of 1 in 1550 for affected males and 1 in 8000 for affected females, fragile X syndrome is the second most common genetic cause of mental retardation, after Down syndrome. Clini- cally affected males have moderate to severe mental retar- dation. The characteristic physical phenotype includes a long face with a large mandible, large eveed ears, and large testicles (macroorchidism). Although characteristic of fragile X syndrome, these abnormalities are not always present or may be quite subtle. The only distinctive physi- cal abnormality that can be detected in at least 90% of postpubeal males with fragile X syndrome is macroorchidism. As with all X-linked diseases, fragile X syndrome pre- dominantly affects males. Analysis of several pedigrees, however, reveals some patterns of transmission not typi- cally associated with other X-linked recessive disorders (Fig. 6-17). These include the following: * Carrier males: Approximately 20% of males who, by ped- igree analysis and by molecular tests, are known to carry a fragile X mutation are clinically and cytogeneti- cally normal. Because carrier males transmit the trait through all their daughters (phenotypically normal) to affected grandchildren, they are called normal transmit- ting males.",

Acute cellular rejection: T cells destroy graft parenchyma (and vessels) by cytotoxicity and inflammatory reactions. Acute humoral rejection: Antibodies damage graft vasculature.

Grossly, the kidney may appear unchanged, or it may be abnormally large, pale, gray, and firm; in long-standing cases, the kidney may be reduced in size. Microscopically, the amyloid deposits are found principally in the glomeruli, but they also are present in the interstitial peritubular tissue as well as in the walls of the blood vessels. The glomerulus first develops focal deposits within the mesangial matrix and diffuse or nodular thickenings of the basement membranes of the capillary loops. With progression, the deposition encroaches on the capillary lumina and eventually leads to total obliteration of the vas- cular tuft (Fig. 4-34, A). The interstitial peritubular deposits frequently are associated with the appearance of amorphous pink casts within the tubular lumens, presumably of a pro- teinaceous nature. Amyloid deposits may develop in the walls of blood vessels of all sizes, often causing marked vascular narrowing. renal biopsy is useful in the presence of urinary abnormalities. Rectal and gingival biopsy specimens contain amyloid in as many as 75% of cases with generalized amyloidosis. Examination of abdominal fat aspirates stained with Congo red is a simple, low-risk method.

A type I topoisomerase cuts one strand of a DNA double helix, relaxation occurs, and then the cut strand is re-ligated. Cutting one strand allows the pa of the molecule on one side of the cut to rotate around the uncut strand, thereby reducing stress from too much or too little twist in the helix.

Most of these are members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, which contain in their cytoplasmic regions a conserved \"death domain, \" so named because it mediates interaction with other proteins involved in cell death. The prototypic death receptors are the type I TNF receptor and Fas (CD95). Fas ligand (FasL) is a membrane protein expressed mainly on activated T lymphocytes. When these T cells recognize Fas-expressing targets, Fas molecules are cross-linked by FasL and bind adaptor proteins the death domain. These in turn recruit and activate caspase-8. In many cell types caspase-8 may cleave and activate a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family called Bid, thus feeding into the mitochondrial pathway. The combined activation of both pathways delivers a lethal blow to the cell. Cellular proteins, notably a caspase antagonist called FLIP, block activation of caspases downstream of death receptors. Interestingly, some viruses produce homologues of FLIP, and it is suggested that this is a mechanism that viruses use to keep infected cells alive. The death receptor pathway is involved in elimination of self-reactive lympho- cytes and in killing of target cells by some cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",

At the end of S phase the phosphatase cdc25c dephosphorylates tyrosine15 and this activates the cyclin B/CDK1 complex. Upon activation the complex is shuttled to the nucleus where it serves to trigger for entry into mitosis. However, if DNA damage is detected alternative proteins are activated which results in the inhibitory phosphorylation of cdc25c and therefore cyclinB/CDK1 is not activated. In order for the cell to progress out of mitosis, the degradation of cyclin B is necessary. The cyclin B/CDK1 complex also interacts with a variety of other key proteins and pathways which regulate cell growth and progression of mitosis. Cross-talk between many of these pathways links cyclin B levels indirectly to induction of apoptosis. The cyclin B/CDK1 complex plays a critical role in the expression of the survival signal survivin. Survivin is necessary for proper creation of the mitotic spindlewhich strongly affects cell bility, therefore when cyclin B levels are disrupted cells experience difficulty polarizing. A decrease in survivin levels and the associated mitotic disarray triggers apoptosis caspase 3 mediated pathway.",

The antibodies that are responsible typically are high-affinity antibodies capable of activating complement and binding to the Fc receptors of phagocytes. * Opsonization and phagocytosis. When circulating cells, such as erythrocytes or platelets, are coated (opsonized) with autoantibodies, with or without complement pro- teins, the cells become targets for phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages (Fig. 4-10, A). These phagocytes express receptors for the Fc tails of IgG anti- bodies and for breakdown products of the C3 comple- ment protein, and use these receptors to bind and ingest opsonized paicles. Opsonized cells are usually elimi- nated in the spleen, and this is why splenectomy is ofclinical benefit in autoimmune thrombocytopenia and some forms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. * Inflammation. Antibodies bound to cellular or tissue anti- gens activate the complement system by the \"classical\" pathway (Fig. 4-10, B). Products of complement activa- tion serve several functions (see Fig. 2-18, Chapter 2), one of which is to recruit neutrophils and monocytes, triggering inflammation in tissues. Leukocytes may also be activated by engagement of Fc receptors, which rec- ognize the bound antibodies. This mechanism of injury is exemplified by Goodpasture syndrome and pemphi- gus vulgaris. * Antibody-mediated cellular dysfunction. In some cases, antibodies directed against cell surface receptors impair or dysregulate cellular function without causing cell injury or inflammation (Fig. 4-10, C). In myasthenia gravis, antibodies against acetylcholine receptors in the motor end plates of skeletal muscles inhibit neuromuscular transmission, with resultant muscle weakness. Antibodies can also stimulate cellularresponses excessively. In Graves disease, antibodies against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor stim- ulate thyroid epithelial cells to secrete thyroid hormones, resulting in hypehyroidism. Antibodies against hor- mones and other essential proteins can neutralize and block the actions of these molecules, causing functional derangements.",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 9/e p202 Immediate (Type I) Hypersensitivity Immediate hypersensitivity is a tissue reaction that occurs rapidly (typically within minutes) after the interaction of antigen with IgE antibody that is bound to the surface of mast cells in a sensitized host. The reaction is initiated by entry of an antigen, which is called an allergen because it triggers allergy. Many allergens are environmental substances that are harmless for most persons on exposure. Some people apparently inherit genes that make them susceptible to allergies. This susceptibility is manifested by the propen- sity of such persons to mount strong TH2 responses and, subsequently, to produce IgE antibody against the aller- gens. The IgE is central to the activation of the mast cells and release of mediators that are responsible for the clinical and pathologic manifestations of the reaction. Immediate hypersensitivity may occur as a local reaction that is merely annoying (e. g., seasonal rhinitis, or hay fever), severely debilitating (asthma), or even fatal (anaphylaxis). Sequence of Events in Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Most hypersensitivity reactions follow the same sequence of cellular responses (Fig. 4-7): * Activation of TH2 cells and production of IgE antibody. Aller- gens may be introduced by inhalation, ingestion, or injection. Variables that probably contribute to the strong TH2 responses to allergens include the route of entry, dose, and chronicity of antigen exposure, and the genetic makeup of the host. It is not clear if allergenic substances also have unique structural propeies that endow them with the ability to elicit TH2 responses. Immediate hypersensitivity is the prototypical TH2-mediated reaction. The TH2 cells that are induced secrete several cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which are responsible for essentially all the reactions of immediate hypersensitivity. IL-4 stimulates B cells specific for the allergen to undergo heavy-chain class switching to IgE and to secrete this immunoglobulin isotype. IL-5 acti- vates eosinophils that are recruited to the reaction, and IL-13 acts on epithelial cells and stimulates mucus secre- tion. TH2 cells often are recruited to the site of allergic reactions in response to chemokines that are produced locally; among these chemokines is eotaxin, which also recruits eosinophils to the same site. * Sensitization of mast cells by IgE antibody. Mast cells are derived from precursors in the bone marrow, are widely distributed in tissues, and often reside near blood vessels and nerves and in subepithelial locations. Mast cells described in Chapter 2. Eosinophils are recruited by eotaxin express a high-affinity receptor for the Fc poion of the e heavy chain of IgE, called Fce. RI. Even though the serum concentration of IgE is very low (in the range of 1 to 100 ug/mL), the affinity of the mast cell Fce. RI recep- tor is so high that the receptors are always occupied by IgE. These antibody-bearing mast cells are \"sensitized\" to react if the antigen binds to the antibody molecules. Basophils are the circulating counterpas of mast cells. They also express Fce. RI, but their role in most immedi- ate hypersensitivity reactions is not established (since these reactions occur in tissues and not in the circula- tion). The third cell type that expresses Fce. RI is eosino- phils, which often are present in these reactions and also have a role in IgE-mediated host defense against hel- minth infections, described later. * Activation of mast cells and release of mediators. When a person who was sensitized by exposure to an allergen is reexposed to the allergen, it binds to multiple specific IgE molecules on mast cells, usually at or near the site of allergen entry. When these IgE molecules are cross- linked, a series of biochemical signals is triggered in the mast cells. The signals culminate in the secretion of various mediators from the mast cells. Three groups of mediators are the most impoant in different immediate hypersensitivity reactions (Fig. 4-8): Vasoactive amines released from granule stores. The gran- ules of mast cells contain histamine, which is released within seconds or minutes of activation. Histamine causes vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, and increased secretion of mucus. Other rapidly released mediators include adenosine (which causes bronchoconstriction and inhibits platelet aggregation) and chemotactic factors for neutrophils and eosinophils. Other mast cell granule contents that may be secreted include several neutral proteases (e. g., tryptase), which may damage tissues and also generate kinins and cleave comple- ment components to produce additional chemotactic and inflammatory factors (e. g., C3a) (Chapter 2). The granules also contain acidic proteoglycans (heparin, chondroitin sulfate), the main function of which seems to be as a storage matrix for the amines. Newly synthesized lipid mediators. Mast cells synthesize and secrete prostaglandins and leukotrienes, by the same pathways as do other leukocytes (Chapter 2). These lipid mediators have several actions that are impoant in immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is the most abundant media- tor generated by the cyclooxygenase pathway in mast cells. It causes intense bronchospasm as well as increased mucus secretion. The leukotrienes LTC4 and LTD4 are the most potent vasoactive and spasmo- genic agents known; on a molar basis, they are several thousand times more active than histamine in increas- ing vascular permeability and in causing bronchial smooth muscle contraction. LTB4 is highly chemotac- tic for neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes. Cytokines. Activation of mast cells results in the syn- thesis and secretion of several cytokines that are impoant for the late-phase reaction. These include TNF and chemokines, which recruit and activate leu- kocytes (Chapter 2); IL-4 and IL-5, which amplify th TH2-initiated immune reaction; and IL-13, which stimulates epithelial cell mucus secretion. In summary, a variety of compounds that act on blood vessels, smooth muscle, and leukocytes mediate type I hypersensitivity reactions (Table 4-2). Some of these com- pounds are released rapidly from sensitized mast cells and are responsible for the intense immediate reactions associ- ated with conditions such as systemic anaphylaxis. Others, such as cytokines, are responsible for the inflammation seen in late-phase reactions. Often, the IgE-triggered reaction has two well-defined phases (Fig. 4-9): (1) the immediate response, characterized by vasodilation, vascular leakage, and smooth muscle spasm, usually evident within 5 to 30 minutes after expo- sure to an allergen and subsiding by 60 minutes; and (2) a second, late-phase reaction that usually sets in 2 to 8 hours later and may last for several days and is characterized by inflammation as well as tissue destruction, such as mucosal epithelial cell damage. The dominant inflammatory cells in the late-phase reaction are neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes, especially TH2 cells. Neutrophils are recruited by various chemokines; their roles in inflammation were described in Chapter 2. Eosinophils are recruited by eotaxin. TH2-initiated immune reaction; and IL-13, which stimulates epithelial cell mucus secretion. In summary, a variety of compounds that act on blood vessels, smooth muscle, and leukocytes mediate type I hypersensitivity reactions (Table 4-2). Some of these com- pounds are released rapidly from sensitized mast cells and are responsible for the intense immediate reactions associ- ated with conditions such as systemic anaphylaxis.

Often, the IgE-triggered reaction has two well-defined phases (Fig. 4-9): (1) the immediate response, characterized by vasodilation, vascular leakage, and smooth muscle spasm, usually evident within 5 to 30 minutes after expo- sure to an allergen and subsiding by 60 minutes; and (2) a second, late-phase reaction that usually sets in 2 to 8 hours later and may last for several days and is characterized by inflammation as well as tissue destruction, such as mucosal epithelial cell damage. The dominant inflammatory cells in the late-phase reaction are neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes, especially TH2 cells. Neutrophils are recruited by various chemokines; their roles in inflammation were described in Chapter 2. Eosinophils are recruited by eotaxin",

The binding of ligands - either in the form of adjuvant used in vaccinations or in the form of invasive moieties during times of natural infection - to the TLR marks the key molecular events that ultimately lead to innate immune responses and the development of antigen-specific acquired immunity. Upon activation, TLRs recruit adapter proteins(proteins that mediate other protein-protein interactions) within the cytosol of the immune cell in order to propagate the antigen-induced signal transduction pathway. These recruited proteins are then responsible for the subsequent activation of other downstream proteins, including protein kinases(IKKi, IRAK1, IRAK4, and TBK1) that fuher amplify the signal and ultimately lead to the upregulation or suppression of genes that orchestrate inflammatoryresponses and other transcriptional events. Some of these events lead to cytokine production, proliferation, and survival, while others lead to greater adaptive immunity. If the ligand is a bacterial factor, the pathogen might be phagocytosed and digested, and its antigens presented to CD4+ T cells. In the case of a viral factor, the infected cell may shut off its protein synthesis and may undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). Immune cells that have detected a virus may also release anti-viral factors such as interferons.",

It is distinguished from focal lupus nephritis (class III) by involvement of half or more of glomeruli. Most of the glomeruli show endothelial and mesangial prolifera- tion, leading to diffuse hypercellularity of these structures (Fig. 4-18, B) and producing in some cases epithelial crescents that fill Bowman's space. When extensive, sub- endothelial immune complexes create a circumferential thickening of the capillary wall, resembling rigid \"wire loops\" on routine light microscopy (Fig. 4-18, C).

The antigens may be normal molecules intrinsic to cell membranes or in the extracellular matrix, or they may be adsorbed exoge- nous antigens (e. g., a drug metabolite). Antibody-mediated abnormalities are the underlying cause of many human diseases; examples of these are listed in Table 4-3. In all of these disorders, the tissue damage or functional abnormali- ties result from a limited number of mechanisms. Mechanisms of Antibody-Mediated Diseases Antibodies cause disease by targeting cells for phagocyto- sis, by activating the complement system, and by interfer- ing with normal cellular functions (Fig. 4-10). The antibodies that are responsible typically are high-affinity antibodies capable of activating complement and binding to the Fc receptors of phagocytes. * Opsonization and phagocytosis. When circulating cells, such as erythrocytes or platelets, are coated (opsonized) with autoantibodies, with or without complement pro- teins, the cells become targets for phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages (Fig. 4-10, A). These phagocytes express receptors for the Fc tails of IgG anti- bodies and for breakdown products of the C3 comple- ment protein, and use these receptors to bind and ingest opsonized paicles. Opsonized cells are usually elimi- nated in the spleen, and this is why splenectomy is of Figure 4-10 Mechanisms of antibody-mediated injury.

In many cancer types, mutations affecting EGFR expression or activity could result in cancer. Epidermal growth factor and its receptor was discovered by Stanley Cohen of Vanderbilt University. Cohen shared the 1986 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Rita Levi-Montalcini for their discovery of growth factors. Deficient signaling of the EGFR and other receptor tyrosine kinases in humans is associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's, while over-expression is associated with the development of a wide variety of tumors. Interruption of EGFR signalling, either by blocking EGFR binding sites on the extracellular domain of the receptor or by inhibiting intracellular tyrosine kinase activity, can prevent the growth of EGFR-expressing tumours and improve the patient's condition",

        "exp": "The sacrococcygeal symphysis is an amphiahrodial (slightly mobile) joint, formed between the oval surface at the apex of the sacrum, and the base of the coccyx. The movements which take place between the sacrum and coccyx, and between the different pieces of the latter bone, are forward and backward; they are very limited. Their extent increases during pregnancy. A zygapophyseal joint (or facet joint) is a veebral joint between the superior aicular process of one veebra and the inferior aicular process of the one adjacent. It is of plane synol variety. In fact, all the joints of veebra are plane synol Except the median one- which is a symphysis (as expected *).*All midline joints tend to be symphysis, only very few Exceptions are there. E. g., spheno-occipital joint, which is a synchondrosis. Interveebral discs (or interveebral fibrocailage) lie between adjacent veebrae in the spine. Each disc forms a secondary cailaginous (symphysis) joint to allow slight movement of the veebrae, and acts as a ligament to hold the veebrae together. Discs consist of an outer annulus fibrosus, which surrounds the inner nucleus pulposus. The annulus fibrosus consists of several layers of fibrocailage. The strong annular fibers contain the nucleus pulposus and distribute pressure evenly across the disc. The nucleus pulposus contains loose fibers suspended in a mucoprotein gel the consistency of jelly. The nucleus of the disc acts as a shock absorber, absorbing the impact of the body&; s daily activities and keeping the two veebrae separated. The disc can be likened to a doughnut: whereby the annulus fibrosis is similar to the dough and the nucleus pulposis is the jelly. If one presses down on the front of the doughnut the jelly moves posteriorly or to the back. When one develops a prolapsed disc the jelly/ nucleus pulposis is forced out of the doughnut/ disc and may put pressure on the nerve located near the disc. This will give one the symptoms of sciatica if the disc herniation is at lumbosacral region. There is one disc between each pair of veebrae, Except for the first cervical segment, the atlas. There are a total of twenty-three discs in the spine. When the annulus fibrosus tears due to an injury or the aging process, the nucleus pulposus can begin to extrude through the tear, most commonly postero-lateral. This is called disc herniation. Near the posterior side of each disc, all along the spine, major spinal nerves extend out to different organs, tissues, extremities etc. It is very common for the herniated disc to press against these nerves (pinched nerve) causing radiating pain, numbness, tingling, and diminished strength and/or range of motion. In addition, the contact of the inner nuclear gel, which contains inflammatory proteins, with a nerve can also cause significant pain and muscle spasm. Nerve-related pain is called radicular pain.",

This requirement explains the tropism of the virus for CD4+ T cells and its ability to infect other CD4+ cells, paicularly macrophages and DCs. However, binding to CD4 is not sufficient for infection; the HIV envelope gp120 must also bind to other cell surface molecules (coreceptors) to facilitate cell entry. Two cell surface chemokine receptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, serve this role. HIV envelope gp120 (noncovalently attached to transmembrane gp41) binds initially to CD4 molecules (Fig. 4-27). This binding leads to a conformational change that exposes a new recognition site on gp120 for the core- ceptors CXCR4 (mostly on T cells) or CCR5 (mostly on macrophages). The gp41 then undergoes a conformational change that allows it to inse into the target membrane, and this process facilitates fusion of the virus with the cell. After fusion, the virus core containing the HIV genome enters the cytoplasm of the cell.",

A low height-for-age typically reflects socioeconomic disadvantage. A low weight-for-height, or wasting, usually indicates acute malnutrition. Conversely, a high weight-for-height indicates overweight. Weight-for-age is the most commonly used index of nutritional status, although a low value has limited clinical significance as it does not differentiate between wasting and stunting. Weight-for-age has the advantage of being somewhat easier to measure than indices that require height measurements. In humanitarian emergencies and some field settings, mid-upper arm circumference is used for screening wasted children.",

Follow-up study of survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki disclosed a markedly increased incidence of leukemia--principally myelogenous leukemias--after an average latent period of about 7 years, as well as increased moality rates for thyroid, breast, colon, and lung carcino- mas. The nuclear power accident at Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union continues to exact its toll in the form of high cancer incidence in the surrounding areas. More recently, it is feared that radiation release from a nuclear power plant in Japan damaged by a massive eahquake and tsunami will result in significantly increased cancer incidence in the surrounding geographic areas.

The oncogenic propeies of ionizing radiation are related to its mutagenic effects; it causes chromosome breakage, translocations, and, less frequently, point mutations. Biologically, double- stranded DNA breaks seem to be the most impoant form of DNA damage caused by radiation. The oncogenic effect of UV rays merits special mention because it highlights the impoance of DNA repair in car- cinogenesis. Natural UV radiation derived from the sun can cause skin cancers (melanomas, squamous cell carcino- mas, and basal cell carcinomas). At greatest risk are fair- skinned people who live in locales such as Australia and New Zealand that receive a great deal of sunlight. Non- melanoma skin cancers are associated with total cumula- tive exposure to UV radiation, whereas melanomas are associated with intense intermittent exposure--as occurs with sunbathing. UV light has several biologic effects on cells. Of paicular relevance to carcinogenesis is the ability to damage DNA by forming pyrimidine dimers This type of DNA damage is repaired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway. With extensive exposure to UV light, the repair systems may be overwhelmed, and skin cancer results. As mentioned earlier, patients with the inherited disease xeroderma pigmentosum have a defect in the nucleotide excision repair pathway. As expected, there is a greatly increased predisposition to skin cancers in this disorder.",

The skin is involved in a majority of patients; a characteristic erythematous or maculopapular eruption over the malar eminences and bridge of the nose (\"butterfly pattern\") is observed in approximately half of the cases. Exposure to sunlight (UV light) exacerbates the erythema (so-called photosensitivity), and a similar rash may be present elsewhere on the extremities and trunk, frequently in sun-exposed areas. Histopathologic findings include lique- factive degeneration of the basal layer of the epidermis, edema at the dermoepidermal junction, and mononuclear infiltrates around blood vessels and skin appendages (Fig. 4-19, A). Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals deposi- tion of immunoglobulin and complement at the dermoepi- dermal junction (Fig. 4-19, B); similar immunoglobulin and complement deposits may also be present in apparently unin- volved skin. Joints. Joint involvement is frequent but usually is not associ- ated with striking anatomic changes or with joint deformity. When present, it consists of swelling and a nonspecific mono- nuclear cell infiltration in the synol membranes. Erosion of the membranes and destruction of aicular cailage, such as in RA, are exceedingly rare. CNS. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement also is very common, with focal neurologic deficits and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms. CNS disease often is ascribed to vascular lesions causing ischemia or multifocal cerebral microinfarcts. Small vessel angiopathy with noninflammatory intimal proliferation is the most frequent pathological lesion; frank vasculitis is uncommon. The angiopathy may result from thrombosis caused by antiphospholipid antibodies. Premature atherosclerosis occurs and may contribute to CNS ischemia. Another postulated mechanism for CNS disease is injury from antineuronal antibodies with conse- quent neurologic dysfunction, but this hypothesis remains unproved. Other Organs. The spleen may be moderately enlarged. Capsular fibrous thickening is common, as is follicular hyper- plasia with numerous plasma cells in the red pulp. Central penicilliary aeries characteristically show thickening and perivascular fibrosis, producing onion-skin lesions. Pericardium and pleura, in paicular, are serosal mem- branes that show a variety of inflammatory changes in SLE ranging (in the acute phase) from serous effusions to fibrinous exudates that may progress to fibrous opacification in the chronic stage. Involvement of the heart is manifested primarily in the form of pericarditis. Myocarditis, in the form of a nonspecific mononuclear cell infiltrate, and valvular lesions, called Libman-Sacks endocarditis, also occur but are less common in the current era of aggressive coicosteroid therapy. This nonbacterial verrucous endocarditis takes the form of irregular, 1- to 3-mm way deposits, seen as distinctive lesions on either surface of the leaflets (i. e., on the surface exposed to the forward flow of the blood or on the underside of the leaflet) (see Chapter 10). An increasing number of patients also show clinical and anatomic manifes- tations of coronary aery disease. The basis of accelerated atherosclerosis is not fully understood, but the process seems to be multifactorial; ceainly, immune complexes can deposit in the coronary vasculature, leading to endothelial damage by that pathway. Moreover, glucocoicoid treatment causes alterations in lipid metabolism, and renal disease (common in SLE) causes hypertension; both of these are risk factors for atherosclerosis (Chapter 9). Many other organs and tissues may be involved. The changes consist essentially of acute vasculitis of the small vessels, foci of mononuclear infiltrations, and fibrinoid deposit Absence of IgG The serum electrophoretic pattern of the patient showed absence of immunoglobulin G and an increase of the IgA and IgM precipitation bands",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 7/e p273_274; 9/e p271 CHARACTERISTICS OF BENIGN AND MALIGNANT NEOPLASMS Nothing is more impoant to the patient with a tumor than being told: \"It is benign. \" In general, benign tumors appear to be genetically \"simple, \" harboring fewer muta- tions than cancers, and genetically stable, changing little in genotype over time. The latter feature probably explains why benign tumors such as lipomas and leiomyomas transform to malignancies rarely, if at all. In practice, the determination of benign versus malignant is made with remarkable accuracy using long-established clinical and anatomic criteria, but some neoplasms defy easy character- ization. Ceain features may indicate innocence, and others may indicate malignancy. Such problems are not the rule, however, and there are four fundamental features by which benign and malignant tumors can be distinguished: dif- ferentiation and anaplasia, rate of growth, local invasion, and metastasis. Differentiation and Anaplasia Differentiation and anaplasia are characteristics seen only in the parenchymal cells that constitute the transformed elements of neoplasms. The differentiation of parenchymal tumor cells refers to the extent to which they resemble their normal forebears morphologically and functionally. * Benign neoplasms are composed of well-differentiated cells that closely resemble their normal counterpas. A lipoma is made up of mature fat cells laden with cytoplasmic lipid vacuoles, and a chondroma is made up of mature cailage cells that synthesize their usual cailaginous matrix--evidence of morphologic and functional differentiation. In well-differentiated benign tumors, mitoses are usually rare and are of normal configuration. * Malignant neoplasms are characterized by a wide range of parenchymal cell differentiation, from sur- prisingly well differentiated (Fig. 5-3) to completel undifferentiated. For example, well-differentiated ade- nocarcinomas of the thyroid may contain normal- appearing follicles. Such tumors sometimes may be difficult to distinguish from benign proliferations. Between the two extremes lie tumors loosely referred to as moderately well differentiated. The stroma carrying the blood supply is crucial to the growth of tumors but does not aid in the separation of benign from malignant ones. The amount of stromal connective tissue does deter- mine, however, the consistency of a neoplasm. Ceain cancers induce a dense, abundant fibrous stroma (des- moplasia), making them hard, so-called scirrhous tumors. * Malignant neoplasms that are composed of undiffer- entiated cells are said to be anaplastic. Lack of differen- tiation, or anaplasia, is considered a hallmark of malignancy. The term anaplasia literally means \"back- ward formation\"--implying dedifferentiation, or loss of the structural and functional differentiation of normal cells. It is now known, however, that at least some cancers arise from stem cells in tissues; in these tumors, failure of differentiation, rather than dedifferentiation of specialized cells, accounts for their undifferentiated appearance. Recent studies also indicate that in some cases, dedifferentiation of apparently mature cells does occur during carcinogenesis. Anaplastic cells display marked pleomorphism (i. e., variation in size and shape) (Fig. 5-4). Often the nuclei are extremely hyperchromatic (dark-staining) and large resulting in an increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio that may approach 1: 1 instead of the normal 1: 4 or 1: 6. Giant cells that are considerably larger than their neighbors may be formed and possess either one enormous nucleus or several nuclei. Anaplastic nuclei are variable and bizarre in size and shape. The chromatin is coarse and clumped, and nucle- oli may be of astounding size. More impoant, mitoses often are numerous and distinctly atypical; anarchic multi- ple spindles may produce tripolar or quadripolar mitotic figures (Fig. 5-5). Also, anaplastic cells usually fail to develop recognizable patterns of orientation to one another (i. e., they lose normal polarity). They may grow Figure 5-3 Well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. The tumor cells are strikingly similar to normal squamous epithelial cells, with intercellular bridges and nests of keratin (arrow). (Couesy of Dr. Trace Worrell, Depament of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, Texas.) Figure 5-4 Anaplastic tumor of the skeletal muscle (rhabdomyosar- coma). Note the marked cellular and nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchro- matic nuclei, and tumor giant cells. (Couesy of Dr. Trace Worrell, Depa in sheets, with total loss of communal structures, such as glands or stratified squamous architecture. The more differentiated the tumor cell, the more com- pletely it retains the functional capabilities of its normal counterpas. Benign neoplasms and even well-differenti- ated cancers of endocrine glands frequently elaborate the hormones characteristic of their origin. Well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas produce keratin (Fig. 5-3), just as well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas secrete bile. In other instances, unanticipated functions emerge. Some cancers may elaborate fetal proteins not produced by comparable cells in the adult. Cancers of nonendocrine origin may produce so-called ectopic hormones. For example, ceain lung carcinomas may produce adrenocor- ticotropic hormone (ACTH), parathyroid hormone-like hormone, insulin, glucagon, and others. More is said about these phenomena later. Despite exceptions, the more rapidly growing and the more anaplastic a tumor, the less likely it is to have specialized functional activity. Of relevance in the discussion of differentiation and ana- plasia is dysplasia, referring to disorderly but non-neoplastic proliferation. Dysplasia is encountered principally in epi- thelial lesions. It is a loss in the uniformity of individual cells and in their architectural orientation. Dysplastic cells exhibit considerable pleomorphism and often possess hyperchro- matic nuclei that are abnormally large for the size of the cell. Mitotic figures are more abundant than usual and frequently appear in abnormal locations within the epithe- lium. In dysplastic stratified squamous epithelium, mitoses are not confined to the basal layers, where they normally occur, but may be seen at all levels and even in surface cells. There is considerable architectural anarchy. For example, the usual progressive maturation of tall cells in the basal layer to flattened squames on the surface may be lost and replaced by a disordered scrambling of dark basal- appearing cells (Fig. 5-6). When dysplastic changes are marked and involve the entire thickness of the epithelium, the lesion is referred to as carcinoma in situ, a preinvasive stage of cancer (Chapter 18). Although dysplastic changes often are found adjacent to foci of malignant transforma- tion, and long-term studies of cigarette smokers show that epithelial dysplasia almost invariably antedates the appear- ance of cancer, the term dysplasia is not synonymous with cancer; mild to moderate dysplasias that do not involve the entire thickness of the epithelium sometimes regress completely, par- ticularly if inciting causes are removed.",

        "exp": "The cause of sacrococcygeal teratomas is unknown. Sacrococcygeal teratomas are germ cell tumors. Germ cells are the cells that develop into the embryo and later on become the cells that make up the reproductive system of men and women. Most germ cell tumors occur in the testes or ovaries (gonads) or the lower back. When these tumors occur outside of the gonads, they are known as extragonadal tumors. Researchers do not know how extragonadal germ cell tumors form. One theory suggests that germ cells accidentally migrate during to unusual locations early during the development of the embryo (embryogenesis). Normally, such misplaced germ cells degenerate and die, but in cases of extragonadal teratomas researchers speculate that these cells continue to undergo mitosis, the process where cells divide and multiply, eventually forming a teratoma. Sacrococcygeal teratomas are thought to arise from an area under the coccyx called \"Henson's Node\". This is an area where primitive cells persist (germ cells) that can give rise to cells of the three major tissue layers of an embryo: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. These embryonic layers eventually give rise to the various cells and structures of the body. Sacrococcygeal teratomas can contain mature tissue that looks like any tissue in the body, or immature tissue resembling embryonic tissues. Ref- <a href=\"",

The women may present with acute pain in the lateral aspect of breast or the anterior chest wall. A tender cordlike superficial thrombosed vein is formed and when the skin over the breast is stretched by raising the arm, a narrow r shallow subcutaneous groove alongside the cord becomes apparent, Rarely it may be bilateral. Management It's a benign self-limited disorder. The differential diagnosis is lymphatic permeation from an occult carcinoma of the breast. When the diagnosis is unceain or a mass is present near the cord, a biopsy may be done.

        "question": "Most sensitive test for screening of \" SLE\" is",
        "exp": "Ref Robbins 9/e p219, 8/e p214, 7/e p228 Spectrum of Autoantibodies in SLE Antibodies have been identified against a host of nuclear and cytoplasmic components of the cell that are specific to neither organs nor species. Another group of antibodies is directed against surface antigens of blood cells, while yet another is reactive with proteins in complex with phospho- lipids (antiphospholipid antibodies) (Chapter 3). * Antinuclear antibodies. ANAs are directed against several nuclear antigens and can be grouped into four catego- ries: (1) antibodies to DNA, (2) antibodies to histones, (3) antibodies to nonhistone proteins bound to RNA, and (4) antibodies to nucleolar antigens. Table 4-10 lists several autoantibodies, including ANAs, and their asso- ciation with SLE as well as with other autoimmune dis- eases, to be discussed later. The most widely used method of detecting ANAs is the indirect immunofluo- rescence assay (IFA), which screens for autoantibodies that bind to a variety of nuclear antigens, including DNA, RNA, and proteins. Four staining patterns are seen with IFA: homogeneous or diffuse, rim or periph- eral, speckled, and nucleolar. While each pattern can be suggestive of the presence of specific autoantibodies, the strength of these associations is limited and should not be relied on. ANA testing by IFA is extremely sensitive, as more than 95% of patients with SLE will test positive, but the test's specificity is quite limited, because patients with other autoimmune diseases, chronic infections, and cancer will test positive as well. Fuhermore, ANAs are seen in approximately 5% to 15% of healthy people, and the incidence increases with age. Recently, the IFA has been replaced in many clinical laboratories by multiplex flow cytometry immunoassays that can simultaneously test for multiple specific autoantibodies, but these assays may lack the sensitivity of the IFA. Antibodies to double- stranded DNA (ds. DNA) and the so-called Smith (Sm) antigen can be detected by ELISA or multiplex flow methods and are specific for SLE. * Other autoantibodies. Antibodies against blood cells, including red cells, platelets, and lymphocytes, are found in many patients. Antiphospholipid antibodies are present in 40% to 50% of patients with lupus and react with a wide variety of proteins in complex with phospholipids. Some bind to cardiolipin antigen, used in serologic tests for syphilis, so patients with lupus may have a false-positive test result for syphilis. Antiphos- pholipid antibodies contribute to coagulation abnormal- ities, which are described below. Mechanisms of Tissue Injury Regardless of the exact sequence by which autoantibodies are formed, they are likely to be the mediators of tissue injury, probably through multiple mechanisms. * Most organ damage in SLE is caused by immune complex deposition. Skin and kidney biopsies from patients with SLE typically demonstrate diffuse and heavy granular deposits of complement and immunoglobulin. Autoan- tibodies complexed with DNA can be detected as well. These deposits of immune complexes had been thought to cause tissue damage by activating the classical com- plement pathway (type III hypersensitivity); 75% of patients will have reduced serum levels of C3 and C4 at the time of SLE flares, presumably because complement is being activated and consumed faster than it can be produced. However, people and rodents deficient in C1q are not protected from SLE and actually can spon- taneously develop SLE, raising the possibility that complement-independent mechanisms may also con- tribute to tissue damage. * Autoantibodies of different specificities contribute to the pathology and clinical manifestations of SLE (type II hyper- sensitivity). Autoantibodies against red cells, white cells, and platelets opsonize these cells and lead to their phagocy- tosis, resulting in cytopenias. Autoantibodies against various phospholipids lead to increased thrombosis in patients, with varied clinical consequences, including recurrent spontaneous aboion and thrombotic epi- sodes. These disorders are pa of the antiphospholipid syndrome. Paradoxically, these antibodies interfere with clotting tests and are actually called \"lupus anticoagu- lants. \" Autoantibodies are also produced against clot- ting factors such as thrombin, and these too may contribute to clotting disorders. Autoantibodies against central nervous system receptors for various neurotransmit- ters have been implicated in the neuropsychiatric com- plications of the disease. * There is no evidence that ANAs can permeate intact cells. However, if cell nuclei are exposed, the ANAs can bind to them. In tissues, nuclei of damaged cells react with ANAs, lose their chromatin pattern, and become homogeneous, to produce so-called LE bodies or hema- toxylin bodies. An in vitro correlate of this is the LE cell, a neutrophil or macrophage that has engulfed the dena- tured nucleus of another injured cell. When blood is withdrawn and agitated, a number of leukocytes are sufficiently damaged to expose their nuclei to ANAs, with secondary complement activation; these antibody- and complement-opsonized nuclei are then readily phagocytosed. Although the LE cell test is positive in as many as 70% of patients with SLE, it is now largely of historical interest.",

The protein made by the APC gene plays a critical role in several cellular processes that determine whether a cell may develop into a tumor. The APC protein helps control how often a cell divides, how it attaches to other cells within a tissue, how the cell polarizes and the morphogenesis of the 3D structures, or whether a cell moves within or away from a tissue. This protein also helps ensure that the chromosome number in cells produced through cell division is correct. The APC protein accomplishes these tasks mainly through association with other proteins, especially those that are involved in cell attachment and signaling. The activity of one protein in paicular, beta-catenin, is controlled by the APC protein (see: Wnt signaling pathway). Regulation of beta-catenin prevents genes that stimulate cell division from being turned on too often and prevents cell overgrowth. The human APC gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 in band q22. 2 (5q22. 2). The APCgene has been shown to contain an internal ribosome entry site.

Once there, leukocytes clear the invaders and begin the process of digesting and getting rid of necrotic tissues. Acute inflammation has two major components (Fig. 2-2): * Vascular changes: alterations in vessel caliber resulting in increased blood flow (vasodilation) and changes in the vessel wall that permit plasma proteins to leave the cir- culation (increased vascular permeability). In addition, endothelial cells are activated, resulting in increased adhesion of leukocytes and migration of the leukocytes through the vessel wall. * Cellular events: emigration of the leukocytes from the circulation and accumulation in the focus of injury (cel- lular recruitment), followed by activation of the leuko- cytes, enabling them to eliminate the offending agent. The principal leukocytes in acute inflammation are neu- trophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes). Stimuli for Acute Inflammation Acute inflammatory reactions may be triggered by a variety of stimuli: * Infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic) are among the most common and medically impoant causes of inflammation. * Trauma (blunt and penetrating) and various physical and chemical agents (e. g., thermal injury, such as burns or frostbite; irradiation; toxicity from ceain environ- mental chemicals) injure host cells and elicit inflamma- tory reactions. * Tissue necrosis (from any cause), including ischemia (as in a myocardial infarct) and physical and chemical injury * Foreign bodies (splinters, di, sutures, crystal deposits * Immune reactions (also called hypersensitivity reactions) against environmental substances or against \"self\" tissues. Because the stimuli for these inflammatory responses often cannot be eliminated or avoided, such reactions tend to persist, with features of chronic inflam- mation. The term \"immune-mediated inflammatory disease\" is sometimes used to refer to this group of disorders. Although each of these stimuli may induce reactions with some distinctive characteristics, in general, all inflamma- tory reactions have the same basic features. In this section, we describe first how inflammatory stimuli are recognized by the host, then the typical reac- tions of acute inflammation and its morphologic features, and finally the chemical mediators responsible for these reactions.",

It induces chemotaxis in target cells, primarily neutrophils but also other granulocytes, causing them to migrate toward the site of infection. IL-8 also stimulates phagocytosis once they have arrived. IL-8 is also known to be a potent promoter of angiogenesis. In target cells, IL-8 induces a series of physiological responses required for migration and phagocytosis, such as increases in intracellular Ca2+, exocytosis (e. g. histamine release), and the respiratory burst. IL-8 can be secreted by any cells with toll-like receptors that are involved in the innate immune response. Usually, it is the macrophages that see an antigen first, and thus are the first cells to release IL-8 to recruit other cells. Both monomer and homodimerforms of IL-8 have been repoed to be potent inducers of the chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. The homodimer is more potent, but methylation of Leu25 can block the activity of homodimers.",

Immunologically, the disease is associ- ated with an enormous array of autoantibodies, classically including antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). The clinical pre- sentation of SLE is so variable, with so many overlapping features with those of other autoimmune diseases (RA, polymyositis, and others), that it has been necessary to develop diagnostic criteria for SLE (Table 4-9). The diag- nosis is established by demonstration of four or more of the criteria during any interval of observation.
