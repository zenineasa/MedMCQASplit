Serum creatinine levels often remain within normal limits despite a decrease in GFR because older adults generally have less muscle mass and are generally less physically active than younger adults and thus produce less creatinine.

        "exp": "steps: (1) migration and proliferation of fibroblasts into the site of injury and (2) deposition of ECM proteins produced by these cells. The recruitment and activation of fibroblasts to syn- thesize connective tissue proteins are driven by many growth factors, including PDGF, FGF-2 (described earlier), and TGF-b. The major source of these factors is inflamma- tory cells, paicularly macrophages, which are present at sites of injury and in granulation tissue. Sites of inflamma- tion are also rich in mast cells, and in the appropriate chemotactic milieu, lymphocytes may be present as well. Each of these cell types can secrete cytokines and growth factors that contribute to fibroblast proliferation and activation. As healing progresses, the number of proliferating fibroblasts and new vessels decreases; however, the fibro- blasts progressively assume a more synthetic phenotype, so there is increased deposition of ECM. Collagen synthe- sis, in paicular, is critical to the development of strength in a healing wound site. As described later, collagen syn- thesis by fibroblasts begins early in wound healing (days 3 to 5) and continues for several weeks, depending on the size of the wound. Net collagen accumulation, however, depends not only on increased synthesis but also on diminished collagen degradation (discussed later). Ulti- mately, the granulation tissue evolves into a scar composed of largely inactive, spindle-shaped fibroblasts, dense collagen, fragments of elastic tissue, and other ECM com- ponents (Fig. 2-30, B). As the scar matures, there is proA A gressive vascular regression, which eventually transforms the highly vascularized granulation tissue into a pale, largely avascular scar. Growth Factors Involved in ECM Deposition and Scar Formation Many growth factors are involved in these processes, including TGF-b, PDGF, and FGF. Because FGF also is involved in angiogenesis, it was described earlier. Here we briefly describe the major propeies of TGF-b and PDGF. * Transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) belongs to a family of homologous polypeptides (TGF-b1, -b2, and -b3) that includes other cytokines such as bone morphogenetic proteins. The TGF-b1 isoform is widely distributed and is usually referred to as TGF-b. The active factor binds to two cell surface receptors with serine-threonine kinase activity, triggering the phosphorylation of transcription factors called Smads. TGF-b has many and often oppo- site effects, depending on the cell type and the metabolic state of the tissue. In the context of inflammation and repair, TGF-b has two main functions: TGF-b stimulates the production of collagen, fibro- nectin, and proteoglycans, and it inhibits collagen degradation by both decreasing proteinase activity and increasing the activity of tissue inhibitors of pro- teinases known as TIMPs (discussed later on). TGF-b is involved not only in scar formation after ref Robbins 9/e p83",

The best-characterized is an autosomal recessive condition called familial Mediterranean fever. This is a febrile disorder characterized by attacks of fever ccompanied by inflammation of serosal surfaces, includ- ing peritoneum, pleura, and synol membrane. This dis- order is encountered largely in persons of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins. It is associated with widespread tissue involvement indistinguishable from reactive systemic amyloidosis. The amyloid fibril proteins are made up of AA proteins, suggesting that this form of amyloidosis is related to the recurrent bouts of inflamma- tion that characterize this disease. The gene for familial Mediterranean fever is called pyrin and encodes a protein that is a component of the inflammasome (Chapter 2). Patients have gain-of-function mutations in pyrin that result in constitutive overproduction of the pro- inflammatory cytokine IL-1 and persistent inflammation. In contrast with familial Mediterranean fever, a group of autosomal dominant familial disorders is characterized by deposition of amyloid predominantly in the peripheral and autonomic nerves. These familial amyloidotic poly- neuropathies have been described in kindreds in different pas of the world--for example, in Pougal, Japan, Sweden, and the United States.

Macrophages and cells belonging to the monocyte-macrophage lineage (microglial cells) are the predominant cell types in the brain that are infected with HIV. The virus is most likely carried into the brain by infected monocytes (thus, brain HIV isolates are almost exclusively of the R5 type). The mechanism of HIV-induced damage of the brain, however, remains obscure. Because neurons are not infected by HIV, and the extent of neuro- pathologic changes is often less than might be expected from the severity of neurologic symptoms, most expes believe that the neurologic deficit is caused indirectly by viral products and soluble factors (e. g., cytokines such as TNF) produced by macrophages and microglial cells.

        "question": "An example of tumor suppressor gene is",
        "exp": "Ref Robbins 7/e p300;, Harrison 17/e p499; 9/e p290 Tumor suppressor genes are the genes whose products down regulate the cell cycle. RB Gene: Governor of the Cell Cycle It is useful to begin with the retinoblastoma gene (RB), the first tumor suppressor gene to be discovered and, as it happens, a prototypical representative. As with many advances in medicine, the discovery of tumor suppressor genes was accomplished by the study of a rare disease--in this case, retinoblastoma, an uncommon childhood tumor. Approximately 60% of retinoblastomas are sporadic, and the remaining ones are familial, the predisposition to develop the tumor being transmitted as an autosomal dom- inant trait. To account for the sporadic and familial occur- rence of an identical tumor, Knudson, in 1974, proposed his now famous two-hit hypothesis, which in molecular terms can be stated as follows: * Two mutations (hits) are required to produce retinoblas- toma. These involve the RB gene, which has been mapped to chromosomal locus 13q14. Both of the normal alleles of the RB locus must be inactivated (hence the two hits) for the development of retinoblastoma (Fig. 5-21). * In familial cases, children inherit one defective copy of the RB gene in the germ line; the other copy is normal. brakes to cellular proliferation Rb gene is a tumor suppressor gene whereas My, fos and Ra's are all example of proto oncogene Retinoblastoma develops when the normal RB gene is lost in retinoblasts as a result of somatic mutation. Because in retinoblastoma families only a single somatic mutation is required for expression of the disease, the familial transmission follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. * In sporadic cases, both normal RB alleles are lost by somatic mutation in one of the retinoblasts. The end result is the same: a retinal cell that has lost both of the normal copies of the RB gene becomes cancerous. Although the loss of normal RB genes initially was discovered in retinoblastomas, it is now evident that homo- zygous loss of this gene is a fairly common feature of several tumors, including breast cancer, small cell cancer of the lung, and bladder cancer. Patients with familial retinoblastoma also are at greatly increased risk for development of osteosarcomas and some soft tissue sarcoma The RB gene product is a DNA-binding protein that is expressed in every cell type examined, where it exists in an active hypophosphorylated state and an inactive hyperphosphor- ylated state. The impoance of Rb lies in its regulation of the G1/S checkpoint, the poal through which cells must pass before DNA replication commences. As background for an understanding of how tumor sup- pressors function, it is useful to briefly revisit the cell cycle: In embryos, cell divisions proceed at an amazing clip, with DNA replication beginning immediately after mitosis ends. As development proceeds, however, two gaps are incorpo- rated into the cell cycle: gap 1 (G1) between mitosis (M) and DNA replication (S), and gap 2 (G2) between DNA replica- tion (S) and mitosis (M) (Fig. 5-20). Although each phase of the cell cycle circuitry is monitored carefully, the transi- tion from G1 to S is believed to be an extremely impoant checkpoint in the cell cycle \"clock. \" Once cells cross the G1 checkpoint they can pause the cell cycle for a time, but they are obligated to complete mitosis. In G1, however, cells can remove themselves entirely from the cell cycle, either tem- porarily (quiescence, or G0) or permanently (senescence). Indeed, during development, as cells become terminally differentiated, they exit the cell cycle and enter G0. Cells in G0 remain there until external cues, such as mitogenic sig- naling, push them back into the cell cycle. In G1, therefore, diverse signals are integrated to determine whether the cell should progress through the cell cycle, or exit the cell cycle and differentiate, and Rb is a key hub integrating external mitogenic and differentiation signals to make this decision. To appreciate this crucial role of Rb in the cell cycle, it is helpful to review the mechanisms that enforce the G1/S transition. * The initiation of DNA replication (S phase) requires the activity of cyclin E/CDK2 complexes, and expression of cyclin E is dependent on the E2F family of transcription factors. Early in G1, Rb is in its hypophosphorylated active form, and it binds to and inhibits the E2F family of transcription factors, preventing transcription of cyclin E. Hypophosphorylated Rb blocks E2F-mediated transcription in at least two ways (Fig. 5-22). First, it sequesters E2F, preventing it from interacting with other transcriptional activators. Second, Rb recruits chromatin remodeling proteins, such as histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases, which bind to the promoters of E2F-responsive genes such as cyclin E. These enzymes modify chromatin at the promoters to make DNA insen- sitive to transcription factors. This situation is changed on mitogenic signaling. Growth factor signaling leads to cyclin D expression and activa- tion of cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes. These complexes phosphorylate Rb, inactivating the protein and releasing E2F to induce target genes such as cyclin E. Expression of cyclin E then stimulates DNA replication and pro- gression through the cell cycle. When the cells enter S phase, they are committed to divide without additional growth factor stimulation. During the ensuing M phase, the phosphate groups are removed from Rb by cellular phosphatases, regenerating the hypophosphorylated form of Rb. * E2F is not the sole target of Rb. The versatile Rb protein binds to a variety of other transcription factors that regulate cell differentiation. For example, Rb stimulates myocyte-, adipocyte-, melanocyte-, and macrophage- specific transcription factors. Thus, the Rb pathway couples control of cell cycle progression at G0-G1 with differentiation, which may explain how differentiation is associated with exit from the cell cycle. In view of the centrality of Rb to the control of the cell cycle, an interesting question is why RB is not mutated in every cancer. In fact, mutations in other genes that control Rb phosphorylation can mimic the effect of RB loss; such genes are mutated in many cancers that seem to have normal RB genes. For example, mutational activation of CDK4 or overexpression of cyclin D ors cell proliferation by facil- itating Rb phosphorylation and inactivation. Indeed, cyclin D is overexpressed in many tumors because of gene ampli- fication or translocation. Mutational inactivation of CDKIs also would drive the cell cycle by unregulated activation of cyclins and CDKs. As mentioned earlier, the CDKN2A gene is an extremely common target of deletion or muta- tional inactivation in human tumors. The emerging paradigm is that loss of normal cell cycle control is central to malignant transformation and that at least one of the four key regulators of the cell cycle (CDKN2A, cyclin D, CDK4, Rb) is mutated in most human cancers. Fuhermore, the transforming proteins of several oncogenic human DNA viruses act, in pa, by neutralizing the growth inhibi- tory activities of Rb. For example, the human papillomavi- rus (HPV) E7 protein binds to the hypophosphorylated form of Rb, preventing it from inhibiting the E2F transcrip- tion factors. Thus, Rb is functionally deleted, leading to uncontrolled growth",

        "exp": "ref Robbins 8/e p45, 9/ep74 Several mechanisms may contribute to increased vascu- lar permeability in acute inflammatory reactions: * Endothelial cell contraction leading to intercellular gaps in postcapillary venules is the most common cause of increased vascular permeability. Endothelial cell con- traction occurs rapidly after binding of histamine, bra- dykinin, leukotrienes, and many other mediators to specific receptors, and is usually sho-lived (15 to 30 minutes). A slower and more prolonged retraction of endothelial cells, resulting from changes in the cytoskel- eton, may be induced by cytokines such as tumor necro- sis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1). This reaction may take 4 to 6 hours to develop after the initial trigger and persist for 24 hours or more. * Endothelial injury results in vascular leakage by causing endothelial cell necrosis and detachment. Endothelial cells are damaged after severe injury such as with burns and some infections. In most cases, leakage begins immediately after the injury and persists for several hours (or days) until the damaged vessels are throm- bosed or repaired. Venules, capillaries, and aerioles can all be affected, depending on the site of the injury. Direct injury to endothelial cells may also induce a delayed prolonged leakage that begins after a delay of 2 to 12 hours, lasts for several hours or even days, and involves venules and capillaries. Examples are mild to moderate thermal injury, ceain bacterial toxins, and x- or ultraviolet irradiation (i. e., the sunburn that has spoiled many an evening after a day in the sun). Endo- thelial cells may also be damaged as a consequence of leukocyte accumulation along the vessel wall. Activated leukocytes release many toxic mediators, discussed later, that may cause endothelial injury or detachment.",

As described previously, hamaomas are disorganized, tumor-like growths composed of mature cell types normally present at the site at which the polyp develops. Hamaomatous polyposis syndromes are rare, but they are impoant to recognize because of associated intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations and the need to screen family members. Juvenile Polyps Juvenile polyps are the most common type of hamaoma- tous polyp. They may be sporadic or syndromic. In adults, the sporadic form sometimes is also referred to as an inflam- matory polyp, paicularly when dense inflammatory infil- trates are present. The vast majority of juvenile polyps occur in children younger than 5 years of age. Juvenile polyps characteristically are located in the rectum, and most manifest with rectal bleeding. In some cases, prolapse occurs and the polyp protrudes through the anal sphincter. Sporadic juvenile polyps are usually solitary but in persons with the autosomal dominant syndrome of juvenile pol- yposis the number varies from 3 to as many as 100. Colec- tomy may be required to limit the hemorrhage associated with polyp ulceration in juvenile polyposis.

        "exp": "ref Robbins 9/e p97-78 a granuloma is an organized collection of macrophages. In medical practice, doctors occasionally use the term \"granuloma\" in its more literal meaning: \"a small nodule\". Since a small nodule can represent anything from a harmless nevus to a malignant tumor, this usage of the term is not very specific. Examples of this use of the term granuloma are the lesions known as vocal cord granuloma (known as contact granuloma), pyogenic granuloma and intubation granuloma, all of which are examples of granulation tissue, not granulomas. \"Pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma\" is a lesion characterized by keloid-like fibrosis in the lung, and is not granulomatous. Similarly, radiologists often use the term granuloma when they see a calcified nodule on X-ray or CT scan of the chest. They make this assumption since granulomas usually contain calcium, although the cells that form a granuloma are too tiny to be seen by a radiologist. The most accurate use of the term \"granuloma\" requires a pathologist to examine surgically removed and specially colored (stained) tissue under a microscope. Histiocytes (specifically macrophages) are the cells that define a granuloma. They often, but not invariably, fuse to form multinucleated giant cells (Langhans giant cell). The macrophages in granulomas are often referred to as \"epithelioid\". This term refers to the vague resemblance of these macrophages to epithelial cells. Epithelioid macrophages differ from ordinary macrophages in that they have elongated nuclei that often resemble the sole of a slipper or shoe. They also have larger nuclei than ordinary macrophages and their cytoplasm is typically more pink when stained with eosin. These changes are thought to be a consequence of \"activation\" of the macrophage by the offending antigen.",

Macrophages and cells belonging to the monocyte-macrophage lineage (microglial cells) are the predominant cell types in the brain that are infected with HIV. The virus is most likely carried into the brain by infected monocytes (thus, brain HIV isolates are almost exclusively of the R5 type). The mechanism of HIV-induced damage of the brain, however, remains obscure. Because neurons are not infected by HIV, and the extent of neuro- pathologic changes is often less than might be expected from the severity of neurologic symptoms, most expes believe that the neurologic deficit is caused indirectly by viral products and soluble factors (e. g., cytokines such as TNF) produced by macrophages and microglial cells. In addition, injury from nitric oxide induced in neuronal cells by gp41 and direct damage of neurons by soluble HIV gp120 have been postulated.

Engagement of CD14 (even at doses as minute as 10 pg/mL) results in intracellular signaling an associated \"Toll-like receptor\" protein 4 (TLR-4). This signaling results in the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kB), which leads to transcription of a number of genes that trigger a proinflammatory response. It was the result of significant activation of mononuclear cells and synthesis of effector cytokines. It also results in profound activation of mononuclear cells and the production of potent effector cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a. TLR-mediated activation helps to trigger the innate immune system to efficiently eradicate invading microbes, but the cytokines they produce also act on endothelial cells. There, they have a variety of effects, including reduced synthesis of anticoagulation factors such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor and thrombomodulin.

HCV also is a major cause of liver disease. The worldwide carrier rate is esti- mated at 175 million persons (a 3% prevalence rate, ranging widely from 0. 1% to 12%, depending on the country). Per- sistent chronic infection exists in 3 to 4 million persons in the United States, where the number of newly acquired HCV infections per year dropped from 180, 000 in the mid- 1980s to about 19, 000 in 2006. This welcome change resulted from the marked reduction in transfusion-associated hepa- titis C (as a result of screening procedures) and a decline of infections in intravenous drug abusers (related to prac- tices motivated by fear of human immunodeficiency virus infection). However, the death rate from HCV will con- tinue to climb for 20 to 25 years, because of the decades- long lag time between acute infection and liver failure. The major route of transmission is through blood inoculation, with intravenous drug use accounting for at least 60% of cases in the United States. Transmission by blood products is now for- tunately rare, accounting for only 4% of all acute HCV infections. Occupational exposure among health care workers accounts for another 4% of cases. The rates of sexual transmission and veical transmission are low. Infections of unknown origin account for 9% to 27% of cases. HCV infection has a much higher rate than HBV of pro- gression to chronic disease and eventual cirrhosis (Fig. 15-13). In fact, hepatitis C is the condition that most frequently necessitates liver transplantation in the United States. Viral Structure and Genome. HCV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Flavi- viridae. It contains highly conserved 5'- and 3'-terminal regions that flank a single open reading frame of nearly 9500 nucleotides that encode structural and nonstructural proteins. HCV is subclassified into six genotypes, based on the genetic sequence. Moreover, because of the poor fidel- ity of RNA replication, an infected person may carry many HCV variants, called quasispecies. The relationships between quasispecies and disease progression are being investi- gated, but it seems that high multiplicity of quasispecies is associated with worse prognosis. In addition, this variabil- ity seriously hampers effos to develop an HCV vaccine.",

        "question": "Sure sign of malignancy is",
        "exp": "Ref Robbins 8/e p269; 9/e p272 CHARACTERISTICS OF BENIGN AND MALIGNANT NEOPLASMS Nothing is more impoant to the patient with a tumor than being told: \"It is benign. \" In general, benign tumors appear to be genetically \"simple, \" harboring fewer muta- tions than cancers, and genetically stable, changing little in genotype over time. The latter feature probably explains why benign tumors such as lipomas and leiomyomas transform to malignancies rarely, if at all. In practice, the determination of benign versus malignant is made with remarkable accuracy using long-established clinical and anatomic criteria, but some neoplasms defy easy character- ization. Ceain features may indicate innocence, and others may indicate malignancy. Such problems are not the rule, however, and there are four fundamental features by which benign and malignant tumors can be distinguished: dif- ferentiation and anaplasia, rate of growth, local invasion, and metastasis. Differentiation and Anaplasia Differentiation and anaplasia are characteristics seen only in the parenchymal cells that constitute the transformed elements of neoplasms. The differentiation of parenchymal tumor cells refers to the extent to which they resemble their normal forebears morphologically and functionally. * Benign neoplasms are composed of well-differentiated cells that closely resemble their normal counterpas. A lipoma is made up of mature fat cells laden with cytoplasmic lipid vacuoles, and a chondroma is made up of mature cailage cells that synthesize their usual cailaginous matrix--evidence of morphologic and functional differentiation. In well-differentiated benign tumors, mitoses are usually rare and are of normal configuration. * Malignant neoplasms are characterized by a wide range of parenchymal cell differentiation, from sur- prisingly well differentiated (Fig. 5-3) to completely in sheets, with total loss of communal structures, such as glands or stratified squamous architecture. The more differentiated the tumor cell, the more com- pletely it retains the functional capabilities of its normal counterpas. Benign neoplasms and even well-differenti- ated cancers of endocrine glands frequently elaborate the hormones characteristic of their origin. Well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas produce keratin (Fig. 5-3), just as well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas secrete bile. In other instances, unanticipated functions emerge. Some cancers may elaborate fetal proteins not produced by comparable cells in the adult. Cancers of nonendocrine origin may produce so-called ectopic hormones. For example, ceain lung carcinomas may produce adrenocor- ticotropic hormone (ACTH), parathyroid hormone-like hormone, insulin, glucagon, and others. More is said about these phenomena later. Despite exceptions, the more rapidly growing and the more anaplastic a tumor, the less likely it is to have specialized functional activity. Of relevance in the discussion of differentiation and ana- plasia is dysplasia, referring to disorderly but non-neoplastic undifferentiated. For example, well-differentiated ade- nocarcinomas of the thyroid may contain normal- appearing follicles. Such tumors sometimes may be difficult to distinguish from benign proliferations. Between the two extremes lie tumors loosely referred to as moderately well differentiated. The stroma carrying the blood supply is crucial to the growth of tumors but does not aid in the separation of benign from malignant ones. The amount of stromal connective tissue does deter- mine, however, the consistency of a neoplasm. Ceain cancers induce a dense, abundant fibrous stroma (des- moplasia), making them hard, so-called scirrhous tumors. * Malignant neoplasms that are composed of undiffer- entiated cells are said to be anaplastic. Lack of differen- tiation, or anaplasia, is considered a hallmark of malignancy. The term anaplasia literally means \"back- ward formation\"--implying dedifferentiation, or loss of the structural and functional differentiation of normal cells. It is now known, however, that at least some cancers arise from stem cells in tissues; in these tumors, failure of differentiation, rather than dedifferentiation of specialized cells, accounts for their undifferentiated appearance. Recent studies also indicate that in some cases, dedifferentiation of apparently mature cells does occur during carcinogenesis. Anaplastic cells display marked pleomorphism (i. e., variation in size and shape) (Fig. 5-4). Often the nuclei are extremely hyperchromatic (dark-staining) and large resulting in an increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio that may approach 1: 1 instead of the normal 1: 4 or 1: 6. Giant cells that are considerably larger than their neighbors may be formed and possess either one enormous nucleus or several nuclei. Anaplastic nuclei are variable and bizarre in size and shape. The chromatin is coarse and clumped, and nucle- oli may be of astounding size. More impoant, mitoses often are numerous and distinctly atypical; anarchic multi- ple spindles may produce tripolar or quadripolar mitotic figures (Fig. 5-5). Also, anaplastic cells usually fail to develop recognizable patterns of orientation to one another (i. e., they lose normal polarity). They may grow proliferation. Dysplasia is encountered principally in epi- thelial lesions. It is a loss in the uniformity of individual cells and in their architectural orientation. Dysplastic cells exhibit considerable pleomorphism and often possess hyperchro- matic nuclei that are abnormally large for the size of the cell. Mitotic figures are more abundant than usual and frequently appear in abnormal locations within the epithe- lium. In dysplastic stratified squamous epithelium, mitoses are not confined to the basal layers, where they normally occur, but may be seen at all levels and even in surface cells. There is considerable architectural anarchy. For example, the usual progressive maturation of tall cells in the basal layer to flattened squames on the surface may be lost and replaced by a disordered scrambling of dark basal- appearing cells (Fig. 5-6). When dysplastic changes are marked and involve the entire thickness of the epithelium, the lesion is referred to as carcinoma in situ, a preinvasive stage of cancer (Chapter 18). Although dysplastic changes often are found adjacent to foci of malignant transforma- tion, and long-term studies of cigarette smokers show that epithelial dysplasia almost invariably antedates the appear- ance of cancer, the term dysplasia is not synonymous with cancer; mild to moderate dysplasias that do not involve the entire thickness of the epithelium sometimes regress completely, par- ticularly if inciting causes are removed.",

Microglia (and other neuroglia including astrocytes) are distributed in large non-overlapping regions throughout the CNS. Microglia are key cells in overall brain maintenance--they are constantly scavenging the CNS for plaques, damaged or unnecessary neurons and synapses, and infectious agents. Since these processes must be efficient to prevent potentially fatal damage, microglia are extremely sensitive to even small pathological changes in the CNS.

Essentially, the Bain circuit functions in the same way as the T-piece, Except that the tube supplying fresh gas to the patient is located inside the reservoir tube. Inspiration - The patient inspires fresh gas from the outer reservoir tube. Expiration - The patient expires into the reservoir tube. Although fresh gas is still flowing into the system at this time, it is wasted, as it is contaminated by expired gas. Expiratory pause - Fresh gas from the inner tube washes the expired gas out of the reservoir tube, filling it with fresh gas for the next inspiration. Spontaneous ventilation Normocarbia requires a fresh gas flow of 200-300 ml/kg. Controlled ventilation A fresh gas flow of only 70 ml/kg is required to produce normocarbia. Bain and Spoerel have recommended the following: 2 L/min fresh gas flow in patients <10 kg 3. 5 L/min fresh gas flow in patients 10-50 kg 70 ml/kg fresh gas flow in patients >60 kg The recommended tidal volume is 10 ml/kg and respiratory rate is 12-16 breaths/minute",

The Angelman syndrome gene (imprinted on the paternal chro- mosome) is now known to encode a ligase that has a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway (Chapter 1). This gene, called, somewhat laboriously, UBE3A, is expressed primarily from the maternal allele in specific regions of the normal brain. In Angelman syndrome, UBE3A is not expressed in these areas of the brain--hence the neurologic manifestations. Prader-Willi syndrome, unlike Angelman syndrome, probably is caused by the loss of function of several genes located on chromosome 15 between q11 and q13. These genes are still being fully characterized.",

Most of the time this condition is caused by hepatic venous outflow obstruction, which results in vascular stasis and congestion of hepatic parenchyma. In this setting, hepatic sinusoidal dilatation can be related to pericardial disease, heart failure, compression or thrombosis of the hepatic veins or inferior vena cava (i. e., Budd-Chiari syndrome) or central veins/sinusoids involvement (i. e., sinusoidal obstruction syndrome). Neveheless, some extrahepatic inflammatory conditions (such as pyelonephritis, cholecystitis, pneumonia, pancreatitis, intestinal bowel disease, and others) may be associated with hepatic sinusoidal dilatation without concurrent venous outflow obstruction. On contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging, hepatic sinusoidal dilatation is typically characterized by a mottled, reticular enhancement of the liver, usually referred to as \"mosaic\" pattern. Other hepatic and extrahepatic imaging features, such us the dilatation of the hepatic veins or the presence of ascites, can help in identifying the cause of sinusoidal dilatation. ref - pubmed. com",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 8/e p191 Class I MHC molecules are encoded by three closely linked loci, designated HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C (Fig. 4-3). Each of these molecules is a heterodimer, con- sisting of a polymorphic 44-k. Da a chain noncovalently associated with an invariant 12-k. Da b2-microglobulin polypeptide (encoded by a separate gene on chromo- some 15). The extracellular poion of the a chain contains a cleft where the polymorphic residues are located and where foreign peptides bind to MHC mol- ecules for presentation to T cells, and a conserved region that binds CD8, ensuring that only CD8+ T cells can respond to peptides displayed by class I molecules. In general, class I MHC molecules bind and display pep- tides derived from proteins synthesized in the cyto- plasm of the cell (e. g., viral antigens). Because class I MHC molecules are present on all nucleated cells, all virus-infected cells can be detected and eliminated by CD8+ CTLs. Class II MHC molecules are encoded by genes in the HLA-D region, which contains at least three subregions: DP, DQ, and DR. Class II MHC molecules are heterodi- mers of noncovalently linked polymorphic a and b sub- units (Fig. 4-3). The extracellular poion of the class II MHC heterodimer contains a cleft for the binding of antigenic peptides and a region that binds CD4. Class II MHC expression is restricted to a few types of cells, mainly APCs (notably, dendritic cells ), macro- phages, and B cells. In general, class II MHC molecules bind to peptides derived from proteins synthesized outside the cell (e. g., those derived from extracellular bacteria) and ingested into the cell. This propey allows CD4+ T cells to recognize the presence of extracellular pathogens and to orchestrate a protective response. * Several other proteins are encoded in the MHC locus, some of which have been called \"class III molecules. \" These include complement components (C2, C3, and Bf) and the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin.

The best-characterized is an autosomal recessive condition called familial Mediterranean fever. This is a febrile disorder characterized by attacks of fever accompanied by inflammation of serosal surfaces, includ- ing peritoneum, pleura, and synol membrane. This dis- order is encountered largely in persons of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins. It is associated with widespread tissue involvement indistinguishable from reactive systemic amyloidosis. The amyloid fibril proteins are made up of AA proteins, suggesting that this form of amyloidosis is related to the recurrent bouts of inflamma- tion that characterize this disease. The gene for familial Mediterranean fever is called pyrin and encodes a protein that is a component of the inflammasome (Chapter 2). Patients have gain-of-function mutations in pyrin that result in constitutive overproduction of the pro- inflammatory cytokine IL-1 and persistent inflammation. In contrast with familial Mediterranean fever, a group of autosomal dominant familial disorders is characterized by deposition of amyloid predominantly in the peripheral and autonomic nerves. These familial amyloidotic poly- neuropathies have been described in kindreds in different pas of the world--for example, in Pougal, Japan, Sweden, and the United States.

SAA is synthesized by liver cells under the influence of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 that are produced during inflammation; thus, long-standing inflammation leads to elevated SAA levels, and ultimately the AA form of amyloid deposits. However, increased production of SAA by itself is not sufficient for the deposition of amyloid. Elevation of serum SAA levels is common to inflammatory states but in most instances does not lead to amyloidosis. There are two possible explanations for this. According to one view, SAA nor- mally is degraded to soluble end products by the action of monocyte-derived enzymes. Conceivably, people who develop amyloidosis have an enzyme defect that results in incomplete breakdown of SAA, thus generating insoluble AA molecules. Alternatively, a genetically determined structural abnormality in the SAA molecule itself renders it resistant to degradation by macrophages",

ANAs are directed against several nuclear antigens and can be grouped into four catego- ries: (1) antibodies to DNA, (2) antibodies to histones, (3) antibodies to nonhistone proteins bound to RNA, and (4) antibodies to nucleolar antigens. Table 4-10 lists several autoantibodies, including ANAs, and their asso- ciation with SLE as well as with other autoimmune dis- eases, to be discussed later. The most widely used method of detecting ANAs is the indirect immunofluo- rescence assay (IFA), which screens for autoantibodies that bind to a variety of nuclear antigens, including DNA, RNA, and proteins. Four staining patterns are seen with IFA: homogeneous or diffuse, rim or periph- eral, speckled, and nucleolar. While each pattern can be suggestive of the presence of specific autoantibodies, the strength of these associations is limited and should not be relied on. ANA testing by IFA is extremely sensitive, as more than 95% of patients with SLE will test positive, but the test's specificity is quite limited, because patients with other autoimmune diseases, chronic infections, and cancer will test positive as well. Fuhermore, ANAs are seen in approximately 5% to 15% of healthy people, and the incidence increases with age. Recently, the IFA has been replaced in many clinical laboratories by multiplex flow cytometry immunoassays that can simultaneously test for multiple specific autoantibodies, but these assays may lack the sensitivity of the IFA. Antibodies to double- stranded DNA (ds. DNA) and the so-called Smith (Sm) antigen can be detected by ELISA or multiplex flow methods and are specific for SLE. * Other autoantibodies. Antibodies against blood cells, including red cells, platelets, and lymphocytes, are found in many patients. Antiphospholipid antibodies are present in 40% to 50% of patients with lupus and react with a wide variety of proteins in complex with phospholipids. Some bind to cardiolipin antigen, used in serologic tests for syphilis, so patients with lupus may have a false-positive test result for syphilis.

        "question": "Oxygen dependant killing is done through",
        "exp": "Ref Robbins 9/e p48 Accumulation of Oxygen-Derived Free Radicals (Oxidative Stress) Free radicals are chemical species with a single unpaired electron in an outer orbital. Such chemical states are extremely unstable, and free radicals readily react with inorganic and organic chemicals; when generated in cells, they avidly attack nucleic acids as well as a variety of cel- lular proteins and lipids. In addition, free radicals initiate reactions in which molecules that react with free radicals are themselves conveed into other types of free radicals, thereby propagating the chain of damage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a type of oxygen- derived free radical whose role in cell injury is well estab- lished. Cell injury in many circumstances involves damage by free radicals; these situations include ischemia- reperfusion (discussed later on), chemical and radiation injury, toxicity from oxygen and other gases, cellular aging, microbial killing by phagocytic cells, and tissue injury caused by inflammatory cells. There are different types of ROS, and they are produced by two major pathways (Fig. 1-18). * ROS are produced normally in small amounts in all cells during the reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions that occur during mitochondrial respiration and energy genera- tion. In this process, molecular oxygen is sequentially reduced in mitochondria by the addition of four elec- trons to generate water. This reaction is imperfect, however, and small amounts of highly reactive but sho-lived toxic intermediates are generated when oxygen is only paially reduced. These intermediates include superoxide (O2 * ), which is conveed to hydro- gen peroxide (H2. O2) spontaneously and by the action of the enzyme superoxide dismutase. H2. O2 is more stable than O2 * and can cross biologic membranes. In the pres- ence of metals, such as Fe2+, H2. O2 is conveed to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical * OH by the Fenton reaction. ROS are produced in phagocytic leukocytes, mainly neutro- phils and macrophages, as a weapon for destroying ingested microbes and other substances during inflam- mation and host defense (Chapter 2). The ROS are gener- ated in the phagosomes and phagolysosomes of leukocytes by a process that is similar to mitochondrial respiration and is called the respiratory burst (or oxida- tive burst). In this process, a phagosome membrane enzyme catalyzes the generation of superoxide, which is conveed to H2. O2. H2. O2 is in turn conveed to a highly reactive compound hypochlorite (the major component of household bleach) by the enzyme myeloperoxidase, which is present in leukocytes. The role of ROS in inflam- mation is described in Chapter 2. * Nitric oxide (NO) is another reactive free radical pro- duced in leukocytes and other cells. It can react with O2 * to form a highly reactive compound, peroxynitrite, which also paicipates in cell injury. The damage caused by free radicals is determined by their rates of production and removal (Fig. 1-19). When the production of ROS increases or the scavenging systems are ineffective, the result is an excess of these free radicals, leading to a condition called oxidative stress. The generation of free radicals is increased under several circumstances: * The absorption of radiant energy (e. g., ultraviolet light, x-rays). Ionizing radiation can hydrolyze water into hydroxyl (* OH) and hydrogen (H* ) free radicals. * The enzymatic metabolism of exogenous chemicals (e. g., carbon tetrachloride--see later) * Inflammation, in which free radicals are produced by leukocytes (Chapter 2) Cells have developed many mechanisms to remove free radi- cals and thereby minimize injury. Free radicals are inher- ently unstable and decay spontaneously. There are also nonenzymatic and enzymatic systems that contribute to inactivation of free radicals (Fig. 1-19). * The rate of decay of superoxide is significantly increased by the action of superoxide dismutases (SODs) found in many cell types Glutathione (GSH) peroxidases are a family of enzymes whose major function is to protect cells from oxidative damage. The most abundant member of this family, glu- tathione peroxidase 1, is found in the cytoplasm of all cells. It catalyzes the breakdown of H2. O2 by the reaction 2 GSH (glutathione) + H2. O2 - GS-SG + 2 H2O. The intracellular ratio of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH) is a reflection of this enzyme's activity and thus of the cell's ability to catabolize free radicals. * Catalase, present in peroxisomes, catalyzes the decom- position of hydrogen peroxide (2. H2. O2 - O2 + 2. H2O). It is one of the most active enzymes known, capable of degrading millions of molecules of H2. O2 per second. * Endogenous or exogenous antioxidants (e. g., vitamins E, A, and C and b-carotene) may either block the forma- tion of free radicals or scavenge them once they have formed. Reactive oxygen species cause cell injury by three main reactions (Fig. 1-19): * Lipid peroxidation of membranes. Double bonds in mem- brane polyunsaturated lipids are vulnerable to attack by oxygen-derived free radicals. The lipid-radical interac- tions yield peroxides, which are themselves unstable and reactive, and an autocatalytic chain reaction ensues. * Cross-linking and other changes in proteins. Free radicals promote sulfhydryl-mediated protein cross-linking, resulting in enhanced degradation or loss of enzymatic activity. Free radical reactions may also directly cause polypeptide fragmentation. * DNA damage. Free radical reactions with thymine in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA produce single-strand breaks. Such DNA damage has been implicated in cell death, aging, and malignant transformation of cells. In addition to the role of ROS in cell injury and killing of microbes, low concentrations of ROS are involved in numer- ous signaling pathways in cells and thus in many physio- logic reactions. Therefore, these molecules are produced normally but, to avoid their harmful effects, their intracel- lular concentrations are tightly regulated in healthy cells.",

The oesophagus does not have a serous covering except over a sho length near its lower end. The Mucosa - The mucous membrane of the oesophagus shows several longitudinal folds that disappear when the tube is distended. The mucosa is lined by stratified squamous epithelium, which is normally not keratinised. Occasional melanocytes and endocrine cells are present. A columnar epithelium, similar to that lining the cardiac end of the stomach, may extend for some distance into the abdominal pa of the oesophagus. Finger-like processes (or papillae) of the connective tissue of the lamina propria project into the epithelial layer (just like dermal papillae). This helps to prevent separation of epithelium from underlying connective tissue. At the upper and lower ends of the oesophagus some tubuloalveolar mucous glands are present in the lamina propria. The muscularis mucosae is absent or poorly developed in the upper pa of the oesophagus. It is distinct in the lower pa of the oesophagus, and is thickest near the eosophagogastric junction. It consists chiefly of longitudinal muscular fibres, but a few circular fibres are also present. The Submucosa - The only special feature of the submucosa is the presence of compound tubuloalveolar mucous glands. Small aggregations of lymphoid tissue may be present in the submucosa, specially near the lower end. Some plasma cells and macrophages are also present. The Muscularis Externa- The muscle layer consists of the usual circular and longitudinal layers. However, it is unusual in that the muscle fibres are paly striated and paly smooth. In the upper one-third (or so) of the oesophagus the muscle fibres are entirely of the striated variety, while in the lower onethird all the fibres are of the smooth variety. Both types of fibres are present in the middle onethird of the oesophagus. The Adventitia - The muscle layer of the oesophagus is surrounded by dense fibrous tissue that forms an adventitial coat for the oesophagus. The lowest pa of the oesophagus is intra-abdominal and has a covering of peritoneum. REF: Inderbir Singh's Textbook of Human Histology, seventh edition, pg. no., 264, 265.",

Second, during the canalicular stage, from 16 to 26 weeks, the bronchial cailage plates extend peripherally. Each terminal bronchiole gives rise to several respiratory bronchioles, and each of these inturn divides into multiple saccular ducts. Next, the terminal sac stage begins at 26 weeks. During this stage, respiratory bronchioles give rise to primitive pulmonary alveoli. Last, the alveolar stage begins at 32 weeks. During the alveolar stage, the alveolar epithelial lining thins to improve gas exchange. At bih, only approximately 15 percent of the adult number of alveoli is present. Thus, the lung continues to grow, adding more alveoli for up to 8 years. Reference: William's Obstetrics; 24th edition; Chapter 7; Embryogenesis and Fetal Morphological Development.",

Mutations in the CF underlying gene, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, result in most cell types in an misprocessing so that little of the protein reaches the membranes. In case of clinical suspicion and/or doubtful sweat test results, mutation analysis can suppo the diagnosis of CF. Also carrier detection is offered. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY CF is caused by a mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR protein produced by this gene regulates the movement of chloride and sodium ions across epithelial cell membranes. Figure 1). Pseudomonas, Haemophilus influenza, and Staphylococcus aureus. These pathogens cause an overwhelming inflammatory response. Ultimately, chronic infection and this repetitive inflammatory response can lead to airway destruction. CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by the presence of mutations in both copies of the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Those with a single working copy are carriers and otherwise mostly normal. CFTR is involved in production of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus. When the CFTR is not functional, secretions which are usually thin instead become thick. The condition is diagnosed by a sweat test and genetic testing.

As discussed earlier, class I MHC molecules bind to intracellular peptide antigens and present the peptides to CD8+ T lymphocytes, stimulat- ing the differentiation of these T cells into effector cells called CTLs. CTLs play a critical role in resistance to virus infections and some tumors. The principal mechanism of killing by CTLs is dependent on the perforin-granzyme system. Perforin and granzymes are stored in the granules of CTLs and are rapidly released when CTLs engage their targets (cells bearing the appropriate class I MHC-bound peptides). Perforin binds to the plasma membrane of the target cells and promotes the entry of granzymes, which are proteases that specifically cleave and thereby activate cellular caspases. These enzymes induce apoptotic death of the target cells (Chapter 1). CTLs play an impoant role in the rejection of solid-organ transplants and may contribute to many immunologic diseases, such as type 1 diabetes (in which insulin-producing b cells in pancreatic islets are destroyed by an autoimmune T cell reaction).

The corona radiata is formed when the granulosa cells enlarge and become cuboidal, which occurs during the transition from the primordia to primary stage. These cuboidal granulosa cells, also known as the granulosa radiata, form more layers throughout the maturation process, and remain attached to the zona pellucida after the ovulation of the graafian follicle.

The original method of Congo red staining, described by Bennhold in 1922, has undergone several modifications to improve its sensitivity, specificity, and reliability. The most common modification is the alkaline Congo red method described by Puchtler and co-workers in 1962. Specificity is improved by using freshly prepared stain and a staining solution fully saturated with sodium chloride. Amyloid proteins can be fuher distinguished by autoclaving or by treating the tissue with potassium permanganate or alkaline guanidine. Autoclaving the tissues at 120 C for 30 min causes protein AA to lose its affinity for Congo red. Prolongation of autoclaving to 120 min abolishes the Congophilia of protein AL, but prealbumin-related amyloid shows little or no change. Treatment of the tissue with potassium permanganate causes protein AA and B2-microglobulin amyloid to lose their affinity to Congo red. Protein AA fails to stain with Congo red after treatment with alkaline guanidine for 1 min and protein AL and systemic senile amyloid protein (SSA) after 2 hr. Familial amyloid protein (FAP), prealbumin type, can stand 2 hr of alkaline guanidine treatment without losing its ability to stain with Congo red. Other methods of detection of amyloid include fluorescent stains, e. g., thioflavin T or S, and metachromatic stains such as crystal violet. Immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase methods are used to identify and classify amyloid proteins in tissues. Antibodies against the P component, proteins AA and AL and FAP have been used with great precision. Due to cross-reactivity, these methods do not differentiate between some types of familial and senile systemic amyloidosis",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 8/e p10, 265,; 9/e p271 Metastasis Metastases are secondary implants of a tumor that are dis- continuous with the primary tumor and located in remote tissues (Fig. 5-11). More than any other attribute, the propey of metastasis identifies a neoplasm as malignant. Not all cancers have equivalent ability to metastasize, however. At one extreme are basal cell carcinomas of the skin and most primary tumors of the central nervous system, which are highly invasive locally but rarely metastasize. At the other extreme are osteogenic (bone) sarcomas, which usually have metastasized to the lungs at the time of initial discovery. Approximately 30% of patients with newly diagnosed solid tumors (excluding skin cancers other than melano- mas) present with clinically evident metastases. An additional 20% have occult (hidden) metastases at the time of diagnosis. In general, the more anaplastic and the larger the primary neoplasm, the more likely is metastatic spread, but as with most rules, there are exceptions. Extremely small cancers have been known to metastasize; conversely, some large and ominous-looking lesions may not. Dissemination strongly prejudices, and may preclude, the possibility of curing the disease, so obviously, sho of prevention of cancer, no achievement would confer greater benefit on patients than the prevention of metastases. Malignant neoplasms disseminate by one of three path- ways: (1) seeding within body cavities, (2) lymphatic spread, or (3) hematogenous spread. Spread by seeding occurs when neoplasms invade a natural body cavity. This mode of dissemination is paicularly characteristic of cancers of the ovary, which often cover the peritoneal sur- faces widely. The implants literally may glaze all peritoneal surfaces and yet not invade the underlying tissues. Here is an instance of the ability to reimplant elsewhere that seems to be separable from the capacity to invade. Neoplasms of the central nervous system, such as a medulloblastoma or ependymoma, may penetrate the cerebral ventricles and be carried by the cerebrospinal fluid to reimplant on the men- ingeal surfaces, either within the brain or in the spinal cord. Lymphatic spread is more typical of carcinomas, whereas hematogenous spread is ored by sarcomas. There are numerous interconnections, however, between the lym- phatic and vascular systems, so all forms of cancer may disseminate through either or both systems. The pattern of lymph node involvement depends principally on the site of the primary neoplasm and the natural pathways of local lymphatic drainage. Lung carcinomas arising in the respi- ratory passages metastasize first to the regional bronchial lymph nodes and then to the tracheobronchial and hilar nodes. Carcinoma of the breast usually arises in the upper outer quadrant and first spreads to the axillary nodes. However, medial breast lesions may drain through the chest wall to the nodes along the internal mammary aery. Thereafter, in both instances, the supraclavicular and infra- clavicular nodes may be seeded. In some cases, the cancer cells seem to traverse the lymphatic channels within the immediately proximate nodes to be trapped in subsequent lymph nodes, producing so-called skip metastases. The cells may traverse all of the lymph nodes ultimately to reach the vascular compament by way of the thoracic duct. A \"sentinel lymph node\" is the first regional lymph node that receives lymph flow from a primary tumor. It can be identified by injection of blue dyes or radiolabeled tracers near the primary tumor. Biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes allows determination of the extent of spread of tumor and can be used to plan treatment. Of note, although enlargement of nodes near a primary neoplasm should arouse concern for metastatic spread, it does not always imply cancerous involvement. The necrotic products of the neoplasm and tumor antigens often evoke immunologic responses in the nodes, such as hyperplasia of the follicles (lymphadenitis) and proliferation of macro- phages in the subcapsular sinuses (sinus histiocytosis). Thus, histopathologic verification of tumor within an enlarged lymph node is required. Hematogenous spread is the ored pathway for sarco- mas, but carcinomas use it as well. As might be expected, aeries are penetrated less readily than are veins. With venous invasion, the blood-borne cells follow the venous flow draining the site of the neoplasm, with tumor cells often stopping in the first capillary bed they encounter. Since all poal area drainage flows to the liver, and all caval blood flows to the lungs, the liver and lungs are the most frequently involved secondary sites in hematogenous dissemina- tion. Cancers arising near the veebral column often em- bolize through the paraveebral plexus; this pathway probably is involved in the frequent veebral metastases of carcinomas of the thyroid and prostate. Ceain carcinomas have a propensity to grow within veins. Renal cell carcinoma often invades the renal vein to grow in a snakelike fashion up the inferior vena cava, sometimes reaching the right side of the heart. Hepatocel- lular carcinomas often penetrate poal and hepatic radicles to grow within them into the main venous channels. Remarkably, such intravenous growth may not be accom- panied by widespread dissemination. Many observations suggest that the anatomic localiza- tion of a neoplasm and its venous drainage cannot wholly explain the systemic distributions of metastases. For example, prostatic carcinoma preferentially spreads to bone, bronchogenic carcinomas tend to involve the adre- nals and the brain, and neuroblastomas spread to the liver and bones. Conversely, skeletal muscles, although rich in capillaries, are rarely the site of secondary deposits. The molecular basis of such tissue-specific homing of tumor cells is discussed later on.",

The PT is performed by adding phospholip- ids and tissue factor to a patient's citrated plasma (sodium citrate chelates calcium and prevents spontane- ous clotting), followed by calcium, and the time to fibrin clot formation (usually 11 to 13 seconds) is recorded.

There are two major mechanisms of B cell activation. * T cell-independent. Many polysaccharide and lipid anti- gens have multiple identical antigenic determinants (epitopes) that are able to engage several antigen recep- tor molecules on each B cell and initiate the process of B cell activation. * T cell-dependent. Typical globular protein antigens are not able to bind to many antigen receptors, and the full response of B cells to protein antigens requires help from CD4+ T cells. B cells also can act as APCs--they ingest protein antigens, degrade them, and display peptides bound to class II MHC molecules for recognition by helper T cells. The helper T cells express CD40L and secrete cytokines, which work together to activate the B cells. Some of the progeny of the expanded B cell clones differ- entiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Each plasma cell secretes antibodies that have the same specificity as the cell surface antibodies (B cell receptors) that first recog- nized the antigen. Polysaccharides and lipids stimulate secretion mainly of IgM antibody. Protein antigens, by viue of CD40L- and cytokine-mediated helper T cell actions, induce the production of antibodies of different classes (IgG, IgA, IgE). This production of functionally dif- ferent antibodies, all with the same specificity, is called heavy-chain class (isotype) switching; it provides plasticity in the antibody response, allowing antibodies to serve many functions. Helper T cells also stimulate the produc- tion of antibodies with higher and higher affinity for the antigen.

The best-characterized is an autosomal recessive condition called familial Mediterranean fever. This is a febrile disorder characterized by attacks of fever accompanied by inflammation of serosal surfaces, includ- ing peritoneum, pleura, and synol membrane. This dis- order is encountered largely in persons of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins. It is associated with widespread tissue involvement indistinguishable from reactive systemic amyloidosis. The amyloid fibril proteins are made up of AA proteins, suggesting that this form of amyloidosis is related to the recurrent bouts of inflamma- tion that characterize this disease. The gene for familial Mediterranean fever is called pyrin and encodes a protein that is a component of the inflammasome (Chapter 2). Patients have gain-of-function mutations in pyrin that result in constitutive overproduction of the pro- inflammatory cytokine IL-1 and persistent inflammation. In contrast with familial Mediterranean fever, a group of autosomal dominant familial disorders is characterized by deposition of amyloid predominantly in the peripheral and autonomic nerves. These familial amyloidotic poly- neuropathies have been described in kindreds in different pas of the world--for example, in Pougal, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. As mentioned previously, the fibrils in these familial polyneuropathies are made up of mutant forms of transthyretin (ATTRs).",

        "exp": "Ref Harrison 17/e p1858; Robbins 8/e p316, 9/e p329 H. pylori infection and NSAID use are the primary underlying causes of PUD. The imbalances of mucosal defenses and damaging forces that cause chronic gastritis (Fig. 14-13) are also responsible for PUD. Thus, PUD generally develops on a background of chronic gastritis. Although more than 70% of PUD cases are associated with H. pylori infection, only 5% to 10% of H. pylori-infected persons develop ulcers. It is probable that host factors as well as variation among H. pylori strains determine the clinical outcomes. Gastric hyperacidity is fundamental to the pathogenesis of PUD. The acidity that drives PUD may be caused by H. pylori infection, parietal cell hyperplasia, excessive secretory responses, or impaired inhibition of stimulatory mechanisms such as gastrin release. For example, Zollinger-Ellison syn- drome, characterized by multiple peptic ulcerations in the stomach, duodenum, and even jejunum, is caused by uncon- trolled release of gastrin by a tumor and the resulting massive acid production. Cofactors in peptic ulcerogenesis include chronic NSAID use, as noted; cigarette smoking, which impairs mucosal blood flow and healing; and high-dose cor- ticosteroids, which suppress prostaglandin synthesis and impair healing. Peptic ulcers are more frequent in persons with alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal failure, and hyperparathyroidism. In the latter two conditions, hypercalcemia stimulates gastrin pro- duction and therefore increases acid secretion. Finally, psy- chologic stress may increase gastric acid production and exacerbate PUD. H. pylori gastritis typically affects the antrum and is associ- ated with increased gastric acid production. The induced mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) can transform into lymphoma.",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 9/e p271 Basement membrane invasion is the most impoant differentiating features between invasive carcinoma from carcinoma insitu A benign neoplasm remains localized at its site of origin. It does not have the capacity to infiltrate, invade, or metas- tasize to distant sites, as do malignant neoplasms. For example, as adenomas slowly expand, most develop an enclosing fibrous capsule that separates them from the host tissue. This capsule probably is derived from the stroma of the host tissue as the parenchymal cells atrophy under the pressure of the expanding tumor. The stroma of the tumor itself also may contribute to the capsule (Figs. 5-7 and 5-8). Of note, however, not all benign neoplasms are encapsulated. For example, the leiomyoma of the uterus is discretely demarcated from the surrounding smooth muscle by a zone of compressed and attenuated normal myometrium, but there is no well-developed capsule. Nonetheless, a well-defined cleavage plane exists around these lesions. A few benign tumors are neither encapsulated nor discretely defined; such lack of demarcation is paicularly likely to be seen in some benign vascular neoplasms of the dermis. These exceptions are pointed out only to emphasize that although encapsulation is the rule in benign tumors, the lack of a capsule does not mean that a tumor is malignant. Cancers grow by progressive infiltration, invasion, destruc- tion, and penetration of the surrounding tissue (Figs. 5-9 and 5-10). They do not develop well-defined capsules. There are, however, occasional instances in which a slowly growing malignant tumor deceptively appears to be encased by the stroma of the surrounding host tissue, but microscopic examination usually reveals tiny crablike feet penetrating the margin and infiltrating adjacent structures. The infiltrative mode of growth makes it necessary to remove a wide margin of surrounding normal tissue when surgical excision of a malignant tumor is attempted. Surgical pathologists carefully examine the margins of resected tumors to ensure that they are devoid of cancer cells (clean margins). Next to the development of metastases, local invasiveness is the most reliable feature that distinguishes malignant from benign tumors.",

The middle mediastinum contains the pericardial sac with the heart, terminations of the SVC, inferior vena cava (IVC), and pulmonary veins, the ascending aoa, the pulmonary trunk and its bifurcations into the right and left pulmonary aeries, lung roots, phrenic nerve, and bronchial lymph nodes. The posterior mediastinum lies between the pericardial sac and veebral bodies T5 through T12. It contains the esophagus, descending thoracic aoa and right intercostals and esophageal aeries, azygous venous system, thoracic duct, vagus and splanchnic nerves, and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes. The body's main lymphatic vessel, the thoracic duct, originates in the abdomen at the level of L1 as a highly variable dilation called the cisterna chili. It enters the posterior mediastinum through the aoic hiatus and lies on the right anterior surface of the thoracic veebral bodies, posterior to the esophagus between the azygous venous system and the thoracic aoa. By the level of the sternal angle, the duct completes a shift to the left side, traverses the superior mediastinum, and terminates by emptying into the venous system near the junction of the left internal jugular and subclan veins. The thoracic duct receives lymph drainage from the lower limbs, abdomen and left hemithorax, upper limb, and head and neck. A small right lymphatic duct receives lymph drainage from the right hemithorax, upper limb, and head and neck. The thoracic and right lymphatic ducts are described as receiving lymph from jugular, subclan, and broncho mediastinal trunks, although these trunks may variably unite or empty into veins independently.

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 8/e p10, 11; 9/e p37 Metaplasia is a reversible change in which one adult cell type (epithelial or mesenchymal) is replaced by another adult cell type. In this type of cellular adaptation, a cell type sensitive to a paicular stress is replaced by another cell type better able to withstand the adverse environment. Metaplasia is thought to arise by reprogramming of stem cells to differ- entiate along a new pathway rather than a phenotypic change (transdifferentiation) of already differentiated cells. Epithelial metaplasia is exemplified by the squamous change that occurs in the respiratory epithelium of habitual cigarette smokers (Fig. 1-5). The normal ciliated columnar epithelial cells of the trachea and bronchi are focally or widely replaced by stratified squamous epithelial cells. The rugged stratified squamous epithelium may be able to survive the noxious chemicals in cigarette smoke that the more fragile specialized epithelium would not tolerate. Although the metaplastic squamous epithelium has survival advantages, impoant protective mechanisms are lost, such as mucus secretion and ciliary clearance of paiculate matter. Epithelial metaplasia is therefore a double-edged sword. Moreover, the influences that induce metaplastic change, if per- sistent, may predispose to malignant transformation of the epi- thelium. In fact, squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium often coexists with lung cancers composed of malignant squamous cells. It is thought that cigarette smoking initially causes squamous metaplasia, and cancers arise later in some of these altered foci. Since vitamin A is essential for normal epithelial differentiation, its deficiency may also induce squamous metaplasia in the respiratoryepithelium. Metaplasia need not always occur in the direc- tion of columnar to squamous epithelium; in chronic gastric reflux, the normal stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus may undergo metaplastic transformation to gastric or intestinal-type columnar epithelium. Metapla- sia may also occur in mesenchymal cells but in these situ- ations it is generally a reaction to some pathologic alteration and not an adaptive response to stress. For example, bone is occasionally formed in soft tissues, paicularly in foci of injury.",

All four contain an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain that can interact with a multitude of signaling molecules and exhibit both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activity. Notably, no ligands for HER2 have yet been identified. HER2 can heterodimerise with any of the other three receptors and is considered to be the preferred dimerisation paner of the other ErbB receptors. Dimerisation results in the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors and initiates a variety of signaling pathway",

Infarcts tend to be wedge-shaped, with the occluded vessel at the apex and the organ periphery forming the base (Fig. 3-17); when the base is a serosal surface, there is often an overlying fibrinous exudate. Lateral margins may be irregular, reflecting flow from adjacent vessels. The margins of acute infarcts typically are indistinct and slightly hemorrhagic; with time, the edges become better defined by a narrow rim of hyperemia attributable to inflammation. Infarcts resulting from aerial occlusions in organs without a dual circulation typically become progressively paler and sharply defined with time (Fig. 3-17, B). By comparison, hemorrhagic infarcts are the rule in the lung and other spongy organs (Fig. 3-17, A). Extravasated red cells in hemorrhagic infarcts are phagocytosed by macrophages, and the heme iron is conveed to intracellular hemosiderin.",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 8/e p312, 425 and 9/e p325 The most radiosensitive organ sites in the children in order of sensitivity are the thyroid gland, breasts, bone marrow, brain, skin. Radiation, whatever its source (UV rays of sunlight, x-rays, nuclear fission, radionuclides) is an established carcinogen. Unprotected miners of radioactive elements have a 10-fold increased incidence of lung cancers. Follow-up study of survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki disclosed a markedly increased incidence of leukemia--principally myelogenous leukemias--after an average latent period of about 7 years, as well as increased moality rates for thyroid, breast, colon, and lung carcino- mas. The nuclear power accident at Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union continues to exact its toll in the form of high cancer incidence in the surrounding areas. More recently, it is feared that radiation release from a nuclear power plant in Japan damaged by a massive eahquake and tsunami will result in significantly increased cancer incidence in the surrounding geographic areas. Therapeutic irradiation of the head and neck can give rise to papillary thyroid cancers years later. The oncogenic propeies of ionizing radiation are related to its mutagenic effects; it causes chromosome breakage, translocations, and, less frequently, point mutations. Biologically, double- stranded DNA breaks seem to be the most impoant form of DNA damage caused by radiation. The oncogenic effect of UV rays merits special mention because it highlights the impoance of DNA repair in car- cinogenesis. Natural UV radiation derived from the sun can cause skin cancers (melanomas, squamous cell carcino- mas, and basal cell carcinomas). At greatest risk are fair- skinned people who live in locales such as Australia and New Zealand that receive a great deal of sunlight. Non- melanoma skin cancers are associated with total cumula- tive exposure to UV radiation, whereas melanomas are associated with intense intermittent exposure--as occurs with sunbathing. UV light has several biologic effects on cells. Of paicular relevance to carcinogenesis is the ability to damage DNA by forming pyrimidine dimers.",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 9/e p262 Amyloidosis may be an unsuspected finding at autopsy in a patient who has no apparent related clinical manifesta- tions, or it may be responsible for serious clinical dysfunc- tion and even death. The clinical course depends on the paicular sites or organs affected and the severity of the involvement. Nonspecific complaints such as weakness, fatigue, and weight loss are the most common presenting manifestations. Later in the course, amyloidosis tends to manifest in one of several ways: by renal disease, hepato- megaly, splenomegaly, or cardiac abnormalities. Renal involvement giving rise to severe proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) (Chapter 13) often is the major cause of symp- toms in reactive systemic amyloidosis. Progression of the renal disease may lead to renal failure, which is an impor- tant cause of death in amyloidosis. The hepatosplenomeg- aly rarely causes significant clinical dysfunction, but it may be the presenting finding. Cardiac amyloidosis may mani- fest as conduction disturbances or as restrictive cardiomy- opathy (Chapter 10). Cardiac arrhythmias are an impoant cause of death in cardiac amyloidosis. In one large series, 40% of the patients with AL amyloid died of cardiac disease. The diagnosis of amyloidosis may be suspected from the clinical signs and symptoms and from some of the findings mentioned; however, more specific tests must often be done for definitive diagnosis. Biopsy and subsequent Congo red staining is the most impoant tool in the diag- nosis of amyloidosis. In general, biopsy is taken from the organ suspected to be involved. For example, renal biopsy is useful in the presence of urinary abnormalities. Rectal and gingival biopsy specimens contain amyloid in as many as 75% of cases with generalized amyloidosis. Examination of abdominal fat aspirates stained with Congo red is a simple, low-risk method. In suspected cases of AL amyloi- dosis, serum and urinary protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis should be performed. Bone marrow examination in such cases usually shows plasma- cytosis, even if skeletal lesions of multiple myeloma are not present. Proteomic analysis of affected tissue is now being widely used for detection of small amounts of amyloid (from fat aspirates) and for definitive identification of the type of amylo",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 8/e p207; 9/e p210 Inflammatory Reactions Elicited by CD4+ T Cells The sequence of events in T cell-mediated inflammatory reactions begins with the first exposure to antigen and is essentially the same as the reactions of cell-mediated immunity (Fig. 4-4). Naive CD4+ T lymphocytes recognize peptide antigens of self or microbial proteins in association with class II MHC molecules on the surface of DCs (or macrophages) that have processed the antigens. If the DCs produce IL-12, the naive T cells differentiate into effector cells of the TH1 type. The cytokine IFN-g, made by NK cells and by the TH1 cells themselves, fuher promotes TH1 dif- ferentiation, providing a powerful positive feedback loop. If the APCs produce IL-1, IL-6, or IL-23 instead of IL-12, the CD4+ cells develop into TH17 effectors. On subsequent exposure to the antigen, the previously generated effector cells are recruited to the site of antigen exposure and are activated by the antigen presented by local APCs. The TH1 cells secrete IFN-g, which is the most potent macrophage- activating cytokine known. Activated macrophages have increased phagocytic and microbicidal activity. Activated macrophages also express more class II MHC molecules and costimulators, leading to augmented antigen presenta- tion capacity, and the cells secrete more IL-12, thus stimu- lating more TH1 responses. Upon activation by antigen, TH17 effector cells secrete IL-17 and several other cytokines, which promote the recruitment of neutrophils (and mono- cytes) and thus induce inflammation. Because the cyto- kines produced by the T cells enhance leukocyte recruitment and activation, these inflammatory reactions become chronic unless the offending agent is eliminated or the cycle is interrupted therapeutically. In fact, inflammation occurs as an early response to microbes and dead cells (Chapter 2), but it is greatly increased and prolonged when T cells are involved. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), described next, is an illustrative model of T cell-mediated inflammation and tissue injury. The same reactions are the underlying basis for several diseases. Contact dermatitis is an example of tissue injury resulting from T cell-mediated inflammation. It is evoked by contact with pentadecylcatechol (also known as urushiol, the active component of poison ivy and poison oak, which probably becomes antigenic by binding to a host protein). On reexposure of a previously exposed person to the plants, sensitized TH1 CD4+ cells accumulate in the dermis and migrate toward the antigen within the epidermis. Here they release cytokines that damage kera- tinocytes, causing separation of these cells and formation of an intraepidermal vesicle, and inflammation manifested as a vesicular dermatitis. It has long been thought that several systemic diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and mul- tiple sclerosis, are caused by TH1 and TH17 reactions against self antigens, and Crohn disease may be caused by uncon- trolled reactions involving the same T cells but directed against intestinal bacteria. T cell-mediated inflammation also plays a role in the rejection of transplants, described later in the chapter.",

There are two main mechanisms by which the host immune system recognizes and responds to the MHC mol- ecules on the graft (Fig. 4-23): * Direct recognition. Host T cells directly recognize the allo- geneic (foreign) MHC molecules that are expressed on graft cells. Direct recognition of foreign MHC seems to violate the rule of MHC restriction, which states that in every individual, all of the T cells are educated to recog- nize foreign antigens displayed by only that individual's MHC molecules. It is postulated that allogeneic MHC molecules (with any bound peptides) structurally mimic self MHC and foreign peptide, and so direct recognition of the allogeneic MHC is essentially an immunologic cross-reaction. Because DCs in the graft express high levels of MHC as well as costimulatory molecules, they are believed to be the major culprits contributing to direct recognition. The most impoant consequence of direct recognition is the activation of host CD8+ T cells that recognize class I MHC (HLA-A, -B) molecules in the graft. These T cells differentiate into CTLs, which kill the cells in the graft. Host CD4+ helper T cells may be trig- gered into proliferation and cytokine production by rec- ognition of donor class II MHC (HLA-D Indirect recognition. In this pathway, host CD4+ T cells recognize donor MHC molecules after these molecules are picked up, processed, and presented by the host's own APCs. This sequence is similar to the physiologic processing and presentation of other foreign (e. g., microbial) antigens. The activated CD4+ T cells then recognize APCs displaying graft antigens and secrete cytokines that induce inflammation and damage the graft. The indirect pathway is also involved in the pro- duction of antibodies against graft alloantigens; if these antigens are proteins, they are picked up by host B cells, and peptides are presented to helper T cells, which then stimulate antibody responses.",

The reaction is initiated by entry of an antigen, which is called an allergen because it triggers allergy. Many allergens are environmental substances that are harmless for most persons on exposure. Some people apparently inherit genes that make them susceptible to allergies. This susceptibility is manifested by the propen- sity of such persons to mount strong TH2 responses and, subsequently, to produce IgE antibody against the aller- gens. The IgE is central to the activation of the mast cells and release of mediators that are responsible for the clinical and pathologic manifestations of the reaction. Immediate hypersensitivity may occur as a local reaction that is merely annoying (e. g., seasonal rhinitis, or hay fever), severely debilitating (asthma), or even fatal (anaphylaxis).",

These tumors are designated endome- trioid because of their histologic similarity to normal endometrial glands. Risk factors for this type of carcinoma include (1) obesity, (2) diabetes, (3) hypertension, (4) infeil- ity, and (5) exposure to unopposed estrogen. Many of these risk factors result in increased estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium and are associated with endometrial hyperpla- sia. In fact, it is well recognized that prolonged estrogen replacement therapy and estrogen-secreting ovarian tumors increase the risk of endometrioid type of endometrial carci- noma. Additionally, breast carcinoma (which also is estrogen- dependent) occurs in women with endometrial cancer (and vice versa) more frequently than by chance alone. Muta- tions in mismatch repair genes and the tumor sup- pressor gene PTEN are early events in the stepwise development of endometrioid carcinoma. Women with germline mutations in PTEN (Cowden syndrome) are at high risk for this cancer. TP53 mutations occur but are rela- tively uncommon and are believed to be late events in the genesis of this tumor type. The serous type of endometrial carcinoma is much less common, accounting for roughly 15% of tumors. Nearly all cases have mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, whereas mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes and PTEN are rare.",

In the agranular coex the external and internal granular laminae are inconspicuous. This type of coex is seen most typically in the precentral gyrus (area 4) and is, therefore, believed to be typical of 'motor' areas. It is also seen in some other areas. In the granular coex the granular layers are highly developed while the pyramidal and ganglionic layers are poorly developed or absent. In the visual area the external band of Baillarger is prominent and forms a white line that can be seen with the naked eye when the region is freshly cut across. This stria of Gennari gives the name striate coex to the visual coex. Between the two extremes represented by the agranular and granular varieties of coex, three intermediate types are described as follows. Frontal coex Parietal coex and Polar coex.

Paicularly in the latter two patterns, it may be difficult to radiologically distinguish regenerative cirrhotic nodules from neoplasms of similar size. Discrete tumor masses usually are yellow- white, punctuated sometimes by bile staining and areas of hemorrhage or necrosis. HCC has a strong propensity for vascular invasion. Extensive intrahepatic metastases are characteristic, and occasionally snakelike masses of tumor invade the poal vein (with occlusion of the poal circula- tion) or inferior vena cava, extending even into the right side of the heart. On histologic examination, HCCs range from well- differentiated lesions that reproduce hepatocytes arranged in cords, trabeculae or glandular patterns (Fig. 15-34), to poorly differentiated lesions, often composed of large, multinucleate anaplastic giant cells. In the better-differentiated vari- ants, globules of bile may be found within the cyto- plasm of cells and in pseudocanaliculi between cells. Acidophilic hyaline inclusions within the cytoplasm may be present, resembling Mallory bodies. There is little stroma in most hepatocellular carcinomas, explaining their soft consistency. A distinctive clinicopathologic variant of HCC is the fibrolamellar carcinoma. It occurs in young male and female adults (20 to 40 years of age) with equal incidence and has no association with cirrhosis or other risk factors. It usually consists of a single tumor with fibrous bands coursing through it, superficially resembling focal nodular hyperplasia. The fibrolamellar variant has a better prognosis than that of the other, more common variants.",

The focus here is on glomerular pathology, although interstitial and tubular lesions are also seen in SLE. The pathogenesis of all forms of glomerulonephritis in SLE involves deposition of DNA-anti-DNA complexes within the glomeruli. These evoke an inflammatory response that may cause proliferation of the endothelial, mesangial, and/or epithelial cells and, in severe cases, necrosis of the glomeruli. Although the kidney appears normal by light microscopy in 25% to 30% of cases, almost all cases of SLE show some renal abnormality if examined by immuno- fluorescence and electron microscopy. According to the current International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathol- ogy Society morphologic classification, there are six patterns of glomerular disease in SLE (none of which is specific to the disease): class I, minimal mesangial lupus nephritis; class II, mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis; class III, focal lupus nephritis; class IV, diffuse lupus nephritis; class V, membra- nous lupus nephritis; and class VI, advanced sclerosing lupus nephritis. * Minimal mesangial lupus nephritis (class I) is rarely encountered in renal biopsies. Immune complexes are present in the mesangium, but there are no concomitant structural alterations detectable by light microscopy. * Mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis (class II) is seen in 10% to 25% of cases and is associated with mild clinical symptoms. Immune complexes deposit in the mesangium, with a mild to moderate increase in the mesangial matrix and cellularity. * Focal lupus nephritis (class III) is seen in 20% to 35% of cases. Lesions are visualized in fewer than half the glomeruli, and they may be segmentally or globally distrib- uted within each glomerulus. Active lesions are character- ized by swelling and proliferation of endothelial and mesangial cells, infiltration by neutrophils, and/or fibrinoid deposits with capillary thrombi (Fig. 4-18, A). The clinical presentation may range from only mild microscopic hema- turia and proteinuria to a more active urinary sediment with red blood cell casts and acute, severe renal insufficiency. * Diffuse lupus nephritis (class IV) is the most serious form of renal lesions in SLE and is also the most commonly encountered in renal biopsies, occurring in 35% to 60% of patients. It is distinguished from focal lupus nephritis (class III) by involvement of half or more of glomeruli. Most of the glomeruli show endothelial and mesangial prolifera- tion, leading to diffuse hypercellularity of these structures (Fig. 4-18, B) and producing in some cases epithelial crescents that fill Bowman's space. When extensive, sub- endothelial immune complexes create a circumferential thickening of the capillary wall, resembling rigid \"wire loops\" on routine light microscopy (Fig. 4-18, C). Electron microscopy reveals prominent electron-dense subendo- thelial immune complexes (between endothelium and basement membrane) (Fig. 4-18, D), but immune com- plexes are also usually present in other pas of the capil- lary wall and in the mesangium. Immune complexes can be visualized by staining with fluorescent antibodies directed against immunoglobulins or complement, result- ing in a granular fluorescent staining pattern (Fig. 4-18, E). In due course, glomerular injury may give rise to scarring (glomerulosclerosis). Most affected patients have hematu- ria with moderate to severe proteinuria, hypertension, and renal insufficiency. * Membranous lupus nephritis (class V) occurs in 10% to 15% of cases and is the designation for glomerular disease characterized by widespread thickening of the capillary wall due to deposition of subepithelial immune complexes. Membranous glomerulonephritis associated with SLE is very similar to that encountered in idiopathic membranous nephropathy (Chapter 13). Thickening of capillary walls is caused by increased deposition of base- ment membrane-like material, as well as accumulation of immune complexes. Patients with this histologic change almost always have severe proteinuria with ove nephrotic syndrome (Chapter 13). * Advanced sclerosing lupus nephritis (class VI) is characterized by complete sclerosis of greater than 90% of glomeruli and corresponds to clinical end stage renal disease.",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 7/e p290-291 Your Position: Cell Cycle Inhibitor Proteins Cell Cycle Inhibitor Proteins Creat Cell Cycle Inhibitor Proteins The cell cycle is the series of events which regulate the life of the cell. This regulation results from a combination of several signals from different regulatory pathways that are activated in response to specific stimuli. The cell cycle has a central role in controlling cell growth and proliferation. It frequently becomes the target of genetic alteration, the accumulation of which may lead to the deregulation of these ordered events and may be related to the onset of cancer. With the growing understanding of the impoant role of cell cycle regulation in tumor formation and apoptosis, cell cycle inhibitors have been fuher studied in the field of cancer treatment. Cyclin-dependent Kinase (CDK) Inhibitors Progression through the cell cycle is ensured by paicular protein complexes, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The CDKs are a family of highly conserved serine/threonine kinases, which share a high homology in a paicular region. CDKs may control the cell cycle by phosphorylating different targets, which may in turn be activated or inactivated. Regulation of CDK/cyclin activity can occur through regulatory proteins, such as CDK Inhibitors (CKIs). The CKIs can inhibit the activity of CDK by associating in vivo with the CDK subunit, the cyclin or the cyclin/CDK complex. This inhibition may occur in different ways, such as inhibition of the CDK kinase activity, interference with CAK mediated CDK activation, or competition with cyclins in binding to the catalytic subunit. The inhibitory process can be carried out by one or a combination of these mechanisms. The expression of these CKIs may be induced by stimuli such as senescence, contact inhibition, extracellular anti-mitogenic factors and cell cycle checkpoints. Their role in controlling cell cycle is crucial. In several forms of cancer, CKIs such as p16 and p27 are mutated. Also, they have been found to be degraded in several types of cancer. Low levels of p27 levels are correlated with poor clinical prognosis. These inhibitors can be upregulated when required, thus blocking the activation of the CDK by a cyclin. This arrests the cell in a paicular pa of the cell cycle until conditions are such that it can continue towards proliferation or, if necessary, be steered towards cell death.",

Ras-regulated signal pathways control such processes as actin cytoskeletal integrity, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell adhesion, apoptosis, and cell migration. Ras and Ras-related proteins are often deregulated in cancers, leading to increased invasion and metastasis, and decreased apoptosis. Ras activates several pathways, of which the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade has been well-studied. This cascade transmits signals downstream and results in the transcription of genes involved in cell growth and division. Another Ras-activated signaling pathway is the PI3K/AKT/m. TOR pathway, which stimulates protein synthesis and cellular growth, and inhibits When Ras is 'switched on' by incoming signals, it subsequently switches on other proteins, which ultimately turn on genes involved in cell growth, differentiation and survival. Mutations in ras genes can lead to the production of permanently activated Ras proteins. As a result, this can cause unintended and overactive signaling inside the cell, even in the absence of incoming signals. Because these signals result in cell growth and division, overactive Ras signaling can ultimately lead to cancer. The 3 Ras genes in humans (HRas, KRas, and NRas) are the most common oncogenes in human cancer; mutations that permanently activate Ras are found in 20% to 25% of all human tumors and up to 90% in ceain types of cancer (e. g., pancreatic cancer). For this reason, Ras inhibitors are being studied as a treatment for cancer and other diseases with Ras overexpression.",

The p53 protein thwas neoplastic transformation by three interlocking mechanisms: activation of temporary cell cycle arrest (termed quiescence), induction of permanent cell cycle arrest (termed senescence), or triggering of pro- grammed cell death (termed apoptosis). If Rb \"senses\" external signals, p53 can be viewed as a central monitor of internal stress, directing the stressed cells toward one of these three pathways. A variety of stresses trigger the p53 response pathways, including anoxia, inappropriate oncoprotein activity (e. g., MYC or RAS), and damage to the integrity of DNA. By managing the DNA damage response, p53 plays a central role in maintaining the integrity of the genome, as described next. In nonstressed, healthy cells, p53 has a sho half-life (20 minutes) because of its association with MDM2, a protein that targets p53 for destruction. When the cell is stressed, for example, by an assault on its DNA, \"sensors\" that include protein kinases such as ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) are activated. These activated complexes catalyze post-translational modifications in p53 that release it from MDM2 and increase its half-life and enhance its ability to drive the transcription of target genes. Hundreds of genes whose transcription is triggered by p53 have been found. These genes suppress neoplastic transformation by three mechanisms: * p53-mediated cell cycle arrest may be considered the primor- dial response to DNA damage (Fig. 5-23). It occurs late in the G1 phase and is caused mainly by p53-dependent transcription of the CDKI gene CDKN1A (p21). The p21 protein, as described earlier, inhibits cyclin-CDK com- plexes and prevents phosphorylation of Rb, thereby arresting cells in the G1 phase. Such a pause in cell cycling is welcome, because it gives the cells \"breathing time\" to repair DNA damage",

Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of cancer. A person with hereditary retinoblastoma may inherit an altered copy of the RB1 gene from one parent, or the altered gene may be the result of a new mutation that occurs in an egg or sperm cell or just after feilization. For retinoblastoma to develop, a mutation involving the other copy of the RB1 gene must occur in retinal cells during the person's lifetime. This second mutation usually occurs in childhood, typically leading to the development of retinoblastoma in both eyes. In the non-hereditary form of retinoblastoma, typically only one eye is affected and there is no family history of the disease. Affected individuals are born with two normal copies of the RB1 gene. Then, usually in early childhood, both copies of the RB1 gene in ceain retinal cells acquire mutations. People with non-hereditary retinoblastoma are not at risk of passing these RB1 gene mutations to their children. However, without genetic testing it can be difficult to tell whether a person with retinoblastoma in one eye has the hereditary or the non-hereditary form of the disease.",

After extravasating from the blood, leuko- cytes move toward sites of infection or injury along a chem- ical gradient by a process called chemotaxis. Both exogenous and endogenous substances can be chemotactic for leuko- cytes, including the following: * Bacterial products, paicularly peptides with N-formyl- methionine termini * Cytokines, especially those of the chemokine family * Components of the complement system, paicularly C5 * Products of the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, paicularly leukotriene B4 (LTB4) These mediators, which are described in more detail later, are produced in response to infections and tissue damage and during immunologic reactions. Leukocyte infiltration in all of these situations results from the actions of various combinations of mediators. Chemotactic molecules bind to specific cell surface receptors, which triggers the assembly of cytoskeletal con- tractile elements necessary for movement. Leukocytes move by extending pseudopods that anchor to the ECM and then pull the cell in the direction of the extension. The direction of such movement is specified by a higher density of chemokine receptors at the leading edge of the cell. Thus, leukocytes move to and are retained at the site where they are needed. The type of emigrating leukocyte varies with the age of the inflammatory response and with the type of stimulus. In most forms of acute inflammation, neutrophils predomi- nate in the inflammatory infiltrate during the first 6 to 24 hours and are replaced by monocytes in 24 to 48 hours (Fig. 2-6). Several factors account for this early abundance of neutro- phils: These cells are the most numerous leukocytes in the blood, they respond more rapidly to chemokines, and they may attach more firmly to the adhesion molecules that are rapidly induced on endothelial cells, such as P- and E-selectins. In addition, after entering tissues, neutrophils are sho-lived--they die by apoptosis and disappear within 24 to 48 hours--while monocytes survive longer. There are exceptions to this pattern of cellular infiltration,",

However, only one retrovirus, the human T cell lympho- tropic virus-1 (HTLV-1), has been demonstrated to cause cancer in humans. HTLV-1 is associated with a form of T cell leukemia/lymphoma that is endemic in ceain pas of Japan and the Caribbean basin but is found sporadically elsewhere, including the United States. Similar to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HTLV-1 has tropism for CD4+ T cells, and this subset of T cells is the major target for neoplastic transformation. Human infec- tion requires transmission of infected T cells through sexual intercourse, blood products, or breastfeeding. Leukemia develops only in about 3% to 5% of infected persons after a long latent period of 20 to 50 years. There is little doubt that HTLV-1 infection of T lympho- cytes is necessary for leukemogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms of transformation are not clear. The HTLV-1 genome does not contain a viral oncogene, and in contrast with ceain animal retroviruses, no consistent integration site next to a cellular oncogene has been discovered. Indeed, the long latency period between initial infection and devel- opment of disease suggests a multistep process, during which many oncogenic mutations are accumulated. The genome of HTLV-1 contains, in addition to the usual retroviral genes, a unique region called pX. This region contains several genes, including one called TAX. The TAX protein has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for cellular transformation. By interacting with several transcription factors, such as NF-kB, the TAX protein can transactivate the expression of genes that encode cytokines, cytokine receptors, and costimulatory molecules. This inappropriate gene expression leads to autocrine signaling loops and increased activation of promitogenic signaling cascades. Fuhermore, TAX can drive progression through the cell cycle by directly binding to and activating cyclins. In addition, TAX can repress the function of several tumor suppressor genes that control the cell cycle, including CDKN2A/p16 and TP53. From these and other observa- tions, the following scenario is emerging (Fig. 5-31): The TAX gene turns on several cytokine genes and their recep- tors (e. g., the interleukins IL-2 and IL-2R and IL-15 and IL-15R), setting up an autocrine system that drives T cell proliferation. Of these cytokines, IL-15 seems to be more impoant, but much remains to be defined. Additionally, a parallel paracrine pathway is activated by increased pro- duction of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which stimulates neighboring macrophages to produce other T cell mitogens. Initially, the T cell prolifera- tion is polyclonal, because the virus infects many cells, but because of TAX-based inactivation of tumor suppressor genes such as TP53, the proliferating T cells are at increased risk for secondary transforming events (mutations), which lead ultimately to the outgrowth of a monoclonal neoplas- tic T cell population.",

Cancellous bone is found at the ends of long bones, as well as in the pelvic bones, ribs, skull, and the veebrae in the spinal column. Spongy bone consists of plates (trabeculae) and bars of bone adjacent to small, irregular cavities that contain red bone marrow. The canaliculi connect to the adjacent cavities, instead of a central haversian canal, to receive their blood supply Red bone marrow is where blood cells are made.

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 9/e p1155; Harrison 16/e p497 Uvrays and chronic ulcer are also the answers proliferation. Dysplasia is encountered principally in epi- thelial lesions. It is a loss in the uniformity of individual cells and in their architectural orientation. Dysplastic cells exhibit considerable pleomorphism and often possess hyperchro- matic nuclei that are abnormally large for the size of the cell. Mitotic figures are more abundant than usual and frequently appear in abnormal locations within the epithe- lium. In dysplastic stratified squamous epithelium, mitoses are not confined to the basal layers, where they normally occur, but may be seen at all levels and even in surface cells. There is considerable architectural anarchy. For example, the usual progressive maturation of tall cells in the basal layer to flattened squames on the surface may be lost and replaced by a disordered scrambling of dark basal- appearing cells (Fig. 5-6). When dysplastic changes are marked and involve the entire thickness of the epithelium, the lesion is referred to as carcinoma in situ, a preinvasive stage of cancer (Chapter 18). Although dysplastic changes often are found adjacent to foci of malignant transforma- tion, and long-term studies of cigarette smokers show that epithelial dysplasia almost invariably antedates the appear- ance of cancer, the term dysplasia is not synonymous with cancer; mild to moderate dysplasias that do not involve the entire thickness of the epithelium sometimes regress completely, par- ticularly if inciting causes are removed. Clinical Features Although most of these lesions arise in the skin, they also may involve the oral and anogenital mucosal surfaces, the esophagus, the meninges, and the eye. The following com- ments apply to cutaneous melanomas. Melanoma of the skin usually is asymptomatic, although pruritus may be an early manifestation. The most impoant clinical sign is a change in the color or size of a pigmented lesion. The main clinical warning signs are 1. Rapid enlargement of a preexisting nevus 2. Itching or pain in a lesion 3. Development of a new pigmented lesion during adult life 4. Irregularity of the borders of a pigmented lesion 5. Variegation of color within a pigmented lesion These principles are expressed in the so-called ABCs of melanoma: asymmetry, border, color, diameter, and evolu- tion (change of an existing nevus). It is vitally impoant to recognize melanomas and intervene as rapidly as pos- sible. The vast majority of superficial lesions are curable surgically, while metastatic melanoma has a very poor prognosis. The probability of metastasis is predicted by measuring the depth of invasion in millimeters of the veical growth phase nodule from the top of the granular cell layer of the overlying epidermis (Breslow thickness). Metastasis risk also is increased in tumors with a high mitotic rate and in those that fail to induce a local immune response. When metastases occur, they involve not only regional lymph nodes but also liver, lungs, brain, and viually any other site that can be seeded hematogenously. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (of the first draining node of a primary melanoma) at the time of surgery provides additional information on biologic aggressiveness. In some cases, metastases may appear for the first time many years after complete surgical excision of the primary tumor, suggesting a long phase of dormancy, during which time the tumor may be held in check by the host immune response. Recognition of the likely role of the host immune response has led to therapeutic trials of immunomodula- tors. Some impressive responses in patients with advanced",
