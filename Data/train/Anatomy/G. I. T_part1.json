        "exp": "Management of Acute cholecystitis IV fluids, analgesics and antibiotics are given initially in a pt. presenting with acute cholecystitis. Cholecystectomy is the definitive treatment. The timing of cholecystectomy was a matter of debate in the past. Early cholecystectomy performed within 2 to 3 days of presentation is preferred over interval or delayed cholecystectomy that is performed 6 to 10 weeks after initial medical therapy. Several studies have shown that unless the patient is unfit for surgery, early cholecystectomy is done as it provides a definitive treatment in one hospital admission & quicker recovery time. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred approach Conversion to open cholecystectomy is made if the inflammation prevents adequate visualization of impoant structures. The conversion rate to open cholecystectomy is higher in the settings of acute cholecystitis than with chronic cholecystitis. If a patient presents late, after 3 to 5 days of illness, or in unfit for surgery, he is treated with analgesics, antibiotics and laparoscopic cholecystectomy is scheduled for approximately 2 months later. But if the patient fails to respond to initial medical therapy he would then need a surgical intervention. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be attempted, but the conversion rate is high and some prefer to go directly for an open cholecystectomy. For those unfit for surgery, a percutaneous cholecystostomy or an open cholecystostomy under local analgesia can be performed. Acute cholecystitis may progress to complications like empyema of the gall bladder, emphysematous cholecystitis, or perforation of the gall bladder despite antibiotic therapy. Emergency cholecystectomy is the procedure of choice for these complications, if the patient can safely withstand an anesthetic. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy could be attempted, but the conversion rate to open procedure is high and some prefer to go directly for an open cholecystectomy. Occasionally, the inflammatory process obscures the structures in the triangle of Calot, making dissection and ligation of the cystic duct unsafe. In these patients, paial cholecystectomy, cauterization of the remaining gall bladder mucosa, and drainage avoid injury to the CBD. If a patient is too unstable to tolerate a surgery, percutaneous cholecystostomy (or an open cholecystostomy) under local analgesia can be performed to drain the gall bladder. Delayed cholecystectomy can then be done once the inflammation has resolved. Ref: Schwaz 9/e p1148",

It is usually seen in operation which destroys the pyloric sphincter (i. e. gastrectomy, antrectomy and drainage procedures). It also affects a small percentage of patients with highly selective vagotomy due to loss of receptive relaxation of the stomach. It is of 2 types Early dumping syndrome it occurs immediately after meals (after about 15 to 30 min) dumping of hyperosmolar contents into the small bowel results in rapid fluid influx from the circulation into the gastrointestinal tract. This leads to acute intestinal distention and peripheral and splanchnic vasodilatation. This gives rise to vasomotor & abdominal symptoms: epigastria fullness, sweating, light headedness, tachycardia, diarrhea. Symptoms can be ameliorated by lying down or saline infusion. b. Late dumping syndrome it is seen late - 2 to 3 hrs after meal occurs due to reactive hypoglycemia. The carbohydrate load in the small bowel causes a rise in plasma glucose, which in turn, causes high insulin levels. Hyperinsulinemia leads to hypoglycemia. Symptoms are relieved by administration of sugar. Management 1) Dietary management diet therapy is done to reduce jejunal osmolality multiple small meals food low in carbohydrate and rich in fat and protein are taken. liquids during meals should be avoided. 2) Somatostatin analogues (octreotide) diet therapy is usually successful but if it fails, the patient is staed on octreotide. 3) Surgery Most of the patients improve with time, dietary management and Octreotide. Only rarely surgery is needed. Surgical procedures used to treat dumping are pyloric reconstruction, the takedown of gastrojejunostomy, interposition of a 10 cm reversed intestinal segment between the stomach & duodenum, conversion of Billroth II to Biliroth I anastomosis, and conversion to Roux-en-Y-anastomosis.

Patients require resuscitation, monitoring, and endoscopic investigation. Up to 70% of gastric ulcers are H. pylori-positive, so an attempt should be made to control the bleeding endoscopically, with multiple biopsy specimens of the ulcer obtained to rule out malignancy and concurrently obtained biopsy specimens of the body and antrum to test for H. pylori infection. Patients whose bleeding can be controlled and who are H. pylori-positive should undergo subsequent treatment for H. pylori infection. For bleeding that cannot be controlled, operative intervention again depends on the type of gastric ulcer. In all cases, the ulcer should ideally be excised with the addition of vagotomy depending on the cause of the ulcer (mostly for intractable ulcers that are not due to H. pylori infection or NSAID usage that can be stopped).

A trichobezoar may extend up to the pylorus, duodenum, or even jejunum. A pa may break off into small bowel and cause small bowel obstruction. For a discussion of other gastrointestinal foreign bodies, please see: bezoars Clinical presentation The patient usually is an adolescent girl. The patient may have a history of a psychiatric illness and occasionally a prior history of surgery may be present. The symptoms of Rapunzel syndrome is caused either by gastric outlet obstruction or its complications and includes: anorexia, bloating, early satiety weight loss vomiting immediately following meals acute epigastric pain patchy hair loss is seen in scalp hair Complications obstructive jaundice mechanical small bowel obstruction small bowel perforation peritonitis acute pancreatitis multiple complications of trichophagia included trichobezoars, malnutrition, intestinal obstruction, and ulceration with bleeding.

In Caroli's syndrome, the biliary dilatation is associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis. The presentation is varied, with many patients presenting with abdominal pain, cholangitis or end-stage liver disease. The majority of patients present before the age of 30. Sex distri- bution is equal. Management is multidisciplinary: cholangitis or jaundice are treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy and endoscopic or interventional stenting. Malignancy is a complication of long-standing disease. Hepatic resection is indicated for patients with limited disease.

        "exp": "Bile salts and phospholipids in bile keep cholesterol in solution by the formation of micelles. An excess of cholesterol relative to bile salts and phospholipids allows cholesterol to form crystals and such pile is called Lithogenic or super-saturated bile. Pathogenesis of Cholesterol gallstones There are three elements necessary for the formation of cholesterol gallstones Lithogenic bile Nucleation and Stasis or gallbladder hypomotility all three are necessary for cholesterol stone formation. A) Lithogenic (stone-forming) bile Cholesterol is insoluble in water (water is major constituent of bile, 85-95%). It is made soluble by bile acids and phospholipid - lecithin which form micelles with cholesterol So any mechanism which increases the cholesterol in bile or decreases the bile acids (salts) or lecithin makes the bile supersaturated or lithogenic. If to such a bile, the other two elements i. e. nucleation and stasis are provided, the cholesterol in solution precipitates to form cholesterol crystals which grow to form cholesterol stones.

B) Nucleation Nucleation refers to the process by which cholesterol monohydrate crystals form and agglomerate to become macroscopic crystals. Formation of cholesterol stones requires either an excess of pronucleating factors or a deficiency of antinucleating factors. Mucin and ceain non-mucin glycoproteins (and infection according to Bailey & Love) appear to be pronucleating factors, while apolipoproteins Al and All and ceain other glycoproteins appear to be antinucleating factor. C) Stasis or gall bladder hypomotility Stones would not be able to form if the gall bladder emptied all supersaturated or crystal containing bile completely. Gall bladder hypomotility is caused by prolonged parenteral nutrition fasting pregnancy drugs such as octreotide oral contraceptive pills surgery, burns Ref: Maingot's 10/e, p 1718",

Heaburn, postprandial choking, and nocturnal coughing are commonly seen. The dysphagia that patients experience often begins with liquids and progresses to solids. Most patients describe eating as a laborious process during which they must pay special attention to the process. They eat slowly and use large volumes of water to help wash the food down into the stomach. As the water builds up pressure, retrosternal chest pain is experienced and can be severe until the LES opens, which provides quick relief. Regurgitation of undigested, foul-smelling food is common, and with progressive disease, aspiration can become life-threatening. Pneumonia, lung abscess, and bronchiectasis often result from long-standing achalasia. The dysphagia progresses slowly during years, and patients adapt their lifestyle to accommodate the inconveniences that accompany this disease. Patients often do not seek medical attention until their symptoms are advanced and will present with marked distention of the esophagus. the operation of choice. It is done open or with video or robotic assistance. The decision to perform an antireflux procedure remains controversial. Most patients who have undergone a myotomy will experience some amount of reflux, either symptom- atic or not.

CD117 is the best diagnostic marker for GISTs, but 5-10% are negative. Staining pattern may be cytoplasmic, membrane, and paranuclear (Golgi pattern). PDGFRA expression can be located in the cytoplasm, membrane, and paranuclear region (Golgi pattern), but the lack of specificity, ubiquity of the staining, and technical problems have pushed it a second plane. In GISTs, the staining pattern of PKCO is cytoplasmic, diffuse, and granular, although a Golgi pattern may be seen. Global expression varies. The staining pattern of DOG1 varies from cytoplasmic to membranous, with usually strong, diffuse intensity. The positivity rate is almost identical in some series to CD117 positivity. Currently, it is considered the most specific and sensitive marker for GIST. The current panel for GIST includes CD117, smooth muscle actin, CD34, desmin, and S-100. Some authors also include PDGFRA, PKC0, and DOG1. The last two can be of value in a subset of GISTs, mainly in CD117-negative cases.",

        "exp": "Transjugular intrahepatic poosystemic stent shunts The emergency management of variceal haemorrhage has been revolutionised by the introduction of transjugular intrahepatic poosystemic stent shunts (TIPSS). Over a sho period, this has become the main treatment of variceal haemorrhage that has not responded to drug treatment and endoscopic therapy. The shunts are inseed under local anaesthetic, analgesia and sedation, using fluoroscopic guidance and ultrasonography. Via the internal jugular vein and SVC, a guidewire is inseed into a hepatic vein and through the hepatic parenchyma into a branch of the poal vein. The track through the parenchyma is then dilated with a balloon catheter to allow inseion of a metallic stent, which is expanded once a satisfactory position is achieved to form a channel between systemic and poal venous systems. A satisfactory drop in poal venous pressure is usually associated with good control of the variceal haemorrhage. The main early complication of this technique is perforation of the liver capsule, which can be associated with fatal intraperitoneal haemorrhage. TIPSS occlusion may result in fuher variceal haemorrhage and occurs more commonly in patients with well-compensated liver disease and good synthetic function. Post-shunt encephalopathy is a confusional state caused by the poal blood bypassing the detoxification of the liver. It occurs in about 40% of patients, a similar incidence to that found after surgical shunts. If severe, the lumen of the TIPSS can be reduced by inseion of a smaller stent. T he main contraindication to TIPSS is poal vein occlusion. The main long-term complication of TIPSS is stenosis of the shunt, which is common (approximately 50% at 1 year) and may present as fuher variceal haemorrhage.

The current treatment of patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei involves resection of as much of the tumor as possible(cytoreduction) and intraperitoneal heated chemotherapy (IPHC). Operative management includes omentectomy, stripping of involved peritoneum, resection of involved organs, and appendectomy, if not previously performed. There should be no residual tumor nodules larger than 2 mm in diameter after resection to facilitate penetration of the chemotherapy into any residual disease. IPHC can be per- formed by an open technique, in which the abdomen is left open to ensure adequate chemotherapy distribution throughout the peritoneal cavity, or a closed technique, in which the abdomen is closed after inflow and outflow cannulas are placed.

Causes x Chronic frontal sinusitis which eventually suppurates and extends into subperiosteal region. x Trauma--subperiosteal haematoma. x Chronic suppurative otitis media. Features x Pain and boggy swelling in frontal region which is warm, tender. x Toxicity and drowsiness. x Pitting scalp oedema is typical. x Investigations: \u0017 Total leucocyte count--increased. ESR--raised. \u0017 X-ray skull. CT scan. x Differential diagnosis: Secondaries in the skull or brain. Complications Osteomyelitis of frontal bone. Spread of infection into intracranial cavity leads to intracranial abscess (Extradural or subdural abscess) (dumb-bell abscess). So may present with features of raised intracranial tension like headache, coning and convulsions. Pott's Puffy tumor can be associated with coical vein throm- bosis, epidural brain abscess/subdural empyema. The cause of vein thrombosis is explained by diplopic veins in frontal bone, which communicates with the dural venous plexus; septic thrombi can potentially evolve from foci within the frontal sinus and propagate through this venous system. Treatment x Antibiotics and drainage under general anaesthesia before it spreads into cranial cavity. x Once it extends into cranial cavity, it is treated accordingly by formal neurosurgical decompression (often using Dandy's brain cannula). x Osteomyelitis of skull bones requires radical removal with recon- struction of skull defect.

It is found most frequently in the mesentery of the ileum. Cyst wall is thin, made up of connective tissue; lacks the muscular wall of enteric duplication cyst. Cyst is not lined by mucosa. It is filled with clear lymph or chyle. A chylolymphatic cyst is almost invariably solitary, although in extreme rare cases, multiple cyst may be seen. Cyst is more often unilocular than multilocular. A chylolymphatic cyst has a blood supply independent of that of the adjacent intestine, and thus enucleation (resection) is possible without the need for resection of gut. Enterogenous cyst Believed to be derived either from a diveiculum of the mesenteric border of the intestine which has become sequestered from the intestinal canal during embryonic life or from a duplication of the intestine. An enterogenous cyst has thicker wall than a chylolymphatic cyst, and it is lined by mucous membrane, sometimes ciliated. The content is mucinous The enterogenosu cyst and the adjacent bowel wall has a common blood supply therefore enucleation of the cyst is always done along with resection of the related poion of intestine followed by anastomosis.

        "exp": "Here this patient is presenting with repeated attacks of severe intractable pain, thus he is a candidate for surgical intervention. Longitudinal pancreatico jejunostomy with side-to-side anastomosis is the most suitable surgical option for this patient. (As his ductal system is dilated, a drainage procedure would be helpful) Surgical options for Chronic pancreatitis Drainage procedures Drainage procedures for patients with small ducts Patients with small (< 4-6 mm) pancreatic ducts, but in whom pancreatitis is caused by obstruction at the ampullary level, may benefit from transduodenal sphincteroplasty of the CBD with the division of the septum that lies between the MPD & CBD (pancreatic septectomy). However, most patients with chronic pancreatitis have multiple areas of duct stricture throughout the pancreas and are unlikely to benefit from these transduodenal procedures. Drainage procedures for patients with dilated ducts. A dilated duct system reflects obstruction. Thus the ideal treatment for these patients with dilated ducts is creating an anastomotic connection between the dilated ducts and the intestinal lumen. Longitudinal pancreatico jejunostomy (Puestow procedure) is the most commonly used drainage procedure. Entire pancreatic duct is longitudinally opened and anastomosed side to side to a Roux-en-Y segment of jejunum. Pancreatectomy Painful chronic pancreatitis can be treated with resection of the body and tail of the pancreas (distal pancreatectomy), resection of the head and uncinate process (Whipple procedure), subtotal pancreatectomy that spares a rim of the pancreas along with the inner curve of the duodenum, or total pancreatectomy. Many surgeons believe that it is the inflammatory process in the head of the pancreas that controls both the severity of the symptoms and fuher progression of the disease in the remaining gland. Resection of the pancreatic head can be achieved by Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) or its pylorus preserving modification or duodenum preserving pancreatic head resection. A good no. of pts. (70-80%) are completely relieved of pain. Distal pancreatectomy is the ideal surgical procedure for patients whose disease is confined to the pancreatic tail. Total or near total pancreatectomy is indicated in patients in whom a previous operative procedure like distal pancreatectomy or pancreaticoduodenectomy has failed to control pain. However, its role is not clear, as several patients even after total pancreatectomy continues to experience severe pancreatic pain. Celiac plexus block Celiac plexus nerve blocks performed either percutaneously or endoscopically have been employed to relieve chronic pancreatic pain with inconsistent results. A newer and more effective variant of this approach is thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy - resection of the segments of the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves as they enter the thorax from the abdomen.

In patients with chronic liver disease, an increasing MELD score is associated with increasing severity of hepatic dysfunction and three-month moality risk. Given its accuracy in predicting sho-term survival among patients with end-stage liver disease, MELD is used by the transplant community in the United States for prioritization of patients awaiting liver transplantation. It was originally developed as a tool to predict moality after transjugular intrahepatic poosystemic shunt (TIPS). The MELD model that is currently used by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) in prioritizing allocation of deceased donor organs for liver transplantation is calculated according to the following formula: MELD = 3. 8 + 11. 2 + 9. 6 + 6. 4 where Ln is the natural logarithm. MELD is scored on a 6- to 40-point scale A higher MELD score indicates a sicker patient, with a higher risk for moality.

Occasional repos of rupture of haemangiomas have led some to consider resection for large lesions, especially if they appear to be symptomatic.
