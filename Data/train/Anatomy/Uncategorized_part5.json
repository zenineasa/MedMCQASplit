However, with ulnar nerve palsy, the patient will experience difficulty maintaining a hold and will compensate by flexing the FPL (flexor pollicis longus) of the thumb to maintain grip pressure causing a pinching effect. Clinically, this compensation manifests as flexion of the IP joint of the thumb (rather than extension, as would occur with correct use of the adductor pollicis). The compensation of the affected hand results in a weak pinch grip with the tips of the thumb and index finger, therefore, with the thumb in obvious flexion.

They found that the monkeys developed.1) Visual agnosia : they could see, but were unable to recognise familiar objects or their use.2) Oral tendencies : they would examine their surroundings with their mouths instead of their eyes.3) Hypermetamorphosis : a desire to explore everything.4) Emotional changes : emotion was dulled and facial movements and vocalisations were far less expressive. They lost fear where it would normally occur. Even after being attacked by a snake, they would casually approach it again. This was called \"placidity\".5) Hypersexuality : a dramatic inc rease in ove sexual behaviour, including masturbation, and homosexual and heterosexual acts. They may even attempt copulation with inanimate objects.The syndrome in humans is due to bilateral destruction of the amygdaloid body and inferior temporal coex, most commonly due to herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). It shares visual agnosia and loss of normal fear and anger responses in common with the monkey model but one also seen loss of memory with dementia, distractibility and seizures.

Fracture are usually due to tril trauma but surprisingly heal well. *Radiology shows Wormian bones in the skull. Radiographic features vary according to the type of disease and its severity and include osteopenia and fractures, which may heal with florid callus formation, mimicking osteosarcoma. 1 Bones are thin and under-tubulated (gracile), normal in length or shoened, thickened and deformed by multiple fractures. 2 Intra-sutural (Wormian) bones can be identified on skull radiographs. OSTEOGENISIS IMPERFECTA : # It is probably the most common form of skeletal dysplasia requiring substantial ohopaedic care. # Although the disease is usually apparent at bih or in childhood, more mild forms of the disease may not become apparent until adulthood, when affected individuals may present with insufficiency fractures and osteopenia. # In the more severely affected fetuses antenatal diagnosis may often be made in the second trimester on the basis of shoened long bones with multiple fractures. # The thorax tends to be sho but not narrow. Pathophysiology In most cases, 01 is caused by a dominant mutation in the COLIA I or the COLIA 2 genes that encode type I collagen. Fewer than 10 percent of 01 cases are believed to be caused by recessive mutations in other genes in the collagen pathway. Here is the production of abnormal collagen I molecules as well as a decrease in the production Of normal collagen I molecules. This results from mutations in the loci coding for pro-a 1 and pro-a 2 chains which form the helical structure of collagen 1. Ref:Maheshwari 9th/e p.306",

When the knee is extended, flexion is limited by the tension of the hamstring group of muscles. Extension, which is the movement of the flexed thigh backward to the anatomic position, is limited by the tension of the iliofemoral, pubofemoral, and ischiofemoral ligaments. Abduction is limited by the tension of the pubofemoral ligament, and adduction is limited by contact with the opposite limb and by the tension in the ligament of the head of the femur. Lateral rotation is limited by the tension in the iliofemoral and pubofemoral ligaments, and medial rotation is limited by the ischiofemoral ligament. The following movements take place: Flexion is performed by the iliopsoas, rectus femoris, and saorius and also by the adductor muscles. Extension (a backward movement of the flexed thigh) is performed by the gluteus maximus and the hamstring muscles. Abduction is performed by the gluteus medius and minimus, assisted by the saorius, tensor fasciae latae and piriformis. Adduction is performed by the adductor longus and brevis and the adductor fibers of the adductor magnus. These muscles are assisted by the pectineus and the gracilis.

Weakness on one side will lead to a drop in the pelvis on the contralateral side of the pelvis while walking (Trendelenburg sign, lurching gait). With bilateral weakness there will be dropping of the pelvis on both sides during walking leading to waddling. This gait is seen in patient with bilateral superior gluteal nerve injury and myopathies, such as muscular dystrophy.Positive Trendelenburg's sign due to Injury to Superior Gluteal Nerve:The Trendelenburg's sign is said to be positive if, when standing on one leg, the pelvis drops on the side opposite to the stance leg. The weakness is present on the side of the stance leg. The body is not able to maintain the center of gravity on the side of the stance leg. Normally, the body shifts the weight to the stance leg, allowing the shift of the center of gravity and consequently stabilizing or balancing the body. However, in unilateral superior gluteal nerve injury, when the patient lifts the opposing leg, the shift is not created and the patient cannot maintain balance leading to instability (Lurching gait). Bilateral superior gluteal nerve injury results in a waddling gait.NOTE: Not to be confused with Trendelenburg's sign. The Trendelenburg Test or BrodieTrendelenburg test is a test which can be carried out as pa of a physical examination to determine the competency of the valves in the superficial and deep veins of the legs in patients with varicose veins.",

After crossing the knee this aery divides into the anterior and posterior tibial aeries, which supply the leg and foot.Note:The anterior tibial aery is a branch of the popliteal aery that arises distal to the knee and would therefore not be compressed by a femoral fracture. The anterior tibial aery is renamed the dorsalis pedis aery after it crosses the ankle. The femoral aery is in the anterior compament of the thigh. After passing through the adductor hiatus to reach the popliteal fossa, the femoral aery is renamed the popliteal aery. The posterior tibial aery is a branch of the popliteal aery that arises distal to the knee and would therefore not be compressed by a femoral fracture. The posterior tibial aery passes through the posterior compament of the leg and, after passing behind the medial malleolus of the ankle, divides into the medial and lateral plantar aeries.

Other modes of injury of the common peroneal nerve may be compression caused by a tight plaster on leg and sometimes due to lathi injury on lateral side of the knee.

Deep peroneal nerve supply muscles of anterior compament of leg which include tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, peroneus teius and extensor hallucis longus whereas superficial peroneal nerve supply muscles of lateral compament of the leg i.e peroneus longus and peroneus brevis. In the common peroneal nerve injury the muscles of the anterior and lateral compament of the leg get paralysed results in weakness of dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot. As there is weakness of the dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot, the opposite muscles, the plantar flexion of the ankle joint and inversion of subtalar and transverse tarsal joint, cause the foot to be plantar flexed. So the planter flexion and inversion are normal.The patient has a high stepping gait.All the reflexes are intact (ankle jerk is lost in sciatic nerve lesions)Sensory loss is present over anterior and lateral side of the leg, dorsum of the foot and toes including medial side of the big toe.Sole of the foot derives its sensory innervation from medial calcaneal branch of tibial nerve and branches from medial and lateral plantar nerves so there is no loss of sensations in the foot.

Since there is a gap between the right and left ligamentum flavum in the midline, this ligament is not penetrated if the needle is in the midline. Immediately within the bony veebra is the epidural space, which lies between the bone and the dura. The epidural space contains a considerable amount of fat and a venous plexus.Because the muscles of the back are located on either side of the midline, no muscle is penetrated when doing a lumbar puncture. The subarachnoid space, which is filled with cerebrospinal fluid, is reached after the needle passes through the epidural space and pierces the dura and arachnoid. The cauda equina, rather than the spinal cord, is located in the subarachnoid space of the low lumbar region where a lumbar puncture is performed. The subcutaneous space contains superficial fascia and fat and is found immediately beneath the skin. After passing through the subcutaneous fascia, the needle passes through the supraspinous ligament and the interspinous ligament. Ref: Moon D.A., Foreman K.B., Albeine K.H. (2011). Chapter 1. Back.
