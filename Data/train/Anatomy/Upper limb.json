However, the skin over the thenar eminence is not affected as the branch of the median nerve supplying it arises in the forearm. Froment's sign/ book holding sign: The patient is unable to hold the book with thumb and other fingers. PAPER HOLDING TEST: The patient is unable to hold the paper between thumb and fingers. MOTOR CHANGES: Ape/monkey like thumb deformity, loss of opposition of the thumb. Index and middle fingers lag behind while making the fist due to paralysis of1st and 2nd lumbar muscles. SENSORY CHANGES: Loss of sensations on lateral 3 1/2 digits including nail beds and distal phalanges on the dorsum of the hand. VASOMOTOR CHANGES: The skin areas with sensory loss is warmer due to aeriolar dilatation; it is also drier due to the absence of sweating due to loss of sympathetic supply. TROPHIC CHANGES: Long-standing cases of paralysis lead to dry and scaly skin. The nails crack easily with atrophy of the pulp of fingers. It occurs both in males and females between the age of 25 and 70. They complain of intermittent attacks of pain in the distribution of the median nerve on one or both sides. The attacks frequently occur at night. Pain may be referred proximally to the forearm and arm. It is more common because of excessive working on the computer.

The posterior corners of the extensor expansion are joined by tendons of the interossei {proximal} and {distal} are often called' wing tendons' Near the proximal interphalangeal joint, the extensor tendon divides into a central slip and two collateral slips. The central slip is joined by some fibres from the margins of the expansion, crosses the proximal interphalangeal joint, and is inseed on the dorsum of the base of the middle phalanx. The two collateral slips are joined by the remaining thick margin of the extensor expansion. They then join each other and are inseed on the dorsum of the base of the distal phalanx. As the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints, the extensor expansion forms the dorsal pa of the fibrous capscule of the joints.

The latissimus dorsi and teres major also aid in adduction and medial rotation of the arm, so they may be able to compensate for the lack of extra muscle.

Nipple- conical projection below the centre of the breast at the level of 4th intercostal space. Areola-circular area of pigmented skin surrounding the base of the nipple. Contains a large number of sebaceous glands. Stroma- suppoing framework. The fibrous stroma forms septa, known as the suspensory ligament of copper. Parenchyma:-It is a tubuloalveolar gland which secretes milk. The gland consists of 15 to 20 lobes. Each lobe is a cluster of alveoli and is drained by lactiferous duct. The lactiferous ducts converge towards the nipple and open on it. Near its termination, each duct has a dilation called the lactiferous sinus Aerial supply:-Internal thoracic aery.
