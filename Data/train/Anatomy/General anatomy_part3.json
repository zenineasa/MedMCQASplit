Infarcts tend to be wedge-shaped, with the occluded vessel at the apex and the organ periphery forming the base (Fig. 3-17); when the base is a serosal surface, there is often an overlying fibrinous exudate. Lateral margins may be irregular, reflecting flow from adjacent vessels. The margins of acute infarcts typically are indistinct and slightly hemorrhagic; with time, the edges become better defined by a narrow rim of hyperemia attributable to inflammation. Infarcts resulting from aerial occlusions in organs without a dual circulation typically become progressively paler and sharply defined with time (Fig. 3-17, B). By comparison, hemorrhagic infarcts are the rule in the lung and other spongy organs (Fig. 3-17, A).

Grossly, the kidney may appear unchanged, or it may be abnormally large, pale, gray, and firm; in long-standing cases, the kidney may be reduced in size. Microscopically, the amyloid deposits are found principally in the glomeruli, but they also are present in the interstitial peritubular tissue as well as in the walls of the blood vessels. The glomerulus first develops focal deposits within the mesangial matrix and diffuse or nodular thickenings of the basement membranes of the capillary loops. With progression, the deposition encroaches on the capillary lumina and eventually leads to total obliteration of the vas- cular tuft (Fig. 4-34, A). The interstitial peritubular deposits frequently are associated with the appearance of amorphous pink casts within the tubular lumens, presumably of a pro- teinaceous nature. Amyloid deposits may develop in the walls of blood vessels of all sizes, often causing marked vascular narrowing. renal biopsy is useful in the presence of urinary abnormalities. Rectal and gingival biopsy specimens contain amyloid in as many as 75% of cases with generalized amyloidosis. Examination of abdominal fat aspirates stained with Congo red is a simple, low-risk method.

However these enzymes are structurally and mechanistically different. For a video of this process click here. A type I topoisomerase cuts one strand of a DNA double helix, relaxation occurs, and then the cut strand is re-ligated. Cutting one strand allows the pa of the molecule on one side of the cut to rotate around the uncut strand, thereby reducing stress from too much or too little twist in the helix. Such stress is introduced when the DNA strand is \"supercoiled\" or uncoiled to or from higher orders of coiling.

Most of these are members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, which contain in their cytoplasmic regions a conserved \"death domain, \" so named because it mediates interaction with other proteins involved in cell death. The prototypic death receptors are the type I TNF receptor and Fas (CD95). Fas ligand (FasL) is a membrane protein expressed mainly on activated T lymphocytes. When these T cells recognize Fas-expressing targets, Fas molecules are cross-linked by FasL and bind adaptor proteins the death domain. These in turn recruit and activate caspase-8. In many cell types caspase-8 may cleave and activate a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family called Bid, thus feeding into the mitochondrial pathway. The combined activation of both pathways delivers a lethal blow to the cell. Cellular proteins, notably a caspase antagonist called FLIP, block activation of caspases downstream of death receptors. Interestingly, some viruses produce homologues of FLIP, and it is suggested that this is a mechanism that viruses use to keep infected cells alive. The death receptor pathway is involved in elimination of self-reactive lympho- cytes and in killing of target cells by some cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",

Of the surfaces, one--the future flexor surface of the limb--is directed ventrally; the other, the extensor surface, dorsally; one border, the preaxial, looks forward toward the cephalic end of the embryo, and the other, the postaxial, backward toward the caudal end. The lateral epicondyle of the humerus, the radius, and the thumb lie along the preaxial border of the upper limb; and the medial epicondyle of the femur, the tibia, and the great toe along the corresponding border of the lower limb. The preaxial pa is derived from the anterior segments, the postaxial from the posterior segments of the limb-bud; and this explains, to a large extent, the innervation of the adult limb, the nerves of the more anterior segments being distributed along the preaxial (radial or tibial), and those of the more posterior along the postaxial (ulnar or fibular) border of the limb. The limbs next undergo a rotation or torsion through an angle of 90deg around their long axes the rotation being effected almost entirely at the limb girdles. In the upper limb the rotation is outward and forward; in the lower limb, inward and backward. As a consequence of this rotation the preaxial (radial)",

Once there, leukocytes clear the invaders and begin the process of digesting and getting rid of necrotic tissues. Acute inflammation has two major components (Fig. 2-2): * Vascular changes: alterations in vessel caliber resulting in increased blood flow (vasodilation) and changes in the vessel wall that permit plasma proteins to leave the cir- culation (increased vascular permeability). In addition, endothelial cells are activated, resulting in increased adhesion of leukocytes and migration of the leukocytes through the vessel wall. * Cellular events: emigration of the leukocytes from the circulation and accumulation in the focus of injury (cel- lular recruitment), followed by activation of the leuko- cytes, enabling them to eliminate the offending agent. The principal leukocytes in acute inflammation are neu- trophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes). Stimuli for Acute Inflammation Acute inflammatory reactions may be triggered by a variety of stimuli: * Infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic) are among the most common and medically impoant causes of inflammation. * Trauma (blunt and penetrating) and various physical and chemical agents (e. g., thermal injury, such as burns or frostbite; irradiation; toxicity from ceain environ- mental chemicals) injure host cells and elicit inflamma- tory reactions. * Tissue necrosis (from any cause), including ischemia (as in a myocardial infarct) and physical and chemical injury * Foreign bodies (splinters, di, sutures, crystal deposits) Immune reactions (also called hypersensitivity reactions) against environmental substances or against \"self\" tissues. Because the stimuli for these inflammatory responses often cannot be eliminated or avoided, such reactions tend to persist, with features of chronic inflam- mation. The term \"immune-mediated inflammatory disease\" is sometimes used to refer to this group of disorders. Although each of these stimuli may induce reactions with some distinctive characteristics, in general, all inflamma- tory reactions have the same basic features. In this section, we describe first how inflammatory stimuli are recognized by the host, then the typical reac- tions of acute inflammation and its morphologic features, and finally the chemical mediators responsible for these reaction",

The role NK cells play is analogous to that of cytotoxic T cells in the veebrate adaptive immune response. NK cells provide rapid responses to virus-infected cells, acting at around 3 days after infection, and respond to tumor formation. Typically, immune cells detect the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presented on infected cell surfaces, triggering cytokine release, causing lysis or apoptosis. NK cells are unique, however, as they have the ability to recognize stressed cells in the absence of antibodiesand MHC, allowing for a much faster immune reaction. They were named \"natural killers\" because of the initial notion that they do not require activation to kill cells that are missing \"self\" markers of MHC class 1. This role is especially impoant because harmful cells that are missing MHC I markers cannot be detected and destroyed by other immune cells, such as T lymphocyte cells.",

At the end of S phase the phosphatase cdc25c dephosphorylates tyrosine15 and this activates the cyclin B/CDK1 complex. Upon activation the complex is shuttled to the nucleus where it serves to trigger for entry into mitosis. However, if DNA damage is detected alternative proteins are activated which results in the inhibitory phosphorylation of cdc25c and therefore cyclinB/CDK1 is not activated. In order for the cell to progress out of mitosis, the degradation of cyclin B is necessary. The cyclin B/CDK1 complex also interacts with a variety of other key proteins and pathways which regulate cell growth and progression of mitosis. Cross-talk between many of these pathways links cyclin B levels indirectly to induction of apoptosis. The cyclin B/CDK1 complex plays a critical role in the expression of the survival signal survivin. Survivin is necessary for proper creation of the mitotic spindlewhich strongly affects cell bility, therefore when cyclin B levels are disrupted cells experience difficulty polarizing.

Granulo- mas are characteristic of ceain specific pathologic states; consequently, recognition of the granulomatous pattern is impoant because of the limited number of conditions (some life-threatening) that cause it (Table 2-8). Granulo- mas can form under three settings: * With persistent T-cell responses to ceain microbes (such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, T. pallidum, or fungi), in which T cell-derived cytokines are responsible for chronic macrophage activation. Tuberculosis is the proto- type of a granulomatous disease caused by infection and should always be excluded as the cause when granulomas are identified. * Granulomas may also develop in some immune- mediated inflammatory diseases, notably Crohn disease, which is one type of inflammatory bowel disease and an impoant cause of granulomatous inflammation in the United States. * They are also seen in a disease of unknown etiology called sarcoidosis, and they develop in response to rela- tively ine foreign bodies (e. g., suture or splinter), forming so-called foreign body granulomas. The formation of a granuloma effectively \"walls off\" the offending agent and is therefore a useful defense Disease Cause Tissue Reaction Tuberculosis Mycobacterium tuberculosis Caseating granuloma (tubercle): focus of activated macrophages (epithelioid cells), rimmed by fibroblasts, lymphocytes, histiocytes, occasional Langhans giant cells; central necrosis with amorphous granular debris; acid-fast bacilli Leprosy Mycobacterium leprae Acid-fast bacilli in macrophages; noncaseating granulomas Syphilis Treponema pallidum Gumma: microscopic to grossly visible lesion, enclosing wall of histiocytes; plasma cell infiltrate; central cells are necrotic without loss of cellular outline Cat-scratch disease Gram-negative bacillus Rounded or stellate granuloma containing central granular debris and neutrophils; giant cells uncommon Sarcoidosis Unknown etiology Noncaseating granulomas with abundant activated macrophages Crohn disease Immune reaction against intestinal bacteria, self antigens Occasional noncaseating granulomas in the wall of the intestine, with dense chronic inflammatory infiltrate Table 2-8 Examples of Diseases with Granulomatous Inflammation MORPHOLOGY In the usual H&E preparations (Fig. 2-23), some of the activated macrophages in granulomas have pink, granular cytoplasm with indistinct cell boundaries; these are called epithelioid cells because of their resemblance to epithelia. Typically, the aggregates of epithelioid macrophages are sur- rounded by a collar of lymphocytes. Older granulomas may have a rim of fibroblasts and connective tissue. Frequently, but not invariably, multinucleate giant cells 40 to 50 mm in diameter are found in granulomas.

The antibodies that are responsible typically are high-affinity antibodies capable of activating complement and binding to the Fc receptors of phagocytes. * Opsonization and phagocytosis. When circulating cells, such as erythrocytes or platelets, are coated (opsonized) with autoantibodies, with or without complement pro- teins, the cells become targets for phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages (Fig. 4-10, A). These phagocytes express receptors for the Fc tails of IgG anti- bodies and for breakdown products of the C3 comple- ment protein, and use these receptors to bind and ingest opsonized paicles. Opsonized cells are usually elimi- nated in the spleen, and this is why splenectomy is ofclinical benefit in autoimmune thrombocytopenia and some forms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. * Inflammation. Antibodies bound to cellular or tissue anti- gens activate the complement system by the \"classical\" pathway (Fig. 4-10, B). Products of complement activa- tion serve several functions (see Fig. 2-18, Chapter 2), one of which is to recruit neutrophils and monocytes, triggering inflammation in tissues. Leukocytes may also be activated by engagement of Fc receptors, which rec- ognize the bound antibodies. This mechanism of injury is exemplified by Goodpasture syndrome and pemphi- gus vulgaris. * Antibody-mediated cellular dysfunction. In some cases, antibodies directed against cell surface receptors impair or dysregulate cellular function without causing cell injury or inflammation (Fig. 4-10, C). In myasthenia gravis, antibodies against acetylcholine receptors in the motor end plates of skeletal muscles inhibit neuromuscular transmission, with resultant muscle weakness. Antibodies can also stimulate cellularresponses excessively. In Graves disease, antibodies against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor stim- ulate thyroid epithelial cells to secrete thyroid hormones, resulting in hypehyroidism. Antibodies against hor- mones and other essential proteins can neutralize and block the actions of these molecules, causing functional derangements.",

It is viually inevitable in the atheromas of advanced atherosclerosis, associated with intimal injury in the aoa and large aeries and characterized byaccumulation of lipids (Chapter 9). Although dystrophic calcification may be an incidental finding indicating insig- nificant past cell injury, it may also be a cause of organ dysfunction. For example, calcification can develop in aging or damaged hea valves, resulting in severely com- promised valve motion. Dystrophic calcification of the aoic valves is an impoant cause of aoic stenosis in elderly persons (Fig. 10-17, Chapter 10). The pathogenesis of dystrophic calcification involves initiation (or nucleation) and propagation, both of which may be either intracellular or extracellular; the ultimate end product is the formation of crystalline calcium phos- phate. Initiation in extracellular sites occurs in membrane- bound vesicles about 200 nm in diameter; in normal cailage and bone they are known as matrix vesicles, and in pathologic calcification they derive from degenerating cells. It is thought that calcium is initially concentrated in these vesicles by its affinity for membrane phospholipids, while phosphates accumulate as a result of the action of membrane-bound phosphatases. Initiation of intracellular calcification occurs in the mitochondria of dead or dyingcells that have lost their ability to regulate intracellular calcium. After initiation in either location, propagation of crystal formation occurs. This is dependent on the concen- tration of Ca2+ and PO4 -, the presence of mineral inhibitors, and the degree of collagenization, which enhances the rate of crystal growth.",

In the United States, low dietary intake is an infrequent culprit but is sometimes culpable in infants fed exclusively milk, the impoverished, the elderly, and teenagers subsist- ing predominantly on junk food. * Increased demands not met by normal dietary intake occur worldwide during pregnancy and infancy. * Malabsorption can occur with celiac disease or after gas- trectomy (Chapter 14). Regardless of the cause, iron deficiency develops insidiously. Iron stores are depleted first, marked by a decline in serum ferritin and the absence of stainable iron in the bone marrow. These changes are followed by a decrease in serum iron and a rise in the serum transferrin. Ultimately, the capac- ity to synthesize hemoglobin, myoglobin, and other iron- containing proteins is diminished, leading to microcytic anemia, impaired work and cognitive performance, and even reduced immunocompetence.",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 9/e p202 Immediate (Type I) Hypersensitivity Immediate hypersensitivity is a tissue reaction that occurs rapidly (typically within minutes) after the interaction of antigen with IgE antibody that is bound to the surface of mast cells in a sensitized host. The reaction is initiated by entry of an antigen, which is called an allergen because it triggers allergy. Many allergens are environmental substances that are harmless for most persons on exposure. Some people apparently inherit genes that make them susceptible to allergies. This susceptibility is manifested by the propen- sity of such persons to mount strong TH2 responses and, subsequently, to produce IgE antibody against the aller- gens. The IgE is central to the activation of the mast cells and release of mediators that are responsible for the clinical and pathologic manifestations of the reaction. Immediate hypersensitivity may occur as a local reaction that is merely annoying (e. g., seasonal rhinitis, or hay fever), severely debilitating (asthma), or even fatal (anaphylaxis). Sequence of Events in Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Most hypersensitivity reactions follow the same sequence of cellular responses (Fig. 4-7): * Activation of TH2 cells and production of IgE antibody. Aller- gens may be introduced by inhalation, ingestion, or injection. Variables that probably contribute to the strong TH2 responses to allergens include the route of entry, dose, and chronicity of antigen exposure, and the genetic makeup of the host. It is not clear if allergenic substances also have unique structural propeies that endow them with the ability to elicit TH2 responses. Immediate hypersensitivity is the prototypical TH2-mediated reaction. The TH2 cells that are induced secrete several cytokines, including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which are responsible for essentially all the reactions of immediate hypersensitivity. IL-4 stimulates B cells specific for the allergen to undergo heavy-chain class switching to IgE and to secrete this immunoglobulin isotype. IL-5 acti- vates eosinophils that are recruited to the reaction, and IL-13 acts on epithelial cells and stimulates mucus secre- tion. TH2 cells often are recruited to the site of allergic reactions in response to chemokines that are produced locally; among these chemokines is eotaxin, which also recruits eosinophils to the same site. * Sensitization of mast cells by IgE antibody. Mast cells are derived from precursors in the bone marrow, are widely distributed in tissues, and often reside near blood vessels and nerves and in subepithelial locations. Mast cells described in Chapter 2. Eosinophils are recruited by eotaxin express a high-affinity receptor for the Fc poion of the e heavy chain of IgE, called Fce. RI. Even though the serum concentration of IgE is very low (in the range of 1 to 100 ug/mL), the affinity of the mast cell Fce. RI recep- tor is so high that the receptors are always occupied by IgE. These antibody-bearing mast cells are \"sensitized\" to react if the antigen binds to the antibody molecules. Basophils are the circulating counterpas of mast cells. They also express Fce. RI, but their role in most immedi- ate hypersensitivity reactions is not established (since these reactions occur in tissues and not in the circula- tion). The third cell type that expresses Fce. RI is eosino- phils, which often are present in these reactions and also have a role in IgE-mediated host defense against hel- minth infections, described later. * Activation of mast cells and release of mediators. When a person who was sensitized by exposure to an allergen is reexposed to the allergen, it binds to multiple specific IgE molecules on mast cells, usually at or near the site of allergen entry. When these IgE molecules are cross- linked, a series of biochemical signals is triggered in the mast cells. The signals culminate in the secretion of various mediators from the mast cells. Three groups of mediators are the most impoant in different immediate hypersensitivity reactions (Fig. 4-8): Vasoactive amines released from granule stores. The gran- ules of mast cells contain histamine, which is released within seconds or minutes of activation. Histamine causes vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, and increased secretion of mucus. Other rapidly released mediators include adenosine (which causes bronchoconstriction and inhibits platelet aggregation) and chemotactic factors for neutrophils and eosinophils. Other mast cell granule contents that may be secreted include several neutral proteases (e. g., tryptase), which may damage tissues and also generate kinins and cleave comple- ment components to produce additional chemotactic and inflammatory factors (e. g., C3a) (Chapter 2). The granules also contain acidic proteoglycans (heparin, chondroitin sulfate), the main function of which seems to be as a storage matrix for the amines. Newly synthesized lipid mediators. Mast cells synthesize and secrete prostaglandins and leukotrienes, by the same pathways as do other leukocytes (Chapter 2). These lipid mediators have several actions that are impoant in immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is the most abundant media- tor generated by the cyclooxygenase pathway in mast cells. It causes intense bronchospasm as well as increased mucus secretion. The leukotrienes LTC4 and LTD4 are the most potent vasoactive and spasmo- genic agents known; on a molar basis, they are several thousand times more active than histamine in increas- ing vascular permeability and in causing bronchial smooth muscle contraction. LTB4 is highly chemotac- tic for neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes. Cytokines. Activation of mast cells results in the syn- thesis and secretion of several cytokines that are impoant for the late-phase reaction. These include TNF and chemokines, which recruit and activate leu- kocytes (Chapter 2); IL-4 and IL-5, which amplify th TH2-initiated immune reaction; and IL-13, which stimulates epithelial cell mucus secretion. In summary, a variety of compounds that act on blood vessels, smooth muscle, and leukocytes mediate type I hypersensitivity reactions (Table 4-2). Some of these com- pounds are released rapidly from sensitized mast cells and are responsible for the intense immediate reactions associ- ated with conditions such as systemic anaphylaxis. Others, such as cytokines, are responsible for the inflammation seen in late-phase reactions. Often, the IgE-triggered reaction has two well-defined phases (Fig. 4-9): (1) the immediate response, characterized by vasodilation, vascular leakage, and smooth muscle spasm, usually evident within 5 to 30 minutes after expo- sure to an allergen and subsiding by 60 minutes; and (2) a second, late-phase reaction that usually sets in 2 to 8 hours later and may last for several days and is characterized by inflammation as well as tissue destruction, such as mucosal epithelial cell damage. The dominant inflammatory cells in the late-phase reaction are neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes, especially TH2 cells. Neutrophils are recruited by various chemokines; their roles in inflammation were described in Chapter 2. Eosinophils are recruited by eotaxin.

The mesoderm forms mesencyme, mesothelium, non-epithelial blood cells and coelomocytes. Mesothelium lines coeloms. Mesoderm forms the muscles in a process known as myogenesis, septa (cross-wise paitions) and mesenteries (length-wise paitions); and forms pa of the gonads (the rest being the gametes). Myogenesis is specifically a function of mesemchyme. The mesoderm differentiates from the rest of the embryo through inercellular signalling, after which the mesoderm is polarized by an organizng center. The position of the organizing center is in turn determined by the regions in which beta-catenin is protected from degradation by GSK-3. Beta-catenin acts as a co-factor that alters the activity of the transcription factor tcf-3 from repressing to activating, which initiates the synthesis of gene products critical for mesoderm differentiation and gastrulation. Fuhermore, mesoderm has the capability to induce the growth of other structures, such as the neural plate, the precursor to the nervous system. Ref - wikipedia. org",

The binding of ligands - either in the form of adjuvant used in vaccinations or in the form of invasive moieties during times of natural infection - to the TLR marks the key molecular events that ultimately lead to innate immune responses and the development of antigen-specific acquired immunity. Upon activation, TLRs recruit adapter proteins(proteins that mediate other protein-protein interactions) within the cytosol of the immune cell in order to propagate the antigen-induced signal transduction pathway. These recruited proteins are then responsible for the subsequent activation of other downstream proteins, including protein kinases(IKKi, IRAK1, IRAK4, and TBK1) that fuher amplify the signal and ultimately lead to the upregulation or suppression of genes that orchestrate inflammatoryresponses and other transcriptional events. Some of these events lead to cytokine production, proliferation, and survival, while others lead to greater adaptive immunity. If the ligand is a bacterial factor, the pathogen might be phagocytosed and digested, and its antigens presented to CD4+ T cells. In the case of a viral factor, the infected cell may shut off its protein synthesis and may undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis).

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 9/e p273 Squamous Cell Carcinoma Squamous cell carcinoma is a common tumor arising on sun- exposed sites in older people. These tumors have a higher incidence in men than in women. In addition to sunlight, predisposing factors include industrial carcinogens (tars and oils), chronic ulcers, old burn scars, ingestion of arseni- cals, and ionizing radiation. As with squamous cell carci- nomas at other sites, those in the skin may be preceded by in situ lesions. PATHOGENESIS The most common exogenous cause of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is UV light exposure, which causes DNA damage (Chapter 5). TP53 mutations caused by UV light- induced DNA damage are common, as are activating mutations in HRAS and loss-of-function mutations in Notch receptors, which transmit signals that regulate the orderly differentiation of normal squamous epithelia. In addition to inducing mutations, UV light (UVB in paicular) may have a transient immunosuppressive effect on skin by impairing antigen presentation by Langerhans cells. This effect may contribute to tumorigenesis by weakening immunosurveil- lance. Patients who are immunosuppressed as a result of chemotherapy or organ transplantation, or who have xeroderma pigmentosum, are at increased risk. Tumors in immunosuppressed persons, paicularly organ transplant recipients, are likely to be associated with HPV infection. TP53 mutations caused by UV light-induced DNA damage are common, as are activating mutations in HRAS. As with squamous cell carcinomas at other sites, those in the skin may be preceded by in situ lesions. MORPHOLOGY Squamous cell carcinomas in situ appear as sharply defined, red, scaling plaques; many arise from prior actinic keratoses. More advanced, invasive lesions are nodular, show variable scale, and may ulcerate (Fig. 23-16, A). Microscopically, squa- mous cell carcinoma in situ is characterized by highly atypical cells at all levels of the epidermis, with nuclear crowding and disorganization. Invasive tumors, defined by penetration of the basement membrane (Fig. 23-16, B), show variable degrees of differentiation, ranging from tumors with cells arranged in orderly lobules that exhibit extensive keratiniza- tion to neoplasms consisting of highly anaplastic cells with foci of necrosis and only aboive, single-cell keratinization (dyskeratosis). Clinical Features Invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the skin often are discovered while small and resectable. Less than 5% have metastasized to regional nodes at diagnosis. The likelihood of metastasis is related to the thickness of the lesion and degree of invasion into the subcutis. Tumors arising in the context of actinic keratoses may be locally aggressive generally metastasize only after long periods of time, while those arising in burn scars, ulcers, and non-sun-exposed skin behave less predictably. Mucosal squamous cell carci- nomas (oral, pulmonary, esophageal, etc.) generally are much more aggressive.",

It is distinguished from focal lupus nephritis (class III) by involvement of half or more of glomeruli. Most of the glomeruli show endothelial and mesangial prolifera- tion, leading to diffuse hypercellularity of these structures (Fig. 4-18, B) and producing in some cases epithelial crescents that fill Bowman's space. When extensive, sub- endothelial immune complexes create a circumferential thickening of the capillary wall, resembling rigid \"wire loops\" on routine light microscopy (Fig. 4-18, C). Electron microscopy reveals prominent electron-dense subendo- thelial immune complexes (between endothelium and basement membrane) (Fig. 4-18, D), but immune com- plexes are also usually present in other pas of the capil- lary wall and in the mesangium. Immune complexes can be visualized by staining with fluorescent antibodies directed against immunoglobulins or complement, result- ing in a granular fluorescent staining pattern (Fig. 4-18, E). In due course, glomerular injury may give rise to scarring (glomerulosclerosis). Most affected patients have hematu- ria with moderate to severe proteinuria, hypertension, and renal insufficiency.",

The antigens may be normal molecules intrinsic to cell membranes or in the extracellular matrix, or they may be adsorbed exoge- nous antigens (e. g., a drug metabolite). Antibody-mediated abnormalities are the underlying cause of many human diseases; examples of these are listed in Table 4-3. In all of these disorders, the tissue damage or functional abnormali- ties result from a limited number of mechanisms. Mechanisms of Antibody-Mediated Diseases Antibodies cause disease by targeting cells for phagocyto- sis, by activating the complement system, and by interfer- ing with normal cellular functions (Fig. 4-10). The antibodies that are responsible typically are high-affinity antibodies capable of activating complement and binding to the Fc receptors of phagocytes. * Opsonization and phagocytosis. When circulating cells, such as erythrocytes or platelets, are coated (opsonized) with autoantibodies, with or without complement pro- teins, the cells become targets for phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages (Fig. 4-10, A). These phagocytes express receptors for the Fc tails of IgG anti- bodies and for breakdown products of the C3 comple- ment protein, and use these receptors to bind and ingest opsonized paicles. Opsonized cells are usually elimi- nated in the spleen, and this is why splenectomy is of Figure 4-10 Mechanisms of antibody-mediated injury. A, Opsonization of cells by antibodies and complement components, and ingestion of opso- nized cells by phagocytes. B, Inflammation induced by antibody binding to Fc receptors of leukocytes and by complement breakdown products. C, Antireceptor antibodies disturb the normal function of receptors.

In many cancer types, mutations affecting EGFR expression or activity could result in cancer. Epidermal growth factor and its receptor was discovered by Stanley Cohen of Vanderbilt University. Cohen shared the 1986 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Rita Levi-Montalcini for their discovery of growth factors. Deficient signaling of the EGFR and other receptor tyrosine kinases in humans is associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's, while over-expression is associated with the development of a wide variety of tumors.

The movements which take place between the sacrum and coccyx, and between the different pieces of the latter bone, are forward and backward; they are very limited. Their extent increases during pregnancy. A zygapophyseal joint (or facet joint) is a veebral joint between the superior aicular process of one veebra and the inferior aicular process of the one adjacent. It is of plane synol variety. In fact, all the joints of veebra are plane synol Except the median one- which is a symphysis (as expected *).*All midline joints tend to be symphysis, only very few Exceptions are there. E. g., spheno-occipital joint, which is a synchondrosis. Interveebral discs (or interveebral fibrocailage) lie between adjacent veebrae in the spine. Each disc forms a secondary cailaginous (symphysis) joint to allow slight movement of the veebrae, and acts as a ligament to hold the veebrae together. Discs consist of an outer annulus fibrosus, which surrounds the inner nucleus pulposus. The annulus fibrosus consists of several layers of fibrocailage. The strong annular fibers contain the nucleus pulposus and distribute pressure evenly across the disc. The nucleus pulposus contains loose fibers suspended in a mucoprotein gel the consistency of jelly. The nucleus of the disc acts as a shock absorber, absorbing the impact of the body&; s daily activities and keeping the two veebrae separated. The disc can be likened to a doughnut: whereby the annulus fibrosis is similar to the dough and the nucleus pulposis is the jelly. If one presses down on the front of the doughnut the jelly moves posteriorly or to the back. When one develops a prolapsed disc the jelly/ nucleus pulposis is forced out of the doughnut/ disc and may put pressure on the nerve located near the disc. This will give one the symptoms of sciatica if the disc herniation is at lumbosacral region. There is one disc between each pair of veebrae, Except for the first cervical segment, the atlas. There are a total of twenty-three discs in the spine. When the annulus fibrosus tears due to an injury or the aging process, the nucleus pulposus can begin to extrude through the tear, most commonly postero-lateral. This is called disc herniation. Near the posterior side of each disc, all along the spine, major spinal nerves extend out to different organs, tissues, extremities etc. It is very common for the herniated disc to press against these nerves (pinched nerve) causing radiating pain, numbness, tingling, and diminished strength and/or range of motion. In addition, the contact of the inner nuclear gel, which contains inflammatory proteins, with a nerve can also cause significant pain and muscle spasm. Nerve-related pain is called radicular pain.",

Umbilical aeries: The umbilical aeries are paired branches of the internal iliac aeries. These pass through the connective stalk (umbilical cord) and become continuous with the chorionic vessels of the developing placenta. These vessels carry deoxygenated blood. Fate(after bih): The proximal poion of the umbilical aery persist as the internal iliac and superior vesical aeries. The distal pas are obliterated to form the median umbilical ligaments. Single umbilical aery: (Seen in 1 to 2% of pregnancies) It is associated with aneuploidy as well as renal and cardiac abnormalities Observation of a Single Umbilical aery (two-vessel cord) should prompt one to loom carefully for additional anomalies in a newborn. Umbilical Veins: Umbilical veins appear as a pair of vessels to return blood from placenta to the fetus. The right umbilical vein is obliterated during the fifth gestational week. Left vein is left (right is obliterated) These vessels carry oxygenated blood. The oxygenated blood is shunted through the ductus venosus into the inferior vena cava and the hea.

Each 'fibre' is really a syncytium with hundreds of nuclei along its length (The 'fibre' is formed, during development, by fusion of numerous myoblasts). The nuclei are elongated and lie along the periphery of the fibre, just under the cell membrane (which is called the sarcolemma). The cytoplasm (or sarcoplasm) is filled with numerous longitudinal fibrils that are called myofibrils.

Surprisingly large amounts of amyloid may be present in any of these endocrine glands without apparent disturbance of function. In the gastrointestinal tract, a rela- tively ored site for deposition, amyloid may be found at all levels, sometimes producing tumorous masses that must be distinguished from neoplasms. Nodular depositions in the tongue may produce macroglossia. On the basis of the frequent involvement of the gastrointestinal tract in systemic cases, gingival, intestinal, and rectal biopsies serve in the diag- nosis of suspected cases.

Ulcers can develop in the stomach or duodenum and usually heal after suppression of gastric acid production and, if present, eradication of the H. pylori. H. pylori: Chronic gastritis, most commonly due to H. pylori infection, promotes the development and progres- sion of cancers that may be induced by diverse genetic alterations (Chapter 5). As is the case with many forms of chronic inflammation, H. pylori-induced chronic gastritis is associated with increased production of proinflamma- tory proteins, such as interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). It is therefore not surprising that polymorphisms associated with enhanced production of these cytokines confer increased risk of chronic gastritis- associated intestinal-type gastric cancer in those with co- existing H. pylori infection.",

This requirement explains the tropism of the virus for CD4+ T cells and its ability to infect other CD4+ cells, paicularly macrophages and DCs. However, binding to CD4 is not sufficient for infection; the HIV envelope gp120 must also bind to other cell surface molecules (coreceptors) to facilitate cell entry. Two cell surface chemokine receptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, serve this role. HIV envelope gp120 (noncovalently attached to transmembrane gp41) binds initially to CD4 molecules (Fig. 4-27). This binding leads to a conformational change that exposes a new recognition site on gp120 for the core- ceptors CXCR4 (mostly on T cells) or CCR5 (mostly on macrophages). The gp41 then undergoes a conformational change that allows it to inse into the target membrane, and this process facilitates fusion of the virus with the cell. After fusion, the virus core containing the HIV genome enters the cytoplasm of the cell.",

Unprotected miners of radioactive elements have a 10-fold increased incidence of lung cancers. Follow-up study of survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki disclosed a markedly increased incidence of leukemia--principally myelogenous leukemias--after an average latent period of about 7 years, as well as increased moality rates for thyroid, breast, colon, and lung carcino- mas. The nuclear power accident at Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union continues to exact its toll in the form of high cancer incidence in the surrounding areas. More recently, it is feared that radiation release from a nuclear power plant in Japan damaged by a massive eahquake and tsunami will result in significantly increased cancer incidence in the surrounding geographic areas. Therapeutic irradiation of the head and neck can give rise to papillary thyroid cancers years later. The oncogenic propeies of ionizing radiation are related to its mutagenic effects; it causes chromosome breakage, translocations, and, less frequently, point mutations. Biologically, double- stranded DNA breaks seem to be the most impoant form of DNA damage caused by radiation. The oncogenic effect of UV rays merits special mention because it highlights the impoance of DNA repair in car- cinogenesis. Natural UV radiation derived from the sun can cause skin cancers (melanomas, squamous cell carcino- mas, and basal cell carcinomas). At greatest risk are fair- skinned people who live in locales such as Australia and New Zealand that receive a great deal of sunlight. Non- melanoma skin cancers are associated with total cumula- tive exposure to UV radiation, whereas melanomas are associated with intense intermittent exposure--as occurs with sunbathing. UV light has several biologic effects on cells. Of paicular relevance to carcinogenesis is the ability to damage DNA by forming pyrimidine dimers This type of DNA damage is repaired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway. With extensive exposure to UV light, the repair systems may be overwhelmed, and skin cancer results. As mentioned earlier, patients with the inherited disease xeroderma pigmentosum have a defect in the nucleotide excision repair pathway. As expected, there is a greatly increased predisposition to skin cancers in this disorder.",

Infectious microbes usually enter through these routes and attempt to colonize the hosts. The mechanisms of innate immunity operate at every step in a microbe's attempt to invade. At the site of entry, epithelia serve as physical barriers to infections and eliminate microbes through production of peptide antibiotics and the actions of intraepithelial lymphocytes. If microbes are able to survive and traverse these epithelia, they encounter phagocytes, including neutrophils, which are rapidly recruited from the blood into tissues, and macrophages, which live in tissues under epithelia. The function of these phagocytic cells is to ingest microbes and destroy them by producing microbicidal substances. In response to recogni- tion of microbes, phagocytes, DCs, and many other cell types secrete proteins called cytokines (described later), which promote inflammation and microbial killing and enhance protective immune responses. Cells use several receptors to sense microbes; foremost among these are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), so named because of homology with the Drosophila Toll protein, that recognize bacterial and viral components (Chapter 2). NK cells kill virus- infected cells and produce the macrophage-activating cyto- kine IFN-g. If the microbes enter the blood, many plasma proteins, including the proteins of the complement system, recognize the microbes and are activated, and their products kill microbes and coat (opsonize) the microbes for phagocytosis. In addition to combating infections, innate immune responses stimulate subsequent adaptive immu- nity, providing signals that are essential for initiating the responses of antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes.",

        "question": "Which of the following disease is mediated through complement activation",
        "exp": "Ref Harrison 16/e p327, 328,; Robbins 9/e p207 Immune Complex Diseases (Type III Hypersensitivity) Antigen-antibody (immune) complexes that are formed in the circulation may deposit in blood vessels, leading to complement activation and acute inflammation. The antigens in these com- plexes may be exogenous antigens, such as microbial pro- teins, or endogenous antigens, such as nucleoproteins. The mere formation of immune complexes does not equate with hypersensitivity disease; small amounts of antigen- antibody complexes may be produced during normal immune responses and are usually phagocytosed and destroyed. It is only when these complexes are produced in large amounts, persist, and are deposited in tissues that they are pathogenic. Pathogenic immune complexes may form in the circulation and subsequently deposit in blood vessels, or the complexes may form at sites where antigen has been planted (in situ immune complexes). Immune complex-mediated injury is systemic when complexes are formed in the circulation and are deposited in several organs, or it may be localized to paicular organs (e. g., kidneys, joints, or skin) if the complexes are formed and deposited in a specific site. The mechanism of tissue injury is the same regardless of the pattern of distribution; however, the sequence of events and the conditions leading to the formation of systemic and local immune complexes are different and are considered separately in the following descriptions. Immune complex diseases are some of the most common immunologic diseases (Table 4-4). Systemic Immune Complex Disease The pathogenesis of systemic immune complex disease can be divided into three phases: (1) formation of antigen- antibody complexes in the circulation and (2) deposition of the immune complexes in various tissues, thereby initiat- ing (3) an inflammatory reaction in various sites through- out the body (Fig. 4-11). Acute serum sickness is the prototype of a systemic immune complex disease. It was first described in humans when large amounts of foreign serum were administered for passive immunization (e. g., in persons receiving horse serum containing antidiphtheria antibody); it is now seen only rarely (e. g., in patients injected with rabbit or horse antithymocyte globulin for treatment of aplastic anemia or graft rejection, or patients with snakebite given anti-venom antibody made in animals). Although serum sickness is no longer common, the study of its pathogenesis sheds light on the mechanisms of human immune complex diseases. Approximately 5 days after the foreign protein is injected, specific antibodies are produced; these react with the antigen still present in the circulation to form antigen- antibody complexes. The complexes deposit in blood vessels in various tissue beds, triggering the subsequent injurious inflammatory reaction. Several variables determine whether immune complex forma- tion leads to tissue deposition and disease. Perhaps foremost among these factors is the size of the complexes. Very large complexes or complexes with many free IgG Fc regions (typically formed in antibody excess) are rapidly removed from the circulation by macrophages in the spleen and liver and are therefore usually harmless. The most pathogenic complexes are formed during antigen excess and are small or intermediate in size and are cleared less effectively by phagocytes and therefore circulate longer. In addition, the charge of the complex, the valency of the antigen, the avidity of the antibody, and the hemodynamics of a given vascular bed all influence the tendency to develop disease. The ored sites of deposition are kidneys, joints, and small blood vessels in many tissues. Localization in the kidney and joints is explained in pa by the high hemody- namic pressures associated with the filtration function of the glomerulus and the synovium. For complexes to leave the circulation and deposit within or outside the vessel wall, an increase in vascular permeability also must occur. This is probably triggered when immune complexes bind to leukocytes and mast cells by means of Fc and C3b recep- tors and stimulate release of mediators that increase vas- cular permeability. Once complexes are deposited in the tissue, the third phase, the inflammatory reaction, ensues. During this phase (approximately 10 days after antigen administration), clini- cal features such as fever, uicaria, ahralgias, lymph node enlargement, and proteinuria appear. Wherever immune complexes deposit, characteristic tissue damage occurs. The immune complexes activate the complement system, leading to the release of biologically active frag- ments such as the anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a), which increase vascular permeability and are chemotactic for neutrophils and monocytes (Chapter 2). The complexes also bind to Fcg receptors on neutrophils and monocytes, activating these cells. Attempted phagocytosis of immune complexes by the leukocytes results in the secretion of a variety of additional pro-inflammatory substances, includ- ing prostaglandins, vasodilator peptides, and chemotactic substances, as well as lysosomal enzymes capable of digest- ing basement membrane, collagen, elastin, and cailage, and reactive-oxygen species that damage tissues. Immune complexes can also cause platelet aggregation and activate Hageman factor; both of these reactions augment the inflammatory process and initiate formation of micro- thrombi, which contribute to the tissue injury by producing local ischemia (Fig. 4-11). The resultant pathologic lesion is termed vasculitis if it occurs in blood vessels, glomerulo- nephritis if it occurs in renal glomeruli, ahritis if it occurs in the joints, and so on. Predictably, the antibody classes that induce such lesions are complement-fixing antibodies (i. e., IgG and IgM) and antibodies that bind to phagocyte Fc receptors (IgG). During the active phase of the disease, consumption of complement may result in decreased serum complement levels. The role of complement- and Fc receptor-dependent inflammation in the pathogenesis of the tissue injury is suppoed by the observation that experimental depletion of serum complement levels or knockout of Fc receptors in mice greatly reduces the severity of lesions, as does deple- tion of neutrophils. SUMMARY Pathogenesis of Diseases Caused by Antibodies and Immune Complexes * Antibodies can coat (opsonize) cells, with or without complement proteins, and target these cells for phagocy- tosis by macrophages, which express receptors for the Fc tails of IgG molecules and for complement proteins. The result is depletion of the opsonized cells. * Antibodies and immune complexes may deposit in tissues or blood vessels, and elicit an acute inflammatory reaction by activating complement, with release of breakdown products, or by engaging Fc receptors of leukocytes. The inflammatory reaction causes tissue injury. * Antibodies can bind to cell surface receptors or essential molecules, and cause functional derangements (either inhibition or unregulated activation) without cell injury. MORPHOLOGY The morphologic appearance of immune complex injury is dominated by acute necrotizing vasculitis, microthrombi, and superimposed ischemic necrosis accompanied by acute inflammation of the affected organs. The necrotic vessel wall takes on a smudgy eosinophilic appearance called fibrinoid necrosis, caused by protein deposition (see Fig. 1-13, Chapter 1). Immune complexes can be visualized in the tissues, usually in the vascular wall (examples of such deposits in the kidney in lupus are shown in Fig. 4-18, E). In due course, the lesions tend to resolve, especially when they were brought about by a single exposure to antigen (e. g., in acute serum sickness or acute poststreptococcal glomerulo- nephritis) (Chapter 13). However, chronic immune complex disease develops when there is persistent antigenemia or repeated exposure to an antigen. This occurs in some human diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Most often, even though the morphologic changes and other find- ings strongly implicate immune complex disease, the inciting antigens are unknown.",

The plasma membrane of the apoptotic cell remains intact, but the membrane is altered in such a way that the cell and its fragments become avid targets for phagocytes. The dead cell and its fragments are rapidly cleared before cellular contents have leaked out, so apoptotic cell death does not elicit an inflammatory reac- tion in the host. Apoptosis differs in this respect from necro- sis, which is characterized by loss of membrane integrity, enzymatic digestion of cells, leakage of cellular contents, and frequently a host reaction (Fig. 1-6 and Table 1-1).

The skin is involved in a majority of patients; a characteristic erythematous or maculopapular eruption over the malar eminences and bridge of the nose (\"butterfly pattern\") is observed in approximately half of the cases. Exposure to sunlight (UV light) exacerbates the erythema (so-called photosensitivity), and a similar rash may be present elsewhere on the extremities and trunk, frequently in sun-exposed areas. Histopathologic findings include lique- factive degeneration of the basal layer of the epidermis, edema at the dermoepidermal junction, and mononuclear infiltrates around blood vessels and skin appendages (Fig. 4-19, A). Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals deposi- tion of immunoglobulin and complement at the dermoepi- dermal junction (Fig. 4-19, B); similar immunoglobulin and complement deposits may also be present in apparently unin- volved skin. Joints. Joint involvement is frequent but usually is not associ- ated with striking anatomic changes or with joint deformity. When present, it consists of swelling and a nonspecific mono- nuclear cell infiltration in the synol membranes. Erosion of the membranes and destruction of aicular cailage, such as in RA, are exceedingly rare. CNS. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement also is very common, with focal neurologic deficits and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms. CNS disease often is ascribed to vascular lesions causing ischemia or multifocal cerebral microinfarcts. Small vessel angiopathy with noninflammatory intimal proliferation is the most frequent pathological lesion; frank vasculitis is uncommon. The angiopathy may result from thrombosis caused by antiphospholipid antibodies. Premature atherosclerosis occurs and may contribute to CNS ischemia. Another postulated mechanism for CNS disease is injury from antineuronal antibodies with conse- quent neurologic dysfunction, but this hypothesis remains unproved. Other Organs. The spleen may be moderately enlarged. Capsular fibrous thickening is common, as is follicular hyper- plasia with numerous plasma cells in the red pulp. Central penicilliary aeries characteristically show thickening and perivascular fibrosis, producing onion-skin lesions. Pericardium and pleura, in paicular, are serosal mem- branes that show a variety of inflammatory changes in SLE ranging (in the acute phase) from serous effusions to fibrinous exudates that may progress to fibrous opacification in the chronic stage. Involvement of the hea is manifested primarily in the form of pericarditis. Myocarditis, in the form of a nonspecific mononuclear cell infiltrate, and valvular lesions, called Libman-Sacks endocarditis, also occur but are less common in the current era of aggressive coicosteroid therapy. This nonbacterial verrucous endocarditis takes the form of irregular, 1- to 3-mm way deposits, seen as distinctive lesions on either surface of the leaflets (i. e., on the surface exposed to the forward flow of the blood or on the underside of the leaflet) (see Chapter 10). An increasing number of patients also show clinical and anatomic manifes- tations of coronary aery disease. The basis of accelerated atherosclerosis is not fully understood, but the process seems to be multifactorial; ceainly, immune complexes can deposit in the coronary vasculature, leading to endothelial damage by that pathway. Moreover, glucocoicoid treatment causes alterations in lipid metabolism, and renal disease (common in SLE) causes hypertension; both of these are risk factors for atherosclerosis (Chapter 9). Many other organs and tissues may be involved. The changes consist essentially of acute vasculitis of the small vessels, foci of mononuclear infiltrations, and fibrinoid deposit Absence of IgG The serum electrophoretic pattern of the patient showed absence of immunoglobulin G and an increase of the IgA and IgM precipitation bands",

The rolling leukocytes are able to sense changes in the endothelium that initiate the next step in the reaction of leukocytes, which is firm adhesion to endothelial sur- faces.

The latter feature probably explains why benign tumors such as lipomas and leiomyomas transform to malignancies rarely, if at all. In practice, the determination of benign versus malignant is made with remarkable accuracy using long-established clinical and anatomic criteria, but some neoplasms defy easy character- ization. Ceain features may indicate innocence, and others may indicate malignancy. Such problems are not the rule, however, and there are four fundamental features by which benign and malignant tumors can be distinguished: dif- ferentiation and anaplasia, rate of growth, local invasion, and metastasis. Differentiation and Anaplasia Differentiation and anaplasia are characteristics seen only in the parenchymal cells that constitute the transformed elements of neoplasms. The differentiation of parenchymal tumor cells refers to the extent to which they resemble their normal forebears morphologically and functionally. * Benign neoplasms are composed of well-differentiated cells that closely resemble their normal counterpas. A lipoma is made up of mature fat cells laden with cytoplasmic lipid vacuoles, and a chondroma is made up of mature cailage cells that synthesize their usual cailaginous matrix--evidence of morphologic and functional differentiation. In well-differentiated benign tumors, mitoses are usually rare and are of normal configuration. * Malignant neoplasms are characterized by a wide range of parenchymal cell differentiation, from sur- prisingly well differentiated (Fig. 5-3) to completel undifferentiated. For example, well-differentiated ade- nocarcinomas of the thyroid may contain normal- appearing follicles. Such tumors sometimes may be difficult to distinguish from benign proliferations. Between the two extremes lie tumors loosely referred to as moderately well differentiated. The stroma carrying the blood supply is crucial to the growth of tumors but does not aid in the separation of benign from malignant ones. The amount of stromal connective tissue does deter- mine, however, the consistency of a neoplasm. Ceain cancers induce a dense, abundant fibrous stroma (des- moplasia), making them hard, so-called scirrhous tumors. * Malignant neoplasms that are composed of undiffer- entiated cells are said to be anaplastic. Lack of differen- tiation, or anaplasia, is considered a hallmark of malignancy. The term anaplasia literally means \"back- ward formation\"--implying dedifferentiation, or loss of the structural and functional differentiation of normal cells. It is now known, however, that at least some cancers arise from stem cells in tissues; in these tumors, failure of differentiation, rather than dedifferentiation of specialized cells, accounts for their undifferentiated appearance. Recent studies also indicate that in some cases, dedifferentiation of apparently mature cells does occur during carcinogenesis. Anaplastic cells display marked pleomorphism (i. e., variation in size and shape) (Fig. 5-4). Often the nuclei are extremely hyperchromatic (dark-staining) and large resulting in an increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio that may approach 1: 1 instead of the normal 1: 4 or 1: 6. Giant cells that are considerably larger than their neighbors may be formed and possess either one enormous nucleus or several nuclei. Anaplastic nuclei are variable and bizarre in size and shape. The chromatin is coarse and clumped, and nucle- oli may be of astounding size. More impoant, mitoses often are numerous and distinctly atypical; anarchic multi- ple spindles may produce tripolar or quadripolar mitotic figures (Fig. 5-5). Also, anaplastic cells usually fail to develop recognizable patterns of orientation to one another (i. e., they lose normal polarity). They may grow Figure 5-3 Well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. The tumor cells are strikingly similar to normal squamous epithelial cells, with intercellular bridges and nests of keratin (arrow). (Couesy of Dr. Trace Worrell, Depament of Pathology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, Texas.) Figure 5-4 Anaplastic tumor of the skeletal muscle (rhabdomyosar- coma). Note the marked cellular and nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchro- matic nuclei, and tumor giant cells. (Couesy of Dr. Trace Worrell, Depa in sheets, with total loss of communal structures, such as glands or stratified squamous architecture. The more differentiated the tumor cell, the more com- pletely it retains the functional capabilities of its normal counterpas. Benign neoplasms and even well-differenti- ated cancers of endocrine glands frequently elaborate the hormones characteristic of their origin. Well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas produce keratin (Fig. 5-3), just as well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas secrete bile. In other instances, unanticipated functions emerge. Some cancers may elaborate fetal proteins not produced by comparable cells in the adult. Cancers of nonendocrine origin may produce so-called ectopic hormones. For example, ceain lung carcinomas may produce adrenocor- ticotropic hormone (ACTH), parathyroid hormone-like hormone, insulin, glucagon, and others. More is said about these phenomena later. Despite exceptions, the more rapidly growing and the more anaplastic a tumor, the less likely it is to have specialized functional activity. Of relevance in the discussion of differentiation and ana- plasia is dysplasia, referring to disorderly but non-neoplastic proliferation. Dysplasia is encountered principally in epi- thelial lesions. It is a loss in the uniformity of individual cells and in their architectural orientation. Dysplastic cells exhibit considerable pleomorphism and often possess hyperchro- matic nuclei that are abnormally large for the size of the cell. Mitotic figures are more abundant than usual and frequently appear in abnormal locations within the epithe- lium. In dysplastic stratified squamous epithelium, mitoses are not confined to the basal layers, where they normally occur, but may be seen at all levels and even in surface cells. There is considerable architectural anarchy. For example, the usual progressive maturation of tall cells in the basal layer to flattened squames on the surface may be lost and replaced by a disordered scrambling of dark basal- appearing cells (Fig. 5-6). When dysplastic changes are marked and involve the entire thickness of the epithelium, the lesion is referred to as carcinoma in situ, a preinvasive stage of cancer (Chapter 18). Although dysplastic changes often are found adjacent to foci of malignant transforma- tion, and long-term studies of cigarette smokers show that epithelial dysplasia almost invariably antedates the appear- ance of cancer, the term dysplasia is not synonymous with cancer; mild to moderate dysplasias that do not involve the entire thickness of the epithelium sometimes regress completely, par- ticularly if inciting causes are removed.",

Germ cells are the cells that develop into the embryo and later on become the cells that make up the reproductive system of men and women. Most germ cell tumors occur in the testes or ovaries (gonads) or the lower back. When these tumors occur outside of the gonads, they are known as extragonadal tumors. Researchers do not know how extragonadal germ cell tumors form. One theory suggests that germ cells accidentally migrate during to unusual locations early during the development of the embryo (embryogenesis). Normally, such misplaced germ cells degenerate and die, but in cases of extragonadal teratomas researchers speculate that these cells continue to undergo mitosis, the process where cells divide and multiply, eventually forming a teratoma. Sacrococcygeal teratomas are thought to arise from an area under the coccyx called \"Henson's Node\". This is an area where primitive cells persist (germ cells) that can give rise to cells of the three major tissue layers of an embryo: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. These embryonic layers eventually give rise to the various cells and structures of the body. Sacrococcygeal teratomas can contain mature tissue that looks like any tissue in the body, or immature tissue resembling embryonic tissues. Ref- <a href=\"",

The women may present with acute pain in the lateral aspect of breast or the anterior chest wall. A tender cordlike superficial thrombosed vein is formed and when the skin over the breast is stretched by raising the arm, a narrow r shallow subcutaneous groove alongside the cord becomes apparent, Rarely it may be bilateral. Management It's a benign self-limited disorder. The differential diagnosis is lymphatic permeation from an occult carcinoma of the breast. When the diagnosis is unceain or a mass is present near the cord, a biopsy may be done. Treatment An inflammatory drugs and warm compresses Restricted arm movements as well as brassiere suppo of breast o It usually resolves within 4 to 6 weeks.

As stated, medullary carcinomas do not arise from the follicu- lar epithelium. Genetic alterations in the three follicular cell- derived malignancies are clustered along two oncogenic pathways--the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3K)/AKT pathway (Fig. 19-13). In normal cells, these pathways are transiently activated by binding of soluble growth factor ligands to the extracellular domain of receptor tyrosine kinases, which results in autophosphorylation of the cytoplas- mic domain of the receptor, permitting intracellular signal transduction. In thyroid carcinomas, as with many solid cancers (Chapter 5), gain-of-function mutations along components of these pathways lead to constitutive activation even in the absence of ligand, thus promoting carcinogenesis. Environmental Factors. The major risk factor predispos- ing to thyroid cancer is exposure to ionizing radiation, paicularly during the first 2 decades of life. In keeping with this finding, there was a marked increase in the incidence of papillary carcinomas among children exposed to ionizing radiation after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986.

Another group of antibodies is directed against surface antigens of blood cells, while yet another is reactive with proteins in complex with phospho- lipids (antiphospholipid antibodies) (Chapter 3). * Antinuclear antibodies. ANAs are directed against several nuclear antigens and can be grouped into four catego- ries: (1) antibodies to DNA, (2) antibodies to histones, (3) antibodies to nonhistone proteins bound to RNA, and (4) antibodies to nucleolar antigens. Table 4-10 lists several autoantibodies, including ANAs, and their asso- ciation with SLE as well as with other autoimmune dis- eases, to be discussed later. The most widely used method of detecting ANAs is the indirect immunofluo- rescence assay (IFA), which screens for autoantibodies that bind to a variety of nuclear antigens, including DNA, RNA, and proteins. Four staining patterns are seen with IFA: homogeneous or diffuse, rim or periph- eral, speckled, and nucleolar. While each pattern can be suggestive of the presence of specific autoantibodies, the strength of these associations is limited and should not be relied on. ANA testing by IFA is extremely sensitive, as more than 95% of patients with SLE will test positive, but the test's specificity is quite limited, because patients with other autoimmune diseases, chronic infections, and cancer will test positive as well. Fuhermore, ANAs are seen in approximately 5% to 15% of healthy people, and the incidence increases with age. Recently, the IFA has been replaced in many clinical laboratories by multiplex flow cytometry immunoassays that can simultaneously test for multiple specific autoantibodies, but these assays may lack the sensitivity of the IFA. Antibodies to double- stranded DNA (ds. DNA) and the so-called Smith (Sm) antigen can be detected by ELISA or multiplex flow methods and are specific for SLE. * Other autoantibodies. Antibodies against blood cells, including red cells, platelets, and lymphocytes, are found in many patients. Antiphospholipid antibodies are present in 40% to 50% of patients with lupus and react with a wide variety of proteins in complex with phospholipids. Some bind to cardiolipin antigen, used in serologic tests for syphilis, so patients with lupus may have a false-positive test result for syphilis. Antiphos- pholipid antibodies contribute to coagulation abnormal- ities, which are described below. Mechanisms of Tissue Injury Regardless of the exact sequence by which autoantibodies are formed, they are likely to be the mediators of tissue injury, probably through multiple mechanisms. * Most organ damage in SLE is caused by immune complex deposition. Skin and kidney biopsies from patients with SLE typically demonstrate diffuse and heavy granular deposits of complement and immunoglobulin. Autoan- tibodies complexed with DNA can be detected as well. These deposits of immune complexes had been thought to cause tissue damage by activating the classical com- plement pathway (type III hypersensitivity); 75% of patients will have reduced serum levels of C3 and C4 at the time of SLE flares, presumably because complement is being activated and consumed faster than it can be produced. However, people and rodents deficient in C1q are not protected from SLE and actually can spon- taneously develop SLE, raising the possibility that complement-independent mechanisms may also con- tribute to tissue damage. * Autoantibodies of different specificities contribute to the pathology and clinical manifestations of SLE (type II hyper- sensitivity). Autoantibodies against red cells, white cells, and platelets opsonize these cells and lead to their phagocy- tosis, resulting in cytopenias. Autoantibodies against various phospholipids lead to increased thrombosis in patients, with varied clinical consequences, including recurrent spontaneous aboion and thrombotic epi- sodes. These disorders are pa of the antiphospholipid syndrome. Paradoxically, these antibodies interfere with clotting tests and are actually called \"lupus anticoagu- lants. \" Autoantibodies are also produced against clot- ting factors such as thrombin, and these too may contribute to clotting disorders. Autoantibodies against central nervous system receptors for various neurotransmit- ters have been implicated in the neuropsychiatric com- plications of the disease. * There is no evidence that ANAs can permeate intact cells. However, if cell nuclei are exposed, the ANAs can bind to them. In tissues, nuclei of damaged cells react with ANAs, lose their chromatin pattern, and become homogeneous, to produce so-called LE bodies or hema- toxylin bodies. An in vitro correlate of this is the LE cell, a neutrophil or macrophage that has engulfed the dena- tured nucleus of another injured cell. When blood is withdrawn and agitated, a number of leukocytes are sufficiently damaged to expose their nuclei to ANAs, with secondary complement activation; these antibody- and complement-opsonized nuclei are then readily phagocytosed. Although the LE cell test is positive in as many as 70% of patients with SLE, it is now largely of historical interest.",

It is commonly called scleroderma because the skin is a major target, but this disorder is better labeled \"systemic\" because lesions are present throughout the body. Cutaneous involvement is the usual presenting manifestation and eventually appears in approximately 95% of cases, but it is the visceral involvement--of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, kidneys, hea, and skeletal muscles--that is responsible for most of the related mor- bidity and moality. SS can be classified into two groups on the basis of its clinical course: * Diffuse scleroderma, characterized by initial widespread skin involvement, with rapid progression and early vis- ceral involvement * Limited scleroderma, with relatively mild skin involve- ment, often confined to the fingers and face. Involve- ment of the viscera occurs late, so the disease in these patients generally has a fairly benign course. This clini- cal presentation is also called the CREST syndrome because of its frequent features of calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia.",

The protein made by the APC gene plays a critical role in several cellular processes that determine whether a cell may develop into a tumor. The APC protein helps control how often a cell divides, how it attaches to other cells within a tissue, how the cell polarizes and the morphogenesis of the 3D structures, or whether a cell moves within or away from a tissue. This protein also helps ensure that the chromosome number in cells produced through cell division is correct. The APC protein accomplishes these tasks mainly through association with other proteins, especially those that are involved in cell attachment and signaling. The activity of one protein in paicular, beta-catenin, is controlled by the APC protein (see: Wnt signaling pathway). Regulation of beta-catenin prevents genes that stimulate cell division from being turned on too often and prevents cell overgrowth. The human APC gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 in band q22. 2 (5q22. 2). The APCgene has been shown to contain an internal ribosome entry site. APC ohologs have also been identified in all mammals for which complete genome data are available.",

        "exp": "Ref Robbins 8/e p 45, 9/e p74 The acute inflammatory response rapidly delivers leuko- cytes and plasma proteins to sites of injury. Once there, leukocytes clear the invaders and begin the process of digesting and getting rid of necrotic tissues. Acute inflammation has two major components (Fig. 2-2): * Vascular changes: alterations in vessel caliber resulting in increased blood flow (vasodilation) and changes in the vessel wall that permit plasma proteins to leave the cir- culation (increased vascular permeability). In addition, endothelial cells are activated, resulting in increased adhesion of leukocytes and migration of the leukocytes through the vessel wall. * Cellular events: emigration of the leukocytes from the circulation and accumulation in the focus of injury (cel- lular recruitment), followed by activation of the leuko- cytes, enabling them to eliminate the offending agent. The principal leukocytes in acute inflammation are neu- trophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes). Stimuli for Acute Inflammation Acute inflammatory reactions may be triggered by a variety of stimuli: * Infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic) are among the most common and medically impoant causes of inflammation. * Trauma (blunt and penetrating) and various physical and chemical agents (e. g., thermal injury, such as burns or frostbite; irradiation; toxicity from ceain environ- mental chemicals) injure host cells and elicit inflamma- tory reactions. * Tissue necrosis (from any cause), including ischemia (as in a myocardial infarct) and physical and chemical injury * Foreign bodies (splinters, di, sutures, crystal deposits * Immune reactions (also called hypersensitivity reactions) against environmental substances or against \"self\" tissues. Because the stimuli for these inflammatory responses often cannot be eliminated or avoided, such reactions tend to persist, with features of chronic inflam- mation. The term \"immune-mediated inflammatory disease\" is sometimes used to refer to this group of disorders. Although each of these stimuli may induce reactions with some distinctive characteristics, in general, all inflamma- tory reactions have the same basic features. In this section, we describe first how inflammatory stimuli are recognized by the host, then the typical reac- tions of acute inflammation and its morphologic features, and finally the chemical mediators responsible for these reactions.",

It induces chemotaxis in target cells, primarily neutrophils but also other granulocytes, causing them to migrate toward the site of infection. IL-8 also stimulates phagocytosis once they have arrived. IL-8 is also known to be a potent promoter of angiogenesis. In target cells, IL-8 induces a series of physiological responses required for migration and phagocytosis, such as increases in intracellular Ca2+, exocytosis (e. g. histamine release), and the respiratory burst. IL-8 can be secreted by any cells with toll-like receptors that are involved in the innate immune response. Usually, it is the macrophages that see an antigen first, and thus are the first cells to release IL-8 to recruit other cells. Both monomer and homodimerforms of IL-8 have been repoed to be potent inducers of the chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. The homodimer is more potent, but methylation of Leu25 can block the activity of homodimers.",
