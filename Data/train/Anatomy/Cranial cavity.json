QStructures Marked in the DiagramA* Oculomotor nerveB* Abducens nerveC* Ophthalmic nerveD* Maxillary nerve\"The abducens nerve is the sixth cranial nerve and innervates lateral rectus exclusively. It emerges from the brain stem between the pons and the medulla oblongata and usually runs through the inferior venous compartment of the petroclival venous confluence in a bow-shaped canal, Dorello's canal. It then bends sharply across the upper border of the petrous part of the temporal bone to enter the cavernous sinus, where it lies lateral to the internal carotid artery (unlike the oculomotor, trochlear, ophthalmic and maxillary nerves, which merely in vaginale the lateral dural wall of the sinus). The abducens nerve enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure, within the common tendinous ring, at first below, and then between, the two divisions of the oculomotor nerve and lateral to the nasociliary nerve.

The sinus extends from the superior orbital fissure to the apex of the petrous temporal bone, with an average length of 2 cm and width of 1 cm. i. Tributaries of the cavernous sinus are the superior ophthalmic vein, a branch from the inferior ophthalmic vein (or sometimes the wrhole vessel), the superficial middle cerebral vein, inferior cerebral veins and sphenoparietal sinus.
