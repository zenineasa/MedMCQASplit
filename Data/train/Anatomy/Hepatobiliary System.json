Accessory pancreatic duct opens at its summit (Duct of Santorini).

Distal part- dorsal bud. Accessory pancreatic duct -- From dorsal bud (proximal)* Islets of Langerhans -- derived from the primitive duct system* The tributaries drain into the major pancreatic duct at right angles to its long axis, forming a \"Herring bone\" pattern",

Terminal hepatic vein is in the centre of the lobule and area around the hepatic vein is called centrilobular zone. o At periphery of lobule, lies the portal tract containing hepatic artery, bile duct and portal vein. Area around portal tract is called periportal zone. o These three structures (portal vein, hapatic artery and bile duct) form portal triad. o Area between periportal zone and centrilobular zone is called midzonal area, o All around the central vein are the major parenchymal cells, i. e. hepatocytes. o Lobule contains sinusoid (sinusoidal capillaries) which have fenestrated endothelium covering the subendothelial space of Disse. This space contains stellate cell processes and hepatocellular microvilli, o Other important cells of liver are Kupjfer cells, which belong to monocytic-macrophage sytem and function as phagocytic cells.",
