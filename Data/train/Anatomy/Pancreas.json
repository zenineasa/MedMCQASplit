        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Pancreas divisum o Pancreas divisum is the most common clinically significant congenital pancreatic anomaly, with an incidence 3% to 10% in autopsy series. o Pancreas or Pancreatic divisum is a congenital anomaly in the anatomy of the ducts of the pancreas in which a single pancreatic duct is not formed, but rather remains as two distinct dorsal and ventral ducts, o The human embryo begins life with two ducts in the pancreas, the ventral duct and the dorsal duct. Normally, the two ducts will fuse together to form one main pancreatic duct; this occurs in more than 90% of embryos. In approximately 10% of embryos the ventral and dorsal ducts fail to fuse together, resulting in pancreas divisum. o In utero, the majority' of the pancreas is drained by the dorsal duct which opens up into the minor papilla. The ventral duct drains the minority' of the pancreas and opens into the major papilla. In adults howover, this situation is reversed whereby 70% of the pancreas is drained by the ventral duct. Therefore in pancreas divisum, where fusion of the ducts does not occur, the major drainage of the pancreas is done by the dorsal duct which opens up into the minor papilla.",
