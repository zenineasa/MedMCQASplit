It is 'V' shaped with right and left lamina. Both laminae (alae) meet anteriorly forming an angle of 90deg in males and 120deg in females and forms laryngeal prominence. Vocal cords are attached to the middle of thyroid angle. Upper border of thyroid cartilage lies at C3-C4 junction (at upper border of O). Thyroid cartilage itself lies at C4-C5 level.Cricoid (unpaired)o It is the only cartilage forming a complete ring, therefore is shaped like a ring. It articulates with arytenoid cartilage to form cricoarytenoid joint, a type of synovial joint. It lies at the level of C6 vertebra.Epiglottis (unpaired)o It is leaf-shaped elastic cartilage (in adults). It is omega shaped in children. It forms the anterior wall of laryngeal inlet. It lies above glottis.Arytenoid cartilage (paired)o Each Arytenoid cartilage is pyramidal in shape. Base articulates with cricoid cartilage, and apex supports the comiculate cartilage. A vocal process directed anteriorly and gives attachement to vocal cord. A muscular process directed laterally and gives attachment to intrinsic laryngeal muscles.Corniculate cartilage (of Santorini) : Pairedo Articulates writh apex of Arytenoid cartilageCuneiform cartilage (of Wrisberg) : Pairedo Situated in aryepiglottic fold in front of comiculate cartilage.",

It opens space between the vocal cords (abduct) by rotating the arytenoids laterally (abduct), causing the vocal cords to separate opening the rima glottidis. Posterior cricoarytenoid muscle is called the safety muscle because ail the intrinsic muscles are adductors of the vocal cords except posterior cricoarytenoids which are abductors. The cricothyroid muscle is the only tensor of the larynx aiding with phonation and should not to be confused with the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, which are the only muscles directly responsible for opening (abducting) the space between the vocal cords.Laryngeal muscleAction1.Aryepiglottic MuscleDraws the epiglottis posteriorly and downward during swallowing2.Oblique ArytenoidDraws arytenoid cartilages together, adducting vocal folds3.Transverse ArytenoidDraws arytenoid cartilages together, adducting vocal folds4.ThyroarytenoideusDraws arytenoid cartilage forward, relaxing and adducting the vocal folds5.Vocalis muscle^Relaxes segments of the vocal ligament, thereby adjusting voice pitch.Educational Points# Larynx begins at C4 & ends at C7 vertebral levels Q# The only intrinsic muscle of larynx that lies outside the laryngeal framework is Cricothyroid.LIGAMENTS OF LARYNX# The extrinsic ligaments of the larynx are those connecting the thyroid cartilage and epiglottis with the hyoid bone and the cricoid cartilage with the trachea.# The intrinsic ligaments of the larynx are those connecting several cartilages ofthe organ to each other. They are considered the elastic membrane of the larynx.A Structural ligaments - hold larynx, hyoid and trachea together1. Thyrohyoid membrane-link thyroid cartilage to hyoid bone;medial part is median thyrohyoid ligament.2. Cricothyroid membrane - links cricoid to thyroid cartilage; thickened medial and anterior part called Median cricothyroid ligament.3. Cricotracheal ligament - links cricoid to first tracheal cartilage.4. Quadrangular membrane - links arytenoid to epiglottis; lower free edge is called vestibular ligament.5. Thyroepiglottic ligament - links epiglottis to thyroid cartilage.B. Functional LigamentsConus elasticus - elastic membrane forming vibrating lips; arises from entire upper edge of arch of cricoid; attaches anteriorly to thyroid cartilage, posteriorly to vocal processes of arytenoid cartilages; upper free edges are thickened to form vocal ligaments; opening between vocal ligaments is called rima glottidis.
