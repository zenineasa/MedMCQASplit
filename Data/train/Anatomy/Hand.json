PRECISION GRIP: It is used for doing fine work like holding a pen and requires movements of thumb like opposition and adduction. It uses around 25% the power of power grip. The muscles of pinch grip can be divided into lateral, medial and intermediate subgroups. The lateral subgroup (opposition muscles) moves the first metacarpal into palmar abduction. Muscles of the medial subgroup (abductor pollicis brevis and first dorsal interosseous) produce an approach of the first metacarpal towards the palm. Since they act with the lateral group they have a strong controlling effect on the position and rotation of the first metacarpal. The intermediate subgroup consists simply of flexor pollicis longus, which flexes the interphalangeal or metacarpophalangeal joint",
