Base is occupied by a concavoconvex articular surface for trapezium. Dorsal surface of the shaft is uniformly convex. Head is less convex and broader from side to side than the heads of other metacarpals. The ulnar and radial comers of the palmar surface show impressions for sesamoid bones. It is rotated medially through 90 degrees relative to other metacarpals. As a result, movements of the thumb occur at right angles to those of the digits. It does not articulate with any other mtacarpal bones.",
