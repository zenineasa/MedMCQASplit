There are 4 types of tissues in the body. Epithelial tissue. Connective tissue. Muscular tissue. Nervous tissue. Epithelial tissue covers the outer surface of the body and the luminal surfaces of cavities within the body, along with lining the ducts and secretory elements of glands. Classification of epithelium. Simple epithelium - consisting of only one layer of cells. Multilayereda). Stratifiedb). Transitional3. Pseudostratified - single layered, but give the appearance of multilayered, because of the arrangement of the nuclei at different levels. Simple Epitheliuma). Squamous?- The cells are flattened, their heights being very little as compared to their width.- found in- Alveoli of lungs- Endothelium of blood vessels & lymphatics- Mesothelium of serous membranes (pleura, pericardium, peritoneum)- Endocardium of heab). Cuboidal epithelium- Height is almost same as the width- found in- Follicles of the thyroid gland- Germinal epithelium of ovary- Ducts of many glands- Proximal convoluted tubules of the kidneys (here the cuboidal epithelium has brush border)c) Columnar epithelium- The cells are taller than their width. It is fuher classified according to the nature of the free surfaces of the cells. i) Simple columnar epithelium- No paicular specialization- found in mucous membrane of stomach and large intestineii) Columnar cells with brush border- Here the cell surface has microvilli. The microvilli are visible only with electron microscope. With light microscope the microvilli appear as brush border.- found in- Gallbladder- Small intestineiii) Ciliated columnar epithelium- The cell surface bears cilia. The movement of the cilia helps propel the fluid.- found in- Most of the respiratory tract- Fallopian tubes- Efferent ductules of testis. Stratified epitheliuma). Stratified squamous epithelium. This type of epithelium is made up of several layers of cells. The deepest layer is columnar and in proceeding towards the surface, the cells become increasingly flattened.

Pseudostratified This is a simple columnar epithelium, only one cell thick but cells are of varying height. Some cells are sho, not reaching the surface, others are tall columnar and few are goblet cells. Thus their nuclei lie at different levels giving pseudo appearance of many layers.- found in- Sensory epithelium of olfactory area- Trachea and large bronchi- Pas of auditory tube- Ductus deferens",

The nerve ascends alongside the spinal cord and enters the skull through the foramen magnum. It then turns laterally to join the cranial root. The two roots unite and leave the skull through the jugular foramen. The roots then separate: The cranial root joins the vagus nerves and is distributed in its branches to the muscles of the soft palate and pharynx ( the pharyngeal plexus) and to the muscles of the larynx (except the cricothyroid muscle). The spinal root runs downward and laterally and enters the deep surface of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which it supplies, and then crosses the posterior triangle of the neck to supply the trapezius muscle.

As the nerve enters the forearm from behind the medial epicondyle, it supplies- Flexor carpi ulnaris and- Medial half of the flexor digitorum profundus.

The posterior cutaneous branch supplies- The skin over the medial 1/3 of the dorsum of the hand and- Medial 11/2 fingers. The ulnar nerve enters the palm by passing superficial to the flexor retinaculum and divides into its superficial and deep terminal branches. The superficial terminal branch supplies - The palmaris brevis and the skin of the palmar surface of the medial 11/2 fingers, including their nail beds. The deep terminal branch supplies- all the muscles of the hand except the muscles of the thenar eminence and the first two lumbricals, which are supplied by the median nerve Branches of Ulnar Nerve.

In high ulnar nerve injury at or proximal to elbow, all the muscles supplied by the ulnar nerve in the forearm and hand are paralyzed whereas in low ulnar nerve palsy, there is sparing of the forearm muscles (in flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum profundus). Sensory deficit are same in both high & low ulnar nerve injury. Clinical findings in injury at Elbow Motor- Flexion of the wrist joint results in abduction d/t paralysis of flexor carpi ulnaris- Medial border of the front of the forearm will show flattening owing to the wasting of the underlying ulnaris and profundus muscles.- The patient is unable to adduct and abduct the fingers d/t paralysis of the interossei (Palmar interossei adduct the fingers - PAD. Dorsal interossei abduct the fingers - DAB). They can be tested by Egawa's Test and Card test. Egawa's Test: (for dorsal interossei). The patient is asked to abduct his fingers, with the hand kept flat on the table, palmar surface down. Card Test: (for palmar interrossei). The patient is asked to hold a card between his two extended fingers. Examiner tries to pull the card out.- Pt. is unable to adduct the thumb because of paralysis of adductorpollicis. This can be checked by Froment's sign or the 'book test'. Froment's sign/book sign: (for adductorpollicis). The patient is asked to grasp a book between the thumb and index finger. Due to paralysis of the adductor pollicis, he does so by strongly contracting the flexor pollicis Langus and thus flexing the terminal phalanx of thumb (A normal person would keep his thumb extended).- The metacarpophalangeal joints become hyperextended because of the paralysis of the lumbricals and interossei muscles, which normally flex these joints. As the first and second lumbricals are not paralyzed, being supplied by the median nerve, the hyperextension of the metacarpophalangeal joints is most prominent in the fouh and fifth fingers. The interphalangeal joints are flexed, owing again to the paralysis of the lumbricals and interossei muscles which normally extend these joints. In long standing cases the hand assumes the characteristic 'claw' deformity (main en griffe)- Wasting of the paralyzed muscle result in flattening of the hypothenar eminence and loss of the convex curve of the medial border of the hand.- Dorsum of the hand shows hollowing between the metacarpal bones d/t atrophy of the dorsal interossei muscle. Sensory- Loss of sensations over medial 1/3 hand and 11/2 digits. Vasomotor changes- The skin areas involved in sensory loss are warmer and drier than normal because of the aeriolar dilatation and absence of sweating resulting from loss of sympathetic tone. Clinical findings in injury at Wrist. The small muscles of the hand will be paralyzed and show wasting except for the muscle of the thenar eminence and the first two lumbricals. The claw hand is much more obvious in wrist lesions because the flexor digitorutn profundus muscle is not paralyzed causing marked flexion of the terminal phalanges Sensory loss and Vasomotor change are almost similar to high ulnar nerve injury..",

There are two layers of pleura:- (i) Visceral (pulmonary) pleura intimately invests the lungs and is developed from splanchnopleural mesoderm, and (ii) Parietal pleura is developed from smatopleural mesoderm. Parietal pleura is divided into 4 pas (i) cervical (dome), (ii) costal, (iii) diaphragmatic, and (iv) mediastinal. Lines of pleural reflection are? 1. Lower border (costodiaphragmatic line of pleural reflection):- Stas at xiphistemal joint, crosses midclavicular line at 8th rib and midaxillary line at 10th rib and ends posteriory 2 cm lateral to spinous process of T1, veebra. 2. Anterior border (costomediastinal line of pleural reflection):- It differs on right and left side. Right side:- Begining from sternoclavicular joint, it descends downwards and medially to reach sternal angle close to midling and fuher extends upto xiphisternal joint (upto 6th sternochondral joint) in midline. Left side:- Begining from stenoclavicular joint, it descends downward and medially to sternal angle and then descands veically close to midline upto 4th rib. Below this level it detes away from midline lying lateral (2-15 mm) to sternal margin to reach the 6th sternochondral junction. This detion is known as cardiac notch of pleura. Due to this, the left half of lower pa of body of sternum is directly related to peircardium without intervening pleural sac. This area is known as superficial area of cardiac dullness. 3. Posterior border:- Extends from a point 2 cm lateral to 7th cervical veebra to a point 2 cm lateral to the 12th thoracic beebra. Pleural innervation. Parietal pleura is pain sensitive and is supplied by intercostal and phrenic nerves. The costal and peripheal pa of diaphragmatic pleura is supplied by intercostal nerves and the mediastinal and central pa of diaphragmatic pleura is supplied by phrenic nerve. Pulmonary (visceral) pleura is pain insensitive and is innervated by autonomic nerves (sympathetic from T2-T5 spinal nerves and parasympathetic from vagus).",

The rising systemic and falling pulmonary aery pressure causes a flow reversal through the ductus aeriosus from right to left to left to right within minutes of bih. Complete closure of the ductus aeriosus appears to be due to a decline of local prostacyclin levels and usually occurs within 24 to 48 hours after bih. Ref: Moon D. A., Foreman K. B., Albeine K. H.

It originally develops within the mesentery and is covered by mesentery, but later. fuses with the posterior body wall to become a retroperitoneal organ. Liver and Spleen develop within the mesentery of the stomach and remain intraperitoneal organs. Let's have a look on development of above organs in brief. Liver (& gall bladder): Develops from endodermal bud at the distal end of the foregut. Liver bud grows into the ventral mesogastrium & penetrates the septum transversum. Umbilical & vitelline veins in the septum transversum are broken to form the sinusoids of the liver. Endomermal cells of the hepatic bud give rise to the parenchyma of the liver and to bile capillaries. The mesoderm of the septum transversum gives rise to hematopoietic cells, Kupffer cells and connective tissue cells. The small caudal pa of the hepatic diveiculum (bud) becomes the gall bladder and the stalk of the diveiculum forms the cystic duct. Pancreas: It is formed by two endodermal buds, dorsal and ventral arising from caudal pa of the foregut. The larger dorsal pancreatic bud grows between the layers of the dorsal mesentery and the ventral bud develops in ventral mesentery. With the rotation of the duodenum, ventral bud is carried dorsally with the bile duct. It soon lies posterior to dorsal bud and later fuses with it. The ventral bud forms the uncinate process and inferior pa of the head of the pancreas: The remaining pa of the gland is derived from the dorsal bud. Pancreas is said to be secondarily retroperitoneal as it is originally covered by peritoneum, but later fuses with the posterior body wall to become retroperitoneal. Spleen: It is derived from mesenchymal cells located between the layers of the dorsal mesogastrium. Dorsal mesogastrium gets divided into -Gastrosplenic ligament from stomach to spleen. Lienorenal ligament. froth spleen to the left kidney. Kidneys: Kidneys develop from two sources. Metanephros - give rise to excretory tubules. Ureteric bud - diveiculum arising. from lower pa of mesonephric duet gives rise to the collecting pa of the kidney & ureter. Kidneys do not develop in mesentery of the stomach. They are retroperioneal from the beginning. Note: Some students were of the view that the question was asked - 'which organ develops from the mesentery of the stomach. ' In that case 'spleen' is the only option in whose development mesenchymal cells from the dorsal mesogastrium contribute. Rest of the given options- Liver, Pancreas and Kidneys do not take origin from the mesentery of the stomach.",

As oxygen diffuses into the blood, it combines with hemoglobin. However, the oxygen, in combination with hemoglobin, does not contribute to the PO2 of blood. Therefore the alveolar - capillary gradient of PO2 is maintained much longer than it would be if hemoglobin were not present. The sequence mey be visualized as follows:- i) Oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the plasma due to the PO2 gradient. ii) To sta with, the PO2 in the RBC fluids is the same as in the plasma. As soon as diffusion from the alveoli to plasma raises the PO2 of plasma above that of the RBC fluids, oxygen diffuses from the plasma into the RBC. iii) As soon as oxygen enters the RBC, it combines with hemoglobin, which mops up oxygen but does not let PO2 rise. The process continues till hemoglobin cannot pick up any more oxygen. iv) Then the PO2 in the RBC fluids rises to equal that in the plasma and diffusion from the plasma to RBC stops. v) After that the PO2 in the plasma also rises to equal that in the alveoli, and consequently diffusion from the alveoli to the plasma stops. Thus, the presence of hemoglobin makes an enormous difference to the amount of oxygen transferred. By mopping up oxygen without letting the PO2 rise, it lets the diffusion of oxygen continue much longer. While the PO2 gradient determines the direction of diffusion of oxygen, it is actually hemoglobin that lays the trap for carrying large amounts of oxygen in the blood.",

Umbilical Cord: Initially, there are four vessels two aeries and two veins. Of the two umbilical veins, the right vein disappears by the 4th month, leaving behind one vein (left) which carries oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetus. (Remember: Left vein is left behind). The aeries carry the venous blood from the fetus to the placenta. Abnormalities: Single umbilical aery is present in about 1% of cases. This finding is sometimes. It is referred to as a 2-vessel cord. The loss of 1 umbilical aery likely occurs secondary to thrombotic atrophy of a previously normal aery. Less likely, the loss may result from primary agenesis of the aery. It is the left umbilical aery that is more commonly absent. It is more common in twins and in babies born of diabetic mothers. It is frequently associated with congenital malformation of the fetus. Ref: 1) Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology: Obstetrics.

Predisposing physiologic factors include the low perfusion pressure at the splenic flexure, a watershed area, a decrease in perfusion associated with colonic motility, and sustained mesenteric vasospasm associated with systemic hypotension or other severe physiologic stress produced by sympathetic activity. There are several weak points in the colonic blood supply, known as watershed areas, which result from incomplete anastomoses of the marginal aeries. These watershed areas are more vulnerable to ischemic injury than other pas of the colon. Splenic flexure is the watershed territory between SMA and IMA. Ref: Tyagi S., Cappell M. S. (2012).

Later, as the neural plate is induced, FGF8 maintains Nodal expression in the lateral plate mesoderm, as well as LEFTY-2, and both of these genes upregulate PITX2. PITX2 is a homeobox-containing transcription factor responsible for establishing left-sidedness. Also, it is expressed on the left side of the hea, stomach, and gut primordia, and, if expressed ectopically, it results in laterality defects. Simultaneously, LEFTY is expressed on the left side of the floor plate of the neural tube and may act as a barrier to prevent left-sided signals from crossing over.

This finding can best be explained by a lesion of which of the following structures?",
        "exp": "The patient's inability to detect the position of his toe reflects a lack of conscious proprioception for this pa of his body. Conscious proprioception, discriminative touch, and vibration sense are all carried by the dorsal column/medial lemniscus system. The fact that he can still perceive light touch and painful stimuli indicates that his anterolateral system is unimpaired. In the dorsal column/medial lemniscus system, the primary neuron's cell body is located in the dorsal root ganglia and sends its projection to the cord through the dorsal roots. The fibers do not synapse in the cord, but rather ascend the cord in the dorsal columns. Fibers carrying information from the legs ascend in the fasciculus gracilis; those receiving input from the arms project in the fasciculus cuneatus. Both ascend to the caudal medulla, where they terminate in the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus, respectively. The secondary neurons originating from these nuclei cross as the internal arcuate fibers, ascend as the medial lemniscus, then synapse in the ventroposterolateral (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus. Teiary neurons from the VPL project to the ipsilateral somatosensory coex. Therefore, a lack of conscious proprioception from the right toe could result from lesions to the right fasciculus gracilis, the right nucleus gracilis, the left medial lemniscus, the left VPL, or left somatosensory coex. The right fasciculus cuneatus carries discriminative touch, proprioception, and vibration information from the upper extremities. The right lateral lemniscus, pa of the auditory system, receives input from the contralateral cochlear nuclei and from the superior olivary nuclei, and projects to the inferior colliculus. The right medial lemniscus carries discriminative touch, proprioception, and vibration information from the left side of the body. Ref: Waxman S. G. (2010). Chapter 5. The Spinal Cord. In S. G.

Sympathetic supply is motor to sphincter vesicae and inhibitory to detrusor muscle. Nerve supply of bladder. Bladder is supplied by both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers. Parasympathetic: Preganglionic fibers arise from S2 to S4 cord segments, pass pelvic splanchnic nerves. After relay in ganglion cells in pelvic plexus (inferior hypogastric plexus) and in bladder wall, postganglionic fibers supply detrusor muscle. Contraction of detrusor muscle is mediated by cholinergic muscarinic receptors(M3). Preganglionic parasympathetic neurons at S2, and S4cord segments innervating bladder form sacral micturition center. Sympathetic: Preganglionoic fibers arise from lateral horn cells of T1-L2 cord segments and pass lower lumbar splanchnic nerves, superior hypogastric plexus (presacral nerve of Latarjet) to reach inferior hypogastric (pelvic) plexus. After relay in pelvic ganglia, postganglionic sympathetic fibers (i) stimulate sphincter vesicae (internal urethral sphincter) a, adrenoceptors and (ii) cause relaxation of detrusor muscle 132 adrenoceptors. It can also inhibit presynaptically the parasympathetic ganglia a, adrenoceptors. Visceral afferents: (1) pain fibers from bladder pass through both parasympathetic and sympathetic pathway and enter TH-L2 and S2-S4 cord segments, hence referred pain is felt in lower pa of anterior abdominal wall (hypogastrium), upper pa of front of thigh, scrotum or labium majus, penis or clitoris, and perineum. Centrally, spinothalmic pathway conducts pain impulses from bladder. Stretch afferents: arising from stretch receptors in the bladder wall pass pelvic splanchnic nerves, enter S2, S3 and S4 cord segments and establish reflex connections with sacral micturition center, which innervates detrusor. So afferent and efferent limb of this micturition reflex is formed by pelvic splanchnic nerves.

Cranial Nerve III: Oculomotor. Fibers extend from the ventral midbrain, pass through the superior orbital fissure, and go to the extrinsiceye muscles. Functions in raising the eyelid, directing the eyeball, constricting the iris, and controlling lens shape. Parasympathetic cell bodies are in the ciliary ganglia. Cranial Nerve IV: Trochlear. Fibers emerge from the dorsal midbrain and enter the orbits the superior orbital fissures; innervate the superior oblique muscle. Primarily a motor nerve that directs the eyeball. Cranial Nerve V: Trigeminal. Three divisions: ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3). Fibers run from the face to the pons the superior orbital fissure (V1), the foramen rotundum (V2), and the foramen ovale (V3). Conveys sensory impulses from various areas of the face (V1) and (V2), and supplies motor fibers (V3) for mastication. Cranial Nerve VI: Abdcuens. Fibers leave the inferior pons and enter the orbit the superior orbital fissure. Primarily a motor nerve innervating the lateral rectus muscle. Cranial Nerve VII: Facial. Fibers leave the pons, travel through the internal acoustic meatus, and emerge through the stylomastoid foramen to the lateral aspect of the face. Mixed nerve with five major branches. Motor functions include facial expression, and the transmittal of autonomic impulses to lacrimal and salivary glands. Sensory function is taste from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Cranial Nerve VIII: Vestibulocochlear. Two divisions - cochlear (hearing) and vestibular (balance). Functions are solely sensory - equilibrium and hearing. Cranial Nerve IX: Glossopharyngeal. Fibers emerge from the medulla, leave the skull the jugular foramen, and run to the throat. Nerve IX is a mixed nerve with motor and sensory functions. Motor - innervates pa of the tongue and pharynx and provides motor fibers to the parotid salivary gland. Sensory - fibers conduct taste and general sensory impulses from the tongue and pharynx. Cranial Nerve X: Vagus. Fibers emerge from the medulla the jugular foramen. The vagus is a mixed nerve. Its sensory function is in taste. Cranial Nerve XI: Accessory. The spinal root passes upward into the cranium the foramen magnum. The accessory nerve leaves the cranium the jugular foramen. Primarily a motor nerve. Supplies fibers to the larynx, pharynx, and soft palate. Cranial Nerve XII: Hypoglossal. Fibers arise from the medulla and exit the skull the hypoglossal canal.
