Each Bivalent look like a single thick structure, but is actually two pairs of sister chromatids held together by the synaptonemal complex. Genetic recombination between non-sister chromatids is completed at this point, with sites where it has occurred, appearing as recombination nodules in the center of the synaptonemal complex. 4. Diplotene: - During diplotene, the synaptonemal complex disassembles and pairs of homologous chromosomes, now much shoened, separated, except where crossing over has occurred (chiasmata). This process is called disjunction. In the ovaries: - Primary oocyte gets arrested in diplotene by the fifth month is utero and each remains at this stage until the period before ovulation.
