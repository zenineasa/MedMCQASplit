Therefore, this part is mesodermal in origin. ii) Lower l/3rd: It is derived from sinovaginal bulb which intum is derived from urogenital sinus. Thus, this part is endodermal in origin.",

        "exp": "ANSWER: (A) Genital ridge. REF: Ganong's 22nd ed chapter 23. On each side of the embryo, a primitive gonad arises from the genital ridge, a condensation of tissue near the adrenal gland. The gonad develops a cortex and a medulla. Until the sixth week of development, these structures are identical in both sexes. In genetic males, the medulladevelops during the seventh and eighth weeks into a testis, and the cortex regresses. Leydig and Sertoli cells appear, and testosterone and miillerian inhibiting substance are secreted. In genetic females, the cortex develops into an ovary and the medulla regresses.",

Pg. 33)CLITORIS# Clitoris develops from genital tubercle.# It is an female erectile organ, homologus with penis and is located near the superior extremity of the vulva.# It is not traversed by urethra.# It projects downward between the branched extremities of the labia minora.# It is composed of a glans, a corpus, and two crura, Corpus spongiosum is absent.# The glans is made up of spindle-shaped cells, and in the body there are two corpora cavernosa, in the walls of which are smooth muscle fibers.# The clitoris rarely exceeds 2 cms in length.# Its free end which is pointed downward and inward toward the vaginal opening is formed by round tubercle called glans clitoris, highly sensitive for sexual response.# The glans is covered by stratified squamous epithelium that is richly supplied with free nerve endings.# Tactile discs are found in abundance in these areas. Additional educational point:# The round ligament corresponds embryologically to the (distal) gubernaculum testis of men.",
