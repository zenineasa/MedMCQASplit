        "exp": "Ref: Grays Anatomy 40th Ed Pg 225. Explanation: Spinal cord. It occupies the superior two-thirds of the vertebral canal. It is continuous cranially with the medulla oblongata. It forms caudal Iv the conus medullaris. Front the apex of conus medullars. a connective tissue filament, the filum terminale. descends to the dorsum of the first coccygeal vertebral segment. The cord extends from the upper border of the atlas to the junction between the first and second lumbar vertebrae. Its average length in males is 45 cm. Its weight approximately 30 g. During development, the vertebral column elongates more rapidly than the spinal cord, so that there is an increasing discrepancy between the anatomical level of spinal cord segments and their corresponding vertebrae.* At birth, the spinal cord terminates at the lower border of the second lumbar vertebra, and may sometimes reach the third lumbar vertebra.
