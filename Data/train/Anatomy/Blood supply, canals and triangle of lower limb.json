It arises at the anterior aspect of the ankle joint and is a continuation of the anterior tibial aery. =Popliteal Aery is palpated at popliteal fossa =Post Tibial Aery-The posterior tibial aery pulse can be readily palpated halfway between the posterior border of the medial malleolus and the achilles tendon",
