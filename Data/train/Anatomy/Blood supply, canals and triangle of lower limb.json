It arises at the anterior aspect of the ankle joint and is a continuation of the anterior tibial aery. =Popliteal Aery is palpated at popliteal fossa =Post Tibial Aery-The posterior tibial aery pulse can be readily palpated halfway between the posterior border of the medial malleolus and the achilles tendon",

        "exp": "Anterior tibial compament syndrome is characterized by ischemic necrosis of the muscles of the anterior tibial compament of the leg resulting from damage to the anterior tibial aery. The gastrocnemius receives blood from sural branches of the popliteal aery. Loss of plantar flexion is due to necrosis of the posterior muscles of the leg which are supplied by the posterior tibial and peroneal aeries. Trendelenburg's sign is caused by weakness or paralysis of the gluteus medius and minimus muscles.",
