Moore 5th ed. /619-621* Trendelenburg's sign is found in people with weak or paralyzed abductor muscles of the hip, namely gluteus medius and gluteus minimus.* Superior gluteal nerve, if injured, paralyses the 3 muscles: gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and tensor fascia latae and hence lead to positive Trendelenberg test.* These 3 muscles, especially the gluteus medius raises the unsupported hip during walking, which otherwise will be pulled down by the gravity.* In Trendelenberg test this action of gluteus medius (superior pelvic tilt of contralateral hip) is absent and we actually observe that there is a downward drop of the unsupported hip- due to unopposed action of gravity.* This leads to Lurching gait in the patient.

It depends on the following: Normal functioning of gluteus medius and minimus. Head of femur must be located normally within the acetabulum. Neck of femur must be intact with a normal neck-shaft angle (adults -1250, children - 1400)o Positive Trendelenburg's sign - the pelvis sags downward on unsupported side svhen a person is standing on one leg if any of these factors is defective. Person show's dipping or lurching or Trendelenburg gait. Unilateral congenital dislocation of hip - lurching gait. Bilateral congenital dislocation of hip -wadding gait. o Normally, when the body weight is supported on one limb, gluteus medius and minimus of the supported side raise the opposite and unsupported side of pelvis. Thus, the test is positive in paralysis of gluteus medius and minimus, which are supplied by superior gluteal nerve.",
