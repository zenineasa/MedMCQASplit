Signs and symptoms frequently mimic appendicitis or peptic ulcer. Internal hemorrhoids are thrombosed tributaries of the middle rectal vein, which can prolapse into the anal canal. External hemorrhoids are thrombosing in the veins of the external rectal venous plexus. Diverticulosis is ordinarily an outpouching of the wall of the large intestine.

The pudendal nerve is a nerve in the pelvic region that innervates the external genitalia of both sexes, as well as sphincters for the bladder and the rectum. c. The pudendal nerve originates in the sacral plexus; it derives its fibers from the ventral branches of the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves (S2, S3, S4 ), d. It passes between the piriformis and coccygeus muscles and leaves the pelvis through the lower part of the greater sciatic foramen. e. It crosses the spine of the ischium, and reenters the pelvis through the lesser sciatic foramen. f. It accompanies the internal pudendal vessels upward and forward along the lateral wall of the ischiorectal fossa, being contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia termed the pudendal canal. g. The pudendal nerve gives off the inferior anal nerves. It soon divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve, and the dorsal nerve of the penis (males) or the dorsal nerve of the clitoris (in females). h.

        "exp": "The inability to pass meconium denotes an obstruction of the fetal bowel. Midgut volvulus results in the twisting of the intestines and ultimately obstruction of the small and/or large intestines. Gastroschisis results from an incomplete closure of the lateral folds during the fourth week of development from a defect in the medial plane of the abdominal wall. This results in an epigastric hernia, with viscera that protrude into the amniotic cavity and are covered by amniotic fluid. Failure of recanalization of the ileum is seen with 50% of obstructive lesions of the intestine. This obstruction is caused by stenosis or atresia of the intestines. A remnant of the omphaloenteric duct generally presents as an ileal (Meckel) diverticulum in the proximal portion of the omphaloenteric duct. It normally arises as a fingerlike pouch about 3 to 6 cm long from the antimesenteric border of the ileum and 40 to 50 cm from the ileocecal junction. Nonrotation of the midgut results in the lower portion of the loop returning to the abdomen first, the small intestine sitting on the right side of the abdomen, and the large intestine lying entirely on the left.

One week following emergent surgery the patient was released from the hospital. Two months postoperatively the patient complained of abdominal pain. A CT scan examination demonstrated an internal hernia in which the hepatic flexure of the colon had herniated through the epiploic (omental) foramen (of Winslow). Gastrointestinal veins appeared to be markedly dilated, including the veins forming anastomoses between the portal and caval systems (veins of Retzius). Which of the following structures is most likely compressed?",
        "exp": "The portal vein is compressed in its passage through the hepatoduodenal ligament, the anterior border of the omental (epiploic) foramen (of Winslow). The veins of Retzius are located along the sides of the abdominal walls and communicate between tributaries of retroperitoneal parts of the gastrointestinal tract and veins of the body wall. In portal hypertension the portal blood cannot pass freely through the liver, and the portal-caval tributaries and their anastomoses become dilated. The inferior epigastric veins anastomose with the paraumbilical veins, which is the first branch off the hepatic portal vein. These would be the first affected in portal hypertension. The inferior vena cava is the main route of blood return to the right atrium and is posterior to the omental (epiploic) foramen (of Winslow); it would not likely be compressed due to herniation through the foramen. Compression of the proper hepatic artery in the hepatoduodenal ligament would not result in dilation of veins of Retzius but could conceivably diminish blood supply to the gallbladder and liver. Common bile duct compression would result in jaundice and increased serum bilirubin. The cystic duct joins with the hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.

The most direct route to the rectouterine pouch is through the vaginal wall at the posterior vaginal fornix. It is unlikely that the pregnancy would have occurred in the vesicouterine space because the transfer of ova from the ovary to the fimbriae occurs on the posterior side of the broad ligament. Therefore, it would not be advisable to attempt initially to insert a needle into the vesicouterine space. Inserting a needle through the anterior fornix into the endocervical canal would lead one into the uterine cavity, with the probability of other undesirable consequences.

The cystic duct allows bile to enter the gallbladder from the common bile duct (draining the liver) and releases bile to the common bile duct.
