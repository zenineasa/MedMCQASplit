On examination, he has weakness in rotating his arm laterally because of an injury of a nerve. Which of the following conditions is most likely to cause a loss of this nerve function?",
        "exp": "Inferior dislocation of the head of the humerus may damage the axillary nerve, which arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, runs through the quadrangular space accompanied by the posterior humeral circumflex vessels around the surgical neck of the humerus, and supplies the deltoid and teres minor, which are lateral rotators of the arm. Injury to the lateral cord of the brachial plexus-branches of lateral cord are -musculocutaneous and lateral root of median nerve injury to these nerves doesn't affect lateral rotation. supracondylar fracture humerus -m/c nerve injured is anterior interocious nerve Knife wound on the teres major muscle- teres major is a medial rotator of shoulder",

Subscapularis bursa communicates directly with the joint capsule the gaps between the glenohumeral ligaments. These ligaments reinforce the anterior poion of the joint capsule. d. Subacromial bursa lies beneath the coracoacromial ligament, and its lower layer is attached to the tendon of the supraspinatus.
