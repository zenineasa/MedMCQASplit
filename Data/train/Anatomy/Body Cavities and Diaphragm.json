Paraxial mesoderm:# It is organized into somites which in turn gives rise toi) Sclerotomes: Form axial skeleton including vertebrae, ribs and parts of neurocranium. ii) Myotomes: Form all voluntary (skeletal) muscles of head, trunk and limbs. iii) Dermatomes: Form dermis of skin, especially over dorsal regions. 2. Intermediate mesoderm:# It gives rise to major portion of urogeninal systemi) Urinary organs: Kidney, ureters, trigone of bladder, posterior wall female urethra, posterior wall of upper half of prostatic part of male urethra, inner glandular zone of prostate. ii) Reproductive organs: Gonads (testis and ovary), epididymis, ducts deferens, seminal vesicle, ejaculatory duct, uterus, uterine tube and upper part of vagina. 3.
