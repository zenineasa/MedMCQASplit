Proprioception is carried to spinal cord by A-a sensory neuron while other sensations (fine touch, kinesthesia) are carried by Ab (Type II) sensory neuron. o In the spinal cord, these fibers ascend as fasciculus gracilis (fibers from lower part of body) and fasciculus cuneatus (fibers from upper part of body). Together, two fasciculi are called the Dorsal column of spinal cord, and they terminate respectively on the nucleus gracilis and the nucleus cuneatus in the medulla (Dorsal column nuclei). o The secondary sensory neurons originating from dorsal column nuclei of medulla cross over to opposite as internalarcute fibers and continue as the medial leminscus towards the thalamus (ventroposterior nucleus of thalamus). The thalamic neurons project to the sensory cortex.",
