        "exp": "pt. is suspected to have Ca Prostate as Prostatic Ca is the most common malignant tumor in men over 65 yrs. of age. Symptoms of Bladder outlet obstruction and back pains (due to bony metastasis in the pelvis & lumbar veebra) indicate towards prostate Ca. Serum acid phosphates is a tumor marker of prostate Ca. But now serum acid phosphates assay has been superseded by PSA assay (Prostate specific antigen). Prostate-specific antigen It is a glycoprotein produced only in the prostatic cells (both benign & malignant). It facilitates liquefaction of semen. It is neither sensitive nor specific for early prostate carcinoma (it is prostate specific and not prostate cancer specific), neveheless it gives some help in making a diagnosis. Normal serum level - less than 4 mg/ml 4 - 10 mg/ml - this range is common for both BHP and Ca. More than 10 mg/ml - approx 75% will have cancer. Since PSA is not specific for Ca, PSA Velocity & PSA density is used to detect Prostate cancer. PSA velocity is the rate of change in PSA levels over time and is expressed most commonly as the PSA doubling time. For men with a PSA above 4, PSA velocity of more than .75 mg/ml year is suggestive of Ca. While for those with lower PSA levels, rates above 0.5 mg/ml, per year should be used to advise biopsy. PSA density is calculated by dividing the serum PSA by the estimated prostate weight (measured by TRUS). It was developed to correct for the contribution of BPH to the total PSA level. Values < 0.10 are consistent with BPH. > 0.15 suggest cancer Ref : Bailey & Love 25/e p1356",

The bad point about a blocker is that their effect lasts only till drug is given and even with continued therapy, benefits may decline after several years due to disease progression. About Combination therapy Combination of both these class of drugs is used by surgeons to derive combined benefit from both; its use is not justified in this patient as he needs to allete his symptoms till he gets operated - the definitive & most effective t/t.

        "question": "Which of the following is the most common cause of delayed UT obstructive symptom after TURP",
        "exp": "Transurethral prostate surgery TURP remains the most commonly performed procedure for the surgical correction of BOO. Strips of tissue are cut from the bladder neck down to the level of the verumontanum. Cutting is performed by a high-frequency diathermy current, which is applied across a loop mounted on the hand-held trigger of the resectoscope. Coagulation of bleeding points can be accurately achieved. The 'chips' of prostate are then removed from the bladder using an Ellik evacuator. Resection proceeds at 1g/minute in experienced hands. The duration of resection for monopolar TURP is limited to 1 hour due to the risk of resorption of water if 1% glycine is used as an irrigant. The advent of bipolar TURP where normal saline is used as an irri- gant permits resection of larger prostates. Following TURP, careful haemostasis is performed, and a three-way, self-re- taining catheter irrigated with isotonic saline is introduced into the bladder to prevent any fuher bleeding from form- ing blood clots. Irrigation is continued until the outflow is pale pink, and the catheter is usually removed on the sec- ond or third postoperative day. In men with small prostates or bladder neck dyssynergia or stenosis, it is better to divide the bladder neck and prostatic urethra with a collings knife. Laser can be used to evaporate (e.g. Green light laser) or enucleate the prostate (e.g. HOLEP). The advantage of green light laser is that vaporisation is haemostatic and this procedure can be performed even while patients are antico- agulated. HOLEP involves the use of a laser to coagulate any of the small vessels crossing the relatively avascular plane between the peripheral and transitional zones of the prostate while the tip of the cystoscope is used, much like the surgeons finger at Millin's prostatectomy, to enucleate the transition zone adenoma. The enucleated adenoma is pushed into the bladder, where it is morcellated and extracted the cysto- scope. Damage to the external sphincter is avoided provided one uses the verumontanum as a guide to the most distal point of the resection/vaporisation/enucleation.",

Vas deferens carries the sperms from epididymis to the urethra where they open by separate openings into the prostatic urethra. Just before opening each vas deferens is joined by ducts of seminal vesicles. Vas deferens and seminal vesicle ducts join to form the ejaculatory duct. The secretions of seminal vesicles form a large pa of seminal fluid and contain fructose and a coagulating enzyme called the vesiculase. Now coming to the question. Semen analysis forms an impoant pa of infeility assessment. Low ejaculatory volume is caused by retrograde ejaculation into the bladder or obstruction of the vas deferens or the ejaculatory duct Azoospermia may be seen in testicular failure or obstruction of vas deferens Absence of fructose suggests seminal vesicles agenesis or obstruction. A semen that is low in volume with azoospermia and absence of fructose suggests - either obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts or congenital absence of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles. The anatomy of the vas deferens & seminal vesicles can be investigated by vasography (where contrast medium is injected into the vas deferens) or TRUS (Trans rectal ultrasonography), however TRUS is superior to vasography and is the investigation of choice.

Campbell's Urology writes- \"In summary, for patients harboring nonstaghorn stones smaller than 10 mm, SWL is usually the primary approach. For patients with stones between 10 and 20 mm, SWL can still be considered a first-line treatment unless factors of stone composition, location, or renal anatomy suggest that a more optimal outcome may be achieved with a more invasive treatment modality (PNL or ureteroscopy). Patients with stones larger than 20 mm should primarily be treated by PNL unless specific indications for ureteroscopy are present (e.g., bleeding diathesis, obesity).\" Spontaneous passage of stones -- Most stones <5 mm in diameter pass spontaneously. For stones larger than 5 nun in diameter, there is a progressive decrease in the spontaneous passage rate, which is unlikely with stones >10 mm in diameter. The choice of intervention for stones that are unlikely to pass spontaneously varies with the location and size of the stone. Three minimally invasive surgical techniques currently available are: Shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) Rigid and flexible ureteroscopy (URS) Also know Steinstrasse literally means 'stone street' it is condition which follows the use of ESWL. small pieces of fragmented calculi collect and obstruct in the distal ureter, like sand occluding a straw Ref - Bailey and love 27e Kidney , Internet",

Surgery should also be recommended for patients with upper tract dilation, renal insufficiency secondary to BPH, or bladder stones.\"- Schwaz 8/e p1530 About other options: Prostate Size: Treatment of BPH is primarily dictated by patient's symptoms and not by the prostate size. However the size of prostate can decide whether to go for endoscopic method of treatment or open surgical procedure. Open surgery is more effective than endoscopic methods for prostates weighing >100gm UTI: Recurrent episodes of UTI (and not a single episode) are an absolute indication for surgery of prostate. Hypeension: Alpha blockers which are first line medical therapy for BPH lower the blood pressure and thus are helpful in hypeensive persons. Management of BPH Management is primarily directed by symptoms. Mild symptoms can be managed with watchful waiting. More severe symptomatic patients are treated with medicines (alpha blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors or combination of both). Surgery is recommended if the patient is having problems despite medical therapy. Absolute indications for surgery as listed in Smith's Urology is given below. Absolute indications for surgical treatment of BPH Refractory urine retention (failing at least one attempt at catheter removal) Recurrent UTI from BPH Bladder stones d/t BPH Renal insufficiency d/t BPH Large bladder diveicula secondary to BPH Recurrent gross hematuria from BPH Upper tract dilatation is an indication for surgery according to Schwaz. Medical therapy Alpha-blockers (terazosin, doxazosin, and tamsulosin) Alpha-blockers help is reducing the symptoms of BPH by blocking the alpha 1 adrenoreceptors present in human prostate and bladder base. 5-Alpha-reductase inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride) - 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. This thus results in reduction in the size of the gland and improvement in symptoms (after several months of use). Surgery Surgery for BPH is most commonly performed endoscopically; however, if the prostate gland is quite large (approx >100 g), an open prostatectomy should be performed. The standard endoscopic procedure for BPH is a transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate. Conventional surgical methods: Transurethral resection of the prostate (most commonly used method) Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) Open simple prostatectomy (simple suprapubic prostatectomy, simple retropubic prostatectomy) - When the prostate is too large to be removed endoscopically, an open enucleation is necessary. What constitutes \"too large\" is subjective and varies depending upon the surgeon's experience with TURP. Glands >100 g are usually considered for open enucleation. Open prostatectomy may also be initiated when concomitant bladder diveiculum or a bladder stone is present or if dorsal lithotomy positioning is not possible. Open prostatectomies can be done with either a suprapubic or retropubic approach. A simple suprapubic prostatectomy is performed transvesically and is the operation of choice in dealing with concomitant bladder pathology. Minimally invasive methods: Laser therapy (Nd:YAG and holmium:YAG ) Transurethral electro vaporization of the prostate Microwave Hypehermia Transurethral needle ablation of the prostate- High-intensity focused ultrasound for thermal tissue ablation Intraurethral stents--stents are endoscopically placed in the prostatic fossa and are designed to keep the prostatic urethra patent. They are usually covered by urothelium within 4-6 months after inseion.

Saline cannot be used because electrolytes in the irrigation fluid will dissipate the electric current used to resect the prostate.\" -- Schwaz 8/e p1530 During transurethral resection of, prostate strips of tissue are cut from the bladder neck down to the level of verumontanum. This cutting is performed by a loop mounted on the handheld trigger of the resectoscope in which Diathermy current is being passed. We all know that normal saline is a very good conductor of electricity (as it contains ions -- Na+ & Cl- ions). So if it is used while performing TURP, the diathermy current used in the procedure will cause electrolyte disassociation of normal saline and the current will not be localized in the loop and hence cutting of the tissue will not be proper. You can put up a question that the same can occur with the use of distilled water too. Distilled water can also conduct electricity-but the current used during TURF is not very strong and distilled water is not an as good conductor of electricity as Normal saline. (You must be aware that distilled water is a worse conductor of electricity than normal water.) There were also arguments that distilled water causes fluid overload and therefore should not be used in TURF True, distilled water causes fluid overload or TURP syndrome but this complication is not common Distilled water is being replaced by 1.5% glycine but still can be used for TURP (and is used in many centres when glycine is not available) Ref : Love & Bailey 25/e p1350, 1351",

The two most predominant histological patterns of the prostate cancer are assigned a Gleason grade ranging from 15. Primary grade is assigned to the pattern of cancer that is most commonly observed in the histological slides of the specimen. Secondary grade is assigned to the second most commonly observed pattern in the specimen. Gleason score is the sum of the two grades. Thus it is also known as Gleason sum. If the entire specimen has only one pattern present, then both the primary and sencondary grades are repoed as the same grade. As Gleason grades range from 1 to 5, Gleason score thus range from 2 to 10. The Gleason score is used to help evaluate the prognosis of men with prostate cancer. Together with other parameters, the Gleason score is incorporated into a strategy of prostate cancer staging which predicts prognosis and helps guide therapy. A point of impoance is that the primary Gleason grade is most impoant with respect to placing patients in prognostic groups. For example in patients with a Gleason score 7, a Gleason 4+3 is a more aggressive cancer than a Gleason 3+4. Ref : Smith's Urology 17/e p357",
