When meconium enters the peritoneal cavity, an exudate is secreted that organizes rapidly, matting of intestinal loops occur, and in many cases in a matter of weeks, the extruded becomes calcified. Meconium remains sterile until about 3 hrs after bih; thereafter, unless the perforation has become sealed, sterile meconium peritonitis gives place to acute bacterial peritonitis which unless treated promptly is rapidly fatal. The clinical picture may be that of peritonitis and/or intestinal obstruction. Meconium peritonitis should always be suspected when a baby is born with a tense abdomen, who is vomiting and in whom there is a failure to discharge meconium.

Pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) The primary event in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a movement of gastric juice from the stomach into the oesophagus. The three dominant pathophysiologic mechanisms causing gastroesophageal junction incompetence are: Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (t. LESRs) A hypotensive lower oesophagal sphincter (LES) Anatomic disruption of the gastroesophageal junction, often associated with a hiatal hernia The latest concept is that the dominant mechanism varies as a function of disease severity with t.

Couinaud, a French surgeon, described the liver as being divided into eight segments. Each of these segments can be considered as a functional unit, with a branch of the hepatic aery, poal vein and bile duct, and drained by a branch of the hepatic vein. It is the concept of these segments as distinct functional units that guides 'anatomical' liver resection. The overall anatomy of the liver is divided into a functional right and left 'unit'along the line between the gallbladder fossa and the middle hepatic vein (Cantlie's line). Liver segments (V-VIII) to the right of this line are supplied by the right hepatic aery and the right branch of the poal vein, and drain bile the right hepatic duct. To the left of this line (segments I-IV), functionally, is the left liver, which is supplied by the left branch of the hepatic aery and the left poal vein branch, and drains bile the left hepatic duct.

Indications of Surgical intervention: (Ref: Bailey and Love 25/e 1145; CSDT 13/e p583; Harrison 17/e p) Age of cyst more than 12 weeks without resolution Size of cyst greater than 6 cm. Symptomatic Development of complications (eg. haemorrhage, perforation, g. i. obstruction) But note that these indications for intervention are just a generalization used for teaching the undergraduates. These are not specific indications for interventions. Therapeutic interventions are advised (irrespective of size and duration) when the pseudocyst is symptomatic or increasing is size on follow up studies, or any complication (rupture, hemorrhage, or abscess) arise or there is suspicion of malignancy. Thus expectant management is adequate (irrespective of size) if the patient is asymptomatic and serial u/s studies show that the cyst is resolving. Surgical methods Internal Drainage -- most preferred surgical management in uncomplicated pseudocyst is internal drainage. The three options are Cystojejunostomy Cystogastrostomy Cystoduodenostomy Internal drainage can be done either open surgical or laparoscopic or by percutaneous catheter-based methods (transgastric puncture and stent placement to create a cystogastrostomy) Excision of Pseudocyst - is hardly done and is usually limited to pseudocyst involving the tail of the pancreas. External drainage - is done in:- infected pseudocyst for immature pseudocyst with thin nonfibrous walls that do not allow safe internal drainage. in an unstable pt. in whom more complex surgical intervention is precluded. Transpapillary pancreatic duct stent: Because pseudocysts often communicate with the pancreatic ductal system, two newer approaches to pseudocyst management are based on main duct drainage, rather than pseudocyst drainage per se. A stent is passed into the pseudocyst through the papilla of Vater. this drainage, paicularly when incomplete, can allow bacteria to enter the pseudocyst and lead to the development of an infected pseudocyst. Another transpapillary approach involves placing a stent across the duct defect rather than into the cyst through the defect. By excluding pancreatic juice from the pseudocyst, this bridging intraductal stent may permit the duct disruption to heal and the pseudocyst to resolve without drainage (analogous to the use of common bile duct stents in the setting of a cystic duct leak).

Other common constituents are calcium carbonate, palmitate phosphate, bilirubin and other bile pigments (calcium bilirubinate, calcium palmitate and calcium stearate). Because of their calcium content, they are often radiographically visible. They typically arise secondary to infection of the biliary tract which results in the release of b-glucuronidase (by injured hepatocytes and bacteria) which hydrolyzes bilirubin glucuronides and increases the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in bile. Between 4% and 20% of stones are mixed. Gallstones can vary in size and shape from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball. The gallbladder may contain a single large stone or many smaller ones.

The incidence of Barrett esophagus is rising, and it is estimated to occur in as many as 10% of individuals with symptomatic GERD. Barrett esophagus is most common in white males and typically presents between 40 and 60 years of age. The greatest concern in Barrett esophagus is that it confers an increased risk of esoph- ageal adenocarcinoma. Genomic sequencing of biopsies involved by Barrett esophagus has revealed the presence of mutations that are shared with esophageal adenocarci- noma, in keeping with the idea that Barrett esophagus is a precursor lesion to cancer. Potentially oncogenic mutations are more numerous when biopsies demonstrate dysplasia, which is detected in 0. 2% to 2% of persons with Barrett esophagus each year. The presence of dysplasia, a prein- vasive change, is associated with prolonged symptoms, longer segment length, increased patient age, and Caucasian race. Although the vast majority of esophageal adenocar- cinomas are associated with Barrett esophagus, it is impor- tant to remember that most individuals with Barrett esophagus do not develop esophageal tumors.",

The clinical symptoms are because of the effects of hypoglycaemia (sweating, tremor, palpitations, confusion, headache, disorientation, visual difficulties, irrational behaviour, or even coma) The diagnosis of insulinoma requires the demonstration of an elevated plasma insulin level at the time of hypoglycemia. This is because insulinomas do not reduce the secretion of insulin in the presence of hypoglycaemia. Whereas in a normal person, insulin levels would decrease with a decrease in blood glucose levels. The most reliable test to diagnose insulinoma is a fast up to 72 h with serum glucose, and insulin measurements every 4-8 h. The test is terminated if the patient becomes symptomatic or glucose levels are <40 mg/dL (2. 2 mmol/L). Diagnosis of insulinoma is made if: A serum insulin level of 6 microunit/mL or more in the presence of blood glucose values below 40 mg/dL the ratio of plasma insulin to glucose is > 0. 3 In addition to the above criteria, some other measurements are also required before making the diagnosis of insulinoma C-peptide level serum proinsulin level, serum sulfonylurea levels These additional tests are used because any hidden use of insulin or oral hypoglycemics taken by the patient would resemble insulinoma causing high levels of insulin in presence of hypoglycaemia. The combination of elevated proinsulin levels (normal in exogenous insulin/hypoglycemic agent users), elevated C-peptide levels (low in exogenous insulin users), antibodies to insulin (positive in exogenous insulin users), and measurement of sulfonylurea levels in serum or plasma will allow the correct diagnosis to be made.

        "exp": "Perforation is the most common major complication after either diagnostic or therapeutic colonoscopy. Management Management of colonoscopic perforation depends upon the size of the perforation, the duration of time since the injury, and the overall condition of the patient A large perforation recognized during the procedure requires surgical exploration. Because the bowel has almost always been prepared prior to the colonoscopy, there is usually little contamination associated with these injuries and most can be repaired primarily. If there is significant contamination, if there has been a delay in diagnosis with resulting peritonitis, or if the patient is hemodynamically unstable, proximal diversion with or without resection is the safest approach. Occasionally, a patient will develop abdominal pain and localized signs of perforation after what was thought to be an uneventful colonoscopy. Many of these patients will have a \"microperforation\" which will resolve with bowel rest, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and close observation. Evidence of peritonitis or any deterioration in clinical condition mandates exploration. Similarly, free retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal air may be discovered incidentally after colonoscopy. In a completely asymptomatic patient, this finding is thought to result from barotrauma and dissection of air through tissue planes without a free perforation. Many of these patients can be successfully treated with bowel rest & broad-spectrum antibiotics. Surgical exploration is indicated for any clinical deterioration. Ref: Schwaz 9/e p1069",

Here in this question, it's not mentioned whether the recurrence is after an acid-reducing operation or simply after medications. Lets first take the case of recurrence after a previous acid reducing surgery (this is most probably what the examiner means by recurrent ulcer as this topic is described in quite a detail in Maingot's) Recurrence after a prior acid reducing surgery: The management of patients with recurrent ulcer disease after acid-reducing operations consists of antibiotics directed at H. pylori + treatment with an antisecretory medication + limitation of NSAID use, smoking cessation, and limitation of alcohol intake. Ulcer disease refractory to such treatment is unusual. If the ulcer persists for more than 3 months despite eradication of H. pylori and maintenance antisecretory therapy or the ulcer is associated with perforation, bleeding, or obstruction, the operation is indicated. The choice of operation for recurrent postoperative ulcer depends on the indication for initial operation & the operation performed previously. Since these ulcers have recurred despite prior peptic ulcer disease surgery and maximal medical therapy, surgery should be appropriately aggressive. Truncal vagotomy with antrectomy is the operation of choice. This is the procedure with the least recurrence rate. Recurrence after prior treatment by medications: If at all surgery is needed an operation with least morbidity is advised i. e. Highly selective vagotomy. Recurrent gastric ulcer: Non-healing gastric ulcers despite antibiotics and antisecretory drugs should be viewed with suspicion for malignancy (Duodenal ulcers have no risk of malignancy) and thus distal gastrectomy is the recommended operation. Other surgical options are wedge resection with HSV. (Note HSV is of no use in Type I and Type IV ulcers as these are associated with acid hyposecretion) Ref - Internet",

Retroperitoneal fibrosis - It is a nonspecific, nonsuppurative inflammation of fibro-adipose tissue of unknown cause that produces symptoms by the gradual compression of tubular structures in retroperitoneal space. Aetiology of retroperitoneal fibrosis - About 2/3rd cases are primary idiopathic, are also known as Ormond's disease Secondary Retroperitoneal fibrosis a variety of inflammatory conditions - chronic pancreatitis, histoplasmosis, tuberculosis, or actinomycosis. drugs methysergide (most imp.) b blockers hydralazine a methyldopa Etacapone (used in the t/t of Parkinson's ds.) - malignancies (prostate, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, sarcoma, characinoid & gastric cancer). antoimmune disorders (ankylosing spondylitis, SLE PAN etc.) Symptoms of retroperitoneal fibrosis - It is more common in men between 40-60 yrs of age Early symptoms are nonspecific and vague. These are Pain - Dull noncolicky and insidious in onset. Anorexia, nausea General malaise, diarrhea Later on, symptoms result from compression of tubular retroperitoneal structures. The major structure involved are- Ureter - Most commonly involved Aoa Inferior venacava Symptoms due to the involvement of ureter (usually b/1 involvement) Dysuria Frequency of urination Chills and fever occur with secondary infection of a hydronephrotic kidney. Hematuria can occur. Diagnosis The diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis usually can be made accurately by intravenous pyelography if uremia is not present. The characteristic finding on pyelogram are Hydronephrosis with a dilated touous upper ureter. Medial detion of the ureter Extrinsic ureteral compression Note: In a retroperitoneal tumor, ureter is laterally deted while in retroperitoneal fibrosis ureter medially detes. Currently, the imaging procedure of choice is the CT scan. But if renal function is compromised contrast agents are not given and then MRI is the procedure of choice. T/T of Retroperitoneal fibrosis Coicosteroids, with or without surgery, are the mainstay of medical therapy. Surgical treatment is required in patients who present with moderate or massive hydronephrosis. It consists primarily of ureterolysis (freeing the ureter from adhesions and surrounding tissue) or ureteral stenting.. Also, know Paial or complete ureteral obstruction occurs in 75 to 85% of patients. Most common site of urethral obstruction is lower third of the ureter. Ref: Love & Bailey 25/e p1007",

The cancer may spread from the stomach to other pas of the body, paicularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomenand lymph nodes The most common cause is infection by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which accounts for more than 60% of cases. Ceain types of H. pylorihave greater risks than others. Smoking, dietary factors such as pickled vegetablesand obesity are other risk factors. About 10% of cases run in families, and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited from a person's parents such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas. This type can be divided into a number of subtypes. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach.

        "exp": "Wandering Spleen Wandering spleen is a rare finding seen in children and in women between the ages of 20 and 40 years. One of two causes is suspected. The first is theorized to result from a failure to formnormal splenic peritoneal attachments that suspend the organ securely within its usual anatomic position. Failure to form these attachments is thought to arise from lack of fusion of the dorsal mesogastrium to the posterior abdominal wall during embryogenesis. The second theory surmises that in multiparous women, hormonal changes and abdominal laxity lead to an acquired defect in splenic attachments. In either case, without these attachments, the splenic pedicle is unusually long and prone to torsion. Intermittent abdominal pain, splenomegaly resulting from venous congestion, and severe persistent pain are suggestive of wandering spleen and tension or intermittent torsion of the splenic pedicle. A mobile mass may be palpable on physical examination. CT of the abdomen with intravenous administration of contrast material provides confirmation of the diagnosis, with the spleen located outside its usual position. A noncontrasted spleen or whorled appearance of the vascular pedicle provides additional evidence for the condition and may be helpful in choosing splenopexy or splenectomy Ref: Sabiston 20th edition Pgno: 1564",

The incidence of Barrett esophagus is rising, and it is estimated to occur in as many as 10% of individuals with symptomatic GERD. Barrett esophagus is most common in white males and typically presents between 40 and 60 years of age. The greatest concern in Barrett esophagus is that it confers an increased risk of esoph- ageal adenocarcinoma. Genomic sequencing of biopsies involved by Barrett esophagus has revealed the presence of mutations that are shared with esophageal adenocarci- noma, in keeping with the idea that Barrett esophagus is a precursor lesion to cancer. Potentially oncogenic mutations are more numerous when biopsies demonstrate dysplasia, which is detected in 0. 2% to 2% of persons with Barrett esophagus each year. The presence of dysplasia, a prein- vasive change, is associated with prolonged symptoms, longer segment length, increased patient age, and Caucasian race. Although the vast majority of esophageal adenocar- cinomas are associated with Barrett esophagus, it is impor- tant to remember that most individuals with Barrett esophagus do not develop esophageal tumors.",

Bleeding may be the initial presenting symptoms in up to 10 percent of pts with peptic ulcer. Duodenal ulcer bleeding is four times more common than gastric ulcer bleeding. Esophageal varices: Bleeding esophageal varices or gastric varices in the presence of liver disease account for about 10-20% of massive upper GI bleeding. In this pt. esophageal varices appears to be the cause as the pt. is a chronic alcoholic But here the amount he drinks daily should be taken into consideration. In men 40 - 80 g/day of ethanol - produces fatty liver 80 - 160 g/day of ethanol for 10 - 20 yrs - causes hepatitis or cirrhosis (Women exhibit increased susceptibility* to alcoholic liver disease at quantities > 20 g/day) He drinks 100 ml daily. Different types of drinks contain varying amounts of alcohol. What this pt. drinks is not known but even strong drinks such as 86-proof beverage contain 80 gm of ethanol in 250 ml of drinks (Wine contain 80 gm of ethanol in 1000 ml of drinks) Thus this patient is unlikely to have an alcoholic liver disease and so esophageal varies can be ruled out. Moreover even in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, avarices are cause of massive GI bleed in only 1/2 the cases. Peptic ulcer or gastritis form rest of the half. Mallory-Weiss tear It accounts for a small percentage (5 to 10%) It presents in a classic pattern - initially vomiting is without blood, but after retching and vomiting with epigastric pain, bleeding and haematemesis begin. Gastritis Acute gastritis can present as massive bleeding (though rarely) It is most commonly associated with intake of NSAIDS, alcohol, coicosteroids and oral potassium supplements.

Moreover there can be cases of acute pancreatitis with normal serum amylase levels. Serum amylase level usually return to normal after 48 to 72 hrs of acute episode, fuher limiting its usefulness. Serum Lipase is now the single best enzyme to measure for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Its level remains elevated for much longer duration of time (7 to 14 days) Other specific serum markers for acute pancreatitis are: - pancreatic isoamylase - trypsinogen One more fact about serum amylase is woh mentioning There is no significant correlation between the magnitude of serum amylase elevation and severity of pancreatitis, in fact, a milder form of acute pancreatitis is often associated with higher levels of serum amylase as compared with that in a more severe fonn of the disease. Surgical treatment is needed rarely in acute pancreatitis. The disease is self-limited in --85% to 90% of patients and subsides within 3-7 days. Surgical management is needed in cases of necrotic pancreatitis, pancreatic abscess and intervention in gall stone pancreatitis.
