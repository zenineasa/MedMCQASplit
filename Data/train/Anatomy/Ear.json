Epitympamim (attic) It is the part of tympanic cavity which extends above the tympanic membrane (pars tensa) and lies opposite (medial) to shrapnel's membrane (pars flacida) and bony lateral attic wall. It is the widest part of tympanic cavity (transverse dimension is 6 mm). Epitympanum (attic) communicates with mastoid air cell system, through a small opening called aditus. Prussak's space communicates with epitympanum through a posterior gap. Attic area (epitympanum) is a crowded place and only a thin plat of bone (tegmen) separates this region from middle cranial fossa. Any infection in this area is prone to affect the temporal lobe of brain through erosion of this plate.
