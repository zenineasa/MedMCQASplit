        "exp": "The superior mesenteric aery, a direct branch of the aoa, supplies blood to the ascending and transverse colons, which is marked as D. B. - The inferior vena cava, which receives blood from the liver, kidneys, and other abdominal structures, enters the thorax through the vena caval foramen to empty into the right atrium. A. -The gallbladder receives bile, concentrates it by absorbing water and salt, and stores it. E. -The left renal vein runs anterior to the aoa but posterior to the superior mesenteric aery and receives blood from the gonad and suprarenal gland.",
