        "question": "A 17-year-old boy with a stab wound received multiple injuries on the upper pa of the arm and required surgery. If the brachial aery were ligated at its origin, which of the following aeries would supply blood to the profunda brachii aery?",
        "exp": "The posterior humeral circumflex aery anastomoses with an ascending branch of the profunda brachii aery, whereas the lateral thoracic and subscapular aeries do not. The superior ulnar collateral and radial recurrent aeries arise inferior to the origin of the profunda brachii aery.",

        "question": "A patient complains of having pain with repeated movements of his thumb (claudication). His physician performs the Allen test and finds an insufficiency of the radial aery. Which of the following conditions would be a result of the radial aery stenosis?,",
        "exp": "The Radial aery divides into the Princeps pollicis aery and the deep palmar aerial arch. Thus, stenosis of the radial aery results in a decreased blood flow in the princeps pollicis aery. Superficial palmar aerial arch is formed primarily by the ulnar aery, which passes superficial to the flexor retinaculum. Extensor compament of the forearm receives blood from the posterior interosseous aery, which arises from the common interosseous branch of the ulnar aery.",
