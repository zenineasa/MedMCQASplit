The sheath is divided into three compaments by septa- Lateral compament - femoral aery and femoral branch of genitofemoral nerve Intermediate compament- femoral vein Medial compament - Also known as Femoral canal - Contains lymph node of Cloquet Femoral hernia - The femoral canal is an area of potential weakness in the abdominal wall through which abdominal contents may bulge out forming a femoral hernia.
