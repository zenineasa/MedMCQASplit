Each ovary lies in the ovarian fossa on the lateral pelvic wall which is bound anteriorly by obliterated u mb lie a I artery and posteriorly by ureter and internal iliac artery. Each ovary has two poles (upper and lower), two borders (anterior and posterior) and two surfaces (medial and lateral). Upper pole (tubal end) is related to ovarian fimbria of fallopian tube and external iliac artery. Suspensory ligament of ovary (infundibulopelvic ligament) connents it with pelvic brim. Lower pole (uterine end) is connected with lateral angle of uterus by ligament of the ovary, just posteroinferior to the attachment of fallopian tube. Lateral surface is related to ovarian fossa and is covered with peritoneum which separates it from Obturator vessels and nerve. Medial surface is related to fallopian tube and is separated by a peritoneal recess, called ovarian bursa. Anterior border (mesovarian border) is straight and related to fallopian tube and obliterated umblical artery. It is attached to posterior surface of broad ligament of uterus by mesovarium and forms the hilus of ovary. Posterior border (free border) is convex and is related to fallopian tube and ureter.",

Shortly after the solid tip of the paramesonephric ducts reaches the urogenital sinus, two solid evagination grow out from the pelvic part of the sinus. b. These evagination, the sinovaginal bulbs, proliferate and form a solid vaginal plate. Proliferation continues at the cranial end of the plate, increasing the distance between the uterus and the urogenital sinus. By the fifth month, the vaginal outgrowth is entirely canalized. c. The wing-like expansions of the vagina around the end of the uterus, the vaginal Fornices, are of paramesonephric origin, the vagina has a dual origin, with the upper portion derived from the uterine canal and the lower portion derived from the urogenital sinus. d. The epidermis of vagina develops exclusively from the urogenital sinus. The lumen of the vagina remains separated from that of the urogenital sinus by a thin tissue plate, the hymen, which consists of the epithelial lining of the sinus and a thin layer of vaginal cells. It usually develops a small opening during perinatal life",

Its function is to prevent retrograde ejaculation of semen into the bladder during the time of ejaculation. In males the detrusor muscle fibers of the bladder at the region of bladder neck and proximal urethra are organized into internal urethral sphincter which is under involuntary control. In females the musculature surrounding the internal urethral orifice of the bladder is not organized into an internal sphincter. External urethral sphincter is present in both males and females.* Vaginal sphincter is formed by the fibres of pubococcygeus known as pubovaginalis.* There are other muscles also which contribute in compressing the vaginal orifice.* The Bulbospongiosus muscle fibres run anteriorly on either side of the vagina to attach to the corpora cavernosa of the clitoris and posteriorly to perineal body. Bulbospongiosus in females acts to constrict the vaginal orifice andexpress the secretions of greater vestibular glands. * The external urethral sphincter is composed of 3 muscles - sphincter urethrae, compressor urethrae, and urethrovaginal is sphincter (or muscle); last 2 muscles found in females only.* When external urethral sphincter contracts to compress the urethra, it compresses the vaginal orifice also.
