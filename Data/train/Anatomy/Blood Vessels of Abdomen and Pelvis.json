        "exp": "Ans. B. Superior mesenteric artery. Arterial supply to the gastrointestinal tract:-a. The arterial supply to the gastrointestinal tract is derived from the anterior midline visceral branches of the aorta. There are usually three anterior branches, the coeliac trunk and the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. Variants in the origin of the arteries are very rare. b. The most common is a joint origin of the upper two branches as either a coeliac mesenteric trunk or a lienohepaticomesenteric trunk with a separate left gastric artery. Accessory or replaced branches to the upper abdominal viscera are more common. Accessory anastomotic vessels between the origin of the coeliac trunk and superior mesenteric artery are rare. c. The inferior mesenteric artery always arises separately, however, replaced, accessory or anastomotic vessels occasionally arise from the proximal superior mesenteric artery or its branches and contribute to the arterial supply to the proximal territory of the inferior mesenteric artery. d. The coeliac trunk and its branches supplies the gastrointestinal tract from the distal third of the oesophagus to the mid part of the duodenum and all derived adenexae (liver, biliary tree, spleen, dorsal pancreas, greater omentum and lesser omentum). e. The superior mesenteric artery supplies the tract from the mid second part of the duodenum to the distal third of the transverse colon (jejunum, ileum, caecum, appendix, ascending colon and ileal mesentery). f. The inferior mesenteric artery supplies the tract from the distal transverse colon to the upper anal canal. g. Other than accessory arteries, numerous medium calibre arteries form anastomoses between the vascular territories. The most profuse occurs around the head of the pancreas and the duodenum, where anastomoses form between the anterior and posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries and the inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries; the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and jejunal arteries; the greater pancreatic artery and jejunal arteries. h. The anastomoses between the territories of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries are less pronounced and more variable: the most reliable is the pericolic marginal artery, which runs along the transverse colon. Additional anastomotic arcades may exist in the colic mesentery between the transverse and descending colon",

BLOOD SUPPLY OF THE GENITAL TRACT# The blood supply to the genital organs comes from the ovarian arteries and uterine and vaginal branches of the internal iliac arteries.# The blood supply of the upper adnexal structures comes from the ovarian arteries that arise from the anterior surface of the aorta just below the level of the renal arteries.# The accompanying plexus of veins drains into the vena cava on the right and the renal vein on the left. Ovarian artery not only supplies the gonad but also sends small vessels through mesosalpinx to supply the fallopian tube, including a prominent fimbrial branch at the lateral end of the tube.# The uterine artery originates from the internal iliac artery. It usually arises independently from this source but can have a common origin with either the internal pudendal or vaginal artery. Accompanying each uterine artery are several large uterine veins that drain the corpus and cervix.# The vagina receives its blood supply from a downward extension of the uterine artery along the lateral sulci of the vagina and from a vaginal branch of the internal iliac artery. These form an anastomotic arcade along the lateral aspect of the vagina at the 3- and 9-o'clock positions. The distal vagina also receives a supply from the pudendal vessels, and the posterior wall has a contribution from the middle and inferior hemorrhoidal vessels. LYMPHATICS OF THE GENITAL TRACT# Lymphatic drainage of the upper two thirds of the vagina and uterus is primarily to the obturator and internal and external iliac nodes, and the distal-most vagina drains with the vulvar lymphatics to the inguinal nodes. In addition, some lymphatic channels from the uterine corpus extend along the round ligament to the superficial inguinal nodes, and some nodes extend posteriorly along the uterosacral ligaments to the lateral sacral nodes.# The lymphatic drainage of the ovary follows the ovarian vessels to the region of the lower abdominal aorta, where they drain into the lumbar chain of nodes (paraaortic nodes).
