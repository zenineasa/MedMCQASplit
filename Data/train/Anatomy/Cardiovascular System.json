The hea valves can remain stretched and/or scarred, and normal blood flow through damaged valves is interrupted. Blood may flow backward through stretched valves that do not close properly, or may be blocked due to scarred valves not opening properly. When the hea is damaged in this way, the hea valves are unable to function adequately, and hea surgery may be required. Untreated, RHD causes heart failure and those affected are at risk of arrhythmias, stroke, endocarditis and complications of pregnancy.

The thickened hea muscle can make it harder for the hea to pump blood. Hyperophic cardiomyopathy often goes undiagnosed because many people with the disease have few, if any, symptoms and can lead normal lives with no significant problems. However, in a small number of people with HCM, the thickened hea muscle can cause shoness of breath, chest pain or problems in the hea's electrical system, resulting in life-threatening abnormal hea rhythms (arrhythmias).",
