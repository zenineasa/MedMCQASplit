They can be used for transient relief of symptoms and in patients unfit for surgery and pneumatic dilatation. Botulinum toxin Botulinum toxin is given by endoscopic injection into the LES. It reduces LES pressure by blocking the cholinergic excitatory nerves in the sphincter. Its effect is only sho-lived and repeated injections have to be given. Used only in patients unfit for surgery and pneumatic dilatation. Ref: Bailey & Love 25/e p1036",

Serum amylase concentration increases almost immediately with the onset of disease and peaks within several hours. There is no significant correlation between the magnitude of serum amylase elevation and severity of pancreatitis; in fact, a milder form of acute pancreatitis is often associated with higher levels of serum amylase as compared with that in a more severe form of the disease.

Patients require resuscitation, monitoring, and endoscopic investigation. Up to 70% of gastric ulcers are H. pylori-positive, so an attempt should be made to control the bleeding endoscopically, with multiple biopsy specimens of the ulcer obtained to rule out malignancy and concurrently obtained biopsy specimens of the body and antrum to test for H. pylori infection. Patients whose bleeding can be controlled and who are H. pylori-positive should undergo subsequent treatment for H. pylori infection. For bleeding that cannot be controlled, operative intervention again depends on the type of gastric ulcer. In all cases, the ulcer should ideally be excised with the addition of vagotomy depending on the cause of the ulcer (mostly for intractable ulcers that are not due to H. pylori infection or NSAID usage that can be stopped).

An excess of cholesterol relative to bile salts and phospholipids allows cholesterol to form crystals and such pile is called Lithogenic or super-saturated bile. Pathogenesis of Cholesterol gallstones There are three elements necessary for the formation of cholesterol gallstones Lithogenic bile Nucleation and Stasis or gallbladder hypomotility all three are necessary for cholesterol stone formation. A) Lithogenic (stone-forming) bile Cholesterol is insoluble in water (water is major constituent of bile, 85-95%). It is made soluble by bile acids and phospholipid - lecithin which form micelles with cholesterol So any mechanism which increases the cholesterol in bile or decreases the bile acids (salts) or lecithin makes the bile supersaturated or lithogenic. If to such a bile, the other two elements i. e. nucleation and stasis are provided, the cholesterol in solution precipitates to form cholesterol crystals which grow to form cholesterol stones.

B) Nucleation Nucleation refers to the process by which cholesterol monohydrate crystals form and agglomerate to become macroscopic crystals. Formation of cholesterol stones requires either an excess of pronucleating factors or a deficiency of antinucleating factors. Mucin and ceain non-mucin glycoproteins (and infection according to Bailey & Love) appear to be pronucleating factors, while apolipoproteins Al and All and ceain other glycoproteins appear to be antinucleating factor. C) Stasis or gall bladder hypomotility Stones would not be able to form if the gall bladder emptied all supersaturated or crystal containing bile completely.

Most patients describe eating as a laborious process during which they must pay special attention to the process. They eat slowly and use large volumes of water to help wash the food down into the stomach. As the water builds up pressure, retrosternal chest pain is experienced and can be severe until the LES opens, which provides quick relief. Regurgitation of undigested, foul-smelling food is common, and with progressive disease, aspiration can become life-threatening. Pneumonia, lung abscess, and bronchiectasis often result from long-standing achalasia. The dysphagia progresses slowly during years, and patients adapt their lifestyle to accommodate the inconveniences that accompany this disease. Patients often do not seek medical attention until their symptoms are advanced and will present with marked distention of the esophagus. the operation of choice.

CD117 is the best diagnostic marker for GISTs, but 5-10% are negative. Staining pattern may be cytoplasmic, membrane, and paranuclear (Golgi pattern). PDGFRA expression can be located in the cytoplasm, membrane, and paranuclear region (Golgi pattern), but the lack of specificity, ubiquity of the staining, and technical problems have pushed it a second plane. In GISTs, the staining pattern of PKCO is cytoplasmic, diffuse, and granular, although a Golgi pattern may be seen. Global expression varies. The staining pattern of DOG1 varies from cytoplasmic to membranous, with usually strong, diffuse intensity. The positivity rate is almost identical in some series to CD117 positivity. Currently, it is considered the most specific and sensitive marker for GIST. The current panel for GIST includes CD117, smooth muscle actin, CD34, desmin, and S-100. Some authors also include PDGFRA, PKC0, and DOG1. The last two can be of value in a subset of GISTs, mainly in CD117-negative cases.",

        "exp": "Transjugular intrahepatic poosystemic stent shunts The emergency management of variceal haemorrhage has been revolutionised by the introduction of transjugular intrahepatic poosystemic stent shunts (TIPSS). Over a sho period, this has become the main treatment of variceal haemorrhage that has not responded to drug treatment and endoscopic therapy. The shunts are inseed under local anaesthetic, analgesia and sedation, using fluoroscopic guidance and ultrasonography. Via the internal jugular vein and SVC, a guidewire is inseed into a hepatic vein and through the hepatic parenchyma into a branch of the poal vein. The track through the parenchyma is then dilated with a balloon catheter to allow inseion of a metallic stent, which is expanded once a satisfactory position is achieved to form a channel between systemic and poal venous systems. A satisfactory drop in poal venous pressure is usually associated with good control of the variceal haemorrhage. The main early complication of this technique is perforation of the liver capsule, which can be associated with fatal intraperitoneal haemorrhage. TIPSS occlusion may result in fuher variceal haemorrhage and occurs more commonly in patients with well-compensated liver disease and good synthetic function. Post-shunt encephalopathy is a confusional state caused by the poal blood bypassing the detoxification of the liver. It occurs in about 40% of patients, a similar incidence to that found after surgical shunts. If severe, the lumen of the TIPSS can be reduced by inseion of a smaller stent. T he main contraindication to TIPSS is poal vein occlusion. The main long-term complication of TIPSS is stenosis of the shunt, which is common (approximately 50% at 1 year) and may present as fuher variceal haemorrhage.

Features x Pain and boggy swelling in frontal region which is warm, tender. x Toxicity and drowsiness. x Pitting scalp oedema is typical. x Investigations: \u0017 Total leucocyte count--increased. ESR--raised. \u0017 X-ray skull. CT scan. x Differential diagnosis: Secondaries in the skull or brain. Complications Osteomyelitis of frontal bone. Spread of infection into intracranial cavity leads to intracranial abscess (Extradural or subdural abscess) (dumb-bell abscess). So may present with features of raised intracranial tension like headache, coning and convulsions. Pott's Puffy tumor can be associated with coical vein throm- bosis, epidural brain abscess/subdural empyema. The cause of vein thrombosis is explained by diplopic veins in frontal bone, which communicates with the dural venous plexus; septic thrombi can potentially evolve from foci within the frontal sinus and propagate through this venous system. Treatment x Antibiotics and drainage under general anaesthesia before it spreads into cranial cavity. x Once it extends into cranial cavity, it is treated accordingly by formal neurosurgical decompression (often using Dandy's brain cannula). x Osteomyelitis of skull bones requires radical removal with recon- struction of skull defect.

Longitudinal pancreatico jejunostomy with side-to-side anastomosis is the most suitable surgical option for this patient. (As his ductal system is dilated, a drainage procedure would be helpful) Surgical options for Chronic pancreatitis Drainage procedures Drainage procedures for patients with small ducts Patients with small (< 4-6 mm) pancreatic ducts, but in whom pancreatitis is caused by obstruction at the ampullary level, may benefit from transduodenal sphincteroplasty of the CBD with the division of the septum that lies between the MPD & CBD (pancreatic septectomy). However, most patients with chronic pancreatitis have multiple areas of duct stricture throughout the pancreas and are unlikely to benefit from these transduodenal procedures. Drainage procedures for patients with dilated ducts. A dilated duct system reflects obstruction. Thus the ideal treatment for these patients with dilated ducts is creating an anastomotic connection between the dilated ducts and the intestinal lumen. Longitudinal pancreatico jejunostomy (Puestow procedure) is the most commonly used drainage procedure. Entire pancreatic duct is longitudinally opened and anastomosed side to side to a Roux-en-Y segment of jejunum. Pancreatectomy Painful chronic pancreatitis can be treated with resection of the body and tail of the pancreas (distal pancreatectomy), resection of the head and uncinate process (Whipple procedure), subtotal pancreatectomy that spares a rim of the pancreas along with the inner curve of the duodenum, or total pancreatectomy. Many surgeons believe that it is the inflammatory process in the head of the pancreas that controls both the severity of the symptoms and fuher progression of the disease in the remaining gland. Resection of the pancreatic head can be achieved by Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) or its pylorus preserving modification or duodenum preserving pancreatic head resection. A good no. of pts. (70-80%) are completely relieved of pain. Distal pancreatectomy is the ideal surgical procedure for patients whose disease is confined to the pancreatic tail. Total or near total pancreatectomy is indicated in patients in whom a previous operative procedure like distal pancreatectomy or pancreaticoduodenectomy has failed to control pain. However, its role is not clear, as several patients even after total pancreatectomy continues to experience severe pancreatic pain. Celiac plexus block Celiac plexus nerve blocks performed either percutaneously or endoscopically have been employed to relieve chronic pancreatic pain with inconsistent results. A newer and more effective variant of this approach is thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy - resection of the segments of the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves as they enter the thorax from the abdomen.

Often, haemangiomas are multiple. Lesions found incidentally require radiological confirmation of their nature and no fuher treatment. The management of 'giant' haemangiomas is more controversial. Occasional repos of rupture of haemangiomas have led some to consider resection for large lesions, especially if they appear to be symptomatic. Diagnosis is usually incidental, and surgical resection only recommended if patients are significantly symptomatic or significant diagnostic unceainty remains after multimodal imaging.

When meconium enters the peritoneal cavity, an exudate is secreted that organizes rapidly, matting of intestinal loops occur, and in many cases in a matter of weeks, the extruded becomes calcified. Meconium remains sterile until about 3 hrs after bih; thereafter, unless the perforation has become sealed, sterile meconium peritonitis gives place to acute bacterial peritonitis which unless treated promptly is rapidly fatal. The clinical picture may be that of peritonitis and/or intestinal obstruction. Meconium peritonitis should always be suspected when a baby is born with a tense abdomen, who is vomiting and in whom there is a failure to discharge meconium.

LESRs occur without an associated pharyngeal contraction, are unaccompanied by oesophagal peristalsis, and persist for longer periods (>10 sec) than do swallow-induced LES relaxations. t.

        "exp": "Segmental anatomy of the liver Understanding the internal anatomy of the liver has greatly facilitated safe liver surgery. Couinaud, a French surgeon, described the liver as being divided into eight segments. Each of these segments can be considered as a functional unit, with a branch of the hepatic aery, poal vein and bile duct, and drained by a branch of the hepatic vein. It is the concept of these segments as distinct functional units that guides 'anatomical' liver resection. The overall anatomy of the liver is divided into a functional right and left 'unit'along the line between the gallbladder fossa and the middle hepatic vein (Cantlie's line). Liver segments (V-VIII) to the right of this line are supplied by the right hepatic aery and the right branch of the poal vein, and drain bile the right hepatic duct. To the left of this line (segments I-IV), functionally, is the left liver, which is supplied by the left branch of the hepatic aery and the left poal vein branch, and drains bile the left hepatic duct. Resections can be performed of indi- vidual segments or of the whole of the left or right hemiliver Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pg no: 1153",

        "exp": "Management of Pancreatic Pseudocyst A pancreatic pseudocyst may resolve spontaneously so it is followed with serial ultrasound studies. Indications of Surgical intervention: (Ref: Bailey and Love 25/e 1145; CSDT 13/e p583; Harrison 17/e p) Age of cyst more than 12 weeks without resolution Size of cyst greater than 6 cm. Symptomatic Development of complications (eg. haemorrhage, perforation, g. i. obstruction) But note that these indications for intervention are just a generalization used for teaching the undergraduates. These are not specific indications for interventions. Therapeutic interventions are advised (irrespective of size and duration) when the pseudocyst is symptomatic or increasing is size on follow up studies, or any complication (rupture, hemorrhage, or abscess) arise or there is suspicion of malignancy. Thus expectant management is adequate (irrespective of size) if the patient is asymptomatic and serial u/s studies show that the cyst is resolving. Surgical methods Internal Drainage -- most preferred surgical management in uncomplicated pseudocyst is internal drainage. The three options are Cystojejunostomy Cystogastrostomy Cystoduodenostomy Internal drainage can be done either open surgical or laparoscopic or by percutaneous catheter-based methods (transgastric puncture and stent placement to create a cystogastrostomy) Excision of Pseudocyst - is hardly done and is usually limited to pseudocyst involving the tail of the pancreas. External drainage - is done in:- infected pseudocyst for immature pseudocyst with thin nonfibrous walls that do not allow safe internal drainage. in an unstable pt. in whom more complex surgical intervention is precluded. Transpapillary pancreatic duct stent: Because pseudocysts often communicate with the pancreatic ductal system, two newer approaches to pseudocyst management are based on main duct drainage, rather than pseudocyst drainage per se. A stent is passed into the pseudocyst through the papilla of Vater. this drainage, paicularly when incomplete, can allow bacteria to enter the pseudocyst and lead to the development of an infected pseudocyst. Another transpapillary approach involves placing a stent across the duct defect rather than into the cyst through the defect. By excluding pancreatic juice from the pseudocyst, this bridging intraductal stent may permit the duct disruption to heal and the pseudocyst to resolve without drainage (analogous to the use of common bile duct stents in the setting of a cystic duct leak).

The clinical symptoms are because of the effects of hypoglycaemia (sweating, tremor, palpitations, confusion, headache, disorientation, visual difficulties, irrational behaviour, or even coma) The diagnosis of insulinoma requires the demonstration of an elevated plasma insulin level at the time of hypoglycemia. This is because insulinomas do not reduce the secretion of insulin in the presence of hypoglycaemia. Whereas in a normal person, insulin levels would decrease with a decrease in blood glucose levels. The most reliable test to diagnose insulinoma is a fast up to 72 h with serum glucose, and insulin measurements every 4-8 h. The test is terminated if the patient becomes symptomatic or glucose levels are <40 mg/dL (2. 2 mmol/L). Diagnosis of insulinoma is made if: A serum insulin level of 6 microunit/mL or more in the presence of blood glucose values below 40 mg/dL the ratio of plasma insulin to glucose is > 0. 3 In addition to the above criteria, some other measurements are also required before making the diagnosis of insulinoma C-peptide level serum proinsulin level, serum sulfonylurea levels These additional tests are used because any hidden use of insulin or oral hypoglycemics taken by the patient would resemble insulinoma causing high levels of insulin in presence of hypoglycaemia. The combination of elevated proinsulin levels (normal in exogenous insulin/hypoglycemic agent users), elevated C-peptide levels (low in exogenous insulin users), antibodies to insulin (positive in exogenous insulin users), and measurement of sulfonylurea levels in serum or plasma will allow the correct diagnosis to be made.

Management Management of colonoscopic perforation depends upon the size of the perforation, the duration of time since the injury, and the overall condition of the patient A large perforation recognized during the procedure requires surgical exploration. Because the bowel has almost always been prepared prior to the colonoscopy, there is usually little contamination associated with these injuries and most can be repaired primarily. If there is significant contamination, if there has been a delay in diagnosis with resulting peritonitis, or if the patient is hemodynamically unstable, proximal diversion with or without resection is the safest approach. Occasionally, a patient will develop abdominal pain and localized signs of perforation after what was thought to be an uneventful colonoscopy. Many of these patients will have a \"microperforation\" which will resolve with bowel rest, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and close observation. Evidence of peritonitis or any deterioration in clinical condition mandates exploration. Similarly, free retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal air may be discovered incidentally after colonoscopy. In a completely asymptomatic patient, this finding is thought to result from barotrauma and dissection of air through tissue planes without a free perforation. Many of these patients can be successfully treated with bowel rest & broad-spectrum antibiotics. Surgical exploration is indicated for any clinical deterioration. Ref: Schwaz 9/e p1069",

Here in this question, it's not mentioned whether the recurrence is after an acid-reducing operation or simply after medications. Lets first take the case of recurrence after a previous acid reducing surgery (this is most probably what the examiner means by recurrent ulcer as this topic is described in quite a detail in Maingot's) Recurrence after a prior acid reducing surgery: The management of patients with recurrent ulcer disease after acid-reducing operations consists of antibiotics directed at H. pylori + treatment with an antisecretory medication + limitation of NSAID use, smoking cessation, and limitation of alcohol intake. Ulcer disease refractory to such treatment is unusual. If the ulcer persists for more than 3 months despite eradication of H. pylori and maintenance antisecretory therapy or the ulcer is associated with perforation, bleeding, or obstruction, the operation is indicated. The choice of operation for recurrent postoperative ulcer depends on the indication for initial operation & the operation performed previously. Since these ulcers have recurred despite prior peptic ulcer disease surgery and maximal medical therapy, surgery should be appropriately aggressive. Truncal vagotomy with antrectomy is the operation of choice. This is the procedure with the least recurrence rate. Recurrence after prior treatment by medications: If at all surgery is needed an operation with least morbidity is advised i. e. Highly selective vagotomy. Recurrent gastric ulcer: Non-healing gastric ulcers despite antibiotics and antisecretory drugs should be viewed with suspicion for malignancy (Duodenal ulcers have no risk of malignancy) and thus distal gastrectomy is the recommended operation. Other surgical options are wedge resection with HSV. (Note HSV is of no use in Type I and Type IV ulcers as these are associated with acid hyposecretion) Ref - Internet",

These are Pain - Dull noncolicky and insidious in onset. Anorexia, nausea General malaise, diarrhea Later on, symptoms result from compression of tubular retroperitoneal structures. The major structure involved are- Ureter - Most commonly involved Aoa Inferior venacava Symptoms due to the involvement of ureter (usually b/1 involvement) Dysuria Frequency of urination Chills and fever occur with secondary infection of a hydronephrotic kidney. Hematuria can occur. Diagnosis The diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis usually can be made accurately by intravenous pyelography if uremia is not present. The characteristic finding on pyelogram are Hydronephrosis with a dilated touous upper ureter. Medial detion of the ureter Extrinsic ureteral compression Note: In a retroperitoneal tumor, ureter is laterally deted while in retroperitoneal fibrosis ureter medially detes. Currently, the imaging procedure of choice is the CT scan. But if renal function is compromised contrast agents are not given and then MRI is the procedure of choice. T/T of Retroperitoneal fibrosis Coicosteroids, with or without surgery, are the mainstay of medical therapy. Surgical treatment is required in patients who present with moderate or massive hydronephrosis. It consists primarily of ureterolysis (freeing the ureter from adhesions and surrounding tissue) or ureteral stenting..

The incidence of Barrett esophagus is rising, and it is estimated to occur in as many as 10% of individuals with symptomatic GERD. Barrett esophagus is most common in white males and typically presents between 40 and 60 years of age. The greatest concern in Barrett esophagus is that it confers an increased risk of esoph- ageal adenocarcinoma. Genomic sequencing of biopsies involved by Barrett esophagus has revealed the presence of mutations that are shared with esophageal adenocarci- noma, in keeping with the idea that Barrett esophagus is a precursor lesion to cancer. Potentially oncogenic mutations are more numerous when biopsies demonstrate dysplasia, which is detected in 0. 2% to 2% of persons with Barrett esophagus each year. The presence of dysplasia, a prein- vasive change, is associated with prolonged symptoms, longer segment length, increased patient age, and Caucasian race. Although the vast majority of esophageal adenocar- cinomas are associated with Barrett esophagus, it is impor- tant to remember that most individuals with Barrett esophagus do not develop esophageal tumors.",
