Septomarginal trabecula: It is a specialized bridge which extends from the right of ventricularseptum to the base of anterior papillary muscle. It contains the right branch of atrioventricular bundle. 3. Papillary muscles are conical projections of muscle fiber bundles. Their base is attached to the ventricular wall and the apex is attached to the chordae tendinae, which are further attached to the cusps of atrioventricular (AV) valves.

The left primary bronchus is not as vertical and therefore does not present the path of least resistance.

The carina is a ridge separating the openings of left and right bronchi, the \"fork in the road, \" so to speak. The trachea is a tubular structure supported by incomplete cartilaginous rings, and the likelihood that an object will be lodged there is minimal.

Physical examination reveals that the patient has miosis of the pupil, partial ptosis of the eyelid, and anhydrosis of the face. Which of the following structures has most likely been injured?",
        "exp": "(a) Source: GAS 888-889; GA 108-109. Miosis, partial ptosis, and anhydrosis are a clinically important constellation of symptoms possibly indicating Horner syndrome. Horner syndrome is a lesion of the cervical sympathetic chain and sympathetic chain ganglia and is often a result of a Pancoast tumor, also known as a superior pulmonary sulcus tumor of the apex of the lung. The pupil, eyelid (superior tarsal muscle), and sweat glands are all under sympathetic nervous system control. The arch of the aorta and phrenic nerve are not part of the autonomic nervous system. The vagus nerve does carry parasympathetic fibers to muscles of the trachea, bronchi, digestive tract, and heart but not to any structure in the head and neck (laryngeal supply, and Von Ebner's glands in the tongue). A lesion to the phrenic nerve would result in paralysis of the diaphragm. The cardiopulmonary nerves are splanchnic nerves that are postganglionic and sympathetic. They originate in cervical and upper thoracic ganglia and innervate the thoracic cavity. The cardiopulmonary plexus is the autonomic supply to the heart.",

There are three large openings, for the aorta, oesophagus and inferior vena cava, and a number of smaller ones. The aortic aperture. It is the lowest and most posterior of the large openings, and is found at the level of the lower border of the twelfth thoracic vertebra and the thoracolumbar intervertebral disc, slightly to the left of the midline. The aortic opening transmits the aorta, thoracic duct, lymphatic trunks from the lower posterior thoracic wall and. sometimes, the azygos and hemiazygos veins. The oesophageal aperture. It is located at the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra, above, in front and a little to the left of, the aortic opening. It transmits the oesophagus, gastric nerves, oesophageal branches of the left gastric vessels and some lymphatic vessels. The vena caval aperture. The highest of the three large openings, lies at about the level of the disc between the eighth and ninth thoracic vertebrae. It is traversed by the inferior vena cava, which adheres to the margin of the opening, and by some branches of the right phrenic nerve. Also note: There are two lesser apertures in each crus: one transmits the greater, and the other the lesser, splanchnic nerve. The ganglionated sympathetic trunks usually enter the abdominal cavity behind the diaphragm, deep to the medial arcuate ligament.
