Anterior belly- The anterior belly arises from the digastric fossa, on the base of mandible, close to the symphysis, and passes downward and backward.- The anterior body is supplied by the mylohyoid nerve, a branch of the inferior alveolar nerve, itself a branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. Intermediate tendon- The two bellies end in an intermediate tendon which perforates the Stylohyoid muscle, and run in a fibrous loop attached to the body and the greater cornu of the hyoid bone.

        "exp": "Ans. a. Diastolic blood pressure Aerial hypertension is the result of abnormal flow/resistance relationships. Resistance to outflow consists of different components: the systolic component is the one generated by conductance vessels, whereas the diastolic component consists of peripheral resistance, which regulates peripheral blood supply due to the run-off of conductance vessels during left ventricular diastole. Thus, an increase in systemic resistance results in a rise in diastolic blood pressure. If the elasticity of conductance vessels decreases, diastolic run-off also decreases and diastolic blood pressure goes down. When this loss of elasticity occurs, the ejection force cannot be anymore offset by aerial distension, the pulse wave velocity increases and reflex waves to the hea arrive earlier, causing the systolic blood pressure to augment. Such an augmentation, together with decreasing diastolic blood pressure results in an enhancement of the pulse pressure. When the stroke volume is normal, an increase in pulse pressure is, therefore, a marker of altered conductance. However, if, due to loss of elasticity of the conductance aeries diastolic blood pressure goes down, increasing systolic pressure also protects against a decrease in mean pressure. Indeed, in conditions of elevated pulse pressure, the mean pressure can be normal or high, indicating that when evaluating blood pressure all components should be taken into consideration. A high systolic blood pressure associated with a normal mean blood pressure is suggestive of a normal peripheral resistance. 'Diastolic Pressure. Systolic pressure is peak pressure reached during systole, similarly, diastolic pressure refers to lowest pressure during diastole. Diastolic blood pressure is an index to peripheral resistance. Elasticity of aoa and large aeries is mainly responsible for origin and maintenance of diastolic pressure (by Windkessel elastic recoil effect). Because the elasticity is higher in younger subjects, diastolic pressure is maintained and pulse pressure is narrow. Because the elasticity is lower in old persons, diastolic pressure is decreased and pulse pressure is widened.",

        "question": "How many parathyroid glands do humans have?",
        "exp": "Parathyroid glands: The parathyroid glands are small, yellowish-brown, ovoid or lentiform structures, usually lies between the posterior lobar borders of the thyroid gland and its capsule. They are commonly 6 mm long, 3-4 mm across, and 1-2 mm from back to front, each weighing about 50 mg. Usually, there are two on each side, superior and inferior. Variations: There may be only three or many minute parathyroid islands scattered in connective tissue near the usual sites. Normally the inferior parathyroids migrate only to the inferior thyroid poles, but they may descend with the thymus into the thorax or not descend at all, remaining above their normal level near the carotid bifurcation. To help identification, the anastomotic connection between the superior and inferior thyroid arteries along the posterior border of the thyroid gland usually passes very close to the parathyroids. The inferior pair are more variably situated, and may be within the fascial thyroid sheath, below the inferior thyroid arteries and near the inferior lobar poles; or outside the sheath, immediately above an inferior thyroid artery; or in the thyroid gland near its inferior pole. The superior parathyroids are usually dorsal, the inferior parathyroids ventral, to the recurrent laryngeal nerves. Vasculature: The parathyroid glands have a rich blood supply from the inferior thyroid arteries or from anastomoses between the superior and inferior vessels. Approximately one-third of human parathyroid glands have two or more parathyroid arteries. Lymph vessels are numerous and associated with those of the thyroid and thymus glands. Nerve supply: The nerve supply is sympathetic, either direct from the superior or middle cervical ganglia or via a plexus in the fascia on the posterior lobar aspects. Parathyroid activity is controlled by variations in blood calcium level: it is inhibited by a rise and stimulated by a fall. The nerves are believed to be vasomotor but not secretomotor Histology: Contains two types of cells Active cells or chief cells which produce parathormone. Chief cells differ ultrastructurally according to their level of activity: active chief cells have large Golgi complexes with numerous vesicles and small membrane-bound granules. Glycogen granules are most abundant in inactive cells, which appear histologically as \u2018clear' cells. In normal human parathyroid glands, inactive chief cells outnumber active cells in a ratio of 3-5: 1 Second cell type, the oxyphil (eosinophil) cell, appears just before puberty and increases in number with age. Oxyphil cells are larger than chief cells and contain more cytoplasm, which stains deeply with eosin. Their nuclei are smaller and more darkly staining than those of chief cells, and their cytoplasm is unusually rich in mitochondria. The functional significance of oxyphil cells and their relationship to chief cells are uncertain",

The juxtaglomerular apparatus is a microscopic structure in the kidney, which regulates the function of Lech nephron. The juxtaglomerular apparatus is named for its proximity to the glomerulus: it is found between the vascular pole of the renal corpuscle and the returning distal convoluted tubule of the same nephron. This location is critical to its function in regulating renal blood flow and glomerular. filtration rate. The three microscopic components of the apparatus are the macula densa, extraglomerular mesangial cells (lacis cells), and juxtaglomerular cells. Juxtaglomerular cell. Juxtaglomerular cells (JG cells, also known as granular cells) are the site of renin secretion. The JG cells are found in the media of afferent aerioles of the glomerulus and act as an intro-renal pressure sensor Lowered pressure leads to decreased pressure on the JG cells stimulating renin secretion. Renin then acts to increase systemic blood pressure (while maintaining GFR) the resi angiotensin system. Macula densa. At the point where the afferent aeriole enters the glomerulus and the efferent leaves it, the tubule of the nephron touches the aeriole of the glomerulus from which it arose. At this location, which marks the sta of the distal convulation, there is the modified region of tubular epithelium called the macula densa. The macula densa senses sodium chloride concentration in the distal tubule of the kidney and secretes a locally active (paracrine) vasopressor which acts on the adjacent afferent aeriole to decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as pa of the tubuloglomerular feedback loop. Specifically, excessive filtration at the glomerulus or inadequate sodium uptake in the proximal tubule / thick ascending loop of Henle brings fluid to the distal convoluted tubule that has an abnormally high concentration of sodium. Na/K/2. C1 cotranspoers move sodium into the cells of the macula densa. The increased Na+ conc. triggers a signal that causes constriction of the afferent aeriole thus reducing the GFRLacis cells or extraglomerular mesangial cells. The function of the extraglomerular mesangial cells remains somewhat mysterious. They contain actin and myosin, allowing them to contract when stimulated by renal sympathetic nerves, which may provide a way for the sympathetic nervous system to modulate the actions of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. In addition, extraglomerular mesangial cells are strategically positioned between the macula densa and the afferent aeriole, and may mediate signalling between these two structures",

        "exp": "The defecation reflex that is evoked when the rectum is distended involves three responses: 1) the internal anal sphincter relaxes, 2) the external anal sphincter contracts, and 3) a conscious urge to defecate is perceived. This neural reflex involves the pelvic nerve, which provides the parasympathetic preganglionic innervation to the internal anal sphincter (composed of smooth muscle) and also carries the sensory afferent information from the rectum to the spinal cord, and the pudendal nerve, which carries the somatic efferent inputs to the external anal sphincter (composed of skeletal muscle). In the patient described above, the pelvic nerve is most likely damaged since neither the reflex relaxation of the internal anal sphincter nor the urge to defecate is evoked by rectal distention. Damage to the internal anal sphincter would most likely cause resting tone to be low and, if anything, lead to fecal incontinence rather than constipation. Fuhermore, damage to the internal anal sphincter could not explain the failure of the appearance of the urge to defecate. The external anal sphincter appears to function normally since distention of the rectum evokes the expected contraction. The normal contraction of the external anal sphincter also suggests that the pudendal nerve is intact. Ref: Moon D. A., Foreman K. B., Albeine K. H. (2011). Chapter 12. Pelvis and Perineum. In D. A.

Below the arcuate line, the rectus abdominis is covered by transversalis fascia, not the rectus sheath! The linea alba is also related to the rectus abdominis. It is a ligament that runs down the middle of the abdomen, bisecting the rectus abdominis. It is made by the intermingling of the aponeuroses of the external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis. All of the other answer choices are related to the inguinal canal. The falx inguinalis (sometimes called the inguinal falx or conjoint tendon), is the inferomedial attachment of transversus abdominis with some fibers of internal abdominal oblique. It contributes to the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. The inguinal ligament is the ligament that connects the anterior superior iliac spine with the pubic tubercle. It makes the floor of the inguinal canal. The internal (deep) inguinal ring is the entrance to the inguinal canal, where the transversalis fascia pouches out and creates an opening through which structures can leave the abdominal cavity.

The developing bodies and interveebral discs of the veebral column replace the notochord. NOTOCHORD: The notochordal plate becomes the centrally placed notochord, which acts as a foundation around which the veebral column develops. It extends throughout the entire length of the future veebral column, and reaches as far as the anterior end of the mid-brain, where it ends in a hook-like extremity in the region of the future dorsum sellae of the sphenoid bone. The notochord then undergoes involution and becomes the nucleus pulposus of the interveebral disks. Remnants of the notochord: are located in the nucleus pulposus, clivus, nasopharyngeal notochordal bursa, and sacrum. The most common anomaly due to incomplete resorption of notochord is butterfly veebra. Nucleus pulposis: The nucleus pulposus is 70-90% water although the exact propoion varies with age. Proteoglycans are the next major component, and they constitute about 65% of the dry weight of the nucleus. Type II collagen is seen interspersed in the proteoglycan medium. It functions to distribute hydaulic pressure in all directons of the disc. It is present in the middle of the veebral disc.

It is classically located in the distal ileum within 30 cm of the ileocecal valve, and the structure is a true diveiculum with mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis propria. Many Meckel's diveicula contain ectopic pancreatic tissue or gastric mucosa, and the acid production from the gastric mucosa may be sufficient to produce a small peptic ulcer in adjacent intestinal mucosa. Such small peptic ulcers are occasional sources of mysterious appendicitis-like pain or intestinal bleeding. Peptic ulceration adjacent to a Meckel's diveiculum should be suspected in any child who presents with massive, painless rectal bleeding. Technetium concentrates in gastric mucosa, and the scan in this patient demonstrated a small amount of ectopic gastric mucosa located in the diveiculum. Acute appendicitis is usually very painful and does not typically cause rectal bleeding. A lesion of the cecum would have been revealed by thorough colonoscopy.

NOTOCHORD: The notochordal plate becomes the centrally placed notochord, which acts as a foundation around which the veebral column develops. It extends throughout the entire length of the future veebral column, and reaches as far as the anterior end of the mid-brain, where it ends in a hook-like extremity in the region of the future dorsum sellae of the sphenoid bone. The notochord then undergoes involution and becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervetebral disks. Remnants of the notochord: are located in the nucleus pulposus, clivus, nasopharyngeal notochordal bursa, and sacrum. The most common anomaly due to incomplete resorption of notochord is butterfly veebra. Nucleus pulposis: The nucleus pulposus is 70-90% water although the exact propoion varies with age. Proteoglycans are the next major component, and they constitute about 65% of the dry weight of the nucleus. Type II collagen is seen interspersed in the proteoglycan medium.

They secrete an alkaline product that protects the duodenal mucosa from the acidic chyme and helps achieve optimal pH for pancreatic enzymes. The small intestinal villi are outgrowths of the mucosa into the lumen. Their epithelium contains columnar absorptive cells and goblet cells (produce acid glycoproteins that protect and lubricate the lining of the intestine). Near the base of each villus, there are tubular glands called crypts whose lining is continuous with the simple columnar epithelium of the villus. The crypts include Paneth cells, which produce acidophilic cytoplasmic granules containing bactericidal enzymes. The lamina propria of the small intestine penetrates the core of the villi and is composed of blood vessels, lymphatics, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells. The ampulla of Vater receives bile from the common bile duct and the main pancreatic duct, delivering it to the duodenum through the major duodenal papilla.

Aery to ductus deferens anastomose with testicular aery to supply epididymis and testis.- Testicular aery also supplies perirenal fat, ureter, & iliac lymph node (in abdomen), and cremaster (in inguinal canal). The testicular aery represent peisistent lateral splanchnic aoic branches. Testis is mainly supplied by testicular aeryQ (an anterior branch of aoa). It also recieves blood from the cremasteric branch of inferior epigastric aery and from aery to vas (ductus) deferens (branch of superior vesicle aery)Q. That's why ligation of testicular aery high in abdomen usually leave testis unharmed, whereas interruption in the region of spermatic cord may interefere with all vessels & cause infarction.- In treating varicocele, both testicular aery & vein are ligated quite high up, which provides the advantage of ligating venae comitantes of aery.

The development of the urinary system and genital systems are closely linked. The urogenital system develops from intermediate mesoderm. A longitudinal elevation - the urogenital ridge - forms on each side of the dorsal aoa, with the nephrogenic cord leading to the urinary system and the gonadal ridge leading to the genital system.

It can be associated with paial or complete urethral rupture, or deep dorsal vein injury. The most common cause is sexual intercourse, but other causes include animal bites, stabbing, bullet wounds, and self-mutilation. On examination, the penis is acutely swollen but flaccid, discolored, and tender. If Buck's fascia remains intact, the hematoma involves the penile shaft only. This results in typical eggplant deformity. If Buck's fascia is disrupted, hematoma can extend to the scrotum, perineum and suprapubic regions. A retrograde urethrogram may be necessary to assure urethral integrity. Surgical treatment consists of hematoma evacuation and suture apposition of the disrupted tunica albuginea. Ref: Nicks B.

Technetium scans can be used to identify diveicula with heterotopic gastric tissue. Acute diveiculitis although not the most common presentation can mimic acute appendicitis clinically.

        "exp": "The parotid gland is supplied by the parasympathetic, sympathetic and sensory fibres: Parasympathetic (secretomotor) supply: It is provided through auriculotemporal nerve. The preganglionic fibres arise from the inferior salivatory nucleus in the medulla and pass successively through glossopharyngeal nerve, tympanic branch of glossopharyngeal (Jacobson's nerve), tympanic plexus and lesser petrosal nerve to relay into otic ganglion. Postganglionic fibres arise from the cells of the ganglion and pass through the auriculotemporal nerve to supply the parotid gland. The stimulation of parasympathetic supply produces watery secretion. Sympathetic supply: It is derived from sympathetic plexus around external carotid artery formed by postganglionic fibres derived from superior cervical sympathetic ganglion. The preganglionic sympathetic fibres arise from the lateral horn of T1 spinal segment. The sympathetic fibres are vasomotor and their stimulation produces thick sticky secretion. Sensory supply: It is derived from: (b) Auriculotemporal nerve. Great auricular nerve (C2 and C3). The C2 fibres are sensory to the parotid fascia. Key Concept: Postganglionic fibres arise from the cells of otic ganglion and pass through the auriculotemporal nerve to supply the parotid gland. The stimulation of parasympathetic supply produces watery secretion. The sympathetic fibres are vasomotor and their stimulation produces thick sticky secretion.
