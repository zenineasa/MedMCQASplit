        "exp": "Ans. a. Diastolic blood pressure Aerial hypertension is the result of abnormal flow/resistance relationships. Resistance to outflow consists of different components: the systolic component is the one generated by conductance vessels, whereas the diastolic component consists of peripheral resistance, which regulates peripheral blood supply due to the run-off of conductance vessels during left ventricular diastole. Thus, an increase in systemic resistance results in a rise in diastolic blood pressure. If the elasticity of conductance vessels decreases, diastolic run-off also decreases and diastolic blood pressure goes down. When this loss of elasticity occurs, the ejection force cannot be anymore offset by aerial distension, the pulse wave velocity increases and reflex waves to the heart arrive earlier, causing the systolic blood pressure to augment. Such an augmentation, together with decreasing diastolic blood pressure results in an enhancement of the pulse pressure. When the stroke volume is normal, an increase in pulse pressure is, therefore, a marker of altered conductance. However, if, due to loss of elasticity of the conductance aeries diastolic blood pressure goes down, increasing systolic pressure also protects against a decrease in mean pressure. Indeed, in conditions of elevated pulse pressure, the mean pressure can be normal or high, indicating that when evaluating blood pressure all components should be taken into consideration. A high systolic blood pressure associated with a normal mean blood pressure is suggestive of a normal peripheral resistance. 'Diastolic Pressure. Systolic pressure is peak pressure reached during systole, similarly, diastolic pressure refers to lowest pressure during diastole. Diastolic blood pressure is an index to peripheral resistance. Elasticity of aoa and large aeries is mainly responsible for origin and maintenance of diastolic pressure (by Windkessel elastic recoil effect). Because the elasticity is higher in younger subjects, diastolic pressure is maintained and pulse pressure is narrow. Because the elasticity is lower in old persons, diastolic pressure is decreased and pulse pressure is widened.",

        "exp": "Parathyroid glands: The parathyroid glands are small, yellowish-brown, ovoid or lentiform structures, usually lies between the posterior lobar borders of the thyroid gland and its capsule. They are commonly 6 mm long, 3-4 mm across, and 1-2 mm from back to front, each weighing about 50 mg. Usually, there are two on each side, superior and inferior. Variations: There may be only three or many minute parathyroid islands scattered in connective tissue near the usual sites. Normally the inferior parathyroids migrate only to the inferior thyroid poles, but they may descend with the thymus into the thorax or not descend at all, remaining above their normal level near the carotid bifurcation. To help identification, the anastomotic connection between the superior and inferior thyroid arteries along the posterior border of the thyroid gland usually passes very close to the parathyroids. The inferior pair are more variably situated, and may be within the fascial thyroid sheath, below the inferior thyroid arteries and near the inferior lobar poles; or outside the sheath, immediately above an inferior thyroid artery; or in the thyroid gland near its inferior pole. The superior parathyroids are usually dorsal, the inferior parathyroids ventral, to the recurrent laryngeal nerves. Vasculature: The parathyroid glands have a rich blood supply from the inferior thyroid arteries or from anastomoses between the superior and inferior vessels. Approximately one-third of human parathyroid glands have two or more parathyroid arteries. Lymph vessels are numerous and associated with those of the thyroid and thymus glands. Nerve supply: The nerve supply is sympathetic, either direct from the superior or middle cervical ganglia or via a plexus in the fascia on the posterior lobar aspects. Parathyroid activity is controlled by variations in blood calcium level: it is inhibited by a rise and stimulated by a fall. The nerves are believed to be vasomotor but not secretomotor Histology: Contains two types of cells Active cells or chief cells which produce parathormone. Chief cells differ ultrastructurally according to their level of activity: active chief cells have large Golgi complexes with numerous vesicles and small membrane-bound granules. Glycogen granules are most abundant in inactive cells, which appear histologically as \u2018clear' cells. In normal human parathyroid glands, inactive chief cells outnumber active cells in a ratio of 3-5: 1 Second cell type, the oxyphil (eosinophil) cell, appears just before puberty and increases in number with age. Oxyphil cells are larger than chief cells and contain more cytoplasm, which stains deeply with eosin. Their nuclei are smaller and more darkly staining than those of chief cells, and their cytoplasm is unusually rich in mitochondria. The functional significance of oxyphil cells and their relationship to chief cells are uncertain",

The juxtaglomerular apparatus is a microscopic structure in the kidney, which regulates the function of Lech nephron. The juxtaglomerular apparatus is named for its proximity to the glomerulus: it is found between the vascular pole of the renal corpuscle and the returning distal convoluted tubule of the same nephron. This location is critical to its function in regulating renal blood flow and glomerular. filtration rate. The three microscopic components of the apparatus are the macula densa, extraglomerular mesangial cells (lacis cells), and juxtaglomerular cells. Juxtaglomerular cell. Juxtaglomerular cells (JG cells, also known as granular cells) are the site of renin secretion. The JG cells are found in the media of afferent aerioles of the glomerulus and act as an intro-renal pressure sensor Lowered pressure leads to decreased pressure on the JG cells stimulating renin secretion. Renin then acts to increase systemic blood pressure (while maintaining GFR) the resi angiotensin system. Macula densa. At the point where the afferent aeriole enters the glomerulus and the efferent leaves it, the tubule of the nephron touches the aeriole of the glomerulus from which it arose. At this location, which marks the sta of the distal convulation, there is the modified region of tubular epithelium called the macula densa. The macula densa senses sodium chloride concentration in the distal tubule of the kidney and secretes a locally active (paracrine) vasopressor which acts on the adjacent afferent aeriole to decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as pa of the tubuloglomerular feedback loop. Specifically, excessive filtration at the glomerulus or inadequate sodium uptake in the proximal tubule / thick ascending loop of Henle brings fluid to the distal convoluted tubule that has an abnormally high concentration of sodium. Na/K/2. C1 cotranspoers move sodium into the cells of the macula densa. The increased Na+ conc. triggers a signal that causes constriction of the afferent aeriole thus reducing the GFRLacis cells or extraglomerular mesangial cells. The function of the extraglomerular mesangial cells remains somewhat mysterious. They contain actin and myosin, allowing them to contract when stimulated by renal sympathetic nerves, which may provide a way for the sympathetic nervous system to modulate the actions of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. In addition, extraglomerular mesangial cells are strategically positioned between the macula densa and the afferent aeriole, and may mediate signalling between these two structures",

It is classically located in the distal ileum within 30 cm of the ileocecal valve, and the structure is a true diveiculum with mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis propria. Many Meckel's diveicula contain ectopic pancreatic tissue or gastric mucosa, and the acid production from the gastric mucosa may be sufficient to produce a small peptic ulcer in adjacent intestinal mucosa. Such small peptic ulcers are occasional sources of mysterious appendicitis-like pain or intestinal bleeding. Peptic ulceration adjacent to a Meckel's diveiculum should be suspected in any child who presents with massive, painless rectal bleeding. Technetium concentrates in gastric mucosa, and the scan in this patient demonstrated a small amount of ectopic gastric mucosa located in the diveiculum. Acute appendicitis is usually very painful and does not typically cause rectal bleeding. A lesion of the cecum would have been revealed by thorough colonoscopy.

Aery to ductus deferens anastomose with testicular aery to supply epididymis and testis.- Testicular aery also supplies perirenal fat, ureter, & iliac lymph node (in abdomen), and cremaster (in inguinal canal). The testicular aery represent peisistent lateral splanchnic aoic branches. Testis is mainly supplied by testicular aeryQ (an anterior branch of aoa). It also recieves blood from the cremasteric branch of inferior epigastric aery and from aery to vas (ductus) deferens (branch of superior vesicle aery)Q. That's why ligation of testicular aery high in abdomen usually leave testis unharmed, whereas interruption in the region of spermatic cord may interefere with all vessels & cause infarction.- In treating varicocele, both testicular aery & vein are ligated quite high up, which provides the advantage of ligating venae comitantes of aery.

        "exp": "The most common location of a Meckel's is the terminal ileum usually located 45-90 cm from the ileocecal valve. The location on the antimesenteric border is normal and is not an indication for surgical resection. Also Know: The most common complication from Meckel's diveiculum is bleeding secondary to ulceration of the heterotopic gastric tissue. It is the most commonly encountered diveiculum of the small intestines and represents a true diveiculum. It is the direct result of persistence of the omphalomesenteric duct. Technetium scans can be used to identify diveicula with heterotopic gastric tissue. Acute diveiculitis although not the most common presentation can mimic acute appendicitis clinically. There is much controversy about the treatment of an incidentally found Meckel's diveiculum. The general principles are that it should be removed if there is evidence of heterotopic tissue and/or there is a narrowed neck. Other relative indications include unexplained abdominal symptoms and evidence of prior inflammation. Ref: Tavakkolizadeh A., Whang E. E., Ashley S. W., Zinner M. J. (2010). Chapter 28.

The preganglionic fibres arise from the inferior salivatory nucleus in the medulla and pass successively through glossopharyngeal nerve, tympanic branch of glossopharyngeal (Jacobson's nerve), tympanic plexus and lesser petrosal nerve to relay into otic ganglion. Postganglionic fibres arise from the cells of the ganglion and pass through the auriculotemporal nerve to supply the parotid gland. The stimulation of parasympathetic supply produces watery secretion. Sympathetic supply: It is derived from sympathetic plexus around external carotid artery formed by postganglionic fibres derived from superior cervical sympathetic ganglion. The preganglionic sympathetic fibres arise from the lateral horn of T1 spinal segment. The sympathetic fibres are vasomotor and their stimulation produces thick sticky secretion. Sensory supply: It is derived from: (b) Auriculotemporal nerve. Great auricular nerve (C2 and C3). The C2 fibres are sensory to the parotid fascia. Key Concept: Postganglionic fibres arise from the cells of otic ganglion and pass through the auriculotemporal nerve to supply the parotid gland. The stimulation of parasympathetic supply produces watery secretion. The sympathetic fibres are vasomotor and their stimulation produces thick sticky secretion.

Upper lesions of the brachial plexus are injuries resulting from excessive displacement of the head to the opposite side and depression of the shoulder on the same side. This causes excessive traction or even tearing of C5 and C6 roots of the plexus. It occurs in infants during a difficult delivery or in adults after a blow to or fall on the shoulder. The suprascapular nerve, the nerve to the subclavius, and the musculocutaneous and axillary nerves all possess nerve fibers derived from C5 and C6 roots and will therefore be functionless. The following muscles will consequently be paralyzed: the supraspinatus (abductor of the shoulder) and infraspinatus (lateral rotator of the shoulder); the subclavius (depresses the clavicle); the biceps brachii (supinator of the forearm, flexor of the elbow, weak flexor of the shoulder) and the greater pa of the brachialis (flexor of the elbow) and the coracobrachialis (flexes the shoulder); and the deltoid (abductor of the shoulder) and the teres minor (lateral rotator of the shoulder). Thus, the limb will hang limply by the side, medially rotated by the unopposed sternocostal pa of the pectoralis major; the forearm will be pronated because of loss of the action of the biceps. The position of the upper limb in this condition has been likened to that of a poer or waiter hinting for a tip. In addition, there will be a loss of sensation down the lateral side of the arm. Treatment. The three most common treatments from Erb's Palsy are: Nerve transfers (usually from the opposite leg), sub scapularis releases and latissimus dorsi tendon transfers.",

        "exp": "Metastatic bone disease is the most commonest malignancy of bones and is much more than primary bone tumors Metastatic Bone Diseases(MBD) Cancer that begins in an organ, such as the lungs. breast, or prostate, and then spreads to bone is called metastatic bone disease (MBD). More than 1. 2 million new cancer cases are diagnosed each year. Approximately 50% of these tumours can spread (metastasize) to the skeleton. With improved medical treatment of many cancers --especially breast. lung, and prostate -- patients are living longer. However, the primary cancers in more of these patients are spreading to bone. The tumours that result are called bone metastases. Organs involved in MBD * The most common cancers that arise from organs and spread to bone include: * Breast * Lung * Thyroid * Kidney * Prostate Pathophysiology of MBD: MBD causes pain in the area of spread. damages and weakens bone, and puts the patient at a greater risk for broken bones. It can make it hard to paicipate in daily activities. The biggest concern for patients with MBD is the general loss in quality of life. How much of an effect MBD has on a patient will vary and is associated with how much the cancer has spread. which bones are affected, and how severe the bone damage is. There are a range of treatment options, however. that can help patients manage pain and maintain their independence and activity levels. After the lung and the liver, the skeleton is the most common site of spread of cancers that begin in organs. Metastases to the lung and liver are often not detected until late in the course of disease because patients experience no symptoms. In contrast. bone metastases are generally painful when they occur. Cancer most commonly spreads to these sites in the skeleton: Spine Pelvis Ribs Skull Upper arm Symptoms Pain. The most common symptom of MBD is pain. Patients may have pain in the spine, pelvis, or extremities because the bone has been weakened by the tumour. Fractures. Weakened bones break more easily. A fracture from a minor injury is another possible sign of MBD. Anemia. The most common sites of spread -- spine, pelvis, ribs, skull, upper arm, and long bones of the leg --correspond to areas of bone marrow that produce high levels of red blood cells, the cells responsible for carrying oxygen to tissues in the body. Anemia (decreased red blood cell production) is a common blood abnormality in patients with MBD. A cancer patient who experiences any pain, especially in the back, legs, and arms, should notify his or her doctor immediately. Pain that occurs without activity (i. e., walking or lifting an object) is paicularly concerning. Refer Apleys 9th/e p 216",

The tongue's embryonic orgin is derived from first 4 pharyngeal arches contributing different components. Anterior 2/3\" or body of tongue: is derived from 3 lingual buds- the median tongue bud (tuberculum impar) and 2 lateral lingual swellings developing at each side of the median tongue bud. All arising from the la pharyngeal arch. The lateral tongue buds rapidly increase in size, merge with each other, and overgrow the median tongue bud. The merged distal tongue buds form the anterior 2/3rd of the tongue. The median tongue bud forms no recognizable pa of the adult tongue. Since the mucosa covering the ant. 2/3rd of the tongue originates from the first pharyngeal arch; sensory innervation to this area is by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. (Taste sensation to the anterior 2/3rd of the tongue is provided by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve). Post 1/3\" or root of the tongue: is formed from two median elevations;- The copula arising from the 2\"d pair of branchial arches, just caudal to the foramen ceacum.- The hypopharyngeal or hypobranchial eminence developing caudal to the copula from the 3rd and dh pair of arches. As the tongue develops the copula is gradually overgrown by the hypopharyngeal eminence and disappears. As a result, the post pa of the tongue develops from the hypopharyngeal eminence( the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal arches). Thus the sensory nerve supply to this pa of tongue is from the glossopharyngeal nerve. (taste sensation is also carried by the glossopharyngeal nerve). Pharyngeal arch mesenchyme forms the connective tissue and vasculature of the tongue. Some of the tongue muscles probably develop in situ from mesenchyme, but most develop from myoblasts that migrate from the occipital myotomes. The hypoglossal nerve accompanies the myoblasts during their migration and innervates the tongue muscles. The Nerve Supply of the Tonguea. Motor nerve- All the intrinsic & extrinsic muscles, except the palatoglossus, are supplied by the hypoglossal nerve. The palatoglossus is supplied by the cranial pa of the accessory nerve through the pharyngeal plexus. b.

Foramen primum is formed between the free border of growing septum primum and fused AV cushions (septum intermedium). Shortly afterwards the septum primum fuses with septum intermedium (fused AV cushions), obliterating foramen primum Foramen secundum is formed by degeneration of cranial part of septum primum. Septum secundum grows caudally to the right of septum primum and overlaps the foramen secundum. The passage between septum primum and septum secundum is called foramen ovale. After birth, foramen ovale closes by fusion of septum primum with septum secundum. Failure of fusion of these two septa results in patent foramen ovale.",

Loss of myelin, known as demyelination, results in disturbance of the ability to transmit a nerve impulse through the demyelinated segment and this has serious consequences for function.

The terminal branches of the internal carotid are as follows: Ophthalmic aery: Courses through the optic canal to supply the retina, orbit and pa of the scalp.

This effectively shunts blood from the first pa of the subclan aery to the third pa of the axillary aery so that the upper limb will still receive blood. The connection between the suprascapular and circumflex scapular aeries is termed an open anastomosis because it is grossly visible, compared to the anastomosis with the dorsal scapular, which typically happens within small vessels. The anterior circumflex humeral aery supplies the deltoid muscle. It originates from the third pa of the axillary aery and anastomoses with the posterior circumflex humeral aery. The thoracodorsal aery is a branch of the subscapular aery that supplies latissimus dorsi.

Boundaries of the epiploic foramen: Anteriorly: right free margin of lesser omentum containing poal vein, hepatic aery and bile duct. Posteriorly: suprarenal gland, inferior vena cava and T12 veebra. Superiorly: caudate lobe of liver. Inferiorly: 1st pa of duodenum and hepatic aery. Ref: Cunningham's textbook of anatomy, By Daniel John Cunningham, Page 1239",

Thalamencephalon also called thalamic region is a complex structure comprising thalamus (in the wider sense of the term thalamus, i. e. dorsal thalamus, or thalamus proper, plus subthalamus, or ventral thalamus) and several adjacent structures: epithalamus and metathalamus. DEVELOPMENT: The cavity of the thalamencephalon opens behind into the cavity of the middle cerebral vesicle, and in front communicates with the hollow rudiments of the cerebral hemispheres, and eventually it becomes the cavity of the third ventricle. The floor of the thalamencephalon is ultimately developed into the optic chiasma, pa of the optic nerves, and the infundibulum. The latter comes in contact with a process from the mouth, uniting with which it ultimately forms the pituitary body. From the posterior pa of the roof of the thalamencephalon is developed the pineal gland. The anterior pa of the roof of the thalamencephalon becomes very thin, and its place is finally occupied by a thin membrane containing a vascular plexus, which persists in the roof of the third ventricle {choroidplexus). From the sides of the thalamencephalon, which become extremely thickened, are developed the optic thalami.",
