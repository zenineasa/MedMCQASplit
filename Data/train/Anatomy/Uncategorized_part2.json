The origin of the common iliac aery is at the bifurcation of the abdominal aoa, which occurs at the level of the fouh lumbar veebra in the midline of the abdomen. Both ureters are lateral to the aoic bifurcation. The origin of the internal iliac aery is at the bifurcation of the common iliac aery, which occurs at about the level of the first sacral veebra.

This abnormality originates during the embryonic period of lung development. It is classified as either extralobar or intralobar. Extralobar sequestration is a mass of pulmonary parenchyma anatomically separate from the normal lung, with a distinct pleural investment. Its blood supply is derived from the systemic circulation. The left side is involved in more than 90% of cases. Intralobar sequestration is an isolated segment of lung within the normal pleural investment that often receives blood from one or more aeries arising from the aoa or its branches. Intralobar sequestration is usually found within the lower lobes (98%), two-thirds are found on the left side. The diagnosis of intralobar sequestration may be established after repeated infections manifested by cough, fever, and consolidation in the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe.

Note that the pleural cavity, and possibly the lower pa of the inferior lobe of the lung, would be pierced before the spleen. The ascending colon is on the wrong side (the right) to be penetrated by a sharp instrument piercing the left side. Most of the duodenum is positioned too far to the right to be affected by this injury. Even the third pa of the duodenum, which runs from right to left, would still be out of harm's way. In addition, the duodenum lies at about levels L1 to L3, placing it too low to be injured in this case. The superior pole of the left kidney is bordered by the lower pa of the spleen.

The Levator Ani Muscles and the Perineal Body: They form a broad muscular sheet. They effectively suppo the pelvic viscera. The medial edges of the anterior pas of the levator ani muscles are attached to the cervix of the uterus by the pelvic fascia. Transverse cervical ligaments are fibromuscular condensations of pelvic fascia that pass to the cervix and the upper end of the vagina from the lateral walls of the pelvis. Pubocervical Ligaments: The pubocervical ligaments consist of two firm bands of connective tissue that pass to the cervix from the posterior surface of the pubis. They are positioned on either side of the neck of the bladder, to which they give some suppo (pubovesical ligaments). Sacrocervical Ligaments: The sacrocervical ligaments consist of two firm fibromuscular bands of pelvic fascia that pass to the cervix and the upper end of the vagina from the lower end of the sacrum. They form two ridges, one on either side of the rectouterine pouch (pouch of Douglas). The broad ligaments and the round ligaments of the uterus are lax structures, and the uterus can be pulled up or pushed down for a considerable distance before they become taut. Clinically, they are considered to play a minor role in suppoing the uterus. The round ligament of the uterus, which represents the remains of the lower half of the gubernaculum, helps keep the uterus anteveed (tilted forward) and anteflexed (bent forward) but is considerably stretched during pregnancy.",

Calcitriol (1, 25-DHCC) is the biologically active form of vitamin DCalcitriol/ 1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol/ 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. It is the hormonally active form of vitamin D with three hydroxyl groups (abbreted 1, 25-(OH)2. D3 or simply 1, 25 (OH)2D). It increases the level of calcium (Ca2+) in the blood by (1) increasing the uptake of calcium from the gut into the blood, (2) decreasing the transfer of calcium from blood to the urine by the kidney, and (3) increasing the release of calcium into the blood from bone. Calcitriol increases blood calcium levels () by promoting absorption of dietary calcium from the gastrointestinal tract and increasing renal tubular reabsorption of calcium thus reducing the loss of calcium in the urine. Calcitriol also stimulates release of calcium from bone by its action on the osteoblasts, causing them to release RANKL, which in turn activates osteoclasts. Calcitriol acts in conce with parathyroid hormone (PTH) in all three of these roles. For instance, PTH also stimulates osteoclasts. However, the main effect of PTH is to increase the rate at which the kidneys excrete inorganic phosphate (Pi), the counterion of Ca2+. The resulting decrease in serum phosphate causes Ca5 (PO4)30H to dissolve out of bone thus increasing serum calcium. PTH also stimulates the production of calcitriol. Many of the effects of calcitriol are mediated by its interaction with the calcitriol receptor, also called the vitamin D receptor or VDR. The maintenance of electroneutrality requires that the transpo of Ca2+ ions catalyzed by the intestinal epithelial cells be accompanied by counterions, primarily inorganic phosphate. Thus calcitriol also stimulates the intestinal absorption of phosphate. Calcitriol also inhibits the release of calcitonin, a hormone which reduces blood calcium primarily by inhibiting calcium release from bone. Calcitriol is produced in the cells of the proximal tubule of the nephron in the kidneys by the action of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase, a mitochondrial oxygenase and an enzyme which catalyzes the hydroxylation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (calcifediol). The activity of the enzyme is stimulated by PTH. The reaction is an impoant control point in Ca2+ homeostasis. The production of calcitriol is also increased by prolactin, a hormone which stimulates lactogenesis, a process which requires large amounts of calcium.",

The relative youthfulness of the patient often rules out prostatic enlargement, which characteristically occurs after the age of 50. As the stream becomes narrower, micturition is prolonged and is followed by postmicturition dribbling as a result of urine trickling from the dilated urethra proximal to the stricture. Urinary frequency by day and night is common and is due to incomplete bladder emptying, coexisting detrusor overactivity or urinary infection. If the stricture is tight enough, the patient will go into acute retention, although this is rare. If this happens, there is a danger that clumsy attempts to pass a urethral catheter will result in a false passage. If a patient has gone into retention because of a urethral stricture, its lumen will be too narrow to pass even a tiny catheter and suprapubic catheterisation is required. Investigation involves uroflowmetry, urethroscopy, urethrography and ultrasound scanning to assess bladder emptying and to detect any upper tract dilatation. The urinary flow rate is typically prolonged and plateau shaped while urethroscopy allows the stricture to be viewedas a circumferential scar. Openings of false passages commemorate previous misguided attempts to pass a urethral catheter. Urethrography using a water-soluble contrast medium will show the extent and severity of the stricture Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno: 1482",

C: 1, 25 hydroxy Vitamin D (Calcitriol) Calcitriol (1, 25-DHCC) is the biologically active form of vitamin D Calcitriol/ 1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol/ 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 It is the hormonally active form of vitamin D with three hydroxyl groups (abbreted 1, 25-(OH)2. D3 or simply 1, 25 (OH)2D). It increases the level of calcium (Ca2+) in the blood by (1) increasing the uptake of calcium from the gut into the blood, (2) decreasing the transfer of calcium from blood to the urine by the kidney, and (3) increasing the release of calcium into the blood from bone Calcitriol increases blood calcium levels () by promoting absorption of dietary calcium from the gastrointestinal tract and increasing renal tubular reabsorption of calcium thus reducing the loss of calcium in the urine. Calcitriol also stimulates release of calcium from bone by its action on the osteoblasts, causing them to release RANKL, which in turn activates osteoclasts. Calcitriol acts in conce with parathyroid hormone (PTH) in all three of these roles. For instance, PTH also stimulates osteoclasts. However, the main effect of PTH is to increase the rate at which the kidneys excrete inorganic phosphate (Pi), the counterion of Ca2+. The resulting decrease in serum phosphate causes Ca5 (PO4)30H to dissolve out of bone thus increasing serum calcium. PTH also stimulates the production of calcitriol. Many of the effects of calcitriol are mediated by its interaction with the calcitriol receptor, also called the vitamin D receptor or VDR. The maintenance of electroneutrality requires that the transpo of Ca2+ ions catalyzed by the intestinal epithelial cells be accompanied by counterions, primarily inorganic phosphate. Thus calcitriol also stimulates the intestinal absorption of phosphate. Calcitriol also inhibits the release of calcitonin, a hormone which reduces blood calcium primarily by inhibiting calcium release from bone. Calcitriol is produced in the cells of the proximal tubule of the nephron in the kidneys by the action of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase, a mitochondrial oxygenase and an enzyme which catalyzes the hydroxylation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (calcifediol). The activity of the enzyme is stimulated by PTH. The reaction is an impoant control point in Ca2+ homeostasis. The production of calcitriol is also increased by prolactin, a hormone which stimulates lactogenesis, a process which requires large amounts of calcium.",

(Sabiston-2110). Any other position of this ligament may indicate some degree of malrotation. On barium studies duodenojejunal flexure should thus lie to the left of upper lumbar spine at the level of pylorus (Gay 1209). Left sided colon occurs if the midgut loop has not rotated at all; mixed rotation results in the cecum lying inferior to the pylorusQ. (Grays-1209). So nonrotation is characterized by left sided large intestine & right sided small intestineQ; reversed rotation by duodenum lying anterior and transverse colon posterior to SMAQ. And mixed rotation by cecum lying just inferior to the pylorus of stomachQ.

Deficits: Lesion of nucleus ambiguus results in atrophy (lower motor neuron) and paralysis of innervated muscles, producing nasal speech, dysphagia, dysphonia, and detion of the uvula toward the opposite side (strong side). No affection of the Sternocleidomastoid or Trapezius. These muscles are innervated by cells in the rostral spinal cord (caudal poion C. N. XI).",

Small spaces appear in lateral plate mesoderm which later fuse to form intraembryonic coelom. This space divides the lateral plate mesoderm into: (i) an outer parietal layer (somatopleuric mesoderm) continous with mesoderm covering the amnion, and (ii) an inner visceral layer (splanchnopleuric mesoderm) continous with mesoderm covering the yolk sac.

Somatopleuric mesoderm forms the parietal layer of these cavities (i. e., parietal pericardium, perietal layer of pleura and parietal peritoneum) and splanchnopleuric mesoderm forms the visceral layer of these cavities. Paraxial mesoderm differentiates into somites. By the end of 20th day, the first pair of somites have formed in neck region. After this, about 3 pairs of somites are formed per day and by the end of 5th week about 42-44 somite pairs are formed (4-occipital, 8-cervical, 12-thoracic, 5-lumbar, 5-sacral and 8-10 cooccygeal).

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., 3-4 days Feilized ovum (zygote) reaches the uterus in morula stage, 4 days after feilization. Feilization and implantation Feilization refers to fusion of male and female gametes (i. e. spermatozoon and ovum). It takes place in the middle segment (ampulla) of fallopian tube. Before feilization, the ovum and sperms reach the ampulla for feilization. Fusion of spermatocyte and ovum leads to formation of zygote. First week of development begins immediately after feilization and includes:? Cleavage of zygote: Zygote (feilized ovum) stas dividing immediately and large zygote is subdivided into smaller daughter cells called blastomeres. Blastomeres are still surrounded by zona pellucida. Cleavage occurs in fallopian tube (uterine tube). Formation of morula: At about 16 cells stage the blastomeres tightly align by the process of compaction to form a compact ball of cells called morula (mulberry). This process of compaction leads to segregation of cells into two groups (i) inner cells (inner cell mass), and (ii) outer cells (outer cell mass). Morula enters uterine cavity 4 days after feilization. Formation of blastocyst: As the morula enters the uterine cavity, uterine fluid diffuses through zona pellucida and fills small intercellular gaps between blastomeres, and morula is conveed to blastocyst. Blastocyst consists of:? Zona pellucida: Outer covering. Embryoblast: A group of centerally located cells of inner cell mass and later give rise to tissues of embryo proper. Trophoblast: A thin outer layer of cells formed from outer cells mass and later give rise extraembryonic tissues. Blastocele: Cavity of blastocyst: The region of blastocyst containing embryoblast is known as embryonic pole and the opposite pole, the abembryonic pole. The trophoblasts overlying the embryoblast at embryonic pole is called polar trophoblast and that occupying the rest of wall called mural trophoblast. Between 5-6 days after feilization, blastocyst hatches from zona pellucida, and this naked blastocyst is ready for implantation. Implantation: About 6-7 days after feilization the blastocyst attaches to the endometrium, a process called as implantation or embedding. Normal site of implantation is posterior wall of the body of uterus close to fundus (at junction offundus with body).",

        "question": "Which passive movement causes pain in deep posterior compament syndrome?",
        "exp": "Dorsiflexion of foot Compament syndrome (CS) occurs whenever increased tissue pressure in a myofascial compament compromises blood flow to the muscles and nerves within that compament, resulting in tissue and nerve damage. The compaments of the lower leg and the volar forearm are paicularly prone to developing elevated compament pressures. Two types of CS have been identified, acute and chronic. Acute CS typically occurs subsequent to a traumatic event, most commonly fractures. Symptoms worsen acutely, and irreversible nerve injury and muscle necrosis occur within hours. Chronic CS (also known as chronic exeional CS, exeional CS, recurrent CS, or subacute CS) is a recurrent syndrome that occurs with exercise or work. Relevant Anatomy There are 4 osteofascial compaments of leg enclosed by the unyielding deep fascia and separated from each other by the bones of die leg and interosseeous membrane and by the anterior and posterior intermuscular septa. Each ofthe compaments is \"sealed\" spaces containing muscles, aeries, and nerves. Anterior or extensor compamento Dorsiflexor muscles of the ankle and foot. Tibialis anterior- Extensor digitorum longus- Extensor hallucis longus- Peroneus teiuso Anterior tibial aery - Commonly injured in lateral tibial plateau fractureso Deep peroneal nerve - Provides sensation to the first dorsal web space. Lateral compamento Peroneus (fibularis) brevis and peroneus (fibularis) longus - Plantar flexor and eveor muscles of the foot o Superficial peroneal nerve - Provides sensation to the dorsum of the foot. Deep posterior compamento Plantar flexor and phalangeal flexor muscles- Tibialis posterior- Flexor digitorum longus (FDL)- Flexor hallucis longus(and Popliteus, which acts on the, knee joint)o Posterior tibial and peroneal aerieso Posterior tibial nerve - Provides sensation to the sole of the foot. Superficial posterior compamento Plantar flexor muscles of the foot- Gastrocnemius- Plantaris- Soleuso Sural nerve. Acute compament syndromes are medical emergencies that may require immediate surgical treatment. Acute compament syndromes are usually the result of a traumatic incident. The swelling from the contusion causes the increased pressure in the compament. These injuries are most often seen in the emergency room and are not athletic injuries. Chronic CS is seen more often in the athletic community. Diagnosing this injury is one of exclusion. A complete examination should rule out medial tibial stress syndrome, stress fractures, and Achilles tendon injuries. The athlete presents with pain that is present during weight bearing training. Activities such as running, stair climbing, and jumping are the most common offenders. There will be pain on passive stretch of the muscles of the compament. So in the: Deep posterior compament syndrome- there will be pain on passive dorsiflexion of the foot and on toeextension (since muscles in the deep post compament are plantar flexors and phalangeal flexors ). Anterior compament syndrome- there will be pain on passive plantar flexion of the foot and toe flexion. Lateral compament syndrome- there will be pain on passive foot inversion. Superficial posterior compament syndrome- pain is on passive dorsiflexion of foot. Definitive diagnosis of a chronic CS can be made with an intracompamental pressure test. A catheter is inseed into the offending compament to measure its pressure. Once the diagnosis is confirmed with a positive compament measurement, a treatment course is to be chosen. Conservative treatment is the first option. Rehabilitation should include: low impact cross training, flexibility training, appropriate strength training for weakened muscles, and/or the use of ohotics to correct biomechanical abnormalities. If conservative treatment fails, surgical intervention in the next step. Afasciotomy is the procedure of choice.",

Posterior - tibial nerve. 3. Lateral- biceps femoris, plantaris, lateral head of gastrocnemius and lateral condyle of femur. 4. Medial-semimembranosus, medial condyle of femur. Branches:- 1. Muscular- adductor Magnus, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, soleus, plantaris. 2. Cutaneous 3. Genicular- superior, middle and inferior. Middle -pierces oblique popliteal ligament. Supplies cruciate ligament and synovial membrane of knee joint. BP of lower limb measured from popliteal artery. In coarctation of aorta, popliteal pressure < brachial pressure. Popliteal artery is fixed to capsule of knee joint by a fibrous band present just above the femoral condyles. This may be a source of continuous traction or stretching in the artery, causing primary thrombosis of artery. More prone to aneurysm. Dorsalis pedis- can be easily at proximal end of first intermetatarsal space. i. e. between the tendons of EHL and first tendon of EDL.

By definition, a pseudounipolar neuron has one axon with two branches: central and peripheral. These axonal branches should not be confused with dendrites. Pseudounipolar neurons do not have dendrites. Each axon has a peripheral branch (from the cell body to the periphery: skin, joint and muscle) and a central branch (from the cell body to spinal cord). The soma (cell body) of each pseudounipolar neuron is located within a dorsal root ganglion. The axon leaves the cell body (and out of the dorsal root ganglion) into the dorsal root, where it splits into two branches. The central branch goes to the posterior (dorsal) horn of the spinal cord, where it forms synapses with other neurons.

During physical examination it was found that she could not initiate abduction of her arm, but if her arm was elevated to 45 degrees from the veical (at her side) position, she had no trouble fully abducting it. Injury to which muscle was responsible?",
        "exp": "Supraspinatus is responsible for initiating abduction of the arm, while deltoid is responsible for continuing abduction of the arm past the first 15 or 20 degrees. Since this patient can abduct her arm when it is lifted to 45 degrees, deltoid seems to be intact. But, she can't initiate the motion, so you know that she has probably injured supraspinatus. Infraspinatus rotates the arm laterally, and teres major rotates the arm medially. Trapezius elevates and depresses the scapula.

The iliohypogastric nerve innervates the abdominal wall. It runs between the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles, then pierces the internal oblique at the anterior superior iliac spine to run between the internal and external obliques. The ovarian aery and vein are branches from the descending aoa and inferior vena cava which supply the ovary in the pelvis.

Although the pectineal ligament helps define the boundaries of the inguinal canal, you can't really say that the pectineal ligament traverses the canal.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Right side Testis. Testis is the male gonad. It is suspended in the scrotum by spermatic cord. Left testis is slightly (1 cm) lower than the right one. The average testicular dimensions are 5 cm (length), 25 cm (breath), 3cm (anteroposterior diameter or thickness) and 10. 5-14 gms (weight). The epididymis is attached to is posterolateral surface. Vas (ductus) deference arises from lower pole of epididymis. Lateral pa of epididymis is separated from testis by an extension of cavity of tunica vaginalis, called sinus of epididymis. There is small oval body attached to upper pole of testis called appendix of testis, a remnant of paramesonephric duct. Testis is covered by three coats (from outside to inside):- (i) tunica vaginalis (which has a parietal and a visceral layer); (ii) tunica albuginea; and (iii) tunica vasculosa. Outside these three coats, there are layers of scrotum. Structure. Testis consists of 200-300 lobules. Each lobules consists of 2-3 seminiferous tubules (where spermatozoa are formed). Seminiferous tubules join at the apex of lobules to form straight tubules, which anastomose with each other to form rete testis. Which emerge from upper pole and enter the epididymis. Each tubule becomes highly coiled to form a lobe of the head of epididymis. All tubules end in a single duct which is coiled on itself to form the body and tail of the epididymis. It is continuous with ductus deference. Aerial supply. Testes are supplied by testticular aery, a branch of abdominal aoa, arises at L2 veebral level. Venous drainage. The veins emerging from the testis and epididymis form the pampiniform plexus. Anterior pa of the plexus is arranged around the testicular aery, middle pa around ductus deferens and its aery, and posterior pa is isolated. The plexus condenses into 4 veins at the superficial inguinal ring and 2 veins at the deep inguinal ring. Ultimately, one vein is formed which drains into inferior vena cava on the right and into left renal vein on the left side. Lymphatic drainage. Lymphatics from the testis run back with the testicular aery to para-aoic nodes along side the aoa at the level of origin of testicular aeries (L2 veebra).",

By definition of being hormones, they are secreted into the circulation for systemic effect, but they can also have a role of neurotransmitter or other roles as autocrine (self) or paracrine (local) messenger. The hypothalamus produces the hypophysiotropic and neurohypophysial hormones in specialized hypothalamic neurons which extend to the median eminence and posterior pituitary. The adrenal medulla produces adrenomedullary hormones in chromaffin cells, cells which are very similar in structure to post-synaptic sympathetic neurons, even though they are not neurons they are derivatives of the neural crest. Enterochromaffin and enterochromaffin-like cells, both being enteroendocrine cells, are also considered neuroendocrine cells due to their structural and functional similarity to chromaffin cells, although they are not derivatives of the neural crest.",

        "exp": "The neural plate, a thickened area of ectoderm, gives rise to the nervous system. The first step is the development of a groove in the neural plate. On either side of this groove are the raised neural folds. These neural folds then begin to fuse in the midline at approximately the midpoint of the neural plate. Fusion proceeds in a rostral and caudal direction; once completed, there still remains an open area of the \"tube\" at both the rostral and caudal ends. These openings are referred to as the rostral and the caudal neuropore. The rostral neuropore closes around day 26 and the caudal neuropore closes on approximately day 28. With the closure of the caudal neuropore, closure of the neural tube is completed. It has been convincingly shown that folic acid plays an impoant role in the closure of the neural tube. By giving women of childbearing age folic acid supplements, the rate of neural tube defects can be reduced dramatically. Yet, based on the embryology of the neural tube (with closure of the tube roughly by day 28), it is obvious that in order for folic acid supplementation to work, it should be staed pregestationally. Unfounately, most women do not seek prenatal care until after the neural tube has undergone its period of closure. Bone, muscle, and spleen are all derivatives of the mesoderm. This mesoderm is formed at the end of the second week post-feilization, when some cells of the primitive streak migrate laterally between the endodermal and the ectodermal layer. Germ cells are derived from the endodermal layer of the trilaminar embryo. They migrate as primordial sex cells from the endoderm of the yolk sac to the urogenital ridge.",
