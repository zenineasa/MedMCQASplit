It is suspended from tuber cinereum of hypothalamus by infundibulum (pituitary stalk). It is related anterosuperiorly to optic chiasma, laterally to cavernous sinus and inferiorly to sphenoid air sinuses in the body of sphenoid. Pituitary gland is oval in shape, measures 8 12 mm, and weighs about 500 mg. Pituitary gland has two main subdivisions:- (i) Adenohypophysis (anterior lobe), and (ii) Neurohypophysis (posterior lobe). Adenohypophysis (anterior lobe) include (i) pars anterior or pars distalis or pars glandularis or anterior lobe proper, (ii) pars intermedia (intermediate lobe); and (iii) tuberal lobe (pars tuberalis). It develops from an upward growth (Rathke's pouch) from the ectodermal roof of stomodeum. Neurohypophysis (posterior lobe) include (i) pars posterior or pars nervosa or neural lobe or posterior lobe proper; (ii) infundibulum (infundibular stem); and (iii) median eminence. It develops from a downgrowth from the 3rd ventricle/diencephalon (neuroectoderm) called infundibulum. Anterior lobe contains many hormone secreting cells: chromophils (acidophils, basophils), chromophobes and follicullostellate cells. Posterior pituitary contain neuroglia like pituicytes which do not secrete any hormone.

Her shoulder shows a normal passive range of motion. When asked to hold her arms abducted to 90 degrees, she is unable to do so on the right. There is no motor weakness in her forearm or hand.

This causes excessive traction or even tearing of C5 and C6 roots of the plexus. It occurs in infants during a difficult delivery or in adults after a blow to or fall on the shoulder.The suprascapular nerve, the nerve to the subclavius, and the musculocutaneous and axillary nerves all possess nerve fibers derived from C5 and C6 roots and will therefore be functionless.The following muscles will consequently be paralyzed: the supraspinatus (abductor of the shoulder) and infraspinatus (lateral rotator of the shoulder); the subclavius (depresses the clavicle); the biceps brachii (supinator of the forearm, flexor of the elbow, weak flexor of the shoulder) and the greater pa of the brachialis (flexor of the elbow) and the coracobrachialis (flexes the shoulder); and the deltoid (abductor of the shoulder) and the teres minor (lateral rotator of the shoulder).Thus, the limb will hang limply by the side, medially rotated by the unopposed sternocostal pa of the pectoralis major; the forearm will be pronated because of loss of the action of the biceps.The position of the upper limb in this condition has been likened to that of a poer or waiter hinting for a tip. In addition, there will be a loss of sensation down the lateral side of the arm.TreatmentThe three most common treatments from Erb's Palsy are: Nerve transfers (usually from the opposite leg), sub scapularis releases and latissimus dorsi tendon transfers.",

More than 1.2 million new cancer cases are diagnosed each year. Approximately 50% of these tumours can spread (metastasize) to the skeleton. With improved medical treatment of many cancers --especially breast. lung, and prostate -- patients are living longer. However, the primary cancers in more of these patients are spreading to bone. The tumours that result are called bone metastases. Organs involved in MBD * The most common cancers that arise from organs and spread to bone include: * Breast * Lung * Thyroid * Kidney * Prostate Pathophysiology of MBD : MBD causes pain in the area of spread. damages and weakens bone, and puts the patient at a greater risk for broken bones. It can make it hard to paicipate in daily activities. The biggest concern for patients with MBD is the general loss in quality of life. How much of an effect MBD has on a patient will vary and is associated with how much the cancer has spread. which bones are affected, and how severe the bone damage is. There are a range of treatment options, however. that can help patients manage pain and maintain their independence and activity levels. After the lung and the liver, the skeleton is the most common site of spread of cancers that begin in organs. Metastases to the lung and liver are often not detected until late in the course of disease because patients experience no symptoms. In contrast. bone metastases are generally painful when they occur. Cancer most commonly spreads to these sites in the skeleton: Spine Pelvis Ribs Skull Upper arm Symptoms Pain. The most common symptom of MBD is pain. Patients may have pain in the spine, pelvis, or extremities because the bone has been weakened by the tumour. Fractures. Weakened bones break more easily. A fracture from a minor injury is another possible sign of MBD. Anaemia. The most common sites of spread -- spine, pelvis, ribs, skull, upper arm, and long bones of the leg --correspond to areas of bone marrow that produce high levels of red blood cells, the cells responsible for carrying oxygen to tissues in the body. Anaemia (decreased red blood cell production) is a common blood abnormality in patients with MBD. A cancer patient who experiences any pain, especially in the back, legs, and arms, should notify his or her doctor immediately. Pain that occurs without activity (i.e., walking or lifting an object) is paicularly concerning. Refer Apleys 9th/e p 216",

All arising from the la pharyngeal arch. The lateral tongue buds rapidly increase in size, merge with each other, and overgrow the median tongue bud. The merged distal tongue buds form the anterior 2/3rd of the tongue. The median tongue bud forms no recognizable pa of the adult tongue. Since the mucosa covering the ant. 2/3rd of the tongue originates from the first pharyngeal arch; sensory innervation to this area is by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. (Taste sensation to the anterior 2/3rd of the tongue is provided by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve).Post 1/3\" or root of the tongue: is formed from two median elevations;- The copula arising from the 2\"d pair of branchial arches, just caudal to the foramen ceacum.- The hypopharyngeal or hypobranchial eminence developing caudal to the copula from the 3rd and dh pair of arches.As the tongue develops the copula is gradually overgrown by the hypopharyngeal eminence and disappears. As a result, the post pa of the tongue develops from the hypopharyngeal eminence( the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal arches) . Thus the sensory nerve supply to this pa of tongue is from the glossopharyngeal nerve.(taste sensation is also carried by the glossopharyngeal nerve).Pharyngeal arch mesenchyme forms the connective tissue and vasculature of the tongue. Some of the tongue muscles probably develop in situ from mesenchyme, but most develop from myoblasts that migrate from the occipital myotomes. The hypoglossal nerve accompanies the myoblasts during their migration and innervates the tongue muscles.The Nerve Supply of the Tonguea. Motor nerve- All the intrinsic & extrinsic muscles, except the palatoglossus, are supplied by the hypoglossal nerve. The palatoglossus is supplied by the cranial pa of the accessory nerve through the pharyngeal plexus.b. Sensory nerves:- Anterior 2/3 of tongue - The lingual nerve is the nerve of general sensation and the chorda tympani is the nerve of taste for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.- Posterior 1/3 of tongue - The glossopharyngeal nerve is the nerve for both general sensation and taste for the posterior 1/3 of the tongue.- The posterior-most pa of the tongue is supplied by the vagus nerve through the internal laryngeal branch.

The long thoracic nerve contains contributions from C5, 6, and 7, so remember the saying \"C5, 6, and 7 keep the wings from heaven.\"",

It has multiple cytoplasmmic processes and myelinate several axons at the same time.Must know: Peripheral nerves are myelinated from the schwann cells. Loss of myelin, known as demyelination, results in disturbance of the ability to transmit a nerve impulse through the demyelinated segment and this has serious consequences for function. Damage to one oligodendrocyte, therefore, can result in loss of myelin from many axons, whereas damage to a Schwann cell only results in loss of myelin from a single axon.

Deep peroneal nerve supply muscles of anterior compament of leg which include tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, peroneus teius and extensor hallucis longus whereas superficial peroneal nerve supply muscles of lateral compament of the leg i.e peroneus longus and peroneus brevis. In the common peroneal nerve injury the muscles of the anterior and lateral compament of the leg get paralysed results in weakness of dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot. As there is weakness of the dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot, the opposite muscles, the plantar flexion of the ankle joint and inversion of subtalar and transverse tarsal joint, cause the foot to be plantar flexed. So the planter flexion and inversion are normal. The patient has a high stepping gait. All the reflexes are intact (ankle jerk is lost in sciatic nerve lesions) Sensory loss is present over anterior and lateral side of the leg, dorsum of the foot and toes including medial side of the big toe.

Around the glomerulus, the tubules form Bowman's capsule, and together these structures constitute a renal corpuscle. Laterally, the tubule enters the longitudinal collecting duct known as the mesonephric or wolffian duct Ref: Langman's embryology 11th edition Chapter 15.",

This effectively shunts blood from the first pa of the subclan aery to the third pa of the axillary aery so that the upper limb will still receive blood. The connection between the suprascapular and circumflex scapular aeries is termed an open anastomosis because it is grossly visible, compared to the anastomosis with the dorsal scapular, which typically happens within small vessels. The anterior circumflex humeral aery supplies the deltoid muscle. It originates from the third pa of the axillary aery and anastomoses with the posterior circumflex humeral aery. The thoracodorsal aery is a branch of the subscapular aery that supplies latissimus dorsi.

Schawann cells form a sheath around the axon and form the outermost layer of a nerve fiber, called neurilemma, also known as sheath of Schwann or neurolemma. Schwann cells is surrounded by a basal lamina (or external lamina).In some fibres, Schwann cells additionally form myelin sheath; these fibres are called myelinated nerve fibres. Those nerve fibres in which myelin sheath is not formed, that is Schwann cells only provide structural suppo, are non-myelinated nerve fibres.Schwann cells deposit concentric layers of myelin around the axon to form myelin sheath. In myelinated fibres, one Schwann cell covers only a sho segment of the axon. The small pa of the axon present in between two adjacent Schwann cells (the pa that is devoid of myelin sheath) is called node of Ranvier.Myelin is a mixture of lipoproteins and acts as an insulator. Since myelin acts as an insulator, impulses are generated only at the nodes of Ranvier and this helps in faster conduction of the impulses. This is called saltatory conduction.Schwann cells are derived from neuroectoderm.",

This abnormality originates during the embryonic period of lung development. It is classified as either extralobar or intralobar. Extralobar sequestration is a mass of pulmonary parenchyma anatomically separate from the normal lung, with a distinct pleural investment. Its blood supply is derived from the systemic circulation. The left side is involved in more than 90% of cases. Intralobar sequestration is an isolated segment of lung within the normal pleural investment that often receives blood from one or more aeries arising from the aoa or its branches. Intralobar sequestration is usually found within the lower lobes (98%), two-thirds are found on the left side. The diagnosis of intralobar sequestration may be established after repeated infections manifested by cough, fever, and consolidation in the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe.

One lesion, between the 9th and 10th ribs along the left posterior axillary line, penetrated to a depth of about 5 cm. Which of the following organs would be the first one pierced by the sharp object that caused this injury?",
        "exp": "The spleen follows the long axes of ribs 9 to 11 and lies mostly posterior to the stomach, above the colon, and paly anterior to the kidney. Therefore, it is the most likely organ of the group to be pierced by a sharp object penetrating just above rib 10 at the posterior axillary line. Note that the pleural cavity, and possibly the lower pa of the inferior lobe of the lung, would be pierced before the spleen.The ascending colon is on the wrong side (the right) to be penetrated by a sharp instrument piercing the left side. Most of the duodenum is positioned too far to the right to be affected by this injury. Even the third pa of the duodenum, which runs from right to left, would still be out of harm's way. In addition, the duodenum lies at about levels L1 to L3, placing it too low to be injured in this case. The superior pole of the left kidney is bordered by the lower pa of the spleen. However, it is crossed by rib 12 and usually does not extend above rib 11. It would probably be too low and medial to be injured in this case, since this penetration is at the posterior axillary line.",
