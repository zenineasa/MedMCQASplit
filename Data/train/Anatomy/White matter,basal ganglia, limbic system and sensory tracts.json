        "question": "A 55-year-old right-handed veteran received a small shrapnel wound in the head. Within 1 year of receiving his wound, the man complained of seizures and was treated with seizure medication. The medication was not effective, and a section of the anterior corpus callosum was performed successfully. Which of the following neurologic deficits is most likely?",
        "exp": "Transection of corpus callosum results in the inability, when blindfolded, to identify verbally an object held in the left hand (dysnomia). The left hemisphere is dominant for language and naming objects. Alexia is found in lesions of the inferior parietal lobule. Gait dystaxia may result from normal pressure hydrocephalus, which also involves dementia and incontinence. Transection of callosal fibers adjacent to the left premotor coex produces right hemiparesis, motor (Broca) dysphasia, and sympathetic dyspraxia of the left non-paralyzed arm.",
