The mother becomes alarmed when her baby begins to have a difficulty in breathing and she rings for help. You arrive at the bedside and observe that the baby is in severe respiratory distress. A quick physical examination reveals that the baby has a barrel-shaped chest, a scaphoid-shaped abdomen, and absence of breath sounds on the left side. A chest radiograph reveals air/fluid containing bowel in the left-side hemithorax, no visible aerated lung on the left side, contralateral displacement of the heart and other mediastinal structures, compression of the contralateral lung, and reduced size of the abdomen. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
