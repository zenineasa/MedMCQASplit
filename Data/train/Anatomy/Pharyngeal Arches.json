Branchial (Pharyngeal) pouch derivatives include: First pouch derivatives--middle ear cavity, Eustachian tube, mastoid air cells. Second pouch derivatives--epithelial lining of palatine tonsil. Third pouch (dorsal wings)--inferior parathyroids. Third pouch (ventral wings)--thymus. Fourth pouch derivatives--superior parathyroids. Also remember: Branchial/ pharyngeal apparatus: Consist of1. Branchial clefts (derived from ectoderm)2. Branchial arches (derived from mesoderm and neural crests)3. Branchial pouches (derived from endoderm). BRANCHIAL ARCHESFirst arch derivatives# Meckel's cartilage: Mandible, malleus, incus, sphenomandibular ligament.# Muscles: Muscles of mastication (temporalis, masseter, lateral and medial pterygoids), Tensor Tympani, Tensor veli Palatini, Mylohyoid, Anterior-belly of digastric.# Nerve of first arch: Mandibular nerve (post-trematic) and chorda tympani (pretrematic). Second arch derivatives# Reichert's cartilage: Stapes, Styloid, Smaller (lesser) horn & superior half of hyoid, Stylohyoid ligament (Hint--4'S').# Muscles: muscles of facial expression, Stapedius, Stylohyoid, posterior belly of digastric. Third arch derivatives# Cartilage. Greater horn of hyoid, lower half of hyoid.# Muscle: Stylopharyngeus# Nerve of third arch: Glossopharyngeal nerve. Fourth arch derivatives# Cartilages: thyroid, cricoid, arvtenoids, corniculate, cuneiform.# Muscles: Most pharyngeal constrictors, circothyroid, and levator veli palatini.# Nerve of Fourth arch: Superior laryngeal branch of vagus nerve.

Sixth arch derivatives# Muscles: all intrinsic muscles of larynx except cricothyroid.# Nerve of sixth arch: Recurrent laryngeal branch of vagus nerve. BRANCHIAL CLEFT DERIVATIVES# First cleft develops into external auditory meatus# Second to Fourth clefts form temporary cervical sinuses, which are obliterated by proliferation of second arch mesenchyme.# Persistent cervical sinus can lead to a branchial cyst in the neck.
