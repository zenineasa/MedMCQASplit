        "exp": "ANSWER: (C) Forward on femurREF: Snell's 8th ed ch:10Anterior Cruciate Ligament: The anterior cruciate ligament is attached to the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia and passes upward, backward, and laterally, to be attached to the posterior part of the medial surface of the lateral femoral condyle. The anterior cruciate ligament prevents posterior displacement of the femur on the tibia. With the knee joint flexed, the anterior cruciate ligament prevents the tibia from being pulled anteriorly.Posterior Cruciate Ligament: The posterior cruciate ligament is attached to the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia and passes upward, forward, and medially to be attached to the anterior part of the lateral surface of the medial femoral condyle. The posterior cruciate ligament prevents anterior displacement of the femur on the tibia. With the knee joint flexed, the posterior cruciate ligament prevents the tibia from being pulled posteriorly.Injury to the cruciate ligaments can occur when excessive force is applied to the knee joint.Tears of the anterior cruciate ligament are common : Examination of patients with a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament showrs that the tibia can be pulled excessively forward on the femurTears of the posterior cruciate ligament are rare. With rupture of the posterior cruciate ligament, the tibia can be made to move excessively backward on the femur",

        "question": "Which of the following is true about posterior cruciate ligament:",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e. Prevents posterior dislocation of tibia The cruciate ligaments are two thick & strong intracapsular ligaments that cross each other within the joint cavity (cruciate means shaped like a cross). They are named anterior and posterior according to their tibial attachments. These ligaments are the main bond between femur and tibia and maintain the anteroposterior stability of knee joint.Anterior cruciate ligamentACL is attached to the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia and passes backward, and laterally to be attached to the posterior part of the medial surface of the lateral femoral condyle.ACL is taut during extension of kneeACL prevents posterior displacement of the femur on the tibia. When the knee joint is flexed, it prevents anterior displacement of tibia.Posterior cruciate ligamentPCL is attached to the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia and passes forwards and medially to be attached to the anterior part of the lateral surface of the medial femoral condyle.It is taut during flexion of the kneeThe PCL prevents anterior displacement of the femur on the tibia and when the knee joint is flexed it prevents post, displacement of the tibia.Both the cruciate ligaments are intracapsular but extrasynovial.the synovial membrane of the knee joint lines the knee capsule, except posteriorly where it is reflected forward around the front of the cruciate ligaments, forming a common covering for both the ligaments. Thus the cruciate ligaments lie behind the synovial cavity and are not bathed in synovial fluid.",
