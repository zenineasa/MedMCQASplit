Blood loss in excess of 10-20 mL of red cells per day is greater than the amount of iron that the gut can absorb from a normal diet. Under these circumstances, the iron deficit must be made up by mobilization of iron from RE storage sites. During this period, iron stores--reflected by the serum ferritin level or the appearance of stain- able iron on bone marrow aspirations--decrease. As long as iron stores are present and can be mobilized, the serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and red cell protoporphyrin levels remain within nor- mal limits.

It may also mediate the attachment of hematopoietic stem cellsto bone marrow extracellular matrix or directly to stromal cells. The CD34 protein is a member of a family of single-pass transmembrane sialomucin proteins that show expression on early hematopoietic and vascular-associated tissue. However, little is known about its exact function. CD34 is also an impoant adhesion molecule and is required for T cells to enter lymph nodes. It is expressed on lymph node endothelia, whereas the L-selectin to which it binds is on the T cell. Conversely, under other circumstances CD34 has been shown to act as molecular \"Teflon\" and block mast cell, eosinophil and dendritic cell precursor adhesion, and to facilitate opening of vascular lumina. Finally, recent data suggest CD34 may also play a more selective role in chemokine-dependent migration of eosinophils and dendritic cell precursors.

Because the synthesis of RNA and cytoplasmic elements proceeds at a normal rate and thus outpaces that of the nucleus, the hematopoietic precursors show nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony. This maturational derangement contributes to the anemia in several ways. Many megaloblasts are so defective in DNA synthesis that they undergo apoptosis in the marrow (inef- fective hematopoiesis). Others mature into red cells but do so after fewer cell divisions, fuher diminishing the output of red cells.

Edit There are several types of benign liver tumor. Hemangiomas: These are the most common type of benign liver tumor, found in up to 7% of autopsy specimens. They sta in blood vessels. Most of these tumors do not cause symptoms and do not need treatment. Some may bleed and need to be removed if it is mild to severe. A rare tumor is Infantile hemangioendothelioma. Hepatic adenomas: These benign epithelial liver tumors develop in the liver and are also an uncommon occurrence, found mainly in women using estrogens as contraceptives, or in cases of steroid abuse. They are, in most cases, located in the right hepatic lobe and are frequently seen as solitary. The size of adenomas range from 1 to 30 cm. Symptoms associated with hepatic adenomas are all associate with large lesions which can cause intense abdominal pain. Over the last few decades there has been an increase with occurrences of this specific type of adenoma. The prognosis for these tumors has still not been mastered. Some correlations have been made such as malignant transformation, spontaneous hemorrhage, and rupture. Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is the second most common tumor of the liver. This tumor is the result of a congenital aeriovenous malformation hepatocyteresponse.

Mutation in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein renders enterocytes unable to expo lipo- proteins and free fatty acids. As a result, monoglycerides and triglycerides accumulate within the epithelial cells. Lipid vacuoles in small intestinal epithelial cells are evident by light microscopy and can be highlighted by special stains, such as oil red O, paicularly after a fatty meal. Abetalipoproteinemia manifests in infancy, and the clinical picture is dominated by failure to thrive, diarrhea, and steatorrhea.
