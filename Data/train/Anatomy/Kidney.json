About 20-50%of patients may experience warning headaches preceding the index episode of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured ICA. Other vascular abnormalities in ADPKD patients include diffuse aerial dolichoectasias of the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation which can predispose to aerial dissection and stroke. mitral valve prolapse occurs up to 30% of patients with ADPKD and tricuspid valve prolapse is less common. The prevalence of abdominal wall hernias and colonic diveicula are also increased. Ref: Harrison 20 th edition pg no 2153",
