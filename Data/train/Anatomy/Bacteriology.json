The SAT does not differentiate between immunoglobulin isotypes. As the disease progresses IgM levels decline and avidity and subclass distribution of IgG and IgA change. Thus SAT becomes negative in chronic brucellosis. The complement fixation test is more useful in chronic cases as it detects the IgG antibody also. ELISA is sensitive and specific and detects IgM and IgG antibodies separately. It is therefore useful for differentiation between acute and chronic infection.
