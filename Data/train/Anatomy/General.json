        "question": "Chromosome in which centromere is close to one end which result in short arm being very short is which type of chromosome?",
        "exp": "Ans. d (Acrocentric). (Ref. Cell & Molecular Biology by De. Robertis, 7th /pg. 348)CHROMOSOMES# The entire genetic information contained in the genes is packaged in the chromosomes. All the somatic cells of an individual organism contain the same number of chromosomes.# Genes are arranged linearly on the chromosomes and their positions on the normal chromosome in relation to other genes on same chromosome are fixed. This position is called locus.# Genes occupying the same locus on a pair of chromosomes are called alleles. Structure of chromosomes:# Chromosomes are long structures with a constriction at point along its length-called centromere.# The ends of the chromosomes are called telomeres. These give stability to the chromosome. In the absence of telomeres, chromosomes become unstable and tend to break until joined to a telomere. An enzyme telomerase maintains the length of the telomeric sequences. Cell aging is controlled by telomerase enzyme. (AI 2003)# It has the structure for the attachment of chromosome to the spindle fibers called the Kinetochore. Depending on the location of the centromere on the chromosome, they are classified as: Type of chromosome. Comments1. Metacentric. The centromere is in the centre of the chromosome so that the chromosome has two equal arms. 2. Sub-metacentric. Centromeres are away from the center so that the arms are unequal in size (one arm shorter than other). 3. Telocentric. Centromere is at the extreme end of replicating chromosome, so that chromosome consists of only one arm. 4. Acrocentric. Centromere is almost at the tip (one end) of the chromosome, so that one arm is much longer than other. BANDING TECHNIQUES# Techniques using dyes such as quinacrine, or giemsa after trypsin or heat treatment are called banding techniques. The banding pattern is specific for each chromosome, and seen in both members of a pair.# Bands seen with quinacrine, a fluorescent dye, are called Q-bands.# Banding seen with giemsa stain is called G-banding (The most extensively used technique)# Mitotic cells are essential for chromosome studies. In human body, mitosis occurs in:- Bone marrow, Intestinal mucosa, Skin and Gonads.# However, biopsies are difficult to obtain and sufficient number of dividing cells are not available.# The blood lymphocytes can be stimulated to divide in culture (appropriate medium) and easy to obtain.# Small skin biopsies can be obtained and the fibroblasts grown in culture.# Lymphocyte culture: Treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes with substances such as Phytohemagluttinin (PHA) or Concanavalin A (Con A) stimulates the T lymphocytes to transform into lymphoblasts and undergo 3-4 rounds of mitotic divisions.# Sources of human cells for cytogenetic studies (analysis of human karyotypes) are:- Fibroblasts- Amniotic cells- Cells of chorionic villi. For detailed studies on the human chromosome mitotic cells are arrested in metaphase. The metaphase chromosomes are in a highly condensed state.",

REF: Color Atlas of Cytology, Histology, and Microscopic Anatomy by Wolfgang Kuhn p: 280A serous demilune is a cap in the shape of a half-moon (hence the name \"demilune\") on some salivary glands. Serous demilunes are the serous cells at the distal end of mucous tubuloalveolar secretory unit of certain salivary glands (submandibular and sublingual). These demilune cells secrete the proteins that contain the enzyme lysozyme, which degrades the cell walls of bacteria. In this way, lysozyme confers antimicrobial activity to mucus. The serous demilune is an artifact from traditional methods of preparing samples. Samples are traditionally preserved and fixed in formaldehyde. When samples were preserved by quick-freezing in liquid nitrogen and then fixed with osmium tetraoxide in acetone, no demilunes are found. Examination showed that the serous cells and mucosal cells were aligned in the acinus. The traditional preparation caused mucous cells to swell during fixation which results in the serous cells being popped out of their alignment. After sectioning the serous cells resembled the common demilune shape, and were so named. When the gland has this demilunar structure, it produces both serous and mucous secretions, and is thus classified as \"mixed\"",

Long cortical branches traverse the cortex and penetrate the subjacent white matter for 3 or 4 cm without communicating. Short cortical branches are confined to the cerebral cortex, and form a compact network in the middle zone of the grey matter. Although adjacent vessels anastomose on the surface of the brain, they become end arteries as soon as they enter it. Superficial anastomoses only occur between microscopic branches of the cerebral arteries, and there is little evidence that they can provide an effective alternative circulation after the occlusion of larger vessels.
