Bowman's membrane: - It is not a true membrane but simply a condensed superficial part of stroma. Once destroyed, it does not regenerateQ. Stroma (Substantia propria): - This layer constitutes most of the cornea (90% of thickness). It consists of collagen fibrils (lamellae) embedded in hydrated matrix of proteoglycans. Descemet's membrane: - This layer bounds the stroma posteriorly. In the periphery it appears to end at the anterior limit of trabecular meshwork as Schwableys ring. Endothelium: - It is a single layer of flat polygnonal cells. The endothelial cells contain 'active-pump' mechanism and is the most important layer in maintaining the transparency of corneaQ.",

Explanation: Sebaceous glands develop as buds from the sides of developing epithelial root sheaths of hair follicles. The glandular buds grow into the surrounding connective tissue and branch to form the primordia of several alveoli and their associated ducts. The central cells of the alveoli break down, forming an oily secretion (sebum), which is released into the hair follicle and passes to the surface of the skin, where it mixes with desquamated peridermal cells to form vernix caseosa. Sebaceous glands independent of hair follicles (e. g., in the glans penis and labia minora) develop in a similar manner to buds from the epidermis. Note: Upper respiratory tract is lined with ciliated pseudo stratified columnar epithelium. Ureter does NOT contain abundant goblet cells. Abundant goblet cells are features of large intestine. Epithelium is NOT surrounded by single layered membrane. Epithelial cells have strong adhesion molecules, membrane interdigitations and intercellular junctions. These features allow the cells to form cellular sheets that cover the surface of the body and line its cavities. Epithelial cells are separated from the connective tissue by a sheet of extracellular material called the basal lamina. Types of Epithelium. Type of Epithelium. Subtypes.

        "question": "Epithelium lining of lingual surface of epiglottis is?",
        "exp": "ANSWER: (D) Stratified squamous epithelium. REF: Basic Histology by Lange 11th edition Chapter 17 '\"The Respiratory System\"See APPENDIX-10 below for \"SOME IMPORTANT EPITHELIUM LININGS\". The epiglottis is a flap valve that covers the laryngeal airway during swallowing. Thus the epithelium facing the oral cavity is oral epithelium, while the epithelium on the surface facing the airway is respiratory. The entire lingual surface and the apical portion of the laryngeal surface are covered with stratified squamous epithelium. Toward the base of the epiglottis on the laryngeal surface, the epithelium undergoes a transition into ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. APPENDIX- 10. Common Types of Covering Epithelia in Human Body. Type. Cell Form. Examples of distribution. Main Function. Simple. Squamous. Lining of ves sels (endothelium). Serous lining of cavities; pericardium, pleura, peritoneum (mesothelium).
