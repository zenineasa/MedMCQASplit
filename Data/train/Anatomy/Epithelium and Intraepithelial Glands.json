Bowman's membrane: - It is not a true membrane but simply a condensed superficial part of stroma. Once destroyed, it does not regenerateQ. Stroma (Substantia propria): - This layer constitutes most of the cornea (90% of thickness). It consists of collagen fibrils (lamellae) embedded in hydrated matrix of proteoglycans. Descemet's membrane: - This layer bounds the stroma posteriorly. In the periphery it appears to end at the anterior limit of trabecular meshwork as Schwableys ring. Endothelium: - It is a single layer of flat polygnonal cells. The endothelial cells contain 'active-pump' mechanism and is the most important layer in maintaining the transparency of corneaQ.",

        "question": "Epithelium lining of lingual surface of epiglottis is?",
        "exp": "ANSWER: (D) Stratified squamous epithelium. REF: Basic Histology by Lange 11th edition Chapter 17 '\"The Respiratory System\"See APPENDIX-10 below for \"SOME IMPORTANT EPITHELIUM LININGS\". The epiglottis is a flap valve that covers the laryngeal airway during swallowing. Thus the epithelium facing the oral cavity is oral epithelium, while the epithelium on the surface facing the airway is respiratory. The entire lingual surface and the apical portion of the laryngeal surface are covered with stratified squamous epithelium. Toward the base of the epiglottis on the laryngeal surface, the epithelium undergoes a transition into ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. APPENDIX- 10. Common Types of Covering Epithelia in Human Body. Type. Cell Form. Examples of distribution. Main Function. Simple. Squamous. Lining of ves sels (endothelium). Serous lining of cavities; pericardium, pleura, peritoneum (mesothelium). Facilitates the movement of the viscera (mesothelium), active transport by pinocvtosis (mesothelium and endothelium), and secretion of biologically active molecules (mesothelium). Cuboidal. Covering the ovary, thyroid. Covering, secretion. Columnar. Lining of intestine, gallbladder. Protection, lubrication, absorption, secretion. Pseudost-ratified. Some columnar and some cuboidal. Lining of trachea, bronchi, nasal cavity. Protection, secretion; cilia-mediated transport of particles trapped in mucus. Stratified. Surface layer squamous keratinized (dry). Epidermis. Protection; prevents water loss. Surface layer squamous nonkeratinized (moist). Mouth, esophagus, larynx, vagina, anal canal. Protection, secretion; prevents water loss. Cuboidal. Sweat glands, developing ovarian follicles. Protection, secretion. Transitional: domelike to flattened, depending on the functional state of the organ. Bladder, ureters, renal calyces. Protection, distensibility. Columnar. Conjunctiva. Protection.",
