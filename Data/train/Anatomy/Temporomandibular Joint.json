        "exp": "Ans. A (Ref: Gray-' $ 40/e p539} Both A & B helps in protrusion of jaw. But A>B Protrusion of jaw is tarried out by the bilateral action of lateral pterygoid muscle which is represented by *A' in the diagram, originating by two heads from sphenoid bone and getting inserted at anterior surface of mandibular condyle. Muscles Marked in the Diagram A * Lateral Pterygoid B * Medial Pterygoid C * Buccinator D * Pterygomandibular Raphe \"Lateral pterygoid is a short, thick muscle consisting of two parts. The upper head arises from the infratemporal surface and infratemporal crest of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The lower head arises from the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate. From the two origins, the fibres converge, and pass backwards and laterally, to be inserted into a depression on the front of the neck of the mandible (the pterygoid fovea). \" -- Gray's 40/e p539 \"Actions of Lateral Pterygoid: When left and right muscles contract together the condyle is pulled forward and slightly downward. If only one lateral pterygoid contracts, the jaw rotates about a vertical axis passing roughly through the opposite condyle and is pulled medially toward the opposite side. This contraction together with that of the adjacent medial pterygoid (both attached to the lateral pterygoid plate) provides most of the strong medially directed component of the force used when grinding food between teeth of the same side. It is arguably the most importantfunction of the inferior head of lateral pterygoid. \" -- Grays 40/e p5 39.

        "question": "Which muscle is attached to intra-articular disc of temporomandibular joint?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Lateral pterygoid Temporomandibular jointo It is a synovial, bicondylar joint between the mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of temporal bone above and the head of mandible below. The joint is completely divided into two compartments (upper and lower) by a fibro cortilaginous articular disc. Ligaments of TM joints are fibrous capsule, Lateral temporomandibular ligament, and stylomandibular ligament. o The articular disc is a fibrocartilaginous disc which divides joint cavity into an upper and a lower compartment. The upper compartment permits gliding movement and the lower compartment permits rotatory as well as gliding movements. The articular disc represents the degenerated premitive insertion of lateral pterygoid: Central portion of articular disc is least vascular. Articular disc acts as shock absorber, prevents friction between articular surfaces and also has proprioceptive function. Articular disc also increases the area of contact and hence helps in distribution of weight across the joint, o There are following movements in TM joints1) Protrusion (protraction of chin):- Lateral and medial pterygoid of both sides acting together, assisted by superficial fibers of masseter. 2) Retraction (Retraction of chin):- Posterior fibers of temporalis assisted by deep fibers of masseter. 3) Elevation (Closing of mouth):- Masseter, temporalis, and medial pterygoid, of both sides. 4) Depression (opening of mouth):- Both lateral pterygoids assisted by digastric, mylohyoid and geniohyoid. 5) Side to side (lateral) movement:- Lateral and medial pterygoid of one side acting alternately with each other. o Dislocation of mandible occurs when mouth is opened too widely by excessive contraction of lateral pterygoid. Head of the mandible slips anteriorly into infratemporal fossa, o TM joints is supplied by auriculotemporal nerve and masseteric nerve.",
