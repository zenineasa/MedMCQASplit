Stagnant hypoxia The blood flow to a tissue is so low that adequate O2 is not delivered to it despite a normal PO2 and hemoglobin concentration.

Effects of hypoxia on cells. Hypoxia causes the production of transcription factors (hypoxia-inducible factors; HIFs).

Combined spinal-epidural analgesia during labor using intrathecal fentanyl 25 mcg produces good analgesia without major hemodynamic changes during the first stage of labor. During the second stage of labor, only the uterine contractile force should be allowed rather than the maternal expulsive effo that is always associated with the Valsalva maneuver. Therefore, the second stage of delivery should be cut sho by instrumentation. Supplementary analgesia for instrumentation with slow epidural boluses of fentanyl and a low concentration of bupivacaine reduces SVR and the cardiac pre-load. One of the major advantages of epidural analgesia is that it can be administered in incremental doses and that the total dose could be titrated to the desired sensory level. This coupled with the slower onset of anesthesia, allows the maternal cardiovascular system to compensate for the occurrence of sympathetic blockade, resulting in a lower risk of hypotension and decreased uteroplacental perfusion. Moreover, the segmental blockade spares the lower extremity \"muscle pump, \" aiding in venous return, and also decreases the incidence of thromboembolic events. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring, judicious intravenous administration of crystalloid and administration of small bolus doses of phenylephrine maintain maternal hemodynamic stability.

The total number of primary oocytes at bih is estimated to vary from 700, 000 to 2 million. During childhood most oocytes become atretic; only approximately 400, 000 are present by the beginning of pubey, and fewer than 500 will be ovulated. Some oocytes that reach maturity late in life have been dormant in the diplotene stage of the first meiotic division for 40 years or more before ovulation. Whether the diplotene stage is the most suitable phase to protect the oocyte against environmental influences is unknown. The fact that the risk of having children with chromosomal abnormalities increases with maternal age indicates that primary oocytes are vulnerable to damage as they age.
