        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Hemochromatosis o In hemochromatosis deposition of iron in the skin causes pigmentation (bronzing) of the skin and deposition of iron in the pancreas produces diabetes therefore the term bronze diabetes. o The clinical features of hemochromatosis are characterized principally by deposition of excess iron in the following organs in decreasing order of severity. Liver ( 95%)o Usually the first organ to be affected, o Hepatomegaly seen in most of the cases, o Micronodular cirrhosis is characteristico Hepatocellular carcinoma develops in 30% patients. Skin (90%)o Excessive skin pigmentation (Bronzing of the skin)o Skin pigmentation results partially due to hemosiderin deposition and mainly due to melanin depositiono Usually diffuse or generalized, but more pronounced on the face, neck and extensor aspects of lower forearms. Pancreas (65%)o Leads to diabetes meilitus. Joints (25-50%)o Arthropathyo Polyarthritis. Cardiaco Congestive heart failureo Arryhthmiao Cardiomyopathy (Restrictive). Hypogonadismo These changes are primarily the result of decreased production of gonadotropins due to impairment of hypothalamic-pituitary function by iron deposition however, primary testicular dysfunction may be seen in some cases",

        "exp": "Ans. is ' b' long term measurement of blood sugar Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) is produced by non enzymatic condensation of glucose molecules with free amino groups of the globin component of hemoglobin. Abnormally high level of glycosylated hemoglobin is seen in patients with chronic hyperglycemia. The higher the glucose level of serum, the higher will be the level of glycosylated hemoglobin.. Since glycosylated hemoglobins circulate within red blood cells and life span of RBC is 120 days, they generally reflect the state of glucose level over the preceding 8-12 weeks. Therefore they are used to assess glucose levels in diabetic patients. They are extremely useful in monitoring the progress of the patients.",
