CD4+ T cells are the major component of the inflammatory infiltrate in the rheumatoid synovium. Chronic inflammatory response in Rheumatoid Ahritis T cells (CD4) are the major component of the inflammatory infiltrate in the rheumatoid synovium. The T cells compromise 30-50% of the infiltrate, with the other cells accounting for the remainder. Evidence suggests that CD4+ T cells play an impoant role in orchestrating the chronic inflammatory response in RA. However, other cell types, such as CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and B cells are present in synol tissue and may also influence pathogenic responses The inflammatory infiltrate is made up of no less than six cell types: T cells (Most abundant) B cells Plasma cells Dendritic cells Mast cells and Granulocytes (to a lesser extent) Ref: Harrison&; s 19th edition Pgno: 2140",

        "exp": "Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy are normal at bih. Very early motor milestones are met, but walking is often delayed. The first indications of muscle weakness are clumsiness and inability to keep up with peers. Weakness begins in the pelvic girdle muscles and then extends to the shoulder girdle. Enlargement of the muscles of the lower leg associated with weakness, termed pseudohyperophy, is often present. The mean age of wheelchair dependence is around 9. 5 years. Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy are caused by loss-of-function mutations in the dystrophin gene on the X chromosome. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is typically associated with deletions or frameshift mutations that result in the total absence of dystrophin. In contrast, the mutations in Becker muscular dystrophy typically permit the synthesis of a truncated version of dystrophin, which presumably retains some function. Hence is less severe.
