        "question": "Which of the following cancer metastasize to brain leastly: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. D: Prostatic carcinoma The 5 most common primary sites are lung, breast, skin (melanoma), kidney and gastrointestinal tract, accounting for about 80% of all metastases. Some rare tumours (e. g. choriocarcinoma) have a high likelihood of metastasizing to the brain, whereas some more common tumours (e. g. prostatic tumours) almost never grow in the brain, even when they are metastatic to adjacent bone and dura. Prostatic carcinoma Advanced prostate cancer can spread to other pas of the body, causing symptoms. The most common symptom is bone pain, often in the veebrae, pelvis, or ribs. Spread of cancer into other bones such as the femur is usually to the proximal pa of the bone. Prostate cancer in the spine can also compress the spinal cord, causing leg weakness and urinary and fecal incontinence Trophoblastic diseases They comprise a variety of biologically interrelated conditions which form a clinical spectrum consisting of four distinct clinical pathological entities like - Molar pregnancy Invasive mole - Placental site trophoblastic tumours and - Choriocarcinoma Incidence of hydatidiform mole ranges from 1 in 500 in India to 1 in 3000 in USA. Like wise malignant potential of the disease is also higher in Southeast Asia reaching as high as 10-15% compared to 2-4% in west. Some of the hydatidiform moles erode the wall of uterus, burrow into myometrium and may even burst though the uterus into peritoneum and are called invasive mole. Even though locally aggressive, invasive mole does not metastasise. On the other hand choriocarcinoma is rare but one of the most malignant neoplasms arising in the body of uterus. Choriocarcinoma metastasises readily. It is not uncommon to find secondary nodules in the cervix or vagina. The lungs, brain and liver are the distant organs more often involved. Lymph nodes are rarely the site of metastasis Brain metastases They are the most common type of brain tumors, with the total number diagnosed annually outnumbering all other intracranial tumors combined. The most common source of brain metastases in males is lung cancer and in females is breast cancer. The mechanisms by which primary tumors produce brain metastases is thought to be hematogenous spread from primary or secondary sites in the lung. Since the brain has no lymphatic system, all tumors metastasizing to the brain do so by spreading through the bloodstream. Aerial blood passes through the lungs before entering the brain, and collects tumor cells filtered out in capillaries, which subsequently embolize to the brain. Melanoma has the highest tendency to produce multiple lesions, followed by lung and breast cancers.",

That leads to formation of microthrombi throughout the microcirculation of the body, often in a quixotically even distribution. o As a consequence of the thrombotic diathesis, there is consumption of platelets, fibrin and coagulation factors_and secondary activation of fibrinolytic mechanism. o Thus DIC can present with signs and symptoms relating to tissue hypoxia and infarction caused by the myriad microthrombi or as a hemorrhagic disorder related to depletion of elements required for homeostasis, hence the term consumption coagulopathy is used to describe D. I. C. o DIC can also lead to hemolytic anemia. It occurs due to fragmentation of red cells as they try to squeeze through the narrowed microvasculature. Schistocytes, the cells characteristic of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia are quiet common in patients with D. I. 0 (seen in 50%) of cause. o Like D. I. C., TT. P too, is characterized by widespread thrombosis and similar to D. I. C, the disseminated thrombosis leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. But the point to emphasize is that in TT. P the thrombus is a platelet thrombi i. e. the thrombi is composed mainly of platelets aggregates so quite unlike D. I. C. the level of coagulation factors remain normal. Robbins' States \"While D. I. C. and thrombotic microangiopathies share features such as microvascular occlusion and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, they are pathogenetically distinct. In T. and HUS (unlike DIC), activation of the coagulation cascade is not of primary impoant, and hence results of laboratory tests of coagulation such as PT and PTT are usually normal. \"",

Blood coagulation produces thrombin, which promotes platelet aggregation and granule release. The platelet granules generate an inflammatory response. White blood cells are attracted by selections and bind to integrins on endothelial cells, leading to their extravasation through the blood vessel walls. Cytokines released by the white blood cells and platelets up-regulate integrins on macrophages, which migrate to the area of injury, and on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which mediate wound healing and scar formation. Plasmin aids healing by removing excess fibrin. This aids the migration of keratinocytes into the wound to restore the epithelium under the scab. Collagen proliferates, producing the scar.

Negri bodies are discrete, intracytoplasmic, deeply eosinophilic inclusions that measure several microns in diameter. In about 75% of cases of rabies these can be seen on hematoxylin and eosin stained sections. They occur in neurons of the brain stem, paicularly those in the hippocampus, and in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Ultrastructural studies have shown that Negri body consists of a mass of nucleocapsids surrounded by viral paicles budding from intracytoplasmic membranes. Those bodies can be seen in axons, and it is in this way that virus spreads from the central nervous system to many organs of the body. Because Negri bodies are usually seen in intact neurons, they are found away from the inflammatory, nonspecific lesions. Rabies viral antigens can be demonstrated in infected cells by means of fluorescent antibody technique. Antigens can be shown to be present in cells in the absence of Negri bodies, and hence this technique is much more sensitive than the search of sections of brain for the pathognomonic cytoplasmic inclusions.",

Ag is the earliest virological marker in serum of patients with acute hepatitis B, it does not help in establishing the diagnosis of acute Hepatitis B infection (it may be seen in chronic cases or carrier state). It is the presence of IgM anti-HBc that confirms an acute Hepatitis B infection. HBs. Ag. The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs. Ag) is most frequently used to screen for the presence of this infection. It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection. However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host. Anti-HBc Ig. MThe infectious virion contains an inner \"core paicle\" enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core paicle is made of 180 or 240 copies of core protein, alternatively known as hepatitis B core antigen, or HBc. Ag. During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) may be the only serological evidence of disease. Hbe. Ag and anti-HBe. Sholy after the appearance of the HBs. Ag, the hepatitis B e antigen (HBe. Ag) will appear. Traditionally, the presence of HBe. Ag in a host's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivity. During the natural course of an infection, the HBe. Ag may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen (anti-HBe) will arise immediately afterwards. This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication. Anti-HBs and anti-HBc Ig. GIf the host is able to clear the infection, eventually the HBs. Ag will become undetectable and will be followed by IgG antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen and core antigen, (anti-HBs and anti HBc IgG). The time between the removal of the HBs. Ag and the appearance of anti-HBs is called the window period. A person negative for HBs. Ag but positive for anti-HBs has either cleared an infection or has been vaccinated previously. Hepatitis B carriers. Individuals who remain HBs. Ag positive for at least six months are considered to be hepatitis B carriers. Carriers of the virus may have chronic hepatitis B, which would be reflected by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and inflammation of the liver, as revealed by biopsy. Carriers who have seroconveed to HBe. Ag negative status, paicularly those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others. PCR tests. They have been developed to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in clinical specimens. These tests are used to assess a person's infection status and to monitor treatment. Individuals with high viral loads, characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy.",

        "exp": "The child is suffering from minimal change or nil disease (lipoid nephrosis), which has a peak incidence at 2-3 years of age. Minimal change disease can be associated with food allergies, medications, or hematologic malignancies, or it can occur idiopathically. The pathology does not appear to involve complement, immunoglobulins, or immune complex deposition. Rather, an altered cell-mediated immunologic response with abnormal secretion of lymphokines by T cells is thought to reduce the production of anions in the glomerular basement membrane, thereby increasing the glomerular permeability to plasma albumin through a reduction of electrostatic repulsion. The loss of anionic charges is also thought to or foot process fusion. Some authors have noted that other conditions associated with T-cell abnormalities, such as Hodgkin's disease and T-cell lymphoma, are sometimes associated with minimal change disease. Consumption of complement factors is observed in many conditions in which complement activation occurs, for example, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. IgG directed against renal and pulmonary basement membranes is found in Goodpasture's syndrome, a cause of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and hemoptysis. Immune complex deposition is associated with type III hypersensitivity reactions, including postinfectious glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, cryoglobulinemia, and bacterial endocarditis.

Necrosis only represents the morphological changes that occur after cell death. o These morphological changes (necrosis) is the result of 2 concurrent processes:? 1. Enzymatic digestion of the cell q Enzymes used in the process are derived from two sources:? (a) From the lysosomes of the dead cells themselves (Autolysis) (b) From the lysosomes of the immigrant leukocytes (Heterolysis) 2. Denaturation of intracellular proteins o These processes require hours to develop, So immediatly after cell death there are no detectable necrotic changes. o Necrosis usually effects a group of contigous cells (in contrast to apoptosis that involves death of a single cells), but it can effect single cell also. o In necrosis, there is diruption of membrane integrity --3 Intracellular contents leak out and elicit inflammation --> Inflammatory changes in the surrounding tissue (By contrast, in apoptosis there is no inflammatory reaction in the tissue). Morphological changes o As necrosis follows irreversible injury, the morphological changes are same that have been described in irreversible injury. These are? 1. Membrane damage 2. Large flocculent amorphous densities in mitochondria. 3. Intracytoplasmic myelin figures 4. Decreased basophilia and increased eosinophilia due to decreased RNP. 5.

The diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma should be confirmed by immunohistochemistry, which shows that the tumor cells are diffusely positive for pankeratin, keratin 5/6, calretinin and WT1, and negative for the epithelial markers CEA, CD15, Ber-EP4, Moc-31, TTF- 1, B72. 3 and so forth. For epithelial mesotheliomas, positive staining for pankeratin and calretinin and negative staining for three epithelial markers are considered sufficient for diagnosis. Occasionally, however, more stainings are required, because some carcinomas are positive for calretinin or are negative for some of the epithelial markers. In these difficult cases, electron microscopy showing the classic long-branching microvilli of human mesothelial cells compared to the short nonbranching microvilli of carcinomas can still be considered the gold standard for correct diagnosis.",

Renal tubular epithelial cell casts? o These casts results when the epithelial cells of the renal tubules are being excreted along with the casts. o Renal tubular epithelial casts are most suggestive of tubular injury as in acute tubular necrosis. o They are also found in other disorders including eclampsia, heavy metal poisoning, ethylene glycol intoxication(most of these cases lead to acute tubular necrosis). Granular casts? o These casts are fairly common and occur in both pathological and non pathological condition. o Granular casts can result either from the breakdown of cellular casts to a point where the cells that once were withinthem are no longer distinguishable or they can result from the inclusion of aggregates of plasma proteins, fibrinogenor immune complexes within the cast upon formation. o They can be fuher divided into coarse granular casts and fine granular casts. o Fine granular casts can appear in non pathological conditions such as vigorous exercise, but the presence of coarse granular cast is abnormal and presents in wide variety of clinical diseases. o They are common in renal parenchymal disease. Broad casts? These casts ori inate rom dilated chronicall dama ed tubules or the collec in ducts there ore the are called renal failure casts. o These are formed in collecting duct as a result of urinary stasis. o Broad casts are two to six times the size of other types of casts. o Broad casts or renal failure casts are usually seen in patients with advanced renal failure. Waxy casts? o Waxy casts are cylinders of smooth highly refractive material. o Waxy casts are seen in final stages of degeneration of fine granular casts. Since the granules need time to degrade, this implies nephron obstruction. o Waxy casts are seen in chronic renal diseases associated with renal failure seen in diabetic nephropathy, malignant hypertension, glomerulonephritis.",

Aldosterone also has direct effects on the vascular system, where it increases cardiac remodeling and decreases compliance. Aldosterone excess may cause direct damage to the myocardium and the kidney glomeruli, in addition to secondary damage due to systemic hypertension. Hypokalemia can be exacerbated by thiazide drug treatment, which leads to increased delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, thereby driving potassium excretion.

        "exp": "Reperfusion injury refers to myocardial vascular or electrophysiological dysfunction that is induced by the restoration of blood flow to previously ischemic tissue. o Manifestation includes: Reperfusion arrhythmias. Endothelial cell damage leading to microvascular dysfunction, Myocardial stunning. Myocyte death and infarction. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY- When blood flow to cardiac myocytes is disrupted by occlusion of a coronary artery, a series of events is set in motion that results in cellular injury and death. These processes are largely related to energy production and utilization and include the following: Reduced energy production with a fall in intracellular ATP levels, A transition from aerobic to anaerobic energy utilization, An accumulation of the products of anaerobic metabolism, Reduced intracellular pH. Factors that contribute to reperfusion injury include the following: Damage to cellular and organelle membranes, including mitochondria, Myocyte hypercontracture. Free radical formation. Aggregation of leukocytes and inflammatory mediators, Platelet activation. Complement activation. Activation of the pro-apoptotic signalling cascade. Endothelium damage and vasoconstriction. Oxygen and other free radicals - Free radicals are produced within a minute of reperfusion and continue to be generated for hours after the restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissue. Superoxide anion (O2) Hydrogen peroxide (H2. O2) Hypochlorous acid (HClO) Nitric oxide-derived peroxynitrite. Hydroxyl radical (OH) Several mechanisms have been proposed for the development of these free radicals including xanthine oxidase, activated neutrophils, electron leakage from ischemic mitochondrion, catecholamine oxidation, as well as cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes. The relative importance of each of these pathways is not clear, but they are probably interrelated and may potentiate one another. Free radicals damage myocytes directly by altering membrane proteins and phospholipids. Because these membrane constituents play crucial roles as receptors, enzymes, and ion channels, free radical injury can lead to fatal metabolic and structure derangements. As an example, oxygen radicals inure the sarcolemma and may impair the contractile function of the myocyte on this basis. The role for free radicals as a source of significant myocardial damage is further supported by studies showing that free radical scavengers, such as superoxide dismutase, administered during thrombolytic therapy help preserve myocardial function. Finally, reactive oxygen species stimulate leukocyte activation, chemotaxis, and leukocyte-endothelial adherence.",

Thromboangiitis obliterans occurs almost exclusively among heavy-cigarette-smoking persons. It is more common in men but the incidence is increasing in women because of increasing smoking habit in women. Buerger disease is associated with HLA -5 and HLA-A9. In thromboangiitis obliterans there is acute and chronic segmental inflammation of vessels with accompanied thrombosis in the lumen. Typically, the thrombus contains microabscesses with a central focus of neutrophils surrounded by granulomatous inflammation. Later, the inflammatory process extends into contiguous veins and nerves and in time all three structures (arteries, veins and nerves) become encased in fibrous tissue, a characteristic that is very rare with another form of vasculitis. Clinical manifestations Thrombangiitis obliterans affects vessels of upper and lower extremities. Symptoms are due to vascular insufficiency, i. e. Ischemia of toes, feet and fingers that can lead to ulcer and frank gangrene. Due to neural involvement, there may be severe pain, even at rest. Buerger disease Vs atherosclerosis Buerger disease is almost exclusively associated with smoking. Atherosclerosis is also associated with smoking, but it has other predisposing conditions also, e. g. diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia etc. Burger disease affects smaller arteries.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Euploidy Chromosomal disorders (cvtogenetic disorders) o Chromosomal mutation may cause? 1. Abnormal number of chromosomes 2. Alteration in the structure of chromosomes. 1. Abnormal number of chromosomes o There are 23 pairs of chromosomes (46, XX in females and 46, XY in males). o An exact multiple of the 23 (haploid number) is called euploidy. o When the number of chromosomes are not an exact multiple of 23, it is referred as aneuploidy. eg - Trisomy or monosomy. Pathogenesis of aneuploidy o In aneuploidy error either in meiosis or in mitosis. (a) Error in meiosis o It is the most common cause of aneuploidy. o The usual causes are nondisjunction or anaphase lag. o In nondisjunction, chromosomal pair fails to separate in first meiotic division during gametogenesis, so one gamete has an extra chromosome (n+1) and the other has one less chromosome (n-1). Feilization of such gametes with normal gamete results in two types of zygotes - trisomy (2n+1) or monosomy (2n-1). o In anaphase lag, one chromosome lags behind and is left out of the cell nucleus. The result is one gamete with normal chromosomes (n) and other gamete with one less chromosome (n-1). Feilization in two types of zygote -4 normal (2n) or monosomy (2n-1). (b) Error in Mitosis o Error in mitosis in early development give rise to two or more different types of populations in the same individuals, a condition referred as mosaicism. o Mosaicism affecting the sex chromosome is common. o In the division of an feilized ovum, an error may lead to one of the daughter cell receiving three sex chromosomes, where as the other recieves only one, yielding, a 45, X/47, XXX mosaic. That means the same individual will have both types of cells cells having 45, X and cells having 47, XXX. Then what is the difference between Monosomy / trisomy and mosachism? Trisomy/monosomy are due to defect in meiosis and before feilization, so that after feilization all cells have same number of chromosome either monosomy or trisomy. In mosaicism, defect is in mitosis and after feilization so that same individual has cells of two different population eg. 45, X and 47, XXX. 2. Abnormal structure of chromosome o Chromosomal structural changes usually result from chromosome breakage followed by loss or rearrangement. o Beside these chromosomal structural abnormalities some autosomal recessive genetic disorders are associated with such a high level of chromosomal instability that they are known as chromosomal breakage syndrome --> Ataxia - telangiectasis, bloom syndrome, and fanconi anemia. There is significantly increased risk of cancer in these syndromes.",

Serum ferritin o Most of the ferritin is stored is different organs (liver, spleen, bone marrow). o Very small amounts of ferritin normally circulate in the plasma. Since plasma ferritin is derived largely form the storage pool of body iron, its level correlate well with body iron stores. i. e., when there is iron depletion, body store of iron is reduced that inturn leads to decrease in plasma ferritin. Transferrin saturation and iron binding capicity 3 Iron is transpoed in the plasma by transferrin. o Normally transferrin is 33% saturated (77% free) with iron, yield serum iron levels that average 100-120 g/dl. So, if serum transferrin will be 100% saturated the serum iron will be 300 g/dl. that means the total iron binding capacity of transferrin is 300 to 350 g/dl. o When iron store is depleted e. g., in iron dificiency anemia, there is increased synthesis of transferrin that results in increased total iron binding capacity. o When iron store is repleted e. g., anemia of chronic disease, there is decreased synthesis of transferrin that results in decreased total iron binding capacity. Serum transferrin receptors Erythroid precursors have receptors for transferrin by which they recieve iron from transferrin that is utilized for hemoglobin synthesis. o When erythroid precursors mature, these receptors are shed into plasma and can be masured as serum transferrin receptors concentration. o In iron deficiency state, there is increased erythropoisis in bone marrow --> T concentration of erythroid precursor that results in increased total number of transferrin receptor T serum transferrin receptor concentration.",

Their shape is determined by the external environment of the cell, the metabolic activity of the cell, the nature of hemoglobin, the membrane skeleton, and age of the cell. The red blood cell's durability and flexibility are due to its submembranous protein network, the membrane skeleton. The membrane skeleton consists predominantly of four proteins: spectrin, actin, protein 4. 1, and ankyrin (also known as syndein). Spectrin is an extrinsic protein located on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. It is long and unusually flexible molecule consisting of two structurally and functionally distinct polypeptide chains. The membrane of the RBC comprises a phospholipid bilayer and an underlying two-dimensional network of spectrin molecules. The composite propeies of the phospholipid bilayer and spectrin network result in the biconcave or discocyte morphology of healthy RBCs and give the membrane its elastic and biorheological propeies.

It is defined pathologically as an abnormal permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by the destruction of alveolar walls and without obvious fibrosis. It frequently occurs in association with chronic bronchitis. Patients have been classified as having COPD with either emphysema or chronic bronchitis predominance. The 3 described morphological types of emphysema are centriacinar, panacinar, and paraseptal. Centriacinar emphysema begins in the respiratory bronchioles and spreads peripherally. Also termed centrilobular emphysema, this form is associated with long-standing cigarette smoking and predominantly involves the upper half of the lungs. - Panacinar emphysema destroys the entire alveolus uniformly and is predominant in the lower half of the lungs. Panacinar emphysema generally is observed in patients with homozygous alfal antitrypsin deficiency. In people who smoke, focal panacinar emphysema at the lung bases may accompany centriacinar emphysema. - Paraseptal emphysema, also known as distal acinar emphysema, preferentially involves the distal airway structures, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs. The process is localized around the septae of the lungs or pleura. Although airflow frequently is preserved, the apical bullae may lead to spontaneous pneumothorax.

The yellow area represents area of centrilobular necrosis due to anoxia and the dark red ares represent sinusoidal congestion in the rest of the liver lobule. In chronic cases, fibrous bands can extend from the central vein in zone 3 to the poal tract which looks very much like cirrhosis but is termed cardiac sclerosis and differs from the bridging fibrosis seen in advanced liver disease where the fibrous bands form bridges between poal tracts. The most common etiologies for congestive hepatopathy are constrictive pericarditis, mitral stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, and cor pulmonale.

In the United states, the typical patients with AIDS presents with fever, weight loss, diarrhea, generalized lymphadenopathy, multiple oppounistic infections, neurologic disease, and, in many cases, secondary neoplasms. Biopsy specimens from enlarged lymph nodes in the early stages of HIV infection reveal a marked follicular hyperplasia Patients of CLL are often asymptomatic at diagnosis. When symptoms appear, they are nonspecific and include easy fatiguability, weight loss, and anorexia. Generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are present in 5060% of symptomatic patients. Proliferation centres (on microscopy) are pathognomic for CLL/ Small lymphocytic lymphoma. Smudge cells may be seen. Hodgkins lymphoma most commonly presents as painless lymphadenopathy. Patients with disseminated disease (stage III-IV) or the mixed cellularity or lymphocyte depletion subtypes are more likely to have constitutional symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Identification of Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants is essential for the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma. Systemic symptoms in localized secondary TB, often appear early in the course and include malaise, anorexia, weight loss, and fever. Commonly the fever is low grade and remittent (appearing late each afternoon and then subsiding), and night sweats occur. Regional lymph nodes are less prominently involved early in secondary disease than they are in primary disease. Histologically, sites of active involvement are marked by a characteristic granulomatous inflammatory reaction that forms both caseating and non-caseating tubercles.",

Glycogen is viually absent from the hepatocytes in biopsy specimen. Mitochondrias are large pleomorphic and have decreased matricial density on electron microscopy. The kidney changes include swelling and fatty degeneration of proximal tubules. Astrocyte edema and loss of neuron in the brain. Reyes syndrome It is an acute self limiting metabolic insult of diverse etiology resulting in generalised nzitochondrial dysfunction due to inhibition of fatty acid )8 oxidation. Salicylates or viral infection can precipitate this metabolic impairment. The pathogenesis is thought to be damage to mitochondria caused by salicylate metabolite or some other toxin or chemical in the setting of viral infection. The reasons for mitochondria' dysfunction are unknown. No toxic factor has yet been conclusively identified but studies have suggested an etiological link among Reye's syndrome. The activities of hepatic mitachondrial enzymes including ornithine transcarbamylase, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and pyruvate dehydrogenase are reduced often to less than half their normal values. Mitochondria' dysfunction leads to elevated sho chain fatty acids and hyperanzmonenzia as well as directly to cerebral edema. It is prudent to avoid the use of aspirin as an antipyretic in pediatric patients with influenza or varicella. Clinical manifestations:- Classic Reyes syndrome exihibits a stereotypic biphasic course. It usually occurs in a previously healthy child. A prodromal febrile illness, an upper respiratory tract infection or chicken pox is followed by an interval in which the child has seemingly recovered. The abrupt onsent of protracted vomiting then occurs usually within 5-7 days after the onset of viral illness. Delirium, combative behaviour and stupor may occur simultaneously within a few hours after the onset of vomiting. Neurological symptoms may rapidly progress to seizures, coma and death; focal neurological signs are absent. Laboratory features:- There is explosive release from liver and muscle of enzymes such as aminotransferases, creatine kinase and lactic dehydrogenase. The activity of the mitochondrial enzyme serum glutamate dehydrogenase is greatly increased. Serum Ammonia level is increased. The prothrombin time is mild to moderately increased.",

        "exp": "Long-standing inflammatory conditions such as RA are associated with deposition of a form of amyloid known as AA (amyloid-associated protein), which may involve kidneys, heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and skin, for example. Amyloid deposition in the myocardium results in decreased compliance and impaired diastolic filling, i. e., restrictive cardiomyopathy. The myocardium has a rigid and waxy texture. This form of amyloid, as well as any other biochemical form, can be visualized on tissue section by staining with Congo red, which acquires a characteristic apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Note: Constrictive pericarditis is due to any pathologic process that results in fibrous thickening of the pericardium, with resultant impaired compliance. Clinically, therefore, this condition manifests with a picture similar to restrictive cardiomyopathy because of impaired diastolic filling. Constrictive pericarditis is usually caused by previous episodes of acute pericarditis, especially hemorrhagic, suppurative, and caseous pericarditis. Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by massive ventricular dilatation and may be caused by genetic alterations, myocarditis, toxic insults (alcohol), metabolic disorders (hemochromatosis), etc. Most cases are idiopathic. The main pathophysiologic alteration is impaired contractility. Most cases of hyperophic cardiomyopathy are familial and due to mutations in one of the genes encoding proteins of the sarcomeres, most frequently b-myosin heavy chain. This form of cardiomyopathy leads to asymmetric hyperophy of the left ventricle, with prominent thickening of the interventricular septum. In this case, too, impairment of ventricular compliance is the basic mechanism leading to reduced diastolic filling and heart failure. Ref: Stevenson L. W., Loscalzo J. (2012). Chapter 238.

        "question": "Classic example of missense mutation?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Sickle cell disease In sickle cell anemia there is missense type of point mutation. Mutations A mutation is apermanant change in the DNA. Mutations that affect genii cells (sperm or ovum) are transmitted to progeny and may give rise to inherited disease. Mutations that affect somatic cells arc not transmitted to progeny but are impoant in the genesis of cancers and congenital malformations. Mutations may be classified into three categories? 1. Gene mutations The vast majority of mutations associated with hereditary disease are gene mutations. These may of different types depending whether it involves complete gene or single base? (a) Point mutation A single nucleotide base is subustituted by a different base. When a pyrimidine base is subustituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine Transition. When a purine is substituded by a pyrimidine or vice-versa Transversion. This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i. e. in codon and leads to replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product. Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation. Example is sickle mutation in which CTC codon in 13-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid is changed to CAC codon that codes for valine. Another type of point mutation is nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon. 3 Example is 13-thalassemia in which CAG codon in I3-chain of hemoglobin that code for glutamin is changed to stop codon UAG after point mutation. (b) Deletion and inseions Deletion or inseion of one or two base lead to alterations in the reading frame of the DNA strand --> frame shift mutation. If the number of base pairs invoved is three or a multiple of three framshift does not occur (because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized. (c) Trinucleotide repeat mutation Normally a codon is triplet ie trinucleotide. In this type of mutation a codon, ie trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain. For example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeates of CGG. 2. Chromosome mutation Result from rearrangement of genetic material that give rise to visible structural changes in the chromosome. 3. Genome mutation Involves loss or gain of whole chromosome, e. g. monosomy - Turner syndrome, trisomy - Down syndrome.",

So, option b and d are ruled out. o Now we are left with option a and c, both of which are genetic forms of iron deficiency anemia. Genetic forms of iron deficiency anemia o Iron deficiency anemia is an acquired disease. It is generally associated with low cost diet and bleeding. o Recent advances in iron metabolism led to the recognition of new entitities of iron deficiency anemia in non bleeding and \"high cost diet\" nourished individuals. These are known as genetic forms of iron deficiency anemia. o Apparently rare these genetic forms of iron deficiency anemia should be recognized by hematologists as they are refractory to classical oral or intravenous iron administration.

Jaundiceo Jaundice is not a disease but rather a sign that can occur in many different diseases. o Jaundice is the yellowish staining of skin and sclerae which is caused by high level of blood bilirubin. o On the basis of etiology, jaundice can be divided into 3 types:? 1. Prehepatic jaundiceo Prehepatic jaundice is due to increased production of bilirubin which results an increased bilirubin load presented to the liver. o The liver is normal and is able to conjugate the bilirubin at a normal rate; However, due to overproduction of bilirubin, conjugation capacity of liver is overwhelmed and unconjugate bilirubin is increased --) Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. o Prehepatic jaundice is caused by hemolysis, i. e., hemolytic anemia due to any cause, e. g., hereditary spherocytosis, Thalassemia, SCA, Malaria, Drugs (methyldopa, quinine) etc. Hepatic jaundiceo Here the cause lies within the hepatocytes which have either a defect in the conjugation process or in the excretion of conjugated bilirubin into the bile. o This type of jaundice is caused by all causes of hepatitis (infection, alcohol, drugs, toxin or autoimmune); in congenital hyperbilirubenemias; and in cirrhosis. Post hepatic (extrahepatic) jaundiceo Post hepatic jaundice is due to obstruction of the excretion into the bile, e. g., in stone in CBD, carcinoma pancreas, CBD carcinoma etc. o Conjugation capacity of hepatocytes are normal and they continue their conjugation process without any interference leading to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.",

The diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is based on leucopenia with hypersegmented granulocytes, a moderate to severe Megaloblastic anemia, elevated levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid in the serum and low serum vitamin B12. Hypersegmented neutrophil. Normally, the number of segments in the nucleus of a neutrophil increases as it matures and ages, after being released into the blood from the bone marrow. Whereas normal neutrophils only contain three or four nuclear lobes (the \"segments\"), hypersegmented neutrophils contain five or more lobes. Hypersegmented neutrophils have classically been thought to be pathognomonic of the megaloblastic anemias (anemias caused by failure of bone marrow blood-forming cells to make DNA, often caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies, or DNA-replication poisons). One of the earliest, notable changes in the peripheral blood in megaloblastic processes is the appearance of hypersegmented neutrophils. Because of the sho life-span of neutrophils, these abnormal hypersegmented neutrophils characteristically appear even before the onset of anemia in megaloblastic processes. Such neutrophils are less often seen in the other classes of anemia, which together are far more common than megaloblastic types of anemia. Note that pernicious anemia is a type of megaloblastic anemia, and as such, is expected to show hypersegmented neutrophils.",

They have a high osmotic fragility and are more prone to physical degradation. They are most commonly found in immunologically-mediated hemolytic anemias and in hereditary spherocytosis, but the former would have a positive direct Coombs test and the latter would not. The misshapen but otherwise healthy red blood cells are mistaken by the spleen for old or damaged red blood cells and it thus constantly breaks them down, causing a cycle whereby the body destroys its own blood supply (auto-hemolysis). Chronic symptoms include anemia and splenomegaly. As a result of the broken-down blood cells -- bilirubin -- accumulates in the gallbladder and can cause pigmented gallstones to develop. In peripheral blood smears, red blood cells will appear abnormally small. The CBC will show elevated MCHC.

        "question": "Hypocalcemia is seen with which of the following: September 2008",
        "exp": "Ans. C: Acute pancreatitis Hypoalbuminemia is the most common cause of hypocalcemia and is due to cirrhosis, nephrosis, malnutrition, burns, chronic illness, and sepsis. Hypomagnesemia causes end-organ resistance to PTH and inhibits the hypocalcemic feedback loop through unceain mechanisms. Causes of hypomagnesemia include pancreatitis, aminoglycoside treatment, amphotericin B, loop diuretics, alcoholism, and malnutrition. Hyperphosphatemia may be seen in critical illness and in patients who have ingested phosphate-containing enemas. Phosphate binds calcium avidly, causing acute hypocalcemia. Multifactorial causes are probably the most clinically relevant hypocalcemic emergencies include the following: - Acute pancreatitis: Free fatty acids chelate calcium, causing saponification in the retroperitoneum. - Rhabdomyolysis: Increased phosphates from creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and other anions (i. e., lactate, bicarbonate) chelate calcium. - Sepsis can cause hypocalcemia through many mechanisms. - Toxic shock syndrome can cause hypocalcemia. High calcitonin levels cause low calcium. - Malignancy: Osteoblastic metastases (e. g., breast cancer, prostate cancer) and tumor lysis syndrome may cause hypocalcemia (by differing mechanisms). - Hepatic or renal insufficiency: Calciuresis, hypomagnesemia, hypoalbuminemia, and low active vitamin D levels may contribute to poor calcium homeostasis. - Infiltrative disease: Sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and hemochromatosis may infiltrate the parathyroids, causing dysfunction. -- Toxicologic causes include hydrofluoric acid burn or ingestion. Enhanced protein binding and anion chelation - Protein binding is enhanced by elevated pH and free fatty acid release in high catecholamine states. Anion chelation is seen in high phosphate states (e. g., renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, mesenteric ischemia, oral administration of phosphate-containing enemas); high citrate states (e. g., massive blood transfusion, radiocontrast dyes); and high bicarbonate, lactate, and oxalate levels. Medication effects - Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce gastric acid production resulting in reduced calcium absorption. - Selective serotonin inhibitors can have a calcium antagonistic effect on smooth muscle, paicularly vascular endothelium. - Calcitonin and bisphosphonates cause chelation and end-organ inhibition. - Phenobarbital and phenytoin enhance vitamin D catabolism and decrease calcium resorption in the gut. Foscarnet complexes with calcium. Fluoride, paicularly hydrofluoric acid, chelates calcium avidly and causes profound hypocalcemia. Ethylene glycol complexes with calcium. Estrogen inhibits bone resorption. Cimetidine decreases gastric pH, slowing fat breakdown, which is necessary to complex calcium for gut absorption. Aluminum and alcohol suppress PTH. Gadolinium-based contrast material can falsely lower serum calcium levels and should be considered if levels are drawn sholy after magnetic resonance imaging. Postsurgical effects Parathyroid adenoma resection causes a transient hypocalcemia due to end-organ PTH resistance in the first postoperative day. Pancreatectomy prevents calcium absorption in the duodenum and the jejunum by eliminating necessary enzymes. Small bowel syndrome causes hypocalcemia by reducing the surface available to absorb fatty acids and calcium. PTH deficiency/resistance Infiltrative diseases include Wilson disease and metastatic cancer. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is due to PTH resistance and has many forms, most notably Albright disease. Renal failure can result in a variety of endocrine disorders, occasionally including hypocalcemia. Vitamin D deficiency/resistance - Rickets may be due to lack of vitamin D or end-organ receptor resistance. - Hepatorenal disease: The liver and the kidney provide intermediary enzymes to form active 1, 25 (OH)2 D.",

According to this hypothesis, atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response of the arterial wall initiated by injury to endothelium. Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis Following stages occurs in the pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis 1. Endothelial injury Earliest stages of the development of atherosclerosis are mediated by the inflammatory cascade. Inflammation mediated injury to endothelium is the cornerstone in the development of atherosclerosis. After the injury, the endothelium is activated and there is increased expression of adhesion molecule-VCAM-1 and there is increased permeability to endothelium. TNF is the major cytokine to induce this expression. 2. Migration of leukocytes When VCAM-1 is expressed on endothelium, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium. Leukocytes then cross the endothelial barrier and begin to accumulate in subendothelial intimal space. Macrophages engulf LDL cholesterol and form foam cells -> formation of the earliest lesion, i. e. fatty streak. Macrophages also form oxygen free radicals that cause oxidation of LDL to yield oxidized LDL (modified LDL). 3. Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation Inflammatory cells in subendothelial intimal space secrete cytokines, mainly PDGF, TGF-\u03b1 and FGF which cause migration of smooth muscle cells from media to subendothelial intimal space as well as their proliferation. 4. Maturation of plague Smooth muscle cells synthesize extracellular matrix (especially collagen) and convert a fatty streak into a mature fibro-fatty atheroma, and contribute to the progressive growth of atherosclerotic lesions.",

        "exp": "Ans. is `b' i. e., Angleman syndrome o Don't get confused by previous explanations, where I have explained the deletion of paternal chromosome 15 in Prader Willi Syndrome. o To understand this question, one should know genomic imprinting as well as uniparental disomy. Genomic imprinting o A person inherits two copies of their genes one_ form their mother and one from their father Usually both copies of each gene are active or \"turned on\" in cells.. o In some cases however only one of the two copies is turned on. o Which copy is active depends on the parent of origin. Some genes are normally active only when they are inherited from a person's father. Others are active only when inherited from a person's mother. o This phenomenon is known as genomic imprinting. In genes that undergo genomic imprinting, the parent of origin is often marked or \"stamped\" on the gene during the formation of egg and sperm cells. This stamping process called methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to ceain segments of DNA. These molecules identify which copy of a gene was inherited from the mother and which was inherited from father. The gene that are imprinted or stamped are \"silent\"i. e., they do not remain functional. Uniparental disomy (UDP) o Normally a person inherits one copy of each chromosome pair from biological mother and the other copy of the chromosome pair from biological father. Uniparental disomy occurs when a person receives two copies of a chromosome from the same parent and no copies from the other parent. o UDP can occur as random event during the formation of egg or sperm cells or may happen in early fetal development. Example of Genomic imprinting and UDP The classical examples are Prader -Willi syndrome and Angleman syndrome. Prader-Willi syndrome o Approximately 70% of affected individuals have a small deletion on long arm ofparenteral chromosome 15, i. e. paternal genomic imprinting. There is silencing of paternal gene due to deletion.. Paternal gene Silenced (Paternal genomic imprinting) Maternal gene Only functional alle present o The remaining 30% of patients have maternal uniparenteral disomy for chromosome 15. That is they have two otherwise normal copies of maternal chromosome 15 and no paternal 15. o Thus Prader Willi syndrome ( in both above situations) results from the absence of paternal contribution to this region of chrmosome 15, whether by paternal deletion ( paternal genomic imprinting) or maternal UPD. Angleman syndrome o Most of the affected individuals have deletion on maternal chrmosome 15, i. e. maternal genomic imprinting. There is silencing of maternal gene due to deletion. Maternal gene Silenced (Maternal genomic imprinting) Paternal gene Only functional allel present o The remaining patients have paternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 15, i. e., they have two otherwise normal copies of paternal chromosome 15 and no maternal 15. o Thus Angleman syndrome results from the absence of maternal contribution to this region of chromossome 15, whether by maternal deletion ( maternal genomicimprinting) or paternal UDP.

An elevated level of Lp (a) is associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis. How does Lp (a) increase the risk of atherosclerosis? In atherosclerosis, there is hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis due to associated inflammation (remind you-atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory condition). So there is consistent deposition of fibrin. Lp (a) has close homology to plasminogen and it competes with plasminogen for binding on the surface of endothelium. This result in the reduced generation of plasmin from plasminogen -> Inhibition of endogenous fibrinolytic system. This enhances further fibrin deposition. In addition, Lp (a) is accumulated in atherosclerotic lesions. So, Lp (a) causes impaired cell surface fibrinolysis and progressive atherosclerosis.",

RB is inhibitory to cell cycle. However, p53 is normally present in very small amounts and accumulates only after DNA damage. The two major functions of p53 in the normal cell cycle are as under: In blocking mitotic activity: p53 inhibits the cyclins and CDKs and prevents the cell to enter G1 phase transiently. This breathing time in the cell cycle is utilised by the cell to repair the DNA damage. In promoting apoptosis: Normally, p53 acts together with another anti-oncogene, RB gene, and identifies the genes that have damaged DNA which cannot be repaired by inbuilt system. p53 directs such cells to apoptosis by activating apoptosis-inducing BAX gene, and thus bringing the defective cells to an end by apoptosis. This process operates in the cell cycle at G1 and G2 phases before the cell enters the S or M phase. Because of these significant roles in cell cycle, p53 is called as 'protector of the genome'.

It is a type of aeriolosclerosis which refers to hardening of aeriolar wall. It is encountered frequently in elderly patients, whether normotensive or hypeensive, hyaline aeriolosclerosis is more generalized and more severe in patients with hypertension. It is also common as pa of the characteristic microangiography in diabetes. It is often seen in kidney pathology. Lesions reflect leakage of plasma components across vascular endothelium and excessive extracellular matrix production by smooth muscle cells secondary to the chronic hemodynamic stress of hypertension. Hyaline aeriolosclerosis is a major morphologic characteristic of benign nephrosclerosis, in which the aeriolar narrowing causes diffuse impairment of renal blood supply, with loss of nephrons. The narrowing of the lumen can decrease renal blood flow and hence glomerular filtration rate leading to renin secretion and accentuating the underlying hypertension causing a perpetuating cycle",

        "exp": "Cytokines action Septic shock is caused by vasodilation and peripheral pooling of blood as a pa of systemic immune reaction to bacterial or fungal infection. Septic shock was earlier also known as endotoxic shock because it was believed to be most commonly associated with endotoxin secreted due to gram negative bacteria. Currently, septic shock is most. frequently triggered by grain positive bacterial infections followed by gram negative bacteria and fungi. Hence the older synonym of \"endotoxic shock\" is not appropriate. Septic shock may be caused by either gram positive or gram negative bacteria. The microbial triggers for septic shock are different in different bacterias:- - Grain negative bacteria --> * Lipopolysaccharide entotoxin - Gram positive bacteria * Lipoteichoic acid Cell wall murantyl peotide 'Superantigens Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin The primary initial event in endotoxic shock is release of cytokines irrespective of whether it is caused by gram positive or gram negative organism -The sequence of events leading to the production of primary cytokines is different in gram negative and grain positive bacterias but the result is the same i. e. both the gram (-ye) and gram (+ve) bacterias leads to production of same mediators of inflammation i. e. TNFa and IL-1. The sequence of events after the release of primary mediators of inflammation is same in both the types of bacteria. - Once the primary cytokines i. e. TNFa and IL-1 are released they activate endothelium and leucocytes to release secondary mediators. - The secondary mediators cause vasodilatation, vascular leak and endothelial damage. So two mechanisms are impoant in septic shock:- i) Release of primary mediators of inflammation TNFa and IL-1. ii) Activation and damage to endothelium Damage to endothelium leads to systemic inflammatory response which causes vasodilation and permeability leading to septic shock. But the initial primary event is the release of primary mediators of inflammation cytokines as a result of interaction between bacterial cell wall components and host cell. The endothelium is subsequently activated and damaged by these mediators (cytokines). Therefore cytokine release is the primary initiating factor in endotoxic shock.",

Auses, soft tissue swelling and discharge of coloured granules characterize a mycetoma foot. Chronic sinuses discharging granules are caused by (1) Eumycetes (true fungi), (2) Schizomycetes, which includes Actinomycosis (aerobic higher filamentous bacteria) and Botryomycosis (bacterial infection). - Actinomycosis is often caused by Actinomadura or Nocardia species wherein it gains entry after penetrating trauma (splinter, gravel or thorn prick). Young males are commonly affected and 75% of the lesions occur in the lower limbs. The disease slowly progresses from a nodule to multiple sinuses discharging coloured granules. Involvement of bone is late following dermal and soft tissue spread. - Botryomycosis (a misnomer), a chronic suppurative infection is caused by bacteria involving skin or viscera. This rare condition mimics a deep mycotic infection and is often caused by Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas species of bacteria. The feet and hands are commonly affected and penetrating trauma may be a predisposing factor. It usually presents as a nodule, sinus or ulcer, which is initially localized. The diagnosis of actinomycosis is based on clinical findings, demonstration of characteristic granules and culture of the organism from a deep tissue biopsy. Immunological studies (counter immuno electrophoresis and ELISA) are also used. Botryomycosis is diagnosed based on a positive gram's stain and culture; negative fungal cultures and demonstration of the characteristic botryomycotic granules at histopathology from a deep biopsy. In endemic areas, subcutaneous swelling with sinuses should be considered as mycetoma unless proved otherwise. The differential diagnosis includes chronic osteomyelitis, tuberculosis and chronic abscesses.",

Clinical signs and symptoms appear 1 to 3 days after injury as the sudden onset of tachypnea, dyspnea, tachycardia, irritability, and restlessness, which can progress rapidly to delirium or coma. Thrombocytopenia is attributed to platelet adhesion to fat globules and subsequent aggregation or splenic sequestration; anemia can result from similar red cell aggregation and/or hemolysis. A diffuse petechial rash (seen in 20%-50% of cases) is related to rapid onset of thrombocytopenia and can be a useful diagnostic feature. The pathogenesis of fat emboli syndrome involves both mechanical obstruction and biochemical injury. Fat microemboli occlude pulmonary and cerebral microvasculature, both directly and by triggering platelet aggregation. This deleterious effect is exacerbated by fatty acid release from lipid globules, which causes local toxic endothelial injury.

According to the theory, various highly reactive and potentially cytotoxic free-radical products of oxygen are generated metabolically in the cell. These sho-lived oxygen metabolites, including superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and singlet oxygen, have been shown to be capable of effects such as inactivation of sulfhydryl enzymes, interaction with and disruption of DNA, and peroxidation of unsaturated membrane lipids with resultant loss of membrane integrity. The cell is also equipped with an array of antioxidant defenses, including the enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, vitamin E, and ascorbate. Under hypoxia, the intracellular generation and influx of free radicals is believed to increase markedly and may overwhelm the detoxifying capacity of the normal complement of antioxidant defenses, with resultant cytotoxicity. The pathology of oxygen toxicity in the lungs is non-specific and consists of atelectasis, edema, alveolar hemorrhage, inflammation, fibrin deposition, and thickening and hyalinization of alveolar membranes.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Catarrhal inflammation o While the basic process of acute inflammation is same in all tissues, there are frequently qualitative differences in the inflammatory response seen under different circumstances. 1. Catarrhal inflammation o An inflammatory process that occurs in mucous membrane and is characterized by increased blood flow to the mucosal vessels, edema of interstitial tissue, enlargment of the secretory gland epithelial cells, and profuse discharge of mucus and epithelial debris. o It is very common, and mostly occurs in mucosal membrane of nose, pharynx and ear after upper respiratory tract infection or irritation. o It can also occur in other mucosal surfaces, e. g., GIT. 2. Serous inflammation o Marked by outpouring of a thin, serous fluid that is derived either from plasma or the secretion of mesothelial cell lining the peritoneal, pleural or pericardial cavity. The most common example is blister resulting from burn. Fibrinous inflammation o It occurs due to more severe injury when there is increased vascular permeability and larger molecules such as fibrinogen pass the vascular barrier, and fibrin is formed and deposited in the extracellular space. o It is seen in cavities, e. g., meninges, pericardium and pleura. Suppurative or Purulent inflammation It is characterized by the production of large amount ofpus (neutrophils + necrotic cells & debris + edema fluid). It is typically seen after infection with pyogenic bacteria e. g., staphylococci. A common example of an acute suppurative inflammation is acute appendicitis. Abscess is localized collection of purulent inflammatory tissue. 5. Ulcer (Ulcerative inflammation) An ulcer is a local defect, or excavation, of the surface of an organ or tissue that is produced by the sloughing (shedding) of inflammatory necrotic tissue. Ulceration occurs when tissue necrosis and resultant inflammation exist on or near a surface. It is seen in --> Inflammatory necrosis of mucosa of mouth, stomach, duodenum or genitourinary tract, and Subcutaneous inflammation of lower extremities in older persons who have circulatory disturbances that predispose to extensive necrosis.",

Lipofuscin is an insoluble pigment which represents the indigestible residue of autophagic vacuoles within cells formed during aging or atrophy. The following is the manner in which lipofuscin is formed:\"During atrophy and aging, degenerating cellular organelles are enclosed in autophagic vacuoles. Subsequently, lysosomes discharge their hydrolytic enzymes into these membrane bounded vacuoles and the cellular organelles are digested by autophagy. However, some of the organelle components may resist digestion or be incompletely digested. (Lipoproteins and other lipids make up most of the indigestible debris and their accumulation reflect the lack of sufficient quantities of lipase in most lysosomes.). When organelles are not digested completely, the debris persists as membrane-bounded residual bodies. Some of these residual bodies may be extruded from the cytoplasm, or may be eventually digested. However, in some instances, the residual bodies persist in cytoplasm of atrophic or aging cells. Lipofuscin occurs in a variety of organs and tissues, but it see specially prominent in the brain neurons, myocardial cells and in the adrenal and thyroid glands. Vitamin E deficiency may accentuate lipofuscin formation.",

        "question": "A 32-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and chronic renal failure manifests rapidly progressive weakness. On physical examination, she appears pale and has slightly yellow sclerae and an enlarged spleen. Blood tests reveal severe anemia and mild, mostly unconjugated, hyperbilirubinemia. Coombs test is positive at 37 C but negative at 0-4 C. This patient developed anemia because of?",
        "exp": "First, what type of anemia is it? It must be a hemolytic form, since it is associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (hence the yellow sclerae), resulting from increased destruction of red blood cells. Increased erythrocyte destruction is the cause (not the effect) of splenomegaly. Fuhermore, a positive Coombs test implies that hemolysis is mediated by antibodies attached to red blood cells. Thus, the correct choice must be either IgG or IgM. Since the Coombs test is positive at warm temperature (37 C), the antibody is a warm agglutinin. Warm agglutinins are viually always of IgG type and may be triggered by a variety of disorders, including lymphomas, drugs, and autoimmune diseases such as SLE. IgG-coated red cells are then sequestered by the spleen, where hemolysis occurs, thus explaining splenomegaly. By contrast, cold agglutinins are IgM and can be demonstrated by Coombs test at cold temperature (0-4 C). Cold agglutinins are usually triggered by Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection or lymphomas. Note: Bone marrow aplasia is due to failure or suppression of myeloid stem cells, with decreased production of red blood cells, platelets, and leukocytes (pancytopenia). Most commonly, this condition is caused by chemical agents (especially drugs such as chloramphenicol, phenylbutazone, alkylating agents, and antimetabolites) or total body irradiation. Renal failure causes normochromic, normocytic anemia because of decreased synthesis of erythropoietin. Erythropoietin administration is currently the standard treatment for this form of anemia. Although renal failure is a frequent consequence of SLE, there is no evidence that it plays a role in this patient's anemia. Ref: Reid M. E. (2010). Chapter 137. Erythrocyte Antigens and Antibodies.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Cytokines action Septic shock Septic shock is the condition where shock is caused by infection. Currently, septic shock is most frequently triggered by gram positive bacterial infections, followed by gram? nagative bacteria and fungi. Hence, the older synonym of \"endotoxic shock\" is not appropriate. - Robbin's 8th/e 130. Pathogenesis of septic shock Septic shock is caused by gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The microbial triggers for septic shock are. i) Gram negative bacteria: - Lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin). Gram positive bacteria: - Lipoteichoic acid, cell wall muramyl peptide, Superantigens (Staphylococal TSST, Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin). The initial event caused by all these trigers is the release of cytokines; However, mechanism is different:? i) Gram negative bacteria (Endotoxic shock) o Lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) of gram negative organism has a core of lipid A and a complex polysaccharide coat. o Lipid A moiety of LPS bind to lipopolysaccharide binding protein and this complex then binds to CD-14 on the surface of monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. o After that LPS is transferred to toll like receptor - o Signals from TLR-4 directly activate endothelium and leukocytes. ii) Gram positive bacteria may cause septic shock by:? o Gram positive bacteria may cause septic shock by:? i) Lipoteichoic acid of cell wall binds to toll like receptor-2 (TLR2) on the surface of monocyte/ macrophages and triggers the release of cytokines. ii) Superantigens are potent activators of T-lymphocytes. Superantigens bind directly to the lateral poion of TCR $ chain and MHC class II 13 chain and stimulate T-cells directly. Activated T-cells release IFN-y and IL-2 which stimulate macrophages to release primary cytotoxines. o All these result in release ofprimary cytokines. The impoant cytokines are TNF-a (most impoant cytokine in shock), IL-1 (2nd most impoant, IL-6). o After release of cytokines, the sequence of events is same for any type of septic shock: - a These cytokines activate endothelium and leukocytes which then release secondary mediators like NO, PAF, PG, LT, IL. (NO is responsible for vasodilation in septic shock). These secondary mediators cause vasodilatation, vascular leak and endothelial damage that results in shock. Release of excess primary mediators (cytokines) (TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6) Endothelial/leukocyte molecular activation Secondary mediators (NO, PAF, PG, LT, IL) Vasodilatation, capillary leak, endothelial damage Septic shock --> MODS --> Death So two mechanisms are impoant in septic shock:- i) Release of primary mediators of inflammation TNF? and IL-I. ii) Activation and damage to endothelium o Damage to endothelium leads to systemic inflammatory response which causes vasodilation and permeability leading to septic shock. o But the initial primary event is the release of primary mediators of inflammation cytokines as a result of interaction between bacterial cell wall components and host cell. The endothelium is subsequently activated and damaged by these mediators (cytokines). Therefore cvtokine release is the primary initiating factor in endotoxic shock. Infection (bacteria, fungi) Interaction of bacterial cell products with macrophages Release of primary mediation (cytokines) from macrophages Activation and damage to endothelium Release of secondary mediators o Vasodilation o Increased permeability o Decreased perfusion",

Ag is the earliest virological marker in serum of patients with acute hepatitis B, it does not help in establishing the diagnosis of acute Hepatitis B infection (it may be seen in chronic cases or carrier state) It is the presence of IgM anti-HBc that confirms an acute Hepatitis B infection HBs. Ag The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs. Ag) is most frequently used to screen for the presence of this infection. It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection. However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host. Anti-HBc IgM The infectious virion contains an inner \"core paicle\" enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core paicle is made of 180 or 240 copies of core protein, alternatively known as hepatitis B core antigen, or HBc. Ag. During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) may be the only serological evidence of disease. Hbe. Ag and anti-HBe Sholy after the appearance of the HBs. Ag, the hepatitis B e antigen (HBe. Ag) will appear. Traditionally, the presence of HBe. Ag in a host's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivity During the natural course of an infection, the HBe. Ag may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen (anti-HBe) will arise immediately afterwards. This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication. Anti-HBs and anti-HBc IgG If the host is able to clear the infection, eventually the HBs. Ag will become undetectable and will be followed by IgG antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen and core antigen, (anti-HBs and anti HBc IgG). The time between the removal of the HBs. Ag and the appearance of anti-HBs is called the window period. A person negative for HBs. Ag but positive for anti-HBs has either cleared an infection or has been vaccinated previously. Hepatitis B carriers Individuals who remain HBs. Ag positive for at least six months are considered to be hepatitis B carriers. Carriers of the virus may have chronic hepatitis B, which would be reflected by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and inflammation of the liver, as revealed by biopsy. Carriers who have seroconveed to HBe. Ag negative status, paicularly those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others. PCR tests They have been developed to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in clinical specimens.

Transudative pleural effusions are defined as those effusions that are caused by systemic factors that alter the balance of the formation and absorption of pleural fluid (e. g., left ventricular failure, renal failure, hepatic failure, and cirrhosis). Exudative pleural effusions, by contrast, are caused by alterations in local factors that influence the formation and absorption of pleural fluid (e. g., bacterial pneumonia, cancer, pulmonary embolism, and viral infection. According to Light's criteria, a pleural effusion is likely exudative if at least one of the following exists: The ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein is greater than 0. 5. The ratio of pleural fluid LDH and serum LDH is greater than 0. 6. Pleural fluid LDH is greater than 0. 7 times the normal upper limit for serum. Additional evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the excess fluid, and pleural fluid amylase, glucose, pH and cell counts are obtained. Pleural fluid amylase is elevated in cases of esophageal rupture, pancreatic pleural effusion, or cancer. Glucose is decreased with cancer, bacterial infections, or rheumatoid pleuritis. Pleural fluid pH is low in empyema (<7. 2) and may be low in cancer. If cancer is suspected, the pleural fluid is sent for cytology. The fluid is also sent for Gram staining and culture, and, if suspicious for tuberculosis. The most common causes of exudative pleural effusions are bacterial pneumonia, cancer (with lung cancer, breast cancer, and lymphoma causing approximately 75% of all malignant pleural effusions), viral infection, and pulmonary embolism.",

They take various forms (with various names) throughout the body (e. g., histiocytes, Kupffer cells, alveolar macrophages, microglia, and others), but all are part of the mononuclear phagocyte system. Besides phagocytosis, they play a critical role in nonspecific defence (innate immunity) and also help initiate specific defence mechanisms (adaptive immunity) by recruiting other immune cells such as lymphocytes. For example, they are important as antigen presenters to T cells. In humans, dysfunctional macrophages cause severe diseases such as a chronic granulomatous disease that result in frequent infections.",

        "exp": "Malignant mixed mullerian tumor is a tumor with 2 components, stromal and epithelial (endometrial glands), both of which are malignant. This is a rare and highly aggressive tumor that has a 25% 5-year survival rate. It usually affects older patients and presents with postmenopausal bleeding. The stromal component can contain metaplastic components such as cailage and bone. Interestingly, usually only the epithelial component metastasizes. Endolymphatic stromal myosis is a type of endometrial stromal tumor of intermediate malignancy. It appears as small pieces of stroma between myometrial bundles that infiltrate lymph channels. Patients may have pain or bleeding, or may be asymptomatic. Recurrences happen late in the course of the disease (years) in half of patients and metastasis occurs in 15%. There is no epithelial component, so this is an incorrect choice. Endometrial carcinoma is a malignancy of the epithelial glandular component of the endometrium. Abnormal bleeding is the usual presentation. High estrogen states cause this tissue to proliferate. There is no stromal component of this tumor, so this is an incorrect choice. Endometrial stromal sarcoma is a true sarcoma arising from the endometrial stroma that infiltrates the myometrium and invades vessels. There is no epithelial component. Ref: De. Ugae C. M. (2013).
