This is termed concentric hyperophy. This type of ventricle becomes \"stiff\" (i. e., compliance is reduced), which can impair filling and lead to diastolic dysfunction. Sometimes the chamber radius is increased and the wall thickness is increased moderately - this is termed eccentric hyperophy - and can occur when there is both volume and pressure overload. An example of this would be when systolic dysfunction and a volume overload state occur in a concentrically hyperophied hea, thus stimulating chronic chamber dilation.

It is found throughout the cell (thus, giving rise to its name) and can exist either in free form or as pa of a complex with other proteins. Single Ub molecules can be conjugated to the lysine of these proteins, or more commonly, Ub-chains can be attached. Ub is involved in many cell processes. Ub is conjugated to the protein cyclin during the G1 phase of mitosis and thus plays an impoant role in regulating the cell cycle.

        "exp": "ITP is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which antibodies against platelet glycoproteins cause platelet destruction and removal by the reticuloendothelial system. Secondary thrombocytopenia can also be produced by lupus, viral infections, and drugs. Only when secondary thrombocytopenia has been ruled out, can the diagnosis of ITP be made. Defective platelet aggregation is responsible for thrombasthenia, an autosomal dominant disease that causes prolonged bleeding time but normal numbers of platelets. Hypersplenism causes thrombocytopenia when an enlarged spleen traps normal platelets in the absence of other specific platelet disorders. This type of thrombocytopenia can be cured with splenectomy. Although the thrombocytopenia in ITP often improves with splenectomy, ITP does not cause splenomegaly. Megakaryopoiesis is disturbed in any disorder that causes bone marrow failure, including drug toxicity, leukemia, and infections. In this setting, thrombocytopenia is often pa of a pancytopenia.

        "exp": "Ans. D: Celiac disease Celiac sprue/celiac disease/gluten-sensitive enteropathy is a chronic disease of the digestive tract that interferes with the digestion and absorption of food nutrients. People with celiac sprue cannot tolerate gliadin, the alcohol-soluble fraction of gluten. Gluten is a protein commonly found in wheat, rye, and barley. Most patients with celiac disease tolerate oats, but they should be monitored closely. When people with celiac sprue ingest gliadin, the mucosa of their intestines is damaged by an immunologically mediated inflammatory response, resulting in maldigestion and malabsorption. Patients with celiac disease can present with failure to thrive and diarrhea (the classical form). However, some patients have only subtle symptoms (atypical celiac disease) or are asymptomatic (silent celiac disease). Blood for specific screening tests should be drawn before the patient is placed on a gluten-free diet. Current screening tests include IgA antibodies to tissue transaminase, IgA/IgG antigliadin antibodies and IgA antiendomysial antibody. Combined presence of antiendomysial antibody and antigliadin antibody is almost predictive of intestinal mucosal atrophy but if both antibody tests are negative, mucosa is almost normal. Antiendomysial antibody screening is an excellent test for the diagnosis and follow-up of celiac disease and for identification of asymptomatic patients. Antiendomysial antibodies are highly specific but less sensitive than other antibodies. The absence of HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 is useful for its high negative predictive value, but they are not helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Individuals with celiac disease have a higher than normal rate of malignancy. The most common celiac disease associated malignancy is enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma and small intestinal adenocarcinoma.",

Neutrophils remain predominant cells for upto 72 hrs, after which the macrophages take over as predominant cell. Lymphocytes and plasma cells are also seen along with macrophages in the acute inflammatory response. Mast cells may also involve in acute inflammation. There are exceptions to this pattern of cellular reaction:- Pseudomonas infection - Neutrophils predominate over 2 to 4 days. Viral infection --> Lymphocytes are the first cells to arrive. In some hypersensitivity reactions --4 Eosinophils predominate. Why neutrophils are replaced by macrophages? Neutrophils can not regenerate their lysosomal enzymes, so these cells are not capable of sustained activity. On the other hand macrophages can regenerate their lysosomal enzymes and are capable of sustained activity. So, macrophages become the predominant cells after 48-72 hrs to sustaine inflammation. Cells in Chronic inflammation The macrophage is the dominant cellular player in chronic inflammation. Other cells present in chronic inflammation include lymphocytes, plasma cells, Eosinophils, mast cells. Although neutrophils are characteristic of acute inflammation, many forms of chronic inflammation continue to slow large number of neutrophils e. g., in chronic bacterial osteomyelitis, and in the chronic damage induced in lungs by smoking & irritant stimuli.

An amyloid origin can be confirmed by staining with Congo red, which causes the nodules to stain red with ordinary light but exhibit a distinctive \"apple-green\" birefringence when viewed with polarized light. The most common type of amyloid (type AA) is due to deposition of altered immunoglobulin light chains and is seen in diseases with chronic antigenic stimulation, such as tuberculosis.

Because this antibody is labeled, it can be seen under a microscope and the origin of the tissue can be diagnosed. Let's begin the discussion with intermediate filaments: Intermediate filaments are cytoskeleton components of both normal and neoplastic tissue. There are the major antigens used in immunohistochemistry. Five broad classes of intermediate filaments exist. Most neoplasms show a predominant expression of one of these: a) Keratins Carcinomas, mesothelioma and non? seminomous GCT b) Vimentin Sarcoma, melanomas, seminomas, lymphomas c) Neurofilament Neural and neuroendocrine tumours d) Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) Neoplasms of astroglial origin e) Desmin Tumours of muscular origin (leiomyoma and rhabdomyomas) Neoplastic cells can co-express more than one of these intennediate filaments i. e. they may be +ve for 2 markers of different origin. These. findings can also be helpful to diagnose a tumour. After this brief outline let us examine various markers in each neoplasia. Carcinomas Cytokeratins are the most sensitive markers for carcinoma. - These are. fuher subdivided into 20 subtypes based on molecular weight and isoelectric pH. - These individual keratins provide impoant information about site of origin of given carcinoma. CK7+/CK20+ Urothelial transitional cell ca; Ca pancreas, Ovarian macinous carcinoma CK7+/CK20- Breast, lung, endometrium, thyroid, ovary (serous), thymoma CK7-/CK20+ Colorectal, stomach, Merkel cell CK7-/CK20- Liver, kidney (clear cell), prostate Epithelial markers for determination of site of origin of carcinoma Breast * Estrogen and progesterone receptor (ifpositive, denotes good prognosis) * GCDP (gross cystic disease protein) specific breast marker * (HE2/neu-poor prognosis) * Cadherin is -ye in lobular carcinoma but +ve in ductal carcinoma Liver CAM, AFP Thyroid Thyroglobul in (papillary & follicular) calcitonin (medullary) Prostate PAP, prostate specific antigen Colorectal CEA, CK20, pancreas CA19-9, ovary CA-125 Other epithelial markers Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) -4 Breast, lung and kidneys, adenocarcinoma are typically +ve. Carcinoma embryonic antigen +ve in carcinomas of GIT, pancreas, lung, breast, uterus and ovary Keratin positive tumours besides carcinomas Mesotheliomas - Usually +ve HMW keratin, CK5/6 should be distinguished from adenocarcinomas which are protective for low molecular weight cytokeratin and carcinoma embryonic origin. Non-seminomatous GCT - These can be distinguished from carcinoma as they are positive for - HCG (choriocarcinoma) - AFP (endothelial sinus tumour), - Placental alkaline phosphatase (PCAP), - Embryonal Ca (choriocarcinoma and endodennal sinus tumour). Sarcomas Vimentin: -Characteristically expressed in normal mesenchymal cells - Such tumours would include tumors derived from - blood vessels, - muscle, - fat, - cailage, - hemopoietic elements, - neural tube & neural crest, and - Seoli & Granulosa cells of testis and ovary. Other markers used in mesenchymal cell tumours. Tumour of myogenous origin, i. e. leio and rhabdomyosarcoma - Muscle specific Actin & Desmin - Myoglobin, myogenin and myo-D1 Tumour of vascular origin, i. e. hemangioma and angiosarcoma - Factor VIII - CD31 Fibrohistiocytic tumors, e. g. malignant fibrous histiocytoma - CD68 - HAM56 Osteosarcoma: - Osteopontin - Osteocalcin - Osteonectin - Bone GIA protein Ewing Sarcoma and PNET (Ewing in soft tissue): - CD99 (antibodies against MIC-2 gene) - besides Ewings this is also positive in few other tumours including ovarian granulosa cell tumour. GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumours): - CD117 identifies C-KIT gene for tyrosine kinase. - These are normally present on Cajal's interstitial cells. - These tumours respond to drug Glevac/Imatinib, which is also given to patients of CML having (9: 22) translocation. Other impoant tumours where immunohistochemistry has a role: Melanomas -S-100 (sensitive but not specific marker) - HMB-45 (melanosome, highly sensitive and specific) Lymphomas -CD-45 - used in screening of lymphomas. - Fuher typing is done by: - B cell markers CD19, CD20, CD23 - T-cell markers CD-2, CD-3, CD-7 - Reedsternberg cells - CD15 & CD30. for Hodgkin's lymphoma Seminoma -Vimentin & PLAP +ve - AFP and HCG (-ye) Neuroendocrine tumour, e. g. carcinoid tumors -NSE (neuron specific enolase) - Chromogranin - Synaptophysin - Leu-7 Neural tumours of glial origin, e. g. Astrocvtomas -GFAP (Glial fibrillary acid protein)",

Renal trauma can produce enough damage to the renal vasculature to result in the loss of large amounts of blood into the urine and the development of gross hematuria. Ureteral calculi often present with gross hematuria secondary to injury to the mucosa of the ureter. Similarly, injury to the bladder mucosa in acute cystitis can result in considerable blood loss, hence the expression \"hemorrhagic cystitis\".

        "exp": "Cherubism is a disease of children and usually the affected children are normal at birth. The disease starts manifesting at the age of 14 months to 3 years as painless, bilateral symmetrical enlargement of maxilla, and mandible. The rate and extent of jaw enlargement differs considerably among patients and usually, the earlier the lesion appears, the more rapidly it progresses. Dental anomalies such as missing teeth, especially 2nd and 3rd molars, crowding, malocclusion, premature loss of deciduous teeth, and delayed eruption of permanent teeth may be noticed. The disease is self-limiting and the enlargement slows down when the child reaches 5 years of age and stops completely at 12-15 years. At puberty, the lesions begin to regress spontaneously by continuous bone remodelling and at the end of third decade of life, the jaw bones are either clinically normal or with minimum residual deformity.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e, Ig mediators Platelets and hemostasis o Platelets play a central role in normal hemostasis. o After endothelial injury platelets come in contact with subendothelial ECM especially collegen. o On contact with ECM, platelets undergo three general reactions. Adhesion o Platelets adhesion to extracellular matrix is mediated largely interaction with Von-willebrand factor (VWF), which acts as a bridge between platelet surface receptor GPlb and exposed collegen. o Although platelets can also adhere to other components of ECM (fibronectin), GPIb - v. Wf association is the only interaction suffciently strong to overcome the high shear force of flowing blood. Secretion o Platelets contain two specific types of granules: - A). Alpha granule --> Contains fibrinogen, fibronectin, factors V & VIII, PDGF, TGF-(3 and platelet factor 4. B) Dens bodies or 5granules --> Contain ADP, Ca+2, histamine, serotonine, and epinephrine. Soon after adhesion, secretion of the contents of both granules occurs and secretion of thromboxane A2 also takes place. 3. Platelet aggregation It follows adhesion and secretion. The most impoant endogenous stimulus for platelet aggregation are ADP & TxA 2. o ADP & TxA, set up an autocatalytic reaction leading to buildup an enlarging platelet aggregate Primary hemostatic plug. o This primary plug is reversible. o Coagulation system is activated and thrombin is generated. o Thrombin binds to platelet surface receptors and along ADP & TXA2 cause furher aggregation of platelets and thrombin also conves fibrinogen to fibrin. o This followed by platelet contraction, creating an irreversible fused mass of platelet entangled in fibrin --> definitive secondary hemostatic plug. Factors that promote platelet aggregation (Pro-aggregatory factor) o ADP o Epinephrine o VWF o Thrombospondin o Immune complex o TXA2 o Serotonine o Fibrinogen o Collegen o Thrombin Now see each option of the question separately. o There is platelet contraction (not swelling). o Immune complex (Ig mediator) promote platelet aggregation. o Interaction among the leukocye contributes the inflammation that accompanies thrombosis, but has no role for platelet aggregation. o Interaction among platelet cause fuher aggregation of platelet. o Macromolecules (GPIIb/IIIa) promote platelet aggregation.

Stomach cancers are commonly adenocarcinomas (90%). Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa, and thence the muscularis propria. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumor cells describe irregular tubular structures, harboring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (\"back to back\" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighboring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiate. Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica, leather-bottle stomach) Tumor cells are discohesive and secrete mucus which is delivered in the interstitium producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically \"empty\" spaces). It is poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumor cell, it pushes the nucleus at the purpley\"signet-ring cell\". Around 5% of gastric carcinomas are lymphomas (MALTomas, or MALT lymphoma). Carcinoid and stromal tumors may also occur.",

However, the capillaries in the subcutaneous fat are aften involved in patients with systemic amyloidosis and can often provide sufficient tissues for the diagnosis of amyloidosis. o Therefore, a needle aspiration biopsy of fat just under the skin of the belly (fat pad aspiration) offers a simple and less invasive method to diagnose systemic amyloidosis and biopsy of the organ with the most severe clinical involvement is often unnecessary. When the subcutaneous fat aspiration biopsy does not provide information to reach a final diagnosis, biopsy samples can be collected from other organs. o The best sites of biopsy are abdominal fat pad (90% sensitivity) and rectal mucosa (70-80% sensitivity).

Acute inflammatory cells (neutrophils) infiltrate the infarcted area beginning 1 day and peaking at approximately 2-3 days after injury. This acute inflammatory response paially overlaps with the subsequent influx of lymphocytes and histiocytes. Reabsorption of necrotic myofibers by histiocytes, as well as proliferation of small blood vessels, marks early formation of granulation tissue at around 5 days. Ref: Wyatt C., Kemp W. L., Moos P.

Increase in androgen synthesis in utero causes androgenization of the female fetus in the first trimester. Excess androgen production causes gonadotropin-independent precocious pubey in males with 21-OHD. Salt wasting form of 21-OHD results from severe combined glucocoicoid and mineralocoicoid deficiency. It is diagnosed in any babies with ambiguous genitalia with bilateral non palpable gonads.

MALT lymphomas appear to have similar clinical, pathological and molecular features regardless of organs of origin. The most common cause of \"pro-lymphomatous\" inflammation in the stomach is chronic H. pylori infection, which is found in association with most cases of gastric MALToma.

Within the host and in ceain culture media, a large polysaccharide capsule surrounds each cell. C neoformans forms smooth, convex, yellow or tan colonies on solid media at 20-37degC (68-98. 6degF). This fungus is identified based on its microscopic appearance, biochemical test results, and ability to grow at 37degC (98. 6degF); most nonpathogenic Cryptococcus strains do not grow at this temperature. In addition, C. neoformans does not assimilate lactose and nitrates or produce pseudomycelia on cornmeal or rice-Tween agar. Most infections with C. neoformans consist of a lung infection. However, fungal meningitis, especially as a secondary infection for AIDS patients, is often caused by C. neoformans making it a paicularly dangerous fungus. Infections with this fungus are rare in those with fully functioning immune systems Blood and CSF should be cultured for fungi and submitted for cryptococcal antigen testing whenever CNS infection is suspected.

The adjoining mucosa is flat and the rugal folds extend to the margin of the ulcer and some reddening of the adjoining mucosa may indicate an associated gastritis. The gastric mucosa is often flattened due to the presence of chronic gastritis with atrophy. Acute ulcers may show edema and chronic ulcers show varying degrees of underlying fibrosis. The depth of the ulcer is variable with some showing only mucosal involvement in which case they are called erosions in contrast to deeply penetrating ulcers which involve submucosa and deeper layers. Occasionally evidence of active bleeding may be seen, and deep ulcers may perforate. Benign gastric ulcers are most commonly found along the lesser curvature near the interface of the body and antrum. Size and location of the ulcer do not differentiate benign and malignant ulcers.

Cells in cell culture can lose properties they originally had such as protein expression or change shape. This process is also termed dedifferentiation. Dedifferentiation can also be observed in some tumour e. g. dedifferentiated liposarcomas which will show more immature areas in an otherwise differentiated liposarcoma. Regression of a specialized cell or tissue to a simpler, more embryonic, unspecialized form i. e. a reversal of cell development so that differentiation that had occurred previously is lost and the cells become more generalized in structure.

How, do the cells find out that now the), do'nt need to divide fuher. Cells achieve this through telomer shoening Telomers are sho repeated sequences of DNA present at the linear ends of chromosome that are impoant for ensuring complete replication of chromosome ends. It consists of many arrays of TTAGGG repeats at terminal of 3' ending strand. It confers stability to chromosomes. With each successive division there is some shoening of the telomers. Once the telomers are shoened beyond a ceain point the ends of the chromosome are seen as broken DNA, which signals cell cycle arrest. The broken DNA leads to activation of p53 dependent cell cycle check points causing proliferative arrest or apoptosis. Thus telomere shoening functions as a clock that counts cell division. How do the germ cells keep on dividing throughout their life??? In germ cells telomere shoening is prevented by the sustained function of the enzyme telomerase. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomer. It is RNA dependent DNA polymerase. It has one segment that is complimentary to TTAGGG repeat and is used as template for the replication of telomeric sequence. This enzyme is absent from most somatic cells and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the cell cycle. Telomerase is present in Germ cells thus explaining the ability of these cells to self replicate extensively. If loss of telomere is the basis of finite life span then how do cancer cells continue to divide actively???? In cancer cells telomerase activity is reactivated. Telomerase activity has been detected in more than 90% of human tumours. Thus telomerase activity and maintenance of telomere length are essential for the replicative potential in cancer cells.",

Occasionally they involve the major blood vessels of the right side, the inferior vena cava and the pulmonary aery. o These plaque like thickenings are composed predominantly of smooth muscle cells and sparase collagen fibres embedded in an acid mucopolysaccharide-rich matrix materials. Elastic fibers are not present in the plaque. The most common cardiac manifestation is tricuspid regurgitation. Stenosis of right sided valve may also develop. Why does right sided hea involvement more common? o Carcinoid tumors produce a variety of bioactive products that produce these (above described) heart lesions. o Among these, serotonin is most impoant. Serotonin is inactivated during its passage through lung. o As you all know, left side of hea recieve blood from pulmonary circulation, left sided hear lesions are uncommon (Because serotonin has already been metabolized in lung). Similarly, gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors do not induce carcinoid heart disease (neither right nor left) as bioactive mediators released into the poal circulation are metabolized in the liver. o Therefore carcinoid heart disease is produced by tumors that have extensive hepatic metastasis (liver releases the mediators directly into IVC) or carcinoid tumors of organs that are outside poal circulation (e. g., ovary). Left sided hea involvement o Left sided hea involvement occurs only under unusual circumstances. 1. Patent foramen ovale Blood containing serotonin passes from right to left shunt. 2.

She died of myocardial infarction on her third hospital day. Which of the following was the underlying condition leading to the patient's demise?",
        "exp": "Infective endocarditis leads to formation of bulky and friable vegetations on the valvular leaflets. The vegetations are composed of fibrin, neutrophils, and colonies of bacteria that cause erosion of underlying cardiac structures. Fragments of infected vegetations may detach and cause pulmonary or systemic septic embolism. Splinter hemorrhages in the nail bed and petechiae in skin and mucosae are also due to microscopic septic emboli. In this case, myocardial infarction was probably due to a septic embolus in the coronary circulation. If infective endocarditis is due to a virulent organism such as Staphylococcus aureus (a common cause of endocarditis in intravenous drug abusers), a tumultuous clinical course ensues, associated with high moality. With less virulent organisms, such as Streptococci viridans, Subacute infective endocarditis is the resultant clinical picture. Subacute endocarditis arises in patients with previously malformed or damaged valves and is associated with a slower course and a better prognosis. Also Know: Carcinoid heart disease is caused by serotonin-producing carcinoids in the liver or lungs. Fibrosis of the endocardium ensues, affecting the right hea in the case of hepatic carcinoids and the left hea for pulmonary carcinoids. Thickening and rigidity of valvular leaflets are characteristic gross findings. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is a non-infective form of endocarditis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The vegetations are small and regularly aligned along the valvular margins. Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis was previously known as marantic endocarditis, being associated with debilitating conditions such as disseminated neoplasms. Increased coagulability is probably the underlying pathogenesis. The lesions are small vegetations similar to Libman-Sacks endocarditis.

These protective proteins prevent activation of complement and there by complement mediated lysis of blood cells. Deficiency of GPI results in absence of these proteins and blood cells become unusually sensitive to complement mediated lysis. o The GPI - linked proteins that are missing are: - Inhibitor of reactive lysis (CD-59) Decay accelerating factor (CD 55) Their absence results in hemolysis C8 binding protein. Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor - Its absence promotes thrombosis.

In Wilson disease, main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. Liver disease may present as tiredness, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and poal hypertension. On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider naevi (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most patients by the time they develop symptoms. About 5% of all patients are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of a hemolytic anemia. About half the patients with Wilson's have neurological or psychiatric problems. Specific neurological symptoms then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (increased rigidity and slowing of routine movements) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of pa of the body). Various medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson's disease: Eyes: Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) may be visible around the iris. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane of the cornea. They do not occur in all patients and may only be visible on slit lamp examination. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts, brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Kidneys: renal tubular acidosis, a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the PCT leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), weakening of the bone (due to calcium and phosphate loss) and occasionally aminoaciduria. Hea: cardiomyopathy and arrythmias. Hormones: hypoparathyroidism, infeility and habitual aboion.",

        "question": "True about stem cells -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Found in yolk sac. Stem Cells. Stem cells are characterized by their prolonged self-renewal Capacity by mitosis and by their assymetric replication, Asymetric replication is a special propey of stem cells, i. e. in every cell devision, one of the cells retain its self-renewing Capacity while the other enters a differentiating pathway and is Conveed to mature nondividing population. However, assymetry exists within a whole population of stem cells. Thus within a group of stem cells some self replicate and others differentiate. The two major type of stem cells are:? 1. Embryonic stem cells (ES) Embryos contain pluripotent ES cells, which can differentiate into all the tissues of the human body. 2. Adult stem cells -LI Many tissues in adult animals have been shown to contain reservoirs of stem cells, which are called adult stem cells. Li Compared to embryonic stem cells, which are pluripotent, adult stem cells have a more restricted differentiation capacity and are usually lineage specific, i. e are multipotent or unipotent. Adult Stem cells are of two types:? A. Bone marrow stem cells. These are hematopoietic stem cells which reside in bone marrow and differentiate into various blood cells. Although residing mainly in the marrow, a subset circulates normally in the peripheral blood. From 3 weeks to 3 months of intraembryonic life, hematopoietic stem cells in the yolk soc are the primary source of blood cells. From 3 months to just before bih stem cells, migrate to liver, which is the major organ for hematopoiesis during that period. After bih bone marrow becomes the major source. A remarkable observation about hematopoietic stem cells is that they may capable of giving rise to neurons, hepatocytes, mycocardium, bile duct cells, endothelial cells and skeletal muscle. This change in stem cell differentiation from one cell type to another is called transdifferentiation. Other type of bone marrow stem cells are bone marrow stromal cells which can differentiate, depending on the tissue environment, into chondrocytes, osteoblasts, adipocytes, myoblasts, endothelial cell precursors. B. Tissue stem cells. Located outside the marrow. Stem cells are located in sites called niches. 'J For example in GIT they are located at the isthmus of stomach glands and at the base of crypts of the colon. Following information have been added in 8th/e of Robbins Adult stem cells are also known as somatic stem cells. Adult stem cells of the bone marrow, the skin and the lining of GI tract divide continuously. Adult stem cell of liver, pancreas and adipose tissue do not actively produce differentiated cells under normal conditions. Somatic stem cells in the small intestine epithelium may be continuously cycling. o Regardless of their proliferative activity, somatic stem cells generate rapidly dividing cells known as transit amplifying cells. These cells lose the capacity of self-perpetuation, and give rise to cells with restricted development potential known as progenitor cells. Uses of stem cells:? Studies of human embryonic stem cells may yield information about the complex vents that occur during human development. Some of the most serious medical conditions, such as Cancer and bih defects, are due to abnormal cell division and differentiation. A better understanding of the genetic and molecular control of these processes may yield information about how such diseases arise and suggest new stratgies for therapy. To test new drug, e. g. new drugs could be tested for safety on differentiated stem cells generated from human pluripotent cell lines. The most impoant use of human stem cells is generation of cells and tissues that could be used for cell-based therapies. Stem cells, directed to differentiate into specific cell types, offer the possibility of a renewable source of replacement cells to treat diseases including parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injury, diabetes, osteoahritis, RA, and heart diseases. Stem cells are used as bone marrow transplantation in various types of leukemia and lymphoma. They have made possible the production of knockout mice. To produce these mice, a specific gene is inactivated or deleted from cultured ES cells. These cells are injected into blastocysts, which are then implanted into the uterus of the surrogate mother. The genetically modified implanted blastocysts develop into full embroys, as long as thegene defect does not cause embryonic lethality. Knockout mice have become widely used models for the experimental study of human disease and provide essential information about gene function in vivo. I think following stem cell related terms require some introduction: Potency of stem cells is the potential to differentiate into different cell types:-i) Totipotent stem cells - These cells are produced from feilization of sperm and ovum and cells that are produced by first few division after feilization are also totipotent. These cell can differentiate into all the tissues of embryonic or extraembryonic cell types. ii) Pluripotent stem cells - These are descendants of totipotent stem cells and can differentiate into cells derived from any of the three germ layers. iii) Multipotent stem cells - These cells can differentiate only into cells of a closely related family, e. g. hematopoietic stem cells differentiate into RBC, WBC, platelets but not into other types. iv) Unipotent stem cells - Can differentiate only in to one cell type (e. g. muscle stem cell), but have propey of self-renewal which distinguiches them from non-stem cells.",

Why is it so? lets see:? The NK cells express activating and inhibiting receptors. The functional activity of the NK cells is regulated by a balance between signal from these receptors. MHC class I molecules has inhibiting signal on NK cells and normal cell are not killed because inhibiting signals from normal MHC class I molecules overside activating signals. The ability of NK cells to kill target cells is inversly related to target cell expression of MHC class I molecule. If virus infection or neoplastic transformation reduces the expression of MHC I, inhibitory signals are interrupted and lysis of target cells occur. 3.

Free copper dissociates and is taken up into hepatocytes, where it is incorporated into an a, -globulin synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum to form ceruloplasmin (a copper-containing metallothionein) and resecreted into plasma. Ceruloplasmin accounts for 90% to 95% of plasma copper, although its biologic role is unknown, since the six to seven atoms of copper in each protein molecule are not readily exchangeable. Circulating ceruloplasmin is desialylated as pa of normal plasma protein aging. Desialylated ceruloplasmin is endocytosed by the liver, degraded within lysosomes, and its copper is excreted into bile. This degradation/excretion pathway is the primary route for copper elimination. Estimated total body copper is only 50 to 150 mg.",

This type of necrosis is most frequently caused by sudden cessation of blood flow (ischemia) in organs such as the heart (MI), Kidney (ATN), adrenal gland, and spleen. Note: Brain is the only exception, i. e., It is the only solid organ in which ischemia leads to liquefaction necrosis, not coagulative necrosis. It is also seen with other types of injury e. g., liver necrosis in viral hepatitis, Coagulative necrosis of skin after burns (Thermal injury). Why there are predominant protein denaturation and no enzymatic digestion? Hypoxia causes intracellular acidosis (has been explained earlier) -> 4 pH results in denaturation of proteins which includes not only structural proteins but also enzymes -> So, there is no enzymatic digestion Liquefactive necrosis It is the necrotic degradation of tissue that rapidly undergoes softening and liquefaction because of the action of hydrolytic enzymes. It occurs after 1. Infection Le., suppurative inflammation (most common). 2. Ischemic necrosis in the brain. Note: Brain lacks any substantial supportive stroma, so ischemic necrosis in the brain is liquefactive, unlike other organs where it is coagulative. Mechanism of liquefactive necrosis -> Microbes stimulates accumulation of inflammatory cells and these cells to release lysosomal enzymes. Caseous necrosis It is a variant of coagulative necrosis. It is most commonly encountered when cell death is attributable to certain organisms e. g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and fungi (Histoplasma, Coccidioidomycosis). Why is it called caseous necrosis, not coagulative necrosis? In contrast to coagulative necrosis where tissue architecture is maintained, in caseous necrosis, the tissue architecture is completely obliterated.

It is usually due to the reactivation of old lesions or gradual progression of primary tuberculosis into chronic form. The characteristics of secondary tuberculosis include extensive tissue damages due to immunologic reactions of the host to tubercle bacilli and their products. Primary vs Secondary Tuberculosis. When a host has first contact with tubercle bacilli:- An acute exudative lesion develops and rapidly spreads to the lymphatics and regional lymph nodes.- The exudative lesion in tissue often heals rapidly.- The lymph node undergoes caseation, which usually calcifies.- The tuberculin test becomes positive. If the primary lesion could not contained rapidly, the appearance of hypersensitivity to tuberculin provokes a dramatic change in the host's response to the organisms. The nonspecific inflammatory response evoked on first exposure to tubercle bacilli becomes granulomatous, evoking the formation of tubercles. The tubercle comprises an organized aggregation of enlarged macrophages that, because they resemble epithelial cells, are referred to as epithelioid cells. A peripheral collar of fibroblasts, macrophages, and lymphocytes surrounds the granuloma. Frequently the central region of epithelioid cells undergoes a characteristic caseous necrosis to produce a \"soft\" tubercle, the most characteristic hallmark of tuberculosis. When the antigen load at the initial infection site and regional lymph node is large, caseation necrosis may develop and lesions may later calcify. These calcified lesions of the primary site are referred to as the Ghon complex. After the development of hypersensitivity, the infection becomes quiescent and asymptomatic in the majority of patients (about 90%). In some, however, especially the very young and adults who are immunocompromised or who have other predisposing illnesses, the primary infection may evolve into clinical disease. The progression may be local at the site of the primary lesion, or it may be at one or more distant sites where bacilli have arrived during the early hematogenous spread. In a small number of persons whose initial tuberculous infection subsidies, secondary disease occurs in spite of acquired cellular immunity. In this phase of the disease, lesions are usually localized in the apices of the lungs (remember that tubercle bacilli require oxygen for growth). In about 5% of patients, apical pulmonary tuberculosis manifests itself within 2 years of the primary infection. Because of the acquired cellular immunity, bacilli are more promptly phagocytized and destroyed by the activated macrophages. As a result, in secondary tuberculosis, lesions remain localized and dissemination of organisms the lymphatic vessels is usually prevented. Hypersensitivity promotes a more rapid caseation and fibrotic walling-off of the focus. Histologically the reaction is characteristic of tubercle formation, manifested by a local accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages. T lymphocytes and their chemotactic lymphokines play a major role in the development of tuberculous granuloma. These differences between primary infection and post-primary or reactivation are attributed to (1) resistance and (2) hypersensitivity induced by the first infection of the host with tubercle bacilli.",

A: Space of disse Kidney-Histologically, the mesangium and capillary basement membrane of glomeruli are the most frequent renal sites of amyloid deposition, followed by involvement of aeriolar and aerial walls and peritubular interstitial tissues. As the extent of the amyloid deposition increases, the glomerular capillary tufts become obliterated and replaced by functionless spherical masses of amyloid material Liver- Microscopically, amyloid is initially deposited in the spaces (of Disse) between the hepatocytes and vascular sinusoids. As more amyloid accumulates, it compresses the hepatic cords and sinusoids. The hepatic cords undergo nutritional and pressure atrophy and become displaced or replaced by bands and nodules of amyloid. Spleen-Amyloidosis of the spleen has two different anatomical patterns. Most commonly, the amyloid deposition is limited to the splenic follicles, resulting in the gross appearance of a moderately enlarged spleen dotted with gray nodules (so called \"sago\" spleen). Alternatively, the amyloid deposits may spare the follicles and mainly infiltrate the red pulp sinuses, producing a large, firm spleen mottled with waxy discolorations (\"lardaceous\" spleen).",

P, acute and chronic both are autoimmune disorders in which platelet destruction results from formation of antiplatelet antibodies. Pathogenesis Chronic ITP is caused by the formation of autoantibodies against platelet membrane glycoproteins most often or Ib-IX. In overwhelming majority of cases the antiplatelet antibodies are of the IgG class. The mechanism of platelet destruction is similar to that seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Opsonized platelets are rendered susceptible to phagocytosis by the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. The spleen is the major site of the destruction of platelets. Pathology The principal morphologic lesions of thrombocytopenic purpura are found in the spleen and bone marrow but they are not diagnostic. The point to stress is that despite the increased destruction of platelets in spleen. the spleen size remains normal. On histological examination there is congestion of the sinusoids and hyperactivity and enlargement of the splenic follicles manifested by the formation of prominent germinal centres. Sometimes scattered megakaryocytes are found within the sinuses and sinusoidal walls. This represents a very mild form of extramedullary hematopoiesis. These splenic findings are not sufficiently distinctive to be considered diagnostic. Bone Marrow Bone marrow reveals a modestly increased number of megakaryocytes. These findings are not specific for autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, but merely reflect accelerated thrombopoiesis, being found in most forms of thrombocytopenia resulting from increased platelet destruction. The impoance of bone marrow examination is to rule out thrombocytopenias resulting from bone marrow failure. A decrease in the number of megakaryocytes goes against the diagnosis of I. T. P.",

Dermis It is thicker than epidermis and supplies the strength and integrity to the skin It has rich blood supply It contains adnexal structures i. e. --> Hair follicles, Sebaceous glands, Sweat glands. o The impoance of these adnexal structures is that they contain epithelial cells that can proliferate and can heal a paial thickness wound by epithelialisation. o Superficial burns Involve only epidermis and superficial dermis The adnexal structures are left intact so they can heal by epithelialisation. o Deep burns. In deep burns all the adnexal structures are lost so they can only heal by secondary intention with scarring. o Presence of granulations simply indicate healing, one cannot tell whether it is healing by primary intention or by secondary intention.",

Inflammation is fundamentally a protective response, the purpose of which is to destroy the damaging agent, initiate repair processes and return the damaged tissue to useful function. In the absence of inflammation, wounds and infection will never heal and progressive destruction of the tissues would compromise the survival of organisms. However, inflammation and repair may be potentially harmful, i. e., inflammation can damage healthy host tissues also e. g., in RA, interstitial lung fibrosis, atherosclerosis. Inflammation is divided into acute and chronic patterns:? 1. Acute inflammation 0 Rapid in onset Of relatively sho duration. Main characteristics are the exudation of fluid & plasma proteins (edema) and the emigration of neutrophils. Cardinal signs of inflammation are characteristic of acute inflammation. Celsus' four cardinal signs of inflammation are - i) Rubor --> Redness (due to vasodilatation of small blood vessels) ii) Tumor Swelling (due to exudation of fluid) iii) Color --> Heat (due to increased blood flow i. e., hypermia which is caused by vasodilatation). iv) Dolor --> Pain (Due to stretching of tissue from edema and also from chemical mediators, bradykinin) A fifth clinical sign was added later by Virchow v) Functio laesa --> Loss of function 2.

        "question": "Autoimmunity is caused by?",
        "exp": "Ans, is 'c' i. e., Negative selection of T cells in thymus Autoimmunity Autoimmunity is the reactivity of the body towards self antigen i. e. the immune system stas to consider the host cell as foreign antigen and mounts an immune response against it. Normally the immune system does not show any reactivity to self antigen. They are able to discriminate between foreign antigen and host cell. This is called immune tolerance or self tolerance How does immune tolerance develop? The immune system removes cells which show self reactivity to antigens. The process of removing these cells is broadly classified into two categories. a) Central tolerance b) Peripheral tolerance a) Central tolerance The premature lymphocytes which are self reactive are killed in the central organs i. e. organs where they mature (i. e. Bone marrow in case of B lymphocytes and Thymus in case of T lymphocytes) This process is called central deletion or negative selection i. e. the process which does not allow self reactive cells to grow. Sometimes instead of killing the self reactive cells only their receptors are deleted, this is called central editing or receptor editing. b) Peripheral tolerance Central tolerance is not able to kill all the premature self reactive cells. Some cells escape central tolerance; they mature and move out in the peripheral lymphoid system. The mechanism by which these cells are inactivated or removed in the peripheral lymphoid system is called peripheral tolerance. There are five main mechanisms operating in peripheral tolerance, these are: i) Anergy This refers to prolonged or irreversible functional inactivation of self reactive lymphocytes ii) Suppression by regulatory T cells Sometimes regulatory cells are present to suppress the self reactive T lymphocytes iii) Clonal deletion by activation induced cell death Self reactive lymphocytes receive signals that promote their death by apoptosis iv) Antigen Sequestration Some self reactive lymphocytes cannot react against the host cells because these cells or antigens are located in the tissues which do not communicate with blood e. g. testis, eye, and brain. These sites are called immune privileged sites, because it is difficult to induce immune response to antigen in these sites. v) Cytokine activation So, these are the layers of self tolerance for an autoimmune disease to develop in the body, these layers of self tolerance should be disrupted or bypassed. Mechanism of development of Autoimmunity 1. Exogenous a) Molecular mimicry - Cross reactivity between a microbial product and a self antigen might lead to activation of autoreactive lymphocytes. b) Superantigenic stimulation - Microbial superantigens, such as staphylococcal protein 'A' and enterotoxin, can stimulate a broad range of T and B cells irresepetive of their antigen specificity. c) Microbial adj uvanticity - Infectious agent may be able to overcome self tolerance because they possess molecules, such as bacterial endotoxin, that have adjuvant like effect which enhances immunogenicity of autoantigen. 2. Endogenous A. Altered antigen presention a) Loss of immunologic privilege - If the privileged site are damaged by trauma or inflammation, the sequestrated autoantigens (lens, brain protein) communicate with blood and lead to activation of autoreactive lymphocytes. b) Presentation of Cryptic epitopes (option b) - Protein determinants (eiptopes) of an antigen is not routinely seen by lymphocytes (cryptotic epitopes) are recognized as a result of immunologic reactivity to associated molecules. Infections may release and damage self antigen and expose epitopes of this antigen that are normally concealed from immune system, i. e., cryptic epitopes. c) Alteration of self antigen - Inflammation of drug exposure may cause a primary chemical alteration in proteins which may be recognized as autoantigen. d) Enhanced function of antigen presenting cells by costimulatory molecular expression and cytokine production may cause autoimmunity. Increased T cell help - Intese stimulation of T-cells can produce nonspecific signals that bypass the need for antigen-specific helper T cells and lead to polyclonal B cell activation with formation of multiple autoantibodies. Increased B cell function - Nonspecific stimulation of polyclonal B cell by B cell activators, such as bacterial endotoxin, may also lead to production of autoantibodies. Apoptotic defect - Clones of cells that had immunological reactivity with self antigen are eliminated during embryonic life by apoptosis. Such clones are called \"forbedden clones\". This negative selection of autoreactive T cells in the thymus requires expression of the autoimmune regular (AIRE) gene that enables the expression of tissue specific proteins of tissue specific ptoeins in thymic medullary cells. Peptides from these proteins are expressed in context of MHC molecules and mediate the elimination of autoreactive T cells. The absence of AIRE gene interferes expression of proteins in context MHC molecules and leads to failure of negative selection of autoreactive T cells. E Cytokine imbalance - Diminished production of IL-10 and TNF can lead to autoimmunity due to diminished inhibitory effect on autoreactive lymphocytes. F. Altered immunoregulation - Defect in the generation and expression of regulatory T cell activity may allow for the production of autoimmunity.",

NK cells play a major role in the rejection of tumors and cells infected by viruses. They kill cells by releasing small cytoplasmic granules of proteins called perforin and granzyme that cause the target cell to die by apoptosis. NK cells are defined as large granular lymphocytes (LGL) and constitute the third kind of cells differentiated from the common lymphoid progenitor generating B and T lymphocytes. They do not express T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) or Pan T marker CD3 or surface immunoglobulins (Ig) B cell receptors but they usually express the surface markers CD16 and CD56 in humans. Up to 80% of NK cells also express CD8. They were named \"natural killers\" because of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that are missing \"self\" markers of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I.

        "exp": "Retinoblastoma Retinoblastoma is a prime example of a tumour which is associated with loss of heterozygosity. This term is mostly used in the context of oncogenesis. The mutations required to produce retinoblastomes involves the RB gene located on chromosome 13 q14. RB gene is a tumour suppressor gene. Retinoblastoma develops when both the normal alleles of the RB gene are inactivated or altered. In familial case of retinoblastoma, children are born with one normal and one defective copy of the RB gene. Such a child is said to be heterozygous at the RB locus (one allele of the gene is normal while the other one is a mutant) This implies that heterozygosity for the RB gene does not affect cell behaviour i. e., (cancer does not develop as long as one gene is normal) Cancer develops when both the alleles are mutant i. e., when the cell becomes homozygous for the mutant allele or you can put it in another way, when the cell loses heterozygosity for the normal PB gene (a condition known as loss of heterozygosity) Make it clear that in oncology, loss of heterozygosity occurs when the remaining functional allete in a somatic cell of the off spring becomes inactivated by mutation. This results in no normal tumour suppressor gene being produced and almost ceainly results in turnourogenesis. It is a common occurrence in cancer, where it indicates the absence of a functional tumour suppressor gene in the lost region. Loss of heterozygosity is the basis of two hit hypothesis of cancers (Knudson's hypothesis) In hereditary cases of Retinoblastoma one genetic change (first hit) is inherited from the affected parent therefore it is present in all the somatic cells of the body. But one genetic change is not sufficient to produce cancer. The second mutation (second bit) is required to produce cancer. It occurs in the retinal cells (which are carrying the first mutation). The mutation occuring in Retinal cells is acquired. In sporadic cases both mutations (hits) occur somatically within a single retinal cell whose progeny then form the tumour. This RB gene act as an example of several other genes that act similarly. Genes on chromosomes II Wilms tumour, Hepatoblastoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma VHL Familial and sporadic clear cell Ca.",

        "exp": "Hyperplasia is an increase in cell number, whereas metaplasia is the replacement of one adult cell type by another adult cell type. Hyperplasia occurs when there is increased trophic stimulation (e. g., hormones, growth factors), increased functional demand, or persistent cell injury. Only labile and stable cells undergo hyperplasia; labile cells have stern cells that frequently divide, and stable cells have resting cells that are stimulated to enter the cell cycle. The presence of increased goblet cells in the mainstem bronchus of a smoker is an example of hyperplasia, because goblet cells are normally present in this area. However, their presence in the terminal bronchiole or gastric mucosa, where they are not normally found, is an example of metaplasia. Squamous epithelium in the bladder of a patient with Schistosoma haernatobium is an example of metaplasia, because the epithelium of a normal bladder is transitional. Irritation from the eggs of the schistosomes induces squamous metaplasia and the potential for dysplasia and squamous carcinoma. A distal esophagus with glandular epithelium intermixed with squamous epithelium is an example of Barrett esophagus. Chronic acid injury to the distal esophagus from gastroesophageal reflux stimulates the formation of mucoussecreting glandular epithelium, which is a type of glandular metaplasia and predisposes the patient to adenocarcinoma. Goblet and Paneth cells in the glands of the gastric mucosa is called intestinal metaplasia and is commonly seen in chronic atrophic gastritis of the body and fundus (type A) or pylorus and antrum (type B). It is a precursor lesion of adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Squamous epithelium in the mains tern bronchus of a smoker is squamous metaplasia, because normal epithelium is pseudostratifiecl, ciliated, and columnar.

        "question": "Which of the following statements on lymphoma is not True -",
        "exp": "One of the confusing aspects of the lymphoid neoplasm's concern the use of descriptive terms \"Lymphocytic leukaemia\" and \"Lymphoma\" Leukemia is used for lymphoid neoplasms presenting with widespread involvement of the bone marrow usually accompanied by the presence of a large number of tumor cells in the peripheral blood. Lymphoma, on the other hand, is used to describe proliferations arising as discrete tissue masses. Traditionally these terms were attached to what were felt to be distinct entities. However, the line between lymphocytic leukaemia's and the lymphomas often blurs. Many types of \"lymphoma\" occasionally present with a leukemic peripheral blood picture accompanied by extensive marrow involvement and evolution to \"leukemia\" is not unusual during progression of incurable \"lymphoma\". Conversely, tumors identical to leukaemia's sometimes arise as soft tissue masses without evidence of bone marrow disease. Hence when applied to particular neoplasms, the terms \"leukaemia\" and \"lymphoma\" merely describe the usual tissue distribution of the disease at the time of clinical presentation. Historically few areas of pathology have evoked as much controversy and confusion as the classification of NHL and related lymphoid neoplasms. In some older classification schemes, more than two dozen types of B-cell lymphomas were listed - a nomenclature system that was mind-numbing challenge for students and pathologists. This chaotic situation has improved greatly during the last decade. In 1994, a group of hematopathologists, oncologists and molecular biologists came together to create the revised European-American classification of lymphoid neoplasm's. (REAL) This classification incorporated objective criteria such as immunophenotype, and genetic aberrations together with morphologic and clinical features to define distinct clinicopathologic entities. Experience shows that most entities in the REAL classification can be diagnosed reproducibly by experienced pathologists and stratify patients into good and bad prognostic group. More recently an international group of hematopathologist and oncologists convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) reviewed and updated the REAL classification, resulting in the inclusion of a number of additional rare entities Presented here is the WHO classification, which sorts the lymphoid neoplasm into five broad categories based on their cell of origin: Precursor B-cell neoplasm (neoplasm of immature B cells) Peripheral B-cell neoplasm (neoplasm of mature B cells) Precursor T cell neoplasm (neoplasm of immature T cells) Peripheral T cell and Nk cell neoplasms (neoplasm of mature T cells and natural killer cells) Hodgkin's lymphoma (neoplasm of Reed-Sternberg cell and variant) Within the broad group of lymphomas, Hodgkin lymphoma is segregated from all other forms, which constitute the Non Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL.) Hodgkin lymphoma is clinically and histological distinct from the Non Hodgkin's lymphoma, while Non Hodgkin lymphomas frequently occur at extranodal sites and spread in an unpredictable fashion\u201e Hodgkin's lymphoma arises in a single node or chain of nodes and spreads first to anatomically contiguous nodes. Clinical difference between Hodgkin's and Non Hodgkin's lymphoma: Hodgkin's lymphoma More often localized to a single axial group of (cervical, mediastinal, paraaortic) nodes Orderly spread by contiguity Mesenteric nodes and waldeyer ring rarely involved. Extranodal involvement uncommon Non Hodgkin's lymphoma More frequent involvement of multiple peripheral nodes Non contiguous spread Waldeyer ring and mesenteric nodes commonly involved.

        "question": "Increased osmotic fragility is characteristic of: September 2009",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Hereditary spherocytosis The normal red blood cell is a relatively impermeable biconcave disc which maintains osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding medium. As the surrounding medium becomes hypotonic, fluid will be taken into the cell to maintain stability. Eventually under very hypotonic conditions the cell will fill to capacity and rupture. Spherocytic red blood cells have a decreased capacity to expand, and will rupture in mildly hypotonic conditions that fail to lyse normal red cells. They thus exhibit increased osmotic fragility. Osmotic fragility is determined by measuring the degree of hemolysis in hypotonic saline solution. With the unincubated test, red cell osmotic fragility is considered to be increased if hemolysis occurs in a sodium chloride concentration > 0. 5%. Although increased osmotic fragility is characteristically associated with hereditary spherocytosis, it may also be increased in other types of hemolytic anemia associated with the presence of spherocytes, paicularly auto-immune hemolytic anemia, and in hypernatermia (Na > 155 meq/L). Often the increased osmotic fragility in spherocytosis is limited to a small fraction of cells that are unusually susceptible to lysis. After incubation, the defect is magnified, and a striking increase in fragility will be seen in hereditary spherocytosis. Osmotic fragility is considered to be decreased if hemolysis is not complete in a 0. 30% Na. C1 solution. Decreased osmotic fragility is associated with chronic liver disease, iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, hyponatremia (Na < 130 meq/ L), polycythemia vera, and sickle cell anemia after splenectomy.",

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Myofibroblasts. Wound contraction is a feature of healing by secondary intention. This is the feature that most clearly differentiates primary from secondary healing. Contraction has been ascribed to the presence of myofibroblasis - altered fibroblasts that have the ultrastructual characteristics of smooth muscle cells. In above explanation, I have explained healing in general. Here I am giving brief description of wound healing. Skin wound healing. Skin wounds are classically described to heal by primary or secondary intention. A. Healing by primary intention. It occurs in wounds with opposed edges, e. g., surgical incision. The healing process follows a series of sequantial steps:? Immediate after incision. Incisional space filled with blood containing fibrin and blood cells. Dehydration of the surface clot forms scab that covers the wound. Within 24 hours. Neutrophils appear at the margins of wound. In 24-48 hours. Epithelial cells move from the wound edges along the cut margin of dermis, depositing basement membrane components as they move. They fuse in the midline beneath the surface scab, producing a continuous but thin epithelium layer that closes the wound. By day 3. Neutrophils are largely replaced by macrophages. Granulation tissue progressively invades the incision space. Collegen fibers now present in the margin but do not bridge the incision. ci By day SIncisional space is largely filled with granulation tissue. Neovascularization is maximum. Collegen fibrils become more abundant and begin to bridge the incision. The epidermis recovers its normal thickness. Et During second week. Leukocytes and edema have disappeared. There is continued accumulation of collegen and proliferation of fibroblast. o By the end of first month. Scar is made up of a cellular connective tissue devoid of inflammatory infiltrate covered now by intact epidermis. B. Healing by secondary intention. It occurs in wounds with seperated edges in which there is more extensive loss of cells and tissue. Regeneration of parenchymal cells cannot completely restore the original architecture, and hence abundant granulation tissue grows. Healing by secondary intention differ from primary intention in several respects:? 1. Inflammatory reaction is more intense. 2. Much larger amounts of granulation tissue are formed. 3. Wound contraction occurs --> Feature that most clearly differentiate secondary from primary healing. Permanent wound contraction requires the action of myolifibroblasts - Fibroblasts that have the ultrastructural characteristic of smooth muscle cells.",

This heterodimer binds to DNA sequences in target genes and is a potent transcriptional activator. The range of activities attributed to MYC includes histone acetylation, reduced cell adhesion and increased cell motility, increased protein synthesis, and decreased proteinase activity. The MYC protooncogene contains separate sequences that encode the growth promoting and apoptotic activities. In contrast to the regulated expression of MYC during normal cell proliferation, persistent expression, and in some cases overexpression, of the MYC protein is commonly found in tumors. This may lead to sustained transcription of critical target genes and subsequent neoplastic transformation. Dysregulation of MYC expression resulting from translocation of the gene occurs in Burkitt lymphoma. MYC is amplified in some cases of breast, colon, lung, and many other carcinomas. The related N-MYC and L-MYC genes are amplified in neuroblastomas and small cell cancers of the lung, respectively.",

However, other cytogenetic variants may be responsible, especially 46. XY/47. XXY mosaicism. The principal pathological abnormality is dysgenesis of the seminiferous tubules. This is evident from infancy (and possibly even in utero) and progresses with age. By adolescence, hyalinisation and \ufb01brosis are present within the seminiferous tubules and Leydig cell function is impaired, resulting in hypogonadism. Clinical features The diagnosis is typically made in adolescents who have presented with gynecomastia and failure to progress normally through puberty. Affected individuals usually have small, \ufb01rm testes. Tall stature is apparent from early childhood, re\ufb02ecting characteristically long leg length associated with 47. XXY, and may be exacerbated by androgen de\ufb01ciency with lack of epiphyseal closure in puberty. Other clinical features may include learning dif\ufb01culties and behavioral disorders, as well as an increased risk of breast cancer and type 2 diabetes in later life. The spectrum of clinical features is wide and some individuals, especially those with 46. XY/47. XXY mosaicism, may pass through puberty normally and be identi\ufb01ed only during investigation for infertility.

        "exp": "Thiy percent of patients with polyaeritis nodosa have hepatitis B antigenemia. Polyaeritis is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that can be difficult to diagnose, since the vascular involvement is typically widely scattered, and the specific symptoms depend on the specific vessels (small- to medium-sized aeries) involved. Patients typically present with low-grade fever, weakness, and weight loss. Abdominal pain, hematuria, renal failure, hypertension, and leukocytosis may occur. The disease is frequently fatal if untreated. Berry aneurysms are congenital saccular dilatations of vessels associated with adult polycystic kidney disease. Coronary aery aneurysms are associated with Kawasaki's disease in children. Dissecting aneurysms are associated with cystic medial necrosis (seen in Marfan's syndrome) and hypertension.
