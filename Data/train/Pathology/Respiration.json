In emphysema, not only there is less surface area for gas exchange, there is also less vascular bed for gas exchange. The body then has to compensate by hyperventilation (the \"puffer\"). Their arterial blood gases (ABGs) actually are relatively normal because of this compensatory hyperventilation. They actually have less hypoxemia (compared to blue bloaters) and appear to have a \"pink\" complexion and hence \"pink puffer\". Some of the pink appearance may also be due to the work (use of neck and chest muscles) these folks put into just drawing a breath.* A \"blue bloater\" is a person where the primary underlying lung pathology is chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is caused by excessive mucus production with airway obstruction resulting from hyperplasia of mucus- producing glands, goblet cell metaplasia, and chronic inflammation around bronchi. Unlike emphysema, the pulmonary capillary bed is undamaged. Instead, the body responds to the increased obstruction by decreasing ventilation and increasing cardiac output. There is a dreadful ventilation to perfusion mismatch leading to hypoxemia and polycythemia. In addition, they also have increased carbon dioxide retention (hypercapnia). Because of increasing obstruction, their residual lung volume gradually increases (the \"bloating\" part). They are hypoxemic/cyanotic because they actually have worse hypoxemia than pink puffers and this manifests as bluish lips and faces--the \"blue\" part.",

        "exp": "Ans. C. Panacinar. (Ref. H-17th/pg. 1638)EMPHYSEMA# Emphysema is characterized by destruction of gas-exchanging airspaces, i. e., the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. Their walls become perforated and later obliterated with coalescence of small distinct airspaces into abnormal and much larger airspaces.# Macrophages accumulate in respiratory bronchioles of essentially all young smokers. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from such individuals contains roughly five times as many macrophages as lavage from non- smokers.# In smokers' lavage fluid, macrophages comprise >95% of the total cell count, and neutrophils, nearly absent in nonsmokers' lavage, account for 1-2% of the cells. T lymphocytes, particularly CD8+ cells, are also increased in the alveolar space of smokers. Emphysema is classified into distinct pathologic types, the most important being centriacinar and panacinar: A. Centriacinar emphysema: a. The type most frequently associated with cigarette smoking. Qb. Characterized by enlarged airspaces found (initially) in association with respiratory bronchioles. c. Most prominent in the upper lobes and superior segments of lower lobes and is often quite focal. QB. Panacinar emphysema: a. refers to abnormally large airspaces evenly distributed within and across acinar units. b. Panacinar emphysema is usually observed in patients with al. AT deficiency. c. Has a predilection for the lower lobes. d. However, garden-variety smoking-related emphysema is usually mixed, particularly in advanced cases, and these pathologic classifications are not helpful in the care of patients with COPD. The pathogenesis of emphysema can be dissected into four interrelated events: 1) Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke may lead to inflammatory cell recruitment within the terminal airspaces of the lung. 2) These inflammatory cells release elastolytic proteinases which damage extracellular lung matrix3) Loss of matrix-cell attachment leads to apoptosis of structural cells of the lung. 4) Ineffective repair of elastin and perhaps other extracellular matrix components result in airspace enlargement that defines pulmonary emphysema. Lab findings FINDINGS:# Pulmonary function testing shows airflow obstruction with a reduction in FEV1 and FEV1/FVC.# Radiographic studies may assist in the classification of the type of COPD. Obvious bullae, paucity of parenchymal markings, or hyperlu cency suggest the presence of emphysema. Increased lung volumes and flattening of the diaphragm suggest hyperinflation but do not provide information about chronicity of the changes.# CT scan is the current definitive test for establishing the presence or absence of emphysema in living subjects. From a practical perspective, the CT scan does little to influence therapy of COPD except in those individuals considering surgical therapy for their disease.# Recent guidelines have suggested testing for al. AT deficiency in all subjects with COPD or asthma with chronic airflow obstruction. Measurement of the serum al. AT level is a reasonable initial test. For subjects with low al. AT levels, the definitive diagnosis of al. AT deficiency requires PI type determination. This is typically performed by isoelectric focusing of serum. Rx:# Only three interventions--smoking cessation, oxygen therapy in chronically hypoxemic patients, and lung volume reduction surgery in selected patients with emphysema--have been demonstrated to influence the natural history of patients with COPD.# There is currently suggestive, but not definitive, evidence that the use of inhaled glucocorticoids may alter mortality.",

        "exp": "Ans. D. Crocidolite. (Ref. Robbin's basic Pathology 8, h/pg. Chapter 13 & Internet). Malignant epithelioma, commonly occurs following chronic exposure (>20 years) to asbestos. Consider this diagnosis in those employed in milling and construction, as well as in workers in pipe, textiles, gaskets, and other industries in which asbestos (especially crocidoliteform) is used. In 75%, the diffuse (malignant) form occurs. Asbestosis and Asbestos-Related Diseases# Asbestos is a family of crystalline hydrated silicates with a fibrous geometry.# On the basis of epidemiologic studies, occupational exposure to asbestos is linked to# (1) parenchymal interstitial fibrosis (asbestosis); (2) localized fibrous plaques and calcifications or, rarely, diffuse fibrosis in the pleura; (3) Round atelectasis (4) pleural effusions; (5) bronchogenic carcinoma; (6) malignant pleural and peritoneal mesotheliomas; and (7) laryngeal carcinoma.# Pathogenesis: Concentration, size, shape, and solubility of the different forms of asbestos dictate whether disease will occur. There are two distinct forms of asbestos: o Serpentine (in which the fiber is curly and flexible) and amphibole (in which the fiber is straight, stiff, and brittle). There are several subtypes of curly and straight asbestos fibers. The serpentine chrysotile accounts for most of the asbestos used in industry. o Amphiboles. even though less prevalent, are more pathogenic than the serpentine chrysotile, but both types can produce asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. The straight, stiff amphiboles, in contrast, align themselves in the airstream and are hence delivered deeper into the lungs, where they may penetrate epithelial cells and reach the interstitium.# Morphology: Asbestosis is marked by diffuse interstitial fibrosis with distinct \"Ferruginous bodies\" /asbestos bodies, (golden brown, fusiform or beaded rods with a translucent center, consisting of asbestos fibers coated with an iron-containing proteinaceous material. Educational points: Silicosis# is currently the most prevalent chronic occupational disease in the world.# It is caused by inhalation of crystalline silica, mostly in occupational settings.# Silica occurs in both crystalline and amorphous forms, but crystalline forms (including quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite) are by far the most toxic and fibrogenic.# Of these, quartz is most commonly implicated in silicosis. 0# Ingested silica particles cause activation and release of mediators by pulmonary macrophages, including EL-1, TNF, fibronectin, lipid mediators, oxygen-derived free radicals, and fibrogenic cytokines. It has been noted that when mixed with other minerals, quartz has a reduced fibrogenic effect.# Silicotic nodules are characterized grossly in their early stages by tiny, barely palpable, discrete, pale-to-blackened (if coal dust is also present) nodules in the upper zones of the lungs. Microscopically, the silicotic nodule demonstrates concentrically arranged hyalinized collagen fibers surrounding an amorphous center. The \"whorled\" appearance of the collagen fibers is quite distinctive for silicosis.# Examination of the nodules by polarized microscopy reveals weakly birefringent silica particles, primarily in the center of the nodules. As the disease progresses, the individual nodules may coalesce into hard, collagenous scars, with eventual progression to PMF.# The intervening lung parenchyma may be compressed or overexpanded, and a honeycomb pattern may develop. Fibrotic lesions may also occur in the hilar lymph nodes (\"eggshell\" calcification) and pleura. Educational table: Mineral Dust-Induced Lung Disease. Agent. Disease. Exposure. Coal dust.

Recanalization of thrombi leads to narrow channels causing the bruits. Antiphospholipid antibodies pose a risk for thrombosis. The risk factors for systemic arterial atherosclerosis are not operative in the pulmonary arterial tree, and pulmonary atherosclerosis is a consequence of pulmonary hypertension, not a cause of it. Pneumonitis with parenchymal inflammation reduces ventilation more than perfusion. Sarcoidosis is an idiopathic granulomatous disease that mainly affects the pulmonary parenchyma.

In the absence of BMPR2 signaling, smooth muscle proliferation occurs, and pulmonary hypertension ensues. Inactivating germline mutations in the BMPR2 gene are found in 50% of the familial (primary) cases of pulmonary hypertension and in 26% of sporadic cases. None of the other molecules listed regulate pulmonary arterial wall structure. Endothelial nitric oxide controls vascular caliber. B-type natriuretic peptide and renin regulate sodium and water homeostasis, plasma volume, and systemic arterial pressure. Mutation in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) occurs in Marfan syndrome. Lysyl hydroxylase is required for cross-linking collagen, and its loss gives rise to one form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.",

The greater the exposure to silica dust and the longer the time of exposure, the greater is the lung injury. Silica is a major component of the earth's crust, including sand, which contains the mineral quartz. Mining, manufacturing, farming, and construction/renovation activities generate small silica crystals that can be inhaled, and their buoyancy allows them to be carried to alveoli. There, they are ingested by macrophages, which secrete cytokines that recruit other inflammatory cells and promote fibrogenesis. Carbon monoxide readily crosses the alveolar walls and binds avidly to hemoglobin, but does not injure the lung directly. Ozone, a component of smog, has no obvious pathologic effects. Tobacco smoke leads mainly to loss of lung tissue and emphysema, not to fibrosis.
