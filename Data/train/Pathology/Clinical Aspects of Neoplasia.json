        "exp": "Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th edition, Pg: 677. Explanation:\"Paraneoplastic syndromes are common in patients with lung cancer, especially those with SCLC. and may be the presenting finding or the first sign of recurrence \" (Ref: Harrison)\"'Any one of the histologic types of tumors may occasionally produce any one of the hormones, but tumors that produce ACTH and ADH are predominantly small cell carcinomas, whereas those that produce hypercalcemia are mostly squamous cell tumors <& Small cell lung cancer type is most commonly associated with ectopic hormone production. \" (Ref: Robbins). Paraneoplastic syndromes: Symptom complexes in cancer-bearing individuals that cannot readily be explained, either by the local or distant spread of the tumor or by the elaboration of hormones indigenous to the tissue from which the tumor arose. Paraneoplastic Syndromes associated with lung carcinomas. Lung carcinoma can be associated with several paraneoplastic syndromes. some of which may- antedate the development of a detectable pulmonary lesion. The hormones or hormone-like factors elaborated include: Small cell Ca. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), inducing hyponatremia due to inappropriate ADH secretion. Small cell CaA drenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). producing Cushing syndrome. Sqamous cell Ca. Parathormone, parathyroid hormone-related peptide, prostaglandin E. and some cytokines, ail implicated in the hypercalcemia Calcitonin, causing hypocalcemia Gonadotropins, causing gynecomastia. Lung carcinoid syndrome. Serotonin and bradykinin. The incidence - 1% to 10% of all lung cancer patients. Tumors that produce ACTH and ADH are predominantly small cell carcinomas. whereas those that produce hypercalcemia are mostly squamous cell tumors. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, in w hich muscle weakness is caused by auto-antibodies (possibly elicited by tumor ionic channels) directed to the neuronal calcium channel peripheral neuropathy, usually purely sensory; dermatologic abnormalities, including acanthosis nigricans: hematologic abnormalities, such as leukemoid reactions; and abnormality of connective tissue called hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, associated with clubbing of the fingers. Apical lung cancers in the superior pulmonary sulcus tend to invade the neural structures around the trachea, including the cervical sympathetic plexus, and produce a group of clinical findings that includes severe pain in the distribution of the ulnar nerve and Horner syndrome (enophthalmos. ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis) on the same side as the lesion. Such tumors are also referred to as Pancoast tumors. Paraneoplastic Syndromes(See table in the next question)",

MYOD1 and Myogenin. EMBRYONAL RHABDOMYOSARCOMAMost common type (60%). It includes the sarcoma botryoides, spindle cell and anaplastic variants. Occurs in children younger than 10 years of age. Typically arises in the nasal cavity, orbit, middle ear. prostate and paratesticular region. Commonly has parental isodisomv of chromosome 1 lpl5. 5, which leads to overexpression of the imprinted IGFII gene. The sarcoma botryoides subtype develops in the walls of hollow, mucosal-lined structures, such as the nasopharynx, common bile duct, bladder and vagina. Where the tumors abut the mucosa of an organ, they form a submucosal zone of hypercellularity called the cambium layer*. Grossly, seen as soft gray infiltrative mass. The tumor cells mimic skeletal muscle at various stages of embryogenesis and consist of sheets of both round and spindled cells in a myxoid stroma, resembling \"Tennis racket'. Rhabdomvoblasts with visible cross-striations may be present. ALVEOLAR RHABDOMYOSARCOMAAccounts for 20% of RMS. Develop in early to middle adolescence. Commonly arises in the deep musculature of the extremities. Histologically the tumor is traversed by a network of fibrous septae that divide the cells into clusters or aggregates resembling pulmonary alveolae. Those in the center of the aggregates are dyscohesive. while those at the periphery adhere to the septae. Cells with cross-striations are identified in about 25% of cases.

Askin's tumor is a PNET of the thoracopulmo- nary region. It develops from the soft tissues of the chest wall, particularly in the paravertebral region.
