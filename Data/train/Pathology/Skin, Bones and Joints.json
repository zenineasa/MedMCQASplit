Biopsies of muscle and skin may show deposition of the complement membrane attack complex (C5b-9) within capillary beds. Perifascicular atrophy, heliotrope rash and Gottron papules are characteristic. Nemaline myopathy - Childhood weakness; some with more severe weakness, hypotonia at bih (\"floppy infant\").
