Thus, the great preponderance of normal females are in reality mosaics and have two populations of cells, one with an inactivated maternal X and the other with an inactivated paternal X.

In normal females one of the chromosomes undergoes X inactivationin somatic cells. The inactivation ofthe paternal or maternal X chromosome occurs randomly in each somatic cell and thereby serves as a mechanism of dosage compensation, ensuring that males and females have equal expression of most X-linked genes.

How, do the cells find out that now they do'nt need to divide further. Cells achieve this through telomer shorteningo Telomers are short repeated sequences of DNA present at the linear ends of chromosome that are important for ensuring complete replication of chromosome ends. o It consists of many arrays of TTAGGG repeats at terminal of 3' ending strand. It confers stability- to chromosomes. With each successive division there is some shortening of the telomers. o Once the telomers are shortened beyond a certain point the ends of the chromosome are seen as broken DNA, which signals cell cycle arrest. o The broken DNA leads to activation of p53 dependent cell cycle check points causing proliferative arrest or apoptosis. o P53 causes activation of CDK inhibitor p21 that inactivate cyclin D-CDK4 complex so that cell can not cross restriction point and can not enter into 'S'phase. o Thus telomere shortening functions as a clock that counts cell division. How do the germ cells keep on dividing throughout their life??? o In germ cells telomere shortening is prevented by the sustained function of the enzyme telom erase, o Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomer. o it is RNA dependent DMA polymerase. It has one segment that is complimentary to TTAGGG repeat and is used as template for the replication of teiomeric sequence. o This enzyme is absent from most somatic cells and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the ceil cycle. Telomerase is present in Germ cells thus explaining the ability' of these cells to self replicate extensively. If loss of telomere is the basis offinite life span then how do cancer cells continue to divide actively???? o In cancer cells telomerase activity is reactivated.

Isochromosome formation results when one arm of a chromosome is lost and the remaining arm is duplicated, resulting in a chromosome consisting of two short arms only or of two long armsQ. An isochromosome has morphologically identical genetic information in both armsQ. MC isochromosome present in live births involves the long arm of the X and is designated i(X)(q10)Q. The Xq isochromosome is associated with monosomy for genes on the short arm of X and with trisomy for genes on the long arm of X. Ring ChromosomeA ring chromosome is a special form of deletionQ. It is produced when a break occurs at both ends of a chromosome with fusion of the damaged endsQ. If significant genetic material is lost, phenotypic abnormalities result. This might be expressed as 46, XY, r(14). Ring chromosomes do not behave normally in meiosis or mitosis and usually result in serious consequencesQ. Types of Chromosome. Metacentric: X-Shaped chromosomes. Centromere in the middle so that the two arms of the chromosomes are almost equalQ. In a normal karyotype, two chromosomes are considered metacentric: chromosomes 1 and 3. Submetacentrie: If arms' lengths are unequal, the chromosome is said to be submetacentric. Centromere is near the middle of the chromosome. One arm is shorter than other. Acrocentric: If the p (short) arm is so short that it is hard to observe, but still present, then the chromosome is acrocentric. QThe human genome includes six acrocentric chromosomes: 13, 14, 15, 21, 22 and Y chromosome. Telocentric: A telocentric chromosome's centromere is located at the terminal end of the chromosome.

        "exp": "ANSWER: (B) VCF syndrome. REF: Harrison's 18th ed ch: 62. The term contiguous gene syndrome refers to genetic disorders that mimic a combination of single-gene disorders. They result from the deletion of a small number of tightly clustered genes. Because some are too small to be detected cytogenetically, they are termed microdeletions. The application of molecular techniques like FISH has led to the identification of at least 18 of these microdeletion syndromes. Deletions involving the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q11. 21) are the most common microdeletions identified to date, present in about 1/3000 newborns. VCF (velo-cardio-facial) syndrome, the most commonly associated syndrome, consists of learning disabilities or mild mental retardation, palatal defects, a hypoplastic aloe nasi and long nose, and congenital heart defects (conotruncal defect). Some individuals with 22q11. 21 deletion are more severely affected and present with Di.

Defective DNA repair syndromeo Beside ihe dominantly inherited precancerous conditions, a group of cancer predisposing conditions is collectively characterized by defects in DNA repair, o Normally, if the DNA damage is present it is repaired at cell-cycle checkpoints. o If DNA repair mechanism is defective, cells replicate with defective DNA and mutations or chromosomal breaks are transfered in the progeny of cells that can lead to uncontrolled replication. o Most of these conditions are inherited as autosomal recessive, e. g -1.

Features of Turner syndrome in childreno The most severely affected patients generally present during infancy with edema (owing to lymph stasis) of the dorsum of the hand and foot and sometimes swelling of the nape of the neck. o Swelling of the neck is related to markedly distended lymphatic channels, producing so called cystic hygroma. o As these infants develop, the swelling subsides but often leave bilateral neck webbing and persistent looseness of skin on the back of the neck. o Congenital heart disease is also common, particularly preductal coarctation of Aorta and bicuspid Aortic valve. o C. V. S abnormalities are most important cause of mortality in children with Turner s syndrome. Features of Turner's syndrome in Adolescents and Adult:-o At puberty there is failure to develop normal secondary sex characteristics. o The genitalia remains infantile, breast development is inadequate and there is little pubic hair. Nipples are widely spaced. o Turner syndrome is the single most important cause of primary amenorrhoea accounting for approximately % of the cases. o Short stature (height rarely exceeds 150 cm). o The mental status of these patients is usually normal but subtle defects in nonverbal, visual spatial information processing have been noted (mental retardation is associated with the presence of extra chromosome not with loss of X chromosome). o About 50% of the patients develop autoantibodies directed to the thyroid gland and upto one half of these patients develop hypothyroidismo Other features include low posterior hairline, webbing of neck, cubitus valgus, streak ovaries. o Glucose intolerance, obesity and insulin resistance are also seen.",

Cardiac conduction defects & minor neurologic manifestations have also been seen in some families. Mitochondrial diseaseso DMA in human may be found at two locations. Nuclear DNA in the nucleus. Organelle DNA in the mitochondriao Mitocondrial DNA is the only non-chrontosomal DNA in human cells. o Mitochondrial DNA, is always maternally inherited. Why is it so, lets see:-Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA are located in different places in the cell. During fertilization, the sperm and egg cell nuclei fuse to form an embryo. The egg cell is very large compared to the sperm, so although the cells' nuclei fuse, the rest of the cell mass in the embryo comes from the egg only. Nuclear DNA is therefore co-inherited but the mitochondrial DNA, which is located outside of the nucleus, is always maternally inherited because all mitochondria in a foetus and later adult are derived from the mitochondria in the mothers egg.

Bloom syndrome. Ataxia telangiectasia.* Whereas, HNPCC is associated with inactivation of DNA mismatch repair gene, resulting in increased susceptibility to colon cancer, and cancers of Endometrium, ovary etc., * Example for Base pair defect is Sickle cell anemia; example for Translocation defect is Philadelphia chromosome in CML - t (9: 22).",
