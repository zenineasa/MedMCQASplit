How, do the cells find out that now they do'nt need to divide further. Cells achieve this through telomer shorteningo Telomers are short repeated sequences of DNA present at the linear ends of chromosome that are important for ensuring complete replication of chromosome ends. o It consists of many arrays of TTAGGG repeats at terminal of 3' ending strand. It confers stability- to chromosomes. With each successive division there is some shortening of the telomers. o Once the telomers are shortened beyond a certain point the ends of the chromosome are seen as broken DNA, which signals cell cycle arrest. o The broken DNA leads to activation of p53 dependent cell cycle check points causing proliferative arrest or apoptosis. o P53 causes activation of CDK inhibitor p21 that inactivate cyclin D-CDK4 complex so that cell can not cross restriction point and can not enter into 'S'phase. o Thus telomere shortening functions as a clock that counts cell division. How do the germ cells keep on dividing throughout their life??? o In germ cells telomere shortening is prevented by the sustained function of the enzyme telom erase, o Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomer. o it is RNA dependent DMA polymerase. It has one segment that is complimentary to TTAGGG repeat and is used as template for the replication of teiomeric sequence. o This enzyme is absent from most somatic cells and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the ceil cycle. Telomerase is present in Germ cells thus explaining the ability' of these cells to self replicate extensively. If loss of telomere is the basis offinite life span then how do cancer cells continue to divide actively???? o In cancer cells telomerase activity is reactivated. Telomerase activity has been detected in more than 90% of human tumours. o Thus telomerase activity and maintenance of telomere length are essential for the replicative potential in cancer cells.",

The application of molecular techniques like FISH has led to the identification of at least 18 of these microdeletion syndromes.

VCF (velo-cardio-facial) syndrome, the most commonly associated syndrome, consists of learning disabilities or mild mental retardation, palatal defects, a hypoplastic aloe nasi and long nose, and congenital heart defects (conotruncal defect).

Human cancers have following important etiological factors -Genetic predisposition to cancer. Non-heriditary predisposing conditionsG Geographic and environmental factors. Genetic (Hereditary or inherited) predisposition to cancero A large number of cancers have hereditary predispositions, o Genetic predisposition may be of three types. 1. Autosomal dominant Inherited cancer syndromeso This is the most common type of genetic predisposition. o The mechanism involves uncontrolled cell division due to germline mutation of cancer suppressor gene.

Defective DNA repair syndromeo Beside ihe dominantly inherited precancerous conditions, a group of cancer predisposing conditions is collectively characterized by defects in DNA repair, o Normally, if the DNA damage is present it is repaired at cell-cycle checkpoints. o If DNA repair mechanism is defective, cells replicate with defective DNA and mutations or chromosomal breaks are transfered in the progeny of cells that can lead to uncontrolled replication. o Most of these conditions are inherited as autosomal recessive, e. g -1. Xeroderma pigmentosa3. Fanconisyndrome2. Bloom syn drome4. Ataxia telangectasiao One condition in this group is autosomal dominant - heriditory nonpotypid colon cancer (HNPCC). 3. Familial cancerso Besides the inherited syndromes of cancer susceptibility', some cancers occur at higher frequency in certain families without a clearly defined pattern of transmission, o That means, there is familial clustering of cases, but role of inherited predisposition is not clear for each individual, o Example - Breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers.",

It is a neurodegenerative disease that manifests itself as progressive bilateral loss of central vision. Visual impairment is first noted between ages 15 and 35, and it leads to blindness. Cardiac conduction defects & minor neurologic manifestations have also been seen in some families. Mitochondrial diseaseso DMA in human may be found at two locations. Nuclear DNA in the nucleus. Organelle DNA in the mitochondriao Mitocondrial DNA is the only non-chrontosomal DNA in human cells. o Mitochondrial DNA, is always maternally inherited. Why is it so, lets see:-Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA are located in different places in the cell. During fertilization, the sperm and egg cell nuclei fuse to form an embryo. The egg cell is very large compared to the sperm, so although the cells' nuclei fuse, the rest of the cell mass in the embryo comes from the egg only. Nuclear DNA is therefore co-inherited but the mitochondrial DNA, which is located outside of the nucleus, is always maternally inherited because all mitochondria in a foetus and later adult are derived from the mitochondria in the mothers egg. All children from affected mother will inherit the disease but it will not be transmittedfrom an affectedfather to his children. Clinical Syndromes of Mitochondrial Diseases. Disorder.
