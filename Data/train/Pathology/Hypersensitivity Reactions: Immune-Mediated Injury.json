        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Injection with foreign serum o Serum sickness is a type III hypersensitivity (immune complex mediated) reaction that results from the injection of heterologous or foreign protein or serum.o Certain medications (eg, penicillin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ) have also been associated with serum sickness-like disease.o When an antiserum is given, the human immune system can mistake the proteins present for harmful antigens. The body produces antibodies, which combine with these proteins to form immune complexes. These complexes precipitate, enter the walls of blood vessels, and activate the complement cascade, initiating an inflammatory response and consuming much of the available complement component 3 (C3). The result is a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. This results in hypocomplementemia, a low C3 level in serum. o Serum sickness is typically self-limited and resolves within days.",
