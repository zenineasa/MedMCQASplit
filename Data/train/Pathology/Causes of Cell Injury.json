        "question": "Which of the following is not a free radical scavenger -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Xanthine oxidase o Glutathione peroxidase is primarily a scavanger of free radicals and catalyzes free radical breakdown (does not generates free radicals). o Superoxide dismutase is also a scavenger of free radical and converts superoxide into H, Ov Howrever, it is indirectly involved in generation of free radicals (see previous explanation). So, you keep in mind that SOD is primarily an antioxidant (free radical scavenger). But for this question, we can consider SOD to be involved in generation of free radicals (indirectly)as we have better option for our answer (glutathione peroxidase). Free radicals. Generation of free radicalso H. O. - MPO - Halide system#NADPH oxidase#Myeloperoxidaseo Heber- Weiss reactiono Fenton's reactiono Xanthine oxidase.
