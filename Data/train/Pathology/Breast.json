On the other hand, among the concordant cases, the cailage cap in osteochondroma was significantly less thick than in low- and high-grade secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma. Therefore, our study showed that a multidisciplinary approach integrating clinical and radio graphical features and the size of the cailaginous cap in combination with a histological assessment are crucial to the diagnosis of cailaginous tumors.
