The term diabetic nephropathy is applied to the conglomerate of lesions that occur in the diabetic kidney. Most common lesions involve the glomeruli and are associated clinically with three glomerular syndromes; Non-nephrotic proteinuria. Nephrotic syndrome. Chronic renal failure. Diabetes also affects the arterioles (causing hyalinizing arteriolar sclerosis), increases susceptibility to the development of pyelonephritis and particularly papillary necrosis, and causes a variety of tubular lesions. The morphologic changes in the glomeruli include. Capillary basement membrane thickening. Diffuse mesangial sclerosis. Nodular glomerulosclerosis (Kimme- Istiel-Wilson lesions).

Focal Only some of the glomeruli are involved. Segmental - Only part of an entire glomerulus is involved. Glomerulosclerosis - Refers to scarring of the glomerulus. Depending on the cause it is broadly classified as:-Primary. When no underlying cause is found; usually presents as nephrotic syndrome. Secondary. When an underlying cause is identified, usually presents with kidney failure and proteinuria. This is actually a heterogenous group including numerous causes such as:- - Infections such as HIV (HIV associated nephropathy). Toxins and drugs such as heroin's predominate. Familial forms. Secondary to nephron loss and hyperfiltration such as with chronic pyelonephritis and reflux, morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus. Pathological variants. Five mutually exclusive variants of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis may be distinguished by the pathological findings seen on renal biopsy:-Collapsing variant. Glomerular tip lesion variant. Cellular variant. Perihilar variant. Not otherwise specified variant (NOS). The NOS variant is the most common subtype. Recognition of these variants has prognostic value in individual with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The collapsing variant is associated with higher rate of progression to end stage renal disease whereas Glomerular tip lesion variant has low rate of progression to end stage renal disease in most patients. Cellular variant shows similar clinical presentation to collapsing and glomerular tip variant but has intermediate outcomes between these two variants.

        "exp": "Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th edition. Explanation: RAPIDLY PROGRESSIVE (CRESCENTIC. GLOMERULONEPHRITIS (RPGN)RPGN is form of severe glomerular injury which does not denote to a specific etiologyit is characterized clinically bv rapid and progressive loss of renal function associated with severe oliguria and signs of nephritic syndrome. If untreated, death from renal failure occurs within weeks to months. The most common histologic picture is the presence of crescents in most of the glomeruli (crescentic glomerulonephritis. These crescents are produced by the proliferation of the parietal epithelial cells lining Bowman capsule and by the infiltration of monocytes and macrophages. Classification of RPGNTYPE I (ANTI-GBM ANTIBODY). Renal limited. Goodpasture syndrome. TYPE II (IMMUNE COMPLEX). Idiopathic. Post-infectious glomerulonephritis. Lupus nephritis. Henoch-Schonlein purpura. IgA nephropathy. TYPE III (PAUCI -IMMUNE)ANCA-associated. Idiopathic. Wegener granulomatosis Microscopic polvangiitis. First type of RPGN is anti-GBM antibody- induced disease. It characterized by linear deposits of IgG and. in many cases. C3 in the GBM that are visualized by immunofluorescence. In some of these patients, the anti-GBM antibodies cross-react w ith pulmonary alveolar basement membranes to produce the clinical picture of pulmonary hemorrhage associated with renal failure (Goodpasture syndrome). Plasmapheresis to remove the pathogenic circulating antibodies is usually part of the treatment, which also includes therapy to suppress the underlying immune response. Second type of RPGN is due to immune complex deposition. It can be a complication of any of the immune complex nephritides, including postinfectious glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, and Henoch. Schonlein purpura. In all these cases, immunofluorescence studies reveal the granular pattern of staining characteristic of immune complex deposition. This type of RPGN frequently demonstrates cellular proliferation within the glomerular tuft, in addition to crescent formation. The third type of RPGN, is defined by the lack of anti-GBM antibodies or immune complexes by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Most patients with this type of RPGN have circulating anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) that produce cytoplasmic (c) or perinuclear (p) staining patterns. Morphology. The kidneys are enlarged and pale, often with petechial hemorrhages on the cortical surfaces. Depending on the cause, the glomeruli may show focal necrosis, diffuse or focal endothelial proliferation, and mesangial proliferation. The histologic picture is characteristics by the presence of distinctive crescents. Crescents are formed by proliferation of parietal cells and by migration of monocytes and macrophages inti} the urinary space. The crescents eventually obliterate Bowman space and compress the glomerular tuft. Fibrin strands are frequently prominent between the eel hilar layers in the crescents. The escape of fibrinogen into Bowman space and its conversion to fibrin are an important contributor to crescent formation.",
