These neurotoxic substances may then contribute to morphologic changes in astrocytes. In cirrhosis, astrocytes may undergo Alzheimer type II astrocytosis. Here, astrocytes become swollen. They may develop a large pale nucleus, a prominent nucleolus, and margination of chromatin. In ALF, astrocytes may also become swollen. The changes of Alzheimer type II astrocytosis are not seen in ALF. But, in contrast to cirrhosis, astrocyte swelling in ALF may be so marked as to produce brain edema.

These initial changes typically occur in the mucosal lymphoid tissue. In more active disease (As the inflammatoy process worsens), aphthous lesions tend to coalesce and deepen, forming stellate or bear-claw-shaped ulcers. With progression of disease, stellate ulcerations fuse longitudinally and transversely outlining areas of uninvolved mucosa give rise to a cobblestone appearance (demarcate islands of mucosa that frequently are histologically normal). This &; cobblestone&; appearance is characteristic of CD, both endoscopically and by barium radiography. With progression of disease the disease eventually becomes transmural: Serosal and mesenteric inflammatory promotes adhesions and fistula formation. The bowel wall thickens and becomes narrowed and fibrotic, leading to chronic, recurrent bowel obstructions. Projections of the thickened mesentery encase the bowel (\"creeping fat\") Although Pseudohyperophy are typical of Ulcerative colitis, they may also be seen in Crohn&; s disease: Inflammatory Pseudohyperophy representing isolated islands of regenerating mucosa can also form in CD (as in UC).

On the basis of the last two features, the disease has also come to be termed as 'bronze diabetes'.

They consist of numerous small to medium-sized irregularly shaped, often branched dilated ductules with flattened lining and bland nuclei, embedded in a dense fibrotic tissue.

In most individuals, the main pancreatic duct (the duct of Wirsung) joins the common bile duct just proximal to the papilla of Vater, and the accessory pancreatic duct (the duct of Santorini) drains into the duodenum through a separate minor papilla. Pancreas divisum is caused by a failure of fusion of the fetal duct systems of the dorsal and ventral pancreatic primordia. As a result, the bulk of the pancreas (formed by the dorsal pancreatic primordium) drains into the duodenum through the small-caliber minor papilla. The duct of Wirsung in persons with divisum drains only a small poion of the head of the gland through the papilla of Vater. Ref: Robbins Pathology; 9th edition; Page no: 884",

The condition is inherited as an autosomal dominant character. The defect in bilirubin metabolism is complex and appears to be reduced activity of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase with decreased conjugation, or an impaired hepatic uptake of bilirubin. The jaundice is usually mild and intermittent. MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES: There are no morphologic abnormalities in the liver except some increased lipofuscin pigment in centrilobular hepatocytes.

The largest ducts have chronic inflammation with superimposed acute inflammation, very similar to the mucosal lesions of ulcerative colitis. These inflamed areas lead to narrowing of the larger ducts either because edema and inflammation narrows the lumen or because of subsequent scarring. The smaller ducts, however, often have little in the way of inflammation and show a striking circumferential fibrosis often referred to as onion skinning around an increasingly atrophic duct lumen Eventually the lumen disappears altogether, leaving just a dense button of scar tissue, the viually diagnostic tombstone scar. Because the likelihood of sampling such smaller duct lesions on a random needle biopsy is minuscule, diagnosis depends not on biopsy but on radiologic imaging of the extrahepatic and largest intrahepatic ducts.
