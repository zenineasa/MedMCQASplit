Her family history reveals that her mother died of endometrial cancer at age 50, while her 42-year-old brother was recently diagnosed with coloncancer. You begin to suspect a familial cancer syndrome. What gene is most likely to be mutated in this family",
        "exp": "The answer is C. This family likely has hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) syndrome or Lynch syndrome. This syndrome is due to defects in DNA mismatch repair genes, with MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 representing the primary culprits. -WT-1 mutations predispose patients to Wilms tumors and a variety of other defects -APC is mutated in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) -Germline mutations in p53 are seen in Li Fraumeni syndrome -BRCA-1 mutations predispose women to breast carcinoma",

Laboratory studies show iron deficiency anemia, with a serum hemoglobin level of 7. 4 g/dL. Stool specimens are positive for occult blood. Colonoscopy discloses an ulcerating lesion of the cecum. Which of the following serum tumor markers is most likely to be useful for following this patient after surgery?",
        "exp": "Colorectal cancer is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Most common sign is occult blood in feces, especially when the tumor is in the proximal poion of the colon. Adenocarcinomas of the colon usually express CEA, a glycoprotein that is released into the circulation and serves as a serologic marker for these tumors. CEA is also found in association with malignant tumors of the pancreas, lung, and ovary. -AFP (choice A) is expressed by hepatocellular carcinoma and yolk sac tumors. -Chromogranin (choice D) is expressed by neuroendocrine tumors. -Chorionic gonadotropin (choice C) is secreted by choriocarcinoma.",
