In Burkitt lymphoma, involved tissues are effaced by a diffuse infiltrate of intermediate-sized lymphoid cells. Cells have high mitotic index, numerous apoptotic cells are seen The apoptotic remnants are phagocytosed by many tingible body macrophages which have abundant clear cytoplasm, scattered in between tumour cells giving rise to a 'starry-sky' pattern. Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma (non-endemic/non-African) most often appears as a mass involving the ileocecum and peritoneum. The tumour cells are mature B cells that express surface IgM, CD19, CD20, CD10, and BCL6, a phenotype consistent with a germinal center B-cell origin. All forms of Burkitt lymphoma are associated with translocations of the MYC gene on chromosome 8. MYC translocation paner is usually IGH locus, but may also be Ig k or Ig l light chain loci.",
