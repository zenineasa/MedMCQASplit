Total CK activity is not a reliable marker of cardiac injury since various isoforms of CK are also found in brain, myocardium, and skeletal muscle. However, the CK-MB isoform--principally derived from myocardium, but also present at low levels in skeletal muscle--is the more specific indicator of heart damage. CK-MB activity begins to rise within 2 to 4 hours of MI, peaks at 24 to 48 hours, and returns to normal within approximately 72 hours. (Robbins Basic pathology, 9th edition. pg no. 382)",

The lungs are heavy and boggy, and microscopically show perivascular and interstitial transudates, alveolar septal edema, and accumulation of edema fluid in the alveolar spaces. In addition, variable numbers of red cells extravasate from the leaky capillaries into alveolar spaces, where they are phagocytosed by macrophages The subsequent breakdown of red cells and hemoglobin leads to the appearance of hemosiderin-laden alveolar macrophages-- so-called heart failure cells--that reflect previous episodes of pulmonary edema.
