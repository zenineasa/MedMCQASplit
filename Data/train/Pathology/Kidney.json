        "exp": "Ans. A. Can be diagnosed intrauterine. Explanation. Clinical features of ARPKD (Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease) are: Classic ARPKD is generally diagnosed in utero or within the neonatal period and characterized by greatly enlarged echogenic kidneys in diseased fetuses. (Option a). Reduced fetal urine production may contribute to oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia. About 30% of affected neonates die shortly after birth due to respiratory insufficiency. Close to 60% of mortality occurs within the first month of life. In the classic group, most patients are bom with renal insufficiency and ESRD (End stage renal disease). (Option b). However, infants often have a transient improvement in their GFR; death from renal insufficiency at this stage is rare. Some patients are diagnosed after the neonatal stage and form the older group. Morbidity and mortality in this group often involve systemic hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, and liver manifestations. The hallmarks of ARPKD liver disease are biliary dysgenesis due to a primary ductal plate malformation with associated periportal fibrosis, namely congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) and dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts (Caroli's disease). CHF and Caroli's disease can then lead to portal hypertension exhibiting hepatosplenomegaly, variceal bleeding, and cholangitis. Some patients with the diagnosis of ARPKD at 1 year of age with nephromegaly exhibit slowly declining renal function over 20 years with only minimally enlarged kidneys at ESRD (Option c and e) and markedly atrophic kidneys following renal transplantation. The slow progression of renal disease is likely due to increasing fibrosis rather than the development of cysts. Systemic hypertension is common in all ARPKD patients, even those with normal renal function. (option d)",

Release of which of the following substances most likely participated in the elevation of BUN, creatinine, and reduced urinary output?",
        "exp": "The most common cause of acute tubular necrosis is ischemic injury. The hypotension that develops after myocardial infarction causes decreased renal blood flow, with intrarenal vasoconstriction. Sublethal endothelial injury from reduced renal blood flow leads to the increased release of the vasoconstrictor endothelin and diminished amounts of the vasodilators nitric oxide and prostaglandin. The ischemic form of acute tubular injury is often accompanied by the rupture of the basement membrane (tubulorrhexis). An initiating phase that lasts approximately 1 day is followed by a maintenance phase during which progressive oliguria and increasing blood urea nitrogen levels occur, with salt and water overload. This is followed by a recovery phase, during which there is a steady increase in urinary output and hypokalemia. Eventually, the tubular function is restored. Treatment of this acute renal failure results in the recovery of nearly all patients. Aldosterone plays a role in sodium absorption. Erythropoietin drives RBC production. Natriuretic peptide increases when there is congestive heart failure, but does not lead to renal ischemia. Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) controls free water clearance.",

Anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane Antibody (Type I) Crescentic Glomerulonephritis* Anti-GBM antibody crescentic glomerulonephritis, or type I Cr. GN, is characterized by linear deposits of IgG and, in many cases, C3 on the GBM, as described above. In some of these individuals the anti-GBM antibodies also bind to pulmonary alveolar capillary basement membranes to produce the clinical picture of pulmonary hemorrhages associated with renal failure. These persons are said to have Goodpasture syndrome, to distinguish their condition from socalled idiopathic cases in which renal involvement occurs in the absence of pulmonary disease. Anti-GBM antibodies are present in the serum and are helpful in diagnosis. It is important to recognize type I Cr. GN because these individuals benefit from plasmapheresis, which removes pathogenic antibodies from the circulation.* Immune Complex-Mediated (Type II) Crescentic Glomerulonephritis* Type II Cr. GNs are immune complex-mediated disorders. This can be a complication of any of the immune complex nephritides, including poststreptococcal GN, SLE, IgA nephropathy, and Henoch-Schonlein purpura. In some cases, immune complexes can be demonstrated but the underlying cause is undetermined. In all of these cases, immunofluorescence studies reveal the characteristic granular (\"lumpy bumpy\") pattern of staining of the GBM and/or mesangium for immunoglobulin and/or complement. These individuals cannot usually be helped by plasmapheresis. Pauci-Immune (Type III) Crescentic Glomerulonephritis. Type III Cr. GN, also called pauci-immune type Cr. GN, is defined by the lack of anti-GBM antibodies or significant immune complex deposition detectable by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Most of these individuals have antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in the serum, which, as we have seen, have a role in some vasculitides. Therefore, in some cases type III Cr. GN is a component of a systemic vasculitis such as microscopic polyangiitis or Wegener granulomatosis. In many cases, however, pauci-immune Cr. GN is limited to the kidney and is thus called idiopathic",

Proteinuria is generally more selective (albumin > globulins) than in the nephrotic syndrome caused by other diseases, but there is too much overlap for this selectivity to be used as a diagnostic criterion. This disease is characterized pathologically by fusion (effacement) of visceral epithelial foot processes; however, this can be visualized only by electron microscopy. Minimal change glomerulopathy is successfully treated with corticosteroids and does not progress to renal failure. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the cause of nephrotic syndrome in 10% of children and 30% of adults.

Harrison's 17th/pg. 1789......... \"Henoch-Schonlein purpura is distinguished clinically from IgA nephropathy by prominent systemic symptoms, a younger age (<20 years old), preceding infection, and abdominal complaints. Deposits of IgA are also found in the glomerular mesangium in a variety of systemic diseases, including chronic liver disease, Crohn's disease, gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma, chronic obstructive bronchiectasis, idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, dermatitis herpetiformis, mycosis fungoides, leprosy, ankylosing spondylitis, relapsing polychondritis, and Sjogren's syndrome. IgA deposition in these entities is not usually associated with clinically significant glomerular inflammation or renal dysfunction and thus is not called IgA nephropathy\"Discussion: IgA nephropathy:# Berger first described it. It is classically characterized by episodic hematuria with the deposition of IgA in the mesangium. IgA nephropathy is one of the most common forms of glomerulonephritis worldwide. There is a male preponderance, a peak incidence in the second and third decades, and rare familial clustering.# The two most common presentations of IgA nephropathy are recurrent episodes of macroscopic hematuria during or immediately following an upper respiratory infection in children (Henoch-Schonlein purpura) or asymptomatic microscopic hematuria most often seen in adults.# Rx: - ACE inhibitors in patients with proteinuria or declining renal function.- Tonsillectomy, steroid therapy, and fish oil have all been suggested to benefit some patients.- When presenting as RPGN, patients need steroids, cytotoxic agents, and plasmapheresis. RENAL INVOLVEMENT in Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) and Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)# Microscopic hematuria (78%) and subnephrotic proteinuria (75%) are the most consistent findings.# The characteristic lesion in HUS/TTP is thrombotic microangiopathy.# Microthrombi are demonstrated in renal arterioles and capillaries.# In TTP, microthrombi are composed mainly of platelet aggregates and thin layer of fibrin and stain strongly for v. WF, implicated in its pathogenesis. In contrast, microthrombi in HUS contain predominantly fibrin.# Subendothelial hyaline deposits and endothelial cell swelling also contribute to vascular occlusion. Glomerular lesions are ischemic. The glomerular capillary walls are wrinkled, the glomerular tuft may be atrophied, and the Bowman capsule is thickened. Acute cortical or tubular necrosis may occur.# Immunofluorescence studies invariably demonstrate fibrinogen along the glomerular capillary walls and in arterial thrombi. Granular deposits of C3 and IgM may be observed in vessel walls and glomeruli.# Electron-microscopic studies demonstrate swelling of the glomerular endothelial cells and detachment from the glomerular basement membrane.",

Membranoproliferative GN (MPGN) is manifested histologically by alterations in the GBM and mesangium and by proliferation of glomerular cells. It accounts for 5% to 10% of cases of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children and adults. Some individuals present only with hematuria or proteinuria in the non-nephrotic range; others have a combined nephrotic-nephritic picture. Two major types of MPGN (I and II) are recognized on the basis of distinct ultrastructural, immunofluorescence microscopic, and pathogenic findings. Of the two types, type I is far more common (~ 80% of cases). The Nephrotic Syndrome# The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria, which results in hypoalbuminemia and edema. Podocyte injury is an underlying mechanism of proteinuria, and may be the result of nonimmune causes (as in MCD and FSGS) or immune mechanisms (Membranoproliferative variety).# Minimal change disease (MCD) is the most frequent cause of nephrotic syndrome in children; it is manifested by proteinuria and effacement of glomerular foot processes without antibody deposits; the pathogenesis is unknown; the disease responds well to steroid therapy.# Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) may be primary (podocyte injury by unknown mechanisms) or secondary (e. g. as a consequence of prior glomerulonephritis, hypertension or infection such as HIV); glomeruli show focal obliteration of capillary lumens, hyaline deposits and loss of foot processes; the disease is often resistant to therapy and may progress to end stage renal disease.# Membranous nephropathy (MN) is caused by an autoimmune response against an unknown renal antigen; it is characterized by granular subepithelial deposits of antibodies with GBM thickening and loss of foot processes but little or no inflammation; the disease is often resistant to steroid therapy.
