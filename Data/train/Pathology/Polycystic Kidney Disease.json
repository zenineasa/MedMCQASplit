Rupture of these aneurysms is the most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Aeriovenous fistulas are often secondary to trauma. Dissecting aneurysm is associated with hypertension or with diseases affecting the vascular media, most notably Marfan syndrome. Syphilitic (luetic) aneurysm is associated with teiary syphilis.",
