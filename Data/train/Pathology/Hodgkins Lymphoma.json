These are positive for CD 15 and CD 30, and also PAX-5 (B-cell transcription factor). o Hodgkin's disease is characterized by presence of Reed-sternberg cells (Classical Reed-sternberg cells) and its variants. o They can also be found in reactive lymphadenopathy (such as infectious mononucleosis immunoblasts which are RS like in appearance], carbamazepine associated lymphadenopathy) and very rarely in other types of non-Hodgkin lymphofnas. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma may also show RS like cells.",

The neoplastic cells of Hodgkins disease, both classic Reed-stemberg cell and Reed-sterberg variants, tend to stain positively with these antibodies. o In addition R. S. cells of lymphocytic predominant cells are also positive for CD20. o Atypical cells can be seen in some types of Hodgkins disease, but they are not diagnostic.",
