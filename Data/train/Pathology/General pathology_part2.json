        "exp": "Ceain drugs are impoant in the control of acute inflammation because they inhibit poions of the metabolic pathways involving arachidonic acid. For example, coicosteroids induce the synthesis of lipocoins, a family of proteins that are inhibitors of phospholipase A2. They decrease the formation of arachidonic acid and its metabolites, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Aspirin, indomethacin, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in contrast, inhibit cyclooxygenase and therefore inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The prostaglandins have several impoant functions. For example, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), produced within the anterior hypothalamus in response to interleukin 1 secretion from leukocytes, results in fever. Therefore aspirin can be used to treat fever by inhibiting PGE2 production. PGE2 is also a vasodilator that can keep a ductus aeriosus open. At bih, breathing decreases pulmonary resistance and reverses the flow of blood through the ductus aeriosus. The oxygenated blood flowing from the aoa into the ductus inhibits prostaglandin production and closes the ductus aeriosus. Therefore prostaglandin E2 can be given clinically to keep the ductus aeriosus open, while indomethacin can be used to close a patent ductus. Prostaglandin F2 (PGF2) causes uterine contractions, which can result in dysmenorrhea. Indomethacin can be used to treat dysmenorrhea by inhibiting the production of PGF2. Bradykinin is a nonapeptide that increases vascular permeability, contracts smooth muscle, dilates blood vessels, and causes pain. It is pa of the kinin system and is formed from high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK). Histamine, a vasoactive amine that is stored in mast cells, basophils, and platelets, acts on H1 receptors to cause dilation of aerioles and increased vascular permeability of venules.

When somatic cells replicate, a small section of the telomere is not duplicated and telomeres become progressively shoened. As the telomeres become shoer, the ends of chromosomes cannot be protected and areseen as broken DNA, which signals cell cycle arrest. Telomere length is maintained by nucleotide addition mediated by an enzyme called telomerase. Telomerase is a specialized RNA-protein complex that uses its own RNA as a template for adding nucleotides to the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase activity is expressed in germ cells and is present at low levels in stem cells, but it is absent in most somatic tissues.

        "exp": "MHC class I molecules are one of two primary classes of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (the other being MHC class II) and are found on the cell surface of all nucleated cells in the bodies of jawed veebrates. They also occur on platelets, but not on red blood cells. Their function is to display peptide fragments of non-self proteins from within the cell to cytotoxic T cells; this will trigger an immediate response from the immune system against a paicular non-self antigen displayed with the help of an MHC class I protein. Because MHC class I molecules present peptides derived from cytosolic proteins, the pathway of MHC class I presentation is often called cytosolic or endogenous pathway. In humans, the HLAs corresponding to MHC class I are HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. Function Class I MHC molecules bind peptides generated mainly from degradation of cytosolic proteins by the proteasome. The MHC I: peptide complex is then inseed endoplasmic reticulum into the external plasma membrane of the cell. The epitope peptide is bound on extracellular pas of the class I MHC molecule. Thus, the function of the class I MHC is to display intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). However, class I MHC can also present peptides generated from exogenous proteins, in a process known as cross-presentation. A normal cell will display peptides from normal cellular protein turnover on its class I MHC, and CTLs will not be activated in response to them due to central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms. When a cell expresses foreign proteins, such as after viral infection, a fraction of the class I MHC will display these peptides on the cell surface. Consequently, CTLs specific for the MHC: peptide complex will recognize and kill presenting cells. Alternatively, class I MHC itself can serve as an inhibitory ligand for natural killer cells (NKs). Reduction in the normal levels of surface class I MHC, a mechanism employed by some viruses and ceain tumors to evade CTL responses, activates NK cell killing. PirB and Visual Plasticity Paired-immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB), an MHCI-binding receptor, is involved in the regulation of visual plasticity. PirB is expressed in the central nervous system and diminishes ocular dominance plasticity in the developmental critical period and adulthood. When the function of PirB was abolished in mutant mice, ocular dominance plasticity became more pronounced at all ages. PirB loss of function mutant mice also exhibited enhanced plasticity after monocular deprivation during the critical period. These results suggest PirB may be involved in modulation of synaptic plasticity in the visual coex.",

        "question": "Toll like receptors, recognize bacterial products and stimulates immune response by -",
        "exp": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key role in the innate immune system. They are single, membrane-spanning, non-catalytic receptors usually expressed in sentinel cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes. Once these microbes have breached physical barriers such as the skin or intestinal tract mucosa, they are recognized by TLRs, which activate immune cell responses. The TLRs include TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13, though the latter two are not found in humans. The ability of immune system to recognize molecules that are broadly shared by pathogens is, in pa, due to the presence of Immune receptors called toll-like receptors (TLRs) that are expressed on the membranes of leukocytes including dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, cells of the adaptive immunity (T and B lymphocytes) and non immune cells (epithelial and endothelial cells, and fibroblasts). The binding of ligands - either in the form of adjuvant used in vaccinations or in the form of invasive moieties during times of natural infection - to the TLR marks the key molecular events that ultimately lead to innate immune responses and the development of antigen-specific acquired immunity. Upon activation, TLRs recruit adapter proteins (proteins that mediate other protein-protein interactions) within the cytosol of the immune cell in order to propagate the antigen-induced signal transduction pathway. These recruited proteins are then responsible for the subsequent activation of other downstream proteins, including protein kinases (IKKi, IRAK1, IRAK4, and TBK1) that fuher amplify the signal and ultimately lead to the upregulation or suppression of genes that orchestrate inflammatory responses and other transcriptional events. Some of these events lead to cytokine production, proliferation, and survival, while others lead to greater adaptive immunity. If the ligand is a bacterial factor, the pathogen might be phagocytosed and digested, and its antigens presented to CD4+ T cells. In the case of a viral factor, the infected cell may shut off its protein synthesis and may undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). Immune cells that have detected a virus may also release anti-viral factors such as interferons. Toll-like receptors have also been shown to be an impoant link between innate and adaptive immunity through their presence in dendritic cells.

The histological type of lung cancer is generally dependent on the associated syndrome, the two most common of which are humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy in squamous cell carcinoma and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in small cell lung cancer. The symptoms often precede the diagnosis of the associated lung cancer, especially when the symptoms are neurologic or dermatologic. The proposed mechanisms of paraneoplastic processes include the aberrant release of humoral mediators, such as hormones and hormone-like peptides, cytokines, and antibodies. Treating the underlying cancer is generally the most effective therapy for paraneoplastic syndromes, and treatment soon after symptom onset appears to offer the best potential for symptom improvement.

Beginning in childhood or early adulthood, most people with NARP experience numbness, tingling, or pain in the arms and legs (sensory neuropathy); muscle weakness; and problems with balance and coordination (ataxia). Many affected individuals also have vision loss caused by changes in the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (the retina). In some cases, the vision loss results from a condition called retinitis pigmentosa. This eye disease causes the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually to deteriorate. Learning disabilities and developmental delays are often seen in children with NARP, and older individuals with this condition may experience a loss of intellectual function (dementia). Other features of NARP include seizures, hearing loss, and abnormalities of the electrical signals that control the heabeat (cardiac conduction defects). These signs and symptoms vary among affected individuals.",

This form of retinal dystrophy manifests initial symptoms independent of age; thus, RP diagnosis occurs anywhere from early infancy to late adulthood. Patients in the early stages of RP first notice compromised peripheral and dim light vision due to the decline of the rod photoreceptors. The progressive rod degeneration is later followed by abnormalities in the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the deterioration of cone photoreceptor cells. As peripheral vision becomes increasingly compromised, patients experience progressive \"tunnel vision\" and eventual blindness. Affected individuals may additionally experience defective light-dark adaptations, nyctalopia (night blindness), and the accumulation of bone spicules in the fundus. Although most genetic diseases are inherited from parents, this is not always the case. When a genetic disease occurs without any family history or genetic defects in the parents, the disease is called a sporadic genetic disease",

Because type I collagen is a major component of extracellular matrix in other pas of the body, there are also numerous extraskeletal manifesta- tions (affecting skin, joints, teeth, and eyes, for example). The mutations underlying OI characteristically involve the coding sequences for a1 or a2 chains of type I collagen. Because collagen synthesis and extracellular expo require formation of a complete and intact triple helix, any primary defect in a collagen chain tends to disrupt the entire structure and results in its premature degradation (an example of a dominant negative mutation) (Chapter 6). As a consequence, most defects manifest as autosomal domi- nant disorders and may be associated with severe malformations. There is, however, a broad spectrum of severity, and mutations that result in qualitatively normal collagen but at only reduced levels generally have milder manifestations. The fundamental abnormality in all forms of OI is too little bone, resulting in extreme skeletal fragility. Four major sub- types are recognized. The type II variant is uniformly fatal in utero or immediately postpaum as a consequence of multiple fractures that occur before bih. By contrast, patients with type I OI have a normal lifespan, with only a modestly increased proclivity for fractures during child- hood (decreasing in frequency after pubey). The classic finding of blue sclerae in type I OI is attributable to decreased scleral collagen content; this deficit causes a relative trans- parency that allows the underlying choroid to be seen. Hearing loss can be related to conduction defects in the middle and inner ear bones, and small misshapen teeth are a result of dentin deficiency. Ref Robbins 9/e p767",

A combination of symptoms may include seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, and lung and kidney disease. TSC is caused by a mutation of either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which code for the proteins hamain and tuberin, respectively. These proteins act as tumor growth suppressors, agents that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. TSC is a genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, variable expressivity, and complete penetrance. Two-thirds of TSC cases result from sporadic genetic mutations, not inheritance, but their offspring may inherit it from them. Current genetic tests have difficulty locating the mutation in roughly 20% of individuals diagnosed with the disease. So far, it has been mapped to two genetic loci, TSC1 and TSC2.",

Makes the cells able to withstand stress. Metaplasia is thought to arise by reprogramming of stem cells to differentiate along a new pathway. May result in reduced function or increased propensity for malignant transformation Two types - squamous metaplasia & columnar metaplasia. Squamous metaplasia: The normal columnar epithelial cells are focally or widely replaced by squamous epithelial cells. Eg: Chronic smokers - to survive the noxious chemicals in cigarette smoke Squamous metaplasia - columnar epithelial changes to squamous type. Eg: In chronic gastric reflux, the normal stratified squamous epithelium of lower oesophagus undergoes metaplastic transformation to gastric or intestinal type columnar epithelium. Metaplasia may also occur in mesenchymal cells but in these situations, it is generally a reaction to some pathologic alteration not an adaptive response to stress. Epithelial metaplasia is exemplified by the squamous change that occurs in the respiratory epithelium of habitual cigarette smokers (Fig. 1-5). The normal ciliated columnar epithelial cells of the trachea and bronchi are focally or widely replaced by stratified squamous epithelial cells. The rugged stratified squamous epithelium may be able to survive the noxious chemicals in cigarette smoke that the more fragile specialized epithelium would not tolerate. Although the metaplastic squamous epithelium has survival advantages, impoant protective mechanisms are lost, such as mucus secretion and ciliary clearance of paiculate matter. Epithelial metaplasia is therefore a double-edged sword. Moreover, the influences that induce metaplastic change, if persistent may predispose to malignant transformation of the epithelium In fact, squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium often coexists with lung cancers composed of malignant squamous cells. It is thought that cigarette smoking initially causes squamous metaplasia, and cancers arise later in some of these altered foci. Since vitamin A is essential for normal epithelial differentiation, its deficiency may also induce squamous metaplasia in the respiratory Refer robbins 9/e p5",

        "exp": "The type and distribution of necrotic hepatocytes is often a clue as to the cause of the hepatic injury. Focal scattered necrosis is characteristic of viral hepatitis, but may also be seen with bacterial infections or other toxic insults. In focal necrosis, there is necrosis of single hepatocytes, or small clusters of hepatocytes, that is randomly located in some, but not all, of the liver lobules. In contrast, zonal necrosis refers to the finding of hepatocellular necrosis in identical areas in all of the liver lobules. There are basically three types of zonal necrosis. Centrilobular (acinar zone 3) necrosis is characteristic of ischemic injury (heart failure or shock), toxic effects (acetaminophen toxicity), carbon tetrachloride exposure, or chloroform ingestion. Drugs such as acetaminophen may be metabolized in zone 1 to toxic compounds that cause necrosis of zone 3 hepatocytes because they receive the blood from zone 1. Midzonal (zone 2) necrosis is quite rare, but may be seen in yellow fever, while peripoal (zone 1) necrosis is seen in phosphorus poisoning or eclampsia. Submassive necrosis refers to liver cell necrosis that crosses the normal lobular boundaries. Classically the necrosis goes from poal areas to central veins (or vice versa) and is called bridging necrosis. If the hepatocellular necrosis is severe, it is called massive necrosis. This type of extensive necrosis is described as acute yellow atrophy, as grossly the liver appears soft, yellow, flabby, and decreased in size with a wrinkled capsule. It may be produced by hepatitis viruses (usually B or C), drugs, or chemicals. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",

Harshmohan textbook of pathology 7th edition Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), described next, is an illustrative model of T cell-mediated inflammation and tissue injury. The same reactions are the underlying basis for several diseases. Contact dermatitis is an example of tissue injury resulting from T cell-mediated inflammation. It is evoked by contact with pentadecylcatechol (also known as urushiol, the active component of poison ivy and poison oak, which probably becomes antigenic by binding to a host protein). On reexposure of a previously exposed person to the plants, sensitized TH1 CD4+ cells accumulate in the dermis and migrate toward the antigen within the epidermis. Here they release cytokines that damage kera- tinocytes, causing separation of these cells and formation of an intraepidermal vesicle, and inflammation manifested as a vesicular dermatitis. It has long been thought that several systemic diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and mul- tiple sclerosis, are caused by TH1 and TH17 reactions against self antigens, and Crohn disease may be caused by uncon- trolled reactions involving the same T cells but directed against intestinal bacteria. T cell-mediated inflammation also plays a role in the rejection of transplants, described later in the chapter. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 118",

The most common areas in which it occurs are the pelvis, the femur, the humerus, the ribs and clavicle (collar bone). Since a common genetic locus is responsible for a large percentage of Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors, these are sometimes grouped together in a category known as the Ewing family of tumors. The diseases are, however, considered to be different: peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumours are generally not associated with bones, while Ewing sarcomas are most commonly related to bone. Ewing's sarcoma occurs most frequently in teenagers and young adults, with a male/female ratio of 1. 6 Although usually classified as a bone tumour, Ewing's sarcoma can have characteristics of both mesodermal and ectodermal origin, making it difficult to classify. James Ewing (1866-1943) first described the tumour, establishing that the disease was separate from lymphoma and other types of cancer known at that time. CD99 antigen (Cluster of differentiation 99), also known as MIC2 or single-chain type-1 glycoprotein, is a heavily O-glycosylated transmembrane protein that is encoded by the CD99 gene in humans.

It may also mediate the attachment of stem cells to bone marrow extracellular matrix or directly to stromal cells. The CD34 protein is a member of a family of single-pass transmembrane sialomucin proteins that show expression on early hematopoietic and vascular-associated tissue. However, little is known about its exact function. CD34 is also an impoant adhesion molecule and is required for T cells to enter lymph nodes. It is expressed on lymph node endothelia, whereas the L-selectin to which it binds is on the T cell. Conversely, under other circumstances CD34 has been shown to act as molecular \"Teflon\" and block mast cell, eosinophil and dendritic cell precursor adhesion, and to facilitate opening of vascular lumens. Finally, recent data suggest CD34 may also play a more selective role in chemokine-dependent migration of eosinophils and dendritic cell precursors.

Upon release in close proximity to a cell slated for killing, perforin forms pores in the cell membrane of the target cell, creating an aqueous channel through which the granzymes and associated molecules can enter, inducing either apoptosis or osmotic cell lysis. The distinction between apoptosis and cell lysis is impoant in immunology: lysing a virus-infected cell could potentially only release the virions, whereas apoptosis leads to destruction of the virus inside. a-defensins, antimicrobial molecules, are also secreted by NK cells, and directly kill bacteria by disrupting their cell walls in a manner analogous to that of neutrophils",

The microvasculature becomes more permeable, and protein-rich fluid moves into the extravascular tissues. As stasis develops, leukocytes (principally neutrophils) begin to accumulate along the vascular endothelial surface--a process called margination. Increased Vascular Permeability. Several mechanisms may contribute to increased vascular permeability in acute inflammatory reactions are. Endothelial cell contraction leading to intercellular gaps in postcapillary venules is the most common cause of increased vascular permeability. Endothelial injury results in vascular leakage by causing endothelial cell necrosis and detachment. Increased transcytosis of proteins by way of an intracellular vesicular pathway augments venular permeability. Leakage from new blood vessels. ( Robbins Basic Pathology, 9th edition, page 33 )",

Symptoms vary between people and may be mild to severe. Common symptoms include painful and swollen joints, fever, chest pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, feeling tired, and a red rash which is most commonly on the face. Often there are periods of illness, called flares, and periods of remission when there are few symptoms. Treatments may include NSAIDs, coicosteroids, immunosuppressants, hydroxychloroquine, and methotrexate. Alternative medicine has not been shown to affect the disease. Life expectancy is lower among people with SLE. SLE significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease with this being the most common cause of death. With modern treatment about 80% of those affected survive more than 15 years. Women with lupus have pregnancies that are higher risk but are mostly successful.",

It results in various small molecules of metabolism being passed into the urine instead of being reabsorbed from the tubular fluid (for example, glucose, amino acids, uric acid, phosphate, and bicarbonate). Fanconi syndrome affects the proximal tubules, namely, the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), which is the first pa of the tubule to process fluid after it is filtered through the glomerulus, and the proximal straight tubule (pars recta), which leads to the descending limb of the loop of Henle. Different forms of Fanconi syndrome can affect different functions of the proximal tubule, and result in different complications. The loss of bicarbonate results in type 2 or proximal renal tubular acidosis. The loss of phosphate results in the bone diseases rickets and osteomalacia (even with adequate vitamin D and calcium levels), because phosphate is necessary for bone development in children and even for ongoing bone metabolism in adults.",

Benign tumors of the liver include hemangiomas (the most common), focal nodular hyperplasias, nodular regenerative hyperplasias, and adenomas. Hemangiomas are characterized by numerous small endotheliallined spaces filled with blood. The lack of erythrocytes or blood would raise the possibility of the lesion being a lymphangioma, while pleomorphic or atypical endothelial cells would suggest the possibility of an angiosarcoma. Focal nodular hyperplasia, which has a characteristic gross appearance of a central stellate scar within the tumor, microscopically reveals hepatic nodules surrounded by fibrous bands having numerous proliferating bile ducts. This type of tumor is related to bih-control pills, but has no association with malignancy. In contrast, nodular regenerative hyperplasia involves the entire liver and forms multiple spherical nodules. Histologic sections reveal plump hepatocytes surrounded by rims of atrophic cells. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia is clinically impoant because it is associated with the subsequent development of poal hypertension. Two types of hepatic adenomas are the liver cell adenoma and the bile duct adenoma. Liver cell adenomas are seen in female patients taking bih-control pills. These adenomas may bleed, but are not associated with malignancy. Histologically, cords of hepatocytes are present, but there is no lobular architecture.

Antigen antibody(immune) complexes that are formed in circulation may deposit in blood vessels leads to complement activation and acute inflammation. Antigen-antibody (immune) complexes that are formed in the circulation may deposit in blood vessels, leading to complement activation and acute inflammation. The antigens in these com- plexes may be exogenous antigens, such as microbial pro- teins, or endogenous antigens, such as nucleoproteins. The mere formation of immune complexes does not equate with hypersensitivity disease; small amounts of antigen- antibody complexes may be produced during normal immune responses and are usually phagocytosed and destroyed. It is only when these complexes are produced in large amounts, persist, and are deposited in tissues that they are pathogenic. Pathogenic immune complexes may form in the circulation and subsequently deposit in blood vessels, or the complexes may form at sites where antigen has been planted (in situ immune complexes). Immune complex-mediated injury is systemic when complexes are formed in the circulation and are deposited in several organs, or it may be localized to paicular organs (e. g., kidneys, joints, or skin) if the complexes are formed and deposited in a specific site. The mechanism of tissue injury is the same regardless of the pattern of distribution; however, the sequence of events and the conditions leading to the formation of systemic and local immune complexes are different and are considered separately in the following descriptions.

The average age of patients at diagnosis is 2 years old. The World Health Organization has included JMML in the category of myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative disorders. Diagnosis Edit The following criteria are required in order to diagnose JMML: All 3 of the following: No Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL fusion gene. Peripheral blood monocytosis >1 x 109/L. Less than 20% blasts (including promonocytes) in the blood and bone marrow (blast count is less than 2% on average) Two or more of the following criteria: Hemoglobin F increased for age. Immature granulocytes and nucleated red cells in the peripheral blood. White blood cell count >10 x 109/L. Clonal chromosomal abnormality (e. g., monosomy 7). Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitors in vitro. These criteria are identified through blood tests and bone marrow tests. Blood tests: A complete blood count (CBC) will be performed on a child suspected of having JMML and throughout the treatment and recovery of a child diagnosed with JMML.

        "exp": "* Shrinkage in the size of the cell by the loss of cell substance is known as atrophy * Although atrophied cells have diminished its function, they are not dead Shrinkage in the size of the cell by the loss of cell substance is known as atrophy. When a sufficient number of cells are involved, the entire tissue or organ diminishes in size, becoming atrophic (Fig. 1-4). Although atrophic cells may have diminished function, they are not dead. Causes of atrophy include a decreased workload (e. g., immobilization of a limb to permit healing of a fracture), loss of innervation, diminished blood supply, inadequate nutrition, loss of endocrine stimulation, and aging (senile atrophy). Although some of these stimuli are physiologic (e. g., the loss of hormone stimulation in menopause) and others pathologic (e. g., denervation), the fundamental cel- lular changes are identical. They represent a retreat by the cell to a smaller size at which survival is still possible; a new equilibrium is achieved between cell size and dimin- ished blood supply, nutrition, or trophic stimulation. The mechanisms of atrophy consist of a combination of decreased protein synthesis and increased protein degradation in cells. * Protein synthesis decreases because of reduced meta- bolic activity. * The degradation of cellular proteins occurs mainly by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Nutrient deficiency and disuse may activate ubiquitin ligases, which attach mul- tiple copies of the small peptide ubiquitin to cellular proteins and target them for degradation in protea- somes. This pathway is also thought to be responsible for the accelerated proteolysis seen in a variety of cata- bolic conditions, including the cachexia associated with cancer. * In many situations, atrophy is also accompanied by increased autophagy, with resulting increases in the number of autophagic vacuoles. Autophagy (\"self-eating\") is the process in which the starved cell eats its own components in an attempt to survive. We describe this process later in the chapter. Refer robbins 9/e p4-5",

A-T affects many pas of the body: It impairs ceain areas of the brain including the cerebellum, causing difficulty with movement and coordination. It weakens the immune system, causing a predisposition to infection. It prevents repair of broken DNA, increasing the risk of cancer. A-T is caused by a defect in the ATM gene, which is responsible for managing the cell's response to multiple forms of stress including double-strand breaks in DNA. In simple terms, the protein produced by the ATM gene recognizes that there is a break in DNA, recruits other proteins to fix the break, and stops the cell from making new DNA until the repair is complete.",

Its vasoactive effects are mediated mainly binding to receptors, called H1 receptors, on microvascular endothelial cells. The antihistamine drugs that are commonly used to treat some inflammatory reactions, such as allergies, are H1 receptor antagonists that bind to and block the receptor.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have shown that transient hypoxia-ischaemia leads to a biphasic disruption of cerebral energy metabolism. Related to this biphasic energy failure, two waves of cell death seem to follow hypoxic-ischaemic injury in the developing brain. Immediate neuronal death is probably largely due to necrosis, resulting mainly from the accumulation of calcium ions, leading to membrane pump failure. 41 Delayed cell death resulting from hypoxic-ischaemic injury seems to involve different or additional mechanisms and a growing body of data suggests that in the delayed phase of injury cell death occurs by apoptosis. In the developing nervous system apoptosis is observed as early as neural tube formation and persists throughout terminal differentiation of the neural network. apoptosis in neural cells. Neurotrophin withdrawal leads to death by a default mechanism through as yet uncharacterised pathways. Gene mutations, inappropriate production of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, free radical generation, and mitochondrial damage also trigger apoptosis as do engagement of death receptors. In the latter case oligomerisation of Fas/Apo-1 or TNF receptors or the p75 NGF receptor results in the recruitment of death domain proteins, which in turn activate members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases in an organised proteolytic cascade. Bcl-2 family members and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) control the decision to commit cell suicide, depending on whether pro- or anti-apoptotic paners predominate. In the later stages, specific endonucleases cleave DNA as pa of the packaging process. Finally, cells are phagocytosed by healthy neighbours",

These drugs have revolutionized treatment of this disease and allow most patients to have a good quality of life when compared to the former chemotherapy drugs.

Autosomal Dominant Inheritance Familial hypercholesterolemia Huntington disease Marfan syndrome Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Hereditary spherocytosis Neurofibromatosis, type 1 Adult polycystic kidney disease Familial Hypercholesterolemia Familial hypercholesterolemia is among the most common mendelian disorders; the frequency of the heterozygous condition is 1 in 500 in the general population. It is caused by a mutation in the LDLR gene that encodes the receptor for low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the form in which 70% of total plasma cholesterol is transpoed. A brief review of the synthesis and transpo of cholesterol follows. Normal Cholesterol Metabolism. Cholesterol may be derived from the diet or from endogenous synthesis. Dietary triglycerides and cholesterol are incorporated into chylomicrons in the intestinal mucosa, which drain by way of the gut lymphatics into the blood. These chylomicrons are hydrolyzed by an endothelial lipoprotein lipase in the capillaries of muscle and fat. The chylomicron remnants, rich in cholesterol, are then delivered to the liver. Some of the cholesterol enters the metabolic pool (to be described), and some is excreted as free cholesterol or bile acids into the biliary tract. The endogenous synthesis of cholesterol and LDL begins in the liver (Fig. 6-2). The first step in the synthesis of LDL is the secretion of triglyceride-rich very- low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) by the liver into the blood. In the capillaries of adipose tissue and muscle, the VLDL paicle undergoes lipolysis and is conveed to intermediate- density lipoprotein (IDL). In comparison with VLDL, the content of triglyceride is reduced and that of cholesteryl esters enriched in intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), but IDL retains on its surface two of the three VLDL- associated apolipoproteins B-100 and E. Fuher metabo- lism of IDL occurs along two pathways: Most of the IDL paicles are directly taken up by the liver through the LDL receptor described later; others are conveed to cholesterol- rich LDL by a fuher loss of triglycerides and apolipopro- tein E. In the liver cells, IDL is recycled to generate VLDL. Two thirds of the resultant LDL paicles are metabo- lized by the LDL receptor pathway, and the rest is metabo- lized by a receptor for oxidized LDL (scavenger receptor), to be described later. The LDL receptor binds to apolipo- proteins B-100 and E and thus is involved in the transpo of both LDL and IDL. Although the LDL receptors are widely distributed, approximately 75% are located on hepatocytes, so the liver plays an extremely impoant role in LDL metabolism. The first step in the receptor-mediated transpo of LDL involves binding to the cell surface receptor, followed by endocy- totic internalization inside so-called \"clathrin-coated pits\" (Fig. 6-3). Within the cell, the endocytic vesicles fuse with the lysosomes, and the LDL molecule is enzymatically degraded, resulting ultimately in the release of free cholesterol into the cytoplasm. The cholesterol not only is used by the cell for membrane synthesis but also takes pa in intracel- lular cholesterol homeostasis by a sophisticated system of feed- back control: * It suppresses cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthetic pathway. * It stimulates the formation of cholesterol esters for storage of excess cholesterol. * It downregulates the synthesis of cell surface LDL recep- tors, thus protecting cells from excessive accumulation of cholesterol. The transpo of LDL by the scavenger receptors, alluded to earlier, seems to take place in cells of the mononuclear- phagocyte system and possibly in other cells as well. Monocytes and macrophages have receptors for chemically modified (e. g., acetylated or oxidized) LDLs. The amount catabolized by this \"scavenger receptor\" pathway is directly related to the plasma cholesterol level. (Robbins Basic Pathology, 9th edition, pg no. 219)",

        "exp": "Cell injury occurs due to decreased generation of cellular ATP ATP is necessary for Na+--K+ ATPase pump and Ca pump action and many other cellular functions for the existence of the cell THE MORPHOLOGY OF CELL AND TISSUE INJURY It is useful to describe the structural alterations that occur in damaged cells before we discuss the biochemical mecha- nisms that bring about these changes. All stresses and noxious influences exe their effects first at the molecular or biochemical level. Cellular function may be lost long before cell death occurs, and the morphologic changes of cell injury (or death) lag far behind both (Fig. 1-7). For example, myocardial cells become noncontractile after 1 to 2 minutes of isch- emia, although they do not die until 20 to 30 minutes of ischemia have elapsed. These myocytes may not appear dead by electron microscopy for 2 to 3 hours, or by light microscopy for 6 to 12 hours. The cellular derangements of reversible injury can be corrected, and if the injurious stimulus abates, the cell can return to normalcy. Persistent or excessive injury, however, causes cells to pass the nebulous \"point of no return\" into irreversible injury and cell death. The events that determine when reversible injury becomes irreversible and progresses to cell death remain poorly understood. The clinical rele- vance of this question is obvious; if the biochemical and molecular changes that predict cell death can be identified with precision, it may be possible to devise strategies for preventing the transition from reversible to irreversible cell injury. Although there are no definitive morphologic or biochemical correlates of irreversibility, two phenomena con- sistently characterize irreversibility: the inability to correct mito- chondrial dysfunction (lack of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation) even after resolution of the original injury, and profound disturbances in membrane function. As mentioned earlier, injury to lysosomal membranes results in the enzymatic dissolution of the injured cell, which is the culmination of injury progressing to necrosis. As mentioned earlier, different injurious stimuli may induce death by necrosis or apoptosis (Fig. 1-6 and Table Refer robbins 9/e p6",

However, it is impoant to know that some of the proteins essential to normal mitochondrial function are produced by the nuclear genome, and are subsequently transpoed to the mitochondria for use. As such, mutations in these proteins can result in mitochondrial disorders, but can be inherited from both male and female parent in the typical fashion. The disease can manifest in both sexes. This condition is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance and heteroplasmy. This pattern of inheritance applies to genes contained in mitochondrial DNA. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, only females pass mitochondrial conditions to their children. Mitochondrial disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass mitochondrial traits to their children. In most cases, people with MELAS inherit an altered mitochondrial gene from their mother. Less commonly, the disorder results from a new mutation in a mitochondrial gene and occurs in people with no family history of MELAS.",
