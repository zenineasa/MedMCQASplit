        "exp": "MHC class I molecules are one of two primary classes of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (the other being MHC class II) and are found on the cell surface of all nucleated cells in the bodies of jawed veebrates. They also occur on platelets, but not on red blood cells. Their function is to display peptide fragments of non-self proteins from within the cell to cytotoxic T cells; this will trigger an immediate response from the immune system against a paicular non-self antigen displayed with the help of an MHC class I protein. Because MHC class I molecules present peptides derived from cytosolic proteins, the pathway of MHC class I presentation is often called cytosolic or endogenous pathway. In humans, the HLAs corresponding to MHC class I are HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. Function Class I MHC molecules bind peptides generated mainly from degradation of cytosolic proteins by the proteasome. The MHC I: peptide complex is then inseed endoplasmic reticulum into the external plasma membrane of the cell. The epitope peptide is bound on extracellular pas of the class I MHC molecule. Thus, the function of the class I MHC is to display intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). However, class I MHC can also present peptides generated from exogenous proteins, in a process known as cross-presentation. A normal cell will display peptides from normal cellular protein turnover on its class I MHC, and CTLs will not be activated in response to them due to central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms. When a cell expresses foreign proteins, such as after viral infection, a fraction of the class I MHC will display these peptides on the cell surface. Consequently, CTLs specific for the MHC: peptide complex will recognize and kill presenting cells. Alternatively, class I MHC itself can serve as an inhibitory ligand for natural killer cells (NKs). Reduction in the normal levels of surface class I MHC, a mechanism employed by some viruses and ceain tumors to evade CTL responses, activates NK cell killing. PirB and Visual Plasticity Paired-immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB), an MHCI-binding receptor, is involved in the regulation of visual plasticity. PirB is expressed in the central nervous system and diminishes ocular dominance plasticity in the developmental critical period and adulthood. When the function of PirB was abolished in mutant mice, ocular dominance plasticity became more pronounced at all ages. PirB loss of function mutant mice also exhibited enhanced plasticity after monocular deprivation during the critical period. These results suggest PirB may be involved in modulation of synaptic plasticity in the visual coex.",

Study results indicate that superior cervical ganglia neurons that express both p75. NTR and TrkA die when treated with pro. NGF, while NGF treatment of these same neurons results in survival and axonal growth. Survival and PCD mechanisms are mediated through adaptor protein binding to the death domain of the p75.

NF-kB regulates nuclear gene transcription to promote cell survival. Alternatively, programmed cell death occurs when TRAF6 and neurotrophin receptor interacting factor (NRIF) are both recruited to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK); which phosphorylates c-Jun.

        "exp": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key role in the innate immune system. They are single, membrane-spanning, non-catalytic receptors usually expressed in sentinel cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes. Once these microbes have breached physical barriers such as the skin or intestinal tract mucosa, they are recognized by TLRs, which activate immune cell responses. The TLRs include TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13, though the latter two are not found in humans. The ability of immune system to recognize molecules that are broadly shared by pathogens is, in pa, due to the presence of Immune receptors called toll-like receptors (TLRs) that are expressed on the membranes of leukocytes including dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, cells of the adaptive immunity (T and B lymphocytes) and non immune cells (epithelial and endothelial cells, and fibroblasts). The binding of ligands - either in the form of adjuvant used in vaccinations or in the form of invasive moieties during times of natural infection - to the TLR marks the key molecular events that ultimately lead to innate immune responses and the development of antigen-specific acquired immunity. Upon activation, TLRs recruit adapter proteins (proteins that mediate other protein-protein interactions) within the cytosol of the immune cell in order to propagate the antigen-induced signal transduction pathway. These recruited proteins are then responsible for the subsequent activation of other downstream proteins, including protein kinases (IKKi, IRAK1, IRAK4, and TBK1) that fuher amplify the signal and ultimately lead to the upregulation or suppression of genes that orchestrate inflammatory responses and other transcriptional events. Some of these events lead to cytokine production, proliferation, and survival, while others lead to greater adaptive immunity. If the ligand is a bacterial factor, the pathogen might be phagocytosed and digested, and its antigens presented to CD4+ T cells. In the case of a viral factor, the infected cell may shut off its protein synthesis and may undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). Immune cells that have detected a virus may also release anti-viral factors such as interferons. Toll-like receptors have also been shown to be an impoant link between innate and adaptive immunity through their presence in dendritic cells.

The histological type of lung cancer is generally dependent on the associated syndrome, the two most common of which are humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy in squamous cell carcinoma and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in small cell lung cancer. The symptoms often precede the diagnosis of the associated lung cancer, especially when the symptoms are neurologic or dermatologic. The proposed mechanisms of paraneoplastic processes include the aberrant release of humoral mediators, such as hormones and hormone-like peptides, cytokines, and antibodies. Treating the underlying cancer is generally the most effective therapy for paraneoplastic syndromes, and treatment soon after symptom onset appears to offer the best potential for symptom improvement.

In some cases, the vision loss results from a condition called retinitis pigmentosa. This eye disease causes the light-sensing cells of the retina gradually to deteriorate. Learning disabilities and developmental delays are often seen in children with NARP, and older individuals with this condition may experience a loss of intellectual function (dementia).

Because type I collagen is a major component of extracellular matrix in other pas of the body, there are also numerous extraskeletal manifesta- tions (affecting skin, joints, teeth, and eyes, for example). The mutations underlying OI characteristically involve the coding sequences for a1 or a2 chains of type I collagen. Because collagen synthesis and extracellular expo require formation of a complete and intact triple helix, any primary defect in a collagen chain tends to disrupt the entire structure and results in its premature degradation (an example of a dominant negative mutation) (Chapter 6). As a consequence, most defects manifest as autosomal domi- nant disorders and may be associated with severe malformations. There is, however, a broad spectrum of severity, and mutations that result in qualitatively normal collagen but at only reduced levels generally have milder manifestations. The fundamental abnormality in all forms of OI is too little bone, resulting in extreme skeletal fragility. Four major sub- types are recognized. The type II variant is uniformly fatal in utero or immediately postpaum as a consequence of multiple fractures that occur before bih. By contrast, patients with type I OI have a normal lifespan, with only a modestly increased proclivity for fractures during child- hood (decreasing in frequency after pubey). The classic finding of blue sclerae in type I OI is attributable to decreased scleral collagen content; this deficit causes a relative trans- parency that allows the underlying choroid to be seen. Hearing loss can be related to conduction defects in the middle and inner ear bones, and small misshapen teeth are a result of dentin deficiency. Ref Robbins 9/e p767",

The change from one type of cell to another may be pa of a normal maturation process, or caused by some so of abnormal stimulus. In simplistic terms, it is as if the original cells are not robust enough to withstand their environment, so they transform into another cell type better suited to their environment. If the stimulus causing metaplasia is removed or ceases, tissues return to their normal pattern of differentiation. Metaplasia is not synonymous with dysplasia, and is not considered to be an actual cancer. It is also contrasted with heteroplasia, which is the spontaneous abnormal growth of cytologic and histologic elements. Today, metaplastic changes are usually considered to be an early phase of carcinogenesis, specifically for those with a history of cancers or who are known to be susceptible to carcinogenic changes. Metaplastic change is often viewed as a premalignant condition that requires immediate intervention, either surgical or medical, because metaplasia is associated with cancer.",

Opsonisation with Opsonins: Opsonins are specific proteins in the serum that enhance the process of phagocytosis by coating the surface of target bacteria or microorganisms.

The efficiency of phagocytosis is greatly enhanced when microbes are opsonized by these proteins Phagocytes such as Neutrophils express high affinity receptors for opsonin protein.

Germline mosaicism can be present at the same time as somatic mosaicism or individually depending on when the conditions occur. Pure germline mosaicism refers to mosaicism found exclusively in the gametes and not in any somatic cells. Germline mosaicism can be caused either by a mutation that occurs after conception, or by epigenetic regulation, alterations to DNA such as methylation that do not involve changes in the DNA coding sequence. A mutation in an allele acquired by a somatic cell early in its development can be passed on to its daughter cells, including those that later specialize to gametes. With such mutation within the gamete cells, a pair of medically typical individuals may have repeated succession of children who suffer from ceain genetic disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophyand osteogenesis imperfectabecause of germline mosaicism. It is possible for parents unaffected by germline mutations to produce an offspring with an autosomal dominant (AD) disorder due to a random new mutation within one's gamete cells known as sporadic mutation; however, if these parents produce more than one child with an AD disorder, germline mosaicism is more likely the cause than a sporadic mutation.

APS provokes blood clots (thrombosis) in both aeries and veins as well as pregnancy-related complications such as miscarriage, stillbih, preterm delivery, and severe preeclampsia. The diagnostic criteria require one clinical event, i. e. thrombosis or pregnancy complication, and two antibody blood tests spaced at least three months apa that confirm the presence of either lupus anticoagulant, or anti-b2-glycoprotein-I (since b2-glycoprotein-I antibodies are a subset of anti-cardiolipin antibodies, an anti-cardiolipin assay can be performed as a less specific proxy). Antiphospholipid syndrome can be primary or secondary. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome occurs in the absence of any other related disease. Secondary antiphospholipid syndrome occurs with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In rare cases, APS leads to rapid organ failure due to generalised thrombosis; this is termed \"catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome\" (CAPS or Asherson syndrome) and is associated with a high risk of death.",

Makes the cells able to withstand stress. Metaplasia is thought to arise by reprogramming of stem cells to differentiate along a new pathway. May result in reduced function or increased propensity for malignant transformation Two types - squamous metaplasia & columnar metaplasia. Squamous metaplasia: The normal columnar epithelial cells are focally or widely replaced by squamous epithelial cells. Eg: Chronic smokers - to survive the noxious chemicals in cigarette smoke Squamous metaplasia - columnar epithelial changes to squamous type. Eg: In chronic gastric reflux, the normal stratified squamous epithelium of lower oesophagus undergoes metaplastic transformation to gastric or intestinal type columnar epithelium. Metaplasia may also occur in mesenchymal cells but in these situations, it is generally a reaction to some pathologic alteration not an adaptive response to stress. Epithelial metaplasia is exemplified by the squamous change that occurs in the respiratory epithelium of habitual cigarette smokers (Fig. 1-5). The normal ciliated columnar epithelial cells of the trachea and bronchi are focally or widely replaced by stratified squamous epithelial cells. The rugged stratified squamous epithelium may be able to survive the noxious chemicals in cigarette smoke that the more fragile specialized epithelium would not tolerate. Although the metaplastic squamous epithelium has survival advantages, impoant protective mechanisms are lost, such as mucus secretion and ciliary clearance of paiculate matter. Epithelial metaplasia is therefore a double-edged sword. Moreover, the influences that induce metaplastic change, if persistent may predispose to malignant transformation of the epithelium In fact, squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium often coexists with lung cancers composed of malignant squamous cells. It is thought that cigarette smoking initially causes squamous metaplasia, and cancers arise later in some of these altered foci. Since vitamin A is essential for normal epithelial differentiation, its deficiency may also induce squamous metaplasia in the respiratory Refer robbins 9/e p5",

Focal scattered necrosis is characteristic of viral hepatitis, but may also be seen with bacterial infections or other toxic insults. In focal necrosis, there is necrosis of single hepatocytes, or small clusters of hepatocytes, that is randomly located in some, but not all, of the liver lobules. In contrast, zonal necrosis refers to the finding of hepatocellular necrosis in identical areas in all of the liver lobules. There are basically three types of zonal necrosis. Centrilobular (acinar zone 3) necrosis is characteristic of ischemic injury (heart failure or shock), toxic effects (acetaminophen toxicity), carbon tetrachloride exposure, or chloroform ingestion. Drugs such as acetaminophen may be metabolized in zone 1 to toxic compounds that cause necrosis of zone 3 hepatocytes because they receive the blood from zone 1. Midzonal (zone 2) necrosis is quite rare, but may be seen in yellow fever, while peripoal (zone 1) necrosis is seen in phosphorus poisoning or eclampsia. Submassive necrosis refers to liver cell necrosis that crosses the normal lobular boundaries. Classically the necrosis goes from poal areas to central veins (or vice versa) and is called bridging necrosis. If the hepatocellular necrosis is severe, it is called massive necrosis. This type of extensive necrosis is described as acute yellow atrophy, as grossly the liver appears soft, yellow, flabby, and decreased in size with a wrinkled capsule. It may be produced by hepatitis viruses (usually B or C), drugs, or chemicals. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",

If the allele inherited from the father is imprinted, it is thereby silenced, and only the allele from the mother is expressed. If the allele from the mother is imprinted, then only the allele from the father is expressed. Forms of genomic imprinting have been demonstrated in fungi, plants and animals. As of 2014, there are about 150 imprinted genes known in the mouse and about half that in humans. Genomic imprinting is an inheritance process independent of the classical Mendelian inheritance. It is an epigenetic process that involves DNA methylation and histone methylation without altering the genetic sequence. These epigenetic marks are established (\"imprinted\") in the germline (sperm or egg cells) of the parents and are maintained through mitotic cell divisions in the somatic cells of an organism. Appropriate imprinting of ceain genes is impoant for normal development. Human diseases involving genomic imprinting include Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome.",

Harshmohan textbook of pathology 7th edition Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), described next, is an illustrative model of T cell-mediated inflammation and tissue injury. The same reactions are the underlying basis for several diseases. Contact dermatitis is an example of tissue injury resulting from T cell-mediated inflammation. It is evoked by contact with pentadecylcatechol (also known as urushiol, the active component of poison ivy and poison oak, which probably becomes antigenic by binding to a host protein). On reexposure of a previously exposed person to the plants, sensitized TH1 CD4+ cells accumulate in the dermis and migrate toward the antigen within the epidermis. Here they release cytokines that damage kera- tinocytes, causing separation of these cells and formation of an intraepidermal vesicle, and inflammation manifested as a vesicular dermatitis. It has long been thought that several systemic diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and mul- tiple sclerosis, are caused by TH1 and TH17 reactions against self antigens, and Crohn disease may be caused by uncon- trolled reactions involving the same T cells but directed against intestinal bacteria. T cell-mediated inflammation also plays a role in the rejection of transplants, described later in the chapter. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 118",

Since a common genetic locus is responsible for a large percentage of Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors, these are sometimes grouped together in a category known as the Ewing family of tumors. The diseases are, however, considered to be different: peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumours are generally not associated with bones, while Ewing sarcomas are most commonly related to bone. Ewing's sarcoma occurs most frequently in teenagers and young adults, with a male/female ratio of 1. 6 Although usually classified as a bone tumour, Ewing's sarcoma can have characteristics of both mesodermal and ectodermal origin, making it difficult to classify. James Ewing (1866-1943) first described the tumour, establishing that the disease was separate from lymphoma and other types of cancer known at that time. CD99 antigen (Cluster of differentiation 99), also known as MIC2 or single-chain type-1 glycoprotein, is a heavily O-glycosylated transmembrane protein that is encoded by the CD99 gene in humans. The protein has a mass of 32 kD.

CD34 is a cluster of differentiation first described independently by Civin et al. and Tindle et al. in a cell surface glycoprotein and functions as a cell-cell adhesion factor. It may also mediate the attachment of stem cells to bone marrow extracellular matrix or directly to stromal cells. The CD34 protein is a member of a family of single-pass transmembrane sialomucin proteins that show expression on early hematopoietic and vascular-associated tissue. However, little is known about its exact function. CD34 is also an impoant adhesion molecule and is required for T cells to enter lymph nodes. It is expressed on lymph node endothelia, whereas the L-selectin to which it binds is on the T cell. Conversely, under other circumstances CD34 has been shown to act as molecular \"Teflon\" and block mast cell, eosinophil and dendritic cell precursor adhesion, and to facilitate opening of vascular lumens. Finally, recent data suggest CD34 may also play a more selective role in chemokine-dependent migration of eosinophils and dendritic cell precursors. Regardless of its mode of action, under all circumstances CD34, and its relatives podocalyxin and endoglycan, facilitates cell migration.",

Several mechanisms may contribute to increased vascular permeability in acute inflammatory reactions are. Endothelial cell contraction leading to intercellular gaps in postcapillary venules is the most common cause of increased vascular permeability.

[Cytochrome c is a component of the electron transpo chain in mitochondria. The heme group of cytochrome c accepts electrons from the bc1 complex and transfers electrons to the complex IV. Cytochrome c is also involved in initiation of apoptosis. Upon release of cytochrome c to the cytoplasm, the protein binds apoptotic protease activating factor-1 Cytochrome c can also catalyze several redox reactions such as hydroxylation and aromatic oxidation, and shows peroxidase activity by oxidation of various electron donors such as 2, 2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), 2-keto-4-thiomethyl butyric acid and 4-aminoantipyrine. A bacterial cytochrome c functions as a nitrite reductase. [",

        "exp": "Sickle-cell disease (SCD) is a group of blood disorders typically inherited from a person's parents. The most common type is known as sickle-cell anemia (SCA). It results in an abnormality in the oxygen-carrying protein hemoglobin (hemoglobin S) found in red blood cells. This leads to a rigid, sickle-like shape under ceain circumstances. Problems in sickle cell disease typically begin around 5 to 6 months of age. A number of health problems may develop, such as attacks of pain (\"sickle-cell crisis\"), anemia, swelling in the hands and feet, bacterial infections, and stroke. Long term pain may develop as people get older. The average life expectancy in the developed world is 40 to 60 years. Sickle-cell disease occurs when a person inherits two abnormal copies of the hemoglobin gene, one from each parent. This gene occurs in chromosome 11. Several subtypes exist, depending on the exact mutation in each hemoglobin gene.] An attack can be set off by temperature changes, stress, dehydration, and high altitude. A person with a single abnormal copy does not usually have symptoms and is said to have sickle-cell trait. Such people are also referred to as carriers. Diagnosis is by a blood test and some countries test all babies at bih for the disease. Diagnosis is also possible during pregnancy. Refer robbins 9/e p413",

These adenocarcinomas sta within the pa of the pancreas which makes digestive enzymes. Several other types of cancer, which collectively represent the majority of the non-adenocarcinomas, can also arise from these cells.

Benign tumors of the liver include hemangiomas (the most common), focal nodular hyperplasias, nodular regenerative hyperplasias, and adenomas. Hemangiomas are characterized by numerous small endotheliallined spaces filled with blood. The lack of erythrocytes or blood would raise the possibility of the lesion being a lymphangioma, while pleomorphic or atypical endothelial cells would suggest the possibility of an angiosarcoma. Focal nodular hyperplasia, which has a characteristic gross appearance of a central stellate scar within the tumor, microscopically reveals hepatic nodules surrounded by fibrous bands having numerous proliferating bile ducts. This type of tumor is related to bih-control pills, but has no association with malignancy. In contrast, nodular regenerative hyperplasia involves the entire liver and forms multiple spherical nodules. Histologic sections reveal plump hepatocytes surrounded by rims of atrophic cells. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia is clinically impoant because it is associated with the subsequent development of poal hypertension. Two types of hepatic adenomas are the liver cell adenoma and the bile duct adenoma. Liver cell adenomas are seen in female patients taking bih-control pills. These adenomas may bleed, but are not associated with malignancy. Histologically, cords of hepatocytes are present, but there is no lobular architecture.

Antigen-antibody (immune) complexes that are formed in the circulation may deposit in blood vessels, leading to complement activation and acute inflammation. The antigens in these com- plexes may be exogenous antigens, such as microbial pro- teins, or endogenous antigens, such as nucleoproteins. The mere formation of immune complexes does not equate with hypersensitivity disease; small amounts of antigen- antibody complexes may be produced during normal immune responses and are usually phagocytosed and destroyed. It is only when these complexes are produced in large amounts, persist, and are deposited in tissues that they are pathogenic. Pathogenic immune complexes may form in the circulation and subsequently deposit in blood vessels, or the complexes may form at sites where antigen has been planted (in situ immune complexes). Immune complex-mediated injury is systemic when complexes are formed in the circulation and are deposited in several organs, or it may be localized to paicular organs (e. g., kidneys, joints, or skin) if the complexes are formed and deposited in a specific site. The mechanism of tissue injury is the same regardless of the pattern of distribution; however, the sequence of events and the conditions leading to the formation of systemic and local immune complexes are different and are considered separately in the following descriptions.

Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) hypersensitivity of myeloid progenitors in vitro. These criteria are identified through blood tests and bone marrow tests. Blood tests: A complete blood count (CBC) will be performed on a child suspected of having JMML and throughout the treatment and recovery of a child diagnosed with JMML.

        "exp": "* Shrinkage in the size of the cell by the loss of cell substance is known as atrophy * Although atrophied cells have diminished its function, they are not dead Shrinkage in the size of the cell by the loss of cell substance is known as atrophy. When a sufficient number of cells are involved, the entire tissue or organ diminishes in size, becoming atrophic (Fig. 1-4). Although atrophic cells may have diminished function, they are not dead. Causes of atrophy include a decreased workload (e. g., immobilization of a limb to permit healing of a fracture), loss of innervation, diminished blood supply, inadequate nutrition, loss of endocrine stimulation, and aging (senile atrophy). Although some of these stimuli are physiologic (e. g., the loss of hormone stimulation in menopause) and others pathologic (e. g., denervation), the fundamental cel- lular changes are identical. They represent a retreat by the cell to a smaller size at which survival is still possible; a new equilibrium is achieved between cell size and dimin- ished blood supply, nutrition, or trophic stimulation. The mechanisms of atrophy consist of a combination of decreased protein synthesis and increased protein degradation in cells. * Protein synthesis decreases because of reduced meta- bolic activity. * The degradation of cellular proteins occurs mainly by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Nutrient deficiency and disuse may activate ubiquitin ligases, which attach mul- tiple copies of the small peptide ubiquitin to cellular proteins and target them for degradation in protea- somes. This pathway is also thought to be responsible for the accelerated proteolysis seen in a variety of cata- bolic conditions, including the cachexia associated with cancer. * In many situations, atrophy is also accompanied by increased autophagy, with resulting increases in the number of autophagic vacuoles. Autophagy (\"self-eating\") is the process in which the starved cell eats its own components in an attempt to survive. We describe this process later in the chapter. Refer robbins 9/e p4-5",

        "exp": "The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a set of cell surface proteins essential for the acquired immune system to recognize foreign molecules in veebrates, which in turn determines histocompatibility. The main function of MHC molecules is to bind to antigens derived from pathogens and display them on the cell surface for recognition by the appropriate T-cells. MHC molecules mediate interactions of leukocytes, also called white blood cells (WBCs), which are immune cells, with other leukocytes or with body cells. The MHC determines compatibility of donors for organ transplant, as well as one's susceptibility to an autoimmune disease crossreacting immunization. The human MHC is also called the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) complex (often just the HLA). The mouse MHC is called the H-2 complex or H-2. In a cell, protein molecules of the host's own phenotype or of other biologic entities are continually synthesized and degraded. Each MHC molecule on the cell surface displays a molecular fraction of a protein, called an epitope. The presented antigen can be either self or non-self, thus preventing an organism's immune system targeting its own cells. In its entirety, the MHC population is like a meter indicating the balance of proteins within the cell. The MHC gene family is divided into three subgroups: class I, class II, and class III. Class I MHC molecules have b2 subunits so can only be recognised by CD8 co-receptors. Class II MHC molecules have b1 and b2 subunits and can be recognised by CD4 co-receptors. In this way MHC molecules chaperone which type of lymphocytes may bind to the given antigen with high affinity, since different lymphocytes express different TCR co-receptors. Diversity of antigen presentation, mediated by MHC classes I and II, is attained in at least three ways: (1) an organism's MHC repeoire is polygenic ( multiple, interacting genes); (2) MHC expression is codominant (from both sets of inherited alleles); MHC gene variants are highly polymorphic (diversely varying from organism to organism within a species). Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection has been observed in male mice making mate choices of females with different MHCs and thus demonstrating sexual selection. Also, at least for MHC I presentation, there has been evidence of antigenic peptide splicing which can combine peptides from different proteins, vastly increasing antigen diversity. [",

It is a catalytic subunit of the cyclin-dependent kinase complex, whose activity is restricted to the G1-S phase of the cell cycle, and is essential for the G1/S transition. This protein associates with and is regulated by the regulatory subunits of the complex including cyclin E or A. Cyclin E binds G1 phase Cdk2, which is required for the transition from G1 to S phase while binding with Cyclin A is required to progress through the S phase. Its activity is also regulated by phosphorylation. Two alternatively spliced variants and multiple transcription initiation sites of this gene have been repoed.

Thrombomodulin is also expressed on human mesothelial cell, monocyte and a dendritic cell subset. Thrombomodulin functions as a cofactor in the thrombin-induced activation of protein C in the anticoagulant pathway by forming a 1: 1 stoichiometric complex with thrombin. This raises the speed of protein C activation thousandfold. Thrombomodulin-bound thrombin has procoagulant effect at the same time by inhibiting fibrinolysis by cleaving thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI, aka carboxypeptidase B2) into its active form. Thrombomodulin is a glycoprotein on the surface of endothelial cells that, in addition to binding thrombin, regulates C3b inactivation by factor I.

Somatic mosaicism, a type of genetic mosaicism found in somatic cells, and germline mosaicism can be present at the same time or individually depending on when the conditions occur. When the mosaicism is only found in the gametes and not in any somatic cells, it is referred to as pure germline mosaicism. Germline mosaicism can be caused either by a mutation that occurs after conception, or by epigenetic regulation, alterations to DNA such as methylation that do not involve changes in the DNA coding sequence. A mutation in an allele acquired by a somatic cell early in its development can be passed on to its daughter cells, including those that later specialize to gametes. It can also be caused by a sporadic mutation in a gamete cell. If the germline mosaicism causing mutation occurs in the somatic cell, it never results in pure germline mosaicism because it will be present in somatic cells as well.",

The application of these assays is con sidered with many of the speci c forms of neoplasia dis cussed in other chapters, so only a few examples suf ce here. PSA, used to screen for prostatic adenocarcinoma, may be one of the most frequently and successfully used tumor markers in clinical practice. Prostatic carcinoma can be suspected when elevated levels of PSA are found in the blood. However, PSA screening also highlights problems encountered with use of viually every tumor marker. Although PSA levels often are elevated in cancer, PSA levels also may be elevated in benign prostatic hyperplasia (Chapter 17). Fuhermore, there is no PSA level that ensures that a patient does not have prostate cancer. Thus, the PSA test suffers from both low sensitivity and low speci city. PSA assay is extremely valuable, however, for detecting residual disease or recurrence following treatment for prostate cancer. Other tumor markers occasionally used in clinical practice include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is elaborated by carcinomas of the colon, pancreas, stomach, and breast, and alpha fetoprotein, which is pro duced by hepatocellular carcinomas, yolk sac remnants in the gonads, and occasionally teratocarcinomas and embry onal cell carcinomas. Unfounately, like PSA, both of these markers can be produced in a variety of nonneoplastic conditions as well. Thus, CEA and alpha fetoprotein assays lack both speci city and sensitivity required for the early detection of cancers. As with PSA screening, they are still paicularly useful in the detection of recurrences after excision. With successful resection of the tumor, these markers disappear from the serum; their reappearance almost always signi es the beginning of the end",

Radiation, cytotoxic anticancer drugs, extremes of temperature, and even hypoxia can damage DNA, either directly or through the production of free radicals. If repair mechanisms cannot cope with the injury, the cell triggers intrinsic mechanisms that induce apoptosis. Anoikis is a form of programmed cell death that occurs in anchorage-dependent cells when they detach from the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Usually, cells stay close to the tissue to which they belong since the communication between proximal cells as well as between cells and ECM provide essential signals for growth or survival. When cells are detached from the ECM, there is a loss of normal cell-matrix interactions, and they may undergo anoikis. However, metastatic tumor cells may escape from anoikis and invade other organs. ( Robbins Basic Pathology, 9 th edition, )",

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have shown that transient hypoxia-ischaemia leads to a biphasic disruption of cerebral energy metabolism. Related to this biphasic energy failure, two waves of cell death seem to follow hypoxic-ischaemic injury in the developing brain. Immediate neuronal death is probably largely due to necrosis, resulting mainly from the accumulation of calcium ions, leading to membrane pump failure. 41 Delayed cell death resulting from hypoxic-ischaemic injury seems to involve different or additional mechanisms and a growing body of data suggests that in the delayed phase of injury cell death occurs by apoptosis. In the developing nervous system apoptosis is observed as early as neural tube formation and persists throughout terminal differentiation of the neural network. apoptosis in neural cells. Neurotrophin withdrawal leads to death by a default mechanism through as yet uncharacterised pathways. Gene mutations, inappropriate production of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, free radical generation, and mitochondrial damage also trigger apoptosis as do engagement of death receptors. In the latter case oligomerisation of Fas/Apo-1 or TNF receptors or the p75 NGF receptor results in the recruitment of death domain proteins, which in turn activate members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases in an organised proteolytic cascade. Bcl-2 family members and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) control the decision to commit cell suicide, depending on whether pro- or anti-apoptotic paners predominate. In the later stages, specific endonucleases cleave DNA as pa of the packaging process. Finally, cells are phagocytosed by healthy neighbours",

        "question": "The inheritance pattern of Familial hypercholesterolemia is",

Autosomal Dominant Inheritance Familial hypercholesterolemia Huntington disease Marfan syndrome Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Hereditary spherocytosis Neurofibromatosis, type 1 Adult polycystic kidney disease Familial Hypercholesterolemia Familial hypercholesterolemia is among the most common mendelian disorders; the frequency of the heterozygous condition is 1 in 500 in the general population. It is caused by a mutation in the LDLR gene that encodes the receptor for low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the form in which 70% of total plasma cholesterol is transpoed. A brief review of the synthesis and transpo of cholesterol follows. Normal Cholesterol Metabolism. Cholesterol may be derived from the diet or from endogenous synthesis. Dietary triglycerides and cholesterol are incorporated into chylomicrons in the intestinal mucosa, which drain by way of the gut lymphatics into the blood. These chylomicrons are hydrolyzed by an endothelial lipoprotein lipase in the capillaries of muscle and fat. The chylomicron remnants, rich in cholesterol, are then delivered to the liver. Some of the cholesterol enters the metabolic pool (to be described), and some is excreted as free cholesterol or bile acids into the biliary tract. The endogenous synthesis of cholesterol and LDL begins in the liver (Fig. 6-2). The first step in the synthesis of LDL is the secretion of triglyceride-rich very- low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) by the liver into the blood. In the capillaries of adipose tissue and muscle, the VLDL paicle undergoes lipolysis and is conveed to intermediate- density lipoprotein (IDL). In comparison with VLDL, the content of triglyceride is reduced and that of cholesteryl esters enriched in intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), but IDL retains on its surface two of the three VLDL- associated apolipoproteins B-100 and E. Fuher metabo- lism of IDL occurs along two pathways: Most of the IDL paicles are directly taken up by the liver through the LDL receptor described later; others are conveed to cholesterol- rich LDL by a fuher loss of triglycerides and apolipopro- tein E. In the liver cells, IDL is recycled to generate VLDL. Two thirds of the resultant LDL paicles are metabo- lized by the LDL receptor pathway, and the rest is metabo- lized by a receptor for oxidized LDL (scavenger receptor), to be described later. The LDL receptor binds to apolipo- proteins B-100 and E and thus is involved in the transpo of both LDL and IDL. Although the LDL receptors are widely distributed, approximately 75% are located on hepatocytes, so the liver plays an extremely impoant role in LDL metabolism. The first step in the receptor-mediated transpo of LDL involves binding to the cell surface receptor, followed by endocy- totic internalization inside so-called \"clathrin-coated pits\" (Fig. 6-3). Within the cell, the endocytic vesicles fuse with the lysosomes, and the LDL molecule is enzymatically degraded, resulting ultimately in the release of free cholesterol into the cytoplasm. The cholesterol not only is used by the cell for membrane synthesis but also takes pa in intracel- lular cholesterol homeostasis by a sophisticated system of feed- back control: * It suppresses cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthetic pathway. * It stimulates the formation of cholesterol esters for storage of excess cholesterol. * It downregulates the synthesis of cell surface LDL recep- tors, thus protecting cells from excessive accumulation of cholesterol. The transpo of LDL by the scavenger receptors, alluded to earlier, seems to take place in cells of the mononuclear- phagocyte system and possibly in other cells as well. Monocytes and macrophages have receptors for chemically modified (e. g., acetylated or oxidized) LDLs. The amount catabolized by this \"scavenger receptor\" pathway is directly related to the plasma cholesterol level. (Robbins Basic Pathology, 9th edition, pg no. 219)",

All stresses and noxious influences exe their effects first at the molecular or biochemical level. Cellular function may be lost long before cell death occurs, and the morphologic changes of cell injury (or death) lag far behind both (Fig. 1-7). For example, myocardial cells become noncontractile after 1 to 2 minutes of isch- emia, although they do not die until 20 to 30 minutes of ischemia have elapsed. These myocytes may not appear dead by electron microscopy for 2 to 3 hours, or by light microscopy for 6 to 12 hours. The cellular derangements of reversible injury can be corrected, and if the injurious stimulus abates, the cell can return to normalcy. Persistent or excessive injury, however, causes cells to pass the nebulous \"point of no return\" into irreversible injury and cell death. The events that determine when reversible injury becomes irreversible and progresses to cell death remain poorly understood. The clinical rele- vance of this question is obvious; if the biochemical and molecular changes that predict cell death can be identified with precision, it may be possible to devise strategies for preventing the transition from reversible to irreversible cell injury. Although there are no definitive morphologic or biochemical correlates of irreversibility, two phenomena con- sistently characterize irreversibility: the inability to correct mito- chondrial dysfunction (lack of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation) even after resolution of the original injury, and profound disturbances in membrane function. As mentioned earlier, injury to lysosomal membranes results in the enzymatic dissolution of the injured cell, which is the culmination of injury progressing to necrosis. As mentioned earlier, different injurious stimuli may induce death by necrosis or apoptosis (Fig. 1-6 and Table Refer robbins 9/e p6",

        "exp": "Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes - abbreted to MELAS - is one of the family of mitochondrial cytopathies, which also include MERRF, and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. It was first characterized under this name in 1984. A feature of these diseases is that they are caused by defects in the mitochondrial genome which is inherited purely from the female parent. However, it is impoant to know that some of the proteins essential to normal mitochondrial function are produced by the nuclear genome, and are subsequently transpoed to the mitochondria for use. As such, mutations in these proteins can result in mitochondrial disorders, but can be inherited from both male and female parent in the typical fashion. The disease can manifest in both sexes. This condition is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance and heteroplasmy. This pattern of inheritance applies to genes contained in mitochondrial DNA. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, only females pass mitochondrial conditions to their children. Mitochondrial disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass mitochondrial traits to their children. In most cases, people with MELAS inherit an altered mitochondrial gene from their mother. Less commonly, the disorder results from a new mutation in a mitochondrial gene and occurs in people with no family history of MELAS.",

These disorders can result in feeding problems, speech problems, hearing problems, and frequent ear infections. Less than half the time the condition is associated with other disorders. Multifacorial inheritance is the type of inheritance followed by traits that are determined by multiple factors both environmental and genetic. Environmental factors interact with many genes to generate a normally distributed susceptibiity. Some diseases for example myocardial infarction, congenital bih defects, cancer, diabetes, mental illnesses and Alzheimer diseases cause along with morbidity, premature moality in two out of three individuals during their lifetime. Many show clustering among families. However their inheritance pattern does not follow that of single gene disorders (Mendelian pattern of inheritance).

First, T cells are activated by foreign antigen to proliferate and differentiate into effector cells only when the antigen is displayed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells in peripheral lymphoid organs. The T cells respond in this manner because the form of antigen they recognize is different from that recognized by B cells. Whereas B cells recognize intact antigen, T cells recognize fragments of protein antigens that have been paly degraded inside the antigen-presenting cell. The peptide fragments are then carried to the surface of the presenting cell on special molecules called MHC proteins, which present the fragments to T cells. T cells don't act as antigen presenting cells.",
