        "exp": "- Given features suggests the diagnosis of leukoplakia. LEUKOPLAKIA: - White patch/ plaque that cannot be scraped off & cannot be characterized clinically or pathologically as any other disease. - Thus, until proven otherwise by histologic evaluation, all leukoplakias must be considered precancerous. - Seen in adults at any age but typically affect individuals b/w 40 - 70 yrs of age with 2: 1 male predominance. OTHER OPTIONS: - Hairy leukoplakia is most commonly seen in immunocompromised pts - Erythroplakia is red, velvety, sometimes eroded lesion that is flat or slightly depressed relative to surrounding mucosa. - Thrush is characterized by superficial, curd like, gray to white inflammatory membrane composed of matted organisms enmeshed in fibrino-suppurative exudate that can be readily scraped off to reveal underlying erythematous base.",

The bone marrow examination revealed 26% blasts frequency exhibiting Auer rods and mature myeloid cells. An occasional neutrophil with pseudo Pelger-Huet anomaly was also detected. Which of the following cytochemical stains is most likely to be positive?",
        "exp": "Patient here gives a sho history (acute onset) of development of pancytopenia (fever; weakness and gum bleeding suggest leucopenia; anemia and thrombocytopenia respectively). The presence of 26% blasts in the bone narrow suggests the development of acute leukemia and the presence of Auer rods means that the diagnosis is most likely AML. Pseudo Pelger Huet cells are neutrophils having greater than 2 nuclear lobes and are usually seen in myelodysplastic syndrome. In 10% patients, MDS can give rise to AML. So, the AML in question may have developed from MDS. The chief cell in AML is myeloblast for which the staining is positive for myeloperoxidase. Note: Acid phosphatase is useful for lymphoblasts which are seen in ALL Other options: Toluidine blue stain mast cells red-purple (metachromatic staining) and the background blue (ohochromatic staining).
