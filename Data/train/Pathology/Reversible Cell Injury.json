        "exp": "The answer is A: Atrophy. Interference with blood supply to tissues is known as ischemia. Total ischemia results in cell death. Paial ischemia occurs after incomplete occlusion of a blood vessel or in areas of inadequate collateral circulation.

For example, it is frequently seen around the inadequately perfused margins of infarcts in the heart, brain, and kidneys. None of the other choices describe decreased organ size and function.",
