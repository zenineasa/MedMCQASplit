Paial ischemia occurs after incomplete occlusion of a blood vessel or in areas of inadequate collateral circulation.

For example, it is frequently seen around the inadequately perfused margins of infarcts in the hea, brain, and kidneys. None of the other choices describe decreased organ size and function.",
