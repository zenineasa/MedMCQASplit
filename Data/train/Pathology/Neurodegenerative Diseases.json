Alzheimer's disease most often presents with subtle onset of memory loss followed by a slowly progressive dementia that has a course of several years. Pathologically, there is diffuse atrophy of the cerebral cortex with secondary enlargement of the ventricular system. Microscopically, there are neuritic plaques containing A amyloid, silver-staining neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in neuronal cytoplasm, and accumulation of A42 amyloid in arterial walls of cerebral blood vessels. NFT also seen in supra nuclear palsy",

As this cavity is usually a extension of the central canal, the Fibres passing from the centre of the spiral cord ie. (Spinothalamic tract) are first to be affected. Spinothalamic tract carries pain & temperature sensation. Therefore these sensation are first to be affected. The tracts which pass from the lateral parts of spinal cord are not affected in the beginning. The sensations carried by these tracts remain intact. So Syringomyelia causes selective loss of pain temperature sensations with sparing of other sensations such as fine touch and proprioception (this is carried by post column which pass in lateral parts of spinal cord) this type of sensory loss is known as dissociative sensory loss. Other important features of Svringomevelia. In Syringomyelia there is involvement of lower cervical & high thoracic region. The classic presentation is a central cord Syndrome with disassociated sensory loss and areflexic weakness in upper limbs.",

In advanced cases, there is severe neuronal loss, reactive gliosis, and sometimes expansion of the vacuolated areas into cystlike spaces (\"status spongiosus\"). o Kuru plaques are extracellular deposits of aggregated abnormal protein; they are Congo red-positive as well as PAS-positive and occur in the cerebellum in cases of Gerstmann-Strdussler-Scheinker syndrome; they are present in abundance in the cerebral cortex in cases of variant CJD. o In all forms of prion disease, immunohistochemical staining demonstrates the presence of proteinase-K-resistant Pr. Psc in tissue. o Fatal familial insomnia does not show spongiform pathology. Instead, the most striking alteration is neuronal loss and reactive gliosis in the anterior ventral and dorsomedial nuclei of the thalamus; neuronal loss is also prominent in the inferior olivary nuclei. Some important questions on Prions diseaseo Disease confined to nervous system. o Caused by infection proteinaceous particles called prions. o Characterized by neurodegeneration and spongiform changes. o Usually have long incubation period. o Disease is usually chronic progressive disease. o The disease is invariably fatal. o The host shows no inflammatory response and no immune res pons.",
