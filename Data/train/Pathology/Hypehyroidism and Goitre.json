She has lost 9 kg (20 lb pounds) over past 6 months, despite increased caloric intake. She frequently finds her heart racing and can feel it pounding in her chest. She also states that she has missed several menstrual periods over past few months. Physical examination reveals warm and moist skin and bulging eyes (exophthalmos). Laboratory studies will likely reveal which of the following endocrine abnormalities in this patient?",

        "question": "A 65-year-old woman with a history of multinodular goiter complains of increasing nervousness, insomnia, and heart palpitations. She has lost 9 kg over the past 6 months. There is no evidence of exophthalmos. Laboratory studies show elevated serum levels of free T3 and T4. Serologic tests for antithyroid antibodies are negative. Which of the following is the likely endocrinopathy in this patient?",
        "exp": "Given clinical features suggests the diagnosis of toxic/hyperfunctional multinodular goiter, resulting in thyrotoxicosis/hypehyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis is a hypermetabolic state caused by elevated circulating levels of free T3 and T4. The most common causes of thyrotoxicosis are associated with hyperfunction of the gland and include the following: Diffuse hyperplasia of the thyroid associated with Graves disease (approximately 85% of cases) Hyperfunctional multinodular goiter Hyperfunctional thyroid adenoma The manifestations in the given patient are due to overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system (nervousness, insomnia, and heart palpitations), increase catabolic metabolism (weight loss). True thyroid ophthalmopathy with proptosis is more common in Graves disease. Some individuals with thyrotoxicosis develop reversible left ventricular dysfunction and \"low-output\" heart failure, called thyrotoxic or hypehyroid cardiomyopathy. Graves disease is the most common cause of endogenous hypehyroidism, associated with diffuse enlargement of thyroid gland and is characterised by production of autoantibodies against different thyroid autoantigens. Thyroid storm refers to the abrupt onset of severe hypehyroidism, occurs most commonly in patients with Graves disease and probably results from an acute elevation in catecholamine levels.",

Most common antibody subtype, known as thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) is observed in approximately 90% of patients with Graves disease resulting in hypehyroidism.

The follicles are lined by tall columnar epithelial cells that are actively resorbing the colloid in the centers of the follicles, resulting in a \"scalloped\" appearance of the colloid. Other antibodies associated are: Antibodies against thyroglobulin and thryoid peroxidase. Thyroid growth-stimulating immunoglobulins - resulting in proliferation of thyroid follicular epithelium.
