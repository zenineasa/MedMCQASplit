It is an insoluble pigment also called 'wear and tear' or 'aging pigment'In tissue sections, it appears as light yellow brown, finely granular, intracytoplasmic often perinuclear pigment. It is seen in cells undergoing slow regressive changes and is particularly prominent in the liver and heart of aging patients or in patients with severe malnutrition and cancer cachexia. Lipochrome is not injurious to the cell, its importance lies in its being the tell-tale sign of free radical injury. It is composed of polymers of lipids and phospholipids Complexed with protein. It is derived through lipid peroxidation of polyunsaturated lipids of subcellular membranes. Hemosiderin: It is a pigment deposited in conditions of excess iron.

        "question": "A lady on long term hemodialysis developed carpel tunnel syndrome. The cause was diagnosed to be amyloidosis by using a biopsy. What is the type of amyloid that is seen?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e. Beta 2 microglobulin Dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) is a disorder caused by tissue deposition of beta2 microglobulin as amyloid fibrils. The clearance of beta2 microglobulin, a component of the major histocompatibility complex that is present on cell surfaces, normally occurs by glomerular filtration with subsequent reabsorption and catabolism in proximal tubules. Clearance therefore declines in patients with reduced kidney function, leading to plasma accumulation and slow tissue deposition. The tissue deposition of amyloid detected histologically occurs much earlier than any clinical or radiographic manifestations of the illness. In contrast to fragments of immunoglobulin light chains in primary amyloidosis and serum amyloid A in secondary amyloidosis, the amyloid protein in DRA is composed primarily of beta2- microglobulin. The amyloid found in the bone cysts and synovial tissue in patients with DRA is similar to other forms of amyloid in its staining properties with Congo red and in exhibiting apple-green birefringence under polarized light. It has been proposed that beta2- microglobulin has a high affinity for collagen, an effect that could explain the predominance of joint and bone disease. Clearance of beta2-microslobulin. Underlying the tissue deposition of beta2-microglobulin among patients with end-stage renal disease is the inability to adequately clear this substance, even with modem high flux hemodialysis and/or convective therapies.
