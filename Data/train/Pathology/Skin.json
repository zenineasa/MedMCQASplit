        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Face o Rodent ulcer is synonymous with basal cel! carcinoma. o 90% of basal cell carcinomas are seen in the face, above a line from the corner of mouth to the lobule of ear. The commonest site is around the inner can thus of the eye (also k/a Tear cancer). o This is a typical appearance of nodular variety of Basal cell Ca. o Basal cell Ca is a locally invasive carcinoma of the basal layer of epidermis. o Its of the following 4 types: Nodular variety (most common type) - is characterized by a small slow growing pearly nodule, often with small telengiectatic vessels on its surface. Central depression with umblication is classic sign. Pigmented BCC - This is pigmented variant of nodular variety and thus mimick malignant malanoma. Cystic BCCs - are more macular than other varieties andmay extend over the surface of the skin in a multicentric pattern. The centre can ulcerate. These lesions may appear similar to psoriasis, tenia or eczema. Other points about Basal cell carcinoma. It is the most common type of skin cancer. ( Ref: Schwartz 9th/e p. 406). Low grade malignancy. More common in fair and dry skinned people. Exposure to sunlight is an important etiological factor. Has been seen following prolonged administration of Arsenic. Spread: Basal cell ca usually spreads by local Invasion. In gradually destroys the tissues it comes in contact with, that's why it is called 'rodent ulcer', Lymphatic spread is not seen. Blood spread is also extremely rare.",

        "question": "A 74-year-old woman has noted increasing size and number of darker brown patches on the dorsum of each hand for the past 15 years. They do not change with sun exposure, are nonpruritic, and non-tender. On examination, these 0. 5- to 1-cm lightly pigmented lesions are flat. Which of the following is the most likely microscopic finding in these lesions?",
        "exp": "Unlike a freckle that darkens upon light exposure, lentigo (pleural: lentigenes) does not. There is a focal increase in melanocytes of the basal layer, along with thinning of epidermis and elongation of rete ridges. Lentigines can occur at any age; those in older persons may be termed senile lentigines or age spots. A nevus typically forms a nodule and likely appears much earlier in life. Loss of melanin is termed vitiligo and is a separate process from melanocyte hyperplasia. A collection of mast cells can produce urticaria pigmentosa, which often has a light brown appearance, but pruritus is common. Some superficial fungal infections (black piedra) may be pigmented, but they typically do not persist for years.",
