This cluster includes ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and enteropathic arthritis (as in this case). A common feature is a very strong association with the HLA-B27 genotype. Despite some similarities with rheumatoid arthritis, these patients invariably have a negative test result for rheumatoid factor. Urethritis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis can trigger reactive arthritis, another form of seronegative spondyloarthropathy. Such infection precedes the onset of arthritis, however. There is no relationship between infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, and reactive arthritis in individuals testing positive for HLA-B27.

Robbin, Pathology, 6th ed., 1244)EWING'S SARCOMA# Ewing's sarcoma constitutes -10-15% of all bone sarcomas# Is common in adolescence (peak incidence in the second decade of life).# It typically involves the diaphyseal region of long bones, Also has an affinity for flat bones.# X-ray: characteristic 6ionion peel\" periosteal reaction with a soft tissue mass (better seen by MRI).# The soft mass is composed of sheets of monotonous, small, round, blue cells and can be confused with lymphoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, and small-cell carcinoma.# It is composed of sheets of uniform small, round cells that are larger than lymphocytes, rich in glycogen with Homer- Wright rosettes (tumor cells with PAS positive Glycogen-filled cytoplasm characteristic).# The presence of p30/32, the product of the mic-2 gene (which maps to the pseudoautosomal region of the X and Y chromosomes) is a cell-surface marker for Ewing's sarcoma (and other members of PNETs).# In approximately 85% of patients t (11; 22) (q24; ql2) translocation is seen.# It is Undifferentiated--high grade tumor (Ewing's is always classed G4).# It is very aggressive, and it is therefore considered a systemic disease.# Common sites of metastases are lung, bones, and bone marrow.# Ewing's sarcoma can be curable, even in the presence of metastatic disease, especially in children <11 years.# Systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of therapy, often being used before surgery.# Local treatment for this tumor includes surgical resection, usually with limb salvage or radiation therapy.# More PNETs are known to arise in soft tissues; which include -- Peripheral neuroepithelioma, - Askin's tumor (chest wall), and- Esthesioneuroblastoma.
