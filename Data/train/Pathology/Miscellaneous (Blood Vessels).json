        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Tay-Sach's disease Ion channels provide pores for the passive diffusion of ions across biological membranes. They are often highly selective for a particular ionic species, leading to a classification into sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), chloride (Cl)and unspecific cation channels. Ion channels serve many functions apart from electrical signal transduction: chem ical signalling (Ca2+as a second messenger), transepithelial transport, regulation of cytoplasmic or vesicular ion concentration and pH, and regulation of cell volume. Therefore, ion channel dysfunction can cause diseases in many tissues. The list of human diseases known to be associated with defects in ion channels has grown considerably during the past years.

The normal body is located in the dermis throughout the body, but is more concentrated in the digits. They are believed to function in thermal regulation. o The most common site of glomus tumors is subungual and 75% of the lesions occur in the hand, o The lesions present most frequently during the fourth and fifth decade of life although they can be found in any age and at any site. o The subungual tumors affect women three times more commonly than men. o The lesions are usually solitay but mulifocal tumors are also seen, o Clinically, glomus tumors are characterized by a triad of -Sensitivity to cold, Localized tenderness and, Severe intermittent pain. o Grossly, the tumors are usually less than one cm, in size and appear as small red-blue nodules. The lesion appears as a localized dark red or blue lesion beneath the finger nail, but the subnugual lesions can be difficult to detect on clinical examination. o Two usuful tests for diagnosis glomus tumors, particularly solitary painful glomus tumors (especially those under a nail) are the following. Disappearance of pain after application of a tourniquet proximallv on the arm. Eliciting pain by applying pressure to a precise area with the tip of a pencil. o Treatment of glomus tumors consists of surgical excision.",
