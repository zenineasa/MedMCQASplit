DNA damage is sensed by complexes containing kinases of the ATM/ATR family; these kinases phosphorylate p53, liberating it from inhibitors such as MDM2. Active p53 then upregulates the expression of proteins such as the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21, thereby causing cell-cycle arrest at the G1-S checkpoint. This pause allows cells to repair DNA damage. If DNA damage cannot be repaired, p53 induces additional events that lead to cellular senescence or apoptosis.",
