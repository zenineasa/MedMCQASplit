        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., Resolution o In the usual course of pneumonia, final stage is resolution,o However, in some neglected cases following complications may develop -i) Abscess formation iv) Pleural effusion, pleuritisii) Empyema v) Becteremic dissemination - Brain abscess, endocarditis, meningitis,iii) Organization supurrative arthritis.Pathological changes of bacterial pneumoniaA.Lobar pneumoniao Large confluent area of the lung or entire lobes are consolidated,o The lower lobes are affected most commonly.o There are four stages of the inflammatory response (Laennec's stages) -1. Stage of congestion (initial phase)o The affected lobe is enlarged, heavy, dark red and congested,o Cut surface exudes blood-stained frothy fluid,o There is dilatation and congestion of alveolar capillaries,o There are few neutrophils and numerous bacteria in the alveolar fluid.2. Stage of red hepatization (early consolidation)o The term hepatization refers to liver-like consistency of the affected lobe on cut section,o The affected lobe is red and firm.o The edema fluid of preceding stage is replaced by strands of fibrin,o There is marked cellular exudate of neutrophils with extravasation of red cells.3. Stage of gray hepatization (late consolidation)o The affected lobe is grayish brown, firm and dry.o The fibrin strand are dense and more numerous.o There is progressive disintigration of red cells and neutrophils,o The macrophages begin to appear in the exudate,o The organisms are less numerous and appear as degenerated forms.4. Resolutiono The previously solid and fibrinous constituent is liquefied by enzymatic action.o Granular and fragmented strands of fibrin in the alveolar spaces are seen due to progressive enzymatic digestion.o There is progressive removal of fluid content as well as cellular exudate from the air spaces, resulting in restoration of normal lung parenchyma with areation.B.Bronchopneumoniao Patchy areas of red or grey consolidation, more often multilobar and frequently bilateral and basal (lower zones) because of tendency of secretions to gravitate into lower lobes,o There is suppurative exudate, consisting chiefly neutrophils, filling bronchi, bronchioles and adjacent alveolar spaces.o Alveolar septa thicken due to congested capillaries and leucocytic infiltration.",

        "question": "The commonest cause of lung abscess-",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' aspirated oropharyngeal secretion Harrison writes - 'Risk factors for lung abscess include conditions associated with impaired cough reflex and/or aspiration, such as alcoholism, anaesthesia, drug abuse, epilepsy, and stroke. Dental caries, bronchiectasis, *bronchial carcinoma and pulmonary infarction are also risk factors.Most aspiration - associated lung abscesses are due to a combination of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, with an average of six or seven bacterial species identified in an individual case.The implicated anaerobic bacteria include the Bacteroides fragilis group. Bacteroides gracilis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenicus, Prevotella oralis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Peptostreptococcus magnus.Streptococcus milleri is one of the principal aerobic pathogens; S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae are also isolated frequently. Rarely S. pneumoniae alone (usually capsular type 111) can cause lung abscess.In HIV-infected patients, lung abscess can be due to Pneumocystis, Rhodococcus equi. and cryptococcus neoformans as well as the bacteria noted above. \"",
