Reed-Sternberg cells are CD30 and. CD15 positive, usually negative for CD20 and CD45. The presence of these cells is necessary in the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma - the absence of Reed-Sternberg cells has very high negative predictive value. They can also be found in reactive lymphadenopathy (such as infectious mononucleosis, carbamazepine associated lymphadenopathy) and very often in other types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. A special type of Reed-Sternberg cells is the lacunar histiocyte, whose cytoplasm retracts when fixed in formalin, so the nuclei give the appearance of cells that lie with empty spaces (called lacunae) between them.

This involve a series of steps - \u200bDetachment of tumor cells Detachment of tumor cells is the first step in metastasis. Normally cells are glued to each other by adhesion molecules E-cadherin. Normal function of E-cadherin is dependent on catenins that helps in linkage of cytoskeleton to E-cadherin. Down regulation of expression of either E-cadherins or catenins results loosening of cells that helps in metastasis. Attachment to ECM (including basement membrane) Tumor cells express integrins that helps in the attachement of cells to many components of ECM like fibronectin, laminin, vitronectin, and collegen. Degradation of ECM After attachement to ECM components, tumor cells must create passageways for migration. This require enzymatic degradation of ECM. Tumor cells secrete proteolytic enzymes themselves or stimulate macrophages and fibroblasts to secrete these enzymes. The most important proteases are metalloproteinases (MMPs) including collagenase IV. Vascular dissemination and homing of tumor cells After travelling through ECM, tumor cells enter into the vessels. In the vessels, tumor cells tend to aggregate in clumps. This is due to adhesion between tumor cells and blood cells, particularly platelets. This clump is carried away at distant site where it adhere to endothelium, followed by extravasation from the vessels. Adhesion to endothelium and further travelling through ECM require same mechanism, as was required initially for attachement and degradation of ECM. At new site, tumor cells proliferate and develops new blood supply -> metastatic secondary tumor mass. Note -> Among adhesion molecule CD44 is of particular interest, which is expressed on normal T-cells and is used by these cells to migrate to selective sites in lymphoid tissue. Also know Ezrin is the only metastatis gene, that has been identified till now. It is necessary for metastasis of rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma. In contrast, several antimetastasis gene have been recognized. The important ones are -> NM 23, KAI - 1, Kiss gene.",

Laryngeal spasms may lead to asphyxia. The involvement of various muscles produces rigid abdomen and stiff proximal limb muscles. Hands and feet are relatively spared and sustained contraction of facial muscles results in a grimace or sneer called risus sardonicus. The contraction of muscles of the back produces an arched back called opisthotonus. The spasms occur repetitively or spontaneously or provoked by slight stimulation. Treatment Antitoxin is injected to neutralize circulating toxin and unbound toxin. Human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) 3000-6000 units IM individual doses. Though the optimum dose is not known, a 500 unit dose is as effective as higher doses. Prophylaxis - Wound debridement and booster doses of TT.

The term delayed is used to differentiate it from a secondary' cellular response, which appears at 48-72 hours after antigen exposure and from an immediate hypersensitivity response, which generally appears within minutes, Delayed hypersensitivity is a major mechanism of defence against various intracellular pathogens, including mycobacteria, fungi and certain parasites. Pathophysiology Delayed hypersensitivity is characterized by the formation of granuloma - a localized mass that contains activated macrophages (epithelioid) cells surrounded by colour of lymphocytes and giant cells. It is also called granulomatous Inflammation. The cellular events start when an antigen (eg tuberculin antigen) on antigen presenting cell comes in contact with naive CD-4 T cells -> naive CD-4 T cells recognize this peptide antigen in association with MHC - II and differentiate into T4-l cells. Induction of T4-l cells is of central importance because the expression of delayed hypersensitivity largely depends on the cytokines secreted by T4-l cells. 2.

        "exp": "Ans. D: Should be managed by surgical resection of the involved segment On gross pathologic examination, intestinal TB can be classified into 3 categories: The ulcerative form of TB is seen in approximately 60% of patients. Multiple superficial ulcers are largely confined to the epithelial surface. This is considered a highly active form of the disease, with the long axis of the ulcers perpendicular to the long axis of the bowel. The hyperophic form is seen in approximately 10% of patients and consists of thickening of the bowel wall with scarring; fibrosis; and a rigid, mass like appearance that mimics that of a carcinoma. The ulcero-hyperophic form is a subtype seen in 30% of patients. These patients have a combination of features of the ulcerative and hyperophic forms. The ileum is more commonly involved than the jejunum. Ileocecal involvement is seen in 80-90% of patients with GI TB. This feature is attributed to the abundance of lymphoid tissue (Peyer patches) in the distal and terminal ileum. Clinical features of intestinal TB include abdominal pain, weight loss, anemia, and fever with night sweats. Patients may present with symptoms of obstruction, right iliac fossa pain, or a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa. Hemorrhage and perforation are recognized complications of intestinal TB, although free perforation is less frequent than in Crohn disease. Early changes on barium examinations reveal nodular thickening of mucosal folds, with loss of symmetry in the fold pattern. As with Crohn disease, deep fissures, sinus tracts, enterocutaneous fistulae, and perforation can occur, although less commonly. A cobblestone appearance of the mucosa is a feature seen in Crohn disease that is not seen in TB. Ulceration may be demonstrated on double-contrast examinations, typically perpendicular to the long axis of the bowel; these heal with the formation of sho annular strictures. Because of persistent irritability from inflammation in the terminal ileum, rapid emptying of that segment may occur (Stierlin sign). The ileocecal angle is obliterated with a widely patent ileocecal valve The most common site of GI TB is the ileocecal region, if the area can be reached with a flexible endoscope. A rapid diagnosis can be achieved if smear or culture results are positive or if caseating granulomas are seen in biopsy samples. In countries where GI TB is endemic, a therapeutic trial of antituberculosis treatment may be justified if the clinical picture is compatible with TB.",

Total CK: The values begin to rise within four to six hours and peak at 24 hours. Values return to normal within three to four days. CK-MB: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 24 hours. Values return to normal within 72 hours.

It is a proliferation of small ducts and myoepithelial cells near the terminal duct lobular unit. It also is characterized by fibrosis that distos the glands and lobules into a whorled pattern. The demonstration of this on biopsy, as with other proliferative fibrocystic changes, implies an increased risk for subsequent invasive breast cancer. Apocrine metaplasia is the term used to describe a transformation of ductal epithelial cells to eosinophilic cells resembling apocrine sweat gland epithelium. This is a benign, common, non-proliferative change that is not associated with increased cancer risk. A blue-domed cyst of Bloodgood is a fluid-filled cyst, sometimes up to 5 cm in size, that appears blue grossly before it is incised. When incised, the fluid is serous and dark- colored. These cysts are pa of benign non-proliferative fibrocystic disease and do not carry increased cancer risk. Duct ectasia is characterized by a large dilated duct with inspissated material. it is associated with periductal inflammation and fibrosis of the large collecting ducts under the areola.

        "exp": "Germ line mosaicism In some autosomal dominant disorders examplifled by osteogenesis imperfecta, phenotypically normal parents have more than one affected child. - This clearly violates the law of inheritance. Studies indicate that gonadal mosaicism may be responsible for such unusual inheritance. Mosaicism It means than an individual has 2 or more different cell lines derived from a single Zygote. - The persons body' is made up of a combination of cells with and without mutation for a paicular disease. - Because the mutation remains limited to a small poion of all of the body's cells, these individuals show no sign of the disease. Germline mosaicism Germline mosacism results from a mutation that occurs postzygotically during early embryonic development. In these a poion of the egg or sperm cells of a parent carries the mutation. - Because the mutation affects only cells destined to form the gonads the gametes carry the mutation but somatic cells of the individual are completely normal. - A phenotypically normal parent who has germ line mosaicism can transmit the disease causing mutation to the offspring through the mutant gamete. - Because the progenitor cells of the gamete carry the mutation there is a definite possibility that more than one child of such a parent would be affected. - Obviously, the likelihood of such an occurrence depends on the propoion of germ cells carrying the mutation. Anticipation The signs and symptoms of some genetic conditions tend to become severe and appear at an earlier age as the disorder is passed from one generation to the next. - This phenomenon is called anticipation. Anticipation is most often seen with ceain genetic disorders of the nervous system such as Huntington's disease, Fragile x-syndrome and myotonic dystrophy. Anticipation typically occurs with disorders that are caused by an unusual type of mutation called a \"trinucleotide repeat expansion\". - A trinucleotide repeat is a sequence of three DNA building blocks (nucleotide) that is repeated a number of times in a row. - DNA segments with an abnormal number of these repeats are unstable and prone to errors during cell division. - The number of repeats can change as the gene is passed. from parent to child. - If the number of repeats increases it is known as trinucleotide repeat expansion. - In some cases the trinucleotide repeat may expand until the gene stops functioning normally,. - This expansion causes the feature of some disorders to become severe with each successive generation. Genomic imprinting People inherit two copies of their genes - one from their. father and one from their mother. Usually both copies of each gene are active or \"turned on\" in cells. But with genomic imprinting however, only one of the two copies is normally turned on. Which copy is active depends upon the parent of origin. Some genes are normally active only when they are inherited. from a person's. father, others are active only when inherited from a person's mother. These genes are called \"imprinted genes\" because the gene was epigenetically silenced or marked in either the egg or sperm. Silencing or imprinting usually happens through the addition of methyl groups during egg or sperm formation. An individual normally has one active copy of an imprinting gene. Improper imprinting can result in individual having two active copies or two inactive copies. - This can lead to severe developmental anomalies, cancer and other problems e. g., - Prader willi - Angelman syndrome - They are both linked to same imprinting region of chromosomes 15.",

It is more commonly classified by location into panacinary and centroacinary (or panacinar and centriacinar, or centrilobular and panlobular. Panacinar (or panlobular) emphysema:- The entire respiratory acinus, from respiratory bronchiole to alveoli, is expanded.- Occurs more commonly in the lower lobes, especially basal segments, and anterior margins of the lungs. Centriacinar (or centrilobular) emphysema:- The respiratory bronchiole (proximal and central pa of the acinus) is expanded.- The distal acinus or alveoli are unchanged.- Occurs more commonly in the upper lobes. Other types include distal acinar and irregular. A special type is congenital lobar emphysema (CLE). The majority of all emphysema cases are caused by smoking tobacco. Severe cases of A1. AD may also develop cirrhosis of the liver, where the accumulated A1. AT leads to a fibrotic reaction. Patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (A1. AD) are more likely to suffer from emphysema. A1. AT inhibits inflammatory enzymes (such as elastase) from destroying the alveolar tissue. Most A1. AD patients do not develop clinically significant emphysema, but smoking and severely decreased A1. AT levels (10-15%) can cause emphysema at a young age. The type of emphysema caused by A1. AD is known as panacinar emphysema (involving the entire acinus) as opposed to centrilobular emphysema, which is caused by smoking. Panacinar emphysema typically affects the lower lungs, while centrilobular emphysema affects the upper lungs. A1. AD causes about 2% of all emphysema. Smokers with A1. AD are at the greatest risk for emphysema. Mild emphysema can often develop into a severe case over a sho period of time (1-2 weeks).",

Hydrogen peroxide (H202) The noxious effect of free radicals on various cellular material is being utilized by neutrophils to kill bacterias or other microorganisms. Once the neutrophils phagocytize the bacterias there is rapid respiratory burst in the neutrophils which leads to increased oxygen consumption, glycogenolysis and increased glucose oxidation. These reactions lead to rapid burst of superoxide (and other. free radical) production as a by product of the oxidation. This rapid burst in oxidative respiration is made possible by the rapid activation of an enzyme complex, NADPH oxidase, which oxidizes NADPH and in the process reduces oxygen to superoxide anion (024 NADPH oxidase is an enzyme complex that consists of at least seven proteins. The enzyme consists of two complex? a) Membrane complex b) Cytosolic complex In resting neutrophils various components of this enzyme complex is located in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. When the neutrophils are activated the enzyme complex shifts to the phagosomal membrane. The H202generated by the NADPH oxidase system is generally not able to efficiently kill microbes by itself However, azurophilic granules of neutrophils release the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) which in presence of halides such as Cl- conves 11202 to HOCL.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Panacinar-emphysema Emphysema Emphysema is a condition of the lung characterized by abnormal permanant enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by destruction of their walls and without obvious fibrosis. \"Destruction of walls\" is necessory to define emphysema. Enlargement of airspaces without destruction of their walls is termed overinflation, for example, the distention of airspaces that occurs in the remaining lung after unilateral pneumonectomy. Types of emphysema Emphysema is classified according to its anatomic distribution within the lobule. There are four major types of emphysema? 1. Centriacinar (centrilobular) emphysema Centriacinar emphysema is the most common type of emphysema seen clinically. It is chracterized by involvement of respiratory bronchioles, i. e. central (proximal) pa of the acinus. So, both emphysematous and normal airspaces exist within the same acinus and lobule. The lesions are more common and more severe in the upper lobe, paicularly in the apical segments. This is the type of emphysema that occurs predominantly in heavy smokers and usually coexists with chronic bronchitis. 2. Panacinar (Panlobular) emphysema The acini are uniformly enlarged from the level of the respiratory bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli. This type of emphysema tends to occur more commonly in the lower zones and in the anterior margins of the lung, and it is usually most severe at the base. This type of emphysema is associated with al-antitrypsin deficiency. 3. Distal acinar (Paraseptal) emphysema This type of emphysema involves distal pa of the acinus, while proximal pa is normal. It is localized adjacent to the pleura, along perilobular septa. The involvement is seen adjacent to areas of fibrosis, scarring, or atelectasis and is usually more severe in the upper half of lungs. This type of emphysema is a common cause of spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults. 4. Irregular emphysema (Para-cicatricial emphysema) The acinus is involved irregularly and is almost invariably associated with scarring. It is the most common type of emphysema histologically. Most common type of emphysema is irregular emphysema, but it is not clinically significant as most patients are asymptomatic and it is only an autopsy finding. Most common type of emphysema seen clinically is centracinar emphysema.",

Histamine's effect on small vessels results in efflux of plasma protein and fluid into the extracellular spaces and an increase lymph flow, causing edema. The gaps between endothelial cells also may permit passage of circulating cells recruited to tissues during the mast cell response. In the epidermis, it causes itch; in the dermis, it evokes pain, sometimes accompanied by itching. Also know: Triple Response of Lewis: If histamine is injected intradermally, it elicits a characteristic phenomenon known as the triple response. This consists of: A localized red spot within a few seconds and reaches a maximum in 1 minute. A brighter red flush, or \"flare, \" extending around 1 cm developing more slowly. A wheal that is discernible in 1-2 minutes. The initial red spot results from the direct vasodilating effect of histamine (H1 receptor-mediated NO production). The flare is due to histamine-induced stimulation of axon reflexes that cause vasodilation indirectly. The wheal reflects histamine's capacity to increase capillary permeability (edema formation).

According to its original description, TTP was defined as the pentad of fever, thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, transient neurological deficits, and renal failure. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/TTP/Moschcowitz syndrome. It is a rare disorder cauing extensive microscopic thromboses to form in small blood vessels throughout the body (thrombotic microangiopathy). Most cases of TTP arise from inhibition of the enzyme ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease responsible for cleaving large multimers of von Willebrand factor (v. WF) into smaller units. A rarer form of TTP, called Upshaw-Schulman syndrome, is genetically inherited as a dysfunction of ADAMTS13. If large v. WF multimers persist there is tendency for increased coagulation. Red blood cells passing the microscopic clots are subjected to shear stress which damages their membranes, leading to intravascular hemolysis and schistocyte formation. Reduced blood flow due to thrombosis and cellular injury results in end organ damage. Current therapy is based on suppo and plasmapheresis to reduce circulating antibodies against ADAMTS13 and replenish blood levels of the enzyme. Classically, the following five features (\"pentad\") are indicative of TTP:- Neurologic symptoms (fluctuating), such as hallucinations, bizarre behavior, altered mental status, stroke or headaches- Kidney failure- Fever- Thrombocytopenia, leading to bruising or purpura- Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (anemia, jaundice and a blood film featuring evidence of mechanical fragmentation of red blood cells)",

TnT) and cardiac specific Troponin I (c.

        "exp": "Fibrinoid necrosis is a type of connective tissue necrosis seen paicularly in autoimmune diseases (eg, rheumatic fever, polyaeritis nodosa, and systemic lupus erythematosus). Collagen and smooth muscle in the media of blood vessels are especially involved. Fibrinoid necrosis of aerioles also occurs in accelerated (malignant) hypertension. Fibrinoid necrosis is characterized by loss of normal structure and replacement by a homogeneous, bright pink-staining necrotic material that resembles fibrin microscopically. Areas of fibrinoid necrosis contain various amounts of immunoglobulins and complement, albumin, breakdown products of collagen, and fibrin. Also Know: Fat Necrosis: Fat necrosis most characteristically occurs in acute pancreatitis when pancreatic enzymes are liberated from the ducts into surrounding tissue. Pancreatic lipase acts on the triglycerides in fat cells, breaking these down into glycerol and fatty acids, which complex with plasma calcium ions to form calcium soaps. Liquefactive Necrosis: Liquefaction of necrotic cells results when lysosomal enzymes released by the necrotic cells cause rapid liquefaction. Lysis of a cell as a result of the action of its own enzymes is autolysis. Liquefactive necrosis is typically seen in the brain following ischemia. Coagulative Necrosis: In this type of necrosis, the necrotic cell retains its cellular outline, often for several days. The cell, devoid of its nucleus, appears as a mass of coagulated, pink-staining, homogeneous cytoplasm. Coagulative necrosis typically occurs in solid organs, such as the kidney, hea (myocardium), and adrenal gland, usually as a result of deficient blood supply and anoxia. It is also seen with other types of injury, eg, coagulative necrosis of liver cells due to viruses or toxic chemicals, and coagulative necrosis of skin in burns. Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C. R.

The autopsy revealed splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and glomerulopathy. The spleen, liver, and kidneys showed a similar waxy texture. Which of the following mechanisms explains these clinical and pathologic findings?",
        "exp": "Chronic inflammatory conditions, such as collagen vascular diseases, rheumatoid ahritis, and bronchiectasis, may lead in time to accumulation of a specific form of amyloid, known as AA (amyloid-associated protein). Systemic amyloidosis affects many organs, especially the hea, kidneys, spleen, GI tract, liver, and tongue. The ventricular walls become thickened and inelastic, and the resulting pathophysiologic picture is that of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Congestive heart failure ensues because of decreased ventricular compliance and secondary reduced stroke volume. Note how the ventricular lumen are narrowed and the walls are extremely thickened. A waxy texture is highly suggestive of amyloid deposition, which can be confirmed histologically by using Congo red staining. Note: Atherosclerosis of coronary aeries may give three different types of clinical manifestations: arrhythmias (with sudden death), angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction. Loss of myocardial tissue due to ischemic necrosis may lead to congestive heart failure. The hea will show evidence of old infarcts in the form of scars, and the ventricular cavities will become dilated. Coxsackievirus myocarditis is the most common etiologic form of viral myocarditis, which may resolve without clinical consequences or lead to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Mutations of myosin chain genes are the most common causes of hyperophic cardiomyopathy. This manifests with thickening of the interventricular septum (so-called asymmetric cardiac hyperophy), with resultant impediment to both systolic outflow and diastolic filling. Here, the ventricular walls are uniformly thickened, and the remaining postmoem findings (liver, kidney, and spleen changes) cannot be explained based on a diagnosis of hyperophic cardiomyopathy.

You may choose your answer. Gangrenous necrosis o Gangrenous necrosis is of two types:? Dry gangrene Wet gangrene Dry gangrene It is a clinically distinct variant of coagulative necrosis. It occurs most commonly in the soft tissue of lower limbs (Leg, foot, toes) as a result of ischemia due to aerial occlusion, that leads to coagulative necrosis. Then, why is it called gangrenous necrosis not coagulative necrosis? Lets see. Since the extent of vascular occlusion is frequently global in the lower limbs, which impedes or prevents the migration of leukocytes in to the area of coagulative necrosis, it is called gangrenous necrosis because the dead tissue is not digested and removed but remains mummified. Wet gangrene o When overlying skin of dry gangrenous tissue is devitalized, bacterial infection is superimposed and the coagulative necrosis is modified by liquifactive necrosis. So, o Dry gangrene --> Variant of Coagulative necrosis. Wet gangrene --> Liquifactive necrosis is superimposed on coagulative necrosis.",

Substances that diminish the absorption of ferrous and ferric iron are phytates, oxalates, phosphates, carbonates, and tannates. Ascorbic acid increases the absorption of ferric and ferrous iron. Hemorrhage - Bleeding for any reason produces iron depletion. If sufficient blood loss occurs chronically, iron deficiency anemia ensues. Malabsorption of iron - Prolonged achlorhydria may produce iron deficiency because acidic conditions are required to release ferric iron from food. - Extensive surgical removal of the proximal small bowel or chronic diseases, such as untreated sprue or celiac syndrome, can diminish iron absorption.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Valvular endocardium. Carcinoid Heart disease. Carcinoid heart disease is the cardiac manifestation of the systemic syndrome caused by carcinoid tumors. It generally involves the endocardium and valve of the right side of hea. Cardiovascular lesions consist of firm plaque like endocardial fibrous thickenings on the inside surfaces of the cardiac chambers and the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Occasionally they involve the major blood vessels of the right side, the inferior vena cava and the pulmonary aery. These plaque like thickenings are composed predominantly of smooth muscle cells and sparase collagen fibres embedded in an acid mucopolysaccharide-rich matrix materials. Elastic fibers are not present in the plaque. The most common cardiac manifestation is tricuspid regurgitation. Stenosis of right sided valve may also develop. Why does right sided hea involvement more common? Carcinoid tumors produce a variety of bioactive products that produce these (above described) heart lesions. Among these, serotonin is most impoant. Serotonin is inactivated during its passage through lung. As you all know, left side of hea recieve blood from pulmonary circulation, left sided hear lesions are uncommon (Because serotonin has already been metabolized in lung). Similarly, gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors do not induce carcinoid heart disease (neither right nor left) as bioactive mediators released into the poal circulation are metabolized in the liver. Therefore carcinoid heart disease is produced by tumors that have extensive hepatic metastasis (liver releases the mediators directly into IVC) or carcinoid tumors of organs that are outside poal circulation (e. g., ovary).",

        "exp": "Increased free radical injury The cells of lower organism i. e. bacterial cells are immoal at least in principle. If a bacterial cell is placed in. ourable condition it will grow and divide indefinitely. What about cells of higher organisms like birds or mammals?? - Until mid twentieth century it was thougth that cells from higher species were also immoal i. e., capable to grow indefinitely under proper conditions. Hayflick theory of aeging suggests that human cells is limited in the number of times it can divide. -Hayflick theorized that human cells ability to divide is approximately 50 times, after which, they simply stop dividing. - It was believed that the hayflick limit is a genetic program that prevents cell division after a ceain no. of cell cycles. Why would our cells need to have such program?? - The current view is that a built in limit on the number of possible cell divisions reduce the risk of uncontrolled growth resulting in cancer. Indeed, studies indicate that in cancer cells this genetic clock is broken allowing them to grow indefinitely. Could it be that ageing is the result of cells inability to divide once they have reached the Hayflick limit??. - There is no straight answer to that at present. It appears that in some tissues such as the skin and the lining of blood vessels the hayflick limit may be an impoant pa of the aeging process. - On the other hand, cells in the brain, retina, nerves and muscles normally do not divide and never even approach the Hayflick limit. Molecular mechanism responsible for Hayflick limit (Telomerase theorey of Aging) In the cells of higher organisms chromosomes are capped with special DNA structures called Telomers. The main role of Telomers is to protect the ends of chromosomes from degradation. - During cell division the chromosomes are duplicated through the process of DNA replication. - However due to the nature of this process, the very ends of Telomers cannot be copied. - Imagine a road machine that moves along the road and makes a new layer of asphalt behind it. The machines design is such that it can move only when it is on the road. When it has reached the end of the road there is an new layer of asphalt over the entire road except for the spot under the machine. To be able to cover the remaining spot, the machine must move past it but it cannot because it is already at the end of the road. - Similar scenario occurs during the replication of chromosome. - Thus the very end of the each telomere never gets copied. - Which leads to progressive shoening of Telomers after each cell division. It appears that after its Telomers have shoened beyond a ceain point the cell loses the ability to divide (This does not occurs in bacteria because their chromosomes are circular and do not have telomers) Free radicals theory of ageing It is now widely believed that degeneration occurs primarily in response to oxidative stress. During oxidative stress, a highly reactive oxygen molecules (ROS) are released. These molecules characteristically have unpaired electron in their outer orbit. - Small quantities of ROS are formed spontaneously under normal conditions, as the byproduct, of redox processes such as oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria and y3 oxidation of fatty acids. - However, generation of free radicals is significantly enhanced in condition of oxidative stress, irradiation, chemical exposure. Free radicals are extremely reactive speciese since by reacting with other molecules they try to stabilize their configuration and obtain the lacking electrons. - The inacromolecules that are extremely susceptible to ROS mediated damage are nucleic acids, phospholipids and proteins. - Oxidation of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA may result in mutation and aberrant protein synthesis. - Oxidative damage to cell membrane phospholipids may impair transmembrctne transpo mechanisms and signal transduction. Under normal conditions, ultrastructural alterations caused by ROS are recognized and eliminated by cellular repair mechanisms:- - It is however, impoant to emphasize that the cumulative damage exeed by ROS with time, exceeds repairing potential of the cellular machinery which ultimately leads to decline in physiological capacity of the whole organism. Molecular evidence of increased oxidative stress is -> \"accumulation of lipofuscin\". Under normal conditions a network of cellular defence system including \"catalase\", \"peroxidase, \"superoxide dismutase\" effectively scavenges small amounts of ROS generated. - However, the capacity of antioxidant system is limited and the rate at which antitoxidant agent are resynthesized declines with age. Cross linkage theory of Aging An impoant theory implicated in age related cell degeneration is accumulation of advanced glycosylation end (AGE) products. - Advanced glycosylation end products are. formed by non enzymatic reaction between sugar and protein. - It has been demonstrated that physiological control of blood glucose becomes less tight with age which leads to impaired glucose tolerance and prolonged periods of elevated glucose that our AGE formation. Generation of AGE induces pathology a number of mechanisms. - Glycosylation of several proteins have been documented such as hemoglobin, fibrinogen lipoprotein ferritin. Of paicular impoance is glycosylation of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen. - Cross linking of collagen type I molecule in large vessels decrease their elasticity which may predispose these vessels to shear stress and endothelial injury. Proteins cross linked are resistant to proteolvtic digeston. \"Thus crosslinking decreases protein removal while enhancing deposition\". Consequences of AGE induced abnormalities includes. - Narrowing of blood vessels. - Capturing of other plasma proteins such as LDL - Thickening of basement membrane - Decreased elasticity of blood vessels, skins, ligament... In addition AGE bind to specific receptors on immune cells which trigger the release of inflammatory mediators and generation of ROS which fuher increase AGE induced damage. Membrane theory of aeging As the body grow older the cell membrane becomes less lipid. This impedes its efficiency to conduct normal function and in paicular there is a toxic accumulation. - This cellular toxin is referred to as \"lipofuscin\" and as we grow older, lipofuscin deposits become more evident in the brain, hea and lungs and also in the skin. Somatic mutation theory of aging Somatic mutations tend to accumulate steadily during life and somatic cells become increasingly susceptible to the cumulative effect of DNA damage which leads to aging. Accumulation of senescent cells Renewing tissues become dysfunctional through loss of ability to renew",

Tuberculosis Antigenic property: Group specificity is due to polysaccharide while type specificity is due to a protein antigen. Antibodies are not useful for diagnosis and immunity. Pathogenicity: Macrophages are the primary cells infected by M. tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis replicated within the macrophages (phagosome) by blocking fusion of phagosome and Lysosome. It is due to the escape of killing by macrophages and induction of type IV hypersensitivity. Factors contributing to pathogenesis: Cord factor, Lipoarabinomannan, Complement system, M. tuberculosis heat shock proteins.

Prostate cancers are graded according to their dysplasia, utilizing the Gleason scoring system. Sarcoma of the prostate accounts for 0. 1% of all malignant prostatic tumors. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most frequent mesenchymal tumor within the prostate, and is seen almost exclusively in childhood. Seminomas are not seen within the prostate. Seminoma is a germ cell tumor of the testis. Primary squamous carcinoma of the prostate is rare and is associated with a poor survival. More commonly, squamous differentiation occurs in the primary and metastatic deposits of adenocarcinomas after estrogen therapy. Also Know: Over 75% of cancers occur in the outer pa of the gland--mainly in the posterior pa. The most widely used and the one that correlates best with survival is Gleason's system, which uses two numbers representing the two predominant patterns in the tumor. The best- and worst-differentiated patterns, according to this system, are 1, 1 (pure grade 1 lesions) and 5, 5 (pure grade 5 lesions), respectively; a grade 2, 4 carcinoma would show a mixture of moderately and poorly differentiated areas.

TURNER'S SYNDROME Turner's syndrome is the most common sex chromosomal disorder in phenotypic females. Turner's syndrome results from complete or paial loss of one X chromosome (45, X) and is characterised by hypogonadism in phenotypic females Features of Turner syndrome in children The most severely affected patients generally present during infancy with edema (owing to lymph stasis) of the dorsum of the hand and foot and sometimes swelling of the nape of the neck. Swelling of the neck is related to markedly distended lymphatic channels, producing so called cystic hygroma. As these infants develop, the swelling subsides but often leave bilateral neck webbing and persistent looseness of skin on the back of the neck. Congenital heart disease is also common, paicularlypreducta/ coarctation of. Aoa and bicuspid Aoic valve. C. V. S abnormalities are most impoant cause of moality in children with Turner's syndrome. Features of Turner's syndrome in Adolescents and Adult At pubey there is failure to develop normal secondary sex characteristics. The genitalia remains infantile, breast development is inadequate and there is little pubic hair. Nipples are widely spaced. Turner syndrome is the single most impoant cause of primary amenorrhoea accounting for approximately '13 of the cases. Sho stature (height rarely exceeds 150 cm). The mental status of these patients is usually normal but subtle defects in nonverbal, visual spatial information processing have been noted (mental retardation is associated with the presence of extra chromosome not with loss of X chromosome).

Low white cell counts maybe due to a recent infection such as a cold/flu. It can also be associated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, myelofibrosis and aplastic anemia. HIV and AIDS are also a threat to white cells. Other causes of low white blood cell count include: Influenza, systemic lupus erythematosus, Hodgkin's lymphoma, some types of cancer, typhoid, malaria, tuberculosis, dengue, Rickettsial infections, enlargement of the spleen, folate deficiencies, psittacosis and sepsis. Many other causes exist, such as a deficiency in ceain minerals such as copper and zinc. Medications which can cause leukopenia include- Clozapine- Immunosuppressive drugs, such as sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and cyclosporine. Interferons used to treat multiple sclerosis, can also cause leukopenia.- The antidepressant and smoking addiction treatment drug (Bupropion HCL) can also cause leukopenia with long-term use.- Minocycline, is also known to cause leukopenia.- Divalproex sodium or valproic acid. Decreased white blood cell count may be present in cases of arsenic toxicity- Lamotrigine, has been associated with a decrease in white blood cell count. Pseudoleukopenia. It can develop upon the onset of infection. The leukocytes (predominately neutrophils, responding to injury first) are marginalized in the blood vessels so that they can scan for the site of infection.

Cut surface exudes blood-stained frothy fluid. There is dilatation and congestion of alveolar capillaries. There are few neutrophils and numerous bacteria in the alveolar fluid. 2. Stage of red hepatization (early consolidation) The term hepatization refers to liver-like consistency of the affected lobe on cut section. The affected lobe is red and firm. The edema fluid of preceding stage is replaced by strands of fibrin. There is marked cellular exudate of neutrophils with extravasation of red cells. 3. Stage of gray hepatizatioa (late consolidation) The affected lobe is grayish brown, firm and dry. The fibrin strand are dense and more numerous. There is progressive disintigration of red cells and neutrophils. The macrophages begin to appear in the exudate. The organisms are less numerous and appear as degenerated forms. 4. Resolution The previously solid and fibrinous constituent is liquefied by enzymatic action. Granular and fragmented strands of fibrin in the alveolar spaces are seen due to progressive enzymatic digestion. There is progressive removal of fluid content as well as cellular exudate from the air spaces, resulting in restoration of normal lung parenchyma with areation. B.

Similar cells may be found in both the alveolar septa and the air spaces in the lung. In contrast to other lipid storage diseases, Gaucher cells rarely appear vacuolated but instead have a fibrillary type of cytoplasm likened to crumpled tissue paper. Gaucher cells are often enlarged, sometimes up to 100? m in diameter, and have one or more dark, eccentrically placed nuclei. Periodic acid-Schiff staining is usually intensely positive. With the electron microscope the fibrillary cytoplasm can be resolved as elongated, distended lysosomes, containing the stored lipid in stacks of bilayers.",

Conditions causing hypoproteinemia are a nephrotic syndrome, liver cirrhosis, protein-losing enteropathy, and PEM. 3) Defective removal of interstitial fluid by lymphatics: It is due to lymphatic obstruction, which may be inflammatory, neoplastic, post-surgical and post-irradiation. 4) Increased vascular permeability: It occurs in acute and chronic inflammation, and during angiogenesis (new vessels are leaky). 5) Sodium (salt) and water retention: It causes expansion of plasma volume (hydrostatic pressure) and dilution of plasma proteins (\u2193 osmotic pressure).

Because the lungs have a dual blood supply. In patients with adequate cardiovascular function, the bronchial arterial supply can often sustain the lung parenchyma despite obstruction to the pulmonary arterial system. Pulmonary embolism usually causes infarction only when the circulation is already inadequate as in patients with heart or lung disease. For this reason, pulmonary infarcts tend to be uncommon in the young. Consequences of pulmonary embolism The effects of pulmonary embolism depend mainly on the size of the occluded vessel, the number of emboli, and on cardiovascular status of the patients. The following consequences can result. 1. Asymptomatic Most pulmonary emboli (60% to 80%) are clinically silent because they are small. With time, they undergo organization and are incorporated into the vascular wall. 2. Sudden death (cardiovascular collapse) Massive pulmonary embolism may result in instantaneous death, without occurrence of chest pain and dyspnea. 3. Acute cor pulmonale (Acute right heart failure) Numerus small emboli may obstruct most of the pulmonary circulation resulting in acute heart failure. 4. Pulmonary infarction Embolic obstruction of small end-arteriolar pulmonary branches can cause pulmonary infarction. About three-fourths of all infarcts affect the lower lobes, and in more than half, multiple lesions occur. Characteristically, they extend to the periphery of the lung substance as a wedge with the apex pointing toward the kilns of the lung. The pulmonary infarct is classically hemorrhagic infarct. 5. Pulmonary hemorrhage Embolic obstruction of medium-sized arteries may result in pulmonary hemorrhage. 6. Pulmonary hypertension Multiple emboli over time may cause pulmonary hypertension with right heart failure.",

The extracardiac organs involved commonly are? Lung (most common) Kidney Brain Lung Pressure in the pulmonary veins increases and transmitted retrogradely to capillaries and aeries. This results in pulmonary congestion and pulmonary-edema - Wet lung. There is perivascular and interstitial transdate, paicularly in the interlobular septa responsible for kerley's `B' lines on X-rays. Edematous fluid accumulates in alveoli.

The clinical manifestations of LVF are primarily due to these changes in lungs - Dysnea, ohopnea, paroxysomal nocturnal dysnea. Kidney Decreased cardiac output causes a reduction in renal perfusion.

Which of the following factors is MOST likely implicated in the pathogenesis of this neoplasm?",
        "exp": "The neoplasm described here is known as lymphoepithelioma, an inappropriate designation that emphasizes the histologic features of a lymphocyte-rich squamous cell carcinoma. This tumor, AKA nasopharyngeal carcinoma, is the most frequent childhood malignancy in ceain African regions and one of the most frequent adult tumors in southern China. Epstein-Barr virus genome has been identified in most of these neoplasms. Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for a number of malignant neoplasms, such as lung cancer. In the upper respiratory tract, cigarette smoking is a strong predisposing factor for laryngeal carcinoma, but it has not been linked to the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Radiation injury is a well-known risk factor for many human neoplasms, such as leukemia and thyroid cancer, but not for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Although any cell type is susceptible to neoplastic transformation by radiation, there is a so of hierarchy of vulnerability. The most frequent radiation-induced cancers are leukemias and thyroid carcinoma, followed by breast, lung, and salivary gland tumors. Skin, bone, and the gastrointestinal tract are least vulnerable to radiation carcinogenesis. Overexpression of the bcl-2 gene is found in most B-cell follicular lymphomas. bcl-2 is a member of a large family of genes that regulate apoptosis. bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis, so that its overexpression allows neoplastic lymphocytes to survive for long periods and accumulate progressively in lymph nodes and bone marrow.
