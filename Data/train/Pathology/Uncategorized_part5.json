These surface buds detach loose, the entire cell thus is fragmented and released as loose paicles known as the apoptotic bodies. A whole shrunk, shrivelled up and eosinophilic cell is also known as a mummified cell. The best example for this process is seen in the liver in all conditions of hepatitis. The apoptotic cell lies free in the sinusoid. These bodies are known as Councilman Bodies. Gamna-Gandy bodies represent organized foci of hemorrhage within the spleen, usually caused by poal hypeension and rarely observed in children. Russell Bodies are smooth rounded bodies which occur in the cytoplasm of plasma cells, paicularly in chronically inflamed tissues and in the plasma cell neoplasms, multiple myeloma or plasmacytoma.

        "exp": "Ans. D: Prostatic carcinoma An elevated level of a tumor marker can indicate cancer; however, there can also be other causes of the elevation. Tumor markers can be produced directly by the tumor or by non-tumor cells as a response to the presence of a tumor. As used in oncology, they are as follows: - Screening for common cancers on a population basis Example: elevated prostate specific antigen suggests prostate cancer. - Monitoring of cancer survivors after treatment Example: elevated AFP in a child previously treated for teratoma suggests relapse with endodermal sinus tumor. - Diagnosis of specific tumor types, paicularly in ceain brain tumors and other instances where biopsy is not feasible. Tumor markers can be classified in two groups: Cancer-specific markers and tissue-specific markers. - Cancer-specific markers: An example of a cancer-specific marker, CEA, or carcinoembryonic antigen, is a blood-borne protein, first noted to be produced by tumors of the gastrointestinal system. Fuher investigation showed that it was produced by the occasional lung and breast cancer case, meaning that an elevated level does not mean a bowel cancer. However, in a patient with a history of a treated bowel cancer, a rising CEA level can be an early sign of bowel cancer return. A sequence of steady low CEA readings can provide much needed reassurance to the post-operative patient. Also, a rising sequence of CEA readings should ale the physician to the need for diagnostic tests such as PET scans. - Tissue-specific markers: Tissue-specific markers are related to specific tissues which have developed cancer. Generally speaking, these substances are not specifically related to the tumor, and may be present at elevated levels when no cancer is present. Examples include PSA, beta-HCG - (Human chorionic gonadotropin), AFP - (Alpha-fetoprotein), AFP-L3 - (a lectin-reactive AFP) and Thyroglobulin. For example, if man has an elevated PSA, a search for prostate cancer will be undeaken. If an individual has an elevated level of beta-HCG, AFP or AFP-L3%, a search for a testicular or liver cancer, respectively, will be made. PSA (Prostate specific antigen) is produced by the normal prostate. It is a protein enzyme called a serine protease that usually acts as an anticoagulant to keep semen liquid. Only small amounts leak into the circulation in normal circumstances. Enlarged prostates leak more substantial amounts, and cancerous prostates also leak substantial amounts. o Beta-hCG: Elevated levels cannot prove the presence of a tumor, and low levels do not rule it out (an exception is in males who do not naturally produce beta-hCG). Neveheless, elevated beta-hCG levels fall after successful treatment (e.g. surgical intervention or chemotherapy) and a recurrence can often be detected by the finding of rising levels.",

        "exp": "Cytokines action Septic shock is caused by vasodilation and peripheral pooling of blood as a pa of systemic immune reaction to bacterial or fungal infection. Septic shock was earlier also known as endotoxic shock because it was believed to be most commonly associated with endotoxin secreted due to gram negative bacteria. Currently, septic shock is most .frequently triggered by grain positive bacterial infections followed by gram negative bacteria and fungi. Hence the older synonym of \"endotoxic shock\" is not appropriate. Septic shock may be caused by either gram positive or gram negative bacteria. The microbial triggers for septic shock are different in different bacterias :- - Grain negative bacteria --> * Lipopolysaccharide entotoxin - Gram positive bacteria * Lipoteichoic acid Cell wall murantyl peotide 'Superantigens Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin The primary initial event in endotoxic shock is release of cytokines irrespective of whether it is caused by gram positive or gram negative organism -The sequence of events leading to the production of primary cytokines is different in gram negative and grain positive bacterias but the result is the same i.e. both the gram (-ye) and gram (+ve) bacterias leads to production of same mediators of inflammation i.e. TNFa and IL-1. The sequence of events after the release of primary mediators of inflammation is same in both the types of bacteria. - Once the primary cytokines i.e. TNFa and IL-1 are released they activate endothelium and leucocytes to release secondary mediators. - The secondary mediators cause vasodilatation, vascular leak and endothelial damage. So two mechanisms are impoant in septic shock :- i) Release of primary mediators of inflammation TNFa and IL-1. ii) Activation and damage to endothelium Damage to endothelium leads to systemic inflammatory response which causes vasodilation and permeability leading to septic shock. But the initial primary event is the release of primary mediators of inflammation cytokines as a result of interaction between bacterial cell wall components and host cell. The endothelium is subsequently activated and damaged by these mediators (cytokines). Therefore cytokine release is the primary initiating factor in endotoxic shock.",

        "exp": "Ans. B: Actinomycetes Mycetoma is a chronic localized granulomatous inflammatory lesion common in the tropics and sub-tropics. Multiple siAuses, soft tissue swelling and discharge of coloured granules characterize a mycetoma foot. Chronic sinuses discharging granules are caused by (1) Eumycetes (true fungi), (2) Schizomycetes, which includes Actinomycosis (aerobic higher filamentous bacteria) and Botryomycosis (bacterial infection). - Actinomycosis is often caused by Actinomadura or Nocardia species wherein it gains entry after penetrating trauma (splinter, gravel or thorn prick). Young males are commonly affected and 75% of the lesions occur in the lower limbs. The disease slowly progresses from a nodule to multiple sinuses discharging coloured granules. Involvement of bone is late following dermal and soft tissue spread. - Botryomycosis (a misnomer), a chronic suppurative infection is caused by bacteria involving skin or viscera . This rare condition mimics a deep mycotic infection and is often caused by Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas species of bacteria. The feet and hands are commonly affected and penetrating trauma may be a predisposing factor. It usually presents as a nodule, sinus or ulcer, which is initially localized. The diagnosis of actinomycosis is based on clinical findings, demonstration of characteristic granules and culture of the organism from a deep tissue biopsy. Immunological studies (counter immuno electrophoresis and ELISA) are also used. Botryomycosis is diagnosed based on a positive gram's stain and culture; negative fungal cultures and demonstration of the characteristic botryomycotic granules at histopathology from a deep biopsy. In endemic areas, subcutaneous swelling with sinuses should be considered as mycetoma unless proved otherwise. The differential diagnosis includes chronic osteomyelitis, tuberculosis and chronic abscesses.",

        "question": "A 69-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room after falling off a step stool and fracturing her hip. Her past medical history is significant for several bouts of pneumonia during the past year. Laboratory results indicate a normal white blood cell count, but platelets are decreased, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated. X-rays reveal multiple lytic bone lesions. Serum electrophoresis demonstrates an M-protein spike. Which of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "The patient is suffering from multiple myeloma, a neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells (or their precursors) found within the bone marrow. These malignant cells are responsible for the production of excessive amounts of immunoglobulin (usually IgG or IgA), producing an M- protein spike, and increasing the ESR. The decreased platelet count probably reflects infiltration of the bone marrow by myeloma cells. It is not unusual for patients with malignant myeloma to have recurring bacterial infections, paicularly pneumococcal pneumonia, because the overall production of normal immunoglobulins of all isotypes is decreased. Lytic bone lesions due to infiltration by myeloma cells may lead to pathological fractures. All of the other disorders listed can be associated with an M-protein spike, but this is a nonspecific finding. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is ruled out by the normal white count, since this type of leukemia is generally associated with an absolute lymphocytosis. Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance are generally asymptomatic, although they have a predisposition for subsequently developing myeloma, lymphoma, amyloidosis, or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Plasmacytoma (solitary myeloma) is a rare, isolated plasma cell neoplasm in bone or soft tissues. If the primary cancer is in bone, it is likely to disseminate; extraosseous tumors tend to remain localized. Since this patient had multiple lytic bone lesions, multiple myeloma is the correct diagnosis. Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C.R. (1998). Chapter 30. The Lymphoid System: III.

        "exp": "The free radical theory of oxygen toxicity explains the mechanism of oxygen toxicity. According to the theory, various highly reactive and potentially cytotoxic free-radical products of oxygen are generated metabolically in the cell. These sho-lived oxygen metabolites, including superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and singlet oxygen, have been shown to be capable of effects such as inactivation of sulfhydryl enzymes, interaction with and disruption of DNA, and peroxidation of unsaturated membrane lipids with resultant loss of membrane integrity. The cell is also equipped with an array of antioxidant defenses, including the enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, vitamin E, and ascorbate. Under hypoxia, the intracellular generation and influx of free radicals is believed to increase markedly and may overwhelm the detoxifying capacity of the normal complement of antioxidant defenses, with resultant cytotoxicity. The pathology of oxygen toxicity in the lungs is non-specific and consists of atelectasis, edema, alveolar hemorrhage, inflammation, fibrin deposition, and thickening and hyalinization of alveolar membranes.

Catarrhal inflammation o An inflammatory process that occurs in mucous membrane and is characterized by increased blood flow to the mucosal vessels, edema of interstitial tissue, enlargment of the secretory gland epithelial cells, and profuse discharge of mucus and epithelial debris. o It is very common, and mostly occurs in mucosal membrane of nose, pharynx and ear after upper respiratory tract infection or irritation. o It can also occur in other mucosal surfaces, e.g., GIT. 2. Serous inflammation o Marked by outpouring of a thin, serous fluid that is derived either from plasma or the secretion of mesothelial cell lining the peritoneal, pleural or pericardial cavity. The most common example is blister resulting from burn. Fibrinous inflammation o It occurs due to more severe injury when there is increased vascular permeability and larger molecules such as fibrinogen pass the vascular barrier, and fibrin is formed and deposited in the extracellular space. o It is seen in cavities, e.g., meninges, pericardium and pleura. Suppurative or Purulent inflammation It is characterized by the production of large amount ofpus (neutrophils + necrotic cells & debris + edema fluid). It is typically seen after infection with pyogenic bacteria e.g., staphylococci. A common example of an acute suppurative inflammation is acute appendicitis. Abscess is localized collection of purulent inflammatory tissue. 5. Ulcer (Ulcerative inflammation) An ulcer is a local defect, or excavation, of the surface of an organ or tissue that is produced by the sloughing (shedding) of inflammatory necrotic tissue. Ulceration occurs when tissue necrosis and resultant inflammation exist on or near a surface. It is seen in --> Inflammatory necrosis of mucosa of mouth, stomach, duodenum or genitourinary tract, and Subcutaneous inflammation of lower extremities in older persons who have circulatory disturbances that predispose to extensive necrosis.",

        "exp": "Ans. A: AtrophyThe lipofuscin pigment may impa a brownish discoloration to tissues when present in sufficient amounts (atrophy).Lipofuscin is an insoluble pigment which represents the indigestible residue of autophagic vacuoles within cells formed during aging or atrophy.The following is the manner in which lipofuscin is formed:\"During atrophy and aging, degenerating cellular organelles are enclosed in autophagic vacuoles.Subsequently, lysosomes discharge their hydrolytic enzymes into these membrane bounded vacuoles and the cellular organelles are digested by autophagy.However, some of the organelle components may resist digestion or be incompletely digested. (Lipoproteins and other lipids make up most of the indigestible debris and their accumulation reflect the lack of sufficient quantities of lipase in most lysosomes.)When organelles are not digested completely, the debris persists as membrane-bounded residual bodies. Some of these residual bodies may be extruded from the cytoplasm, or may be eventually digested.However, in some instances, the residual bodies persist in cytoplasm of atrophic or aging cells.Lipofuscin occurs in a variety of organs and tissues, but it see specially prominent in the brain neurons, myocardial cells and in the adrenal and thyroid glands.Vitamin E deficiency may accentuate lipofuscin formation.",

On physical examination, she appears pale and has slightly yellow sclerae and an enlarged spleen. Blood tests reveal severe anemia and mild, mostly unconjugated, hyperbilirubinemia. Coombs test is positive at 37 C but negative at 0-4 C. This patient developed anemia because of?",
        "exp": "First, what type of anemia is it? It must be a hemolytic form, since it is associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (hence the yellow sclerae), resulting from increased destruction of red blood cells. Increased erythrocyte destruction is the cause (not the effect) of splenomegaly. Fuhermore, a positive Coombs test implies that hemolysis is mediated by antibodies attached to red blood cells. Thus, the correct choice must be either IgG or IgM. Since the Coombs test is positive at warm temperature (37 C), the antibody is a warm agglutinin. Warm agglutinins are viually always of IgG type and may be triggered by a variety of disorders, including lymphomas, drugs, and autoimmune diseases such as SLE. IgG-coated red cells are then sequestered by the spleen, where hemolysis occurs, thus explaining splenomegaly. By contrast, cold agglutinins are IgM and can be demonstrated by Coombs test at cold temperature (0-4 C). Cold agglutinins are usually triggered by Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection or lymphomas. Note: Bone marrow aplasia is due to failure or suppression of myeloid stem cells, with decreased production of red blood cells, platelets, and leukocytes (pancytopenia). Most commonly, this condition is caused by chemical agents (especially drugs such as chloramphenicol, phenylbutazone, alkylating agents, and antimetabolites) or total body irradiation. Renal failure causes normochromic, normocytic anemia because of decreased synthesis of erythropoietin. Erythropoietin administration is currently the standard treatment for this form of anemia. Although renal failure is a frequent consequence of SLE, there is no evidence that it plays a role in this patient's anemia. Ref: Reid M.E. (2010). Chapter 137. Erythrocyte Antigens and Antibodies.

        "question": "Endotoxin shock is initiated by -",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., Cytokines action Septic shock Septic shock is the condition where shock is caused by infection. Currently, septic shock is most frequently triggered by gram positive bacterial infections, followed by gram? nagative bacteria and fungi. Hence, the older synonym of \"endotoxic shock\" is not appropriate. - Robbin's 8th/e 130. Pathogenesis of septic shock Septic shock is caused by gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The microbial triggers for septic shock are. i) Gram negative bacteria : - Lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin). Gram positive bacteria : - Lipoteichoic acid, cell wall muramyl peptide, Superantigens (Staphylococal TSST, Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin). The initial event caused by all these trigers is the release of cytokines; However, mechanism is different : ? i) Gram negative bacteria (Endotoxic shock) o Lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) of gram negative organism has a core of lipid A and a complex polysaccharide coat. o Lipid A moiety of LPS bind to lipopolysaccharide binding protein and this complex then binds to CD-14 on the surface of monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. o After that LPS is transferred to toll like receptor - o Signals from TLR-4 directly activate endothelium and leukocytes. ii) Gram positive bacteria may cause septic shock by : ? o Gram positive bacteria may cause septic shock by : ? i) Lipoteichoic acid of cell wall binds to toll like receptor-2 (TLR2) on the surface of monocyte/ macrophages and triggers the release of cytokines. ii) Superantigens are potent activators of T-lymphocytes. Superantigens bind directly to the lateral poion of TCR $ chain and MHC class II 13 chain and stimulate T-cells directly. Activated T-cells release IFN-y and IL-2 which stimulate macrophages to release primary cytotoxines. o All these result in release ofprimary cytokines. The impoant cytokines are TNF-a (most impoant cytokine in shock), IL-1 (2nd most impoant, IL-6). o After release of cytokines, the sequence of events is same for any type of septic shock : - a These cytokines activate endothelium and leukocytes which then release secondary mediators like NO, PAF, PG, LT, IL. (NO is responsible for vasodilation in septic shock). These secondary mediators cause vasodilatation, vascular leak and endothelial damage that results in shock. Release of excess primary mediators (cytokines) (TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6) Endothelial/leukocyte molecular activation Secondary mediators (NO, PAF, PG, LT, IL) Vasodilatation, capillary leak, endothelial damage Septic shock --> MODS --> Death So two mechanisms are impoant in septic shock :- i) Release of primary mediators of inflammation TNF? and IL-I. ii) Activation and damage to endothelium o Damage to endothelium leads to systemic inflammatory response which causes vasodilation and permeability leading to septic shock. o But the initial primary event is the release of primary mediators of inflammation cytokines as a result of interaction between bacterial cell wall components and host cell. The endothelium is subsequently activated and damaged by these mediators (cytokines). Therefore cvtokine release is the primary initiating factor in endotoxic shock. Infection (bacteria, fungi) Interaction of bacterial cell products with macrophages Release of primary mediation (cytokines) from macrophages Activation and damage to endothelium Release of secondary mediators o Vasodilation o Increased permeability o Decreased perfusion",

        "question": "Early diagnosis of acute hepatitis B infection is done by: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. B: Presence of IgM anti-HBc in serum Although HBsAg is the earliest virological marker in serum of patients with acute hepatitis B, it does not help in establishing the diagnosis of acute Hepatitis B infection (it may be seen in chronic cases or carrier state) It is the presence of IgM anti-HBc that confirms an acute Hepatitis B infection HBsAg The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is most frequently used to screen for the presence of this infection. It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection. However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host. Anti-HBc IgM The infectious virion contains an inner \"core paicle\" enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core paicle is made of 180 or 240 copies of core protein, alternatively known as hepatitis B core antigen, or HBcAg. During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) may be the only serological evidence of disease. HbeAg and anti-HBe Sholy after the appearance of the HBsAg, the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) will appear. Traditionally, the presence of HBeAg in a host's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivity During the natural course of an infection, the HBeAg may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen (anti-HBe) will arise immediately afterwards. This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication. Anti-HBs and anti-HBc IgG If the host is able to clear the infection, eventually the HBsAg will become undetectable and will be followed by IgG antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen and core antigen, (anti-HBs and anti HBc IgG). The time between the removal of the HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs is called the window period. A person negative for HBsAg but positive for anti-HBs has either cleared an infection or has been vaccinated previously. Hepatitis B carriers Individuals who remain HBsAg positive for at least six months are considered to be hepatitis B carriers. Carriers of the virus may have chronic hepatitis B, which would be reflected by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and inflammation of the liver, as revealed by biopsy. Carriers who have seroconveed to HBeAg negative status, paicularly those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others. PCR tests They have been developed to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in clinical specimens. These tests are used to assess a person's infection status and to monitor treatment. Individuals with high viral loads, characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy.",

In these regions HBV carrier state begins in infancy following veical transmission of virus from infected mothers, conferring a 200 fold increased risk for HCC by adulthood. Other major etiological associations for liver carcinoma are ? o Chronic alcoholism o Tyrosinemia o Food contaminants (primarily aflatoxins derived from Aspergillus flavus) o Hereditary hemochromatosis Clinical features of hepatocellular carcinoma ? o The clinical manifestations of hepatocellular carcinoma are not characteristic of hepatocellular carcinoma. The symptoms of hepatocellular carcinoma are often masked by symptoms of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. o In most cases hepatocellular carcinoma presents as an ill defined upper abdominal pain and an abdominal mass. o Elevated level of serum alphafetoproteins are seen in 50 - 75% cases. o Hepatocellular carcinomas have a strong propensity for invasion of vascular channels. Extensive intrahepatic metastasis occurs and the tumour occasionally invades the poal vein or inferior venacava. o Unresected hepatocellular carcinoma has a very poor prognosis. Patients rarely survive beyond 4 months after the diagnosis. The 5 year survival rate after curative resection is 35% to 50%. o The fibrolamellar variant of the HCC is associated with a more ourable prognosis.

Morphological changes in FSGS Sclerosis of some glomeruli with involvement of only a poion of capillary tuft. Collapse of GBM. Increase in matrix. Segmental insudation of plasma proteins along the capillary wall (Hyalinosis). Lipid droplets and foam cells. Diffuse effacement of foot processes characteristic of minimal change disease, but in addition, there is focal detachment of the epithelial cells with denudation of the underlying GBM. IgM and C3 deposits in sclerosed area and in the mesangium. Collapsing glomerulopathy It is a morphological variant of FSGS. Characterized by collapse and sclerosis of the entire glomerular tuft in addition to the usual FSGS lesions. A characteristic feature is proliferation and hyperophy of glomerular visceral epithelial cells (podocytes). There is prominent tubular injury with formation of microeystes. It is the most characteristic lesion of HIV nephropathy. Epithelial damage is the hallmark of FSGS. Following information has been added in 81h/e of Robbins Sclerosis is characterized by accumulations of extracellular collagenous matrix, either confined to mesangial areas involving the capillary loops or both. The sclerosing process may also result in obliteration of capillary lumens in affected glomeruli. In contrast Hyalinosis refers to accumulation of homogeneous, amorphous, eosinophic material into glomerular structure. Hyaline is made up of plasma proteins that have insudated from circulation into glomerular structure. Hyalinosis may also result in obliteration of cappillary lumen of glomerular toff. Hyalinosis is usually a consequence of endothelial or capillary wall injury and typically the end result of various form of glomerular damage. It is a common feature of FSGS.",

B: DuodenumZollinger-Ellison syndrome is a disorder where increased levels of the hormone gastrin are produced, causing the stomach to produce excess hydrochloric acid.Often the cause is a tumor (gastrinoma) of the duodenum or pancreas producing the hormone gastrin. Gastrin then causes an excessive production of acid which can lead to peptic ulcers in almost 95% of patients.Gastrinomas may occur as single tumors or as multiple, small tumors. About one-half to two-thirds of single gastrinomas are malignant tumors that most commonly spread to the liver and lymph nodes near the pancreas and small bowel.

There are some confusion because of the changes in 881/e Robbin's Bobbin's 7th/e clearly states that (p7) The massive physiologic growth of uterus during pregnancy is a good example of hormone induced increase in the size of an organ that results from both hyperophy and hyperplasia But Robbin 8thie says (P 6-7) The massive physiological growth of the uterus during pregnancy is a good example of hormone induced increase in the size of an organ that results mainly .from hyperophy of muscle .fibres. The cellular enlargement is stimulated by estrogenic hormones acting on smooth muscles estrogen receptors. About Breast enlargement during pregnancy and pubey Bobbin's 8th le p. 8 says Hormonal hyperplasia is well illustrated by the proliferation of glandular epithelium t.f.female breast at pubey and during pregnancy usually accompanied by enlargement (hyperophy of glandular epithelial cells). Hyperophy Hyperophy refers to an increase in the size of cells resulting in an increase in size of the organ. Hyperplasia It is an increase in the number of cells in an organ or tissue usually resulting in increased volume of the organ or tissue. Hyperplasia takes place if the cellular population is capable of synthesizing DNA, thus permiting mitotic division, in contrast, hyperophy involves cell enlargement without cell division. Although hyperplasia and hyperophy are two distinct processes, sometimes they may occur together. - For example hormone induced growth in the uterus during pregnancy involves both increased number of smooth muscles and epithelial cells and the enlargement of these cells (i.e. both hyperophy and hyperplasia). - The cellular hyperophy is stimulated by estrogenic hormones acting on smooth muscle estrogen receptors, eventually resulting in increased synthesis of smooth muscle proteins and an increase in cell size. Muscular hyperophy One of the most common and visible forms of organ hyperophy occurs in skeletal muscles in response to strength training. The muscle cells in both the hea and the skeletal muscles are capable of tremendous hyperophy perhaps because they cannot adequately adopt to increased demands by mitotic division and production of more cells to share the work. The most common stimulus for muscle hyperophy is increased workload. For example the bulging muscles of bodybuilders engaged in \"pumping iron\" result from an increase in size of the individual muscle fibres in response to increased demand. The workload is thus shared by a greater mass of cellular components and each muscle fibre is spared excess work and so escapes injury. The enlarged muscle cell achieves a new equilibrium, permitting it to function at a higher level of activity. In the hea, the stimulus for hyperophy is usually a chronic hemodynamic overload resulting from either hypeension or faulty values. Synthesis of more proteins and filaments occur, achieving a balance b/w the demand and the cell's functional capacity. The greater number of myofilaments per cell permits an increased workload with a level of metabolic activity per unit volume of cell not different from that borne by the normal cell. Breast enlargement during lactation occurs due to hyperophy of the cells caused by the action of prolactin and estrogen on breast. Breast hyperplasia occurs during pubey and pregnancy.",

Calcium\u00a0entry into dead or dying cells is usual, owing to the inability of such cells to maintain a steep calcium gradient.\n\nPathological calcification\n\nPathological calcification is the abnormal deposition of calcium salts in soft tissue.\nIt is of two types\n\nA) Metastatic\n\nMetastatic calcification reflects deranged calcium metabolism.\nIt\u2019s a change associated with an increased calcium concentration in the serum.\nIn general, almost any disorder that increases the serum calcium level can lead to calcification in locations as the\u00a0alveolar septa of the lung, renal tubules and blood vessels.\nThe fundamental abnormality is the pathological entry of the same amount of ionic calcium into the cell organelle, chiefly the mitochondria (it is suggested that mitochondria are the organelles first involved in the pathogenesis\u00a0of metastatic calcification).\n\nSites of metastatic calcification\n\nBasement membrane & tubular lamina of kidney\nAlveolar wall of lungs (most common site)\nThe interstitial tissue of gastric mucosa\nSystemic arteries\nPulmonary veins\nCornea & conjunctiva\nSynovium of the joint\nTendons\nThese sites are prone to calcification because these tissues loose acid and therefore have the alkaline internal\u00a0environment. Alkaline pH favours precipitation of calcium salts.\n\nB) Dystrophic calcification\n\nDystrophic calcification refers to the macroscopic deposition of calcium salts in injured tissues. This type of\u00a0calcification does not simply reflect an accumulation of calcium derived from the bodies of dead cells but rather\u00a0represents an extracellular deposition of calcium from the circulation or interstitial fluid.\u00a0\nDenatured proteins in dead or irreversibly damaged tissue preferentially bind phosphate ions. Phosphate t ions\u00a0react with calcium ions to form a precipitate or calcium phosphate. Thus necrotic tissue serves as calcium sink.\nIn many locations such as in a case of tuberculous caseous necrosis in the lung or lymph nodes, calcification\u00a0has no functional consequences.\nDystrophic calcification may also occur in crucial locations such as in mitral or aortic valves after rheumatic\u00a0fever. In such instances, calcification leads to impeded blood flow because it produces inflexible valve leaflets\u00a0and narrowed valve orifice (mitral and aortic stenosis).\nDystrophic calcification in atherosclerotic coronary artery contributes to narrowing of vessels.\nDystrophic calcification also plays a role in diagnostic radiography,\nMammography is based principally on the detection of calcification in breast cancers.\nDiagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis and infection involving the central nervous system is suggested by\u00a0visualization of calcification in the infant's brain.",

D i.e. Hodgkins lymphomaReed-Sternberg cellsThey are usually derived from B lymphocytes, classically considered crippled germinal center B cells.Seen against a sea of B cells, they give the tissue a moth-eaten appearance.They are named after Dorothy Reed Mendenhall and Carl Sternberg, who provided the first definitive microscopic descriptions of Hodgkin's disease.Reed-Sternberg cells are large and are either multinucleated or have a bibbed nucleus (thus resembling an \"owl's eye\" appearance) with prominent eosinophilic inclusion-like nucleoli.Reed-Sternberg cells are CD30 andCD15 positive, usually negative for CD20 and CD45.The presence of these cells is necessary in the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma - the absence of Reed-Sternberg cells has very high negative predictive value.They can also be found in reactive lymphadenopathy (such as infectious mononucleosis, carbamazepine associated lymphadenopathy) and very often in other types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas.A special type of Reed-Sternberg cells is the lacunar histiocyte, whose cytoplasm retracts when fixed in formalin, so the nuclei give the appearance of cells that lie with empty spaces (called lacunae) between them.These are characteristic of the nodular sclerosis subtype of Hodgkin's lymphoma",

Breaks occur close to the centromere of each chromosome ---> large fragments of both chromoses fuse together and small fragments together formation of one very large chromosome and one very small which is last later). In Down syndrome large fragment of 14 or 15 or 22 chromosome fuses with large fragment of chromosome 21 ---> Extra material comes on 21 and it acts like third 21st chromosome --> Trisomy 21. o In 2% of Down syndrome patients, there is mosaicism, i.e. occurance of two or more different types of populations in the same individual --> 4 A7C/47XX + 21 (mosaicism has already been explained earlier).",

        "exp": "Malignant mixed mullerian tumor is a tumor with 2 components, stromal and epithelial (endometrial glands), both of which are malignant. This is a rare and highly aggressive tumor that has a 25% 5-year survival rate. It usually affects older patients and presents with postmenopausal bleeding. The stromal component can contain metaplastic components such as cailage and bone. Interestingly, usually only the epithelial component metastasizes. Endolymphatic stromal myosis is a type of endometrial stromal tumor of intermediate malignancy. It appears as small pieces of stroma between myometrial bundles that infiltrate lymph channels. Patients may have pain or bleeding, or may be asymptomatic. Recurrences happen late in the course of the disease (years) in half of patients and metastasis occurs in 15%. There is no epithelial component, so this is an incorrect choice. Endometrial carcinoma is a malignancy of the epithelial glandular component of the endometrium. Abnormal bleeding is the usual presentation. High estrogen states cause this tissue to proliferate. There is no stromal component of this tumor, so this is an incorrect choice. Endometrial stromal sarcoma is a true sarcoma arising from the endometrial stroma that infiltrates the myometrium and invades vessels. There is no epithelial component. Ref: DeUgae C.M. (2013).

After isolation of Leishmania the parasite should be cultured to confirm the identity of the Leishmania. The direct visualization of Leishmania amastigotes in peripheral blood smears is an easy method for the diagnosis of symptomatic VL. Among the serological tests ELISA (enzyme linked immunosrbent assay) is the most popular because it is a simple test to perform after collecting the whole blood in a filter paper and used for diagnosis as well as epidemiological studies. Other serological tests used for diagnosis of Kala-azar are Direct Agglutination test (DAT), Indirect Fluorescent Antibody test (IFAT) and rk39 dipstick test.

Fixed atherosclerosis with no change in structureo A fixed obstruction of 75% or greater generally causes symptomatic ischemia induced by excercise --> classical angina.o With this degree of obustruction, the augmented coronary flow provided by compensatory vasodilatation is no longer sufficient to meet even moderate increase in myocardial demand.o A 90% stenosis can lead to inadequate blood flow even at rest.2. Disruption of plaque and acute coronary syndromeo In most patients with MI, unstable angina, and sudden cardiac death, the attack is precipitated by abrupt plaque change (plaque disruption) followed by thrombosis.o Acute plague change (plaque disruption) may be any of the following types ?(a) Rupture/fissuring, exposing highly thrombogenic plaque constituents to blood.(b) Erosion/ulceration, exposing the thrombogenic subendothelial basement membrane to blood.(c) Hemorrhage into the plaque, expanding its volume.o All these changes lead to exposure of the thrombogenic constituents of plaque or vessel wall, this in turn activates platelets and there is platelets aggregation with formation of thrombus.o This can precipitate following acute coronary syndrome -(i) If thrombus occludes the vessel completely --> Transmural myocardial infarction.(ii) If thrombus occludes the vessel paially (incomplete) --> Unstable angina or acute subendocardial infarction.(iii) Paial occlusion by thrombus with possible embolus led to regional myocardial ischemia that induces a fatal ventricular arrhythmia --> sudden cardiac death.3.

Although nodular glomerulosclerosis is classically described in association with diabetes (the so-called \"KimmelstielWilson lesion\"), the lesion is not pathognomonic for diabetic nephropathy. In fact, a number of renal conditions have been seen in association with this distinctive, histologic pattern. The differential diagnosis of non-diabetic, nodular glomerulosclerosis includes, but is not limited to: Immunotactoid glomerulosnephritis Fibrillary glomerulosnephritis Fibronectin glomerulosnephritis Cryoglobulinemic glomerulosnephritis Amyloidosis Light Chain Deposition Disease (LCDD) Heavy Chain Deposition Disease (HCDD) Idiopathic Nodular Glomerulosclerosis In order to determine the specific disease responsible for nodular glomerulosclerosis, a deliberate inspection of the renal biopsy (paicularly, Congo red staining) is required.

        "exp": "Although it is nearly impossible to memorize the staging rules for all the different kinds of tumors, there are several basic principles common to all. The TNM stage of a tumor is determined by the tumor size and extent (T for tumor), lymph node involvement (N for nodes), and metastasis (M for metastasis). N0 always means no lymph nodes are involved. An NI lesion has positive nodes, and only 2nd choice, positive bronchial lymph nodes, changes the patient's nodal status. Involvement of the chest wall is a feature of tumor size and extent-thus, it is a component of the T in TNM-staging. T2 lesions involve the chest wall. Histological features of the tumor, such as small cell morphology are not considered in tumor stage, but rather in tumor grade. Small cell tumors are considered high-grade carcinomas. Tumor extending to the carina reflects the tumor size and extent-thus, it is a component of the T in TNM-staging: T3 lesions involve the carina. Ref: Longo D.L. (2012). Chapter 81.

Aggressive lymphomas associated with HIV.\nThese 3 types are histologically identical. Morphology The tumor exhibits a high mitotic index and contains numerous apoptotic cells,\nthe nuclear remnants of which are phagocytosed by interspersed benign macrophages.\nThese phagocytes have abundant clear cytoplasm, creating a characteristic \u201cstarry sky\u201d pattern. Immunophenotype These are tumors of mature B cells.\nIt express surface IgM, CD 19, CD20, CD 10 and BCL6. a phenotype consistent with a germinal center B-cell origin.\nUnlike other tumors of germinal center origin, this does not express anti-apoptotic protein BCL2.\nMolecular Pathogenesis All forms of Burkin lymphoma are associated with translocations of the c-MYC gene on chromosome 8.\nThe translocation partner is usually the IgH locus  light-chain loci.\nAll endemic tumors are latently infected with EBV. which is also present in about 25% of HIVassociated tumors and 15% to 20% of sporadic cases.\nClinical Features Endemic Burkitt lymphoma often presents as a mass involving the mandible and shows an unusual predilection for involvement of abdominal viscera,\nparticularly the kidneys, ovaries and adrenal glands. Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma most often appears as a mass involving the ileocecum and peritoneum.\nBurkitt lymphoma is very aggressive but responds well to intensive chemotherapy",
