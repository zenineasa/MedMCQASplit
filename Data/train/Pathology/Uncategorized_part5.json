Cells have developed elaborate mechanisms to monitor the integrity of the genetic material. A number of complex multisubunit enzyme systems are involved in repair of damaged DNA or to prevent any error during DNA synthesis. Despite the elaborate proofreading system employed during DNA synthesis, errors including base pairing or inseion of one to a few extra nucleotides can occur. In addition, DNA is constantly being subjected to environmental insults that cause the alteration or removal of nucleotide bases. - Base are also altered or lost spontaneously from mammalian DNA at a rate many thousands per cell per day. - If the damage is not repaired a permanent mutation (genomic instability) may be introduced that can result in any of a number of deleterious effects including loss of control over the proliferation of a mutated cell leading to cancer. Luckily cells are remarkably efficient at repairing damage done to their DNA. When there is a defect in DNA the cell cycle stops for a while, allowing the damaged DNA time for repair. If the DNA cannot be repaired it undergoes apoptosis. Most of the repair systems involve:? - Recognition of the damage on the DNA - Removal or excision of the damage - Replacement or, filling the gap left by excision using sister strand as template for DNA synthesis - Typically genomic instability occurs when both copies of the DNA repair gene are lost, however recent work has suggested that even a subset of these genes may promote cancer in haploinsufficient manner. Persons with defect in DNA repair continue to replicate damaged DNA rather than stopping to allow repair or undergoing apoptosis. -There are several inherited disorders in which genes that encode proteins involved in DNA repair are defective. - Individuals born with such inherited defects in DNA repair proteins are at a greatly increased risk of developing cancer. - The defect in DNA repair protein leads to genomic instability which enables malignancy. - DNA repairing genes themselves are not oncogenic but their abnormalities allow mutations in other genes during the process of normal cell division. Three types of DNA repair defects contributes to different types of cancers Mismatch repair Nucleotide excision repairQ Recombination repair",

Herpes simplex Herpes simplex virus land 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2/ Human herpes virus 1 and 2(HHV-1 and -2) They are two members of the herpes virus family, Herpesviridae, that infect humans. Both HSV-1 (which produces most cold sores) and HSV-2 (which produces most genital herpes) are ubiquitous and contagious. They can be spread when an infected person is producing and shedding the virus. Symptoms of herpes simplex virus infection include watery blisters in the skin or mucous membranes of the mouth, lips or genitals Lesions heal with a scab characteristic of herpetic disease. However, as neurotropic and neuroinvasive viruses, HSV-1 and -2 persist in the body by becoming latent and hiding from the immune system in the cell bodies of neurons. After the initial or primary infection, some infected people experience sporadic episodes of viral reactivation or outbreaks. In an outbreak, the virus in a nerve cell becomes active and is transpoed the neuron's axon to the skin, where virus replication and shedding occur and cause new sores. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis is the most common cause of sporadic fatal encephalitis worldwide. The clinical syndrome is often characterized by the rapid onset of fever, headache, seizures, focal neurologic signs, and impaired consciousness",

AMP inhibit platelet adhesion, aggregation and the release of active substances. Low concentration of c. AMP has an opposite effect. c. AMP is formed by the action of enzyme adenylate cyclase and degraded by phosphodiesterase. Thromboxane A2 (synthesized in platelets) and ADP inhibit adenylate cyclase - c. AMP --) Platelet aggregation and adhesion. Prostacyclin PGI2 (Synthesized in endothelium) stimulates adenylate cyclase c. AMP -* antiaggregatory effect Prostacyclin and thromboxane A, are synthesized from prostaglandins that are formed from arachidonic acid by the action of cycloxygenase. Platelet activation Circulating resting platelets do not stick to healthy endothelium or each other. When there is damage to endothelium, constituents of the subendothelial matrix are exposed especially collagen and von willebrand factor. Platelets attach to these matrix constituents and there is simultaneous release of thromboxane - A2 (TXA 2)and adenosine diphosphate. TX. 4 2 and ADP are proaggregatory and vasoconstrictor mediators - they promote recruitment of additional platelets. These platelets bind to adhesive proteins like fibrinogen or fibrin and von willebrand factor through surface integrin glycoprotein GP Ila/Illb formation of platelet plug. Injury to the blood vessel 1. Transient vasoconstriction and Platelet adhesion to VWF because of Gp Ib receptor Platelets release aggregating agents like ADP and conformational change in Gp IIb-IIIa receptor Synthesis of thromboxane A2 by platelets (Tx A2 causes vasoconstriction and increase attachment of fibrinogen to the Gp IIb-illa receptor Platelets held together by fibrinogen resulting information of temporary platelet plug Thrombin conves fibrinogen into fibrin and formation of stable platelet plug (platelet hod together by fibrin)",

C: Megaloblastic anemia The diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is based on leucopenia with hypersegmented granulocytes, a moderate to severe Megaloblastic anemia, elevated levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid in the serum and low serum vitamin B12. Hypersegmented neutrophil Normally, the number of segments in the nucleus of a neutrophil increases as it matures and ages, after being released into the blood from the bone marrow. Whereas normal neutrophils only contain three or four nuclear lobes (the \"segments\"), hypersegmented neutrophils contain five or more lobes. Hypersegmented neutrophils have classically been thought to be pathognomonic of the megaloblastic anemias (anemias caused by failure of bone marrow blood-forming cells to make DNA, often caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies, or DNA-replication poisons). One of the earliest, notable changes in the peripheral blood in megaloblastic processes is the appearance of hypersegmented neutrophils. Because of the sho life-span of neutrophils, these abnormal hypersegmented neutrophils characteristically appear even before the onset of anemia in megaloblastic processes. Such neutrophils are less often seen in the other classes of anemia, which together are far more common than megaloblastic types of anemia.

Lymphocytosis may develop in response to a number of infections (e. g., brucellosis, whooping cough, hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis, and tuberculosis) or manifest as pa of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Monocytosis refers to an increase in number of monocytes, which are circulating macrophages.

CD 14 binds bacterial LPS (endotoxin) and, as a component of a multimolecular complex, plays an important role in LPS-induced activation, inflammatory response, and innate immunity. LPS is captured by a serum LPS-binding protein and is transported to CD14, which binds the complex. CD14, however, cannot trigger activation because it lacks an intracellular region. This function is mediated by one of a group of molecules known as Toll-like receptors (TLR), as they are structurally homologous to the Toll receptors of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.",

Essentially these tumours make up a family of neoplasms that develop from the paraganglial tissues which are atually chemoreceptor organs that are distributed throughout the body. These chemoreceptor organs are of neural crest origin and have similar functions and similar histological appearance. Their cells of origin are a pa of the diffuse neuroendocrine system (DNES). Paragangliomas are composed of characteristic cell called 'C' cell. The chief cell is probably the principal component involved and seems to be the actual chemoreceptor of the paraganglia containing acetyl choline, catecholamine and serotonin. Chief cell is of neural crest origin and it contains hormone thus it is neuroendocrine in nature. It renders the paraganglia receptive to hypoxia and pH changes and to fluctuations in blood carbon dioxide concentration. These chief cells migrate with the autonomic ganglion cells. They are in close association with the sympathetic ganglia and Aoa in its main branches. Many head and neck paraganglia and their respective neoplasms are distributed in relation to the vessel and cranial nerves of the primitive branchial arches. Because of this they are also called branchiomeric paraganglioma. Pathology of paraganglioma: Like other neuroendocrine tumour the ultrastructure shows dense core granules (neurosecretory grangules) The tumour cells balls are arranged in distinctive cell balls called Zellaballen (the cell balls are composed of chief cells). These cells are separated by fibrovascular stroma and surrounded by sustentacular cells. Immunohistochemistry of paraganglioma Chief cells are neuroendocrine cells and are thus positive for regular neuroendocrine markers e. g. Chromogranin Synaptophysin Neuron specific enolase Serotonin Neurofilament The chief cells are S-100 protein negative but the sustentacular cells are S-100 positive and are focally positive for glial fibrillary acid protein. On histochemistry they are argyrophilic. PAS negative, mucicarnzine negative and argentalfin negative. An impoant point in d/d is that they are never positive for cytokeratin like other neuroendocrine tumours.",

Such injury may be caused by a great variety of initiating insults, the most frequent of which are shock, severe trauma, sepsis, and gastric aspiration. All these different forms of injury result in recruitment of neutrophils within the alveolar capillaries. Neutrophils release chemokines that attract histiocytes and produce oxygen radicals, prostaglandins, and proteases that damage alveolar epithelium. Formation of hyaline membranes is due to a combination of plasma fluid extravasation and alveolar cell necrosis. CD4+ (helper) lymphocytes, CD8+ (cytotoxic) lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells have been implicated in a number of pulmonary diseases, but not in diffuse alveolar damage.

Carcinomas in the superior pulmonary sulcus produce Pancoast syndrome, thus causing pain in the shoulder and along the ulnar nerve distribution of the arm and hand. (These carcinomas also cause Horner syndrome.) These apical lung tumors tend to be locally invasive early.",

A. Physiological hyperplasia o It occurs when there is increased physiological demand e. g (a) Hormonal --> Hyperplasia of endometrium in pregnant uterus, proliferation of the glandular epithelium of female breast at pubey and during pregnancy. (b) Compensatory --> Increase in tissue mass after damage or paial resection, e. g. regeneration of liver after paial hepatectomy. B. Pathological hyperplasia o It occurs when there is increased stimulus under ceain pathologic conditions. o Most forms of pathological hyperplasia are caused by excessive hormonal stimulation or growth factor acting on target cells, e. g., Endometrial hyperplasia due to disturbed estrogen and progesterone balance (with relative excess of estrogen) in menstural cycle. Note: Stimulus for physiologic and pathologic hyperplasia may be the same (e. g., estrogen for endometrial hyperplasia), but in physiologic hyperplasia, the stimulus is due to normal physiologic changes of body e. g., pregnancy, while in pathologic hyperplasia the stimulus is due to ceain pathologic conditions e. g., estrogen secreting ovarian tumor. o Although pathological hyperplasia is abnormal, the process remains controlled --> Hyperplasia regresses if the hormonal stimulation is eliminated. o It is the response to the normal regulatory control mechanisms that distinguishes benign pathological hyperplasia from Cancer, in which the growth control mechanism becomes defective. o However, pathological hyperplasia constitues a feile soil in which cancerous proliferation may eventually arise --> e. g., patients with endometrial hyperplasia are at increase risk of endometrial carcinoma Mechanism of hyperplasia o Hyperplasia is caused by increased production of growth factor or hormones that lead to production of transcription factor that turn on many cellular genes and induce cellular proliferation. o After some type of cell loss, hyperplasia is caused not only by proliferation of cells but also by the development of new cells from stem cells --> e. g., After hepatectomy the hyperplasia is due to proliferation of the remaining hepatocytes, but in chronic hepatitis, intrahepatic stem cells play a major role in hyperplasia as the proliferative capacity of hepatocytes is compromised.",

        "exp": "There are hundreds of mutations within the beta globin gene, but approximately 20 different alleles comprise 80% of the mutations found world wide. Within each geographic population there are unique mutations. Individuals who have beta thalassemia major are usually homozygous for one of the common mutations, or heterozygous for one of the common mutations and one of the geographically-unique mutations. Both lead to absence of beta globin chain production. The beta thalassemia syndromes are much more diverse than the alpha thalassemia syndromes due to the diversity of the mutations that produce the defects in the beta globin gene. Unlike the deletions that constitute most of the alpha thalassemia syndromes, beta thalassemias are caused by mutations on chromosome 11 that affect all aspects of beta globin production: transcription, translation, and the stability of the beta globin product. Most hematologists feel there are three general categories of beta thalassemia: beta thalassemia trait, beta thalassemia intermedia and beta thalassemia major. Splice site mutations also occur and are of clinical consequence, when combined with a thalassemia mutation. Three splice site mutations occur in exon 1 of the beta globin gene. These mutations result in three different abnormal hemoglobins: Malay, E, and Knossos. Hemoglobin E is a very common abnormal hemoglobin in the Southeast Asian population, and when paired with a b0 thalassemia mutation, can produce severe transfusion-dependent (Eb0) thalassemia. Hemoglobin E is described in the section on variant hemoglobins.",

        "question": "Sequence of events in acute inflammation?",
        "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i. e., Transient vasoconstriction --> Vasodilatation -+ Increased permeability --> Stasis Acute inflammation o Acute inflammation is a rapid response to an injurious agent that serves to deliver mediators of host defense, i. e., leukocytes and plasma proteins, to the site of injury. o Acute inflammation has three major steps:? 1. Alteration in vascular caliber that leads to an increase in blood flow, i. e., vasodilatation. Structural changes in the microvasculature that permit plasma proteins and leukocytes to leave the circulation, i. e., Increased vascular permeaility. 3. Emigration of the leukocytes from the microcirculation, their accumulation in the focus of injury, and their activation to eliminate the offending agent i. e., chemotoxis and phagocytosis. o These inflammatory change involve two main components. A. Vascular reaction i. e., changes in blood vssels. B. Cellular reaction i. e., changes in leukocytes. A. Vascular events Vascular changes are essential for inflammation because these changes serve to deliver leukocytes and antibodies (two major mechanisms of host defence against microbes) at the site of injury. Normally leukocytes and immunoglobulins are sequestered inside the vesels and move in the direction of flow. During inflammation blood flow is increased to inflammed area and these leukocytes and immunoglubulin are directed towards the injurious stimulus. 1. Changes in vascular caliber (vasodilatation) o Vasodilatation is one of the earliest manifestations of acute inflammation. o Sometimes, it follows a transient constriction of aerioles, (vasoconstrictions) lasting for a few seconds ---> Though vasodilatation is the earliest manifestation of acute inflammation, it follows a transient period of vasoconstriction. o Vasodilatation first involve aerioles and than results in opening of new capillary beds in the area. o There is increased hydrostatic pressure due to increased blood flow. Change in vascular permeability o Vasodilatation is quickly followed by increased vascular permeability. o Increased vascular permeabily is the hallmark of acute inflammation. o This leads to escape of protein rich fluid (exudate) and leukocytes into extravascular space. o Intravascular osmotic pressure reduces due to exudation of proteins and osmotic pressure of interstitial fluid is increased. o Together with increased hydrostatic pressure and decreased intravascular osmotic pressure leads to fuher outflow of fluid and its accumulation in the interstitial fluid. Change in vascular flow (Stasis) o The loss of fluid results in concentration of red cells and increased viscosity of blood Slower blood flow ---> Stasis B. Cellular events A critical function of inflammation is to deliver leukocytes to the site of injury and to activate the leukocytes to perform their normal functions in host defence. Leukocytes ingest offending agents, kill bacteria and other microbes, and get rid of necrotic tissue and foreign substances. The sequence of events in the journey of leukocytes from the vessel lumen to interstitial tissue is called extravasation. Extravasation involves following steps. 1. In the vessel lumen o As stasis develops, leukocytes principally neutrophils accumulute along the vascular endothelium. This is called margination. o The rows of leukocytes move (tumble) slowly along the endothelium a process called rolling. o Finally coming to at rest, leukocytes adhere firmly to endothelium --> adhesion. o The endothelium can be virually lined by white cells ---> Pavementing. 2. Diapedesis o It is the process of transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelium. o After firm adhesion, leukocytes migrate through interendothelial junctions and assume a position between endothelial cells and the basement membrane. o Eventually, they pierce the basement membrane by secreting collegenase and escape into the extravascular space. o The processes of adhesion and transmigration are regulated largely by the binding of complementry adhesion molecules on the leukocytes and endothelium. o These adhesion molecules include - Selectins, integrins, members of immunoglobulin superfamily and mucin like glycoproteins. o Different cytokines increase surface expression or avidity of these adhesion molecules and enhance adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes. o Leukocyte diapedesis, similar to increased vascular permeability, occurs predominantly in the venules (except in lungs, where it occurs in capillaries). 3. Chemotaxis o After extravasation, leukocytes emigrate into tissues toward the site of injury, along a chemical gradient, a process know as chemotaxis. o The substances that act as chemoattractant may be exogenous (bacterial products) or endogenous (C5a, LT4, IL-8) 4. Leukocyte activation o At the site of inflammation, cytokines induce a number of responses in leukocytes that are pa of defensive functions of leukocytes and are referred as leukocyte activation. o The functional responses that are induced on leukocyte activation are: - i) Production of archidonic acid metabolites (PGs, LTs) as result of activation of phospholipase A,. ii) Degranulation and secretion of lysosomal enzymes and activation of the oxidative burst. iii) Secretion of cytokines iv) Modulation of leukocyte adhesion molecules, allowing a firm adhesion of activated neutrophils to endothelium. 5. Phagocytosis o Phagocytosis and release of enzymes by neutrophils and macrophages are responsible for eliminating the injurious agents. o In phagocytosis, engulfment and killing & degradation of injurious agent takes place.",

Both sexes may be affected, and the occurrence may be unilateral or bilateral. In isolated cases, genetic influences appear to have an effect, because identical talon cusps occasionally have been documented in twins. Talon cusps also have been seen in patients with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, Mohr syndrome, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, incontinentia pigmenti achromians, Berardinelli-Seip syndrome, and Sturge-Weber angiomatosis. Although the strength of association between the presence of talon cusps and these syndromes generally is not clear, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is strongly correlated as demonstrated by a study of 45 affected patients in which 92% demonstrated talon cusps.

        "exp": "The most likely diagnosis is an intracranial meningioma. Meningiomas are slow-growing, benign tumors comprising 15% of intracranial tumors; they are most common in the elderly. They originate from either dura mater or arachnoid and are sharply demarcated from brain tissue. Meningiomas often incite an osteoblastic reaction in the overlying cranial bones. Microscopically, the meningioma cells have a tendency to encircle one another, forming whorls and psammoma bodies. Clinically, they present as mass lesions; seizures may occur. The superior parasagittal surface of the frontal lobes is a orite site of origin. This can often produce leg weakness, since the leg motor fibers that pass down through the internal capsule originate in parasagittal coical regions. Treatment of meningiomas is usually surgical. Arachnoid cysts are formed by splitting of the arachnoid membrane; most arachnoid cysts arise near the Syln fissure. They may present with mass effect, but would be unlikely to produce seizures, prominent focal signs, or reactive hyperostosis. Glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressive malignant astrocytoma that would likely have killed the patient long before 5 years had elapsed. Metastatic breast cancer would generally look different microscopically (the whorling cell pattern is characteristic of meningioma). It would be unlikely for metastatic cancer to cause a reaction in the overlying bone, or to be present long enough to cause symptoms for 5 years. Ref: Johnson J., Lalwani A. K. (2012). Chapter 62.

Oedema occurs in conditions with diffuse glomerular disease such as in acute diffuse glomerulonephritis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (nephritic oedema).

Such antibodies may be present: In a recipient who has previously rejected a kidney transplant Multiparous women who develop anti-HLA antibodies against paternal antigens shed from the fetus may have preformed antibodies to grafts taken from their husbands or children Prior blood transfusions In recipients not previously sensitized to transplantation antigens, exposure to the class I and class II HLA antigens of the donor graft may evoke antibodies. The initial target of these antibodies in rejection seems to be the graft vasculature.

Haematopoietic Organs In the human embryo, the yolk sac is the main site of haematopoiesis in the first few weeks of gestation. By about 3rd month, however, the liver and spleen are the main sites of blood cells formation and continue to do so until about 2 weeks after birth. Haematopoiesis commences in the bone marrow by 4th and 5th month and becomes fully active by 7th and 8th month, so that at birth practically all the bones contain active marrow. During normal childhood and adult life, therefore, the marrow is the only source of new blood cells. However, during childhood, there is progressive fatty replacement throughout the long bones, so that by adult life the hematopoietic marrow is confined to the central skeleton (vertebrae, sternum, ribs, skull, sacrum and pelvis) and proximal ends of femur, tibia and humerus. Even in these hematopoietic areas, about 50% of the marrow consists of fat. Non-hematopoietic marrow in the adult is, however, capable of reverting to active hematopoiesis in certain pathologic conditions. The spleen and liver can also resume their fetal hematopoietic role in certain pathologic conditions and is called extramedullary hematopoiesis.",

CD4 is a primary receptor used by HIV-1 to gain entry into host T cells. HIV-1 attaches to CD4 with a protein in its viral envelope known as gp120. The binding to CD4 creates a shift in the conformation of gp120 allowing HIV-1 to bind to two other surface receptors on the host cell, the chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, depending on whether HIV is infecting a macrophage or T-helper cell. Following a structural change in another viral protein (gp41), HIV inses a fusion peptide into the host cell that allows the outer membrane of the virus to fuse with the cell membrane. HIV infection leads to a progressive reduction in the number of T cells possessing CD4 receptors. Therefore, medical professionals refer to the CD4 count to decide when to begin treatment for HIV-infected patients.",

This response may occur before any improvment in anemia is observed. The earliest hematological evidence of recovery is increase reticulocytes and their hemoglobin content. The reticulocytes attain a maximal value on the 5th to 10th day after institution of therapy and thereafter gradually return to normal. The reticulocyte response may not be detectable in mild iron deficiency anemia. The blood hemoglobin level is the most accurate measure of the degree of anemia in iron deficiency anemia. During the response to therapy, the red cell count may increase temporarily to values above normal, but the hemoglobin value lags behind. The red cell indices may remain abnormal for some time after the normal hemoglobin level is restored. As recovery occurs, a normocytic cell population gradually replaces the microcytic population; and one of the early signs of response to therapy is an increase in RBW from pretreatment level. When treatment is fully effective, hemoglobin reaches normal levels by 2 months after therapy is initiated, regardless of staing values. Of the epithelial lesions in iron deficiency, those affecting the tongue and nails are the most responsive to treatment.",

        "exp": "Pathogenesis of Emphysema The most accepted theory in the pathogenesis of emphysema is protease - antiprotease mechanism which is responsible in the pathogenesis of two common forms of emphysema, i. e. centriacinar and panacinar. The alveolar wall destruction results from an imbalance between proteases (mainly elastase) and antiproteases in the lung. Proteases (elastase) cause the destruction of alveolar wall, while antiproteases prevent this damage. \u03b11 - antitrypsin is the major antiprotease (anti elastase) secreted by neutrophils during inflammation A. Pathogenesis of panacinar emphysema Panacinar emphysema is associated with congenital deficiency of \u03b11 - antitrypsin. This results in unchecked overactivity of neutrophil elastase that causes the destruction of alveolar wall. As \u03b11 - antitrypsin is deficient throughout the acinus, the acini are uniformly involved from the respiratory bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli. Neutrophils are the major cells in the pathogenesis of panacinar emphysema B. Pathogenesis of centriacinar emphysema Centriacinar emphysema is associated with smoking. Nicotine acts as a direct chemoattractant for neutrophils and macrophages. So, in centriacinar emphysema, both neutrophils and macrophages play a central role. Smoking enhances the activity of neutrophil and macrophage elastase. Macrophage elastase is not inhibited by a1 - antitrypsin and indeed can proteolytically digest this antiprotease. Beside protease - antiprotease mechanism, oxidant-antioxidant imbalance also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of smoking-related emphysema. Normally, the lung contains a healthy complement of antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, glutathione). Tobacco smoke contains abundant reactive oxygen species (free radicals) which deplete these antioxidant mechanisms. Free radicals cause tissue damage, as well as they, inactivate \u03b11 - antitrypsin, resulting in functional \u03b11 - antitrypsin deficiency even in patients without enzyme deficiency. Why smoking-related emphysema involves centriacinar portion? The impaction of smoke particles occurs predominantly at the bifurcation of respiratory bronchioles, resulting in the influx of neutrophils and macrophages, both of which secrete proteases. An increase in protease activity localized in the centriacinar region, together with the smoke-induced oxidative damage, causes the centriacinar pattern of emphysema that is seen in smokers.",

Phagocvtosis Phagocytosis and release of enzymes by neutrophils and macrophages are responsible for eliminating injurious agents. o Phagocytosis involves the following three steps. 1. Recognition and attachment. Phagocytosis of microbes and dead cells is initiated by recognition of paicles by receptors expressed on leukocyte surface. These receptors are Mannose receptors and scavenger receptors. These receptors bind a variety of microbes. 2. Englulfment. Binding of a paicle to phagocytic leukocyte receptors initiates the process of active phagocytosis of the paicles. During engulment, extension of the cytoplasm, i. e., pseudopods flow around the paicle to be engulfed. Eventually, this results in complete enclosure of the paicle within a phagosome created by the plasma membrane. Membrane of this phagocytic vacuole (Phagosome) fuses with the membrane of lysosome to form phagolysosome resulting in discharge of lysosomal granule's content into phagosome. During this process neutrophils and macrophages become progressively degranulated. Phagocytosis is dependent on polymerization of actin (similar to chemotoxis that is also dependent on polymerisation of actin). 3. Killing and degradation. Killing. Microbial killing is accomplished largely by oxygen-depending mechanism, i. e., due to generation of reactive oxygen species. The generation of reactive oxygen species is due to rapid activation on an oxidase - NADPH oxidase. Reactive oxygen species cause membrane damage, cytoskeletal damage and DNA damage. Bacterial killing can also occur by oxygen-independent mechanisms, through action of substances in leukocyte granules -3 Bacterial permeability increasign protein (BPI), lysozyme, lactoferrin, major basic protein and defensin. Degradation. After killing, acid hydrolases, which are normally stored in lysosomes, degrade the microbes within phagolysosome.",

Patients typically have unilateral lymph node enlargement, most often in the posterior cervical chain, which may be accompanied by fevers, chills, myalgias, malaise, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hepatosplenomegaly, or generalized lymphadenopathy. Abnormal laboratory values may include leukopenia and atypical lymphocytes. EBV has been implicated as one causative agent. Diagnosis is by biopsy of the affected lymph node, which typically shows histiocytic aggregates, atypical lymphoid cells, karyorrhectic debris, and patchy necrosis as well as absence of neutrophils or a granulomatous reaction. The disease typically resolves spontaneously after 1-6 months without treatment. Ref: Belazarian L. T., Lorenzo M. E., Pearson A. L., Sweeney S. M., Wiss K. (2012). Chapter 192.

The intestinal wall is rubbery and thick, as a consequence of edema, inflammation, fibrosis, and hypertrophy of the muscularis propria -> lumen is almost always narrowed string sign on barium meal. A classic feature of CD is the sharp demarcation of diseased bowel segments from adjacent uninvolved bowel. When multiple bowel segments are involved, the intervening bowel is normal -> skip lesions. There are serpentine linear ulcer along the axis of bowel. As the intervening mucosa tends to be relatively spared, the mucosa acquires a coarsely textured -> Cobblestone appearance. Narrow fissures develop between the folds of the mucosa. Fissures can penetrate deeply through the bowel wall and leading to bowel adhesions and serositis. Further extension of fissures leads to fistula or sinus tract formation. There is transmural inflammation affecting all layers of bowel wall. Sarcoid like noncaseating granulomas may be present in all tissue layers. Neutrophilic infiltration into the crypts results in formation of crypt abscess. Fibrosis of the submucosa, muscularis propria, and mucosa enentually leads to stricture fromation. There is an increased incidece of cancer of GIT in patints with long- standing CD, but the risk of cancer in CD is considerably less then in patients with chronic UC. Screening test is presence of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisae antibody (ASCA). Antibody formation is common against cell wall of yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisae in patients of CD.

Although the most common site of deep vein thrombosis is calf veins, calf veins thrombosis is itself associated with a low risk of embolism, but when the thrombosis progresses proximally to involve the larger veins above the leg then the risk becomes very high. So, Most common site of DVT -> Calf veins Most common source of pulmonary embolism -> DVT of proximal veins of lower limb i. e., popliteal, femoral or iliac veins. Pathophysiology of pulmonary embolism If the size of embolus is large, it may be impacted at the bifurcation of main pulmonary artery -> Saddle embolus, or may be passed out into the smaller, branching arterioles. More commonly, there are multiple emboli, or a large embolus may be fragmented into many smaller emboli which are then impacted in a number of vessels, particularly affecting the lower lobes of lungs. Rarely, Paradoxical embolism may occur by passage of an embolus from the right side of the heart into the left heart through ASD or VSD.

        "question": "Which of the following inflammatory mediator doesn't cause fever: March 2011",
        "exp": "Ans. A: Nitric oxide. Nitric oxide derived from endothelium and macrophages leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation and killing of microbes Fever is caused by IL-1, TNF and prostaglandins. PyrogensA pyrogen is a substance that induces fever. These can be either internal (endogenous) or external (exogenous) to the body. The bacterial substance lipopolysaccharide (LPS), present in the cell wall of some bacteria, is an example of an exogenous pyrogen. Depyrogenation may be achieved through filtration, distillation, chromatography, or inactivation. Endogenous pyrogens. In essence, all endogenous pyrogens are cytokines, molecules that are a pa of the innate immune system. They are produced by phagocytic cells and cause the increase in the thermoregulatory set-point in the hypothalamus. Major endogenous pyrogens are interleukin 1 (alpha and beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), prostaglandins and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Minor endogenous pyrogens include interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, tumor necrosis factor-beta, macrophage inflammatory protein-alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein-beta as well as interferon-alpha, interferon-beta, and interferon-gamma. These cytokine factors are released into general circulation, where they migrate to the circumventricular organs of the brain due to easier absorption caused by the blood-brain barrier's reduced filtration action there. The cytokine factors then bind with endothelial receptors on vessel walls, or interact with local microglial cells. When these cytokine factors bind, the arachidonic acid pathway is then activated. Exogenous pyrogens. Other mechanism of fever caused by exogenous pyrogens includes LPS, which is a cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria. An immunological protein called lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) binds to LPS. The LBP-LPS complex then binds to the CD14 receptor of a nearby macrophage. This binding results in the synthesis and release of various endogenous cytokine factors, such as interleukin 1(IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha. In other words, exogenous factors cause release of endogenous factors, which, in turn, activate the arachidonic acid pathway. Pattern of fever: Continuous fever: Temperature remains above normal throughout the day and does not fluctuate more than 1 degC in 24 hours, e. g. lobar pneumonia, typhoid, urinary tract infection, brucellosis, or typhus. Typhoid fever may show a specific fever pattern, with a slow stepwise increase and a high plateau. Intermittent fever: The temperature elevation is present only for a ceain period, later cycling back to normal, e. g. malaria, kala-azar, pyaemia, or septicemia. Following are its types:- Quotidian fever, with a periodicity of 24 hours, typical of Malaria- Teian fever (48 hour periodicity), typical of Malaria- Quaan fever (72 hour periodicity), typical of Plasmodium malariae. Remittent fever: Temperature remains above normal throughout the day and fluctuates more than 1 degC in 24 hours, e. g., infective endocarditis. Pel-Ebstein fever: A specific kind of fever associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma, being high for one week and low for the next week and so on. A neutropenic fever, also called febrile neutropenia, is a fever in the absence of normal immune system function. Because of the lack of infection-fighting neutrophils, a bacterial infection can spread rapidly; this fever is, therefore, usually considered to require urgent medical attention. This kind of fever is more commonly seen in people receiving immune-suppressing chemotherapy than in apparently healthy people. Febricula is an old term for a low-grade fever, especially if the cause is unknown, no other symptoms are present, and the patient recovers fully in less than a week. Nitric oxide. It is also known as the 'endothelium-derived relaxing factor', or 'EDRF'It is biosynthesized endogenously from L-arginine, oxygen and NADPH by various nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes. The endothelium (inner lining) of blood vessels uses nitric oxide to signal the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, thus resulting in vasodilation and increasing blood flow. Nitric oxide is highly reactive (having a lifetime of a few seconds), yet diffuses freely across membranes. These attributes make nitric oxide ideal for a transient paracrine (between adjacent cells) and autocrine (within a single cell) signaling molecule. The production of nitric oxide is elevated in populations living at high altitudes, which helps these people avoid hypoxia by aiding in pulmonary vasculature vasodilation. Effects include vasodilatation, neurotransmission, modulation of the hair cycle, production of reactive nitrogen intermediates and penile erections (through its ability to vasodilate). Nitroglycerin and amyl nitrite serve as vasodilators because they are conveed to nitric oxide in the body. The vasodialating antihypeensive drug minoxidil contains an NO moity and may act as an NO agonist. Similarly, Sildenafil citrate, popularly known by the trade name Viagra, stimulates erections primarily by enhancing signaling through the nitric oxide pathway in the penis. Nitric oxide is also generated by phagocytes (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) as pa of the human immune response. Nitric oxide can contribute to reperfusion injury when an excessive amount produced during reperfusion (following a period of ischemia) reacts with superoxide to produce the damaging oxidant peroxynitrite.",

The pathologic mechanism may be damage caused by severe aeriosclerosis. None of the other choices would produce diffuse subcoical white matter involvement. Anemic infarcts can be seen in hypeensive patients as a consequence of atherosclerotic thromboembolic events. Hemorrhagic infarcts can also be seen in hypeensive patients as a consequence of atherosclerotic thromboembolic events followed by reperfusion. They tend to occur in gray matter or at the gray-white junction.

Zero-to Two hyaline casts per low power field is considered normal. Increased numbers of Hyaline casts can occur with exercise, heat exposure, dehydration, fever, congestive heart failure and diuretic. Renal tubular epithelial cell casts - These casts results when the epithelial cells of the renal tubules are being excreted along with the casts. Renal tubular epithelial casts are most suggestive of tubular injury as in acute tubular necrosis. They are also found in other disorders including eclampsia, heavy metal poisoning, ethylene glycol intoxication (most of these cases lead to acute tubular necrosis). Granular casts - These casts are fairly common and occur in both pathological and non-pathological condition. Granular casts can result either from the breakdown of cellular casts to a point where the cells that once were within them are no longer distinguishable or they can result from the inclusion of aggregates of plasma proteins, fibrinogen or immune complexes within the cast upon formation. They can be further divided into coarse granular casts and fine granular casts. Fine granular casts can appear in non-pathological conditions such as vigorous exercise, but the presence of coarse granular cast is abnormal and presents in wide variety of clinical diseases. They are common in renal parenchymal disease. Broadcasts - These casts originate from dilated chronically damaged tubules or the collecting ducts, therefore, they are called renal failure casts. These are formed in collecting duct as a result of urinary stasis. Broadcasts are two to six times the size of other types of casts. Broadcasts or renal failure casts are usually seen in patients with advanced renal failure. Waxy casts - Waxy casts are cylinders of smooth highly refractive material. Waxy casts are seen in final stages of degeneration of fine granular casts. Since the granules need time to degrade, this implies nephron obstruction. Waxy casts are seen in chronic renal diseases associated with renal failure seen in diabetic nephropathy, malignant hypertension, glomerulonephritis.",

        "question": "A classic example of missense mutation -",
        "exp": "In sickle cell anemia there is missense type of point mutation. Mutations A mutation is a permanent change in the DNA. Mutations that affect germ cells (sperm or ovum) are transmitted to progeny and may give rise to Inherited disease. Mutations that affect somatic cells are not transmitted to progeny but are important in the genesis of cancers and congenital malformations. Mutations may be classified into three categories - 1. Gene mutations The vast majority of mutations associated with the hereditary disease are gene mutations. These may of different types depending on whether it involves complete gene or single base - (a) Point mutation A single nucleotide base is substituted by a different base. When a pyrimidine base is substituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine -> Transition. When a purine is substituted by a pyrimidine or vice-versa -> Transversion. This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i. e. in codon and leads to the replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product. Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation. An example is a sickle mutation in which CTC codon in beta-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid are changed to CAC codon that codes for valine. Another type of point mutation is a nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon. Example is beta-thalassemia in which CAG codon in p-chain of hemoglobin that code for Glutamine is changed to stop codon UAG Acer point mutation. b. Deletion and insertions Deletion or insertion of one or two bases lead to alteracations in the reading frame of the DNA Strand -> frameshift mutation. If the number of base pairs involved is three or a multiple of three frameshift does not occur (Because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized. c. Trinucleotide repeat mutation Normally a codon is triplet i. e., trinucleotide. In this type of mutation a codon, i. e., trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the Same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain, For example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. There are 250- 4000 tandem repeats of CGG 2. Chromosome mutation The result from the rearrangement of genetic material that gives rise to visible structural changes in the Chromosome. 3.

It was discovered in patients with colon cancer and pancreatic cancer in 1981. Increased levels of CA19-9 are also found in non-malignant conditions, such as Mirizzi's syndrome and diseases ofthe bile ducts and liver. Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology discourage the use of CA19-9 as a test for cancer, paicularly pancreatic cancer. The reason is that the test may be falsely normal (false negative) in many cases, or abnormally elevated in people who have no cancer at all (false positive). The main use of CA19-9 is therefore to see whether a pancreatic tumor is secreting it; if that is the case, then the levels should fall when the tumor is treated, and they may rise again if the disease recurs. In patients who lack the Lewis antigen (a blood type protein on red blood cells), which is about 5% of the population, CA19-9 is not elevated in pancreatic cancer even with large tumors because they have a deficiency of a fucosyltransferase enzyme that is needed to produce CA19-9 as well as the Lewis antigen",

Marked congestion of the capillaries is typical. Sholy after this congestion occurs there is a massive outpouring of polymorphonuclear leukocytes accompanied by intra-alveolar hemorrhage. Many of the red blood cells undergo lysis. These cells, together with polymprphonuclearleukocytes, produce the rusty sputum. Because the firm consistency of the affected lung is reminiscent of the liver, this stage has been named \"red hepatization\". The next phase, occurring after 2 or more days, depending on the success of treatment, involves the lysis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the appearance of macrophages, which phagocytose the fragmented polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other inflammatory debris.

        "exp": "The \ufb01ndings in the given question are: Anemia (Hb = 6 gm%), Reduced leukocyte count (TLC=1200), Reduced platelet count (60000), Reduced MCV (12 fL). Normal value of MCV is 80-100 fL. It is the measure of size of RBC. Reduced MCV means microcytic and increased MCV means macrocytic RBCs. Normal TLC is 4000-11000, normal platelet count is 1, 50, 000 to 4, 50, 000 and normal Hb is above 12 g/dL. Now, considering the options one by one: Aplastic anemia has reduced RBC, WBC as well as platelet counts. Anemia is normocytic normochromic, thus it can be easily ruled out. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) typically presents with anemia which is usually normocytic normochromic. If MCV is high, it is due to reticulocytosis. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may or may not be present. Therefore, this option also cannot be the answer. Megaloblastic anemia presents with raised MCV. There may be leukopenia as well as thrombocytopenia. Severity of these changes parallels the degree of anemia. Myelo\ufb01brosis usually presents with anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Mostly anemia is normocytic but in 30% cases, microcytic anemia can be present. Based on the above discussion, the most probable answer is \u2018Myelo\ufb01brosis'. However, the value of MCV given is 12 fL which is practically not possible. Normal value of MCV is 80- 100 fL. MCV < 50 fL is considered to be extremely low. Therefore, one possibility is that it may be 112 fL and due to typographical error in the question, written as 12 fL. If this is the case, then the answer will become megaloblastic anemia.",

There is an area of necrosis in the center of some nodules. Numerous acid-fast bacilli are demonstrated by Ziehl-Neelsen staining within the cytoplasm of epithelioid cells. Silver stains for fungi are negative. Which of the following is the MOST likely condition that predisposed the patient to this pulmonary disease?",
        "exp": "The lesion shown is a necrotizing granuloma developing as a result of infection by acid-fast bacilli (most likely mycobacteria). Granulomatous inflammation is a specialized form of chronic inflammation, which begins with the uptake of foreign antigens by macrophages. These cells process and present the antigen to helper T lymphocytes, which in turn activate macrophages by interferon-g secretion. Granulomas may be due to infectious and noninfectious causes. Usually, infectious granulomas are necrotizing and non-infectious granulomas are non-necrotizing, but there are many exceptions to this rule. Among the infectious causes, mycobacterial infections are of the utmost impoance, especially in patients with AIDS. Fungi may also cause granulomas, which may be of the necrotizing or non-necrotizing type. By definition, however, caseating necrosis is pathognomonic of mycobacterial infection. Also know: Common variable immunodeficiency is one of the most common forms of congenital immune deficiency syndrome. It is due to inability of lymphocytes to mature into plasma cells. Consequently, levels of immunoglobulins are depressed, and patients suffer from depressed humoral immunity. Cell-mediated immunity (on which granuloma formation is largely dependent) is intact. Cystic fibrosis predisposes to recurrent bronchopneumonia and development of bronchiectasis. Depressed level of consciousness predisposes to aspiration of gastric contents and development of aspiration pneumonia. Sheets of macrophages are often observed, but not necrotizing granulomas (unless there are additional predisposing conditions, such as AIDS). Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C. R. (1998). Chapter 7.

The duration of the treatment depending on the clinical indication is 1 week or longer. Tranexamic acid is given at doses of 25 mg/kg three to four times a day. EACA treatment requires a loading dose of 200 mg/kg (maximum of 10 g) followed by 100 mg/Kg per dose (maximum 30 g/d) every 6h. General considerations regarding the treatment of bleeds in hemophilia include the following: (1) Treatment should begin as soon as possible because symptoms often precede objective evidence of bleeding; because of the superior efficacy of early therapeutic intervention, classic symptoms of bleeding into the joint in a reliable patient, headaches, or automobile or other accidents require prompt replacement and further laboratory investigation, (2) Drugs that hamper platelet function, such as aspirin or aspirin containing drugs, should be avoided; to control pain, drugs such as ibuprofen or propoxyphene are preferred. FVIII and FIX are dosed in units. One unit is defined as the amount of FVIII (100 ng/mL) or FIX (5 \u03bcg/mL) in 1 mL of normal plasma. One unit of FVIII per kilogram of body weight increases the plasma level by 2%. One can calculate the dose needed to increase FVIII levels to 100% in a 70-kg severe hemophilia patient (<1%) using the simple formula below. Thus, 3500 units of FVIII will raise the circulating level to 100%. FVIII dose (IU) = Target FVIII levels - FVIII baseline levels x Body weight (kg) x 0. 5 unit/kg. The doses for FIX replacement are different from those for FVIII, because FIX recover after infusion is usually only 50% of the predicted value. Therefore, the formula for FIX replacement is as follows: FIX dose (IU) = Target FIX levels - FIX baseline levels x Body weight (Kg) x 1 unit/Kg. The FVIII half-life of 8-12 h requires injections twice a day to maintain therapeutic levels, whereas the FIX half-life is longer, 24 h, so that once-a-day injection is sufficient. In specific situations such as after surgery, continuous infusion of factor may be desirable because of its safety in achieving sustained factor levels at a lower total cost. Cryoprecipitate is enriched with FVIII protein (each bag contains 80 IU of FVIII) and was commonly used for the treatment of hemophilia A decades ago; it is still in use in some developing countries, but because of the risk of bloodborne diseases, this product should be avoided in hemophilia patients when factor concentrates are available.

To be maximally effective, the programme must be instituted at the beginning of radiotherapy and continued every day. Such a regimen can also arrest caries caused by xerostomia in previously unprotected patients. Because of the ever present risk of caries in xerostomic patients, only diligent, lifelong cooperation will assure prevention.

This pattern, which resembles a jigsaw puzzle in appearance, reflects the tight apposition of irregular units of bone that adhere to one another with prominent cement lines. These findings are characteristic of fully developed Paget disease, and are the ones most likely to be illustrated on an examination. However, you should be aware that early Paget disease typically shows lytic rather than proliferative bone lesions, and it is thought that the primary defect involves the osteoclasts, which are typically abnormally large with more than the usual number of nuclei. This is followed by overly vigorous osteoblastic activity, which eventually produces the characteristic mosaic bone. Benign spindle cells growing in a storiform pattern are characteristic of fibrous coical defect and nonossifying fibroma. A cailage nodule within a bony medullary cavity is characteristic of enchondroma. Spirochetes visible with silver stain are a feature of skeletal syphilis. Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C. R. (1998).

The ratio of low to high molecular weight proteins in urine in various cases of syndrome is a manifestation of the selectivity of proteinuria.

Increased resting tone of LES Pathogenesis It is due to dysfunction of inhibitory neurons containing nitric oxide and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the distal intestine. The cholinergic innervation of the LES is intact or affected only in the advanced stage. There is neurogenic degeneration either idiopathic or due to infection. The degenerative changes are either intrinsic (degeneration of ganglion cells of Aurebach's myentric plexus) or extrinsic (extra esophageal vagus nerve or the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus). As a result of the abnormality, LES fails to relax and there is progressive dilatation of esophagus above the level of \u200bLES. Clinical findings Both sexes are equally affected (Ref: Maingot's 10th/e p. 846) May develop at any age but peak years are from 30 to 60. Classical clinical symptom is progressive dysphagia for both solids and liquids. Dysphagia is worsened by emotional stress and hurried eating. Regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration occur because of retention of large volumes of saliva and ingested food in the esophagus. Esophagitis with ulceration may occur with chronic retention of food. Pain is infrequent in classical achlasia but a variant called vigrous achlasia is characterized by chest pain and esophageal spasms that generate non-propulsive high-pressure waves in the body of the esophagus. Secondry achalasia may arise in chagas disease, in which trypanosoma cruzi causes destruction of myentric plexus of the esophagus, duodenum, colon, and ureter, with resultant dilatation of these viscera.",

        "exp": "Ans. D: Cardiomegaly Primary ciliary dyskinesia/PCD/immotile ciliary syndrome/ Kaagener Syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder which causes a defect in the action of the cilia lining the respiratory tract (lower and upper, sinuses, Eustachian tube, middle ear) and fallopian tube. PCD is a genetically heterogenous disorder affecting motile cilia. Around 90% of individuals have ultrastructural defects affecting protein(s) in the outer and/or inner dynein arms which give cilia their motility When accompanied by the combination of situs inversus (reversal of the internal organs), chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis, it is known as Kaagener syndrome. The main consequence of impaired ciliary function is reduced or absent mucus clearance from the lungs, and susceptibility to chronic recurrent respiratory infections, including sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, and otitis media. Infeility is common, due to defective ciliary action in the follopian tube in affected females or diminished sperm motility in affected males.",
