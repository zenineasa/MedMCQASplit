A chest X-ray reveals an area of consolidation in the periphery of the left upper lobe, as well as hilar lymphadenopathy. Sputum cultures show acid-fast bacilli. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

The Ghon complex includes parenchymal consolidation and enlargement of ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and is often accompanied by a pleural effusion None of the other choices feature acid-fast organisms",

        "exp": "Most Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections are asymptomatic and subclinical infections. In most healthy people primary tuberculosis is asymptomatic, although it may cause fever and pleural effusion. Generally, the only evidence of infection, if any remains, is a tiny, fibrocalcific pulmonary nodule at the site of the infection. Viable organisms may remain dormant in such lesions for decades. If immune defenses are lowered, the infection may be reactivated, producing communicable and potentially life-threatening disease. Testing for latent tuberculosis is done by detecting T-cells specific for or delayed hypersensitivity to M. tuberculosis antigens. This can be detected by either IFN-g release assays (IGRAs) or the tuberculin (purified protein derivative, or Mantoux) skin test.",
