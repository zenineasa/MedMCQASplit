        "question": "A 66-year-old woman dies of severe congestive heart failure. Her past medical history is remarkable for rheumatoid ahritis that first manifested at the age of 35. The autopsy revealed splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and glomerulopathy. The spleen, liver, and kidneys showed a similar waxy texture. Which of the following mechanisms explains these clinical and pathologic findings?",
        "exp": "Chronic inflammatory conditions, such as collagen vascular diseases, rheumatoid ahritis, and bronchiectasis, may lead in time to accumulation of a specific form of amyloid, known as AA (amyloid-associated protein). Systemic amyloidosis affects many organs, especially the heart, kidneys, spleen, GI tract, liver, and tongue. The ventricular walls become thickened and inelastic, and the resulting pathophysiologic picture is that of restrictive cardiomyopathy. Congestive heart failure ensues because of decreased ventricular compliance and secondary reduced stroke volume. Note how the ventricular lumen are narrowed and the walls are extremely thickened. A waxy texture is highly suggestive of amyloid deposition, which can be confirmed histologically by using Congo red staining. Note: Atherosclerosis of coronary aeries may give three different types of clinical manifestations: arrhythmias (with sudden death), angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction. Loss of myocardial tissue due to ischemic necrosis may lead to congestive heart failure. The heart will show evidence of old infarcts in the form of scars, and the ventricular cavities will become dilated. Coxsackievirus myocarditis is the most common etiologic form of viral myocarditis, which may resolve without clinical consequences or lead to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Mutations of myosin chain genes are the most common causes of hyperophic cardiomyopathy. This manifests with thickening of the interventricular septum (so-called asymmetric cardiac hyperophy), with resultant impediment to both systolic outflow and diastolic filling. Here, the ventricular walls are uniformly thickened, and the remaining postmoem findings (liver, kidney, and spleen changes) cannot be explained based on a diagnosis of hyperophic cardiomyopathy.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i. e., Valvular endocardium. Carcinoid Heart Disease. Carcinoid heart disease is the cardiac manifestation of the systemic syndrome caused by carcinoid tumors. It generally involves the endocardium and valve of the right side of heart. Cardiovascular lesions consist of firm plaque like endocardial fibrous thickenings on the inside surfaces of the cardiac chambers and the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Occasionally they involve the major blood vessels of the right side, the inferior vena cava and the pulmonary aery. These plaque like thickenings are composed predominantly of smooth muscle cells and sparase collagen fibres embedded in an acid mucopolysaccharide-rich matrix materials. Elastic fibers are not present in the plaque. The most common cardiac manifestation is tricuspid regurgitation. Stenosis of right sided valve may also develop. Why does right sided heart involvement more common? Carcinoid tumors produce a variety of bioactive products that produce these (above described) heart lesions. Among these, serotonin is most impoant. Serotonin is inactivated during its passage through lung. As you all know, left side of heart recieve blood from pulmonary circulation, left sided hear lesions are uncommon (Because serotonin has already been metabolized in lung). Similarly, gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors do not induce carcinoid heart disease (neither right nor left) as bioactive mediators released into the poal circulation are metabolized in the liver. Therefore carcinoid heart disease is produced by tumors that have extensive hepatic metastasis (liver releases the mediators directly into IVC) or carcinoid tumors of organs that are outside poal circulation (e. g., ovary).",

There are also desmosomal cadherins and proto-cadherins. Cadherins are intimately involved in embryonic development and tissue organization. They exhibit homophilic adhesion. The extracellular domain consists of several cadherin repeats, each is capable of binding a calcium ion. When calcium is bound, the extracellular domain has a rigid, rod-like structure.

        "question": "Which of the following is associated with aging -",
        "exp": "Increased free radical injury The cells of lower organism i. e. bacterial cells are immoal at least in principle. If a bacterial cell is placed in. ourable condition it will grow and divide indefinitely. What about cells of higher organisms like birds or mammals?? - Until mid twentieth century it was thougth that cells from higher species were also immoal i. e., capable to grow indefinitely under proper conditions. Hayflick theory of aeging suggests that human cells is limited in the number of times it can divide. -Hayflick theorized that human cells ability to divide is approximately 50 times, after which, they simply stop dividing. - It was believed that the hayflick limit is a genetic program that prevents cell division after a ceain no. of cell cycles. Why would our cells need to have such program?? - The current view is that a built in limit on the number of possible cell divisions reduce the risk of uncontrolled growth resulting in cancer. Indeed, studies indicate that in cancer cells this genetic clock is broken allowing them to grow indefinitely. Could it be that ageing is the result of cells inability to divide once they have reached the Hayflick limit??. - There is no straight answer to that at present. It appears that in some tissues such as the skin and the lining of blood vessels the hayflick limit may be an impoant pa of the aeging process. - On the other hand, cells in the brain, retina, nerves and muscles normally do not divide and never even approach the Hayflick limit. Molecular mechanism responsible for Hayflick limit (Telomerase theorey of Aging) In the cells of higher organisms chromosomes are capped with special DNA structures called Telomers. The main role of Telomers is to protect the ends of chromosomes from degradation. - During cell division the chromosomes are duplicated through the process of DNA replication. - However due to the nature of this process, the very ends of Telomers cannot be copied. - Imagine a road machine that moves along the road and makes a new layer of asphalt behind it. The machines design is such that it can move only when it is on the road. When it has reached the end of the road there is an new layer of asphalt over the entire road except for the spot under the machine. To be able to cover the remaining spot, the machine must move past it but it cannot because it is already at the end of the road. - Similar scenario occurs during the replication of chromosome. - Thus the very end of the each telomere never gets copied. - Which leads to progressive shoening of Telomers after each cell division. It appears that after its Telomers have shoened beyond a ceain point the cell loses the ability to divide (This does not occurs in bacteria because their chromosomes are circular and do not have telomers) Free radicals theory of ageing It is now widely believed that degeneration occurs primarily in response to oxidative stress. During oxidative stress, a highly reactive oxygen molecules (ROS) are released. These molecules characteristically have unpaired electron in their outer orbit. - Small quantities of ROS are formed spontaneously under normal conditions, as the byproduct, of redox processes such as oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria and y3 oxidation of fatty acids. - However, generation of free radicals is significantly enhanced in condition of oxidative stress, irradiation, chemical exposure. Free radicals are extremely reactive speciese since by reacting with other molecules they try to stabilize their configuration and obtain the lacking electrons. - The inacromolecules that are extremely susceptible to ROS mediated damage are nucleic acids, phospholipids and proteins. - Oxidation of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA may result in mutation and aberrant protein synthesis. - Oxidative damage to cell membrane phospholipids may impair transmembrctne transpo mechanisms and signal transduction. Under normal conditions, ultrastructural alterations caused by ROS are recognized and eliminated by cellular repair mechanisms:- - It is however, impoant to emphasize that the cumulative damage exeed by ROS with time, exceeds repairing potential of the cellular machinery which ultimately leads to decline in physiological capacity of the whole organism. Molecular evidence of increased oxidative stress is -> \"accumulation of lipofuscin\". Under normal conditions a network of cellular defence system including \"catalase\", \"peroxidase, \"superoxide dismutase\" effectively scavenges small amounts of ROS generated. - However, the capacity of antioxidant system is limited and the rate at which antitoxidant agent are resynthesized declines with age. Cross linkage theory of Aging An impoant theory implicated in age related cell degeneration is accumulation of advanced glycosylation end (AGE) products. - Advanced glycosylation end products are. formed by non enzymatic reaction between sugar and protein. - It has been demonstrated that physiological control of blood glucose becomes less tight with age which leads to impaired glucose tolerance and prolonged periods of elevated glucose that our AGE formation. Generation of AGE induces pathology a number of mechanisms. - Glycosylation of several proteins have been documented such as hemoglobin, fibrinogen lipoprotein ferritin. Of paicular impoance is glycosylation of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen. - Cross linking of collagen type I molecule in large vessels decrease their elasticity which may predispose these vessels to shear stress and endothelial injury. Proteins cross linked are resistant to proteolvtic digeston. \"Thus crosslinking decreases protein removal while enhancing deposition\". Consequences of AGE induced abnormalities includes. - Narrowing of blood vessels. - Capturing of other plasma proteins such as LDL - Thickening of basement membrane - Decreased elasticity of blood vessels, skins, ligament... In addition AGE bind to specific receptors on immune cells which trigger the release of inflammatory mediators and generation of ROS which fuher increase AGE induced damage. Membrane theory of aeging As the body grow older the cell membrane becomes less lipid. This impedes its efficiency to conduct normal function and in paicular there is a toxic accumulation. - This cellular toxin is referred to as \"lipofuscin\" and as we grow older, lipofuscin deposits become more evident in the brain, heart and lungs and also in the skin. Somatic mutation theory of aging Somatic mutations tend to accumulate steadily during life and somatic cells become increasingly susceptible to the cumulative effect of DNA damage which leads to aging. Accumulation of senescent cells Renewing tissues become dysfunctional through loss of ability to renew",

Tuberculosis Antigenic property: Group specificity is due to polysaccharide while type specificity is due to a protein antigen. Antibodies are not useful for diagnosis and immunity. Pathogenicity: Macrophages are the primary cells infected by M. tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis replicated within the macrophages (phagosome) by blocking fusion of phagosome and Lysosome. It is due to the escape of killing by macrophages and induction of type IV hypersensitivity. Factors contributing to pathogenesis: Cord factor, Lipoarabinomannan, Complement system, M. tuberculosis heat shock proteins.

        "exp": "Prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas that arise from the prostatic acinar cells. In eighty-five percent of the cases, the adenocarcinoma is multifocal. Prostate cancers are graded according to their dysplasia, utilizing the Gleason scoring system. Sarcoma of the prostate accounts for 0. 1% of all malignant prostatic tumors. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most frequent mesenchymal tumor within the prostate, and is seen almost exclusively in childhood. Seminomas are not seen within the prostate. Seminoma is a germ cell tumor of the testis. Primary squamous carcinoma of the prostate is rare and is associated with a poor survival. More commonly, squamous differentiation occurs in the primary and metastatic deposits of adenocarcinomas after estrogen therapy. Also Know: Over 75% of cancers occur in the outer pa of the gland--mainly in the posterior pa. The most widely used and the one that correlates best with survival is Gleason's system, which uses two numbers representing the two predominant patterns in the tumor. The best- and worst-differentiated patterns, according to this system, are 1, 1 (pure grade 1 lesions) and 5, 5 (pure grade 5 lesions), respectively; a grade 2, 4 carcinoma would show a mixture of moderately and poorly differentiated areas.

Low white cell counts maybe due to a recent infection such as a cold/flu. It can also be associated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, myelofibrosis and aplastic anemia. HIV and AIDS are also a threat to white cells. Other causes of low white blood cell count include: Influenza, systemic lupus erythematosus, Hodgkin's lymphoma, some types of cancer, typhoid, malaria, tuberculosis, dengue, Rickettsial infections, enlargement of the spleen, folate deficiencies, psittacosis and sepsis. Many other causes exist, such as a deficiency in ceain minerals such as copper and zinc. Medications which can cause leukopenia include- Clozapine- Immunosuppressive drugs, such as sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and cyclosporine. Interferons used to treat multiple sclerosis, can also cause leukopenia.- The antidepressant and smoking addiction treatment drug (Bupropion HCL) can also cause leukopenia with long-term use.- Minocycline, is also known to cause leukopenia.- Divalproex sodium or valproic acid. Decreased white blood cell count may be present in cases of arsenic toxicity- Lamotrigine, has been associated with a decrease in white blood cell count. Pseudoleukopenia. It can develop upon the onset of infection. The leukocytes (predominately neutrophils, responding to injury first) are marginalized in the blood vessels so that they can scan for the site of infection. This means that even though there is increased WBC production, it will appear as though it is low from a blood sample, since the blood sample is of core blood and does not include the marginalized leukocytes.",

Pathological changes of bacterial pneumonia A. Lobar pneumonia Large confluent area of the lung or entire lobes are consolidated. The lower lobes are affected most commonly. There are four stages of the inflammatory response (Laennec's stages)? 1. Stage of congestion (initial phase) The affected lobe is enlarged, heavy, dark red and congested. Cut surface exudes blood-stained frothy fluid. There is dilatation and congestion of alveolar capillaries. There are few neutrophils and numerous bacteria in the alveolar fluid. 2. Stage of red hepatization (early consolidation) The term hepatization refers to liver-like consistency of the affected lobe on cut section. The affected lobe is red and firm. The edema fluid of preceding stage is replaced by strands of fibrin. There is marked cellular exudate of neutrophils with extravasation of red cells. 3. Stage of gray hepatizatioa (late consolidation) The affected lobe is grayish brown, firm and dry. The fibrin strand are dense and more numerous. There is progressive disintigration of red cells and neutrophils. The macrophages begin to appear in the exudate. The organisms are less numerous and appear as degenerated forms. 4. Resolution The previously solid and fibrinous constituent is liquefied by enzymatic action. Granular and fragmented strands of fibrin in the alveolar spaces are seen due to progressive enzymatic digestion. There is progressive removal of fluid content as well as cellular exudate from the air spaces, resulting in restoration of normal lung parenchyma with areation. B. Bronchopneumonia Patchy areas of red or grey consolidation, more often multilobar and frequently bilateral and basal (lower zones) because of tendency of secretions to gravitate into lower lobes.. There is suppurative exudate, consisting chiefly neutrophils, filling bronchi, bronchioles and adjacent alveolar spaces.

        "exp": "Only about 10% of emboli actually cause infarction- Regarding morphologic consequences of embolic occlusion of pulmonary arteries - Robbins 7th/742 Why only 10% of emboli cause infarction? Because the lungs have a dual blood supply. In patients with adequate cardiovascular function, the bronchial arterial supply can often sustain the lung parenchyma despite obstruction to the pulmonary arterial system. Pulmonary embolism usually causes infarction only when the circulation is already inadequate as in patients with heart or lung disease. For this reason, pulmonary infarcts tend to be uncommon in the young. Consequences of pulmonary embolism The effects of pulmonary embolism depend mainly on the size of the occluded vessel, the number of emboli, and on cardiovascular status of the patients. The following consequences can result. 1. Asymptomatic Most pulmonary emboli (60% to 80%) are clinically silent because they are small. With time, they undergo organization and are incorporated into the vascular wall. 2. Sudden death (cardiovascular collapse) Massive pulmonary embolism may result in instantaneous death, without occurrence of chest pain and dyspnea. 3. Acute cor pulmonale (Acute right heart failure) Numerus small emboli may obstruct most of the pulmonary circulation resulting in acute heart failure. 4. Pulmonary infarction Embolic obstruction of small end-arteriolar pulmonary branches can cause pulmonary infarction. About three-fourths of all infarcts affect the lower lobes, and in more than half, multiple lesions occur. Characteristically, they extend to the periphery of the lung substance as a wedge with the apex pointing toward the kilns of the lung. The pulmonary infarct is classically hemorrhagic infarct. 5. Pulmonary hemorrhage Embolic obstruction of medium-sized arteries may result in pulmonary hemorrhage. 6. Pulmonary hypertension Multiple emboli over time may cause pulmonary hypertension with right heart failure.",

The suppression of humoral immunity. Bone resorption often leads to pathologic fractures and chronic pain. The attendant hypercalcemia can give rise to neurologic manifestations, such as confusion, weakness, and lethargy, and contributes to renal dysfunction. Decreased production of normal immunoglobulins sets the stage for recurrent bacterial infections. Of great significance is renal insufficiency, which trails only infections as a cause of death.",

Brain metastases are three times more common than all primary brain tumors combined. Must know: Brain metastases arise from hematogenous spread and frequently arise from either a lung primary or are associated with pulmonary metastases. Most metastases develop at the gray matter-white matter junction in the watershed distribution of the brain where intravascular tumor cells lodge in terminal aerioles. The distribution of metastases in the brain approximates the propoion of blood flow such that about 85% of all metastases are supratentorial and 15% occur in the posterior fossa. The most common sources of brain metastases are lung and breast carcinomas; melanoma has the greatest propensity to metastasize to the brain, being found in 80% of patients at autopsy. Ovarian and esophageal carcinoma rarely metastasize to the brain. Prostate and breast cancer also have a propensity to metastasize to the dura and can mimic meningioma. Leptomeningeal metastases are common from hematologic malignancies and also breast and lung cancers. Spinal cord compression primarily arises in patients with prostate and breast cancer, tumors with a strong propensity to metastasize to the axial skeleton. Ref: De. Angelis L. M., Wen P. Y. (2012).

Stable angina is usually crescenda - decrescendo in nature. It usually recurs in a fairly predictable manner with consistent level of exeion.

        "exp": "Megaloblastic anemia with poor vitamin B12 absorption suggests pernicious anemia. In this condition, an autoimmune attack on gastric parietal cells leads to atrophic gastritis with deficient synthesis of the intrinsic factor needed for vitamin B12 absorption. Vitamin B12 is required for DNA synthesis in blood cell precursors; deficiency produces megaloblastic anemia. Chronic atrophic gastritis predisposes an individual to the development of gastric carcinoma. Predisposing factors for colon cancer include familial polyposis syndromes, inflammatory bowel disease, isolated adenomatous polyps, and diet. Duodenal and ileal cancers are uncommon.

T-cell mediated cytotoxicity - mediated by CD8- T cells. 1. Delayed type hypersensitivity In delayed hypersensitivity reactions, CD-4 T cells and macrophages are primarily involved. o The term delayed is used to differentiate it from a secondary cellular response, which appears at 48-72 hours after antigen exposure and from an immediate hypersensitivity response, which generally appears within minutes. Delayed hypersinsitivity is a major mechanism of defence against various intracellular pathogens, including mycobacteria, fungi and ceain parasites. Pathophysiology Delayed hypersensitivity is characterized by formation of granuloma - a localized mass that contains activated macrophages (epitheloid) cells surrounded by collor of lymphocytes and giant cells. o It is also called granulomatous inflammation. o The cellular events stas when antigen (eg tuberculin antigen) on antigen presenting cell comes in contact with naive CD-4 T cells ---> naive CD-4 T cells recognize these peptide antigen in association with MHC - II and differentiate in to T4-1 cells. o Induction of T4-I cells is of central impoance because the expression of delayed hypersensitivity largely depends on the cytokines secreted by T4-1 cells. 2.

In parts of Africa, where malaria is endemic, the gene frequency approaches 30% as a result of a protective effect against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Much more serious are vaso-occlusive crises, which are characteristically associated with pain and often lead to tissue damage and significant morbidity and mortality. Among the most common and serious of these vasoocclusive crises are the following: Hand-foot syndrome, resulting from infarction of bones in the hands and feet, is the most common presenting symptom in young children. Acute chest syndrome, in which sluggish blood flow in inflamed lung (e. g., an area of pneumonia) leads to sickling within hypoxemic pulmonary beds. This exacerbates pulmonary dysfunction, creating a vicious circle of worsening pulmonary and systemic hypoxemia, sickling, and vaso-occlusion. Acute chest syndrome may also be triggered by fat emboli emanating from infarcted bone. Patients with sickle cell disease also are predisposed to Salmonella osteomyelitis, possibly in part because of poorly understood acquired defects in complement function.

Type Ilfamilial lipoprein lipase deficiency) o Lipoprotein lipase is required for the hydrolysis of chylomicrons and VLDL tri glycerides. o Deficiency of LPL results in decrease hydrolysis and elevated levels of plasma chylomicrons. o VLDL may also be increased but chylomicrons predominate. o Clinical manifestations Severe abdominal pain due to acute pancreatitis. Lipemia retinalis --> opalescent retinal vessels. Eruptive xanthomas ---> on back, buttocks and extensor surface of legs and arms. Hepatosplenomegaly --> due to uptake of chylomicron by RE cells of liver & spleen. Note - Similar disorder may occur with Apo-C II deficiency, because apo C-II acts as a cofacter for LPL (see previous explanations on lipid transpo). In Apo II deficiency, LPL becomes inactive. 2. Type II A. Tvpe Ha (familial hvpercholesterolemia) o It is due to deficiency of LDL receptors. o There are two sources of increased LDL Decreased clearance of LDL LDL receptors. Increased production LDL from IDL normally 40-60% of IDL is taken up by liver LDL receptors, but in LDL receptor deficiency, clearance of IDL is decreased. So, more IDL is conveed to LDL. o Clinical manifestations Tuberous and tendon xanthoma on hands, wrist, elbows, knees, heels (especially the achilles tendon) or buttocks. Xanthelesma --> Barely elevated deposits of cholesterol over eyelids. Premature atherosclerosis coronary heart diseases. Peripheral vascular disease Corneal arcus B. Type. Ilb (familial combined hvperlipidemia) o It is a disorder genetically distinct from the other inherited hyperlipidemias and characterized by the type II or type IV lipoprotein pattern that may change from time to time. o It is due to L LDL receptors and increased secretion of Apo B-100 (major apoprotein of VLDL) -9 So, both LDL and VLDL are increased. o Clinical manifestations There are no xanthomas (as seen with type 11a). Increased risk of CHD. Peripheral vascular disease. 3. Type DI (Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia) o Also known as familial broad - $ disease. o This is due do abnormality in Apo - E. o Apo - E acts as a ligand for LDL receptors and helps in hepatic uptake of chylomiron remnants and VLDL remnants, i. e. IDL (see previous explanations of lipid transpo). o Due to defective uptake, Chylomicron remnants and VLDL remnants (IDL) are increased. o Clinical manifestations Tubero-eruptive xanthomas. Palmar xanthomas (xanthomata striata palmas). Premature atherosclerosis --* CHD Peripheral vascular disease Type IV (familial hyperiglyceridemia) o There is elevated levels of VLDL due to increased hepatic production of VLDL and impaired catabolism of VLDL. o It may be due to Apo - V deficiency (Apo - V promotes LPL mediated triglyceride lipolysis). o Premature coronary aery disease may occur but the chances are very-very less than in type II & Type III hyperlipidemias. Type V (Endogenous hvperiglyceridemia) o Pathogenesis may be similar to type IV, but it is more severe and both VLDL and chylomicrons are raised because both these are metabolized by same LPL and competes with each other for metabolism. o Clinical manifestations These are same as in type I familial LPL deficiency, i. e. o Pancreatitis o Lipemia retinalis o Eruptive xanthomas o Hepatosplenomegaly",

These macrophages have abundant cytoplasm and central round-to ovoid nuclei in which the chromatin is disposed in a central, slender, wavy ribbon (hence the designation \"caterpillar cells\"), and may become multinucleated. During acute RF, diffuse inflammation and Aschoff bodies may be found in any of the three layers of the heart, causing pericarditis, myocarditis, or endocarditis (pancarditis). Inflammation of the endocardium and the left sided valves typically results in fibrinoid necrosis within the cusps or along the tendinous cords. Overlying these necrotic foci are small (1 - to 2- mm) vegetations, called verrucae, along the lines of closure. Subendocardial lesions, perhaps exacerbated by regurgitant jets, may induce irregular thickenings called Mac. Callum plaques, usually in the left atrium.

Cardiac conduction defects & minor neurologic manifestations have also been seen in some families. Mitochondrial diseases DNA in human may be found at two locations Nuclear DNA in nucleus Organelle DNA in the mitochondria Mitochondrial DNA is the only non-chromosomal DNA in human cells. Mitochondrial DNA is always maternally inherited. Why is it so, let's see:- Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA are located in different places in the cell. During fertilization, the sperm and egg cell nuclei fuse to form an embryo. The egg cell is very large compared to the sperm, so although the cells' nuclei fuse, the rest of the cell mass in the embryo comes from the egg only. Nuclear DNA is therefore co-inherited but the mitochondrial DNA, which is located outside of the nucleus, is always maternally inherited because all mitochondria in a foetus and later adult are derived from the Mitochondria in the mother's egg. All children from affected mother will inherit the disease but it will not be transmitted from an affected father to his children.",

The majority of patients with FAP have mutations in the TTR gene. Amyloid deposition may be evident in abdominal fat pad, rectal, or nerve biopsies. The clinical features, histopathology, and EDx reveal abnormalities consistent with a generalized or multifocal, predominantly axonal but occasionally demyelinating, sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Must know: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the prototype of a group of inherited diseases that are characterized by recurrent episodes of fever with serosal, synol, or cutaneous inflammation and, in some individuals, the eventual development of systemic AA amyloidosis. The innate immune system, with its myeloid effector cells and germline receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns and endogenous danger signals, plays a predominant role in the pathogenesis of the autoinflammatory diseases Beta 2-m Amyloidosis is a frequent complication of long-term dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis). In fact, Beta 2-m amyloidosis is a major cause of skeletal morbidity in dialysis-dependent patients. Prions are infectious proteins that cause degeneration of the central nervous system (CNS). Prion diseases are disorders of protein conformation, the most common of which in humans is called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD typically presents with dementia and myoclonus, is relentlessly progressive, and generally causes death within a year of onset. Misfolded prion protein (Pr. PSc) is associated with amyloidosis.

In many of these conditions, particularly those with substantial concomitant endocardial involvement, partial obliteration of the ventricular cavity by fibrous tissue and thrombus contributes to the abnormally increased resistance to ventricular filling. Thromboembolic complications are frequent in such patients The inability\" of the ventricles to fill limits cardiac output and raises filling pressures; thus, exercise intolerance and dyspnea are usually prominent. As a result of persistently elevated systemic venous pressure, these patients commonly have dependent edema, ascites, and an enlarged, tender, and often pulsatile liver.

Special stains for fungi and mycobacteria are negative. The patient works as a secretary and has no history of occupational exposure to airborne minerals or organic dusts. Which of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis?",
        "exp": "The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is usually made by exclusion. This disease is characterized by non-necrotizing granulomas developing most frequently in the lungs, lymph nodes, retina, heart, spleen, skin, and liver. Non-necrotizing granulomas may be seen in a number of other conditions, such as infections and ceain forms of pneumoconiosis, which must be ruled out before making a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The etiopathogenesis of sarcoidosis is obscure. Cell-mediated mechanisms are thought to be involved in an immune response to as yet unidentified antigens. About two-thirds of patients with sarcoidosis recover without residual functional deficits, 20% have permanent pulmonary or visual damage, and 10% die of pulmonary or cardiac involvement. Also know: Asbestosis, berylliosis, and byssinosis are all lung diseases caused by inhalation of airborne dusts. Asbestosis is due to chronic inhalation of asbestos fibers, which may affect workers involved in installation and removal of insulation. Asbestosis leads to diffuse fibrosis of the lungs. In this case, granulomas are absent or scanty; the most characteristic sign of asbestos exposure is the asbestos body, which is an elongated beaded rod composed of asbestos fibers coated by proteins. Chronic exposure to beryllium in mining and fabrication leads to berylliosis, a granulomatous condition of the lungs indistinguishable morphologically from sarcoidosis. Clinical history is therefore essential in excluding this condition. Byssinosis results from occupational exposure to cotton fibers. This condition belongs to a diversified category of diseases mediated by a hypersensitivity reaction against inhaled organic dusts. Farmer's lung, pigeon breeder's lung, air-conditioner lung, and byssinosis are typical examples of these conditions, which lead to a granulomatous reaction that may progress to diffuse pulmonary fibrosis. Again, clinical history is crucial in the identification of this etiology. Ref: Wasfi Y. S., Fontenot A. P. (2003). Chapter 12. Sarcoidosis. In M. E. Hanley, C. H.

The key feature of bronchioloalveolar carcinomas is their growth along preexisting structures without destruction of the alveolar architecture.

In addition to the lymphoid system the nervous system is a major target of HIV infection. Macrophages and microglia cells in the central nervous system that belongs to the monocyte and macrophages lineages are the predominant types in the brain that are infected with HIV. It is widely believed that HIV is carried into the brain by infected monocytes. Ninety percent of patients demonstrate some form of neurological involvement at autopsy. C. N. S. involvement in AIDS usually produces AIDS dementia complex. The pathology associated with AIDS related congnitive motor complex sometimes called subacute encephalitis is located mainly in subcoical areas with relative sparing of cerebral coex. Between 10 and 20% of I-UV-infected patients present with neurologic signs as their first clinical manifestation of infection. In some, no other signs of AIDS develop. Between 50 and 70% of all AIDS patients eventually develop some features of what is called AIDS dementia or the AIDS related cognitive-motor complex. -This term is used to describe the characteristic pattern of cognitive, motor, and behavioral dysfunction, including mood disturbances, seen in AIDS patients. At autopsy, between 60 and 90% of AIDS patients brains show some. form of pathology. Pathologic changes directly due to HIV infection (subacute encephalitis) The pathology associated with the AIDS-related cognitive-motor complex, sometimes called subacute encephalitis, is located mainly in subcoical areas, with relative sparing of cerebral coex. Microscopic changes include: - Diffuse white matter pallor - Perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes and macrophages - Foci of necrosis, gliosis, and/or demyelination Microglial nodules, macrophages and multinucleated cells Remember, Vasculitis is characteristically absent in CNS involvement in AIDS. The virus enters the brain, probably primarily by way of nacrophages, as HIV has been localized in CNS, mainly in macrophages, microglia and multinucleated giant cells. The virus is able to reproduce in the brain. Vacuolar myelopathy - Is sometimes seen in the spinal cord. This change consists of white matter vacuolation in posterior and lateral columns, and is mainly due to swelling within mhyelin sheaths.

Melanino It is an endogenous, non hemoglobin derived brown-black pigment. o Melanin is the only endogenous brown black pigment. Hemosiderin. It is hemoglobin derived, golden yellow to brown, granular or crystalline pigment in which form iron is stored in cells. o When there is local or systemic excess of iron, ferritin forms hemosiderin granules. o Thus hemosiderin pigment represents aggregrates of ferritin micelles. o Under normal conditions small amounts of hemosiderin can be seen in the mononuclear phagocytes of the bone marrow, spleen and liver, all actively engaged in red cell breakdown. Bilirubin.

Pathophvsiologv o Celiac disease is caused by action of acidic peptides containing the gliadin fraction of wheat. The basic abnormality is thought to be an increased rate of loss of epithelial cells. Crypt cells show increased activity. This causes hyperophy of crypt. But even this increased activity cannot keep pace with loss of cells, resulting in progressive decrease in height of villi causing villous atrophy. The epithelial cells show decreased cytoplasm and mucus. The intestinal biopsy shows a decreases in the villus: crypt ratio. Normally the villi are 3-4 times the height of the crypts (ratio of 3-4: 1); in celiac disease, the ratio decreases progressively (paial, subtotal and total villous atrophy).

The four most frequent causes are trauma, sepsis, shock, and gastric aspiration. The pathogenesis is not entirely clear, but influx of neutrophils and release of cytokines, eicosanoids, and free radicals seem to be crucial in promoting alveolar damage. The most characteristic histopathologic hallmark of diffuse alveolar damage is formation of hyaline membranes within the alveolar cavities. These consist of proteinaceous material of plasma origin and necrotic debris from desquamated epithelium. The condition has a 60% moality and manifests with acute respiratory failure. Also Know: The pathologic features of asthma are relatively nonspecific and are similar, for example, to those of chronic bronchitis, including chronic inflammatory infiltration, hyperplasia of mucous glands, and hyperophy of smooth muscle. The presence of numerous eosinophils, however, is more characteristic of asthma. Bacterial pneumonia is characterized by intra-alveolar exudation of neutrophils, fibrin, and erythrocytes. Bacteria are also present within the alveolar cavities. Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP) is a form of interstitial disease referred to as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In contrast to usual interstitial pneumonitis (another form of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), DIP is more responsive to steroid treatment. Histopathologically, DIP leads to hyperplasia of pneumocytes and accumulation of histiocytes that fill the alveolar cavities. Ref: Levy B. D., Choi A. M. (2012). Chapter 268.

The reticulocytes attain a maximal value on the 5th to 10th day after institution of therapy and thereafter gradually return to nonnal. The reticulocyte response may not be detectable in mild iron deficiency anemia. The blood hemoglobin level is the most accurate measure of the degree of anemia in iron deficiency anemia. During the response to therapy, the red cell count may increase temporarily to values above normal, but the hemoglobin value lags behind. The red cell indices may remain abnormal for some time after the normal hemoglobin level is restored. As recovery occurs, a normocytic cell population gradually replaces the microcytic population; and one of the early signs of response to therapy is an increase in RBW from pretreatment level.

It is defined pathologically as an abnormal permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by the destruction of alveolar walls and without obvious fibrosis. It frequently occurs in association with chronic bronchitis. Patients have been classified as having COPD with either emphysema or chronic bronchitis predominance. The 3 described morphological types of emphysema are centriacinar, panacinar, and paraseptal. Centriacinar emphysema begins in the respiratory bronchioles and spreads peripherally. Also termed centrilobular emphysema, this form is associated with long-standing cigarette smoking and predominantly involves the upper half of the lungs.- Panacinar emphysema destroys the entire alveolus uniformly and is predominant in the lower half of the lungs. Panacinar emphysema generally is observed in patients with homozygous alfal antitrypsin deficiency. In people who smoke, focal panacinar emphysema at the lung bases may accompany centriacinar emphysema.- Paraseptal emphysema, also known as distal acinar emphysema, preferentially involves the distal airway structures, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs. The process is localized around the septae of the lungs or pleura. Although airflow frequently is preserved, the apical bullae may lead to spontaneous pneumothorax.

Which of the following pathologic mechanisms most likely accounts for this child's clinical presentation?",
        "exp": "Any tumor \"filling the 4th ventricle\" blocks the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This blockage leads to increased intracranial pressure, which manifests with nausea, vomiting, headache, nuchal rigidity, and mental status changes. If surgery is not performed promptly, cerebellar tonsillar herniation and rapid death will ensue. In children, medulloblastoma and ependymoma are the most frequent neoplasms presenting in this manner. There is no evidence in this case suggesting that acute hemorrhage into the 4th ventricular cavity has occurred, nor is medulloblastoma typically associated with this complication. CNS tumors that frequently bleed are metastases from melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and choriocarcinoma. Alterations in medullary function lead to cardiorespiratory instability and may be caused by direct tumor compression or infiltration of the medulla, neither of which is suppoed by MRI findings in this case. Infiltration of the cerebellar vermis is ceainly seen in many cases of medulloblastoma, a tumor that arises from this midline cerebellar structure. However, this would lead to truncal ataxia and gait instability, not symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Ref: Ropper A. H., Samuels M. A. (2009). Chapter 30.

A. Physiological (most of the time) Programmed cell death. B. Pathological Unprogrammed cell death. A. Physiological apoptosis o Death by apoptosis is a normal phenomenon that serves to eliminate cells that are no longer needed. o It is impoant in the following physiologic situation:? The programmed destruction of cells during embryogenesis, including implantation, organogenesis, and metamorphosis. Hormone dependent involution in adult, e. g., endometrial cell breakdown during menstural cycle, ovarian follicular atresia in the menopause, the regression of lactating breast after weaning, and prostatic atrophy after castration. Cell deletion in proliferating cell population in order to maintain a constant number, e. g., intestinal crypt epithelium. Death of host cells that have served their useful purpose, such as neutrophils after an acute inflammatory response, and lymphocytes at the end of an immune response. Elimination of potentially harmful self-reactive lymphocytes in thymus. Cell death induced by cytotoxic T cells to eliminate virus infected and neoplastic cells. Same mechanism occurs in graft versus host disease. B. Pathological apoptosis o Apoptosis may also be pathological. o When cells are damaged beyond repair, especially when the damage affects the cell's DNA, the irreparably damaged cells are eliminated:? Cell death produced by injuries stimuli --> Radiation and cytotoxic anticancer drugs damage DNA, and if repair mechanisms cannot cope with the injury, the cell kills itself by apoptosis. In these situations, elimination of the cell may be a better alternative than risking mutations and translocations in the damaged DNA which may result in malignant transformation.

It is the most gene-dense region of the mammalian genome and plays an impoant role in the immune system and autoimmunity. The proteins encoded by the MHC are expressed on the surface of cells and display both self antigens (peptide fragments from the cell itself) and nonself antigens (e. g., fragments of invading microorganisms) to a type of lymphocytes called a T cell that has the capacity to kill or coordinate the killing of pathogens in infected or malfunctioning cells The classical MHC molecules (also referred to as HLA molecules in humans) have a vital role in the complex immunological dialogue that must occur between T cells and other cells of the body. The polypeptides may be \"self, \" that is, originating from a protein created by the organism itself, or they may be foreign (\"nonself\"), originating from bacteria, viruses, pollen, and so on. Three main sets of genes are suspected in many autoimmune diseases. These genes are related to: Immunoglobul insT-cell receptors. The major histocompatibility complexes (MHC).

        "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i. e., Testis In hemochromatosis, hypogonadism is caused by impairment of hypothalamic pituitary function and not due to deposition of Iron in the Testis. Hemochromatosis Hemochromatosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of body iron, most of which is deposited in parenchymal organs such as liver and pancreas. The total body content of the iron is tightly regulated, as the daily losses are matched by gastrointestinal absorption. In hereditary hemochromatosis, regulation of intestinal absorption of dietary iron is lost, leading to net iron accumulation of 0. 5 to 1. 0 gm/year. It may be recalled that the total body iron pool ranges from 2-6 gm in normal adults; about 0. 5 gm is stored in the liver 98% of which is hepatocytes. In hemochromatosis the iron accumulation may exceed 50 gm, over one third of which accumulates in the liver. The iron accumulation is life long, the rate of net iron accumulation is 0. 5 to 1. 0 gm/year. The disease manifests itself typically after 20 gm of storage iron have accumulated. The disease first mainfests itself in the fifth to sixth decades of life. Excessive iron is directly toxic to host tissues The clinical features of hemochromatosis are characterized principally by deposition of excess iron in the following organs in decreasing order of severity.",

'Recovery of Tensile Strength: Fibrillar collagens (mostly type I collagen) form a major portion of the connective tissue in repair sites and are essential for the development of strength in healing wounds. Net collagen accumulation, however, depends not only on increased collagen synthesis but also on decreased degradation. When sutures are removed from an incisional surgical wound, usually at the end of the first week, wound strength is approximately 10% that of unwounded skin. Wound strength increases rapidly over the next 4 weeks, slows down at approximately the third month after the original incision, and reaches a plateau at about 70% to 80% of the tensile strength of unwounded skin. Lower tensile strength in the healed wound area may persist for life.

The overlying skin in inflammatory breast cancer is usually swollen, red, and tender. Acute inflammation is a rare finding in breast cancer and may be associated with secondary infection or abscess. Chronic inflammation in breast cancer is a non-specific finding. In medullary breast cancer, a type of invasive ductal carcinoma, there are a large number of lymphocytes around the tumor and a desmoplastic reaction is often absent in the surrounding tissue. This type of cancer carries a somewhat better prognosis. Epidermal invasion by cancer cells is a poor prognostic indicator. Intraepidermal malignant cells are called Paget cells.

When ceain non degradable antigen such as tubercle antigen is present, the initial perivascular mononuclear cell monocyte infiltrate is replaced by macrophages over a period of 2-3 weeks. The accumulated macrophage then undergo morphological transformation into epithelial like cells and are then referred to as epithelioid cells. A microscopic aggregation of epithelioid cells, usually surrounded by a collar of lymphocytes, is referred to as granuloma. And this pattern of inflammation is called granulomatous inflammation.

Associated diseases Rheumatoid Arthritis (Me) SLE Polymyositis Systemic sclerosis Vasculitis Thyroiditis The ductal epithelial cells of the exocrine glands are the primary target for autoantibodies. There is also systemic B-cell hyperactivity, as evidenced by the presence of ANAs and RF. Autoantibodies to the RNP antigens SS-A (Ro) and SS-B (La) (also present in SLE) Other secretory glands like nasopharynx, upper airway, and vagina, may also be involved Involved tissues show an intense lymphocyte (primarily activated CD4+ T cells) and plasma cell infiltrate. Lacrimal gland destruction results in a lack of tears, leading to drying of the corneal epithelium, with subsequent inflammation, erosion, and ulceration (keratoconjunctivitis). Similar changes may occur in the oral mucosa as a result of the loss of salivary gland output, giving rise to mucosal atrophy, with inflammatory Assuring and ulceration (xerostomia). Dryness and crusting of the nose may lead to ulcerations and even perforation of the nasal septum. When the respiratory passages are involved, secondary laryngitis, bronchitis, and pneumonitis may appear. Approximately 25% of the patients (especially those with anti-SS-A antibodies) develop extra-glandular disease affecting the CNS, skin, kidneys, and muscles.

        "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i. e., Mast cells Type I hypersensitivity (Immediate hypersensitivity) o It is a rapidly developing immunological reaction occuring within minutes after the combination of an antigen with antibody bound to mast cells in individuals previously sensitized to the antigen. o Immediate hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by Ig E, but T and B cells play impoant role in the development of these antibodies. o Type I reaction requires prior sensitization to a specific antigen (allergen). o Most exposures occur either by inhalation (respiratory route) or ingestion (GIT) of antigen. o Type one hypersensitivity has two phases:- 1. Initial response o After first antigen exposure, this antigen is presented to CD-4 helper T cells (TH2 type) by antigen presenting cells. These primed TH2 cells release IL-4 that acts on B-cells to form Ig E specific for that paicular antigen. The antigen specific lg E antibodies then bind to the surface receptors of mast cells and basophils. The process from first antigen exposure to the coating of mast cells by Ig E acts as sensitization (prior sensitization) and first exposure is also called priming or sensitizing exposure (dose). Subsequent exposure (shocking dose) to same antigen then result in activation of mast cells and basophils with release of mediator from these cells that leads to? Smooth muscle spasm Increase mucus secretion from the epithelial cells. Vasodilatation Increased vascular permeability Recuritment of inflammatory cells Note - Most of the clinical effects are due to smooth muscle spasm. 2. Late phase response In this phase additional leukocytes are recruited. These cells amplify and sustain the inflammatory response without additional exposure to the triggred antigen. Among the cells that are recruited in the late-phase reaction, eosinophils are paicularly impoant. Eosinophils produce major basic protein and eosinophilic cataionic protein that are toxic to epithelial cells. Platelet activating factor (PAF) recruits and activates inflammatory cells and is most impoant cytokine in the initatiation of late phase response. Type I hypersensitivity occurs in two forms Anaphylaxis --> Acute, potentially fatal, systemic. Atom --> Chronic, Nonfatal, Lacalized. Remember o Mast cells are the most impoant cells in type I hypersensitivity. o Eosinophils are the most impoant cells in the late phase reaction of type I hypersensitivity. o Histamine is the most impoant mediator in type I hypersensitivity. o IL-4 is paicularly impoant, it is essential for turning on IgE secreting B cells. o PAF is the most impoant cytokine in the initiation of late phase reaction. o Most potent eosinophilic activating cytokine is IL-5.",

Laboratory examination is remarkable for elevated alkaline phosphatase.. X-ray studies demonstrate skull thickening with narrowing of foramina, and bowing of the femur and tibia. Bone biopsy reveals a mosaic pattern of bone spicules with prominent osteoid seams. Which of the following neoplasms occurs at an increased frequency in patients with this disorder?",
        "exp": "The phrase \"mosaic pattern\" of newly formed woven bone is a specific tip-off for Paget's disease of bone, and is not seen in other bone conditions. The clinical and radiologic presentation are typical; an increased hat size may also be a clue. In its early stages, Paget's disease is characterised by osteolysis, producing patchwork areas of bone resorption with bizarre, large osteoclasts. In the middle stage of the disease, secondary osteoblastic activity compensates with new bone formation, producing the mosaic pattern. In late Paget's, the bones are dense and osteosclerotic. Paget's disease is suspected to be related to prior viral infection, but the cause remains mysterious. Complications include myelophthisic anemia, high output cardiac failure, pain secondary to nerve compression, deformities secondary to skeletal changes, and in about 1% of patients, osteosarcoma or other sarcoma, typically involving the jaw, pelvis, or femur. An increased incidence of astrocytomas is associated with tuberous sclerosis. Hodgkin's lymphoma is usually a disease of young adults, although older patients may have the lymphocyte-depleted form. Meningiomas are mostly benign tumors that affect adults, especially females. There may be an association with breast cancer, possibly related to high estrogen states. Ref: Wyatt C., Butterwoh IV J.

All nucleated cells in different tissues synthesize cholesterol, but the excretion of cholesterol is mainly by liver in the bile or by enterocytes in gut lumen. So, cholesterol must be transpoed from peripheral tissue to liver for excretion. o This is facilitated by HDL and is called reverse cholesterol transpo because it transpos the cholesterol in reverse direction to that is transpoed from liver to peripheral tissues through VLDL LDL cycle. Processo HDL is synthesized in liver and small intestine. o Nascent HDL contain phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol and Apo-A, C, E. This nascent HDL is secreted into circulation where it acquires additional unesterified cholesterol from peripheral tissues. o Within the HDL paicle, the cholesterol is esterified by lecithin - cholesterol acetyltransferase (LCAT) to form cholesteryl ester and additional lipid are transpoed to HDL from VLDL and chylomicrons. o There are two pathway by which this cholesterol is transpoed to liver.",
